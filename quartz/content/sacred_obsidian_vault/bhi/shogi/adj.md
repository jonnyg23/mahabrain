                    THE ADVENT OF DIVINE JUSTICE 
 
To the beloved of God and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout 
     the United States and Canada.  
 
Best-beloved brothers and sisters 
     in the love of &amp;Baha'u'llah:  
 
     It would be difficult indeed to adequately express the 
feelings of irrepressible joy and exultation that flood my 
heart every time I pause to contemplate the ceaseless evidences 
of the dynamic energy which animates the stalwart 
pioneers of the World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the execution 
of the Plan committed to their charge.  The signature of the 
contract, by your elected national representatives, signalizing 
the opening of the final phase of the greatest enterprise 
ever launched by the followers of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in 
the West, no less than the extremely heartening progress recorded 
in the successive reports of their National Teaching 
Committee, attest, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the fidelity, 
the vigor, and the thoroughness with which you are 
conducting the manifold operations which the evolution of 
the Seven Year Plan must necessarily involve.  In both of its 
aspects, and in all its details, it is being prosecuted with exemplary 
regularity and precision, with undiminished efficiency, 
and commendable dispatch.  
     The resourcefulness which the national representatives 
of the American believers have, in recent months, so strikingly 
demonstrated, as evidenced by the successive measures 
they have adopted, has been matched by the loyal, the 
unquestioning and generous support accorded them by all 
 
+P2 
those whom they represent, at every critical stage, and with 
every fresh advance, in the discharge of their sacred duties.  
Such close interaction, such complete cohesion, such continual 
harmony and fellowship between the various agencies 
that contribute to the organic life, and constitute the basic 
framework, of every properly functioning &amp;Baha'i community, 
is a phenomenon which offers a striking contrast to the 
disruptive tendencies which the discordant elements of 
present-day society so tragically manifest.  Whereas every 
apparent trial with which the unfathomable wisdom of the 
Almighty deems it necessary to afflict His chosen community 
serves only to demonstrate afresh its essential solidarity 
and to consolidate its inward strength, each of the 
successive crises in the fortunes of a decadent age exposes 
more convincingly than the one preceding it the corrosive 
influences that are fast sapping the vitality and undermining 
the basis of its declining institutions.  
     For such demonstrations of the interpositions of an 
ever-watchful Providence they who stand identified with 
the Community of the Most Great Name must feel eternally 
grateful.  From every fresh token of His unfailing blessing on 
the one hand, and of His visitation on the other, they cannot 
but derive immense hope and courage.  Alert to seize every 
opportunity which the revolutions of the wheel of destiny 
within their Faith offers them, and undismayed by the prospect 
of spasmodic convulsions that must sooner or later fatally 
affect those who have refused to embrace its light, 
they, and those who will labor after them, must press forward 
until the processes now set in motion will have each 
spent its force and contributed its share towards the birth of 
the Order now stirring in the womb of a travailing age.  
     These recurrent crises which, with ominous frequency 
and resistless force, are afflicting an ever-increasing portion 
of the human race must of necessity continue, however impermanently, 
to exercise, in a certain measure, their baleful 
influence upon a world community which has spread its 
ramifications to the uttermost ends of the earth.  How can 
 
+P3 
the beginnings of a world upheaval, unleashing forces that 
are so gravely deranging the social, the religious, the political, 
and the economic equilibrium of organized society, 
throwing into chaos and confusion political systems, racial 
doctrines, social conceptions, cultural standards, religious 
associations, and trade relationships--how can such agitations, 
on a scale so vast, so unprecedented, fail to produce 
any repercussions on the institutions of a Faith of such tender 
age whose teachings have a direct and vital bearing on 
each of these spheres of human life and conduct?  
     Little wonder, therefore, if they who are holding aloft 
the banner of so pervasive a Faith, so challenging a Cause, 
find themselves affected by the impact of these world-shaking 
forces.  Little wonder if they find that in the midst of 
this whirlpool of contending passions their freedom has 
been curtailed, their tenets contemned, their institutions assaulted, 
their motives maligned, their authority jeopardized, 
their claim rejected.  
     In the heart of the European continent a community 
which, as predicted by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, is destined, by virtue 
of its spiritual potentialities and geographical situation, to 
radiate the splendor of the light of the Faith on the countries 
that surround it, has been momentarily eclipsed through the 
restrictions which a regime that has sorely misapprehended 
its purpose and function has chosen to impose upon it.  Its 
voice, alas, is now silenced, its institutions dissolved, its literature 
banned, its archives confiscated, and its meetings 
suspended.  
     In central Asia, in the city enjoying the unique distinction 
of having been chosen by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha as the home of 
the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the &amp;Baha'i world, as well as 
in the towns and villages of the province to which it belongs, 
the sore-pressed Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, as a result of 
the extraordinary and unique vitality which, in the course of 
several decades, it has consistently manifested, finds itself at 
the mercy of forces which, alarmed at its rising power, are 
now bent on reducing it to utter impotence.  Its Temple, 
 
+P4 
though still used for purposes of &amp;Baha'i worship, has been 
expropriated, its Assemblies and committees disbanded, its 
teaching activities crippled, its chief promoters deported, 
and not a few of its most enthusiastic supporters, both men 
and women, imprisoned.  
     In the land of its birth, wherein reside the immense 
majority of its followers--a country whose capital has been 
hailed by &amp;Baha'u'llah as the "mother of the world" and the 
"dayspring of the joy of mankind"--a civil authority, as yet undivorced 
officially from the paralyzing influences of an antiquated, 
a fanatical, and outrageously corrupt clergy, pursues 
relentlessly its campaign of repression against the adherents 
of a Faith which it has for well-nigh a century striven unsuccessfully 
to suppress.  Indifferent to the truth that the members 
of this innocent and proscribed community can justly 
claim to rank as among the most disinterested, the most 
competent, and the most ardent lovers of their native land, 
contemptuous of their high sense of world citizenship 
which the advocates of an excessive and narrow nationalism 
can never hope to appreciate, such an authority refuses to 
grant to a Faith which extends its spiritual jurisdiction over 
well-nigh six hundred local communities, and which numerically 
outnumbers the adherents of either the Christian, 
the Jewish, or the Zoroastrian Faiths in that land, the necessary 
legal right to enforce its laws, to administer its affairs, to 
conduct its schools, to celebrate its festivals, to circulate its 
literature, to solemnize its rites, to erect its edifices, and to 
safeguard its endowments.  
     And now recently in the Holy Land itself, the heart and 
nerve-center of a world-embracing Faith, the fires of racial 
animosity, of fratricidal strife, of unabashed terrorism, have 
lit a conflagration that gravely interferes, on the one hand, 
with that flow of pilgrims that constitutes the lifeblood of 
that center, and suspends, on the other, the various projects 
that had been initiated in connection with the preservation 
and extension of the areas surrounding the sacred Spots it 
enshrines.  The safety of the small community of resident 
 
+P5 
believers, faced by the rising tide of lawlessness, has been 
imperiled, its status as a neutral and distinct community indirectly 
challenged, and its freedom to carry out certain of 
its observances curtailed.  A series of murderous assaults, alternating 
with outbursts of bitter fanaticism, both racial and 
religious, involving the leaders as well as the followers of 
the three leading Faiths in that distracted country, have, at 
times, threatened to sever all normal communications both 
within its confines as well as with the outside world.  Perilous 
though the situation has been, the &amp;Baha'i Holy Places, 
the object of the adoration of a world-encircling Faith, have, 
notwithstanding their number and exposed position, and 
though to outward seeming deprived of any means of protection, 
been vouchsafed a preservation little short of miraculous.  
     A world, torn with conflicting passions, and perilously 
disintegrating from within, finds itself confronted, at so crucial 
an epoch in its history, by the rising fortunes of an infant 
Faith, a Faith that, at times, seems to be drawn into its 
controversies, entangled by its conflicts, eclipsed by its gathering 
shadows, and overpowered by the mounting tide of its 
passions.  In its very heart, within its cradle, at the seat of its 
first and venerable Temple, in one of its hitherto flourishing 
and potentially powerful centers, the as-yet unemancipated 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah seems indeed to have retreated before 
the onrushing forces of violence and disorder to which humanity 
is steadily falling a victim.  The strongholds of such a 
Faith, one by one and day after day, are to outward seeming 
being successively isolated, assaulted and captured.  As the 
lights of liberty flicker and go out, as the din of discord 
grows louder and louder every day, as the fires of fanaticism 
flame with increasing fierceness in the breasts of men, as the 
chill of irreligion creeps relentlessly over the soul of mankind, 
the limbs and organs that constitute the body of the 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah appear, in varying measure, to have become 
afflicted with the crippling influences that now hold 
in their grip the whole of the civilized world.  
 
+P6 
     How clearly and strikingly the following words of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha are being demonstrated at this hour:  "The darkness 
of error that has enveloped the East and the West is, in this 
most great cycle, battling with the light of Divine Guidance.  Its 
swords and its spears are very sharp and pointed; its army keenly 
bloodthirsty."  "This day," He, in another passage has written, 
"the powers of all the leaders of religion are directed towards the 
dispersion of the congregation of the All-Merciful, and the shattering 
of the Divine Edifice.  The hosts of the world, whether material, 
cultural or political are from every side launching their assault, for 
the Cause is great, very great.  Its greatness is, in this day, clear and 
manifest to men's eyes."  
     The one chief remaining citadel, the mighty arm which 
still raises aloft the standard of an unconquerable Faith, is 
none other than the blessed community of the followers of 
the Most Great Name in the North American continent.  By 
its works, and through the unfailing protection vouchsafed 
to it by an almighty Providence, this distinguished member 
of the body of the constantly interacting &amp;Baha'i communities 
of East and West, bids fair to be universally regarded as the 
cradle, as well as the stronghold, of that future New World 
Order, which is at once the promise and the glory of the Dispensation 
associated with the name of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Let anyone inclined to either belittle the unique station 
conferred upon this community, or to question the role it 
will be called upon to play in the days to come, ponder the 
implication of these pregnant and highly illuminating words 
uttered by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and addressed to it at a time when 
the fortunes of a world groaning beneath the burden of a 
devastating war had reached their lowest ebb.  "The continent 
of America," He so significantly wrote, "is, in the eyes of the one 
true God, the land wherein the splendors of His light shall be revealed, 
where the mysteries of His Faith shall be unveiled, where 
the righteous will abide, and the free assemble."  
     Already, the community of the believers of the North 
American continent--at once the prime mover and pattern 
of the future communities which the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah is 
 
+P7 
destined to raise up throughout the length and breadth 
of the Western Hemisphere--has, despite the prevailing 
gloom, shown its capacity to be recognized as the torchbearer 
of that light, the repository of those mysteries, the exponent 
of that righteousness and the sanctuary of that freedom.  
To what other light can these above-quoted words 
possibly allude, if not to the light of the glory of the Golden 
Age of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah?  What mysteries could &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
have contemplated except the mysteries of that 
embryonic World Order now evolving within the matrix of 
His Administration?  What righteousness if not the righteousness 
whose reign that Age and that Order can alone establish?  
What freedom but the freedom which the proclamation 
of His sovereignty in the fullness of time must 
bestow?  
     The community of the organized promoters of the 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the American continent--the spiritual 
descendants of the dawn-breakers of an heroic Age, 
who by their death proclaimed the birth of that Faith--
must, in turn, usher in, not by their death but through living 
sacrifice, that promised World Order, the shell ordained to 
enshrine that priceless jewel, the world civilization, of which 
the Faith itself is the sole begetter.  While its sister communities 
are bending beneath the tempestuous winds that beat 
upon them from every side, this community, preserved by 
the immutable decrees of the omnipotent Ordainer and deriving 
continual sustenance from the mandate with which 
the Tablets of the Divine Plan have invested it, is now busily 
engaged in laying the foundations and in fostering the 
growth of those institutions which are to herald the approach 
of the Age destined to witness the birth and rise of 
the World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     A community, relatively negligible in its numerical 
strength; separated by vast distances from both the focal-center 
of its Faith and the land wherein the preponderating 
mass of its fellow-believers reside; bereft in the main of material 
resources and lacking in experience and in prominence; 
 
+P8 
ignorant of the beliefs, concepts and habits of those 
peoples and races from which its spiritual Founders have 
sprung; wholly unfamiliar with the languages in which its 
sacred Books were originally revealed; constrained to place 
its sole reliance upon an inadequate rendering of only a 
fragmentary portion of the literature embodying its laws, its 
tenets, and its history; subjected from its infancy to tests of 
extreme severity, involving, at times, the defection of some 
of its most prominent members; having to contend, ever 
since its inception, and in an ever-increasing measure, with 
the forces of corruption, of moral laxity, and ingrained prejudice--
such a community, in less than half a century, and 
unaided by any of its sister communities, whether in the 
East or in the West, has, by virtue of the celestial potency 
with which an all-loving Master has abundantly endowed 
it, lent an impetus to the onward march of the Cause it has 
espoused which the combined achievements of its coreligionists 
in the West have failed to rival.  
     What other community, it can confidently be asked, 
has been instrumental in fixing the pattern, and in imparting 
the original impulse, to those administrative institutions that 
constitute the vanguard of the World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah?  
What other community has been capable of demonstrating, 
with such consistency, the resourcefulness, the discipline, 
the iron determination, the zeal and perseverance, the devotion 
and fidelity, so indispensable to the erection and the 
continued extension of the framework within which those 
nascent institutions can alone multiply and mature?  What 
other community has proved itself to be fired by so noble a 
vision, or willing to rise to such heights of self-sacrifice, or 
ready to achieve so great a measure of solidarity, as to be 
able to raise, in so short a time and in the course of such 
crucial years, an edifice that can well deserve to be regarded 
as the greatest contribution ever made by the West to the 
Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah?  What other community can justifiably 
lay claim to have succeeded, through the unsupported efforts 
of one of its humble members, in securing the spontaneous 
 
+P9 
allegiance of Royalty to its Cause, and in winning 
such marvelous and written testimonies to its truth?  What 
other community has shown the foresight, the organizing 
ability, the enthusiastic eagerness, that have been responsible 
for the establishment and multiplication, throughout its 
territory, of those initial schools which, as time goes by, will, 
on the one hand, evolve into powerful centers of &amp;Baha'i 
learning, and, on the other, provide a fertile recruiting 
ground for the enrichment and consolidation of its teaching 
force?  What other community has produced pioneers combining 
to such a degree the essential qualities of audacity, of 
consecration, of tenacity, of self-renunciation, and unstinted 
devotion, that have prompted them to abandon their 
homes, and forsake their all, and scatter over the surface of 
the globe, and hoist in its uttermost corners the triumphant 
banner of &amp;Baha'u'llah?  Who else but the members of this 
community have won the eternal distinction of being the 
first to raise the call of &amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha in such highly important 
and widely scattered centers and territories as the 
hearts of both the British and French empires, Germany, the 
Far East, the Balkan States, the Scandinavian countries, Latin 
America, the Islands of the Pacific, South Africa, Australia 
and New Zealand, and now more recently the Baltic States?  
Who else but those same pioneers have shown themselves 
ready to undertake the labor, to exercise the patience, and to 
provide the funds, required for the translation and publication, 
in no less than forty languages, of their sacred literature, 
the dissemination of which is an essential prerequisite 
to any effectively organized campaign of teaching?  What 
other community can lay claim to have had a decisive share 
in the worldwide efforts that have been exerted for the safeguarding 
and the extension of the immediate surroundings 
of its holy shrines, as well as for the preliminary acquisition 
of the future sites of its international institutions at its world 
center?  What other community can to its eternal credit claim 
to have been the first to frame its national and local constitutions, 
thereby laying down the fundamental lines of the 
 
+P10 
twin charters designed to regulate the activities, define the 
functions, and safeguard the rights, of its institutions?  What 
other community can boast of having simultaneously acquired 
and legally secured the basis of its national endowments, 
thus paving the way for a similar action on the part 
of its local communities?  What other community has 
achieved the supreme distinction of having obtained, long 
before any of its sister communities had envisaged such a 
possibility, the necessary documents assuring the recognition, 
by both the federal and state authorities, of its Spiritual 
Assemblies and national endowments?  And finally what 
other community has had the privilege, and been granted 
the means, to succor the needy, to plead the cause of the 
downtrodden, and to intervene so energetically for the safeguarding 
of &amp;Baha'i edifices and institutions in countries such 
as Persia, Egypt, &amp;Iraq, Russia, and Germany, where, at various 
times, its fellow-believers have had to suffer the rigors 
of both religious and racial persecution?  
     Such a matchless and brilliant record of service, extending 
over a period of well-nigh twenty years, and so 
closely interwoven with the interest and fortunes of such a 
large section of the worldwide &amp;Baha'i community, deserves 
to rank as a memorable chapter in the history of the Formative 
Period of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Reinforced and enriched 
as it is by the memory of the American believers' earlier 
achievements, such a record is in itself convincing 
testimony to their ability to befittingly shoulder the responsibilities 
which any task may impose upon them in the future.  
To overrate the significance of these manifold services 
would be well-nigh impossible.  To appraise correctly their 
value, and dilate on their merits and immediate consequences, 
is a task which only a future &amp;Baha'i historian can 
properly discharge.  I can only for the present place on record 
my profound conviction that a community capable of 
showing forth such deeds, of evincing such a spirit, of rising 
to such heights, cannot but be already possessed of such potentialities 
as will enable it to vindicate, in the fullness of 
 
+P11 
time, its right to be acclaimed as the chief creator and champion 
of the World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Magnificent as has been this record, reminiscent as it is, 
in some of its aspects, of the exploits with which the dawn-breakers 
of an heroic Age have proclaimed the birth of the 
Faith itself, the task associated with the name of this privileged 
community is, far from approaching its climax, only 
beginning to unfold.  What the American believers have, 
within the space of almost fifty years, achieved is infinitesimal 
when compared to the magnitude of the tasks ahead of 
them.  The rumblings of that catastrophic upheaval, which is 
to proclaim, at one and the same time, the death-pangs of 
the old order and the birth-pangs of the new, indicate both 
the steady approach, as well as the awe-inspiring character, 
of those tasks.  
     The virtual establishment of the Administrative Order 
of their Faith, the erection of its framework, the fashioning 
of its instruments, and the consolidation of its subsidiary institutions, 
was the first task committed to their charge, as an 
organized community called into being by the Will, and under 
the instructions, of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  Of this initial task 
they have acquitted themselves with marvelous promptitude, 
fidelity, and vigor.  No sooner had they created and 
correlated the various and necessary agencies for the efficient 
conduct of any policy they might subsequently wish to 
initiate, than they addressed themselves, with equal zest 
and consecration, to the next more arduous task of erecting 
the superstructure of an edifice the cornerstone of which 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself had laid.  And when that feat was 
achieved, this community, alive to the passionate pleas, exhortations, 
and promises recorded in the Tablets of the Divine 
Plan, resolved to undertake yet another task, which in 
its scope and spiritual potentialities is sure to outshine any 
of the works they have already accomplished.  Launching 
with unquenchable enthusiasm and dauntless courage the 
Seven Year Plan, as the first and practical step towards the 
fulfillment of the mission prescribed in those epoch-making 
 
+P12 
Tablets, they entered, with a spirit of renewed consecration, 
upon their dual task, the consummation of which, it is 
hoped, will synchronize with the celebration of the centenary 
of the birth of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Well aware that 
every advance made in the external ornamentation of their 
majestic edifice would directly react on the progress of the 
teaching campaign initiated by them in both the northern 
and southern American continents, and realizing that every 
victory gained in the teaching field would, in its turn, facilitate 
the work, and hasten the completion, of their Temple, 
they are now pressing on, with courage and faith, in their 
efforts to discharge, in both of its phases, their obligations 
under the Plan they have dedicated themselves to execute.  
     Let them not, however, imagine that the carrying out 
of the Seven Year Plan, coinciding as it does with the termination 
of the first century of the &amp;Baha'i era, signifies either 
the termination of, or even an interruption in, the work 
which the unerring Hand of the Almighty is directing them 
to perform.  The opening of the second century of the &amp;Baha'i 
era must needs disclose greater vistas, usher in further 
stages, and witness the initiation of plans more far-reaching 
than any as yet conceived.  The Plan on which is now focused 
the attention, the aspirations, and the resources of the 
entire community of the American believers should be 
viewed as a mere beginning, as a trial of strength, a stepping-stone 
to a crusade of still greater magnitude, if the duties 
and responsibilities with which the Author of the Divine 
Plan has invested them are to be honorably and entirely fulfilled.  
     For the consummation of the present Plan can result in 
no more than the formation of at least one center in each of 
the Republics of the Western Hemisphere, whereas the duties 
prescribed in those Tablets call for a wider diffusion, 
and imply the scattering of a far greater and more representative 
number of the members of the North American &amp;Baha'i 
community over the entire surface of the New World.  It is 
the undoubted mission of the American believers, therefore, 
 
+P13 
to carry forward into the second century the glorious work 
initiated in the closing years of the first.  Not until they have 
played their part in guiding the activities of these isolated 
and newly fledged centers, and in fostering their capacity to 
initiate in their turn institutions, both local and national, 
modeled on their own, can they be satisfied to have adequately 
discharged their immediate obligations under &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
divinely revealed Plan.  
     Nor should it for a moment be supposed that the completion 
of a task which aims at the multiplication of &amp;Baha'i 
centers and the provision of the assistance and guidance 
necessary for the establishment of the Administrative Order 
of the &amp;Baha'i Faith in the countries of Latin America realizes 
in its entirety the scheme visualized for them by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
A perusal, however perfunctory, of those Tablets embodying 
His Plan will instantly reveal a scope for their activities 
that stretches far beyond the confines of the Western 
Hemisphere.  With their inter-American tasks and responsibilities 
virtually discharged, their intercontinental mission 
enters upon its most glorious and decisive phase.  "The moment 
this Divine Message," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself has written, 
"is carried forward by the American believers from the shores of 
America and is propagated through the continents of Europe, of 
Asia, of Africa, and of Australasia, and as far as the islands of the 
Pacific, this community will find itself securely established upon 
the throne of an everlasting dominion."  
     And who knows but that when this colossal task has 
been accomplished a greater, a still more superb mission, incomparable 
in its splendor, and foreordained for them by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, may not be thrust upon them?  The glories of 
such a mission are of such dazzling splendor, the circumstances 
attending it so remote, and the contemporary events 
with the culmination of which it is so closely knit in such a 
state of flux, that it would be premature to attempt, at the 
present time, any accurate delineation of its features.  Suffice 
it to say that out of the turmoil and tribulations of these "latter 
years" opportunities undreamt of will be born, and circumstances 
 
+P14 
unpredictable created, that will enable, nay impel, 
the victorious prosecutors of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Plan, to 
add, through the part they will play in the unrolling of the 
New World Order, fresh laurels to the crown of their servitude 
to the threshold of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Nor should any of the manifold opportunities, of a totally 
different order, be allowed to pass unnoticed which the 
evolution of the Faith itself, whether at its world center, or 
in the North American continent, or even in the most outlying 
regions of the earth, must create, calling once again 
upon the American believers to play a part, no less conspicuous 
than the share they have previously had in their collective 
contributions to the propagation of the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
I can only for the moment cite at random certain of 
these opportunities which stand out preeminently, in any 
attempt to survey the possibilities of the future:  The election 
of the International House of Justice and its establishment in 
the Holy Land, the spiritual and administrative center of the 
&amp;Baha'i world, together with the formation of its auxiliary 
branches and subsidiary institutions; the gradual erection of 
the various dependencies of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of 
the West, and the intricate issues involving the establishment 
and the extension of the structural basis of &amp;Baha'i community 
life; the codification and promulgation of the ordinances 
of the Most Holy Book, necessitating the formation, 
in certain countries of the East, of properly constituted and 
officially recognized courts of &amp;Baha'i law; the building of the 
third &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the &amp;Baha'i world in the outskirts 
of the city of &amp;Tihran, to be followed by the rise of a similar 
House of Worship in the Holy Land itself; the deliverance of 
&amp;Baha'i communities from the fetters of religious orthodoxy 
in such Islamic countries as Persia, &amp;Iraq, and Egypt, and the 
consequent recognition, by the civil authorities in those 
states, of the independent status and religious character of 
&amp;Baha'i National and Local Assemblies; the precautionary 
and defensive measures to be devised, coordinated, and carried 
out to counteract the full force of the inescapable attacks 
 
+P15 
which the organized efforts of ecclesiastical organizations 
of various denominations will progressively launch 
and relentlessly pursue; and, last but not least, the multitudinous 
issues that must be faced, the obstacles that must be 
overcome, and the responsibilities that must be assumed, to 
enable a sore-tried Faith to pass through the successive 
stages of unmitigated obscurity, of active repression, and of 
complete emancipation, leading in turn to its being acknowledged 
as an independent Faith, enjoying the status of 
full equality with its sister religions, to be followed by its establishment 
and recognition as a State religion, which in turn 
must give way to its assumption of the rights and prerogatives 
associated with the &amp;Baha'i state, functioning in the plenitude 
of its powers, a stage which must ultimately culminate 
in the emergence of the worldwide &amp;Baha'i Commonwealth, 
animated wholly by the spirit, and operating solely in direct 
conformity with the laws and principles of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     The challenge offered by these opportunities the 
American believers, I feel confident, will, in addition to their 
answer to the teaching call voiced by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in His 
Tablets, unhesitatingly take up, and will, with their traditional 
fearlessness, tenacity, and efficiency, so respond to it 
as to confirm, before all the world, their title and rank as the 
champion-builders of the mightiest institutions of the Faith 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Dearly beloved friends!  Though the task be long and 
arduous, yet the prize which the All-Bountiful Bestower has 
chosen to confer upon you is of such preciousness that 
neither tongue nor pen can befittingly appraise it.  Though 
the goal towards which you are now so strenuously striving 
be distant, and as yet undisclosed to men's eyes, yet its 
promise lies firmly embedded in the authoritative and unalterable 
utterances of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Though the course He 
has traced for you seems, at times, lost in the threatening 
shadows with which a stricken humanity is now enveloped, 
yet the unfailing light He has caused to shine continually 
upon you is of such brightness that no earthly dusk can ever 
 
+P16 
eclipse its splendor.  Though small in numbers, and circumscribed 
as yet in your experiences, powers, and resources, 
yet the Force which energizes your mission is limitless in its 
range and incalculable in its potency.  Though the enemies 
which every acceleration in the progress of your mission 
must raise up be fierce, numerous, and unrelenting, yet the 
invisible Hosts which, if you persevere, must, as promised, 
rush forth to your aid, will, in the end, enable you to vanquish 
their hopes and annihilate their forces.  Though the ultimate 
blessings that must crown the consummation of your 
mission be undoubted, and the Divine promises given you 
firm and irrevocable, yet the measure of the goodly reward 
which every one of you is to reap must depend on the extent 
to which your daily exertions will have contributed to the 
expansion of that mission and the hastening of its triumph.  
 
     Dearly beloved friends!  Great as is my love and admiration 
for you, convinced as I am of the paramount share 
which you can, and will, undoubtedly have in both the continental 
and international spheres of future &amp;Baha'i activity 
and service, I feel it nevertheless incumbent upon me to utter, 
at this juncture, a word of warning.  The glowing tributes, 
so repeatedly and deservedly paid to the capacity, the 
spirit, the conduct, and the high rank, of the American believers, 
both individually and as an organic community, 
must, under no circumstances, be confounded with the 
characteristics and nature of the people from which God has 
raised them up.  A sharp distinction between that community 
and that people must be made, and resolutely and fearlessly 
upheld, if we wish to give due recognition to the 
transmuting power of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, in its impact 
on the lives and standards of those who have chosen to enlist 
under His banner.  Otherwise, the supreme and distinguishing 
function of His Revelation, which is none other 
than the calling into being of a new race of men, will remain 
wholly unrecognized and completely obscured.  
 
+P17 
     How often have the Prophets of God, not excepting 
&amp;Baha'u'llah Himself, chosen to appear, and deliver their 
Message in countries and amidst peoples and races, at a time 
when they were either fast declining, or had already 
touched the lowest depths of moral and spiritual degradation.  
The appalling misery and wretchedness to which the 
Israelites had sunk, under the debasing and tyrannical rule 
of the Pharaohs, in the days preceding their exodus from 
Egypt under the leadership of Moses; the decline that had 
set in in the religious, the spiritual, the cultural, and the 
moral life of the Jewish people, at the time of the appearance 
of Jesus Christ; the barbarous cruelty, the gross idolatry 
and immorality, which had for so long been the most distressing 
features of the tribes of Arabia and brought such 
shame upon them when &amp;Muhammad arose to proclaim His 
Message in their midst; the indescribable state of decadence, 
with its attendant corruption, confusion, intolerance, and 
oppression, in both the civil and religious life of Persia, so 
graphically portrayed by the pen of a considerable number 
of scholars, diplomats, and travelers, at the hour of the Revelation 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah--all demonstrate this basic and inescapable 
fact.  To contend that the innate worthiness, the 
high moral standard, the political aptitude, and social attainments 
of any race or nation is the reason for the appearance 
in its midst of any of these Divine Luminaries would be 
an absolute perversion of historical facts, and would 
amount to a complete repudiation of the undoubted interpretation 
placed upon them, so clearly and emphatically, by 
both &amp;Baha'u'llah and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
     How great, then, must be the challenge to those who, 
belonging to such races and nations, and having responded 
to the call which these Prophets have raised, to unreservedly 
recognize and courageously testify to this indubitable truth, 
that not by reason of any racial superiority, political capacity, 
or spiritual virtue which a race or nation might possess, 
but rather as a direct consequence of its crying needs, its lamentable 
 
+P18 
degeneracy, and irremediable perversity, has the 
Prophet of God chosen to appear in its midst, and with it as 
a lever has lifted the entire human race to a higher and nobler 
plane of life and conduct.  For it is precisely under such 
circumstances, and by such means that the Prophets have, 
from time immemorial, chosen and were able to demonstrate 
their redemptive power to raise from the depths of 
abasement and of misery, the people of their own race and 
nation, empowering them to transmit in turn to other races 
and nations the saving grace and the energizing influence of 
their Revelation.  
     In the light of this fundamental principle it should always 
be borne in mind, nor can it be sufficiently emphasized, 
that the primary reason why the &amp;Bab and &amp;Baha'u'llah 
chose to appear in Persia, and to make it the first repository 
of their Revelation, was because, of all the peoples and nations 
of the civilized world, that race and nation had, as so 
often depicted by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, sunk to such ignominious 
depths, and manifested so great a perversity, as to find no 
parallel among its contemporaries.  For no more convincing 
proof could be adduced demonstrating the regenerating 
spirit animating the Revelations proclaimed by the &amp;Bab and 
&amp;Baha'u'llah than their power to transform what can be truly 
regarded as one of the most backward, the most cowardly, 
and perverse of peoples into a race of heroes, fit to effect in 
turn a similar revolution in the life of mankind.  To have appeared 
among a race or nation which by its intrinsic worth 
and high attainments seemed to warrant the inestimable 
privilege of being made the receptacle of such a Revelation 
would in the eyes of an unbelieving world greatly reduce 
the efficacy of that Message, and detract from the self-sufficiency 
of its omnipotent power.  The contrast so strikingly 
presented in the pages of &amp;Nabil's Narrative between the 
heroism that immortalized the life and deeds of the Dawn-Breakers 
and the degeneracy and cowardice of their defamers 
and persecutors is in itself a most impressive testimony 
to the truth of the Message of Him Who had instilled such a 
 
+P19 
spirit into the breasts of His disciples.  For any believer of 
that race to maintain that the excellence of his country and 
the innate nobility of its people were the fundamental reasons 
for its being singled out as the primary receptacle of the 
Revelations of the &amp;Bab and &amp;Baha'u'llah would be untenable 
in the face of the overwhelming evidence afforded so convincingly 
by that Narrative.  
     To a lesser degree this principle must of necessity apply 
to the country which has vindicated its right to be regarded 
as the cradle of the World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  So great a 
function, so noble a role, can be regarded as no less inferior 
to the part played by those immortal souls who, through 
their sublime renunciation and unparalleled deeds, have 
been responsible for the birth of the Faith itself.  Let not, 
therefore, those who are to participate so predominantly in 
the birth of that world civilization, which is the direct offspring 
of their Faith, imagine for a moment that for some 
mysterious purpose or by any reason of inherent excellence 
or special merit &amp;Baha'u'llah has chosen to confer upon their 
country and people so great and lasting a distinction.  It is 
precisely by reason of the patent evils which, notwithstanding 
its other admittedly great characteristics and achievements, 
an excessive and binding materialism has unfortunately 
engendered within it that the Author of their Faith 
and the Center of His Covenant have singled it out to become 
the standard-bearer of the New World Order envisaged 
in their writings.  It is by such means as this that &amp;Baha'u'llah 
can best demonstrate to a heedless generation His 
almighty power to raise up from the very midst of a people, 
immersed in a sea of materialism, a prey to one of the most 
virulent and long-standing forms of racial prejudice, and 
notorious for its political corruption, lawlessness and laxity 
in moral standards, men and women who, as time goes by, 
will increasingly exemplify those essential virtues of self-renunciation, 
of moral rectitude, of chastity, of indiscriminating 
fellowship, of holy discipline, and of spiritual insight 
that will fit them for the preponderating share they will 
 
+P20 
have in calling into being that World Order and that World 
Civilization of which their country, no less than the entire 
human race, stands in desperate need.  Theirs will be the 
duty and privilege, in their capacity first as the establishers 
of one of the most powerful pillars sustaining the edifice of 
the Universal House of Justice, and then as the champion-builders 
of that New World Order of which that House is to 
be the nucleus and forerunner, to inculcate, demonstrate, 
and apply those twin and sorely needed principles of Divine 
justice and order--principles to which the political corruption 
and the moral license, increasingly staining the society 
to which they belong, offer so sad and striking a contrast.  
     Observations such as these, however distasteful and 
depressing they may be, should not, in the least, blind us to 
those virtues and qualities of high intelligence, of youthfulness, 
of unbounded initiative, and enterprise which the nation 
as a whole so conspicuously displays, and which are 
being increasingly reflected by the community of the believers 
within it.  Upon these virtues and qualities, no less than 
upon the elimination of the evils referred to, must depend, 
to a very great extent, the ability of that community to lay a 
firm foundation for the country's future role in ushering in 
the Golden Age of the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     How great, therefore, how staggering the responsibility 
that must weigh upon the present generation of the American 
believers, at this early stage in their spiritual and administrative 
evolution, to weed out, by every means in their 
power, those faults, habits, and tendencies which they have 
inherited from their own nation, and to cultivate, patiently 
and prayerfully, those distinctive qualities and characteristics 
that are so indispensable to their effective participation 
in the great redemptive work of their Faith.  Incapable as yet, 
in view of the restricted size of their community and the limited 
influence it now wields, of producing any marked effect 
on the great mass of their countrymen, let them focus their 
attention, for the present, on their own selves, their own individual 
needs, their own personal deficiencies and weaknesses, 
 
+P21 
ever mindful that every intensification of effort on 
their part will better equip them for the time when they will 
be called upon to eradicate in their turn such evil tendencies 
from the lives and the hearts of the entire body of their fellow-citizens.  
Nor must they overlook the fact that the World 
Order, whose basis they, as the advance-guard of the future 
&amp;Baha'i generations of their countrymen, are now laboring to 
establish, can never be reared unless and until the generality 
of the people to which they belong has been already purged 
from the divers ills, whether social or political, that now so 
severely afflict it.  
     Surveying as a whole the most pressing needs of this 
community, attempting to estimate the more serious deficiencies 
by which it is being handicapped in the discharge of 
its task, and ever bearing in mind the nature of that still 
greater task with which it will be forced to wrestle in the 
future, I feel it my duty to lay special stress upon, and draw 
the special and urgent attention of the entire body of the 
American believers, be they young or old, white or colored, 
teachers or administrators, veterans or newcomers, to what I 
firmly believe are the essential requirements for the success 
of the tasks which are now claiming their undivided attention.  
Great as is the importance of fashioning the outward 
instruments, and of perfecting the administrative agencies, 
which they can utilize for the prosecution of their dual task 
under the Seven Year Plan; vital and urgent as are the campaigns 
which they are initiating, the schemes and projects 
which they are devising, and the funds which they are raising, 
for the efficient conduct of both the Teaching and Temple 
work, the imponderable, the spiritual, factors, which are 
bound up with their own individual and inner lives, and 
with which are associated their human and social relationships, 
are no less urgent and vital, and demand constant 
scrutiny, continual self-examination and heart-searching on 
their part, lest their value be impaired or their vital necessity 
be obscured or forgotten.  
     Of these spiritual prerequisites of success, which constitute 
 
+P22 
the bedrock on which the security of all teaching 
plans, Temple projects, and financial schemes, must ultimately 
rest, the following stand out as preeminent and vital, 
which the members of the American &amp;Baha'i community will 
do well to ponder.  Upon the extent to which these basic requirements 
are met, and the manner in which the American 
believers fulfill them in their individual lives, administrative 
activities, and social relationships, must depend the measure 
of the manifold blessings which the All-Bountiful Possessor 
can vouchsafe to them all.  These requirements are none 
other than a high sense of moral rectitude in their social and 
administrative activities, absolute chastity in their individual 
lives, and complete freedom from prejudice in their dealings 
with peoples of a different race, class, creed, or color.  
     The first is specially, though not exclusively, directed to 
their elected representatives, whether local, regional, or national, 
who, in their capacity as the custodians and members 
of the nascent institutions of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, are 
shouldering the chief responsibility in laying an unassailable 
foundation for that Universal House of Justice which, 
as its title implies, is to be the exponent and guardian of that 
Divine Justice which can alone insure the security of, and 
establish the reign of law and order in, a strangely disordered 
world.  The second is mainly and directly concerned 
with the &amp;Baha'i youth, who can contribute so decisively to 
the virility, the purity, and the driving force of the life of the 
&amp;Baha'i community, and upon whom must depend the future 
orientation of its destiny, and the complete unfoldment of 
the potentialities with which God has endowed it.  The third 
should be the immediate, the universal, and the chief concern 
of all and sundry members of the &amp;Baha'i community, of 
whatever age, rank, experience, class, or color, as all, with 
no exception, must face its challenging implications, and 
none can claim, however much he may have progressed 
along this line, to have completely discharged the stern responsibilities 
which it inculcates.  
 
+P23 
     A rectitude of conduct, an abiding sense of undeviating 
justice, unobscured by the demoralizing influences which a 
corruption-ridden political life so strikingly manifests; a 
chaste, pure, and holy life, unsullied and unclouded by the 
indecencies, the vices, the false standards, which an inherently 
deficient moral code tolerates, perpetuates, and fosters; 
a fraternity freed from that cancerous growth of racial 
prejudice, which is eating into the vitals of an already debilitated 
society--these are the ideals which the American believers 
must, from now on, individually and through concerted 
action, strive to promote, in both their private and 
public lives, ideals which are the chief propelling forces that 
can most effectively accelerate the march of their institutions, 
plans, and enterprises, that can guard the honor and 
integrity of their Faith, and subdue any obstacles that may 
confront it in the future.  
     This rectitude of conduct, with its implications of justice, 
equity, truthfulness, honesty, fair-mindedness, reliability, 
and trustworthiness, must distinguish every phase of the 
life of the &amp;Baha'i community.  "The companions of God," &amp;Baha'u'llah 
Himself has declared, "are, in this day, the lump that 
must leaven the peoples of the world.  They must show forth such 
trustworthiness, such truthfulness and perseverance, such deeds 
and character that all mankind may profit by their example."  "I 
swear by Him Who is the Most Great Ocean!" He again affirms, 
"Within the very breath of such souls as are pure and sanctified 
far-reaching potentialities are hidden.  So great are these potentialities 
that they exercise their influence upon all created things."  "He 
is the true servant of God," He, in another passage has written, 
"who, in this day, were he to pass through cities of silver and gold, 
would not deign to look upon them, and whose heart would remain 
pure and undefiled from whatever things can be seen in this world, 
be they its goods or its treasures.  I swear by the Sun of Truth!  The 
breath of such a man is endowed with potency, and his words with 
attraction."  "By Him Who shineth above the Dayspring of sanctity!"  
He, still more emphatically, has revealed, "If the whole 
 
+P24 
earth were to be converted into silver and gold, no man who can be 
said to have truly ascended into the heaven of faith and certitude 
would deign to regard it, much less to seize and keep it....  They 
who dwell within the Tabernacle of God, and are established upon 
the seats of everlasting glory, will refuse, though they be dying of 
hunger, to stretch their hands, and seize unlawfully the property of 
their neighbor, however vile and worthless he may be.  The purpose 
of the one true God in manifesting Himself is to summon all mankind 
to truthfulness and sincerity, to piety and trustworthiness, to 
resignation and submissiveness to the will of God, to forbearance 
and kindliness, to uprightness and wisdom.  His object is to array 
every man with the mantle of a saintly character, and to adorn him 
with the ornament of holy and goodly deeds."  "We have admonished 
all the loved ones of God," He insists, "to take heed lest the 
hem of Our sacred vesture be smirched with the mire of unlawful 
deeds, or be stained with the dust of reprehensible conduct."  
"Cleave unto righteousness, O people of &amp;Baha," He thus exhorts 
them, "This, verily, is the commandment which this wronged One 
hath given unto you, and the first choice of His unrestrained will 
for every one of you."  "A good character," He explains, "is, verily, 
the best mantle for men from God.  With it He adorneth the temples 
of His loved ones.  By My life!  The light of a good character surpasseth 
the light of the sun and the radiance thereof."  "One righteous 
act," He, again, has written, "is endowed with a potency that 
can so elevate the dust as to cause it to pass beyond the heaven of 
heavens.  It can tear every bond asunder, and hath the power to 
restore the force that hath spent itself and vanished....  Be pure, 
O people of God, be pure; be righteous, be righteous....  Say:  O 
people of God!  That which can insure the victory of Him Who is 
the Eternal Truth, His hosts and helpers on earth, have been set 
down in the sacred Books and Scriptures, and are as clear and 
manifest as the sun.  These hosts are such righteous deeds, such 
conduct and character, as are acceptable in His sight.  Whoso ariseth, 
in this Day, to aid Our Cause, and summoneth to his assistance 
the hosts of a praiseworthy character and upright conduct, 
the influence from such an action will, most certainly, be diffused 
throughout the whole world."  "The betterment of the world," is 
 
+P25 
yet another statement, "can be accomplished through pure and 
goodly deeds, through commendable and seemly conduct."  "Be fair 
to yourselves and to others," He thus counseleth them, "that 
the evidences of justice may be revealed through your deeds among 
Our faithful servants."  "Equity," He also has written, "is the 
most fundamental among human virtues.  The evaluation of all 
things must needs depend upon it."  And again, "Observe equity 
in your judgment, ye men of understanding heart!  He that is unjust 
in his judgment is destitute of the characteristics that distinguish 
man's station."  "Beautify your tongues, O people," He further 
admonishes them, "with truthfulness, and adorn your souls with 
the ornament of honesty.  Beware, O people, that ye deal not 
treacherously with anyone.  Be ye the trustees of God amongst His 
creatures, and the emblems of His generosity amidst His people."  
"Let your eye be chaste," is yet another counsel, "your hand 
faithful, your tongue truthful, and your heart enlightened."  "Be an 
ornament to the countenance of truth," is yet another admonition, 
"a crown to the brow of fidelity, a pillar of the temple of 
righteousness, a breath of life to the body of mankind, an ensign of 
the hosts of justice, a luminary above the horizon of virtue."  "Let 
truthfulness and courtesy be your adorning," is still another admonition; 
"suffer not yourselves to be deprived of the robe of forbearance 
and justice, that the sweet savors of holiness may be 
wafted from your hearts upon all created things.  Say:  Beware, O 
people of &amp;Baha, lest ye walk in the ways of them whose words differ 
from their deeds.  Strive that ye may be enabled to manifest to the 
peoples of the earth the signs of God, and to mirror forth His commandments.  
Let your acts be a guide unto all mankind, for the professions 
of most men, be they high or low, differ from their conduct.  
It is through your deeds that ye can distinguish yourselves from 
others.  Through them the brightness of your light can be shed upon 
the whole earth.  Happy is the man that heedeth My counsel, and 
keepeth the precepts prescribed by Him Who is the All-Knowing, 
the All-Wise."  
     "O army of God!" writes &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, "Through the protection 
and help vouchsafed by the Blessed Beauty--may my life 
be a sacrifice to His loved ones--ye must conduct yourselves in 
 
+P26 
such a manner that ye may stand out distinguished and brilliant as 
the sun among other souls.  Should any one of you enter a city, he 
should become a center of attraction by reason of his sincerity, his 
faithfulness and love, his honesty and fidelity, his truthfulness and 
loving-kindness towards all the peoples of the world, so that the 
people of that city may cry out and say:  `This man is unquestionably 
a &amp;Baha'i, for his manners, his behavior, his conduct, his morals, 
his nature, and disposition reflect the attributes of the &amp;Baha'is.'  
Not until ye attain this station can ye be said to have been faithful 
to the Covenant and Testament of God."  "The most vital duty, in 
this day," He, moreover, has written, "is to purify your characters, 
to correct your manners, and improve your conduct.  The beloved 
of the Merciful must show forth such character and conduct 
among His creatures, that the fragrance of their holiness may be 
shed upon the whole world, and may quicken the dead, inasmuch 
as the purpose of the Manifestation of God and the dawning of the 
limitless lights of the Invisible is to educate the souls of men, and 
refine the character of every living man...."  "Truthfulness," He 
asserts, "is the foundation of all human virtues.  Without truthfulness 
progress and success, in all the worlds of God, are impossible 
for any soul.  When this holy attribute is established in man, all the 
divine qualities will also be acquired."  
     Such a rectitude of conduct must manifest itself, with 
ever-increasing potency, in every verdict which the elected 
representatives of the &amp;Baha'i community, in whatever capacity 
they may find themselves, may be called upon to pronounce.  
It must be constantly reflected in the business dealings 
of all its members, in their domestic lives, in all manner 
of employment, and in any service they may, in the future, 
render their government or people.  It must be exemplified in 
the conduct of all &amp;Baha'i electors, when exercising their sacred 
rights and functions.  It must characterize the attitude of 
every loyal believer towards nonacceptance of political 
posts, nonidentification with political parties, nonparticipation 
in political controversies, and nonmembership in political 
organizations and ecclesiastical institutions.  It must reveal 
itself in the uncompromising adherence of all, whether 
 
+P27 
young or old, to the clearly enunciated and fundamental 
principles laid down by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in His addresses, and 
to the laws and ordinances revealed by &amp;Baha'u'llah in His 
Most Holy Book.  It must be demonstrated in the impartiality 
of every defender of the Faith against its enemies, in his fair-mindedness 
in recognizing any merits that enemy may possess, 
and in his honesty in discharging any obligations he 
may have towards him.  It must constitute the brightest ornament 
of the life, the pursuits, the exertions, and the utterances 
of every &amp;Baha'i teacher, whether laboring at home or 
abroad, whether in the front ranks of the teaching force, or 
occupying a less active and responsible position.  It must be 
made the hallmark of that numerically small, yet intensely 
dynamic and highly responsible body of the elected national 
representatives of every &amp;Baha'i community, which constitutes 
the sustaining pillar, and the sole instrument for the 
election, in every community, of that Universal House 
whose very name and title, as ordained by &amp;Baha'u'llah, symbolizes 
that rectitude of conduct which is its highest mission 
to safeguard and enforce.  
     So great and transcendental is this principle of Divine 
justice, a principle that must be regarded as the crowning 
distinction of all Local and National Assemblies, in their capacity 
as forerunners of the Universal House of Justice, that 
&amp;Baha'u'llah Himself subordinates His personal inclination 
and wish to the all-compelling force of its demands and implications.  
"God is My witness!"  He thus explains, "were it not 
contrary to the Law of God, I would have kissed the hand of My 
would-be murderer, and would cause him to inherit My earthly 
goods.  I am restrained, however, by the binding Law laid down in 
the Book, and am Myself bereft of all worldly possessions."  "Know 
thou, of a truth," He significantly affirms, "these great oppressions 
that have befallen the world are preparing it for the advent of 
the Most Great Justice."  "Say," He again asserts, "He hath appeared 
with that Justice wherewith mankind hath been adorned, 
and yet the people are, for the most part, asleep."  "The light of men 
is Justice," He moreover states, "Quench it not with the contrary 
 
+P28 
winds of oppression and tyranny.  The purpose of justice is the appearance 
of unity among men."  "No radiance," He declares, "can 
compare with that of justice.  The organization of the world and the 
tranquillity of mankind depend upon it."  "O people of God!"  He 
exclaims, "That which traineth the world is Justice, for it is upheld 
by two pillars, reward and punishment.  These two pillars are 
the sources of life to the world."  "Justice and equity," is yet another 
assertion, "are two guardians for the protection of man.  
They have appeared arrayed in their mighty and sacred names to 
maintain the world in uprightness and protect the nations."  "Bestir 
yourselves, O people," is His emphatic warning, "in anticipation 
of the days of Divine justice, for the promised hour is now 
come.  Beware lest ye fail to apprehend its import, and be accounted 
among the erring."  "The day is approaching," He similarly has 
written, "when the faithful will behold the daystar of justice shining 
in its full splendor from the dayspring of glory."  "The shame I 
was made to bear," He significantly remarks, "hath uncovered 
the glory with which the whole of creation had been invested, and 
through the cruelties I have endured, the daystar of justice hath 
manifested itself, and shed its splendor upon men."  "The world," 
He again has written, "is in great turmoil, and the minds of its 
people are in a state of utter confusion.  We entreat the Almighty 
that He may graciously illuminate them with the glory of His Justice, 
and enable them to discover that which will be profitable unto 
them at all times and under all conditions."  And again, "There 
can be no doubt whatever that if the daystar of justice, which the 
clouds of tyranny have obscured, were to shed its light upon men, 
the face of the earth would be completely transformed."  
     "God be praised!" &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, in His turn, exclaims, 
"The sun of justice hath risen above the horizon of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  For 
in His Tablets the foundations of such a justice have been laid as 
no mind hath, from the beginning of creation, conceived."  "The 
canopy of existence," He further explains, "resteth upon the pole 
of justice, and not of forgiveness, and the life of mankind dependeth 
on justice and not on forgiveness."  
     Small wonder, therefore, that the Author of the &amp;Baha'i 
Revelation should have chosen to associate the name and 
 
+P29 
title of that House, which is to be the crowning glory of His 
administrative institutions, not with forgiveness but with 
justice, to have made justice the only basis and the permanent 
foundation of His Most Great Peace, and to have proclaimed 
it in His Hidden Words as "the best beloved of all 
things" in His sight.  It is to the American believers, particularly, 
that I feel urged to direct this fervent plea to ponder in 
their hearts the implications of this moral rectitude, and to 
uphold, with heart and soul and uncompromisingly, both 
individually and collectively, this sublime standard--a standard 
of which justice is so essential and potent an element.  
     As to a chaste and holy life, it should be regarded as no 
less essential a factor that must contribute its proper share to 
the strengthening and vitalization of the &amp;Baha'i community, 
upon which must in turn depend the success of any &amp;Baha'i 
plan or enterprise.  In these days when the forces of irreligion 
are weakening the moral fiber, and undermining the 
foundations of individual morality, the obligation of chastity 
and holiness must claim an increasing share of the attention 
of the American believers, both in their individual 
capacities and as the responsible custodians of the interests 
of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  In the discharge of such an obligation, 
to which the special circumstances resulting from an 
excessive and enervating materialism now prevailing in 
their country lend particular significance, they must play a 
conspicuous and predominant role.  All of them, be they 
men or women, must, at this threatening hour when the 
lights of religion are fading out, and its restraints are one by 
one being abolished, pause to examine themselves, scrutinize 
their conduct, and with characteristic resolution arise to 
purge the life of their community of every trace of moral 
laxity that might stain the name, or impair the integrity, of 
so holy and precious a Faith.  
     A chaste and holy life must be made the controlling 
principle in the behavior and conduct of all &amp;Baha'is, both in 
their social relations with the members of their own community, 
and in their contact with the world at large.  It must 
 
+P30 
adorn and reinforce the ceaseless labors and meritorious exertions 
of those whose enviable position is to propagate the 
Message, and to administer the affairs, of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
It must be upheld, in all its integrity and implications, 
in every phase of the life of those who fill the ranks of that 
Faith, whether in their homes, their travels, their clubs, their 
societies, their entertainments, their schools, and their universities.  
It must be accorded special consideration in the 
conduct of the social activities of every &amp;Baha'i summer 
school and any other occasions on which &amp;Baha'i community 
life is organized and fostered.  It must be closely and continually 
identified with the mission of the &amp;Baha'i youth, both as 
an element in the life of the &amp;Baha'i community, and as a factor 
in the future progress and orientation of the youth of 
their own country.  
     Such a chaste and holy life, with its implications of 
modesty, purity, temperance, decency, and clean-mindedness, 
involves no less than the exercise of moderation in all 
that pertains to dress, language, amusements, and all artistic 
and literary avocations.  It demands daily vigilance in the 
control of one's carnal desires and corrupt inclinations.  It 
calls for the abandonment of a frivolous conduct, with its 
excessive attachment to trivial and often misdirected pleasures.  
It requires total abstinence from all alcoholic drinks, 
from opium, and from similar habit-forming drugs.  It condemns 
the prostitution of art and of literature, the practices 
of nudism and of companionate marriage, infidelity in marital 
relationships, and all manner of promiscuity, of easy familiarity, 
and of sexual vices.  It can tolerate no compromise 
with the theories, the standards, the habits, and the excesses 
of a decadent age.  Nay rather it seeks to demonstrate, 
through the dynamic force of its example, the pernicious 
character of such theories, the falsity of such standards, the 
hollowness of such claims, the perversity of such habits, and 
the sacrilegious character of such excesses.  
     "By the righteousness of God!" writes &amp;Baha'u'llah, "The 
world, its vanities and its glory, and whatever delights it can offer, 
 
+P31 
are all, in the sight of God, as worthless as, nay even more contemptible 
than, dust and ashes.  Would that the hearts of men could 
comprehend it.  Wash yourselves thoroughly, O people of &amp;Baha, 
from the defilement of the world, and of all that pertaineth unto it.  
God Himself beareth Me witness!  The things of the earth ill beseem 
you.  Cast them away unto such as may desire them, and fasten 
your eyes upon this most holy and effulgent Vision."  "O ye My 
loved ones!" He thus exhorts His followers, "Suffer not the hem 
of My sacred vesture to be smirched and mired with the things of 
this world, and follow not the promptings of your evil and corrupt 
desires."  And again, "O ye the beloved of the one true God!  Pass 
beyond the narrow retreats of your evil and corrupt desires, and 
advance into the vast immensity of the realm of God, and abide ye 
in the meads of sanctity and of detachment, that the fragrance of 
your deeds may lead the whole of mankind to the ocean of God's 
unfading glory."  "Disencumber yourselves," He thus commands 
them, "of all attachment to this world and the vanities thereof.  
Beware that ye approach them not, inasmuch as they prompt you 
to walk after your own lusts and covetous desires, and hinder you 
from entering the straight and glorious Path."  "Eschew all manner 
of wickedness," is His commandment, "for such things are forbidden 
unto you in the Book which none touch except such as God 
hath cleansed from every taint of guilt, and numbered among the 
purified."  "A race of men," is His written promise, "incomparable 
in character, shall be raised up which, with the feet of detachment, 
will tread under all who are in heaven and on earth, and 
will cast the sleeve of holiness over all that hath been created from 
water and clay."  "The civilization," is His grave warning, "so 
often vaunted by the learned exponents of arts and sciences, will, if 
allowed to overleap the bounds of moderation, bring great evil 
upon men....  If carried to excess, civilization will prove as prolific 
a source of evil as it had been of goodness when kept within the 
restraints of moderation."  "He hath chosen out of the whole world 
the hearts of His servants," He explains, "and made them each a 
seat for the revelation of His glory.  Wherefore, sanctify them from 
every defilement, that the things for which they were created may 
be engraven upon them.  This indeed is a token of God's bountiful 
 
+P32 
favor."  "Say," He proclaims, "He is not to be numbered with the 
people of &amp;Baha who followeth his mundane desires, or fixeth his 
heart on things of the earth.  He is My true follower who, if he come 
to a valley of pure gold will pass straight through it aloof as a 
cloud, and will neither turn back, nor pause.  Such a man is assuredly 
of Me.  From his garment the Concourse on high can inhale 
the fragrance of sanctity....  And if he met the fairest and most 
comely of women, he would not feel his heart seduced by the least 
shadow of desire for her beauty.  Such an one indeed is the creation 
of spotless chastity.  Thus instructeth you the Pen of the Ancient of 
Days, as bidden by your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful."  
"They that follow their lusts and corrupt inclinations," is yet another 
warning, "have erred and dissipated their efforts.  They indeed 
are of the lost."  "It behooveth the people of &amp;Baha," He also 
has written, "to die to the world and all that is therein, to be so 
detached from all earthly things that the inmates of Paradise may 
inhale from their garment the sweet smelling savor of sanctity....  
They that have tarnished the fair name of the Cause of God by 
following the things of the flesh--these are in palpable error!"  
"Purity and chastity," He particularly admonishes, "have been, 
and still are, the most great ornaments for the handmaidens of 
God.  God is My Witness!  The brightness of the light of chastity 
sheddeth its illumination upon the worlds of the spirit, and its fragrance 
is wafted even unto the Most Exalted Paradise."  "God," He 
again affirms, "hath verily made chastity to be a crown for the 
heads of His handmaidens.  Great is the blessedness of that handmaiden 
that hath attained unto this great station."  "We, verily, 
have decreed in Our Book," is His assurance, "a goodly and 
bountiful reward to whosoever will turn away from wickedness, 
and lead a chaste and godly life.  He, in truth, is the Great Giver, 
the All-Bountiful."  "We have sustained the weight of all calamities," 
He testifies, "to sanctify you from all earthly corruption and 
ye are yet indifferent....  We, verily, behold your actions.  If We 
perceive from them the sweet smelling savor of purity and holiness, 
We will most certainly bless you.  Then will the tongues of the 
inmates of Paradise utter your praise and magnify your names 
amidst them who have drawn nigh unto God."  
 
+P33 
     "The drinking of wine," writes &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, "is, according 
to the text of the Most Holy Book, forbidden; for it is the cause 
of chronic diseases, weakeneth the nerves, and consumeth the 
mind."  "Drink ye, O handmaidens of God," &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself 
has affirmed, "the Mystic Wine from the cup of My words.  Cast 
away, then, from you that which your minds abhor, for it hath 
been forbidden unto you in His Tablets and His Scriptures.  Beware 
lest ye barter away the River that is life indeed for that which the 
souls of the pure-hearted detest.  Become ye intoxicated with the 
wine of the love of God, and not with that which deadeneth your 
minds, O ye that adore Him!  Verily, it hath been forbidden unto 
every believer, whether man or woman.  Thus hath the sun of My 
commandment shone forth above the horizon of My utterance, that 
the handmaidens who believe in Me may be illumined."  
     It must be remembered, however, that the maintenance 
of such a high standard of moral conduct is not to be 
associated or confused with any form of asceticism, or of excessive 
and bigoted puritanism.  The standard inculcated by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah seeks, under no circumstances, to deny anyone 
the legitimate right and privilege to derive the fullest advantage 
and benefit from the manifold joys, beauties, and pleasures 
with which the world has been so plentifully enriched 
by an All-Loving Creator.  "Should a man," &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself 
reassures us, "wish to adorn himself with the ornaments of 
the earth, to wear its apparels, or partake of the benefits it can 
bestow, no harm can befall him, if he alloweth nothing whatever to 
intervene between him and God, for God hath ordained every good 
thing, whether created in the heavens or in the earth, for such of 
His servants as truly believe in Him.  Eat ye, O people, of the good 
things which God hath allowed you, and deprive not yourselves 
from His wondrous bounties.  Render thanks and praise unto Him, 
and be of them that are truly thankful."  
     As to racial prejudice, the corrosion of which, for well-nigh 
a century, has bitten into the fiber, and attacked the 
whole social structure of American society, it should be regarded 
as constituting the most vital and challenging issue 
confronting the &amp;Baha'i community at the present stage of its 
 
+P34 
evolution.  The ceaseless exertions which this issue of paramount 
importance calls for, the sacrifices it must impose, 
the care and vigilance it demands, the moral courage and 
fortitude it requires, the tact and sympathy it necessitates, 
invest this problem, which the American believers are still 
far from having satisfactorily resolved, with an urgency and 
importance that cannot be overestimated.  White and Negro, 
high and low, young and old, whether newly converted to 
the Faith or not, all who stand identified with it must participate 
in, and lend their assistance, each according to his or 
her capacity, experience, and opportunities, to the common 
task of fulfilling the instructions, realizing the hopes, and 
following the example, of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  Whether colored or 
noncolored, neither race has the right, or can conscientiously 
claim, to be regarded as absolved from such an obligation, as 
having realized such hopes, or having faithfully followed 
such an example.  A long and thorny road, beset with pitfalls, 
still remains untraveled, both by the white and the Negro 
exponents of the redeeming Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  On the 
distance they cover, and the manner in which they travel 
that road, must depend, to an extent which few among 
them can imagine, the operation of those intangible influences 
which are indispensable to the spiritual triumph of the 
American believers and the material success of their newly 
launched enterprise.  
     Let them call to mind, fearlessly and determinedly, the 
example and conduct of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha while in their midst.  
Let them remember His courage, His genuine love, His informal 
and indiscriminating fellowship, His contempt for 
and impatience of criticism, tempered by His tact and wisdom.  
Let them revive and perpetuate the memory of those 
unforgettable and historic episodes and occasions on which 
He so strikingly demonstrated His keen sense of justice, His 
spontaneous sympathy for the downtrodden, His ever-abiding 
sense of the oneness of the human race, His overflowing 
love for its members, and His displeasure with 
 
+P35 
those who dared to flout His wishes, to deride His methods, 
to challenge His principles, or to nullify His acts.  
     To discriminate against any race, on the ground of its 
being socially backward, politically immature, and numerically 
in a minority, is a flagrant violation of the spirit that 
animates the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  The consciousness of any 
division or cleavage in its ranks is alien to its very purpose, 
principles, and ideals.  Once its members have fully recognized 
the claim of its Author, and, by identifying themselves 
with its Administrative Order, accepted unreservedly the 
principles and laws embodied in its teachings, every differentiation 
of class, creed, or color must automatically be obliterated, 
and never be allowed, under any pretext, and however 
great the pressure of events or of public opinion, to 
reassert itself.  If any discrimination is at all to be tolerated, it 
should be a discrimination not against, but rather in favor of 
the minority, be it racial or otherwise.  Unlike the nations and 
peoples of the earth, be they of the East or of the West, democratic 
or authoritarian, communist or capitalist, whether belonging 
to the Old World or the New, who either ignore, 
trample upon, or extirpate, the racial, religious, or political 
minorities within the sphere of their jurisdiction, every organized 
community enlisted under the banner of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
should feel it to be its first and inescapable obligation to 
nurture, encourage, and safeguard every minority belonging 
to any faith, race, class, or nation within it.  So great and 
vital is this principle that in such circumstances, as when an 
equal number of ballots have been cast in an election, or 
where the qualifications for any office are balanced as between 
the various races, faiths or nationalities within the 
community, priority should unhesitatingly be accorded the 
party representing the minority, and this for no other reason 
except to stimulate and encourage it, and afford it an opportunity 
to further the interests of the community.  In the light 
of this principle, and bearing in mind the extreme desirability 
of having the minority elements participate and share responsibility 
 
+P36 
in the conduct of &amp;Baha'i activity, it should be 
the duty of every &amp;Baha'i community so to arrange its affairs 
that in cases where individuals belonging to the divers minority 
elements within it are already qualified and fulfill the 
necessary requirements, &amp;Baha'i representative institutions, 
be they Assemblies, conventions, conferences, or committees, 
may have represented on them as many of these divers 
elements, racial or otherwise, as possible.  The adoption of 
such a course, and faithful adherence to it, would not only 
be a source of inspiration and encouragement to those elements 
that are numerically small and inadequately represented, 
but would demonstrate to the world at large the universality 
and representative character of the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, and the freedom of His followers from the taint 
of those prejudices which have already wrought such havoc 
in the domestic affairs, as well as the foreign relationships, 
of the nations.  
     Freedom from racial prejudice, in any of its forms, 
should, at such a time as this when an increasingly large section 
of the human race is falling a victim to its devastating 
ferocity, be adopted as the watchword of the entire body of 
the American believers, in whichever state they reside, in 
whatever circles they move, whatever their age, traditions, 
tastes, and habits.  It should be consistently demonstrated in 
every phase of their activity and life, whether in the &amp;Baha'i 
community or outside it, in public or in private, formally as 
well as informally, individually as well as in their official capacity 
as organized groups, committees and Assemblies.  It 
should be deliberately cultivated through the various and 
everyday opportunities, no matter how insignificant, that 
present themselves, whether in their homes, their business 
offices, their schools and colleges, their social parties and 
recreation grounds, their &amp;Baha'i meetings, conferences, conventions, 
summer schools and Assemblies.  It should, above 
all else, become the keynote of the policy of that august 
body which, in its capacity as the national representative, 
and the director and coordinator of the affairs of the community, 
 
+P37 
must set the example, and facilitate the application 
of such a vital principle to the lives and activities of those 
whose interests it safeguards and represents.  
     "O ye discerning ones!" &amp;Baha'u'llah has written, "Verily, 
the words which have descended from the heaven of the Will of 
God are the source of unity and harmony for the world.  Close your 
eyes to racial differences, and welcome all with the light of oneness."  
"We desire but the good of the world and the happiness of 
the nations," He proclaims, "...that all nations should become 
one in faith and all men as brothers; that the bonds of affection and 
unity between the sons of men should be strengthened; that diversity 
of religion should cease, and differences of race be annulled."  
"&amp;Baha'u'llah hath said," writes &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, "that the various 
races of humankind lend a composite harmony and beauty of color 
to the whole.  Let all associate, therefore, in this great human garden 
even as flowers grow and blend together side by side without 
discord or disagreement between them."  "&amp;Baha'u'llah," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
moreover has said, "once compared the colored people to 
the black pupil of the eye surrounded by the white.  In this black 
pupil is seen the reflection of that which is before it, and through it 
the light of the spirit shineth forth."  
     "God," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself declares, "maketh no distinction 
between the white and the black.  If the hearts are pure 
both are acceptable unto Him.  God is no respecter of persons on 
account of either color or race.  All colors are acceptable unto Him, 
be they white, black, or yellow.  Inasmuch as all were created in the 
image of God, we must bring ourselves to realize that all embody 
divine possibilities."  "In the estimation of God," He states, "all 
men are equal.  There is no distinction or preference for any soul, in 
the realm of His justice and equity."  "God did not make these divisions," 
He affirms; "these divisions have had their origin in man 
himself.  Therefore, as they are against the plan and purpose of God 
they are false and imaginary."  "In the estimation of God," He 
again affirms, "there is no distinction of color; all are one in the 
color and beauty of servitude to Him.  Color is not important; the 
heart is all-important.  It mattereth not what the exterior may be if 
the heart is pure and white within.  God doth not behold differences 
 
+P38 
of hue and complexion.  He looketh at the hearts.  He whose morals 
and virtues are praiseworthy is preferred in the presence of God; he 
who is devoted to the Kingdom is most beloved.  In the realm of 
genesis and creation the question of color is of least importance."  
"Throughout the animal kingdom," He explains, "we do not find 
the creatures separated because of color.  They recognize unity of 
species and oneness of kind.  If we do not find color distinction 
drawn in a kingdom of lower intelligence and reason, how can it be 
justified among human beings, especially when we know that all 
have come from the same source and belong to the same household?  
In origin and intention of creation mankind is one.  Distinctions 
of race and color have arisen afterward."  "Man is endowed 
with superior reasoning power and the faculty of perception"; He 
further explains, "he is the manifestation of divine bestowals.  
Shall racial ideas prevail and obscure the creative purpose of unity 
in his kingdom?"  "One of the important questions," He significantly 
remarks, "which affect the unity and the solidarity of 
mankind is the fellowship and equality of the white and colored 
races.  Between these two races certain points of agreement and 
points of distinction exist which warrant just and mutual consideration.  
The points of contact are many....  In this country, the 
United States of America, patriotism is common to both races; all 
have equal rights to citizenship, speak one language, receive the 
blessings of the same civilization, and follow the precepts of the 
same religion.  In fact numerous points of partnership and agreement 
exist between the two races, whereas the one point of distinction 
is that of color.  Shall this, the least of all distinctions, be allowed 
to separate you as races and individuals?"  "This variety in 
forms and coloring," He stresses, "which is manifest in all the 
kingdoms is according to creative Wisdom and hath a divine purpose."  
"The diversity in the human family," He claims, "should 
be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many 
different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord."  "If 
you meet," is His admonition, "those of a different race and color 
from yourself, do not mistrust them, and withdraw yourself into 
your shell of conventionality, but rather be glad and show them 
kindness."  "In the world of being," He testifies, "the meeting is 
 
+P39 
blessed when the white and colored races meet together with infinite 
spiritual love and heavenly harmony.  When such meetings are 
established, and the participants associate with each other with 
perfect love, unity and kindness, the angels of the Kingdom praise 
them, and the Beauty of &amp;Baha'u'llah addresseth them, `Blessed are 
ye!  Blessed are ye!'"  "When a gathering of these two races is 
brought about," He likewise asserts, "that assemblage will become 
the magnet of the Concourse on high, and the confirmation of 
the Blessed Beauty will surround it."  "Strive earnestly," He again 
exhorts both races, "and put forth your greatest endeavor toward 
the accomplishment of this fellowship and the cementing of this 
bond of brotherhood between you.  Such an attainment is not possible 
without will and effort on the part of each; from one, expressions 
of gratitude and appreciation; from the other, kindliness and 
recognition of equality.  Each one should endeavor to develop and 
assist the other toward mutual advancement....  Love and unity 
will be fostered between you, thereby bringing about the oneness of 
mankind.  For the accomplishment of unity between the colored 
and white will be an assurance of the world's peace."  "I hope," He 
thus addresses members of the white race, "that ye may cause 
that downtrodden race to become glorious, and to be joined with 
the white race, to serve the world of man with the utmost sincerity, 
faithfulness, love, and purity.  This opposition, enmity, and prejudice 
among the white race and the colored cannot be effaced except 
through faith, assurance, and the teachings of the Blessed Beauty."  
"This question of the union of the white and the black is very important," 
He warns, "for if it is not realized, erelong great difficulties 
will arise, and harmful results will follow."  "If this matter remaineth 
without change," is yet another warning, "enmity will 
be increased day by day, and the final result will be hardship and 
may end in bloodshed."  
     A tremendous effort is required by both races if their 
outlook, their manners, and conduct are to reflect, in this 
darkened age, the spirit and teachings of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
Casting away once and for all the fallacious doctrine 
of racial superiority, with all its attendant evils, confusion, 
and miseries, and welcoming and encouraging the intermixture 
 
+P40 
of races, and tearing down the barriers that now divide 
them, they should each endeavor, day and night, to fulfill 
their particular responsibilities in the common task which so 
urgently faces them.  Let them, while each is attempting to 
contribute its share to the solution of this perplexing problem, 
call to mind the warnings of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and visualize, 
while there is yet time, the dire consequences that must 
follow if this challenging and unhappy situation that faces 
the entire American nation is not definitely remedied.  
     Let the white make a supreme effort in their resolve to 
contribute their share to the solution of this problem, to 
abandon once for all their usually inherent and at times subconscious 
sense of superiority, to correct their tendency 
towards revealing a patronizing attitude towards the members 
of the other race, to persuade them through their intimate, 
spontaneous and informal association with them of 
the genuineness of their friendship and the sincerity of their 
intentions, and to master their impatience of any lack of responsiveness 
on the part of a people who have received, for 
so long a period, such grievous and slow-healing wounds.  
Let the Negroes, through a corresponding effort on their 
part, show by every means in their power the warmth of 
their response, their readiness to forget the past, and their 
ability to wipe out every trace of suspicion that may still linger 
in their hearts and minds.  Let neither think that the solution 
of so vast a problem is a matter that exclusively concerns 
the other.  Let neither think that such a problem can 
either easily or immediately be resolved.  Let neither think 
that they can wait confidently for the solution of this problem 
until the initiative has been taken, and the favorable circumstances 
created, by agencies that stand outside the orbit 
of their Faith.  Let neither think that anything short of genuine 
love, extreme patience, true humility, consummate tact, 
sound initiative, mature wisdom, and deliberate, persistent, 
and prayerful effort, can succeed in blotting out the stain 
which this patent evil has left on the fair name of their common 
country.  Let them rather believe, and be firmly convinced, 
 
+P41 
that on their mutual understanding, their amity, and 
sustained cooperation, must depend, more than on any other 
force or organization operating outside the circle of their 
Faith, the deflection of that dangerous course so greatly 
feared by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and the materialization of the 
hopes He cherished for their joint contribution to the fulfillment 
of that country's glorious destiny.  
     Dearly beloved friends!  A rectitude of conduct which, 
in all its manifestations, offers a striking contrast to the deceitfulness 
and corruption that characterize the political life 
of the nation and of the parties and factions that compose it; 
a holiness and chastity that are diametrically opposed to the 
moral laxity and licentiousness which defile the character of 
a not inconsiderable proportion of its citizens; an interracial 
fellowship completely purged from the curse of racial prejudice 
which stigmatizes the vast majority of its people--these 
are the weapons which the American believers can and 
must wield in their double crusade, first to regenerate the 
inward life of their own community, and next to assail the 
long-standing evils that have entrenched themselves in the 
life of their nation.  The perfection of such weapons, the 
wise and effective utilization of every one of them, more 
than the furtherance of any particular plan, or the devising 
of any special scheme, or the accumulation of any amount 
of material resources, can prepare them for the time when 
the Hand of Destiny will have directed them to assist in creating 
and in bringing into operation that World Order which 
is now incubating within the worldwide administrative institutions 
of their Faith.  
     In the conduct of this twofold crusade the valiant warriors 
struggling in the name and for the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
must, of necessity, encounter stiff resistance, and suffer 
many a setback.  Their own instincts, no less than the fury of 
conservative forces, the opposition of vested interests, and 
the objections of a corrupt and pleasure-seeking generation, 
must be reckoned with, resolutely resisted, and completely 
overcome.  As their defensive measures for the impending 
 
+P42 
struggle are organized and extended, storms of abuse and 
ridicule, and campaigns of condemnation and misrepresentation, 
may be unloosed against them.  Their Faith, they may 
soon find, has been assaulted, their motives misconstrued, 
their aims defamed, their aspirations derided, their institutions 
scorned, their influence belittled, their authority undermined, 
and their Cause, at times, deserted by a few who 
will either be incapable of appreciating the nature of their 
ideals, or unwilling to bear the brunt of the mounting criticisms 
which such a contest is sure to involve.  "Because of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha," the beloved Master has prophesied, "many a 
test will be visited upon you.  Troubles will befall you, and suffering 
afflict you."  
     Let not, however, the invincible army of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
who in the West, and at one of its potential storm centers is 
to fight, in His name and for His sake, one of its fiercest and 
most glorious battles, be afraid of any criticism that might be 
directed against it.  Let it not be deterred by any condemnation 
with which the tongue of the slanderer may seek to 
debase its motives.  Let it not recoil before the threatening 
advance of the forces of fanaticism, of orthodoxy, of corruption, 
and of prejudice that may be leagued against it.  The 
voice of criticism is a voice that indirectly reinforces the 
proclamation of its Cause.  Unpopularity but serves to throw 
into greater relief the contrast between it and its adversaries, 
while ostracism is itself the magnetic power that must eventually 
win over to its camp the most vociferous and inveterate 
amongst its foes.  Already in the land where the greatest 
battles of the Faith have been fought, and its most rapacious 
enemies have lived, the march of events, the slow yet steady 
infiltration of its ideals, and the fulfillment of its prophecies, 
have resulted not only in disarming and in transforming the 
character of some of its most redoubtable enemies, but also 
in securing their firm and unreserved allegiance to its 
Founders.  So complete a transformation, so startling a reversal 
of attitude, can only be effected if that chosen vehicle 
which is designed to carry the Message of &amp;Baha'u'llah to the 
 
+P43 
hungry, the restless, and unshepherded multitudes is itself 
thoroughly cleansed from the defilements which it seeks to 
remove.  
     It is upon you, therefore, my best-beloved friends, that 
I wish to impress not only the urgency and imperative necessity 
of your holy task, but also the limitless possibilities 
which it possesses of raising to such an exalted level not 
only the life and activities of your own community, but the 
motives and standards that govern the relationships existing 
among the people to which you belong.  Undismayed by the 
formidable nature of this task, you will, I am confident, 
meet as befits you the challenge of these times, so fraught 
with peril, so full of corruption, and yet so pregnant with 
the promise of a future so bright that no previous age in the 
annals of mankind can rival its glory.  

     Dearly beloved friends!  I have attempted, in the beginning 
of these pages, to convey an idea of the glorious opportunities 
as well as the tremendous responsibilities which, as 
a result of the persecution of the far-flung Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
now face the community of the American believers, at 
so critical a stage in the Formative Period of their Faith, and 
in so crucial an epoch in the world's history.  I have dwelt 
sufficiently upon the character of the mission which in a not 
too distant future that community must, through the impelling 
force of circumstances, arise and carry out.  I have uttered 
the warning which I felt would be necessary to a clearer 
understanding, and a better discharge, of the tasks lying 
ahead of it.  I have set forth, and stressed as far as it was in 
my power, those exalted and dynamic virtues, those lofty 
standards, which, difficult as they are to attain, constitute 
nonetheless the essential requirements for the success of 
those tasks.  A word, I believe, should now be said in connection 
with the material aspect of their immediate task, 
upon the termination of which, at its appointed time, must 
depend not only the unfoldment of the subsequent stages in 
the Divine Plan envisaged by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, but also the acquisition 
 
+P44 
of those capacities which will qualify them to discharge, 
in the fullness of time, the duties and responsibilities 
demanded by that greater mission which it is their privilege 
to perform.  
     The Seven Year Plan, with its twofold aspects of Temple 
ornamentation and extension of teaching activity, embracing 
both the Northern and Southern American continents, 
is now well advanced into its second year, and offers 
to anyone who has observed its progress in recent months 
signs that are extremely heartening and which augur well 
for the attainment of its objectives within the allotted time.  
The successive steps designed to facilitate, and covering the 
entire field of, the work to be achieved in connection with 
the exterior ornamentation of the Temple have for the most 
part been taken.  The final phase which is to mark the triumphant 
conclusion of a thirty-year old enterprise has at long 
last been entered.  The initial contract connected with the 
first and main story of that historic edifice has been signed.  
The Fund associated with the beloved name of the Greatest 
Holy Leaf has been launched.  The uninterrupted continuation 
to its very end of so laudable an enterprise is now assured.  
The poignant memories of one whose heart so greatly 
rejoiced at the rearing of the superstructure of this sacred 
House will so energize the final exertions required to complete 
it as to dissipate any doubt that may yet linger in any 
mind as to the capacity of its builders to worthily consummate 
their task.  
     The teaching aspect of the Plan must now be pondered.  
Its challenge must be met, and its requirements studied, 
weighed, and fulfilled.  Superb and irresistible as is the 
beauty of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the West, majestic 
as are its dimensions, unique as is its architecture, and priceless 
as are the ideals and the aspirations which it symbolizes, 
it should be regarded, at the present time, as no more 
than an instrument for a more effective propagation of the 
Cause and a wider diffusion of its teachings.  In this respect 
it should be viewed in the same light as the administrative 
 
+P45 
institutions of the Faith which are designed as vehicles for 
the proper dissemination of its ideals, its tenets, and its verities.  
     It is, therefore, to the teaching requirements of the Seven 
Year Plan that the community of the American believers 
must henceforth direct their careful and sustained attention.  
The entire community must, as one man, arise to fulfill 
them.  To teach the Cause of God, to proclaim its truths, to 
defend its interests, to demonstrate, by words as well as by 
deeds, its indispensability, its potency, and universality, 
should at no time be regarded as the exclusive concern or 
sole privilege of &amp;Baha'i administrative institutions, be they 
Assemblies, or committees.  All must participate, however 
humble their origin, however limited their experience, however 
restricted their means, however deficient their education, 
however pressing their cares and preoccupations, however 
unfavorable the environment in which they live.  "God," 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, Himself, has unmistakably revealed, "hath prescribed 
unto everyone the duty of teaching His Cause."  "Say," He 
further has written, "Teach ye the Cause of God, O people of 
&amp;Baha, for God hath prescribed unto everyone the duty of proclaiming 
His Message, and regardeth it as the most meritorious of all 
deeds."  
     A high and exalted position in the ranks of the community, 
conferring as it does on its holder certain privileges and 
prerogatives, no doubt invests him with a responsibility that 
he cannot honorably shirk in his duty to teach and promote 
the Faith of God.  It may, at times, though not invariably, 
create greater opportunities and furnish better facilities to 
spread the knowledge of that Faith, and to win supporters to 
its institutions.  It does not, however, under any circumstances, 
necessarily carry with it the power of exercising 
greater influence on the minds and hearts of those to whom 
that Faith is presented.  How often--and the early history of 
the Faith in the land of its birth offers many a striking testimony--
have the lowliest adherents of the Faith, unschooled 
and utterly inexperienced, and with no standing 
 
+P46 
whatever, and in some cases devoid of intelligence, been capable 
of winning victories for their Cause, before which the 
most brilliant achievements of the learned, the wise, and the 
experienced have paled.  
     "Peter," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha has testified, "according to the history 
of the Church, was also incapable of keeping count of the days 
of the week.  Whenever he decided to go fishing, he would tie up his 
weekly food into seven parcels, and every day he would eat one of 
them, and when he had reached the seventh, he would know that 
the Sabbath had arrived, and thereupon would observe it."  If the 
Son of Man was capable of infusing into apparently so 
crude and helpless an instrument such potency as to cause, 
in the words of &amp;Baha'u'llah, "the mysteries of wisdom and of 
utterance to flow out of his mouth," and to exalt him above the 
rest of His disciples, and render him fit to become His successor 
and the founder of His Church, how much more can 
the Father, Who is &amp;Baha'u'llah, empower the most puny and 
insignificant among His followers to achieve, for the execution 
of His purpose, such wonders as would dwarf the 
mightiest achievements of even the first apostle of Jesus 
Christ!  
     "The &amp;Bab," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, moreover, has written, "hath 
said:  `Should a tiny ant desire, in this day, to be possessed of such 
power as to be able to unravel the abstrusest and most bewildering 
passages of the &amp;Qur'an, its wish will no doubt be fulfilled, inasmuch 
as the mystery of eternal might vibrates within the innermost 
being of all created things.'  If so helpless a creature can be 
endowed with so subtle a capacity, how much more efficacious 
must be the power released through the liberal effusions of the 
grace of &amp;Baha'u'llah!"  
     The field is indeed so immense, the period so critical, 
the Cause so great, the workers so few, the time so short, the 
privilege so priceless, that no follower of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
worthy to bear His name, can afford a moment's 
hesitation.  That God-born Force, irresistible in its sweeping 
power, incalculable in its potency, unpredictable in its 
course, mysterious in its workings, and awe-inspiring in its 
 
+P47 
manifestations--a Force which, as the &amp;Bab has written, "vibrates 
within the innermost being of all created things," and 
which, according to &amp;Baha'u'llah, has through its "vibrating 
influence," "upset the equilibrium of the world and revolutionized 
its ordered life"--such a Force, acting even as a two-edged 
sword, is, under our very eyes, sundering, on the one hand, 
the age-old ties which for centuries have held together the 
fabric of civilized society, and is unloosing, on the other, the 
bonds that still fetter the infant and as yet unemancipated 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  The undreamt-of opportunities offered 
through the operation of this Force--the American believers 
must now rise, and fully and courageously exploit them.  
"The holy realities of the Concourse on high," writes &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
"yearn, in this day, in the Most Exalted Paradise, to return 
unto this world, so that they may be aided to render some service 
to the threshold of the &amp;Abha Beauty, and arise to demonstrate their 
servitude to His sacred Threshold."  
     A world, dimmed by the steadily dying-out light of religion, 
heaving with the explosive forces of a blind and triumphant 
nationalism; scorched with the fires of pitiless persecution, 
whether racial or religious; deluded by the false 
theories and doctrines that threaten to supplant the worship 
of God and the sanctification of His laws; enervated by a 
rampant and brutal materialism; disintegrating through the 
corrosive influence of moral and spiritual decadence; and 
enmeshed in the coils of economic anarchy and strife--such 
is the spectacle presented to men's eyes, as a result of the 
sweeping changes which this revolutionizing Force, as yet in 
the initial stage of its operation, is now producing in the life 
of the entire planet.  
     So sad and moving a spectacle, bewildering as it must 
be to every observer unaware of the purposes, the prophecies, 
and promises of &amp;Baha'u'llah, far from casting dismay 
into the hearts of His followers, or paralyzing their efforts, 
cannot but deepen their faith, and excite their enthusiastic 
eagerness to arise and display, in the vast field traced for 
them by the pen of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, their capacity to play their 
 
+P48 
part in the work of universal redemption proclaimed by &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
Every instrument in the administrative machinery 
which, in the course of several years, they have so laboriously 
erected must be fully utilized, and subordinated to the 
end for which it was created.  The Temple, that proud embodiment 
of so rare a spirit of self-sacrifice, must likewise be 
made to play its part, and contribute its share to the teaching 
campaign designed to embrace the entire Western Hemisphere.  
     The opportunities which the turmoil of the present age 
presents, with all the sorrows which it evokes, the fears 
which it excites, the disillusionment which it produces, the 
perplexities which it creates, the indignation which it 
arouses, the revolt which it provokes, the grievances it engenders, 
the spirit of restless search which it awakens, must, 
in like manner, be exploited for the purpose of spreading far 
and wide the knowledge of the redemptive power of the 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and for enlisting fresh recruits in the 
ever-swelling army of His followers.  So precious an opportunity, 
so rare a conjunction of favorable circumstances, 
may never again recur.  Now is the time, the appointed time, 
for the American believers, the vanguard of the hosts of the 
Most Great Name, to proclaim, through the agencies and 
channels of a specially designed Administrative Order, their 
capacity and readiness to rescue a fallen and sore-tried generation 
that has rebelled against its God and ignored His 
warnings, and to offer it that complete security which only 
the strongholds of their Faith can provide.  
     The teaching campaign, inaugurated throughout the 
states of the North American Republic and the Dominion of 
Canada, acquires, therefore, an importance, and is invested 
with an urgency, that cannot be overestimated.  Launched 
on its course through the creative energies released by the 
Will of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and sweeping across the Western 
Hemisphere through the propelling force which it is generating, 
it must, I feel, be carried out in conformity with certain 
 
+P49 
principles, designed to insure its efficient conduct, and 
to hasten the attainment of its objective.  
     Those who participate in such a campaign, whether in 
an organizing capacity, or as workers to whose care the execution 
of the task itself has been committed, must, as an essential 
preliminary to the discharge of their duties, thoroughly 
familiarize themselves with the various aspects of 
the history and teachings of their Faith.  In their efforts to 
achieve this purpose they must study for themselves, conscientiously 
and painstakingly, the literature of their Faith, 
delve into its teachings, assimilate its laws and principles, 
ponder its admonitions, tenets and purposes, commit to 
memory certain of its exhortations and prayers, master the 
essentials of its administration, and keep abreast of its current 
affairs and latest developments.  They must strive to obtain, 
from sources that are authoritative and unbiased, a 
sound knowledge of the history and tenets of &amp;Islam--the 
source and background of their Faith--and approach reverently 
and with a mind purged from preconceived ideas the 
study of the &amp;Qur'an which, apart from the sacred scriptures 
of the &amp;Babi and &amp;Baha'i Revelations, constitutes the only Book 
which can be regarded as an absolutely authenticated Repository 
of the Word of God.  They must devote special attention 
to the investigation of those institutions and circumstances 
that are directly connected with the origin and birth 
of their Faith, with the station claimed by its Forerunner, 
and with the laws revealed by its Author.  
     Having acquired, in their essentials, these prerequisites 
of success in the teaching field, they must, whenever they 
contemplate undertaking any specific mission in the countries 
of Latin America, endeavor, whenever feasible, to acquire 
a certain proficiency in the languages spoken by the 
inhabitants of those countries, and a knowledge of their customs, 
habits, and outlook.  "The teachers going to those parts," 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, referring in one of the Tablets of the Divine 
Plan to the Central American Republics, has written, "must 
 
+P50 
also be familiar with the Spanish language."  "A party speaking 
their languages ...," He, in another Tablet, has written, 
"must turn their faces to and travel through the three great Island 
groups of the Pacific Ocean."  "The teachers traveling in different 
directions," He further states, "must know the language of the 
country in which they will enter.  For example, a person being proficient 
in the Japanese language may travel to Japan, or a person 
knowing the Chinese language may hasten to China, and so forth."  
     No participator in this inter-American campaign of 
teaching must feel that the initiative for any particular activity 
connected with this work must rest solely with those 
agencies, whether Assemblies or committees, whose special 
concern is to promote and facilitate the attainment of this 
vital objective of the Seven Year Plan.  It is the bounden duty 
of every American believer, as the faithful trustee of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
Divine Plan, to initiate, promote, and consolidate, 
within the limits fixed by the administrative principles of 
the Faith, any activity he or she deems fit to undertake for 
the furtherance of the Plan.  Neither the threatening world 
situation, nor any consideration of lack of material resources, 
of mental equipment, of knowledge, or of experience--
desirable as they are--should deter any prospective 
pioneer teacher from arising independently, and from setting 
in motion the forces which, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha has repeatedly 
assured us, will, once released, attract even as a magnet the 
promised and infallible aid of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Let him not wait 
for any directions, or expect any special encouragement, 
from the elected representatives of his community, nor be 
deterred by any obstacles which his relatives, or fellow-citizens 
may be inclined to place in his path, nor mind the censure 
of his critics or enemies.  "Be unrestrained as the wind," is 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's counsel to every would-be teacher of His 
Cause, "while carrying the Message of Him Who hath caused the 
dawn of Divine Guidance to break.  Consider how the wind, faithful 
to that which God hath ordained, bloweth upon all regions of 
the earth, be they inhabited or desolate.  Neither the sight of desolation, 
nor the evidences of prosperity, can either pain or please it.  It 
 
+P51 
bloweth in every direction, as bidden by its Creator."  "And when 
he determineth to leave his home, for the sake of the Cause of his 
Lord," &amp;Baha'u'llah, in another passage, referring to such a 
teacher, has revealed, "let him put his whole trust in God, as the 
best provision for his journey, and array himself with the robe of 
virtue....  If he be kindled with the fire of His love, if he forgoeth 
all created things, the words he uttereth shall set on fire them that 
hear him."  
     Having on his own initiative, and undaunted by any 
hindrances with which either friend or foe may, unwittingly 
or deliberately, obstruct his path, resolved to arise and respond 
to the call of teaching, let him carefully consider every 
avenue of approach which he might utilize in his personal 
attempts to capture the attention, maintain the 
interest, and deepen the faith, of those whom he seeks to 
bring into the fold of his Faith.  Let him survey the possibilities 
which the particular circumstances in which he lives offer 
him, evaluate their advantages, and proceed intelligently 
and systematically to utilize them for the achievement of the 
object he has in mind.  Let him also attempt to devise such 
methods as association with clubs, exhibitions, and societies, 
lectures on subjects akin to the teachings and ideals of 
his Cause such as temperance, morality, social welfare, religious 
and racial tolerance, economic cooperation, &amp;Islam, and 
Comparative Religion, or participation in social, cultural, 
humanitarian, charitable, and educational organizations 
and enterprises which, while safeguarding the integrity of 
his Faith, will open up to him a multitude of ways and 
means whereby he can enlist successively the sympathy, the 
support, and ultimately the allegiance of those with whom 
he comes in contact.  Let him, while such contacts are being 
made, bear in mind the claims which his Faith is constantly 
making upon him to preserve its dignity, and station, to 
safeguard the integrity of its laws and principles, to demonstrate 
its comprehensiveness and universality, and to defend 
fearlessly its manifold and vital interests.  Let him consider 
the degree of his hearer's receptivity, and decide for himself 
 
+P52 
the suitability of either the direct or indirect method of 
teaching, whereby he can impress upon the seeker the vital 
importance of the Divine Message, and persuade him to 
throw in his lot with those who have already embraced it.  
Let him remember the example set by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and 
His constant admonition to shower such kindness upon the 
seeker, and exemplify to such a degree the spirit of the 
teachings he hopes to instill into him, that the recipient will 
be spontaneously impelled to identify himself with the 
Cause embodying such teachings.  Let him refrain, at the 
outset, from insisting on such laws and observances as 
might impose too severe a strain on the seeker's newly 
awakened faith, and endeavor to nurse him, patiently, tactfully, 
and yet determinedly, into full maturity, and aid him 
to proclaim his unqualified acceptance of whatever has been 
ordained by &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Let him, as soon as that stage has 
been attained, introduce him to the body of his fellow-believers, 
and seek, through constant fellowship and active 
participation in the local activities of his community, to enable 
him to contribute his share to the enrichment of its life, 
the furtherance of its tasks, the consolidations of its interests, 
and the coordination of its activities with those of its 
sister communities.  Let him not be content until he has infused 
into his spiritual child so deep a longing as to impel 
him to arise independently, in his turn, and devote his energies 
to the quickening of other souls, and the upholding of 
the laws and principles laid down by his newly adopted 
Faith.  
     Let every participator in the continent-wide campaign 
initiated by the American believers, and particularly those 
engaged in pioneer work in virgin territories, bear in mind 
the necessity of keeping in close and constant touch with 
those responsible agencies designed to direct, coordinate, 
and facilitate the teaching activities of the entire community.  
Whether it be the body of their elected national representatives, 
or its chief auxiliary institution, the National 
Teaching Committee, or its subsidiary organs, the regional 
 
+P53 
teaching committees, or the local Spiritual Assemblies and 
their respective teaching committees, they who labor for the 
spread of the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah should, through constant 
interchange of ideas, through letters, circulars, reports, bulletins 
and other means of communication with these established 
instruments designed for the propagation of the Faith, 
insure the smooth and speedy functioning of the teaching 
machinery of their Administrative Order.  Confusion, delay, 
duplication of efforts, dissipation of energy will, thereby, be 
completely avoided, and the mighty flood of the grace of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, flowing abundantly and without the least obstruction 
through these essential channels will so inundate 
the hearts and souls of men as to enable them to bring forth 
the harvest repeatedly predicted by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
     Upon every participator in this concerted effort, unprecedented 
in the annals of the American &amp;Baha'i community, 
rests the spiritual obligation to make of the mandate of 
teaching, so vitally binding upon all, the all-pervading concern 
of his life.  In his daily activities and contacts, in all his 
journeys, whether for business or otherwise, on his holidays 
and outings, and on any mission he may be called upon to 
undertake, every bearer of the Message of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
should consider it not only an obligation but a privilege to 
scatter far and wide the seeds of His Faith, and to rest content 
in the abiding knowledge that whatever be the immediate 
response to that Message, and however inadequate the 
vehicle that conveyed it, the power of its Author will, as He 
sees fit, enable those seeds to germinate, and in circumstances 
which no one can foresee enrich the harvest which 
the labor of His followers will gather.  If he be member of 
any Spiritual Assembly let him encourage his Assembly to 
consecrate a certain part of its time, at each of its sessions, to 
the earnest and prayerful consideration of such ways and 
means as may foster the campaign of teaching, or may furnish 
whatever resources are available for its progress, extension, 
and consolidation.  If he attends his summer school--
and everyone without exception is urged to take advantage 
 
+P54 
of attending it--let him consider such an occasion as a welcome 
and precious opportunity so to enrich, through lectures, 
study, and discussion, his knowledge of the fundamentals 
of his Faith as to be able to transmit, with greater 
confidence and effectiveness, the Message that has been entrusted 
to his care.  Let him, moreover, seek, whenever feasible, 
through intercommunity visits to stimulate the zeal for 
teaching, and to demonstrate to outsiders the zest and alertness 
of the promoters of his Cause and the organic unity of 
its institutions.  
     Let anyone who feels the urge among the participators 
in this crusade, which embraces all the races, all the republics, 
classes and denominations of the entire Western Hemisphere, 
arise, and, circumstances permitting, direct in particular 
the attention, and win eventually the unqualified 
adherence, of the Negro, the Indian, the Eskimo, and Jewish 
races to his Faith.  No more laudable and meritorious service 
can be rendered the Cause of God, at the present hour, than 
a successful effort to enhance the diversity of the members 
of the American &amp;Baha'i community by swelling the ranks of 
the Faith through the enrollment of the members of these 
races.  A blending of these highly differentiated elements of 
the human race, harmoniously interwoven into the fabric of 
an all-embracing &amp;Baha'i fraternity, and assimilated through 
the dynamic processes of a divinely appointed Administrative 
Order, and contributing each its share to the enrichment 
and glory of &amp;Baha'i community life, is surely an achievement 
the contemplation of which must warm and thrill every 
&amp;Baha'i heart.  "Consider the flowers of a garden," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
has written, "though differing in kind, color, form, and 
shape, yet, inasmuch as they are refreshed by the waters of one 
spring, revived by the breath of one wind, invigorated by the rays 
of one sun, this diversity increaseth their charm, and addeth unto 
their beauty.  How unpleasing to the eye if all the flowers and 
plants, the leaves and blossoms, the fruits, the branches and the 
trees of that garden were all of the same shape and color!  Diversity 
of hues, form and shape, enricheth and adorneth the garden, and 
 
+P55 
heighteneth the effect thereof.  In like manner, when divers shades 
of thought, temperament and character, are brought together under 
the power and influence of one central agency, the beauty and 
glory of human perfection will be revealed and made manifest.  
Naught but the celestial potency of the Word of God, which ruleth 
and transcendeth the realities of all things, is capable of harmonizing 
the divergent thoughts, sentiments, ideas, and convictions of 
the children of men."  "I hope," is the wish expressed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
"that ye may cause that downtrodden race [Negro] to 
become glorious, and to be joined with the white race to serve the 
world of man with the utmost sincerity, faithfulness, love and purity."  
"One of the important questions," He also has written, 
"which affect the unity and the solidarity of mankind is the fellowship 
and equality of the white and colored races."  "You must attach 
great importance," writes &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in the Tablets of 
the Divine Plan, "to the Indians, the original inhabitants of 
America.  For these souls may be likened unto the ancient inhabitants 
of the Arabian Peninsula, who, prior to the Revelation of &amp;Muhammad, 
were like savages.  When the &amp;Muhammadan Light shone 
forth in their midst, they became so enkindled that they shed illumination 
upon the world.  Likewise, should these Indians be educated 
and properly guided, there can be no doubt that through the 
Divine teachings they will become so enlightened that the whole 
earth will be illumined."  "If it is possible," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha has 
also written, "send ye teachers to other portions of Canada; likewise, 
dispatch ye teachers to Greenland and the home of the Eskimos."  
"God willing," He further has written in those same 
Tablets, "the call of the Kingdom may reach the ears of the Eskimos....  
Should you display an effort, so that the fragrances of God 
may be diffused among the Eskimos, its effect will be very great 
and far-reaching."  "Praise be to God," writes &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
"that whatsoever hath been announced in the Blessed Tablets unto 
the Israelites, and the things explicitly written in the letters of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, are all being fulfilled.  Some have come to pass; others 
will be revealed in the future.  The Ancient Beauty hath in His sacred 
Tablets explicitly written that the day of their abasement is 
over.  His bounty will overshadow them, and this race will day by 
 
+P56 
day progress, and be delivered from its age-long obscurity and degradation."  
     Let those who are holding administrative positions in 
their capacity as members of either the National Spiritual 
Assembly, or of the national, the regional, or local teaching 
committees, continually bear in mind the vital and urgent 
necessity of insuring, within as short a time as possible, the 
formation, in the few remaining states of the North American 
Republic and the provinces of the Dominion of Canada, 
of groups, however small and rudimentary, and of providing 
every facility within their power to enable these newly 
formed nuclei to evolve, swiftly and along sound lines, into 
properly functioning, self-sufficient, and recognized Assemblies.  
To the laying of such foundations, the erection of such 
outposts--a work admittedly arduous, yet sorely needed 
and highly inspiring--the individual members of the American 
&amp;Baha'i community must lend their unstinted, continual, 
and enthusiastic support.  Wise as may be the measures 
which their elected representatives may devise, however 
practical and well conceived the plans they formulate, such 
measures and plans can never yield any satisfactory results 
unless a sufficient number of pioneers have determined to 
make the necessary sacrifices, and to volunteer to carry 
these projects into effect.  To implant, once and for all, the 
banner of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the heart of these virgin territories, 
to erect the structural basis of His Administrative Order in 
their cities and villages, and to establish a firm and permanent 
anchorage for its institutions in the minds and hearts of 
their inhabitants, constitute, I firmly believe, the first and 
most significant step in the successive stages through which 
the teaching campaign, inaugurated under the Seven Year 
Plan, must pass.  Whereas the external ornamentation of the 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, under this same Plan, has now entered 
the final phase in its development, the teaching campaign is 
still in its initial stages, and is far from having extended effectively 
its ramifications to either these virgin territories, or 
to those Republics that are situated in the South American 
 
+P57 
continent.  The effort required is prodigious, the conditions 
under which these preliminary establishments are to be 
made are often unattractive and unfavorable, the workers 
who are in a position to undertake such tasks limited, and 
the resources they can command meager and inadequate.  
And yet, how often has the pen of &amp;Baha'u'llah assured us 
that "should a man, all alone, arise in the name of &amp;Baha, and put 
on the armor of His love, him will the Almighty cause to be victorious, 
though the forces of earth and heaven be arrayed against 
him."  Has He not written:  "By God, besides Whom is none other 
God!  Should anyone arise for the triumph of our Cause, him will 
God render victorious though tens of thousands of enemies be 
leagued against him.  And if his love for me wax stronger, God will 
establish his ascendancy over all the powers of earth and heaven."  
"Consider the work of former generations," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha has 
written; "During the lifetime of Jesus Christ the believing, firm 
souls were few and numbered, but the heavenly blessings descended 
so plentifully that in a number of years countless souls entered beneath 
the shadow of the Gospel.  God has said in the &amp;Qur'an:  `One 
grain will bring forth seven sheaves, and every sheaf shall contain 
one hundred grains.'  In other words, one grain will become seven 
hundred; and if God so wills He will double these also.  It has often 
happened that one blessed soul has become the cause of the guidance 
of a nation.  Now we must not consider our ability and capacity, 
nay rather we must fix our gaze upon the favors and bounties of 
God, in these days, Who has made of the drop a sea, and of the 
atom a sun."  Let those who resolve to be the first to hoist the 
standard of such a Cause, under such conditions, and in 
such territories, nourish their souls with the sustaining 
power of these words, and, "putting on the armor of His love," 
a love which must "wax stronger" as they persevere in their 
lonesome task, arise to adorn with the tale of their deeds the 
most brilliant pages ever written in their country's spiritual 
history.  
     "Although," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, in the Tablets of the Divine 
Plan, has written, "in most of the states and cities of the United 
States, praise be to God, His fragrances are diffused, and souls unnumbered 
 
+P58 
are turning their faces and advancing toward the Kingdom 
of God, yet in some of the states the Standard of Unity is not 
yet upraised as it should be, nor are the mysteries of the Holy 
Books, such as the Bible, the Gospel, and the &amp;Qur'an, unraveled.  
Through the concerted efforts of all the friends the Standard of 
Unity must needs be unfurled in those states, and the Divine 
teachings promoted, so that these states may also receive their portion 
of the heavenly bestowals and a share of the Most Great Guidance."  
"The future of the Dominion of Canada," He, in another 
Tablet of the Divine Plan, has asserted, "is very great, and the 
events connected with it infinitely glorious.  The eye of God's loving-kindness 
will be turned towards it, and it shall become the manifestation 
of the favors of the All-Glorious."  "Again I repeat," He, 
in that same Tablet reaffirms His previous statement, "that 
the future of Canada, whether from a material or a spiritual standpoint, 
is very great."  
     No sooner is this initial step taken, involving as it does 
the formation of at least one nucleus in each of these virgin 
states and provinces in the North American continent, than 
the machinery for a tremendous intensification of &amp;Baha'i 
concerted effort must be set in motion, the purpose of which 
should be the reinforcement of the noble exertions which 
only a few isolated believers are now making for the awakening 
of the nations of Latin America to the Call of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
Not until this second phase of the teaching campaign, 
under the Seven Year Plan, has been entered can the campaign 
be regarded as fully launched, or the Plan itself as 
having attained the most decisive stage in its evolution.  So 
powerful will be the effusions of Divine grace that will be 
poured forth upon a valiant community that has already in 
the administrative sphere erected, in all the glory of its exterior 
ornamentation, its chief Edifice, and in the teaching 
field raised aloft, in every state and province, in the North 
American continent the banner of its Faith--so great will be 
these effusions that its members will find themselves overpowered 
by the evidences of their regenerative power.  
 
+P59 
     The Inter-America Committee must, at such a stage, 
nay even before it is entered, rise to the level of its opportunities, 
and display a vigor, a consecration, and enterprise as 
will be commensurate with the responsibilities it has shouldered.  
It should not, for a moment, be forgotten that Central 
and Southern America embrace no less than twenty independent 
nations, constituting approximately one-third of 
the entire number of the world's sovereign states, and are 
destined to play an increasingly important part in the shaping 
of the world's future destiny.  With the world contracting 
into a neighborhood, and the fortunes of its races, nations 
and peoples becoming inextricably interwoven, the remoteness 
of these states of the Western Hemisphere is vanishing, 
and the latent possibilities in each of them are becoming increasingly 
apparent.  
     When this second stage in the progressive unfoldment 
of teaching activities and enterprises, under the Seven Year 
Plan, is reached, and the machinery required for its prosecution 
begins to operate, the American believers, the stout-hearted 
pioneers of this mighty movement, must, guided by 
the unfailing light of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and in strict accordance 
with the Plan laid out by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and acting under 
the direction of their National Spiritual Assembly, and assured 
of the aid of the Inter-America Committee, launch an 
offensive against the powers of darkness, of corruption, and 
of ignorance, an offensive that must extend to the uttermost 
end of the Southern continent, and embrace within its scope 
each of the twenty nations that compose it.  
     Let some, at this very moment, gird up the loins of their 
endeavor, flee their native towns, cities, and states, forsake 
their country, and, "putting their whole trust in God as the best 
provision for their journey," set their faces, and direct their 
steps towards those distant climes, those virgin fields, those 
unsurrendered cities, and bend their energies to capture the 
citadels of men's hearts--hearts, which, as &amp;Baha'u'llah has 
written, "the hosts of Revelation and of utterance can subdue."  
 
+P60 
Let them not tarry until such time as their fellow-laborers 
will have passed the first stage in their campaign of teaching, 
but let them rather, from this very hour, arise to usher 
in the opening phase of what will come to be regarded as 
one of the most glorious chapters in the international history 
of their Faith.  Let them, at the very outset, "teach their own 
selves, that their speech may attract the hearts of their hearers."  
Let them regard the triumph of their Faith as their "supreme 
objective."  Let them not "consider the largeness or smallness of 
the receptacle" that carries the measure of grace that God 
poureth forth in this age.  Let them "disencumber themselves of 
all attachment to this world and the vanities thereof," and, with 
that spirit of detachment which &amp;Abdu'l-Baha exemplified 
and wished them to emulate, bring these diversified peoples 
and countries to the remembrance of God and His supreme 
Manifestation.  Let His love be a "storehouse of treasure for 
their souls," on the day when "every pillar shall tremble, when 
the very skins of men shall creep, when all eyes shall stare up with 
terror."  Let their "souls be aglow with the flame of the undying 
Fire that burneth in the midmost heart of the world, in such wise 
that the waters of the universe shall be powerless to cool down its 
ardor."  Let them be "unrestrained as the wind" which "neither 
the sight of desolation nor the evidences of prosperity can either 
pain or please."  Let them "unloose their tongues and proclaim 
unceasingly His Cause."  Let them "proclaim that which the Most 
Great Spirit will inspire them to utter in the service of the Cause of 
their Lord."  Let them "beware lest they contend with anyone, nay 
strive to make him aware of the truth with kindly manner and 
most convincing exhortation."  Let them "wholly for the sake of 
God proclaim His Message, and with that same spirit accept whatever 
response their words may evoke in their hearers."  Let them 
not, for one moment, forget that the "Faithful Spirit shall 
strengthen them through its power," and that "a company of His 
chosen angels shall go forth with them, as bidden by Him Who is 
the Almighty, the All-Wise."  Let them ever bear in mind "how 
great is the blessedness that awaiteth them that have attained the 
honor of serving the Almighty," and remember that "such a service 
 
+P61 
is indeed the prince of all goodly deeds, and the ornament of 
every goodly act."  
     And, finally, let these soul-stirring words of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
as they pursue their course throughout the length and 
breadth of the southern American continent, be ever ready 
on their lips, a solace to their hearts, a light on their path, a 
companion in their loneliness, and a daily sustenance in 
their journeys:  "O wayfarer in the path of God!  Take thou thy 
portion of the ocean of His grace, and deprive not thyself of the 
things that lie hidden in its depths....  A dewdrop out of this ocean 
would, if shed upon all that are in the heavens and on earth, suffice 
to enrich them with the bounty of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, 
the All-Wise.  With the hands of renunciation draw forth 
from its life-giving waters, and sprinkle therewith all created 
things, that they may be cleansed from all man-made limitations, 
and may approach the mighty seat of God, this hallowed and resplendent 
Spot.  Be not grieved if thou performest it thyself alone.  
Let God be all-sufficient for thee....  Proclaim the Cause of thy 
Lord unto all who are in the heavens and on the earth.  Should any 
man respond to thy call, lay bare before him the pearls of the wisdom 
of the Lord, thy God, which His Spirit hath sent down upon 
thee, and be thou of them that truly believe.  And should anyone 
reject thy offer, turn thou away from him, and put thy trust and 
confidence in the Lord of all worlds.  By the righteousness of God!  
Whoso openeth his lips in this day, and maketh mention of the 
name of his Lord, the hosts of Divine inspiration shall descend 
upon him from the heaven of my name, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.  
On him shall also descend the Concourse on high, each bearing 
aloft a chalice of pure light.  Thus hath it been foreordained in 
the realm of God's Revelation, by the behest of Him Who is the 
All-Glorious, the Most Powerful."  
     Let these words of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, gleaned from the 
Tablets of the Divine Plan, ring likewise in their ears, as they 
go forth, assured and unafraid, on His mission:  "O ye apostles 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah!  May my life be sacrificed for you!...  Behold the 
portals which &amp;Baha'u'llah hath opened before you!  Consider how 
exalted and lofty is the station you are destined to attain; how 
 
+P62 
unique the favors with which you have been endowed."  "My 
thoughts are turned towards you, and my heart leaps within me at 
your mention.  Could ye know how my soul gloweth with your love, 
so great a happiness would flood your hearts as to cause you to 
become enamored with each other."  "The full measure of your success 
is as yet unrevealed, its significance still unapprehended.  Erelong 
ye will, with your own eyes, witness how brilliantly every one 
of you, even as a shining star, will radiate in the firmament of your 
country the light of Divine Guidance, and will bestow upon its 
people the glory of an everlasting life."  "I fervently hope that in 
the near future the whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the 
results of your achievements."  "The Almighty will no doubt grant 
you the help of His grace, will invest you with the tokens of His 
might, and will endue your souls with the sustaining power of His 
holy Spirit."  "Be not concerned with the smallness of your numbers, 
neither be oppressed by the multitude of an unbelieving 
world....  Exert yourselves; your mission is unspeakably glorious.  
Should success crown your enterprise, America will assuredly 
evolve into a center from which waves of spiritual power will emanate, 
and the throne of the Kingdom of God will, in the plenitude of 
its majesty and glory, be firmly established."  
     It should be remembered that the carrying out of the 
Seven Year Plan involves, insofar as the teaching work is 
concerned, no more than the formation of at least one center 
in each of the Central and South American Republics.  The 
hundredth anniversary of the birth of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
should witness, if the Plan already launched is to meet 
with success, the laying, in each of these countries, of a 
foundation, however rudimentary, on which the rising generation 
of the American believers may, in the opening years 
of the second century of the &amp;Baha'i era, be able to build.  
Theirs will be the task, in the course of successive decades, 
to extend and reinforce those foundations, and to supply the 
necessary guidance, assistance, and encouragement that will 
enable the widely scattered groups of believers in those 
countries to establish independent and properly constituted 
local Assemblies, and thereby erect the framework of the 
 
+P63 
Administrative Order of their Faith.  The erection of such a 
framework is primarily the responsibility of those whom the 
community of the North American believers have converted 
to the Divine Message.  It is a task which must involve, apart 
from the immediate obligation of enabling every group to 
evolve into a local Assembly, the setting up of the entire machinery 
of the Administrative Order in conformity with the 
spiritual and administrative principles governing the life and 
activities of every established &amp;Baha'i community throughout 
the world.  No departure from these cardinal and clearly 
enunciated principles, embodied and preserved in &amp;Baha'i national 
and local constitutions, common to all &amp;Baha'i communities, 
can under any circumstances be tolerated.  This, however, 
is a task that concerns those who, at a later period, must 
arise to further a work which, to all intents and purposes, has 
not yet been effectively started.  
     To pave the way, in a more systematic manner, for the 
laying of the necessary foundation on which such permanent 
national and local institutions can be reared and securely 
established is a task that will very soon demand the 
concentrated attention of the prosecutors of the Seven Year 
Plan.  No sooner has their immediate obligation in connection 
with the opening up of the few remaining territories in 
the United States and Canada been discharged, than a carefully 
laid-out plan should be conceived, aiming at the establishment 
of such a foundation.  As already stated, the provision 
for these vast, preliminary undertakings, the scope of 
which must embrace the entire area occupied by the Central 
and South American Republics, constitutes the very core, 
and must ultimately decide the fate, of the teaching campaign 
conducted under the Seven Year Plan.  Upon this campaign 
must depend not only the effectual discharge of the 
solemn obligations undertaken in connection with the present 
Plan, but also the progressive unfoldment of the subsequent 
stages essential to the realization of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's vision 
of the part the American believers are to play in the 
worldwide propagation of their Cause.  
 
+P64 
     These undertakings, preliminary as they are to the 
strenuous and organized labors by which future generations 
of believers in the Latin countries must distinguish themselves, 
require, in turn, without a moment's delay, on the 
part of the National Spiritual Assembly and of both the National 
Teaching and Inter-America Committees, painstaking 
investigations preparatory to the sending of settlers and itinerant 
teachers, whose privilege will be to raise the call of the 
New Day in a new continent.  
     I can only, in my desire to be of some service to those 
who are to assume such tremendous responsibilities, and to 
suffer such self-denial, attempt to offer a few helpful suggestions 
which, I trust, will facilitate the accomplishment of 
the great work to be achieved in the very near future.  To this 
work, that must constitute an historical landmark of first-class 
importance when completed, the energies of the entire 
community must be resolutely consecrated.  The number of 
&amp;Baha'i teachers, be they settlers or travelers, must be substantially 
increased.  The material resources to be placed at 
their disposal must be multiplied, and efficiently administered.  
The literature with which they should be equipped 
must be vastly augmented.  The publicity that should aid 
them in the distribution of such literature should be extended, 
centrally organized, and vigorously conducted.  The 
possibilities latent in these countries should be diligently exploited, 
and systematically developed.  The various obstacles 
raised by the widely varying political and social conditions 
obtaining in these countries should be closely surveyed and 
determinedly surmounted.  In a word, no opportunity 
should be neglected, and no effort spared, to lay as broad 
and solid a basis as possible for the progress and development 
of the greatest teaching enterprise ever launched by 
the American &amp;Baha'i community.  
     The careful translation of such important &amp;Baha'i writings 
as are related to the history, the teachings, or the Administrative 
Order of the Faith, and their wide and systematic 
dissemination, in vast quantities, and throughout as 
 
+P65 
many of these Republics as possible, and in languages that 
are most suitable and needed, would appear to be the chief 
and most urgent measure to be taken simultaneously with 
the arrival of the pioneer workers in those fields.  "Books and 
pamphlets," writes &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in one of the Tablets of the 
Divine Plan, "must be either translated or composed in the languages 
of these countries and islands, to be circulated in every part 
and in all directions."  In countries where no objections can be 
raised by the civil authorities or any influential circles, this 
measure should be reinforced by the publication, in various 
organs of the Press, of carefully worded articles and letters, 
designed to impress upon the general public certain features 
of the stirring history of the Faith, and the range and character 
of its teachings.  
     Every laborer in those fields, whether as traveling 
teacher or settler, should, I feel, make it his chief and constant 
concern to mix, in a friendly manner, with all sections 
of the population, irrespective of class, creed, nationality, or 
color, to familiarize himself with their ideas, tastes, and habits, 
to study the approach best suited to them, to concentrate, 
patiently and tactfully, on a few who have shown 
marked capacity and receptivity, and to endeavor, with extreme 
kindness, to implant such love, zeal, and devotion in 
their hearts as to enable them to become in turn self-sufficient 
and independent promoters of the Faith in their respective 
localities.  "Consort with all men, O people of &amp;Baha," is 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's admonition, "in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship.  
If ye be aware of a certain truth, if ye possess a jewel, of 
which others are deprived, share it with them in a language of 
utmost kindliness and goodwill.  If it be accepted, if it fulfill its 
purpose, your object is attained.  If anyone should refuse it, leave 
him unto himself, and beseech God to guide him.  Beware lest ye 
deal unkindly with him.  A kindly tongue is the lodestone of the 
hearts of men.  It is the bread of the spirit, it clotheth the words 
with meaning, it is the fountain of the light of wisdom and understanding."  
     An effort, moreover, can and should be made, not only 
 
+P66 
by representative &amp;Baha'i bodies, but also by prospective 
teachers, as well as by other individual believers, deprived 
of the privilege of visiting those shores or of settling on that 
continent, to seize every opportunity that presents itself to 
make the acquaintance, and awaken the genuine interest, of 
such people who are either citizens of these countries, or are 
in any way connected with them, whatever be their interests 
or profession.  Through the kindness shown them, or any literature 
which may be given them, or any connection which 
they may establish with them, the American believers can 
thereby sow such seeds in their hearts as might, in future 
circumstances, germinate and yield the most unexpected results.  
Care, however, should, at all times, be exercised, lest 
in their eagerness to further the international interests of the 
Faith they frustrate their purpose, and turn away, through 
any act that might be misconstrued as an attempt to proselytize 
and bring undue pressure upon them, those whom they 
wish to win over to their Cause.  
     I would particularly direct my appeal to those American 
believers, sore-pressed as they are by the manifold, the 
urgent, and ever-increasing issues that confront them at the 
present hour, who may find it possible, whatever be their 
calling or employment, whether as businessmen, school 
teachers, lawyers, doctors, writers, office workers, and the 
like, to establish permanently their residence in such countries 
as may offer them a reasonable prospect of earning the 
means of livelihood.  They will by their action be relieving 
the continually increasing pressure on their Teaching Fund, 
which in view of its restricted dimensions must provide, 
when not otherwise available, the traveling and other expenses 
to be incurred in connection with the development 
of this vast undertaking.  Should they find it impossible to 
take advantage of so rare and sacred a privilege, let them, 
mindful of the words of &amp;Baha'u'llah, determine, each according 
to the means at his or her disposal, to appoint a deputy 
who, on that believer's behalf, will arise and carry out so 
noble an enterprise.  "Center your energies," are &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
 
+P67 
words, "in the propagation of the Faith of God.  Whoso is worthy 
of so high a calling, let him arise and promote it.  Whoso is unable, 
it is his duty to appoint him who will, in his stead, proclaim this 
Revelation, whose power hath caused the foundations of the 
mightiest structures to quake, every mountain to be crushed into 
dust, and every soul to be dumbfounded."  
     As to those who have been able to leave their homes 
and country, and to serve in those regions, whether temporarily 
or permanently, a special duty, which must continually 
be borne in mind, devolves upon them.  It should be one of 
their chief aims to keep, on the one hand, in constant touch 
with the National Committee specifically entrusted with the 
promotion of their work, and to cooperate, on the other, by 
every possible means and in the utmost harmony, with their 
fellow-believers in those countries, whatever the field in 
which they labor, whatever their standing, ability, or experience.  
Through the performance of their first duty they will 
derive the necessary stimulus and obtain the necessary 
guidance that will enable them to prosecute effectively their 
mission, and will also, through their regular reports to that 
committee, be imparting to the general body of their fellow-believers 
the news of the latest developments in their activities.  
By fulfilling their other duty, they will insure the 
smooth efficiency, facilitate the progress, and avert any untoward 
incidents that might handicap the development of 
their common enterprise.  The maintenance of close contact 
and harmonious relationships between the Inter-America 
Committee, entrusted with the immediate responsibility of 
organizing such a far-reaching enterprise, and the privileged 
pioneers who are actually executing that enterprise, and extending 
its ramifications far and wide, as well as among 
these pioneers themselves, would set, apart from its immediate 
advantages, a worthy and inspiring example to generations 
still yet to be born who are to carry on, with all its 
increasing complexities, the work which is being initiated at 
present.  
     It would, no doubt, be of exceptional importance and 
 
+P68 
value, particularly in these times when the various restrictions 
imposed in those countries make it difficult for a considerable 
number of &amp;Baha'i pioneers to establish their residence 
and earn their livelihood in those states, if certain 
ones among the believers, whose income, however slender, 
provides them with the means of an independent existence, 
would so arrange their affairs as to be able to reside indefinitely 
in those countries.  The sacrifices involved, the courage, 
faith, and perseverance it demands, are no doubt very 
great.  Their value, however, can never be properly assessed 
at the present time, and the limitless reward which they 
who demonstrate them will receive can never be adequately 
depicted.  "They that have forsaken their country," is &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
own testimony, "for the purpose of teaching Our Cause--
these shall the Faithful Spirit strengthen through its power....  By 
My life!  No act, however great, can compare with it, except such 
deeds as have been ordained by God, the All-Powerful, the Most 
Mighty.  Such a service is indeed the prince of all goodly deeds, and 
the ornament of every goodly act."  Such a reward, it should be 
noted, is not to be regarded as purely an abstract blessing 
confined to the future life, but also as a tangible benefit 
which such courage, faith and perseverance can alone confer 
in this material world.  The solid achievements, spiritual 
as well as administrative, which in the far-away continent 
of Australasia, and more recently in Bulgaria, representative 
believers from both Canada and the United States have accomplished, 
proclaim in terms unmistakable the nature of 
those prizes which, even in this world, such sterling heroism 
is bound to win.  "Whoso," &amp;Baha'u'llah, in a memorable passage, 
extolling those of His loved ones who have "journeyed 
through the countries in His Name and for His praise," has written, 
"hath attained their presence will glory in their meeting, and 
all that dwell in every land will be illumined by their memory."  
     I am moved, at this juncture, as I am reminded of the 
share which, ever since the inception of the Faith in the 
West, the handmaidens of &amp;Baha'u'llah, as distinguished 
from the men, have had in opening up, single-handed, so 
 
+P69 
many, such diversified, and widely scattered countries over 
the whole surface of the globe, not only to pay a tribute to 
such apostolic fervor as is truly reminiscent of those heroic 
men who were responsible for the birth of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
but also to stress the significance of such a preponderating 
share which the women of the West have had 
and are having in the establishment of His Faith throughout 
the whole world.  "Among the miracles," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself 
has testified, "which distinguish this sacred Dispensation is 
this, that women have evinced a greater boldness than men when 
enlisted in the ranks of the Faith."  So great and splendid a testimony 
applies in particular to the West, and though it has 
received thus far abundant and convincing confirmation 
must, as the years roll away, be further reinforced, as the 
American believers usher in the most glorious phase of their 
teaching activities under the Seven Year Plan.  The "boldness" 
which, in the words of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, has characterized 
their accomplishments in the past must suffer no 
eclipse as they stand on the threshold of still greater and nobler 
accomplishments.  Nay rather, it must, in the course of 
time and throughout the length and breadth of the vast and 
virgin territories of Latin America, be more convincingly 
demonstrated, and win for the beloved Cause victories more 
stirring than any it has as yet achieved.  
     To the &amp;Baha'i youth of America, moreover, I feel a 
word should be addressed in particular, as I survey the possibilities 
which a campaign of such gigantic proportions has 
to offer to the eager and enterprising spirit that so powerfully 
animates them in the service of the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
Though lacking in experience and faced with insufficient resources, 
yet the adventurous spirit which they possess, and 
the vigor, the alertness, and optimism they have thus far so 
consistently shown, qualify them to play an active part in 
arousing the interest, and in securing the allegiance, of their 
fellow youth in those countries.  No greater demonstration 
can be given to the peoples of both continents of the youthful 
vitality and the vibrant power animating the life, and the 
 
+P70 
institutions of the nascent Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah than an intelligent, 
persistent, and effective participation of the &amp;Baha'i 
youth, of every race, nationality, and class, in both the 
teaching and administrative spheres of &amp;Baha'i activity.  
Through such a participation the critics and enemies of the 
Faith, watching with varying degrees of skepticism and resentment, 
the evolutionary processes of the Cause of God 
and its institutions, can best be convinced of the indubitable 
truth that such a Cause is intensely alive, is sound to its very 
core, and its destinies in safe keeping.  I hope, and indeed 
pray, that such a participation may not only redound to the 
glory, the power, and the prestige of the Faith, but may also 
react so powerfully on the spiritual lives, and galvanize to 
such an extent the energies of the youthful members of the 
&amp;Baha'i community, as to empower them to display, in a 
fuller measure, their inherent capacities, and to unfold a further 
stage in their spiritual evolution under the shadow of 
the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Faithful to the provisions of the Charter laid down by 
the pen of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, I feel it my duty to draw the special 
attention of those to whom it has been entrusted to the urgent 
needs of, and the special position enjoyed by, the Republic 
of Panama, both in view of its relative proximity to 
the heart and center of the Faith in North America, and of 
its geographical position as the link between two continents.  
"All the above countries," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, referring to the Latin 
States in one of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, has written, 
"have importance, but especially the Republic of Panama, wherein 
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans come together through the Panama 
Canal.  It is a center for travel and passage from America to 
other continents of the world, and in the future it will gain most 
great importance."  "Likewise," He again has written, "ye must 
give great attention to the Republic of Panama, for in that point 
the Occident and the Orient find each other united through the 
Panama Canal, and it is also situated between the two great 
oceans.  That place will become very important in the future.  The 
teachings, once established there, will unite the East and the West, 
 
+P71 
the North and the South."  So privileged a position surely demands 
the special and prompt attention of the American 
&amp;Baha'i community.  With the Republic of Mexico already 
opened up to the Faith, and with a Spiritual Assembly properly 
constituted in its capital city, the southward penetration 
of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah into a neighboring country is but 
a natural and logical step, and should, it is to be hoped, 
prove to be not a difficult one.  No efforts should be spared, 
and no sacrifice be deemed too great, to establish even 
though it be a very small group in a Republic occupying, 
both spiritually and geographically, so strategic a position--
a group which, in view of the potency with which the words 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha have already endowed it, cannot but draw 
to itself, as soon as it is formed, the outpouring grace of the 
&amp;Abha Kingdom, and evolve with such marvelous swiftness 
as to excite the wonder and the admiration of even those 
who have already witnessed such stirring evidences of the 
force and power of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Preference, no 
doubt, should be given by all would-be pioneers, as well as 
by the members of the Inter-America Committee, to the 
spiritual needs of this privileged Republic, though every effort 
should, at the same time, be exerted to introduce the 
Faith, however tentatively, to the Republics of Guatemala, 
Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica which 
would link it, in an unbroken chain, with its mother Assemblies 
in the North American continent.  Obstacles, however 
formidable, should be surmounted, the resources of the 
&amp;Baha'i treasury should be liberally expended on its behalf, 
and the ablest and most precious exertions should be consecrated 
to the cause of its awakening.  The erection of yet another 
outpost of the Faith, in its heart, will constitute, I firmly 
believe, a landmark in the history of the Formative Period of 
the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the New World.  It will create limitless 
opportunities, galvanize the efforts, and reinvigorate 
the life, of those who will have accomplished this feat, and 
infuse immense courage and boundless joy into the hearts 
of the isolated groups and individuals in the neighboring 
 
+P72 
and distant Republics, and exert intangible yet powerful 
spiritual influences on the life and future development of its 
people.  
 
     Such, dearly beloved friends, is the vista that stretches 
before the eyes, and challenges the resources, of the American 
&amp;Baha'i community in these, the concluding years of the 
First Century of the &amp;Baha'i Era.  Such are the qualities and 
qualifications demanded of them for the proper discharge of 
their responsibilities and duties.  Such are the requirements, 
the possibilities, and the objectives of the Plan that claims 
every ounce of their energy.  Who knows but that these few 
remaining, fast-fleeting years, may not be pregnant with 
events of unimaginable magnitude, with ordeals more severe 
than any that humanity has as yet experienced, with 
conflicts more devastating than any which have preceded 
them.  Dangers, however sinister, must, at no time, dim the 
radiance of their new-born faith.  Strife and confusion, however 
bewildering, must never befog their vision.  Tribulations, 
however afflictive, must never shatter their resolve.  
Denunciations, however clamorous, must never sap their 
loyalty.  Upheavals, however cataclysmic, must never deflect 
their course.  The present Plan, embodying the budding 
hopes of a departed Master, must be pursued, relentlessly 
pursued, whatever may befall them in the future, however 
distracting the crises that may agitate their country or the 
world.  Far from yielding in their resolve, far from growing 
oblivious of their task, they should, at no time, however 
much buffeted by circumstances, forget that the synchronization 
of such world-shaking crises with the progressive unfoldment 
and fruition of their divinely appointed task is itself 
the work of Providence, the design of an inscrutable 
Wisdom, and the purpose of an all-compelling Will, a Will 
that directs and controls, in its own mysterious way, both 
the fortunes of the Faith and the destinies of men.  Such simultaneous 
processes of rise and of fall, of integration and 
of disintegration, of order and chaos, with their continuous 
 
+P73 
and reciprocal reactions on each other, are but aspects of a 
greater Plan, one and indivisible, whose Source is God, 
whose author is &amp;Baha'u'llah, the theater of whose operations 
is the entire planet, and whose ultimate objectives are 
the unity of the human race and the peace of all mankind.  
     Reflections such as these should steel the resolve of the 
entire &amp;Baha'i community, should dissipate their forebodings, 
and arouse them to rededicate themselves to every single 
provision of that Divine Charter whose outline has been delineated 
for them by the pen of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  The Seven 
Year Plan, as already stated, is but the initial stage, a stepping-stone 
to the unfoldment of the implications of this 
Charter.  The impulse, originally generated through the 
movement of that pen, and which is now driving forward, 
with increasing momentum, the machinery of the Seven 
Year Plan, must, in the opening years of the next century, be 
further accelerated, and impel the American &amp;Baha'i community 
to launch further stages in the unfoldment of the Divine 
Plan, stages that will carry it far beyond the shores of the 
Northern Hemisphere, into lands and among peoples where 
that community's noblest acts of heroism are to be performed.  
     Let anyone inclined to doubt the course which this enviable 
community is destined to follow, turn to and meditate 
upon these words of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, enshrined, for all time, 
in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, and addressed to the entire 
community of the believers of the United States and Canada:  
"The full measure of your success," He informs them, "is as 
yet unrevealed, its significance still unapprehended.  Erelong, ye 
will, with your own eyes, witness how brilliantly every one of you, 
even as a shining star, will radiate, in the firmament of your country, 
the light of Divine Guidance, and will bestow upon its people 
the glory of an everlasting life....  The range of your future 
achievements still remains undisclosed.  I fervently hope that in the 
near future the whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the results 
of your achievements.  The hope, therefore, which &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
cherishes for you is that the same success which has attended 
 
+P74 
your efforts in America may crown your endeavors in other parts of 
the world, that through you the fame of the Cause of God may be 
diffused throughout the East and the West, and the advent of the 
Kingdom of the Lord of Hosts be proclaimed in all the five continents 
of the globe."  "The moment," He most significantly adds, 
"this Divine Message is carried forward by the American believers 
from the shores of America, and is propagated throughout the continents 
of Europe, of Asia, of Africa, and of Australasia, and as far 
as the islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself securely 
established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion.  Then will 
all the peoples of the world witness that this community is spiritually 
illumined and divinely guided.  Then will the whole earth 
resound with the praises of its majesty and greatness."  
     No reader of these words, so vibrant with promises 
that not even the triumphant consummation of the Seven 
Year Plan can fulfill, can expect a community that has been 
raised so high, and endowed so richly, to remain content 
with any laurels it may win in the immediate future.  To rest 
upon such laurels would indeed be tantamount to a betrayal 
of the trust placed in that community by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  To 
cut short the chain of victories that must lead it on to that 
supreme triumph when "the whole earth may be stirred and 
shaken" by the results of its achievements would shatter His 
hopes.  To vacillate, and fail to "propagate through the continents 
of Europe, of Asia, of Africa, and of Australasia, and as far as 
the islands of the Pacific" a Message so magnificently proclaimed 
by it in the American continent would deprive it of 
the privilege of being "securely established upon the throne of 
an everlasting dominion."  To forfeit the honor of proclaiming 
"the advent of the Kingdom of the Lord of Hosts" in "all the five 
continents of the globe" would silence those "praises of its majesty 
and greatness" that otherwise would echo throughout 
"the whole earth."  
     Such vacillation, failure, or neglect, the American believers, 
the ambassadors of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, will, I 
am firmly convinced, never permit.  Such a trust will never 
be betrayed, such hopes can never be shattered, such a privilege 
 
+P75 
will never be forfeited, nor will such praises remain 
unuttered.  Nay rather the present generation of this blessed, 
this repeatedly blessed, community will go from strength to 
strength, and will hand on, as the first century draws to a 
close, to the generations that must succeed it in the second 
the torch of Divine Guidance, undimmed by the tempestuous 
winds that must blow upon it, that they in turn, faithful 
to the wish and mandate of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, may carry that 
torch, with that self-same vigor, fidelity, and enthusiasm, to 
the darkest and remotest corners of the earth.  
     Dearly beloved friends!  I can do no better, eager as I am 
to extend to every one of you any assistance in my power 
that may enable you to discharge more effectively your divinely 
appointed, continually multiplying duties, than to direct 
your special attention, at this decisive hour, to these immortal 
passages, gleaned in part from the great mass of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's unpublished and untranslated writings.  
Whether in His revelation of the station and functions of His 
loved ones, or His eulogies of the greatness of His Cause, or 
His emphasis on the paramount importance of teaching, or 
the dangers which He foreshadows, the counsels He imparts, 
the warnings He utters, the vistas He discloses, and 
the assurances and promises He gives, these dynamic and 
typical examples of &amp;Baha'u'llah's sublime utterance, each 
having a direct bearing on the tasks which actually face or 
lie ahead of the American &amp;Baha'i community, cannot fail to 
produce on the minds and hearts of any one of its members, 
who approaches them with befitting humility and detachment, 
such powerful reactions as to illuminate his entire being 
and intensify tremendously his daily exertions.  
     "O friends!  Be not careless of the virtues with which ye have 
been endowed, neither be neglectful of your high destiny....  Ye 
are the stars of the heaven of understanding, the breeze that stirreth 
at the break of day, the soft-flowing waters upon which must 
depend the very life of all men, the letters inscribed upon His sacred 
scroll."  "O people of &amp;Baha!  Ye are the breezes of spring that 
are wafted over the world.  Through you We have adorned the 
 
+P76 
world of being with the ornament of the knowledge of the Most 
Merciful.  Through you the countenance of the world hath been 
wreathed in smiles, and the brightness of His light shone forth.  
Cling ye to the Cord of steadfastness, in such wise that all vain 
imaginings may utterly vanish.  Speed ye forth from the horizon of 
power, in the name of your Lord, the Unconstrained, and announce 
unto His servants, with wisdom and eloquence, the tidings of this 
Cause, whose splendor hath been shed upon the world of being.  
Beware lest anything withhold you from observing the things prescribed 
unto you by the Pen of Glory, as it moved over His Tablet 
with sovereign majesty and might.  Great is the blessedness of him 
that hath hearkened to its shrill voice, as it was raised, through the 
power of truth, before all who are in heaven and all who are on 
earth....  O people of &amp;Baha!  The river that is Life indeed hath 
flowed for your sakes.  Quaff ye in My name, despite them that 
have disbelieved in God, the Lord of Revelation.  We have made 
you to be the hands of Our Cause.  Render ye victorious this 
Wronged One, Who hath been sore-tried in the hands of the workers 
of iniquity.  He, verily, will aid everyone that aideth Him, and 
will remember everyone that remembereth Him.  To this beareth 
witness this Tablet that hath shed the splendor of the loving-kindness 
of your Lord, the All-Glorious, the All-Compelling."  "Blessed 
are the people of &amp;Baha!  God beareth Me witness!  They are the solace 
of the eye of creation.  Through them the universes have been 
adorned, and the Preserved Tablet embellished.  They are the ones 
who have sailed on the ark of complete independence, with their 
faces set towards the Dayspring of Beauty.  How great is their 
blessedness that they have attained unto what their Lord, the Omniscient, 
the All-Wise, hath willed.  Through their light the heavens 
have been adorned, and the faces of those that have drawn 
nigh unto Him made to shine."  "By the sorrows which afflict the 
beauty of the All-Glorious!  Such is the station ordained for the true 
believer that if to an extent smaller than a needle's eye the glory of 
that station were to be unveiled to mankind, every beholder would 
be consumed away in his longing to attain it.  For this reason it 
hath been decreed that in this earthly life the full measure of the 
glory of his own station should remain concealed from the eyes of 
 
+P77 
such a believer."  "If the veil be lifted, and the full glory of the 
station of those who have turned wholly towards God, and in their 
love for Him renounced the world, be made manifest, the entire 
creation would be dumbfounded."  
     "Verily I say!  No one hath apprehended the root of this 
Cause.  It is incumbent upon everyone, in this day, to perceive with 
the eye of God, and to hearken with His ear.  Whoso beholdeth Me 
with an eye besides Mine own will never be able to know Me.  
None among the Manifestations of old, except to a prescribed degree, 
hath ever completely apprehended the nature of this Revelation."  
"I testify before God to the greatness, the inconceivable 
greatness of this Revelation.  Again and again have We, in most of 
Our Tablets, borne witness to this truth, that mankind may be 
roused from its heedlessness."  "How great is the Cause, how staggering 
the weight of its Message!"  "In this most mighty Revelation 
all the Dispensations of the past have attained their highest, their 
final consummation."  "That which hath been made manifest in 
this preeminent, this most exalted Revelation, stands unparalleled 
in the annals of the past, nor will future ages witness its like."  
"The purpose underlying all creation is the revelation of this most 
sublime, this most holy Day, the Day known as the Day of God, in 
His Books and Scriptures--the Day which all the Prophets, and 
the Chosen Ones, and the holy ones, have wished to witness."  
"The highest essence and most perfect expression of whatsoever 
the peoples of old have either said or written hath, through this 
most potent Revelation, been sent down from the heaven of the 
Will of the All-Possessing, the Ever-Abiding God."  "This is the 
Day in which God's most excellent favors have been poured out 
upon men, the Day in which His most mighty grace hath been infused 
into all created things."  "This is the Day whereon the Ocean 
of God's mercy hath been manifested unto men, the Day in which 
the Daystar of His loving-kindness hath shed its radiance upon 
them, the Day in which the clouds of His bountiful favor have 
overshadowed the whole of mankind."  "By the righteousness of 
Mine own Self!  Great, immeasurably great is this Cause!  Mighty, 
inconceivably mighty is this Day!"  "Every Prophet hath announced 
the coming of this Day, and every Messenger hath 
 
+P78 
groaned in His yearning for this Revelation--a revelation which, 
no sooner had it been revealed than all created things cried out 
saying, `The earth is God's, the Most Exalted, the Most Great!'"  
"The Day of the Promise is come, and He Who is the Promised One 
loudly proclaimeth before all who are in heaven and all who are on 
earth, `Verily there is none other God but He, the Help in Peril, the 
Self-Subsisting!'  I swear by God!  That which had been enshrined 
from eternity in the knowledge of God, the Knower of the seen and 
unseen, is revealed.  Happy is the eye that seeth, and the face that 
turneth towards, the Countenance of God, the Lord of all being."  
"Great indeed is this Day!  The allusions made to it in all the sacred 
Scriptures as the Day of God attest its greatness.  The soul of every 
Prophet of God, of every Divine Messenger, hath thirsted for this 
wondrous Day.  All the divers kindreds of the earth have, likewise, 
yearned to attain it."  "This Day a door is open wider than both 
heaven and earth.  The eye of the mercy of Him Who is the Desire 
of the worlds is turned towards all men.  An act, however infinitesimal, 
is, when viewed in the mirror of the knowledge of God, mightier 
than a mountain.  Every drop proffered in His path is as the sea 
in that mirror.  For this is the Day which the one true God, glorified 
be He, hath announced in all His Books, unto His Prophets and 
His Messengers."  "This is a Revelation, under which, if a man 
shed for its sake one drop of blood, myriads of oceans will be his 
recompense."  "A fleeting moment, in this Day, excelleth centuries 
of a bygone age....  Neither sun nor moon hath witnessed a day 
such as this Day."  "This is the Day whereon the unseen world 
crieth out, `Great is thy blessedness, O earth, for thou hast been 
made the footstool of thy God, and been chosen as the seat of His 
mighty throne.'"  "The world of being shineth, in this Day, with 
the resplendency of this Divine Revelation.  All created things extol 
its saving grace, and sing its praises.  The universe is wrapt in an 
ecstasy of joy and gladness.  The Scriptures of past Dispensations 
celebrate the great Jubilee that must needs greet this most great 
Day of God.  Well is it with him that hath lived to see this Day, and 
hath recognized its station."  "This Day a different Sun hath arisen, 
and a different Heaven hath been adorned with its stars and its 
planets.  The world is another world, and the Cause another 
 
+P79 
Cause."  "This is the Day which past ages and centuries can never 
rival.  Know this, and be not of the ignorant."  "This is the Day 
whereon human ears have been privileged to hear what He Who 
conversed with God [Moses] heard upon Sinai, what He Who is 
the Friend of God [&amp;Muhammad] heard when lifted up towards 
Him, what He Who is the Spirit of God [Jesus] heard as He ascended 
unto Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting."  "This 
Day is God's Day, and this Cause His Cause.  Happy is he who 
hath renounced this world, and clung to Him Who is the Dayspring 
of God's Revelation."  "This is the King of Days, the Day 
that hath seen the coming of the Best Beloved, He Who through all 
eternity hath been acclaimed the Desire of the World."  "This is the 
Chief of all days and the King thereof.  Great is the blessedness of 
him who hath attained, through the sweet savor of these days, 
unto everlasting life, and who, with the most great steadfastness, 
hath arisen to aid the Cause of Him Who is the King of Names.  
Such a man is as the eye to the body of mankind."  "Peerless is this 
Day, for it is as the eye to past ages and centuries, and as a light 
unto the darkness of the times."  "This Day is different from other 
days, and this Cause different from other causes.  Entreat ye the 
one true God that He may deprive not the eyes of men from beholding 
His signs, nor their ears from hearkening unto the shrill 
voice of the Pen of Glory."  "These days are God's days, a moment 
of which ages and centuries can never rival.  An atom, in these 
days, is as the sun, a drop as the ocean.  One single breath exhaled 
in the love of God and for His service is written down by the Pen 
of Glory as a princely deed.  Were the virtues of this Day to be recounted, 
all would be thunderstruck, except those whom thy Lord 
hath exempted."  "By the righteousness of God!  These are the days 
in which God hath proved the hearts of the entire company of His 
Messengers and Prophets, and beyond them those that stand guard 
over His sacred and inviolable Sanctuary, the inmates of the celestial 
Pavilion and dwellers of the Tabernacle of Glory."  "Should the 
greatness of this Day be revealed in its fulness, every man would 
forsake a myriad lives in his longing to partake, though it be for 
one moment, of its great glory--how much more this world and its 
corruptible treasures!"  "God the true One is My Witness!  This is 
 
+P80 
the Day whereon it is incumbent upon everyone that seeth to behold, 
and every ear that hearkeneth to hear, and every heart that 
understandeth to perceive, and every tongue that speaketh to proclaim 
unto all who are in heaven and on earth, this holy, this exalted, 
and all-highest Name."  "Say, O men!  This is a matchless 
Day.  Matchless must, likewise, be the tongue that celebrateth the 
praise of the Desire of all nations, and matchless the deed that 
aspireth to be acceptable in His sight.  The whole human race hath 
longed for this Day, that perchance it may fulfill that which well 
beseemeth its station and is worthy of its destiny."  
     "Through the movement of Our Pen of Glory We have, at the 
bidding of the Omnipotent Ordainer, breathed a new life into every 
human frame, and instilled into every word a fresh potency.  All 
created things proclaim the evidences of this worldwide regeneration."  
"O people!  I swear by the one true God!  This is the Ocean 
out of which all Seas have proceeded, and with which every one of 
them will ultimately be united.  From Him all the Suns have been 
generated, and unto Him they will all return.  Through His potency 
the Trees of Divine Revelation have yielded their fruits, every one 
of which hath been sent down in the form of a Prophet, bearing a 
Message to God's creatures in each of the worlds whose number 
God, alone, in His all-encompassing knowledge, can reckon.  This 
He hath accomplished through the agency of but one Letter of His 
Word, revealed by His Pen--a Pen moved by His directing Finger
--His Finger itself sustained by the power of God's Truth."  "By 
the righteousness of the one true God!  If one speck of a jewel be lost 
and buried beneath a mountain of stones, and lie hidden beyond 
the seven seas, the Hand of Omnipotence would assuredly reveal it 
in this Day, pure and cleansed from dross."  "Every single letter 
proceeding from Our mouth is endowed with such regenerative 
power as to enable it to bring into existence a new creation--a creation 
the magnitude of which is inscrutable to all save God.  He 
verily hath knowledge of all things."  "It is in Our power, should 
We wish it, to enable a speck of floating dust to generate, in less 
than the twinkling of an eye, suns of infinite, of unimaginable 
splendor, to cause a dewdrop to develop into vast and numberless 
oceans, to infuse into every letter such a force as to empower it to 
 
+P81 
unfold all the knowledge of past and future ages."  "We are possessed 
of such power which, if brought to light, will transmute the 
most deadly of poisons into a panacea of unfailing efficacy."  
     "The days are approaching their end, and yet the peoples of 
the earth are seen sunk in grievous heedlessness, and lost in manifest 
error."  "Great, great is the Cause!  The hour is approaching 
when the most great convulsion will have appeared.  I swear by 
Him Who is the Truth!  It shall cause separation to afflict everyone, 
even those who circle around Me."  "Say:  O concourse of the heedless!  
I swear by God!  The promised day is come, the day when tormenting 
trials will have surged above your heads, and beneath 
your feet, saying:  `Taste ye what your hands have wrought!'"  "The 
time for the destruction of the world and its people hath arrived.  
He Who is the Pre-Existent is come, that He may bestow everlasting 
life, and grant eternal preservation, and confer that which is 
conducive to true living."  "The day is approaching when its [civilization's] 
flame will devour the cities, when the Tongue of Grandeur 
will proclaim:  `The Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the All-Praised!'"  
"O ye that are bereft of understanding!  A severe trial 
pursueth you, and will suddenly overtake you.  Bestir yourselves, 
that haply it may pass and inflict no harm upon you."  "O ye peoples 
of the world!  Know, verily, that an unforeseen calamity is following 
you, and that grievous retribution awaiteth you.  Think not 
the deeds ye have committed have been blotted from My sight."  "O 
heedless ones!  Though the wonders of My mercy have encompassed 
all created things, both visible and invisible, and though 
the revelations of My grace and bounty have permeated every 
atom of the universe, yet the rod with which I can chastise the 
wicked is grievous, and the fierceness of Mine anger against them 
terrible."  "Grieve thou not over those that have busied themselves 
with the things of this world, and have forgotten the remembrance 
of God, the Most Great.  By Him Who is the Eternal Truth!  The day 
is approaching when the wrathful anger of the Almighty will have 
taken hold of them.  He, verily, is the Omnipotent, the All-Subduing, 
the Most Powerful.  He shall cleanse the earth from the defilement 
of their corruption, and shall give it for an heritage unto such 
of His servants as are nigh unto Him."  "Soon will the cry, `Yea, 
 
+P82 
yea, here am I, here am I' be heard from every land.  For there hath 
never been, nor can there ever be, any other refuge to fly to for 
anyone."  "And when the appointed hour is come, there shall suddenly 
appear that which shall cause the limbs of mankind to 
quake.  Then, and only then, will the Divine Standard be unfurled, 
and the Nightingale of Paradise warble its melody."  
     "In the beginning of every Revelation adversities have prevailed, 
which later on have been turned into great prosperity."  
"Say:  O people of God!  Beware lest the powers of the earth alarm 
you, or the might of the nations weaken you, or the tumult of the 
people of discord deter you, or the exponents of earthly glory sadden 
you.  Be ye as a mountain in the Cause of your Lord, the Almighty, 
the All-Glorious, the Unconstrained."  "Say:  Beware, O 
people of &amp;Baha, lest the strong ones of the earth rob you of your 
strength, or they who rule the world fill you with fear.  Put your 
trust in God, and commit your affairs to His keeping.  He, verily, 
will, through the power of truth, render you victorious, and He, 
verily, is powerful to do what He willeth, and in His grasp are the 
reins of omnipotent might."  "I swear by My life!  Nothing save that 
which profiteth them can befall My loved ones.  To this testifieth 
the Pen of God, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the Best Beloved."  
"Let not the happenings of the world sadden you.  I swear 
by God!  The sea of joy yearneth to attain your presence, for every 
good thing hath been created for you, and will, according to the 
needs of the times, be revealed unto you."  "O my servants!  Sorrow 
not if, in these days and on this earthly plane, things contrary to 
your wishes have been ordained and manifested by God, for days of 
blissful joy, of heavenly delight, are assuredly in store for you.  
Worlds, holy and spiritually glorious, will be unveiled to your eyes.  
You are destined by Him, in this world and hereafter, to partake of 
their benefits, to share in their joys, and to obtain a portion of their 
sustaining grace.  To each and every one of them you will, no 
doubt, attain."  
     "This is the day in which to speak.  It is incumbent upon the 
people of &amp;Baha to strive, with the utmost patience and forbearance, 
to guide the peoples of the world to the Most Great Horizon.  Every 
body calleth aloud for a soul.  Heavenly souls must needs quicken, 
 
+P83 
with the breath of the Word of God, the dead bodies with a fresh 
spirit.  Within every word a new spirit is hidden.  Happy is the man 
that attaineth thereunto, and hath arisen to teach the Cause of 
Him Who is the King of Eternity."  "Say:  O servants!  The triumph 
of this Cause hath depended, and will continue to depend, upon 
the appearance of holy souls, upon the showing forth of goodly 
deeds, and the revelation of words of consummate wisdom."  "Center 
your energies in the propagation of the Faith of God.  Whoso is 
worthy of so high a calling, let him arise and promote it.  Whoso is 
unable, it is his duty to appoint him who will, in his stead, proclaim 
this Revelation, whose power hath caused the foundations of 
the mightiest structures to quake, every mountain to be crushed 
into dust, and every soul to be dumbfounded."  "Let your principal 
concern be to rescue the fallen from the slough of impending extinction, 
and to help him embrace the ancient Faith of God.  Your 
behavior towards your neighbor should be such as to manifest 
clearly the signs of the one true God, for ye are the first among men 
to be re-created by His Spirit, the first to adore and bow the knee 
before Him, the first to circle round His throne of glory."  "O ye 
beloved of God!  Repose not yourselves on your couches, nay, bestir 
yourselves as soon as ye recognize your Lord, the Creator, and hear 
of the things which have befallen Him, and hasten to His assistance.  
Unloose your tongues, and proclaim unceasingly His Cause.  
This shall be better for you than all the treasures of the past and of 
the future, if ye be of them that comprehend this truth."  "I swear 
by Him Who is the Truth!  Erelong will God adorn the beginning of 
the Book of Existence with the mention of His loved ones who have 
suffered tribulation in His path, and journeyed through the countries 
in His name and for His praise.  Whoso hath attained their 
presence will glory in their meeting, and all that dwell in every 
land will be illumined by their memory."  "Vie ye with each other 
in the service of God and of His Cause.  This is indeed what profiteth 
you in this world, and in that which is to come.  Your Lord, the 
God of Mercy, is the All-Informed, the All-Knowing.  Grieve not at 
the things ye witness in this day.  The day shall come whereon the 
tongues of the nations will proclaim:  `The earth is God's, the Almighty, 
the Single, the Incomparable, the All-Knowing!'"  "Blessed 
 
+P84 
is the spot, and the house, and the place, and the city, and the 
heart, and the mountain, and the refuge, and the cave, and the 
valley, and the land, and the sea, and the island, and the meadow 
where mention of God hath been made, and His praise glorified."  
"The movement itself from place to place, when undertaken for the 
sake of God, hath always exerted, and can now exert, its influence 
in the world.  In the Books of old the station of them that have 
voyaged far and near in order to guide the servants of God hath 
been set forth and written down."  "I swear by God!  So great are the 
things ordained for the steadfast that were they, so much as the eye 
of a needle, to be disclosed, all who are in heaven and on earth 
would be dumbfounded, except such as God, the Lord of all worlds, 
hath willed to exempt."  "I swear by God!  That which hath been 
destined for him who aideth My Cause excelleth the treasures of 
the earth."  "Whoso openeth his lips in this day, and maketh mention 
of the name of his Lord, the hosts of Divine inspiration shall 
descend upon him from the heaven of My name, the All-Knowing, 
the All-Wise.  On him shall also descend the Concourse on high, 
each bearing aloft a chalice of pure light.  Thus hath it been foreordained 
in the realm of God's Revelation, by the behest of Him Who 
is the All-Glorious, the Most Powerful."  "By the righteousness of 
Him Who, in this day, crieth within the inmost heart of all created 
things, `God, there is none other God besides Me!'  If any man were 
to arise to defend, in his writings, the Cause of God against its 
assailants, such a man, however inconsiderable his share, shall be 
so honored in the world to come that the Concourse on high would 
envy his glory.  No pen can depict the loftiness of his station, neither 
can any tongue describe its splendor."  "Please God ye may all 
be strengthened to carry out that which is the Will of God, and 
may be graciously assisted to appreciate the rank conferred upon 
such of His loved ones as have arisen to serve Him and magnify 
His name.  Upon them be the glory of God, the glory of all that is in 
the heavens and all that is on earth, and the glory of the inmates of 
the most exalted Paradise, the heaven of heavens."  "O people of 
&amp;Baha!  That there is none to rival you is a sign of mercy.  Quaff ye of 
the Cup of Bounty the wine of immortality, despite them that have 
repudiated God, the Lord of names and Maker of the heavens."  
 
+P85 
     "I swear by the one true God!  This is the day of those who 
have detached themselves from all but Him, the day of those who 
have recognized His unity, the day whereon God createth, with the 
hands of His power, divine beings and imperishable essences, every 
one of whom will cast the world and all that is therein behind 
him, and will wax so steadfast in the Cause of God that every wise 
and understanding heart will marvel."  "There lay concealed within 
the Holy Veil, and prepared for the service of God, a company of 
His chosen ones who shall be manifested unto men, who shall aid 
His Cause, who shall be afraid of no one, though the entire human 
race rise up and war against them.  These are the ones who, before 
the gaze of the dwellers on earth and the denizens of heaven, shall 
arise and, shouting aloud, acclaim the name of the Almighty, and 
summon the children of men to the path of God, the All-Glorious, 
the All-Praised."  "The day is approaching when God will have, by 
an act of His Will, raised up a race of men the nature of which is 
inscrutable to all save God, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting."  
"He will, erelong, out of the Bosom of Power, draw forth the Hands 
of Ascendancy and Might--Hands who will arise to win victory 
for this Youth, and who will purge mankind from the defilement of 
the outcast and the ungodly.  These Hands will gird up their loins 
to champion the Faith of God, and will, in My name, the Self-Subsistent, 
the Mighty, subdue the peoples and kindreds of the 
earth.  They will enter the cities, and will inspire with fear the 
hearts of all their inhabitants.  Such are the evidences of the might 
of God; how fearful, how vehement is His might!"  
 
     One more word in conclusion.  Among some of the 
most momentous and thought-provoking pronouncements 
ever made by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, in the course of His epoch-making 
travels in the North American continent, are the following:  
"May this American Democracy be the first nation to establish 
the foundation of international agreement.  May it be the 
first nation to proclaim the unity of mankind.  May it be the first to 
unfurl the Standard of the Most Great Peace."  And again:  "The 
American people are indeed worthy of being the first to build the 
Tabernacle of the Great Peace, and proclaim the oneness of mankind....  
 
+P86 
For America hath developed powers and capacities 
greater and more wonderful than other nations....  The American 
nation is equipped and empowered to accomplish that which will 
adorn the pages of history, to become the envy of the world, and be 
blest in both the East and the West for the triumph of its people.  
...The American continent gives signs and evidences of very 
great advancement.  Its future is even more promising, for its influence 
and illumination are far-reaching.  It will lead all nations spiritually."  
     The creative energies, mysteriously generated by the 
first stirrings of the embryonic World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
have, as soon as released within a nation destined to become 
its cradle and champion, endowed that nation with the worthiness, 
and invested it with the powers and capacities, and 
equipped it spiritually, to play the part foreshadowed in 
these prophetic words.  The potencies which this God-given 
mission has infused into its people are, on the one hand, beginning 
to be manifested through the conscious efforts and 
the nationwide accomplishments, in both the teaching and 
administrative spheres of &amp;Baha'i activity, of the organized 
community of the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the North 
American continent.  These same potencies, apart from, yet 
collateral with these efforts and accomplishments, are, on 
the other hand, insensibly shaping, under the impact of the 
world political and economic forces, the destiny of that nation, 
and are influencing the lives and actions of both its 
government and its people.  
     To the efforts and accomplishments of those who, 
aware of the Revelation of &amp;Baha'u'llah, are now laboring in 
that continent, to their present and future course of activity, 
I have, in the foregoing pages sufficiently referred.  A word, 
if the destiny of the American people, in its entirety, is to be 
correctly apprehended, should now be said regarding the 
orientation of that nation as a whole, and the trend of the 
affairs of its people.  For no matter how ignorant of the 
Source from which those directing energies proceed, and 
however slow and laborious the process, it is becoming increasingly 
 
+P87 
evident that the nation as a whole, whether 
through the agency of its government or otherwise, is gravitating, 
under the influence of forces that it can neither comprehend 
nor control, towards such associations and policies, 
wherein, as indicated by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, her true destiny 
must lie.  Both the community of the American believers, 
who are aware of that Source, and the great mass of their 
countrymen, who have not as yet recognized the Hand that 
directs their destiny, are contributing, each in its own way, 
to the realization of the hopes, and the fulfillment of the 
promises, voiced in the above-quoted words of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
     The world is moving on.  Its events are unfolding ominously 
and with bewildering rapidity.  The whirlwind of its 
passions is swift and alarmingly violent.  The New World is 
being insensibly drawn into its vortex.  The potential storm 
centers of the earth are already casting their shadows upon 
its shores.  Dangers, undreamt of and unpredictable, threaten 
it both from within and from without.  Its governments 
and peoples are being gradually enmeshed in the coils of the 
world's recurrent crises and fierce controversies.  The Atlantic 
and Pacific Oceans are, with every acceleration in the 
march of science, steadily shrinking into mere channels.  The 
Great Republic of the West finds itself particularly and increasingly 
involved.  Distant rumblings echo menacingly in 
the ebullitions of its people.  On its flanks are ranged the potential 
storm centers of the European continent and of the 
Far East.  On its southern horizon there looms what might 
conceivably develop into another center of agitation and 
danger.  The world is contracting into a neighborhood.  
America, willingly or unwillingly, must face and grapple 
with this new situation.  For purposes of national security, let 
alone any humanitarian motive, she must assume the obligations 
imposed by this newly created neighborhood.  Paradoxical 
as it may seem, her only hope of extricating herself 
from the perils gathering around her is to become entangled 
in that very web of international association which the 
 
+P88 
Hand of an inscrutable Providence is weaving.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
counsel to a highly placed official in its government 
comes to mind, with peculiar appropriateness and force:  
You can best serve your country if you strive, in your capacity 
as a citizen of the world, to assist in the eventual application 
of the principle of federalism, underlying the government of 
your own country, to the relationships now existing between 
the peoples and nations of the world.  The ideals that 
fired the imagination of America's tragically unappreciated 
President, whose high endeavors, however much nullified 
by a visionless generation, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, through His own 
pen, acclaimed as signalizing the dawn of the Most Great 
Peace, though now lying in the dust, bitterly reproach a 
heedless generation for having so cruelly abandoned them.  
     That the world is beset with perils, that dangers are 
now accumulating and are actually threatening the American 
nation, no clear-eyed observer can possibly deny.  The 
earth is now transformed into an armed camp.  As much as 
fifty million men are either under arms or in reserve.  No less 
than the sum of three billion pounds is being spent, in one 
year, on its armaments.  The light of religion is dimmed and 
moral authority disintegrating.  The nations of the world 
have, for the most part, fallen a prey to battling ideologies 
that threaten to disrupt the very foundations of their dearly 
won political unity.  Agitated multitudes in these countries 
seethe with discontent, are armed to the teeth, are stampeded 
with fear, and groan beneath the yoke of tribulations 
engendered by political strife, racial fanaticism, national hatreds, 
and religious animosities.  "The winds of despair," &amp;Baha'u'llah 
has unmistakably affirmed, "are, alas, blowing from every 
direction, and the strife that divides and afflicts the human 
race is daily increasing.  The signs of impending convulsions and 
chaos can now be discerned...."  "The ills," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, writing 
as far back as two decades ago, has prophesied, "from 
which the world now suffers will multiply; the gloom which envelops 
it will deepen.  The Balkans will remain discontented.  Its restlessness 
will increase.  The vanquished Powers will continue to agitate.  
 
+P89 
They will resort to every measure that may rekindle the 
flame of war.  Movements, newly born and worldwide in their 
range, will exert their utmost for the advancement of their designs.  
The Movement of the Left will acquire great importance.  Its influence 
will spread."  As to the American nation itself, the voice 
of its own President, emphatic and clear, warns his people 
that a possible attack upon their country has been brought 
infinitely closer by the development of aircraft and by other 
factors.  Its Secretary of State, addressing at a recent Conference 
the assembled representatives of all the American Republics, 
utters no less ominous a warning.  "These resurgent 
forces loom threateningly throughout the world--their ominous 
shadow falls athwart our own Hemisphere."  As to its 
Press, the same note of warning and of alarm at an approaching 
danger is struck.  "We must be prepared to defend 
ourselves both from within and without....  Our defensive 
frontier is long.  It reaches from Alaska's Point Barrow to 
Cape Horn, and ranges the Atlantic and the Pacific.  When 
or where Europe's and Asia's aggressors may strike at us no 
one can say.  It could be anywhere, any time....  We have 
no option save to go armed ourselves....  We must mount 
vigilant guard over the Western Hemisphere."  
     The distance that the American nation has traveled 
since its formal and categoric repudiation of the Wilsonian 
ideal, the changes that have unexpectedly overtaken it in recent 
years, the direction in which world events are moving, 
with their inevitable impact on the policies and the economy 
of that nation, are to every &amp;Baha'i observer, viewing the developments 
in the international situation, in the light of the 
prophecies of both &amp;Baha'u'llah and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, most significant, 
and highly instructive and encouraging.  To trace 
the exact course which, in these troubled times and pregnant 
years, this nation will follow would be impossible.  We 
can only, judging from the direction its affairs are now taking, 
anticipate the course she will most likely choose to pursue 
in her relationships with both the Republics of America 
and the countries of the remaining continents.  
 
+P90 
     A closer association with these Republics, on the one 
hand, and an increased participation, in varying degrees, on 
the other, in the affairs of the whole world, as a result of 
recurrent international crises, appear as the most likely developments 
which the future has in store for that country.  
Delays must inevitably arise, setbacks must be suffered, in 
the course of that country's evolution towards its ultimate 
destiny.  Nothing, however, can alter eventually that course, 
ordained for it by the unerring pen of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  Its federal 
unity having already been achieved and its internal institutions 
consolidated--a stage that marked its coming of 
age as a political entity--its further evolution, as a member 
of the family of nations, must, under circumstances that 
cannot at present be visualized, steadily continue.  Such an 
evolution must persist until such time when that nation will, 
through the active and decisive part it will have played in 
the organization and the peaceful settlement of the affairs of 
mankind, have attained the plenitude of its powers and 
functions as an outstanding member, and component part, 
of a federated world.  
     The immediate future must, as a result of this steady, 
this gradual, and inevitable absorption in the manifold perplexities 
and problems afflicting humanity, be dark and oppressive 
for that nation.  The world-shaking ordeal which 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, as quoted in the foregoing pages, has so graphically 
prophesied, may find it swept, to an unprecedented 
degree, into its vortex.  Out of it it will probably emerge, unlike 
its reactions to the last world conflict, consciously determined 
to seize its opportunity, to bring the full weight of its 
influence to bear upon the gigantic problems that such an 
ordeal must leave in its wake, and to exorcise forever, in 
conjunction with its sister nations of both the East and the 
West, the greatest curse which, from time immemorial, has 
afflicted and degraded the human race.  
     Then, and only then, will the American nation, molded 
and purified in the crucible of a common war, inured to its 
rigors, and disciplined by its lessons, be in a position to raise 
 
+P91 
its voice in the councils of the nations, itself lay the cornerstone 
of a universal and enduring peace, proclaim the solidarity, 
the unity, and maturity of mankind, and assist in the 
establishment of the promised reign of righteousness on 
earth.  Then, and only then, will the American nation, while 
the community of the American believers within its heart is 
consummating its divinely appointed mission, be able to fulfill 
the unspeakably glorious destiny ordained for it by the 
Almighty, and immortally enshrined in the writings of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
Then, and only then, will the American nation accomplish 
"that which will adorn the pages of history," "become 
the envy of the world and be blest in both the East and the West."
