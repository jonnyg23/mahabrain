Believers' Generous Response to Temple Fund 
 
     Thrilled by generous response of believers to Temple Fund.  Deeply 
touched.  Hail latest striking evidence of the magnificent spirit, unshakable 
solidarity and unflinching resolve of American &amp;Baha'i Community.  
Deepest loving gratitude.  
 
[January 20, 1947] 
 
 
Call to Fuller Participation 
 
     Acclaim with grateful heart evidences of steadily accelerating 
movement of pioneers, multiplication of conferences, consolidation of 
activities of national committees, progress in preliminaries of internal 
ornamentation of Temple, and formulation of teaching policy in 
southern states.  Overwhelmed by tributes paid my own humble efforts 
by stalwart company whose championship of Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
during last quarter century provided greatest support and solace, 
enabling me to sustain the weight of cares and responsibilities of 
Guardianship.  
     Impelled to plead afresh to ponder responsibilities incurred in 
transatlantic field of service.  Time is flying.  First year of Second Seven 
Year Plan is drawing to a close.  Shadow of war's tragic aftermath is 
deepening.  Initial stage of colossal task undertaken in European continent 
still in balance.  Urge stress for entire community extreme urgency 
to reinforce promptly, at whatever cost, however inadequate the instruments, 
the number of volunteers, both settlers and itinerant teachers, 
whom posterity will rightly recognize as vanguard of torch-bearers of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's resistless, world-redeeming order to despairing millions of 
diversified races, conflicting nationalities in darkest, most severely 
tested, spiritually depleted continent of globe.  Prayerfully awaiting 
response by all ranks of community to supreme call to fuller participation 
in glorious enterprise.

+P2 
Consolidation in Europe 
 
     Overjoyed, grateful, proud of notable expansion of manifold activities 
in three continents.  Vital significance of preeminent objective in 
European continent cannot be overemphasized.  Intense, sustained, 
self-sacrificing efforts aimed at rapid consolidation of American Community's 
recently initiated fate-laden transatlantic enterprise are urgent, 
imperative, highly meritorious.  Praying for such demonstration of 
heroism as will outshine exploits illuminating pages of American &amp;Baha'i 
history in continents of Western Hemisphere.

Participation in Second Seven Year Plan 
 
[MESSAGE TO 1947 CONVENTION] 
 
     My heart is filled with delight, wonder, pride and gratitude in 
contemplation of the peace-time exploits, in both hemispheres, of the 
world community of the followers of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, triumphantly 
emerging from the crucible of global war and moving irresistibly 
into the second epoch of the Formative Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  
     The opening years of the second century of the &amp;Baha'i Era, synchronizing 
with concluding stage of the memorable quarter-century 
elapsed since the termination of the Heroic Age of the Faith, have been 
distinguished by a compelling demonstration by the entire body of 
believers, headed by the valorous American &amp;Baha'i Community, of 
solidarity, resolve and self-sacrifice as well as by a magnificent record of 
systematic, world-wide achievements.  
     The three years since the celebration of the Centenary have been 
characterized by a simultaneous process of internal consolidation and 
steady enlargement of the orbit of a fast-evolving Administrative Order.  
     These years witnessed, first, the astounding resurgence of a 
war-devastated &amp;Baha'i community of Central Europe, the rehabilitation of 
the communities in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands and the Far 
East; second, the inauguration of a new Seven Year Plan by the 
American &amp;Baha'i Community destined to culminate with the Centenary 
of the Birth of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Prophetic Mission, aiming at the 
 
+P3 
formation of three national assemblies in Latin America and the 
Dominion of Canada, at completion of the holiest House of Worship in 
the &amp;Baha'i world, and at the erection of the structure of the Administrative 
Order in ten sovereign states of the European continent; and 
third, the formulation by the British, the Indian and the Persian 
National Assemblies of Six Year, Four and One-Half Year, and Forty-Five 
Month Plans respectively, culminating with the Centenary of the 
&amp;Bab's Martyrdom and pledged to establish nineteen spiritual assemblies 
in the British Isles, double the number of assemblies in the Indian 
subcontinent, establish ninety-five new centers of the Faith in Persia, 
convert the groups in Bahrein, Mecca and Kabul into assemblies and 
plant the banner of the Faith in the Arabian territories of Yemen, 
Oman, Ahsa and Kuweit.  
     Moreover, the number of countries opened to the onsweeping 
Faith, and the number of languages in which its literature has been 
translated and printed, is now raised to eighty-three and forty-seven, 
respectively.  Four additional countries are in process of enrollment.  
Translations into fifteen other languages are being undertaken.  No less 
than seventeen thousand pounds have accumulated for the international 
relief of war-afflicted &amp;Baha'i communities of East and West.  The 
&amp;Baha'i endowments on the North American continent have now passed 
the two million dollar mark.  The value of the endowments recently 
acquired at the World Center of the Faith, dedicated to the Shrines, are 
estimated at thirty-five thousand pounds.  &amp;Baha'i literature has been 
disseminated as far north as Upernavik, Greenland, above the Arctic 
Circle.  The &amp;Baha'i message has been broadcast by radio as far south as 
Magallanes.  The area of land dedicated to the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of 
Persia has increased by almost a quarter-million square meters.  The 
number of localities in the Antipodes where &amp;Baha'is reside has been 
raised to thirty-five, spread over Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania.  
Twenty-seven assemblies are functioning in Latin America.  In 
over a hundred localities &amp;Baha'is are resident in Central and South 
America, almost double the localities at opening of the first Seven Year 
Plan.  Historic Latin American conferences have been held in Buenos 
Aires and Panama.  Summer schools are established in Argentina and 
Chile.  Land has been offered in Chile for site of the first 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of Latin America.  Additional assemblies have been 
incorporated in Paraguay and Colombia.  Seven others are in process of 
 
+P4 
incorporation.  A notable impetus has been lent this world-redeeming 
Message through the concerted measures devised by the American 
National Assembly designed to proclaim the Faith to the masses 
through public conferences, press and radio.  
     Such remarkable multiplication of dynamic institutions, such thrilling 
deployment of world-regenerating forces, North, South, East and 
West, endow the preeminent goal of the Second Seven Year Plan in 
Europe with extraordinary urgency and peculiar significance.  I am 
impelled to appeal to all American believers possessing independent 
means to arise and supplement the course of the second year of the 
Second Seven Year Plan through personal participation or appointment 
of deputies, the superb exertions of the heroic vanguard of the hosts 
destined, through successive decades, to achieve the spiritual conquest 
of the continent unconquered by &amp;Islam, rightly regarded as the mother 
of Christendom, the fountainhead of American culture, the mainspring 
of western civilization, and the recipient of the unique honor of two 
successive visits to its shores by the Center of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant.  
 
[April 28, 1947] 
 
 
NSA Must Control Credentials of Foreigners 
 
     Owing to arrival of disloyal so-called &amp;Baha'is your Assembly's 
control of credentials should be strictly exercised, otherwise corruptive 
influences will spread and injure the magnificent services being 
achieved by the American &amp;Baha'i Community.  
 
[Circa June 1947] 
 
 
The Challenging Requirements of the Present Hour 

     The opening years of the second century of the &amp;Baha'i Era have 
synchronized with the termination of the first epoch of the Formative 
Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation, a Dispensation which posterity will 
recognize as the most glorious and momentous in the greatest cycle in 
the world's religious history.  
     The first seventy-seven years of the preceding century, constituting 
the Apostolic and Heroic Age of our Faith, fell into three distinct 
 
+P5 
epochs, of nine, of thirty-nine and of twenty-nine years' duration, 
associated respectively with the &amp;Babi Dispensation and the ministries of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah and of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  This Primitive Age of the &amp;Baha'i Era, 
unapproached in spiritual fecundity by any period associated with the 
mission of the Founder of any previous Dispensation, was impregnated, 
from its inception to its termination, with the creative energies generated 
through the advent of two independent Manifestations and the 
establishment of a Covenant unique in the spiritual annals of mankind.  
     The last twenty-three years of that same century coincided with the 
first epoch of the second, the Iron and Formative, Age of the Dispensation 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah--the first of a series of epochs which must precede 
the inception of the last and Golden Age of that Dispensation--a 
Dispensation which, as the Author of the Faith has Himself categorically 
asserted, must extend over a period of no less than one thousand 
years, and which will constitute the first stage in a series of Dispensations, 
to be established by future Manifestations, all deriving their 
inspiration from the Author of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation, and destined to 
last, in their aggregate, no less than five thousand centuries.  
     We are now entering the second epoch of the second Age of the 
first of these Dispensations.  The first epoch witnessed the birth and the 
primary stages in the erection of the framework of the Administrative 
Order of the Faith--the nucleus and pattern of its World Order--
according to the precepts laid down in &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Will and Testament, 
as well as the launching of the initial phase of the world-encompassing 
Plan bequeathed by Him to the American &amp;Baha'i Community.  
That epoch was characterized by a twofold process aiming at 
the consolidation of the administrative structure of the Faith and the 
extension of the range of its institutions.  It witnessed on the one hand, 
the emergence and the laying of the groundwork of that embryonic 
World Order whose advent was announced by the &amp;Bab in the &amp;Bayan, 
whose laws were revealed by &amp;Baha'u'llah in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, and 
whose features were delineated by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in His Will and 
Testament.  It was marked on the other hand by the launching, in the 
Western Hemisphere, of the first stage of a Plan whose original 
impulse was communicated by the Herald of our Faith in His 
&amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma', to whose implications the Author of the &amp;Baha'i 
Revelation alluded in His Tablets, and whose Charter was revealed by 
the Center of His Covenant in the evening of His life.  
 
+P6 
     The epoch we have now entered is destined to impart a great 
impetus to this historic, this twofold process.  It must witness, on the one 
hand, the consummation of a laboriously constructed Administrative 
Order, and, on the other, the unfoldment of successive stages in the 
development of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Plan beyond the confines of the Western 
Hemisphere and of the continent of Europe.  
 
CROWNING FEATURE OF ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER:  THE UNIVERSAL
HOUSE OF JUSTICE 
 
     During this Formative Age of the Faith, and in the course of 
present and succeeding epochs, the last and crowning stage in the 
erection of the framework of the Administrative Order of the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah--the election of the Universal House of Justice--will have 
been completed, the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Mother-Book of His Revelation, 
will have been codified and its laws promulgated, the Lesser Peace 
will have been established, the unity of mankind will have been 
achieved and its maturity attained, the Plan conceived by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
will have been executed, the emancipation of the Faith from the 
fetters of religious orthodoxy will have been effected, and its independent 
religious status will have been universally recognized, whilst in the 
course of the Golden Age, destined to consummate the Dispensation 
itself, the banner of the Most Great Peace, promised by its Author, 
will have been unfurled, the World &amp;Baha'i Commonwealth will have 
emerged in the plenitude of its power and splendor, and the birth and 
efflorescence of a world civilization, the child of that Peace, will have 
conferred its inestimable blessings upon all mankind.  
 
FOURFOLD OBJECTIVE TO PRESENT REQUIREMENTS 
 
     Not ours, however, to unriddle the workings of a distant future, or 
to dwell upon the promised glories of a God-impelled and unimaginably 
potent Revelation.  Ours, rather, the task to cast our eyes upon, and 
bend our energies to meet, the challenging requirements of the present 
hour.  Labors, of an urgent and sacred character, claim insistently our 
undivided attention during the opening years of this new epoch which 
we have entered.  The Second Seven Year Plan, intended to carry a 
stage further the mission conceived by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha for the American 
&amp;Baha'i Community, is now entering its second year, and must, as it 
operates in three continents, be productive of results outshining any as 
 
+P7 
yet achieved since the Divine Plan itself was set in motion during the 
concluding years of the first &amp;Baha'i century.  Unlike the plans which 
&amp;Baha'i communities in Europe and on the Asiatic continent have 
spontaneously inaugurated since the commencement of the present 
century, the Plan with which the community of the "Apostles of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah" stands identified is divine in origin, is guided by the 
explicit and repeated instructions that have flowed from the pen of the 
Center of the Covenant Himself, is energized by the all-compelling will 
of its Author, claims as the theater for its operation territories spread 
over five continents and the islands of the seven seas, and must continue 
to function, ere its purpose is achieved, throughout successive 
epochs in the course of the Formative Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  
As it propels itself forward, driven by forces which its prosecutors can 
not hope to properly assess, as it spreads its ramifications to the furthest 
corners of the Western Hemisphere, and across the oceans to the 
continents of the Old World, and beyond them to the far-flung islands 
of the seas, this Plan, the birthright of the North American &amp;Baha'i 
Community, will be increasingly regarded as an agency designed not 
only for the enlargement of the limits of the Faith and the multiplication 
of its institutions over the face of the planet, but for the acceleration 
of the construction and completion of the administrative framework 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah's embryonic World Order, hastening thereby the 
advent of that Golden Age which must witness the proclamation of the 
Most Great Peace and the unfoldment of that world civilization which 
is the offspring and primary purpose of that Peace.  
     The fourfold objective, which the prosecutors of the Plan, in the 
present early stage of its development, are now pursuing, and which is 
designed to stimulate the dual process initiated during the opening 
phase of the Formative Age of the Faith, must be strenuously and 
unfalteringly pursued.  The second year of the Second Seven Year Plan 
must witness, on all fronts, on the part of young and old alike, rich and 
poor, colored and white, neophyte and veteran, a rededication to the 
tasks undertaken and an intensification of effort for their furtherance 
wholly unparalleled in the annals of American &amp;Baha'i history.  In every 
state of the United States, in every province of the Dominion of 
Canada, in every republic of Central and South America, in each of the 
ten selected sovereign states of the European continent, the ever-swelling 
legions of &amp;Baha'u'llah's steadily advancing army, obeying 
 
+P8 
the Mandate of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, launched on the second stage of their 
world-wide crusade, deriving fresh courage from the exploits that have 
distinguished the opening phase of the present stage of their enterprise, 
must strain every nerve to scale loftier heights of heroism, and deploy, 
over a wider range, their divinely sustained forces, as their present Plan 
unfolds and moves towards a climax.  
 
GOALS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ALASKA 
 
     In the United States of America, the base from which the manifold 
operations of this holy expedition are conducted, the enterprise 
associated with the completion of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the 
West, designed to consummate this historic undertaking in time for the 
celebration of its Jubilee in the year 1953, must be strenuously pushed 
forward.  The prodigious efforts exerted for the erection of this noble 
edifice--the holiest House of Worship ever to be reared by the followers 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah--on which no less than one million four hundred 
thousand dollars have thus far been expended, and which will necessitate 
the expenditure of at least half a million more dollars, ere it is 
completed, must not, for one moment, be relaxed.  The necessary 
modifications of the design chosen for its interior ornamentation should 
be adopted, the plans and specifications prepared, the preliminary 
contracts for its execution placed, and actual construction work started, 
if possible, ere the expiry of the present year.  
     The utmost effort by the National Teaching Committee and its 
auxiliary Regional Teaching Committees, aimed at raising the number 
of spiritual assemblies in the North American continent to no less than 
one hundred and seventy-five, ere the expiry of the current year, should 
be exerted.  The eighty cities newly opened to the Faith should, 
likewise, be reinforced.  The two hundred and eighteen groups already 
constituted should be continually encouraged to evolve into assemblies, 
while the vast number of localities, totalling over nine hundred, where 
isolated believers reside, should, however tremendous the exertion 
required, be enabled to attain group status, and be eventually converted 
into properly functioning assemblies.  
     Collateral to this process of reinforcing the fabrics of the 
Administrative Order and of widening its basis, a resolute attempt should be 
made by the national elected representatives of the entire community, 
aided by their Public Relations, Race Unity, Public Meetings, Visual 
 
+P9 
Education, College Speakers Bureau and Radio Committees, to reinforce 
the measures already adopted for the proclamation, through the 
press and radio, of the verities of the Faith to the masses, and for the 
establishment of closer contact with the leaders of public thought, with 
colleges and universities and with newspaper and magazine editors.  
National advertising and publicity should be further developed, the 
contact with seven hundred and fifty newspapers, magazines and trade 
papers should be maintained and the public relations programs amplified.  
Association, as distinct from affiliation, and untainted by any 
participation in political matters, with the various organs, leaders and 
representatives of the United Nations and kindred organizations should 
be stimulated for the purpose of giving, on the one hand, greater 
publicity to the aims and purposes of the Faith, and of paving the way, 
on the other, for the eventual conversion of a selected number of 
capable and receptive souls who will reinforce the ranks of its active 
and unreserved supporters.  
     The process of the incorporation of properly functioning spiritual 
assemblies must be simultaneously and vigorously carried out.  The 
forty-five assemblies now incorporated are the first fruits of an enterprise 
of great significance, which must rapidly develop in the days to 
come, as an essential preliminary to the establishment, and the extension 
of the scope, of &amp;Baha'i local endowments, as soon as the financial 
obligations incurred in connection with the completion of the Temple 
have been discharged.  The institutions of the three summer schools, at 
Green Acre, Davison and Geyserville, and the International School at 
Temerity Ranch, as well as the activities of the &amp;Baha'i Youth, must, 
under the close supervision of their respective national committees, be 
continually expanded and increasingly utilized as agencies for the 
furtherance of the vital objectives of the Plan.  
     The beneficial and highly responsible activities undertaken by the 
Publishing, the Reviewing, the Library, the Service for the Blind, the 
Visual Education, the Pamphlet Literature and Study Aids Committees, 
designed to disseminate and insure the integrity of &amp;Baha'i literature, 
should, however indirectly connected with the purposes of the 
Plan, and within the limits imposed upon them through its operation, 
be steadily expanded, consolidated and be made to promote, in whatever 
way possible, its paramount interests.  
     Nor should the "spacious territory of Alaska," particularly mentioned 
 
+P10 
by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in His Tablets of the Divine Plan, and at 
present the northern outpost of the Faith in the Western Hemisphere, 
be ignored, or its vital requirements neglected.  The maintenance and 
consolidation of the first historic spiritual assembly in Anchorage, the 
northernmost administrative center of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the 
world; the multiplication of &amp;Baha'i centers in that territory; the propagation 
of the teachings among the Eskimos, emphasized by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
pen in those same Tablets; the translation and publication of 
selected passages from &amp;Baha'i literature in their native language; the 
extension of the limits of the Faith beyond Fairbanks and nearer to the 
Arctic Circle--these constitute the urgent tasks facing the prosecutors 
of the present Plan in the years immediately ahead.  
     "Alaska is a vast country," are &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's own words, recorded 
in those Tablets, "...Perchance, God willing, the lights of the Most 
Great Guidance will illuminate that country, and the breezes of the rose 
garden of the love of God will perfume the nostrils of the inhabitants of 
Alaska.  Should you be aided to render such a service, rest ye assured 
that your heads shall be crowned with the diadem of everlasting 
sovereignty."  
 
CANADA TO FORM SEPARATE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
 
     In the Dominion of Canada, to whose significance and future the 
Author of the Tablets of the Divine Plan has repeatedly referred, and 
in all the nine provinces of which, as a direct result of the operation of 
the first Seven Year Plan, the Faith has established its spiritual 
assemblies, the Canadian believers, as a token of their recognition of 
the significance of the forthcoming formation of their first National 
Spiritual Assembly, must arise and carry out befittingly the task allotted 
to them in their homeland.  Irrespective of the smallness of their 
numbers, notwithstanding the vastness of the territory for which they 
have been made responsible, and as a sign of their appreciation of the 
great bounty and independent status soon to be conferred upon them, 
they must, unitedly, exert a supreme effort to enlarge the limits, 
multiply the administrative centers, consolidate the institutions, and 
broadcast the truths and essentials of their beloved Faith throughout 
the length and breadth of that immense dominion.  
     The thirteen Canadian assemblies already formed should be, at all 
costs, maintained and fortified.  The fifty-six localities where &amp;Baha'is 
 
+P11 
reside should receive immediate attention, and the most promising 
among them should be chosen for the establishment of future assemblies, 
in order to broaden the basis and reinforce the foundations of the 
future pillar of the Universal House of Justice.  Particular attention 
should, moreover, be paid to the need for the establishment, without 
delay, of the first Canadian &amp;Baha'i summer school, which, as the scope 
of the activities of the Canadian believers extends, will have to be 
gradually supplemented by other institutions of a similar character, as 
has been the case in the development of summer schools in the United 
States of America.  Preliminary steps should, likewise, be taken for the 
incorporation of all firmly grounded spiritual assemblies, as a prelude to 
the establishment of local and national endowments.  The institution of 
the local Fund, in every center where the administrative structure of 
the Faith has been erected, should be assiduously developed.  The 
holding of conferences designed to foster the unity, the solidarity and 
harmonious development of the Canadian &amp;Baha'i Community should 
be steadily encouraged.  An organized attempt should be made to 
broadcast the Message to the masses and their leaders through the 
medium of the press and radio.  A deliberate and sustained endeavor 
should be exerted to win fresh recruits for the Faith from the ranks 
of the considerable French-speaking population of that dominion.  
The greatest care should be exercised to attract the attention, and win 
the support of other minorities in that land, such as the Indians, the 
Eskimos, the Dukhobors and the Negroes, thereby reinforcing the 
representative character of a rapidly developing community.  
     Nor should that community, as its local centers multiply, and the 
fabric of its national institutions is erected, and its maturity is 
demonstrated, and its independence vindicated, lose sight of, or neglect, the 
weighty provisions of those Tablets of the Divine Plan, addressed 
specifically to its members by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, wherein He confers upon 
them the mission of carrying the Message of His Father to territories 
and islands beyond the confines of that dominion, to Newfoundland 
and the Franklin Islands, to the Yukon, to Mackenzie, Keewatin, 
Ungava and Greenland.  The tentative steps recently taken by a Danish 
believer in disseminating &amp;Baha'i literature in the territory of Greenland, 
in a number of settlements and outposts beyond the Arctic Circle, and 
in dispatching &amp;Baha'i books to Godthaab, its capital, and as far north as 
Upernavik on Baffin Bay, constitutes a modest yet historic beginning 
 
+P12 
which the Canadian believers, in the light of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets 
addressed to them, must follow up in the years to come.  
     "Should the fire of the love of God be kindled in Greenland," He 
significantly assures them in one of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, 
"all the ice of that country will be melted, and its cold weather become 
temperate--that is, if the hearts be touched with the heat of the love of 
God, that territory will become a divine rose garden and a heavenly 
paradise, and the souls, even as fruitful trees, will acquire the utmost 
freshness and beauty.  Effort, the utmost effort, is required."  
     Theirs is the duty, the privilege and honor, once their central 
administrative institution is firmly established, its subsidiary agencies 
are vigorously operating, and its immediate requirements are met, to 
take preliminary measures, on however small a scale, ere the Second 
Seven Year Plan is terminated, for the dispatch of a handful of pioneers 
to some of these territories, as an evidence of the determination and 
capacity of a newly independent national community to assume the 
functions, and discharge the responsibilities with which it has been 
invested in those immortal Tablets by the pen of the Center of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant.  
     "There is no difference between countries," is &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's testimony 
in one of those Tablets.  "The future of the Dominion of Canada, 
however, is very great, and the events connected with it infinitely 
glorious.  It shall become the object of the glance of Providence, and 
shall show forth the bounties of the All-Glorious."  "Again I repeat," 
He, in that same Tablet affirms, "that the future of Canada is very 
great, whether from a material or a spiritual standpoint....  The 
clouds of the Kingdom will water the seeds of guidance which have 
been sown there."  
 
TASKS IN LATIN AMERICA 
 
     In the far-flung Latin American field, where the first fruits of the 
Divine Plan, operating beyond the confines of the North American 
continent, have already been garnered in such abundance, the Latin 
American &amp;Baha'i communities, from the Mexican border to the extremity 
of Chile, should bestir themselves for the collective, the historic and 
gigantic tasks that await them, and which must culminate, ere the 
expiry of the present Plan, in the formation of two national spiritual 
assemblies for Central and South America.  
 
+P13 
     The marvelous progress achieved as a result of the operation of the 
first Seven Year Plan, as evidenced by the establishment of full-fledged 
spiritual assemblies in the virgin territories of no less than fourteen 
republics, and the formation of active groups in the remaining republics,
has been enhanced by the even more startling expansion of 
&amp;Baha'i activity since the termination of the first stage of the Divine 
Plan.  As a result of this expansion spiritual assemblies have been 
established in all the remaining republics, the number of localities 
where &amp;Baha'is reside has been raised to over a hundred, almost double 
the number of localities in which the Faith had been introduced after 
the completion of the first Seven Year Plan, the number of spiritual 
assemblies has swelled to no less than thirty-seven, three of which have 
been duly incorporated, a notable impetus has been given to the 
activities of the distributing centers of &amp;Baha'i literature in Argentina 
and Panama, historic conferences have been held in these two republics, 
summer schools have been inaugurated in Argentina and 
Chile, and a tract of land has been presented as a site for the first 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in Latin America.  No community since the inception 
of the hundred-year-old Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, not even the community 
of the Most Great Name in the North American continent, can 
boast of an evolution as rapid, a consolidation as sound, a multiplication 
of centers as swift, as those that have marked the birth and rise of the 
community of His followers in Latin America.  
     The colossal tasks that now summon this Latin American &amp;Baha'i 
community to a challenge, cannot but dwarf, if faithfully and promptly 
accomplished, the magnificent achievements that have immortalized 
the first decade of organized activity in Latin American &amp;Baha'i history.  
The seed-sowing stage associated, in the main, with the labors and 
travels of that saintly soul, that star-servant of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
the incomparable Martha Root, links this decade of organized &amp;Baha'i 
activity in Latin America with both the closing years of the Heroic Age 
of our Faith and the first fifteen years of the initial epoch of the Age we 
live in.  
 
TWO REGIONAL NATIONAL ASSEMBLIES A VITAL OBJECTIVE 
 
     The emergence of organized local communities in most of the 
republics of Latin America will be forever associated with the exploits 
that have shed such luster on the first stage of the Divine Plan launched 
 
+P14 
during the concluding years of that first epoch of the Formative Age of 
our Faith.  The constitution of two independent duly elected national 
spiritual assemblies for the northern and southern zones of Latin 
America is now to be regarded as one of the most vital objectives of the 
Second Seven Year Plan, whose inauguration synchronizes with the 
opening years of the second &amp;Baha'i century, and which will be chiefly 
associated with the first phase of the second epoch of that Age.  The 
emergence of these two national assemblies, precursors of the institutions 
which must participate in the election, and contribute to the 
support, of the Universal House of Justice--the last crowning unit in 
the erection of the fabric of the Administrative Order of the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah--must lead gradually and uninterruptedly, and in the 
course of successive epochs of the Formative Age, to the constitution in 
each of the republics of Central and South America, of a properly 
elected, fully representative national assembly, constituting thereby the 
last stage in the administrative evolution of that Faith throughout Latin 
America.  
     In order that these future tasks may be carried out with dispatch, 
efficiency, harmony and in strict accordance with the administrative 
and spiritual principles of our Faith, the Latin American promoters of 
the present Seven Year Plan must focus their attention on the requirements 
of the present hour, close their ranks, reinforce the bonds of 
unity, of solidarity and of cooperation which unite them, rededicate 
themselves individually to the sacred, all-important and vital task of 
teaching, exert strenuous endeavors to deepen their knowledge of the 
history and fundamentals of their Faith, steep themselves in the spirit 
and the love of its teachings and acquire special training for future 
pioneer activity throughout the length and breadth of the vast stretches 
of territory which extend from the confines of the great republic in the 
north to the Straits of Magellan in the south.  
     The process of the steady multiplication of spiritual assemblies, 
already numbering thirty-seven, of groups whose number equals that of 
the assemblies, and of the forty localities where isolated believers reside, 
must vigorously and uninterruptedly continue.  The incorporation of 
well-grounded spiritual assemblies, following the example set by the 
spiritual assemblies of San &amp;Jose, Costa Rica, of &amp;Bogota, Colombia, and 
of &amp;Asuncion, Paraguay, as a preliminary to the incorporation of the 
future national assemblies to be established in Latin America, must be 
 
+P15 
strenuously and efficiently carried out.  A beginning, however modest, 
should be made in the direction of establishing local Funds, supported 
by native believers and designed to supplement the financial assistance 
extended by the parent community in North America, for the furtherance 
of pioneer activity, for the dissemination of &amp;Baha'i literature, for 
the maintenance of local &amp;Baha'i headquarters, for the gradual initiation 
of &amp;Baha'i endowments, such as the land offered for a &amp;Baha'i Temple in 
Chile, for the holding of conferences and of summer schools, for the 
creation of publicity agencies, and for the conduct and expansion of 
youth activities.  
     Strong and sustained support should be given to the vitally needed 
and meritorious activities started by the native Latin American traveling 
teachers, particularly in the pioneer field, who, as the mighty task 
progresses, must increasingly bear the brunt of responsibility for the 
propagation of the Faith in their homelands.  Full advantage should be 
taken of the facilities provided by the use of practical workshop courses 
in Latin American pioneering at the International School at Temerity 
Ranch.  The two summer schools in Azeiza and Santiago, as well as one 
planned in Vera Cruz, should be utilized, not only as centers for the 
acquisition of &amp;Baha'i learning, but as training grounds for pioneering 
among the Spanish and Portuguese speaking populations of all the 
republics of Latin America.  The regional conferences held in Buenos 
Aires and Panama should be followed by conferences of a similar 
character, at which a growing number of attendants from among the 
ranks of Latin American believers will assume an ever-increasing share 
of responsibility in the initiation and conduct of the affairs of a 
continually evolving community.  A deliberate effort should be made to 
increase, through correspondence teaching and its extension to all the 
Spanish speaking countries, the number of the active supporters of 
the Faith, so desperately needed in view of the vastness of the field, 
the mighty responsibilities that have been incurred, the smallness of 
the number of laborers, and the shortness of the time at their disposal.  
     Other agencies, such as publicity and advertising in the press, the 
multiplication of accurate and improved radio scripts, the extension of 
teaching projects through regional teaching committees, visual education 
and the organization of public meetings, should be fully utilized to 
capture the attention, win the sympathy, and secure the active and 
unreserved support of a steadily increasing proportion of the population 
 
+P16 
of the various Latin American republics.  The publishing activities of a 
constantly growing community should, likewise, be stimulated, their 
scope should be continually widened, the quality of &amp;Baha'i publications 
in Spanish, Portuguese and French be improved, and their dissemination 
over a wide area be insured.  The two Spanish bulletins, the one 
already published in Santiago and the other planned in San &amp;Jose, 
should, likewise, as an adjunct to &amp;Baha'i publications, be developed and 
widely circulated.  The contact established with the two hundred and 
forty-four Masonic Lodges should be reinforced by similar contacts 
with schools as well as business firms established throughout the 
various republics, for the sole purpose of giving further publicity to the 
Faith, and winning ultimately fresh recruits to the strength of its 
followers.  
 
IMPORTANCE OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS 
 
     Particular attention, I feel, should, at this juncture, be directed to 
the various Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants of the Latin 
republics, whom the Author of the Tablets of the Divine Plan has 
compared to the "ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula."  
"Attach great importance," is His admonition to the entire body of the 
believers in the United States and the Dominion of Canada, "to the 
indigenous population of America.  For these souls may be likened unto 
the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, who, prior to the 
Mission of &amp;Muhammad, were like unto savages.  When the light of 
&amp;Muhammad shone forth in their midst, however, they became so 
radiant as to illumine the world.  Likewise, these Indians, should they 
be educated and guided, there can be no doubt that they will become so 
illumined as to enlighten the whole world."  The initial contact already 
established, in the concluding years of the first &amp;Baha'i century, in 
obedience to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Mandate, with the Cherokee and Oneida 
Indians in North Carolina and Wisconsin, with the Patagonian, the 
Mexican and the Inca Indians, and the Mayans in Argentina, Mexico, 
Peru and Yucatan, respectively, should, as the Latin American &amp;Baha'i 
communities gain in stature and strength, be consolidated and extended.  
A special effort should be exerted to secure the unqualified 
adherence of members of some of these tribes to the Faith, their 
subsequent election to its councils, and their unreserved support of the 
organized attempts that will have to be made in the future by the 
 
+P17 
projected national assemblies for the large-scale conversion of Indian 
races to the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Nor should the peculiar position of the Republic of Panama be 
overlooked at the present stage in the development of the Faith in Latin 
America.  "All the above countries," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, referring to the 
Central American republics in one of the Tablets of His Divine Plan, 
has affirmed, "have importance, but especially the Republic of Panama, 
wherein the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans come together through the    
Panama Canal.  It is a center for travel and passage from America to 
other continents of the world, and in the future it will gain most great 
importance."  "Likewise," He moreover has written, "ye must give great 
attention to the Republic of Panama, for in that point the Occident and 
the Orient find each other united through the Panama Canal, and it is 
also situated between the two great oceans.  That place will become very 
important in the future.  The teachings, once established there, will 
unite the East and the West, the North and the South."  
     The manifold activities initiated since the launching of the first 
Seven Year Plan should, under no circumstances, be neglected or 
allowed to stagnate.  The excellent publicity accorded the Faith, and the 
contact established with several leaders in that republic should be 
followed up, systematically and with the greatest care, by the growing 
community within its confines.  The initial contact with the Indians 
should be developed with assiduous care and unfailing patience.  Furthermore, 
the strengthening of the bonds now being forged between 
the North American communities and their sister communities in 
Latin America must constitute, owing to the unique and central position 
occupied by that republic, one of the chief objectives of the 
Panamanian believers, the progress of whose activities deserves to rank 
as one of the most notable chapters of recent Latin American &amp;Baha'i 
history.  
     Nor should the valuable and meritorious labors accomplished since 
the inception of the first Seven Year Plan in Punta Arenas de Magallanes, 
that far-off center situated not only on the southern extremity of 
the Western Hemisphere, but constituting the southernmost outpost of 
the Faith in the whole world, be for a moment neglected in the course 
of the second stage in the development of the Divine Plan.  The assembly 
already constituted in that city, the remarkable radio publicity 
secured by the believers there, the assistance extended by them to the 
 
+P18 
teaching work in other parts of Chile, should be regarded only as a 
prelude to the work of consolidation which must be indefatigably 
pursued.  This work, if properly carried out, in conjunction with the 
activities associated with the assemblies of Santiago, &amp;Valparaiso and 
&amp;Vina del Mar, and the groups of Puerto Montt, Valdivia, Quilpue, 
Temuco, Sewell, Chorrillos, &amp;Mulchen and other smaller ones, as well 
as several isolated localities in that republic, may well hasten the advent 
of the day when the Chilean followers of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah will 
have established the first independent national spiritual assembly to be 
formed by any single nation of Latin America.  
 
&amp;BAHA'U'LLAH'S SUMMONS TO THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE 
 
     Whoever it may be among these Latin American communities who 
will eventually carry off the palm of victory, and win this immortal 
distinction, all without exception, and with equal zeal, must participate 
in this vast and collective enterprise which is engaging, in an ever-increasing 
measure, their attention and challenging their resources.  Let 
them remember that the Author of their Faith has in His &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas, 
the Mother-Book of His Revelation, singled out the company of 
the Presidents of their countries, together with those of the North 
American continent, and addressed them in terms that sharply contrast 
with the dire warnings and condemnatory words addressed directly and 
indirectly, to the King of Prussia, the French and Austrian Emperors 
and the Sultan of Turkey, who, together with those Presidents, are the 
only sovereigns and rulers specifically mentioned by Him in that Book.  
     "Hearken ye, O rulers of America and the Presidents of the 
Republics therein!" is His summons sounded in that mighty Charter of 
the future world civilization, "unto that which the Dove is warbling on 
the Branch of Eternity:  There is none other God but Me, the Ever-Abiding, 
the Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.  Adorn ye the temple of 
dominion with the ornament of justice and of the fear of God, and its 
head with the crown of the remembrance of your Lord, the Creator of 
the heavens.  Thus counselleth you He Who is the Dayspring of 
Names, as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.  The 
Promised One hath appeared in this glorified Station, whereat all 
beings, both seen and unseen, have rejoiced.  Take ye advantage of the 
Day of God.  Verily, to meet Him is better for you than all that whereon 
 
+P19 
the sun shineth, could ye but know it.  O concourse of rulers!  Give ear 
unto that which hath been raised from the Dayspring of Grandeur:  
Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Lord of Utterance, the All-Knowing. 
Bind ye the broken with the hands of justice, and crush the 
oppressor who flourisheth with the rod of the commandments of your 
Lord, the Ordainer, the All-Wise."  
     Let them ponder the honor which the Author of the Revelation 
Himself has chosen to confer upon their countries, the obligations 
which that honor automatically brings in its wake, the opportunities it 
offers, the power it releases for the removal of all obstacles, however 
formidable, which may be encountered in their path, and the promise 
of guidance it implies for the attainment of the objectives alluded to in 
these memorable passages.  
     To the eager, the warm-hearted, the spiritually minded and staunch 
members of these Latin American &amp;Baha'i communities who, among the 
followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah, already constitute the most considerable body 
of recruits from the ranks of the most deeply entrenched and powerful 
Church of Christendom; whose motherlands have been chosen as the 
scene of the earliest victories won by the prosecutors of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
Divine Plan; launched on their crusade for the spiritual conquest of the 
whole planet; the establishment of whose projected national spiritual 
assemblies must constitute a notable landmark in the second epoch of 
the Formative Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation; whose leading spiritual 
assemblies are now establishing direct contact with the World Center 
of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the Holy Land; the photographs of whose 
elected representatives, at their chief centers, will soon adorn the walls 
of His Mansion at &amp;Bahji; a few of whose members have already arisen 
to carry back the torch of divine guidance entrusted to their care to the 
peoples and races from which they have sprung--to this privileged, this 
youngest, this dynamic and highly promising member of the organic 
&amp;Baha'i World Community, I feel moved, before I dismiss this aspect of 
my theme, to direct this general appeal to rise to the heights of the 
glorious opportunity which destiny is unfolding before its members.  
Theirs is the opportunity, if they but seize it, to adorn the opening pages 
of the annals of the second &amp;Baha'i century with a tale of deeds 
approaching in valor those with which their Persian brethren have 
illuminated the opening years of the first, and comparable with the 
 
+P20 
exploits more recently achieved by their North American fellow-believers 
and which have shed such luster on the closing decade of that 
same century.  
 
SPIRITUAL CRUSADE TO BE LAUNCHED IN EUROPE 
 
     To the fourth, and by far the most momentous, the most arduous, 
the most challenging task to be carried out under the Second Seven 
Year Plan--the systematic launching of a crusade in a mighty, a 
tormented, a spiritually famished continent, a continent drawn, in 
recent years through political developments as well as through improvement 
in the means of transportation, so close to the great republic of 
the West, and constituting a stepping-stone on the road leading to the 
redemption of the Old World--I must now direct the attention of my 
readers.  
     This as yet unfought and unbelievably potent crusade, embarked 
upon in the opening decade of the second century of the &amp;Baha'i Era, 
signalizing the commencement of the second epoch of the Formative 
Age of the Dispensation of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and marking the first stage in 
the propulsion of a divinely conceived Plan across the borders of the 
Western Hemisphere, must, as its pace augments, reveal the first signs 
and tokens which, as anticipated by the Author of the Plan Himself, 
must accompany the carrying of His Father's Message across the ocean, 
at the hands of His "apostles," from the shores of their homeland to the 
European continent.  "The moment," is His powerfully sustaining, 
gloriously inspiring promise, "this Divine Message is carried forward by 
the American believers from the shores of America, and is propagated 
through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa and of Australia, 
and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself 
securely established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion.  Then 
will all the peoples of the world witness that this community is 
spiritually illumined and divinely guided.  Then will the whole earth 
resound with the praises of its majesty and greatness."  
     The first stage in this transatlantic field of service which those 
crusading for the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the Western Hemisphere are 
now entering is a step fraught with possibilities such as no mind can 
adequately envisage.  Its challenge is overwhelming and its potentialities 
unfathomable.  Its hazards, rigors and pitfalls are numerous, its 
field immense, the number of its promoters as yet utterly inadequate, 
 
+P21 
the resources required for its effective prosecution barely tapped.  The 
races, nations and classes included within its orbit are numerous and 
highly diversified, and the prizes to be won by its victors incalculably 
great.  The hatreds that inflame, the rivalries that agitate, the controversies 
that confuse, the miseries that afflict, these races, nations and 
classes are bitter and of long standing.  The influence and fanaticism, 
whether ecclesiastical or political, of potentially hostile organizations, 
firmly entrenched within their ancestral strongholds, are formidable.  
     The members of the North American &amp;Baha'i Community, to whose 
care the immediate destinies of this fate-laden crusade have been 
entrusted, are standing at a new crossroads.  Behind them is an imperishable 
record, brief yet illustrious, of feats performed over the entire 
range of the Western Hemisphere.  Before them stretches a vista 
alluring in its as yet hazy outlines, entrancing in its magnitude, 
reaching to the far horizons of as yet unconquered territories.  They can 
look back, since that crusade was launched, upon a decade of modest 
beginnings, of toilsome labors, of richly deserved rewards.  They now 
look forward to successive epochs reaching as far as the fringes of that 
Golden Age that is to be, glowing in the light of God-given promises, 
destined to be traversed at the cost of infinite toil and of heroic 
self-sacrifice.  
     They can neither retrace their steps, nor falter, nor even afford to 
mark time.  The sands are running out, the short span of six brief years 
intervening between the present hour and the termination of the 
second stage of the enterprise on which they have embarked will soon 
expire.  The hosts on high, having sounded the signal, are impatient to 
rush forward, and demonstrate anew the irresistible force of their 
might.  Europe, in the throes of the aftermath of a horribly devastating 
conflict, calls desperately, in one of the darkest hours of its history, for 
that sovereign remedy which only the Plan, conceived by a divinely 
appointed Physician, can administer.  Sister communities, in the north 
and in the heart of that continent, alive to the needs, the opportunities 
and the glorious mission of the vanguard of &amp;Baha'u'llah's crusaders, 
now landing on the shores of that agitated continent, are only too eager 
to reinforce the stupendous exertions that must needs be made for its 
ultimate redemption.  Nor will other sister communities further afield 
refrain, for a moment, from lending a helping hand, once the progress 
of this gigantic movement now set in motion is accelerated.  Above and 
 
+P22 
beyond them all, unsleeping, ever-solicitous, unerring, is the Pilot of 
their bark, the Charterer of their course, the Founder of their spiritual 
fellowship, the Bestower of that primacy which is the hallmark of 
their destiny.  
 
EVOLVING STRONGHOLDS IN TEN INITIAL COUNTRIES 
 
     The ten countries, constituting the initial field wherein the prowess 
of these crusaders must, in the years immediately ahead, be exhibited, 
and in whose capitals the foundations of the embryonic Order of the 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah must preferably be unassailably laid, must each 
evolve into strongholds from which the dynamic energies of that Faith 
can be diffused to neighboring territories in the course of the unfoldment 
of the Plan.  The nuclei that are now being formed, and the 
groups that are beginning to emerge, must be speedily and systematically 
reinforced, not only through the dispatch and settlement of 
pioneers and the visits paid them by itinerant teachers, but also through 
the progressive development of the teaching work which the pioneers 
themselves must initiate and foster among the native population in 
those countries.  Any artificially created assembly, consisting of settlers 
from abroad, can at best be considered as temporary and insecure, and 
should, if the second stage of the European enterprise is to be commenced 
without undue delay in the future, be supplanted by broad-based, 
securely grounded, efficiently functioning assemblies, composed 
primarily of the people of the countries themselves, who are firm 
in faith, unimpeachable in their loyalty and whole-hearted in their 
support of the Administrative Order of the Faith.  The twenty-five 
pioneers that have already proceeded to Scandinavia and the Low 
Countries, to the Iberian Peninsula, to Switzerland and Italy, should, in 
the course of this current year, and while the process of teaching the 
native population is being inaugurated, be reinforced by as many 
additional pioneers as possible, and particularly by those who, possessed 
of independent means, can, either themselves or through their appointed 
deputies, swell the number of the valiant workers already 
laboring with such devotion in those fields.  
     The translation, the publication and dissemination of &amp;Baha'i literature, 
whether in the form of leaflets, pamphlets or books, in the nine 
selected languages, should, as the work progresses and the demand is 
correspondingly increased, be strenuously carried out, as a preliminary 
 
+P23 
to its free distribution among the public on certain occasions, and its 
presentation to both the leaders of public thought and the numerous 
and famous libraries established in those countries.  No time should be 
lost in establishing, on however small a scale, initial contact with the 
press and other agencies designed to invite greater attention on the part 
of the masses to the historic work now being initiated in their respective 
countries.  
     No opportunity, in view of the necessity of insuring the harmonious 
development of the Faith, should be ignored, which its potential 
enemies, whether ecclesiastical or otherwise, may offer, to set forth, in a 
restrained and unprovocative language, its aims and tenets, to defend 
its interests, to proclaim its universality, to assert the supernatural, the 
supra-national and non-political character of its institutions, and its 
acceptance of the divine origin of the Faiths which have preceded it.  
Nor should any chance be missed of associating the Faith, as distinct 
from affiliating it, with all progressive, non-political, non-ecclesiastical 
institutions, whether social, educational, or charitable, whose objectives 
harmonize with some of its tenets, and amongst whose members and 
supporters individuals may be found who will eventually embrace its 
truth.  Particular attention should, moreover, be paid to attendance at 
congresses and conferences, and to any contacts that can be made with 
colleges and universities which offer a fertile field for the scattering of 
the seeds of the Faith, and afford opportunities for broadcasting its 
message, and for winning fresh recruits to its strength.  
     Nor should any occasion be neglected by the pioneers of attending, 
if their personal circumstances permit, either the British or German 
&amp;Baha'i summer schools, and of forging such links with these institutions 
as will not only assist them in the discharge of their duties, but enable 
them to initiate, when the time is ripe, an institution of a similar 
character, under the auspices of the European Teaching Committee
--an institution which will be the forerunner of the summer schools 
that will have to be founded separately by the future assemblies 
in their respective countries.  Above all, any assistance which the two 
national spiritual assemblies, already established on that continent, and 
their auxiliary committees, and particularly their publishing agencies, 
can extend should be gratefully welcomed and utilized to the full, until 
such time as the institutions destined to evolve in these countries can 
assume independently the conduct of their own affairs.  
 
+P24 
     A constant interchange of news between the centers, through the 
medium of the Geneva Bulletin, whose scope must be steadily enlarged, 
and close contact with each other through the European office 
of the European Teaching Committee, functioning as an adjunct to the 
International &amp;Baha'i Bureau, should, furthermore, be maintained and 
reinforced, whenever circumstances are favorable, by the convening of 
conferences, which will bring together as many pioneers laboring in 
these ten countries, and newly converted believers, as possible, enabling 
them to jointly consider their plans, problems and activities, 
concert measures for the progress of the Faith in that continent, and 
pave the way for the future formation of regional national spiritual 
assemblies, which must precede the constitution of separate independent 
national institutions in each of these countries.  Such summer 
schools and conferences, initiated and conducted by one of the most 
important agencies of the highest administrative institution in the 
North American &amp;Baha'i Community, gathering together as they will 
&amp;Baha'i representatives of various races and nations on the continent of 
Europe, will, by reason of their unprecedented character in the evolution 
of the Faith, since its inception, constitute a historic landmark in 
the development of the organic world-wide &amp;Baha'i community, and 
will be the harbinger of those epoch-making world conferences, at 
which the representatives of the nations and races within the &amp;Baha'i 
fold will convene for the strengthening of the spiritual and administrative 
bonds that unite its members.  
 
INITIATING NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS AND ADAPTING TEACHING
METHODS 
 
     A beginning, however limited in scope, should be made, ere the 
present stage of the Divine Plan draws to a close, in the direction of 
establishing befitting administrative headquarters for the rising communities 
and their projected assemblies in the capital cities of Stockholm, 
of Oslo, of Copenhagen, of The Hague, of Brussels, of Luxembourg, 
of Madrid, of Lisbon, of Rome and of Bern, through the rental 
of suitable quarters which, in the course of time, must lead to either the 
construction or the purchase in each of these capitals of a national 
&amp;Haziratu'l-Quds, as a future seat for independent, elected national 
spiritual assemblies.  
     A tentative start, though strictly speaking excluded from the scope 
 
+P25 
of the present Plan, should, I feel, be made, ere the six remaining years 
have run their course, aiming at the formation, in each of the ten 
designated countries, of a number of nuclei, however few, however 
unstable, which will proclaim to the entire &amp;Baha'i world the ability of 
the prosecutors of the Plan to exceed their allocated task, even as they 
surpassed, in the Latin American field, the goals which they had 
originally set before them.  Such a feat, if accomplished, would impart 
to my overburdened heart a joy that would equal the many consolations 
which a dearly loved community has showered upon me, in the past, 
by its signal acts, both within its homeland and abroad, since the 
passing of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
     Nor should any of the pioneers, at this early stage in the upbuilding 
of &amp;Baha'i national communities, overlook the fundamental prerequisite 
for any successful teaching enterprise, which is to adapt the presentation 
of the fundamental principles of their Faith to the cultural and 
religious backgrounds, the ideologies, and the temperament of the 
divers races and nations whom they are called upon to enlighten and 
attract.  The susceptibilities of these races and nations, from both the 
northern and southern climes, springing from either the Germanic or 
Latin stock, belonging to either the Catholic or Protestant communion, 
some democratic, others totalitarian in outlook, some socialistic, others 
capitalistic in their tendencies, differing widely in their customs and 
standards of living, should at all times be carefully considered, and 
under no circumstances neglected.  
     These pioneers, in their contact with the members of divers creeds, 
races and nations, covering a range which offers no parallel in either the 
north or south continents, must neither antagonize them nor compromise 
with their own essential principles.  They must be neither provocative 
nor supine, neither fanatical nor excessively liberal, in their 
exposition of the fundamental and distinguishing features of their 
Faith.  They must be either wary or bold, they must act swiftly or mark 
time, they must use the direct or indirect method, they must be 
challenging or conciliatory, in strict accordance with the spiritual 
receptivity of the soul with whom they come in contact, whether he be 
a nobleman or a commoner, a northerner or a southerner, a layman or a 
priest, a capitalist or a socialist, a statesman or a prince, an artisan or a 
beggar.  In their presentation of the Message of &amp;Baha'u'llah they must 
neither hesitate nor falter.  They must be neither contemptuous of the 
 
+P26 
poor nor timid before the great.  In their exposition of its verities they 
must neither overstress nor whittle down the truth which they champion, 
whether their hearer belong to royalty, or be a prince of the 
church, or a politician, or a tradesman, or a man of the street.  To all 
alike, high or low, rich or poor, they must proffer, with open hands, 
with a radiant heart, with an eloquent tongue, with infinite patience, 
with uncompromising loyalty, with great wisdom, with unshakable 
courage, the Cup of Salvation at so critical an hour, to the confused, 
the hungry, the distraught and fear-stricken multitudes, in the north, 
in the west, in the south and in the heart, of that sorely tried continent.  
 
EUROPE FEELS STIRRINGS OF SPIRITUAL REVOLUTION 
 
     The second century of the &amp;Baha'i Era has dawned.  The second 
stage of the Divine Plan has been launched.  The second epoch of the 
Formative Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation has opened.  The tragedy 
of a continent, so blessed, so rich in history, so harassed, is moving 
towards a climax.  The vanguard of the torchbearers of a world-redeeming 
civilization are landing on its shores and are settling in its 
capitals.  An epoch has commenced, inaugurating the systematic conquest 
of the European continent by the organized body of the "apostles 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah," destined to unfold its potentialities in the course of 
succeeding centuries, and bidding fair to eclipse the radiance of those 
past ages which have successfully witnessed the introduction of the 
Christian Faith into the continent's northern climes, the efflorescence 
of Islamic culture that shed such radiance along its southern shores, and 
the rise of the Reformation in its very heart.  
     The stage is set.  The hour is propitious.  The signal is sounded.  
&amp;Baha'u'llah's spiritual battalions are moving into position.  The initial 
clash between the forces of darkness and the army of light, as unnoticed 
as the landing, two milleniums ago, of the apostles of Christ on the 
southern shores of the European continent, is being registered by the 
denizens of the &amp;Abha Kingdom.  The Author of the Plan that has set so 
titanic an enterprise in motion is Himself mounted at the head of these 
battalions, and leads them on to capture the cities of men's hearts.  A 
continent, twice blessed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's successive visits to its shores, 
and the scene of His first public appearance in the West; which has 
been the cradle of a civilization to some of whose beneficent features the 
pen of &amp;Baha'u'llah has paid significant tribute; on whose soil both the 
 
+P27 
Greek and Roman civilizations were born and flourished; which has 
contributed so richly to the unfoldment of American civilization; the 
fountainhead of American culture; the mother of Christendom, and 
the scene of the greatest exploits of the followers of Jesus Christ; in 
some of whose outlying territories have been won some of the most 
resplendent victories which ushered in the Golden Age of &amp;Islam; which 
sustained, in its very heart, the violent impact of the onrushing hosts of 
that Faith, intent on the subjugation of its cities, but which refused to 
bend the knee to its invaders, and succeeded in the end in repulsing 
their assault--such a continent is now experiencing, at the hands of 
the little as yet unnoticed band of pioneers sent forth by the enviable, 
the privileged, the dynamic American &amp;Baha'i Community, the first 
stirrings of that spiritual revolution which must culminate, in the 
Golden Age that is as yet unborn, in the permanent establishment of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's Order throughout that continent.  
 
DIVINE PLAN CHALLENGES NORTH AMERICAN BELIEVERS 
 
     One word in conclusion to those to whom the Tablets of so 
stupendous a Plan have been addressed, to whose care the destinies of 
so prodigious an enterprise have been committed, and of whom such 
titanic efforts are now demanded.  I can do no better than recall, nor 
can I sufficiently emphasize, or refrain from quoting anew, those stirring 
and pregnant passages that illuminate the pages of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
epoch-making Tablets.  
     In one of these Tablets, addressed to the believers in the Northeastern 
States, these weighty and highly significant words are recorded:  
"All countries, in the estimation of the one true God, are but one 
country, and all cities and villages are on an equal footing...  
Through faith and certitude, and the precedence achieved by one 
over another, however, the dweller conferreth honor upon the 
dwelling, some of the countries achieve distinction, and attain a preeminent 
position.  For instance, notwithstanding that some of the 
countries of Europe and of America are distinguished by, and surpass 
other countries in, the salubrity of their climate, the wholesomeness of 
their water, and the charm of their mountains, plains and prairies, yet 
Palestine became the glory of all nations inasmuch as all the holy and 
Divine Manifestations, from the time of Abraham until the appearance 
of the Seal of the Prophets (&amp;Muhammad), have lived in, or migrated 
 
+P28 
to, or traveled through, that country.  Likewise, Mecca and Medina 
have achieved illimitable glory, as the light of Prophethood shone forth 
therein.  For this reason Palestine and &amp;Hijaz have been distinguished 
from all other countries."  "Likewise," is His remarkable disclosure, "the 
continent of America is, in the eyes of the one true God, the land 
wherein the splendors of His light shall be revealed, where the 
mysteries of His Faith shall be unveiled, the home of the righteous, and 
the gathering-place of the free."  
     To those of His followers, dwelling in that enviable and blessed 
continent, He has chosen to address these no less inspiring words, as 
recorded in one of those Tablets revealed in honor of the believers of 
the United States and Canada:  "O ye apostles of &amp;Baha'u'llah!  May my 
life be sacrificed for you!...  Behold the portals which &amp;Baha'u'llah 
hath opened before you!  Consider how exalted and lofty is the station 
you are destined to attain, how unique the favors with which you have 
been endowed...  My thoughts are turned towards you, and my 
heart leaps within me at your mention.  Could ye know how my soul 
gloweth with your love, so great a happiness would flood your hearts as 
to cause you to become enamored with each other."  "The full measure 
of your success," He, in another Tablet, addressed to the entire 
company of His followers in the North American continent these 
prophetic words:  "is as yet unrevealed, its significance unapprehended.  
Erelong ye will with your own eyes witness how brilliantly every one of 
you, even as a shining star, will radiate in the firmament of your 
country the light of divine guidance, and will bestow upon its people 
the glory of an everlasting life...  I fervently hope that in the near 
future the whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the results of your 
achievements.  The hope which &amp;Abdu'l-Baha cherishes for you is that 
the same success which has attended your efforts in America may 
crown your endeavors in other parts of the world, that through you the 
fame of the Cause of God may be diffused throughout the East and the 
West, and the advent of the Kingdom of the Lord of Hosts be 
proclaimed in all the five continents of the globe.  The moment this 
Divine Message is carried forward by the American believers from the 
shores of America, and is propagated through the continents of Europe, 
of Asia, of Africa and of Australia, and as far as the islands of the 
Pacific, this community will find itself securely established upon the 
throne of an everlasting dominion.  Then will all the peoples of the 
 
+P29 
world witness that this community is spiritually illumined and divinely 
guided.  Then will the whole earth resound with the praises of its 
majesty and greatness...  Know ye of a certainty that whatever 
gathering ye enter, the waves of the Holy Spirit are surging over it, and 
the heavenly grace of the Blessed Beauty encompasseth that 
gathering...  O that I could travel, even though on foot and in the 
utmost poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call of &amp;Ya-Baha'u'l-Abha 
in cities, villages, mountains, deserts and oceans promote the 
divine teachings!  This, alas, I cannot do.  How intensely I deplore it!  
Please God, ye may achieve it...  Thus far ye have been untiring in 
your labors.  Let your exertions henceforth increase a thousandfold.  
Summon the people in these countries, capitals, islands, assemblies and 
churches to enter the &amp;Abha Kingdom.  The scope of your exertions must 
needs be extended.  The wider its range, the more striking will be the 
evidence of divine assistance."  
 
DETACHMENT FROM THE PHYSICAL WORLD 
 
     "Now is the time," He no less significantly remarks in another of 
these Tablets, "for you to divest yourselves of the garment of attachment 
to this world that perisheth, to be wholly severed from the physical 
world, become heavenly angels, and travel to these countries.  I swear by 
Him besides Whom there is none other God that each one of you will 
become an &amp;Israfil of Life, and will blow the Breath of Life into the souls 
of others."  And lastly this glorious promise in another of those immortal 
Tablets:  "Should success crown your enterprise, America will assuredly 
evolve into a center from which waves of spiritual power will emanate, 
and the throne of the Kingdom of God, will, in the plenitude of its 
majesty and glory, be firmly established."  
     In one of the earliest Tablets addressed by Him to the American 
believers these equally significant words have been penned:  "If ye be 
truly united, if ye agree to promote that which is the essential purpose, 
and to show forth an all-unifying love, I swear by Him Who causeth 
the seed to split and the breeze to waft, so great a light will shine forth 
from your faces as to reach the highest heavens, the fame of your glory 
will be noised abroad, the evidences of your preeminence will spread 
throughout all regions, your power will penetrate the realities of all 
things, your aims and purposes will exert their influence upon the great 
and mighty nations, your spirits will encompass the whole world of 
 
+P30 
being, and ye will discover yourselves to be kings in the dominions of 
the Kingdom, and attired with the glorious crowns of the invisible 
Realm, and become the marshals of the army of peace, and princes of 
the forces of light, and stars shining from the horizon of perfection, and 
brilliant lamps shedding their radiance upon men."  
 
CONTRIBUTION OF THE WEST TO WORLD ORDER 
 
     In the light of these glowing tributes, these ardent hopes, these
soul-stirring promises, recorded by the pen of the Center of the Covenant, is 
it surprising to find that the Author of the Covenant Himself has, 
anticipating the great contribution which the West is destined to make 
to the establishment of His World Order, made such a momentous 
statement in His writings:  "In the East the light of His Revelation hath 
broken; in the West have appeared the signs of His dominion.  Ponder 
this in your hearts, O people, and be not of those who have turned a 
deaf ear to the admonitions of Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Praised."  
     &amp;Abdu'l-Baha Himself, confirming this statement, has written:  
"From the beginning of time until the present day the light of Divine 
Revelation hath risen in the East and shed its radiance upon the West.  
The illumination thus shed hath, however, acquired in the West an 
extraordinary brilliancy.  Consider the Faith proclaimed by Jesus.  
Though it first appeared in the East, yet not until its light had been 
shed upon the West did the full measure of its potentialities become 
manifest."  "The day is approaching when ye shall witness how, 
through the splendor of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah the West will have 
replaced the East, radiating the light of divine guidance."  "The West 
hath acquired illumination from the East, but, in some respects the 
reflection of the light hath been greater in the Occident."  "The East 
hath, verily, been illumined with the light of the Kingdom.  Erelong 
will this same light shed a still greater illumination through the potency 
of the teachings of God, and their souls be set aglow by the undying fire 
of His love."  
     Invested, among its sister communities in East and West, with the 
primacy conferred upon it by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan; armed with 
the mandatory provisions of His momentous Tablets; equipped with 
the agencies of a quarter-century-old Administrative Order, whose 
fabric it has reared and consolidated; encouraged by the marvelous 
 
+P31 
success achieved by its daughter communities throughout the Americas, 
a success which has sealed the triumph of the first stage of that 
Plan; launched on a campaign of vaster dimensions, of superior merit, 
of weightier potentialities, than any it has hitherto initiated, a campaign 
destined to multiply its spiritual progeny in distant lands and 
amidst divers races, the community of the Most Great Name in the 
North American continent must arise, as it has never before in its 
history, and demonstrate anew its capacity to perform such deeds as are 
worthy of its high calling.  Its members, the executors of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
Plan, the champion-builders of &amp;Baha'u'llah's embryonic Order, the 
torchbearers of a world-girdling civilization, must, in the years immediately 
ahead, bestir themselves, and, as bidden by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
"increase" their exertions "a thousandfold," lay bare further vistas in 
the "range" of their "future achievements" and of their "unspeakably 
glorious" mission, and hasten the day when, as prophesied by Him, 
their community will "find itself securely established upon the throne 
of an everlasting dominion," when "the whole earth" will be stirred and 
shaken by the results of its "achievements" and "resound with the 
praises of majesty and greatness," when America will "evolve into a 
center from which waves of spiritual power will emanate, and the 
throne of the Kingdom of God will, in the plenitude of its majesty and 
glory, be firmly established."  
     In every state of the United States, in every province of the 
Dominion of Canada, in every republic of Latin America, in each of the 
ten European countries to which its inescapable responsibilities are 
insistently calling it, this community, so blessed in the past, so promising 
at present, so dazzling in its future destiny, must, if it would guard its 
priceless birthright and enhance its heritage, forge ahead with equal 
zeal, with unrelaxing vigilance, with indomitable courage, with tireless 
energy, until the present stage of its mission is triumphantly concluded.  
 
THE WORKINGS OF TWO SIMULTANEOUS PROCESSES 
 
     How could it forfeit its birthright or mar its heritage, when the 
country from which the vast majority of its members have sprung, the 
great republic of the West, government and people alike, is itself, 
through experiment and trial, slowly, painfully, unwittingly and irresistibly 
advancing towards the goal destined for it by both &amp;Baha'u'llah 
and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha?  Indeed if we would read aright the signs of the 
 
+P32 
times, and appraise correctly the significances of contemporaneous 
events that are impelling forward both the American &amp;Baha'i Community 
and the nation of which it forms a part on the road leading them to 
their ultimate destiny, we cannot fail to perceive the workings of two 
simultaneous processes, generated as far back as the concluding years of 
the Heroic Age of our Faith, each clearly defined, each distinctly 
separate, yet closely related and destined to culminate, in the fullness of 
time, in a single glorious consummation.  
     One of these processes is associated with the mission of the 
American &amp;Baha'i Community, the other with the destiny of the 
American nation.  The one serves directly the interests of the Administrative 
Order of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, the other promotes indirectly 
the institutions that are to be associated with the establishment of His 
World Order.  The first process dates back to the revelation of those 
stupendous Tablets constituting the Charter of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Divine 
Plan.  It was held in abeyance for well-nigh twenty years while the 
fabric of an indispensable Administrative Order, designed as a divinely 
appointed agency for the operation of that Plan, was being constructed.  
It registered its initial success with the triumphant conclusion of the 
first stage of its operation in the republics of the Western Hemisphere.  
It signalized the opening of the second phase of its development 
through the inauguration of the present teaching campaign in the 
European continent.  It must pass into the third stage of its evolution 
with the initiation of the third Seven Year Plan, designed to culminate 
in the establishment of the structure of the Administrative Order in all 
the remaining sovereign states and chief dependencies of the globe.  
It must reach the end of the first epoch in its evolution with the 
fulfillment of the prophecy mentioned by Daniel in the last chapter of 
His Book, related to the year 1335, and associated by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha with 
the world triumph of the Faith of His Father.  It will be consummated 
through the emergence of the &amp;Baha'i World Commonwealth in the 
Golden Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  
     The other process dates back to the outbreak of the first World War 
that threw the great republic of the West into the vortex of the first 
stage of a world upheaval.  It received its initial impetus through the 
formulation of President Wilson's Fourteen Points, closely associating 
for the first time that republic with the fortunes of the Old World.  It 
suffered its first setback through the dissociation of that republic from 
the newly born League of Nations which that president had labored to 
 
+P33 
create.  It acquired added momentum through the outbreak of the 
second World War, inflicting unprecedented suffering on that republic, 
and involving it still further in the affairs of all the continents of the 
globe.  It was further reinforced through the declaration embodied in 
the Atlantic Charter, as voiced by one of its chief progenitors, Franklin 
D. Roosevelt.  It assumed a definite outline through the birth of the 
United Nations at the San Francisco Conference.  It acquired added 
significance through the choice of the City of the Covenant itself as the 
seat of the newly born organization, through the declaration recently 
made by the American president related to his country's commitments 
in Greece and Turkey, as well as through the submission to the 
General Assembly of the United Nations of the thorny and challenging 
problem of the Holy Land, the spiritual as well as the administrative 
center of the World Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  It must, however long 
and tortuous the way, lead, through a series of victories and reverses, to 
the political unification of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, to 
the emergence of a world government and the establishment of the 
Lesser Peace, as foretold by &amp;Baha'u'llah and foreshadowed by the 
Prophet Isaiah.  It must, in the end, culminate in the unfurling of the 
banner of the Most Great Peace, in the Golden Age of the Dispensation 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
 
A PARALLEL BETWEEN THE AMERICAN &amp;BAHA'I COMMUNITY AND THE
AMERICAN REPUBLIC 
 
     Might not a still closer parallel be drawn between the community 
singled out for the execution of this world-embracing Plan, in its 
relation to its sister communities, and the nation of which it forms a 
part, in its relation to its sister nations?  On the one hand is a community 
which ever since its birth has been nursed in the lap of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
and been lovingly trained by Him through the revelation of unnumbered 
Tablets, through the dispatch of special and successive messengers, 
and through His own prolonged visit to the North American 
continent in the evening of His life.  It was to the members of this 
community, the spiritual descendants of the dawn-breakers of the 
Heroic Age of our Faith, that He, whilst sojourning in the City of 
the Covenant, chose to reveal the implications of that Covenant.  It 
was in the vicinity of this community's earliest established center that 
He laid, with His own hands, the cornerstone of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar 
of the western world.  It was to the members of this community 
 
+P34 
that He subsequently addressed His Tablets of the Divine Plan, 
investing it with a spiritual primacy, and singling it out for a glorious 
mission among its sister communities.  It was this community which 
won the immortal honor of being the first to introduce the Faith in the 
British Isles, in France and in Germany, and which sent forth its 
consecrated pioneers and teachers to China, Japan and India, to 
Australia and New Zealand, to the Balkan Peninsula, to South Africa, 
to Latin America, to the Baltic States, to Scandinavia and the islands of 
the Pacific, hoisting thereby its banner in the vast majority of the 
countries won over to its cause, in both the East and the West, prior to 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's passing.  
     It was this community, the cradle and stronghold of the Administrative 
Order of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, which, on the morrow of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ascension, was the first among all other &amp;Baha'i communities 
in East and West to arise and champion the cause of that Order, 
to fix its pattern, to erect its fabric, to initiate its endowments, to 
establish and consolidate its subsidiary institutions, and to vindicate its 
aims and purposes.  To it belongs the unique distinction of having 
erected, in the heart of the North American continent, the first 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the West, the holiest edifice ever to be reared by 
the hands of the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah in either the Eastern or 
Western Hemisphere.  It was through the assiduous and unflagging 
labors of the most distinguished and consecrated among its itinerant 
teachers that the allegiance of royalty to the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah was 
won, and unequivocally proclaimed in successive testimonies as penned 
by the royal convert herself.  To its members, the vanguard of the 
torchbearers of the future world civilization, must, moreover, be ascribed 
the imperishable glory of having launched and successfully 
concluded the first stage of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan, in the concluding 
years of the first &amp;Baha'i century, establishing thereby the structural 
basis of the Administrative Order of the Faith in all the republics of 
Central and South America.  It is this same community which is once 
again carrying off the palm of victory through launching, in the first 
decade of the second century of the &amp;Baha'i Era, the second stage 
of that same Plan, destined to lay the foundations of the &amp;Baha'i 
Administrative Order in no less than ten sovereign states in the 
continent of Europe, comprising the Scandinavian states, the Low 
Countries, the states of the Iberian Peninsula, Switzerland and Italy.  
And lastly, to its enterprising members must go the unique honor and 
 
+P35 
privilege of having arisen, on unnumbered occasions, and over a period 
of more than a quarter of a century, to champion the cause of the down-trodden 
and persecuted among their brethren in Persia, in Egypt, in 
Russia, in &amp;Iraq and in Germany, to stretch a generous helping hand to 
the needy among them, to defend and safeguard the interests of their 
institutions, and to plead their cause before political and ecclesiastical 
adversaries.  
     On the other hand is a nation that has achieved undisputed 
ascendancy in the entire Western Hemisphere, whose rulers have been 
uniquely honored by being collectively addressed by the Author of the 
&amp;Baha'i Revelation in His &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas; which has been acclaimed by 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha as the "home of the righteous and the gathering-place of 
the free," where the "splendors of His light shall be revealed, where the 
mysteries of His Faith shall be unveiled" and belonging to a continent 
which, as recorded by that same pen, "giveth signs and evidences of 
very great advancement," whose "future is even more promising," 
whose "influence and illumination are far-reaching," and which "will 
lead all nations spiritually."  Moreover, it is to this great republic of the 
West that the Center of the Covenant of &amp;Baha'u'llah has referred as the 
nation that has "developed powers and capacities greater and more 
wonderful than other nations," and which "is equipped and empowered 
to accomplish that which will adorn the pages of history, to 
become the envy of the world, and be blest in both the East and the 
West for the triumph of its people."  It is for this same American 
democracy that He expressed His fervent hope that it might be "the 
first nation to establish the foundation of international agreement," "to 
proclaim the unity of mankind," and "to unfurl the Standard of the 
Most Great Peace," that it might become "the distributing center of 
spiritual enlightenment, and all the world receive this heavenly blessing," 
and that its inhabitants might "rise from their present material 
attainments to such a height that heavenly illumination may stream 
from this center to all the peoples of the world."  It is in connection with 
its people that He has affirmed that they are "indeed worthy of being 
the first to build the Tabernacle of the Great Peace and proclaim the 
oneness of mankind."  
 
THE UNITED STATES IS SIGNALLY BLEST 
 
     This nation so signally blest, occupying so eminent and responsible 
a position in a continent so wonderfully endowed, was the first among 
 
+P36 
the nations of the West to be warmed and illuminated by the rays of the 
Revelation of &amp;Baha'u'llah, soon after the proclamation of His Covenant 
on the morrow of His ascension.  This nation, moreover, may well claim 
to have, as a result of its effective participation in both the first and 
second world wars, redressed the balance, saved mankind the horrors of 
devastation and bloodshed involved in the prolongation of hostilities, 
and decisively contributed, in the course of the latter conflict, to the 
overthrow of the exponents of ideologies fundamentally at variance 
with the universal tenets of our Faith.  
     To her President, the immortal Woodrow Wilson, must be ascribed 
the unique honor, among the statesmen of any nation, whether of the 
East or of the West, of having voiced sentiments so akin to the 
principles animating the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and of having more 
than any other world leader, contributed to the creation of the League 
of Nations--achievements which the pen of the Center of God's 
Covenant acclaimed as signalizing the dawn of the Most Great Peace, 
whose sun, according to that same pen, must needs arise as the direct 
consequence of the enforcement of the laws of the Dispensation of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     To the matchless position achieved by so preeminent a president of 
the American Union, in a former period, at so critical a juncture in 
international affairs, must now be added the splendid initiative taken, 
in recent years by the American government, culminating in the birth 
of the successor of that League in San Francisco, and the establishment 
of its permanent seat in the city of New York.  Nor can the preponderating 
influence exerted by this nation in the councils of the world, the 
prodigious economic and political power that it wields, the prestige it 
enjoys, the wealth of which it disposes, the idealism that animates its 
people, her magnificent contribution, as a result of her unparalleled 
productive power, for the relief of human suffering and the rehabilitation 
of peoples and nations, be overlooked in a survey of the position 
which she holds, and which distinguishes her from her sister nations in 
both the new and old worlds.  
 
TRIBULATIONS ARE INEVITABLE 
 
     Many and divers are the setbacks and reverses which this nation, 
extolled so highly by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and occupying at present so unique 
a position among its fellow nations, must, alas, suffer.  The road leading 
 
+P37 
to its destiny is long, thorny and tortuous.  The impact of various forces 
upon the structure and polity of that nation will be tremendous.  
Tribulations, on a scale unprecedented in its history, and calculated to 
purge its institutions, to purify the hearts of its people, to fuse its 
constituent elements, and to weld it into one entity with its sister 
nations in both hemispheres, are inevitable.  
     In one of the most remarkable Tablets revealed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
passages of which have already been quoted on previous occasions, 
written in the evening of His life, soon after the termination of the first 
World War, He anticipates, in succinct and ominous sentences, the 
successive ebullitions which must afflict humanity, and whose full 
force the American nation must, if her destiny is to be accomplished, 
inevitably experience.  "The ills from which the world now suffers," He 
wrote, "will multiply; the gloom which envelops it will deepen.  The 
Balkans will remain discontented.  Its restlessness will increase.  The 
vanquished powers will continue to agitate.  They will resort to every 
measure that may rekindle the flame of war.  Movements, newly born 
and world-wide in their range, will exert their utmost effort for the 
advancement of their designs.  The Movement of the Left will acquire 
great importance.  Its influence will spread."  
     The agitation in the Balkan Peninsula; the feverish activity in 
which Germany and Italy played a disastrous role, culminating in the 
outbreak of the second World War; the rise of the Fascist and Nazi 
movements, which spread their ramifications to distant parts of the 
globe; the spread of communism which, as a result of the victory of 
Soviet Russia in that same war, has been greatly accelerated--all these 
happenings, some unequivocally, others in veiled language, have been 
forecast in this Tablet, the full force of whose implications are as yet 
undisclosed, and which, we may well anticipate, the American nation, 
as yet insufficiently schooled by adversity, must sooner or later experience.  
 
AMERICA TO EVOLVE UNTIL LAST TASK IS DISCHARGED 
 
     Whatever the Hand of a beneficent and inscrutable Destiny has 
reserved for this youthful, this virile, this idealistic, this spiritually 
blessed and enviable nation, however severe the storms which may 
buffet it in the days to come in either hemisphere, however sweeping 
the changes which the impact of cataclysmic forces from without, and 
 
+P38 
the stirrings of a Divine embryonic Order from within, will effect in its 
structure and life, we may, confident in the words uttered by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
feel assured that that great republic--the shell that enshrines so 
precious a member of the world community of the followers of His 
Father--will continue to evolve, undivided and undefeatable, until the 
sum total of its contributions to the birth, the rise and the fruition of 
that world civilization, the child of the Most Great Peace and hallmark 
of the Golden Age of the Dispensation of &amp;Baha'u'llah, will have been 
made, and its last task discharged.

European Pioneers and Temple Contract 
 
     Rejoice at evidences of continued vigorous activity.  Renew plea to 
believers possessing independent means to volunteer for European 
pioneer field, both settlers and itinerant teachers.  Eagerly awaiting 
response to Convention message.  Praying for placing of Temple contract 
before termination of current year.  Ardently supplicating unprecedented 
blessings for manifold, meritorious, magnificent services.  Deepest 
love.  
 
[July 13, 1947] 
 
 
Evidences of Notable Expansion 
 
     Greatly welcome evidences of a notable expansion of activities and 
increased intensification of efforts for publicity.  I urge believers and 
local assemblies to redouble their efforts in support of vital National 
Fund.  Praying ardently for realization of your highest hopes.  Appreciate 
action for preservation of Keith's grave.  Do not advise you to 
transmit further funds to Persia for the grave.  I appeal to North 
American believers to exert their utmost to insure the formation of 
required number of assemblies by next April.  Further sacrifices demanded, 
rich reward assured.  May entire body of American believers 
arise to fulfill their glorious destiny.  
     Abiding gratitude, deepest love.

+P39 
Effective Prosecution of Sacred Tasks 
 
     The steadily deepening crisis which mankind is traversing, on the 
morrow of the severest ordeal it has yet suffered, and the attendant 
tribulations and commotions which a travailing age must necessarily 
experience, as a prelude to the birth of the new World Order, destined 
to rise upon the ruins of a tottering civilization, must, as they intensify, 
increasingly influence the course, and, in some cases, retard the 
progress, of the collective enterprises successively launched in the 
opening years of the second &amp;Baha'i century, and in almost every 
continent of the globe, by the world-wide community of the organized 
followers of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  In the land of its birth long-standing 
political rivalries, combined with a steady decline in the 
authority and influence exercised by the central government, are 
contributing to the reemergence of reactionary forces, represented by 
an as yet influential and fanatical priesthood, to a recrudescence of the 
persecution, and a multiplication of the disabilities, to which a still 
unemancipated Faith has been so cruelly subjected for more than a 
century.  In the heart of the continent of Europe, still fiercer political 
rivalries, as well as the clash of conflicting ideologies, have prevented 
the unification, indefinitely retarded the national revival, multiplied the 
vicissitudes and rendered more desperate the plight, of a nation comprising 
within its frontiers the largest community of the adherents of 
the Faith on that continent--a community destined, as prophesied by 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, to play a major role in the spiritual awakening and the 
ultimate conversion of the European peoples and races to His Father's 
Faith.  In the subcontinent of India recent political developments of a 
momentous character have plunged its divers castes, races and denominations 
into grave turmoil, brought in their wake riots, bloodshed, 
misery and confusion, fanned into flame religious animosities, and well-nigh 
disrupted its economic life.  In the Nile Valley the outbreak of a 
widespread and virulent epidemic, following closely upon the political 
unrest and the severe economic crisis already afflicting its inhabitants, 
threatens to disorganize the life of the nation and to bring in its wake 
afflictions of an even more serious character.  In the Holy Land itself, 
the heart and nerve-center of the far-flung and firmly knit community 
of the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and the repository of its holiest shrines, 
already gravely disturbed by the chronic instability of its political life, 
 
+P40 
the religious dissensions of its inhabitants, and the ten-year-long strain 
and danger to which its people have been subjected and exposed, fresh 
perils are looming on its horizon, menacing it, on the one hand with the 
ravages of an epidemic that has already taken so heavy a toll of the lives 
of the people beyond its southern frontier, and threatening it, on the 
other, with a civil war of extreme severity and unpredictable in its 
consequences.  Subject to the same fundamental causes which have 
deranged the equilibrium of present-day society and corroded its life are 
to be regarded the privations, the restrictions and crisis which, to a 
lesser degree, are oppressing the peoples of Central and Southeastern 
Europe, of the British Isles and of certain republics of Central and 
South America.  
     In all these territories, whether in the Eastern or Western Hemisphere, 
the nascent institutions of a struggling Faith, though subjected 
in varying degrees to the stress and strain associated with the decline 
and dissolution of time-honored institutions, with fratricidal strife, 
economic upheavals, financial crises, outbreaks of epidemics and political 
revolutions, have thus far, through the interpositions of a merciful 
Providence, been graciously enabled to follow their charted course, 
undeflected by the cross-currents and the tempestuous winds which 
must of necessity increasingly agitate human society ere the hour of its 
ultimate redemption approaches.  
     In contrast to these sorely tried countries on the European, the 
Asiatic and the African continents, unlike her sister republics in either 
Central or South America, the great republic of the West--the homeland 
of that mother community which, fostered through the tender care 
of an ever-solicitous Master, has already proved itself capable of rearing 
in its turn such splendid progeny among the divers communities of 
Latin America, which bids fair to multiply its daughter communities in 
a continent of mightier potentialities--such a republic has been, to a 
peculiar degree and over a long and uninterrupted period, relatively 
free from the chronic disorders, the political disturbances, the economic 
convulsions, the communal riots, the epidemics, the religious 
persecutions, the privations and loss of life which, during successive 
generations, have in one way or another afflicted so many peoples in 
almost every part of the globe.  
     Singled out by the Almighty for such a unique measure of favor, 
suffered to evolve, untrammelled and unperturbed, within the shell of 
 
+P41 
its God-given Administrative Order, distinguished from its sister communities 
through the revelation of a Plan emanating directly from the 
mind and pen of its Founder, enriched already by so many trophies, 
each an eloquent testimony to its missionary zeal and valor in distant 
fields and amidst divers peoples, the Community of the Most Great 
Name in the North American continent must, sensible of the abounding 
grace vouchsafed to it by &amp;Baha'u'llah, resolve, as it has never 
resolved before, to carry out, however much it may be buffeted by 
future circumstances and the unforeseen ordeals which a heedless and 
chaotic world may still further experience, the mission confidently 
entrusted to its hands by an all-wise and loving Master.  
 
HEART-WARMING PROGRESS IN EUROPEAN ENTERPRISE 
 
     Already in the newly opened European field, where the first stage 
of its transatlantic missionary enterprise is now unfolding, the success 
which the vanguard of its army of pioneers has already achieved in 
several leading capitals of that continent is truly heart-warming and 
evokes intense admiration.  The broad outlines of the primary institutions 
heralding the erection of the administrative framework of the 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in no less than ten sovereign states of Europe can 
already be discerned--a powerful and signal reinforcement of the 
organized and progressive efforts exerted by the British and German 
communities on the northwestern limits of that continent and in its 
very heart.  In the Latin American field, where the structural basis of a 
rising Administrative Order has already been established, through the 
formation of firmly grounded assemblies in each of the republics of 
Central and South America, the stage is being set for the erection of 
those institutions which are to be regarded as the harbingers of the 
secondary Houses of Justice which, in each of these republics, must act 
as pillars, and assist in sustaining the weight, of the final unit designed 
to consummate the institutions of that order.  On the northern portion 
of that same hemisphere the stage is already set for the impending 
emergence of an institution which, however circumscribed its basis, 
must ultimately, directly participate in the measures preliminary to the 
constitution of the Universal House of Justice.  
     A community now in the process of marshalling and directing, in 
such vast territories, in such outlying regions, amidst such a diversity of 
peoples, at so precarious a stage in the fortunes of mankind, forces of 
 
+P42 
such incalculable potency, to serve purposes so meritorious and lofty, 
cannot afford to falter for a moment or retrace its steps on the path it 
now travels.  Its commitments, so vast, so challenging, so rich in their 
potentialities, in the North American continent, must, whatever betide 
it, be carried out, in their entirety and without the slightest reservation 
or hesitation.  The pledge to multiply the local administrative institutions, 
throughout the length and breadth of this continent must be 
honored, and the placing of the contract for the interior ornamentation 
of the holiest House of Worship ever to be erected to the glory of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah expedited.  Above all a prodigious effort, nationwide, sustained 
and wholly unprecedented in the annals of a richly endowed 
and spiritually blessed community, aiming at the immediate increase of 
the financial resources required for the effective prosecution of its 
manifold and pressing tasks, is required.  
 
TRIPLE CAMPAIGN OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE 
 
     The triple campaign, conducted in two hemispheres, comprising 
within the scope of its operation the entire territory of the North 
American republic, the Dominion of Canada, twenty republics of 
Latin America, and no less than ten sovereign states of the European 
continent, is indeed of critical importance.  Every phase of this threefold 
crusade, undertaken at the dawn of the second &amp;Baha'i century by the 
executors of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Will and the custodians of His Plan, must 
be accorded its due measure of consideration and its needs simultaneously 
and vigorously fulfilled.  The allurements of the glorious 
adventure in the Latin American field, the glittering prizes already won 
and the new ones within reach, must, at no time, obscure the issues, or 
retard the task confronting the prosecutors of the Plan in their homeland, 
or allow the interests of its assemblies, for the most part new and 
struggling, to be either neglected or forgotten.  Nor must the glamor of 
the still more recent and glorious adventure embarked upon across the 
Atlantic, within a turbulent, politically convulsed, economically disrupted 
and spiritually depleted continent, dim, in however small a 
measure, the radiance, or detract from the urgency, of the magnificent 
enterprises, whose first fruits in Latin America are only beginning to 
mature, in direct consequence of the initial operation of the Plan 
bequeathed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to the American believers.  
 
+P43 
     To the vital requirements of this Plan, at so critical a juncture, both 
in the fortunes of mankind in general, and of the Plan itself, to which 
detailed reference has been made in a previous communication, I need 
not again refer.  All I desire to emphasize is my fervent plea, addressed to 
both the administrators who, as the elected representatives of the 
community must devise the plans, coordinate the activities, and direct 
the agencies of a continually expanding community, and to those 
whose privilege it is to labor, at home and abroad, to insure the effective 
prosecution of these sacred tasks, to realize the propitiousness of the 
present hour, recognize its urgency, meet its challenge and appreciate 
its unique potentialities.  As the international situation worsens, as the 
fortunes of mankind sink to a still lower ebb, the momentum of the 
Plan must be further accelerated, and the concerted exertions of the 
community responsible for its execution rise to still higher levels of 
consecration and heroism.  As the fabric of present-day society heaves 
and cracks under the strain and stress of portentous events and calamities, 
as the fissures, accentuating the cleavage separating nation from 
nation, class from class, race from race, and creed from creed, multiply, 
the prosecutors of the Plan must evince a still greater cohesion in their 
spiritual lives and administrative activities, and demonstrate a higher 
standard of concerted effort, of mutual assistance, and of harmonious 
development in their collective enterprises.  
     Then, and only then, will the reaction to the stupendous forces, 
released through the operation of a divinely conceived, divinely impelled 
Plan, be made apparent, and the fairest fruit of the weightiest 
spiritual enterprise launched in recorded history under the aegis of the 
Center of the Covenant of &amp;Baha'u'llah be garnered.  
 
[October 25, 1947] 
 
 
Recognition of Preeminent Services 
 
     Highly gratified at unceasing, compelling evidences of exalted 
spirit of &amp;Baha'i stewardship animating American &amp;Baha'i Community, as 
attested by the alacrity of its national representatives in executing the 
first Temple contract, their promptitude in extending effective assistance 
to their Persian brethren, their vigilance in safeguarding integrity 
 
+P44 
of the Faith in the City of the Covenant and their vigor in prosecuting 
the national campaign of publicity.  
     In recognition of preeminent services continually enriching the 
record of achievements associated with preeminent community of the 
&amp;Baha'i world, I am arranging transfer of extensive, valuable property 
acquired in precincts of Shrines on Mount Carmel to name of Palestine 
Branch of American Assembly.  
     Happy to announce completion of plans and specifications for 
erection of arcade surrounding the &amp;Bab's Sepulcher, constituting the 
first step in the process destined to culminate in construction of the 
dome anticipated by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and marking consummation of 
enterprise initiated by Him fifty years ago according to instructions 
given Him by &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
 
[December 15, 1947] 
 
 
Critical Stage of Task on Home Front 
 
     I am deeply concerned at critical stage of task confronting North 
American Teaching Committee, constituting at this juncture the 
paramount objective of present Plan.  Owing to urgent, overriding 
importance of Committee's responsibility and to swiftly approaching 
time limit fixed for attainment of the goal of one hundred seventy-five 
assemblies, emergency measures carefully, promptly devised by national 
representatives of the community and wholeheartedly supported 
by entire mass of the believers of the North American continent, 
designed to safeguard the existing assemblies and rapidly multiply their 
number, are imperative.  The placing of further contract for Temple, 
the reinforcement of basis of forthcoming Canadian National Spiritual 
Assembly, the additional consolidation of the institutions of the Faith 
in Latin America, the wider proclamation of its message to the masses, 
even the multiplication of pioneers in the European field, should be 
unhesitatingly subordinated to demands of the one disconcerting aspect 
of an otherwise successfully conducted Plan.  I address this last-minute 
appeal to every single member of the community, the champion 
warriors in the army of &amp;Baha'u'llah, which since launching the Plan 
formulated by the Center of His Covenant never succumbed to defeat 
nor was thwarted in its purpose, to arise resolutely, volunteer instantly 
 
+P45 
to fill the gap in the main defenses of the home front and register total 
victory ere the termination of the second year of the Second Seven Year 
Plan.  Fervently praying for instantaneous, decisive response.  
 
[January 10, 1948] 
 
 
No Sacrifice Too Great 
 
     The gravity of the emergency facing the North American believers 
is unprecedented since the initiation of the Divine Plan and unparalleled 
in the history of the American &amp;Baha'i Community since &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
passing.  No obstacle is insuperable, no sacrifice too great for 
attainment of supremely important objective.  The eyes of her sister 
communities in every continent of the globe and of her daughter 
communities of Latin America, handicapped by a variety of adverse 
circumstances, are fixed upon the community of followers of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in North American continent who are enjoying the blessings 
of internal peace, adequate resources, administrative experience 
and organizing ability for their divinely appointed mission, expecting 
them to arise and avert the reverse which would mar the splendor of 
their record of unexampled stewardship.  I am moved to plead, at this 
eleventh hour, that the rank and file of the community, particularly the 
members resident in long-established leading strongholds of the 
Faith--New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington
--issue forth unhesitatingly, determinedly, sacrifice every interest, 
assume positions in the forefront of the struggle and emulate in 
the course of the first decade of second &amp;Baha'i century, opening years 
of the second epoch of Formative Age of the Faith, exploits of their 
spiritual progenitors, the dawn-breakers of the Heroic Age, which 
immortalized the dawn of the first &amp;Baha'i century.  The immediate 
fortunes of the Plan are precariously hanging in the balance.  The three 
months' interval is swiftly running out.  My heart aches at contemplation 
of the possibility of failure of the stalwart community to rise to the 
heights of the occasion.  I refuse to believe that its members, invested 
with unique apostolic mission of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, will shrink from meeting 
the most challenging requirement of the present hour.  
 
[February 1, 1948] 
 
+P46 
Prevailing Crisis 
 
     Hope is welling up in my anxious, overburdened heart that the 
North American &amp;Baha'i Community may yet emerge triumphant over 
the prevailing crisis, demonstrate its capacity to preserve its hard-won 
prizes and redeem its pledges through a further display of its qualities of 
unconquerable faith, unbreakable solidarity, dauntless valor and heroic 
self-sacrifice, and vindicate its right to primacy in the world community 
of the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  High water mark is still unattained 
notwithstanding the mounting tide of enthusiastic response displayed 
by an aroused community.  Dangerous passage now forded in this 
eleventh-hour campaign.  I am fervently praying that further intensification 
of effort, sustained, coordinated, consecrated and unanimously 
exerted, will sweep its members on crest of the wave to total 
victory.  I feel assured that cumulative efforts of participants in emergency 
campaign launched by entire community will increasingly attract 
the promised inflowing grace of the holy Author of its destinies, 
will demonstrate afresh its worthiness of the paternal care of its divine 
Founder, will win added commendation from its sister communities of 
the Eastern Hemisphere, deepen the admiration and inspire the emulation 
of its daughter communities in Latin America and the European 
continent, and strengthen the attachment and reinforce the brotherly 
affection of its Guardian.  
 
[February 13, 1948] 
 
 
Emergency Teaching Campaign 
 
     Greatly encouraged by the splendid progress of the tremendous 
drive initiated in response to my appeal.  The zero hour is inexorably 
approaching.  Nineteen additional settlers can and must be provided.  
Praying with increasing fervor for total success, complete victory.  
 
[April 6, 1948] 
 
 
Marvelous Acceleration 
 
[FIRST MESSAGE TO 1948 CONVENTION] 
 
     I am moved to share with assembled delegates of the fortieth 
American &amp;Baha'i Convention the following facts and figures testifying 
 
+P47 
to the present status of the World Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah and disclosing 
the marvelous acceleration in the double process of the extension of its 
range and the consolidation of the institutions of its Administrative 
Order in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres in the course of the 
first four years of the second &amp;Baha'i century.  
     The number of countries opened to the Faith total ninety-one.  
&amp;Baha'i literature is translated and printed in fifty-one languages.
Representatives of thirty-one races are enrolled in the &amp;Baha'i World 
Community.  Eighty-eight assemblies, national and local, are incorporated.  
The number of localities where &amp;Baha'is have established residence has 
been raised to over thirty in Australasia, to over forty in Germany and 
Austria, over sixty in the Dominion of Canada, over eighty in the 
Indian subcontinent and Burma, over one hundred in Latin America, 
over seven hundred in Persia and to over twelve hundred in the United 
States of America.  
     The value of international &amp;Baha'i endowments in the Holy Land 
and the Jordan Valley is estimated at over six hundred thousand 
pounds.  National &amp;Baha'i endowments on the North American continent 
are valued at over two million dollars.  The area of land dedicated 
to the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in Persia is approximately four million square 
meters.  The value of the national &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds in the capitals of 
India and Persia respectively is six hundred thousand rupees and fifty 
thousand pounds.  The area of land dedicated to the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar 
in South America is ninety thousand square meters.  The 
number of pieces of &amp;Baha'i literature sold and distributed in the course 
of one year in North America is over eighty thousand pieces.  The 
record of the number of visitors to the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in America 
in one year is over seventeen thousand and the total number of visitors 
since its erection is over one quarter of a million.  The number of 
states in the American Union formally recognizing &amp;Baha'i marriage 
certificates is now eight.  The number of national assemblies functioning 
in the &amp;Baha'i world is raised to nine through the formation of the 
first Canadian National Assembly, to be shortly reinforced through the 
constitution of two additional assemblies in South and Central America 
and the West Indies.  
     The second seven-year, the six-year, the four and one-half year, the 
six-year, the three-year, the five-year and forty-five month plans respectively 
launched by the American, British, Indian, Australasian, &amp;Iraqi, 
Canadian, and Persian National Spiritual Assemblies, some culminating 
 
+P48 
at the first Centennial of the birth of &amp;Baha'u'llah's mission, others 
the Hundredth Anniversary of the &amp;Bab's Martyrdom, are aiming at the 
establishment of three national assemblies in Canada and Latin America, 
the completion of the interior ornamentation of the Mother 
Temple of the West, the formation of spiritual assemblies in ten 
sovereign states of the European continent, the constitution of nineteen 
assemblies in the British Isles, doubling the number of assemblies in 
India, Pakistan and Burma, the reconstitution of the dissolved assemblies 
and the establishment of ninety-five new centers in Persia, the 
conversion of groups in Bahrein, the &amp;Hijaz and &amp;Afghanistan into 
assemblies, the formation of administrative nuclei in the Arabian 
territories of Yemen, Oman, Hasa and Kuweit; the formation of thirty-one 
groups and seven assemblies in Australia, New Zealand and 
Tasmania; the multiplication of centers in the provinces of &amp;Iraq, 
including the district of Shattu'l-Arab; the incorporation of the Canadian 
National Assembly; doubling the number of assemblies and 
raising to one hundred the centers in the Dominion of Canada; the 
constitution of nuclei in Newfoundland and Greenland and the 
participation of Eskimos and Red Indians in the local institutions of the 
Administrative Order.  
     Plans and specifications have been prepared, and preliminary 
measures taken, to place contracts for the arcade of the &amp;Bab's Sepulcher.  
Historic International &amp;Baha'i Congresses held in South and Central 
America and an inter-European Teaching Conference projected for 
Geneva paving the way for future World &amp;Baha'i Congress.  Recognition 
extended to the Faith by United Nations as international non-governmental 
body, enabling appointment of accredited representatives 
to United Nations conferences, is heralding world recognition 
for a universal proclamation of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
 
[April 16, 1948] 
 
 
Brilliant Achievements 
 
[SECOND MESSAGE TO 1948 CONVENTION] 
 
     Joyfully acclaim brilliant achievements transcending fondest hopes 
and setting the seal of complete victory on the stupendous labors 
undertaken by American &amp;Baha'i Community in the second year of the 
Second Seven Year Plan.  The constitution of the National Spiritual 
 
+P49 
Assembly of Canada, the heroic feat of raising to almost two hundred 
the number of spiritual assemblies in the North American continent, 
the marvelous expansion of the daughter communities in Latin America, 
the successful conclusion of the preliminary phase of the interior 
ornamentation of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, and the crowning exploit of 
the formation of no less than seven assemblies in the newly opened 
transcontinental field, endow with everlasting fame the second epoch 
of the Formative Age, immeasurably enrich the annals of the opening 
decade of the second &amp;Baha'i century, and constitute a landmark in the 
unfoldment of the second stage of the execution of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
Plan.  
     The primacy of the American &amp;Baha'i Community is reasserted, 
fully vindicated and completely safeguarded.  Recent successive victories 
proclaim the undiminished strength and exemplary valor of the 
rank and file of the community whether administrators, teachers or 
pioneers in three continents regarded as the latest links in the chain of 
uninterrupted achievements performed by its members in the council, 
and teaching field for over a quarter of a century.  I recall on this joyous 
occasion with pride, emotion, thankfulness, the resplendent record of 
stewardship of this dearly loved, richly endowed, unflinchingly resolute 
community, whose administrators have assumed the preponderating 
share in perfecting the machinery of the Administrative Order, whose 
elected representatives have raised the edifice and completed the 
exterior ornamentation of the Mother Temple of the West, whose trail-blazers 
opened an overwhelming majority of the ninety-one countries 
now included within the pale of the Faith, whose pioneers established 
flourishing communities in twenty republics of Latin America, whose 
benefactors extended in ample measure assistance in various ways to 
their sorely pressed brethren in distant fields, whose members scattered 
themselves to thirteen hundred centers in every state of the American 
Union, every province of the Dominion of Canada, whose firmest 
champion succeeded in winning royalty's allegiance to the Message of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, whose heroes and martyrs laid down their lives in its 
service in fields as remote as Honolulu, Buenos Aires, Sidney, &amp;Isfahan, 
whose vanguard pushed its outposts to the antipodes on the farthest 
verge of the South American continent, to the vicinity of the Arctic 
Circle, to the northern, southern, and western fringes of the European 
continent, whose ambassadors are now convening, on the soil of one of 
the newly won territories, its historic first conference designed to 
 
+P50 
consolidate the newly won prizes, whose spokesmen are securing 
recognition of the institutions of &amp;Baha'u'llah's rising World Order in 
the United Nations.  
     Appeal to members of the community so privileged, so loved, so 
valorous, endowed with such potentialities to unitedly press forward 
however afflictive the trials their countrymen may yet experience, 
however grievous the tribulations the land of their heart's desire may 
yet suffer, however oppressive an anxiety the temporary severance of 
external communications with the World Center of their Faith may 
engender, however onerous the tasks still to be accomplished, until 
every single obligation under the present Plan is honorably fulfilled, 
enabling them to launch in its appointed time the third crusade 
destined to bring glorious consummation to the first epoch in the 
evolution of their divinely appointed world mission, fulfill the prophecy 
uttered by Daniel over twenty centuries ago, contribute the major share 
of the world triumph of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah envisaged by the 
Center of His Covenant, and hasten the opening of the Golden Age of 
the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  
 
[April 26, 1948] 
 
 
Support the National Fund 
 
     Temple drawings received.  Approve design.  Urge that you proceed 
without delay to place Temple contracts.  
     I appeal to entire body of believers to arise and generously support 
the National Fund in hour of greatest need to insure uninterrupted 
progress in the ornamentation of the House of Worship which, as 
foretold by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, is already conferring such benefits upon the 
community.  
 
[May 4, 1948] 
 
 
Temple Interior Ornamentation and Arcade of the &amp;Bab's 
     Sepulcher 

     Delighted at contract for ornamentation, projected reception (i.e., 
for UN delegates in Geneva), appointment of new committees for 
 
+P51 
consolidation of teaching work and noble determination to pursue 
unremittingly your God-given task.  
     Announce to the friends that signature on contracts for arcade of 
the &amp;Bab's Sepulcher is synchronizing with first contract for interior 
ornamentation of the Mother Temple of the West.  
 
[May 14, 1948] 
 
 
My Appeal to This God-Chosen Community 
 
     The response of the American &amp;Baha'i Community to the urgent call 
to arise and remedy a critical situation has been such as to excite my 
highest admiration and exceed the hopes of all those who had waited 
with anxious hearts for this dangerous corner to be turned at such an 
important stage in the prosecution of the Second Seven Year Plan.  
     The rapidity with which the challenge has been met, the strenuous 
efforts which have been systematically exerted, the zeal and devotion 
which have been so abundantly demonstrated, the resolution and self-sacrifice 
which have been so strikingly displayed by the members of a 
community, burdened with such mighty responsibilities and intent on 
maintaining its lead among its sister communities in East and West, 
confer great luster on this latest episode in the history of the prosecution 
of the Divine Plan.  I am moved to offer its high-minded and valiant 
members my heartfelt congratulations on so conspicuous a victory, and 
on the preservation of an unblemished record of achievements in the 
service of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     The formation of the Canadian National Assembly, the conclusion 
of the preliminary steps for the completion of the interior ornamentation 
of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, the rapid multiplication and consolidation 
of the institutions of the Faith throughout Latin America, the 
steady expansion of the activities aiming at the proclamation of the 
Faith to the masses, the recognition secured, on behalf of the national 
institutions of a world community, from the United Nations Organization, 
above all the phenomenal success achieved through the constitution 
of no less than eight spiritual assemblies in seven of the goal 
countries selected as targets for the transatlantic operation of the Plan, 
now crowned by the holding of the first teaching conference on the 
continent of Europe--all these have served to immortalize the second 
 
+P52 
year of the Second Seven Year Plan and round out the mighty feat 
accomplished throughout the states and provinces of the North American 
continent--the base from which the operation of a divinely 
impelled and constantly expanding Plan are being conducted.  
     Emboldened by the enduring and momentous successes won, on so 
many fronts, in such distant fields, among such a diversity of peoples, 
and in the face of such formidable obstacles, by a community now 
launched, in both hemispheres, on its world-encircling mission, I direct 
my appeal to the entire membership of this God-chosen community, to 
its associates and daughter communities in the Dominion of Canada, in 
Central and South America, and in the continent of Europe, to 
proclaim, in the course of this current year, to their sister communities 
in East and West and by deeds no less resplendent than those of the 
past, their inflexible resolve to prosecute unremittingly the Plan entrusted 
to their care, and emblazon on their shields the emblems of new 
victories in its service.  
     The placing, with care and promptitude, of the successive contracts, 
designed to ensure the uninterrupted progress of the interior 
ornamentation of the Temple, at a time when the international 
situation is fraught with so many complications and perils; the acceleration 
of the twofold process designed to preserve the status of the 
present assemblies throughout the states of the Union and multiply 
their number; the constant broadening of the bases on which the 
projected Latin American national assemblies are to be securely 
founded; the steady expansion of the work initiated to give wider 
publicity to the Faith in the North American continent and in circles 
associated with the United Nations; and, last but not least, the 
constitution of firmly established assemblies in each of the remaining 
goal countries in Europe and the simultaneous initiation, in the 
countries already provided with such assemblies, of measures aiming at 
the formation of several nuclei calculated to reinforce the structural 
basis of an infant Administrative Order--these stand out as the primary 
and inescapable duties which the members of your Assembly--the 
mainspring of the multitudinous activities carried on in your homeland, 
in the Latin American field, and on the European front--must in 
this third year of the Second Seven Year Plan, befittingly discharge.  
     That the launching of one of these fundamental activities to be 
 
+P53 
conducted by your Assembly during the present year--the commencement 
of the interior ornamentation of the Mother Temple of the 
West--should have so closely synchronized with the placing of the first 
two contracts for the completion of the Sepulcher of the &amp;Bab, as 
contemplated by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, is indeed a phenomenon of singular 
significance.  This conjunction of two events of historic importance, 
linking, in a peculiar degree, the most sacred House of Worship in the 
American continent with the most hallowed Shrine on the slopes of 
Mount Carmel, brings vividly to mind the no less remarkable coincidence 
marking the simultaneous holding, on a &amp;Naw-Ruz Day, of the 
first convention of the American &amp;Baha'i Community and the entombment 
by the Center of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant of the remains of the &amp;Bab 
in the newly constructed vault of His Shrine.+F1  The simultaneous arrival 
of those remains in the fortress city of &amp;Akka and of the first pilgrims 
from the continent of America;+F2 the subsequent association of the 
founder of the American &amp;Baha'i Community with &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in the 
laying of the cornerstone of the &amp;Bab's Mausoleum on Mount Carmel; 
the holding of the Centenary of His Declaration beneath the dome of 
the recently constructed &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar at Wilmette, on which 
solemn occasion His blessed portrait was unveiled, on western soil, to 
the eyes of His followers; and the unique distinction now conferred on 
a member+F3 of the North American &amp;Baha'i Community of designing the 
dome, envisaged by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, as the final and essential embellishment 
of the &amp;Bab's Sepulcher--all these have served to associate the 
Herald of our Faith and His resting-place with the fortunes of a 
community which has so nobly responded to His summons addressed to 
the "peoples of the West" in His &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma'.  
     "This Sublime Shrine has remained unbuilt ...," &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
looking at the Shrine from the steps of His House on an August day in 
1915, remarked to some of His companions, at a time when the &amp;Bab's 
remains had already been placed by Him in the vault of one of the six 
chambers He had already constructed for that purpose.  "God willing, it 
will be accomplished.  We have carried its construction to this stage."  
     The initiation in these days of extreme peril in the Holy Land of so 
great and holy an enterprise, founded by &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself whilst 
still a Prisoner in &amp;Akka and commenced by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha during the 
darkest and most perilous days of His ministry, recalls to our minds,

+P54 
furthermore, the construction of the superstructure of the Temple in 
Wilmette during one of the severest financial crises that has afflicted 
the United States of America, and the completion of its exterior 
ornamentation during the dark days of the last World War.  Indeed, the 
tragic and moving story of the transfer of the &amp;Bab's mutilated body from 
place to place ever since His Martyrdom in &amp;Tabriz, its fifty-year 
concealment in Persia; its perilous and secret journey by way of &amp;Tihran, 
&amp;Isfahan, &amp;Kirmanshan, &amp;Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut and &amp;Akka to the 
Mountain of God, its ultimate resting place; its concealment for a further 
period of ten years in the Holy Land itself; the vexatious and long-drawn-out 
negotiations for the purchase of the site chosen by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah Himself for its entombment; the threats of &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid, 
the Turkish tyrant, the accusations levelled against its Trustee, the 
plots devised, and the inspection made, by the scheming members of 
the notorious Turkish Commission of Inquiry; the perils to which the 
bloodthirsty &amp;Jamal &amp;Pasha exposed it; the machinations of the arch-breaker 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant, of His brother and of His son, 
respectively, aiming at the frustration of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's design, at the 
prevention of the sale of land within the precincts of the Shrine itself, 
and the multiplication of the measures taken for the preservation and 
consolidation of the properties purchased in its vicinity and dedicated 
to it--all these are to be regarded as successive stages in the history of 
the almost hundred year long process destined to culminate in the 
consummation of &amp;Baha'u'llah's irresistible purpose of erecting a lasting 
and befitting memorial to His Divine Herald and Co-Founder of His 
Faith.  
     As the mission entrusted by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to the followers of His 
Faith in the North American continent gathers momentum, unfolds its 
potentialities, and raises to new heights of heroism and renown its 
valiant prosecutors, events of still greater significance will, no doubt, 
transpire, which will serve to enhance the value of the work which the 
prosecutors of the Plan are carrying out, to widen their vision, to 
reinforce their exertions, to sustain their spirit, to ennoble their heritage, 
to noise abroad their fame, to facilitate their assumption of the 
unique functions distinguishing their stewardship to the Faith, and to 
hasten the advent of the day, which shall witness, in the Golden Age 
that is still unborn, their "elevation to the throne of an everlasting 
 
+P55 
dominion," the day whereon "the whole earth" will "resound with the 
praises" of their "majesty and greatness."

Urge Special Attention to Goals 
 
     Welcome decisions made at recent Assembly meeting.  Supplicating 
blessings for forthcoming conference with committees.  Elated by 
magnificent success achieved at European Conference, development of 
affiliation with United Nations...  Urge you devote special attention 
in current year to insure rapid progress of Temple construction, 
maintenance of assembly status and consolidation of newly formed 
assemblies.  
 
[June 23, 1948] 
 
 
Praying for Added Fervor 
 
     Greatly welcome initiated plans for schools, delighted at progress of 
Temple work, acceptance of resolutions by UNO Conference, election 
of Ioas.  Urge unrelaxing vigilance in maintenance of status and 
consolidation of assemblies in North America, to insure steady expansion 
of manifold activities in Latin America and Europe.  Praying for 
added fervor, speedy realization of high objectives of God-given mission 
of much-admired American &amp;Baha'i Community.  
 
[August 9, 1948] 
 
 
Completed Tasks Release Outpouring of Grace 
 
     Welcome Assembly's high resolve to insure uninterrupted Temple 
construction.  Deeply moved and thankful for continued evidence of the 
inflexible determination with which the rank and file of the clear-sighted, 
high-minded, divinely sustained American &amp;Baha'i Community, 
 
+P56 
its representatives, national, local and regional, its pioneers at 
home and overseas, discharge in distant fields, despite the smallness 
of their numbers and their limited resources, tasks of such vast 
dimensions, of so diversified a character, of such great moment, at so 
significant a stage in the declining fortunes of an imperiled society.  I 
feel convinced that unflinching maintenance of so exalted a standard of 
stewardship at the threshold of &amp;Baha'u'llah must release in still greater 
measure the outpouring of His grace so essential and befitting the 
consummation of a Divine Plan deriving its authority from the pen of 
the Center of His Covenant and propelled by agencies created through 
the generative influence of His Will and Testament.  
 
[September 14, 1948] 
 
 
Appeal to Entire Community to Persevere 
 
     Appreciate Assembly's message.  Praying for success of plans.  Urge 
special effort to expedite work of Temple, reinforce pioneer endeavor in 
Europe owing to deteriorating international situation.  Appeal to entire 
community wholeheartedly to persevere irrespective of darkened outlook.  
 
[October 21, 1948] 
 
 
Scale Nobler Heights of Heroism 
 
     The deepening crisis ominously threatening further to derange the 
equilibrium of a politically convulsed, economically disrupted, socially 
subverted, morally decadent and spiritually moribund society is testing 
the tenacity, taxing the resources and challenging the spirit throughout 
three continents of the chosen trustees and valiant executors of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
Divine Plan.  This present hour, however critical, fraught with 
uncertainty, cannot and must not retard the unfoldment of the manifold 
tasks so brilliantly inaugurated, so diligently prosecuted, so 
dazzling in their prospects.  
     The record of the &amp;Baha'i community since inception of the Formative 
Age conclusively demonstrates that accomplishment of signal acts 
accompanied, or followed upon, periods of acute distress in European 
 
+P57 
and American contemporary history.  The machinery of the Administrative 
Order was established, and preliminary stage of construction of 
the House of Worship was undertaken, by a grief-stricken community 
in the anxious years following the sudden removal of its loving, 
watchful Founder.  The superstructure of the Temple was erected amid 
the strain and stress of an economic depression of an unprecedented 
severity gripping the North American continent.  The first Seven Year 
Plan, opening stage in the execution of the historic mission entrusted to 
the American &amp;Baha'i Community, was launched in the face of a 
gathering storm culminating in the direst conflict yet experienced by 
mankind.  The Tablets of the Divine Plan were revealed amidst the 
turmoil of the first World War involving great danger to the life of 
their Author.  The remains of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's mother and brother were 
transferred to site of monuments constituting focus of institutions of 
future World Administrative Center and erected on the morrow of the 
outbreak of hostilities while the Holy Land was increasingly exposed to 
the perils precipitated by the second conflict.  The daughter communities 
of Latin America were called into being and exterior ornamentation 
of the Temple was consummated while the American mother community 
was in the throes of the last, most harassing stage of the devastating 
struggle.  The world-wide Centenary celebrations crowning these enterprises 
were undertaken in such perilous circumstances and carried out 
despite the formidable obstacles engendered through prolongation of 
hostilities.  National administrative headquarters were established in 
&amp;Tihran, Cairo, &amp;Baghdad, Delhi and Sydney, national and international 
endowments were enriched and assemblies incorporated in countries 
confronted by growing threat of invasion and encirclement.  
     The Second Seven Year Plan inaugurating the transatlantic mission 
embracing Scandinavia, the Low Countries, Switzerland, the 
Iberian and Italian Peninsulas, was launched on the morrow of the 
catastrophic upheaval despite the exhaustion, confusion, distress and 
restrictions afflicting a war-shattered continent.  The first fruits of this 
newly launched Plan were garnered through convocation of first 
European Teaching Conference and erection of the ninth pillar of the 
Universal House of Justice in the Dominion of Canada despite 
premonitory rumblings of a third ordeal threatening to engulf the 
Eastern and Western Hemispheres.  The central structure of the &amp;Bab's 
Sepulcher was built while the precious life of its builder was hanging 
 
+P58 
perilously in the balance.  Plans were drawn, contracts placed and 
foundations laid for its arcade while the holy places were ravaged by 
flames of the civil strife burning fiercely in the Holy Land.  
     Precious years are inexorably slipping by.  The world outlook is 
steadily darkening.  The American Community's most arduous feats 
still lie ahead.  Disasters overtaking Europe and America, more afflictive 
than any tribulations yet suffered in either continent, may yet attend 
still more majestic revelations in the unfoldment of concluding stage of 
the Second Seven Year Plan destined to witness successively the raising 
of the tenth and eleventh pillars of the Universal House of Justice, and 
the celebration of the Golden Jubilee of the Mother Temple of the 
West.  
     The champion builders of &amp;Baha'u'llah's rising World Order must 
scale nobler heights of heroism as humanity plunges into greater depths 
of despair, degradation, dissension and distress.  Let them forge ahead 
into the future serenely confident that the hour of their mightiest 
exertions and the supreme opportunity for their greatest exploits must 
coincide with the apocalyptic upheaval marking the lowest ebb in 
mankind's fast-declining fortunes.  
 
[November 3, 1948] 
 
 
The Citadel of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
 
     As the threat of still more violent convulsions assailing a travailing 
age increases, and the wings of yet another conflict, destined to 
contribute a distinct, and perhaps a decisive, share to the birth of the 
new Order which must signalize the advent of the Lesser Peace, darken 
the international horizon, the eyes of the divers communities, comprising 
the body of the organized followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah throughout the 
Eastern Hemisphere, are being increasingly fixed upon the progressive 
unfoldment of the tasks which the executors of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Mandate 
have been summoned to undertake in the course of the second stage of 
their world-girdling mission.  Past experience, ranging over a period of 
many years, has taught them that no matter how formidable the 
external obstacles that have confronted them during the turbulent and 
eventful decades since the Master's passing, and despite the strain and 
stress which internal crises, precipitated by enemies from within and by 
 
+P59 
adverse economic circumstances afflicting their country, have imposed, 
the stalwart occupants of the citadel of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah have 
with extraordinary steadfastness, enviable fidelity and magnificent 
courage, not only shielded the interests, preserved the integrity and 
demonstrated the worthiness, of the Cause they have embraced, but 
have sallied forth, with dynamic and irrepressible energy, to implant its 
banner and establish its outposts in countries and continents far 
beyond the original scene of their operations.  
 
STAUNCHNESS OF AMERICAN BELIEVERS 
 
     Neither the irreparable loss sustained by the termination of the 
earthly life of a vigilant Master, nor the acute distress caused by the 
financial collapse which suddenly swept their country, nor the unprecedented 
tragedy of a world crisis that swept their land and its people into 
its vortex, nor the perils and uncertainties, the exhaustion and the 
disillusionment associated with its aftermath nor even the soul-shaking 
tests which periodically assailed them, through the defection and the 
attacks of Covenant-breakers, occupying, by virtue of their kinship to, 
or their long association with, the Founder of their community, exalted 
positions at the World Center of the Faith, or in the land from which it 
sprang, or in their own country--none of these have succeeded in 
vitiating the hidden spring of their spiritual life, in deflecting them 
from their chosen course, or in even retarding the forward march and 
fruition of their enterprises.  In the toilsome task of fixing the pattern, of 
laying the foundations, of erecting the machinery, and of setting in 
operation the Administrative Order of their Faith, in the execution of 
the successive stages in the erection and exterior ornamentation of their 
Temple, in the launching of the initial enterprise under &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
Divine Plan, which enabled them to establish the structural basis of the 
Order, recently laid in their homeland, in every republic of Central and 
South America; in the sustained, the systematic and prodigious effort 
exerted for the enlargement of the administrative foundations of the 
institutions of their Faith in every state and province of the United 
States and the Dominion of Canada; in the parallel endeavors aimed at 
the widespread dissemination of its literature, and the proclamation of 
its verities and tenets to the masses; in the launching of the Second 
Seven Year Plan, which has extended the ramifications of the Divine 
Plan across the Atlantic to ten sovereign states of the European 
 
+P60 
continent and which has already yielded a rich return through the 
formation of the first Canadian &amp;Baha'i National Assembly and the 
convocation of the first European Teaching Conference; in the 
repeated, the timely, the spontaneous and generous contributions they 
have made, on numerous occasions, for the relief of the persecuted 
among their brethren, for the defense of their institutions, for the 
vindication of their rights, for the consolidation of their activities and 
the progress of their enterprises--in all these the champions of the 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah have, with ever-increasing emphasis, borne witness 
to the sublimity of the faith which burns within their breasts, to the 
radiance of the vision that shines clearly and steadily before their eyes, 
the sureness and rapidity that mark their gigantic strides, and the 
vastness and glory of the unique mission entrusted to their hands.  
     Milestones of historic significance have been successively reached 
and rapidly left behind.  A still stonier stretch of road now lies before 
them.  Rumblings of catastrophes yet more dreadful agitate with increasing 
frequency a sorely stressed and chaotic world, presenting a 
challenge to grapple with the unfinished tasks, a challenge graver and 
still more pressing than any hitherto experienced.  
 
PRESS FORWARD ON TEMPLE CONTRACTS 
 
     The present and remaining contracts, designed to consummate the 
magnificent enterprise, initiated almost fifty years ago, in the heart of 
the North American continent and complete an edifice consecrated for 
all time by the loving hands of the Center of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant, 
constituting the foremost symbol of the Faith, and incarnating the soul 
of the American &amp;Baha'i Community in the Western Hemisphere, must 
be speedily and systematically carried out, however onerous the task 
may become, in consequence of the inevitable fluctuations to which the 
present economic conditions are subjected, in preparation for the 
jubilee that must mark the completion of that holy edifice. The recent 
broadening of the administrative basis of the Faith in a land that has 
served, and will long remain the base of the spiritual operations now 
being conducted in both hemispheres, in response to the ringing call of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, sounded three decades ago in His historic Tablets, must, 
no matter how arduous and insistent the tasks to be performed in Latin 
America and Europe, be fully maintained, and the process continually 
 
+P61 
enlarged and steadily consolidated.  The various agencies designed to 
carry the Message to the masses, and to present to them befittingly the 
teachings of its Author, must, likewise, be vigilantly preserved, supported 
and encouraged.  The essential preliminaries, calculated to widen 
the basis of the forthcoming Latin American national &amp;Baha'i assemblies, 
to familiarize the Latin American believers with the administrative 
duties and functions they will be called upon to discharge and to 
enrich and deepen their knowledge of the essentials of their Faith, its 
ideals, its history, its requirements and its problems, must be carried out 
with ever-increasing energy as the hour of the emergence of these Latin 
American communities into independent existence steadily and inexorably 
approaches.  The necessary guidance, which can alone be properly 
insured through the maintenance of an uninterrupted extension of 
administrative assistance, through the settlement of pioneers and the 
visits of itinerant teachers to the daughter communities, must under no 
circumstances be completely withdrawn, after their independence has 
been achieved.  Above all, the momentous enterprise initiated in the 
transatlantic field of service, so vast in conception, so timely, so arduous, 
so far-reaching in its potentialities, so infinitely meritorious, must in the 
face of obstacles, however insurmountable they may seem, be continually 
reinvigorated through undiminished financial support, through 
an ever-expanding supply of literature in each of the required languages, 
through frequent, and whenever possible prolonged, visits of 
itinerant teachers, through the continued settlement of pioneers, 
through the consolidation of the assemblies already established, 
through the early constitution of properly functioning assemblies in the 
few remaining goal countries as yet deprived of this inestimable 
blessing, and last but not least through the exertion of sustained and 
concentrated efforts designed to supplement these foci of &amp;Baha'i national 
administrative activity with subsidiary centers whose formation 
will herald the inauguration of teaching enterprises throughout the 
provinces of each of these ten countries.  
     As the dynamic forces, sweeping forward the First Seven Year Plan, 
on the last stages of its execution, rose rapidly to a crescendo, culminating 
in the nationwide celebrations marking the centenary of the Faith 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah and synchronized with a further and still more precipitous 
decline in the fortunes of a war-torn bleeding society, so must 
 
+P62 
every aggravation in the state of a world still harassed by the ravages of 
a devastating conflict, and now hovering on the brink of a yet more 
crucial struggle, be accompanied by a still more ennobling manifestation 
of the spirit of this second crusade, whose consummation might 
well coincide with a period of distress far more acute than the one 
through which humanity is now passing.  
 
CEASELESS EFFORT ESSENTIAL 
 
     Not ours to speculate, or dwell upon the immediate workings of an 
inscrutable Providence presiding alike over the falling fortunes of a 
dying Order and the rising glory of a Plan holding within it the seeds of 
the world's spiritual revival and ultimate redemption.  Nor can we 
attempt as yet, whilst the second stage in the operation of such a Plan 
has not yielded its destined fruit, to visualize the nature of the tasks, or 
discern the character of the circumstances that will mark the progressive 
unfoldment of a third successive crusade, the successful termination 
of which must signalize the closing of the first historic epoch in the 
evolution of the Divine Plan.  All we can be sure of, and confidently 
assert, is that upon the outcome of the assiduous efforts now being 
collectively exerted, in three continents, by the North American, the 
Latin and European believers, acting under the Mandate of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
associated with the one and only Plan conceived by Himself, 
aided by the agencies deriving their inspiration from His Will and 
Testament, and assured of the support promised by the pen of His 
Father, in His Most Holy Book, must solely depend the timing as well 
as the nature of the tasks which must be successfully carried out ere the 
closing of an epoch of such transcendent brightness and glory in the 
evolution of the mightiest Plan ever generated through the creative 
power of the Most Great Name, as manifested by the Will of the 
Center of His Covenant and the Interpreter of His Teaching.  
     There can be no doubt whatever that with every turn of the wheel, 
as a result of the operation of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Plan, and with every 
extension in the range of its evolution, a responsibility of still greater 
gravity and of wider import will have to be shouldered by its divinely 
chosen executors wherever its ramifications may extend and however 
oppressive the state of the countries and continents in which they may 
have to labor.  They must strive, ceaselessly strive, ready for any 
emergency, steeled to meet any degree of opposition, unsatisfied with 
 
+P63 
any measure of progress as yet achieved, prepared to make sacrifices far 
exceeding any they have already willingly made, and confident that 
such striving, such readiness, such resolution, such high-mindedness, 
such sacrifice will earn them the palm of a victory still more soul-satisfying 
and resounding in its magnificence than any as yet won since 
the inception of their mission.  
     May He Who called them into being and raised them up, Who 
fostered them in their infancy, Who extended to them the blessing of 
His personal support in their years of childhood, Who bequeathed to 
them the distinguishing heritage of His Plan, Whose Will and Testament 
initiated them, during the period of their adolescence, in the 
processes of a divinely appointed Administrative Order, Who enabled 
them to attain maturity through the inauguration of the first stage in 
the execution of His Plan, Who conferred upon them the privilege of 
spiritual parenthood at the close of the initial phase in the operation of 
that same Plan, continue through the further unfoldment of the second 
stage in its evolution to guide their steps along the path leading to the 
assumption of functions proclaiming the attainment of full spiritual 
manhood, and enable them eventually, through the long and slow 
processes of evolution and in conformity with the future requirements 
of a continually evolving Plan, to manifest before the eyes of the 
members of their sister communities, their countrymen and the whole 
world, and in all their plenitude, the potentialities inherent within 
them, and which in the fullness of time, must reflect in its perfected 
form, the glories of the mission constituting their birthright.

Arcade for the Shrine of the &amp;Bab 
 
     Convey to believers the joyful news of the safe delivery on Mt.  
Carmel of a consignment of thirty-two granite monolith columns, part 
of the initial shipment of material ordered for construction of the 
arcade of the &amp;Bab's Sepulcher, designed to envelop and preserve the 
sacred previous structure reared by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  Building operations 
are soon starting notwithstanding the difficulties of the present situation.  
I am supplicating the Almighty's guidance and sustaining grace 
for successive stages of an enterprise envisaged sixty years ago by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, initiated by the Center of His Covenant, designed to 
culminate as contemplated by Him in erection of a superstructure to be 
crowned by a golden dome marking the consummation at the heart of 
the Mountain of God of the momentous undertaking born through the 
generating influence of the Will of the Founder of our beloved Faith, 
so dear to the heart of His blessed Son, and dedicated to the memory of 
the Martyr-Prophet, the immortal Herald of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation.

     ("Plan two" refers to a series of possible Temple construction schedules 
submitted to the Guardian.)  
 
 
Curtailment of Some Activities 
 
     Budgets for activities in Europe, Latin America and consolidation 
work in United States should not be reduced owing to their vital 
relation to Second Seven Year Plan.  All other activities, whether 
connected with proclamation of Faith, publications, &amp;Baha'i Magazine, 
&amp;Baha'i World or schools, should either be drastically curtailed or 
suspended during two years.  Holding Annual Convention and maintenance 
of &amp;Baha'i News essential.  
 
[January 19, 1949] 
 
 
Divert Contributions to Temple Fund 
 
     Advise that you divert contributions for International Fund to 
Temple Fund, and suspend World Order Magazine.  
 
[February 26, 1949] 
 
 
Suspend World Order Magazine 
 
     Advise you to suspend magazine for next two years.  Appeal on my 
behalf to subscribers in East and West to devote their subscription fee

to Temple Fund.  Owing to present emergency such action would be 
highly meritorious.  
 
[February 28, 1949] 
 
 
A Testing Period Recalling Ordeals of the Dawn-Breakers 
 
     The first half of the opening decade of the second &amp;Baha'i century is 
terminating.  The great-minded, stout-hearted, high-spirited American 
&amp;Baha'i Community, laden with the trophies accumulated in the course 
of its fifty years' magnificent stewardship of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah is 
irresistibly embarking upon a two and a half year period unsurpassed in 
its fateful consequences by any previous stage traversed in the community's 
eventful history.  
     Its members, without exception, are called upon to steel themselves 
without delay to face an unexpected emergency, seize a God-given 
opportunity, meet a supreme challenge, and show forth a tenacity of 
purpose, a solidarity in sacrifice, an austerity in everyday life, worthy 
the Martyr-Prophet of their Faith as well as their heroic spiritual 
forebears, the hundredth anniversary of whose agonizing tribulations, 
including captivity, sieges, betrayals, spoliation and martyrdom, is 
being commemorated during this same period.  
     No lesser tribute can be paid the memory of the glorious &amp;Bab, the 
immortal &amp;Quddus, the lion-hearted &amp;Mulla &amp;Husayn, the erudite &amp;Vahid, 
the audacious &amp;Hujjat, the illustrious seven martyrs of &amp;Tihran and a host 
of unnumbered heroes whose lifeblood flowed so copiously in the 
course of the opening decade of the first &amp;Baha'i century, by the 
privileged champion-builders of the World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah during 
the present critical stage in the unfoldment of the Formative Age of 
His Dispensation, than a parallel outpouring of their substance by the 
builders of the most holy House of Worship laboring in the corresponding 
decade of the succeeding century.  
     The American &amp;Baha'i Community, exalted, singled out among 
sister communities of East and West through revelation of the Tablets 
of the Divine Plan, is unavoidably approaching a testing period, 
crucial, prolonged, potent, purifying, clearly envisaged by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
different from but recalling in its severity the ordeals which 
afflicted the dawn-breakers in a former Age.  
 
+P67 
     The anticipated trials will enable its members to plumb greater 
depths of consecration, soar to nobler heights of collective endeavor, 
and disclose in fuller measure the future glory of their destiny.  
     Might not the strain, the stress, of the strenuous period now being 
ushered in through inscrutable dispensations of Providence be productive 
of perspicuous benefits and blessings reminiscent of the incalculable 
outpourings of divine grace which followed closely in the train 
of the woeful trials immortalizing the initial, the bloodiest, the most 
dramatic period in the Heroic Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  
 
[March 16, 1949] 
 
 
Arcade of the &amp;Bab's Shrine Begun 
 
     Convey to friends the joyful historic news of commencement of 
construction of arcade of the &amp;Bab's Shrine coinciding with fortieth 
anniversary of the placing of His remains in marble sarcophagus in 
vault of the same shrine by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
 
[March 21, 1949] 
 
 
One Remaining Objective Hangs in the Balance 
 
     The American &amp;Baha'i Community, undefeated as yet in the performance 
of any task undertaken collectively by its members, in the 
course of its eventful history, is now entering a period of grave 
emergency, that will try the mettle of every single one of its members.  
Severe as the challenge will be, however prolonged the test, no matter 
how distracting the condition of the world about them, the issues which 
claim every ounce of their energy and call for their sustained, wholehearted, 
concentrated attention are so weighty that none can evaluate at 
present the influence they will exert on the course of the community's 
future destiny.  
     There can be no doubt that the Second Seven Year Plan, the vital 
link binding the initial and concluding stages of the first epoch in the 
progressive evolution of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's long-term continually unfolding 
Plan, has reached its crucial phase--a phase on which hinge the 
fortunes not only of the Plan itself but of the community as a whole.  
 
+P68 
The fourth objective of the Plan, the transatlantic project, on which 
its members have embarked, has, four years ahead of schedule, been, 
to all intents and purposes, victoriously achieved.  The third objective 
has been partly attained, while its complete fulfillment, as a direct 
consequence of the marvelous success that has attended the valiant labors 
of the American pioneers and the newly enrolled native believers in 
Latin America, appears to be now fully assured.  The attainment of the 
first objective has, as a result of the remarkable impetus given, during 
the opening years of the Plan, to the multiplication of spiritual assemblies 
and the proclamation of the Faith in North America, been greatly 
facilitated, and will, with steady effort, involving not too great an 
expenditure of energy, be insured in the course of the concluding phase 
of the Plan.  The completion of the Mother Temple of the West, the 
sacredness of which neither the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the &amp;Baha'i 
world, nor any future House of Worship to be erected by the followers 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, in any country, at any future date, can rival, in time for 
the celebration of its Jubilee, is the one remaining objective that now 
hangs precariously in the balance.  Owing to a combination of circumstances 
wholly beyond the control of its builders, this task has assumed 
a critical importance, and is of such vital urgency, that no prosecutor 
of the Plan, eager to witness its consummation, can afford to ignore 
for a moment.  
     The sacrifice demanded is such as to have no parallel whatsoever in 
the history of that community.  The manifold issues inextricably interwoven 
with the campaign audaciously launched for the achievement of 
this high objective are of such a weighty character as to overshadow 
every enterprise embarked upon through the organized efforts of its 
members, in either the concluding years of the Heroic Age of the Faith 
or the first epoch of the Age which succeeded it.  The two years during 
which this emergency will be most keenly felt coincide on the one hand 
with a period of increasing distraction occasioned by the uncertainties, 
the perils and fears of a steadily worsening international situation, and 
on the other with the centenary of one of the most turbulent, afflictive 
and glorious stages of &amp;Baha'i history--a stage immortalized by an 
effusion of blood, a self-abnegation, a heroism unsurpassed not only in 
the annals of the Faith but in the world's spiritual history.  How 
meritorious, indeed, are the self-denying acts which this supremely 
challenging hour now calls forth, amidst the perplexities and confusion 
 
+P69 
which present-day society is now experiencing!  And yet, how trifling in 
comparison with the self-immolation of the most distinguished, the 
most precious heroes and saints of the Primitive Age of our glorious 
Faith!  An outpouring of treasure, no less copious than the blood shed so 
lavishly in the Apostolic Age of the Faith by those who in the heart of 
the Asiatic continent proclaimed its birth to the world, can befit their 
spiritual descendants, who, in the present Formative Age of the 
&amp;Baha'i Dispensation, have championed the Cause, and assumed so 
preponderating a share in the erection of its Administrative Order, and 
are now engaged in the final stage of the building of the House that 
incarnates the soul of that Faith in the American continent.  No 
sacrifice can be deemed too great to insure the completion of such an 
edifice--the most holy House of Worship ever to be associated with the 
Faith of the Most Great Name--an edifice whose inception has shed 
such a luster on the closing years of the Heroic Age of the &amp;Baha'i 
Dispensation, which has assumed a concrete shape in the present 
Formative stage in the evolution of our beloved Faith, whose dependencies 
must spring into existence in the course of successive epochs of this 
same Age, and whose fairest fruits will be garnered in the Age that is to 
come, the last, the Golden Age of the initial and brightest Dispensation 
of the five-thousand-century &amp;Baha'i Cycle.  
     "A most wonderful and thrilling motion will appear in the world of 
existence," are &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's own words, predicting the release of 
spiritual forces that must accompany the completion of this most 
hallowed House of Worship.  "From that point of light," He, further 
glorifying that edifice, has written, "the spirit of teaching ... will 
permeate to all parts of the world."  And again:  "Out of this 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, without doubt, thousands of &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkars will be 
born."  "It marks the inception of the Kingdom of God on earth."  
     Again I repeat--and I cannot overrate the vital, the unique importance 
of the campaign now launched to insure the completion of such 
an edifice--the immediate destiny of the American &amp;Baha'i Community 
is intimately and inescapably bound up with the outcome of this newly 
launched, this severely trying, soul-purging, spiritually uplifting campaign.  
The God-given mission, constituting the birthright, and proclaiming 
the primacy of a community whose members the Founder of 
that community, the Center of the Covenant Himself, has addressed as 
the "Apostles of &amp;Baha'u'llah," can only be fulfilled if they befittingly 
 
+P70 
obey the specific Mandate issued by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in His Tablets of the 
Divine Plan.  The execution of this Mandate is, in its turn, dependent 
upon the triumphant conclusion of the Second Seven Year Plan, the 
second stage in the series of specific plans formulated to insure the 
successful termination of the opening phase in the execution of that 
Mandate.  Indeed, the successive plans, inaugurated since the birth of 
the second &amp;Baha'i century, by the British, the Indian, the Persian, the 
Australia-New Zealand, the &amp;Iraqi, the German and the Egyptian 
National Assemblies, with the exception of the plan undertaken by the 
Canadian National Assembly, which forms an integral part of the Plan 
associated with the Tablets of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, are but supplements to the 
vast enterprise whose features have been delineated in those Tablets 
and are to be regarded, by their very nature, as regional in scope, in 
contrast with the world-embracing character of the mission entrusted to 
the community of the champion builders of the World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
and the torch-bearers of the civilization which that Order must 
eventually establish.  As to the Second Seven Year Plan itself, its 
eventual success must depend on the attainment of its second and most 
vital objective.  This objective, in its turn, cannot be achieved unless the 
two-year campaign, now launched by the elected representatives of this 
community, is successfully carried out.  Nor can this campaign yield its 
richest fruit unless and until the community, in its entirety, participates 
in this nation-wide sacrificial effort.  Nor can this collective effort be 
blessed, to the fullest extent possible, unless the contributions made by 
its members involve acts of self-abnegation, not only on the part of 
those of modest means, but also by those endowed with substantial 
resources.  Nor, indeed, can these self-denying acts, by both the rich 
and the poor, be productive of the fullest possible benefit unless this 
sacrificial effort is neither momentary nor haphazard, but rather systematic 
and continuous throughout the period of the present emergency.  
     Then and only then will this holy edifice, symbol and harbinger of 
a world civilization as yet unborn, and the embodiment of the sacrifice 
of a multitude of the upholders of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, release the 
full measure of the regenerative power with which it has been endowed, 
shed in all its plenitude the glory of the Most Holy Spirit 
dwelling within it, and vindicate, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the 
truth of every single promise recorded by the pen of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
pertaining to its destiny.  
 
+P71 
     No more befitting consummation for this magnificent enterprise 
can be envisaged than that this noble edifice, whose cornerstone has 
been laid by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's own hands, the preliminary measure for 
whose construction synchronized with the formal interment of the 
&amp;Bab's remains on Mt. Carmel, within whose walls the first Centenary 
of the birth of His ministry has been celebrated, whose interior 
ornamentation has coincided with the construction of the arcade of His 
Sepulcher, should be vouchsafed the honor of having the Jubilee of its 
inception coincide with, and celebrated on the occasion of, the Centenary 
of the birth of &amp;Baha'u'llah's prophetic Mission in the &amp;Siyah-Chal 
of &amp;Tihran.  
 
[April 11, 1949] 
 
 
Process of Expansion Accelerates 
 
[MESSAGE TO 1949 CONVENTION] 
 
     Desire to share with attendants at Forty-first American &amp;Baha'i 
Convention feelings of joyous gratitude evoked by the steady acceleration 
of the dual process of expansion and consolidation of the &amp;Baha'i 
World Community as well as the perspicuous evidences of divine 
protection vouchsafed the World Center of the Faith during the course 
of the third year of the Second Seven Year Plan.  The number of 
countries included within the pale of the Faith is ninety-four.  Languages 
into which &amp;Baha'i literature is translated, and assemblies, local 
and national, incorporated, now total fifty-six and one hundred five, 
respectively.  &amp;Baha'i literature now being translated into fourteen additional 
languages.  The number of centers in Latin America is one 
hundred and nine.  The fourth objective of the present Plan has been 
achieved four years ahead of schedule through the formation of a 
spiritual assembly in each of the ten goal countries on the European 
continent.  Centers established in these countries total thirty-one, newly 
enrolled native believers, one hundred fifty-four.  Nearly a million 
dollar drive to complete the Mother Temple of the West has been 
auspiciously launched and construction of interior sections of the 
ornamentation initiated.  Number of settlements in Greenland provided 
with &amp;Baha'i scriptures raised to forty-eight, including Thule 
beyond the Arctic Circle and Etah near eightieth latitude.  Number of 
 
+P72 
American states, territories and federal districts recognizing &amp;Baha'i 
marriage raised to eighteen.  Restoration of the newly acquired German 
national &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds at Frankfurt has been commenced.  Formulation 
of five year plans for German and Egyptian National Assemblies, 
culminating at the Centenary of the Birth of &amp;Baha'u'llah's prophetic 
Mission, completes the number of national assemblies pledged to 
achieve within appointed time specified goals in five continents.  The 
European Teaching Conference convened at Geneva inaugurating 
series of annual gatherings designed to consolidate the tremendously 
significant transatlantic project.  &amp;Baha'i observers accredited by United 
Nations participated in Conference on Human Rights, Geneva; 
United Nations General Assembly, Paris.  &amp;Baha'i representative attended 
Luxembourg general conference of world movement for world 
federation.  First all red Indian Assembly consolidated at Macy, 
Nebraska.  Building operations on arcade of &amp;Bab's Sepulcher commenced 
forty years after official interment of His remains by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
Prolonged hostilities ravaging Holy Land providentially terminated.  
&amp;Baha'i holy places, unlike those belonging to other faiths, 
miraculously safeguarded.  Perils no less grave than those which threatened 
the World Center of the Faith under &amp;Abdu'l-Hamid and &amp;Jamal 
&amp;Pasha and through Hitler's intended capture of the Near East, averted.  
Independent sovereign state within confines of Holy Land established 
and recognized, marking termination of twenty-century-long provincial 
status.  Formal assurance of the protection of &amp;Baha'i holy sites and 
continuation of &amp;Baha'i pilgrimage given by Prime Minister of newly 
emerged state.  Official invitation extended by its government on the 
historic occasion of the opening of the state's first parliament.  Official 
record of &amp;Baha'i marriage endorsed, &amp;Baha'i endowments exempted by 
responsible authorities of the same state.  Best wishes for the future 
welfare of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah conveyed in writing by the newly 
elected head of the state in reply to congratulatory message addressed 
him upon assumption of his office.  Appeal to entire community, 
through assembled delegates, in thankful recognition of the manifold 
blessings vouchsafed the Faith and in response to the alert sounded for 
the present emergency, to arise and demonstrate more conspicuously 
than ever before, through greater austerity at home and increasing 
audacity in foreign fields, both in Latin America and Europe, their 
grim determination at whatever cost, no matter how crucial the test, 
 
+P73 
however long the period, however herculean the labor, to carry forward 
unremittingly their task to its triumphant conclusion.  
 
[April 25, 1949] 
 
 
Welcome Initial Victory 
 
     Greatly welcome, much impressed by remarkable feat of initial 
victory collectively achieved by self-sacrificing efforts of invincible, 
far-visioned, forward-marching American &amp;Baha'i Community.  Ultimate 
victory now in sight bidding fair to bring present emergency period to 
triumphant conclusion, seal fate of Second Seven Year Plan and 
open prospect of glorious inauguration at appointed time of third 
collective Plan designed to terminate initial chapter in story of 
mysterious unfoldment of Divine Plan.  Rejoice particularly at 
formulation of teaching plans so vitally linked with immediate destiny 
of Temple enterprise.  Owing to relaxation of pressure occasioned 
by critical situation advise direct special attention to invigorate 
activities conducted in Latin America and European continent.  
Need for voluntary, self-supporting, wholly dedicated pioneers calculated 
to supplement newly launched undertaking in both fields is 
still pressing and acquiring greater urgency owing to approaching 
emergence of Latin American national assemblies and necessity to 
consolidate swiftly the newly-formed local assemblies in ten European 
goal countries.  Heart uplifted at contemplation of mighty range of 
accomplishments embracing so vast a field in both hemispheres.  Prayers 
continually ascending to &amp;Abha throne both in thanksgiving for marvelous 
bounties already vouchsafed and in supplication for renewal of 
strength for attainment of future goals.  
 
[June 29, 1949] 
 
 
Supplicating Blessing for American Activities 
 
     Delighted by progress of Temple work.  Highly approve, deeply 
appreciate suggestion to defray expenses of German representative to 
Brussels conference.  Supplicating Almighty's blessing for manifold 
activities pursued, unrelaxing vigilance, unflinching determination, 
 
+P74 
exemplary self-sacrifice in three continents by divinely sustained American 
&amp;Baha'i Community.  
 
[July 20, 1949] 
 
 
Corners of Shrine Arcade Under Construction 
 
     Inform friends of commencement of construction on three corners 
of arcade of Shrine.  Six granite pilasters already erected, twelve 
columns will be raised shortly.  Forwarding photographs for publicity 
purposes.  
 
[August 7, 1949] 
 
 
This Hour, Crowded With Destiny 
 
     The efforts exerted, and the results achieved, by the members of the 
American &amp;Baha'i Community during the opening months of the two-year 
emergency period are such as to merit the highest commendation 
and praise.  They will, if the effort be sustained, evoke the admiration of 
the entire &amp;Baha'i world, which is now watching, with feelings of 
wonder and expectancy, the outcome of the tremendous labor of this 
community now confronted with one of the most challenging, arduous 
and far-reaching tasks ever undertaken in its history.  
     The great forward stride that has already been undertaken, during 
so short a period, augurs well for the ultimate victory, now within 
sight--a victory which will pave the way for the successful execution of 
a seven-year enterprise, destined, in its turn, to enable its executors to 
launch, at the appointed time, the third and most glorious stage in the 
initial unfoldment of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's unique and grand design for that 
privileged and conspicuously blessed community.  
     No less striking has been the achievement of the representatives of 
this community in the vast and most recent field of their historic and 
highly meritorious endeavors, exerted beyond the confines of their 
homeland, where over so vast a territory, on a continent so agitated, and 
amidst peoples so disillusioned, so varied in race, language and outlook, 
so impoverished spiritually, so paralyzed with fear, so confused in 
thought, so abased in their moral standards, so rent by internal schisms, 
 
+P75 
victories so rich in promise, so startling in their rapidity, so magnificent 
in their range, have been won, and ennobled, to such a marked degree, 
the deathless record of American &amp;Baha'i service to the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Now that so prodigious and successful an effort has been exerted on 
behalf of the historic and sacred Temple, whose completion constitutes 
so vital an objective of the Second Seven Year Plan, and so conspicuous 
a triumph won in the transatlantic sphere of its operation, its needs and 
other vital objectives, both at home and in the Latin American field, 
must receive, in the months immediately ahead, the particular attention 
of both the national elected representatives of the community who 
supervise the working of the Plan and the mass of believers who 
participate in its execution.  
     While the financial requirements of the Mother Temple of the 
West are being met with unabated heroism by rich and poor alike in 
the critical months that lie ahead, and the measures to ensure the 
undiminished support, and the uninterrupted consolidation of the 
European enterprise are being assiduously carried out, a parallel effort, 
no less strenuous and sustained should be simultaneously exerted in the 
North American continent and in Central and South America, for the 
purpose of preserving the prizes already won over the length and 
breadth of the Western Hemisphere, where the initial impulse of this 
mighty and Divine Plan has been felt and its initial victories in foreign 
fields registered.  
     The assemblies of the North American continent, constituting the 
base for the gigantic operations destined to warm and illuminate, 
under American &amp;Baha'i auspices, the five continents of the globe, must, 
at no time and under no circumstances, be allowed to diminish in 
number or decline in strength and in influence.  The movement of 
pioneers, whether settlers or itinerant teachers, which in fields so 
distant from this base, has exhibited so marvelous a vitality, must, 
within the limits of the homeland itself, be neither interrupted nor 
suffer a decline.  The groups and isolated centers so painstakingly 
formed and established must, conjointly with this highly commendable 
and essential duty, be maintained, fostered and if possible multiplied.  
     No less attention, while this emergency period taxes, to an unprecedented 
degree, the combined resources of the envied trustees of 
 
+P76 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan, should be directed to the vast network of 
&amp;Baha'i enterprises initiated throughout Latin America, where the work 
so nobly conceived, so diligently prosecuted, so conspicuously blessed, 
is rapidly nearing the first stage of its fruition.  The flow of pioneers, so 
vital in all its aspects, and which has yielded such inestimable benefits 
at the early stages of this widely ramified enterprise, must, however 
urgent the other tasks already shouldered by an overburdened yet 
unfailingly protected community, be neither arrested nor slacken.  The 
outpost of the newly born communities, established in the Straits of 
Magallanes in the South, must be held with undiminished vigor and 
determination.  The major task of ensuring the breadth and solidity of 
the foundations laid for the establishment of two national &amp;Baha'i 
assemblies, through the preservation of the present assemblies, groups 
and isolated centers, and the restoration of any of these vital centers, 
now dissolved, to their former status, must be scrupulously watched 
and constantly encouraged.  The process of the dissemination of &amp;Baha'i 
literature, of &amp;Baha'i publication and translation, must continue unabated, 
however much the sacrifice involved.  The newly fledged institutions 
of teaching and regional committees, of summer schools and of 
congresses, must be continually encouraged and increasingly supported 
by teachers as well as administrators, by pioneers from abroad, as well as 
by the native believers themselves.  The highly salutary and spiritually 
beneficent experiment of encouraging a more active participation by 
these newly won supporters of the Faith in Latin America, and a 
greater assumption of administrative responsibility on their part, in the 
ever expanding activities to be entrusted wholly to their care in the 
years to come, should be, in particular, developed, systematized and 
placed on a sure and unassailable foundation.  Above all, the paramount 
duty of deepening the spiritual life of these newly fledged, these 
precious and highly esteemed co-workers, and of enlightening their 
minds regarding the essential verities enshrined in their Faith, its 
fundamental institutions, its history and genesis--the twin Covenants 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah and of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, the present Administrative Order, 
the future World Order, the Laws of the Most Holy Book, the 
inseparable institutions of the Guardianship and of the Universal 
House of Justice, the salient events of the Heroic and Formative Ages 
of the Faith, and its relationship with the Dispensations that have 
preceded it, its attitude toward the social and political organizations by 
 
+P77 
which it is surrounded--must continue to constitute the most vital 
aspect of the great spiritual Crusade launched by the champions of the 
Faith from among the peoples of their sister republics in the South.  
     The magnitude of the tasks these heroes and champions of the 
Faith are summoned, at this hour, crowded with destiny, to discharge 
from the borders of Greenland to the southern extremity of Chile in the 
Western Hemisphere, and from Scandinavia in the north, to the 
Iberian peninsula in the south of the European continent, is, indeed, 
breath-taking in its implications and back-breaking in the strain it 
imposes.  The sacrifices they are called upon to voluntarily make for 
the successful performance of such herculean, such holy, such epoch-making 
tasks, are comparable to none but those which their spiritual 
forbears have willingly accepted at the hour of the birth of their 
Faith more than a hundred years ago.  Theirs is the privilege, no less 
meritorious and perhaps as epoch-making, to preside, in their own 
homeland and its neighboring continents, over, and direct the forces 
generated by, the birth of an order that posterity will acclaim as both 
the offspring of that Faith, and the precursor of the Golden Age in 
which that same Faith must, in the fullness of time, find its fullest 
expression and most glorious consummation.  
     How great the opportunity which the present hour, so dark in the 
fortunes of mankind and yet so bright in the ever-unfolding history of 
their Faith, offers them.  How unspeakably precious the reward which 
they who serve it will reap!  How pitiful and urgent the need of the 
waiting multitudes of these continents, summoned to sustain the initial 
impact of the operation of a divinely impelled Plan which no force can 
resist and no power can rival!  
     For what this superbly equipped community, this irresistibly 
advancing army of the chosen warriors of &amp;Baha'u'llah, battling under 
His banner, operating in conformity with the explicit Mandate voiced 
by His beloved Son, has already achieved, over so extensive a field, in 
such a brief time, at such great sacrifice, for so precious a Cause, and in 
the course of such turbulent years, I cannot but feel the deepest sense of 
gratitude the like of which no achievement, single or collective, 
rendered in any other part of the globe, by any community associated 
with the Cause of the Most Great Name has evoked.  For what it will 
and must achieve in the future I entertain feelings of warm expectation 
and serene confidence.  For it, I will continue, from the depths of a 
 
+P78 
loving and grateful heart to supplicate blessings immeasurably richer 
than any it has yet experienced.  
 
[August 18, 1949] 
 
 
Praying For Increasing Success 
 
     Delighted at progress of Temple work; urge uninterrupted reinforcement 
of Latin American and European enterprises through 
steady flow of pioneers, continued self-sacrifice; praying for increasing 
success of your high endeavors.  Deepest loving appreciation.  
 
[November 6, 1949] 
 
 
Majesty of the &amp;Bab's Shrine Unfolding 
 
     Announce to the friends that six hundred tons of stones destined 
for the arcade of the &amp;Bab's Shrine, received in successive shipments to 
the Holy Land, have been safely transported to its precincts despite 
repeated accidents--the sinking of a lighter in the harbor and outbreak 
of fire in the hold of the ship.  An additional two hundred tons of 
material including carved marble mosaic have been ordered through 
recent contract for erection of parapet designed to crown the columns 
and arches of the arcade.  North and east sides of structure with three 
corners virtually completed.  Construction of cornice and roof, last stage 
in erection of the arcade, will soon be undertaken.  Majesty and beauty 
of the colonnade enveloping the central holy edifice built by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
hands steadily unfolding, presaging revelation of the full glory 
of the completed Sepulcher manifesting the plenitude of the splendor 
of the constructed dome.  
 
[November 13, 1949] 
 
 
Faithless Brother Hussein 
 
     Faithless brother Hussein, already abased through dishonorable 
conduct over period of years followed by association with Covenant-breakers 
 
+P79 
in Holy Land and efforts to undermine Guardian's position, 
recently further demeaned himself through marriage under obscure 
circumstances with lowborn Christian girl in Europe.  This disgraceful 
alliance, following four successive marriages by sisters and cousins with 
three sons of Covenant-breaker denounced repeatedly by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
as His enemy, and daughter of notorious political agitator, brands them 
with infamy greater than any associated with marriages contracted by 
old Covenant-breakers whether belonging to family of &amp;Muhammad-'Ali 
or &amp;Badi'u'llah.  
 
[December 19, 1949] 
 
 
Maintain Momentum in Triple Field 
 
     Delighted by progress in Latin-American field, Temple construction 
and publicity activities.  Announce arrival of first shipment of 
parapet panels.  Anticipate early completion of eastern &amp;facade of Shrine 
including mosaic panels.  Urge maintenance of momentum in triple 
field, home, intercontinental enterprises.  Praying for bountiful blessings 
from the Almighty.  
 
[February 25, 1950] 
 
 
Shrine Parapet Completed 
 
     Announce to the friends the completion, on the eve of &amp;Naw-Ruz, of 
the erection of parapet crowning the eastern &amp;facade of Holy Shrine one 
year after placing the first threshold stones upon the foundation of the 
arcade.  The beauty and majesty of the finely carved panels surmounting 
the soaring arches spanning the rosy monolith columns, emblazoned 
with emerald green and scarlet mosaic symbolizing the &amp;Bab's 
lineage and martyrdom, are strikingly revealed.  The original pearl-like 
structure raised by the hands of the Center of the Covenant, enshrining 
the remains of the Martyr-Prophet of the Faith, acquiring, through 
construction of the shell designed for its embellishment and preservation, 
additional height by one-third, additional width by one-fifth, 
enhancing the massiveness of the edifice embosomed in the Mountain 
 
+P80 
of God, heralding the erection of the lofty gilded dome that will 
eventually shine forth in solitary splendor from its heart.  
 
[March 21, 1950] 
 
Sacred Task of Present Hour 
 
     Approved recommendation regarding treatment of walls.  Meeting 
deficit budget must have precedence over purchase of land near &amp;Hazira 
owing to critical situation in Latin America and vital needs in Europe.  
Steady flow of pioneers to both continents is the imperative, urgent, 
sacred task of the present hour.  
 
[March 29, 1950] 
 
 
Shrine Arcade Nearing Completion 
 
     Announce to friends that central panel of north &amp;facade, adorned 
with green mosaic with gilded Greatest Name, the fairest gem set in 
crown of arcade of Shrine, clearly visible from city by day, floodlit by 
night, is now in position.  
     Three corner panels bearing symbol of ringstone erected, presaging 
completion of both parapet and arcade on the occasion of approaching 
Centenary of martyrdom of the Blessed &amp;Bab.  
 
[June 17, 1950] 
 
 
Centenary of the Martyrdom of the &amp;Bab 
 
     Moved to share with assembled representatives of American &amp;Baha'i 
Community gathered beneath the dome of the Most Holy House of 
Worship in the &amp;Baha'i world, feelings of profound emotion evoked by 
this historic occasion of the world-wide commemoration of the First 
Centenary of the Martyrdom of the Blessed &amp;Bab, Prophet and Herald 
of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, Founder of the Dispensation marking the 
culmination of the six thousand year old Adamic Cycle, Inaugurator of 
the five thousand century &amp;Baha'i Cycle.  
     Poignantly call to mind the circumstances attending the last act 
 
+P81 
consummating the tragic ministry of the Master-Hero of the most 
sublime drama in the religious annals of mankind, signalizing the most 
dramatic event of the most turbulent period of the Heroic Age of the 
&amp;Baha'i Dispensation, destined to be recognized by posterity as the most 
precious, momentous sacrifice in the world's spiritual history.  Recall the 
peerless tributes paid to His memory by the Founder of the Faith, 
acclaiming Him Monarch of God's Messengers, the Primal Point 
round Whom the realities of all the Prophets circle in adoration.  
Profoundly stirred by the memory of the agonies He suffered, the glad-tidings 
He announced, the warnings He uttered, the forces He set in 
motion, the adversaries He converted, the disciples He raised up, the 
conflagrations He precipitated, the legacy He left of faith and courage, 
the love He inspired.  Acknowledge with bowed head, joyous, thankful 
heart the successive, marvelous evidence of His triumphant power in 
the course of the hundred years elapsed since the last crowning act of 
His meteoric ministry.  
     The creative energies released at the hour of the birth of His 
Revelation, endowing mankind with the potentialities of the attainment 
of maturity are deranging, during the present transitional age, the 
equilibrium of the entire planet as the inevitable prelude to the 
consummation in world unity of the coming of age of the human race.  
The portentous but unheeded warnings addressed to kings, princes, 
ecclesiastics are responsible for the successive overthrow of fourteen 
monarchies of East and West, the collapse of the institution of the 
Caliphate, the virtual extinction of the Pope's temporal sovereignty, the 
progressive decline in the fortunes of the ecclesiastical hierarchies of 
the &amp;Islamic, Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Hindu Faiths.  
     The Order eulogized and announced in His writings, whose laws 
&amp;Baha'u'llah subsequently revealed in the Most Holy Book, whose 
features &amp;Abdu'l-Baha delineated in His Testament, is now passing 
through its embryonic stage through the emergence of the initial 
institutions of the world Administrative Order in the five continents of 
the globe.  The clarion call sounded in the &amp;Qayyumu'l-Asma', summoning 
the peoples of the West to forsake their homes and proclaim 
His message, was nobly answered by the communities of the Western 
Hemisphere headed by the valorous, stalwart American believers, the 
chosen vanguard of the all-conquering, irresistibly marching army of 
the Faith in the western world.  
 
+P82 
     The embryonic Faith, maturing three years after His martyrdom, 
traversing the period of infancy in the course of the Heroic Age of the 
Faith is now steadily progressing towards maturity in the present 
Formative Age, destined to attain full stature in the Golden Age of the 
&amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  
     Lastly the Holy Seed of infinite preciousness, holding within 
itself incalculable potentialities representing the culmination of the 
centuries-old process of the evolution of humanity through the energies 
released by the series of progressive Revelations starting with Adam and 
concluded by the Revelation of the Seal of the Prophets, marked by the 
successive appearance of the branches, leaves, buds, blossoms and 
plucked, after six brief years by the hand of destiny, ground in the 
mill of martyrdom and oppression but yielding the oil whose first 
flickering light cast upon the somber, subterranean walls of the &amp;Siyah-Chal 
of &amp;Tihran, whose fire gathered brilliance in &amp;Baghdad and shone 
in full resplendency in its crystal globe in Adrianople, whose rays 
warmed and illuminated the fringes of the American, European, 
Australian continents through the tender ministerings of the Center 
of the Covenant, whose radiance is now overspreading the surface 
of the globe during the present Formative Age, whose full splendor 
is destined in the course of future milleniums to suffuse the entire 
planet.  
     Already the crushing of this God-imbued kernel upon the anvil of 
adversity has ignited the first sparks of the Holy Fire latent within it 
through the emergence of the firmly knit world-encompassing community 
constituting no less than twenty-five hundred centers established 
throughout a hundred countries representing over thirty races and 
extending as far north as the Arctic Circle and as far south as the Straits 
of Magallanes, equipped with literature translated into sixty languages 
and possessing endowments nearing ten million dollars, enriched 
through the erection of two Houses of Worship in the heart of the 
Asiatic and North American continents and the stately mausoleum 
reared in its World Center, consolidated through the incorporation of 
over a hundred of its national and local assemblies and reinforced 
through the proclamation of its independence in the East, its recognition 
in the West, eulogized by royalty, buttressed by nine pillars 
sustaining the future structure of its supreme administrative council, 
energized through the simultaneous prosecution of specific plans conducted 
 
+P83 
under the aegis of its national councils designed to enlarge the 
limits and extend the ramifications and consolidate the foundations of 
its divinely appointed Administrative Order over the surface of the 
entire planet.  
     I appeal on this solemn occasion, rendered doubly sacred through 
the approaching hundredth anniversary of the most devastating holocaust 
in the annals of the Faith, at this anxious hour in the fortunes of 
this travailing age, to the entire body of the American believers, the 
privileged occupants and stout-hearted defenders of the foremost citadel 
of the Faith, to rededicate themselves and resolve, no matter how 
great the perils confronting their sister communities on the European, 
Asiatic, African and Australian continents, however somber the situation 
facing both the cradle of the Faith and its World Center, however 
grievous the vicissitudes they themselves may eventually suffer, to hold 
aloft unflinchingly the torch of the Faith impregnated with the blood of 
innumerable martyrs and transmit it unimpaired so that it may add 
luster to future generations destined to labor after them.  
 
[July 4, 1950] 
 
 
A Worthy, Five-Fold Offering 
 
     The first half of the two-year austerity period, inaugurated at so 
anxious an hour in the fortunes of the Second Seven Year Plan, has 
been successfully traversed, and deserves to be regarded as a memorable 
episode in the history of the Faith and the unfoldment of the Plan in 
the North American continent.  An effort, prodigious, nation-wide, 
sustained, and reminiscent in its heroism and consecration of the 
immortal exploits of the dawn-breakers of the Apostolic Age of the 
&amp;Baha'i Dispensation, has been exerted by their spiritual descendants, in 
circumstances which, though totally different in character, are yet no 
less challenging and for a cause as meritorious--an effort that has 
indeed outshone the high endeavors that have distinguished for so long 
the record of service associated with the American &amp;Baha'i Community.  
All of its members who have participated in this collective undertaking 
should be heartily congratulated, particularly those who, by their acts of 
self-abnegation, have emulated the example of the heroes of our Faith 
at the early dawn of its history.  The entire &amp;Baha'i world is stirred when 
 
+P84 
contemplating the range of such an effort, the depth of consecration 
reached by those who have participated in it, the results it has achieved, 
the noble purpose it has served.  My heart overflows with gratitude for 
the repeated evidences of worthiness demonstrated by this generous-hearted, 
valiant and dedicated community which has, no matter how 
onerous the task, how challenging the issue, how distracting the 
external circumstances with which it has been surrounded, never 
shirked its duty or hesitated for a moment.  
     The high watermark of so gigantic an exertion, however, still 
remains to be reached.  The year now entered, ushered in and consecrated 
by the Centenary of the tragic execution of the Martyr-Prophet 
of our Faith, and packed with poignant memories of the persecutions of 
&amp;Zanjan which stained its history a hundred years ago and carried its 
fortunes to almost its lowest ebb, and were a prelude to the most ghastly 
holocaust ever experienced by its followers, must witness as it rolls 
forward to its close, a still more striking demonstration of the tenacity of 
the members of this community, a still nobler display of acts of 
self-sacrifice, a still more inspiring manifestation of solidarity, and 
evidences of a grimmer determination, of a greater courage and perseverance 
in response to the triple call of this present hour.  
     The vital needs of the most holy House of Worship reared in the 
service and for the glory of the Most Great Name, though virtually 
met, still require the last exertions to ensure its completion as the hour 
of its Jubilee approaches.  The Latin-American enterprise, initiated 
thirteen years ago, and marking the initial collective undertaking 
launched by the American &amp;Baha'i Community beyond the confines of 
the great republic of the West, and under the mandate of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
Divine Plan, still in a state of emergency and rapidly advancing 
towards its initial fruition, demands unrelaxing vigilance, and calls for 
still more strenuous exertions and self-sacrifice on the part of those who 
have so enthusiastically embarked upon it, who have so conscientiously 
and painstakingly shepherded it along its destined course and throughout 
the early stages of its unfoldment, and who are now, as a result of 
their ceaseless exertions, witnessing the first efflorescence of their 
mammoth pioneer labors.  The construction of the superstructure of the 
Holy Sepulcher of the Blessed &amp;Bab, now, at this anxious and urgent 
hour, superimposed on the manifold responsibilities shouldered by 
members of the American &amp;Baha'i Community, affording them the first 
 
+P85 
historic opportunity of directly sustaining, through their contributions, 
the most sacred enterprise ever undertaken in the history of the Faith, 
the first and most holy edifice reared at its World Center, and the initial 
international institution heralding the establishment of the supreme 
legislative body at the World Administrative Center, requires the 
immediate and sustained attention of the members of a community 
whose destiny has been linked, ever since its inception, with the various 
stages marking the rise and consolidation of this divinely appointed, 
unspeakably holy enterprise.  
 
AN HOUR LADEN WITH FATE 
 
     The hour is critical, laden with fate.  Responsibilities numerous and
varied, as well as urgent and sacred, are crowding, in quick succession, 
upon a community youthful and valorous in spirit, rich in experience, 
triumphant in the past, sensible of its future obligations, keenly aware 
of the sublimity of its world mission, inflexibly resolved to follow with 
unfaltering steps the road of its destiny.  The world situation is perilous 
and gloomy.  Rumblings from far and near bode evil for the immediate 
fortunes of a sadly distracted society.  The Second Seven Year Plan is 
now approaching its conclusion.  The Centenary of the Martyrdom of 
the &amp;Bab with all its poignant memories is upon us.  We are entering a 
period crowded with the centenaries of the direst calamities--massacres, 
sieges, captivities, spoliations and tortures involving thousands 
of heroes--men, women and children--the world's greatest Faith has 
ever experienced.  Another centenary commemorating an event as tragic 
and infinitely more glorious is fast approaching.  Time is short.  
Opportunities, though multiplying with every passing hour, will not recur, 
some for another century, others never again.  However severe the 
challenge, however multiple the tasks, however short the time, however 
somber the world outlook, however limited the material resources of a 
hard-pressed adolescent community, the untapped sources of celestial 
strength from which it can draw are measureless, in their potencies, and 
will unhesitatingly pour forth their energizing influences if the necessary 
daily effort be made and the required sacrifices be willingly 
accepted.  
     Nor should it be forgotten that in the hour of adversity and in the 
very midst of confusion, peril and uncertainty, some of the most superb 
 
+P86 
exploits, noising abroad the fame of this community have been 
achieved.  The construction of the superstructure of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar 
during one of the severest depressions experienced by the 
people of the United States in this century; the inauguration of the first 
Seven Year Plan on the eve of and during the anxious years preceding 
the second world conflagration; its vigorous prosecution during its 
darkest days and its triumph before its conclusion; the launching of the 
European campaign on the morrow of the most devastating conflict that 
rocked the continent of Europe to its foundation--these stand out as 
shining evidences of the unfailing protection, guidance and sustaining 
power vouchsafed its members, so readily and so abundantly, in the 
hour of their greatest need and danger.  
     To consolidate the victories won, and reinforce the foundations of 
the unnumbered institutions so diligently established, in the North 
American continent; to rear the twin pillars of the Universal House of 
Justice in Latin America, with their concomitant administrative agencies 
functioning in no less than twenty republics of Central and South 
America; to maintain in their present strength the strongholds of the 
Faith in the ten goal countries of Europe; to complete the interior 
ornamentation of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the West, and its 
Mother Temple, in preparation of its Jubilee; to assist in the erection of 
the superstructure of a still holier edifice, envisaged by its Founder and 
established by the Center of His Covenant on God's holy mountain, at 
the very heart and center of our beloved Faith, would indeed constitute, 
by virtue of their scope, origin and character, embracing three 
continents and including within their range the World Center of the 
Faith itself, a worthy, befitting five-fold offering placed on the altar of 
the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, on the occasion of the Centenary of the birth 
of His Mission by a community which, more than any sister community, 
in East or West, has contributed, since the inception of the 
Formative Age of His Faith to the enlargement of its limits, the rise and 
establishment of its Administrative Order and the spread of its fame, 
glory and power.  
     That this community may, in the course of these three coming 
years, discharge its five-fold task--now assuming, through the stress of 
circumstances, still vaster proportions, and investing itself with still 
greater blessedness and merit, than originally envisaged--with a spirit 
outshining any hitherto shown in the course of its half-century stewardship 
 
+P87 
to the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, is my most fervent wish and the object 
of my special and ardent prayers at this time when my heart and mind 
are fixed upon the sufferings and passion of the &amp;Bab on the occasion of 
the Centenary of His Martyrdom.  
 
[July 5, 1950] 
 
 
Ruhi and Family Show Open Defiance 
 
     Inform friends that Ruhi, his mother, with Ruha, his aunt, and 
their families, not content with years of disobedience and unworthy 
conduct, are now showing open defiance.  Confident that exemplary 
loyalty of American believers will sustain me in carrying overwhelming 
burden of cares afflicting me.  
 
[July 15, 1950] 
 
 
&amp;Non-Baha'i Gifts 
 
     All gifts by &amp;non-Baha'is are to be used for charity only.  
 
[July 24, 1950] 
 
 
Teaching in Africa 
 
     Feel moved to appeal to gallant, great-hearted American &amp;Baha'i 
Community to arise on the eve of launching the far-reaching, historic 
campaign by sister Community of the British Isles to lend valued 
assistance to the meritorious enterprise undertaken primarily for the 
illumination of the tribes of East and West Africa, envisaged in the 
Tablets of the Center of the Covenant revealed in the darkest hour of 
His ministry.  
     I appeal particularly to its dearly beloved members belonging to the 
Negro race to participate in the contemplated project marking a 
significant milestone in the world-unfoldment of the Faith, supplementing 
the work initiated fifty years ago on the North American 
continent, forging fresh links binding the American, British and 
Egyptian Communities and providing the prelude to the full-scale 
 
+P88 
operations destined to be launched at a later period of the unfoldment 
of the Divine Plan aiming at the conversion of the backward, oppressed 
masses of the swiftly awakening continent.  
     Though such participation is outside the scope of the Second Seven 
Year Plan, I feel strongly that the assumption of this added responsibility 
for this distant vital field at this crucial challenging hour, when 
world events are moving steadily towards a climax and the Centenary 
of the birth of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Mission is fast approaching, will further 
ennoble the record of the world-embracing tasks valiantly undertaken 
by the American &amp;Baha'i Community and constitute a worthy response 
to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's insistent call raised on behalf of the race He repeatedly 
blessed and loved so dearly and for whose illumination He 
ardently prayed and for whose future He cherished the brightest hopes.  
 
[August 5, 1950] 
 
 
Comforted by Messages of Devotion 
 
     My anguished heart is comforted by the unnumbered messages 
from communities, assemblies, groups, committees and individual 
American believers, replete with expressions of loving devotion, 
pledges of loyalty to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Covenant, prayers on my behalf 
and assurances of rededication in service to the precious Faith.  
     The triple cord binding me to the American Community, outstanding 
in its affectionate and unfailing support in the course of my almost 
thirty years' stewardship to the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, is greatly reinforced.  
But for America's multitudinous services and unparalleled 
record of achievements my burden of cares both past and present would 
be unbearable.  
     Far from complaining of the added weight of afflictions oppressing 
me at this hour I feel I cannot but welcome with feelings of thankfulness 
and humility such tribulations enabling me to taste the cup the 
Martyr-Prophet of our beloved Faith drained so heroically a hundred 
years ago.  
     Much as I desire to acknowledge separately all messages I regretfully 
find the task beyond the limits of my overtaxed strength.  I ask, 
dearly beloved friends, to regard this message as addressed to each one 
personally, bearing to each and every one assurance of my constant 
 
+P89 
awareness of their enfolding love and unfailing support as well as my 
everlasting gratitude and unalterable affection and immense pride in 
their unrivaled collective share in the world-wide furtherance of the 
Cause so dear, so precious to us all.  
 
[September 12, 1950] 
 
 
Relieved by Intensified Activity 
 
     My heart is greatly relieved by the splendid, welcome evidences of 
the intensified activity on the home front, Europe and Latin America.  
Supplicating bountiful blessings on the manifold enterprises energetically 
and devotedly conducted by the exemplary American &amp;Baha'i 
Community.  
 
[September 19, 1950] 
 
 
&amp;Badi'u'llah Has Miserably Perished 
 
     &amp;Badi'u'llah, brother and chief lieutenant of archbreaker of divine 
Covenant, has miserably perished after sixty years' ceaseless, fruitless 
efforts to undermine the divinely-appointed Order, having witnessed 
within the last five months the deaths of his nephews Shoa and Musa, 
notorious standard-bearers of the rebellion associated with the name of 
their perfidious father.  
 
[November 3, 1950] 
 
 
Requirements for Temple Completion 
 
     Temple not regarded as completed until all accessories are provided, 
including landscape gardening.  Public announcement and worship 
must coincide with termination of plan.  
 
[November 8, 1950] 
 
+P90 
Summer Schools to Reopen 
 
     Owing to paramount need of Shrine and Temple, advise that you 
postpone publication of magazine until 1953.  Summer schools may be 
reopened.  
 
[December 8, 1950 (Excerpt)] 
 
 
Assistance to Epoch-Making Enterprise in Africa 
 
     Assistance to Africa project through financial contribution, participation 
of pioneers white and colored, and close consultation and 
cooperation with British Assembly necessary.  Independent campaign 
not intended.  Fervently praying the participation of British, American, 
Persian, and Egyptian National Assemblies in unique, epoch-making 
enterprise in African continent may prove prelude to convocation of 
first African Teaching Conference leading eventually to initiation of 
undertakings involving collaboration among all national assemblies of 
&amp;Baha'i world, thereby paving way to ultimate organic union of these 
assemblies through formation of International House of Justice destined 
to launch enterprises embracing whole &amp;Baha'i world.  Acclaim 
simultaneous inauguration of crusade linking administrative machinery 
of four national assemblies of East and West within four continents 
and birth of first International Council at World Center of Faith, twin 
evidences of resistless unfoldment of embryonic, divinely appointed 
World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
 
[January 17, 1951] 
 
 
Status of &amp;Baha'is Regarding Military Duty 
 
     No change whatsoever in status of &amp;Baha'is in relation to active 
military duty.  No compromise of spiritual principles of Faith possible, 
however tense the situation, however aroused public opinion.  
 
[January 17, 1951] 
 
+P91 
Spiritual Conquest of the Planet 
 
     The virtual termination of the interior ornamentation of the first 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the West; the forthcoming formation of the twin 
national spiritual assemblies of Latin America, following upon the 
establishment of a corresponding institution in the Dominion of Canada; 
the full attainment of the prescribed goals on the European 
continent in accordance with the provisions of the Second Seven Year 
Plan and the consolidation already achieved in the North American 
continent, do not, under any circumstances, imply that the vast 
responsibilities shouldered by a valiant, an alert and resolute community, 
have been fully and totally discharged, or that its members can 
afford, as the plan draws to its conclusion, to sink into complacency or 
relax for one moment in their high endeavors.  
     The hour destined to mark the triumphant conclusion of the second 
stage in their historic, divinely conferred, world-encircling mission has 
not yet struck.  Rumblings, loud and persistent, presaging a crisis of 
extreme severity in world affairs, confront them with a challenge 
which, in spite of what they have already accomplished, they cannot 
and must not either ignore or underrate.  The rise of the World 
Administrative Center of their Faith, within the precincts and under 
the shadow of its World Spiritual Center, a process that has been kept 
in abeyance for well nigh thirty years, whilst the machinery of the 
national and local institutions of a nascent Order was being erected and 
perfected, presents them with an opportunity which, as the champion-builders 
of that Order and the torchbearers of an as yet unborn 
civilization, they must seize with alacrity, resolution and utter consecration. 
The initiation of momentous projects in other continents of the 
globe, and particularly in Africa, as a result of the growing initiative 
and the spirit of enterprise exhibited by their fellow-workers in East 
and West, cannot leave unmoved the vanguard of a host summoned by 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha, its Divine Commander, and in accordance with the 
provisions of a God-given Charter, to play such a preponderating role in 
the spiritual conquest of the entire planet.  Above all, the rapid 
prosecution of an enterprise transcending any undertaking, whether 
national or local, embarked upon by the followers of the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, destined to attain its consummation with the erection of 
the dome of the &amp;Bab's holy Sepulcher, imposes an added obligation, 
 
+P92 
owing to unforeseen circumstances, on the already multitudinous 
duties assumed by a community wholly absorbed in the various tasks it 
shoulders.  In fact, as the Centenary of the birth of &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
prophetic Mission approaches, His American followers, not content 
with the successful conclusion, in their entirety, of the tasks assigned to 
them, must aspire to celebrate befittingly this historic occasion, as 
becomes the chosen recipients, and the privileged trustees, of a divinely 
conceived Plan, through emblazoning with still more conspicuous 
exploits, their record of stewardship to a Faith whose Author has issued 
such a ringing call to the rulers of the American continent, and the 
Center of Whose Covenant has entrusted the American &amp;Baha'i Community 
with so glorious a mission.  Indeed the present stage in the 
construction of the superstructure of so holy a shrine imperatively 
demands a concentration of attention and resources commensurate 
with the high position occupied by this community, with the freedom it 
enjoys and the material means at its disposal.  The signing of two 
successive contracts, for the masonry of the octagon, the cylinder and 
the dome of the edifice, necessitated by a sudden worsening of the 
international situation, which might cut off indefinitely the provision 
of the same stones used for the erection of the arcade and the parapet of 
that Sepulcher, and amounting to no less than one hundred and ninety 
thousand dollars; the subsidiary contracts for the provision of steel and 
cement for the erection of the wrought iron balustrade and the metal 
window frames of both the octagon and the cylinder, involving an 
additional expenditure of no less than twenty thousand dollars, to 
which must be added the cost of the excavation for and the sinking of 
the eight piers designed to support the weight of the dome and the 
immediate construction of the octagon--these call for a stupendous 
effort on the part of all &amp;Baha'i communities and a self-abnegation 
unprecedented in &amp;Baha'i history.  A drastic reduction of national and 
local budgets; the allocation of substantial sums by all national assemblies; 
the participation of individuals through sustained and direct 
donations to the first international and incomparably holy enterprise 
synchronizing with the birth of the International &amp;Baha'i Council at the 
very heart and center of a world-encircling Faith can alone insure the 
uninterrupted progress of an undertaking which, coupled with the 
completion of the Mother Temple of the West, cannot fail to produce 
tremendous repercussions in the Holy Land, in the North American 
 
+P93 
continent and throughout the world.  A period of austerity covering the 
two-year interval separating us from the Centenary celebrations of the 
Year Nine, prolonging so unexpectedly the austerity period already 
traversed by the American &amp;Baha'i Community, and now extended to 
embrace its sister communities throughout the &amp;Baha'i world, is evidently 
not only essential for the attainment of so transcendent a goal, 
but also supremely befitting when we recall the nature and dimensions 
of the holocaust which a hundred years ago crimson-dyed the annals of 
our Faith, which posterity will recognize as the bloodiest episode of the 
most tragic period of the Heroic Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation, 
which involved the martyrdom of that incomparable heroine &amp;Tahirih, 
which was immediately preceded by the imprisonment of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
in the subterranean dungeon of &amp;Tihran, and which sealed the fate of 
thousands of men, women and children in circumstances of unspeakable 
savagery and on a scale unapproached throughout subsequent 
stages of &amp;Baha'i history.  
 
NO SACRIFICE TOO GREAT 
 
     No sacrifice can be deemed too great, no expenditure of material 
resources, no degree of renunciation of worldly benefits, comfort and 
pleasures, can be regarded as excessive when we recall the precious 
blood that flowed, the many lives that were snuffed out, the wealth of 
material possessions that was plundered during these most tumultuous 
and cataclysmic years of the Heroic Age of our Faith.  
     Nor will the sacrifices willingly and universally accepted by the 
followers of the Faith in East and West for the sake of so noble a Cause, 
so transcendent an enterprise, fail to contribute their share towards the 
upbuilding of the World Administrative Center of that Faith, and the 
reinforcement of the ties already linking this Center with the recognized 
authorities of a state under the jurisdiction of which it is now 
functioning, ties which the newly formed International &amp;Baha'i Council 
are so assiduously striving to cement.  
     Already the completion of the construction of the arcade of this 
majestic Sepulcher and of its ornamental parapet has excited the 
admiration, stimulated the interest, and enlisted the support, of both 
the local authorities and of the central government, as evidenced by the 
series of acts which, ever since the emergence of that state, have 
proclaimed the good will shown and the recognition extended by the 
 
+P94 
various departments of that state to the multiplying international 
institutions, endowments, laws and ordinances of a steadily rising 
Faith.  
     The recognition of the sacred nature of the twin holy Shrines, 
situated in the plain of &amp;Akka and on the slopes of Mount Carmel; the 
exemption from state and civic taxes, granted to the mansion of &amp;Bahji 
adjoining the Most Holy Shrine, to the twin houses, that of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
in &amp;Akka, and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in Haifa, to the twin archives, adjoining 
the Shrine of the &amp;Bab and the resting-place of the Greatest Holy Leaf, 
and the twin pilgrim houses constructed in the neighborhood of that 
Shrine, and of the residence of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha; the delivery of the 
mansion of &amp;Mazra'ih by the authorities of that same state to the &amp;Baha'i 
Community and its occupation after a lapse of more than fifty years; the 
setting apart, through government action, of the room occupied by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in the barracks of &amp;Akka, as a place of pilgrimage; the 
recognition of the &amp;Baha'i marriage certificate by the District Commissioner 
of Haifa; the recognition of the &amp;Baha'i holy days, in an official 
circular published by the Ministry of Education and Culture; the 
exemption from duty accorded by the Customs Department to all 
furniture received for &amp;Baha'i holy places as well as for all material 
imported for the construction of the &amp;Bab's Sepulcher, the exemption 
from taxes similarly extended to all international &amp;Baha'i endowments 
surrounding the holy tomb on Mount Carmel, stretching from the 
ridge of the mountain to the Templar colony at its foot, as well as to the 
holdings in the immediate vicinity of the resting-place of the Greatest 
Holy Leaf and her kinsmen--all these establish, beyond the shadow of 
a doubt, the high status enjoyed by the international institutions of a 
world Faith, in the eyes of this newborn state.  
     The construction of the mausoleum of the &amp;Bab, synchronizing with 
the birth of that state, and the progress of which has been accompanied 
by these successive manifestations of the good will and support of the 
civil authorities will, if steadily maintained, greatly reinforce, and lend 
a tremendous impetus to this process of recognition which constitutes 
an historic landmark in the evolution of the World Center of the Faith 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah--a process which the newly formed Council, now established 
at its very heart, is designed to foster, which will gather 
momentum, with the emergence in the course of time of a properly 
recognized and independently functioning &amp;Baha'i court, which will 
 
+P95 
attain its consummation in the institution of the Universal House of 
Justice and the emergence of the auxiliary administrative agencies, 
revolving around this highest legislative body, and which will reveal 
the plenitude of its potentialities with the sailing of the Divine Ark as 
promised in the Tablet of Carmel.  
     I cannot at this juncture over emphasize the sacredness of that holy 
dust embosomed in the heart of the Vineyard of God, or overrate the 
unimaginable potencies of this mighty institution founded sixty years 
ago, through the operation of the Will of, and the definite selection 
made by, the Founder of our Faith, on the occasion of His historic visit 
to that holy mountain, nor can I lay too much stress on the role which 
this institution, to which the construction of the superstructure of this 
edifice is bound to lend an unprecedented impetus, is destined to play 
in the unfoldment of the World Administrative Center of the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah and in the efflorescence of its highest institutions constituting 
the embryo of its future World Order.  
 
THE CENTER OF NINE CONCENTRIC CIRCLES 
 
     For, just as in the realm of the spirit, the reality of the &amp;Bab has been 
hailed by the Author of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation as "The Point round 
Whom the realities of the Prophets and Messengers revolve," so, on this 
visible plane, His sacred remains constitute the heart and center of 
what may be regarded as nine concentric circles, paralleling thereby, 
and adding further emphasis to the central position accorded by the 
Founder of our Faith to One "from Whom God hath caused to proceed 
the knowledge of all that was and shall be," "the Primal Point from 
which have been generated all created things."  
     The outermost circle in this vast system, the visible counterpart of 
the pivotal position conferred on the Herald of our Faith, is none other 
than the entire planet.  Within the heart of this planet lies the "Most 
Holy Land," acclaimed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha as "the Nest of the Prophets" 
and which must be regarded as the center of the world and the Qiblih 
of the nations.  Within this Most Holy Land rises the Mountain of God 
of immemorial sanctity, the Vineyard of the Lord, the Retreat of Elijah, 
Whose return the &amp;Bab Himself symbolizes.  Reposing on the breast of 
this holy mountain are the extensive properties permanently dedicated 
to, and constituting the sacred precincts of, the &amp;Bab's holy Sepulcher.  
In the midst of these properties, recognized as the international endowments 
 
+P96 
of the Faith, is situated the most holy court, an enclosure 
comprising gardens and terraces which at once embellish, and lend a 
peculiar charm to, these sacred precincts.  Embosomed in these lovely 
and verdant surroundings stands in all its exquisite beauty the mausoleum 
of the &amp;Bab, the shell designed to preserve and adorn the original 
structure raised by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha as the tomb of the Martyr-Herald of 
our Faith.  Within this shell is enshrined that Pearl of Great Price, the 
holy of holies, those chambers which constitute the tomb itself, and 
which were constructed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  Within the heart of this 
holy of holies is the tabernacle, the vault wherein reposes the most holy 
casket.  Within this vault rests the alabaster sarcophagus in which is 
deposited that inestimable jewel, the &amp;Bab's holy dust.  So precious is this 
dust that the very earth surrounding the edifice enshrining this dust has 
been extolled by the Center of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant, in one of His 
Tablets in which He named the five doors belonging to the six 
chambers which He originally erected after five of the believers 
associated with the construction of the Shrine, as being endowed with 
such potency as to have inspired Him in bestowing these names, whilst 
the tomb itself housing this dust He acclaimed as the spot round which 
the Concourse on high circle in adoration.  
     To participate in the erection of the superstructure of an edifice at 
once so precious, so holy; consecrated to the memory of so heroic a Soul; 
whose site no one less than the Founder of our Faith has selected; 
whose inner chambers were erected by the Center of His Covenant 
with such infinite care and anguish; embosomed in so sacred a mountain, 
on the soil of so holy a land; occupying such a unique position; 
facing on the one hand the silver-white city of &amp;Akka, the Qiblih of the 
&amp;Baha'i world; flanked on its right by the hills of Galilee, the home of 
Jesus Christ, and on its left, by the Cave of Elijah; and backed by the 
plain of Sharon and, beyond it, Jerusalem and the &amp;Aqsa mosque, the 
third holiest shrine in &amp;Islam--to participate in the erection of such an 
edifice is a privilege offered to this generation at once unique and 
priceless, a privilege which only posterity will be able to correctly 
appraise.  
 
THE CHOSEN TRUSTEES OF A DIVINE PLAN 
 
     In this supreme, this sacred and international undertaking in which 
the followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah, in all the continents of the globe, are 
summoned to show forth the noblest spirit of self-sacrifice, the members 
 
+P97 
of the American &amp;Baha'i Community must by virtue of the abilities they 
have already demonstrated and of the primacy conferred upon them as 
the chosen trustees of a Divine Plan, play a preponderating role, and, 
together with their brethren residing in the cradle of their Faith, who 
are linked by such unique ties with its Herald, set an example of
self-abnegation worthy to be emulated by their fellow-workers in every 
land.  
     Whilst the members of this privileged community, laboring so 
valiantly in the Western Hemisphere, are widening the range of their 
manifold activities, and thereby augmenting their responsibilities, in 
both the Holy Land and the African continent, the original tasks, 
associated with the prosecution of the Second Seven Year Plan, must, 
simultaneously with this added and meritorious effort which is being 
exerted, in memory of the beloved &amp;Bab, and for the spiritual emancipation 
of the downtrodden races of Africa, be carried to a triumphant 
conclusion.  Though the present deficit in their National Fund may, in 
a sense, register a failure on their part to meet their pressing obligations, 
and may arouse in their hearts feelings of self-reproach and anxiety, I 
can confidently assert that the supplementary duties they have discharged, 
and the material support they have extended, and are now 
extending, for the conduct of activities, not falling within the original 
scope of their Plan, not only fully compensate for an apparent shortcoming, 
but constitute, instead of a stain on their record of service, 
additional embellishments to the scroll already inscribed with so many 
exploits for the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Assured that no blot has marred so splendid a record of service; 
confident of their destiny; reliant on the unfailing guidance of the 
Founder of their Faith as well as on His sustaining power, let them 
address themselves, with unrelaxing vigilance and undiminished vigor, 
to the task of rounding off the several missions undertaken by them in 
Latin America, and in the North American and European continents.  
     The extension of the necessary material support and administrative 
guidance to the forthcoming national assemblies of Central and South 
America that will enable them to develop along sound lines and without 
any setback in the course of their unfoldment; the steady consolidation 
of the victories already won in the ten goal countries of Europe; the 
maintenance, at its present level and at whatever cost, of the status of 
the assemblies and groups so laboriously built up; the provision of 
 
+P98 
whatever is required to fully complete the interior of the Temple and 
beautify the grounds surrounding it, in preparation for its formal 
inauguration and its use for public worship--these should be regarded 
as the essential objectives of the American &amp;Baha'i Community during 
the two-year interval separating us from the Centenary celebrations of 
the prophetic mission of the Founder of our Faith.  
     Time is running short.  The effort required to discharge the manifold 
responsibilities now challenging the members of a lion-hearted 
community is truly colossal.  The issues at stake, demanding every 
ounce of their energy, are incomparably glorious.  An ominous international 
situation emphasizes this challenge and reinforces the urgency of 
these issues.  In the Holy Land, amid the tribes of a dark continent, over 
the wide expanses stretching from Panama to the extremity of Chile, in 
the heart of its own homeland, as well as in the new European field, 
marking the projection of its world mission across the seas, the American 
&amp;Baha'i Community must deploy its forces, hoist still higher its 
pennants, and erect still more glorious memorials to the heroism, the 
constancy and the devotion of its members.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, Whose Plan 
they are executing in both hemispheres, and to Whose summons they 
are now responding in the African continent; the &amp;Bab, Whose 
Sepulcher they are helping to erect; above all &amp;Baha'u'llah, Whose 
embryonic World Order they are building in the Holy Land and in 
other continents of the globe, look down upon them from Their retreats 
of glory, applauding their acts, guiding their footsteps, vouchsafing 
Their blessings, and laying up, in the storehouses of the &amp;Abha kingdom 
such treasures as only They can bestow.  
     May the members of this community prove themselves, as they 
forge ahead and approach yet another milestone on the broad highway 
of their mission, worthy of still greater prizes, and fit to launch still 
mightier enterprises, for the glory of the Name they bear, and in the 
service of the Faith they profess.

First American Pioneer to Africa 
 
     Rejoice at departure of first pioneer to Africa; urge acceleration of 
historic process now set in motion.  Time is short, tasks ahead manifold, 
pressing, momentous.  Praying ardently for increasing response and 
 
+P99 
befitting discharge of mighty supplementary task shouldered by valorous 
community.  
 
[October 19, 1951] 
 
 
Message to 1951 State Conventions 
 
     Advise assembled friends to focus attention on vital, pressing, 
paramount needs of National Fund at this critical juncture.  Hour is 
ripe to recall unnumbered tribulations, sacrifices heroically endured by 
the dawn-breakers, culminating in &amp;Baha'u'llah's afflictive imprisonment 
in &amp;Siyah &amp;Chal, Centennial of which is now approaching.  Urge 
deepening realization of sacredness, preeminent importance of twin 
purposes which individual resolves serve.  Appeal for immediate, unanimous, 
sustained, decisive response, safeguard thereby American 
Community's share in tribute to memory of Founder of Faith on 
occasion of forthcoming Jubilee of Birth of glorious Mission.  Praying 
for befitting answer to heartfelt plea.  
 
[November 4, 1951] 
 
 
The Last and Irretrievable Chance 
 
     The brief interval separating the hard-pressed, valiantly struggling, 
resistlessly expanding American &amp;Baha'i Community from the anticipated 
consummation of the second, fate-laden collective enterprise 
launched so auspiciously by its national elected representatives is 
speedily drawing to a close.  The sixteen months that still lie ahead 
constitute in view of the tasks that still remain to be achieved, and the 
sacrifices still to be made, a period at once critical and challenging.  This 
memorable period commemorates, if we pause and call to mind the 
stirring events and bloody episodes linking the Dispensation of the &amp;Bab 
with the dawning Mission of the Founder of our Faith, the centenary 
of what may be truly regarded as the darkest, the most tragic, the most 
heroic, period in the annals of a hundred-year-old Revelation.  This 
period, moreover, affords the last and irretrievable chance to a ceaselessly 
striving, repeatedly victorious community of setting the seal of 
triumph upon a momentous undertaking, on whose fate hinges the 
launching of yet another glorious Crusade, the consummation of which 
 
+P100 
will mark the successful conclusion of the initial epoch in the unfoldment 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan--an evolution that must continue 
to blossom and fructify in the course of successive epochs of the 
Formative Ages of the Faith, and yield its fairest fruit in the Golden 
Age that is yet to come.  
 
A PERIOD OF HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE
 
     The historic significance of this period cannot indeed be overestimated.  
For it was a hundred years ago that a Faith, which had already 
been oppressed by a staggering weight of untold tribulations; which 
had sustained shattering blows in &amp;Mazindaran, &amp;Nayriz, &amp;Tihran and 
&amp;Zanjan, and indeed throughout every province in the land of its birth; 
which had lost its greatest exponents through the tragic martyrdom of 
most of the Letters of the Living, and particularly of the valiant &amp;Mulla 
&amp;Husayn and of the erudite &amp;Vahid and which had been afflicted with the 
supreme calamity of losing its Divine Founder; was being subjected to 
still more painful ordeals--ordeals which robbed it of both the heroic 
&amp;Hujjat and of the far-famed &amp;Tahirih; which caused it to pass through a 
reign of terror, and to experience a blood-bath of unprecedented 
severity, which inflicted on it one of the greatest humiliations it has 
ever suffered through the attempted assassination of the sovereign 
himself, and which unloosed a veritable deluge of barbarous atrocities 
in &amp;Tihran, &amp;Mazindaran, &amp;Nayriz and &amp;Shiraz before which paled the horrors 
of the siege of &amp;Zanjan, and which swept no less a figure than 
&amp;Baha'u'llah Himself--the last remaining pillar of a Faith that had been 
so rudely shaken, so ruthlessly denuded of its chief buttresses--into 
the subterranean dungeon of &amp;Tihran, an imprisonment that was soon 
followed by His cruel banishment, in the depths of an exceptionally 
severe winter, from His native land to &amp;Iraq.  To these tribulations He 
Himself has referred as "afflictions" that "rained" upon Him, whilst the 
blood shed by His companions and lovers He characterized as the blood 
which "impregnated" the earth with the "wondrous revelation" of 
God's "might."  
     Nor should the momentous character of the unique event, that may 
be regarded as the climax and consummation of this tragic period, be 
overlooked or underestimated, inasmuch as its centenary synchronizes 
with the termination of the sixteen-month interval separating the 
American &amp;Baha'i Community from the conclusion of its present Plan.  
 
+P101 
This unique event, the centenary of which is to be befittingly celebrated, 
not only in the American continent but throughout the &amp;Baha'i 
world, and is destined to be regarded as the culmination of the Second 
Seven Year Plan, is none other than the "Year Nine," anticipated 2,000 
years ago as the "third woe" by St. John the Divine, alluded to by both 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad and Siyyid &amp;Kazim--the twin luminaries that heralded 
the advent of the Faith of the &amp;Bab--specifically mentioned and extolled 
by the Herald of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation in His Writings, and 
eulogized by both the Founder of our Faith and the Center of His 
Covenant.  In that year, the year "after Hin" (68), mentioned by 
&amp;Shaykh &amp;Ahmad, the year that witnessed the birth of the Mission of the 
promised "&amp;Qayyum," specifically referred to by &amp;Siyyid &amp;Kazim, the 
"requisite number" in the words of &amp;Baha'u'llah "of pure, of wholly 
consecrated and sanctified souls" had been "most secretly consummated."  
In that year, as testified by the pen of the &amp;Bab, the "realities 
of the created things" were "made manifest," "a new creation was born" 
and the seed of His Faith revealed its "ultimate perfection."  In that 
year, as borne witness by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, a hitherto "embryonic Faith" 
was born.  In that year, while the Blessed Beauty lay in chains and fetters, 
in that dark and pestilential pit, "the breezes of the All-Glorious," 
as He Himself described it, "were wafted" over Him.  There, whilst His 
neck was weighted down by the &amp;Qara-Guhar, His feet in stocks, breathing 
the fetid air of the &amp;Siyah-Chal, He dreamed His dream and heard, 
"on every side," "exalted words," and His "tongue recited" words that 
"no man could bear to hear."  
     There, as He Himself has recorded, under the impact of this dream, 
He experienced the onrushing force of His newly revealed Mission, 
that "flowed" even as "a mighty torrent" from His "head" to His 
"breast," whereupon "every limb" of His body "would be set afire."  
There, in a vision, the "Most Great Spirit," as He Himself has again 
testified, appeared to Him, in the guise of a "Maiden" "calling" with "a 
most wondrous, a most sweet voice" above His Head, whilst "suspended 
in the air" before Him and, "pointing with her finger" unto His 
head, imparted "tidings which rejoiced" His "soul."  There appeared 
above the horizon of that dungeon in the city of &amp;Tihran, the rim of the 
Orb of His Faith, whose dawning light had, nine years previously, 
broken upon the city of &amp;Shiraz--an Orb which, after suffering an 
eclipse of ten years, was destined to burst forth, with its resplendent 
 
+P102 
rays, upon the city of &amp;Baghdad, to mount its zenith in Adrianople, and 
to set eventually in the prison-fortress of &amp;Akka.  
     Such is the year we are steadily approaching.  Such is the year with 
which the fortunes of the Second Seven Year Plan have been linked.  
As the tribulations, humiliations and trials inflicted on the Cause of 
God in Persia, a century ago, moved inexorably towards a climax, so 
must the present austerity period, inaugurated a hundred years later, in 
the continent of America, to reflect the privations and sacrifices endured 
so stoically by the dawn-breakers of the Heroic Age of the Faith 
witness, as it approaches its culmination, a self-abnegation on the part 
of the champion-builders of the World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah, laboring 
in the present Formative Age of His Faith, which, at its best, can be 
regarded as but a faint reflection of the self-sacrifice so gloriously 
evinced by their spiritual forbears.  
 
OBJECTIVES OF SECOND SEVEN YEAR PLAN LARGELY ATTAINED
 
     The objectives of the Second Seven Year Plan, the concluding 
phase of which has synchronized with this period of nation-wide 
austerity, have, it must be recognized, been in the main, attained.  The 
pillars which must needs add their strength in supporting the future 
House of Justice have, according to the schedule laid down, been 
successively erected in the Dominion of Canada and in Latin America.  
The European Teaching Campaign--the second outstanding enterprise 
launched, beyond the confines of the North American continent, 
in pursuance of the Mandate, issued by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
valiant "Apostles"--has not only achieved its original aims, but exceeded 
all expectations through the formation of a local spiritual 
assembly in the capital city of each of the ten goal countries included 
within its scope.  The interior ornamentation of the Mother Temple of 
the West has, before its appointed time, been completed.  Other tasks, 
no less vital, still remain to be carried, in the course of a fast shrinking 
period, to a successful conclusion.  The landscaping of the area surrounding 
a structure whose foundations and exterior and interior 
ornamentation have demanded, for so many years, so much effort and 
such constant sacrifice, must, under no circumstances, and while there 
is yet time, be neglected, lest failure to achieve this final task mar the 
beauty of the approaches of a national shrine which provide so suitable 
 
+P103 
a setting for an edifice at once so sacred and noble.  The responsibilities 
solemnly undertaken to consolidate and multiply the administrative 
institutions throughout all the states of the Union--a task that has 
of late been allowed to fall into abeyance, and has been eclipsed by the 
spectacular success attending the shining exploits of the American 
&amp;Baha'i Community in foreign fields--must be speedily and seriously 
reconsidered, for upon the constant broadening and the steady reinforcement 
of this internal administrative structure, which provides the 
essential base for future operations in all the continents of the globe, 
must depend the vigor, the rapidity and the soundness of the future 
crusades which must needs be launched in the service, and for the glory 
of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and in obedience to the stirring summons 
issued by the Center of His Covenant in some of His most weighty 
Tablets.  Above all, the accumulating deficit which has lately again 
thrown its somber shadow on an otherwise resplendent record of 
service, must, through a renewed display of self-abnegation, which, 
though not commensurate with the sacrifice of so many souls immolated 
on the altar of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, may at least faintly reflect its 
poignant heroism, be obliterated, once and for all, from the record of 
a splendid stewardship to His Faith.  
     There can be no doubt--and I am the first to proudly acknowledge 
it--that, ever since the launching of the Second Seven Year Plan, and 
in consequence of unexpected developments both in the Holy Land 
and elsewhere, the American &amp;Baha'i Community, ever ready to bear the 
brunt of responsibility, under the stress of unforeseen circumstances, 
has considerably widened the scope of its original undertakings and 
augmented the weight shouldered by its stalwart members.  At the 
World Center of the Faith, in response to the urgent call for action, 
necessitated by the imperative needs of the rising Sepulcher of the &amp;Bab, 
the formation of the &amp;Baha'i International Council, and the establishment 
of the State of Israel, as well as in the continent of Africa, where 
the appointed, the chief trustees of a divinely conceived, world-encompassing 
Plan could not well remain unmoved by the sight of the 
first attempts being made to introduce systematically the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah and to implant its banner amongst its tribes and races, the 
American &amp;Baha'i Community have assumed responsibilities well exceeding 
the original duties they had undertaken to discharge.  This twofold 
opportunity that providentially presented itself to them, to contribute 
 
+P104 
to the rise and consolidation of the World Center of their Faith, 
and to the spiritual re-awakening of a long-neglected continent, must, 
however, be exploited to the fullest extent, if the early completion of 
the most sacred edifice, next to the &amp;Qiblih of the &amp;Baha'i world, is to be 
assured, and if the executors of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Plan are to retain 
untarnished the primacy conferred upon them by its Author.  
     That primacy will be demonstrated and re-emphasized as the 
representatives of this privileged community take their place, and 
assume their functions, at each of the four Intercontinental &amp;Baha'i 
Teaching Conferences which are to be convened in the course of, and 
which must signalize, the world-wide celebrations of the Centenary of 
the Year Nine.  Playing a preponderating role, as the custodians of a 
Divine Plan, in the global crusade which all the &amp;Baha'i national 
spiritual assemblies, without exception, must, in various degrees and 
combinations, launch on the morrow of the forthcoming Centenary, 
and during the entire course of the ten-year interval separating them 
from the Most Great Jubilee, they must, upon the consummation of 
their present Plan, deliberate, together with their ally the Canadian 
National Assembly, and their associates, the newly formed National 
Spiritual Assemblies of Central and South America, on the occasion of 
the convocation of the approaching All-American Teaching Conference, 
on ways and means whereby they can best contribute to the 
establishment of the Faith, not only throughout the Americas and their 
neighboring islands, but in the chief sovereign states and dependencies 
of the remaining continents of the globe.  
 
SCOPE OF THIRD SEVEN YEAR PLAN WIDENED
 
     For unlike the First and Second Seven Year Plans, inaugurated by 
the American &amp;Baha'i Community, the scope of the Third Seven Year 
Plan, the termination of which will mark the conclusion of the first 
epoch in the evolution of the Master Plan designed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
will embrace all the continents of the earth, and will bring the central 
body directing these widely ramified operations into direct contact with 
all the national assemblies of the &amp;Baha'i world, which, in varying 
degrees, will have to contribute their share to the world establishment 
of the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah, as prophesied by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and 
envisioned by Daniel--a consummation that, God willing, will be 
befittingly celebrated on the occasion of the Most Great Jubilee 
 
+P105 
commemorating the hundredth anniversary of the formal assumption 
by &amp;Baha'u'llah of His Prophetic Office.  
     The vision now disclosed to the eyes of this community is indeed 
enthralling.  The tasks which, if that vision is to be fulfilled, must be 
valiantly shouldered by its members are staggering.  The time during 
which so herculean a task is to be performed is alarmingly brief.  The 
period during which so gigantic an operation must be set in motion, 
prosecuted and consummated, coincides with the critical, and perhaps 
the darkest and most tragic, stage in human affairs.  The opportunities 
presenting themselves to them are now close at hand.  The invisible 
battalions of the Concourse on High are mustered, in serried ranks, 
ready to rush their reinforcements to the aid of the vanguard of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's crusaders in the hour of their greatest need, and in 
anticipation of that Most Great, that Wondrous Jubilee in the joyfulness 
of which both heaven and earth will partake.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, the 
Founder of this community and the Author of the Plan which constitutes 
its birthright, to Whose last wishes its members so marvelously 
responded; the &amp;Bab, the Centenary of Whose Revelation this same 
community so magnificently celebrated, and to the building of whose 
Sepulcher it has given so fervent a support; &amp;Baha'u'llah Himself, to the 
glory of Whose Name so stately an edifice it has raised, will amply bless 
and repay its members if they but persevere on the long road they have 
so steadfastly trodden, and pursue, with undimmed vision, with unrelaxing 
resolve and unshakable faith, their onward march towards their 
chosen goal.  
     That this community, so young in years, yet withal so rich in 
exploits, may, in the months immediately ahead, as well as in the years 
immediately following this coming Jubilee, maintain, untarnished and 
unimpaired, its record of service to our beloved Faith, that it may further 
embellish, through still nobler feats, its annals, is the dearest wish 
of my heart, and the object of my constant supplications at the Holy 
Threshold.

Forty-Fifth Annual Convention:  U.S. Tasks in World Crusade 
 
     My soul is uplifted in joy and thanksgiving at the triumphant 
conclusion of the Second Seven Year Plan immortalized by the brilliant 
victories simultaneously won by the vanguard of the hosts of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah in Latin America, in Europe and in Africa--victories 
befittingly crowned through the consummation of a fifty year old 
enterprise, the completion of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the western 
world.  The signal success that has attended the second collective 
enterprise undertaken in the course of American &amp;Baha'i history climaxes 
a term of stewardship to the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, of almost three 
score years' duration--a period which has enriched the annals of the 
concluding epoch of the Heroic, and shed luster on the first thirty years 
of the Formative Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  So fecund a period 
has been marked by teaching activities unexcelled throughout the 
western world and has been distinguished by administrative exploits 
unparalleled in the annals of any &amp;Baha'i national community whether 
in the East or in the West.  I am impelled, on the occasion of the 
anniversary of the Most Great Festival, coinciding with a triple 
celebration--the dedication of the Mother Temple of the West, the 
launching of a World Spiritual Crusade and the commemoration of the 
Birth of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Mission--to pay warmest tribute to the preeminent 
share which the American &amp;Baha'i Community has had in the 
course of over half a century in proclaiming His Revelation, in shielding 
His Cause, in championing His Covenant, in erecting the administrative 
machinery of His embryonic World Order, in expounding His 
teachings, in translating and disseminating His Holy Word, in dispatching 
the messengers of His Glad Tidings, in awakening royalty to 
His Call, in succoring His oppressed followers, in routing His enemies, 
in upholding His Law, in asserting the independence of His Faith, in 
multiplying the financial resources of its nascent institutions and, last 
but not least, in rearing its greatest House of Worship--the first 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the western world.  
 
+P107 
     The hour is now ripe for this greatly gifted, richly blessed community 
to arise and reaffirm, through the launching of yet another 
enterprise, its primacy, enhance its spiritual heritage, plumb greater 
depths of consecration and capture loftier heights in the course of its 
strenuous and ceaseless labors for the exaltation of God's Cause.  
     The Ten Year Plan, constituting the third and final stage of the 
initial epoch in the evolution of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Master Plan, which, 
God willing, will raise to greater heights the fame of the stalwart 
American &amp;Baha'i Community, and seat it upon "the throne of an 
everlasting dominion," envisaged by the Author of the Tablets of this 
same Plan, involves:  
     First, the opening of the following virgin territories, eleven in 
Africa:  Cape Verde Islands, Canary Islands, French Somaliland, 
French Togoland, Mauritius, Northern Territories Protectorate, Portuguese 
Guinea, Reunion Island, Spanish Guinea, St. Helena and St.  
Thomas Island; eight in Asia:  Caroline Islands, Dutch New Guinea, 
Hainan Island, Kazakhstan, Macao Island, Sakhalin Island, Tibet and 
Tonga Islands; six in Europe:  Andorra, Azores, Balearic Islands, 
Lofoten Islands, Spitzbergen and Ukraine; and four in America:  
Aleutian Islands, Falkland Islands, Key West and Kodiak Island.  
     Second, the consolidation of the Faith in the following territories, 
six in Asia:  China, Formosa, Japan, Korea, Manchuria, Philippine

the immortal Tablets of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan, the foremost 
executors of the Mandate issued by the Center of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant, 
the champion-builders of a divinely conceived Administrative 
Order, the standard-bearers of the all-conquering army of the Lord of 
Hosts, the torchbearers of a future divinely inspired world 
civilization--arise, in the course of the momentous decade separating 
the Great from the Most Great Jubilee to secure, as befits its rank, the 
lion's share in the prosecution of a global crusade designed to diffuse 
the light of God's revelation over the surface of the entire planet.  
 
[April 29, 1953] 
 
 
Intending Pioneers Urged to Scatter 
 
     Strongly urge intending pioneers to scatter as widely as possible, 
settle even territories, islands not specifically assigned to United States.  
Prompt opening of virgin territories is highly meritorious, extremely 
urgent, vital prerequisite to insure triumphant conclusion of opening 
phase of Global Crusade, prerogative of chief executors of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
Plan.  May enrolled pioneers arise and confirm primacy of 
American &amp;Baha'i Community playing preponderating role in initial 
stage of spiritual conquest of unopened territories and islands of the 
planet.  
 
+P110 
[May 13, 1953] 
 
 
A Turning Point in American &amp;Baha'i History 
 
     My soul is thrilled and my heart is filled with gratitude as I 
contemplate--looking back upon six decades of eventful American 
&amp;Baha'i history--the chain of magnificent achievements which, from 
the dawn of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the West until the present day, 
have signalized the birth, marked the rise and distinguished the unfoldment 
of the glorious mission of the American &amp;Baha'i Community.  Of 
all &amp;Baha'i communities in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, 
with the sole exception of its venerable sister community in 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's native land, it alone may well claim to have released 
forces, and set in motion events, which stand unparalleled in the annals 
of the Faith; while in the course of the last fifty years, comprising the 
concluding years of the Heroic and the opening epochs of the Formative 
Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation, it can confidently boast of a record 
of stewardship which, for its scope, effectiveness and splendor, is unmatched 
by that of any other community in the entire &amp;Baha'i world.  
     The first to awaken to the call of the New Day in the western 
world; the first to spontaneously arise to befittingly erect the Mother 
Temple of the West; the first to grasp the implications, evolve the 
pattern and lay the basis of the structure of the &amp;Baha'i Administrative 
Order in the entire &amp;Baha'i world; the first to openly and systematically 
proclaim the fundamental principles of the Faith, to adopt effectual 
measures for its defense, to invite the attention of royalty to its 
teachings, to devise an adequate machinery for the translation, the 
publication and the dissemination of its literature and to provide the 
means for the creation of its subsidiary institutions; the first to champion 
the cause of the oppressed and to generously contribute to the 
alleviation of the sufferings of the needy and persecuted among the 
followers of &amp;Baha'u'llah; the first to inaugurate collective enterprises for 
the propagation of His Cause; the first to assert its independence in the 
West; the first to lay an unassailable foundation for the erection of 
auxiliary institutions designed to multiply its financial resources; and, 
more recently, the first to achieve, as befits its primacy, the initial task 
devolving upon it in pursuance of the newly launched World Spiritual 
 
+P111 
Crusade, this community has abundantly merited, by the quality of its 
deeds and the magnitude of its exploits, the distinctive titles of the 
cradle of the World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah, of the vanguard of His 
world-conquering host, of the standard-bearers of the oneness of mankind, 
of the chief trustees of the Plan devised by the Center of the 
Covenant and of the torch-bearers of an as yet unborn world civilization.  
 
RECENT SERVICES DESERVING MENTION
 
     The services rendered by this same community in recent years, in 
its capacity as the chief executors of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan, in the 
course of the second stage of the initial epoch in its evolution, are of 
such importance and significance as to deserve particular mention at 
this time.  In the North American continent, throughout the republics 
of Latin America, in the ten goal countries of Europe, on the shores and 
in the heart of the African continent, the members of this community 
have, in conformity with the provisions of the Second Seven Year Plan, 
performed feats of such noble and enduring heroism as to enhance 
immensely their prestige, demonstrate unmistakably the caliber of their 
faith and qualify them to assume a preponderating share in the 
prosecution of the Ten Year Plan whose operations are to extend over 
the entire surface of the globe.  
     In the multiplication and consolidation of &amp;Baha'i administrative 
institutions and their auxiliary agencies throughout Central America, 
the Antilles and every South American republic--a task supplementing 
the initial enterprise undertaken, in pursuance of the first Seven 
Year Plan, in connection with the introduction of the Faith into the 
republics of Latin America; in the even more rapid development of 
nascent institutions of the Faith in Scandinavia, in the Benelux 
countries, in Switzerland, in the Italian and Iberian Peninsulas; in the 
laying of the administrative basis of the World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah in 
the capital and in some of the major cities of each of the ten European 
sovereign states included within the scope of the Plan; in the convocation 
of a series of historic teaching conferences in the north and in the 
heart of the European continent--heralding the convocation of the 
recently held, epoch-making Intercontinental Teaching Conferences; 
in the translation, the publication and dissemination of &amp;Baha'i literature 
in various European languages; in the still more dramatic evolution 
 
+P112 
of the Faith in the African continent, culminating in the convocation 
of the first Intercontinental Teaching Conference of the Holy Year in 
the heart of Africa; in the tremendous sacrifices spontaneously and 
repeatedly made to broaden and reinforce the foundations of the Faith 
in the North American continent, to sustain the campaigns undertaken 
in Latin America, Europe and Africa, and to meet the many demands 
of the &amp;Baha'i Temple, rapidly nearing completion in Wilmette; in the 
successive emergence of three national spiritual assemblies in the Western 
Hemisphere--an outstanding contribution to the evolution and 
consolidation of the structure of the world Administrative Order of the 
Faith; in the completion of the interior ornamentation of the first 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the West, the provision of its accessories and the 
initiation of the landscaping of its grounds; in the support extended to 
the development of the institutions of the World Center of the Faith; 
in the role played by its representatives, whether as Hands of the Cause 
or members of the International &amp;Baha'i Council; in the financial aid 
unhesitatingly given to hasten the construction, and insure the completion, 
of the superstructure of the &amp;Bab's Sepulcher on Mt. Carmel--
above all, in the share its national elected representatives have assumed 
in providing the means for the convocation of the second Intercontinental 
Teaching Conference of the Holy Year; in commemorating 
worthily the dedication to public worship of the Mother Temple of the 
West, on the occasion of its Jubilee; in befittingly inaugurating the 
launching of the World Spiritual Crusade, and in celebrating the 
climax of the Holy Year marking the centenary of the birth of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's Mission--in all these the American &amp;Baha'i Community 
has fully deserved the praise and gratitude of posterity, has merited the 
applause of the Concourse on High and earned a full measure of the 
divine blessings and of the celestial sustenance of which it will stand in 
such great need in the course of the prosecution of still mightier and 
more glorious enterprises in the days to come.  
 
ADDED RESPONSIBILITIES IN PROPAGATING THE DIVINE PLAN
 
     The stage is now set, and the hour propitious, for a deployment of 
forces, and for the revelation of the indomitable spirit animating 
this community, on a scale and to a degree unprecedented in the entire 
course of American &amp;Baha'i history.  To the Antilles and the seventeen 
republics of Central and of South America--the scene of the initial 
 
+P113 
exploits of a community inaugurating the opening phase of its world-girding 
mission--to the ten sovereign states of Europe which, at a 
subsequent stage in the unfoldment of that mission, the members of 
this community enthusiastically and determinedly arose to open up and 
conquer; to the African territories which, in addition to their allocated 
task under the Second Seven Year Plan, they spontaneously endeavored 
to win to the all-conquering Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah--to these 
numerous islands and archipelagos, bordering the American, the European 
and African continents; dependencies extensive, well-nigh inaccessible, 
and remote from the base of their operations throughout the 
Asiatic continent; lastly, the South Pacific area, the home of the one 
remaining race not as yet adequately represented in the &amp;Baha'i world 
community, occupying spiritually so strategic a position owing to its 
proximity to the &amp;Baha'i communities already firmly entrenched in 
South America, in the Indian subcontinent and in Australasia, at once 
challenging the resources of no less than eight national spiritual assemblies, 
and the theater destined to witness the noblest and the most 
resounding victories which the chosen executors of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Divine 
Plan have been called upon to win in the service of the Cause 
of God--all these have now, in accordance with the requirements of 
an irresistibly unfolding Plan, been added, completing thereby the full 
circle of the world-wide obligations devolving upon a community invested 
with spiritual primacy by the Author of the immortal Tablets 
constituting the Charter of the Master Plan of the appointed Center 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant.  
     "The moment this Divine Message," He Who penned these 
Tablets and conferred this primacy has most significantly affirmed, "is 
propagated through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa and of 
Australasia, and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community will 
find itself securely established upon the throne of an everlasting 
dominion."  Then, and only then, will, as He Himself has so remarkably 
prophesied, "the whole earth" "resound with the praises of its majesty 
and greatness."  
     Now, indeed, is the time, after the lapse of two score years; 
following the triumphant conclusion of two successive historic Plans, 
marking the opening stages of the first epoch in the unfoldment of that 
same Master Plan; on the morrow of the brilliant celebrations climaxing 
the world-wide festivities of a memorable Holy Year; and while a 
 
+P114 
triumphant community, in the first flush of enthusiasm, has just 
garnered the first fruits of its campaigns in four continents of the globe 
and is laden with its freshly won trophies, for this community to bestir 
itself, and, assuming its rightful preponderating share in the conduct of 
a newly launched World Spiritual Crusade, to demonstrate, through a 
supreme and sustained effort embracing the entire surface of the 
planet, its ability to safeguard that primacy, to enrich immeasurably the 
record of its stewardship and to bring to a majestic conclusion the 
opening epoch in the evolution of a Plan destined to reveal the full 
measure of its potentialities, not only throughout the successive epochs 
of the Formative Age of the Faith, but in the course of the vast reaches 
of time stretching into the Golden, the last Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  
 
A LASTING INFLUENCE ON AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND NATION
 
     This decade-long global Crusade must mark a veritable turning 
point in American &amp;Baha'i history.  It must prove itself to be, as it 
develops, a force so pervasive and revolutionary in its character as to 
leave a lasting imprint not only on the destinies of the American &amp;Baha'i 
Community but on the fortunes of the American nation as well.  It 
must, even as a baptismal fire, so purge its members from self as to 
enable them to scale heights never as yet attained.  It must, in its initial 
stages, witness a dispersal, combined with a consecration, reminiscent 
of the dawn of the Heroic Age in &amp;Baha'u'llah's native land.  It must, as 
it gathers momentum, awaken the select and gather the spiritually 
hungry amongst the peoples of the world, as well as create an awareness 
of the Faith not only among the political leaders of present-day society 
but also among the thoughtful, the erudite in other spheres of human 
activity.  It must, as it approaches its climax, carry the torch of the Faith 
to regions so remote, so backward, so inhospitable that neither the light 
of Christianity or &amp;Islam has, after the revolution of centuries, as yet 
penetrated.  It must, as it approaches its conclusion, pave the way for the 
laying, on an unassailable foundation, of the structural basis of an 
Administrative Order whose fabric must, in the course of successive 
crusades, be laboriously erected throughout the entire globe and which 
must assemble beneath its sheltering shadow peoples of every race, 
tongue, creed, color and nation.  
     Seconded by the neighboring fully fledged Canadian &amp;Baha'i Community 
 
+P115 
flourishing beyond the northern frontier of its homeland; 
supported by the newly emerged Latin American communities established 
in the Antilles and in each of the central and southern republics 
of the Western Hemisphere; ably aided by its sister community 
vigorously functioning in the heart of a far-flung empire, and destined 
to lend its inestimable assistance in the spiritual conquest of the 
numerous and widely scattered dependencies of the British Crown; 
reinforced by the oldest and youngest national &amp;Baha'i communities on 
the European mainland which are to play a prominent part in the 
eastern and southern regions, and across the frontiers of Europe, along 
the shores and in the islands of the Mediterranean; assisted by its 
venerable sister community in the cradle of the Faith and by the second 
oldest national community in the &amp;Baha'i world actively engaged in the 
propagation of the Faith in the Asiatic continent; confident of the help 
of its Egyptian and Indian sister communities, whose destiny is closely 
linked with the African continent and southeast Asia respectively, and, 
lastly, assured of the unfailing cooperation of yet another national 
community in the Antipodes which, owing to its geographical position, 
is bound to assume a notable share in the introduction of the Faith in 
the islands of the South Pacific Ocean, the American &amp;Baha'i Community 
must, as befits its rank as the chief executor of the Divine Plan, 
play a dominant and decisive role in the direction and control of the 
manifold operations involved in the prosecution of the North American, 
the Latin American, the European, the African, the Asian and the 
South Pacific campaigns of this World Crusade, and insure, by every 
means at its disposal and in conjunction with its junior partners, its 
ultimate and total success.  
     Within its own sphere, extending to every continent of the globe, 
embracing no less than twenty-nine virgin territories and islands, the 
members of this stalwart and preeminent community are called upon, 
among other things and within the relatively brief span of a single 
decade, to create nuclei, around which will crystallize future assemblies, 
in no less than eleven territories and islands of Africa, eight of Asia, six 
of Europe, four of America; to inaugurate the establishment of the 
future dependencies of the Mother Temple of the West, and to 
terminate the landscaping of its grounds; to consolidate and broaden 
the basis of the Administrative Order already laid in twenty-three 
territories and islands distributed in four continents of the globe and 
 
+P116 
situated in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; to assist in the erection of 
no less than thirty-six pillars, twenty in Latin America, twelve in 
Europe, two in Asia, one in the North American continent and one in 
Africa, designed to help in sustaining the weight of the crowning unit 
of the &amp;Baha'i Administrative Order, and in the establishment of 
national &amp;Baha'i headquarters, of national endowments, and of national 
incorporations in all of these continents; to lend its aid for the 
acquisition of land in anticipation of the erection of four Temples, two 
in Europe, one in Africa and one in Central America; to lend an 
impetus to the progress of the Faith in its homeland through raising to 
three hundred the number of local spiritual assemblies and to one 
hundred the number of incorporated assemblies, as well as through the 
founding of a &amp;Baha'i Publishing Trust and the proclamation of the 
Faith through the press and radio; to enroll in the ranks of the followers 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah members of the Indian, of the Basque and Gypsy races; 
to assume responsibility for the translation and publication of &amp;Baha'i 
literature in twenty languages, ten in the Americas and ten in Europe; 
and to contribute to the consolidation of the Faith in eight of the 
European goal countries through the establishment of local incorporations, 
as well as through the quadrupling of the number of local 
assemblies and the trebling of the number of local &amp;Baha'i centers in 
each one of them.  
     While this colossal task, which in its magnitude and potentialities 
transcends any previous collective enterprise launched in the course of 
American &amp;Baha'i history, is being energetically carried out, it should be 
constantly borne in mind--and this applies to all communities without 
exception participating in this World Crusade--that the twofold task 
of extension and consolidation must be supplemented by continuous 
and strenuous efforts to increase speedily not only the number of the 
avowed followers of the Faith in both the virgin and opened territories 
and islands included within the scope of the Ten Year Plan, but also to 
swell the ranks of its active supporters who will consecrate their time, 
resources and energy to the effectual spread of its teachings and the 
multiplication and consolidation of its administrative institutions.  
     The movement of pioneers, the opening of virgin territories, the 
initiation of Houses of Worship and of administrative headquarters, 
the incorporation of local and national elective bodies, the multiplication 
of assemblies, groups and isolated centers, the increase in the 
 
+P117 
number of races represented in the world &amp;Baha'i fellowship, the 
translation, publication and dissemination of &amp;Baha'i literature, the 
consolidation of administrative agencies and the creation of auxiliary 
bodies designed to support them, however valuable, essential and 
meritorious, will in the long run amount to little and fail to achieve 
their supreme purpose if not supplemented by the equally vital 
task--which is one that primarily concerns continually and challenges 
each single individual believer whatever his rank, capacity or 
origin--of winning to the Faith fresh recruits to the slowly yet steadily 
advancing army of the Lord of Hosts, whose reinforcing strength is so 
essential to the safeguarding of the victories which the band of heroic 
&amp;Baha'i conquerors are winning in the course of their several campaigns 
in all the continents of the globe.  
     Such a steady flow of reinforcements is absolutely vital and is of 
extreme urgency, for nothing short of the vitalizing influx of new blood 
that will reanimate the world &amp;Baha'i community can safeguard the 
prizes which, at so great a sacrifice involving the expenditure of so much 
time, effort and treasure, are now being won in virgin territories by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's valiant Knights, whose privilege is to constitute the 
spearhead of the onrushing battalions which, in diverse theaters and in 
circumstances often adverse and extremely challenging, are vying with 
each other for the spiritual conquest of the unsurrendered territories 
and islands on the surface of the globe.  
     This flow, moreover, will presage and hasten the advent of the day 
which, as prophesied by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, will witness the entry by troops 
of peoples of divers nations and races into the &amp;Baha'i world--a day 
which, viewed in its proper perspective, will be the prelude to that 
long-awaited hour when a mass conversion on the part of these same nations 
and races, and as a direct result of a chain of events, momentous and 
possibly catastrophic in nature, and which cannot as yet be even dimly 
visualized, will suddenly revolutionize the fortunes of the Faith, derange 
the equilibrium of the world, and reinforce a thousandfold the 
numerical strength as well as the material power and the spiritual 
authority of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
 
MOST VITAL OBJECTIVE IN THE CRUSADE'S OPENING YEAR
 
     Of all the objectives enumerated in my message to the representatives 
of this community, assembled on the occasion of the celebration 
 
+P118 
of the climax of the Holy Year, of the convocation of the second 
Intercontinental Teaching Conference, of the inauguration of the 
Mother Temple of the West and of the launching of the World 
Spiritual Crusade, the most vital, urgent and meritorious, in this the 
opening year of the initial phase of this world-embracing enterprise, is, 
without doubt, the settlement of pioneers in all the virgin territories 
and islands assigned to this community in all the continents of the 
globe, with the exception of the few which, owing to present political 
obstacles, cannot as yet be opened to the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  This 
process already so auspiciously inaugurated, which, in the course of the 
first eight months of the Holy Year has gathered such splendid 
momentum, and which bids fair to astonish, stimulate and inspire the 
entire &amp;Baha'i world, must, during the concluding months of this same 
year and the one succeeding it, be so accelerated as to insure the 
attainment of this paramount objective before the lapse of two years 
from the official launching of this World Crusade.  
     While this goal is being vigorously pursued, close attention must be 
directed to the preliminary measures for the establishment of the first 
dependency of the Mother Temple of the West, as well as to the 
completion of the landscaping of its grounds, a double task that will, on 
the one hand, mark the termination of the fifty-year-old process of the 
construction of the central &amp;Baha'i House of Worship, and proclaim, on 
the other, the commencement of another designed to culminate in the 
establishment in its plenitude of the institution of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar 
as conceived by &amp;Baha'u'llah and envisaged by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha.  
Moreover, immediate consideration should be given to two other issues 
of prime importance, namely the purchase of land, which need not 
exceed for the present one acre, in anticipation of the construction of 
the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of South Africa, and the prompt translation 
of a suitable &amp;Baha'i pamphlet into the American and European languages 
allocated to your assembly, and its publication and wide dissemination 
among the peoples and tribes for whom it has been primarily 
designed.  
     The followers of the Most Great Name, citizens of the great 
republic of the West; constituting the majority and the oldest followers 
of His Faith in a continent wherein, in the words of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, "the 
splendors of His (&amp;Baha'u'llah's) Light shall be revealed" and "the 
mysteries of His Faith shall be unveiled," addressed by Him in His 
 
+P119 
Tablets of the Divine Plan as the "Apostles" of His Father; the 
recipients of the overwhelming majority of these same Tablets constituting 
the Charter of that Plan; conquerors of most of the territories, 
whether sovereign states or dependencies, already included within the 
pale of the Faith; the champion-builders of a world administrative 
system which posterity will regard as the harbinger of the World Order 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah, must, if they wish to retain their primacy and enrich 
their heritage, insure that, ere the opening of the second phase of this 
World Crusade, the names of the first American &amp;Baha'i conquerors to 
settle in virgin territories and islands will, as befits their primacy, be 
inscribed on the Scroll of Honor, now in process of preparation, and 
designed to be permanently deposited at the entrance door of the Inner 
Sanctuary of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Most Holy Tomb, that the limited area of 
land required for the erection of four future &amp;Baha'i Temples, in Rome, 
Stockholm, Panama City and Johannesburg, will be bought, that the 
landscaping of the grounds of the Temple in Wilmette will be 
completed, and that the translation and the publication of the aforementioned 
pamphlet in the specified languages will be accomplished.  
     The two years that lie ahead, three months of which have already 
elapsed, will swiftly and imperceptibly draw to a close.  Tasks even more 
onerous, equally weighty and requiring in a still greater measure the 
expenditure of effort and substance, lie ahead, which will brook no 
delay, which will carry the Faith to still higher levels of achievement 
and renown, which will enlarge, through the forging of fresh instruments, 
the framework of a steadily rising world Administrative Order, 
and which will eventually, if worthily discharged, seal the triumph of 
the most prodigious, the most sublime, the most sacred collective 
enterprise launched by the adherents of the Cause of God in both 
hemispheres since the early days of the Heroic Age of the Faith--an 
enterprise which in its vastness, organization and unifying power, has 
no parallel in the world's spiritual history.  
 
AN APPEAL TO ALL ENGAGED IN THE CRUSADE
 
     To them, and indeed to the entire body of the followers of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah, engaged in this global Crusade, I direct my appeal to arise 
and, in the course of these fast-fleeting years, in every phase of the 
campaigns that are to be fought in all the continents of the globe, prove 
+P120 
their worth as gallant warriors battling for the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
Indeed, from this very hour until the eve of the Most Great Jubilee, 
each and every one of those enrolled in the Army of Light must seek no 
rest, must take no thought of self, must sacrifice to the uttermost, must 
allow nothing whatsoever to deflect him or her from meeting the 
pressing, the manifold, the paramount needs of this preeminent Crusade.  
     "Light as the spirit," "pure as air," "blazing as fire," "unrestrained as 
the wind"--for such is &amp;Baha'u'llah's own admonition to His loved ones 
in His Tablets, and directed not to a select few but to the entire 
congregation of the faithful--let them scatter far and wide, proclaim 
the glory of God's Revelation in this Day, quicken the souls of men and 
ignite in their hearts the love of the One Who alone is their omnipotent 
and divinely appointed Redeemer.  
     Bracing the fearful cold of the Arctic regions and the enervating 
heat of the torrid zone; heedless of the hazards, the loneliness and the 
austerity of the deserts, the far-away islands and mountains wherein 
they will be called upon to dwell; undeterred by the clamor which the 
exponents of religious orthodoxy are sure to raise, or by the restrictive 
measures which political leaders may impose; undismayed by the 
smallness of their numbers and the multitude of their potential adversaries; 
armed with the efficacious weapons their own hands have slowly 
and laboriously forged in anticipation of this glorious and inevitable 
encounter with the organized forces of superstition, of corruption and of 
unbelief; placing their whole trust in the matchless potency of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's teachings, in the all-conquering power of His might and 
the infallibility of His glorious and oft-repeated promises, let them press 
forward, each according to his strength and resources, into the vast 
arena now lying before them, and which, God willing, will witness, in 
the years immediately lying ahead, such exhibitions of prowess and of 
heroic self-sacrifice as may well recall the superb feats achieved by that 
immortal band of God-intoxicated heroes who have so immeasurably 
enriched the annals of the Christian, the Islamic and &amp;Babi Dispensations.  
     On the members of the American &amp;Baha'i Community, the envied 
custodians of a Divine Plan, the principal builders and defenders of a 
mighty Order and the recognized champions of an unspeakably glorious 
and precious Faith, a peculiar and inescapable responsibility must 
 
+P121 
necessarily rest.  Through their courage, their self-abnegation, their 
fortitude and their perseverance; through the range and quality of their 
achievements, the depth of their consecration, their initiative and 
resourcefulness, their organizing ability, their readiness and capacity to 
lend their assistance to less privileged sister communities struggling 
against heavy odds; through their generous and sustained response to 
the enormous and ever-increasing financial needs of a world-encompassing, 
decade-long and admittedly strenuous enterprise, they 
must, beyond the shadow of a doubt, vindicate their right to the 
leadership of this World Crusade.  
     Now is the time for the hope voiced by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha that from their 
homeland "heavenly illumination" may "stream to all the peoples of the 
world" to be realized.  Now is the time for the truth of His remarkable 
assertion that that same homeland is "equipped and empowered to 
accomplish that which will adorn the pages of history, to become the 
envy of the world and be blest in both the East and the West," to be 
strikingly and unmistakably demonstrated.  "Should success crown" 
their "enterprise," He, moreover, has assured them, "the throne of the 
Kingdom of God will, in the plenitude of its majesty and glory, be 
firmly established."  
     Would to God that this community, boasting already of so superb a 
record of achievements both at home and overseas, and elevated to such 
dazzling heights by the hopes cherished and the assurance given by the 
Center of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant, may prove itself capable of performing 
deeds of such distinction, in the course of the opening, as well as 
the succeeding phases of this World Spiritual Crusade, as will outshine 
the dedicated acts which have already left their indelible mark on the 
Apostolic Age of the Faith in the West; will excel the enduring, the 
historic achievements associated, at a later period, with this community's 
memorable contribution to the rise and establishment of the world 
Administrative Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah; will surpass the magnificent 
accomplishments which, subsequently, as the result of the operation of 
the first Seven Year Plan, illuminated the annals of the Faith in both 
the North American continent and throughout Latin America and will 
eclipse the even more dramatic exploits which, during the opening 
years of the second epoch of the Formative Age of the Faith, and in the 
course of the prosecution of the Second Seven Year Plan, have exerted 
so lasting an influence on the fortunes of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the 
 
+P122 
Antilles, throughout the republics of Central America, in each of the 
ten republics of South America, in no less than ten sovereign states in 
the continent of Europe, and in various dependencies on the eastern 
and western shores, as well as in the heart of the African continent.

need not be maintained.)  
 
 
American &amp;Baha'is in the Time of World Peril
 
     The American &amp;Baha'i Community, in this, the opening year of the 
second phase of the World Spiritual Crusade upon which it has 
 
+P123 
embarked, finds itself standing on the threshold of the seventh decade 
of its existence.  It leaves behind it, as it enters the second decade of the 
second &amp;Baha'i century, sixty years crowded with events and marked by 
exploits so stirring and momentous that they stand unsurpassed in the 
annals of any other national &amp;Baha'i community with the sole exception 
of its venerable sister community in &amp;Baha'u'llah's native land.  
 
CHIEF EXECUTOR OF DIVINE PLAN
 
     The first to respond to the call of the New Day in the western 
world; for many years, in concert with the small band of Canadian 
believers residing in its immediate neighborhood, the sole champion of 
the newly proclaimed Covenant of &amp;Baha'u'llah; foremost in its decisive 
contribution to the creation of the pattern, the erection of the fabric, 
the enlargement of the limits, and the consolidation of the institutions 
of the embryonic World Order, the child of that same Covenant and 
the harbinger of a still unborn world civilization; singled out by the pen 
of the Center of that same Covenant for a unique and imperishable 
bounty as the principal custodian and chief executor of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's 
Divine Plan; doubly honored in the course of His extensive visit to the 
shores of its homeland through the distinction conferred by Him on the 
community's two leading centers, the one as the site where He laid the 
cornerstone of the holiest House of Worship in the &amp;Baha'i world, and 
the other the scene of the proclamation of His Father's Covenant; the 
triumphant prosecutor of two successive historic Plans, boldly initiated 
by its elected national representatives for the propagation of the Faith it 
has espoused in the land of its birth, in the Dominion of Canada, in 
Central and South America and in the continent of Europe and for the 
erection of its own House of Worship, the Mother Temple of the West; 
outstanding in its role as the defender of the Faith, as the supporter of 
its down-trodden, long-persecuted sister communities in both the Asiatic 
and African continents, and as the formulator of the national 
&amp;Baha'i constitution, embodying the by-laws regulating the internal 
affairs of the members of the &amp;Baha'i communities; incomparable 
throughout the &amp;Baha'i world as the dynamic agent responsible for the 
opening of the vast majority of the over two hundred sovereign states 
and chief dependencies of the globe to the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah; 
surpassing even its over a hundred-year old sister community in the 
cradle of that Faith in the number and variety of isolated centers, 
 
+P124 
groups and local assemblies it has succeeded in establishing over the 
face of the Union stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific seaboards 
and from Alaska to Mexico; noteworthy in the rapid accumulation and 
wise expenditure of material resources, often involving a self-abnegation 
reminiscent of the self-sacrifice of the dawn-breakers of the 
Apostolic Age of the Faith, for the sole purpose of systematically 
propagating the Faith it has pledged itself to serve, of enhancing its 
prestige, of multiplying and perfecting its administrative agencies, of 
enriching its literature, of erecting its edifices, of launching its manifold 
enterprises, of succoring the needy among the members of its sister 
communities, of warding off the dangers confronting it from time to 
time through the malice of its enemies--the American &amp;Baha'i Community, 
boasting of such a record of exalted service, can well afford to 
contemplate the immediate future, with its severe challenge, its complex 
problems, its hazards, tests and trials, with equanimity and confidence.  
     For there can be no doubt that the entire community, limited as is 
its numerical strength and circumscribed as are its meager resources, in 
comparison with the vastness of the field stretching before it, the 
prodigious efforts demanded of it, and the complexity of the problems it 
must resolve, stands at a most critical juncture in its history.  
 
AMERICA PASSING THROUGH CRISIS
 
     Moreover, the country of which it forms a part is passing through a 
crisis which, in its spiritual, moral, social and political aspects, is of 
extreme seriousness--a seriousness which to a superficial observer is 
liable to be dangerously underestimated.  
     The steady and alarming deterioration in the standard of morality 
as exemplified by the appalling increase of crime, by political corruption 
in ever widening and ever higher circles, by the loosening of the 
sacred ties of marriage, by the inordinate craving for pleasure and 
diversion, and by the marked and progressive slackening of parental 
control, is no doubt the most arresting and distressing aspect of the 
decline that has set in, and can be clearly perceived, in the fortunes of 
the entire nation.  
     Parallel with this, and pervading all departments of life--an evil 
which the nation, and indeed all those within the capitalist system, 
though to a lesser degree, share with that state and its satellites regarded 
 
+P125 
as the sworn enemies of that system--is the crass materialism, which 
lays excessive and ever-increasing emphasis on material well-being, 
forgetful of those things of the spirit on which alone a sure and stable 
foundation can be laid for human society.  It is this same cancerous 
materialism, born originally in Europe, carried to excess in the North 
American continent, contaminating the Asiatic peoples and nations, 
spreading its ominous tentacles to the borders of Africa, and now 
invading its very heart, which &amp;Baha'u'llah in unequivocal and emphatic 
language denounced in His Writings, comparing it to a devouring 
flame and regarding it as the chief factor in precipitating the dire 
ordeals and world-shaking crises that must necessarily involve the 
burning of cities and the spread of terror and consternation in the 
hearts of men.  Indeed a foretaste of the devastation which this consuming 
fire will wreak upon the world, and with which it will lay waste the 
cities of the nations participating in this tragic world-engulfing contest, 
has been afforded by the last World War, marking the second stage in 
the global havoc which humanity, forgetful of its God and heedless of 
the clear warnings uttered by His appointed Messenger for this day, 
must, alas, inevitably experience.  It is this same all-pervasive, pernicious 
materialism against which the voice of the Center of &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
Covenant was raised, with pathetic persistence, from platform and 
pulpit, in His addresses to the heedless multitudes, which, on the 
morrow of His fateful visit to both Europe and America, found 
themselves suddenly swept into the vortex of a tempest which in its 
range and severity was unsurpassed in the world's history.  
     Collateral with this ominous laxity in morals, and this progressive 
stress laid on man's material pursuits and well-being, is the darkening 
of the political horizon, as witnessed by the widening of the gulf 
separating the protagonists of two antagonistic schools of thought 
which, however divergent in their ideologies, are to be commonly 
condemned by the upholders of the standard of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
for their materialistic philosophies and their neglect of those spiritual 
values and eternal verities on which alone a stable and flourishing 
civilization can be ultimately established.  The multiplication, the diversity 
and the increasing destructive power of armaments to which both 
sides, in this world contest, caught in a whirlpool of fear, suspicion and 
hatred, are rapidly contributing; the outbreak of two successive bloody 
conflicts, entangling still further the American nation in the affairs of 
 
+P126 
a distracted world, entailing a considerable loss in blood and treasure, 
swelling the national budget and progressively depreciating the currency 
of the state; the confusion, the vacillation, the suspicions besetting 
the European and Asiatic nations in their attitude to the American 
nation; the overwhelming accretion of strength to the arch enemy of 
the system championed by the American Union in consequence of the 
re-alignment of the powers in the Asiatic continent and particularly in 
the Far East--these have, moreover, contributed their share, in recent 
years, to the deterioration of a situation which, if not remedied, is 
bound to involve the American nation in a catastrophe of undreamed-of 
dimensions and of untold consequences to the social structure, the 
standard and conception of the American people and government.  
     No less serious is the stress and strain imposed on the fabric of 
American society through the fundamental and persistent neglect, by 
the governed and governors alike, of the supreme, the inescapable and 
urgent duty--so repeatedly and graphically represented and stressed by 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha in His arraignment of the basic weaknesses in the social 
fabric of the nation--of remedying, while there is yet time, through a 
revolutionary change in the concept and attitude of the average white 
American toward his Negro fellow citizen, a situation which, if allowed 
to drift, will, in the words of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, cause the streets of American 
cities to run with blood, aggravating thereby the havoc which the 
fearful weapons of destruction, raining from the air, and amassed by 
a ruthless, a vigilant, a powerful and inveterate enemy, will wreak 
upon those same cities.  
     The American nation, of which the community of the Most Great 
Name forms as yet a negligible and infinitesimal part, stands, indeed, 
from whichever angle one observes its immediate fortunes, in grave 
peril.  The woes and tribulations which threaten it are partly avoidable, 
but mostly inevitable and God-sent, for by reason of them a government 
and people clinging tenaciously to the obsolescent doctrine of absolute 
sovereignty and upholding a political system, manifestly at variance 
with the needs of a world already contracted into a neighborhood and 
crying out for unity, will find itself purged of its anachronistic conceptions, 
and prepared to play a preponderating role, as foretold by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, 
in the hoisting of the standard of the Lesser Peace, in the 
unification of mankind, and in the establishment of a world federal 
government on this planet.  These same fiery tribulations will not only 
 
+P127 
firmly weld the American nation to its sister nations in both hemispheres, 
but will through their cleansing effect, purge it thoroughly of 
the accumulated dross which ingrained racial prejudice, rampant 
materialism, widespread ungodliness and moral laxity have combined, 
in the course of successive generations, to produce, and which have 
prevented her thus far from assuming the role of world spiritual 
leadership forecast by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's unerring pen--a role which she is 
bound to fulfill through travail and sorrow.  
 
AMERICAN &amp;BAHA'IS STAND AT CROSSROADS
 
     The American &amp;Baha'i Community, the leaven destined to leaven 
the whole, cannot hope, at this critical juncture in the fortunes of a 
struggling, perilously situated, spiritually moribund nation, to either 
escape the trials with which this nation is confronted, nor claim to be 
wholly immune from the evils that stain its character.  
     At so critical a period, at so challenging an hour, the members of a 
community, invested by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha with a primacy which can, 
through neglect and apathy, be allowed to lose its vital power and 
driving force, are immersed in a task, and are faced with responsibilities, 
which a World Spiritual Crusade, the third and greatest 
collective enterprise embarked upon in American &amp;Baha'i history, has 
thrust upon them before the eyes of their admiring and expectant sister 
communities throughout the world.  They now stand at the crossroads, 
unable to relax for a moment, or hesitate as to which road they should 
tread, or to allow any decline in the high standard they have, for no less 
than six decades, undeviatingly upheld.  Nay, if this primacy is to be 
safeguarded and enhanced, a consecration, not only on the part of a 
chosen few, to every single objective of the Ten-Year Plan to which 
they are now pledged, and a pouring out of substance, not only by those 
of limited means, but by the richest and wealthiest, in a degree 
involving the truest sacrifice, for the purpose of insuring the attainment 
of the aims and purposes of the Plan in its present phase of development, 
are imperative and can brook no delay.  
     The mighty and laudable effort exerted, by a considerable number 
of pioneers, in the course of the opening phase of this world-encircling 
Crusade, in the virgin territories of the globe, must, if this primacy is to 
remain unimpaired, be increased, doubled, nay trebled, and must 
manifest itself not only in foreign fields where the prizes so laboriously 
 
+P128 
won during the last twelve months must, at whatever sacrifice, be 
meticulously preserved, but throughout the entire length and breadth 
of the American Union, and particularly in the goal cities, where 
hitherto the work has stagnated, and which must, in the year now 
entered, become the scene of the finest exploits which the home front 
has yet seen.  A veritable exodus from the large cities where a considerable 
number of believers have, over a period of years, congregated, both 
on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as in the heart of the country, 
and where, owing to the tempo and the distractions of city life, the 
progress of the Faith has been retarded, must signalize the inauguration 
of this most intensive and challenging phase of the Crusade on the 
home front.  Most certainly and emphatically must the lead be given by 
the two focal centers of &amp;Baha'i activity which rank among the oldest of 
and occupy the most honored position among, the cities throughout the 
American Union, the one as the mother city of the North American 
continent, the other named by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha the City of the Covenant.  
Indeed, so grave are the exigencies of the present hour, and so critical 
the political position of the country, that were a bare fifteen adult 
&amp;Baha'is to be left in each of these cities, over which unsuspected 
dangers are hanging, it would still be regarded as adequate for the 
maintenance of their local spiritual assemblies.  
 
WORLD CRUSADE TASKS
 
     While this vital process of multiplication of &amp;Baha'i isolated centers, 
groups and local assemblies is being accelerated, through a rapid and 
unprecedented dispersion of believers, and as the result of the initiation 
of vigorous teaching activities, through individuals as well as administrative 
agencies, the incorporation of full-fledged local assemblies--a 
process which has been noticeably slackening in recent years--must be 
given immediate attention by the community's elected national representatives, 
reinforcing, thereby, the foundations of local &amp;Baha'i communities, 
and paving the way for the establishment, in a not too distant 
future, of local &amp;Baha'i endowments.  
     The inauguration of the first dependency of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, 
the first link to be forged destined to bind the Community of 
the Most Great Name to the general public, expectant to witness the 
first evidences of direct &amp;Baha'i service to humanity as a complement to 
&amp;Baha'i worship, is yet another task which must be conscientiously 
 
+P129 
tackled and fulfilled in the course of the second phase of this Ten-Year 
Plan.  The consummation of this project must synchronize with the 
termination of the landscaping of the area surrounding the Temple--a 
double achievement that will mark yet another stage in the materialization 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's often expressed and cherished hopes for this 
holiest House of Worship in the &amp;Baha'i world.  
     Yet another task, of extreme urgency and of great spiritual 
significance, is the selection and purchase of the site of the future 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in Sweden, as well as the appropriation of sufficient 
funds during the coming two years, for the establishment, on however 
modest a scale, of a national &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds in Anchorage, Alaska, in 
Panama City and in the capital of Peru, in Suva, in Tokyo and in 
Johannesburg, and the lending of financial assistance to the Italo-Swiss 
National Assembly, the proud daughter of the American &amp;Baha'i Community, 
for the erection of a similar national center in the Italian and 
Swiss capitals.  
     Of no less importance, though involving a smaller outlay of funds, 
is the establishment of token national endowments in the aforementioned 
cities, in anticipation of the formation of an independent 
national spiritual assembly in each of them, at a later stage in the 
execution of this stupendous Plan.  
     The translation and publication of &amp;Baha'i literature in the European 
and American Indian languages, allocated to your Assembly and 
its European Teaching Committee under the provisions of the Ten-Year 
Plan, is yet another objective of this second phase of this World 
Crusade, a task that must be resolutely pursued and speedily consummated 
in order to facilitate the intensive teaching activity which, at a 
later stage, must be conducted for the purpose of converting a considerable 
number of the minority races in both Europe and America to the 
Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     The all-important teaching enterprises in France and Finland, 
designed to broaden the basis of the infant Administrative Order in 
both countries, and extend the ramifications of the Faith to their chief 
towns and cities, is yet another responsibility which should be promptly 
discharged, as an indispensable preliminary to the establishment in 
each of these two countries of an independent national assembly.  
     Finally, the establishment of a &amp;Baha'i Publishing Trust, similar in 
its essentials to the institution already functioning in the British Isles, 
 
+P130 
and which must serve as a model for other national assemblies in both 
the East and the West, is a matter to which prompt and earnest 
attention must be directed in the course of the second phase of the 
Plan, and which will require full and speedy consultation with the 
national elected representatives of the British &amp;Baha'i Community.  
     A systematic campaign designed to proclaim the Faith to the masses 
through the press and radio must moreover be launched and maintained 
with vigilance, persistence and vigor.  
     The American &amp;Baha'i Community--the champion-builders of an 
Order which posterity will hail as the harbinger of a civilization to be 
regarded as the fairest fruit of the Revelation proclaimed by 
&amp;Baha'u'llah; the principal trustees of a Plan which future generations 
will acclaim as one of the two greatest legacies left by the Center of His 
Covenant; marching in the van of a Crusade which history will 
recognize as the most momentous spiritual enterprise launched in 
modern times; beset by the same anxieties and perils by which the 
nation of which it forms a part finds itself, to an unprecedented degree, 
afflicted and surrounded--such a community is, at this hour, experiencing 
the impact of a challenge unique in its sixty years of existence.  
 
CHALLENGE TO EACH INDIVIDUAL &amp;BAHA'I
 
     In its meteoric career its fortunes have risen so swiftly, its exploits 
have so greatly multiplied, its spirit in times of emergency has swelled 
and risen so high, it has earned on such occasions the applause and 
excited the admiration of its sister communities throughout both 
hemispheres to such a degree, that it cannot, at this critical hour in its 
destinies, suffer this golden opportunity to slip from its grasp, or this 
priceless privilege to be irretrievably forfeited.  
     This challenge, so severe and insistent, and yet so glorious, faces no 
doubt primarily the individual believer on whom, in the last resort, 
depends the fate of the entire community.  He it is who constitutes the 
warp and woof on which the quality and pattern of the whole fabric 
must depend.  He it is who acts as one of the countless links in the 
mighty chain that now girdles the globe.  He it is who serves as one of 
the multitude of bricks which support the structure and insure the 
stability of the administrative edifice now being raised in every part of 
the world.  Without his support, at once whole-hearted, continuous and 
 
+P131 
generous, every measure adopted, and every plan formulated, by the 
body which acts as the national representative of the community to 
which he belongs, is foredoomed to failure.  The World Center of the 
Faith itself is paralyzed if such a support on the part of the rank and file 
of the community is denied it.  The Author of the Divine Plan Himself 
is impeded in His purpose if the proper instruments for the execution 
of His design are lacking.  The sustaining strength of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
Himself, the Founder of the Faith, will be withheld from every and 
each individual who fails in the long run to arise and play his part.  
     The administrative agencies of a divinely conceived Administrative 
Order at long last erected and relatively perfected stand in dire need of 
the individual believer to come forward and utilize them with undeviating 
purpose, serene confidence and exemplary dedication.  The heart of 
the Guardian cannot but leap with joy, and his mind derive fresh 
inspiration, at every evidence testifying to the response of the individual 
to his allotted task.  The unseen legions, standing rank upon rank, 
and eager to pour forth from the Kingdom on high the full measure of 
their celestial strength on the individual participants of this incomparably 
glorious Crusade, are powerless unless and until each potential 
crusader decides for himself, and perseveres in his determination, to 
rush into the arena of service ready to sacrifice his all for the Cause he is 
called upon to champion.  
 
APPEAL FOR DEDICATION
 
     It is therefore imperative for the individual American believer, and 
particularly for the affluent, the independent, the comfort-loving and 
those obsessed by material pursuits, to step forward, and dedicate their 
resources, their time, their very lives to a Cause of such transcendence 
that no human eye can even dimly perceive its glory.  Let them resolve, 
instantly and unhesitatingly, to place, each according to his circumstances, 
his share on the altar of &amp;Baha'i sacrifice, lest, on a sudden, 
unforeseen calamities rob them of a considerable portion of the earthly 
things they have amassed.  
     Now if ever is the time to tread the path which the dawn-breakers 
of a previous age have so magnificently trodden.  Now is the time to 
carry out, in the spirit and in the letter, the fervent wish so pathetically 
voiced by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, Who longed, as attested in the Tablets of the 
 
+P132 
Divine Plan, to "travel though on foot and in the utmost poverty" and 
raise "in cities, villages, mountains, deserts and oceans" "the call of 
&amp;Ya-Baha'u'l-Abha!"  
     Then, and only then, can the members of this community hasten 
the advent of the day when, as prophesied by His pen, "heavenly 
illumination" will "stream" from their country "to all the peoples of the 
world."  Then, and only then will they find themselves "securely 
established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion."  
     That the members of this community, of either sex and of every 
age, of whatever race or background, however limited in experience, 
capacity and knowledge, may arise as one man, and seize with both 
hands the God-given opportunities now presented to them through the 
dispensations of an all-loving, ever-watchful, ever-sustaining Providence, 
and lend thereby a tremendous impetus to the propelling forces 
mysteriously guiding the operations of this newly launched, unspeakably 
potent, world-encompassing Crusade, is one of the dearest wishes 
which a loving and longing heart holds for them at this great turning 
point in the fortunes of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the American 
continent.

     Owing to aggravation of the situation, the hacking to pieces of the 
bodies of seven believers in the vicinity of Yazd, and the likelihood of 
worse massacre in the approaching months, advise all groups and 
assemblies in the United States to address telegraphically President 
Eisenhower, appealing for his intervention for protection from further 
 
+P133 
massacres of our offenseless, law-abiding co-religionists in &amp;Iran and the 
safeguard of their human rights.  Include brief reference to the worst 
atrocities.  National Assembly should address him similar message both 
in writing and telegraphically.  Include list of atrocities in accompanying 
memorandum...

A Mysterious Dispensation of Providence
 
PERSECUTION OF THE &amp;BAHA'IS OF &amp;IRAN 
 
     A crisis in the fortunes of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, of exceptional 
severity, extensive in its ramifications, unpredictable in its immediate 
consequences, directly involving the overwhelming majority of His 
followers in the land of His birth, and confronting with a major 
challenge &amp;Baha'i communities in both hemispheres, has plunged the 
&amp;Baha'i world, whilst engaged in the prosecution of a world-wide 
spiritual crusade, into intense sorrow and profound anxiety.  
     More grievous than any of the intermittent crises which have more 
or less acutely afflicted the Faith since the inception, over thirty years 
ago, of the Formative Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation, such as a seizure 
of the keys of the foremost Shrine of the &amp;Baha'i world by the 
covenant-breakers residing in the Holy Land; the occupation of the House of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah by His traditional enemies in &amp;Baghdad; the expropriation 
of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the &amp;Baha'i world in &amp;Turkistan and the 
virtual extinction of the &amp;Ishqabad &amp;Baha'i Community; the disabilities 
suffered by the Egyptian &amp;Baha'i Community as a result of the verdict of 
the Egyptian ecclesiastical court and the historic pronouncements of 
the highest dignitaries of &amp;Sunni &amp;Islam in Egypt; the defection of the 
members of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's family and the machinations and eventual 
deviation of various recognized yet highly ambitious leaders, teachers, as 
well as administrators, in Persia, Egypt, Germany and the United 
States--more grievous than any of these, this latest manifestation of the 
implacable hatred, and relentless opposition, of the as yet firmly 
entrenched, politically influential avowed adversaries of God's infant 
Faith, threatens to become more uncontrollable with every passing day.  
     Indeed in many of its aspects this crisis bears a striking resemblance 
to the wave of persecutions which periodically swept the cradle of the 
 
+P134 
Faith in the course of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's ministry, and is tragically reminiscent 
of the tribulations experienced by the dawn-breakers of the 
Heroic Age of the Faith at the hour of its birth in that sorely tried, 
long-agitated land.  
     With dramatic suddenness, a situation, which had been slowly and 
secretly developing, came to a head, as the result of the ceaseless 
intrigue of the fanatical and determined ecclesiastical opponents of the 
Faith, ever ready to seize their chance, in times of confusion, and to 
strike mercilessly, at an opportune hour, at the very root of that Faith 
and of its swiftly developing, steadily consolidating administrative 
institutions.  
     The launching of the Crusade itself, with the celebrations and 
ceremonials which accompanied it; the repercussions of the widely 
reported proceedings of four successive Intercontinental Teaching 
Conferences, which heralded its inauguration; the public dedication of 
the Mother Temple of the West in Wilmette; the systematic intensification 
of teaching activities in the Arabian Peninsula, enshrining 
the Qiblih of the entire Islamic world; and, in particular, the opening to 
the Faith of the twin holy cities of Mecca and Medina--all these may 
be said to have precipitated this crisis, and alarmed the jealous exponents 
and guardians of an antiquated religious orthodoxy in the 
strongholds of both &amp;Shi'ah and &amp;Sunni &amp;Islam.  
 
A PREMEDITATED CAMPAIGN OF PERSECUTION
 
     This premeditated campaign was heralded by violent and repeated 
public denunciations of the Faith over the air, from the pulpit, and 
through the press, defaming its holy Founders, distorting its distinctive 
features, ridiculing its aims and purposes, and perverting its history.  It 
was formally launched by the government's official pronouncement in 
the Majlis outlawing the Faith and banning its activities throughout 
the land.  It was soon followed by the senseless and uncivilized demolition 
of the imposing dome of the &amp;Baha'i Central Administrative 
Headquarters in the capital.  It assumed serious proportions through the 
seizure and occupation of all &amp;Baha'i administrative headquarters 
throughout the provinces.  
     This drastic action taken by the representatives of the central 
authorities in cities, towns and villages was the signal for the loosing of 
 
+P135 
a flood of abuse, accompanied by a series of atrocities simultaneously 
and shamelessly perpetrated in most of the provinces, bringing in its 
wake desolation to &amp;Baha'i homes, economic ruin to &amp;Baha'i families, and 
staining still further the records of &amp;Shi'ah &amp;Islam in that troubled land.  
     In &amp;Shiraz, in the province of &amp;Fars, the cradle of the Faith, the House 
of the &amp;Bab, ordained by &amp;Baha'u'llah in His Most Holy Book as the 
foremost place of pilgrimage in the land of His birth, was twice 
desecrated, its walls severely damaged, its windows broken and its 
furniture partly destroyed and carried away.  The neighboring house of 
the &amp;Bab's maternal uncle was razed to the ground.  &amp;Baha'u'llah's ancestral 
home in &amp;Takur, in the province of &amp;Mazindaran, the scene of 
&amp;Abdu'l-Baha's early childhood, was occupied.  Shops and farms, constituting, 
in most cases, the sole source of livelihood to peaceful &amp;Baha'i 
families, were plundered.  Crops and livestock, assets patiently acquired 
by often poor, but always peace-loving, law-abiding farmers, were 
wantonly destroyed.  Bodies in various cemeteries were first disinterred 
and then viciously mutilated.  The homes of rich and poor alike were 
forcibly entered and ruthlessly looted.  Both adults and children were 
publicly set upon, reviled, beaten and ridiculed.  Young women were 
abducted, and compelled, against their parents' wishes and their own, 
to marry Muslims.  Boys and girls were mobbed at school, mocked and 
expelled.  A boycott, in many cases, was imposed by butchers and 
bakers, who refused to sell to the adherents of the Faith the barest 
necessities of life.  A girl in her teens was shamelessly raped, whilst an 
eleven-month-old baby was heartlessly trampled underfoot.  Pressure 
was brought to bear upon the believers to recant their faith and to 
renounce allegiance to the Cause they had espoused.  
     Nor was this all.  Emboldened by the general applause accorded by 
the populace to the savage perpetrators of these crimes, a mob of many 
hundreds marched upon the hamlet of Hurmuzak, to the beating of 
drums and the sounding of trumpets, and, armed with spades and 
axes, fell upon a family of seven, the oldest eighty, the youngest nineteen, 
and, in an orgy of unrestrained fanaticism, literally hacked them 
to pieces.  
     Following closely upon this heinous crime, the like of which has 
not been witnessed since the close of the Heroic Age of the Faith, an 
official order has been issued by the Prime Minister's office in &amp;Tihran, 
 
+P136 
placing an interdiction against the employment of any &amp;Baha'is in 
government service, and ordering the instant dismissal of all who insist 
on adhering to their faith.  
 
APPEALS TO THE AUTHORITIES OF &amp;IRAN AND TO THE UNITED NATIONS
 
     These tragic, swiftly succeeding events have stirred the &amp;Baha'i 
world to its foundations.  Counter measures were immediately taken, 
and more than a thousand appeals were addressed by national and local 
assemblies as well as groups in all continents of the globe to the highest 
authorities in Persia, including the &amp;Shah, in the hope of stemming the 
tide of persecution threatening to engulf the entire Persian &amp;Baha'i 
Community.  Furthermore, a wide-spread campaign of publicity was 
initiated in expectation that its repercussions would exert a restraining 
influence on the perpetrators of these monstrous acts.  An appeal was 
moreover lodged with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, 
and the President of the Social and Economic Council, copies of which 
were delivered to the representatives of the member nations of the 
Council, to the Director of the Human Rights Division, as well as to 
non-governmental organizations with consultative status.  More recently, 
President Eisenhower, who, as reported in the press, was the 
first to make mention of the attacks launched against the Faith, was 
appealed to by the American National Spiritual Assembly as well as by 
all groups and local assemblies throughout the United States, to 
intervene on behalf of the victims of these persecutions.  
 
A WHOLLY DEDICATED, INFLEXIBLE RESOLVE
 
     Faced with this organized and vicious onslaught on the followers, 
the fundamental verities, the shrines and administrative institutions of 
the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the land of His birth, the American &amp;Baha'i 
Community cannot at this hour relax for a moment in the discharge of 
the multiple and sacred responsibilities it has pledged itself to fulfill 
under the Ten-Year Plan and must indeed display a still greater degree 
of consecration and a nobler spirit of self-sacrifice in the pursuit of the 
goals it has set itself to achieve.  
     A wider dispersal throughout the length and breadth of its homeland; 
a more strenuous effort to consolidate the superb achievements in 
the newly opened virgin territories in various continents and islands of 
the globe; a still greater exertion to expedite the translation and 
 
+P137 
publication of &amp;Baha'i literature into the European and American 
Indian languages assigned to it under the Plan; a more determined 
thrust towards the vital objectives of acquiring the site of the future 
Mother Temple of Sweden and of purchasing the remaining national 
&amp;Haziratu'l-Quds in the goal countries of Europe, as well as in Central 
and South America; a concerted endeavor to establish national &amp;Baha'i 
endowments in these European and Latin American countries; a 
ceaseless concentration of attention on the incorporation of firmly 
established local spiritual assemblies throughout the United States and 
in the goal countries of Europe, and a closer collaboration with the 
administrative agencies functioning in Europe, Latin America, Africa, 
Japan and Alaska for the forthcoming formation of the European, 
Latin American, Southwest African, Japanese and Alaskan national 
spiritual assemblies; a more intensive campaign to win over to the Faith 
representatives of American Indian tribes and of the Basque and Gypsy 
races--above all, a concerted, wholly dedicated, inflexible resolve to 
win the allegiance of a far greater number of adherents to the Faith it 
has espoused and to insure a spectacular multiplication of groups, 
isolated centers and local assemblies in the vast area assigned to its 
care--through these, more than through anything else, can the American 
&amp;Baha'i Community--the recognized champion of the persecuted 
and the down-trodden, and the standard-bearer of the embryonic 
World Order of &amp;Baha'u'llah--offset, to a marked degree, the severe 
losses the Faith has sustained in the land of its birth, and bring an 
abiding and much needed consolation to the countless hearts that 
bleed, in this hour of test and trial, throughout the length and breadth 
of that bitterly troubled land.  
 
"SAVE THE PERSECUTED FUND" 
 
     Not only through its superlative achievements in these diversified 
and vital spheres of &amp;Baha'i activity, but also through the support given 
by its members to the "Save the Persecuted Fund" recently established 
for the succor of the orphaned, the widowed and the dispossessed, and 
to which the entire &amp;Baha'i world has been invited to contribute, can this 
stout-hearted, vigilant, self-sacrificing community which on similar past 
occasions has so nobly discharged its responsibilities, proclaim to an 
unbelieving and skeptical world, and particularly to its redoubtable, 
implacable adversaries, the unconquerable spirit which animates it, the 
 
+P138 
inflexible resolve which spurs it on, in the hour of trial, in the service of 
a Faith to which it stands wholly dedicated.  
 
THE FIRST HOUSE OF WORSHIP IN AFRICA 
 
     Over and above such meritorious accomplishments, the members of 
this community are called upon to demonstrate their solidarity with 
their sister communities in East and West, and indeed to assert their 
divinely conferred primacy, through assuming a leading role in providing 
for the erection of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar to be raised in the 
heart of the African continent--a continent which by virtue of the 
innumerable exploits which, throughout its length and breadth, colored 
and white, individuals as well as assemblies, have achieved in 
recent years, and which, with the sole exception of Australasia, is the 
only continent deprived of the blessings of such an institution, fully 
deserves to possess its own independent House of Worship--a House 
that will gather within its walls members of communities whose 
prowess has, in the opening years of the second epoch of the Formative 
Age of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation, eclipsed the feats performed in both 
the southern part of the Western Hemisphere and the European 
continent, and conferred such luster on the annals of our Faith.  
     Africa, long dormant and neglected, and now stirring in its potential 
spiritual strength, is, at this very hour, under the eyes of the 
clamorous multitudes of the adversaries of the Faith pressing for its 
extirpation in the land of its birth, being called upon to redress the 
scales so weighed down through the ferocious and ignoble acts of 
bloodthirsty ecclesiastical oppressors.  The erection of such an institution, 
at such a time, through the combined efforts of the undismayed, 
undeflected and undefeatable upholders of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah in 
both the East and the West, posterity will regard as a worthy answer to 
the challenge flung down by its bitterest, most powerful and inveterate 
enemies.  Let them give heed to the warnings and admonitions uttered, 
at an hour of similar danger, by the Founder of the Faith Himself, on 
the morrow of His third banishment, and addressed in clear and 
unmistakable language to the "Minister of the &amp;Shah" in Constantinople:  
"Dost thou believe thou hast the power to frustrate His will, to 
hinder Him from executing His judgment, or to deter Him from 
exercising His sovereignty?  Pretendest thou that aught in the heavens 
or in the earth can resist His Faith?  No, by Him Who is the eternal 
 
+P139 
Truth!  Nothing whatsoever in the whole of creation can thwart His 
purpose....  Know thou, moreover, that He it is Who hath by His 
own behest, created all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth.  
How can, then, the thing that hath been created at His bidding prevail 
against Him?"  
 
A BLESSING IN DISGUISE 
 
     Indeed this fresh ordeal that has, in pursuance of the mysterious 
dispensations of Providence, afflicted the Faith, at this unexpected 
hour, far from dealing a fatal blow to its institutions or existence, 
should be regarded as a blessing in disguise, not a "calamity" but a 
"providence" of God, not a devastating flood but a "gentle rain" on a 
"green pasture," a "wick" and "oil" unto the "lamp" of His Faith, a 
"nurture" for His Cause, "water for that which has been planted in the 
hearts of men," a "crown set on the head" of His Messenger for this 
Day.  
     Whatever its outcome, this sudden commotion that has seized the 
&amp;Baha'i world, that has revived the hopes and emboldened the host of 
the adversaries of the Faith intent on quenching its light and obliterating 
it from the face of the earth, has served as a trumpet call in the 
sounding of which the press of the world, the cries of its vociferous 
enemies, the public remonstrances of both men of good will and those 
in authority have joined, proclaiming far and wide its existence, 
publicizing its history, defending its verities, unveiling its truths, 
demonstrating the character of its institutions and advertising its aims 
and purposes.  
 
UNPRECEDENTED PUBLICITY
 
     Seldom, if at any time since its inception, has such a widespread 
publicity been accorded the infant Faith of God, now at long last 
emerging from an obscurity which has so long and so grievously 
oppressed it.  Not even the dramatic execution of its Herald, nor the 
blood-bath which, in circumstances of fiendish cruelty followed quickly 
in its wake in the city of &amp;Tihran, nor even the widely advertised travels 
of the Center of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant in the West, succeeded in 
focusing the attention of the world and in inviting the notice of those in 
high places as has this latest manifestation of God's inscrutable will, 
this marvelous demonstration of His invincible power, this latest move 
+P140 
in His Own Major Plan, using both the mighty and lowly as pawns in 
His world-shaping game, for the fulfillment of His immediate purpose 
and the eventual establishment of His Kingdom on earth.  
     For though the newly launched World Spiritual Crusade, constituting 
at best only the Minor Plan in the execution of the Almighty's 
design for the redemption of mankind--has, as a result of this turmoil, 
paralyzing temporarily the vast majority of the organized followers of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah within His birthplace, suffered a severe setback--yet the 
over-all Plan of God, moving mysteriously and in contrast to the orderly 
and well-known processes of a clearly devised Plan, has received an 
impetus the force of which only posterity can adequately assess.  
     A Faith, which, for a quarter of a century, has, in strict accordance 
with the provisions of the Will and Testament of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, been 
building its Administrative Order--the embryonic World Order of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah--through the laborious erection of its local and national 
administrative institutions; which set out, in the opening years of the 
second epoch of this Formative Age, through the launching of a series 
of national Plans as well as a World Crusade, to utilize the machinery 
of its institutions, created patiently and unobtrusively in the course of 
the first epoch of that Age, for the systematic propagation of its 
teachings in all the continents and chief islands of the globe--such a 
Faith finds itself, whilst in the midst of discharging its second and vital 
task, thrust into the limelight of an unprecedented publicity--a publicity 
which its followers never anticipated, which will involve them in 
fresh and inescapable responsibilities, and which will, no doubt, 
reinforce the tasks which they have undertaken, in recent years, to 
discharge.  
     To the intensification of such a publicity in which &amp;non-Baha'i 
agencies and even the avowed adversaries of the Faith are playing 
so active a part, the members of the American &amp;Baha'i Community, 
the outstanding defenders of the Faith, blessed with a freedom 
so cruelly denied the vast majority of their brethren, and equipped 
with the means and instruments needed to make that publicity 
effective, must fully and decisively contribute.  The echoes of the 
mighty trumpet blast, now so providentially sounded, awakening a 
multitude of the ignorant and the skeptical, both high and low, to the 
existence and significance of the Message of &amp;Baha'u'llah, must under 
no circumstances, and at such a propitious hour, be allowed to die out.  
 
+P141 
Nay, their reverberations must be followed up by further calls designed 
to proclaim, in still more resounding tones, the aims and tenets of this 
glorious Cause, and to expose, whilst avoiding any attack on the ruling 
authorities, even more convincingly than before, the barbarous ferocity 
of the acts which have been perpetrated, as well as the odious fanaticism 
which has inspired such conduct.  
     Strenuous and urgent as is the task falling to the lot of a community 
already so over-burdened with a multiplicity of unavoidable obligations, 
the possibilities involved in the assumption of this supplementary 
responsibility are truly tremendous, the benefits that are destined to 
accrue from its proper discharge are immense, and the reward inestimably 
rich.  
     Let them remember, as they pursue diligently this sacred task, that 
such a publicity, following closely upon such dire tribulations, afflicting 
so large a number of their brethren, in so sacred a land, cannot but 
prove to be a prelude, however slow the process involved, to the 
emancipation of these same valiant sufferers from the galling fetters of 
an antiquated religious orthodoxy, which, great as has been its decline 
in the course of over a century, still wields considerable power and 
exercises a widespread influence in high circles as well as among the 
masses.  Such an emancipation, which cannot be confined to 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's native land, will, in varying measure, have its repercussions 
in Islamic countries, or may be even preceded by a similar 
phenomenon in neighboring territories, hastening and adding fresh 
impetus to the bursting of the bonds that fetter the freedom of the 
followers of God's infant Faith.  
 
WORLD RECOGNITION OF THE FAITH
 
     Such a consummation will, in its turn, pave the way for the 
recognition of that Faith as an independent religion established on a 
basis of absolute equality with its sister religions, enjoying the unqualified 
protection of the civil authorities for its followers and its 
institutions, and fully empowered, in all matters related to personal 
status, to apply without any reservations the laws and ordinances 
ordained in the Most Holy Book.  
     That the members of the American &amp;Baha'i Community--the outstanding 
protagonists of the Cause of God; the stout-hearted defenders 
of its integrity, its claims and its rights, the champion-builders of its 
 
+P142 
Administrative Order; the standard-bearers of its crusading hosts; the 
torchbearers of its embryonic civilization; the chief succorers of the 
down-trodden, the needy and the fettered among its followers--that 
the members of such a community, may, whilst discharging, fully and 
unflinchingly, their specific tasks in accordance with the provisions of 
the Ten-Year Plan, seize the present God-sent opportunity, and hasten, 
through a proper discharge of this supplementary task, the consummation 
of such ardent hopes for so signal a victory, is a prayer constantly 
in my heart, and a wish which I treasure above all others.

+P143 
Inestimable Prizes Within Our Reach
 
     As I survey, after the lapse of a little over three years, the vast range 
of historic and unforgettable achievements with which the stout-hearted, 
high-minded and wholly consecrated followers of the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah have, in the course of the operations of a World Spiritual 
Crusade, enriched, in every continent of the globe and in so many 
islands of the seven seas, the annals of the Formative Age of His 
Dispensation, I cannot but acknowledge, with feelings of pride, of joy, 
and of gratitude, the preponderating share which the American &amp;Baha'i 
Community, faithful to its traditions, and in keeping with its high 
standard of stewardship to the Cause of God, has had in the conduct of 
this world-encircling enterprise and the discharge of its manifold, its 
pressing and sacred responsibilities.  With one or two exceptions, 
greatly to be deplored, this valiant community has, ever since the 
inception of this Spiritual Crusade, and in every sphere of &amp;Baha'i 
activities in which its participators have both individually and collectively 
been assiduously engaged, set an example of whole-hearted 
dedication, dogged perseverance, unstinting self-sacrifice and undeviating 
loyalty worthy of emulation by its sister, as well as its daughter, 
communities over the entire face of the globe.  
     The number, the character and the rapidity of the spiritual conquests 
achieved by its steadfast and intrepid members, in so many sovereign 
states of the globe, its chief dependencies and widely scattered islands, 
in the course of the one-year period, constituting the opening phase of a 
memorable Plan, will no doubt be universally acclaimed as a turning 
point of unimaginable consequence in &amp;Baha'i history.  Such feats, in so 
many territories, during so short a time, will rank, in the eyes of 
posterity, as superb and outstanding exploits, immortalizing the fame of 
the American followers of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, and as epoch-making 
events unsurpassed since the closing of the Heroic Age of the 
&amp;Baha'i Dispensation.  
 
AID ACCORDED TO THEIR OPPRESSED BRETHREN IN PERSIA
 
     The reaction, so swift and so energetic, of the members of this same 
community, now deservedly recognized as the impregnable citadel of 
the Faith of God, and the cradle of the rising institutions of its World 
 
+P144 
Order, to the sudden onslaught made upon the institutions, the lives 
and the livelihood of their oppressed brethren, members of the numerically 
leading and the most venerable national &amp;Baha'i community, by the 
traditional adversaries of a long-persecuted Faith, has been such as to 
deepen, to a marked extent, the feelings of genuine admiration and esteem, 
so strongly felt throughout the &amp;Baha'i world, for the enduring and 
magnificent services rendered in the course of more than six decades 
by the American believers to the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah and its embryonic 
World Order.  The spontaneity with which the rank and file of this 
community as well as the body of its elected representatives, have 
contributed to the "Save the Persecuted Fund" established for the 
succor of the victims of these savage and periodically recurring barbarities; 
the measure of publicity accorded them in the American press, as 
well as over the radio; the timely and efficacious intervention of men of 
prominence, in various walks of life, on behalf of the oppressed and the 
down-trodden; the repeated and direct appeals addressed by them to the 
highest authorities in Persia, as well as to their representative in the
United States; the immense number of written and cabled appeals, 
made by the local as well as the national elected representatives of the 
community, to the chief magistrate of Persia, his ministers and parliament; 
the numerous messages addressed by the same representatives to 
the chief executive of the United States, urging his personal intervention, 
the pleading of the cause of an harassed, sorely-tried community 
in the course of repeated representations made to the State Department 
in Washington; the part played in the presentation of the &amp;Baha'i case to 
the United Nations officials in both Geneva and New York; the 
allocation of a sizeable sum for the purpose of securing the assistance of 
an expert publicity agent, in order to reinforce the publicity already 
being received in the public press--these, as well as other measures 
which, by their very nature, must of necessity remain confidential--
proclaim, in no uncertain terms, the dynamic and decisive nature 
of the aid accorded, in a hour of trial and emergency, by the champions 
of the Faith of &amp;Baha'u'llah, raised up in the great republic 
of the West, at such a crucial hour in the evolution of His Plan, 
for both His Faith and the world at large, to the vast body of the 
descendants of the dawn-breakers of the Apostolic Age of that same 
Faith in the land of its birth.  
 
+P145 
A NOBLE RECORD OF SERVICE
 
     No less remarkable has been the share of this community, chiefly 
responsible, on the morrow of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's passing, for the fixing of 
the pattern, the elaboration of the national constitution, and the 
erection of the basic institutions, of a divinely conceived Administrative 
Order, in the acquisition and establishment, in the course of two brief 
years, constituting the second phase of the Ten-Year Plan, of practically 
all of the future national administrative headquarters--numbering 
over thirty--of &amp;Baha'i national assemblies in four continents of the 
globe, involving the expenditure from the National Fund of over a 
hundred thousand dollars.  
     An effort, hardly less meritorious and equally efficacious and 
astonishing, has been exerted by the members of this alert, forward-looking, 
ceaselessly laboring community, in the course of the same two-year 
period, for the establishment of national &amp;Baha'i endowments in 
more than twenty countries of both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, 
entailing the expenditure of over twenty thousand dollars.  
     In other spheres of &amp;Baha'i activity, related to the prosecution of the 
Ten-Year Plan, all of vital importance to the teaching work initiated 
under that same Plan, and to the enlargement and consolidation of the 
administrative structure of the institutions to be erected in the future, 
the accomplishments of the members of this community, during the 
first two phases of this world Crusade, have been no less significant.  
The establishment of the &amp;Baha'i Publishing Trust; the translation of 
&amp;Baha'i literature into more than fifteen languages, both within the 
scope of the Ten-Year Plan and outside it, spoken in Europe, Asia, 
Latin America and the North American continent; the purchase of the 
site of the first dependency of the Mother Temple of the West; the 
practical completion of the landscaping of its gardens; the provision of a 
considerable part of the material resources required for the purchase of 
the sites of future &amp;Baha'i Temples in both the Eastern and Western 
Hemispheres, as well as for the construction of the two projected 
&amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkars in the European and African continents; the 
guidance given and the aid extended to newly elected national assemblies, 
for the efficient conduct of &amp;Baha'i administrative activities and the 
prosecution of &amp;Baha'i national plans; the initial visits made by &amp;Baha'i 
 
+P146 
teachers to countries within the Soviet orbit, foreshadowing the launching 
of systematic teaching enterprises in both Europe and Asia; the 
assistance given, through financial help as well as through the dispatch 
of &amp;Baha'i pioneers, to various &amp;Baha'i communities for the enlargement 
of the limits of the Faith and the consolidation of its institutions; and, 
last but not least, the purchase of the sacred site of the &amp;Siyah-Chal of 
&amp;Tihran, the scene of the birth of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Prophetic Mission, by a 
member of that community of Persian descent--these stand out as further 
evidences of the enormous share the firmly knit, highly organized, 
swiftly advancing, fully dedicated American &amp;Baha'i Community 
has had in the prosecution and triumphant progress of the three year 
old Ten-Year Plan, and augur well for a no less splendid contribution to 
be made, in the years immediately ahead, for the attainment of its 
remaining objectives.  
 
FRUITFUL EFFORTS OF HANDS OF THE CAUSE
 
     Supplementing this noble record of service have been the constant 
and fruitful efforts exerted by the Hands of the Cause, nominated from 
among the members of that community, in both the United States and 
the Holy Land, efforts that have lent a considerable impetus to the 
expansion and consolidation of the far-reaching enterprises initiated at 
the World Center of the Faith, and which have, particularly through 
the instrumentality of the recently appointed American Auxiliary 
Board, stimulated, to a noticeable extent the progress of the teaching 
work and the advancement of the Plan itself.  
 
STUPENDOUS WORK ACHIEVED BY MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
&amp;BAHA'I COUNCIL 
 
     Particular tribute should, I feel, at this juncture, be paid to the 
stupendous work achieved, since the launching of the World Crusade, 
by the representatives of this highly privileged community, in their 
capacity as members of the International &amp;Baha'i Council, in connection 
with the prosecution of a variety of enterprises embarked upon in 
recent years, aiming at the expansion and consolidation of the international 
institutions of the Faith, the enhancement of its prestige, the 
embellishment of the surroundings of its Shrines, the efficient conduct 
 
+P147 
of its internal affairs, and the forging of fresh links binding it still more 
closely to the civil authorities in the Holy Land.  The erection of the 
International Archives in the close neighborhood of the &amp;Bab's holy 
Sepulcher; the extension of the international &amp;Baha'i endowments on 
the slopes of Mt. Carmel; the formation of several Israel Branches of 
&amp;Baha'i National Spiritual Assemblies; the embellishment of the precincts 
of the resting-place of both the &amp;Bab and &amp;Baha'u'llah; the 
purchase of the site of the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the Holy Land; 
the preparation of the designs for the International &amp;Baha'i Archives on 
Mt. Carmel; and of the Mother Temples of Persia and of Africa; the 
inauguration of the preliminary steps for the eventual construction of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah's holy Sepulcher; the measures adopted, with the assistance 
of various officials of the State of Israel, for the eviction of the 
covenant-breakers from the immediate precincts of the Shrine of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah and the elimination of any influence they still exercise, 
after the lapse of over sixty years, in the close vicinity of that Most Holy 
Spot--in these, as well as in other various subsidiary activities, constantly 
increasing in number as well as in diversity at the spiritual and 
administrative center of the &amp;Baha'i world, have the members of the 
little band, assiduously laboring under the shadow of the Holy Shrines, 
and befittingly representing the American &amp;Baha'i Community, conspicuously 
participated, and through their dedicated services, added fresh 
luster to the annals of the community to which they belong.  
REVITALIZATION OF THE HOME FRONT
     So splendid a record of service, rendered within the brief span of a 
little over three years, extending over so vast an area of the globe, so 
highly diversified, so pregnant with promise, in the face of such 
formidable obstacles, and by so limited a number of participants, has, 
much to my deepest regret, been marred by a progressive devitalization 
of the home front, constituting so momentous an aspect of the Ten-Year 
Plan, and upon which its continued and effective prosecution by 
the American &amp;Baha'i Community, in the course of the present and third 
phase of the World Spiritual Crusade, so largely depends.  
     Constituting as it does the base of the multiple operations now 
being conducted to ensure the success of the North American, the 
Latin American, the African, the European and Asiatic campaigns of a 
global crusade, no sacrifice can be deemed too great for its revitalization 
 
+P148 
and the broadening and consolidation of its foundations.  The manpower 
of the community, so essential to the further deployment of its 
forces must, rapidly and at all costs, increase.  The material resources, 
now at its disposal, which are so bountifully poured forth and so 
generously distributed to the four corners of the globe, must be 
correspondingly augmented to meet the pressing and ever-swelling 
demands of a constantly and irresistibly advancing Crusade.  A far 
greater proportion of the avowed supporters of the Faith must arise, ere 
the Crusade suffers any setback, for the fourfold purpose of winning 
over an infinitely greater number of recruits to the army of &amp;Baha'u'llah 
fighting on the home front, of swelling to an unprecedented degree the 
isolated centers now scattered within its confines, of converting an 
increasing number of them into firmly founded groups, and of accelerating 
the formation of local assemblies, while safeguarding those already 
in existence.  
 
THE INDIVIDUAL &amp;BAHA'I MUST ARISE
 
     There can be no doubt whatever that to achieve this fourfold 
purpose is the most strenuous, the least spectacular, and the most 
challenging of the tasks now confronting the American &amp;Baha'i Community.  
It is primarily a task that concerns the individual believer, 
wherever he may be, and whatever his calling, his resources, his race, or 
his age.  Neither the local nor national representatives of the community, 
no matter how elaborate their plans, or persistent their appeals, or 
sagacious their counsels, nor even the Guardian himself, however 
much he may yearn for this consummation, can decide where the duty 
of the individual lies, or supplant him in the discharge of that task.  The 
individual alone must assess its character, consult his conscience, 
prayerfully consider all its aspects, manfully struggle against the natural 
inertia that weighs him down in his effort to arise, shed, heroically 
and irrevocably, the trivial and superfluous attachments which hold 
him back, empty himself of every thought that may tend to obstruct his 
path, mix, in obedience to the counsels of the Author of His Faith, and 
in imitation of the One Who is its true Exemplar, with men and 
women, in all walks of life, seek to touch their hearts, through the 
distinction which characterizes his thoughts, his words and his acts, and 
win them over tactfully, lovingly, prayerfully and persistently, to the 
Faith he himself has espoused.  
 
+P149 
     The gross materialism that engulfs the entire nation at the present 
hour; the attachment to worldly things that enshrouds the souls of men; 
the fears and anxieties that distract their minds; the pleasure and 
dissipations that fill their time, the prejudices and animosities that 
darken their outlook, the apathy and lethargy that paralyze their 
spiritual faculties--these are among the formidable obstacles that stand 
in the path of every would-be warrior in the service of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
obstacles which he must battle against and surmount in his crusade for 
the redemption of his own countrymen.  
     To the degree that the home front crusader is himself cleansed of 
these impurities, liberated from these petty preoccupations and gnawing 
anxieties, delivered from these prejudices and antagonisms, emptied 
of self, and filled by the healing and the sustaining power of 
God, will he be able to combat the forces arrayed against him, magnetize 
the souls of those whom he seeks to convert, and win their unreserved, 
their enthusiastic and enduring allegiance to the Faith of 
&amp;Baha'u'llah.  
     Delicate and strenuous though the task may be, however arduous 
and prolonged the effort required, whatsoever the nature of the perils 
and pitfalls that beset the path of whoever arises to revive the fortunes 
of a Faith struggling against the rising forces of materialism, nationalism, 
secularism, racialism, ecclesiasticism, the all-conquering potency 
of the grace of God, vouchsafed through the Revelation of &amp;Baha'u'llah, 
will, undoubtedly, mysteriously and surprisingly, enable whosoever 
arises to champion His Cause to win complete and total victory.  
     The history of a century-old Faith eloquently bears witness to 
similar unnumbered successes won, in both the Apostolic and Formative 
Ages of the &amp;Baha'i Dispensation, in circumstances even more 
challenging than those in which the American &amp;Baha'i Community now 
finds itself.  
     So magnificent a victory, won collectively, at such a time, in a 
country so vitally affecting the immediate destinies of mankind, 
singled out to play so predominant a role in the unification and 
spiritualization of the entire human race, by a community which in 
every other field can boast a brilliant and unbroken record of victories, 
will, no doubt, exert not only a profound influence on the ultimate 
destinies of an entire nation and people, but will galvanize, through its 
repercussions, the entire &amp;Baha'i world.  
 
+P150 
"A PRAYER WHICH I NEVER CEASE TO UTTER"
 
     The prizes within the reach of this community are truly inestimable.  
Much will depend on the reaction of the rank and file of the 
believers to the plea now addressed to them with all the fervor of my 
soul.  
     To act, and act promptly and decisively, is the need of the present 
hour and their inescapable duty.  That the American &amp;Baha'i Community 
may, in this one remaining field, where so much is at stake, and 
where the needs of the Faith are so acute, cover itself with a glory that 
will outshine the splendor of its past exploits in the far-flung territories 
of the globe, is a prayer which I never cease to utter in my continual 
supplications to &amp;Baha'u'llah.  
 
[July 19, 1956] 
 
 
Intensification of Efforts
 
     Welcome pledge by delegates.  Fervently supplicating &amp;Baha'u'llah's 
sustaining grace.  Urge intensification of efforts, rededication and 
achievement of goals of Plan in order to discharge befittingly the 
sacred, manifold, inescapable, urgent responsibilities confronting the 
entire American &amp;Baha'i Community.  Appeal for unprecedented increase 
in pioneers on the home front and all continents of the globe, on 
which the prosperity, security and destiny of the American believers 
must ultimately rest.  
 
[April 29, 1957] 
 
 
Dual, Inescapable, Paramount Responsibilities
 
     Assembly's dual, inescapable, paramount responsibilities for current 
year are to ensure expansion and consolidation of the home front and 
the rapid multiplication of pioneers abroad to reinforce Latin American, 
African, European and Pacific campaigns of World Crusade.  
Fervently supplicating for signal success in fulfillment of dearest hopes.  
 
[May 7, 1957] 
 
+P151 
Heights Never Before Attained
 
     The American &amp;Baha'i Community has, ever since the launching of 
the global Spiritual Crusade, in which it has been assigned the lion's 
share in view of the primacy conferred upon it by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, exerted 
itself, in numerous and widely scattered areas of the globe, with 
commendable perseverance, a high sense of undeviating loyalty and 
exemplary consecration.  The inexorable march of events, hastening its 
members along the path of their destiny, is steadily carrying them to the 
stage at which the momentous Plan, to which they have dedicated their 
resources, will have reached its midway point.  
 
ENDURING ACHIEVEMENTS 
 
     A prodigious expenditure of effort, a stupendous flow of material 
resources, an unprecedented dispersal of pioneers, embracing so vast a 
section of the globe, and bringing in their wake the rise, the multiplication 
and consolidation of so many institutions, so divers in character, so 
potent and full of promise, already stand to their credit, and augur well 
for a befitting consummation of a decade-long task in the years 
immediately ahead.  
     The opening of a large percentage of the virgin territories, scattered 
over the face of the planet, and assigned, under the provisions of the 
Ten-Year Plan, to this community and its sister and daughter communities 
in all continents of the globe; the allocation of vast sums, for the 
founding of national &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds, for the establishment of national 
&amp;Baha'i endowments; and for the purchase of the sites of future &amp;Baha'i 
Temples; the financial aid extended and the moral support accorded to 
a still persecuted sister community, struggling heroically for its 
emancipation, in the cradle of the Faith; the steady progress in the vital 
process of incorporating firmly grounded local spiritual assemblies in 
various states of the union; the translation of &amp;Baha'i literature into the 
languages listed in the Ten-Year Plan, as well as into a number of 
supplementary languages, spontaneously undertaken by American 
&amp;Baha'i pioneers in territories far beyond the confines of their homeland; 
the completion of the landscaping of the area immediately surrounding 
the Mother Temple of the West, in conformity with the expressed, 
often repeated wishes of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, contributing so greatly to the 
 
+P152 
beauty of an edifice, the spiritual influence of which He, repeatedly 
and unequivocally, emphasized; the acquisition of the site of the first 
dependency of that same edifice, designed to pave the way for the early 
establishment of the first of several institutions, which, as conceived by 
Him, will be grouped around every &amp;Baha'i House of Worship, complementing, 
through their association with direct service to mankind, in 
the educational, the humanitarian and social fields, its spiritual function 
as the ordained place of communion with the Creator and the 
Spirit of His appointed Messenger in this day; the establishment of the 
&amp;Baha'i Publishing Trust; the generous financial assistance extended, 
the administrative guidance vouchsafed and the unfailing encouragement 
given, by the elected representatives of this same community 
to the newly fledged assemblies, emerging into independent existence 
in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres; the substantial share 
which one of its members has had in the acquisition of one of the holy 
sites in the capital city of &amp;Baha'u'llah's native land; the preponderating 
role played by the various agencies, acting under the direction of its 
national elected representatives, in giving publicity to the Faith, 
through the proclamation of the fundamental verities underlying the 
&amp;Baha'i Revelation, the airing of the manifold grievances weighing so 
heavily on the overwhelming majority of their coreligionists, and the 
appeals directed, on their behalf, to men of eminence in various walks 
of life, as well as to different departments of the United Nations, both 
in New York and Geneva; and, finally, ranking as equally meritorious 
to anything hitherto achieved by the members of this privileged 
community, the magnificent and imperishable contribution made by 
them, singly and collectively, to the rise and establishment of the 
institutions of their beloved Faith at its World Center; through the 
assistance given by their distinguished representatives serving in the 
Holy Land, in hastening the erection of the &amp;Baha'i International 
Archives, through the purchase of the site of the Mother Temple of the 
Holy Land, the enlargement of the scope of &amp;Baha'i international 
endowments on the slopes of Mt. Carmel and in the Plain of &amp;Akka, the 
embellishment of the sacred precincts of the two holiest Shrines of the 
&amp;Baha'i world; the formation of the Israel Branches of four national 
spiritual assemblies, the preparation and completion of the designs of 
the first &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkars to be erected in the Asiatic, the African 
and Australian continents, and the setting in motion, through the 
 
+P153 
instrumentality of various departments of the Israeli government, of a 
long-drawn-out process, culminating in the expropriation by the state 
of the entire property, owned and controlled by the remnants of the 
breakers of &amp;Baha'u'llah's Covenant, immediately surrounding His 
resting-place and the Mansion of &amp;Bahji, the evacuation of this property 
by this ignoble band, and the final and definite purification, after the 
lapse of no less than six decades, of the Outer Sanctuary of the Most 
Holy Shrine of the &amp;Baha'i world, of the defilement, which had caused 
so much sorrow and anxiety to the heart of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha--these are 
among the enduring achievements which four brief years of unremitting 
devotion to the interests of the Ten-Year Plan have brought about, 
and which will eternally redound to the glory of the champion-builders 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah's embryonic World Order, holding aloft so valiantly the 
banner of His Faith in the great republic of the West.  
 
THE HOME FRONT--BASE FOR EXPANSION OF FUTURE OPERATIONS
 
     Though much has been achieved in the space of less than five years, 
though the objectives of the Ten-Year Plan, in most of its essential 
aspects, may be said to have been triumphantly attained long before the 
time appointed for its termination, through a striking display, and a 
remarkable combination, of American &amp;Baha'i initiative, resourcefulness, 
generosity, fidelity and perseverance, the Plan, prosecuted hitherto 
so vigorously by the rank and file of this community, may be said to 
be still suffering in some of its vital aspects, from certain deficiencies, 
which, if not speedily and fundamentally remedied, will not only 
mutilate the Plan itself, but jeopardize the prizes won so laboriously 
since its inauguration.  
     As I have already forewarned the energetic prosecutors of the global 
Crusade in the North American continent, the home front, from which 
have sprung, since the inception of the Formative Age of the Faith, the 
dynamic forces which have set in motion, and directed the operation, of 
so many processes, in both the teaching and administrative spheres of 
&amp;Baha'i activity, and which must continue to act as a base for the steady 
expansion of future operations in every continent of the globe, and the 
extension of their ramifications to the uttermost corners of the earth, 
and which must be increasingly regarded, as the forces of internal 
disruption and the stress and danger of aggressiveness from without 
gather momentum, as the sole stronghold of a Faith which cannot hope 
 
+P154 
to escape unscathed from the turmoil gathering around it--such a 
home front must, at all costs, and in the shortest possible time, be 
spiritually reinvigorated, administratively expanded, and materially 
replenished.  The flame of devotion ignited and the enthusiasm generated, 
during the celebrations which commemorated the centenary of 
the birth of the Mission of the Divine Author of our Faith, and which, 
in the course of the years immediately following it have carried the 
members of the American &amp;Baha'i Community, so far and so high, along 
the road leading to their ultimate destiny, must, in whatever way 
possible, be fanned and continually fed throughout the entire area of 
the Union, in every state from the Atlantic to the Pacific seaboards, in 
every locality where &amp;Baha'is reside, in every heart throbbing with the 
love of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  The spirit that sent forth, not so long ago, in such 
rapid succession, so many pioneers to such remote areas of the globe, 
must at all costs and above everything else, be recaptured, for the twofold 
purpose of swelling the number, and of ensuring the continual 
flow, of pioneers, so essential for the safeguarding of the prizes won in 
the course of the several campaigns of a world-girdling Crusade, and of 
combatting the evil forces which a relentless and all-pervasive materialism, 
the cancerous growth of militant racialism, political corruption, 
unbridled capitalism, wide-spread lawlessness and gross immorality, 
are, alas, unleashing, with ominous swiftness, amongst various classes 
of the society to which the members of this community belong.  
     The administrative strongholds of a Faith, bound to be subjected on 
the one hand, to a severe spiritual challenge from within, through the 
inevitable impact of these devastating influences on its infant strength, 
and, on the other, to the onslaught of ecclesiastical leaders, the 
traditional defenders of religious orthodoxy from without, must be 
multiplied and reinforced for the purpose of warding off the inevitable 
attacks of the assailants, of vindicating the ideals and principles which 
animate their defenders, and of ensuring the ultimate victory and 
ascendency of the Faith itself over the nefarious elements seeking to 
undermine it from within, and its powerful detractors aiming at its 
extinction from without.  
     Nor must the material resources, so vitally required to meet the 
challenge of a continually expanding Faith, be, for a moment, either 
ignored, neglected, or underestimated--resources which a home front, 
materially and adequately replenished by a steady and marked influx of 
 
+P155 
active and wholehearted supporters from all ranks of society, can, in the 
long run, provide.  As the imperative needs of a Faith, now irresistibly 
advancing in every direction, multiply, a corresponding increase in the 
financial means at the disposal of its national administrators directing 
and controlling its operations, within and beyond the confines of their 
homeland, to meet these essential and urgent requirements, must be 
ensured, if its onward march is not to be either halted or slowed down.  
 
MIGHTY AND HISTORIC ENTERPRISES
 
     It is upon the individual believer, constituting the fundamental 
unit in the structure of the home front, that the revitalization, the 
expansion, and the enrichment of the home front must ultimately 
depend.  The more strenuous the effort exerted, daily and methodically, 
by the individual laboring on the home front to rise to loftier heights of 
consecration, of self-abnegation, to contribute, through pioneering at 
home, to the multiplication of &amp;Baha'i isolated centers, groups and 
assemblies, and to raise, through diligent, painstaking and continual 
endeavor to convert receptive souls to the Faith he has espoused, the 
number of its active and wholehearted supporters, the sooner will the 
vast and multiple enterprises, launched beyond the confines of the 
homeland, and now so desperately calling for a greater supply of men 
and means, be provided with the necessary support that will ensure 
their uninterrupted development and hasten their ultimate fruition, 
and the lighter will be the burden of the impending contest that must 
be waged, sooner or later, within the borders of the Union itself, 
between the rising institutions of &amp;Baha'u'llah's embryonic divinely 
appointed Order, and the exponents of obsolescent doctrines and the 
defenders, both secular and religious, of a corrupt and fast-declining 
society.  
     The fourth phase of the Ten-Year Plan, which the prosecutors of a 
world-encompassing Crusade are about to enter, must witness on the 
one hand, on every home front, and particularly within the confines of 
the American homeland, this same spiritual reinvigoration, administrative 
expansion, and material replenishment, constituting the triple 
facets of a task which can brook no further delay, and, on the other, an 
acceleration, particularly in connection with the construction of the 
Mother Temples of Australia and Germany (the needs of the Mother 
Temple of Africa having, to all intents and purposes, been met) in the 
 
+P156 
contributions to be made, by individual believers as well as national 
spiritual assemblies, to ensure the uninterrupted progress and the early 
completion of these mighty and historic enterprises.  
     As the members of the valiant American &amp;Baha'i Community have, 
in the space of more than four years, blazed the trail, and vindicated 
their primacy, through the share they have had in opening the chief 
remaining virgin territories of the globe, in contributing to the furtherance 
of the interests of the institutions of the Faith at its World Center, 
and in hastening the acquisition of national &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds, the 
establishment of &amp;Baha'i national endowments, and the purchase of sites for 
future &amp;Baha'i Temples, so must they, if they be intent on safeguarding 
that primacy, and on preserving, intact and untarnished, the noble 
example they have already set the &amp;Baha'i world, maintain their enviable 
position, as the vanguard of the army of &amp;Baha'u'llah's crusaders, in 
rescuing, while there is yet time, their home front from the precarious 
position in which it now finds itself, and in displaying for the purpose 
of ensuring the erection of the Mother Temples of three 
continents--tasks which tower far above any of the national enterprises 
hitherto undertaken--be they &amp;Haziratu'l-Quds, endowments or Temple 
sites--that selfsame generosity and self-abnegation which have 
distinguished their stewardship to the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah in the past.  
     The year, the opening of which will mark the midway point of this 
World Spiritual Crusade, must be distinguished from all previous 
years, by the special allotment of a substantial sum from the national 
budget that will adequately meet the urgent needs of these Houses of 
Worship, and particularly those that are to be erected in the European 
and Australian continents.  
 
A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY, A GLORIOUS CHALLENGE
 
     The forthcoming convocation of no less than five intercontinental 
conferences, marking the passing of half of the time allotted for the 
prosecution of a World Crusade, and to be held, in five continents of 
the globe, for the purpose of paying homage to the Author of the &amp;Baha'i 
Revelation for His protection, guidance and blessings, of focusing 
attention on the achievements of the immediate past and the pressing 
requirements of the immediate future, will, it is my ardent hope and 
prayer, provide a fresh stimulus for the adequate discharge of these two 
afore-mentioned responsibilities, which constitute the distinguishing 
features of the fourth phase of a rapidly unfolding Plan.  
 
+P157 
     At four of these five conferences, in the proceedings of which four, 
the members of the American &amp;Baha'i Community--the principal executors 
of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan and the keepers and defenders of 
the stronghold of the &amp;Baha'i Administrative Order--will participate, 
through their official representatives, the voice of the champion-builders 
of &amp;Baha'u'llah's embryonic World Order, who can well claim to 
have had a decisive share in the great strides made by this Crusade, 
should be raised in a spirit and manner that will galvanize these 
conferences into action, and produce such results as will reverberate 
round the world.  
     A golden opportunity, a glorious challenge, an inescapable duty, a 
staggering responsibility, confront them, at this fresh turning point in 
the fortunes of a Crusade, for which they have so unremittingly 
labored, whose Cause they have so notably advanced, in the further 
unfoldment of which they must continue to play a leading part, and in 
whose closing stages, they will, I feel confident, rise to heights never 
before attained in the course of six decades of American &amp;Baha'i history.  
     Once again--and this time more fervently than ever before--I direct 
my plea to every single member of this strenuously laboring, clear-visioned, 
stout-hearted, spiritually endowed community, every man 
and woman, on whose individual efforts, resolution, self-sacrifice and 
perseverance the immediate destinies of the Faith of God, now traversing 
so crucial a stage in its rise and establishment, primarily depends, 
not to allow, through apathy, timidity or complacency, this one remaining 
opportunity to be irretrievably lost.  I would rather entreat each and 
every one of them to immortalize this approaching, fateful hour in the 
evolution of a World Spiritual Crusade, by a fresh consecration to their 
God-given mission, coupled with an instantaneous plan of action, at 
once so dynamic and decisive, as to wipe out, on the one hand, with 
one stroke, the deficiencies which have, to no small extent, bogged 
down the operations of the Crusade on the home front, and tremendously 
accelerate, on the other, the progress of the triple task, launched, 
in three continents, and constituting one of its preeminent objectives.  
 
HIS WATCHFUL POWER AND UNFAILING GRACE
 
     May He, Who through the irresistible operation of the will of His 
almighty Father, called this community into being, nursed it in its 
infancy through the inestimable benefits conferred by a divinely 
appointed Covenant, infused through His personal contact with its 
 
+P158 
members, and the proclamation of His Own Station, a new spirit into 
their souls; conferred, subsequently, through the revelation of His 
Tablets, the spiritual primacy designed to enable them to assume a 
preponderating role in the propagation of His Father's Faith; graciously 
aided them, following His ascension, to inaugurate their God-given 
mission by fixing the pattern, creating the institutions, and vindicating 
the purpose, of a divinely appointed Administrative Order and by 
launching subsequently the preliminary undertakings in their homeland, 
as well as in all the republics of Latin America, in anticipation of 
the formal inauguration of a systematic World Crusade for the furtherance 
of His Father's Cause; and more recently assisted them to embark, 
in concert with their brethren in other continents of the globe, upon 
the first stage of their world-encompassing mission, and to win a series 
of victories unprecedented in the annals of the Faith in their 
homeland--may He, through His watchful care and unfailing grace, 
continue to sustain them, individually and collectively, in the course of 
the remaining stages of the Plan, and enable them to bring to a 
triumphant termination the initial epoch in the unfoldment of the 
Divine Plan which He has primarily entrusted to them and on the 
successful prosecution of which their entire spiritual destiny must 
depend.
