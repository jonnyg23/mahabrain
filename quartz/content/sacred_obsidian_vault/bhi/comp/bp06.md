Intone, O My servants, the verses of God
  that have been received by thee,
as intoned by them who have drawn
  nigh unto Him,
that the sweetness of thy melody
  may kindle thine own soul,
and attract the hearts of all men.
  Whoso reciteth, in the privacy of his chamber,
the verses revealed by God,
  the scattering angels of the Almighty
shall scatter abroad the fragrance
  of the words uttered by his mouth,
and shall cause the heart
  of every righteous man to throb.
Though he may, at first, remain unaware
  of its effect, yet the virtue
of the grace vouchsafed unto him
  must needs sooner or later exercise
its influence upon his soul.
  Thus have the mysteries of the Revelation
of God been decreed
  by virtue of the Will of Him
Who is the Source of power and wisdom.

"The daily obligatory prayers are three in number. ...
The believer is entirely free to choose any one of these
three prayers, but is under the obligation of reciting
either one of them, and in accordance with any specific
directions with which they may be accompanied."
- from a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi

"By `morning,' `noon' and `evening,' mentioned in connection
with the Obligatory Prayers, is meant respectively
the intervals between sunrise and noon, between
noon and sunset, and from sunset till two hours after
sunset." - Synopsis and Codification of the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas,

                   SHORT OBLIGATORY PRAYER

          TO BE RECITED ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS,
                           AT NOON

   I bear witness, O my God, that Thou hast created
me to know Thee and to worship Thee.
I testify, at this moment, to my powerlessness
and to Thy might, to my poverty and to Thy
wealth.
   There is none other God but Thee, the Help in
Peril, the Self-Subsisting.


                  MEDIUM OBLIGATORY PRAYER

            TO BE RECITED DAILY, IN THE MORNING,
                 AT NOON, AND IN THE EVENING

   Whoso wisheth to pray, let him wash his hands, and
   while he washeth, let him say:

   Strengthen my hand, O my God, that it may
take hold of Thy Book with such steadfastness
that the hosts of the world shall have no


+P 5
power over it.  Guard it, then, from meddling
with whatsoever doth not belong unto it.  Thou
art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.

   And while washing his face, let him say:

   I have turned my face unto Thee, O my Lord!
Illumine it with the light of Thy countenance.
Protect it, then, from turning to anyone but Thee.

   Then let him stand up, and facing the Qiblih (Point of
   Adoration, i.e. &amp;Bahji, &amp;Akka), let him say:

   God testifieth that there is none other God but
Him.  His are the kingdoms of Revelation and of
creation.  He, in truth, hath manifested Him Who
is the Dayspring of Revelation, Who conversed
on Sinai, through Whom the Supreme Horizon
hath been made to shine, and the Lote-Tree beyond
which there is no passing hath spoken, and
through Whom the call hath been proclaimed
unto all who are in heaven and on earth:  "Lo, the
All-Possessing is come.  Earth and heaven, glory
and dominion are God's, the Lord of all men, and
the Possessor of the Throne on high and of earth
below!"


+P 6
   Let him, then, bend down, with hands resting on the
   knees, and say:

   Exalted art Thou above my praise and the praise
of anyone beside me, above my description and
the description of all who are in heaven and all
who are on earth!

   Then, standing with open hands, palms upward toward
   the face, let him say:

   Disappoint not, O my God, him that hath,
with beseeching fingers, clung to the hem of Thy
mercy and Thy grace, O Thou Who of those who
show mercy art the Most Merciful!

   Let him, then, be seated and say:

   I bear witness to Thy unity and Thy oneness,
and that Thou art God, and that there is none
other God beside Thee.  Thou hast, verily, revealed
thy Cause, fulfilled Thy Covenant, and
opened wide the door of Thy grace to all that
dwell in heaven and on earth.  Blessing and peace,
salutation and glory, rest upon Thy loved ones,
whom the changes and changes of the world have


+P 7
not deterred from turning unto Thee, and who
have given their all, in the hope of obtaining that
which is with Thee.  Thou art, in truth, the Ever-Forgiving,
the All-Bountiful.

   (If anyone choose to recite instead of the long verse these
   words:  "God testifieth that there is none other God but
   Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting," it would be
   sufficient.  And likewise, it would suffice were he, while
   seated, to choose to recite these words:  "I bear witness to
   Thy unity and Thy oneness, and that Thou art God, and
   that there is none other God beside Thee.")
                                       - &amp;Baha'u'llah

                   LONG OBLIGATORY PRAYER

           TO BE RECITED ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS

   Whoso wisheth to recite this prayer, let him stand up and
   turn unto God, and, as he standeth in his place, let him
   gaze to the right and to the left, as if awaiting the mercy of
   his Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate.  Then
   let him say:

   O Thou Who art the Lord of all names and
the Maker of the heavens!  I beseech Thee


+P 8
by them Who are the Daysprings of Thine invisible
Essence, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious,
to make of my prayer a fire that will burn away
the veils which have shut me out from Thy beauty,
and a light that will lead me unto the ocean of
Thy Presence.

   Let him then raise his hands in supplication toward God
   - blessed and exalted be He - and say:

   O Thou the Desire of the world and the Beloved
of the nations!  Thou seest me turning toward
Thee, and clinging to Thy cord, through
whose movement the whole creation hath been
stirred up.  I am Thy servant, O my Lord, and the
son of Thy servant.  Behold me standing ready to
do Thy will and Thy desire, and wishing naught
else except Thy good pleasure.  I implore Thee by
the Ocean of Thy mercy and the Daystar of Thy
grace to do with Thy servant as Thou willest and
pleasest.  By Thy might which is far above all
mention and praise!  Whatsoever is revealed by
Thee is the desire of my heart and the beloved of
my soul.  O God, my God!  Look not upon my


+P 9
hope and my doings, nay rather look upon Thy
will that hath encompassed the heavens and the
earth.  By Thy Most Great Name, O Thou Lord
of all nations!  I have desired only what Thou didst
desire, and love only what Thou dost love.

   Let him then kneel, and bowing his forehead to the ground,
   let him say:

   Exalted art Thou above the description of anyone
save Thyself, and the comprehension of aught
else except Thee.

   Let him then stand and say:

   Make my prayer, O my Lord, a fountain of
living waters whereby I may live as long as Thy
sovereignty endureth, and may make mention of
Thee in every world of Thy worlds.

   Let him again raise his hands in supplication, and say:

   O Thou in separation from Whom hearts and
souls have melted, and by the fire of Whose love
the whole world hath been set aflame!  I implore
Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast


+P 10
subdued the whole creation, not to withhold
from me that which is with Thee, O Thou Who
rulest over all men!  Thou seest, O my Lord, this
stranger hastening to his most exalted home beneath
the canopy of Thy majesty and within the
precincts of Thy mercy; and this transgressor
seeking the ocean of Thy forgiveness; and this
lowly one the court of Thy glory; and this poor
creature the orient of Thy wealth.  Thine is the authority
to command whatsoever Thou willest.  I
bear witness that Thou art to be praised in Thy
doings, and to be obeyed in Thy behests, and to
remain unconstrained in Thy bidding.

   Let him then raise his hands, and repeat three time the
   Greatest Name.1  Let him then bend down with hands
   resting on the knees before God - blessed and exalted be
   He - and say:

   Thou seest, O my God, how my spirit hath
been stirred up within my limbs and members, in
its longing to worship Thee, and in its yearning
to remember Thee and extol Thee; how it testifieth
to that whereunto the Tongue of Thy Commandment

   1. &amp;Allah-u-Abha


+P 10
   hath testified in the kingdom of Thine
utterance and the heaven of Thy knowledge.  I
love, in this state, O my Lord, to beg to Thee all
that is with Thee, that I may demonstrate my
poverty, and magnify Thy bounty and Thy
riches, and may declare my powerlessness, and
manifest Thy power and Thy might.

   Let him then stand and raise his hands twice in supplication,
   and say:

   There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the
All-Bountiful.  There is no God but Thee, the
Ordainer, both in the beginning and in the end.
O God, my God!  Thy forgiveness hath emboldened
me, and Thy mercy hath strengthened me,
and Thy call hath awakened me, and Thy grace
hath raised me up and led me unto Thee.  Who,
otherwise, am I that I should dare to stand at the
gate of the city of Thy nearness, or set my face
toward the lights that are shining from the heaven
of Thy will?  Thou seest, O my Lord, this wretched
creature knocking at the door of Thy grace,
and this evanescent soul seeking the river of everlasting
life from the hands of Thy bounty.  Thine


+P 13
is the command at all times, O Thou Who art the
Lord of all names; and mine is resignation and
willing submission to Thy will, O Creator of the
heavens!

   Let him then raise his hands thrice, and say:

   Greater is God than every great one!

   Let him then kneel and, bowing his forehead to the ground,
   say:

   Too high art Thou for the praise of those who
are nigh unto Thee to ascend unto the heaven of
Thy nearness, or for the birds of the hearts of
them who are devoted to Thee to attain to the
door of Thy gate.  I testify that Thou hast been
sanctified above all attributes and holy above all
names.  No God is there but Thee, the Most Exalted,
the All-Glorious.

   Let him then seat himself and say:

   I testify unto that whereunto have testified all
created things, and the Concourse on high, and
the inmates of the all-highest Paradise, and beyond


+P 13
them the Tongue of Grandeur itself from
the all-glorious Horizon, that Thou art God, that
there is no God but Thee, and that He who hath
been manifested is the Hidden Mystery, the Treasured
Symbol, through Whom the letters B and E
(Be) have been joined and knit together.  I testify
that it is He Whose name hath been set down by
the Pen of the Most High, and Who hath been
mentioned in the Books of God, the Lord of the
Throne on high and of earth below.

   Let him then stand erect and say:

   O Lord of all being and Possessor of all things
visible and invisible!  Thou dost perceive my tears
and the sighs I utter, and hearest my groaning,
and my wailing, and the lamentation of my heart.
By Thy might!  My trespasses have kept me back
from drawing nigh unto Thee; and my sins have
held me far from the court of Thy holiness.  Thy
love, O my Lord, hath enriched me, and separation
from Thee hath destroyed me, and remoteness
from Thee hath consumed me.  I entreat
Thee by Thy footsteps in this wilderness, and by
the words "Hear am I.  Here am I" which Thy


+P 14
chosen Ones have uttered in this immensity, and
by the breaths of Thy Revelation, and the gentle
winds of the Dawn of Thy Manifestation, to ordain
that I may gaze on Thy beauty and observe
whatsoever is in Thy Book.

   Let him then repeat the Greatest Name thrice, and bend
   down with hands resting on the knees, and say:

   Praise be to Thee, O my God, that Thou hast
aided me to remember Thee and to praise Thee,
and hast made known unto me Him Who is the
Dayspring of Thy signs, and hast caused me to
bow down before Thy Lordship, and humble
myself before Thy Godhead, and to acknowledge
that which hath been uttered by the Tongue
of Thy grandeur.

   Let him then rise and say:

   O God, my God!  My back is bowed by the
burden of my sins, and my heedlessness hath destroyed
me.  Whenever I ponder my evil doings
and Thy benevolence, my heart melteth within
me, and my blood boileth in my veins.  By Thy


+P 15
Beauty, O Thou the Desire of the world!  I blush
to life up my face to Thee, and my longing hands
are ashamed to stretch forth toward the heaven of
Thy bounty.  Thou seest, O my God, how my
tears prevent me from remembering Thee and
from extolling Thy virtues, O Thou the Lord of
the Throne on high and of earth below!  I implore
Thee by the signs of Thy Kingdom and the mysteries
of Thy Dominion to do with Thy loved
ones as becometh Thy bounty, O Lord of all being,
and is worthy of Thy grace, O KIng of the
seen and the unseen!

   Let him then repeat the Greatest Name thrice, and kneel
   with his forehead to the ground, and say:

   Praise be unto Thee, O our God, that Thou
hast sent down unto us that which draweth us
nigh unto Thee, and supplieth us with every good
thing sent down by Thee in Thy Books and Thy
Scriptures.  Protect us, we beseech Thee, O my
Lord, from the hosts of idle fancies and vain imaginations.
Thou, in truth, art the Mighty, the
All-Knowing.


+P 16
   Let him then raise his head, and seat himself, and say:

   I testify, O my God, to that whereunto thy
chosen Ones have testified, and acknowledge
that which the inmates of the all-highest Paradise
and those who have circled round Thy mighty
Throne have acknowledged.  The kingdoms of
earth and heaven are Thine, O Lord of the worlds!
                                       - &amp;Baha'u'llah

+P 18

+P 19

                     AID AND ASSISTANCE

   O Thou Whose face is the object of my adoration,
Whose beauty is my sanctuary,
Whose habitation is my goal, Whose praise is my
hope, Whose providence is my companion,
Whose love is the cause of my being, Whose mention
is my solace, Whose nearness is my desire,
Whose presence is my dearest wish and highest
aspiration, I entreat Thee not to withhold from
me the things Thou didst ordain for the chosen
ones among Thy servants.  Supply me, then, with
the good of this world and of the next.
   Thou, truly, art the King of all men.  There is
no God but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most
Generous.                              - &amp;Baha'u'llah


   My God, my Adored One, my King, my desire!
What tongue can voice my thanks
to Thee?  I was heedless, Thou didst awaken me.  I
had turned back from Thee, Thou didst graciously


+P 20
aid me to turn towards Thee.  I was as one dead,
Thou didst quicken me with the water of life.  I
was withered, Thou didst revive me with the
heavenly stream of Thine utterance which hath
flowed forth from the Pen of the All-Merciful.
   O Divine Providence!  All existence is begotten
by Thy bounty; deprive it not of the waters of
Thy generosity, neither do Thou withhold it from
the ocean of Thy mercy.  I beseech Thee to aid and
assist me at all times and under all conditions, and
seek from the heaven of Thy grace Thine ancient
favor.  Thou art, in truth, the Lord of bounty, and
the Sovereign of the kingdom of eternity.
                                       - &amp;Baha'u'llah


   Lauded be Thy Name, O Lord our God!  Thou
art in truth the Knower of things unseen.
Ordain for us such good as Thine all-embracing
knowledge can measure.  Thou art the sovereign
Lord, the Almighty, the Best-Beloved.
   All praise be unto Thee, O Lord!  We shall seek
Thy grace on the appointed Day and shall put our
whole reliance in Thee, Who art our Lord.  Glorified


+P 21
art Thou, O God!  Grant us that which is
good and seemly that we may be able to dispense
with everything but Thee.  Verily, Thou art the
Lord of all worlds.
   O God! Recompense those who endure patiently
in Thy days, and strengthen their hearts to
walk undeviatingly in the path of Truth.  Grant
then, O Lord, such goodly gifts as would enable
them to gain admitance into Thy blissful Paradise.
Exalted art Thou, O Lord God.  Let Thy heavenly
blessings descend upon homes whose inmates
have believed in Thee.  Verily, unsurpassed art
Thou in sending down divine blessings.  Send
forth, O God, such hosts as would render Thy
faithful servants victorious.  Thou dost fashion
the created things through the power of Thy decree
as Thou pleasest.  Thou art in truth the Sovereign,
the Creator, the All-Wise.
   Say:  God is indeed the Maker of all things.  He
giveth sustenance in plenty to whomsoever He
willeth.  He is the Creator, the Source of all beings,
the Fashioner, the Almighty, the Maker, the All-Wise.
He is the Bearer of the most excellent titles
throughout the heavens and the earth and whatever
lieth between them.  All do His bidding, and


+P 22
all the dwellers of earth and heaven celebrate His
praise, and unto Him shall all return.      - The &amp;Bab


   O my God, my Lord and my Master!  I have
detached myself from my kindred and
have sought through Thee to become independent
of all that swell on earth and ever ready to
receive that which is praiseworthy in Thy sight.
Bestow on me such good as will make me independent
of aught else but Thee, and grant me an
ampler share of Thy boundless favors.  Verily,
Thou art the Lord of grace abounding.       - The &amp;Bab


   Lord!  Pitiful are we, grant us Thy favor; poor,
bestow upon us a share from the ocean of
Thy wealth; needy, do Thou satisfy us; abased,
give us Thy glory.  The fowls of the air and the
beasts of the field receive their meat each day from
Thee, and all beings partake of Thy care and loving-kindness.
   Deprive not this feeble one of Thy wondrous
grace and vouchsafe by Thy might unto this helpless
soul Thy bounty.


+P 23
   Give us our daily bread, and grant Thine increase
in the necessities of life, that we may be dependent
on none other but Thee, may commune
wholly with Thee, may walk in Thy ways and
declare Thy mysteries.  Thou art the almighty
and the Loving and the Provider of all mankind.
                                       - &amp;Abdu'l-Baha


   O Thou kind Lord!  We are servants of Thy
Threshold, taking shelter at Thy holy
Door.  We seek no refuge save only this strong pillar,
turn nowhere for a haven but unto Thy safekeeping.
Protect us, bless us, support us, make us
such that we shall love but Thy good pleasure,
utter only Thy praise, follow only the pathway of
truth, that we may become rich enough to dispense
with all save Thee, and receive our gifts
from the sea of Thy beneficence, that we may
ever strive to exalt Thy Cause and to spread Thy
sweet savors far and wide, that we may become
oblivious of self and occupied only with Thee,
and disown all else and be caught up in Thee.
   O Thou Provider, O Thou Forgiver!  Grant us
Thy grace and loving-kindness, Thy gifts and Thy
bestowals, and sustain us, that we may attain our


+P 24
goal.  Thou art the Powerful, the Able, the Knower,
the Seer; and, verily, Thou art the Generous,
and, verily, Thou art the All-Merciful, and, verily,
Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, He to Whom repentance
is due, He Who forgiveth even the most
grievous of sins.                      - &amp;Abdu'l-Baha


   Remove not, O Lord, the festal board that hath
been spread in Thy Name, and extinguish
not the burning flame that hath been kindled by
Thine unquenchable fire.  Withhold not from
flowing that living water of Thine that murmureth
with the melody of Thy glory and Thy
remembrance, and deprive not Thy servants from
the fragrance of Thy sweet savors breathing forth
the perfume of Thy love.
   Lord!  Turn the distressing cares of Thy holy
ones into ease, their hardship into comfort, their
abasement into glory, their sorrow into blissful
joy, O Thou that holdest in Thy grasp the reins of
all mankind!
   Thou art, verily, the One, the Single, the
Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

                     PRAYER FOR AMERICA

   O Thou kind Lord!  This gathering is turning
to Thee.  These hearts are radiant with
Thy love.  These minds and spirits are exhilarated
by the message of Thy glad-tidings.  O God!  Let
this American democracy become glorious in
spiritual degrees even as it has aspired to material
degrees, and render this just government victorious.
Confirm this revered nation to upraise the
standard of the oneness of humanity, to promulgate
the Most Great Peace, to become thereby
most glorious and praiseworthy among all the
nations of the world.  O God!  This American nation
is worthy of Thy favors and is deserving of
Thy mercy.  Make it precious and near to Thee
through Thy bounty and bestowal.

                    ASSISTANCE WITH TESTS

   Dispel my grief by Thy bounty and Thy generosity,
O God, my God, and banish mine
anguish through Thy sovereignty and Thy might.
Thou seest me, O my god, with my face set towards
Thee at a time when sorrows have compassed
me on every side.  I implore Thee, O Thou
Who art the Lord of all being, and overshadowest
all things visible and invisible, by Thy Name
whereby Thou hast subdued the hearts and the
souls of men, and by the billows of the Ocean of
Thy mercy and the splendors of the Daystar of
Thy bounty, to number me with them whom
nothing whatsoever hath deterred from setting
their faces toward Thee, O Thou Lord of all
names and Maker of the heavens!
   Thou beholdest, O my Lord, the things which
have befallen me in Thy days.  I entreat Thee, by
Him Who is the Dayspring of Thy names and the
Dawning-Place of Thine attributes, to ordain for
me what will enable me to arise to serve Thee and


+P 27
to extol Thy virtues.  Thou art, verily, the Almighty,
the Most Powerful, Who art wont to answer
the prayers of all men!
   And, finally, I beg of Thee by the light of Thy
countenance to bless my affairs, and redeem my
debts, and satisfy my needs.  Thou art He to
Whose power and to Whose dominion every
tongue hath testified, and Whose majesty and
Whose sovereignty every understanding heart
hath acknowledged.  No God is there but Thee,
Who hearest and art ready to answer.
                                       - &amp;Baha'u'llah


   Lauded and glorified art thou, O my God!  I entreat
Thee by the sighing of Thy lovers and

Thee, not to withhold from me Thy tender mercies

therefore, by Thy Self, the Exalted, the Most
High, not to abandon me unto mine own self and
unto the desires of a corrupt inclination.  Hold
Thou my hand with the hand of Thy power, and
deliver me from the depths of my fancies and idle
imaginings, and cleanse me of all that is abhorrent
unto Thee.
   Cause me, then, to turn wholly unto Thee, to
put my whole trust in Thee, to seek Thee as my
Refuge, and to flee unto Thy face.  Thou art, verily,
He Who, through the power of His might,
doeth whatsoever He desireth, and commandeth,
through the potency of His will, whatsover
He chooseth.  None can withstand the operation
of Thy decree; none can divert the course of Thine
appointment.  Thou art, in truth, the Almighty,

   I know not, O my God, what the Fire is which
Thou didst kindle in Thy land.  Earth can
never cloud its splendor, nor water quench its
flame.  All the peoples of the world are powerless
to resist its force.  Great is the blessedness of him
that hath drawn nigh unto it, and heard its roaring.
   Some, O my God, Thou didst, through Thy
strengthening grace, enable to approach it, while
others Thou didst keep back by reason of what
their hands have wrought in Thy days.  Whoso
hath hasted towards it and attained unto it hath,
in his eagerness to gaze on Thy beauty, yielded his


+P 53
life in Thy path, and ascended unto Thee, wholly
detached from aught else except Thyself.
   I beseech Thee, O my God, by this Fire which
blazeth and rageth in the world of creation, to rend
asunder the veils that have hindered me from appearing
before the throne of Thy majesty, and
from standing at the door of Thy gate.  Do Thou
ordain for me, O my Lord, every good thing
Thou didst send down in Thy Book, and suffer
me not to be far removed from the shelter of Thy
mercy.
   Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee.

Generous.                              - &amp;Baha'u'llah


   Praise be unto Thee, O my God!  I am one of
Thy servants, who hath believed on Thee
and on Thy signs.  Thou seest how I have set myself
towards the door of Thy mercy, and turned
my face in the direction of Thy loving-kindness.  I
beseech Thee, by Thy most excellent titles and
Thy most exalted attributes, to open to my face
the portals of Thy bestowals.  Aid me, then, to do


+P 54
that which is good, O Thou Who art the Possessor
of all names and attributes!
   I am poor, O my Lord, and Thou art the Rich.
I have set my face towards Thee, and detached
myself from all but Thee.  Deprive me not, I implore
Thee, of the breezes of Thy tender mercy,
and withhold not from me what Thou didst ordain
for the chosen among Thy servants.
   Remove the veil from mine eyes, O my Lord,
that I may recognize what Thou hast desired for
Thy creatures, and discover, in all the manifestations
of Thy handiwork, the revelations of Thine
almighty power.  Enrapture my soul, O my Lord,
with Thy most mighty signs, and draw me out of
the depths of my corrupt and evil desires.  Write
down, then, for me the good of this world and of
the world to come.  Potent art Thou to do what
pleaseth Thee.  No God is there but Thee, the All-Glorious,
Who help is sought by all men.
   I yield Thee thanks, O my Lord, that Thou hast
wakened me from my sleep, and stirred me up,
and created in me the desire to perceive what most
of Thy servants have failed to apprehend.  Make
me able, therefore, O my Lord, to behold, for
love of Thee and for the Sake of Thy pleasure,


+P 55
whatsoever Thou hast desired.  Thou art He to the
power of Whose might and sovereignty all things
testify.
   There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty,
the Beneficent.                        - &amp;Baha'u'llah


   In the Name of Thy Lord, the Creator, the Sovereign,
the All-Sufficing, the Most Exalted,
He Whose help is implored by all men.
   Say:  O my God!  O Thou Who art the Maker of
the heavens and of the earth, O Lord of the Kingdom!
Thou well knowest the secrets of my heart,
while Thy Being is inscrutable to all save Thyself.
Thou seest whatsoever is of me, while no one else
can do this save Thee.  Vouchsafe unto me,
through Thy grace, what will enable me to dispense
with all except Thee, and destine for me that
which will make me independent of everyone
else besides Thee.  Grant that I may reap the benefit
of my life in this world and in the next.  Open
to my face the portals of Thy grace, and graciously
confer upon me Thy tender mercy and bestowals.

   O Thou Who art the Lord of grace abounding!
Let Thy celestial aid surround those who love
Thee, and bestow upon us the gifts and the bounties

of all things, forgive our sins and have mercy upon
us.  Thou art Our Lord and the Lord of all created

the assaults of passion and desire, break off from
me the shackles of this nether world, draw me
with rapture unto Thy supernal realm, and refresh
me amongst the handmaids with the breathings
of Thy holiness.
   O Lord, brighten Thou my face with the lights

   I beg of Thee, O my Lord, by Thine eye that
sleepeth not, to guard mine eyes from beholding
aught beside Thee.  Strengthen, then, their vision
that they may discern Thy signs, and behold the
Horizon of Thy Revelation.  Thou art He before

are wakeful because of their separation from
Thee; and how can I lie down to rest whilst the

souls of Thy lovers are sore vexed in their remoteness
from Thy presence?
   I have committed, O my Lord, my spirit and

   By Thy might!  I ask not, whether sleeping or
waking, but that which Thou dost desire.  I am
Thy servant and in Thy hands.  Do Thou graciously

Thy good pleasure, and from attaining the shores
of the ocean of Thy oneness.

from the horizon of Thy Name, the Ever-Forgiving,
to grant me Thy pardon and to have mercy

dominion of the nations has been powerless to
withhold from Thee, and who, advancing towards

celebrate Thy praise.  My great confidence in Thy

my certitude that Thou wilt bountifully deal with

Thee the things Thou dost possess.
   I implore Thee, O my God, by Thy mercy that
hath surpassed all created things, and to which all
that are immersed beneath the oceans of Thy
names bear witness, not to abandon me unto my

within the stronghold of Thy protection and the
shelter of Thy care.  I am he, O my God, whose
only wish to what Thou hast determined by the
power of Thy might.  All I have chosen for myself
is to be assisted by Thy gracious appointments
and the ruling of Thy will, and to be aided with the

of the hearts which long for Thee, by the Manifestations
of Thy Cause and the Daysprings of

   Aught else except Thee, O my Lord, profiteth
me not, and near access to anyone save Thyself

with all else except Thyself, to number me
with such as have set their faces towards Thee, and
arisen to serve Thee.
   Forgive, then, O my Lord, Thy servants and
Thy handmaidens.  Thou, truly, art the Ever-Forgiving,

   O God our Lord!  Protect us through Thy
grace from whatsoever my be repugnant
unto Thee, and vouchsafe unto us that which
well beseemeth Thee.  Give us more out of Thy
bounty, and bless us.  Pardon us for the things we
have done, and wash away our sins, and forgive us
with Thy gracious forgiveness.  Verily, Thou art
the Most Exalted, the Self-Subsisting.
   Thy loving providence hath encompassed all
created things in the heavens and on the earth,
and Thy forgiveness hath surpassed the whole
creation.  Thine is sovereignty; in Thy hand are the

Kingdoms of Creation and Revelation; in Thy
right hand Thou holdest all created things, and
within Thy grasp are the assigned measures of forgiveness.
Thou forgivest whomsoever among
Thy servants Thou pleasest.  Verily, Thou art the
Ever-Forgiving, the All-Loving.  Nothing whatsoever
escapeth Thy knowledge, and naught is
there which is hidden from Thee.
   O God our Lord!  Protect us through the potency
of Thy might, enable us to enter Thy wondrous
surging ocean, and grant us that which well
befitteth Thee.

return unto Thee.  Suffer us not to rely on aught
else besides Thee, and vouchsafe unto us, through
Thy bounty, that which Thou lovest and desirest
and well beseemeth Thee.  Exalt the station of
them that have truly believed, and forgive them
with Thy gracious forgiveness.  Verily, Thou art

   I beg Thee to forgive me, O my Lord, for every

every praise but the praise of Thee, and for every

pleasure but the pleasure of communion with
Thee, and for every joy but the joy of Thy love
and of Thy good-pleasure, and for all things pertaining
unto me which bear no relationship unto
Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of lords, He Who

from the praise of all mankind.  Magnified be
Thy Name, O God, Thou art the King, the Eternal
Truth; Thou knowest what is in the heavens
and on the earth, and unto Thee must all return.
Thou hast sent down Thy divinely ordained Revelation
according to a clear measure.  Praised art
Thou, O Lord!  At Thy behest Thou dost render
victorious whomsoever Thou willest, through
the hosts of heaven and earth and whatsoever existeth

between them.  Thou art the Sovereign, the
Eternal Truth, the Lord of invincible might.
   Glorified art Thou, O Lord, Thou forgivest at
all times the sins of such among Thy servants as
implore Thy pardon.  Wash away my sins and the
sins of those who seek Thy forgiveness at dawn,
who pray to Thee in the daytime and in the night
season, who yearn after naught save God, who
offer up whatsoever God hath graciously bestowed
upon them, who celebrate Thy praise at
morn and eventide, and who are not remiss in
their duties.                               - The &amp;Bab


   O Thou forgiving Lord!  Thou art the shelter

We are all sinners, and Thou art the Forgiver
of sins, the Merciful, the Compassionate.
O Lord!  Look not at our shortcomings.  Deal with
us according to Thy grace and bounty.  Our shortcomings
are many, but the ocean of Thy forgiveness
is boundless.  Our weakness is grievous, but
the evidences of Thine aid and assistance are clear.


+P 83
Therefore, confirm and strengthen us.  Enable us
to do that which is worthy of Thy holy Threshold.
Illumine our hearts, grant us discerning eyes
and attentive ears.  Resuscitate the dead and heal
the sick.  Bestow wealth upon the poor and give
peace and security to the fearful.  Accept us in Thy
kingdom and illumine us with the light of guidance.

                          THE FUND

   All the friends of God ... should contribute to the extent

   not burden a soul beyond its capacity.  Such contributions
   must come from all centers and all believers. ... O
   Friends of God!  Be ye assured that in place of these contributions,
   your agriculture, your industry, and your commerce
   will be blessed by manifold increases, with goodly
   gifts and bestowals.  He who cometh with one goodly deed
   will receive a tenfold reward.  There is no doubt that the
   living Lord will abundantly confirm those who expend
   their wealth in His path.

   O God, my God!  Illumine the brows of Thy
true lovers, and support them with angelic
hosts of certain triumph.  Set firm their feet on
Thy straight path, and out of Thine ancient
bounty open before them the portals of Thy blessings;
for they are expending on Thy pathway
what Thou hast bestowed upon them, safeguarding
Thy Faith, putting their trust in their remembrance


+P 84
of Thee, offering up their hearts for love
of Thee, and withholding not what they possess in
adoration for Thy Beauty and in their search for
ways to please Thee.
   O my Lord!  Ordain for them a plenteous share,
a destined recompense and sure reward.
   Verily, Thou art the Sustainer, the Helper, the

   O God, my God!  I beg of Thee by the ocean
of Thy healing, and by the splendors of
the Daystar of Thy grace, and by Thy Name
through which Thou didst subdue Thy servants,
and by the pervasive power of Thy most exalted
Word and the potency of Thy most exalted

and by Thy mercy that hath preceded the creation
of all who are in heaven and on earth, to purge me
with the waters of Thy bounty from every affliction
and disorder, and from all weakness and
feebleness.
   Thou seest, O my Lord, Thy suppliant waiting
at the door of Thy bounty, and him who hath
set his hopes on Thee clinging to the cord of Thy
generosity.  Deny him not, I beseech Thee, the
things he seeketh from the ocean of Thy grace and
the Daystar of Thy loving-kindness.
   Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee.
There is none other God save Thee, the Ever-Forgiving,

didst reveal the sovereignty of Thy Lordship;
through which the lamp of Thy names hath appeared
within the niche of Thine attributes, and
He Who is the Tabernacle of Thy unity and the
Manifestation of detachment hath shone forth;
through which the ways of Thy guidance were
made known, and the paths of Thy good pleasure
were marked out; through which the foundations
of error have been made to tremble, and the signs
of wickedness have been abolished; through
which the fountains of wisdom have burst forth,
and the heavenly table hath been sent down;


+P 88
through which Thou didst preserve Thy servants
and didst vouchsafe Thy healing; through which
Thou didst show forth Thy tender mercies unto
Thy servants and revealedst Thy forgiveness
amidst Thy creatures - I implore Thee to keep
safe him who hath held fast and returned unto
Thee, and clung to Thy mercy, and seized the
hem of Thy loving providence.  Send down, then,
upon him with a constancy vouchsafed by Thee,
and a tranquillity bestowed by Thy highness.

and Thy most august attributes, to assist Thy
people to turn in the direction of Thy manifold
bounties, and set their faces towards the Tabernacle

of Thy wisdom.  Heal Thou the sicknesses
that have assailed the souls on every side, and have
deterred them from directing their gaze towards
the Paradise that lieth in the shelter of Thy shadowing
Name, which Thou didst ordain to be the
King of all names unto all who are in heaven and
all who are on earth.  Potent art Thou to do as
pleaseth Thee.  In Thy hands is the empire of all
names.  There is none other God but Thee, the
Mighty, the Wise.
   I am but a poor creature, O my Lord; I have
clung to the hem of Thy riches.  I am sore sick; I
have held fast the cord of Thy healing.  Deliver me
from the ills that have encircled me, and wash me
thoroughly with the waters of Thy graciousness
and mercy, and attire me with the raiment of
wholesomeness, through Thy forgiveness and
bounty.  Fix, then, mine eyes upon Thee, and rid
me of all attachment to aught else except Thyself.
Aid me to do what Thou desirest, and to fulfill
what Thou pleasest.

which Thou changest all things, and gatherest together
all things, and callest to account all things,

attain the Wellspring of Thy tranquillity; burdened
with sin, and hath set her face toward the

O my God and my Beloved, with the

   Thou art the Mighty and Powerful, Thou art
the Forgiving and Thou art the One Who overlooketh
the shortcomings of all mankind.

   O God, O Thoug Who has cast They splendor
over the luminous realities of men, shedding
upon them the resplendent lights of knowledge
and guidance, and has chosen them out of
all created things for this supernal grace, and hast
caused them to encompass all things, to understand
their inmost essence, and to disclose their
mysteries, bringing them forth out of darkness
into the visible world! "He verily showeth His
special mercy to whomsoever He will."1
   O Lord, help Thou Thy loved ones to acquire
knowledge and the sciences and arts, and to unravel
the secrets that are treasured up in the inmost
reality of all created things. Make them to
hear the hidden truths that are written and
embedded in the heart of all that is. Make them
to be ensigns of guidance amongst all creatures,
and piercing rays of the mind shedding forth
their light in this, the "first life."2 Make them to
be leaders unto Thee, guides unto Thy path,
runners urging men on to Thy Kingdom.
   Thou verily art the Powerful, the Protector,
the Potent, the Defender, the Mighty, the Most
Generous.                    -&amp;'Abdu'l-Baha

                          MARRIAGE

"&amp;Baha'i marriage is union and cordial affection between
the two parties.  They must, however, exercise
the utmost care and become acquainted with each other's
character.  This eternal bond should be made secure by a
firm covenant, and the intention should be to foster harmony,
fellowship and unity and to attain everlasting
life." - &amp;Abdu'l-Baha

The pledge of marriage, the verse to be spoken individually
by the bride and the bridegroom in the presence
of at least two witnesses acceptable to the Spiritual
Assembly is, as stipulated in the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas
(The Most Holy Book):

   "We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God."


   He is the Bestower, the Bounteous!
   Praise be to God, the Ancient, the Ever-Abiding,
the Changeless, the Eternal!  He Who
hath testified in His Own Being that verily He is


+P 105
the One, the Single, the Untrammelled, the Exalted.
We bear witness that verily there is no God
but Him, acknowledging His oneness, confessing
His singleness.  He hath ever dwelt in unapproachable
heights, in the summits of His loftiness,
sanctified from the mention of aught save
Himself, free from the description of aught but
Him.
   And when He desired to manifest grace and
beneficence to men, and to set the world in order,
He revealed observances and created laws; among
them He established the law of marriage, made it
as a fortress for well-being and salvation, and enjoined
it upon us in that which was sent down out
of the heaven of sanctity in His Most Holy Book.
He saith, great is His glory:  "Marry, O people,
that from you may appear he who will remember
Me amongst My servants; this is one of My commandments
unto you; obey it as an assistance to
yourselves."                           - &amp;Baha'u'llah


   He is God!
   O peerless Lord!  In Thine almighty wisdom
Thou hast enjoined marriage upon the peoples,


+P 106
that the generations of men may succeed one
another in this contingent world, and that ever, so
long as the world shall last, they may busy themselves
at the Threshold of Thy oneness with servitude
and worship, with salutation, adoration and
praise.  "I have not created spirits and men, but
that they should worship me."1  Wherefore, wed
Thou in the heaven of Thy mercy these two birds
of the nest of Thy love, and make them the means
of attracting perpetual grace; that from the union
of these two seas of love a wave of tenderness
may surge and cast the pearls of pure and goodly
issue on the shore of life.  "He hath let loose the
two seas, that they meet each other:  Between
them is a barrier which they overpass not.  Which
then of the bounties of your Lord will ye deny?
From each He bringeth up greater and lesser
pearls."2
   O Thou kind Lord!  Make Thou this marriage
to bring forth coral and pearls.  Thou art verily
the All-Powerful, the Most Great, the Ever-Forgiving.

   Glory be unto Thee, O my God!  Verily, this
thy servant and this Thy maidservant
have gathered under the shadow of Thy mercy
and they are united through Thy favor and generosity.
O Lord!  Assist them in this Thy world and
Thy kingdom and destine for them every good
through Thy bounty and grace.  O Lord!  Confirm
them in Thy servitude and assist them in Thy
service.  Suffer them to become the signs of Thy
Name in Thy world and protect them through
Thy bestowals which are inexhaustible in this
world and the world to come.  O Lord!  They are
supplicating the kingdom of Thy mercifulness
and invoking the realm of Thy singleness.  Verily,
they are married in obedience to Thy command.
Cause them to become the signs of harmony and
unity until the end of time.  Verily, Thou art the
Omnipotent, the Omnipresent and the Almighty!

   O my Lord, O my Lord!  These two bright
moons are wedded in Thy love, conjoined
in servitude to Thy Holy Threshold, united in
ministering to thy Cause.  Make Thou this marriage


+P 108
to be as threading lights of Thine abounding
grace, O my Lord, the All-Merciful, the luminous
rays of Thy bestowals, O Thou the Beneficent,
the Ever-Giving, that there may branch out
from this great tree boughs that will grown green
and flourishing through the gifts that rain down
from Thy clouds of grace.

art the Compassionate, the All-Merciful.    - &amp;Abdu'l-Baha

   Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God!  I implore
Thee by the onrushing winds of Thy
grace, and by them Who are the Daysprings of
Thy purpose and the Dawning-Places of Thine
inspiration, to send down upon me and upon all
that have sought Thy face that which beseemeth
thy generosity and bountiful grace, and is worthy
of Thy bestowals and favors.  Poor and desolate
I am, O my Lord!  Immerse me in the ocean of
Thy Wealth; athirst, suffer me to drink from the
living waters of Thy loving-kindness.
   I beseech Thee, by Thine own Self and by Him
Whom Thou hast appointed as the Manifestation
of Thine own Being and Thy discriminating
Word unto all that are in heaven and on earth, to
gather together Thy servants beneath the shade of
the Tree of Thy gracious providence.  Help them,
then, to partake of its fruits, to incline their ears
to the rustling of its leaves, and to the sweetness
of the voice of the Bird that chanteth upon its


+P 110
branches.  Thou art, verily, the Help in Peril, the
Inaccessible, the Almighty, the Most Bountiful.

   O Thou merciful God!  O Thou Who art
might and powerful!  O Thou most kind
Father!  These servants have gathered together,
turning to Thee, supplicating Thy threshold, desiring
Thine endless bounties from Thy great assurance.
They have no purpose save Thy good
pleasure.  They have no intention save service to
the world of humanity.
   O God!  Make this assemblage radiant.  Make
the hearts merciful.  Confer the bounties of the
Holy Spirit.  Endow them with a power from
heaven.  Bless them with heavenly minds.  Increase
their sincerity, so that with all humility and contrition
they may turn to Thy kingdom and be occupied
with service to the world of humanity.
May each one become a radiant candle.  May each
one become a brilliant star.  May each one become
beautiful in color and redolent of fragrance in the
kingdom of God.
   O kind Father!  Confer Thy blessings.  Consider


+P 111
not our shortcomings.  Shelter us under Thy protection.
Remember not our sins.  Heal us with Thy
mercy.  We are sick; Thou art mighty.  We are
poor; Thou art rich.  We are sick; Thou art the
Physician.  We are needy; Thou art most generous.
   O God!  Endow us with Thy providence.  Thou
art the Powerful.  Thou art the Giver.  Thou art the
Beneficent.                           - &amp;Abdu'l-Baha


   O Thou kind Lord!  These are Thy servants
who have gathered in this meeting, have
turned unto Thy kingdom and are in need of Thy
bestowal and blessing.  O Thou God!  Manifest
and make evident the signs of Thy oneness which
have been deposited in all the realities of life.  Reveal
and unfold the virtues which Thou hast made
latent and concealed in these human realities.
   O God!  We are as plants, and Thy bounty is as
the rain; refresh and cause these plants to grow
through Thy bestowal.  We are Thy servants; free
us from the fetters of material existence.  We are
ignorant; make us wise.  We are dead; make us
alive.  We are material; endow us with spirit.  We


+P 112
are deprived; make us the intimates of Thy mysteries.
We are needy; enrich and bless us from Thy
boundless treasury.  O God!  Resuscitate us; give
us sight; give us hearing; familiarize us with the
mysteries of life, so that the secrets of Thy kingdom
may become revealed to us in this world of
existence and we may confess Thy oneness.  Every
bestowal emanates from Thee; every benediction
is Thine.
   Thou art mighty.  Thou art powerful.  Thou art
the Giver, and Thou art the Ever-Bounteous.

   O my God!  O my God!  Verily, these servants
are turning to Thee, supplicating Thy
kingdom of mercy.  Verily, they are attracted by
Thy holiness and set aglow with the fire of Thy
love, seeking confirmation from Thy wondrous
kingdom, and hoping for attainment in Thy heavenly
realm.  Verily, they long for the descent of
Thy bestowal, desiring illumination from the Sun
of Reality.  O Lord!  Make them radiant lamps,
merciful signs, fruitful trees and shining stars.  May
they come forth in Thy service and be connected


+P 113
with Thee by the bonds and ties of Thy love, longing
for the lights of Thy favor.  O Lord!  Make
them signs of guidance, standards of Thine immortal
kingdom, waves of the sea of Thy mercy,
mirrors of the light of Thy majesty.
   Verily, Thou art the Generous.  Verily, Thou
art the Merciful.  Verily, Thou art the Precious,
the Beloved.                           - &amp;Abdu'l-Baha


   O Thou forgiving God!  These servants are
turning to Thy kingdom and seeking Thy
grace and bounty.  O God!  Make their hearts good
and pure in order that they may become worthy
of Thy love.  Purify and sanctify the spirits that the
light of the Sun of Reality may shine upon them.
Purify and sanctify the eyes that they may perceive
Thy light.  Purify and sanctify the ears in
order that they may hear the call of Thy kingdom.
   O Lord!  Verily, we are weak, but Thou art
mighty.  Verily, we are poor, but Thou art rich.
We are seekers, and Thou art the One sought.
O Lord!  Have compassion upon us and forgive us;
bestow upon us such capacity and receptiveness
that we may be worthy of Thy favors and become

attracted to Thy kingdom, that we may drink
deep of the water of life, may be enkindled by the
fire of Thy love, and be resuscitated through the
breaths of the Holy Spirit in this radiant century.
   O God, my God!  Cast upon this gathering the
glances of Thy loving-kindness.  Keep safe each
and all in Thy custody and under Thy protection.
Send down upon these souls Thy heavenly blessings.
Immerse them in the ocean of Thy mercy,
and quicken them through the breaths of the Holy
Spirit.
   O Lord!  Bestow Thy gracious aid and confirmation
upon this just government.  This country
lieth beneath the sheltering shadow of Thy
protection, and this people is in Thy service.  O
Lord!  Confer upon them Thy heavenly bounty
and render the outpourings of Thy grace and favor
copious and abundant.  Suffer this esteemed nation
to be held in honor, and enable it to be admitted
into Thy kingdom.

Spirit, grant them eloquent tongues and resolute
hearts, bestow upon them heavenly power and

                           MORNING

   O my God and my Master!  I am Thy servant
and the son of Thy servant.  I have risen
from my couch at this dawntide when the Daystar
of Thy oneness hath shone forth from the Dayspring
of Thy will, and hath shed its radiance upon
the whole world, according to what had been ordained
in the Books of Thy Decree.
   Praise be unto Thee, O my God, that we have
wakened to the splendors of the light of Thy
knowledge.  Send down, then, upon us, O my
Lord, what will enable us to dispense with anyone
but Thee, and will rid us of all attachment to aught
except Thyself.  Write down, moreover, for me,
and for such as are dear to me, and for my kindred,
man and woman alike, the good of this world and
the world to come.  Keep us safe, then, through
Thine unfailing protection, O Thou the Beloved
of the entire creation and the Desire of the whole
universe, from them whom Thou hast made to
be the manifestations of the Evil Whisperer, who


+P 117
whisper in men's breasts.  Potent art Thou to do
Thy pleasure.  Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the
Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.
   Bless Thou, O Lord my God, Him Whom
Thou hast set over Thy most excellent Titles, and
through Whom Thou hast divided between the
godly and the wicked, and graciously aid us to do
what Thou lovest and desirest.  Bless Thou, moreover,
O my God, them Who are Thy Words and
Thy Letters, and them who have set their faces
towards Thee, and turned unto Thy face, and
hearkened to Thy Call.
   Thou art, verily, the Lord and King of all men,
and art potent over all things.        - &amp;Baha'u'llah


   I have wakened in Thy shelter, O my God, and
it becometh him that seeketh that shelter to
abide within the Sanctuary of Thy protection and
the Stronghold of Thy defense.  Illumine my inner
being, O my Lord, with the splendors of the Dayspring
of Thy Revelation, even as Thou didst illumine
my outer being with the morning light of
Thy favor.                             - &amp;Baha'u'llah

   I have risen this morning by Thy grace, O my
God, and left my home trusting wholly in
Thee, and committing myself to Thy care.  Send
down, then, upon me, out of the heaven of Thy
mercy, a blessing from Thy side, and enable me
to return home in safety even as Thou didst enable
me to set out under Thy protection with my
thoughts fixed steadfastly upon Thee.
   There is none other God but Thee, the One, the
Incomparable, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

   I give praise to Thee, O my God, that Thou hast
awakened me out of my sleep, and brought
me forth after my disappearance, and raised me
up from my slumber.  I have wakened this morning
with my face set toward the splendors of the
Daystar of thy Revelation, through Which the
heavens of Thy power and Thy majesty have been
illumined, acknowledging Thy signs, believing
in Thy Book, and holding fast unto Thy Cord.
   I beseech Thee, by the potency of Thy will and
the compelling power of Thy purpose, to make of
what Thou didst reveal unto me in my sleep the


+P 119
surest foundation for the mansions of Thy love
that are within the hearts of Thy loved ones, and
the best instrument for the revelation of the tokens
of Thy grace and Thy loving-kindness.
   Do Thou ordain for me through Thy most exalted
Pen, O my Lord, the good of this world and
of the next.  I testify that within Thy grasp are held
the reins of all things.  Thou changest them as
Thou pleasest.  No God is there save Thee, the
Strong, the Faithful.
   Thou art He Who changeth through His bidding
abasement into glory, and weakness into
strength, and powerlessness into might, and fear
into calm, and doubt into certainty.  No God is
there but Thee, the Mighty, the Beneficent.
   Thou disappointest no one who hath sought
Thee, nor dost Thou keep back from Thee anyone
who hath desired Thee.  Ordain Thou for me
what becometh the heaven of Thy generosity, and
the ocean of Thy bounty.  Thou art, verily, the
Almighty, the Most Powerful.           - &amp;Baha'u'llah

                    PRAISE AND GRATITUDE

   All praise, O my God, be to Thee Who art the
Source of all glory and majesty, of greatness
and honor, of sovereignty and dominion, of
loftiness and grace, of awe and power.  Whomsoever
Thou willest Thou causest to draw nigh unto
the Most Great Ocean, and on whomsoever Thou
desirest Thou conferrest the honor of recognizing
Thy Most Ancient Name.  Of all who are in
heaven and on earth, none can withstand the operation
of Thy sovereign Will.  From all eternity
Thou didst rule the entire creation, and Thou wilt
continue for evermore to exercise Thy dominion
over all created things.  There is none other God
but Thee, the Almighty, The Most Exalted, the
All-Powerful, the All-Wise.
   Illumine, O Lord, the faces of Thy servants,
that they may behold Thee; and cleanse their
hearts that they may turn unto the court of Thy
heavenly favors, and recognize Him Who is the
Manifestation of Thy Self and the Dayspring of


+P 121
Thine Essence.  Verily, Thou art the Lord of all
worlds.  There is no God but Thee, the Unconstrained,
the All-Subduing.                      - &amp;Baha'u'llah


   In the Name of God, the Most High!  Lauded
and glorified art Thou, Lord, God Omnipotent!
Thou before Whose wisdom the wise falleth
short and faileth, before Whose knowledge the
learned confesseth his ignorance, before Whose
might the strong waxeth weak, before Whose
wealth the rich testifieth to his poverty, before
Whose light the enlightened is lost in darkness,
toward the shrine of Whose knowledge turneth
the essence of all understanding and around the
sanctuary of Whose presence circle the souls of all
mankind.
   How then can I sing and tell of Thine Essence,
which the wisdom of the wise and the learning of
the learned have failed to comprehend, inasmuch
as no man can sing that which he understandeth
not, nor recount that unto which he cannot attain,
whilst thou hast been from everlasting the Inaccessible,
the Unsearchable.  Powerless though I
be to rise to the heavens of Thy glory and soar in


+P 122
the realms of Thy knowledge, I can but recount
Thy tokens that tell of Thy glorious handiwork.
   By Thy Glory!  O Beloved of all hearts, Thou
that alone canst still the pangs of yearning for
Thee!  Though all the dwellers of heaven and earth
unite to glorify the least of Thy signs, wherein
and whereby Thou hast revealed Thyself, yet
would they fail, how much more to praise Thy
holy Word, the creator of all Thy tokens.
   All praise and gory be to Thee, Thou of Whom
all things have testified that Thou art one and there
is none other God but thee, Who hast been from
everlasting exalted above all peer or likeness and
to everlasting shalt remain the same.  All kings are
but Thy servants and all beings, visible and invisible,
as naught before Thee.  There is none other
God but Thee, the Gracious, the Powerful, the
Most High.                             - &amp;Baha'u'llah


   Magnified be Thy name, O Lord my God!
Thou art He Whom all things worship
and Who worshipeth no one, Who is the Lord of
all things and is the vassal of none, Who knoweth
all things and is known of none.  Thou didst wish


+P 123
to make Thyself known unto men; therefore,
Thou didst, through a word of Thy mouth, bring
creation into being and fashion the universe.
There is none other God except Thee, the Fashioner,
the Creator, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.
   I implore Thee, by this very work that hath
shone forth above the horizon of Thy will, to enable
me to drink deep of the living waters of Thy chosen
ones and quickened the souls of them that love
Thee, that I may, at all times and under all conditions,
turn my face wholly towards Thee.
   Thou art the God of power, or glory and bounty.
No God is there beside Thee, the Supreme
Ruler, the All-Glorious, the Omniscient.
                                       - &amp;Baha'u'llah


   Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God!  I yield
Thee thanks for having enabled me to
recognize the Manifestation of Thyself, and for
having severed me from Thine enemies, and laid
bare before mine eyes their misdeeds and wicked
works in Thy days, and for having rid me of all


+P 124
attachment to them, and caused me to turn wholly
towards Thy grace and bountiful favors.  I give
Thee thanks, also, for having sent down upon me
from the clouds of Thy will that which hath so
sanctified me from the hints of the infidels and the
allusions of the misbelievers that I have fixed my
heart firmly on Thee, and fled from such as have
denied the light of Thy countenance.  Again I thank
Thee for having empowered me to be steadfast in
Thy love, and to speak forth Thy praise and to
extol Thy virtues, and for having given me to
drink of the cup of Thy mercy that hath surpassed
all things visible and invisible.
   Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the
All-Glorious, the All- Loving.         - &amp;Baha'u'llah


   Praised be Thou, O Lord my God!  Every time
I attempt to make mention of Thee, I am
hindered by the sublimity of Thy station and the
overpowering greatness of Thy might.  For were
I to praise Thee throughout the length of Thy
dominion and the duration of Thy sovereignty, I
would find that my praise of Thee can befit only


+P 125
such as are like unto me, who are themselves Thy
creatures, and who have been generated through
the power of Thy decree and been fashioned
through the potency of Thy will.  And at whatever
time my pen ascribeth glory to any one of Thy
names, methinks I can hear the voice of its lamentation
in its remoteness from Thee, and can recognize
its cry because of its separation from Thy
Self.  I testify that everything other than Thee is
but Thy creation and is held in the hollow of Thy
hand.  To have accepted any act or praise from Thy
creatures is but an evidence of the wonders of Thy
grace and bountiful favors, and a manifestation of
Thy generosity and providence.
   I entreat Thee, O my Lord, by Thy Most Great
Name whereby Thou didst separate light from
fire, and truth from denial, to send down upon
me and upon such of my loved ones as are in my
company the good of this world and of the next.
Supply us, then, with Thy wondrous gifts that
are hid from the eyes of men.  Thou art, verily, the
Fashioner of all creation.  No God is there but
Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Most
High.                                  - &amp;Baha'u'llah


+P 126
   All majesty and glory, O my God, and all dominion
and light and grandeur and splendor
be unto Thee.  Thou bestowest sovereignty
on whom Thou willest and dost withhold it from
whom Thou desirest.  No God is there but Thee,
the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted.  Thou art
He Who createth from naught the universe and all
that dwell therein.  There is nothing worthy of
Thee except Thyself, while all else but Thee are as
outcasts in Thy holy presence and are as nothing
when compared to the glory of Thine Own Being.
   Far be it from me to extol Thy virtues save by
what Thou hast extolled Thyself in Thy weighty
Book where Thou sayest, "No vision taketh in
Him, but He taketh in all vision.  He is the Subtile,
the All-Perceiving."1  Glory be unto Thee, O my
God, indeed no mind or vision, however keen or
discriminating, can ever grasp the nature of the
most insignificant of Thy signs.  Verily, Thou art
God, no God is there besides Thee.  I bear witness
that Thou Thyself alone art the sole expression of
Thine attributes, that the praise of no one besides
Thee can ever attain to Thy holy court nor can

+P 127
Thine attributes ever be fathomed by anyone
other than Thyself.
   Glory be unto Thee, Thou art exalted above the
description of anyone save Thyself, since it is beyond
human conception to befittingly magnify
Thy virtues or to comprehend the inmost reality
of Thine Essence.  Far be it from Thy glory that
Thy creatures should describe Thee or that anyone
besides Thyself should ever know Thee.  I
have known Thee, O my God, by reason of Thy
making Thyself known unto me, for hadst Thou
not revealed Thyself unto me, I would not have
known Thee.  I worship Thee by virtue of Thy
summoning me unto Thee, for had it not been for
Thy summons I would not have worship Thee.

                         PROTECTION

   Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God!  Thou seest
and knowest that I have called upon Thy
servants to turn nowhere except in the direction
of Thy bestowals, and have bidden them observe
naught save the things Thou didst prescribe in
Thy Perspicuous Book, the Book which hath
been sent down according to Thine inscrutable
decree and irrevocable purpose.
   I can utter no word, O my God, unless I be
permitted by Thee, and can move in no direction
until I obtain Thy sanction.  It is Thou, O my God,
Who hast called me into being through the power
of Thy might, and hast endured me with Thy grace
to manifest Thy Cause.  Wherefore I have been
subjected to such adversities that my tongue hath
been hindered from extolling Thee and from
magnifying Thy glory.
   All praise be to Thee, O my God, for the things
Thou didst ordain for me through Thy decree
and by the power of Thy sovereignty.  I beseech


+P 129
Thee that thou wilt fortify both myself and them
that love me in our love for Thee, and wilt keep us
firm in Thy Cause.  I swear by Thy might!  O my
God!  Thy servant's shame is to be shut out as by a
veil from Thee, and his glory is to know Thee.
Armed with the power of Thy name nothing can
ever hurt me, and with Thy love in my heart all
the world's afflictions can in no wise alarm me.
   Send down, therefore, O my Lord, upon me
and upon my loved ones that which will protect
us from the mischief of those that have repudiated
Thy truth and disbelieved in Thy signs.
   Thou art, verily, the All-Glorious, the Most
Bountiful.                             - &amp;Baha'u'llah


   Praised be Thou, O Lord my God!  This is Thy
servant who hath quaffed from the hands
of Thy grace the wine of Thy tender mercy, and
tasted of the savor of Thy love in Thy days.  I beseech
Thee, by the embodiments of Thy names
whom no grief can hinder from rejoicing in Thy
love or from gazing on Thy face, and whom all
the hosts of the heedless are powerless to cause to
turn aside from the path of Thy pleasure, to supply


+P 130
him with the good things Thou dost possess,
and to raise him up to such heights that he will regard
the world even as a shadow that vanisheth
swifter than the twinkling of an eye.
   Keep him safe also, O my God, by the power
of Thine immeasurable majesty, from all that
Thou abhorrest.  Thou art, verily, his Lord and the
Lord of all worlds.                    - &amp;Baha'u'llah


   Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God!  I entreat
Thee by Thy Name through which the
Hour hath struck, and the Resurrection came to
pass, and fear and trembling seized all that are in
heaven and all that are on earth, to rain down, out
of the heaven of Thy mercy and the clouds of Thy
tender compassion, what will gladden the hearts
of Thy servants, who have turned towards Thee
and helped Thy Cause.
   Keep safe Thy servants and Thy handmaidens,
O my Lord, from the darts of idle fancy and vain
imaginings, and give them from the hands of thy
grace a draught of the soft-flowing waters of Thy
knowledge.

   O God, my God!  I have set out from my
home, holding fast unto the cord of Thy
love, and I have committed myself wholly to Thy
care and Thy protection.  I entreat Thee by Thy
power through which Thou didst protect Thy
loved ones from the wayward and the perverse,
and from every contumacious oppressor, and
every wicked doer who hath strayed far from
Thee, to keep me safe by Thy bounty and thy
grace.  Enable me, then, to return to my home by
Thy power and Thy might.  Thou art, truly, the
Almighty, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

holdest the determined measures of all things.

Thine omniscience perceiveth, inasmuch as there

is forthcoming save from Thy presence, and it
is Thine alone to command.  Whatever God hath
willed hath been, and that which He hath not
willed shall not be.

that have turned with devotion to Thy
Holy Face, that have detached ourselves from all
besides Thee in this glorious Day.  We have gathered
in this Spiritual Assembly, united in our
views and thoughts, with our purposes harmonized
to exalt Thy Word amidst mankind.  O Lord,

the Standards of Thine exalted Faith amongst
men, servants to Thy mighty Covenant, O Thou
our Lord Most High, manifestations of Thy Divine
Unity in Thine &amp;Abha Kingdom, and resplendent
stars shining upon all regions.  Lord!  Aid

Drops though we be, still do we draw from out
Thy ocean deeps.  Motes though we be, still do
we gleam in the glory of Thy splendid Sun.

that each one gathered here may become a lighted

that Thy wondrous voice may reach my ear, that
my eyes may behold Thy signs and Thy light as

   Thou seest, O Lord my God, the tears of Thy
favored ones, shed because of their separation
from Thee, and the fears of Thy devoted ones in
their remoteness from Thy Holy Court.  By Thy
power, that swayeth all things, visible and invisible!
It behooveth Thy loved ones to shed tears of
blood for that which hath befallen the faithful at
the hands of the wicked and the oppressors on the

have compassed Thy cities and Thy realms!

favor, to ordain for Thy saints that which shall
solace their eyes and comfort their hearts.  Lord!
Thou seest him that kneeleth yearning to arise and
serve Thee, the dead calling for eternal life from
the ocean of Thy favor and craving to soar to the
heavens of Thy wealth, the stranger longing for
his home of glory `neath the canopy of Thy grace,
the seeker hastening by Thy mercy to Thy door

and pardon.
   By Thy sovereignty, O Thou Who art glorified
in the hearts of men!  I have turned to Thee,
forsaking mine own will and desire, that Thy holy
will and pleasure may rule within me and direct
me according to that which the pen of Thy eternal
decree hath destined for me.  This servant, O
Lord, though helpless turneth to the Orb of Thy

Thy name whereby the goodly pearls of Thy wisdom
and Thine utterance were brought forth out
of the treasuries of the hearts of such of Thy servants
as are nigh unto Thee, and through which
the Daystar of Thy name, the Compassionate,
hath shed its radiance upon all that are in Thy
heaven and on Thy earth, to supply me, by Thy
grace and bounty, with Thy wondrous and hidden
bounties.
   These are the earliest days of my life, O my
God, which Thou hast linked with Thine own
days.  Now that Thou hast conferred upon me so
great an honor, withhold not from me the things
Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones.


+P 150
   I am, O my God, but a tiny seed which Thou
hast sown in the soil of Thy love, and caused to
spring forth by the hand of Thy bounty.  This seed
craveth, therefore, in its inmost being, for the
waters of Thy mercy and the living fountain of
Thy grace.  Send down upon it, from the heaven
of Thy loving-kindness, that which will enable it
to flourish beneath Thy shadow and within the
borders of Thy court.  Thou art He Who watereth
the hearts of all that have recognized Thee from
Thy plenteous stream and the fountain of Thy living

down upon me, as a token of Thy grace, Thy vitalizing
breezes, throughout the daytime and in
the night season, O Lord of bounty.


+P 151
   No deed have I done, O my God, to merit beholding
Thy face, and I know of a certainty that
were I to live as long as the world lasts I would fail
to accomplish any deed such as to deserve this
favor, inasmuch as the station of a servant shall
ever fall short of access to Thy holy precincts, unless
Thy bounty should reach me and Thy tender
mercy pervade me and Thy loving-kindness encompass
me.
   All praise be unto Thee, O Thou besides Whom
there is none other God.  Graciously enable me to
ascend unto Thee, to be granted the honor of
dwelling in Thy nearness and to have communion
with Thee alone.  No God is there but Thee.
   Indeed shouldst Thou desire to confer blessing
upon a servant Thou wouldst blot out from the
realm of his heart every mention or disposition
except Thine Own mention; and shouldst Thou
ordain evil for a servant by reason of that which
his hands have unjustly wrought before Thy face,
Thou wouldst test him with the benefits of this
world and of the next that he might become preoccupied
therewith and forget Thy remembrance.

   O God!  Refresh and gladden my spirit.  Purify
my heart.  Illumine my powers.  I lay all
my affairs in Thy hand.  Thou art my Guide and
my Refuge.  I will no longer be sorrowful and
grieved; I will be a happy and joyful being.  O
God!  I will no longer be full of anxiety, nor will I
let trouble harass me.  I will not dwell on the unpleasant
things of life.
   O God!  Thou art more friend to me than I am
to myself.  I dedicate myself to Thee, O Lord.

and the service of Thy friends and maidservants.
   O Lord, help me to be meek and lowly, and
strengthen me in severing myself from all things
and in holding to the hem of the garment of Thy

love and leave no space for love of the world and
attachment to its qualities.

   O God, my God!  This is thy radiant servant

called out in Thy name among the nations, and led
the people to the streaming waters of Thy mercy,

He hath given to drink from the cup of guidance
that brimmeth over with the wine of Thy measureless

borne witness to Thy oneness through which the
Sun hath been made to shine in midday splendor.
They have listened to the summons Thou didst
raise from out Thy hidden Realm, and with hearts

to Thy call.

   O God, my God!  These are servants attracted
in Thy days by the fragrances of Thy holiness,
enkindled with the flame burning in Thy
holy tree, responding to Thy voice, uttering Thy
praise, awakened by Thy breeze, stirred by Thy
sweet savors, beholding Thy signs, understanding
Thy Revelation and assured of Thy loving-kindness.
Their eyes, O Lord, are fixed upon Thy


+P 157
kingdom of effulgent glory and their faces turned
toward Thy dominion on high, their hearts beating
with the love of Thy radiant and glorious
beauty, their souls consumed with the flame of
Thy love, O Lord of this world and the world
hereafter, their lives seething with the ardor of
their longing for Thee, and their tears poured forth
for Thy sake.
   Shield them within the stronghold of Thy protection
and safety, preserve them in Thy watchful
care, look upon them with the eyes of Thy
providence and mercy, make them the signs of
Thy divine unity that are manifest throughout all
regions, the standards of Thy might that wave
above Thy mansions of grandeur, the shining
lamps that burn with the oil of Thy wisdom in
the globes of Thy guidance, the birds of the garden
of Thy knowledge that warble upon the topmost
boughs in Thy sheltering paradise, and the
leviathans of the ocean of Thy bounty that plunge
by Thy supreme mercy in the fathomless deeps.
   O Lord, my God!  Lowly are these servants of
Thine, exalt them in Thy kingdom on high; feeble,
strengthen them by Thy supreme power;
abased, bestow upon them Thy glory in Thine all-highest

dominion.  Do Thou then ordain for them all the
good Thou hast destined in Thy worlds, visible
and invisible, prosper them in this world below,
gladden their hearts with Thine inspiration, O
Lord of all beings!  Illumine their hearts with Thy
joyful tidings diffused from Thine all-glorious
Station, make firm their steps in Thy Most-Great
Covenant and strengthen their loins in Thy firm
Testament, by Thy bounty and promised grace,
O Gracious and Merciful One!  Thou art, verily,

the friends in the West the sweet fragrance
of the Holy Spirit, and with the light of divine
guidance Thou hast lit up the western sky.  Thou
hast made those who were once remote to draw
near unto Thyself; Thou hast turned strangers into
loving friends; Thou hast awakened those who
slept; Thou hast made the heedless mindful.
   O Thou Provider!  Assist Thou these noble
friends to win Thy good pleasure, and make


+P 159
them well wishers of stranger and friend alike.
Bring them into the world that abideth forever;
grant them a portion of heavenly grace; cause
them to be true &amp;Baha'is, sincerely of God; save
them from outward semblances, and establish
them firmly in the truth.  Make them signs and
tokens of the Kingdom, luminous stars above the
horizons of this nether life.  Make them to be a
comfort and a solace to humankind and servants
to the peace of the world.  Exhilarate them with
the wine of Thy counsel, and grant that all of
them may tread the path of Thy commandments.
   O Thou Provider!  The dearest wish of this servant
of Thy Threshold is to behold the friends of
East and West in close embrace; to see all the
members of human society gathered with love in
a single great assemblage, even as individual drops
of water collected in one mighty sea; to behold
them all as birds in one garden of roses, as peals of
one ocean, as leaves of one tree, as rays of one sun.
   Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, and Thou
art the God of strength, the Omnipotent, the All-Seeing.

Thee by Thy power that hath

that hath transcended the entire creation,
and by Thy Word which was hidden in Thy wisdom
and whereby Thou didst create Thy heaven

any of Thy creatures, and wilt remain as Thou
hast been for ever and ever.
   In Thee I have placed my whole confidence,

Thy loving providence I have clung, and towards

Whose service is my highest aspiration!  I beseech
Thee by Thy Name, through which Thou hast
enabled them that have recognized Thee to soar
to the sublimest heights of the knowledge of Thee
and empowered such as devoutly worship Thee
to ascend into the precincts of the court of Thy
holy favors, to aid me to turn my face towards
Thy face, to fix mine eyes upon Thee, and to speak
of Thy glory.

court.  Behold me, then, with mine eyes lifted up
towards the Seat that shineth with the splendors
of the light of Thy Face.  Send down, then, upon

Help them to spread, amongst all the nations of

   Thou seest me, O my God, bowed down in
lowliness, humbling myself before Thy
commandments, submitting to Thy sovereignty,
trembling at the might of Thy dominion, fleeing
from Thy wrath, entreating Thy grace, relying
upon Thy forgiveness, shaking with awe at Thy
fury.  I implore Thee with a throbbing heart, with
streaming tears and a yearning soul, and in complete
detachment from all things, to make Thy
lovers as rays of light across Thy realms, and to
aid Thy chosen servants to exalt Thy Word, that
their faces may turn beauteous and bright with
splendor, that their hearts may be filled with
mysteries, and that every soul may lay down its
burden of sin.  Guard them then from the aggressor,
from him who hath become a shameless and
blasphemous doer of wrong.
   Verily, Thy lovers thirst, O my Lord; lead them


+P 176
to the wellspring of bounty and grace.  Verily,
they hunger; send down unto them Thy heavenly
table.  Verily, they are naked; robe them in the garments
of learning and knowledge.
   Heroes are the, O my Lord, lead them to the
field of battle.  Guides are they, make them to
speak out with arguments and proofs.  Ministering
servants are they, cause them to pass round
the cup that brimmeth with the wine of certitude.
O my God, make them to be songsters that carol
in fair gardens, make them lions that couch in the
thickets, whales that plunge in the vasty deep.
   Verily, Thou art He of abounding grace.  There
is none other God save Thee, the Mighty, the
Powerful, the Ever-Bestowing.

   O God, my God!  Thou seest me enraptured
and attracted toward Thy glorious kingdom,
enkindled with the fire of Thy love amongst
mankind, a herald of Thy kingdom in these vast
and spacious lands, severed from aught else save
Thee, relying on Thee, abandoning rest and comfort,
remote from my native home, a wanderer in
these regions, a stranger fallen upon the ground,
humble before Thine exalted Threshold, submissive
toward the heaven of Thine omnipotent
glory, supplicating Thee in the dead of night and
at the break of dawn, entreating and invoking
Thee at morn and at eventide to graciously aid me
to serve Thy Cause, to spread abroad Thy Teachings
and to exalt Thy Word throughout the East
and the West.
   O Lord!  Strengthen my back, enable me to
serve Thee with the utmost endeavor, and leave


+P 179
me not to myself, lonely and helpless in these regions.
   O Lord!  Grant me communion with Thee in
my loneliness, and be my companion in these
foreign lands.
   Verily, Thou art the Confirmer of whomsoever
Thou willest in that which Thou desirest,
and, verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent.

   O God!  O God!  Thou seest my weakness,
lowliness and humility before Thy creatures;
nevertheless, I have trusted in Thee and
have arisen in the promotion of Thy teachings
among Thy strong servants, relying on Thy
power and might.
   O Lord!  I am a broken-winged bird and desire
to soar in Thy limitless space.  How is it possible


+P 180
for me to do this save through Thy providence
and grace, Thy confirmation and assistance.
   O Lord!  Have pity on my weakness, and
strengthen me with Thy power.  O Lord!  Have
pity on my impotence, and assist me with Thy
might and majesty.
   O Lord!  Should the breath of the Holy Spirit
confirm the weakest of creatures, he would attain
all to which he aspireth and would possess anything
he desireth.  Indeed, Thou hast assisted Thy
servants in the past and, though they were the
weakest of Thy creatures, the lowliest of Thy servants
and the most insignificant of those who
lived upon the earth, through Thy sanction and
potency they took precedence over the most glorious
of Thy people and the most noble of mankind.
Whereas formerly they were as moths, they
became as royal falcons, and whereas before they
were as brooks, they became as seas, through
Thy bestowal and Thy mercy.  They became,
through Thy most great favor, stars shining on
the horizon of guidance, birds singing in the rose
gardens of immortality, lions roaring in the forests
of knowledge and wisdom, and whales swimming
in the oceans of life.

   O God, my God!  Thou seest how black darkness
is enshrouding all regions, how all
countries are burning with the flame of dissension,
and the fire of war and carnage is blazing
throughout the East and the West.  Blood is flowing,
corpses bestrew the ground, and severed
heads are fallen on the dust of the battlefield.
   O Lord!  Have pity on these ignorant ones, and
look upon them with the eye of forgiveness and
pardon.  Extinguish this fire, so that these dense
clouds which obscure the horizon may be scattered,
the Sun of Reality shine forth with the rays
of conciliation, this intense gloom be dispelled
and the resplendent light of peace shed its radiance
upon all countries.
   O Lord!  Draw up the people from the abyss of
the ocean of hatred and enmity, and deliver them


+P 182
from the impenetrable darkness.  Unite their
hearts, and brighten their eyes with the light of
peace and reconciliation.  Deliver them from the
depths of war and bloodshed, and free them from
the darkness of error.  Remove the veil from their
eyes, and enlighten their hearts with the light of
guidance.  Treat them with Thy tender mercy and
compassion, and deal not with them according to
Thy justice and wrath which cause the limbs of
the mighty to quake.
   O Lord!  Wars have persisted.  Distress and anxiety
have waxed great, and every flourishing region
is laid waste.
   O Lord!  Hearts are heavy, and souls are in anguish.
Have mercy on these poor souls, and do
not leave them to the excesses of their own desires.
   O Lord!  Make manifest in Thy lands humble
and submissive souls, their faces illumined with
the rays of guidance, severed from the world, extolling
Thy Name, uttering Thy praise, and diffusing
the fragrance of Thy holiness amongst
mankind.
   O Lord!  Strengthen their backs, gird up their


+P 183
loins, and enrapture their hearts with the most
mighty signs of Thy love.
   O Lord!  Verily, they are weak, and Thou art
the Powerful and the Mighty; they are impotent,
and Thou art the Helper and the Merciful.
   O Lord!  The ocean of rebellion is surging, and
these tempests will not be stilled save through
Thy boundless grace which hath embraced all regions.
   O Lord!  Verily, the people are in the abyss of
passion, and naught can save them but Thine infinite
bounties.
   O Lord!  Dispel the darkness of these corrupt
desires, and illumine the hearts with the lamp of
Thy love through which all countries will erelong
be enlightened.  Confirm, moreover, Thy
loved ones, those who, leaving their homelands,
their families and their children, have, for the
love of Thy Beauty, traveled to foreign countries
to diffuse Thy fragrances and promulgate Thy
Teachings.  Be Thou their companion in their
loneliness, their helper in a strange land, the remover
of their sorrows, their comforter in calamity.
Be Thou a refreshing draught for their thirst,

a healing medicine for their ills and a balm for the
burning ardor of their hearts.

   O Thou kind Lord!  Praise be unto Thee that
Thou hast shown us the highway of guidance,
opened the doors of the kingdom and manifested
Thyself through the Sun of Reality.  To the
blind Thou hast given sight; to the deaf Thou hast
granted hearing; Thou hast resuscitated the dead;
Thou hast enriched the poor; Thou hast shown the
way to those who have gone astray; Thou hast
led those with parched lips to the fountain of guidance;


+P 185
Thou hast suffered the thirsty fish to reach
the ocean of reality; and Thou hast invited the
wandering birds to the rose garden of grace.
   O Thou Almighty  We are Thy servants and
Thy poor ones; we are remote and yearn for Thy
presence, are athirst for the water of Thy fountain,
are ill, longing for Thy healing.  We are walking in
Thy path and have no aim or hope save the diffusion
of Thy fragrance, so that all souls may raise
the cry of "O God, guide us to the straight path."
May their eyes be opened to behold the light, and
may they be freed from the darkness of ignorance.
May they gather around the lamp of Thy guidance.
May every portionless one receive a share.
May the deprived become the confidants of Thy
mysteries.
   O Almighty!  Look upon us with the glance of
mercifulness.  Grant us heavenly confirmation.
Bestow upon us the breath of the HOly Spirit, so
that we may be assisted in Thy service and, like
unto brilliant stars, shine in these regions with the

I implore Thee, by Thy divine sweetness and by
the splendors of the glory of Thy face, to send
down uponus from Thy retreats on high that
which will enable us to draw nigh unto Thee.  Set,
then, our feet firm, O my God, in Thy Cause, and

   Glory be Thee, O my God!  But for the tribulations
which are sustained in Thy path,
how could Thy true lovers be recognized; and


+P 192
were it not for the trials which are borne for love
of Thee, how could the station of such as yearn for
Thee be revealed?  Thy might beareth me witness!
The companions of all who adore Thee are the
tears they shed, and the comforters of such as seek
Thee are the groans they utter, and the food of
them who haste to meet Thee is the fragments of
their broken hearts.
   How sweet to my taste is the bitterness of death
suffered in Thy path, and how precious in my estimation
are the shafts of Thine enemies when encountered
for the sake of the exaltation of Thy
word!  Let me quaff in Thy Cause, O my God,
whatsoever Thou didst desire, and send down
upon me in Thy love all Thou didst ordain.  By
Thy glory!  I wish only what Thou wishest, and
cherish what Thou cherishest.  In Thee have I, at
all times, placed my whole trust and confidence.
   Raise up, I implore Thee, O my God, as helpers
to this Revelation such as shall be counted
worthy of Thy name and of Thy sovereignty, that
they may remember me among Thy cretures,
and hoist the ensigns of Thy victory in Thy land.
   Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee.  No

and Thy dominion, and every discerning eye
perceiveth the greatness of Thy majesty and the
compelling power of Thy might.  The winds of
tests are powerless to hold back them that enjoy
near access to Thee from setting their faces towards
the horizon of Thy glory, and the tempests
of trials must fail to draw away and hinder such as
are wholly devoted to Thy will from approaching
Thy court.
   Methinks, the lamp of Thy love is burning in
their hearts, and the light of Thy tenderness is lit
within their breasts.  Adversities are incapable of
estranging them from Thy Cause, and the vicissitudes
of fortune can never cause them to stray
from Thy pleasure.
   I beseech Thee, O my God, by them and by the
sighs which their hearts utter in their separation
from Thee, to keep them safe from the mischief of


+P 194
Thine adversaries, and to nourish their souls with
what Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones on
whom shall come no fear and who shall not be put

   Thou knowest full well, O my God, that tribulations
have showered upon me from all
directions and that no one can dispel or transmute

of my love for Thee, that Thou wilt never
cause tribulations to befall any soul unless Thou
desirest to exalt his station in Thy earthly life
with the bulwark of Thine all-compelling power,
that it may not become inclined toward the vanities
of this world.  Indeed Thou art well aware
that under all conditions I would cherish the remembrance
of Thee far more than the ownership
of all that is in the heavens and on the earth.
   Strengthen my heart, O my God, in Thine
obedience and in Thy love, and grant that I may be
clear of the entire company of Thine adversaries.
Verily, I swear by Thy glory that I yearn for
naught besides Thyself, nor do I desire anything


+P 195
except Thy mercy, nor am I apprehensive of
aught save Thy justice.  I beg Thee to forgive me
as well as those whom Thou lovest, howsoever
Thou pleasest.  Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the
Bountiful.
   Immensely exalted art Thou, O Lord of the
heavens and earth, above the praise of all men,
and may peace be upon Thy faithful servants and
glory be unto God, the Lord of all the worlds.

   Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God!  Darness
hath fallen upon every land, and the
forces of mischief have encompassed all the nations.
Through them, however, I perceive the
splendors of Thy wisdom, and discern the brightness
of the light of Thy providence.
   They that are shut out as by a veil from Thee
have imagined that they have the power to put
out Thy light, and to quench Thy fire, and to still
the winds of Thy grace.  Nay, and to this Thy
might beareth me witness!  Had not every tribulation
been made the bearer of Thy wisdom, and
every ordeal the vehicle of Thy providence, no
one would have dared oppose us, though the
powers of earth and heaven were to be leagued
against us.  Were I to unravel the wondrous mysteries
of Thy wisdom which are laid bare before
me, the reins of Thine enemies would be cleft
asunder.
   Glorified be Thou, then, O my God!  I beseech

Thee by thy Most Great Name to assemble them
that love Thee around the Law that streameth

servants, and cause them to prevail over all the
peoples of the world; for they, of a truth, are thy
servants who have detached themselves from
aught else but Thee, and Thou, verily, art the protector

   Grant Thou, O Lord, that their hearts may,
through allegiance to this, thine inviolable Faith,
grow stronger than anything else in the heavens

and strengthen, O Lord, their hands with the

Tree of Thy divine Unity; water it then,
O Lord, with the flowing waters of Thy good-pleasure,
and cause it, before the revelations of
Thy divine assurance, to yield such fruits as Thou
desirest for thy glorification and exaltation, thy
praise and thanksgiving, and to magnify thy
Name, to alud the oneness of Thine Essence and
to offer adoration unto Thee, inasmuch as all this
lieth within Thy grasp and in that of none other.

   O Lord!  Render victorious Thy forbearing
servants in Thy days by granting them a
befitting victory, inasmuch as they have sought
martyrdom in Thy path.  Send down upon them
that which will bring comfort to their minds, will
rejoice their inner beings, will impart assurance
to their hearts and tranquillity to their bodies and
will enable their souls to ascend to the presence of
God, the Most Exalted, and to attain the supreme
Paradise and such retreats of glory as Thou hast
destined for men of true knowledge and virtue.
Verily, Thou knowest all things, while we are but
Thy servants, Thy thralls, Thy bondsmen and
Thy poor ones.  No Lord but Thee do we invoke,
O God our Lord, nor do we implore blessings or
grace from anyone but Thee, O Thou Who art the
God of mercy unto this world and the next.  We
are but the embodiments of poverty, of nothingness,
of helplessness and of perdition, while Thy

whole Being betokeneth wealth, independence,
glory, majesty and boundless grace.
   Turn our reompense, O Lord, into that which
well beseemeth Thee of the good of this world and
of the next, and of the manifold bounties which
extend from on high down to the earth below.
   Verily, Thou art our Lord and the Lord of all
things.  Into Thy hands do we surrender ouselves,

Tree which is"neither of the East nor of the West,"
that fire which blazed out till the flame of it soared
upward to the Concourse on high, and from it

cried out:  "Verily have we perceived a fire on the
slope of Mount Sinai."
   O God, my God!  Increase Thou this fire, as day

to life those who dwell in their tombs, warn Thou
the prideful, make happiness worldwide, send
down Thy crystal waters, and in the assemblage

   O Lord, my God, my Well-Beloved!
These are servants of Thine that have heard Thy
Voice, given ear to Thy Word and hearkened to
Thy Call.  They have believed in Thee, witnessed
Thy wonders, acknowledged thy proof and testified
to Thine evidence.  They have walked in Thy
ways, followed Thy guidance, discovered Thy
mysteries, comprehended the secrets of Thy
Book, the verses of Thy Scrolls and the tidings of
Thy Epistles and Tablets.  They have clung to the
hem of Thy garment and held fast unto the robe of
Thy light and grandeur.  Their footsteps have been
directions and that no one can dispel or transmute
made firm in Thy Testament.  Lord!  Do Thou kindle
in their hearts the flame of Thy divine attraction
and grant that the bird of love and understanding
may sing within their hearts.  Grant that
they may be even as potent signs, resplendent
standards, and perfect as Thy Word.  Exalt by
them thy Cause, unfurl Thy banners and publish
far and wide the wonders.  Make by them Thy
Word triumphant, and strengthen the loins of Thy
loved ones.  Unloose their tongues to laud Thy
Name, and inspire them to do Thy holy will and

pleasure.  Illumine their faces in Thy Kingdom of
holiness, and perfect their joy by aiding them to
arise for the triumph of Thy Cause.
   Lord!  Feeble are we, strengthen us to diffuse the
fragrances of Thy Holiness; poor, enrich us from
the treasures of Thy Divine Unity; naked, clothe
us with the robe of Thy bounty; sinful, forgive us
our sins by Thy grace, Thy favor and Thy pardon.
Thou art, verily, the Aider, the Helper, the Gracious,

"These daily obligatory prayers, together with a few
other specific ones, such as the Healing Prayer, the Tablet
of &amp;Ahmad, have been invested by &amp;Baha'u'llah with
a special potency and significance, and should therefore
be accepted as such and be recited by the believers with
unquestioning faith and confidence, that through them
they may enter into a much closer communion with
God, and identify themselves more fully with His laws
and precepts." - From a letter written on behalf of

   He is the King, the All-Knowing, the Wise!
Lo, the Nightingale of Paradise singeth
upon the twigs of the Trees of Eternity, with holy
and sweet melodies, proclaiming to the sincere
ones the glad tidings of the nearness of God, calling
the believers in the Divine Unity to the court
of the Presence of the Generous One, informing
the severed ones of the message which hath been


+P 210
revealed by God, the King, the Glorious, the Peerless,
guiding the lovers to the seat of sanctity and
to this resplendent Beauty.
   Verily this is that Most Great Beauty, foretold
in the Books of the Messengers, through Whom
truth shall be distinguished from error and the
wisdom of every command shall be tested.  Verily
He is the Tree of Life that bringeth forth the fruits
of God, the Exalted, the Powerful, the Great.
   O &amp;Ahmad!  Bear thou witness that verily He is
God and there is no God but Him, the King, the
Protector, the Incomparable, the Omnipotent.
And that the One Whom He hath sent forth by the
name of &amp;Ali1 was the true One from God, to
Whose commands we are all conforming.
   Say:  O people be obedient to the ordinances of
God, which have been enjoined in the &amp;Bayan by
the Glorious, the Wise One.  Verily He is the King
of the Messengers and His book is the Mother
Book did ye but know.
   Thus doth the Nightingale utter His call unto
you from this prison.  He hath but to deliver this

   1. The &amp;Bab


+P 211
clear message.  Whosoever desireth, let him turn
aside from this counsel and whosoever desireth let
him choose the path to his Lord.
   O people, if ye deny these verses, by what
proof have ye believed in God?  Produce it, O assemblage
of false ones.
   Nay, by the One in Whose hand is my soul,
they are not, and never shall be able to do this,
even should they combine to assist one another.
   O &amp;Ahmad!  Forget not My ounties while I am
absent.  Remember My days during thy days, and
My distress and banishment in this remote prison.
And be thou so steadfast in My love that thy heart
shall not waver, even if the swords of the enemies
rain blows upon thee and all the heavens and the
earth arise against thee.
   Be thou as a flame of fire to My enemies and a
river of life eternal to My loved ones, and be not of
those who doubt.
   And if thou art overtaken by affliction in My
path, or degradation for My sake, be not thou
troubled thereby.
   Rely upon God, thy God and the Lord of thy
fathers.  For the people are wandering in the paths


+P 212
of delusion, bereft of discernment to see God with
their own eyes, or hear His Melody with their
own ears.  Thus have We found them, as thou also
dost witness.
   Thus have their superstitions become veils between
them and their own hearts and kept them
fron the path of God, the Exalted, the Great.
   Be thou assured in thyself that verily, he who
turns away from this Beauty hath also turned
away from the Messengers of the past and showeth
pride towards God from all eternity to all eternity.
   Learn well this Tablet, O &amp;Ahmad.  Chant it
during thy days and withhold not thyself therefrom.
For verily, God hath ordained for the one
who chants it, the reward of a hundred martyrs
and a service in both worlds.  These favors have
We bestowed upon thee as a bounty on Our part
and a mercy from Our presence, that thou mayest
be of those who are grateful.
   By God!  Should one who is in affliction or grief
read this Tablet with absolute sincerity, God will
dispel his sadness, solve his difficulties and remove
his afflictions.

Thy Self, or who ponder on what hath befallen
Him in the pathway of Thy love?  Now doth My
pen halt, O Beloved of the worlds?

   Lament not because of the wicked.  Thou wert
created to bear and endure, O Patience of the

   How sweet was Thy dawning on the horizon of
the Covenant among the stirrers of sedition, and
Thy yearning after God, O Love of the worlds.

"Whereupon the ship of fancy standeth still which

And as the radiance of her beauty shone upon the

She then raised the call which no ear through all

"Can in no wise ascend unto the glory of the

Thereupon she summoned unto herself one maiden
from her handmaidens,

"And turn thou unto that which they have concealed
in the inmost of their hearts.

"Shouldst thou inhale the perfume of the robe
from the Youth that hath been hidden within the
tabernacle of light by reason of that which the

illumine the heavens and all that is therein.
   Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!
She bestirred herself and perfumed all things in
the lands of holiness and grandeur.
   Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!
When she reached that place she rose to her full
height in the midmost heart of creation,

And sought to inhale their fragrance at a time that

   Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!
She found not in them that which she did desire,
and this, verily, is but one of His wondrous tales.
   Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!
She then cried aloud, wailed and repaired to her
own station within her most lofty mansion,
   Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!
And then gave utterance to one mystic word,
whispered privily by her honeyed tongue,
   Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!

And raised the call amidst the Celestial Concourse
and the immortal maids of heaven:

"By the Lord!  I found not from these idle claimants
the breeze of Faithfulness!
   Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!
"By the Lord!  The Youth hath remained lone and
forlorn in the land of exile in the hands of the ungodly."
   Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!
She then uttered within herself such a cry that the
Celestial Concourse did shriek and tremble,
   Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!
And she fell upon the dust and gave up the spirit.
It seemeth she was called and hearkened unto
Him that summoned her unto the Realm on
High.
   Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!
Glorified be He that created her out of the essence
of love in the midmost heart of his exalted paradise!
   Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!
Thereupon the maids of heaven hastened forth
from their chambers, upon whose countenances


+P 229
the eye of no dweller in the highest paradise had
ever gazed.
   Glorified be our Lord, the Most High!
They all gathered around her, and lo!  they found
her body fallen upon the dust;
   Glorified be our Lord, the Most High!
And as they beheld her state and comprehended a
word of the tale told by the Youth, they bared
their heads, rent their garments asunder, beat
upon their faces, forgot their joy, shed tears and
smote with their hands upon their cheeks, and
this is verily one of the mysterious grievous
afflictions -
   Glorified be our Lord, the Most High!

                    TABLETS OF VISITATION

(This Tablet is read at the Shrines of &amp;Baha'u'llah and
the &amp;Bab.  It is also frequently used in commemorating
Their anniversaries.)

   The praise which hath dawned from Thy most
august Self, and the glory which hath shone
forth from Thy most effulgent Beauty, rest upon
Thee, O Thou Who art the Manifestation of
Grandeur, and the King of Eternity, and the Lord
of all who are in heaven and on earth!  I testify
that through Thee the sovereignty of God and
His dominion, and the majesty of God and His
grandeur, were revealed, and the Daystars of ancient
splendor have shed their radiance in the heaven
of Thine irrevocable decree, and the Beauty
of the Unseen hath shone forth above the horizon
of creation. I testify, moreover, that with but
a movement of Thy Pen Thine injuction "Be
Thou" hath been enforced, and God's hidden Secret
hath been divulged, and all created things



+P 231
have been called into being, and all the Revelations
have been sent down.
   I bear witness, moreover, that through Thy
beauty the beauty of the Adored One hath been
unveiled, and through Thy face the face of the
Desired One hath shone forth, and that through a
word from Thee Thou hast decided between all
created things, caused them who are devoted to
Thee to ascend unto the summit of glory, and the
infidels to fall into the lowest abyss.
   I bear witness that he who hath known Thee
hath known God, and he who hath attained unto
Thy presence hath attained unto the presence of
God.  Great, therefore, is the blessedness of him
who hath believed in Thee, and in Thy signs, and
hath humbled himself before Thy sovereignty,
and hath been honored with meeting Thee, and
hath attained the good pleasure of Thy will, and
circled around Thee, and stood before Thy throne.
Woe betide him that hath transgressed against
Thee, and hath denied Thee, and repudiated Thy
signs, and gainsaid Thy sovereignty, and risen up
against Thee, and waxed proud before Thy face,
and hath disputed Thy testimonies, and fled from
Thy rule and Thy dominion, and been numbered


+P 232
with the infidels whose names have been inscribed
by the fingers of Thy behest upon Thy holy Tablets.
   Waft, then, unto me, O my God and my Beloved,
from the right hand of Thy mercy and Thy
loving-kindness, the holy breaths of Thy favors,
that they may draw me away from myself and
from the world unto the courts of Thy nearness
and Thy presence.  Potent art Thou to do what
pleaseth Thee.  Thou, truly, hast been supreme
over all things.
   The remembrance of God and His praise, and
the glory of God and His splendor, rest upon
Thee, O Thou Who art His Beauty!  I bear witness
that the eye of creation hath never gazed upon
one wronged like Thee.  Thou wast immersed all
the days of Thy life beneath an ocean of tribulations.
At one time Thou wast in chains and fetters;
at another Thou wast threatened by the sword of
Thine enemies.  Yet despite all this, Thou didst
enjoin upon all men to observe what had been
prescribed unto Thee by Him Who is the All-Knowing,
the All-Wise.
   May my spirit be a sacrifice to the wrongs Thou
didst suffer, and my soul be a ransom for the adversities


+P 233
Thou didst sustain.  I beseech God, by
Thee and by them whose faces have been illumined
with the splendors of the light of Thy countenance,
and who, for love of Thee, have observed
all whereunto they were bidden, to remove the
veils that have come in between Thee and Thy
creatures, and to supply me with the good of this
world and the world to come.  Thou art, in truth,
the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious,
the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.
   Bless Thou, O Lord my Lord, the Divine Lote-Tree
and its leaves, and its boughs, and its
branches, and its stems, and its offshoots, as long
as Thy most excellent titles will endure and Thy
most august attributes will last.  Protect it, then,
from the mischief of the aggressor and the hosts
of tyranny.  Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the
Most Powerful.  Bless Thou, also, O Lord my
God, Thy servants and Thy handmaidens who
have attained unto Thee,  Thou, truly, art the All-Bountiful,
Whose grace is infinite.  No God is
there save Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most
Generous.                              - &amp;Baha'u'llah

(This prayer, revealed by &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, is read at His
Shrine.  It is also used in private prayer.)

   Whoso recitheth this prayer with lowliness and fervor will
   bring gladness and joy to the heart of this Servant; it will
   be even as meeting Him face to face.

   He is the All-Glorious!
   O God, my God!  Lowly and tearful, I raise
my suppliant hands to Thee and cover my face in
the dust of that Threshold of Thine, exalted above
the knowledge of the learned, and the praise of all
that glorify Thee.  Graciously look upon Thy servant,
humble and lowly at Thy door, with the
glances of the eye of Thy mercy, and immerse him
in the Ocean of Thine eternal grace.
   Lord!  He is a poor and lowly servant of Thine,
enthralled and imploring Thee, captive in Thy
hand, praying fervently to Thee, trusting in Thee,
in tears before Thy face, calling to Thee and beseeching
Thee, saying:
   O Lord, my God!  Give me Thy grace to serve
Thy loved ones, strenghten me in my servitude
to Thee, illumine my brow with the light of adoration
in Thy court of holiness, and of prayer to



+P 235
Thy kingdom of grandeur.  Help me to be selfless
at the heavenly entrance of Thy gate, and aid me
to be detached from all things within Thy holy
precincts.  Lord!  Give me to drink from the chalice
of selflessness; with its robe clothe me, and in its
ocean immerse me.  Make me as dust in the pathway
of Thy loved ones, and grant that I may offer
up my soul for the earth ennobled by the footsteps
of Thy chosen ones in Thy path, O Lord of Glory
in the Highest.
   With this prayer doth Thy servant call Thee, at
dawntide and in the night-season.  Fulfill his heart's
desire, O Lord!  Illumine his heart, gladden his
bosom, kindle his light, that he may serve Thy
Cause and Thy-servants.
   Thou art the Bestower, the Pitiful, the Most
Bountiful, the Gracious, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

                      INTERCALARY DAYS

(The Intercalary Days, February 26 to March 1, inclusive,
should be days of preparation for the Fast, days
of hospitality, charity and the giving of present.)

   My God, my Fire and my Light!  The days
which Thou hast named the &amp;Ayyam-i-Ha1
in Thy Book have begun, O Thou Who art
the King of names, and the fast which Thy most
exalted Pen hath enjoined unto all who are in the
kingdom of Thy creation to observe is approaching.
I entreat Thee, O my Lord, by these days and
by all such as have during that period clung to the
cord of Thy commandments, and laid hold on
the handle of Thy precepts, to grant that unto
every soul may be assigned a place within the precincts
of Thy court, and a seat at the revelation of
the splendors of the light of Thy countenance.
   These, O my Lord, are Thy servants whom no

   1. The Days of &amp;Ha, Intercalary Days.


+P 237
corrupt inclination hath kept back from what
Thou didst send down in Thy Book.  They have
bowed themselves before Thy Cause, and received
Thy Book with such resolve as is born of
Thee, and observed what Thou hadst prescribed
unto them, and chosen to follow that which had
been sent down by Thee.
   Thou seest, O my Lord, how they have recognized
and confessed whatsoever Thou hast revealed
in Thy Scriptures.  Give them to drink, O
my Lord, from the hands of Thy graciousness the
waters of Thine eternity.  Write down, then, for
them the recompense ordained for him that hath
immersed himself in the ocean of Thy presence,
and attained unto the choice wine of Thy meeting.
   I implore Thee, O Thou the King of kings and
the Pitier of the downtrodden, to ordain for them
the good of this world and of the world to come.
Write down for them, moreover, what none of
Thy creatures hath discovered, and number them
with those who have circled round Thee, and who
move about Thy throne in every world of Thy
worlds.
   Thou, truly, art the Almighty, the All-Knowing,
the All-Informed.                      - &amp;Baha'u'llah

                          THE FAST

The &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas states:  "We have commanded you
to pray and fast from the beginning of maturity [15
year]; this is ordained by God, your Lord and the
Lord of your forefathers....  The traveler, the ailing,
those who are with child or giving suck, are not bound
by the fast....  Abstain from food and drink, from
sunrise to sundown, and beware lest desire deprive
you of this grace that is appointed in the Book."
   The period of the Fast is March 2 through
March 20.

   I beseech Thee, o my God, by Thy mighty
Sign, and by the revelation of Thy grace
amongst men, to cast me not away from the gate
of the city of Thy presence, and to disappoint not
the hopes I have set on the manifestations of Thy
grace amidst Thy creatures.  Thou seest me, O
my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy,
the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most
Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and


+P 239
clinging to the hem of the robe to which have
clung all in this world and in the world to come.
   I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy most sweet
Voice and by Thy most exalted Word, to draw
me ever nearer to the threshold of Thy door, and
to suffer me not to be far removed from the shadow
of Thy mercy and the canopy of Thy bounty.
Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy
Name, the Most Holy, the Most Luminous, the
Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted,
the Most Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the
robe to which have clung all in this world and in
the world to come.
   I beseech Thee, O my God, by the splendor of
Thy luminous brow and the brightness of the
light of Thy countenance, which shineth from the
all-highest horizon, to attract me by the fragrance
of Thy raiment, and make me drink of the choice
wine of Thine utterance.  Thou seest me, O my
God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy, the
Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most
Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and
clinging to the hem of the robe to which have
clung all in this world and in the world to come.
   I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy hair which


+P 240
moveth across Thy face, even as Thy most exalted
pen moveth across the pages of Thy Tablets, shedding
the musk of hidden meanings over the kingdom
of Thy creation, so to raise me up to serve
Thy Cause that I shall not fall back, nor be hindered
by the suggestions of them who have caviled
at Thy signs and turned away from Thy face.
Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy
Name, the Most Holy, the Most Luminous, the
Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted,
the Most Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the
robe to which have clung all in this world and in
the world to come.
   I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Name
which Thou hast made the King if Names, by
which all who are in heaven and all who are on
earth have been enraptured, to enable me to gaze
on the Daystar of Thy Beauty, and to supply me
with the wine of Thine utterance.  Thou seest me,
O my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most
Holy, the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the
Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious,
and clinging to the hem of the robe to which
have clung all in this world and in the world to
come.


+P 241
   I beseech Thee, O my God, by the Tabernacle
of Thy majesty upon the loftiest summits, and the
Canopy of Thy Revelation on the highest hills, to
graciously aid me to do what Thy will hath desired
and Thy purpose hath manifested.  Thou seest me,
O my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most
Holy, the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the
Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious,
and clinging to the hem of the robe to which have
clung all in this world and in the world to come.
   I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Beauty that
shineth forth above the horizon of eternity, a
Beauty before which as soon as it revealeth itself
the kingdom of beauty boweth down in worship,
magnifying it in ringing tones, to grant that I may
die to all that I possess and live to whatsoever belongeth
unto Thee.  Thou seest me, O my God,
holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy, the Most
Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most Great, the
Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and clinging to
the hem of the robe to which have clung all in this
world and in the world to come.
   I beseech Thee, O my God, by the Manifestation
of Thy Name, the Well-Beloved, through
Whom the hearts of Thy lovers were consumed

and the souls of all that dwell on earth have soared
aloft, to aid me to remember Thee amongst Thy

Name, the Most Holy, the Most Luminous, the
Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted,
the Most Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the
robe to which have clung all in this world and in
the world to come.
   I beseech Thee, O my God, by the rustling of
the Divine Lote-Tree and the murmur of the
breezes of Thine utterance in the kingdom of Thy
names, to remove me far from whatsoever Thy
will abhorreth, and draw me nigh unto the station
wherein He Who is the Dayspring of Thy
signs hath shone forth.  Thou seest me, O my
God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy, the
Most luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most
Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and
clinging to the hem of the robe to which have
clung all in this world and in the world to come.
   I beseech Thee, O my God, by that Letter
which, as soon as it proceeded our of the mouth of
Thy will, hath caused the oceans to surge, and the
winds to blow, and the fruits to be revealed, and


+P 243
the trees to spring forth, and all past traces to vanish,
and all veils to be rent asunder, and them who
are devoted to Thee to hasten unto the light of the
countenance of their Lord, the Unconstrained, to
make known unto me what lay hid in the treasuries
of Thy knowledge and concealed within the
repositories of Thy wisdom.  Thou seest me, O
my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy,
the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most
Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and
clinging to the hem of the robe to which have
clung all in this world and in the world to come.
   I beseech Thee, O my God, by the fire of THy
love which drove sleep from the eyes of Thy chosen
ones and Thy loved ones, and by their remembrance
and praise of Thee at the hour of dawn, to
number me with such as have attained unto that
which Thou hast sent down in Thy Book and
manifested through Thy will.  Thou seest me, O
my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy,
the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most
Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and
clinging to the hem of the robe to which have
clung all in this world and in the world to come.
   I beseech Thee, O my God, by the light of Thy


+P 244
countenance which impelled them who are nigh
unto Thee to meet the darts of Thy decree, and
such as are devoted to Thee to face the swords of
Thine enemies in Thy path, to write down for me
with Thy most exalted Pen what Thou hast written
down for Thy trusted ones and Thy chosen
ones.  Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy
Name, the Most Holy, the Most luminous, the
Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted,
the Most Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the
robe to which have clung all in this world and in
the world to come.
   I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Name
through which Thou hast hearkened unto the call
of Thy lovers, and the sighs of them that long for
Thee, and the cry of them that enjoy near access to
Thee, and the groaning of Them that are devoted
to Thee, and through which Thou hast fulfilled
the wishes of them that have set their hopes on
Thee, and hast granted them their desires, through
Thy grace and Thy favors, and by Thy Name
through which the ocean of forgiveness surged
before Thy face, and the clouds of Thy generosity
rained upon Thy servants, to write down


+P 245
for everyone who hath turned unto Thee, and
observed the fast prescribed by Thee, the recompense
decreed for such as speak not except by
Thy leave, and who forsook all that they possessed
in Thy path and for love of Thee.
   I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Thyself, and
by Thy signs, and Thy clear tokens, and the shining
light of the Daystar of Thy Beauty, and Thy
Branches, to cancel the trespasses of those who
have held fast to Thy laws, and have observed
what Thou hast prescribed unto them in Thy
Book.  Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy
Name, the Most Holy, the Most Luminous, the
Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted,
the Most Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the
robe to which have clung all in this world and in

   Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God!  I beseech
Thee by this Revelation whereby darkness
hath been turned into light, through which the
Frequented Fane hath been built, and the Written
Tabled revealed, and the Outspread Roll uncovered,


+P 246
to send down upon me and upon them who
are in my company that which will enable us to
soar into the heavens of Thy transcendent glory,
and will wash us from the stain of such doubts as
have hindered the suspicious from entering into
the tabernacle of Thy unity.
   I am the one, O my Lord, who hath held fast the
cord of Thy loving-kindness, and clung to the
hem of Thy mercy and favors.  Do Thou ordain
for me and for my loved ones the good of this
world and of the world to come.  Supply them,
then, with the Hidden Gift Thou didst ordain fro
the choicest among Thy creatures.
   These are, O my Lord, the days in which Thou
hast bidden Thy servants to observe the fast.
Blessed is he that observeth the fast wholly for Thy
sake and with absolute detachment from all things
except Thee.  Assist me and assist them.  O my
Lord, to obey Thee and to keep Thy precepts.
Thou, verily, hast power to do what Thou
choosest.
   There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing,
the All-Wise.  All praise be to God, the Lord of all
worlds.                                - &amp;Baha'u'llah


+P 247
   These are, o my God, the days whereon Thou
didst enjoin Thy servants to observe the
fast.  With it Thou didst adorn the preamble of the
Book of Thy Laws revealed unto Thy creatures,
and didst deck forth the Repositories of Thy commandments
in the sight of all who are in Thy
heaven and all who are on Thy earth. Thou hast
endowed every hour of these days with a special
virtue, inscrutable to all except Thee, Whose
knowledge embraceth all created things.  Thou
hast, also, assigned unto every soul a portion of
this virtue in accordance with the Tablet of Thy
decree and the Scriptures of Thine irrevocable
judgment.  Every leaf of these Books and Scriptures
Thou hast, moreover, alloted to each one of
the peoples and kindreds of the earth.
   For Thine ardent lovers Thou hast, according
to Thy decree, reserved, at each daybreak, the cup
of Thy remembrance, O Thou Who art the Ruler
of rulers!  These are they who have been so inebriated
with the wine of Thy manifold wisdom that
they forsake their couches in their longing to celebrate
Thy praise and extol Thy virtues, and flee
from sleep in their eagerness to aproach Thy


+P 248
presence and partake of Thy bounty.  Their eyes
have, at all times, been bent upon the Dayspring
of Thy loving-kindness, and their faces set towards
the Fountainhead of Thine inspiration.  Rain
down, then, upon us and upon them from the
clouds of Thy mercy what beseemeth the heaven
of Thy bounteousness and grace.
   Lauted be Thy name, o My God!  This is the
hour when Thou hast unlocked the doors of Thy
bounty before the faces of Thy creatures, and
opened wide the portals of Thy tender mercy unto
all the dwellers of Thine earth.  I beseech Thee, by
all them whose blood was shed in Thy path, who,
in their yearning over Thee, rid themselves from
all attachment to any of Thy creatures, and who
were so carried away by the sweet savors of Thine
inspiration that every single member of their
bodies intoned Thy praise and vibrated to Thy remembrance,
not to withhold from us the things
Thou hast irrevocably ordained in this Revelation -
a Revelation the potency of which hath
caused every tree to cry out what the Burning
Bush had foretime proclaimed unto Moses, Who
conversed with Thee, a Revelation that hath enabled
every least pebble to resound again with


+P 249
Thy praise, as the stones glorified Thee in the days
of &amp;Muhammad, Thy Friend.
   These are the ones, O my God, whom Thou
hast graciously enabled to have fellowship with
Thee and to commune with Him Who is the Revealer
of Thyself.  The winds of Thy will have
scattered them abroad until Thou didst gather
them together beneath Thy shadow, and didst
cause them to enter into the precincts of Thy court.
Now that Thou hast made them to abide under
the shade of the canopy of Thy mercy, do Thou
assist them to attain what must befit so august a
station.  Suffer them not, o my Lord, to be numbered
with them who, though enjoying near access
to Thee, have been kept back from recognizing
Thy face, and who, though meeting with
Thee, are deprived of Thy presence.
   These are Thy servants, O my Lord, who have
entered with Thee in this, the Most Great Prison,
who have kept the fast within its walls according
to what Thou hast commanded them in the Tablets
of Thy decree and the Books of Thy behest.
Send down, therefore, upon them what will thoroughly
purge them of all that Thou abhorrest,
that they may be wholly devoted to Thee, and


+P 250
may detach themselves entirely from all except
Thyself.
   Rain down, then, upon us.  O my God, that
which beseemeth Thy grace and befitteth Thy
bounty.  Enable us, then, O my God, to live in
remembrance of Thee and to die in love of Thee,
and supply us with the gift of Thy presence in Thy
worlds hereafter - worlds which are inscrurable
to all except Thee.  Thou art our Lord and the Lord
of all worlds, and the God of all that are in heaven
and all that are on earth.
   Thou beholdest, O my God, what hath befallen
Thy dear ones in Thy days.  Thy glory beareth me
witness!  The voice of the lamentations of Thy
chose ones hath been lifted up throughout Thy
realm.  Some were ensnared by the infidels in Thy
land, and were hindered by them from having
near access to Thee and from attaining the court of
Thy glory.  Others were able to approach Thee,
but were kept back from beholding Thy face.  Still
others were permitted, in their eagerness to look
upon Thee, to enter the precincts of Thy court,
but they allowed the veils of the imaginations of
Thy creatures and the wrongs inflicted by the oppressors


+P 251
among Thy people to come in between
them and Thee.
   This is the hour, O my Lord, which Thou hast
caused to excel every other hour, and hast related
to the choicest among Thy creatures.  I beseech
Thee, O my God, by Thy Self and by them, to ordain
in the course of this year what shall exalt Thy
loved ones.  Do Thou, moreover, decree within
this year what will enable the Daystar of Thy
power to shine brightly above the horizon of Thy
glory, and to illuminate by Thy sovereign might,
the whole world.
   Render Thy Cause victorious, O my Lord, and
abase Thou Thine enemies.  Write down, then, for
us the good of this life and of the life to come.
Thou art the Truth, Who knoweth the secret
things.  No God is there but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving,
the All-Bountiful.                     - &amp;Baha'u'llah




   Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God!  These are
the days whereon Thou hast bidden all
men to observe the fast, that through it they may
purify their souls and rid themselves of all attachment


+P 252
to anyone but Thee, and that out of their
hearts may ascend that which will be worthy of
the court of Thy majesty and may well beseem the
seat of the revelation of Thy oneness.  Grant, O
my Lord, that this fast may become a river of life-giving
waters and may yield the virtue wherewith
Thou hast endowed it.  Cleanse Thou by its
means the hearts of Thy servants whom the evils
of the world have failed to hinder from turning
towards Thie all-glorious Name, and who have
remained unmoved by the noise and tumult of
such as have repudiated Thy most resplendent
signs which have accompanied the advent of Thy
Manifestation Whom Thou hast invested with
Thy sovereignty, Thy power, Thy majesty and
glory.  These are the servants who, as soon as Thy
call reached them, hastened in the direction of Thy
mercy and were not kept back from Thee by the
changes and chances of this world or by any human
limitations.
   I am he, O my God, who testifieth to Thy unity,
who acknowledgeth Thy oneness, who
boweth humbly before the revelations of Thy
majesty, and who recognizeth with downcast
countenance the splendors of the light of Thy


+P 253
transcendent glory.  I have believed in Thee after
Thou didst enable me to know Thy Self. Whom
Thou hast revealed to men's eyes through the
power of Thy sovereignty and might.  Unto Him
I have turned, wholly detached from all things,
and cleaving steadfastly unto the cord of Thy gifts
and favors.  I have embraced His truth, and the
truth of all the wondrous laws and precepts that
have been sent down unto Him.  I have fasted for
love of Thee and in pursuance of Thine injunction,
and have broken my fast with Thy praise on
my tongue and in conformity with Thy pleasure.
Suffer me not, O my Lord, to be reckoned among
them who have fasted in the daytime, who in the
night-season have prostrated themselves before
Thy face, and who have repudiated Thy truth,
disbelieved in Thy signs, gainsaid Thy testimony,
and perverted Thine utterances.
   Open Thou, O my Lord, mine eyes and the
eyes of all them that have sought Thee, that we
may recognize Thee with Thine own eyes.  This is
Thy bidding given us in the Book sent down by
Thee unto Him Whom Thou hast chosen by Thy
behest, Whom Thou hast singled out for Thy favor
above all Thy creatures, Whom Thou hast


+P 254
been pleased to invest with Thy sovereignty, and
Whom Thou hast specially favored and entrusted
with Thy Message unto Thy people.  Praised be
Thou, therefore, O my God, inasmuch as Thou
hast graciously enabled us to recognize Him and
to acknowledge whatsoever hath been sent down
unto Him, and conferred upon us the honor of attaining
the presence of the One Whom Thou didst
promise in Thy Book and in Thy Tablets.
   Thou seest me then, O my God, with my face
turned towards Thee, cleaving steadfastly to the
cord of Thy gracious providence and generosity,
and clinging to the hem of Thy tender mercies and
bountiful favors.  Destroy not, I implore Thee, my
hopes of attaining unto that which Thou didst
ordain for Thy servants who have turned towards
the precincts of Thy court and the sanctuary of
Thy presence, and have observed the fast for love
of Thee.  I confess, O my God, that whatever proceedeth
from me is wholly unworthy of Thy
sovereignty and falleth short of Thy majesty.  And
yet I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which
Thou hast revealed Thy Self, in the glory of Thy
most excellent titles, unto all created things, in this
Revelation whereby Thou hast, through Thy


+P 255
most resplendent Name, manifested Thy beauty,
to give me to drink of the wine of Thy mercy and
of the pure beverage of Thy favor, which have
streamed forth from the right hand of Thy will,
that I may so fix my gaze upon Thee and be so detacted
from all else but Thee, that the world and
all that hath been created therein may appear before
me as a fleeting day which Thou hast not
deigned to create.
   I moreover entreat Thee, O my God, to rain
down, from the heaven of Thy will and the clouds
of Thy mercy, that which will cleanse us from the
noisome savors of our transgressions, O Thou
Who hast called Thyself the God of Mercy!  Thou
art, verily, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious,
the Beneficent.
   Cast not away, O my Lord, him that hath
turned towards Thee, nor suffer him who hath
drawn nigh unto Thee to be removed far from
Thy court.  Dash not the hopes of the suppliant
who hath longingly stretched out his hands to seek
Thy grace and favors, and deprive not Thy sincere
servants of the wonders of Thy tender mercies
and loving-kindness.  Forgiving and Most
Bountiful art Thou, O my Lord!  Power has Thou


+P 256
to do what Thou pleasest.  All else but Thee are
impotent before the revelations of Thy might, are
as lost in the face of the evidences of Thy wealth,
are as nothing when compared with the manifestations
of Thy transcendent sovereignty, and are
destitute of all strength when face to face with the
signs and tokens of Thy power.  What refuge is
there beside Thee, O my Lord, to which I can flee,
and where is there a haven to which I can hasten?
Nay, the power of Thy might beareth me witness!
No protector is there but Thee, no place to flee to
except Thee, no refuge to seek save Thee.  Cause
me to taste, O my Lord, the divine sweetness of
Thy remembrance and praise.  I swear by Thy
might!  Whosoever tasteth of its sweetness will rid
himself of all attachment to the world and all that
is therein, and will set his face towards Thee,
cleaned from the remembrance of anyone except
Thee.
   Inspire then my soul, O my God, with Thy
wondrous remembrance, that I may glorily Thjy
name.  Number me not with them who read Thy
words and fail to find Thy hidden gift which, as
decreed by Thee, is contained therein, and which
quickeneth the souls of Thy creatures and the


+P 257
hearts of Thy servants.  Cause me, O my Lord, to
be reckoned among them who have been so stirred
up by the sweet savors that thave been wafted in
Thy days that they have laid down their lives for
Thee and hastened to the scene of their death in
their longing to gaze on Thy beauty and in their
yearning to attain Thy presence.  And were anyone
to say unto them on their way, "Whither go
ye?" they would say, "Unto God, the All-Possessing,
the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting!"
   The transgressions committed by such as have
turned away from Thee and have borne themselves
haughtily towards Thee have not availed
to hinder them from loving Thee, and from setting
their faces towards Thee, and from turning in
the direction of Thy mercy.  These are they who
are blessed by the Concourse on high, who are
glorified by the denizens of the everlasting Cities,
and beyond them by those on whose foreheads
Thy most exalted pen hath written:  "These!  The
people of &amp;Baha.  Through them have been shed the
splendors of the light of guidance."  Thus hath it
been ordained, at Thy behest and by Thy will, in
the Tablet of Thine irrevocable decree.
   Proclaim, therefore, O my God, their greatness


+P 258
and the greatness of those who while living
or after death have circled round them.  Supply
them with that which Thou hast ordained for the
righteous among Thy creatures.  Potent art Thou
to do all things.  There is no God but Thee, the All-Powerful,
the Help in Peril, the Almighty, the
Most Bountiful.
   Do not bring our fasts to an end with this fast,
O my Lord, nor the covenants Thou hast made
with this covenant.  Do Thou accept all that we
have done for love of Thee, and for the sake of
Thy pleasure, and all that we have left undone as a
result of our subjection to ur evil and corrupt
desires.  Enable us, then, to cleave steadfastly to
Thy love and Thy good pleasure, and preserve us
from the mischief of such as have denied Thee and
repudiated Thy most resplendent signs.  Thou art,
in truth, the Lord of this world and of the next.
No God is there beside Thee, the Exalted, the
Most High.
   Magnify Thou, O Lord my God, Him Who is
the Primal Point, the Divine Mystery, the Unseen
Essence, the Dayspring of Divinity, and the
Manifestation of Thy Lordship, through Whom
all the knowledge of the past and all the knowledge


+P 259
of the future were made plain, through
Whom the pearls of Thy hidden wisdom were
uncovered, and the mystery of Thy treasured
name disclosed, Whom Thou hast appointed as
the Announcer of the One through Whose name
the letter B and the letter E have been joined and
united, through Whom Thy majesty, Thy sovereignty
and Thy words have been sent down, and
Thy laws set forth with clearness, and Thy signs
spread abroad, and Thy Word established,
through Whom the hearts of Thy chosen ones
were laid bare, and all that were in the heavens and
all that were on the earth were gathered together,
Whom Thou has called &amp;Ali-Muhammad in the
kingdom of Thy names, and the Spirit of Spirits
in the Tablets of Thine irrevocable decree, Whom
Thou hast invested with Thine own title, unto
Whose name all other names have, at Thy bidding
and through the power of Thy might, been
made to return, and in Whom Thou hast caused
all Thine attributes and titles to attain their final
consummation.  To Him also belong such names
as lay hid within Thy stainless tabernacles, in
Thine invisible world and Thy sanctified cities.


+P 260
   Magnify Thou, moreover, such as have believed
in Him and in His signs and have turned
towards Him, from among those that have acknowledged
Thy unity in His Latter Manifestation
- a Manifestation whereof He hath made
mention in His Tablets, and in His Books, and in
His Scriptures, and in all the wondrous verses and
gem-like utterances that have descended upon
Him.  It is this same Manifestation Whose covenant
Thou hast bidden Him establish ere He had
established His own covenant.  He it is Whose
praise the &amp;Bayan hath celebrated.  In it His excellence
hath been extolled, and His truth established,
and His sovereignty proclaimed, and His
Cause perfected.  Blessed is the man that hath
turned unto Him, and fulfilled the things He hath
commanded, O Thou Who art the Lord of the
words and the Desire of all them that have known
Thee!
   Praised be Thou, O my god, inasmuch as Thou
hast aided us to recognize and love Him.  I, therefore,
beseech Thee by Him and by Them who are
the Daysprings of Thy Divinity, and the Manifestations
of Thy Lordship, and the Treasuries of
Thy Revelation, and the Depositories of Thine
inspiration, to enable us to serve and obey Him,

+P 261
and to empower us to become the helpers of His
Cause and the dispensers of His adversaries.  Powerful
art Thou to do all that pleaseth Thee.  No God
is there beside Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious,
the One Whose help is sought by all men!

(&amp;Naw-Ruz, March 21, is the first day of the &amp;Baha'i year.)

   Praised be Thou, O my God, that Thou hast
ordained &amp;Naw-Ruz as a festival unto those
who have observed the fast for love of Thee and
abstained from all that is abhorrent unto thee.
Grant, O my Lord, that the fire of Thy love and
the heat produced by the fast enjoined by Thee
may inflame them in Thy Cause, and make them
to be occupied with Thy praise and with remembrance
of Thee.
   Since thou hast adorned them, O my Lord,
with the ornament of the fast prescribed by Thee,
do Thou adorn them also with the ornament of
Thine acceptance, through Thy grace and bountiful
favor.  For the doings of men are all dependent
upon Thy good-pleasure, and are conditioned
by Thy behest.  Shouldst Thou regard him who
hath broken the fast as one who hath observed it,
such a man would be reckoned among them who


+P 263
from eternity had been keeping the fast.  And
shouldst Thou decree that he who hath observed
the fast hath broken it, that person would be numbered
with such as have caused the Robe of Thy
Revelation to be stained with dust, and been far
removed from the crystal waters of this living
Fountain.
   Thou art He through Whom the ensign "Praise-worthy
art Thou in Thy works" hath been lifted
up, and the standard "Obeyed art Thou in thy
behest" hath been unfurled.  Make known this
Thy station, O my God, unto Thy servants, that
they may be made aware tha the excellence of all
things is dependent upon Thy bidding and Thy
word, and the virtue of every act is conditioned by
Thy leave and the good pleasure of Thy will, and
my recognize that the reins of men's doings are
within the grasp of Thine acceptance and Thy
commandment.  Make this known unto them,
that nothing whatsoever may shut them out from
Thy Beauty, in these days whereon the Christ
exclaimeth:  "All dominion is Thine, O Thou the
Begetter of the Spirit (Jesus)"; and Thy Friend
(&amp;Muhammad) crieth out:  "Glory be to Thee, O
Thou the Best-Beloved, for that thou hast uncovered


+P 264
thy Beauty, and written down for Thy
chosen ones what will cause them to attain unto
the seat of the revelation of Thy Most Great
Name, through which all the peoples have lamented
excepted such as have detached themselves
from all else except Thee, and set themselves towards
Him Who is the Revealer of Thyself and the
Manifestation of Thine attributes."
   He Who is Thy Branch and all Thy company,
O my Lord, have broken this day their fast, after
haviang observed it within the precincts of Thy
court, and in their eagerness to please Thee.  Do
Thou ordain for Him, and for them, and for all
such as have entered Thy presence in those days all
the good Thou didst destine in Thy Book.  Supply
them, then, with that which will profit them,
in both this life and in the life beyond.
   Thou, in truth, art the the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

   MARTYRS AND THEIR FAMILIES

   He is God!
   O Lord my God! O Thou Helper of the
feeble, Succorer of the poor and Deliverer of the
helpless who turn to Thee.
   With utmost lowliness I raise my suppliant
hands to Thy kingdom of beauty and fervently
call upon Thee with my inner tongue, saying: O
God, my God! Aid me to adore Thee, strengthen
my loins to serve Thee; assist me by Thy grace in
my servitude to Thee; suffer me to remain steadfast
in my obedience to Thee; pour forth upon me
the liberal effusions of Thy bounty, let the glances
of the eye of Thy loving-kindness be directed
towards me, and immerse me in the ocean of Thy
forgiveness. Grant that I may be confirmed in my
allegiance to Thy Faith, and bestow upon me a
fuller measure of certitude and assurance, that I
may wholly dispense with the world, may turn
my face with entire devotion towards They face, be
reinforced by the compelling power of proofs and

+P 266
testimonies, and, invested with majesty and power,
may pass beyond every region of heaven and
earth. Verily Thou art the Merciful, the All-Glorious,
the Kind, the Compassionate.
   O Lord! These are the survivors of the martyrs,
that company of blessed souls. They have sustained
every tribulation and displayed patience in
the face of grievous injustice. They have forsaken
all comfort and prosperity, have willingly submitted
to dire suffering and adversity in the part of
Thy love, and are still held captive in the clutches
of their enemies who continually torment them
with sore torment, and oppress them because they
walk steadfastly in The straight path. There is no
one to help them, no one to befriend them, Apart
from the ignoble and the wicked, there is no one
to associate and consort with them.
   O Lord! These souls have tasted bitter agony in
this earthly life and have, as a sign of their love
for the shining beauty of Thy countenance and in
their eagerness to attain Thy celestial kingdom,
tolerated every gross indignity that the people of
tyranny have inflicted upon them.
   O Lord! Fill their ears with the verses of divine
assistance and of a speedy victory, and deliver


+P 267
them from the oppression of such as wield terrible
might. Withhold the hands of the wicked and
leave not these souls to be torn by the claws and
teeth of fierce beasts, for they are captivated by
their love for Thee, entrusted with the mysteries
of Thy holiness, stand humbly at Thy door and
have attained to Thine exalted precinct.
   O Lord! Graciously reinforce them with a new
spirit; illumine their eyes by enable them to
behold Thy wondrous evidence in the gloom of
night; destine for them all good that aboundeth
in Thy Kingdom of eternal mysteries; make them
as brilliant stars shining over all regions, luxuriant
trees laden with fruit and branches moving in the
breezes of dawn.
   Verily, Thou are the Bountiful, the Mighty, the
Omnipotent, the Unconstrained. There is none
other God but Thee, the God of love and tender
mercy, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Forgiving.

   O God, my God! I implore Thee with a throbbing
heart and streaming tears to aid whosoever
expendeth his energy for the erection of
this House, and the construction of this Building
wherein Thy name is mentioned every morn and

   O God! Send down Thy divine increase on
whosoever endeavoreth to serve this edifice and
exerteth himself to raise it amongst the kindreds

good deed in promoting the welfare of mankind.
Open Thou the doors of wealth and abundance
unto him and make him an heir to the treasures
of the Kingdom, which perish not. Make him a
sign of Thy bestowals among the peoples and
reinforce him by the sea of Thy generosity and
