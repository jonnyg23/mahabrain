The newly born babe of that Day excels the wisest and most venerable men of
this time, and the lowliest and most unlearned of that period shall surpass in
understanding the most erudite and accomplished divines of this age....
          (The &amp;Bab, quoted in "The Dawn-Breakers:  &amp;Nabil's Narrative of the
           Early Days of the &amp;Baha'i Revelation", trans. and ed. Shoghi

I.   FROM THE WRITINGS OF &amp;BAHA'U'LLAH:

The Prophets and Messengers of God have been sent down for the sole purpose of
guiding mankind to the straight Path of Truth.  The purpose underlying their
revelation hath been to educate all men, that they may, at the hour of death,
ascend, in the utmost purity and sanctity and with absolute detachment, to the
throne of the Most High....
          ("Gleanings from the Writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah", rev. ed. (Wilmette:
          &amp;Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), Sec. 81, pp. 156-7)            [1]


     We have decreed, O people, that the highest and last end of all learning
be the recognition of Him Who is the Object of all knowledge...
          ("Gleanings from the Writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah", Sec. 98, p. 199)
                                                                          [2]

     Consider ... the revelation of the light of the Name of God, the Educator.
Behold, how in all things the evidences of such a revelation are manifest, how
the betterment of all beings dependeth upon it.  This education is of two
kinds.  The one is universal.  Its influence pervadeth all things and
sustaineth them.  It is for this reason that God hath assumed the title, "Lord
of all worlds".  The other is confined to them that have come under
the shadow of this Name, and sought the shelter of this most mighty Revelation.
They, however, that have failed to seek this shelter, have deprived themselves
of this privilege, and are powerless to benefit from the spiritual sustenance
that hath been sent down through the heavenly grace of this Most Great Name.
How great the gulf fixed between the one and the other!...
          ("Gleanings from the Writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah", Sec. 93, pp. 189-90)
                                                                          [3]
+P 2

     Man is the supreme Talisman.  Lack of a proper education hath, however,
deprived him of that which he doth inherently possess.  Through a word
proceeding out of the mouth of God he was called into being; by one word more
he was guided to recognize the Source of his education; by yet another word his
station and destiny were safeguarded.  The Great Being saith:  Regard man as a
mine rich in gems of inestimable value.  Education can, alone, cause it to
reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom....
          ("Gleanings from the Writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah", Sec.122, pp. 259-60)
                                                                          [4]

Bend your minds and wills to the education of the peoples and kindreds of the
earth, that haply the dissensions that divide it may, through the power of the
Most Great Name, be blotted out from its face, and all mankind become the
upholders of one Order, and the inhabitants of one City....
          ("Gleanings from the Writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah", Sec. 154, pp. 333-4)
                                                                          [5]

     We prescribe unto all men that which will lead to the exaltation of the
Word of God amongst His servants, and likewise, to the advancement of the world
of being and the uplift of souls.  To this end, the greatest means is education
of the child.  To this must each and all hold fast.  We have verily laid this
charge upon you in manifold Tablets as well as in My Most Holy Book.  Well is
it with him who deferreth thereto.

     We ask of God that He will assist each and every one to obey this
inescapable command that hath appeared and been caused to descend through the
Pen of the Ancient of Days.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [6]


     Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son and
daughter in the art of reading and writing and in all that hath been laid down
in the Holy Tablet.  He that putteth away that which is commanded unto him, the
Trustees are then to take from him that which is required for their
instruction, if he be wealthy, and if not the matter devolveth upon the House
of Justice.  Verily, have We made it a shelter for the poor and needy.  He that
bringeth up his son or the son of another, it is as though he hath brought up a
son of Mine; upon him rest My Glory, My loving kindness, My Mercy, that have
compassed the world.

     Strain every nerve to acquire both inner and outer perfections, for the
fruit of the human tree hath ever been and will ever be perfections both within
and without.  It is not desirable that a man be left without knowledge or
skills, for he is then but a barren tree.  Then, so much as capacity and
capability allow, ye needs must deck the tree of being with fruits such as
knowledge, wisdom, spiritual perception and eloquent speech.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [9]


     Man is even as steel, the essence of which is hidden:  through admonition
and explanation, good counsel and education, that essence will be brought to
light.  If, however, he be allowed to remain in his original condition, the
corrosion of lusts and appetites will effectively destroy him.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [10]


     There are many things which will, if neglected, be wasted, and come to
nothing.  How often in this world do we see a child who has lost his parents
and who, unless attention be devoted to his education and training, can produce
no fruit.  And better off dead than alive is he who produceth no fruit.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the persian)                   [11]


     It is the bounden duty of parents to rear their children to be staunch in
faith, the reason being that a child who removeth himself from the religion of
God will not act in such a way as to win the good pleasure of his parents and
his Lord.  For every praiseworthy deed is born out of the light of religion,
and lacking this supreme bestowal the child will not turn away from any evil,
nor will he draw nigh unto any good.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [12]


The fear of God hath ever been the prime factor in the education of His
creatures.  Well is it with them that have attained thereunto!
          ("Epistle to the Son of the Wolf", rev. ed. (Wilmette:  &amp;Baha'i
           Publishing Trust, 1979), p. 27)                                [13]


     That which is of paramount importance for the children, that which must
precede all else, is to teach them the oneness of God and the laws of God.  For
lacking this, the fear of God cannot be inculcated, and lacking the fear of God
an infinity of odious and abominable actions will spring up, and sentiments
will be uttered that transgress all bounds...

     The parents must exert every effort to rear their offspring to be
religious, for should the children not attain this greatest of adornments, they
will not obey their parents, which in a certain sense means that they will not
obey God.  Indeed, such children will show no consideration to anyone, and will
do exactly as they please.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                  [14]

     ...Schools must first train the children in the principles of religion,
so that the Promise and the Threat recorded in the Books of God may prevent
them from the things forbidden and adorn them with the mantle of the
commandments; but this in such a measure that it may not injure the children by
resulting in ignorant fanaticism and bigotry.
          ("Tablets of &amp;Baha'u'llah Revealed after the &amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 68)
                                                                          [15]


     ...Arts, crafts and sciences uplift the world of being, and are conducive
to its exaltation.  Knowledge is as wings to man's life, and a ladder for his
ascent.  Its acquisition is incumbent upon everyone.  The knowledge of such
sciences, however, should be acquired as can profit the peoples of the earth,
and not those which begin with words and end with words....

     In truth, knowledge is a veritable treasure for man, and a source of
glory, of bounty, of joy, of exaltation, of cheer and gladness unto him.  Happy
the man that cleaveth unto it, and woe betide the heedless.
          ("Epistle to the Son of the Wolf", pp. 26-27)                    [16]


     ...The learned of the day must direct the people to acquire those
branches of knowledge which are of use, that both the learned themselves and
the generality of mankind may derive benefits therefrom.  Such academic
pursuits as begin and end in words alone have never been and will never be of
any worth.  The majority of Persia's learned doctors devote all their lives to
the study of a philosophy the ultimate yield of which is nothing but words.

                                                                          [17]


     It is incumbent upon the children to exert themselves to the utmost in
acquiring the art of reading and writing....  Writing skills that will provide
for urgent needs will be enough for some; and then it is better and more
fitting that they should spend their time in studying those branches of
knowledge which are of use.

     As for what the Supreme Pen hath previously set down, the reason is that
in every art and skill, God loveth the highest perfection.

     In the treasuries of the knowledge of God there lieth concealed a
knowledge which, when applied, will largely, though not wholly, eliminate fear.
This knowledge, however, should be taught from childhood, as it will greatly
aid in its elimination....+F1
          ("Epistle to the Son of the Wolf", p. 32)                       [19]


It beseemeth ... the ... officials of the Government to convene a gathering and
choose one of the divers languages, and likewise one of the existing scripts,
or else to create a new language and a new scripts or else to create a new
language and a new script to be taught children in schools throughout the
world.  They would, in this way, be acquiring only two languages, one their own
native tongue, the other the language in which all the peoples of the world
would converse.  Were men to take fast hold on that which hath been mentioned,
the whole earth would come to be regarded as one country, and the people would
be relieved and freed from the necessity of acquiring and teaching different
languages....

     Teach ye your children the verses that have been divinely revealed, that
they may recite them in most melodious voices.  This is what hath been set down
in His mighty Book.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)                    [21]


     Teach your children that which hath been sent down from the heaven of
majesty and power that they may recite the Tablets of the Merciful in the halls
of the &amp;Mashriqu'l-Adhkars in most melodious tones....
          ("&amp;Kitab-i-Aqdas" - provisional translation from the Arabic)    [22]


     At the outset of every endeavour, it is incumbent to look to the end of
it.  Of all the arts and sciences, set the children to studying those which
will result in advantage to man, will ensure his progress and elevate his rank.
Thus the noisome odours of lawlessness will be dispelled, and thus through the
high endeavours of the nation's leaders, all will live cradled, secure and in
peace.

1.   Regarding this passage, an extract from a letter dated 5 January 1948
     written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer states:
     "Unfortunately it would seem that the knowledge `which could largely
     eliminate fear' has not been disclosed or identified by &amp;Baha'u'llah; so
     we do not know what it is".  This extract is also published in &amp;Baha'i
     News 210 (August 1948), p. 3.

     As to the children:  We have directed that in the beginning they should be
trained in the observances and laws of religion; and thereafter, in such
branches of knowledge as are of benefit, and in commercial pursuits that are
distinguished for integrity, and in deeds that will further the victory of
God's Cause or will attract some outcome which will draw the believer closer to
his Lord.

wisdom, good conduct, integrity and righteousness.

II.  FROM THE WRITINGS OF &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA:

     O God, O Thou Who hast cast Thy splendour over the luminous realities of
men, shedding upon them the resplendent lights of knowledge and guidance, and
hast chosen them out of all created things for this supernal grace, and hast
caused them to encompass all things, to understand their inmost essence, and to
disclose their mysteries, bringing them forth out of darkness into the visible
world!  "He verily showeth His special mercy to whomsoever He will."+F2

     O Lord, help Thou Thy loved ones to acquire knowledge and the sciences and
arts, and to unravel the secrets that are treasured up in the inmost reality of
all created beings.  Make them to hear the hidden truths that are written and
embedded in the heart of all that is.  Make them to be ensigns of guidance
amongst all creatures, and piercing rays of the mind shedding forth their light
in this, the "first life".+F3 Make them to be leaders unto Thee, guides unto Thy
path, runners urging men on to Thy Kingdom.

     Thou verily art the Powerful, the Protector, the Potent, the Defender, the
Mighty, the Most Generous.

     O Company of God!  To each created thing, the Ancient Sovereignty hath
portioned out its own perfection, its particular virtue and special excellence,
so that each in its degree may become a symbol denoting the sublimity of the
true Educator of humankind, and that each, even as a crystalline mirror, may
tell of the grace and splendour of the Sun of Truth.

     And from amongst all creatures He hath singled out man, to grant him His
most wondrous gift, and hath made him to attain the bounties of the Company on
High.  That most precious of gifts is attainment unto His unfailing guidance,
that the inner reality of humankind should become as a niche to hold this lamp;
and when the scattering splendours of this light do beat against the bright
glass of the heart, the heart's purity maketh the beams to blaze out even
stronger than before, and to shine in glory on the minds and souls of men.

     The attainment of the most great guidance is dependent upon knowledge and
wisdom, and on being informed as to the mysteries of the Holy Words.  Wherefore
must the loved ones of God, be they young or old, be they men or women, each
one according to his capabilities, strive to acquire the various branches of
knowledge, and to increase his understanding of the mysteries of the Holy
Books, and his skill in marshalling the divine proofs and evidences.

     The eminent &amp;Sadru's-Sudur, who hath verily attained a most
exalted station in the Retreats of Bliss, inaugurated the teaching meeting.  He
was the first blessed soul to lay the foundation of this momentous institution.

2.   &amp;Qur'an 3:67
3.   &amp;Qur'an 56:62
+P 8

God be praised, during the course of his life he educated persons who today are
strong and eloquent advocates of the Lord God, disciples who are indeed pure
and spiritual descendants of him who was so close to the Holy Threshold.  After
his passing, certain blessed individuals took steps to perpetuate his teaching
work, and when He learned of it, this Captive's heart rejoiced.

     At this time, likewise, I most urgently request the friends of God to make
every effort, as much as lieth within their competence, along these lines.  The
harder they strive to widen the scope of their knowledge, the better and more
gratifying will be the result.  Let the loved ones of God, whether young or
old, whether male or female, each according to his capabilities, bestir
themselves and spare no efforts to acquire the various current branches of
knowledge, both spiritual and secular, and of the arts.  Whensoever they gather
in their meetings let their conversation be confined to learned subjects and to
information on the knowledge of the day.

     If they do thus, they will flood the world with the Manifest Light, and
change this dusty earth into gardens of the Realm of Glory.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)                    [27]


     O thou true friend!  Read, in the school of God, the lessons of the
spirit, and learn from love's Teacher the innermost truths.  Seek out the
secrets of Heaven, and tell of the overflowing grace and favour of God.

     Although to acquire the sciences and arts is the greatest glory of
mankind, this is so only on condition that man's river floweth into the mighty
Sea, and draweth from God's ancient source His inspiration.  When this cometh
to pass, then every teacher is as a shoreless ocean, every pupil a prodigal
fountain of knowledge.  If, then, the pursuit of knowledge leadeth to the
beauty of Him Who is the object of all knowledge, how excellent that goal; but
if not, a mere drop will perhaps shut a man off from flooding grace, for with
learning cometh arrogance and pride, and it bringeth on error and indifference
to God.

     The sciences of today are bridges to reality; if then they lead not to
reality, naught remains but fruitless illusion.  By the one true God!  If
learning be not a means of access to Him, the Most Manifest, it is nothing but
evident loss.

     It is incumbent upon thee to acquire the various branches of knowledge,
and to turn thy face toward the beauty of the Manifest Beauty, that thou mayest
be a sign of saving guidance amongst the peoples of the world, and a focal
centre of understanding in this sphere from which the wise and their wisdom are
shut out, except for whoso setteth foot in the Kingdom of Lights and becometh
informed of the veiled and hidden mystery, the well-guarded secret.
         ("Selections from the Writings of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.], (Haifa:
          &amp;Baha'i World Centre, 1982), Sec. 72, p. 110)                   [28]

+P 9

     Man is in the highest degree of materiality, and at the beginning of
spirituality -- that is to say, he is the end of imperfection and the beginning
of perfection.  He is at the last degree of darkness, and at the beginning of
light; that is why it has been said that the condition of man is the end of the
night and the beginning of day, meaning that he is the sum of all the degrees
of imperfection, and that he possesses the degrees of perfection.  He has the
animal side as well as the angelic side, and the aim of an educator is to so
train human souls that their angelic aspect may overcome their animal side....
         ("Some Answered Questions", rev. ed. (Wilmette:  &amp;Baha'i Publishing
          Trust, 1985), pp. 235)                                          [29]


     Man is said to be the greatest representative of God, and he is the Book
of Creation because all the mysteries of beings exist in him.  If he comes
under the shadow of the True Educator and is rightly trained, he becomes the
essence of essences, the light of lights, the spirit of spirits; he becomes the
centre of the divine appearances, the source of spiritual qualities, the
rising-place of heavenly lights, and the receptacle of divine inspirations.  If
he is deprived of this education, he becomes the manifestation of satanic
qualities, the sum of animal vices, and the source of all dark conditions.

     The reason of the mission of the Prophets is to educate men, so that this
piece of coal may become a diamond, and this fruitless tree may be engrafted
and yield the sweetest, most delicious fruits.  When man reaches the noblest
state in the world of humanity, then he can make further progress in the
conditions of perfection, but not in state; for such states are limited, but
the divine perfections are endless.

     Close investigation will show that the primary cause of oppression and
injustice, of unrighteousness, irregularity and disorder, is the people's lack
of religious faith and the fact that they are uneducated.  When, for example,
the people are genuinely religious and are literate and well-schooled, and a
difficulty presents itself, they can apply to the local authorities; if they do
not meet with justice and secure their rights and if they see that the conduct
of the local government is incompatible with the Divine good pleasure and the
king's justice, they can then take their case to higher courts and describe the
deviation of the local administration from the spiritual law.  Those courts can
then send for the local records of the case and in this way justice will be
done.  At present, however, because of their inadequate schooling, most of the
population lack even that vocabulary to explain what they want.

     The primary, the most urgent requirement is the promotion of education.

they grasp the core of the important problems and complex needs of the time.

Observe carefully how education and the arts of civilization bring honour,
prosperity, independence and freedom to a government and its people.
          ("The Secret of Divine Civilization", p. 111)                   [33]


     But education is of three kinds:  material, human, and spiritual.
Material education is concerned with the progress and development of the body,
through gaining its sustenance, its material comfort and ease.  This education
is common to animals and man.

     Human education signifies civilization and progress -- that is to say,
government, administration, charitable works, trades, arts and handicrafts,
sciences, great inventions and discoveries and elaborate institutions, which
are the activities essential to man as distinguished from the animal.

     Divine education is that of the Kingdom of God:  it consists in acquiring
divine perfections, and this is true education; for in this state man becomes
the focus of divine blessings, the manifestation of the words, "Let Us make man
in Our image, and after Our likeness."+F4 This is the goal of the world of
humanity.

     Now we need an educator who will be at the same time a material, human,
and spiritual educator, and whose authority will be effective in all
conditions.  So if anyone should say, "I possess perfect comprehension and
intelligence, and I have no need of such an educator", he would be denying that
which is clear and evident, as though a child should say, "I have no need of
education; I will act according to my reason and intelligence, and so I shall
attain the perfections of existence"; or as though the blind should say, "I am
in no need of sight, because many other blind people exist without difficulty."

     Then it is plain and evident that man needs an educator, and this educator
must be unquestionably and indubitably perfect in all respects and
distinguished above all men.  Otherwise, if he should be like the rest of
humanity, he could not be their educator, more particularly because he must be
at the same time their material and human as well as their spiritual educator
-- that is to say, he must teach men to organize and carry out physical
matters, and to form a social order in order to establish cooperation and
mutual aid in living so that material affairs may be organized and regulated
for any circumstances that may occur.  In the same way he must establish human
education -- that is to say, he must educate intelligence and thought in such a
way that they may attain complete development, so that knowledge and science
may increase, and the reality of things, the mysteries of beings, and the
properties of existence may be discovered; that, day by day, instructions,
inventions, and institutions may be improved; and from things perceptible to
the senses conclusions as to intellectual things may be deduced.

     He must also impart spiritual education, so that intelligence and
comprehension may penetrate the metaphysical world, and may receive benefit
from the sanctifying breeze of the Holy Spirit, and may enter into relationship
with the Supreme Concourse.  He must so educate the human reality that it may
become the center of the divine appearance, to such a degree that the
attributes and the names of God shall be resplendent in the mirror of the
reality of man, and the holy verse, "We will make man in Our image and
likeness", shall be realized.+F5

     There are some who imagine that an innate sense of human dignity will
prevent man from committing evil actions and insure his spiritual and material
perfection.  That is, that an individual who is characterized with natural
intelligence, high resolve, and a driving zeal, will, without any consideration
for the severe punishments consequent on evil acts, or for the great rewards of
righteousness, instinctively refrain from inflicting harm on his fellow men and
will hunger and thirst to do good.  And yet, if we ponder the lessons of
history it will become evident that this very sense of honor and dignity is
itself one of the bounties deriving from the instructions of the Prophets of
God.  We also observe in infants the signs of aggression and lawlessness, and
that if a child is deprived of a teacher's instructions his undesirable
qualities increase from one moment to the next.  It is therefore clear that the
emergence of this natural sense of human dignity and honor is the result of
education.  Secondly, even if we grant for the sake of the argument that
instinctive intelligence and an innate moral quality would prevent wrongdoing,
it is obvious that individuals so characterized are as rare as the
philosopher's stone.  An assumption of this sort cannot be validated by mere
words, it must be supported by the facts.  Let us see what power in creation
impels the masses toward righteous aims and deeds!

     Aside from this, if that rare individual who does exemplify such a faculty
should also become an embodiment of the fear of God, it is certain that his
strivings toward righteousness would be strongly reinforced.
          ("The Secret of Divine Civilization", pp. 97-8)                 [35]


     As to the differences among human beings and the superiority or
inferiority of some individuals to others, the materialists are of two schools
of thought:  one group is of the opinion that these differences and the
superior qualities of some individuals are inborn, and are, as they would put
it, an exigency of nature.  According to them, it is obvious that differences
within the species are inherent.  For example, there are, in nature, different
kinds of trees; animals, too, are varied in their nature; even minerals vary
naturally among themselves, and you have here a quarry filled with stones,
there a mine of rubies, translucent and richly red; here a shell with pearl
enclosed, there only a bit a clay.

------------------------
5.  Cf Gen. 1:26
+P 12

     The other school of traditional philosophers holdeth to the view that the
differences among individuals and the varying levels of intellects and talents
derive from education:  for with training, a crooked branch can grow straight,
and a barren tree of the desert can be domesticated, it can be grafted and made
to bear fruit, which may be bitter, but with time turneth sweet.  At first, its
fruit may be small; but it will grow large and full of flavour, a delight to
the taste.

     The strongest proof adduced by the second group is this, that the tribes
of Africa are, generally speaking, ignorant and wild, while the civilized
peoples of America are, in general, possessed of wisdom and understanding,
which proveth that the difference between these two peoples is due to education
and experience.  Such are the stated views of the philosophers.

     The Manifestations of God, on the other hand, affirm that differences are
demonstrably and indisputably innate, and that "We have caused some of you to
excel others"+F6 is a proven and inescapable fact.  It is certain that human
 beings are, by their very nature, different one from the other.  Observe a
small group of children, born of the same parents, attending the same school,
receiving the same education, living on the same diet:  some, becoming well
educated, will achieve a high degree of advancement; some will reach a middle
level; and some will not prove educable at all.  It is therefore clear that the
disparity among individuals is due to differences of degree which are innate.

     But the Manifestations also consider that training and education
demonstrably exert a tremendous influence.  If, for example, a child is
deprived of schooling he will certainly remain ignorant, and his knowledge will
be limited to what he is able to find out for himself; but if he is brought to
a qualified teacher to study the sciences and arts, he will learn of the
discoveries made by thousands of other human beings.  Thus education is a guide
to those who have gone astray; it maketh the blind to see; it bestoweth
judgement on the foolish, and a yield of greatness on the unproductive; it
causeth the mute to speak, and turneth the false dawn into the true morning's
light; through it the tiny seed will become a towering palm, and the runaway
slave, a reigning king.

     Thus is it certain that education exerteh an influence, and for this
reason the Manifestation of God, the Well-Springs of His mercy, are raised up
in the world, that through the breaths of holiness They may educate the human
race, and make of the sucking child a strong and valiant man.  Through Them
will the outcasts of the earth become the cherished companions of Heaven, and
the portionless receive their due.

     Question.  -- How many kinds of character has man, and what is the cause
of the differences and varieties in men?

     Answer.  -- He has the innate character, the inherited character, and the
acquired character which is gained by education.

                                    - 12 -








------------------------
6.  &amp;Qur'an 17:22
+P 13

     With regard to the innate character, although the divine creation is
purely good, yet the varieties of natural qualities in man come from the
difference of degree; all are excellent, but they are more or less so,
according to the degree.  So all mankind possess intelligence and capacities,
but the intelligence, the capacity, and the worthiness of men differ.  This is
evident.

     For example, take a number of children of one family, of one place, of one
school, instructed by one teacher, reared on the same food, in the same
climate, with the same clothing, and studying the same lessons -- it is certain
that among these children some will be clever in the sciences, some will be of
average ability, and some dull.  Hence it is clear that in the original nature
there exists a difference of degree and varieties of worthiness and capacity.
This difference does not imply good or evil but is simply a difference of
degree.  One has the highest degree, another the medium degree, and another the
lowest degree.  So man exists; the animal, the plant and the mineral exist also
-- but the degrees of these four existences vary.  What a difference between
the existence of man and of the animal!  Yet both are existences.  It is
evident that in existence there are differences of degrees.

     The variety of inherited qualities comes from strength and weakness of
constitution -- that is to say, when the two parents are weak, the children
will be weak; if they are strong, the children will be robust.  In the same
way, purity of blood has a great effect; for the pure germ is like the superior
stock which exists in plants and animals.  For example, you see that children
born from a weak and feeble father and mother will naturally have a feeble
constitution and weak nerves; they will be afflicted and will have neither
patience, nor endurance, nor resolution, nor perseverance, and will be hasty;
for the children inherit the weakness and debility of their parents.

     Besides this, an especial blessing is conferred on some families and some
generations.  Thus it is an especial blessing that from among the descendants
of Abraham should have come all the Prophets of the children of Israel.  This
is a blessing that God has granted to this descent:  to Moses from his father
and mother, to Christ from his mother's line; also to &amp;Muhammad and the the
&amp;Bab, and to all the Prophets and the Holy Manifestations of Israel.  The
Blessed Beauty+F7 is also a lineal descendant of Abraham, for Abraham had other
sons besides Ishmael and Isaac who in those days migrated to the lands of
Persia and Afghanistan, and the Blessed Beauty is one of their descendants.

     Hence it is evident that inherited character also exists, and to such a
degree that if the characters are not in conformity with their origin, although
they belong physically to that lineage, spiritually they are not considered
members of the family, like Canaan,+F8 who is not reckoned as being of the race
of Noah.

------------------------
7.  &amp;Baha'u'llah
8.  Cf. Genesis 9:25
+P 14

     But the difference of the qualities with regard to culture is very great,
for education has great influence.  Through education the ignorant become
learned; the cowardly become valiant.  Through cultivation the crooked branch
becomes straight; the acid, bitter fruit of the mountains and woods becomes
sweet and delicious; and the five-petaled flower becomes hundred-petaled.
Through education savage nations become civilized, and even the animals become
domesticated.  Education must be considered as most important, for as diseases
in the world of bodies are extremely contagious, so, in the same way, qualities
of spirit and heart are extremely contagious.  Education has a universal
influence, and the differences caused by it are very great.

     Perhaps someone will say that, since the capacity and worthiness of men
differ, therefore, the difference of capacity certainly causes the difference of
characters.+F9

     But this is not so, for capacity is of two kinds:  natural capacity and
acquired capacity.  The first, which is the creation of God, is purely good --
in the creation of God there is no evil; but the acquired capacity has become
the cause of the appearance of evil.  For example, God has created all men in
such a manner and has given them such a constitution and such capacities that
they are benefited by sugar and honey and harmed and destroyed by poison.  This
nature and constitution is innate, and God has given it equally to all mankind.
But man begins little by little to accustom himself to poison by taking a small
quantity each day, and gradually increasing it, until he reaches such a point
that he cannot live without a gram of opium every day.  The natural capacities
are thus completely perverted.  Observe how much the natural capacity and
constitution can be changed, until by different habits and training they become
entirely perverted.  One does not criticize vicious people because of their
innate capacities and nature, but rather for their acquired capacities and
nature.

     In creation there is no evil; all is good.  Certain qualities and natures
innate in some men and apparently blameworthy are not so in reality.  For
example, from the beginning of his life you can see in a nursing child the
signs of greed, of anger and of temper.  Then, it may be said, good and evil
are innate in the reality of man, and this is contrary to the pure goodness of
nature and creation. The answer to this is that greed, which is to ask for
something more, is a praiseworthy quality provided that it is used suitably.
So if a man is greedy to acquire science and knowledge, or to become
compassionate, generous, and just, it is most praiseworthy.  If he exercises
his anger and wrath against the bloodthirsty tyrants who are like ferocious
beasts, it is very praiseworthy; but if he does not use these qualities in a
right way, they are blameworthy.
          ("Some Answered Questions", pp. 212-15)                         [37]


     As to the difference between that material civilization now prevailing,
and the divine civilization which will be one of the benefits to derive from
the House of Justice, it is this:  material civilization, through the power of
punitive and retaliatory laws, restraineth the people from criminal acts; and

                                    - 14 -








------------------------
9.  i.e. therefore people cannot be blamed for their character.
+P 15

notwithstanding this, while laws to retaliate against and punish a man are
continually proliferating, as ye can see, no laws exist to reward him.  In all
the cities of Europe and America, vast buildings have been erected to serve as
jails for the criminals.

     Divine civilization, however, so traineth every member of society that no
one, with the exception of a negligible few, will undertake to commit a crime.
There is thus a great difference between the prevention of crime through
measures that are violent and retaliatory, and so training the people, and
enlightening them, and spiritualizing them, that without any fear of punishment
or vengeance to come, they will shun all criminal acts.  They will, indeed,
look upon the very commission of a crime as a great disgrace and in itself the
harshest of punishments.  They will become enamoured of human perfections, and
will consecrate their lives to whatever will bring light to the world and will
further those qualities which are acceptable at the Holy Threshold of God.

     See then how wide is the difference between material civilization and
divine.  With force and punishments, material civilization seeketh to restrain
the people from mischief, from inflicting harm on society and committing
crimes.  But in a divine civilization, the individual is so conditioned that
with no fear of punishment, he shunneth the perpetration of crimes, seeth the
crime itself as the severest of torments, and with alacrity and joy, setteth
himself to acquiring the virtues of humankind, to furthering human progress,
and to spreading light across the world.
         ("Selections from the Writings of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 105, pp. 132-33)
                                                                          [38]


     Among the safeguards of the Holy Faith is the training of children, and
this is among the weightiest of principles in all the Divine Teachings.  Thus
from the very beginning mothers must rear their infants in the cradle of good
morals -- for it is the mothers who are the first educators -- so that, when
the child cometh to maturity, he will prove to be endowed with all the virtues
and qualities that are worthy of praise.

     And further, according to the Divine commandments, every child must learn
reading and writing, and acquire such branches of knowledge as are useful and
necessary, as well as learning an art or skill.  The utmost care must be
devoted to these matters; any neglect of them, any failure to act on them, is
not permissible.

     Observe how many penal institutions, houses of detention and places of
torture are made ready to receive the sons of men, the purpose being to prevent
them, by punitive measures, from committing terrible crimes -- whereas this
very torment and punishment only increaseth depravity, and by such means the
desired aim cannot be properly achieved.

     Therefore must the individual be trained from his infancy in such a way
that he will never undertake to commit a crime, will, rather, direct all his
energies to the acquisition of excellence, and will look upon the very

                                    - 15 -
+P 16

commission of an evil deed as in itself the harshest of all punishments,
considering the sinful act itself to be far more grievous than any prison
sentence.  For it is possible so to train the individual that, although crime
may not be completely done away with, still it will become very rare.

     The purport is this, that to train the character of humankind is one of
the weightiest commandments of God, and the influence of such training is the
same as that which the sun exerteth over tree and fruit.  Children must be most
carefully watched over, protected and trained; in such consisteth true
parenthood and parental mercy.

     Otherwise, the children will turn into weeds growing wild, and become the
cursed, Infernal Tree,+F10knowing not right from wrong, distinguishing not the
highest of human qualities from all that is mean and vile; they will be brought
up in vainglory, and will be hated of the Forgiving Lord.

     Wherefore doth every child, new-risen in the garden of Heavenly love,
require the utmost training and care.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [39]


     The root cause of wrongdoing is ignorance, and we must therefore hold fast
to the tools of perception and knowledge.  Good character must be taught.
Light must be spread afar, so that, in the school of humanity, all may acquire
the heavenly characteristics of the spirit, and see for themselves beyond any
doubt that there is no fiercer Hell, no more fiery abyss, than to possess a
character that is evil and unsound; no more darksome pit nor loathsome torment
than to show forth qualities which deserve to be condemned.

     The individual must be educated to such a high degree that he would rather
have his throat cut than tell a lie, and would think it easier to be slashed
with a sword or pierced with a spear than to utter calumny or be carried away
by wrath.

     Thus will be kindled the sense of human dignity and pride, to burn away
the reapings of lustful appetites.  Then will each one of God's beloved shine
out as a bright moon with qualities of the spirit, and the relationship of each
to the Sacred Threshold of his Lord will be not illusory but sound and real,
will be as the very foundation of the building, not some embellishment on its
&amp;facade.

     It followeth that the children's school must be a place of utmost
discipline and order, that instruction must be thorough, and provision must be
made for the rectification and refinement of character; so that, in his
earliest years, within the very essence of the child, the divine foundation
will be laid and the structure of holiness raised up.

     Know that this matter of instruction, of character rectification and
refinement, of heartening and encouraging the child, is of the utmost
importance, for such are basic principles of God.

     Thus, if God will, out of these spiritual schools illumined children will
arise, adorned with all the fairest virtues of humankind, and will shed their
light not only across Persia, but around the world.

     It is extremely difficult to teach the individual and refine his character
once puberty is passed.  By then, as experience has shown, even if every effort
be exerted to modify some tendency of his, it all availeth nothing.  He may,
perhaps, improve somewhat today; but let a few days pass and he forgetteth, and
turneth backward to his habitual condition and accustomed ways.  Therefore it
is in early childhood that a firm foundation must be laid.  While the branch is
green and tender it can easily be made straight.

     Our meaning is that qualities of the spirit are the basic and divine
foundation, and adorn the true essence of man; and knowledge is the cause of
human progress.  The beloved of God must attach great importance to this
matter, and carry it forward with enthusiasm and zeal.

     Were there no educator, all souls would remain savage, and were it not for
the teacher, the children would be ignorant creatures.

     It is for this reason that, in this new cycle, education and training are
recorded in the Book of God as obligatory and not voluntary.  That is, it is
enjoined upon the father and mother, as a duty, to strive with all effort to
train the daughter and the son, to nurse them from the breast of knowledge and
to rear them in the bosom of sciences and arts.  Should they neglect this
matter, they shall be held responsible and worthy of reproach in the presence
of the stern Lord.

     And among the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah is the promotion of education.
Every child must be instructed in sciences as much as is necessary.  If the
parents are able to provide the expenses of this education, it is well,
otherwise the community must provide the means for the teaching of that child.

     To promote knowledge is thus an inescapable duty imposed on every one of
the friends of God.  It is incumbent upon that Spiritual Assembly, that

even as young plants, thrive and flourish in the soft-flowing waters that are

     My wish is that these children should receive a &amp;Baha'i education, so
that they may progress both here and in the Kingdom, and rejoice thy heart.

     In a time to come, morals will degenerate to an extreme degree.  It is
essential that children be reared in the &amp;Baha'i way, that they may find
happiness both in this world and the next.  If not, they shall be beset by
sorrows and troubles, for human happiness is founded upon spiritual behaviour.

     Child education is a matter of the utmost importance.  The infant, while
yet a suckling, must receive &amp;Baha'i training, and the loving spirit of Christ
and &amp;Baha'u'llah must be breathed into him, that he may be reared in accord
with the verities of the Gospel and the Most Holy Book.

O thou who gazest upon the Kingdom of God!

     Thy letter was received and we note that thou art engaged in teaching the
children of the believers, that these tender little ones have been learning the
Hidden Words and the prayers and what it meaneth to be a &amp;Baha'i.

     The instruction of these children is even as the work of a loving gardener
who tendeth his young plants in the flowering fields of the All-Glorious.
There is no doubt that it will yield the desired results; especially is this
true of instruction as to &amp;Baha'i obligations and &amp;Baha'i conduct, for the

little children must needs be made aware in their very heart and soul that
"&amp;Baha'i" is not just a name but a truth.  Every child must be trained in the
things of the spirit, so that he may embody all the virtues and become a source
of glory to the Cause of God.  Otherwise, the mere word "&amp;Baha'i", if it yield
no fruit, will come to nothing.

     Strive then to the best of thine ability to let these children know that a
&amp;Baha'i is one who embodieth all the perfections, that he must shine out like
a lighted taper -- not be darkness upon darkness and yet bear the name
"&amp;Baha'i".

     We have previously written and sent out a detailed letter regarding the
education of children in faith, certitude, learning and spiritual knowledge,
and their being taught to call upon the Heavenly Kingdom with suppliant hearts.

     It is certain that ye will exert every effort toward this end.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [48]


     As to thy question regarding the education of children:  It behoveth thee
to nurture them at the breast of the love of God, and urge them onward to the
things of the spirit -- that they may turn their faces unto God; that their
ways may conform to the rules of good conduct and their character be second to
none; that they make their own all the graces and praiseworthy qualities of
humankind; that they acquire a sound knowledge of the various branches of
learning -- so that from the very beginning of life they may become spiritual
beings, dwellers in the Kingdom, enamoured of the sweet breaths of holiness,
and may receive an education religious, spiritual, and of the Heavenly Realm.
Verily will I call upon God to grant them a happy outcome in this.

Exert every effort to acquire the various branches of knowledge and true
understanding.  Strain every nerve to achieve both material and spiritual
accomplishments.

     Encourage the children from their earliest years to master every kind of
learning, and make them eager to become skilled in every art -- the aim being
that through the favouring grace of God, the heart of each one may become even
as a mirror disclosing the secrets of the universe, penetrating the innermost
reality of all things; and that each may earn world-wide fame in all branches
of knowledge, science and the arts.

     Certainly, certainly, neglect not the education of the children.  Rear
them to be possessed of spiritual qualities, and be assured of the gifts and
favours of the Lord.

O ye two servants at the Holy Threshold!
     We have been greatly cheered and refreshed to know that ye have organized
meetings for the education of children.  Whoso is active in those meetings
whether as a teacher of the children or a sponsor, will certainly become the
recipient of confirmations from the invisible Realm, and endless bounties will
compass him about.

     With great joy, therefore, encouragement is offered for this highly
laudable endeavour that ye may witness an exceeding great reward.

     Await ye the sure and certain confirmations of the All-Merciful.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [51]


     O ye two well-loved handmaids of God!  Whatever a man's tongue speaketh,
that let him prove by his deeds.  If he claimeth to be a believer, then let him
act in accordance with the precepts of the &amp;Abha Kingdom.

     Praised be God, ye two have demonstrated the truth of your words by your
deeds, and have won the confirmations of the Lord God.  Every day at first
light, ye gather the &amp;Baha'i children together and teach them the communes and
prayers.  This is a most praiseworthy act, and bringeth joy to the children's
hearts:  that they should, at every morn, turn their faces toward the Kingdom
and make mention of the Lord and praise His Name, and in the sweetest of
voices, chant and recite.

     These children are even as young plants, and teaching them the prayers is
as letting the rain pour down upon them, that they may wax tender and fresh,
and the soft breezes of the love of God may blow over them, making them to
tremble with joy.

     Blessedness awaiteth you, and a fair haven.

O thou steadfast in the Covenant!

     Your letter hath come and imparted great delight, with its word that,
praised be God, the youth of the &amp;Abha paradise are verdant and tender, from
showers scattered out of clouds of heavenly grace; that they thrive and
flourish in the April rains of heavenly guidance, and are progressing day by
day.

     It is certain that each and every one of them will grow to be as a banner
of guidance, a symbol of the bestowals that come from the Realm of the
All-Glorious.  They will be sweet-singing nightingales in the gardens of
knowledge, gazelles delicate and comely, roaming the plains of the love of God.
You must attach the greatest importance to the education of children, for this
is the foundation of the Law of God, and the bedrock of the edifice of His
Faith.

     If it were known how much joy you have imparted through what hath been
done for the children, the believers would surely educate all their children in
the same way.

O true companions!

     All humankind are as children in a school, and the Dawning-Points of
Light, the Sources of divine revelation, are the teachers, wondrous and without
peer.  In the school of realities they educate these sons and daughters,
according to teachings from God, and foster them in the bosom of grace, so that
they may develop along every line, show forth the excellent gifts and blessings
of the Lord, and combine human perfections; that they may advance in all
aspects of human endeavour, whether outward or inward, hidden or visible,
material or spiritual, until they make of this mortal world a wide-spread
mirror, to reflect that other world which dieth not.

     ... Because, in this most momentous of ages, the Sun of Truth hath risen
at the highest point of the spring equinox, and cast its rays on every clime,
it shall kindle such tremulous excitement, it shall release such vibrations in
the world of being, it shall stimulate such growth and development, it shall
stream out with such a glory of light, and clouds of grace shall pour down such
plentiful waters, and fields and plains shall teem with such a galaxy of
sweet-smelling plants and blooms, that this lowly earth will become the &amp;Abha
Kingdom, and this nether world the world above.  Then will this fleck of dust
be as the vast circle of the skies, this human place the palace-court of God,
this spot of clay the Dayspring of the endless favours of the Lord of Lords.

     Wherefore, O loved ones of God!  Make ye a mighty effort till you
yourselves betoken this advancement and all these confirmations, and become
focal centres of God's blessings, daysprings of the light of His unity,
promoters of the gifts and graces of civilized life.  Be ye in that land
vanguards of the perfections of humankind; carry forward the various branches
of knowledge, be active and progressive in the field of inventions and the
arts.  Endeavour to rectify the conduct of men, and seek to excel the whole
world in moral character.  While the children are yet in their infancy feed
them from the breast of heavenly grace, foster them in the cradle of all
excellence, rear them in the embrace of bounty.  Give them the advantage of
every useful kind of knowledge.  Let them share in every new and rare and
wondrous craft and art.  Bring them up to work and strive, and accustom them to

                                    - 21 -
+P 22

hardship.  Teach them to dedicate their lives to matters of great import, and
inspire them to undertake studies that will benefit mankind.
          ("Selections from the Writings of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 102,
           pp. 128-29)                                                    [54]


     The education and training of children is among the most meritorious acts
of humankind and draweth down the grace and favour of the All-Merciful, for
education is the indispensable foundation of all human excellence and alloweth
man to work his way to the heights of abiding glory.  If a child be trained
from his infancy, he will, through the loving care of the Holy Gardener, drink
in the crystal waters of the spirit and of knowledge, like a young tree amid
the rilling brooks.  And certainly he will gather to himself the bright rays of
the Sun of Truth, and through its light and heat will grow ever fresh and fair
in the garden of life.

     Therefore must the mentor be a doctor as well:  that is, he must, in
instructing the child, remedy its faults; must give him learning, and at the
same time rear him to have a spiritual nature.  Let the teacher be a doctor to
the character of the child, thus will he heal the spiritual ailments of the
children of men.

     If, in this momentous task, a mighty effort be exerted, the world of
humanity will shine out with other adornings, and shed the fairest light.  Then
will this darksome place grow luminous, and this abode of earth turn into
Heaven.  The very demons will change to angels then, and wolves to shepherds of
the flock, and the wild-dog pack to gazelles that pasture on the plains of
oneness, and ravening beasts to peaceful herds; and birds of prey, with talons
sharp as knives, to songsters warbling their sweet native notes.

     For the inner reality of man is a demarcation line between the shadow and
the light, a place where the two seas meet;+F12it is the
lowest point on the arc of descent,+F13and therefore is it capable of
gaining all the grades above.  With education it can achieve all excellence;
devoid of education it will stay on, at the lowest point of imperfection.

     Every child is potentially the light of the world -- and at the same time
its triple darkness; wherefore must the question of education be accounted as
of primary importance.  From his infancy, the child must be nursed at the
breast of God's love, and nurtured in the embrace of His knowledge, that he may
radiate light, grow in spirituality, be filled with wisdom and learning, and
take on the characteristics of the angelic host.

     Among the greatest of all services that can possibly be rendered by man to
Almighty God is the education and training of children, young plants of the
&amp;Abha Paradise, so that these children, fostered by grace in the way of
salvation, growing like pearls of divine bounty in the shell of education, will
one day bejewel the crown of abiding glory.

     It is, however, very difficult to undertake this service, even harder to
succeed in it.  I hope that thou wilt acquit thyself well in this most
important of tasks, and successfully carry the day, and become an ensign of
God's abounding grace; that these children, reared one and all in the holy
Teachings, will develop natures like unto the sweet airs that blow across the
gardens of the All-Glorious, and will waft their fragrance around the world.

     Blessed art thou, since thou art engaged in rendering a service which will
make thy face to shine in the &amp;Abha Kingdom, and that is the education and
training of children.  If one should, in the right way, teach and train the
children, he will be performing a service than which none is greater at the
sacred Threshold.  According to what we have heard, you are succeeding in this.
You must, however, struggle unceasingly to perfect yourself and win ever higher
achievements.

     At all times, I implore Almighty God to make you the means of illuminating
the minds of those children, of bringing their hearts to life and sanctifying
their souls.

hidden mysteries; so well that in the Kingdom of All-Glorious, each one of

them in the heart of the shell of divine guidance.

     Strive thou with heart and soul; see to it that the children are raised up
to embody the highest perfections of humankind, to such a degree that every one
of them will be trained in the use of the mind, in acquiring knowledge, in
humility and lowliness, in dignity, in ardour and love.

     In thy school, instruct thou God's children in the customs of the Kingdom.
Be thou a teacher of love, in a school of unity.  Train thou the children of
the friends of the Merciful in the rules and ways of His loving-kindness.  Tend
the young trees of the &amp;Abha Paradise with the welling waters of His grace and
peace and joy.  Make them to flourish under the downpour of His bounty.  Strive
with all thy powers that the children may stand out and grow fresh, delicate,
and sweet, like the ideal trees in the gardens of Heaven.

     All these gifts and bounties depend upon love for the Beauty of the
All-Glorious, and on the blessings in the teachings of the Most High, and the
spiritual instructions of the Supreme Concourse, and on ecstasy and ardour and
diligent pursuit of whatsoever will redound to the eternal honour of the
community of man.

O thou steadfast in the Covenant!

     In reply to thy letter, I am obliged to be brief:  Praise thou God that
thou hast succeeded in becoming a teacher of young &amp;Baha'is, young trees of
the &amp;Abha Paradise, and at the same time art able to benefit the other children
as well.

     According to the explicit divine Text, teaching the children is
indispensable and obligatory.  It followeth that teachers are servants of the
Lord God, since they have arisen to perform this task, which is the same as
worship.  You must therefore offer praise with every breath, for you are
educating your spiritual children.

     The spiritual father is greater than the physical one, for the latter
bestoweth but this world's life, whereas the former endoweth his child with
life everlasting.  This is why, in the Law of God, teachers are listed among
the heirs.

     Now you in reality have acquired all these spiritual children free and
gratis, and that is better than having physical children; for such children are
not grateful to their fathers, since they feel that the father serveth them
because he must -- and therefore no matter what he doeth for them, they pay it
no mind.  Spiritual children, however, are always appreciative of their
father's loving kindness.  This verily is out of the grace of thy Lord, the
Beneficent.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [63]


O thou who art steadfast in the Covenant!

     Thou hast exerted strenuous efforts for the education of children and I
have been, and am, infinitely pleased with thee.  Praise God, thou hast been
enabled to serve in this field, and it is certain that the confirmations of the
&amp;Abha Kingdom will encompass thee, and thou shalt achieve prosperity and
success.

     Today the training and education of the believers' children is the
pre-eminent goal of the chosen.  It is the same as servitude to the Sacred
Threshold and waiting upon the Blessed Beauty.  Joyously, therefore, canst thou
pride thyself on this.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [64]


O thou teacher of the children of the kingdom!

     Thou hast arisen to perform a service which would justly entitle thee to
vaunt thyself over all the teachers on earth.  For the teachers of this world
make use of human education to develop the powers, whether spiritual or
material, of humankind, whilst thou art training these young plants in the
gardens of God according to the education of Heaven, and art giving them the
lessons of the Kingdom.

     The result of this kind of teaching will be that it will attract the
blessings of God, and make manifest the perfections of man.

     Hold thou fast to this kind of teaching, for the fruits of it will be very
great.  The children must, from their infancy, be raised to be spiritual and
godly &amp;Baha'is.  If such be their training, they will remain safe from every
test.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [65]


O ye recipients of the favours of God!

     In this new and wondrous Age, the unshakeable foundation is the teaching
of sciences and arts.  According to explicit Holy Texts, every child must be
taught crafts and arts, to the degree that is needful.  Wherefore, in every
city and village, schools must be established and every child in that city or
village is to engage in study to the necessary degree.

     It followeth that whatever soul shall offer his aid to bring this about
will assuredly be accepted at the Heavenly Threshold, and extolled by the
Company on High.

     Since ye have striven hard toward this all important end, it is my hope
that ye will reap your reward from the Lord of clear tokens and signs, and that
the glances of heavenly grace will turn your way.
          ("Selections from the Writings of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 109,

O ye of high resolve and noble aims!

     Your letter was eloquent, its contents original and sensitively expressed,
and it betokened your great and praiseworthy efforts to educate the children,
both girls and boys.  This is among the most important of all human endeavours.
Every possible means of education must be made available to &amp;Baha'i children,
tender plants of the divine garden, for in this consisteth the illumination of
humankind.

     Praised be God, the friends in &amp;Ishqabad have laid a solid foundation,
an unassailable base.  It was in the City of Love that the first &amp;Baha'i House
of Worship was erected; and today in this city the means for the education of
children are also being developed, inasmuch as even during the war years this
duty was not neglected, and indeed deficiencies were made up for.  Now must ye
widen the scope of your endeavours and draw up plans to establish schools for
higher education, so that the City of Love will become the &amp;Baha'i focal
centre for science and the arts.  Thanks to the bountiful assistance of the
Blessed Beauty, means for this will be provided.

     Devote ye particular attention to the school for girls, for the greatness
of this wondrous Age will be manifested as a result of progress in the world of
women.  This is why ye observe that in every land the world of women is on the

march, and this is due to the impact of the Most Great Manifestation, and the
power of the teachings of God.

     Instruction in the schools must begin with instruction in religion.
Following religious training, and the binding of the child's heart to the love
of God, proceed with his education in the other branches of knowledge.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [67]


     One of the friends hath sent us a letter regarding the school at
&amp;Ishqabad, to the effect that, praised be God, the friends there are now
working hard to get the school in order, and have appointed teachers well
qualified for their task, and that from this time forward the greatest care
will be devoted to the supervision and management of the school.

     It is likewise my hope that the favours and bestowals of God, the
bountiful King, will encompass you, so that the friends may come to excel the
others in all things.

     One of the most important of undertakings is the education of children,
for success and prosperity depend upon service to and worship of God, the Holy,
the All-Glorified.

     Among the greatest of all great services is the education of children, and
promotion of the various sciences, crafts and arts.  Praised be God, ye are now
exerting strenuous efforts toward this end.  The more ye persevere in this most
important task, the more will ye witness the confirmations of God, to such a
degree that ye yourselves will be astonished.

     This verily is a matter beyond all doubt, a pledge that shall certainly be
redeemed.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [68]


     The services ye are rendering in support of the &amp;Ta'yid School merit the
highest praise.  It is certain that God in His bounty will send down His
manifold, heavenly blessings upon you.

     The believers are in duty bound to establish schools where children can
acquire knowledge, and since these friends have pledged themselves to make
sacrifices in this connection, and are contributing to the support of the
&amp;Ta'yid School, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha in all lowliness and submission offereth thanks
and praise to the Kingdom of Mysteries.  He asketh that bounties will be sent
down unto you, and peace of mind, so that ye may succeed in rendering this most
laudable service with ease and joy.

     O Thou Provider!  These souls are doing good.  Make them dear to both
worlds, make them the recipients of measureless grace.  Thou art the Powerful,
Thou art the Able, Thou art the Giver, the Bestower, the Incomparable Lord.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [69]


     What thou hadst written as to the school is a cause for great rejoicing,
and delighteth the heart.  The friends one and all were cheered and refreshed
by this news.

     This school is one of the vital and essential institutions which indeed
support and bulwark the edifice of humankind.  God willing, it will develop and
be perfected along every line.  Once this school hath, in every respect, been
perfected, once it hath been made to flourish and to surpass all other schools,
then, each following the other, more and more schools must be established.

     Our meaning is that the friends must direct their attention toward the
education and training of all the children of Persia, so that all of them,
having, in the school of true learning, achieved the power of understanding and
come to know the inner realities of the universe, will go on to uncover the
signs and mysteries of God, and will find themselves illumined by the lights of
the knowledge of the Lord, and by His love.  This truly is the very best way to
educate all peoples.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [70]


     Make ye every effort to improve the &amp;Tarbiyat School and to develop order
and discipline in this institution.  Utilize every means to make this School a
garden of the All-Merciful, from which the lights of learning will cast their
beams, and wherein the children, whether &amp;Baha'i or other, will be educated to
such a degree as to become God's gifts to man, and the pride of the human race.
Let them make the greatest progress in the shortest span of time, let them open
wide their eyes and uncover the inner realities of all things, become
proficient in every art and skill, and learn to comprehend the secrets of all
things even as they are -- this faculty being one of the clearly evident
effects of servitude to the Holy Threshold.

     It is certain that ye will make every effort to bring this about, will
also draw up plans for the opening of a number of schools.  These schools for
academic studies must at the same time be training centres in behaviour and
conduct, and they must favour character and conduct above the sciences and
arts.  Good behaviour and high moral character must come first, for unless the
character be trained, acquiring knowledge will only prove injurious.  Knowledge
is praiseworthy when it is coupled with ethical conduct and virtuous character;
otherwise it is a deadly poison, a frightful danger.  A physician of evil
character, and who betrayeth his trust, can bring on death, and become the
source of numerous infirmities and diseases.

                                    - 28 -
+P 29

     Devote ye the utmost attention to this matter, for the basic, the
foundation-principle of a school is first and foremost moral training,
character and the rectification of conduct.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [71]


     The All-Merciful hath created humankind for the adornment of this
contingent world, so that men may array the earth with the manifold blessings
of Heaven; that the inner reality of the human being may, like unto a lamp of
the spirit, cause the community of man to become as a mirror for the assemblage
on high.

     It is clear that learning is the greatest bestowal of God; that knowledge
and the acquirement thereof is a blessing from Heaven.  Thus is it incumbent
upon the friends of God to exert such an effort and strive with such eagerness
to promote divine knowledge, culture and the sciences, that erelong those who
are schoolchildren today will become the most erudite of all the fraternity of
the wise.  This is a service rendered unto God Himself, and it is one of His
inescapable commandments.

     Wherefore, O loving friends, strive with heart and soul and strength to
make the &amp;Tarbiyat School a center of enlightenment, and a well-spring of
truth, that the children of God may shine with the rays of boundless learning,
and that these tender plants of the divine garden may grow and flourish in the
grace that showereth down from the clouds of knowledge and true understanding,
and advance to such a degree as to astonish the company of those who know.

     I swear by the bounty of God's wisdom that if they win this great prize,
the members of the &amp;Tarbiyat School will be admitted to the assemblage of God,
and that unto them, beyond a peradventure, the portals of His grace will open
wide.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [72]


     God be praised that ye have succeeded in establishing a school in
&amp;Mihdiyabad and are, with great energy and enthusiasm, engaged in educating
the children.

     In this new and wondrous Cause, the advancement of all branches of
knowledge is a fixed and vital principle, and the friends, one and all, are
obligated to make every effort toward this end, so that the Cause of the
Manifest Light may be spread abroad, and that every child, according to his
need, will receive his share of the sciences and arts -- until not even a
single peasant's child will be found who is completely devoid of schooling.

                                    - 29 -
+P 30

     It is essential that the fundamentals of knowledge be taught; essential
that all should be able to read and write.  Wherefore is this new institution
most worthy of praise, and its programme to be encouraged.  The hope is that
other villages will take you for a model, and that in every village where there
is a certain number of believers, a school will be founded where the children
can study reading, writing, and basic knowledge.

     This is what bringeth joy to the heart of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, cheer and peace
to His soul.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [73]


     The method of instruction which ye have established, beginning with proofs
of the existence of God and the oneness of God, the mission of the Prophets and
Messengers and Their teachings, and the wonders of the universe, is highly
suitable.  Keep on with this.  It is certain that the confirmations of God will
attend you.  It is also highly praiseworthy to memorize the Tablets, divine
verses and sacred traditions.

     Ye will surely exert every effort in teaching, and in furthering
understanding.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [74]


     As to the children:  From the age of five their formal education must
begin.  That is, during the daytime they should be looked after in a place
where there are teachers, and should learn good conduct.

     Here they should be taught, in play, some letters and words and a little
reading -- as it is done in certain countries where they fashion letters and
words out of sweets and give them to the child.  For example, they make an "a"
out of candy and say its name is "a", or make a candy "b" and call it "b", and
so on with the rest of the alphabet, giving these to the young child.  In this
way, children will soon learn their letters...

     When the children are ready for bed, let the mother read or sing them the
Odes of the Blessed Beauty, so that from their earliest years they will be
educated by these verses of guidance.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [75]


     Thou didst ask as to the education of children.  Those children who,
sheltered by the Blessed Tree, have set foot upon the world, those who are
cradled in the Faith and are nurtured at the breast of grace -- such must from
the beginning receive spiritual training directly from their mothers.  That is,
the mother must continually call God to mind and make mention of Him, and tell

                                    - 30 -
+P 31

of His greatness, and instill the fear of Him in the child, and rear the child
gently, in the way of tenderness, and in extreme cleanliness.  Thus from the
very beginning of life every child will be refreshed by the gentle wafting of
the love of God and will tremble with joy at the sweet scent of heavenly
guidance.  In this lieth the beginning of the process; it is the essential
basis of all the rest.

     And when the child hath reached the age where he can make distinctions,
let him be placed in a &amp;Baha'i school, in which at the beginning the Holy
Texts are recited and religious concepts are taught.  At this school the child
is to study reading and writing as well as some fundamentals of the various
branches of knowledge, such as can be learned by children.

     At the start the teacher must place a pen in the child's hand, arrange the
children in groups, and instruct each group according to its capacity.  When
the children have, in a given place, been seated in rows, and each holdeth a
pen, and each hath a paper before him, and the teacher hath suspended a
blackboard in front of the children, let him write thereon with his chalk and
have the children copy what he hath written.  For example, let the teacher
write an alif ( a ) and say, "This is an alif." Let the children then copy it
and repeat:  "This is an alif." And so on, till the end of the alphabet.  As
soon as they properly recognize the letters, let the teacher make combinations
of the letters, while the children follow his lead, writing the combinations on
their paper, until, by this method, they come to recognize all the letters,
singly and combined in words.  Let the teacher then proceed to writing
sentences, while the children copy what he hath written, each on his own sheet
of paper.  Let the teacher then explain the meaning of the sentence to the
children.

     And once they have become skilled in the Persian tongue, let the teacher
first translate and write out single words and ask the students the meaning of
those words.  If a pupil hath grasped a little of this, and hath translated the
word, let the teacher praise him; if all the students are unable to accomplish
this, let the teacher write the foreign language translation beneath the given
word.  For example, let him write &amp;sama (heaven) in Arabic, and ask:  "How do
we say this in Persian?" If one of the children replieth, "The Persian
translation of this word is &amp;asiman", let the teacher praise and encourage
him.  If they are unable to answer, let the teacher himself give the
translation and write it down, and let the children copy it.

     Later, let the teacher ask:  "How do they say this in Russian, or French,
or Turkish?" If they know the answer, excellent.  If not, let the teacher say,
"In Russian, or French, the translation is thus and so", write the word on the
board, and have the children copy it down.  When the children have become
skilled in translating single words, let the teacher combine the words into a
sentence, write this on the board and ask the children to translate it.  If
they are unable, let the teacher himself translate the sentence and write down
the translation.  It would of course be preferable for him to make use of
several languages.

                                    - 31 -
+P 32

     In this way, over a short period -- that is, three years -- the children
will, as a result of writing the words down, become fully proficient in a
number of languages, and will be able to translate a passage from one language
to another.  Once they have become skilled in these fundamentals, let them go
on to learning the elements of the other branches of knowledge, and once they
have completed this study, let each one who is able and hath a keen desire for
it, enrol in higher institutions of learning and study advanced courses in the
sciences and arts.

     Not all, however, will be able to engage in these advanced studies.
Therefore, such children must be sent to industrial schools where they can also
acquire technical skills, and once the child becomes proficient in such a
skill, then let consideration be given to the child's own preference and
inclinations.  If a child hath a liking for commerce, then let him choose
commerce; if industry, then industry; if for higher education, then the
advancement of knowledge; if for some other of the responsibilities of
humankind, then that.  Let him be placed in the field for which he hath an
inclination, a desire, and a talent.

     But the indispensable basis of all is that he should develop spiritual
characteristics and the praiseworthy virtues of humankind.  This is the primary
consideration.  If a person be unlettered, and yet clothed with divine
excellence, and alive in the breaths of the Spirit, that individual will
contribute to the welfare of society, and his inability to read and write will
do him no harm.  And if a person be versed in the arts and every branch of
knowledge, and not live a religious life, and not take on the characteristics
of God, and not be directed by a pure intent, and be engrossed in the life of
the flesh -- then he is harm personified, and nothing will come of all his
learning and intellectual accomplishments but scandal and torment.

     If, however, an individual hath spiritual characteristics, and virtues
that shine out, and his purpose in life be spiritual and his inclinations be
directed toward God, and he also study other branches of knowledge -- then we
have light upon light:+F14his outer being luminous, his private character radiant,
 his heart sound, his thought elevated, his understanding swift, his rank
noble.

     Blessed is he who attaineth this exalted station.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [76]


     The subjects to be taught in children's school are many, and for lack of
time We can touch on only a few:  First and most important is training in
behaviour and good character; the rectification of qualities; arousing the
desire to become accomplished and acquire perfections, and to cleave unto the
religion of God and stand firm in His Laws:  to accord total obedience to every
just government, to show forth loyalty and trustworthiness to the ruler of the
time, to be well wishers of mankind, to be kind to all.

------------------------
14.  &amp;Qur'an 24:35
+P 33

     And further, as well as in the ideals of character, instruction in such
arts and sciences as are of benefit, and in foreign tongues. Also, the
repeating of prayers for the well-being of ruler and ruled; and the avoidance
of materialistic works that are current among those who see only natural
causation, and tales of love, and books that arouse the passions.

     To sum up, let all the lessons be entirely devoted to the acquisition of
human perfections.

     Here, then, in brief are directions for the curriculum of these schools.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [77]


     As to the organization of the schools:  If possible the children should
all wear the same kind of clothing, even if the fabric is varied.  It is
preferable that the fabric as well should be uniform; if, however, this is not
possible, there is no harm done.  The more cleanly the pupils are, the better;
they should be immaculate.  The school must be located in a place where the air
is delicate and pure.  The children must be carefully trained to be most
courteous and well-behaved.  They must be constantly encouraged and made eager
to gain all the summits of human accomplishment, so that from their earliest
years they will be taught to have high aims, to conduct themselves well, to be
chaste, pure, and undefiled, and will learn to be of powerful resolve and firm
of purpose in all things.  Let them not jest and trifle, but earnestly advance
unto their goals, so that in every situation they will be found resolute and
firm.

     Training in morals and good conduct is far more important than book
learning.  A child that is cleanly, agreeable, of good character, well-behaved
-- even though he be ignorant -- is preferable to a child that is rude,
unwashed, ill-natured, and yet becoming deeply versed in all the sciences and
arts.  The reason for this is that the child who conducts himself well, even
though he be ignorant, is of benefit to others, while an ill-natured,
ill-behaved child is corrupted and harmful to others, even though he be
learned.  If, however, the child be trained to be both learned and good, the
result is light upon light.

     Children are even as a branch that is fresh and green; they will grow up
in whatever way you train them.  Take the utmost care to give them high ideals
and goals, so that once they come of age, they will cast their beams like
brilliant candles on the world, and will not be defiled by lusts and passions
in the way of animals, heedless and unaware, but instead will set their hearts
on achieving everlasting honour and acquiring all the excellences of humankind.
          ("Selections from the Writings of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 110,
           pp. 135-36)                                                    [78]


     As to the education of children, exert every effort to further this; it is
of the utmost importance.  So too, the education of girls in all the rules of

                                    - 33 -
+P 34

righteous conduct, that they may grow up with a good character and high
standards of behaviour.  For mothers are the first educators of the child, and
every child at the beginning of life is like a fresh and tender branch in his
parents' hands.  His father and mother can train him in any way they choose.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [79]


     The school for girls taketh precedence over the school for boys, for it is
incumbent upon the girls of this glorious era to be fully versed in the various
branches of knowledge, in sciences and the arts and all the wonders of this
pre-eminent time, that they may then educate their children and train them from
their earliest days in the ways of perfection.

     If, as she ought, the mother possesseth the learning and accomplishments
of humankind, her children, like unto angels, will be fostered in all
excellence, in right conduct and beauty.  Therefore the School for Girls that
hath been established in that place must be made the object of the deep concern
and high endeavours of the friends.  The teachers of that school are handmaids
close to the Sacred Threshold, for they are of those who, obedient to the
commandments of the Blessed Beauty, have arisen to educate the girl children.

     The day will come when those children will be mothers, and each one of
them in her deep gratitude will offer up prayers and supplications to Almighty
God and ask that her teachers will be granted joy and well-being forever, and a
high station in the Kingdom of God.

     Name ye this school the Mawhibat School (The School of Bounty).
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [80]


     Our hearts rejoiced at thy letter concerning a school for girls.

     Praised be God that there is now a school of this type in &amp;Tihran where
young maidens can, through His bounty, receive an education and with all vigour
acquire the accomplishments of humankind.  Erelong will women in every field
keep pace with the men.

     Until now, in Persia, the means for women's advancement were non-existent.
But now, God be thanked, ever since the dawning of the Morn of Salvation, they
have been going forward day by day.  The hope is that they will take the lead
in virtues and attainments, in closeness to the Court of Almighty God, in faith
and certitude -- and that the women of the East will become the envy of the
women of the West.

     Praised be God, thou art confirmed in thy service, art exerting every
effort in this work and taking great pains; and so, too, the teacher in the
school, Miss Lillian Kappes.  Give her my most affectionate greetings.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [81]

+P 35

     In past centuries the girl children of Persia were deprived of all
instruction.  They had neither school nor academy, no kindly tutor and no
teacher.  Now in this greatest of centuries the bounty of the All-Bountiful
hath encompassed the girls as well, and many schools have been founded in
Persia for the education of girl children -- but what is missing from them is
character training, and this despite the fact that such training is more
important than instruction, for it is the primary accomplishment of humankind.

     Praised be God, a school for girls hath now been established in &amp;Hamadan.
Ye who are the teachers thereof must devote more of your efforts to character
training than instruction, and must raise up your girl children to be modest
and chaste, of good character and conduct -- and in addition must teach them
the various branches of knowledge.

     If ye follow this course, the confirmations of the All-Glorious Kingdom,
in a great rolling swell, will rise and surge above that school.

     My hope is that ye will succeed in this.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [82]


     In this holy Cause the question of orphans hath the utmost importance.
The greatest consideration must be shown towards orphans; they must be taught,
trained and educated.  The Teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah, especially, must by all
means be given to them as far as is possible.

     I supplicate God that thou mayest become a kind parent to orphaned
children, quickening them with the fragrances of the Holy Spirit, so that they
will attain the age of maturity as true servants of the world of humanity and
as bright candles in the assemblage of mankind.
          ("Selections from the Writings of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 112, p. 138)
                                                                          [83]


     Your letter hath come and hath occasioned the utmost joy, with its news
that, praised be God, in &amp;Hamadan a welfare and relief association hath been
established.  I trust that this will become a source of general prosperity and
assistance, and that means will be provided to set the hearts of the poor and
weak at rest, and to educate the orphans and other children.

     The question of training the children and looking after the orphans is
extremely important, but most important of all is the education of girl
children, for these girls will one day be mothers, and the mother is the first
teacher of the child.  In whatever way she reareth the child, so will the child
become, and the results of that first training will remain with the individual
throughout his entire life, and it would be most difficult to alter them.  And

                                    - 35 -
+P 36

how can a mother, herself ignorant and untrained, educate her child?  It is
therefore clear that the education of girls is of far greater consequence than
that of boys.  This fact is extremely important, and the matter must be seen to
with the greatest energy and dedication.

     God sayeth in the &amp;Qur'an that they shall not be equals, those who have
knowledge and those who have it not.+F15Ignorance is thus utterly to be blamed,
 whether in male or female; indeed, in the female its harm is greater.  I hope,
therefore, that the friends will make strenuous efforts to educate their
children, sons and daughters alike.  This is verily the truth, and outside the
truth there is manifestly naught save perdition.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)        [84]


     Thou didst write about the believers' daughters who attend the schools of
other faiths.  It is true that, while these children do learn a little in such
schools, still the character and behaviour of the women teachers have an effect
on them, and through the inculcation of doubts and ambiguities, the minds of
these girls are influenced and changed.

     It is incumbent upon the friends to provide a school for &amp;Baha'i girls
whose women teachers will educate their pupils according to the teachings of
God.  There must the girls be taught spiritual ethics and holy ways.

     A child is as a young plant:  it will grow in whatever way you train it.
If you rear it to be truthful, and kind, and righteous, it will grow straight,
it will be fresh and tender, and will flourish.  But if not, then from faulty
training it will grow bent, and stand awry, and there will be no hope of
changing it.

     Certainly, the women teachers from Europe give instruction in language and
scripts, and housekeeping, and embroidery and sewing; but their pupils'
character is completely altered, to such a point that the girls no longer care
for their mothers, their disposition is spoiled, they misbehave, they become
self-satisfied and proud.

     Rather, girls ought to be trained in such a manner that from day to day
they will become more self-effacing, more humble, and will defer to and obey
their parents and forebears, and be a comfort and a solace to all.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [85]


     Consider that if the mother is a believer, the children will become
believers too, even if the father denieth the Faith; while, if the mother is
not a believer, the children are deprived of faith, even if the father be a
believer convinced and firm.  Such is the usual outcome, except in rare cases.

15.   &amp;Qur'an 39:12
+P 37

     For this reason both fathers and mothers must carefully watch over their
little daughters and have them thoroughly taught in the schools by highly
qualified women teachers, so that they may familiarize themselves with all the
sciences and arts and become acquainted with and reared in all that is
necessary for human living, and will provide a family with comfort and joy.

     It is therefore incumbent upon the Spiritual Assembly of &amp;Ishqabad to
take the lead in this most urgent matter, so that by the grace and favour of
God they may establish an institution which will be a source of security and
happiness forever and ever.
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [86]


     O handmaids of the beauty of &amp;Abha!  Your letter hath come, and its perusal
brought great joy.  Praised be God, the women believers have organized meetings
where they will learn how to teach the Faith, will spread the sweet savours of
the Teachings and make plans for training the children.

     This gathering must be completely spiritual.  That is, the discussions
must be confined to marshalling clear and conclusive proofs that the Sun of
Truth hath indeed arisen.  And further, those present should concern themselves
with every means of training the girl children; with teaching the various
branches of knowledge, good behaviour, a proper way of life, the cultivation of
a good character, chastity and constancy, perseverance, strength,
determination, firmness of purpose; with household management, the education of
children, and whatever especially applieth to the needs of girls -- to the end
that these girls, reared in the stronghold of all perfections, and with the
protection of a goodly character, will, when they themselves become mothers,
bring up their children from earliest infancy to have a good character and
conduct themselves well.

     Let them also study whatever will nurture the health of the body and its
physical soundness, and how to guard their children from disease.

     When matters are thus well arranged, every child will become a peerless
plant in the gardens of the &amp;Abha Paradise.
          ("Selections from the Writings of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 94, pp.123-24)

     Today it is obligatory for the loved ones of God, and their imperative
duty, to educate the children in reading, writing, the various branches of
knowledge, and the expansion of consciousness, that on all levels they may go
forward day by day.

     The mother is the first teacher of the child.  For children, at the
beginning of life, are fresh and tender as a young twig, and can be trained in
any fashion you desire.  If you rear the child to be straight, he will grow
straight, in perfect symmetry.  It is clear that the mother is the first
teacher and that it is she who establisheth the character and conduct of the
child.

     Wherefore, O ye loving mothers, know ye that in God's sight, the best of
all ways to worship Him is to educate the children and train them in all the
perfections of humankind; and no nobler deed than this can be imagined.+F16
          (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)                   [88]


O Handmaids of the Lord!

     The spiritual assemblage that ye established in that illumined city is
most propitious.  Ye have made great strides; ye have surpassed the others,
have arisen to serve the Holy Threshold, and have won heavenly bestowals.  Now
with all spiritual zeal must ye gather in that enlightened assemblage and
recite the Holy Writings and engage in remembering the Lord.  Set ye forth His
arguments and proofs.  Work ye for the guidance of the women in that land,
teach the young girls and the children,so that the mothers may educate their
little ones from their earliest days, thoroughly train them, rear them to have
a goodly character and good morals, guide them to all the virtues of humankind,
prevent the development of any behaviour that would be worthy of blame, and
foster them in the embrace of &amp;Baha'i education.  Thus shall these tender
infants be nurtured at the breast of the knowledge of God and His love.  Thus
shall they grow and flourish, and be taught righteousness and the dignity of
humankind, resolution and the will to strive and to endure.  Thus shall they
learn perseverance in all things, the will to advance, high-mindedness and high
resolve, chastity and purity of life.  Thus shall they be enabled to carry to a
successful conclusion whatsoever they undertake.

     Let the mothers consider that whatever concerneth the education of
children is of the first importance.  Let them put forth every effort in this
regard, for when the bough is green and tender it will grow in whatever way ye
train it.  Therefore is it incumbent upon the mothers to rear their little ones
even as a gardener tendeth his young plants.  Let them strive by day and by
night to establish within their children faith and certitude, the fear of God,
the love of the Beloved of the worlds, and all good qualities and traits.
Whensoever a mother seeth that her child hath done well, let her praise and
applaud him and cheer his heart; and if the slightest undesirable trait should
manifest itself, let her counsel the child and punish him, and use means based
on reason, even a slight verbal chastisement should this be necessary.  It is
not, however, permissible to strike a child, or vilify him, for the child's
character will be totally perverted if he be subjected to blows or verbal
abuse.

     The Sunday school for the children in which the Tablets and Teachings of
&amp;Baha'u'llah are read, and the Word of God is recited for the children is
indeed a blessed thing.  Thou must certainly continue this organized activity
without cessation, and attach importance to it, so that day by day it may grow
and be quickened with the breaths of the Holy Spirit.  If this activity is well
organized, rest thou assured that it will yield great results.  Firmness and
steadfastness, however, are necessary, otherwise it will continue for some
time, but later be gradually forgotten.  Perseverance is an essential
condition.  In every project firmness and steadfastness will undoubtedly lead
to good results; otherwise it will exist for some days, and then be
discontinued.

O ye children of the the Kingdom:

     Your letters with your photographs have been received.  From the perusal
of the letters the utmost heartfelt emotions were experienced and at the sight
of the portraits a spiritual joy and gladness was felt.  Praise be to God the
letters were indicative of the turning of the faces toward the Kingdom and from
those faces it was evident that the light of the love of God is manifest and
resplendent upon the brows.

     I pray to God that in this school on Sundays ye may acquire heavenly
knowledge, ye may secure a training of merciful characteristics and that ye may
advance from day to day so that each of you may become a peerless shrub in the
Divine Rose-garden and may be adorned with full foliage, and fruits.

and of the heart; that each one of you will grow as a tree rich in yield, fair,
fresh and strong, heavy with sweet fruit.

+P 41

     May the hidden confirmations of God make each one of you to become a
well-spring of knowledge.  May your hearts ever receive inspiration from the
Denizens of the Concourse on high.  May the drop become as the great sea; may
the mote dazzle as the shining sun.

     His Holiness the &amp;Bab hath said:  "Should a tiny ant desire in this day to
be possessed of such power as to be able to unravel the abstrusest and most
bewildering passages of the &amp;Qur'an, its wish will no doubt be fulfilled,
inasmuch as the mystery of eternal might vibrates within the innermost being of
all created things."+F20If so helpless a creature can be endowed with so subtle
a capacity, how much more efficacious must be the power released through the
liberal effusions of the grace of &amp;Baha'u'llah!  What confirmations will be
garnered, what influxes of the heart!

     Wherefore, O ye illumined youth, strive by night and by day to unravel the
mysteries of the mind and spirit, and to grasp the secrets of the Day of God.
Inform yourselves of the evidences that the Most Great Name hath dawned.  Open
your lips in praise.  Adduce convincing arguments and proofs.  Lead those who
thirst to the fountain of life; grant ye true health to the ailing.  Be ye
apprentices of God; be ye physicians directed by God, and heal ye the sick
among humankind.  Bring those who have been excluded into the circle of
intimate friends.  Make the despairing to be filled with hope.  Waken them that
slumber; make the heedless mindful.

     Such are the fruits of this earthly life.  Such is the station of
resplendent glory.

III. FROM THE WRITINGS OF SHOGHI EFFENDI AND LETTERS WRITTEN ON HIS BEHALF:


     For the members of the Children's Educational Work Committee ... I
supplicate Divine Assistance, that He may graciously aid them in a work which
was so near and dear to the Master's heart and enable them to assist in the
rise of future devoted and efficient servants to the Cause of God.

     They must promote by every means in their power the material as well as
the spiritual enlightenment of youth, the means for the education of children,
institute, whenever possible, &amp;Baha'i educational institutions, organize and
supervise their work and provide the best means for their progress and
development.
          (From a letter dated 12 March 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the
           &amp;Baha'is of America, Australasia, France, Germany, British Isles,
           Italy, Japan and Switzerland, published in "&amp;Baha'i Administration:
           Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 38)                           [99]


     As to the spiritual activities of the "Children of the Kingdom" in
America, my hope and prayer is that they may grow to become efficient servants
of the Cause of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  Their devotion and self-sacrifice, their
readiness to help the cause of the &amp;Baha'i Temple, their activity in
connection with the "&amp;Baha'i Magazine" are all unmistakable signs of the
glorious future of the Cause in that land.  May the care and loving-kindness of
the Heavenly Father guide them, protect them and aid them in their future
mission in life.

     A basic and vital requirement of these days is the matter of educating the
boys and girls.  One of the duties devolving upon the members of Spiritual
Assemblies is that, with the support of the friends, they should exert all
their powers to establish schools for the instruction of boys and girls in the
things of the spirit, the fundamentals of teaching the Faith, reading the
Sacred Writings, learning the history of the Faith, the secular branches of
knowledge, the various arts and skills, and the different languages -- so that
&amp;Baha'i methods of instruction will become so widely known that children from
every level of society will seek to acquire divine teachings as well as secular
knowledge in &amp;Baha'i schools, and thereby means for the promotion of the Cause
of God will be provided.

     The "Magazine of the Children of the Kingdom", the latest issue of which I
have just received from that indefatigable pioneer of your cause, ... has
kindled in me such fresh hopes that I feel moved to send you this message of
love and confidence in the great part you are destined to play for the future
of the Cause.

     I feel it is urgent and important that this first and only organ of the
&amp;Baha'i youth throughout the world should, in whatever it publishes, instil in
its readers, and particularly in every &amp;Baha'i child, the sense of his unique
opportunities and future responsibilities in the great task that awaits him in
future.

     Its duty is to initiate, promote and mirror forth the various activities
of the rising generation throughout the &amp;Baha'i world, to establish and
strengthen a bond of true fellowship amongst all the children of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha
whether in the East or in the West, and to unfold to their eyes the vision of a
golden future before them.  It should impress upon their hearts the vital
necessity of establishing, now, whilst in their tender age, a firm foundation
for their mission in life.

     The cause of the Children of the Kingdom, whom the Master so loved, and on
whom He showered many a blessing and infinite loving-kindness, is, I assure
you, still dear and close to our hearts.  In you, the descendants of the heroic
pioneers of a world Movement, rests the hope of achieving the task which they
have so nobly begun -- their task for the service and salvation of all mankind.

     As to my humble share of service and support, I can but pray on your
behalf, and supplicate during my hours of prayer at the three Holy Shrines, the
guidance, the blessings, and the assistance of &amp;Baha'u'llah, beseeching Him
most fervently to enable you, in the happy days to come, to establish His
Kingdom and fulfil His Word.

     May your Magazine inspire you to achieve this end.
          (From a Letter dated 30 December 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to
           the Magazine of the Children of the Kingdom, Boston, U.S.A)    [102]


&amp;Abdu'l-Baha has always attached very great importance to the education of
children and we take this opportunity to congratulate you on your signal
success in this field of service.  We hope some day your work will extend into
the East extensively where it is so badly needed.
          (From a letter dated 9 April 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi

     In connection with the question that you had asked as to whether you
should take a trip to the Holy Land or keep the sum to defray the expense of a
young man you are educating.  Shoghi Effendi wishes me to write you that

family, to welcome you in the home of our beloved Master and to share with you
the eternal outpourings of His Grace in and around His blessed Shrine, he deems
it of greater importance for you to keep up helping the young boy whom you have
undertaken to educate.  This he would advise you with a deep realization of
&amp;Baha'u'llah's most pregnant utterance that he who educates his child or
another's it is just as though he is educating a child of &amp;Baha'u'llah
Himself.
          (From a letter dated 29 May 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi

     Among the sacred obligations devolving upon the Spiritual Assemblies is
the promotion of learning, the establishing of schools and creation of the
necessary academic equipment and facilities for every boy and girl.

     Every child, without exception, must from his earliest years make a
thorough study of the art of reading and writing, and according to his own
tastes and inclinations and the degree of his capacity and powers, devote
extreme diligence to the acquisition of learning beneficial arts and skills,
various languages, speech, and contemporary technology.

     To assist the children of the poor in the attainment of these
accomplishments, and particularly in learning the basic subjects, is incumbent
upon the members of the Spiritual Assemblies, and is accounted as one of the
obligations laid upon the conscience of the trustees of God in every land.

     Shoghi Effendi was very interested to hear of the plans you are making for
the education of your children.  He hopes that they will all grow to be ardent
adherents of the &amp;Baha'i Cause, able servants of the Blessed Threshold, and
eloquent speakers on religious and social subjects.  He desires to be
remembered to them as well as to their dear father.

     We had heard through various channels the wonderful way your children had
grown to speak about the Cause in public.  Shoghi Effendi's hope is that they
will, the three of them, become able and devoted speakers on the Cause and
subjects akin to it.  To do this properly they will need a firm foundation of
scientific and literary training which fortunately they are obtaining.  It is
just as important for the &amp;Baha'i young boys and girls to become properly

     Let them, freely and without charge, open the doors of their schools and
their higher institutions for the study of sciences and the liberal arts, to
&amp;non-Baha'i children and youth who are poor and in need.

...and next is the propagation of learning and the promulgation of
&amp;Baha'i rules of conduct, practices and laws.  At this time, when the nation
has awakened out of its sleep of negligence, and the Government has begun to
consider the promotion and expansion of its educational establishment, let the
&amp;Baha'i representatives in that country arise in such a manner that as a
result of their high endeavours in every hamlet, village and town, of every
province and district, preliminary measures will be taken for the setting up of
institutions for the study of sciences, the liberal arts and religion.  Let
&amp;Baha'i children without any exceptions learn the fundamentals of reading and
writing and familiarize themselves with the rules of conduct, the customs,
practices and laws as set forth in the Book of God; and let them, in the new
branches of knowledge, in the arts and technology of the day, in pure and
praiseworthy characteristics -- &amp;Baha'i conduct, the &amp;Baha'i way of life --
become so distinguished above the rest that all other communities, whether
Islamic, Zoroastrian, Christian, Judaic or materialist, will of their own
volition and most gladly enter their children in such advanced &amp;Baha'i
institutions of learning and entrust them to the care of &amp;Baha'i instructors.

     So too is the promotion and execution of the laws set forth in the Book of
God.

He perused it with deep interest and charged me to thank you on his behalf and

academic studies.  Being a &amp;Baha'i you are certainly aware of the fact that
&amp;Baha'u'llah considered education as one of the most fundamental factors of a
true civilization.  This education, however, in order to be adequate and
fruitful, should be comprehensive in nature and should take into consideration
not only the physical and the intellectual side of man but also his spiritual
and ethical aspects.  This should be the programme of the &amp;Baha'i youth all
over the world.
          (From a letter dated 9 July 1931 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi
           to an individual believer)                                     [109]


We hope that before long the &amp;Baha'is will even afford to have schools that
would provide the children the intellectual and spiritual education as
prescribed in the writings of &amp;Baha'u'llah and the Master.
          (From a letter dated 25 December 1931 written on behalf of Shoghi
           Effendi to the Local Spiritual Assembly of New York City)      [110]


     He is very glad to know that you attach importance to the training of the
children, for whatever they learn in that early stage of their development will
leave its traces upon their whole life.  It becomes part of their nature.

     There is no especial book which the Guardian can recommend.  It is for the
older friends to attempt a compilation that would suit that purpose, and after
many attempts a good one will ultimately be produced.

     The Master used to attach much importance to the learning by heart of
Tablets of &amp;Baha'u'llah and the &amp;Bab.  During His days it was a usual work of
the children of the household to learn Tablets by heart; now, however, those
children are grown up and do not have time for such a thing.  But the practice
is most useful to implant the ideas and spirit those words contain into the
mind of the children.

     With "The Dawn-Breakers" in your possession you could also arrange
interesting stories about the early days of the Movement which the children
would like to hear.  There are also stories about the life of Christ, &amp;Muhammad
and the other prophets which if told to the children will break down any
religious prejudice they may have learned from older people of little
understanding.

     Such stories regarding the life of different prophets together with their
sayings will also be useful to better understand the literature of the Cause
for there is constant reference to them.  It is however the work of experienced
people to bring together such materials and make of them interesting text books
for the children.

     The Cause will gradually produce people who would answer these needs.  It
is only a question of time. What we should strive to do is to stimulate
different individuals who have the talent to attempt the task.

     He was deeply gratified to hear that the friends are attaching such a
great importance to the teaching and training of &amp;Baha'i children.  The
education of the youth is, undoubtedly, of paramount importance as it serves to
deepen their understanding of the Cause and to canalize their energies along
the most profitable lines.  Inasmuch, however, as the national expenses of the
Cause in America are daily increasing, the members of your Committee should be
very careful not to extend beyond their financial resources the sphere of their
activities.  The plans your Committee has made should not develop to such an
extent as to hamper the progress of the Temple work.

     Shoghi Effendi wishes you particularly to give all your attention to the
education of your boys so that they may become sincere, loyal and active
&amp;Baha'is.  It is to the youth that we should look for help, and it is,
therefore, the sacred obligation of the parents to provide their children with
a thorough &amp;Baha'i training.

He was deeply gratified to learn that your material conditions are improving
and he sincerely hopes that they will give you an opportunity to give to ...
and ... the best educational training, so that they may become, in a not
distant future, devoted servants and champions of the Cause.

     Your responsibility as a mother, and especially as a &amp;Baha'i mother,
whose sacred obligation is to look after the training of the children along
&amp;Baha'i lines, is indeed immense.  It is hoped that through God's help and
guidance you will be enabled to fully discharge your duties.
          (From a letter dated 22 July 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi

     Shoghi Effendi was deeply saddened to learn from your letter... of the
rather serious situation which your daughter's conduct and her general attitude
towards the Cause have created...

     Although he highly deplores this fact, and is fully aware of the bad
repercussions which it may have on the Cause, yet he feels that nothing short
of your motherly care and love and of the counsels which you and the friends
can give her, can effectively remedy this situation.  Above all, you should be

                                    - 47 -
+P 48

patient, and confident that your efforts to that end are being sustained and
guided through the confirmations of &amp;Baha'u'llah.  He is surely hearing your
prayers, and will no doubt accept them, and thus hasten the gradual and
complete materialization of your hopes and expectations for your daughter and
for the Cause.

     The Guardian would advise you, therefore, not to take any drastic action
with regard to your daughter's attendance at the meetings...  For in this way
there is much greater chance to reform her character than through force or any
other drastic method.  Love and kindness have far greater influence than
punishment upon the improvement of human character.

     The Guardian, therefore, trusts that by this means you will succeed in
gradually introducing a fundamental change in your daughter's life, and also in
making of her a better and truer believer.  He is fervently praying on her
behalf that she may fully attain this station.
          (From a letter dated 26 January 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi

     The Guardian sees no objection that reference be made to the fact that the
teaching classes and conferences which the believers are now organizing might
evolve in the distant future into departments of education, or such
institutions of learning as will be established in the future &amp;Baha'i social
order.

     As regards your plans:  the Guardian fully approves indeed of your view
that no matter how urgent and vital the requirements of the teaching work may
be you should under no circumstances neglect the education of your children, as
towards them you have an obligation no less sacred than towards the Cause.

     Any plan or arrangement you may arrive at which would combine your twofold
duties towards your family and the Cause, and would permit you to resume active
work in the field of pioneer teaching, and also to take good care of your
children so as to not jeopardize their future in the Cause would meet with the
whole-hearted approval of the Guardian.

     The Guardian wishes me to assure you, in particular, of his supplications
on behalf of your children, that they may, through Divine confirmations and

them with the necessary spiritual equipment to effectively and loyally serve

     As a &amp;Baha'i mother you have certainly a most sacred and weighty
responsibility for their spiritual development in the Cause, and you should
from now endeavour to instil into their hearts the love of &amp;Baha'u'llah and
thus prepare them for the full recognition and acceptance of His Station once
they attain the age and capacity to do so.

     With regard to your activities in connection with the training and
education of &amp;Baha'i children:  needless to tell you what a vital importance
the Guardian attaches to such activities, on which so much of the strength,
welfare and growth of the Community must necessarily depend.  What a more
sacred privilege, and also what a weightier responsibility than the task of
rearing up the new generation of believers, and of inculcating into their
youthful and receptive minds the principles and teachings of the Cause, and of
thus preparing them to fully assume, and properly discharge the weighty
responsibilities and obligations of their future life in the &amp;Baha'i
Community.
          (From a letter dated 28 April, 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi
           Effendi to a National Committee and an individual believer)    [120]


     You have asked him for detailed information concerning the &amp;Baha'i
educational programme:  there is as yet no such thing as a &amp;Baha'i curriculum,
and there are no &amp;Baha'i publications exclusively devoted to this subject,
since the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha do not present a
definite and detailed educational system, but simply offer certain basic
principles and set forth a number of teaching ideals that should guide future
&amp;Baha'i educationalists in their efforts to formulate an adequate teaching
curriculum which would be in full harmony with the spirit of the &amp;Baha'i
Teachings, and would thus meet the requirements and needs of the modern age.

     These basic principles are available in the sacred writings of the Cause,
and should be carefully studied, and gradually incorporated in various college
and university programmes.  But the task of formulating a system of education
which would be officially recognized by the Cause, and enforced as such
throughout the &amp;Baha'i world is one which [the] present-day generation of
believers cannot obviously undertake, and which has to be gradually
accomplished by &amp;Baha'i scholars and educationalists of the future.
          (From a letter dated 7 June, 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi

     With regard to the statement attributed to &amp;Abdu'l-Baha and which you
have quoted in your letter regarding a "problem child":  these statements of
the Master, however true in their substance, should never be given a literal
interpretation.  &amp;Abdu'l-Baha could have never meant that a child should be
left to himself, entirely free.  In fact &amp;Baha'i education, just like any
other system of education, is based on the assumption that there are certain
natural deficiencies in every child, no matter how gifted, which his educators,

whether his parents, schoolmasters, or his spiritual guides and preceptors,
should endeavour to remedy.  Discipline of some sort, whether physical, moral
or intellectual, is indeed indispensable, and no training can be said to be
complete and fruitful if it disregards this element.  The child when born is
far from being perfect.  It is not only helpless, but actually is imperfect,
and even is naturally inclined towards evil.  He should be trained, his
natural inclinations harmonized, adjusted and controlled, and if necessary
suppressed or regulated, so as to ensure his healthy physical and moral
development.  &amp;Baha'i parents cannot simply adopt an attitude of
non-resistance towards their children, particularly those who are unruly and
violent by nature.  It is not even sufficient that they should pray on their
behalf.  Rather they should endeavour to inculcate, gently and patiently, into
their youthful minds such principles of moral conduct and initiate them into
the principles and teachings of the Cause with such tactful and loving care as
would enable them to become "true sons of God" and develop into loyal and
intelligent citizens of His Kingdom.  This is the high purpose which
&amp;Baha'u'llah Himself has clearly defined as the chief goal of every education.
          (From a letter dated 9 July 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi
           to an individual believer)                                     [122]


     The task of bringing up a &amp;Baha'i child, as emphasized time and again in
&amp;Baha'i writings, is the chief responsibility of the mother, whose unique
privilege is indeed to create in her home such conditions as would be most
conducive to both his material and spiritual welfare and advancement.  The
training which a child first receives through his mother constitutes the
strongest foundation for his future development, and it should therefore be the
paramount concern of your wife...to endeavour from now imparting to her
new-born son such spiritual training as would enable him later on to fully
assume and adequately discharge all the responsibilities and duties of &amp;Baha'i
life.
          (From a letter dated 16 November 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi

     With regard to your little daughter ...; he is truly rejoiced and
encouraged to realize how eager you both are to provide her with a thoroughly
&amp;Baha'i training, and is confident that under your wise and devoted care, and
through the unfailing protection and guidance of &amp;Baha'u'llah she will in time
develop into a devoted and loyal servant of the Faith.

     With this in mind, the Guardian thinks it would be preferable not to place
the child in a purely Catholic institution, and to give her instead a broad
spiritual and intellectual training that would enable her, at a later age, to
fully appreciate the spirit of the Cause.  While it should be your constant
endeavour to bring her up in a thoroughly religious atmosphere, you should also
be careful in keeping her away from all such influences that would tend to
breed in her the spirit of religious bigotry, and thus narrow down the horizon
of her spiritual understanding.

     With reference to the question of the training of children:  given the
emphasis placed by &amp;Baha'u'llah and &amp;Abdu'l-Baha on the necessity for the
parents to train their children while still in their tender age, it would seem
preferable that they should receive their first training at home at the hand of
their mother, rather than be sent to a nursery.  Should circumstances, however,
compel a &amp;Baha'i mother to adopt the latter course there can be no objection.

     The question of the training and education of children in case one of the
parents is a &amp;non-Baha'i is one which solely concerns the parents themselves,
who should decide about it the way they find best and most conducive to the
maintenance of the unity of their family, and to the future welfare of their
children.  Once the child comes of age, however, he should be given full
freedom to choose his religion, irrespective of the wishes and desires of his
parents.

     The Guardian was delighted to hear of your youth group.  The children who
are trained in the world-embracing teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah cannot but grow
up to be a truly new race of men.  He hopes these young people will prepare

     These &amp;Baha'i children are of such great importance to the future.  They
will live in times, and have to meet problems, which never faced their elders.
And the Cause alone can equip them to properly serve the needs of a future,
war-weary, disillusioned, unhappy humanity.  So their task will be very great

upbringing and preparation.

of the sentences and thoughts combined in &amp;Baha'i writings of a devotional
nature are easy to grasp, and the revealed Word is endowed with a power of its
own.

great obligations ahead of you, for your generation will be the ones to help
build up a new, better and more beautiful world after the dark years of this
war are passed.  You should prepare yourselves for this great task by trying to
grasp the true meaning of the teachings and not just merely accepting them as
something you are taught.  They are like a wonderful new world of thought just

     Regarding your question about children fighting:  the statement of the
Master, not to strike back, should not be taken so extremely literally that

     You ask him about the fear of God:  perhaps the friends do not realize
that the majority of human beings need the element of fear in order to
discipline their conduct?  Only a relatively very highly evolved soul would
always be disciplined by love alone.  Fear of punishment, fear of the anger of
God if we do evil, are needed to keep people's feet on the right path.  Of
course we should love God -- but we must fear Him in the sense of a child
fearing the righteous anger and chastisement of a parent; not cringe before
Him as before a tyrant, but know His mercy exceeds His justice!

or of teaching it to children.  This is not part of the &amp;Baha'i Faith, but a
Christian practice, and as the Cause embraces members of all races and
religions we should be careful not to introduce into it the customs of our
previous beliefs.  &amp;Baha'u'llah has given us the obligatory prayers, also
prayers before sleeping, for travellers, etc.  We should not introduce a new
set of prayers He has not specified, when He has given us already so many, for
so many occasions.

     Any &amp;Baha'i can give to the Cause's Funds, adult or child.  No statement
is required on this subject; &amp;Baha'i children have always given to the Cause,
everywhere.  Whatever situation may arise in a class which non- &amp;Baha'i
children attend is for the teacher of the class to solve.  No ruling should be
made to cover such things.

The general principle ... is that a request for excuse from School sessions on
&amp;Baha'i Holy Days is desirable.  This applies to all &amp;Baha'i children
regardless of their age.  Children of &amp;Baha'i parents, under the age of 15,
are considered &amp;Baha'is.

     What a &amp;Baha'i parent or your Assembly should do is apply to the School
Board to grant to their children permission to remain away from School on
&amp;Baha'i Holy Days, and then abide by whatever decision the School Board may
make, and not try in any way to force the matter.

     The beloved Guardian was greatly delighted to learn of the success of the
institute for teaching the Indian children.  He feels this is a very fine
method of implanting the teachings of the Faith in the hearts and the minds of
the young children, so that they may grow and develop into strong and virile
men and women who will serve the Cause.  Likewise through this effort, he hopes
you will be able to attract some of the parents.

     The Guardian will pray for the spiritual development of your dear son.  On
the shoulders of the youth today rests the future of the Faith.  Therefore they
should be well educated and trained not only in the Teachings of the Faith, but
also in secular matters.

     The Guardian is happy to see you are teaching the children, as a firm
foundation of the Teachings in their minds will greatly assist in forming their
characters, and enable them to become well-balanced and useful believers when
they mature.

     In explaining the fear of God to children, there is no objection to
teaching it as &amp;Abdu'l-Baha so often taught everything, in the form of
parables.  Also the child should be made to understand that we don't fear God
because He is cruel, but we fear Him because He is just, and, if we do wrong
and deserve to be punished, then in His justice He may see fit to punish us.
We must both love God and fear Him.

IV. EXTRACTS FROM THE TALKS OF &amp;ABDU'L-BAHA:

     Among these children many blessed souls will arise, if they be trained
according to the &amp;Baha'i Teachings.  If a plant is carefully nurtured by a
gardener, it will become good, and produce better fruit.  These children must
be given a good training from their earliest childhood.  They must be given a
systematic training which will further their development from day to day, in
order that they may receive greater insight, so that their spiritual
receptivity be broadened.  Beginning in childhood they must receive
instruction.  They cannot be taught through books.  Many elementary sciences
must be made clear to them in the nursery; they must learn them in play, in
amusement.  Most ideas must be taught them through speech, not by book
learning.  One child must question the other concerning these things, and the
other child must give the answer.  In this way, they will make great progress.
For example, mathematical problems must also be taught in the form of questions
and answers.  One of the children asks a question and the other must give the
answer.  Later on, the children will of their own accord speak with each other
concerning these same subjects.  The children who are at the head of the class
must receive premiums.  They must be encouraged and when any one of them shows
good advancement, for the further development they must be praised and
encouraged therein.  Even so in Godlike affairs.  Oral questions must be asked
and the answers must be given orally.  They must discuss with each other in
this manner.
          ("The &amp;Baha'i World", Vol. 9 (1940-1944)(Wilmette: &amp;Baha'i
           Publishing Committee, 1945), p. 543)                           [145]


     Educate the children in their infancy in such a way that they may become
exceedingly kind and merciful to the animals.  If the animal is sick they
should endeavour to cure it; if it is hungry they should feed it; if it is
thirsty, they should satisfy its thirst; if it is tired they should give it
rest.

     Man is generally sinful and the animal is innocent; unquestionably one
must be more kind and merciful to the innocent.  The harmful animals, such as
the bloodthirsty wolf, the poisonous snake and other injurious animals are
excepted, because mercy towards these is cruelty to man, and other animals.
          ("The &amp;Baha'i World", Vol. 9, p. 544)                           [146]


The art of music is divine and effective.  It is the food of the soul and
spirit.  Through the power and charm of music the spirit of man is uplifted.
It has wonderful sway and effect in the hearts of children, for their hearts
are pure and melodies have great influence in them.  The latent talents with
which the hearts of these children are endowed will find expression through the
medium of music.  Therefore, you must exert yourselves to make them proficient;
teach them to sing with excellence and effect.  It is incumbent upon each child
to know something of music, for without knowledge of this art the melodies of

instrument and voice cannot be rightly enjoyed.  Likewise, it is necessary that
the schools teach it in order that the souls and hearts of the pupils may
become vivified and exhilarated and their lives be brightened with enjoyment.

     Today illumined and spiritual children are gathered in this meeting.  They
are the children of the Kingdom.  The Kingdom of heaven is for such souls as
these, for they are near to God.  They have pure hearts.  They have spiritual
faces.  The effect of the divine teachings is manifest in the perfect purity of
their hearts.  That is why Christ has addressed the world, saying, "Except ye
be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the
kingdom of heaven" -- that is, men must become pure in heart to know God. The
teachings have had great effect.  Spiritual souls!  Tender souls!  The hearts
of all children are of the utmost purity.  They are mirrors upon which no dust
has fallen.  But this purity is on account of weakness and innocence, not on
account of any strength and testing, for as this is the early period of their
childhood, their hearts and minds are unsullied by the world.  They cannot
display any great intelligence.  They have neither hypocrisy nor deceit.  This
is on account of the child's weakness, whereas the man becomes pure through his
strength.  Through the power of intelligence he becomes simple; through the
great power of reason and understanding and not through the power of weakness
he becomes sincere.  When he attains to the state of perfection, he will
receive these qualities; his heart becomes purified, his spirit enlightened,
his soul is sensitized and tender -- all through his great strength.  This is
the difference between the perfect man and the child.  Both have the underlying
qualities of simplicity and sincerity -- the child through the power of
weakness and the man through the power of strength.

     ...

     I give you my advice, and it is this:  Train these children with divine
exhortations.  From their childhood instill in their hearts the love of God so
they may manifest in their lives the fear of God and have confidence in the
bestowals of God.  Teach them to free themselves from human imperfections and
to acquire the divine perfections latent in the heart of man.  The life of man
is useful if he attains the perfections of man.  If he becomes the center of
the imperfections of the world of humanity, death is better than life, and
nonexistence better than existence.  Therefore, make ye an effort in order
that these children may be rightly trained and educated and that each of them
may attain perfection in the world of humanity.  Know ye the value of these
children for they are all my children.

     ...According to the teachings of &amp;Baha'u'llah the family, being a human  ,
unit must be educated according to the rules of sanctity.  All the virtues must
be taught the family.  The integrity of the family bond must be constantly
considered, and the rights of the individual members must not be transgressed.
The rights of the son, the father, the mother -- none of them must be
transgressed, none of them must be arbitrary.  Just as the son has certain
obligations to his father, the father, likewise, has certain obligations to his
son.  The mother, the sister and other members of the household have certain
prerogatives.  All these rights and prerogatives must be conserved, yet the
unity of the family must be sustained.  The injury of one shall be considered
the injury of all; the comfort of each, the comfort of all; the honor of one,
the honor of all.

     He promulgated the adoption of the same course of education for man and
woman.  Daughters and sons must follow the same curriculum of study, thereby
promoting unity of the sexes.  When all mankind shall receive the same
opportunity of education and the equality of men and women be realized, the
foundations of war will be utterly destroyed.  Without equality this will be
impossible because all differences and distinction are conducive to discord and
strife.  Equality between men and women is conducive to the abolition of
warfare for the reason that women will never be willing to sanction it.
Mothers will not give their sons as sacrifices upon the battlefield after
twenty years of anxiety and loving devotion in rearing them from infancy, no
matter what cause they are called upon to defend.  There is no doubt that when
women obtain equality of rights, war will entirely cease among mankind.

     &amp;Baha'u'llah has announced that inasmuch as ignorance and lack of

education is a universal law....

The education of each child is compulsory....  In addition to this wide-spread
