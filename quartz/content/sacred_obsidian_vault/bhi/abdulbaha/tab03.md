send thee spiritual food and bestow upon thee
the Water of Life Eternal. That food is the
divine advices and exhortations revealed in
the Tablets and the spiritual outpourings of

INTRODUCTION

     This book is a reproduction of the Tablets of Abdul-Baha
as contained in the archives of the House of Spirituality+F1
of Bahais of Chicago from the recipients for the purpose
of safe preservation in accordance with the purpose
mentioned in the following letter sent out by that Body:

                                          March 21, 1908.

To the Friends of God in the Light of El-Abha,
        throughout America.

Greeting: --
     For a number of years the House of Spirituality has been gathering
copies of Tablets, received by the Friends in America from
Abdul-Baha Abbas, for sacred preservation in its archives, in
accord with permission from him to do so in a Tablet addressed
to it dated April 21, 1903, as follows:  "As to the compiling of
the Tablets in a Book for the House of Spirituality, this depends
upon the consent of the receivers of the Tablets; if the owners of
the Tablets consent, copies should be kept and collected in the
House of Spirituality and it will be acceptable."
     Although many Tablets, both published and unpublished, were
known to be in circulation among the believers, and notwithstanding
the restriction to collect only copies sent in with the consent
of the recipients, yet, in the spring of 1907, through the hearty
response and co-operation in this endeavor about 500 copies of different
Tablets had been received, acknowledge and filed with data
concerning each in a safety deposit vault equipped with all modern

appliances for protection.
     We believe the Friends everywhere will be further interested
in knowing that at that time a draft of the Tablets was made
by the Librarian of the House of Spirituality for the Bahai Publishing
Society (who contemplated issuing same in book form),
with all references to personalities eliminated, and said compilation
was taken by Mr. Agnew to the presence of Abdul-Baha,
who inquired especially as to elimination of all names of persons
and everything of a clearly personal nature, and as to whether the
recipients of the Tablets had consented to publication of them,
etc. - to all of which he gave approval and instructed the Publishing
Society to proceed with the work.
     The purpose of this communication is therefore twofold:  First,
that the endeavor be continued to preserve a copy of every Tablet
obtainable; and second, that it be accomplished at the earliest
possible moment in order to make the forthcoming Volumes of
Tablets (now being prepared by the Publishing Society) as complete
as possible, for only the Tablets in the archives of the House
will be used, as therein is recorded the desire of the recipients.
     In sending copies of Tablets, kindly see in so far as possible that
together with each is given: (1) Full name of recipient (2) present
address, mentioning street number, city or town, and state, (3)
on or about date translation, (4) name of translator, (5) clearly
state whether or not permission to publish all or only a portion of same
is granted.  Should there be any doubt as to whether or not a
copy of any certain Tablet is already in the archives, you may be
assured in knowing that every Tablet received has been acknowledged
on a special printed form, signed by the Librarian.
     Concerning this important matter the following words of Abdul-Baha
will be of interest to all:  "Verily know, that the Tablets
(Book) of Abdul-Baha and his address is a hidden mystery and
concealed fact; no one is informed of its greatness and importance
at these times.  But in the course of times and future centuries,
the signs thereof will be manifested, the lights thereof will dawn,
the fragrance thereof will be diffused, and the greatness, the importance
thereof will be known.  The truth I say unto thee, that
each leaflet from Abdul-Baha will be a wide-spread Book; nay,
rather, a glistening Gem on the Glorious Crown.  Know thou Its
value and hold great Its station!"
     Thanking you in advance, we are your fellow servants in the
Vineyard of El-Abha,
                                      The House of Spirituality

     A sufficient number of Tablets having been gathered together,
they have been entrusted to the Baha'i Publishing
Society for publication in this concrete form for the enlightenment
of the English-speaking world.
     The Tablets appear in the book in the order received and
filed in the archives, i.e. the first to respond to the above letter
sent out by the House of Spirituality appear first in the
book, and, so far as possible, all the Tablets to any one person
or to a family or to an assembly have been placed together.
     Regarding publications, the following Tablet from Abdul-Baha
was received by this Society in October, 1906:

                        He is God!
O ye heavenly Assemblage!
     Your letter was received and its contents became
known.  Ye have written concerning the printing and
publication of the Tablets.
     The translation of the Surat-ul-Hykl+F2 is of the utmost
difficulty.  It must be translated by a committee
who are exceedingly efficient both in Persian and English,
exercising the closest and most minute attention.
Otherwise the text would not become intelligible.  The
same rule applieth to other Writings and Tablets.  For
the present the organization of such a committee of
translators is not possible and there is no other means
than the translations made by individuals.  In the
future, God willing, means will be brought about.
Translations will be made by a committee composed of
two most erudite Persians and two learned Americans,
all of them having the utmost proficiency in both
languages and possessing a certain knowledge of sciences
and arts.  Then others from among the scholars and
thinkers must assist.  At that time Tablets will be translated
correctly and published.  What ye have in your
hands and what is already printed will impart a certain
degree of information.  Whatever matter the spiritual
Boards of Council in New York, Chicago, Washington
and Kenosha unanimously deem advisable to print
and publish, ye may print and publish; and have the utmost
union and oneness with each other.
     Regarding the Tablets of Abdul-Baha:  Each of
them is important.  Print ye those which are in detail.
     As to the question of annihilation and destruction of
the Spirits+F3 :  Mr. Phelps hath not not fully understood the
matter or else the translator hath made some mistake.
It was not intended to convey the idea that the unbelieving
souls are absolutely annihilated.  Nay, rather, it
was meant that the existence of the evil spirits in comparison
to the existence of the sanctified souls was like
unto annihilation.  As you clearly behold, the existence
of mineral in comparison with the existence of man is
like unto non-being.  When the body of man is destroyed
and disintegrated, it returneth to the mineral.
     Concerning the income of the printing and publishing
society, as ye write, it must be expended for charitable
purposes.
     O ye believers of God!  I am pleased with you and
seek for your assistance and confirmation.  I hope that
ye may, day by day, add to your love, steadfastness,
purity of intention and service to the Cause of God.
     Upon ye be greeting and praise!
                                    Abdul-Baha Abbas.

     These Tablets were originally written in Persian and all
bear the caption, "He is God!"+F4 and close with expressions
of good will, such as, "Upon ye be greetings and praise!"
These expressions have been omitted from this compilation;
also such portions as are clearly of a personal nature, as
well as names of persons, as instructed by Abdul-Baha.
     Omission of names of persons has been designated by the
sign, thus ........; omission of purely personal portions
of the text have been designated by the sign, thus ***.
The translator's interpolations are enclosed in parentheses,
thus ( ); editor's interpolations are enclosed in brackets,
thus [ ].  For messages within Tablets a special sign has
been found necessary and these messages are enclosed within
this special sign, thus &amp; &amp;.  Quotations are shown by the
usual sign, thus " ".
     The great labor of translating these Tablets from the
original language has been entrusted to the following translators,
whose inestimable service is hereby gratefully acknowledged:
Anton Haddad, Mirza S. M. Raffie, Mirza
Housein Rouhy, Ali Kuli Khan, Dr. Ameen U. Fareed,
H. S. M. Taki Manshadi, Mirza Ahmad Esphahani,
Mrs. Getsinger, Miss Barney and Mirza Moneer Zane.
     The House of Spirituality desires to thank all who have
assisted in this matter of gathering in copies of Tablets for
preservation in its archives, and requests the Bahais everywhere
to continue the endeavor as outlined in the circular
letter sent out by that Body, as herein quoted.  Address
such communications to the Librarian of the House of
Spirituality, P. O. Box 283, Chicago, Ill.
     Only a portion of the Tablets now on file with the House
of Spirituality are contained in this volume.  Other volumes
will be issued as soon as possible.  Tablets coming in will
take their place in order according to the date received
and appear in forth-coming volumes.

Feast of Naurooz, March 21, 1909.

     For the information of those who know little or nothing
of the Bahai Revelation, we quote the following account
translated from the (French) Encyclopaedia of Larousse: -

     Bahaism the religion of the disciples of Baha'o'llah, an
outcome of Babism. - Mirza Husain Ali Nuri Bah'o'llah
was born at Teheran in 1817 A. D.  From 1844 he was
one of the first adherents of the Bab, and devoted himself
to the pacific propagation of his doctrine in Persia.  After
the death of the Bab he was, with the principal Babis, exiled
to Baghdad, and later to Constantinople and Adrianople,
under the surveillance of the Ottoman Government.  It was
in the latter city that he openly declared his mission.  He
was "He whom God would make manifest," whom the Bab
had announced in his writings, the great Manifestation of
God, promised for the last days; and in his letters to the
principal Rulers of the States of Europe he invited them to
join him in establishing religion and universal peace.  From
this time, the Babis who acknowledged him became Bahais.
The sultan then exiled him (1868 A. D.) to Acca in Palestine,
where he composed the greater part of his doctrinal
works, and where he died in 1892 A. D. (May 29).  He had
confided to his son, Abbas Effendi Abdul-Baha, the
work of spreading the religion and continuing the connection
between the Bahais of all parts of the world.  In point
of fact, there are Bahais everywhere, not only in Mohammedan
countries, but also in all the countries of Europe, as
well as in the United States, Canada, Japan, India, etc.
This is because Baha'o'llah has known how to transform
Babism into a universal religion, which is presented as the
fulfillment and completion of all the ancient faiths.  The
Jews await the Messiah, the Christians the return of Christ,
the Moslem the Mahdi, the Buddhists the fifth Buddha,
the Zoroastrians Shah Bahran, the Hindoos the reincarnation
of Krishna, and the Atheists - a better social organization!
Baha'o'llah represents all these, and thus destroys the
rivalries and the enmities of the different religions; reconciles
them in their primitive purity, and frees them from the corruption
of dogmas and rites.  For Bahaism has no clergy,
no religious ceremonial, no public prayers; its only dogma
is belief in God and in his Manifestations (Zoroaster, Moses,
Jesus, et al., Baha'o'llah).  The principal works of Baha'o'llah
are the Kitab-ul-Ighan, the Kitab-ul-Akdas, the Kitab-ul-Ayd,
and numerous letters or tablets addressed to
sovereigns or to private individuals.  Ritual holds no place
in the religion, which must be expressed in all the actions of
life, and accomplished in neighborly love.  Every one must
have an occupation.  The education of children is enjoined
and regulated.  No one has the power to receive confession
of sins, or to give absolution.  The priests of the existing
religions should renounce celibacy, and should preach by
their example, mingling in the life of the people.  Monogamy
is universally recommended, etc.  Questions not
treated of are left to the civil law of each country, and to
the decisions of the Bait-ul-Adl, or House of Justice, instituted
by Baha-o-llah.  Respect toward the Head of the State
is a part of respect toward God.  A universal language, and
the creation of tribunals of arbitration between nations, are
to suppress wars.  "You are all leaves of the same tree, and
drops of the same sea," Baha'o'llah has said.  Briefly, it
is not so much a new religion as Religion renewed and unified,
which is directed today by Abdul-Baha. - (Nouveau
Larousse Illustre, supplement, p. 66.)

     Just as this book was going to press the introduction to
it appearing on the following page was received from
Abdul-Baha.

                     He is God!
O Thou Almighty Lord!
     Strengthen all mankind that they may do according
to the instructions and teachings recorded in these writings,
so that wars and strifes may be eliminated from
the world of man;  that the roots of enmity may be
destroyed and the foundations of love and affection be
established;  that the hearts may be filled with love and
the souls be attracted; that wisdom may advance and
the faces become brightened and illumined; that there
be no more wars and strifes and that reconciliation and
peace appear; that the Unity of the world of man may
pitch its tent on the "apex of the horizons," so that
peoples and parties become as one nation, that different
continents become as one continent and the whole
earth as one land; that the sects of antagonizing and
dogmatic religions be unified; that the world of creation
be adorned and all the people of the earth abide
in unity and peace.
     Verily, Thou art the Giver, the Bestower, the Beholder!
                             (signed)   Abdul-Baha Abbas.

                 TABLETS OF ABDUL-BAHA

O thou party+F5 who art assisted by the hosts of the Kingdom
       of El-Abha!
     Blessed are ye who are assembled in the shadow of
the Word of God, who are abiding in the cave of the
Covenant of God, who are comforted by dwelling in
the Paradise of El-Abha+F6 , who are cheerfully moved
with the breezes which blow from the point of the
providence of God, and who have arisen to render
service to the Cause of God, to promulgate the Religion
of God, to promote the Word of God and to
hoist the standards of sanctity in those regions and
climes.
     By the life of El-Baha!  Verily, the perfect and divine
power will breathe in you with bounties from the
Holy Spirit and enable you to accomplish a thing the
like of which hath never been seen by the eye of existence.
     O party of the Covenant!  Verily, the Beauty of
El-Abha hath promised the most great assistance to
the beloved who are firm in the Covenant and to confirm
them through the mightiest power.  Ye will
surely find in your luminous assembly such signs as
will shine within hearts and souls.  Adhere to the hem
of the robe of the Lofty One and do your best to
spread the Covenant of God and to kindled with the

fire of the love of God, so that your hearts may move
with joy through the fragrances of humbleness which
are being diffused from the heart of Abdul-Baha.  Make
feet firm, strengthen hearts and rely upon the everlasting
bounties which will successively pour on your from
the Kingdom of El-Abha.  Know, verily, the lights of
Baha' will shine forth onto you during your gathering
together in the brilliant Paradise.
     It is incumbent on you to have union and harmony.
It is incumbent upon you to have affinity and accord,
so that ye may become united in body and soul as the
Pleiades, and as strings of brilliant pearls.  Thereby
your foundation will be laid, your argument will become
manifest, your stars will beam forth and your
souls will be comforted.
     When ye enter the spiritual meeting of Consultation,
chant the following commune, your hearts beating with
the love of God and your tongues purified from aught
else save the commemoration of God; so that the Most
Might Power may confirm you by the greatest assistance:

     O my God!  O my God!  We are servants who
have sincerely turned our faces unto Thy grand face,
severed ourselves from all else save Thee in this great
day and are assembled together in this glorious meeting,
of one accord and desire, and unanimous in thought
to promulgate Thy Word amid Thy creatures.
     O my Lord!  O my Lord!  Suffer us to be signs of
guidance, standards of Thy manifest Religion throughout
the world, servants of Thy Great Covenant - O our
exalted Lord! - appearances of Thy oneness in Thy


+P 3
Kingdom, the El-Abha, and stars which dawn forth
unto all regions.
 +P  O Lord!  Make us as seas rolling with the waves of
Thy great abundance, rivers flowing from the mountains
of Thy glorious Kingdom, pure fruits on the tree
of Thy illustrious Cause, plants refreshed and moved
by the breeze of Thy gift in Thy wonderful vineyard.
     O Lord! Cause our souls to depend upon the signs
of Thy Oneness, our hearts to be dilated with the bounties
of Thy Singleness, so that we may become united
as are ripples on a waving sea; become harmonized as
are the rays which shine forth from a brilliant light;
so that our thoughts, opinions and feelings become as
one reality from which the spirit of accord may be
diffused throughout all regions.
     Verily Thou art the Beneficent, the Bestower!  Verily
Thou art the Giver, the Mighty, the Loving, the
Merciful!

O ye+F7 who are sincere!  O ye who are attracted! O ye
      who are yearning!  O ye who are arising for
      service to the Cause of God, for the promotion of
      the Word of God and the spreading of the Fragrances
      of God!
     Verily, I read your excellent letter, its beautiful
composition, eloquent words and deep meanings.  I praised
God and gave glory to Him for that He hath strengthened
you and confirmed you in serving His glorious
vineyard.  Your faces shall be enlightened with the
radiance of supplication to God, invocation to Him,
Humbleness and submissiveness to the friends (believers),

and your assembly will be made a magnet for the
lights of assistance from His Great Kingdom.
     It is incumbent upon you to commemorate and ponder
upon the signs of God, to implore to God and to
be evanescent and subservient in the Cause of God.
This is what makes you the signs of guidance among
the people, stars shining in the supreme horizon and
thriving trees in the Paradise of El-Abha.
     Then know ye that Abdul-Baha is in cheerfulness
and joy and in the happiness of great glad-tidings
through being in this far distant prison.+F8  By the life of
El-Baha! - this prison is my supreme paradise, my utmost
desire, the joy of my heart and the dilation of
my breast, my shelter, my asylum, my inaccessible cave
and my high protection.  By it I glory among the
angels of heaven and the Supreme Concourse.
     Be rejoiced, O friends of God, with this confinement
which is a cause of freedom, this prison which is
a means of salvation (to many) and this suffering
which is the best cause of great comfort.  Verily, by
God, I would not change this prison for the throne of
the command of the horizons and would not exchange
this confinement for all excursions and enjoyments in
the gardens of the earth.
     Verily, I hope, through the kindness of my Lord
and His mercy, bounty and generosity, to be suspended
in the air in His path and that my breast may become
the target to be be pierced by thousands of bullets; or that
I may be cast into the bottomless seas, or thrown into
the wilderness and plains of barrenness.  This is my
utmost aim, my supreme desire, the animation of my

+P 5
spirit, the healing of my bosom and the sight of my
eyes.
     As to you, O friends of God:  Make firm your feet
in the Cause of God with such firmness as cannot be
shaken by the most great disasters of this world.  Be
not troubled by anything under any condition.  Be as
lofty mountains, dawning stars from the horizon of
existence, brilliant lamps in the assemblies of oneness
and lowly souls, pure hearted, with the friends.
     Be signs of guidance; lights of piety; severed from
the world, holding fast to the firm rope; spreaders of
the spirit of life; abiders in the ark of safety; manifestations
of mercy; dawning-stars of the mysteries of
existence; points of revelation; day-springs of light;
strengthened by the Holy Spirit; attracted toward God;
sanctified from all things and from the (natural) qualities
of people, and characterized with the attributes of
the angels of heaven - so ye may attain to the greatest
gift in this great century and new age.
     By the life of El-Abha!  No one will obtain this
great favor save he who cuts himself from this world,
being attracted by the love of God, who is dead to the
desires and appetites of self, sincere to God in all things
and meek, humble, imploring, pleading and lowly before
God.

O ye who are firm in the Covenant!
     The report of the Spiritual Gathering, which is
dated *** and sent by you, was received and
its contents were a source of great fragrance and spirituality.
I was glad to read the names of the revered members.


+P 6
     The signature of that meeting should be the Spiritual
Gathering (House of Spirituality) and the wisdom
therein is that hereafter the government should not infer
from the term "House of Justice" that a court is
signified, that it is connected with political affairs, or
that at any time it will interfere with governmental
affairs.
     Hereafter, enemies will be many.  They would use
this subject as a cause for disturbing the mind of the
government and confusing the thoughts of the public.
The intention was to make known that by the term
Spiritual Gathering (House of Spirituality), that Gathering
has not the least connection with material matters,
and that its whole aim and consultation is confined to
matters connected with spiritual affairs.  The was
also instructed (performed) in all Persia.***

O my God!  O my God!
     These are servants who have turned to Thy Kingdom
and hearkened unto Thy voice.  Their hearts
were dilated by Thy call, responded unto Thy summons,
were attracted unto Thy beauty, acknowledged
Thy proofs, believed in Thy signs, confessed Thy
Oneness and arose for the service of Thy Cause and
the promotion of Thy Word.
     O Lord!  O Lord!  Make them lamps of guidance,
lights glistening in the supreme apex, sparkling
stars in heaven, holy angels moving on earth and thriving
trees bearing delicious and fragrant fruits.
     O Lord!  O Lord!  Purify their qualities, clarify
their consciousness, cleanse their hearts and illumine


+P 7
their faces.  Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Precious,
the Protecting!
     O ye spiritual ones!  The rules for election are those
which are customary in that country.  The period of
election is five years.
     O Lord!  O Lord!  Bless this Spiritual Gathering,
strengthen them by Thy power for the spreading of
Thy divine fragrances, cause them to follow Thy will
which is effective in the realities of all things, and aid
them by a confirmation such as never hath preceded to
any one in former centuries.+F9  For these are servants of
Thy servants and Thou hast crowned them them with this
diadem, the most luminous (Abha) gems of which
will shine unto all the horizons.
     Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the
Giver!

O ye who are sincere!  O ye who are firm!  O ye who
        are steadfast!
     Verily, I received a letter from that brilliant body
and Spiritual Gathering - those who have arisen and
called out for the Kingdom of God among the peoples
of America.
     Verily, know with certain knowledge that ye will be
confirmed by hosts from the Kingdom of El-Abha and
with inspirations from the Supreme Concourse in the
promotion of the Word of God.  Verily, Abdul-Baha is
with you and supplicates unto God, desiring His heavenly
blessings to surround you, His divine favors to
encompass you, the appearances of the Sun of Truth

your spirits, the fragrances of holiness to perfume
your nostrils, the verses of guidance to be chanted in
your gatherings, and the lamp of the Supreme Concourse
to illumine your meetings.  Know with real assurance
that this light will encompass the horizons (the
world) with great brilliancy.
     I ask God to make ye lamps ignited by the great
Light, so that ye may stand with all power, meekness,
humbleness, sacrifice and self-resignation and thus become
examples for the people and pure types for the
world, be salt of the earth, stars of guidance, great
trees with broad foliage and excellent fruits of fragrant
scent, growing by the bounty of the cloud of the
Kingdom of El-Abha.
     I praise God that ye were firm in faithfulness in that
ye testified and acknowledged the efforts which Mirza
Assa Ullah+F10manifested in spreading the fragrances of
God and that ye thanked him for his labor and teaching
for you, and this is what gladdens the heart of
Abdul-Baha.

O thou+F11who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily I say unto thee the truth, that I am with you in spirit
and in heart, that I rejoice by your joy and am happy
by your happiness; and hear with the ear of spirit your

     O ye friends of God!  Arise from the corporeal beds
(bodies) and ask for the divine favors, so that ye become
revived by the Holy Spirit through the breath
which the Spirit breathes into the souls.
     By the glory of my Lord, there will be for your brilliant
assemblage an evident sign and great effects in the
spirits and the hearts.  Therefore, gladden the friends
of the Merciful with the glad-tidings of thy Lord in
this time, and convey to them greeting from Abdul-Baha
in this promised century, so that they may arise
with me in servitude to the Threshold of El-Baha.

O ye servants of the Threshold of God!
     The weekly reports of *** were received and
I was informed of their beautiful meanings which
proved firmness and steadfastness in the Cause of God
and solidity in the Covenant of God.
     Through the favor and providence of the Beauty+F12of
Abha I trust that Spiritual Gathering will develop day
by day and will be reinforced by the strength of God.
     Communication with the friends of God in other
countries is a source of fragrant spirituality.
     O ye members of the Spiritual Gathering!  Appreciate
this favor.  This is the glorious crown of the Kingdom,
which, in this century, the Hand of the Great
Favor has placed on your head, and the gems of this
brilliant diadem will surely glisten unto all centuries.
     Thank God that ye became a manifestation of such
favor and are addressed by such speech.

+P 10
O ye friends of Abdul-Baha!
     Verily I read your reports with great joy.  They
are a cause of spirituality and fragrance and a source
of dilation of souls.  If this Spiritual Meeting, by the
divine fragrance and heavenly confirmation, be firmly
established (or continued) it will become a source of
great signs and will be confirmed in matters of paramount
importance.
     The Spiritual Meetings, which are organized in this
cycle of God and this divine century, have never had
their simile or likeness in bygone cycles.  For the great
meetings (organizations) were under the protection of
aristocratic men, while these meetings (or organizations)
are under the protection of the bounty of El-Abha.
The helper or supporter of those (organizations)
was either a prince or a king; either a priest
was the principal, or a great republic (the cause); but
the Helper, the Assistant, the Confirmer and the Inspirer
of these spiritual meetings (or organizations) is
His Majesty the Everlasting God.
     Consider not the present condition, but rather foresee
the future and the end.  A seed in the beginning is
very small, but in the end a great tree.  One should
not consider the seed, but the tree and its abundance
of blossoms, leaves and fruits.
     Consider the days of Jesus, when there was only a
small body of people, and then observe the great tree
which grew from that seed and what an abundant fruit
it produced.  This is greater than that, forasmuch as
it is the calling of the Lord of Hosts and the Voice of
the Trumpet of the Living God; it is the summons unto
the harmony and unison of the world, and it is the banner


+P 11
of faithfulness, trustworthiness and friendship
among the difference nations and sects of the universe;
it is the light of the Sun of Truth and the spirituality
of the Majestic One.  Verily this great cycle (dispensation)
will encompass all the horizons and ultimately all
the nations will gather together under this standard.
     Therefore, know the importance of this seed which
was planted in the divine field by the heavenly Gardener,
watered with the rain of grace and nurtured by
the heat and light of the Sun of Truth.  Thus, O ye
friends of God, give thanks unto His Majesty, the One,
that ye became (or were made) the manifestation of
such a gift and the recipient of such favor.
     Blessed are ye!  Good-tidings unto you for this great
blessing!

O ye who are sincere!  O ye who are firm in the Covenant
        of God in this new cycle!
     Verily I praise God for that He confirmed you in
the service of the Cause of God in His great vineyard.
     Write to Mrs. ........ and convey to her greetings
and praise and say to her that her Lord will aid
and strengthen her in attaining her desire.
     Convey my greeting and salutation unto the maidservant
of God, the attracted one, Mrs. ........, the
respected.   I ask God to make her a spreader of the
new Gospel, an utterer in praise of her Lord in that
vast region.
     Convey my kindness and love unto the maid-servant
of God, who is thrilled by the fragrances of God, Miss
........ of [that place] so that she may be rejoiced
by my greeting to her, the fullness of my favor, and


+P 12
that she may be drawn by the love of God even as the
magnet attracts the iron.
     O my precious friends in the Kingdom of God, the
members of the Spiritual Meeting!  Communicate with
all parts of Persia; write replies to the letters which
are sent to you, with all joy, happiness, fragrance and
spirituality; because the friends of God in Persia are
all rejoiced in commemorating you in the meetings and
assemblies, in houses and Mashrak-el-Azcars.+F13

O ye who are attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily I read your letters which uttered your steadfastness
in the Cause of God, your firmness in His Religion
and your joy by the breezes wafted from the
garden of the Kingdom of God.
     The truth, I say unto you, &amp;Verily, the Supreme
Concourse utter praise upon you, because ye forsook
the desires of self, were illumined by the light of guidance,
clothed yourselves with the garment of sanctity
and called in the Name of El-Abha among the people.
Verily, ye shall reap what ye sow and obtain the fruits
of what ye plant.  This is a pre-ordained fact.&amp;
     O ye beloved of God!  When the winds blow severely,
rains fall fiercely, the lightning flashes, the thunder
roars, the bold descends and storms of trial become
severe, grieve not; for after this storm, verily, the
divine spring will arrive, the hills and fields will become
verdant, the expanses of grain will joyfully wave,
the earth will become covered with blossoms, the trees
will be clothed with green garments and adorned with


------------------------
13. Mashrak-el-Azcar - Temple of Worship.  Literally, the Dawning-place of
      Praises.
+P 13
blossoms and fruits.  Thus blessings become manifest
in all countries.  These favors are results of those
storms and hurricanes.
     The discerning man rejoiceth at the day of trials,
his breast becometh dilated at the time of severe
storms, his eyes become brightened when seeing the
showers of rain and gusts of wind, whereby trees are
uprooted; because he foreseeth the result and the end
(of these trials), the leaves, blossoms and fruits (which
follow this wintry storm); while the ignorant (short-
sighted) person becometh troubled when he seeth a
storm, is saddened when it raineth severely, is terrified
by the thunder and trembleth at the surging of the
waves which storm the shores.
     As ye have heard of the former times, when (for example)
Christ - glory be to Him! - appeared, a storm
of trials arose, afflictions appeared, the winds of tests
blew, the thunder of temptation descended and hosts
of people (Pharisees) surrounded the houses of the
friends; then the weak ones were shaken and were misled
after once being guided; but the disciples withstood
the hardships and endured the storms of ordeals, remaining
firm in the Religion of God.  Then observe
that which occurred after the storm and what appeared
subsequent to that severity, whereby the members (followers)
trembled.
     God hath changed the sorrow to joy, the destructive
darkness of calamity into the shining light from the Supreme
Concourse.  The people at the beginning persecuted
and reviled the believers in God and said of them:
"These are the people of aberration."  Then, when


+P 14
their light appeared, their stars shone and their lamps
illuminated, the people returned into love and affinity;
they prayed to them, offered words of glory night and
day (in their name) and remembered them in eulogy,
reverence, honor and majesty.
     Therefore, O ye beloved of God, be not grieved
when people stand against you, persecute you, afflict
and trouble you and say all manner of evil against you.
The darkness will pass away and the light of the manifest
signs will appear, the veil will be withdrawn and
the Light of Reality will shine forth from the unseen
[Kingdom] of El-Abha.  This we inform you before
it occurs, so that when the hosts of people arise against
you for my love, be not disturbed or troubled; nay,
rather, be firm as a mountain, for this persecution and
reviling of the people upon you is a pre-ordained matter.
Blessed is the soul who is firm in the path!

O thou servant+F14of God!
     ***Trust no man save him whose breast hath
been dilated by God through the light of faith, whom
God hath confirmed in His Religion, and who is severed
from all else save God and attracted by His Fragrances.
     In future, of course, certain people will come to you
claiming faith; do not believe them nor trust them, unless
after critical examination, search and investigation,
and a long period of waiting, they shall appear to be
faithful and truthful in word, confident in heart, attracted
in spirit, pure in intention, patient in hardship,

enduring the most severe tests; then associate with
them.  Because some sects will send certain men to
mingle with you in order to throw suspicion upon those
who are weak, therefore avoid them carefully.***
But let such [deliberations] be hidden that you
may not become a cause of hindrance [to such souls].+F15

O ye firm ones in the Covenant!
     The report of [your meeting] was noted.  All the
arrangements of the meeting are suitable and acceptable.
The reading of the Tablets which are sent to
special persons dependeth upon their consent.  First
send the Tablets to them and if they should agree, the
same may be read in the meeting.  All the arrangements
were good and suitable.
     A special letter is enclosed for the maid-servant of
God, Mrs. ........  Forward it.  As to letters for
Chicago and its vicinity, if God so willeth (Inshallah),
they will be sent through the House of Spirituality.  As
to the copying of the Tablets in a book for the House
of Spirituality, this dependeth upon the consent of the
receivers of the Tablets.  If the owners of the Tablets
consent, copies should be kept and collected in the
House of Spirituality and it will be acceptable.  Nevertheless,
this should be with perfect consent of the receivers.
     Regarding arrangements for the Bahai Sunday
meeting for the purpose of worship, this is very suitable.
But, in a meeting for worship, first, prayer should
be chanted and supplication made until all gather; then


------------------------
15. This instruction is to the organized and elected Body, whose function is to
      look after the welfare of the Cause in its community.
+P 16
communion should be made.  After praying, sacred
readings with melodious voices should be read by all
together.  As this is the commencement of holding
meetings, this is sufficient.

O God!  O God!+F16
     Thou dost look upon us from Thine unseen Kingdom
of Oneness, [beholding] that we have assembled
in this Spiritual Meeting, believing in Thee, confident
in Thy signs, firm in Thy Covenant and Testament, attracted
unto Thee, set aglow with the fire of Thy love,
sincere in Thy Cause, servants in Thy vineyard,
spreaders of They Religion, worshipers of Thy Countenance,
humble to Thy beloved, submissive at Thy
door and imploring Thee to confirm us in the service
of Thy chosen ones.  Support us with Thine unseen
hosts, strengthen our loins in Thy servitude and make
us submissive and worshiping servants, communing
with Thee.
     O our Lord!  Turn our faces unto Thy divine face;
feed us from Thy heavenly table by Thy godly grace;
help us through the hosts of Thy supreme angles and
confirm us by the holy ones of the Kingdom of Abha.
     Verily Thou art the Generous, the Merciful!  Thou
art possessor of great bounty and verily Thou art the
Clement and Gracious!

      Spirituality.
+P 17
O ye who are attracted!  O ye who are firm!  O ye
        who are zealous in the service of the Cause of
        God and are sacrificers of possessions and lives for
        the promotion of the Word of God!
     I perused your recent letter, dated *** and my
heart was filled with joy through its beautify meanings
and its eloquent contents.  Truly they were suggested
by the breaths of confirmation from the Glorious
Lord.
     O friends of Abdul-Baha and his co-sharers and
partners in the servitude of the Lord of Hosts!  Verily,
the greatest affair and the most important matter
today is to establish a Masharak-el-Azcar+F17and to found
a Temple from which the voice of praisings may rise
to the Kingdom of the majestic Lord.  Blessings be
upon you for having thought to do so and intending to
erect such an edifice, advancing all in devoting your
wealth in this great purpose and in this splendid work.
You will soon see the angels of confirmation following
after you and the hosts of reinforcement crowding before
you.
     When the Mashrak-el-Azcar is accomplished, when
the lights are emanating therefrom, the righteous ones
are presenting themselves therein, the prayers are performed
with supplication towards the mysterious Kingdom
(of heaven), the voice of glorification is raised to
the Lord, the Supreme, then the believers shall rejoice,
the hearts shall be dilated and overflow with the love
of the All-living and Self-existent (God).  The people
shall hasten to worship in that heavenly Temple,
the fragrances of God will be elevated, the divine


------------------------
17. Temple of Worship.  Literally, the Dawning-place of Praises.
+P 18
teachings will be established in the hearts like the establishment
of the Spirit in mankind; the people will
then stand firm in the Cause of your Lord, the Merciful.
Praise and greetings be upon you.

O ye who are chosen!  O ye who are firm!  O ye who
        are calling!  O ye who are sincere!
     Verily I praise my Supreme Lord for choosing you
to call in His Name among the people, for attracting
you to the beauty of El-Abha and for strengthening
you in rendering His Cause victorious.
     I trust in Him to make your faces shine forth with
glorious lights in that clime, glistening as the face of
heaven by the light of the early dawn, unto the horizons.
     Verily I herald unto you the confirmations which will
sustain you by the mercy of your Lord.  For ye have
arisen with all your power to serve God's Cause in that
vast region.  Ponder over this great bounty and manifest
attainment!
     I send you the glad-tidings of the erection of the
Temple of worship (Mashrak-el-Azcar) in Ishkabad
[Russia], with all joy and great happiness.  The friends
of God assembled together with rejoicing and conveyed
the stones themselves, upon their backs, while attracted
by the love of God and for the glory of God.  Soon
that great Temple will be completed and the voice of
prayer and praise shall ascend to the sublime Kingdom.
     I was rejoiced through your endeavors in this glorious
cause, made with joy and good interest.  I pray
God to aid you in exalting His Word and in establishing
the Temple of Worship, through His grace and


+P 19
ancient mercy.  Verily you are the first to arise for this
glorious cause in that vast region.  Soon will ye see the
spread of this enterprise in the world and its resounding
voice shall go through the ears of the people in all parts.
     Exert your energy in accomplishing what you have undertaken,
so that this glorious Temple may be built,
that the beloved of God may assemble therein and that
they may pray and offer glory to God for guiding them
to His Kingdom.
     Convey my greeting and praise to the beloved of
God in that city.

     +F18Your three reports, together with the public
announcement+F19, were received.  Praise be to God! all the
contents indicated firmness, spirituality and goodness.
The friends of the Spiritual Meeting are indeed manifesting
efforts in the Cause of God.  Soon the unseen
strength of heaven will become evident, and such zeal
and earnestness will become manifest in that country
that it will affect all parts of the world.
     Souls are like unto mirrors, and the bounty of God
is like unto the sun.  When the mirrors pass beyond all
coloring and attain purity and polish, and are confronted
with the sun, they will reflect in full perfection
its light and glory.  In this condition one should not
consider the mirror, but the power of the light of the
sun, which hath penetrated the mirror, making it a reflector
of the heavenly glory.
     I hope that the House of Spirituality will become a

heavenly mirror and the lights of the Sun of Truth
will so penetrate it that all parts will be illuminated
through it.
     Your public announcement was carefully considered,
and in some places slight corrections were made,
and it was returned to you.  This announcement should
be given forth with wisdom, and not in haste, for it
would be a cause of stirring up.  When ye find a soul
manifesting a demand for Truth, then ye may give this
to him, that he may be informed of the rudiments of
the Cause.
     But my name should be confined to Abdul-Baha in
all writings.  This is the collective name which will
gather all the people, and it is the strong fortress and
protection of the Cause of God.  The beloved ones
must limit themselves to this.  However, ye may mention
me as the Light of the Love of God, the Flame of
the Guidance of God and the Banner of Peace and
Harmony.  I trust in God that ye may ever be confirmed
through the Holy Spirit.

O ye spiritual friends of Abdul-Baha!
     Your long letter was considered and its contents were
a source of happiness.  Thank God that ye, western
friends, have become dawning-points of the love of
God and stars of knowledge leading to Him; night and
day are ye thinking of imparting life to souls and of
educating people of discernment.
     Regarding the blessed word, the Greatest Name:
Its writing or spelling is according to its pronunciation
(i.e., it is spelled as it is pronounced) in the Persian
language.  Baha is correct; Beha is incorrect.  However


+P 21
this question must not cause inharmony and grief
among the friends.  This truth shall become manifest.
     Should ye attribute a mistake to a person, it will be
a cause of offense and grief to him - how much greater
would this be if it is attributed to a number of people!
How often it hath occurred that a slight difference hath
caused a great dissension and hath been made a reason
for division.  Now, you write Baha'u'llah,+F20but do
not object to any person.  All will eventually follow
the correct spelling.
     O ye beloved ones of God!  The manifestation of
the Light of Unity is for binding together the people
of the world.  If this unity is not attained, the tree of
life is made fruitless, the heavenly bounty is not utilized.
The blessed blood (of the saints) was shed for
bringing about unity and harmony.  These souls gave
their lives as sacrifice in order to produce the love that
bindeth the hearts of all the people.  Therefore, ye
should all spend your efforts in uniting and reconciling
(the people), so that the light of God's love may permeate
the universe.
     The Spiritual Meeting of men (House of Spirituality)
and the Spiritual Meeting of women (Assembly
of Teaching) in Chicago are indeed endeavoring to
serve.  If they unite, as they should, they will produce
great results.  Especially, if the Spiritual Meetings of


------------------------

      more correct pronunciation.
+P 22
Chicago unite with those of New York and become
bound together, in a short while the fragrance of the
divine garden, which giveth life, will perfume all
regions.

O ye spiritual friends of Abdul-Baha!
     Your letter was considered; its contents were a source
of satisfaction to the heart and its meaning indicative
of firmness and steadfastness in the Cause of God.
     That gathering is under the shelter and protection
of the mighty Lord.  I hope that, as it should be, ye
may be confirmed by the fragrance of the Holy Spirit
and day by day may grow in love for God and attraction
to the eternal beauty of the Sun of the horizons.
     The spiritual love of God maketh man pure and holy
and clotheth him with the garment of virtue and purity.
And when man attacheth his heart wholly to God
and becometh related to the Blessed Perfection, the divine
bounty will dawn.  This love is not physical, nay,
rather, it is absolutely spiritual.
     The souls whose consciences are enlightened through
the light of the love of God, they are like unto shining
lights and resemble stars of holiness in the heaven of
purity.
     The real and great love is the love of God.  That
is holy above the imaginations and thoughts of men.
     The beloved of God must each be the essence of
purity and holiness; so may they be known by their
purity, freedom and meekness in every land; they may
drink from the eternal chalice of the love of God, enjoy
its ecstasy, and through meeting the Beauty of
Abha, they should be joyful, active, aglow with zeal


+P 23
and wonderful.  This is the station of the sincere.  This
is the quality of those who are firm.  This is the illumination
of the faces of those who are near.
     Therefore, O ye friends of God, ye must in perfect
purity attain spiritual unity and agreement to a degree
that ye may express one spirit and one life.
     In this condition physical bodies play no part:  the
command and authority are in the hand of the spirit.
When the spirit becometh all inclusive, the Spiritual
union shall be attained.  Night and day endeavor to
attain perfect harmony; be thoughtful concerning your
own spiritual developments and close your eyes to the
shortcomings of one another.
     By good deeds, pure lives, humility and meekness be
a lesson for others.
     Abdul-Baha wisheth no one's heart to feel hurt, nor
will he be a source of grief to any one; for there is no
greater satisfaction than being a source of joy to the
hearts.
     I ask God that ye may become like angels of heaven,
sources of happiness to souls.

O ye dear friends of Abdul-Baha!
     The blessed letter indicating the election of the Spiritual
Meeting was received and proved a source of joy.
Thank God, the beloved of that city, in perfect unity,
love and oneness, held the new election and were confirmed
and strengthened to elect such holy souls as are
near the divine Threshold and known by the republic
of the beloved to be firm and steadfast in the Covenant.
     Now they (the members of Spiritual Meeting)
must, in perfect spirit and fragrance, in sincerity of


+P 24
heart, in attraction by the fragrances of God and by
the confirmations of the Holy Spirit, engage in service;
in the promotion of the Word of God; the diffusion of
the fragrances of God; the training of the souls; the promulgation
of the most great peace.  They must raise
the Banner of Guidance and become the host of the
Supreme Concourse.
     Indeed, blessed souls have been elected.  When I
read their names, spiritual joy was immediately realized,
for, praise be to God! certain souls have appeared
in that continent who are servants of the kingdom,
self-sacrificing ones of the Peerless Majesty.
     O ye friends of mine!  Illuminate the meeting with
the light of the love of God, make it joyful and happy
through the melody of the Kingdom of holiness, and
with heavenly food and through the "Lord's Supper"+F21
confer life.
     Congregate in the utmost of joy and happiness and
commence with this commune:
     O Lord of the Kingdom!  Although we are assembled,
yet we are Thy scattered ones; captives of Thy
Shining Face.  Although we are incapable, yet we anticipate
the manifestation of Thy strength and ability.
Although we are without capital and commodity, yet
we are aided by the treasury of the Kingdom.  Although
we are a drop, yet we emanate from Thy sea
of seas.  Although we are an atom, yet we are illumined
by Thy most bright Sun.
     O Lord!  Confirm us so that each one in this gathering
become a bright candle, a witness of the meeting,


------------------------
21. A term synonymous with heavenly food.
+P 25
a caller to the Kingdom; that the world of matter become
the mirror of heaven.

     O ye dear friends of mine!  The assemblies of those
regions must be connected with one another and must
communicate (correspond) with each other.  Even
communicate with the assemblies of the East, so that
this may become the means of the great unity and
concord.
     O ye spiritual friends!  Firmness (constancy) must
reach a degree that if all the souls (Bahais) be destroyed
by the evil wishers and there remain but one,
that one singly and alone should be capable of withstanding
all who live on earth, and of spreading the
fragrances of holiness.
     Therefore, when any terrible new or calamitous
tidings reach you from the land of desire (Acca), ye
should not grow cold, sad, or be affected thereby.  Nay,
rather, ye must immediately in the utmost firmness,
arise for the service of the Kingdom.
     This servant of the Threshold of His Majesty the
eternal God, hath always been and is in danger; there
hath never been a hope for rest.  The utmost of his
hopes is that in the arena of martyrdom the cup
of grace become replete and the wine of great bounty
lend the wondrous ecstasy.  This is the utmost of my
hopes and desires.

constantly persuade people in pure and divine brilliancy
and in absolute godlike spirituality.  They should not
interfere with the affairs which have regard to the
Board of Consultation, because confusion of thought
conduces to division and causes disturbance to the mind,
and then pure spirituality would cease.  But if all mentions
are turned into one mention, and all thoughts concentrated
in one point, then man will find (a higher)
spirit, and witness (a higher) confirmation.  His power
and penetration will increase, and his armies and hosts
will gain successive victories.  By this it is intended
that the assembly of the maid-servants of the Merciful
should be with pure spirituality and with absolute brilliancy,
and become a torch of that blessed fire, a center
of the merciful feelings.
     The Assembly of Teaching is in this day of the first
importance, and is promised to be assisted and protected
through the assistance of His Highness, the One God.
     Announce infinite glad-tidings to the revered maid-servants
of God -- the members of the merciful assembly,
so that they may arise with the utmost tranquillity
(to further) prosperity and success, because
Abdul-Baha is their strong and firm assistant through
the help and the providence of the Lord of Hosts.
     Concerning organizing Houses of Justice of men and
Assemblies of Teaching of maid-servants of God, the
more endeavor is made, the more agreeable it will be.
It is very useful.  Likewise, electing men and women
teachers, and their traveling and journeying in all parts,
and their going and coming in cities and villages, is
greatly conducive to the solidity of the Cause.***


+P 28
O ye leaves+F1 of the Paradise of El-ABHA, and the maid-servants
     of the Merciful!

     Verily, I read your words of thanksgiving to God,
and of celebrating the praise of God, for that He hath
illuminated your faces with the lights of guidance, hath
transfigured Himself on your hearts with the bounties
of spirit, and hath made you as lofty and magnificent
trees bearing ripened fruits in the Paradise of El-ABHA.
These signs will surely become manifest in your faces,
these lights will shine within your hearts, the splendor
of oneness will envelop you, and your brows will glitter
with rays shining from the Kingdom of El-ABHA.
     O maid-servants of the Merciful!  Know that, verily,
this day is the day of teaching, this day is the day
of diffusing the fragrances of God, being severed from
aught else save God, attracted to the Word of God,
and clinging to the Covenant of God.  There is no
work greater than this.  Be ye entirely spiritual, purely
brilliant, cut your dependence from any other mention,
thought or purpose, and confine your mentions,
thoughts and occupations to spreading the fragrances
of God, and devote your attention to this great work.
By God, the True One, verily, the Sun of Truth will
cast forth its lights in your assemblies and will make
you shining lamps, glittering stars, brilliant signs, and
as souls attracted to the Holy Spirit.  This is the great
prosperity!  This is the manifest light!

     Upon you be greeting and praise!

     When you assemble in the meeting of teaching (the

truth), it is incumbent on you to chant the following
supplication and commune:

     O God, O God!  We are Thy humble and submissive
servants, leaves of Thine exalted and verdant
paradise, drops from the basins of Thine abundant
mercy, and scattered particles flying about in Thy shining
rays.
     O Lord, O Lord, render us successful through Thy
conquering power, in that which Thou lovest and approvest,
so that we may become standards of guidance,
signs of Thy Kingdom, the El-ABHA [and that we
may] adore Thee, supplicate before the Kingdom of
Thy mercy, beseech Thy realm of might, be submissive
to Thy servants, humble before Thy maid-servants,
severed from aught else save Thee, sincerely turned
unto Thy face, aflame with the fire of Thy love, diffusing
Thy fragrances, united in Thy Cause, of one accord
in Thy religion, and firm in Thy Covenant.  O God,
strengthen us through the fragrances of Thy sanctity,
that we may become sanctified from the stain of egotism
and lust, baptized with Thy Holy Spirit, with the fire
of Thy love and the water of Thy bounty.
     Verily, Thou art the Bestower, the Assister, the
Confirmer, the Beneficent, the Merciful!

O ye verdant and flourishing leaves+F1 of the Blessed
     Tree!
     Verily, I read your letter, which expressed your spiritual
attraction to the fragrances of God, your service
to the Cause of God, your firmness in the Covenant of
God, your joy in this blessed and great day, your union

and harmony in the religion of God, your happiness in
diffusing the light of the knowledge of God, and your
work in the Vineyard of God -- the Paradise of El-ABHA.
Such prosperity, success, blessing and salvation
behooveth one like you!  Blessed are ye, O ye stars
who are beaming with the light of the love of God!
Blessed are ye, O ye lamps lighted with the fire of the
love of God!  Blessed ye are, O ye who are attracted
to the Kingdom of God!  Glad-tidings be unto you, O
you who are severed from aught else save God!  Blessed
ye are, O ye pure and chaste ones!  Glad-tidings be
unto you through the gift of the Covenant, from the
light of which all regions are illuminated!  Be rejoiced
that the lights of the Sun of Truth are shining forth
unto all parts; be gladdened at the gifts of your Lord,
which have surrounded all the universe; dilate your
breasts by chanting the verses of God, and console your
eyes by witnessing the bounties of the Supreme
Concourse.
     By God, the True One, verily, the angels of heaven
praise you every morn and eve from the loftiest apex,
and announce to you a favor which will surely appear
as clear and lucid as the sun in mid-day.  Then your
faces will shine with a light which will gleam forth
unison and harmony, in diffusing the fragrances of God,
in preaching the Beauty of El-ABHA, and promoting
the word of God.  Let each one of you be attracted
to the love of the other, so that ye may become as fountains
flowing from one source, stars beaming with one
life, myrtles verdant and flourishing by the abundance
of one rain.  By this your hearts will be purified, your


+P 31
consciences illumined, your souls made clear, your banners
hoisted, and ye will become signs of guidance
among the maid-servants, standards of chastity and
piety throughout all the nations of the earth, and the
appearances of the gifts of your Lord among women.
     Verily, I implore God to gaze upon you with the
eye of His mercy, to raise you through a godlike power,
to move you by the breezes of His glory, to make you
fluent in irrefutable and divine proofs and arguments,
to sever you from the world and all therein, to purify
and sanctify you from every material grade, and enable
you to diffuse the bounties of the Divine Worlds.

O ye maid-servants of the Merciful!
     Be rejoiced with the glad-tidings of God and thank
your Lord for that He assembled you in the brilliant
gathering with illumined faces, pure hearts, wherein the
mysteries of God are printed, and spirits gladdened by
the fragrances of God.  This is from His favor to you
in this glorious century.
     I ask God to adorn your heads with the pearls of His
favor, to ignite in your hearts the fire of the love of
God, to free your tongues in utterance of eloquent
words and excellent meanings and mysteries in the gathering
of the pious, to make ye roses of the paradise of
El-ABHA, angels of heaven, united in opinions, harmonious
in thoughts and to manifest in your faces signs
of holiness of the Kingdom among the people.
     Soon will your Lord make you growing trees in His
wonderful vineyard, blossoming, leafing and bearing
fruits of the paradise of El-ABHA through the shadow
of His Name, the Merciful, the Clement.


+P 32
O ye+F1 crying voices in the region of America!
     Make level the path of the Covenant of God!  BE
firm in the Alliance of God!
     I surely read your answer to my words, and my heart
overflowed with joy and fragrance, when I heard of
your supplication to God, and of your entreaty to God,
and of your begging assistance of God, and of your
endeavor in the service of the Cause of God, and of
your effort in publishing the Alliance of God, and of
your yearning after and your longing for harmony and
union in the love of God.
     Ye shall soon behold the lights of confirmation shining
forth unto your hearts and your spirits from the
Kingdom of ABHA.
     Stand up, as the standing of the souls by whose lights
of sincerity in the Cause of God the horizons are shining,
and guard the sheep of God with the staff of the
instructions of God.
     I beg God to confirm thee to His will, as He confirmed
the Apostles (of Jesus) aforetime.
     I know, verily, that the universal, never ending,
eternal, bright and divine establishments are only the
diffusing of the breaths of God, and the spreading of
the instructions of God, and all that are beside these,
though they be the reigning over all the regions of the
earth, or the construction of railroads from the earth
to the heavens, or means of transportation with the
rapidity of rising lightning from the globe of earth
to the globe of the sun, all are but mortal, perishing,
demolishing and disadvantageous, in comparison with
the divine establishments.  Because the latter (divine


------------------------

+P 33
establishments) are intrinsic matters, while the former
are but metaphorical matters; the latter are truth, while
the former are imaginary.
     Verily, I yearn after your visit as the yearning of the
thirsty after the fountain of the water of Euphrates
(agreeable water), but at present your remaining in
that region (America) is obligatory.  Please God, when
it will be the occasion, I will inform you to come; and
(now) I will circumambulate instead of you the Holy
Tomb.+F1  Glory be upon you!

O thou son of the associate and companion+F2 of Abdul-Baha!
     You brought many letters with you from those
regions, but on account of the great disturbance it was
not possible to write the answers.  You saw what a
commotion was set up in the Blessed Spot+F3 throught the
instigation of the jealous brother.  It still continues.
Therefore you must apologize:  Say that Abdul-Baha
has considered every one of the letters with the eyes of
the spirit, has read each, and through the valid messenger --
that is, through the spiritual susceptibilities --
has sent each the message of peace and greeting.
Therefore, let them turn to the blessed and Radiant
Spot with a pure heart and an attracted spirit, that
they may receive answer through the lights radiating
therefrom.
     Communication is not confined to writing.  This is
a trace, while the spiritual message is fruitful and effective.

     O Thou kind God!  That scattered assembly+F1 is
Thine, and that gathering of friends is of Thee.  Their
eyes are opened, their hearts in tune with Thy love, and
their ears in communion with Thy hidden mysteries.
     O Thou who art self-sufficient!  Let a beautiful song
reach this people from the birds of that garden, that
they may warble, rejoice and be happy, implore and
supplicate the Lord.
     O Thou Educator!  Train that assembly of the
righteous; comfort them; set their hearts aglow with
the fire of Thy love; acquaint them with Thy mystery
and commune with them, so that they may find Thy
kingdom of mysteries, become of the people of piety
and leading in liberty.
     Grant them the soul immortal; enrich them above
the world, and detach them from the world; usher them
into the tent of Thy Kingdom and give them a portion
of the divine bounty.
     Bestow upon them the everlasting life and bless
them with the new teachings.  Make every one a
lighted torch and a warbling nightingale -- the king of
the rose in the garden.  Reveal to them Thine attractive
beauty; make each a growing tree on the shore of
Thy guidance, bearing the fruit of Thy grace.  Thus
may the East illumine the West and the West become
the East of the Supreme Heaven.

O ye my divine friends!+F1
     At a time when the sea of tests had become tempestuous
and the waves of calamity were heaving and the
hosts of nations were in the utmost violence and the
people of oppression dealt with infinite injustice, some
of the calumniators, uniting with our unkind brother,
wrote a letter replete with false accusations and engaged
in seditions and calumnies.
     They confused the mind of the government and
agitated the state authorities.  From this it is evident
how a prisoner in this ruined walled city would fare
and how the conditions are so full of perplexity and
confusion as to baffle all description!  Notwithstanding,
this imprisoned exile is in the utmost firmness and
calmness, trusts in His Highness the Peerless God, and
wishes for every calamity and affliction in the path of
the love of God!  (To us) the arrow of oppression is
a rich flow of divine bounty, and deadly poison is a
swift-healing antidote.
     We were in such a state when a letter came from
the friends in America.  The whole of its contents
showed an agreement on their part to be in unity and
harmony in all respects, and it was signed by all, determined
to be self-sacrificing in the path of the love of
God, in order thus to secure eternal life.
     Upon perusing that letter and looking at the name
signed to it, such a joy and gladness came over Abdul-Baha
as is beyond description, and he thanked God
that such friends are found in that country, who in
utmost joy and fragrance are in union and accord and


------------------------

      and sent July 4, 1905.
+P 36
one in agreement with each other.  The more this
Covenant is strengthened, the happier, the better, the
sweeter it will be and it will thus attract the divine
confirmations.  If the friends of God are wishing for
confirmation in order to enjoy the friendship of the
Supreme Concourse, they must exert themselves to
confirm and strengthen this Covenant; for the making
of a covenant, and an alliance for brotherhood and
unity is like unto the irrigation of the tree of life which
is conducive to eternal life!
     Briefly, O ye friends of God!  Make your feet firm,
make a firm compact, and in union and accord endeavor
to diffuse the fragrance of the love of God and to
spread the divine teachings, in order that ye may impart
life to the dead body of this world, and bestow a real
healing on every one diseased (in soul).
     O ye friends of God!  The world is like the body
of man -- it hath become sick, feeble and infirm.  Its eye
is devoid of sight, its ear hath become destitute of hearing
and its faculties of sense are entirely dissolved.  The
friends of God must become as wise physicians and
care for and heal this sick person, in accord with the
divine teachings, in order that -- God willing -- it may
perchance gain health, find eternal healing and that its
lost powers may be restored; and that the person of
the world may find such health, freshness and purity
that it will appear in the utmost beauty and charm.
     The first remedy is to guide the people, so that they
may turn unto God, hearken unto the divine commandments
and go forth with a hearing ear and seeing eye.
After this swift and certain remedy hath been applied,
then according to the divine teachings, they ought to


+P 37
be trained in the conduct, morals and deeds of the
Supreme Concourse, encouraged and inspire with the
gifts of the Kingdom of ABHA.  The hearts should
be purified and cleansed from every trace of hatred
and rancor and enabled to engage in truthfulness, conciliation,
uprightness and love toward the world of
humanity; so that the East and the West may embrace
each other like unto two lovers, enmity and animosity
may vanish from the human world and the universal
peace be established!
     O ye friends of God!  Be kind to all peoples and
nations, have love for all of them, exert yourselves to
purify the hearts as much as you can, and bestow
abundant effort in rejoicing the souls.  Be ye a
sprinkling of rain to every meadow and a water of
life to every tree.  Be ye as fragrant musk to every
nostril and a soul-refreshing breeze to every invalid.
Be ye salutary water to every thirsty one, a wise guide
to every one led astray, an affectionate father or mother
to every orphan, and, in the utmost joy and fragrance,
a son or daughter to every one bent with age.  Be ye
a rich treasure to every indigent one; consider love and
union as a delectable paradise, and count annoyance
and hostility as the torment of hell-fire.  Exert with
your soul; seek no rest in body; supplicate and beseech
with your heart and search for divine assistance and
favor, in order that ye may make this world the Paradise
of ABHA and this terrestrial globe the arena of
the Supreme Kingdom.  If ye make an effort, it is
certain that these lights will shine, this cloud of mercy
shall rain, this soul-nourishing breeze shall waft, and
the scent of this most fragrant musk be diffused.


+P 38
     O ye friends of God!  Be ye not concerned with the
events transpiring at this Blessed Spot, and give no
thought thereto.  Whatever may happen is good, for
calamities are bestowal itself, hardship is the reality
of mercy, discomposure is but composure of mind, and
sacrifice of life is a manifest gift.  Whatever may happen
is a bounty from God, the Most High.  Be ye
engaged in your own affairs; be employed in guiding
the people; train the souls in the qualities and nature
of Abdul-Baha, and convey the glad-tidings of the
Kingdom of ABHA to the people.  Do not seek rest
during night and day and sit not tranquil for a minute.
Bring these glad-tidings to the hearing of mankind
with the utmost exertion, and accept every calamity
and affliction in your love for God and reliance on
Abdul-Baha.  Endure the censure of enemies and bear
the reproaches of the people of oppression with
patience.  Follow the example of Abdul-Baha and at
every moment wish to offer yourselves in the path of
the Beauty of ABHA.  Shine ye like unto the sun and
roar and move like unto the sea; impart life to mountain
and desert like unto clouds, and similar to the
vernal breeze, bestow freshness, grace and elegance on
the trees of human temples.

O ye+F1 children of the Kingdom!
     It is New Year; that is to say, the rounding of the
cycle of the year.  A year is the expression of a cycle
(of the sun); but now is the beginning of a cycle of
Realty, a New Cycle, a New Age, a New Century, a

      Year's greeting.
+P 39
New Time and a New Year.  Therefore it is very
blessed.

     I wish this blessing to appear and become manifest
in the faces and characteristics of the believers, so that
they, too, may become a new people, and having found
new life and been baptized with fire and spirit, may
make the world a new world, to the end that the old
earth may disappear and the new earth appear; old
ideas depart and new thoughts come; old garments be
cast aside and new garments put on; ancient politics
whose foundation is war be discarded and modern
politics founded on peace raise the standard of victory;
the new star shine and gleam and the new sun illumine
and radiate; new flowers bloom; the new spring become
known; the new breeze blow; the new bounty
descend; the new tree give forth new fruit; the new
voice become raised and this new sound reach the ears,
that the new will follow the new, and all the old furnishings
and adornments be cast aside and new decorations
put in their places.

     I desire for you all that you will have this great
assistance and partake of this great bounty, and that in
spirit and heart you will strive and endeavor until the
world of war become the world of peace; the world
of darkness the world of light; satanic conduct be
turned into heavenly behavior; the ruined places
become built up; the sword be turne dinto the olive
branch; the flash of hatred become the flame of the
love of God and the noise of the gun the voice of the
Kingdom; the soldiers of death the soldiers of life; all
the nations of the world one nation; all races as one


+P 40
race; and all national anthems harmonized into one
melody.
     Then this material realm will be Paradise, the earth
Heaven, and the world of Satan become the world of
Angels.

O ye+F1 Cohorts of God!
     A letter which was signed by you in general was
received.  Its content was of the utmost beauty, sweetness,
eloquence and perfection.  While reading it the
utmost happiness was produced.  It spoke of fasting
during the month of the Fast.  Happy is your condition
for you have executed the divine command; and
have arisen to fast in these blessed days.  For this
physical fasting is a symbol of the spiritual fasting,
that is, abstaining from all carnal desires, becoming
characterized with the attributes of the spiritual ones,
attracted to the heavenly fragrances and enkindled
with the fire of the love of God.
     Likewise your letter was an evidence of the union
and affinity of the hearts.  I hope that through the
bounty and favors of the Most Glorious Lord, in this
new age, the regions of the West become the East of
the Sun of Truth, the believers of God become the
dawning-places of lights, the manifestors of the signs,
be protected and guarded from the doubts of the heedless
ones, remain firm and steadfast in the Covenant
and Testament, and strive day and night in order to
awaken those who are asleep, to make mindful those
who are heedless, to make confident of the mysteries
of the Kingdom those who are deprived, to confer a

share from the never-ending outpouring upon those who
are helpless, to become the heralds of the Kingdom and
to call the inhabitants of this terrestrial world to the
Celestial Realm.
     O ye Cohorts of God!  Today in the present world
each community is wandering in a wilderness, moving
in accord with some passion and desire, and running
to and fro in pursuance of his own imagination.  Among
the communities of the world, this community of the
"Most Great Name" is free from every thought, keeping
aloof from every project and scheme, arising with
the purest designs and intentions, and striving and
endeavoring with the utmost hope to live in accordance
with the divine teachings in order that the surface of
the earth become the delectable paradise, the nether
world become the mirror of the Kingdom, the universe
become another universe, and the human race attain to
higher morals, conduct and manners.
     O ye Cohorts of God!  Through the protection and
help of the Blessed Perfection -- may my life be a
sacrifice to His beloved ones! -- you must conduct and
deport yourselves in such a manner that you may stand
out among other souls distinguished by a brilliancy like
unto the sun.  If any one of you enters a city he must
become the center of attraction because of the sincerity,
faithfulness, love, honesty, fidelity, truthfulness and
loving-kindness of his disposition and nature toward
all the inhabitants of the world, that the people of
the city may all cry out:  "This person is unquestionably
a Bahai; for his manners, his behaviour, his conduct,
his morals, his nature and his disposition are of the
attributes of the Bahais."  Until you do attain to this


+P 42
station, you have not fulfilled the Covenant and the
Testament of God.  For according to the irrefutable
texts, He has taken from us a firm covenant that we
may live and act in accord with the divine exhortations,
commands and lordly teachings.
     O ye Cohorts of God!  Now is the time when the
signs and the perfections of the "Most Great Name"
become manifest and clear in this golden cycle in order
that it may become demonstrated and established
beyond doubt that this period is the period of the
Blessed Perfection, and this cycle is distinguished from
all other cycles and epochs.
     O ye Cohorts of God!  If you observe that a soul
has turned his face completely toward the Cause of
God, his intention is centralized upon the penetration
of the Word of God, he is serving the Cause day and
night with the utmost fidelity, no scent of selfishness is
inhaled from his manners and deeds, and no trace of
egotism or prejudice is seen in his personality -- nay
rather is he a wanderer in the wilderness of the love
of God, and one intoxicated with the wine of the
knowledge of God, occupied wholly with the diffusion
of the fragrances of God, and attracted to the signs
of the Kingdom of God; know ye of a certainty that he
is confirmed with the powers of the Kingdom, assisted
by the heaven of Might; and he will shine, gleam and
sparkle like unto the morning star with the utmost
brilliancy and splendor from the horizon of the everlasting
gift.  If he is alloyed with the slightest trace
of passion, desire, ostentation or self-interest, it is
certain that the results of all efforts will prove fruitless,
and he will become deprived and hopeless.


+P 43
     O ye Cohorts of God!  Praise be to God! -- that the
Blessed Perfection hath freed the necks from the bonds
and fetters and released all from racial attachments by
proclaiming, "Ye are all the fruits of one tree and the
leaves of one branch."  Be ye kind to the human world,
and be ye compassionate to the race of man, deal with
the strangers as you deal with the friends, be ye gentle
toward the outsiders as you are toward the beloved
ones, know the enemy as the friend, look upon the
satan as upon the angel, receive the unjust with the
utmost love like unto a faithful one, and diffuse far
and wide the fragrances of the musk of the gazelles of
Kheta and Khotan+F1 to the nostrils of the ravenous
wolves.
     Become ye a shelter and asylum to the fearful ones,
be ye a cause of tranquillity and cease to the souls and
hearts of the agitated ones, impart ye strength to the
helpless ones, be ye a remedy and antidote to the
afflicted ones, and a physician and nurse to the sick
ones.  Serve ye for the promotion of peace and concord
and establishe in this transitory world the foundation
of friendship, fidelity, reconciliation and truthfulness.
     O ye Cohorts of God!  Strive ye that this human
world may be changed into a luminous realm and this
mound of earth become the Paradise of ABHA.  Darkness
hath environed the world upon all sides.  Savage
tempers and inclination predominate.  The human
world has become the battlefield of the rapacious savages

and the arena of the heedless and ignorant ones.
The souls are either bloodthirsty wolves or beasts with
degenerate reason.  They are either deadly poison, or
worthless plants.  There are a few souls who in reality
have some humanitarian intentions and are thinking of
the well-being and prosperity of human kind.  You
must in this instance (that is, service to humanity)
sacrifice your lives, and in sacrificing your lives celebrate
happiness and beatitude.
     O ye Cohorts of God!  His Highness, the Supreme+F1
-- may my life be a sacrifice to Him! -- hath given up
His life, and at every moment the Blessed Perfection+F2
in His own life sacrificed hundreds of lives, endured
dire calamities and oppressions.  Laden with fetters
He was thrown into the dark dungeon, He was exiled
and banished to distant lands and finally passed His
days in the Most Great Prison+F3 .  Likewise a multitude
of friends drank the sweet chalice of martyrdom and
sacrificed soul, possession, family and relatives for the
Cause.  How many houses were overthrown!  How
many residences were pillaged and rapined!  How
many magnificent palaces were turned into a desolate
tomb!  All these phenomena transpired only that the
world of humanity may become a luminous realm;
ignorance be changed into wisdom, human souls become
merciful, warfare and bloodshed be destroyed to their
very foundation, and the Kingdom of Peace become
paramount over all men.  Now strive ye, that perchance
this Beloved of Hopes appear in the assemblage of the
world and this Providence become a realized fact.

     O ye Cohorts of God!  Beware lest ye offend the
feelings of anyone, or sadden the heart of any person,
or move the tongue in reproach of and finding fault with
anybody, whether he is friend or stranger, believer or
enemy.  Pray in behalf of all and entreat God for
forgiveness and bounty for all.  Beware, beware that
any soul take revenge or retaliate over another even if
he be a bloodthirsty enemy.  Beware, beware that any
one rebuke or reproach a soul, though he may be an
ill-wisher and an ill-doer.  Do ye not look upon the
creature, advance ye toward the Creator.  Behold ye
not the rebellious people, turn your faces toward the
Lord of Hosts.  Look ye not upon the ground, raise
your eyes to the world-illuminating Sun, which hath
transformed every atom of the gloomy soil into bright
and luminous substance.
     O ye Cohorts of God!  In the moment of catastrophe,
find ye patience, resignation and submission.
     The more the calamities are intensified the less become
ye disturbed.  Withstand ye, with perfect assurance,
the flood of trials and calamities, through the
power of His Highness, the Almighty.
     Last year some of the known and unknown, friends
and strangers, slandered, calumniated and presented
false accusations against these exiled ones, before the
throne of His Imperial Majesty, the Padeshah of the
Ottomans; while these oppressed ones were entirely
free from those calumnies.  The government, conformable
with prudent measures, arose to investigate these
calumnies and dispatched some commissioners (or examiners)
to this city.  Therefore it is evident that the
field which was found by the ill-wishers and the flood


+P 46
which was brought about by them, can neither be
written nor explained.  However, relying upon God,
we conducted ourselves with the utmost patience and
submission, resignation and calmness; so much so that
if one did not know anything about these matters, he
would have thought that we were in perfect ease of
soul, enjoying the tranquillity of heart and mind, and
were engaged in happiness and felicity.  The matters
reached to such an issue that the plaintiffs and calumniators
entered into alliance and intrigue with the officials,
in regard to the carrying out of the work of investigation.
Consequently, the plaintiff, the magistrate and
the witness became as one single soul.  Therefore it
is clear what things transpired!  But here one witnesses
the fairness and impartiality of His Imperial Majesty,
the Padeshah of the Ottomans, who so far has not
given any consideration to these slanders, statements,
stories and calumnies, but has dealt with the utmost
justice and equity.  Truly, I say, if there had been any
other person except this Padeshah, no trace of these
exiled ones would remain.  This is the truth!  We
must not overlook justice.  In reality today in the
Asiatic world, the Padeshah of the Ottoman Empire
and the Shah of Persia, Mozeffer-Eddin, are peerless
and have no equals.  If you could realize the degree
of the malignity of the enemies, and the wickedness and
mischief done by the ill-wishers, especially by the unkind
brother, both here and in Persia, and that notwithstanding
these seditions and villainies, these two
kings have treated us with tranquillity and mildness,
ye would undoubtedly feel sure that both are just.  If
they were like kings of bygone ages, unquestionably


+P 47
every day thousands of souls would have been deprived
of life in Persia.  Therefore pray ye earnestly in behalf
of these two kings, beseech for them protection and
confirmation in the threshold of the Almighty, and
ask for them, from God, victory and triumph; especially
for the Padeshah of the Ottoman Empire, who has
dealt at all times in justice with these exiled ones.

     O Thou Omnipotent God!  Perfume the nostrils of
the friends in the Occident with the breaths of the Holy
Spirit; and illumine the horizon of the West with the
light of guidance.  Make the remote ones the near
ones, change the strangers into compassionate friends,
awaken those who are asleep, and make heedful those
who are heedless.
     O Thou Glorious Lord!  Confirm and assist these
noble friends with Thy good pleasure, suffer them to
become the well-wishers of the known and unknown,
enter them in the world of the everlasting Kingdom,
confer upon them a share from the outpouring of the
Realm of Might, make them real Bahais and sincere
godly ones, deliver them from superficiality and establish
them in Truth, make them the signs of the Kingdom
and brilliant stars in the horizon of the world,
make them the cause of the prosperity and composure
of the world of humanity and the servants of the
universal peace, intoxicate all of them with the wine
of Thy commands and exhortations and grant to all
good morals and conduct in the path of Thy teachings.
     O my God!  The desire of this Servant of the
Threshold is to see that the friends of the West have
embraced the beloved of the East, and the individuals


+P 48
of the world of humanity are with the utmost kindness
the members of one assemblage, the drops of one ocean,
the birds of one rose-garden, the pearls of one sea,
the leaves of one tree and the rays of one sun.

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily, I received thy letter which proved thy yearning
to the Kingdom of God, thy exceeding desire to
the Beauty of God and thy great attachment unto the
Word of God.
     Know, verily, that thy letters did not reach me until
now; but I love thee with all my heart and my soul,
for the sake of God.
     Regarding thy presence, at this time, in this Brilliant
Spot+F1 -- it is not in accord with the wisdom revealed
in the Book.  But I pray God to make thee a
manifestation of His hidden favors, so that thou be
with me in His Sublime Kingdom.
     We send for thee and thy revered wife, stones of
the Greatest Name.+F2

O thou who art advancing unto God!
     Verily I pray to God to make thee and thy revered
husband -- under the shadow of His Greatest Name --
confirmed in all conditions, aided in the service of the
Cause of God with a confirmation on the part of the
Merciful Lord.

O ye two+F1 accepted ones in the Kingdom of God!
     Your letter was read and its contents caused joy and
happiness.  Thank God that in such a cycle ye have
stepped into the plane of existence, attained the glory
of the Lord of the Kingdom, obtained light from the
Sun of Truth and were ushered in under the shadow
of the Tree of Life in the paradise of joy.
     Give the name "Rooha" (i. e., Spiritual) to your
new born child, and let your own name be "Saffa" (this,
in Arabic, means Peter or Rock).

O ye two+F2 truthful believers!
     Your letter was received.  It contents were faith,
certainty and sincerity.  It was an evidence of perceiving
eyes, attentive ears and acute mind.  Were it not
so, ye would not have witnessed the lights of the Sun

of God.
     Although in body we are far from one another,
yet -- praise be to God! -- with life and heart we are
present in one assembly; we enjoy the spiritual meeting,

     Teach the dear child Rooha this commune:

     O God!  Rear this little babe in the bosom of Thy
love and give it milk from the breat of Providence.
Cultivate this fresh plant in the rose-garden of Thy
love and nurture it by showers from the clouds of

it to the divine world.  Thou art powerful and kind!
Thou art the Giver, the Bestower, whose blessings
precede all else!

O thou who art attracted by the Word of God!
     Verily, I read thy letter which contained new significances.
I ask God to make thee a new creature so that
the lights of human perfections may shine through thee
and to make thee kind hearted unto all human beings
so that thou mayest be a mercy unto souls, absolute
goodness to all, a sign of kindness, a word of tenderness.
Verily, thy Lord is the Mighty, the Powerful!
He reviveth whomsoever He wisheth by the spirit of
righteousness and granteth unto whom He wisheth
great bounty, guideth whom He wisheth unto the path
of life and confirmeth whom He desireth in attaining
the Kingdom of God.
     As to thee, be confident in the mercy of thy Lord,
and ask what thou desirest.  Verily, God is the Generous,
the Giver!


+P 51
O maid-servant of God, who art supplicating unto the
       Sublime Kingdom!
     Grieve not at the divine trails.  Be not troubled because
of hardships and ordeals; turn unto God, bowing
in humbleness and praying to Him, while bearing every
ordeal, contented under all conditions and thankful in
every difficulty.  Verily thy Lord loveth His maid-servants
who are patient, believing and firm.  He draws
them nigh unto Him through these ordeals and trials.
     Be not sorrowful on account of the departure of thy
good son.  He hath indeed departed from this narrow
and gloomy world which is darkened by unlimited
sorrow, unto the Kingdom which is spacious, illumined,
joyous and beautiful.  God delivered him from this
dark well and promoted him unto the Supreme Height!
He gave him wings whereby he soared to the heaven of
happiness.  Verily this is the great mercy from Him
who is precious and forgiving.

O thou who art advancing to the Dawning-point of
       Lights!
     Extend the hands of communion unto the sacred and
brilliant Threshold and read the following prayer:

     O my God!  O my God!  Glory be unto Thee for that
Thou hast confirmed me to the confession of Thy Oneness,
attracted me unto the word of Thy Singleness,
enkindled me by the fire of Thy love, and occupied me
with Thy mention and the service of Thy friends and
maid-servants.
     O Lord, help me to be meek and lowly and strengthen


+P 52
me in severing myself from all things and in holding
to the hem of the garment of Thy Glory, so that my
heart may be filled with Thy love and leave no space
for the love of the world and the attachment to its
qualities.
     O God!  Sanctify me from all else save Thee, purge
me from the dross of sins and transgressions and cause
me to possess a spiritual heart and conscience.
     Verily Thou art merciful and verily Thou art the
Generous, the Helper.

O thou dear maid-servant of God!
     Thy likeness (photograph) was received through
Mrs. .......... and was seen.  The light of faith
shone in thy brow and the smile of the Kingdom in
thy face.  When I saw that likeness, I supplicated and
implored, at the Threshold of the Lord of the Kingdom,
to make thee a dear one of the two realms and
to free thee from every fetter save the love of God.

O thou flower perfumed by the Breaths of the Love
       of God!
     Verily, I read thy written letter and have supplicated
unto God to receive thee in His Kingdom, to make
thee worthy to be called a child of the Kingdom, to be
firm in the Covenant of God as firm mountains and to
proclaim in His Great Covenant which He hath entered
into which the people of heaven and earth by a trace
of His Supreme Pen, until thou mayest be confirmed to
diffuse the fragrance of holiness in those climes and
regions.


+P 53
O thou who dost believe in the Unity of God!
     Know verily nothing will benefit a person save the
love of the Merciful One.  Nothing illuminates a man's
heart save the radiance which shines forth from the
Kingdom of God!  Put away every thought and doubtful
mentioning and keep thy thoughts entirely on that
which uplifts man to the heaven of the gift of God and
that which causes every bird that belongs to the Kingdom
to soar unto the incomparable realms, the center
of everlasting grandeur in this world.

O servant of God!
     What thou hast written and that which thou hast
retained in mind are evident.  Appreciate Mrs. ......
who reminds you of God and explains His divine
mysteries.
     Regarding thy question concerning a verse in the
22nd chapter of Exodus:  We gave a brief explanation
of it in a letter to Mrs. ..........  Please refer to
that.  Owing to the great (press of) work, I have
not the time for several explanations.
     I ask God that thou mayest attain such a state of
perception, as will enable thee to expound with knowledge
the words of the Holy Bible.

O thou who art supplicating unto the Kingdom of God!
     Rest assured in the mercy of thy Lord; be rejoiced
for my remembering thee; gladden thyself by the appearance
of the Kingdom of God, be attracted by the
fragrance of God and call out:  "Ya Baha El-ABHA!"
-- from the depths of thy heart with all meekness and


+P 54

supplication, attracted by the fire of the love of God.
(Then annoint or rub all the parts of the body.)
     Verily, I say unto thee, if thou attainest the condition
we demonstrate to thee (i.e., if thou followest the
directions given) be confident in the speedy recovery
through the favor of God.

O thou who art advancing unto the Kingdom of God!
     I ask God to make thee a helper to the maid-servants
of the Merciful, to walk in the path of salvation, to
disperse the clouds of doubt from the horizon of the
hearts, to make the sun of knowledge manifest unto
souls and spirits and to confirm thee in a matter which
will make thee to raise the banner of the Covenant in
the world.

O dear servant of God!
     Observe how dear thou wert that He guided thee to
the Kingdom of Light, and how near to His Threshold,
that He granted thee admission into His Court.  Thou
were poor in spirit; He led thee to the Heavenly
Treasure.  Thou wert in quest of illumination; He enlightened
thee through the rays of the Sun of Truth.
Thou wert athirst; He led thee to the Spring of Life.
Thou wert sick; He bestowed upon thee the Heavenly
Remedy.
     I have read thy letter and have considered its contents.
Know this:  That today whoever turns to the
Kingdom of the Glorious God, holds communion with
the Almighty One, the Omniscient, and lives wholly
the true and good life, the doors of progress and help


+P 55
will be opened unto him everywhere; such an one will
be aided, victorious and protected.
     Therefore, turn to the Supreme Kingdom, forget
thyself entirely and remain firm in the spiritual trials,
so that thou mayest see the favors of the Kingdom and
realize the heavenly confirmation.

O thou who art uttering the praise of God!
     Verily I read thy letter, which expressed thy surprise
at some of the commandments of the law of God, such
as that concerning the hunting of innocent animals.
Be not surprised at this.  Ponder over the contingent
realities, their mysteries, wisdom, connection and relations.
The world is harmonious in all things and the
connection therein is mighty and nothing is missing.
All things are eaters and eaten in the physical creation.
The plant sucks from the mineral, the animal eats and
swallows the plant, and the human eats the animal.
Then the mineral (in turn) eats the human body.
Physical bodies are transferred from death to death and
life to life.  Therefore, all things are subject to transfer
and change except the Cause of existence, which
cannot be changed or transferred, because it is the
foundation for life in all kinds and species and in all
possible realities in the world of creation.
     If thou observest closely through a microscope the
water which man drinks and the air which he breathes,
thou wilt see that in every breath which man breathes,
that breath contains numerous animals, and in every
draught of water great number of animals exist.  This
could not be prevented because the existent beings are
eaters and eaten and, by this, existence is caused; otherwise,


+P 56
the relations between existent things would cease.
When a thing decomposes and decays, being bereft of
life, it becomes promoted to a world of life greater than
the former.  For instance, it ceased in a mineral life
and was promoted to the vegetable life; then leaves the
vegetable life and is elevated to that of the animal;
then leaving the animal life it advances to the human,
and this is on account of the favor of thy Lord, the
Merciful, the Clement.
     I ask God to strengthen thee in comprehending the
mysteries deposited in the reality of existence, to lift
up the veil before thee and thy sister, so that the
concealed mystery and the hidden reality become manifest
as the sun at noon, and to confirm thy sister and thy
husband in entering the Kingdom of God, and heal thee
from all physical and spiritual disease in the world of
creation.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     Thy writing was considered.  I ask God that thy
mind+F1 may be illumined with the light of knowledge
and faith to the extent that thy face will radiate its
glory, even as a light, when set aglow in the lamp, will
cast its rays to the surrounding regions.
     I hope that the darkness of evil suggestions shall be
dispersed and that the veil of uncertainty shall be torn
asunder; that the beauty of truth may become manifest
with glory and the light of mercy become radiant.  Thus
mayest thou, O maid-servant of God, with thy honorable
husband and revered son, become free from the

      mind.
+P 57
severe trials and appear with grace in the gatherings
of the people of God.
     The nineteen-day fast+F1 is a duty to be observed by
all.  All should abstain from eating and drinking from
sunrise to sunset.  This fast is conducive to the spiritual
development of the individual.  The Greatest Name
should be read every day.

O thou lamp ignited by the fire of the Love of God!
     I ask God to make thee a sign of love, standard of
agreement, means of union and harmony and spreader
of peace among the people.
     O maid-servant of God!  Strive with all thy powers
in diffusing the spirit of real union among the people,
so that all who are on earth become one family, loving,
united, agreed, bound by the bonds of love and united
with all harmony in all things and conditions; this is
the greater happiness of the human race in the world
of possibilities and the cause of attaining to all hopes
and reaching unto the Supreme Kingdom, after ascending
unto the world of God.

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily, I chanted thy poem.  Its significance was
beautiful, its composition eloquent and its words excellent.
It was like the melody of the birds of holiness
in the paradise of El-ABHA.  The breasts of the maid-servants
of the Merciful were exhilarated by its chanting.
Blessed art thou for uttering forth such an excellent
poem and brilliant pearl.

1.  From March 2d to March 20th, inclusive.  The fast is kept by refraining
    from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset.
+P 58
     Verily, these verses shall be sung in the divine meetings
and in the assemblages of the spiritual in the
course of ages and centuries to come, for thou hast
uttered the praise of thy Lord and expressed significant
meanings in eulogy of thy Lord, the Merciful, the Clement.
All poems shall be forgotten in the course of
time save those that are extraordinary; thy poem shall
be chanted with melody and best voices in the Center of
Worship (or Mashrak-el-Azcar) forevermore.

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily, I read thy poem, which contained new significances
and beautiful words.  My heart was dilated by
its eloquent sense.  I prayed God to make thee utter
more beautiful compositions that this.  Thus thou
mayest be the first to praise the Beauty of El-ABHA
and the first utterer of His Name among the women.
     Chant the verses of guidance among the people and
commence [the composition of] melodies of great
beauty and effect in praise and glorification of the Generous
Lord.
     We sent those poems to all countries, so that the
friends of God may remember thee and pray for confirmation
and aid in this great Cause in thy behalf.
     O maid-servant of God!  Warble as birds in the
garden of joy and pray to thy forgiving Lord, so that
the souls may rejoice through the psalms of the descendant
of David.

O maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter reached me and I prayed God to bless
thee by His heavenly blessing in thy marriage with


+P 59
Mr. ........ and to confirm both of you with comfort
and repose and the turning of your heart to the
Kingdom of God.  May His divine providence abide
with you in all conditions and circumstances.

O thou bird of pleasing tones!
     Thy little book of poems, which were very sweet,
was read.  It was a source of joy, for it was a spiritual
anthem and a melody of the love of God.
     Continue as long as thou canst this melody in the
gatherings of the beloved; thus may the minds find rest
and joy and become in tune with the love of God.
When eloquence of expression, beauty of sense and
sweetness of composition unite with new melodies the
effect is very great, especially if it be the anthem of the
verses of oneness and the songs of praise to the Lord
of Glory.
     Endeavor your utmost to compose beautiful poems
to be chanted with heavenly music; thus may their
beauty affect the minds and impress the hearts of those
who listen.

O thou spiritual lad!
     May God uphold thee and edify thee in the flower
of thy youth and in the spring-time of thy life and may
He illumine thy face with the lights of advancement
unto God and turning unto the Kingdom of God.  If
thou become firm and steadfast in the love of God,
thou shalt be confirmed with a confirmation whereby thy
face will be gladdened, thy heart rejoiced and all thy
family will be happy and pleased.  Therefore, confine
thy thoughts and ideas in turning to God and submitting


+P 60
unto Him and chant the signs (verses) of
thanks and praise for that by reason of which He hath
strengthened thee to attain this great gift.

O thou daughter of the Kingdom!
     Thank and praise God that He hath cause thee to
drink from the cup of the gifts and caused thee to
suckle from the bosom of guidance while yet very
young and didst possess but a few years of age.  I beg
of God and hope that the love of God may be mingled
(and mixed) in thy flesh and bones and run in thy
whole being, like the running (or circulation) of the
spirit in the veins and in the arteries.

O thou who art ignited through the brilliant Flame
        which is blazing in this Blessed Spot!
     Verily, I considered the meanings of thy letter and
my heart overflows with perfect and spiritual love unto
thee and unto the beloved ones of God, whose eyes are
brightened by witnessing the lights of God and whose
innermost hearts are purified by the love of God and
whose consciences are made clear by the knowledge of
God and whose hearts are tranquilized by the commemoration
of God.  Theirs is the treasury of the
Kingdom and the abundant wealth of the storehouse
of the divine world!  They are wealthy, not poor; they
are powerful, not weak; they are grandees, not mean
persons; and they are kindred, not strangers!  Because,
verily, their wealth and honor is divine and supreme and
will never be consumed.  Blessed are they!  Glad-tidings
be unto them!
     As to those souls who are preaching the Word of


+P 61
God, it behooveth them to shake the dust of every land
which they have passed by off their shoes and to be with
God and without need of the rich -- although their bed
is the soil, their light is the stars of the sky and their
food is the herbs of the desert -- because theirs is the
wealth of the Kingdom, the honor of the realm of
might and the bounty of the divine world; and they are
not in want of this world and its cares.  Their throne
is the mat of humility, their honor is in suffering every
lowliness in the path of the Loving Lord and their
wealth is being empty-handed from the pomps of the
world and its vanities and their provision is trusting in
God and being severed from all that is on the earth and
its wealth.
     As to thee:  Associate thou with the poor and be
united with the weak souls and hold intercourse with
the needy, with a compassionate heart and great love.
Because thereby is ordained for thee an eternal glory
in the Kingdom of God.  Invite thou the people to the
Exalted World, to the Supreme Horizon and to the
Kingdom of El-ABHA!
     There is no harm in thy loneliness in those regions;
for verily, the hosts of confirmation are thy help, thy
Glorious Lord is thy protector and the angels of the
Kingdom are thy fellow-speakers.  Glad-tidings be unto
thee for this!  Blessed art thou for this!

***O maid-servant of God!
     If thou seekest eternal glory, let thyself be humble
and meek in the presence of the beloved of God; make
thyself the servant of all, and serve all alike.  The
service of the friends belongs to God, not to them.

light gleaming from the lamp of the Alliance and to
quicken thy mind by the spirit which out-pours from
the Kingdom of God and to make thee a sign of His
signs which are shining in the horizons.  He grants
that which He wisheth and to whomsoever He wisheth.
Verily, He is powerful and mighty!

O servant of God!
     Faith is the magnet which draws the confirmation of
the Merciful One.  Service is the magnet which attracts
the heavenly strength.  I hope thou wilt attain
both.

O maid-servant of God!
     How blessed thou hast been to have entered the
Kingdom of God!  HOw near thou hast been to the
Paradise of ABHA to have been ushered in!
     I hope that thou mayest become a source of joy to
the hearts, a good example for people, imbued with
spiritual qualities in the world of humanity, and mayest
promulgate the divine teachings, so that the various
people may find unity and become freed from discord.

O thou who art advancing toward God!
     Verily I read thy letter of wonderful expression
and eloquent composition and thanked God that He
hath poured upon thee the bounty of guidance and
hath made thy heart a lamp of piety.
     Verily I beseech God, with all humbleness, to remove
the covering from thine insight and to show unto
thee His great signs, and to make thee a banner of
guidance, severed from all else save Him, enkindled
with the fire of His love, engaged in His praise and
apprehending the realities of things; so that thou mayest
see with thine eyes, hear with thine ears and not
imitate any of the fathers and ancestors; have perception
in the matter of thy Lord, for the people are in
dark veils.  By God, the True One, verily the doors
of the everlasting paradise are opened before the faces
of the devoted ones and the Tree of Life therein overshadows
the spiritual ones.  Happy are those who enter
it and are sheltered under its shadow!

O thou candle shining by the light of the Love of God!
     That which thou hast inscribed and conceived of in
thy mind was manifest and clear.  The contents indicate
spiritual signs and the meanings were like unto
a sweet chalice.  I trust in God that thy pure mind
may become reflective of light; thus thou mayest become
prepared for the divine manifestation and attract
the light of guidance from the Heavenly Star.
     O servant of God!  Through the power of God's
love the weak become mighty, the poor become rich,
the little bird becomes a great eagle soaring on the


+P 64
ethereal wave, the tiny plant grows into a great palm
tree.
     O servant of God!  Trials and tests are severe.  If
thou seekest progress and advancement in the Kingdom,
remain firm and withstand.  When it is possible
for thee to visit this land+F1 in all fragrance and spirituality,
thou art permitted to come.
     If thou canst help the up-building of the Mashrak-el-Azcar
in Chicago, it will be most acceptable.

O maid-servant of God!
     I am in the blessed place of the Holy Land and thou
art in foreign parts and I do not see thee with my material
eyes, but I see thee with the eyes of my heart and
I remember thee in recalling to thee that which the
Christ promised to the believers, the great blessing and
favor, the light of which illuminates those present and
those absent.
     O maid-servant of God!  Be thou rejoiced because
of this good news which draws (inclines) the sanctified
hearts from all wordly conditions and know thou the
value of this great gift (favor) and do not exchange
it for the great sovereignty (of the world), for, verily,
the sovereignty of the world is a mortal rule and follows
pride.  However, this gift is an eternal and a
divine favor, the light of which illumines the passing
of times and periods.

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily, I noted thy letter and utterance.  God hath
accepted thy devotion, prayer and worship and hath


------------------------

+P 65
manifested upon thee the lights of His great favor,
ushered thee into His Kingdom, gave thee to drink of
the wine of His love and made thee to hear the melodies
of the birds of holiness in this wonderful day.
     Thank God that He enriched thee beyond the delicacies
of this mortal world and caused thee to taste the
sweetness of His love in His New Kingdom.
     O maid-servant of God!  It is incumbent upon thee,
since thou hast attained the knowledge of God and His
love, to sacrifice thy spirit and all thy conditions for
the life of the world, bearing every difficulty for the
comfort of the souls, sinking to the depth of the sea
of ordeals for the sake of the love of faithfulness and
burning with the fire of torture and regret like unto a
lamp while the light is shining from thee unto the
surroundings.
     O maid-servant of God!  The mystery of sacrifice
is that man should sacrifice all his conditions for the
divine station of God.  The station of God is mercy,
kindness, forgiveness, sacrifice, favor, grace and giving
life to the spirits and lighting the fire of His love in the
hearts and arteries.  I asked God to make thee a sign
of mercy, the banner of kindness among His
maid-servants.
     O maid-servant of God!  Sing with beautiful melodies
in the meetings of the maid-servants, praising
and glorifying thy Supreme Lord.
     O maid-servant of God!  The human spirit hath an
impression and effect in the world, but the divine Spirit
giveth life to the souls and conferreth eternal life upon
those who are attracted to the fragrances of God.  This
is the Great Cause from the Kingdom of thy Lord.


+P 66
Be attached to this New Spirit which hath effective
power in the realities of things and creates new
creatures.
     O maid-servant of God! forsake every thought,
every remembrance and every praise, while holding
to the Word of God.  Confine thy interests, thy works
and efforts to the Cause of God.  Thus the spirit of
power and might will confirm thee and the manifest
light will shine upon thy brow.

O servant of God!
     I was very happy to receive thy letter because it
showed thy servitude to the One God and indicated
belief and assurance in the Cause of His Presence.
Thank God that thou art favored with this blessing,
that thou servest the friends of God and thou waitest
at the Threshold of the Merciful.  I beg of God that
thou mayest be baptized by the baptism of BAHA'O'LLAH
and become free from all the stains of the
mortal world and that thou mayest take delight in the
favors of God in the paradise of unity, and that thou
mayest be able to become pleasing to God and mayest
appear with thy face illuminated as a candle in the
world of eternity.

O thou spiritual friend!
     Verily, I was informed of the contents of thy letter
and increased gratitude unto God, for that He hath
granted the friends clear consciences, pure and holy
hearts, attraction unto the Kingdom of God, enkindlement
by the fire of the love and humbleness to God.
     Glad-tidings unto ye for this abundant blessing, sufficient


+P 67
bounties, wide mercy, glorious appearances;
therefore, be united in hearts and spirits, strive so that
ye may obtain the great favors, attain to the overflowing
chalice, perform charity (good deeds), gain the
spirit of life, attracted by the fragrance and depend on
the Lord of Signs.  At that time your faces will be
illumined, your souls holy, your hearts severed from
this world and attached to the Supreme Concourse,
and you will call out with the most loud voice:  &amp;Glad-tidings
unto us through these divine favors and blessed
are we by this heavenly guidance!&amp;
     I was glad in heart when I saw thy likeness in the
photograph and looked at the resemblance like the
reality of thy identity and thanked God witnessing the
light of God in thy beautiful face.

O thou kind friend!
     Thy letter was received and its contents considered.
Man must, under all conditions, be thankful to God,
the One, for it is said in the blessed text:  "If ye be
thankful I will increase thee."
     Man must seek shelter in the mercy and protection
of God, for he is constantly subject to a hundred thousand
dangers.  Save for the refuge and protection of
the Most High, man is without shelter.
     I ask God to help thy children to gain knowledge, to
attain virtues and morals which are the refinements of
the reality of man, and to strengthen thee to remain
firm.
     Convey my respect and greeting to Mr.........
and Mrs. .........  I trust in the providence of
God that thou mayest ascertain what is worthy and


+P 68
fitting for Bahais, and that day by day the love of God
may increase in the hearts.

O maid-servant of God!
     Be exceedingly grateful to the maid-servant of God,
Mrs......... who guided thee, led thee to the Kingdom
of Glory and invited thee to the heavenly table,
so that thou mayest attain eternal life and enjoy the
happiness of the Kingdom.
     Thou didst write:  "How can I serve Thee?"  The
greatest service is thine own firmness and steadfastness
and thy withstanding severe trials when they come.
Through firmness thou wilt perceive the opening of the
doors of grace.

O thou plant in the garden of the Love of God!
     Open the tongue of praise to the Horizon of ABHA,
for having received light from Him in the age of youth,
and for having been planted by Him in the paradise of
glory.
     I hope thou shalt be a child of the Kingdom, shalt
learn sciences, arts and significances, may become a full
grown tree, fruitful and green in the vineyard of God
and be happy and full of cheer through the showers of
the clouds of paradise.

O maid-servant of God!
     I rejoiced to read thy letter, for it indicated thy
progress unto the Kingdom of thy Glorious Lord, thy
wish to serve in His vineyard and thy faith in this
Cause which has shed its light upon those regions.
     Blessed art thou for having opened the door of thy


+P 69
home unto the people to come and hear of the
Kingdom.
     The maid-servant of God remembered thee in her
letter, mentioning thy great joy and progress in the
Cause of thy Lord.
     Verily, I pray God to make thy home a center for
the radiation of light and the glowing of His love in
the hearts of His people.  Know that in every home
where God is praised and prayed to, and His Kingdom
proclaimed, that home is a garden of God and a
paradise of His happiness.

O Spiritual Assembly+F1 !
     Everything produces an impression in existence and
results in the course of ages.  The (earthly) assemblies
established in the different parts of Europe, Asia and
America have no results save the help of the physical
and the mortal life in this lesser world, for the removal
of its conditions and reformation of its customs,
and in the end no name will remain thereof.  But
every spiritual assembly of solid foundation, good
structure and unwavering constancy will last forever
and will send forth its illumination unto all regions.
     Observe the gatherings of the disciples after Christ:
Their light is still shining, their power is still revealing
and their trumpets still resounding throughout the
ages.  Such is the spiritual meeting.

     O God!  Confirm them in the promotion of Thy
Word among the people and in strengthening and multiplying
Thy servants.  Verily Thou art the Bounteous,
the Merciful!

O ye+F1 two birds warbling in the Garden of Wisdom.
     Verily, I saw your photographs, whose beauty
proved the turning of your hearts unto the Center of
Guidance and the dilation of your breasts by the appearance
of the Kingdom of God.  The light of God
is verily shining in the face of the man who is of the
Kingdom, spiritual, heavenly, divine and Bahai.  The
rest among the people are like animals; nay, they are
led astray from the Path.
     Thank God for that He enlightened your faces by
the light of guidance, deposited in your hearts the
sign of faith, and made you of the chosen ones in this
new century.
     The truth I say unto you!  If ye were aware of what
God hath destined for you in the kingdom of His glory,
verily ye would rejoice exceedingly and soar with the
wings of joy unto the heights of happiness, crying with
the most loud voice:  &amp;Blessings and happiness from
this great attainment and evident bounty.&amp;

O thou handsome child!
     Thy spiritual father and thy good mother sent me
thy radiant picture and I rejoiced on seeing it.  I pray
God to illumine thy heart with the light of the Manifestation,
to nurture thee in His mercy so that thou
mayest attain maturity in His love; thy spirit be enlightened
with beholding His light and thy spirit revived
by the bounty of the Holy Spirit, so that thou
mayest be a sign of the love of God, speaking in the
name of God, joyous by the favors of God, attaining

unto the sea of the mercy of God, and being baptized
with the water of life, the fire of love and the spirit of
attraction.

O thou blooming rose in the garden of the Love of
        God!
     Verily, the heavenly angels address thee from the
Supreme Horizon, saying:  &amp;O maid-servant of God!
Be rejoiced for God hath chosen thee for His love and
sheltered thee under the shade of His Kingdom, the
lights of which shone forth, the signs of which were
manifested, the mysteries of which were unfolded, the
fragrance of which emanated, the waves of which
surged, the causes of which were promulgated, the suns
of which appeared, the moons of which shone and the
stars of which sparkled.&amp;
     Therefore, praise God for that He honored thee
with presence in this great century and new cycle and
caused thee to attain this new bounty.
     I ask God to send down upon thee a blessing and
upon thy family a favor from His Kingdom.

O thou who art anticipating the appearance of the Gift
        of God!
     Verily, I read thy letter which indicated that thou
hast turned unto the Blessed Spot, that the Truth (of
God) hath revealed itself to thee, that thy fear is
quieted and that thou hast attained to composure, assuredly
believing in this great Cause.
     Know thou, verily, there are many veils in which
the Truth is enveloped:  gloomy veils; then delicate
and transparent veils; then the envelopment of Light,


+P 72
the sight of which dazzles the eyes, as doth the sun
which is enveloped only in its own light and, as we look
at it, the sight is blinded and eyes are dazzled.
     I beg of God to remove all the veilings and familiarize
the light with all eyes, so that man may not be
veiled from witnessing the Sun of Truth.
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily, the tests and trials
of God are very great and very violent.  Beseech thou
God to protect thee from all doubts and to guard thee
from the interpretations of parabolical+F1 verses, as made
by those who know not in what valley they are roving,
who speak according to their own selfish purposes and
after their own evil inclinations; who accept and then
reject; who believe in God and then deny Him; and
who appear firm and then backslide:  thus thou beholdest
these oscillating daily.
     "Leave them to amuse themselves with their own vain
discourses," and turn thou to the light of the Testament,
and rejoice at the bounty of the effulgence, and seek
shelter under the shadow of the standard of the Covenant.
Thou wilt soon find it fluttering on the highest
summits of glory, surrounded by the valiant hosts of
the angels of heaven and assisted by spiritual armies of
great number that proceed from the Supreme
Concourse.

O my tender friend!
     Verily, the union between myself and thee is on a
solid foundation and a well made basis.  Neither the
winds can remove it nor the events of time annihilate

it.  It is everlasting and eternal, heavenly, spiritual and
divine, and it is of no end or termination.  Consequently
be rejoiced at these words which cheer the
hearts of the righteous and the souls of the pious when
hearing them.

O thou lamp who art illuminated with the light of the
        Love of God!
     Leave thou the world and abandon the people and
turn unto the Kingdom of thy independent Lord.  Beseech
Him every morn and eve and supplicate to the
Gate of His Oneness to make thee firm and steadfast
in the Testament and to guard thee from all calamities,
with the eye of His protection, and protect thee from
the tests which are (so violent) as the whirlwinds which
uproot trees.

O thou who hearest and seest in this wonderful Cause!
     Verily, I read thy interesting letter, its beautiful
composition and I noted its purpose which indicated
spiritual aspiration to the Kingdom of thy Great Lord.
     Thank God for guiding thee unto the Straight Path,
manifesting unto thee the Evident Light.  He shall
give thee a draught of the cup whereby thy spiritual
power will be increased.  Thou shalt advance unto the
Lofty Station, acquire heavenly qualities and attain
knowledge of the significances of the words of God in
this glorious day.
     It is incumbent upon thee to turn wholly unto the
Kingdom of God, to enter entirely into this wonderful
Cause, and to make thy thought, remembrance and
effort confined to the education of thy character, the enlightenment


+P 74
through the Light of ABHA, and to guide
the people to the Source of the mercy of thy Lord, the
Clement, the Merciful.
     Comfort thy mother and endeavor to do what is conducive
to the happiness of her heart.  Approach not
those who are drowned in the sea of this world, but
rather be enkindled by the fire of the love of God.  Be
thou such a flame whereby the hearts may be set aglow.
     It is incumbent upon thee to assemble continuously
with the beloved of God and to meet with those whose
faces are illumined with the light of the love of God.
Verily, I supplicate to God to make thee sincere in this
love, to illumine thee with the light of His Kingdom,
to destine unto thee the illumination by the light of His
attributes, to make thee a sign of mercy, a bird warbling
the verses of unity; that thou mayest be nurtured
in the bosom of His providence, and become a growing
tree bearing fruit in the Paradise of El-ABHA.
     Verily, thy Lord confirmeth him whom He willeth,
and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.

O thou who art agitated as oceans by the winds blown
        from the direction of the Kingdom of God!
     Verily I read thy wonderful letter, declaring the
grandeur of thy nature and the excess of thy love and
thine attaining the knowledge of God.  Verily its contents
were as spiritual meanings poured forth from a
heart throbbing by the spirit of the love of God.  I beseech
God to confer on thee, and on thy noble husband,
a perfect favor from His Supreme Kingdom, until your
faces may sparkle by its light, among the creatures, and

by which the fame of your love in God may be renowned

     By my life, this is a favor for which the angels of
heaven and the spirits of the holy ones are longing in
the Supreme World.  And (I beg God) to prepare for
you your greatest desire -- that is, the attaining (the
visit to) the blessed, perfumed, amber-scented Tomb,+F1
diffused in all horizons.

     +F2 Verily, I read thy magnificent letter, thy brilliant
writing, and found its meanings as the chanting of the
verses of guidance and its foundation based on righteousness
and piety.  Verily I beseech God to make thee
a sign of supplication, humbleness and submissiveness
unto God, so that thou mayest commune with thy Lord,
in the gloomy hours of night and in the morn and eve
while being enkindled with the fire of the love of God,
attracted to His fragrances of holiness, strengthened by
His Spirit, speaking His praise and bowing down before
His Threshold of Sanctity.  Verily, He is the
Assister, the Beneficent!
     Then know thou that, verily, the hosts of confirmation
from the Kingdom of God will assist every soul
who is severed from aught else save God, is associated
with the commemoration of God and is rejoiced at the
glad-tidings of God.  Cut thyself from this world and
rely on the Supreme Concourse, so that thou mayest

become illuminated with a light shining forth from the
Kingdom of El-ABHA.

O thou who art enkindled by the fire of the Love of

     Verily, I was informed of the text of thy letter,
wherein thou praisest the firm servant of God, Mirza
........ and was rejoiced in heart for the signs of
joy which are manifested in thee in this illustrious day.
I ask God to make thee a sign of guidance, fountain of
knowledge and a caller in His name, the Merciful, so
that the hearts may become gladdened by the mention
of God and the souls be led to the Kingdom of God,
to this Great Dwelling Place and Sublime Home.
     As to the four stations which I refer to in the divine
treatise:  I ask God to open the door before thy face,
that thou mayest enter therein, that thou mayest attain
to its lights and become informed of its mysteries.  I
shall not give a detailed explanation thereof, on account
of the great work (i. e., because of the exceeding
press of business).
     Regarding the treatise (or pamphlet) which thou
didst compile in proof of the appearance of the Kingdom
of God -- thou didst well!  I shall read it at a
leisure time, and ask God to aide thee in compiling other
useful writings in demonstration of God.
     As to organization of other meetings for the maid-servants
of the Merciful, for the spread of the fragrances
of God; this is the best deed and most complete
action.  I ask God to strengthen thee in this matter
so that you may organize many gatherings for the spread
of the teachings of God.  Thus the Lord of Hosts will
confirm you by armies of the Supreme Concourse and
hosts of the angels of heaven.  Verily it is the army of
inspiration and the hosts of benediction.

O thou who art marching onward to God!
     I have read thy beautiful letter which contained
delicate meanings, and I am made glad by its contents

God to send down upon thee a blessing from the Kingdom
of Heaven and thus make thy heart beat with joy
in the love of God, and make thee meek and humble
before the good maid-servants of God, and pure and
holy in His Kingdom.***

O thou who art submissive and humble before the
        Holy Threshold!
     Know thou, verily, submissiveness is the good quality
of the maid-servants of God, and humility is the
character of the God-fearing leaves+F1 who have sprung
forth from the Tree of Mercifulness.
     Thou oughtest to be characterized with these, that
thou mayest be an example for the maid-servants of
the Merciful and a leader of the leaves who are moved
by the winds of the love of God.  Abandon the concerns
of mankind and be naturalized with the attributes
of the angels of the Supreme Concourse, because these
angels humble themselves to the lowest thing of the
things despite their honor, glory, the loftiness of station
and the greatness of their might.  This is seemly
to the unitarian women and an honor for those women
who are surely believing in God!  This is the consolation
of the heart of the God-fearing women, and this
is a tranquility to the soul of those women who are attracted
to the fragrances of the Lord of Signs!

letter, whereby the feelings of thy heart and the
loftiness of thy thoughts and the craving of thy spirit
for the Kingdom of God were expressed.
     Thank thou God that He hath given thee a power
for discriminating the reality of things, hath made thy
feet firm in the Path, hath made thy heart overflowing
with His love and hath exhilarated thee with the wine
of His knowledge.
     I beg of God to entirely remove the veiling from
thine insight, so that thou mayest become duly cognizant
of the teachings of Baha'.  And I beg of God
to forgive thy sins and to illumine thy face with the
light of forgiveness, so that thou mayest conquer the
self which desires the earthly world and prevent it
from its wishes and appetites.
     As to the spiritual meeting which ye have organized
for diffusing the fragrances of God (i. e., for teaching
the Truth), this is a good thing that ye have performed.
I beg of God, to make the Holy Spirit breathe
there in such fragrances which may perfume all
regions.
     Be not grieved at the smallness of your number and
thank God for the power of your spirits.  He shall assist
you with such a confirmation whereat minds will be
astonished and souls will be amazed.

     Verily, I have read thine eloquent letter and brilliant
writing, which indicated the attraction of the people of
God by the fragrances of His Kingdom, and their
gathering in the assembly of the merciful feelings and
the congregation of the upright.
     I do supplicate God to confirm that spiritual assembly,
that gathering of commemoration, to that whereby
the merciful faces brighten, and I beseech Him to assist
them and thee to that whereby man ascends the
highest and noblest station of excellence and the loftiest
apex of honor, to make them humble and courteous
before the beloved of God, to become severed from
aught else save God, to beseech the Kingdom of
ABHA, to be freed from every mention save the commemoration
of God, and to be sanctified from all the
grades of passion and desire, with pure, holy hearts
which are devoid of every feeling except entire attention
unto God, the Lord of the present and the world

also a Tablet to the assembly+F1 ; read it unto them with

perfected.
     Make you feet firm in the love of God, arise to
carry on the teachings of God, purify souls from desire
and illumine faces with the light of guidance; so that
ye may obtain the might gift and the great mercy.

O ye+F1 sincere ones and ye who are attracted and moved
        by the breeze of the favor of God!
     Verily, I have read the names of your beloved assembly
which deserves to be mentioned with sanctity
and which attracts the confirmation of the loving Lord
and seeks to attain to the favors of God, the Mighty,
the Compassionate!
     I beseech God at all times, with all supplication,
humility and lowliness, to confirm these souls who have
no purpose in their deliberation and consultations save
to seek the merciful bounties and the divine invisible
confirmations.
     I hope and request, through the bounty of my Lord,


------------------------
1.  To the Racine assembly.
+P 83
that the greatest assistance and the most eminent confirmation
be granted unto you when ye are firm and
steadfast and withstand every difficulty which may befall
you in spreading the Cause of God in those
regions.
     By the life of God, all the confirmations of the Kingdom
of God will surround those whose hearts are firm,
whose feet are steadfast and whose souls are tranquilized
in the Most Great Cause.
     Consider ye the past centuries, how a single one of
the beloved of God withstood all the people on the
earth because of his firmness in the love of God, and
his entire turning of the heart toward the Kingdom of
God and with the cup of his heart overflowing with the
wine of the knowledge of God.
     Be ye assured with the greatest assurance that, verily,
God will help those who are firm in His Covenant
in every matter, through His confirmation and favor,
the lights of which will shine forth unto the east of the
earth, as well as the west thereof.  He will make them
the signs of guidance among the creation and as shining
and glittering stars from all horizons.
     Consequently, do ye beseech unto God and pray and
supplicate Him and ask Him for the greatest gift and
eminent favor.

O thou who hast acknowledged the Kingdom of God!
     I received thy letter wherein thou hast confessed the
appearance of the Kingdom of God at this time, declared
His Oneness and believed in His Words.  Blessed
art thou for this clear confession!  Thank the maid-servant
of God .............. for she hath guided


+P 84
thee to this Path and declared to thee the Call of God.
Shouldst thou offer all the treasures of the earth to
her, they would not equal this great guidance.
     Depend upon God, be sincere and sever thyself from
all else save Him.  Thus thou wilt receive the teaching
of God and thy heart will be made happy.  May thy
tongue praise Him and thy sight behold the light shining
from the Sun of Truth.
     Verily, this is a rich blessing for which the saints of
the past longed.  Be happy and say:  &amp;God chooses for
His favors whomsoever He willeth.  He is the Merciful,
the Generous!&amp;

O ye who are set aglow with the fire of God's Love!
     Blessed are ye for having been chosen by God for
His love, in this new age, and joy be to you for having
been guided to the Great Kingdom!  Verily, your Lord
hath chosen you to show the path to the Kingdom of
God, among the people.  The attracted maid-servant of
God, ............ praised you in beautiful expressions
and informed me of your earnest endeavors in
serving, teaching and offering the chalice of Truth to
the maid-servants of God.  I rejoiced to hear of your
efforts in the Cause of God.  This is indeed good
service.

O thou who art turning unto God!
     Thy letter was an inheritance of joy and happiness
unto me, for its significance was a supplication and an
entreaty unto God to make thee a pure servant, exempt
from all material desires, sanctified and severed from
all save God, that thou mayest be characterized with


+P 85
the attributes of the heavenly angels, cleansed from all
desires and earthly wishes, with thy heart severed
from all save the knowledge of the divine teachings.
Verily, I pray God to nourish thee upon the breast of
bounty and rear thee in such a manner that all men of
learning shall be amazed, and to make thee a miracle
of guidance among the servants.

O thou who art attracted to God!
     I send this letter written by my own hand, that thou
mayest thank God, thy Lord, the Supreme, grow in
happiness in the love of God and be kindled by the fire
of His love, chanting verses of greetings and thanks,
and be quickened by the breezes of life blown from the
garden of the knowledge of God.

O thou opened rose in the garden of El-ABHA!
     I have perused thy excellently worded letter showing
what is moving in thy heart by the emotions of the love
of God.
     O maid-servant of God!  Chant the Words of God
and, pondering over their meaning, transform them
into actions!  I ask God to cause thee to attain a high
station in the Kingdom of Life forever and ever.

O thou who art tested with a great calamity!
     Be not grieved nor troubled because of the loss
which hath befallen thee -- a loss which caused the tears
to flow, sighs to be produced, sorrow to exist and hearts
to burn in great agony; but know, this hath reference
only to the physical body, and if thou considerest this
matter with a discerning and intelligent eye, thou wilt


+P 86
find that it hath no power whatsoever, for separation
belongeth to the characteristics of the body.  But concerning
the spirit, know that thy pure son shall be with
thee in the Kingdom of God and thou shalt witness his
smiling face, illumined brow, handsome spirit and real
happiness.  Accordingly, thou wilt then be comforted
and thank God for His favor upon thee.

O thou who art patient and resigning thyself to the
        judgment (of God)!
     Be not grieved at the calamity which hath unexpectedly
come upon thee and for the misfortune which
heavily weigheth upon thee.  It behooveth one like
thee to endure every trial, to be pleased with the decree
and to commit all thy affairs to God, so that thou mayest
be a calm, approved and pleasing soul before God.
Know thou, that thy beloved son hath soared, with the
wing of soul, up to the loftiest height which is never-ending
in the Kingdom of God.  Rejoice at this great
prosperity which the chosen ones were longingly asking
from the Holy and Exalted Threshold (of God).
Truly, I say unto thee, wert thou informed of the position
in which is thy son, thy face would be illuminated
by the lights of happiness and thou wouldst thank thy
forgiving Lord therefor and thou wouldst long for ascending
to that praiseworthy position.

O thou who hast humbled thyself before the Kingdom
        of God!
     Blessed art thou that thine heart is attracted to the
Beauty of God, is illumined with the light of knowledge
and the ray of the Kingdom hath shone  within it.


+P 87


Know thou, verily, God is with thee under all circumstances
and guards thee from the concerns of the world
and makes thee a servant in His great vineyard.
     As to thy question concerning training children:  It
is incumbent upon thee to nurture them from the breast
of the love of God, to urge them towards spiritual matters,
to turn unto God and to acquire good manners,
best characteristics and praiseworthy virtues and qualities
in the world of humanity, and to study sciences
with the utmost diligence; so that they may become
spiritual, heavenly and attracted to the fragrances of
sanctity from their childhood and be reared in a religious,
spiritual and heavenly training.  Verily, I beg
of God to confirm them therein.
     As to thy revered husband:  It is expedient that
thou shouldst behave toward him in the best way and
persevere in his good pleasure (i. e., please him) and
treat him with kindness under all aspects; until (or so
that) he may find that through thy turning toward the
Kingdom of God (i. e., by becoming a believer) thy
affection toward him and thy love for God is increased
and that thou hast regard for his good will in every
condition.
     Verily, I beg of God to make thee steadfast in His
love and to cause thee to diffuse the fragrances of
sanctity in those places (i. e., to teach the Truth).

O thou loving torch, flaming by the fire of the Love of
        God!
     Verily, I read thy letter sent by thee and was rejoiced
in heart by the wonderful meaning and eloquent
content, which proved thy extreme sincerity in the


+P 88
Cause of God, thy steadfastness in the path of the
Kingdom of God and thy firmness in the religion of
God, forasmuch as this is of the utmost importance
before God.
     How many souls advanced unto God, entered the
shadow of the Word of God and became celebrated in
the world, as Judas Iscariot.  Then, when the tests became
severe and trials great, their feet turned from
the path; turned from confession to denial; changed
from love and affection to severe enmity.  Then the
power of tests, whereby the foundations shake, were
manifested.
     Judas Iscariot was one of the greatest disciples, was
called unto Jesus; he thought that Jesus increased his
kindness to Peter, the disciple, when saying to him:
"Thou art Peter; upon thee I shall build my church."
This speech affecting Peter with special impression
whereby envy was created in the heart of Judas and,
therefore, he turned after advancing, denied after confessing,
hated after loving, until he became the cause
of the crucifixion of the Glorious Lord and Manifest
Light.  This is the end of envy which causes people to
turn from the right path.  Such has taken place and
will occur in this Great Cause; but there is no harm in
it, as it is the cause of manifesting the firmness of the
rest and the arising of the firm souls who are as solid
as the lofty mountains in the love of the Manifest
Light.
     As to thee, convey unto the maid-servants of the
Merciful that they must be firm in the love of El-Baha
at the time of the severe trials and tests; forasmuch as
the storms and winds occur during the winter seasons;


+P 89
then comes the spring with the wonderful scenery and
it adorns the hills and plains with flowers and beautiful
birds sing the melodies of joy on the branches of the
trees and warble beautiful tunes on the roofs of bowers,
in wonderful melodies.  Soon shalt thou see that
the lights have shone forth, the banners of the Kingdom
have been raised, the fragrances of God diffused,
the hosts of the Kingdom descending, the angels of
heaven confirmed and the Holy Spirit breathed into
those horizons (regions).  Then shalt thou see the
waverers frightened and at loss.  This is a complete
matter on the part of the Lord of Signs.
     Blessed art thou for keeping firm in the Cause of
God.  I pray God to give thee a divine spirit, spiritual
blood and to make thee a growing and thriving leaf on
the Tree of Life, so that thou mayest serve the maid-servants
of God in fragrance and spirituality.
     Thy generous Lord will confirm thee in serving in
His great vineyard and will make thee an instrument
for spreading the spirit of concord and union among
the maid-servants of the Merciful, will open thine insight
by the light of knowledge and forgive thee thy
sins and change them to good deeds.
     Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful and
Possessor of Great Bounty!

O maid-servant of God who art swayed like a strong
        branch by the breeze of God!
     I have read thy letter which evinces the abundance
of thy love and the warmth of thy devotion and thy
zeal in acknowledging God.
     Commit thyself to God; give up thy will and choose


+P 90
that of God; abandon thy desire and lay hold on that
of God; that thou mayest be a holy, spiritual and heavenly
example among the maid-servants of God.
     O maid-servant of God!  Know thou that in the
sight of God, the conduct of women is the same as that
of men.  All are the creatures of God and He has
created them after His form and likeness; that is to
say, after the form and likeness of the Manifestations
of His names and His attributes.  From the spiritual
point of view, therefore, there is no difference between
women and men.  "The nearer we draw to God, the
nearer He comes to us" without regard to whether the
person be a man or a woman.  How many women,
thus drawn to God, have surpassed men in the shadow
of Baha' in bringing men under it -- women famous
throughout the world!
     The House of Justice, however, according to the
positive commandments of the Doctrine of God, has
been specialized to the men, for a (specific) reason or
exercise of wisdom on the part of God, and this reason
will presently appear, even as the sun at midday.
     And as to you -- you other maid-servants attracted
by the perfume of God -- establish spiritual gatherings
(assemblies) and heavenly meetings.  This work is
the beginning of the diffusing of the perfume of God
and the foundation of the elevating of the Word of
God and the making known of the commandments of
God.  Is there a blessing greater than this?  These
spiritual gatherings (assemblies) are sustained (reinforced)
by the Spirit of God, and their protector is
Abdul-Baha, who spreads his wings (over) above
them.  Is there a blessing greater than this?  These


+P 91
spiritual gatherings (assemblies) are glowing lamps
and heavenly gardens which cast the light of knowledge
upon the contingent world and cause the spirit of
life to penetrate to every quarter.  This, then, is the
best means of the progress of the human race in all
conditions and circumstances.  Is there a greater blessing
than this?

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily, I read thy beautifully composed letter and
thank God for that He granted thee characteristics,
attributes and deeds which made thee dear and loved
by the maid-servants of God and chosen to be the
president of the "Assembly of Teaching."  Thank God
for that He confirmed thee by this wonderful bounty,
and, verily, I supplicate unto Him to strengthen thee
in rendering this great service in His great vineyard,
and to strengthen thy respected husband in patience
and forbearance in this test which will pass away, by
the help of God, and the veil be removed; difficulty will
be replaced by ease; hardships and trouble be changed
into comfort, in the shadow of His great Kingdom.

O thou dear maid-servant of God!
     Thank God that thou hast come near unto the Holy
Threshold and art dear in the Kingdom of His Glory.
Thou art president of an assembly which is a type of
the assemblages of the Supreme Concourse and a reflection
of the semblances of the Kingdom of God.
With heart and soul, with entire devotion, supplication,
humbleness and submissiveness, endeavor to promulgate
the law of God and strive to diffuse the fragrances


+P 92
of God.  Exert yourself to become the real
president of assemblies of spiritual ones and a companion
of the Kingdom of the Merciful.
     Thou hast asked in regard to the 10th verse of the
21st chapter of Revelation and to the 17th verse:
     Know that the firmament of the bright sun of the
world of possibilities is divided into twelve sections,
according to mathematical principles, which are called
the twelve constellations; likewise, the Sun of Truth
manifests and pours forth His bounty in twelve constellations
of holiness.  By these constellations are
meant holy souls who are the manifestations of purity
and the dawning-points of the lights of Unity.  Observe
that in the day of His Holiness the Speaker of
God (Moses), there were twelve holy souls who were
the leaders of the Truth.  In like manner, in the cycle
of His Holiness the Spirit (Jesus Christ), note that
there were twelve apostles under the shadow of the
light of the Most High, and the Sun of Truth was
manifested through those bright dawning-places like
unto the phenomenal sun.  Likewise, in the time of
His Holiness Mohammed, consider that there were
twelve dawning points of holiness who were the manifestations
of confirmation.  Such is the case.
     Accordingly, St. John, the divine, declared in his
vision regarding the twelve doors and the twelve foundations.
By the great and holy city of Jerusalem, which
is descended from heaven, is meant the sacred law of
God.  This subject has been repeatedly explained in
many Tablets and in the Scriptures of the ancient
prophets.  For example, it is said in one place:  "I beheld
Jerusalem marching on to the wilderness."  The purport


+P 93
is that this Heavenly Jerusalem has twelve doors
through which the advancing souls enter into the City
of God.  These doors are the souls who are the stars
of guidance and doors unto bounty and knowledge.
"At the gates twelve angels stood."  By "angel" is
meant the power of the confirmation of God; that the
candle of the power of the divine confirmation shines
forth and is illumined in those souls.  That is to say,
that each one of those souls will be confirmed by the
mightiest power.  Those twelve gates surround the
whole universe.  This signifies that all existence is under
the shadow of those souls; also, that these doors
are the foundation of the city of God, the divine Jerusalem;
that upon each of these foundations the name
of one of the Apostles of His Holiness the Spirit+F1 is
written.  That is to say, the manifestation of the perfections,
glad-tidings, virtues and high attributes of
that holy soul.
     In brief, it is said that:  "And he that talked with
me had a golden rod to measure the city and the gates
thereof and the walls thereof."  The purport is this,
that certain souls guided (people) with a rod of the
plant, that is, a reed wherewith he shepherded the
sheep, like unto the rod of Moses; other trained (the
people) with a rod of iron and drove them, as in the
time of Mohammed (The scepter of Mohammed was
the sword).  In this Greatest Day the rod of the plant
and the rod of iron are changed into a rod which is of
pure gold and is from the endless treasuries of the
Kingdom of God.
     By the instrumentality of this, all people shall be


------------------------
1.  Christ.
+P 94
trained.  Observe the difference:  In a certain time
the teachings of God were like unto the twigs of a
tree and by them the signs of God were spread, the
law of God promulgated and the religion of God
founded.  Later a time came when the rod of the divine
Shepherd was like iron, and now in this blessed
and glorious cycle that rod is become like unto pure
gold.  What a great difference exists between them!
Therefore know that the law of God and the divine
teachings prove a great advance in this day.  They
have reached a degree of supremacy, compared with
former ages.  Nay, rather, this is pure gold, while that
was iron and wood.
     This answer was written briefly because there was
no more time.  You will certainly excuse.  The maid-servants
of God must reach a station wherein they
themselves shall comprehend the realities and meanings,
to give clear explanations for each word and the
fountains of wisdom gush forth from the reality of
their hearts like a full flowing stream.

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily, I noted the contents of thy letter, which was
beautifully composed, was informed of thy sorrow, the
shedding of thy tears and the glowing of thy heart on
account of the imprisonment of Abdul-Baha.
     O maid-servant of God!  This prison is indeed
more precious and sweet than a garden to me, this fetter
is greater than any liberty and the confinement is
broader than the most spacious wilderness.  Therefore,
grieve not on this account.  Verily, if my Lord destine
unto me and causes me to taste the sweetness of the cup


+P 95
of the great martyrdom, my greatest desire will be fulfilled.
Fear not if this Branch be severed from the material
earth and cast aside the leaves -- nay, rather, its
leaves will flourish, for this Branch will grow after it
is cut from the earth (world), will ascend until it
shelters the universe, its foliage will reach the Supreme
Apex and bear fruits, imparting fragrant perfume unto
the world.  Therefore, turn unto thy Supreme Lord
and say:

     O my God!  O my God!  This Thy maid-servant
supplicates to Thee, trusts in Thee and directs herself
unto Thee, asking Thee to shed Thy divine mercies
upon her, to manifest Thy spiritual mysteries and to
show forth Thy majesty unto her.  O Lord!  O Lord!
Illumine the sight of my husband, cheer his breast by
the light of knowing Thee, attract his heart unto Thy
manifest Beauty and gladden his spirit by the manifestation
of Thy radiant light.  O Lord!  Withdraw the
veil from his sight, grant him Thy compassion, exhilarate
him with the wine of Thy love among the people,
make him an angel of Thine walking upon the earth,
let his spirit soar unto heaven and make him a lamp
glistening with the light of Thy knowledge in the community.
Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Precious,
the Bestower!

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Be rejoiced through the grace of thy Lord and happy
through the bounties of thy God, the Most Merciful
of the Merciful.  Thy Lord hath indeed chosen
thee for His love, guided thee unto the straight path,


+P 96
attracted thee by the magnet of His knowledge, from
among women, and crowned thee with the diadem of
guidance among the maid-servants.  Praise thy Lord
for this great favor, heavenly mercy and bounty which
hath no equal in the world of creation.  Gladden the
maid-servants of the Merciful through the grace of
thy Lord.   Thus their breasts may become dilated by
the holy fragrances emanating from the Kingdom of
El-ABHA.
     Soon the lights will glisten and the Sun of Truth
will shine with the burning ray in that country.  At that
time the maid-servants who are firm and constant will
rejoice; while every doubtful soul who wavers will regret.
Woe unto him, woe unto him, in that day wherein
the beloved will attain joy by the surrounding Kingdom
of thy Lord, the Precious, the Beneficent!  Verily,
the end is for them who are ushered into the tent of
the Covenant of thy merciful Lord.

O thou who art turning unto the Kingdom of God!
     Verily I am acquainted with the contents of the letter
which thou hast addressed to ............ the
servant of God, and I find its significance excellent,
proclaiming the Truth about which there can be no
doubt or uncertainty.
     Now the day has arrived in which the edifice of
God, the divine sanctuary, the spiritual temple, shall be
erected in America!  I entreat God to assist the confirmed
believers in accomplishing this great service and
with entire zeal to rear this mighty structure which
shall be renowned throughout the world.  The support


+P 97
of God will be with those believers in that district that
they may be successful in their undertaking, for the
Cause is great and great; because this is the first Mashrak-el-Azcar
in that country and from it the praise
of God shall ascend to the Kingdom of Mystery and
the tumult of His exaltation and greetings from the
whole world shall be heard!
     Whosoever arises for the service of this building
shall be assisted with a great power from His Supreme
Kingdom and upon him spiritual and heavenly blessings
shall descend, which shall fill his heart with wonderful
consolation and enlighten his eyes by beholding
the glorious and eternal God!
     Give my greetings and salutations to thy honorable
husband and say to him from me:  &amp;Notice the sign
which shall soon appear in those regions and then your
searching heart shall be assured.  Verily thy Lord is
the Powerful!&amp;

O thou who art assured by the grace of thy Lord!
     I have perused thy excellent letter which shows that
thou art turning thy face unto the living, eternal One
and grasping the hem of His Grandeur and thy attraction
unto the Call of thy Supreme Lord.  Well done!
Well done!  O maid-servant of God, for thou hast believed
in the Glorious Beauty (of El-ABHA) and art confirmed
in the manifestation of the Kingdom of God,
during this time.
     It behooveth thee to sever thyself from all desires
save thy Lord, the Supreme, expecting no help or aid
from anyone in the universe, not even from thy father


+P 98
or children.  Resign thyself to God!  Content thyself
with but little of this world's goods!  Verily, economy
is a great treasure.  If one of thy relations oppress
thee, complain not magnificent patience during every
calamity and hardship.  Verily thy Master is the Lord
of Faithfulness!  Forgive and overlook the shortcomings
which have appeared in that one, for the sake of love
and affection.  Know that nothing will benefit thee in
this life save supplication and invocation unto God,
service in His vineyard, and, with a heart full of love,
be in constant servitude unto Him.
     If thy daily living become difficult, soon (God)
thy Lord will bestow upon thee that which shall satisfy
thee.  Be patient in the time of affliction and trial,
endure every difficulty and hardship with dilated
heart, attracted spirit and eloquent tongue in remembrance
of the Merciful.  Verily this is the life of satisfaction,
the spiritual existence, heavenly repose, divine
benediction and the celestial table!  Soon thy Lord
will extenuate thy straightened circumstances even in
this world.

O thou dear servant of God!
     Thy letter was received and its contents noted.  As
to instructions which thou desirest, they are as follows:

     Believe in God; turn unto the Supreme Kingdom; be
attracted unto the Beauty of ABHA; remain firm in
the Covenant; yearn for ascending unto the heaven of
the sun of the universe; be disinterested in the world;
be alive with the fragrances of holiness in the Kingdom


+P 99
of the Highest; be a caller to love; kind to the human
race; gentle with humanity; interested in all the people
of the world; wish for harmony and seek friendship and
honesty.  Be a healing for every wound, a remedy for
every sick, a source of harmony among the people;
chant the verses of guidance; pray to God; arise for the
guidance of the people; let thy tongue explain and thy
face illumine with the glowing of the love of God.
Rest not a moment and breathe not a breath of repose
until thou becomest a sign of God's love and a banner
of God's favor.

O thou who art hoping for the Kingdom!
     Thank thou God that He hath guided thee, led thee
to the Kingdom of Being, ushered thee under the shade
of the bounties of the Lord of Hosts, and that thou
hast stepped into the Paradise of ABHA.
     Do not grieve on account of the death of thy son,
neither sigh nor lament.  That nightingale soared upward
to the divine rose-garden; that drop returned to
the most great ocean of Truth; that foreigner hastened
to his native abode; and that ill one found salvation
and life eternal.
     Why shouldst thou be sad and heartbroken?  This
separation is temporal; this remoteness and sorrow is
counted only by days.  Thou shalt find him in the
Kingdom of God and thou wilt attain to the everlasting
union.  Physical companionship is ephemeral, but
heavenly association is eternal.  Whenever thou rememberest
the eternal and never ending union, thou
wilt be comforted and blissful.


+P 100
O dear servant of God!
     Thy letter hath arrived and the contents have given
glad-tidings that the ground for the Temple hath been
bought and also told about the meeting which was held
concerning the needs for the Temple.  From this news
great fragrance and joy were produced.  Thanks be
to God that thou wast helped to establish a meeting for
this purpose.  I hope that the members of this meeting
will become the receivers of the divine benevolence
and be aided by the heavenly assistances.  But consult
with the House of Spirituality of Chicago.  Ye must
all be perfectly united and harmonious until, through
this harmony, ye may perpetually receive help from
the Kingdom of God.
     Concerning the members of this spiritual meeting,
you suggested that they be selected from all the spiritual
meetings of the other cities of America.  I quite
approve and am very much pleased with this plan.
This will become the cause of harmony in the Word
in all America.  Therefore, ask every spiritual meeting
in the other cities that they will each select one and
send him, and from these selected ones and with those
who are selected from the Chicago meetings, establish
a new meeting for the provision of the needs of the
Temple.  If this be established with perfect fragrance
and joy, it will produce great results.  In this new
meeting, especially for the establishment of the Temple,
ladies are also to be members.
     Give to all the divine friends the glad-tidings of the
boundless heavenly blessings and tell them that the
glances of the eyes of Providence are upon them and


+P 101
the perfect favor and bounty are descending upon
them.

O thou dear maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter, concerning the celebration of the anniversary
of the declaration of His Holiness the Supreme+F1
-- may my spirit be sacrificed for Him! -- which was held
on the land of the Mashrak-el-Azcar+F2 , was read.
     The utmost joy was attained, for -- praise be to
God! -- the friends of the Merciful passed some time
on that day joyous and singing in the land of the Mashrak-el-Azcar
and enjoyed commemorating the Lord of
the verses with the greatest joy.
     That melody was heard by the Supreme Concourse
and that rose-song of the nightingale of faithfulness
gladdened the people of the rose-garden of ABHA.
     I am hopeful that, during the coming Rizwan+F3 , a
great feast shall be held in the land of the Mashrak-el-Azcar,
a spiritual celebration prepared and the melodies
of the violin and the mandoline and hymns in
praise and glorification of the Lord of Hosts make all
the audience joyous and ecstatic.
     A few days ago an epistle was written -- therefore,
brevity is considered here.
     Treat thy dear daughter, for me, with the utmost
kindness and, likewise, the other friends and maid-servants
of the Merciful.

O attracted maid-servant of God!
     The epistle written (and sent) through Mirza......
was received.  The account of the land designated for the


------------------------
1.  The BAB.
2.  Site of Temple at Chicago, Ill.
3.  April 21, 1909.
+P 102
Mashrak-el-Azcar, of your placing therein, in company
with Mrs. ........, nine stones and pouring thereon
attar, water and olive oil, and of your commemorating
the Beauty of ABHA and His Holiness the Supreme+F1 ,
was all understood.
     That land is blessed because it is mentioned by the
name of Mashrak-el-Azcar.  Surely, the beloved of
God and the maid-servants of the Merciful in all the
cities of America must put forth the utmost of effort
in order that the Mashrak-el-Azcar be raised in that
land.
     I am hopeful through the aids and confirmations of
God that the beloved ones and maid-servants of the
Merciful may achieve this service.
     Express the utmost love and kindliness on behalf of
Abdul-Baha to all the beloved and the dear maid-servants
of the Merciful, especially Mrs. ..........
and thy dear daughter.

O thou who art advancing to the Kingdom of God!
     I have considered thy writing, which indicates
brightness of heart and the love of God.  Blessed art
thou for having been thus favored and for having attained
to guidance.
     You have asked me two questions:  "That if the
same spirit is manifest in all the Manifestations and
Prophets, then what is the distinction or difference
between Christ (or rather Jesus) and the other
Prophets; also [what is the difference] between Father
and Son?"
     Know that the human spirit is one, but it manifests


------------------------
1.  The BAB.
+P 103
itself in various members of the body in a certain
(measure or) form.  The human spirit is existent in the
sight (eyes); it is also existent in the brain, which is
the location of great functions and powers; it is also
existent in the heart, which organ is largely connected
with the brain or the center of the mind, and the heart,
or that center which is connection with the brain, has a
distinct and separate function, effect and appearance.
In this connection, the hair and nails have no command
(nor direct feeling).
     Figuratively speaking, the Father is the center of the
brain and the Son is the center of the heart; the rest
of the Prophets are members and parts.  Fatherhood
and Prophethood, in this case, are two expressions of
the same thing, as man and creature are two names of
the same reality.  The word "man," however, is greater
than the word "creature" because it bears a weightier
meaning than the name "creature"; both are the same.
     O maid-servant of God!  I pray God to confirm thee
forever anew.  Give greeting to thy dear mother.
Superstition hath somewhat overcome her.  When the
imagined Satan overpowers, let her say:  "O Baha-el-ABHA!"
She should then turn to the highest Kingdom.
Thus will the imagined Satan leave her.  [She] has a
form of obsession; therefore, you may not heed her
sayings.
     Cultivate the land and thus, through its fruits, you
will obtain benefits.  God will relieve you from care
(on account) of your mother.
     Give your good husband my spiritual greeting.  I
pray that he may be made a recipient of the divine
bounties and attain to the grace of God.


+P 104
O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of Holiness!
     Be dilated in thy heart by the gentle breeze which
emanates from the garden of Eternal Life and enkindled
in the Tree of Sinai in the center of Paradise; so that
thou mayest be a pillar of fire and a cloud of light in
this age, wherein a drop grows into a large wave of
the sea, and a lamp glistens with the light of the
dazzling stars, and this is from the power which is
manifested by thy Lord, the Clement, the Merciful.
***
     Be firm in the worship of God, fasting, praying, imploring
and invoking unto thy God, the Generous; so
that He shall destine to thee the honor of sacrifice in
the path of thy Beloved, the Ancient.
     I ask God to grant thee thy greatest wish in this
wonderful time.

O thou who art cheered through the Fragrances of
        God!
     When thou desirest and yearnest for meeting in
the world of vision; at the time when thou art in perfect
fragrance and spirituality, wash thy hands and face,
clothe thyself in clean robes, turn toward the court of
the Peerless One, offer prayer to Him and lay thy head
upon the pillow.  When sleep cometh, the doors of
revelation shall be opened and all thy desires shall become
revealed.
     Endeavor to guide thy mother and confirm her in
faith; when the heart becometh confident, the imagination
of Satan and evil vanisheth away.  If the heart
becometh absolutely tranquil, suspicion and imagination
will entirely pass away.


+P 105
O thou dear maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter was read and I am very happy that thou
art active and full of life through the spirit of Life and
that thou art firm and steadfast in this great Cause.
     To enter the Kingdom is easy, but to remain firm and
constant is difficult.  The planting of trees is easy, but
their cultivation and training to strengthen their roots
and to make them firm is difficult.  Now, as thou art a
firm tree, thou shalt certainly grow and send out
branches, leaves and blossoms and bear fruits.
     These branches, leaves, blossoms and fruits are the
souls who may be guided, through the providence of
God, by thee.  Therefore, thou art confirmed and
strengthened.
     Some of the friends intended to visit the Holy Land,
but hindrances prevented them and they have deferred
their coming.  You should also remain with your
mother and serve her until a suitable time arrives.
     Give my greetings and praise to my spiritual friend
[thy husband] and gladden him with the joyful tidings
of God; also, give the same to the friends of God and
His maid-servants.

O thou who has sought shelter in the Impregnable
        Cave!
     Verily, the glad-tidings of God have encompassed
Abdul-Baha from all directions.  While his heart is
beating with the love of God, he holds a cup full of
the knowledge of God in his right hand and wishes
to give the seekers to drink of this wine, so that they
may, perchance, be exhilarated with this cup, which is
overflowing with the signs of God.


+P 106
     Be thou rejoiced at these words, because thou wilt
partake of this wine which refreshes hearts and souls.

O thou who art confessing the Oneness of God!
     Verily, I read thy letter and I besought God to cause
thee to promulgate His divine Manifestation, to be rejoiced
at the bounty of His Kingdom, to adhere to His
Testament, to hold fast to the hem of the robe of His
grandeur, to exert thyself in His Cause, to desire the
unity of His dearly beloved ones, and the harmony
amongst His chosen ones and to endeavor to remove
the doubts which are being emanated from deceitful
souls.
     By the might of my Lord, verily, the Lord will assist
only those who will remain firm in His Cause, and
desire union, love, humility and submissiveness, and to
become separated from aught else save God.  Every
forehead which is illuminated with these lights will be
a lamp of guidance and a star whereby all horizons
will be lighted.
     Exert thyself with all thy heart and soul and with
all strength, so that thou mayest become a sign of firmness
and as a banner of the Word of God which may
wave on every lofty edifice through the favor of thy
Glorious Lord.
     As to thy question concerning the 12th chapter of
Ecclesiastes:  This is prophecy regarding the coming
of Jesus in that book, the signs and marks of which
were fulfilled with the appearance of the Promised
One of the Bible+F1 ; but since the Jews did not understand
the meaning thereof, so they denied Jesus and --


------------------------
1.  "Bible" signifies the Old Testament; "Gospel" signifies the New
    Testament.
+P 107
God forbid! -- said that He was the deformed (Antichrist).
Then it is said by Jesus in the Gospel, that
similar signs would appear in the "last day" -- or in
other words -- in the day when Christ will come the
second time in this world.
     The interpretation of these statements is mentioned
in the clearest manner and with the most wonderful
proofs in the Book of Ighan+F1 .  His honor, Ali-Kuli-Khan,
has already translated this Book which will soon
be published in America+F2 .  Then you will be informed
of the explanation and interpretation of these verses
and statements as elucidated by the Blessed Perfection.
Therefore my interpretation is not necessary.
     As to thy question concerning the 54th chapter of
Isaiah:  This chapter refers to the Exalted Leaf, the
mother of Abdul-Baha.  As a proof to this it is said:
"For more are the children of the desolate, than
the children of the married wife."  Reflect upon this
statement and then upon the following:  "And thy
seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate
cities to be inhabited."  And truly the humiliation
and reproach which she suffered in the path of God is
a fact which no one can refute.  For the calamities and
afflictions mentioned in the whole chapter are such afflictions
which she suffered in the path of God, all of
which she endured with patience and thanked God
therefor and praised Him, because He had enabled
her to endure afflictions for the sake of Baha'.  During


------------------------
1.  During the time of BAHA'O'LLAH'S residence in Baghdad (the Dwelling of
      Peace), men of learning, including Jews, Christians and Mohammedans,
      visited Him seeking answer to religious and scriptural questions.  Such
      answer He gave in the Book of Ighan, otherwise known as the Book
      of Explanations and Assurance.  It concerns the Reality and Authority
      of the human Divine "Manifestations."
2.  The book was published in 1904.
+P 108
all this time, the men and women (nakazeen) persecuted
her in an incomparable manner, while she was
patient, God-fearing, calm, humble and contented
through the favor of her Lord and by the bounty of
her Creator.
     As to thee -- O thou who art confessing the Oneness
of God! -- rise with all thy power to keep firm in the
Testament of God, and firmly believe that, verily, all
troops are defeated save those of the Testament and
all banners are reversed, save that of the Covenant of
God, which will wave over all horizons and will overshadow
the hosts of spirit, love and peace, while agitated
by the breeze of the favor of God.  Be thou
of the number of this great host and among the vanguard
of this great and powerful army.

O thou illumined youth!
     Thank thou God, for that the tongues spoke in thy
praise and the pends moved with thy love, thy knowledge
and thy enkindlement by the fire of the love of God.
One of them is the pen of Abdul-Baha.  Therefore, be
a sign of knowledge, standard of assurance and a light
of God, so that thou mayest become strengthened by
the breaths of the Holy Spirit in these days.

O thou revered sincere one!
     Know thou, verily, the brilliant realities and sanctified
spirits are likened to a shining crescent.  It has one face
turned toward the Sun of Truth, and another face opposite
to the contingent world.  The journey of this
crescent in the heaven of the universe ends in (becoming)
a full moon.  That is, that face of it which is


+P 109
turned toward the divine world becomes also opposite
to the contingent world, and by this, both its merciful
and spiritual, as well as contingent, perfections become
complete.

O thou servant of God!
     Thy letter was received.  Thou hast spoken concerning
thy lack of ability and capacity.  Wert thou without
ability and capacity, thou wouldst not have advanced
toward the Kingdom of ABHA.
     Consider how there are thousands of heedless souls
who are asleep, while there is one who is conscious and
awake!  Even as His Holiness Christ has said, the
friends of God are the salt of the earth, and the salt is
but a little part of the whole.  Undoubtedly the friends
of God have been endowed with ability and capacity,
on which account this became of the "chosen" and not
of the "called."
     O thou spiritual friend!  This world is a prison for
heavenly souls, and this earthly world is but a cage, and
not a nest, unto the divine birds.  A prisoner who is
awake and conscious will certainly seek for freedom, and
a mindful bird will certainly wish for deliverance from
the cage.  When the heart becometh free from attachment
unto this world, it will crave for the world of the
Kingdom and seek for eternal life.

O thou who are enkindled by the fire of the Love of
        God!
     Verily, I received thy good and beautiful letter and
I found it to be a sign of thy love and an evidence of
thy being attracted to the Beauty of El-ABHA.  I ask


+P 110
God to make thee a caller to the Kingdom of El-ABHA,
in those regions; to give thee a draught of the wine of
grace, to attract thee to the center of guidance, to cause
thee to ascend unto the Supreme World and to confirm
thee by the fragrances of the Holy Spirit, until thou
mayest guide the people unto the kingdom of immortality,
revive the hearts by the fragrances of God
and plant the seed of guidance in the field of the souls,
by a help from thy Lord, the Merciful, the Clement.
     As to the wonderful melody whereby thy spirit was
revived, verily it is a melody of the melodies of the
divine music, which will cause the spirits to ascend unto
the Supreme Horizon and will (cause) the mysteries
to be unfolded.
     O maid-servant of God!  Be one of the angels of
peace and a saint in the world.  Verily thy Lord will
cause thee to listen to that wonderful melody, through
the spiritual instrument.
     Regarding thy visit to this region+F1 , it is not permissible
at this time.  But when the time comes, permission
will be granted thee to present thyself at this
Source of Light and Dawning-Point of the love of thy
Lord, the Forgiver.

O thou who art made happy by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily, I have not forgotten thee and will never forget
thee.  I supplicate my Lord and thy Lord to make
thee a sign of His love among the maid-servants of the
Merciful and an overflowing chalice with the wine of
His knowledge among the women, so that thou be filled
with the love of thy Lord and be severed from aught

else save Him.  Verily thy Lord is the Generous and
the Giver.  He will give thee what will dilate thy
breast, enlighten thine eyes and attract thee in all conditions
and circumstances.

     +F1 Convey my love to the maid-servant of God, Mrs. ........,
and say:  &amp;Serve God all you can, for this
service is eternal and lasting.&amp;

O maid-servant of God!
     Thank God for choosing thee, saving thee and granting
thee of these great blessings and glorious attainments.
Verily, thy Lord shall confirm thee in that
which shall surprise the minds, through the glowing of
its love and the manifestations of the signs of its favors.
It is incumbent upon thee to be pure and holy.  It is
incumbent upon thee to be severed from all else save
thy Lord.  Confine thy attention and thoughts to the
Cause of thy great Lord and to diffusing His fragrances
in that country.
     O maid-servant of God!  Commune with thy Lord,
saying:

     O my God! my God!  Thanks be to Thee for guiding
me unto Thy Kingdom, for opening before my face
the door of Thy guidance, enlightening my eyes with
beholding Thy signs, and filling my heart with the feelings
of Thy love.
     O Lord!  O Lord!  Make me severed from the
world and void of its conditions, attracted by the fragrances
of Thy holiness among Thy maid-servants,

free in heart, happy in soul, cheerful in mind, longing
for the Kingdom of Thy Beauty, and glowing with the
fire of Thy love in the world.  Thus may I enkindle
the light of guidance in the hearts of Thy servants.
     Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Bestower, the
Precious, the Mighty!

O thou who art attracted by the Breath of God!
     With all joy I read thy brilliant letter and was informed
of its expression and meanings, which showed
thine abundant love in God, thy humility before the
beloved of God, thine attraction to the fragrances of
God and thy firmness in the Testament of God.
     I beg of God to make thee promote perfect harmony
among the believers of God and pure affection amid
the chosen ones of God and make thee [to] cause greatest
tranquillity to all the creatures and [to] show
kindness towards all the people on the earth, because
the bounty of the Merciful God is but pure love, great
prosperity and universal peace among the different people
in all regions and laying the foundation of great happiness
and felicity for all the creatures.
     Consequently, O thou who art attracted by the fragrances
of God, exert thyself and fail not to infuse
affection throughout all hearts and souls; [fail not] to
gather all the souls together in the assemblage of union
and cheerfulness, so that the beloved of God may become
as a levied army of the Supreme Concourse and
as a host of salvation descending from the Kingdom
of ABHA and conquer the countries of hearts and the
cities of souls with their tongues, similar to sharp
swords whereby fortresses and castles are conquered.


+P 113
     By the Life of God!  Verily I love thee with all my
heart and pray for thee every eve and morn that the
forgiving Lord may enable thee to serve in His excellent
vineyard and make thee a sign of His signs, to
cause thee to deliver His Cause, diffuse His breath
(and I beg of Him) to strengthen thine honorable
wife to that which behooveth these days.  Verily He is
the Giver of Confirmation in all circumstances!

O thou who art assuredly believing in God!
     Verily, I read thy brilliant letter and thanked God
for that He hath created a maid-servant for Baha', who
prays for Abdul-Baha and beg the confirmation and
assistance of God in his behalf, because I am earnestly
fond of the prayer of the maid-servants of God in my
behalf and of their asking the blessing of God for this
servant!
     I begged of God to ordain all good unto thee for thy
praying for Abdul-Baha.

O thou who art turning unto the Kingdom of God, and
        looking unto the Day-spring of the lights of God!
     I, with the utmost joy and cheerfulness, have
perused the contents of thy letter, which shows thy
faith in God, thy assurance in the Kingdom of God,
the gladness of thy breast in hearing the voice of God
and the adherence of thy heart to the word of God.


+P 114
     O servant of God! rejoice through the glad-tidings
of God, be happy by the wafting of the fragrance of
God, and cling to the Kingdom of God in such wise
that it makes thee separate thyself from the world and
kindle in thy heart the fire of the love of God to such
an extent that any one who approaches thee will feel
its warmth; and if thou desirest to attain to this station,
thou shouldst turn thyself wholly unto God.  Perhaps
an illumination will descend upon thee by which
the fragrances of God will be diffused throughout those
regions and districts and thou wilt be a lamp of guidance
from which the lights of knowledge will emanate
and spread in those far countries and distant lands.

O thou who art imploring God!
     I was indeed acquainted with the great misfortunes
and afflictions which have befallen thee, but I hope that
through the bounty of thy Lord, He may ordain unto
thee heavenly fragrance and spirituality, attractive and
internal perceptions and incorporeal susceptibilities;
that He may grant thee strength after weakness, give
thee rest after trouble, bring thee nigh to Him, and
make thee a sign of His love among all His maid-servants,
and forgive thy father, mother, brother and
grandfather their sins.
     Verily, He is the Pardoner, the Forgiver.

O visitant of the Resort+F1 of spirits (who are) sincere in
        the Religion of God!
     Blessed is the mother who bore thee and the breast
whose milk suckled thee and the bosom wherein thou


------------------------
1.  Acca, Syria -- the Holy Land.
+P 115
wert nurtured, because thou hast apprehended the Day
of the Lord, hast prepared thyself to enter in unto His
kingdom, hast set thy face singly toward His Gracious
Countenance, hast believed in the Manifest Light, hast
rejoiced in the Abundant Grace, hast responded to the
Voice of thy Lord with a sincere and beating heart and
hast presented thyself from those regions at the Glorious
Threshold and hast marked thy forehead with the
pure, holy, fragrant Tomb+F1 , the breaths of whose
sanctity are spread abroad throughout the lands as
fragrant musk is diffused unto the distant place!  Then
thank thy Lord, the Merciful, the Clement, for this
great salvation (or fruition, achievement, or attainment)
and exceeding grace!
     Now as to what thou askest concerning the spirit
and its "return" to this world of humanity and this
elemental space:  Know that spirit in general is divided
into five sorts -- the vegetable spirit, the animal spirit,
the human spirit, the spirit of faith, and the divine
spirit of sanctity.
     The vegetable spirit is the virtue augmentative, or
growing or vegetative faculty, which results from the
admixture of the simple elements, with the co-operation
of water, air and heat.
     The animal spirit is the virtue perceptive resulting
from the admixture and absorption of the vital elements
generated in the heart, which apprehend sense
impressions.
     The human spirit consists of the rational, or logical,
reasoning faculty, which apprehends general ideas
and things intelligible and perceptible.

------------------------
1.  The Tomb of BAHA'O'LLAH.
+P 116
     Now these "spirits" are not reckoned as Spirit in
the terminology of the Scriptures and the usage of the
people of the Truth, inasmuch as the laws governing
them are as the laws which govern all phenomenal
being (i. e., all existences belonging to the phenomenal
or material universe, called "the world of generation and
corruption"), in respect to generation, corruption, production,
change and reversion, as is clearly indicated in
the Gospel where it says:  "Let the dead bury their
dead;" "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and
that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit"; inasmuch as
he who would bury these dead was alive with the vegetative,
animal and rational human soul, yet did Christ --
to whom be glory! -- declare such dead and devoid of
life, in that this person was devoid of the Spirit of Faith,
which is of the Kingdom of God.
     In brief, for these three spirits there is no restitution
or "return," but they are subordinate to reversions and
production and corruption.
     But the Spirit of Faith which is of the Kingdom (of
God) consists of the all-comprehending Grace and the
perfect attainment (or salvation, fruition, achievement)
and the power of sanctity and the divine effulgence
from the Sun of Truth on luminous light-seeking
essences from the presence of the divine Unity.
And by this Spirit is the life of the spirit of man, when
it is fortified thereby, as Christ saith:  "That which is
born of the Spirit is Spirit."  And this Spirit hath both
restitution and return, inasmuch as it consists of the
Light of God and the unconditioned Grace.  So, having
regard to this state and station.  Christ announced that
John the Baptist was Elias, who was to come before


+P 117
Christ (Matt. 11:14).  And the likeness of this station
is as that of lamps kindled (from one another):
for these in respect to their glasses and oil-holders, are
different, but in respect to their light, One, and in respect
to their illumination, One; nay, each one is identical
with the other, without imputation of plurality, or diversity
or multiplicity or separateness.  This is the Truth
and beyond the Truth there is only error.
     But as to the question of the Trinity, know, O advancer
unto God, that in each one of the cycles wherein
the Lights have shone forth upon the horizons (i. e.,
in each prophetic dispensation) and the Forgiving
Lord hath revealed Himself on Mount Paran (see
Habbakkuk 3:3, etc.) or Mount Sinai, or Mount Seir
(see Ezekiel 35), there are necessarily three things:
The Giver of the Grace, and the Grace, and the Recipient
of the Grace; the Source of the Effulgence, and
the Effulgence, and the Recipient of the Effulgence;
the Illuminator, and the Illumination, and the Illuminated.
Look at the Mosaic cycle:  The Lord, and
Moses, and the Fire (i. e., the burning bush), the
Intermediary; and in the Mohammedan cycle:  The Lord,
the Apostle (or Messenger, Mohammed), and
Gabriel (for, as the Mohammedans believe, Gabriel
brought the Revelation from God to Mohammed).
Look at the sun and its rays and the heat which results
from its rays; the rays and the heart are but two effects
of the sun, but inseparable from it; yet the sun is one
in its essence, unique in its real identity, single in its
attributes, neither is it possible that anything should


+P 118
resemble it.  Such is the essence of the Truth concerning
the Unity, the real doctrine of the Singularity, the
undiluted reality as to the (Divine) Sanctity.
     But as to the question concerning the atonement on
the part of the Holy Redeemer, I have explained this
to thee by word of mouth in a plain and detailed manner,
devoid of ambiguities, and I have made it clear to
thee as the sun at noonday.
     And I ask God to open unto thee the gates, that
thou mayest thyself apprehend the true meanings of
these mysteries.  Verily, He is the Confirmer, the
Beneficent, the Merciful!

O thou who art firm in the Covenant!

I have the utmost love for thee and thy family
for thou servest me -- how can I be offended at you?
Be assured and happy.  Convey my greetings to thy
sons and also to the maid-servant of God, thy wife.

O thou slave of the Beauty of ABHA!
     Thy letter was received.  Praise be to God!  It
indicated thy firmness and steadfastness in the love of
God -- therefore, it was the cause of happiness.
     Thou hast written regarding the meeting of his
honor Mr. ........, his respected wife and daughter.
Truly, I say, Mr. ........ is a blessed soul and
is engaged in the service of the Cause and his extreme
hope is to bring about affinity between the souls and
cause the believers to be united and agree.  This is
also my highest hope.  I hope, God willing, this unity
and agreement will be established and this imprisoned
one, immersed in the sea of trials, become exhilarated
and rejoiced.  The aim of the appearance of the Blessed
Perfection -- may my life be a sacrifice for His beloved
ones! -- was the unity and agreement of all the people
of the world.  Therefore, my utmost desire, firstly, is
the accord and union and love of the believers and
after that of all the people of the world.  Now, if
unity and agreement is not established among the believers,


+P 120
I will become heartbroken and the afflictions
will leave a greater imprint upon me.  But if the fragrance
of love and unity among the believers is wafted
to my nostrils, every trial will become a mercy, every
unhappiness a joy, every difficulty an expansion, every
misery a treasure and every hardship a felicity.
     Convey on my behalf the utmost love and kindness
to the favored maid-servant of God [thy wife], and
thy worthy and noble sons.

O thou who art awakened from the sleep of negligence
        and forgetfulness!
     Thank God for that He hath awakened thee from
thy sleep, found thee after thy being lost and quickened
thee after thy death.  Verily, I beg God to confirm
thee by a power by which thou mayest be enabled
to worship God and to serve His Cause and to be
submissive and lowly before the beloved of God.
     Verily, I remember thee in my prayers an din my
invocation, beseeching the Heavenly Father, the Lord
of Hosts, to confirm thee by a power and cause thee
to be firm and to work and serve in the olive garden
of God and to be lowly and submissive before His
Holy and Exalted Threshold.

O thou fortunate and righteous, sincere and pious!
     Thank thou God for that by reason of which the
breath of God hath awakened thee and the spirit of
God hath quickened thee and raised thee from among
the dead with a joyful spirit of life.
     In my prayers I supplicate God to bestow upon thee
in all cases and aspects an influential and penetrating


+P 121
power that thou mayest be a firm, faithful and successful
servant in the garden of El-ABHA, and a skillful
laborer in the vineyard of God.

O thou who art advancing toward the Kingdom of
        God!
     Verily, I supplicate God to illuminate thy heart
through the light which is shining from the Supreme
Concourse that His mightiest power may strengthen
thee to be firm, steadfast, submissive and lowly before
the Kingdom of God, and to be an example of good
deeds among the maid-servants of the Merciful.  And
I beseech Him to make thy breast a clear mirror to
reflect the light of the spirit of God.

O thou at whose mention I am rejoiced!
     By God, the True One, verily pure hearts are as
clear and brilliant mirrors which imprint the one on
the other, and hearts discover the secrets of hearts.
Therefore, they (hearts) chant the verses of longing
and recite the odes of glorification and praise.  Consequently,
the recourse is to pages of hearts, not pages
filled with written lines.
     Give my greetings to thy revered wife and announce
to her the glad-tidings of a gift from God; and I beg of
God to make her a spark from out the fire of His love.
Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty!

O thou who art assured in God!
     Verily we read thy letter and asked for thee confirmation.
Verily thy Lord will strengthen thee in


+P 122
great spirituality and cause thy heart to overflow with
the gifts of God.
     All the servants of the Merciful here convey to thee
greetings and praise. ***

O thou who art advanced towards God!
     Verily I implore God to cause thee to be a sign of
the book of Genesis, declaring His mentionings and
His praise among the creatures, with brilliant face,
smiling mouth, dilated breast and rejoiced heart, for
the manifestation of His evident glory and the appearance
of His illumining Beauty from that wonderful
horizon.
     Surely a day will come when all thy desires will be
attained and God will answer all that which thou hast
prayed for in thine heart, and I beg of Him to make
all that which thou hast longed for long ago very attainable.
Then thine heart will be overflowed with joy
on account of such a great bounty.

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily I read thy new letter and was informed of its
meanings, which proved thy lowiness to thy Glorious
Lord.
     Verily we promised thee, by the favor of thy Lord,
last year, that thy Lord would grant thee "sight of
eyes" (i. e., a son), a blessed birth.  Thanks and praise
be unto God for that He granted thee a good
descendant and dilated thy breast by this great bounty.
It is incumbent on thee to offer many thanks to the
Merciful Lord for this great favor in the world of
humanity.  Verily I implore unto God to make him a


+P 123
sign of His Kingdom, illuminated, spiritual and god-like
among the children.

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Thank God for giving and granting thee "sight of
eyes" (i. e., a son) whereby thy bosom becomes dilated
and thy heart rejoiced.
     Then make his name "Ruhullah" (i. e., the Spirit of
God), so that the Spirit of thy Lord, the Merciful of
the Merciful, will confirm him.
     O maid-servant of God!  Know, verily, that the one
who bore similar name (i. e., Ruhullah), son of Varga,
was martyred in the path of God in the twelfth year
of his life.  While he was beneath the unsheathed sword
he called out "Ya Baha-el-ABHA!" until he was killed
in the path of God.
     We called thy son by this noble name so that he may
have a great station in the Kingdom of God.

O thou sincere servant of the True One!
     Thy letter caused joy to the hearts.  Its meanings
perfumed the nostrils like unto a tender flower and a
red rose.  The heat of thy longing was felt and thy
wish to present thyself to the blessed Threshold was
recognized.  Happy art thou who hast entered this
Supreme Paradise under the shadow of the Tree of
Life and hast partaken of the Heavenly Table.  This
Servant hath also the utmost longing to see thee and
hopeth that some day this wish may be attained.  But
in these days, owing to the sedition of these faithless
ones (i. e., violators), coming to this blessed region is
(subject to) great caution.  Therefore, leave it to some


+P 124
other time and be engaged in diffusing the lights of the
Sun of Truth.
     Turn thou unto the Kingdom of Oneness and chant
thou the verses of Singleness.  Be thou invested with a
robe, the embroidery of which is purity and sanctity and
the woof and warp of which is the spirituality of the
Mighty Lord, so that thou mayest inhale the fragrance
of the divine rose-garden from the garment of the real
Joseph and so divest thyself of the mantle of bodily
things that angelhood and ideal spirituality become
realized (in thee).

O thou who art firm in the Covenant!
     I have seen the letter which thou hast written to
Mr. .........  The opinion (expresssed therein) was
very agreeable.  The Spiritual Meeting of Consultation
of New York must be in the utmost union and
harmony with the Spiritual Meeting of Consultation
of Chicago, and that which they deem advisable to
publish, these two Meetings of Consultation must
unitedly approve of it and deem its publication advisable.
Then the Meeting of Consultation must send
one copy thereof to Acca, in order that it may be also
approved of here and then returned, and that the it
may be printed and published.
     That the two Spiritual Meetings of Chicago and
New York must be in unity and harmony is very important,
and when a Spiritual Meeting may be also
organized in Washington in a befitting manner, these
two meeting (of Chicago and New York) must be
also in unity and harmony with that meeting.
     To be brief, it hath been decided by the Desire of


+P 125
God that union and harmony may day by day increase
among the friends of God and maid-servants of
the Merciful One, in the West.  Not until this is
realized will the affairs advance by any means whatever!
And the greatest means for the union and harmony
of all is Spiritual Meetings.  This matter is very
important and is as a magnet (to attract or) for divine
confirmation.  If the beauty of this Divine Beloved
One -- that is, unity of believers -- does appear in the
ornament of the Kingdom of ABHA, it is certain that
those countries will, in a short time, become the Paradise
of ABHA and the light of Unity (or Oneness) and
Singleness will shine upon the whole world from the
West.  We+F1 are endeavoring with all heart an soul,
have no rest night and day, nor a moment of tranquillity,
so that we may make the world of humanity
the mirror of the divine unity; how much more the
beloved of God!  And this wish and hope shall appear
and shine forth at that time when the true friends of
God may arise and act in accord with the teachings of
the Beauty of ABHA -- may my life be a sacrifice to His
beloved ones!  One of the teachings is that love and
faithfulness must so prevail in the hearts that men may
see the stranger as a friend, the sinner as an intimate
fellow, may count enemies as allies, regard foes as
loving comrades, call their executioner the giver of
life, consider the denier as a believer and the unbeliever
as a faithful one -- that is, men must behave in such
a manner as may befit the believers, the faithful, the
friend and the confidant.  If this lamp may shine in
a befitting manner in the assemblage of the world you


------------------------
1.  Abdul-Baha himself.
+P 126
will find that the regions will become fragrant and the
world become a delectable paradise, the surface of the
earth will become an excellent garden, the world will
become as one home, the different nations will become
as one kind, and the peoples and nationalities of the
East and West will become as one household.  I hope
such a day may come and such lights may dawn and
such a Countenance may appear in the utmost beauty.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     Though thy letter was brief in words, it was ample
in significance.  It indicated that thy heart is illumined,
thine inner sight is open and thine ear of understanding
is familiar with the mystery.  This is a gift from God,
the Independent.
     Thine expression of kindness to Miss ........ is
very acceptable.  Be thou kind to all on the earth, a
care-taker (or helper) to every sick person, an open
treasure to every indigent one; offer thou salutary water
to the athirst; bestow the bread (or food) of life upon
the hungered; console thou the helpless, exhort the ignorant
and seek forgiveness for the sinner.
     If, hereafter, thou mayest write a letter to Miss
........, deliver unto her this my message:
     &amp;O Miss ........!  The Tree of Life is full of
blossoms, leave and fruits! -- the shade thereof is a
peace to soul and a rest to the consciousness.  Whosoever
is under this Tree will certainly partake of fruit.
But shade trees are many in the forest, which, though
fresh and verdant, are, nevertheless, fruitless.  This
truth shall finally become clear and manifest unto thee.&amp;
     Kiss thou the face and hair of Ruhullah on my behalf.


+P 127
O God who art without likeness!
     The servant of Thy Kingdom, Mr. ........,
reached the Holy Threshold in the utmost of sincerity
and longing and sought Thy good will.  It is some
time that he hath been engaged in the land of America
with Thy commemoration and known by Thy commendation.
To the beloved he is a cause of joy and
to the friends a means of unity and gladness.
     O world Creator!  For his life -- well done! -- for
he is alive with Thy name and thoughtful of Thee
night and day.  Confer upon him Thy grace that he
may daily receive a new life, attain a fresh bounty,
offer a new service to Thy Threshold and serve Thy
Throne.
     Thou art the Giver, the Forgiver and Thou art the
Pardoner, the Educator.

O thou servant of Baha'!
     Thy visit is accepted and thy name ever mentioned
in the presence of Abdul-Baha.  I forget thee not for
a moment but remember thee always.  I seek confirmation
and strength from God for thee.  Rest thou assured
and be happy in the love of Abdul-Baha.  Know
for a certainty that divine confirmation will arrive and
great attainment be made.

O servant of Baha'!
     Thy letter written to his honor, Mirza ........,
with the enclosed map of the ground of the Mashrak-el-Azcar,
hath been seen.
     The place is suitable, but if it were possible to have


+P 128
a wider piece of ground, so that the building should
stand in the middle, surrounded by a flower garden, it
would be better and more pleasing; otherwise, if this is
not possible, the building on the present ground is also
permissible.
     The flowers which Ruhullah picked on the ground
of the Mashrak-el-Azcar and thou didst send to me
brought with them and exhaled a very sweet fragrance.
This fragrance is just as thou didst write, "the fragrance
of the rose-garden of the unity of the East and
West."  I hope that daily these fragrances may become
more powerful and more diffused throughout the world.
     Thou must hasten to send his honor .... ......
all the writings for which he asked, to Rangoon, India.
     An utmost happiness was produced by the news of
the good health and safety of the friends of God.
     My spiritual beloved, his honor, Mr. ........, is
rendering a great service to the Kingdom of ABHA and
becoming a means of strong attraction towards, and
connection with the world above by making this long
tour+F1 and giving the news of the Holy Spot and diffusing
the fragrances of the love of God.
     As to the calamities and afflictions of Abdul-Baha:
These are not calamities, but bounties; they are not afflictions,
but gifts; not hardships, but tranquillity; not
trouble, but mercy -- and we thank God for this great
favor.

O thou who art advancing unto God!
     Praise God that He guided thee to the Path of His
Kingdom, blessed thee with the word of holiness, and


------------------------
1.  Through the western states.
+P 129
illumined thy heart with a light shining in the lofty
Kingdom.
     O maid-servant of God!  Every star hath a setting,
but the star of the knowledge of God in the divine
heaven; every light shall darken save the light of the
guidance of God; every dignity shall vanish away save
the glory under the shadow of the Word of God.
     Verily, I pray God to make thee firm in this Path;
to cause thee to enter the Ark of Safety; and to
strengthen thee in becoming humble and meek to the
maid-servants of the Merciful, and in overcoming self
and passion through the power of God.

O my dear, intimate friend!
     Verily, I address thee with such an appellation
whereby the hearts of those who are endowed with intelligence,
are dilated with joy; because, verily, this is
from my heart which is overflowing with the love of
God -- and an appellation that proceeds from love will
certainly be as a spirit for the souls, as a light to the
eyes, as a life to bodies and as a dressing for the hearts
and bodies which are wounded and lacerated by the
afflictions of this world.  Then be consoled by the
praise of thy Lord, whenever thou art attacked by
grief and sorrow.

O thou candle of the Love of God!
     I ask God to grant thee by His favor and grace
that which is thy utmost desire; that the closed doors
become opened, the uneven roads become even, thy
face shine by the love of God, thy sight become brighter


+P 130
by witnessing the signs of God; that thou mayest attain
spiritual joy, eternal happiness and heavenly life.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     Thank God that thou dost believe in the Greatest
Manifestation, art confident in the Word of God and
dost hold to the divine teachings.  I hope that thou
mayest be confirmed to give the Message to thy friends
and relatives and guide them also.  Be patient and forbearing
and treat them with great love and kindness.
Surely the attributes of the people of God will have
their effect eventually upon the people.

O thou beloved of my heart!
     Verily, my soul longs for thee, for the lamp of the
love of Baha' is lighted within thy heart and I love
to look upon thy face, for it is glittering with the light
of guidance among the creatures.  Glory be to Him
who hath united hearts together!  Glory be to Him
who hath brought the East and West under the shadow
of the Blessed Tree, the root of which is firmly fixed
in the earth and the branches of which reach unto the
Supreme Concourse!

O thou who art partaking of the Heavenly Food!
     Know thou verily the Divine Food is descending
from heaven, but only those taste thereof who are
directed to the light of guidance, and only those can
enjoy it who are endowed with a sound taste.  Otherwise
every diseased soul disliketh the delicious and merciful
food and this is because of the sickness which


+P 131
hath seized him, whereby the El-Zekkum+F1 is sweet (to
his taste) while he fleeth from the ripe fruit of the Tree
of the Living and Pre-existent God -- and there is no
wonder in that.
     In a similar way, thou beholdest some women who
have abandoned the Testament, and to them the bitterness
of discord is sweet.  They keep aloof from the
Extended Shadow and dwell under the shade of a
"black smoke."  Alas for them and grief for them!
They will surely lament and find themselves in loss.
Verily, this is but an evident truth!

O thou tree, developed in the garden of the Love of
        God!
     Be well watered with the abundant rain falling from
the clouds of the Testament of God, that thou mayest
bring forth fresh and ripe fruits which are beneficial
to the hearts and souls.

O thou spiritual man and merciful being!
     I have read thy brilliant letter which showeth the
utterance of thy praise upon the Beauty of El-ABHA,
the Most Glorious.  Blessed thou art!  Glad-tidings
unto thee for that by reason of which thou hast drunk
from the cup which is overflowing with the wine of
the love of God, and hast become intoxicated from that
pure wine which was given to thee from the hand of
Providence in the meeting of the knowledge of God.
     Take the cup of sanctity in thy right hand and pass
the glass of the Kingdom, in the social meeting -- which


------------------------
1.  El-Zekkum -- a thorny tree so called, which bears fruit like an almond, but
      extremely bitter.  Therefore the tree symbolizes a very sever punishment
      and bitter remorse for the unbelievers.
+P 132
is the wine of the love of God and the sweet, pure, cool
water of the knowledge of God -- and give to drink to
those who are in attendance, that they may rejoice, be
happy and sing the hymns of sanctity and unification,
offering their praise to the Supreme Kingdom.

O thou who art attracted to the Holy Fragrances!
     The light of truth hath made thine eyes to see, the
voice of God hath made thine ears to hear and the
lights emanating from the beauty of the Light of the
World both made thine heart attracted and astonished.
I hope that thou wilt cut thyself from all that is in this
world; wilt sever thyself from all desires of this transitory
world; wilt attach thy heart entirely to the light
of truth and wilt, at all times, rise in the service of
truth in the rose-garden of God.
     The deriding of the enemy addeth to the joy of the
heart and taunting of the ignorant becometh the
means of spirituality and fragrance.
     Observe that the Pharisees called His Holiness, the
sweet and the divine Christ, Beelzebub or the head of
evil spirits.  This people (the people of the world)
are in the depths of ignorance and their reproach and
detraction are like praise and congratulation.
     I hope that, in the path of the love of God, thou
wilt exert thyself exceedingly and thus wilt enjoy life.
     The letter which thou hadst written to Mrs. ......
was perused by me.  Indeed, its contents were indicative
of divine knowledge and showed that thou art
really attracted to the Beauty of God.  Thou hast very
well explained the question of the progress of man in


+P 133
the higher stations and his reaching the life eternal.
This explanation is indeed from the confirmation of the
Holy Spirit.

O thou who art accepted of God!
     Know thou that, verily, the eye of favors is directed
to thee and is beholding thee with a divine glance, so
that thou mayest, with clear eyes, see the lights of the
Kingdom upon the horizon.  Remember, at all times,
this great favor and thank thy Lord and supplicate to
Him every day.

O thou servant of God!
     According to what I have heard, thou hast experienced
a great financial loss.  Do not feel sorry, for
thou wilt be compensated.  I hope that whatever thou
hast lost will come back to thee.  But this material
loss is not a very grave one; it is for a time and shall
pass away.  Alhamdallah!+F1 -- that thou hast a share in
the Kingdom of God and art receiving gifts from the
treasury of the Holy Spirit.  Do not feel sorry; do
not brood over the loss; do not sit down depressed;
do not be silent; but, on the contrary, day and night
be engaged in the commemoration of thy Lord in the
greatest joy and gladness.

O thou who art attracted to the Beauty of the Deity!
     Verily, I have read thy clear letter, and was heartily
cheered at its elegant style, because it indicated thy
sincerity in the Cause of God, thy hearty adherence


------------------------
1.  Praise be to God!
+P 134
to the Word of God, and thy service in the vineyard
of God.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Be tranquil and
know, verily, that indeed, the Holy Ghost in this glorious
age teacheth every soul that is sincerely faithful,
firm and drawn to the Kingdom of the Great Lord.
Verily, I address thee with a heart overflowing with
the love of God.
     I beg of God to ordain for thee all that which thou
desirest and grant thee the honors of meeting, and
that thou mayest be a true maid-servant, emptied of all
save Him, that thou mayest be apt in serving in His
vineyard and in guiding thy two children into His
Right Path.
     Indeed thou wilt see the teachings of God spread
in those regions by the breath of the Holy Spirit, and
thou wilt discover the fragrances of the paradise of
the Kingdom.
     Verily, these glad-tidings are very great for thee,
and also for the maid-servants of the Merciful One,
and for the men of God in that wide region (i. e.,
America).

O ye+F1 who are longing for the beauty of El-ABHA!
     Verily that Light (i. e., the Light of the Manifestation)
shone forth from the horizon of the Manifestation,
appeared upon the horizon of existence, and the
darkness was changed into light; the Sun of Guidance
dawned in the horizon of heaven, whereby the eyes
which were looking unto the Kingdom of God were
illuminated, the breasts which were filled with God's


------------------------
1.  Husband and wife.
+P 135
love were dilated, and the heavenly spirits were attracted
by the magnet of the Holy Spirit, so that the
hearts became as pure mirrors reflecting the godlike
appearances and manifesting the heavenly lights -- except
the eyes which were in the veil of imitation of the
forefathers (i. e., those who followed the theories of
their fathers) were hindered from or veiled from witnessing
that brilliant and godlike illumination, and the
people held to the superstitions of the Pharisees and
neglected the mystery of God and the glad-tidings (recorded)
in the Holy Scriptures, which elucidated the
appearance of the Lord of Hosts in the promised day.
     As to you -- O ye who are attracted to the fragrances
of God! -- kneel down and thank God for choosing
you to enter His wonderful Kingdom.
     How many of the Pharisees were waiting for the
appearance of the Spirit (i. e., Jesus) then were veiled
from it.  But ye have taken away the veil and were
guided unto the light, have given up imitating forefathers
and directed your eyes to the Sun of Truth,
which is shining in the Supreme Horizon.  This is a
favor to you on the part of your Lord, and a gift for
you.

O maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter was understood.  Thou hast asked, very
humbly, for certain things and all were worthy to be
coveted.  Thou desirest forgiveness of sins; didst ask
for great unity and peace; sought nearness to the
Threshold of God; hoped to be detached from thine
own will, seeking the will of God; prayed for rescue
from self-love (or selfishness); hoped for progress in


+P 136
the station of knowledge; desired to serve God; and
prayed that thy honorable husband and thy children
may be set aglow with the fire of the love of God and
may manifest light on their brows through the radiance
of the knowledge of God.  All these wishes are well
worthy of asking.  Especially the rescue from self-love.
This is a strange trait and means of the destruction
of many important souls in the world.  If man be imbued
with all good qualities but be selfish, all the other
virtues will fade or pass away and eventually he will
grow worse.
     I hope the beloved of God and the maid-servants
of the Merciful will be entirely freed from selfishness.
Should this become their nature, they will indeed become
manifestations of great bounties, and the doors
of the divine grace will open.
     Be thou grateful to Mrs. ........ for having led
thee to the Straight Path and guiding thee to the
Kingdom of God.  If thou shouldst thank her a thousand
times an hour, thou wilt fail to thank her sufficiently
for the attainment.

***O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!
     Know thou that the heart of Abdul-Baha is overflowing
with great love for thee, and verily he is night
and day invoking and beseeching the Kingdom of God
that He may make thee a sign of His mercy among
His creatures, a cause of love and harmony and a
means of hinging [or a pivot for] every good among
the people of all regions, and to make thee announce to
the people the opening of the door of the Kingdom.


+P 137
"Verily God will appropriate His mercy unto whom He
pleaseth."
     O thou servant of God!  Turn thy face thoroughly
unto God, so that He may make thee to show forth
the Greatest Gift and make thee to be a source of those
signs which may prove thy proper relationship unto
God and the joy of thy heart, through the fragrances
of the Holy Spirit, in every moment and instant.
     Be thou sure that, verily, thy deceased child is now
one of those babes who are suckled in the Kingdom
of Life, under the charge of the Beauty of El-ABHA.
"Verily, God confirmeth whom He wisheth!"

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily I read thy excellent letter which contained
thy praises of the Supreme Lord.  Verily I supplicate
God to confirm thee in that which He desireth, to
protect thee from conceit and self-exaltation and from
selfish concerns, to make thee devoted unto Him and
resigned unto Him and to be the means of promoting
the divine love amongst the dearly beloved of God.
And I beseech Him to preserve thee from the confirmed
tests and great trials which break backs and
perish souls and to make thee a sign of submissiveness
and a standard of meekness, lowliness and humility
before the Kingdom of the Mighty and Omnipotent
God.

O thou who art advancing unto the Kingdom of God!
     Verily I noted thy writing and was made glad by
thy letter.  I pray God to cause thee to attain the

bounties of the Kingdom, so that thou mayest arise
for the service of the Cause of God and that of the
world of humanity -- and (may God's) blessing descend
upon thy honorable wife.  Verily my Lord is
kind unto His servants and is the Generous, the Giver
of Bounty!
     Know that the return of Christ for a second time
doth not mean what the people believe, but, rather,
signifieth the One promised to come after Him.  He
shall come with the Kingdom of God and His power
which hath surrounded the world.  This power (or
reign) is in the world of hearts and spirits and not in
that of matter (or bodies).  For the material world
is not comparable to a single wing of a fly, or rather
less in the sight of thy Lord, wert thou of those who
know!  Verily Christ came with His Kingdom from
the beginning which hath no beginning and will come
with His Kingdom to the eternity of eternities, inasmuch
as in this sense Christ is an expression of the
divine reality, the simple essence and heavenly entity
which hath no beginning or ending.  It hath appearance,
arising and manifestation and setting in each of the
cycles.

O thou who art marching unto God!
     Thy letter was read.  Its contents indicated thy
devotion to the Horizon of the Living God and thy
love for the Promised Perfection.  Firmness is, however,
a requisite.  Thou must remain solid and firm
as a great mountain.
     Regarding thy revered wife, thou hast written that
a warmer place is more suitable than the cold.  If this


+P 139
winter thou shouldst go to those regions, it is better.
I ask God that thou, thy wife and thy friends may
draw nigh unto the Spiritual Beauty.

Rejoice, O maid-servant of God!

     -- for that thou hast known God and heard His call
and art attracted to His breaths!  Then prostrate thyself
and kneel down before the gracious Lord, in His
great Kingdom, and say:

     &amp;My Lord!  My Lord!  I praise Thee and I thank
Thee for that whereby Thou hast favored Thine
humble maid-servant, Thy slave beseeching and supplicating
Thee, because Thou hast verily guided her unto
Thine obvious Kingdom and caused her to hear Thine
exalted Call in the contingent world and to behold
Thy Signs which prove the appearance of Thy victorious
reign over all things.
     &amp;O my Lord, I dedicate that which is in my womb
unto Thee.  Then cause it to be a praiseworthy child
in Thy Kingdom and a fortunate one by Thy favor
and Thy generosity; to develop and to grow up under
the charge of Thine education.  Verily Thou art the
Gracious!  Verily Thou art the Lord of Great Favor!&amp;

O thou who art afflicted by a visitation by which thine
        eyes are overflowing with tears!
     Be not grieved and afflicted for this calamity which
hath befallen thee; nay, rather, rejoice that God hath
favored (thy babe) with His heavenly gifts.  Truly,
I say unto thee, wert thou informed of that felicity
which thy babe hath attained in the worlds of God,


+P 140
thy breast would be dilated and thy soul would be
purified.  Truly, I say unto thee, thy child will be
fostered from the breast of the gift of God in the
Exalted Kingdom and will be nursed in the bosom of
mercy in the Supreme World of God.  Therefore, be
filled with delight, for the favor of thy Lord is very
great!
     I beg of God to pour on thee becoming patience,
so that thy heart may be consoled with the fragrance
of His mercy and that thy breast may be dilated with
His favors, that thou mayest attain to the spiritual
states which are lasting forever and ever.
     Thou oughtest to bear it with becoming patience.
Again, thou oughtest to patiently bear this calamity
which hath flowed thine eyes with tears and hath
greatly afflicted thee.

O thou who art advancing unto the Kingdom of God!
     Verily, I read thy beautiful letter, its good composition,
and I scented from the garden of its significances
the fragrance of God's love.  I pray God to confirm
thee in the Path, to cause thee to enter the Ark of
Safety, to reveal unto thee the signs and manifest to
thee the evidences; thus thou mayest be firm in the
love of God, steadfast in the religion of God and a
growing tree by the bounty of the Kingdom of
El-ABHA.
     O maid-servant of God!  Be rejoiced for God hath
made thee a believing maid-servant in His Holy
Threshold and a leaf of the leaves of the Tree of Life.
If God giveth thee good descendants and a manly son,
rest assured in that he will be a good son, looking unto


+P 141
the Supreme Horizon and confident in his soul by the
favors of the Lord of the High Heavens.
     I supplicate God to make His beloved ones in Cincinnati
(O.) glow with the fire of Sinai, imploring unto the
Kingdom of El-ABHA, meek and lowly for the sake
of God among His beloved, denying self and passion,
grasping the rope of piety, so that they may be lamps
of guidance in those regions.  I pray God to make thee
a maid-servant whose garment shall be faithfulness and
the crown of her head the love of El-Baha.
     Convey greeting and praise from me to thy honorable
husband.  I ask God to aid him with a strength
whereat minds shall amaze in the Cause of the Living
God.

O ye+F1 illumined faces!  O ye divine souls! and O ye
        spiritual temples!
     Verily, I read your letter which uttered your extreme
love and entire attraction to the Kingdom of God,
your trust in God, your immersing into the deep seas
of the bounties of God and your chanting the verses
of thanksgiving to God, because He guided you to
His Eternal Kingdom, manifested to you His evident
light, descended upon you a heavenly table through
His great favor, planted you in His glorious vineyard
and caused you to become manifestations of guidance
among the people and dawning-points of wisdom among
the creatures.
     Servants of God!  Sanctify the soul and dilate
the breast by the promise your Lord gave you, that,
verily, He confirms you through the hosts of inspiration.

+P 142
Ye will see (the time when) your faces shine
as stars in the horizon of guidance and your heads
crowned by the crown of success in the Supreme World.

O Thou kind Lord!
     These souls are Thy friends and this gathering is
longing for Thee.  They are captives of the lights of
Thy Beauty and ecstatic by Thy musk-scented locks.
Their hearts are Thine; they are Thy poor, humble and
homeless; they have severed themselves from relative
and stranger and have established the relationship of
unity with Thee.  They have adored Thee.  They were
sons of earth; Thou hast made them new fruits of the
Kingdom.  They were plants of the desert of bereavement;
Thou hast made them trees of the rose-garden of
knowledge.  They were silent; Thou hast made them
speak.  They were extinct; Thou hast lighted them.
They were sterile soil; Thou hast made them the rose-garden
of significances.  They were the children of the
world of humanity; Thou hast caused them to attain
development and the maturity of the Kingdom!
     O kind One!  Grant them shelter and security under
Thy protection, preserve them from tests and trials,
send them invisible help and confer upon them the
doubtless bounty, O Thou kind Beloved!
     They are the body and Thou art the Life.  The
body is dependent for its life and freshness upon the
Spirit -- therefore they are in need of confirmation and
long for the Breaths of the Holy Spirit in this new
Cause!
     Thou art the Able!  Thou art the Giver, the Educator,
the Forgiver, the Pardoner and the Light shining
from the Invisible Realm!


+P 143
O ye+F1 who are attracted to the Heavenly Kingdom!  O
        ye who are enlightened by the Light of Guidance!
        O ye lamps lighted by the Light of Love and
        Affection!
     Verily, I have read your brilliant letter, which indicated
your enkindlement by the fire of the love of
God and prayed [for] your entrance into the Kingdom
of God.
     Blessed ye are, O ye who are firm and steadfast in
the Covenant of God!
     Blessed ye are, O ye shining stars from the horizon
of the love of God!
     I supplicate to God to make you the heralds of His
mercy, spreaders of the fragrances of His holiness, utterers
of His name, servants in His vineyard and dwellers
in the Paradise of El-ABHA; so that ye may become
signs of guidance, standards of love and divine
fruitful trees, cheerfully moved by the breezes of God.
     Make firm your feet in the Cause of God; dilate your
breasts by the glad-tidings of God and turn to the
kingdom of God with pure hearts, sanctified souls, cheerful
spirits, brightened eyes and illumined faces.  Verily,
I say unto you then (when ye become so) the angels of
holiness will welcome you by the glad-tidings of God,
the Mighty, the Powerful.

O ye+F2 maid-servants of the Merciful!  Leaves of the
        Tree of Life!
     Thank ye the Lord, for He hath removed the covering
from off your insight, illuminated your eyes by
witnessing the Sun of Truth, purified your souls, and

2.  To the maid-servants of the Kenosha assembly.
+P 144
hath quickened your hearts through the holy fragrances
which are being diffused from the garden of the kingdom
of His Great Glory!
     O ye maid-servants of the Merciful!  It is incumbent
upon you to soar up with wings of joy and happiness
unto the apex of exultation and gladness; for He hath
assigned unto you the greatest guidance in the Day of
Resurrection, and hath crowned you with the diadem
of glory and divine honor among the women of the
whole world, and hath chosen you above the queens of
the world for His great bounty.
     Verily, the crowns which are on the heads of the
noble women -- the queens of the world -- all their bases
will be finally broken, their gems scattered away, their
luster removed and will become as dispersed dust.  But
your magnificent crowns are everlastingly brilliant and
permanently glorious and mighty and their gems scintillating
throughout cycles and ages.
     This is the highest gift!  This is the greatest bestowal!
Thank ye your Lord for this great bounty and
favor!  O ye maid-servants of the Merciful! verily,
your Lord, the Supreme, is calling upon you from His
Ancient Kingdom and announces unto you such glad-tidings,
whereat the hearts of the angels of heaven
rejoice.
     It is incumbent upon you to strip yourselves of every
old garment (i. e., old beliefs and past customs).  It
is incumbent upon you to be severed from this contemptible
earthly world.  It is incumbent upon you (to
seek after) the Kingdom, in this great Day!
     Purify ye your hearts, sanctify your souls and cleanse
your spirits; so that ye may attain to this great success.


+P 145
Then ye will become the angels of heaven, will enter
among the Supreme Concourse and will permanently
abide in the paradise of union (with God), and will be
associated with the Beauty of El-ABHA.

O ye+F1 firm, steadfast, and faithful Believers!
     Verily, I, from this brilliant and Blessed Spot, speak
to you face to face, while ye are in that far distant
country, saying:
     &amp;O people of loyalty, O people of faithfulness, O
people who are awakened by the Breath of God, O
people who are inhaling the scent of life from the Spirit
of God!  The path hath become smooth, the way
straightened, the carpet of the Kingdom is spread, the
Tabernacle hath been elevated upon the Hill of Might,
the powers of heaven have been shaken, the corners
of the earth have quaked, the sun has been darkened,
the moon ceased to give light, the stars have fallen, the
nations of the earth have lamented, and the Son of Man
hath come upon the clouds of heaven with power and
great glory, and He hath sent His angels with the
sound of the great trumpet, and no one knows the meaning
of these emblems save the wise and informed.
     &amp;Ye are the angels, if your feet be firm, your
spirits rejoiced, your secret thoughts pure, your eyes
consoled, your ears opened, your breasts dilated with
joy, and your souls gladdened, and if you arise to assist
the Covenant, to resist dissension and to be attracted
to the Effulgence!  Verily, I say unto you that the
Word of God has assuredly been explained and has
become an evident sign and a strong and solid proof,


------------------------
1.  To the Kenosha assembly.
+P 146
and its traces shall be spread in the East and West,
and to these all heads shall bow and all souls shall submit
and kneel down with their faces to the ground.&amp;

O ye+F1 dear friends and maid-servants of God!
     A good fragrance is coming from the rose-garden of
Kenosha and a pleasing breeze is blowing from the
orchard of the hearts of the friends and maid-servants
of the Merciful.
     Praise be to God, that town, by the presence of the
beloved ones and the maid-servants of the Merciful,
hath become a veritable paradise and its space, like
unto the heavens, is illuminated with radiant lamps.
If this conflagration and attraction continue for a
period, Kenosha will soon attain great provisions, will
travel with speed through the degrees of existence and
make great progress in the orders of the Kingdom.
     Therefore, this prisoner implores and supplicates at
dawn, seeking strength and confirmation for the beloved
of that town.  Thus may heavenly confirmation become
your associate and the morn of eternal happiness dawn
upon ye and the Sun of Reality rise with such brilliancy
as to dispel entirely the gloom of ignorance from
those horizons.
     O ye real friends and dear maid-servants of God!
The Lover of the East in perfect love has outstretched
His two hands to embrace the beloved of the West and
to rejoice in that love and unity.
     O ye beloved of God!  As long as ye can strive to
set aglow the hearts with love, be attracted to one another


------------------------
1.  To the Kenosha assembly.
+P 147
and be members of each other.  Every soul of
the beloved ones must adore the other and withhold
not his possession and life from them, and by all means
he must endeavor to make that other joyous and happy.
But that other (the recipient of such love) must also
be disinterested and life-sacrificing.  Thus may this
Sunrise flood the horizons, this melody gladden and
make happy all the people, this divine remedy become
the panacea for every disease, this Spirit of Reality
become the cause of life for every soul.
     O ye friends and maid-servants of the Merciful!  It
is life-offering, rejoicing, happiness and the manifestation
of Divine Favors.

O thou servant who art near and dear to the Glorious
        Threshold!
     Give thanks to God for having been ushered into
His Kingdom, partaken of the heavenly table and
the "lord's supper," attained ecstasy by the wine
of His love, become enrolled as a soldier for life among
the hosts of the Lord, and [for His having] blessed thy
head with a crown of great guidance, whose gems and
pearls illumine the ages.
     Convey the greetings of this imprisoned one to the
beloved of God in the spiritual assembly of Kenosha.
Say unto them:  &amp;The Cause is Great!  Great! and the
Kingdom of the Majestic Lord overshadoweth heaven
and earth.  Your spiritual assembly should be a source
of joy to the world of humanity and be so illumined
with light as to dispel the darkened horizons, withstand
the power of tests, remain firm and constant, be not
disturbed by ordeals and feel no difficulty in spreading


+P 148
the light of guidance.  If ye attain this attitude of
firmness, the confirmation of the Divine will verily penetrate
the world through your meeting.  But this requires
disinterestedness in worldly things and devotion to the
Kingdom of ABHA, perseverance and effort are requisites
and firmness is a necessity.  I beg God to illumine
the faces of each of you so that they may shine as stars
in the high firmament.&amp;

O thou who art turning to the divine Kingdom!
     The lengthy epistle was considered.  Notwithstanding
lack of time and opportunity, on account of exceeding
love an answer will be written.
     Thank God thou didst become a soldier of life;
subdued the domain of hearts with the arms of the love
of God and the sword of concord and peace; didst go
after the army of the Kingdom of ABHA; followed the
Supreme Concourse and by the aid of the Spirit made
many conquests.
     The merciful assembly of Kenosha hath in reality
taken food and provisions from the Kingdom of ABHA
and become confirmed by the aid of the Sun of Reality.
Therefore, I am hopeful that, day by day, it may advance
and progress.
     The members of the Spiritual Meeting (the Board
of Consultation) must endeavor, by the power of the
Holy Spirit, to make the souls real Bahais.  If they attain
this glorious purpose, that country will be illumined
and that land will become a veritable paradise, all
nations will look to that assembly and from the explanation
and exposition thereof receive realities and
meanings.


+P 149
     O thou servant of Baha'!  Always remind the friends
of the greatness of the great message.
     Convey longing greeting of great love from me to
the members of the Meeting of Consultation: * * *
Whenever I think of them I find soulful repose and
conscious joy.
     The feast (supper) [every nineteen days] is very
acceptable and will finally produce good results.  The
beloved and the maid-servants of the Merciful must
inaugurate the feast in such wise as to resurrect the
feast of the ancients -- namely, the "lord's supper."
The attracted maid-servant of God, Mrs. ........,
I hope will be inspired so she may become the means
of unity among the friends in every city.  That meeting
for feast for which thou wert preparing and providing,
should recur every so often, so that it may
prove a means of attracting the confirmation of the
Kingdom of ABHA.
     Inform the maid-servant of God, who prepared her
home as a [temporary] Mashrak-el-Azcar, that this
service was accepted in the Kingdom of ABHA.
     Inform the near (dear) maid-servant of God [thy
wife], who hath organized a school of industry in
order that children may learn an industry and chant
communes, that this is very agreeable.
     O thou servant of God!  To look after the sick is
one of the greatest duties.  Every soul who becomes
sick, the other friends should certainly offer the life
(of service) in the utmost kindness.
     Thou hast asked regarding the naming of children:
When thou wishest to name a babe, prepare a meeting


+P 150
therefor; chant the verses and communes, and supplicate
and implore the Threshold of Oneness and beg
the attainment of guidance for the babe and wish confirmated
firmness and constancy; then give the name
and enjoy beverage and sweetmeat.  This is spiritual
baptism.
     His honor, Mr. ......, Mrs. ...... and ......
arrived.  They were attracted by the fragrances of
God and ignited by the fire of the love of God.  With
a new spirit and fresh life they returned.
     O son of the Kingdom!  Thy services in the Kingdom
of ABHA are evident, well known and accepted.
Indeed thou art a truthful servant of the Holy
Threshold and a firm caller to the divine Kingdom.
     Strive so that the odor of violation cease and all
come under the protection of the Covenant.
     Remain in and about that town and know that trial
is the cause of promotion.  But thou must deal with
all in the utmost love and do kindness.  Although they
lift up the head of pride, show thou greater humility
and meekness and treat them with the utmost submission
and lowliness.
     Show the utmost kindness in my behalf to the near
maid-servant of God (thy wife).***

O thou attracted maid-servant of God!
     This is a blessed address.  If thou fulfill its requirements,
which are purity of intention, attractive love,
insight, discovery of truth and absolute spiritual attitude,
thou wilt become entirely free from the physical
conditions and wilt soar to the spiritual realms.


+P 151
O servant of God!
     The content of thy letter was replete with spiritual
feelings and was a source of pleasure and of joy.
     Of my freedom thou hast expressed great joy.  I am
free, although I should remain in prison.  All fortresses
and castles shall not confine me, and the dungeon
cannot bring me under the narrow bondage of
the world.  The spirit is every soaring, even if the body
be in the depths.  What can these ignorant creatures
do?  They might imprison the body, but the spirit
they cannot; the spirit will ever soar in the atmosphere
of eternal bliss and glory.  Therefore, neither the
prison is a cause of sorrow, nor freedom from it a source
of joy.
     When thou findest the way to the Kingdom, the
earthly world shall be of no account; and when thou
art illumined the darkness will not affect thee -- nay,
rather the four corners of the earth will then be radiant
and every thorn will become a rose and a
rose-garden.

O thou who art near to the Threshold of ABHA!
     I have considered what thou hast written to Mirza
...... as well as the letter addressed to me.  Thou
hast written concerning the publication of some proofs
and arguments along with the Hidden Words.  Now,
since they are published, circulate them among the people.
I hope that it may produce beneficial results.  Perchance
some of the souls who are truth-seekers may get
a little information about this Cause.
     But afterward, if thou desirest to get the translation
of a Tablet from the Blessed Writings, it must be translated


+P 152
by a committee of two Persian translators together
with two competent English writers.  The Persians
should translate, and the writers mould the significance
into profound, musical and perfect cast of
style in English, and in such wise that the musical sweetness
of the original Persian may not be lost.  Then the
material must be forwarded to me.  I will consider the
matter and give permission for its publication and circulation.
Consequently, rejoice thou that thou hast
already become specialized with this permission, that
thou hast circulated publications.
     In brief, translation is one of the most difficult arts.
In both Persian and English utmost proficiency is necessary,
that the translator be a writer and use as the
vehicle of expression great eloquence and fluency of
tongue.
     I hope that thou mayest be confirmed with great service
in the Cause of God.
     Announce to ...... on my behalf longing greeting,
and show to him kindness and love with thy whole
energy, for he is very dear to me.

O thou who art firm in the Covenant!
     The letter which thou hast written to his honor,
Mirza ......, was received.  Its contents imparted
the utmost happiness.  Thank God that thou hast
crossed the ocean of the East and the West, reached
to the Goal of Desire and attained to the visit of the
Holy Threshold.
     Although the length of thy stay in this Most Great
Prison was very short, yet I hope that it may become
like unto the oil, which no sooner comes in touch with


+P 153
the fire than it becomes ignited.  Therefore, God willing,
important results will be the outcome of this visit.
     O thou who are firm in the Covenant!  Be thou firm
in the Cause and be engaged in service.  Awaken the
souls and make mindful the (heedless) minds.  The
spiritual outpouring will become uninterrupted and the
meetings of heart to heart constant.  Rest thou assured
upon the favor and bounty of the Beauty of ABHA.
     I became very sad upon hearing the news of the
death of Mr. ......, but I implored and entreated
the Threshold of Oneness and sought mercy in his behalf.
Convey my greeting and love to his son and say:
&amp;Do thou not lament on account of the death of thy
father.  Trust thou in God.  Rely upon the Kingdom
of ABHA.  That father of thine hastened to the world
of immortality and took a share from the realm of the
Merciful and with the utmost joy hath attained to eternal
life in the everlasting universe.  Walk thou also in
the footsteps of thy father and be characterized with
his attributes and qualities.  Enkindle thou his lamp
and fructify his garden, so that thou mayest become his
real son and worthy of the favors and gift of the
Almighty.&amp;***

O my spiritual beloved!
     The days of association and intimacy+F1 are not forgotten
and the sweetness of that love and meeting is
still tasted in my heart.
     Praise be to God!  Its signs are apparent and its results
manifest.  Thank thou God thou wast assisted in
teaching the maid-servant of God, Mrs. ......, and

guidance of innumerable souls.  The confirmation of
the Kingdom is with thee.  Rest thou assured.  Loosen
thy tongue with the utmost fluency and eloquence and
summon the souls to the Kingdom, explain the proofs
and give forth the arguments, and instruct the people
in the exhortations and advices of God.
     I pray in thy behalf and supplicate for thee from
the Kingdom of Glory protection and providence.***

+F1 O thou fresh, slender branch saturated with the abundant
        rain of His bounty!
     I ask God to continue the heavenly abundant gifts
upon thee and to grant thee more freshness, tenderness
and fineness day by day.  Verily I say unto thee that
man is likened unto a tree.  And as the life of a tree
and its tenderness and brilliancy depend on the abundant
rain descending from the clouds, so also the happiness
of man, his pleasure, dignity, loftiness of position
and highness of rank depend on the abundant
bounty of the Kingdom and the light of the Sun of
Truth coming from the horizon of the gift of God.

O thou who art turned to the Kingdom!
     Thou shouldst establish a divine and heavenly transaction.
By God the Truth!  Every divine transaction
is eternal and everlasting and giveth the heavenly spirit
to the pure hearts attracted to God, enlighteneth the
world with the bright shining [light] of love and unity,
affinity and agreement.  But every worldly transaction,

+P 155
although it be a gift through which the far and the
near be profited, still it is transient and temporary and
will not last for ages and its blessings will not extend
successively to the righteous people in the ages to
come.  And as the heavenly abundance and the divine
gifts and the omnipotent grace come in these days
successively and uninterruptedly, therefore, thou
shouldst establish a heavenly edifice to facilitate and
level the way before the divine transaction, to carry out
the divine order, to gladden the pure hearts of every
one, to sanctify thyself from everything but God and to
keep aloof from all the worldly things for the Cause of
God; to be kindled with the fire of the love of God, to
spread the fragrance of God and to expose thyself to
the gentle breeze of God.
     O my dear!  If thou lovest to be happy and pleasant,
this is the cup that is full of the wine of glee and
delight; and if thou desirest to have the ancient glory,
the eternal retinue and the everlasting dominion, thou
must look after these gifts which wave in the horizon
of bounty with a brilliant light to all sides and regions.
     By my life!  If thou knowest what thou art commanded
and speak openly of it, the dominion is for thee,
the Kingdom is for thee and thy shining star will never
set, thy brilliant light never sink, thy brimful treasure
never be consumed and thy brave army never be
deafeated.

O thou who art nurtured from the breasts of the Kingdom
        of God, who wert brought up in the lap of
        the Guidance of God!
     I supplicate to God -- exalted and glorified is He! --
with a submissive, imploring and attracted heart unto


+P 156
the Kingdom of God, to assist thee, while still very
young and of small age, with that by reason of which
the vigorous men and the greatest souls were assisted
in attaining perfection.  Do not be amazed or astonished
at the command of God, according to the ordinances
of Christ -- glory be to Him! -- unto the children
who have been fostered from the breasts of the bounty
of God.  I ask God that thou mayest be as one of them.
This is glad-tidings emanating from a heart filled by
the love of God.  Therefore, know its value and
station.

O thou spiritual temple whose heart is drawn unto the
        Horizon of Certainty!
     Verily, I am now in the Assembly of the beloved of
God, whose hearts are kindled with a burning, blazing
and flaming fire from the fragrance of God, and I have
mentioned thee with a heart overflowing with thy love.
By my God!  It is love which hath surrounded me from
all directions and thus I mention thee with a beating
heart and with a spirit turned unto the horizon of
El-ABHA.
     Therefore, thank God for this bounty, the traces of
which I hope will be spread, its lights shine and the
fragrance of its breath diffused in the whole world of
existence forever and ever.

O thou heavenly, brilliant and precious pearl!
     I greet thee from this Holy Land with a fragrance
from God and I desire that thy heart become animated
through the gentle breeze of God, thy bosom dilated
with joy by the miracles of the gifts of God, thine eye


+P 157
consoled by seeing the lights of God, thy tongue by
uttering the mention of BAHA'O'LLAH, and thy taste to
become sweet through the divine table descending from
heaven.  Verily, I say unto thee that the gifts of thy
Lord are encircling thee in a similar way as the spirit
encircles the body at the beginning of the amalgamation
of the elements and natures in the womb; the power of
the spirit begins then to appear in the body gradually
and successively according to the preparation and capacity
to receive that everlasting abundance.  I ask God to
help thee that the spirit will carry out its power in thee
as desired and wished.

O thou faithful servant of the True One!
     I received thy letter and its contents caused the utmost
joy and fragrance within me, because it showed
thy firmness in the Cause of God and proved thy steadfastness
in the love of the Word of God.  Its meanings
were the mystery of unity and its expression showed thy
firm intention in serving the glorious Lord.
     I beseech the Threshold of Unity with all humility
and supplication to make thee confirmed in His service
and to enable thee to be serviceable in the Holy Threshold;
that thou mayest not be a moment at rest nor take
a breath of composure; nay, rather to pass all thy life
in this greatest gift and this supreme favor employed
in diffusing the breath of God; that thy sincerity of
heart, thy sanctity and purity may increase and that
thou mayest become entirely separated from aught else
save God.  Except a man be purified and sanctified
from the soil of his dependence on this world, the
spiritual purity will not become manifest in him.  The
more the mirror is clear and pure the greater will the


+P 158


rays and the bounties of the Sun of Truth show forth
from it.
     As to those things published in journals against thee:
Thou shouldst not be grieved nor sorry therefor,
because thousands of journals have written traducing
Abdul-Baha, have given false and base accusations and
awful calumnies.  Notwithstanding these he was neither
troubled nor grieved thereby; nay, rather these cause
me to exert myself more than usual in the path of God
and to drink the cup of sacrifice and to boil in the fire
of His love.  Man must seek to gain the acceptance of
God and not that of the different classes of men.  If
one is praised and chosen by God, the accusation of all
the creatures will cause no loss to him; and if the man is
not accepted in the threshold of God, the praise and
admiration of all men will be of no use to him.
     By all these it is meant that thou must not be sorry
and grieved because of these things the papers have
written against thee; nay, rather trust in God and be
unmoved by either the praise or the false accusations
declared by people towards thee, depend entirely on
God and exert thyself to serve His holy vineyard.  All
else save this is but imagination, though it be the praises
of all people in thy behalf; because all else is of no
result and bears no fruit.
     As to thine action against the journal which hath
libeled thee:  It is not at all best to bring action against
them, because there is no profit in doing that; nay, it
will lead to more sayings of a similar nature.  Under
these circumstances silence is best.  Thou must not be
disappointed, sorry or grieved thereat; God will remove
all these difficulties.  If thou wilt employ thyself


+P 159
in the service (of the Cause of God) the past losses
will be recovered and all the troubles will be settled.
     This is the manifest truth.
     Send my greeting to the enlightened leaf, the maid-servant
of God, thy noble wife.

O thou son of the Kingdom!
     Consider the bounty of the Lord and the gifts of thy
Creator.  He hath chosen thee to love Him and selected
thee from among His beings to know Him and distinguished
thee particularly with the gift of dazzling light
through which the faces of the righteous will shine.
Verily I say unto thee that this gift now signifieth a
globule and a date stone which shall spring up and
grow until it becometh a tree of solid root and the
branches thereof will extend to the East and West.
Then the tongues shall utter:  "This is naught but a
great bounty!"

O thou who art rejoicing at the Glad-tidings of God!
     Thank thou God for that by reason of which He hath
enabled thee to traverse the seas and countries and come
safe to a Spot wherein the lights are shining with great
brilliancy.  Thank Him for the help He rendered thee
to visit the pure and Holy Tomb and revolve around it,
the fragrance of which hath excelled that of the flowers
of the dawn.
     Go back to those regions where thy return is expected
by those souls who, through the signs of thy Lord, became
attracted unto Him, the Unconstrained, and say
unto them:  &amp;Glad-tidings unto you who are sincere!
Glad-tidings unto you who are faithful servants!  Verily
I have seen the Kingdom of God with its doors open,


+P 160
the garden of El-ABHA with extensive sides and regions,
with dazzling lights, rolling seas, verdant and beautiful
orchards, overflowing beds, green trees, fresh and bright
leaves, perfumed flowers, sweet rivers, gentle breeze,
beautiful air, magnificent views, elegant and handsome
lips and mouths.&amp;
     Tell them that &amp;The suns of the garden of El-ABHA
are still shining, the moons rising, the stars brightening,
the gifts perpetual, the grace perfect, the glad-tidings
spreading, the signs of singleness and oneness are
chanted in the cloister of its Godhead and the flags of
sanctity are waving above the palaces of its glory.
Come here!  Come here!&amp;

O thou who art drawn unto God and kindled by the Fire
        which burned on Mt. Sinai!
     Set aside every mention save the mention of God and
abandon everything save the divulgence of the Testament,
be attracted by the magnet of the Covenant that
thou mayest see the triumph of the angels of the King
of the Kingdom and the valor of the hosts of the Lord
of Might.  By the life of the Lord!  The Invincible
Power will indeed strengthen, the Holy Spirit will
speak in thy mouth, the Word of God will be revealed
in thy heart, the sound of the trumpet of the Lord will
gladden thee, the light of unity will shine from thy
brow, the doors of success and prosperity will be opened
upon thy face and the secrets of the Holy Books will
be unfolded.  Then, at that time, thou shalt cry at the
top of thy voice, saying:  &amp;Blessed I am for this great
bounty!  Blessed I am for this evident victory!  Blessed
I am for this power which could not be resisted by the
powers of whomsoever is upon the earth!&amp;


+P 161
To him who is looking unto God!  O thou who art
        gazing unto the Center of the Covenant -- may God
        confirm thee!
     I supplicate God, beseech Him and pray to Him that
He may deliver the souls from the deluge of tests and
kindle the lamp of sincerity in the midst of the hearts.
As to thee -- O thou who art sincere in the Cause of God,
looking unto the Kingdom of God and uttering the
praise of God! -- thank thou Him for that by reason of
which He hath made thee wholly faithful in His Cause,
kindled thy heart with the fire of the Testament, illumined
thy mind with the light and conveyed unto thy
spirit the glad-tidings of the breaths of the Holy Spirit
in the world of effulgence.  Therefore, roll up thy
sleeves to serve the Covenant, make the hearts firm in
the Covenant of the beloved Lord, create harmony and
agreement among the believers and impart to them the
glad-tidings of the confirmation which they will receive
from God if the differences of opinion be removed and
if they unite and agree, be firm in spreading the fragrance
of God, divulging the traces and chanting the
signs of God.  Verily, I send thee good news of the
confirmation which thou shalt receive, the like of which
was never seen by the eyes in those regions, and of the
success, the lights of which will brilliantly shine in those
regions -- if thou wilt arise with all thy power to assist
the Testament of God and to serve the Covenant of
God.
     Give all the beloved salutations and praise.  El-Baha
is upon you all, O people of El-Baha!


+P 162
O ye who are turned towards the Kingdom and drawn
        unto the Holy Fragrance diffused from the Garden
        of El-ABHA!
     Arise with every power to assist the Covenant of
God and serve in His vineyard.  Be confident that a
confirmation will be granted unto you and a success on
His part is given unto you.  Verily, He shall support
you by the angels of His holiness and reinforce you
with the breaths of the Spirit that ye may mount the
Ark of Safety, set forth the evident signs, impart the
spirit of life, declare the essence of His commands
and precepts, guide the sheep who are straying from
the fold in all directions, and give the blessings.  Ye
have to use every effort in your power and strive earnestly
and wisely in this new century.  By God, verily
the Lord of Hosts is your support, the angels of heaven
your assistance, the Holy Spirit your companion and the
Center of the Covenant your helper.  Be not idle, but
active and fear not.  Look unto those who have been
in the former ages -- how they have resisted all nations
and suffered all persecutions and afflictions, and how
their stars shone, their attacks proved successful, their
teachings established, their regions expanded, their
hearts gladdened, their ideas cleared and their motives
effective.  Ye are now in a great station and noble rank
and ye shall find yourselves in evident success and prosperity,
the like of which the eye of existence never saw
in former ages.
     El-Baha and salutations be upon every one who is
firm in the Covenant, free from dissension, sanctified
from deceits and steadfast in the path.


+P 163
O thou herald of the Kingdom of God!
     Hearken with the ears of (thy) spirit to the Concourse
of El-ABHA, and thou wilt hear, verily, the
angels of the Supreme Concourse blessing and praising
thee, while saying:  &amp;Be thou rejoiced, O thou who hast
arisen to serve the Cause of God and to promote the
Word of God, and be gladdened at the light of the
gift of God!&amp;
     By God, the True One, verily, the gifts of God are
in such profusion as to rush like a torrent, overflow
as a sea, and shower as rain.  Gird up thy loins,
strengthen thy back, make firm thy feet, and exert thyself
in quickening souls, dilating breasts, illumining insights,
giving hearing to ears, and attracting hearts.
Unseal the jars of the choice wine of the love of God,
and give the craving ones to drink from this cup which
is overflowing with the knowledge of God.
     O my friend, the affection of my heart unto thee
cannot be expressed through any interpretation, and I
can hardly write it or acknowledge it:  Turn with thy
breast unto the heart of Abdul-Baha, and then this concealed
fact will be disclosed, and the hidden mystery
[be] unveiled unto thee.
     Verily, I beseech God to make thee a tree with ripened
fruits within reach, overshadowing those regions.
     It is incumbent upon thee to be meek, to be humble,
to be submissive and suppliant before the Threshold of
the Merciful.  It is incumbent upon thee to serve the
beloved of God in that spiritual clime.
     Send my greeting and praise to thy revered wife, to


+P 164
thy esteemed daughter and to thy other children.  I beg
of God to enable all of them to render service to His
Cause in His great vineyard.

O thou who hast arisen to render service to the Cause
        of God in His Great Vineyard!
     Verily, I have already written thee several letters,
and sent them to thee at different times.  Now, I address
thee with such words whereby the souls of the
proximate ones are rejoiced, and the faces of the sincere
ones are cheered.
     O my friend, verily the Cause is great and great, and
the penetration of the Word of God in the temple
(body) of all the regions is similar to the pervasion of
the soul in a sound body.
     By the life of Baha', verily, the power of the Kingdom
of God hath taken hold of the pillars of the world,
and hath possessed all the nations.  Thou wilt surely
find the standards of the Testament waving in all regions,
the chanting of the verses of unity raised in
exalted assemblies, and the lights of the Sun of Truth
and its heat dispersing the thick clouds massed on the
horizon.  Be rejoiced at this glad-tidings, whereby the
hearts of the sincere among the beloved are cheered.
     O my friend, isolate all thy faculties and senses from
every other mention and thought, and follow the example
of Abdul-Baha in servitude to the Holy and Exalted
Threshold.  Hasten to the field of sacrifice, craving
for the most great martyrdom; expend thy life and
all of thy grades in love for God and in attraction to
the Beauty of El-ABHA.


+P 165
     By God, the True One, man should seek only this
bounty, inasmuch as it is everlasting, eternal, divine,
spiritual, luminous and merciful.  Be sanctified from all
the universe, and send my greeting and praise to the
spiritual leaf, the being who relies upon the grace of
her Lord -- the maid-servant of God, thy revered wife,
and say unto her that she may address the veiled ones
(those blind to the Truth), saying:  &amp;Verily, eyes are
dazzled by gazing at the sun, and it is impossible to
consider it because of the intensity of its rays; and verily
the sea cannot be contained in a cup.  The weakness
of eyes does no harm to the sun, nor the smallness
of the cup to the sea.&amp;
     Then let her explain to the people, and make known
to every questioner, by saying:  &amp;Verily, minds are limited,
and the splendor of lights is so great as not to be
comprehended by (man's) reflective faculties.  Ye
ought to have the sigh of the heart so that ye may apprehend
the reality of the mysteries of God which are
deposited behind coverings.&amp;

O thou who hast sought illumination from the Light of
        the Guidance of God!
     Verily I read thy words of thanksgiving to God for
that He hath directed thee to His Kingdom, illuminated
thine insight with the light of guidance, and baptized
thee with the water which hath descended from
heaven, with the fire which was ignited in the Sinaitic
Tree, and with the Holy Spirit which quickeneth hearts
and souls.  Then, thank thou God for this gift whereby
thy face is shining amid the concourse of Chosen
Ones.


+P 166
     Know thou, verily, man before reaching (spiritual)
maturity passes his days and only apprehends trivial
things which are clear on account of their exoteric indications,
but when he attains full development, then he
grasps the reality of things and their esoteric facts.
Every day after maturity is equivalent to one year before
it, on account of (man's) perception, understanding
apprehension and discoveries.
     Now, thou hast reached development and apprehended
the degree of maturity:  Gaze at the grades of
the existence, the realities of beings, the allegories in
the epistles of God, and the mysteries in the Old and
New Testament.  By the life of Baha', the covering
will be removed from off thee (i. e., facts will be unfolded
to thee), and thou wilt be informed of that
which all the philosophers and wise men are unable to
apprehend.  Verily, this is a gift which God assigns
only to such of His chosen servants as He willeth.  Verily,
thy Lord will inspire thee with the mysteries of God,
the Protector, the Self-subsistent.
     Verily, I beseech the Lord of Hosts to increase thy
faith each day over that of the previous day, to confirm
thee through His Holy Spirit, to give thee capacity to
partake of the lights of knowledge and wisdom, to
make thee a herald of the Covenant in those regions,
and to instruct thee in that which thou knowest not; so
that thou mayest become a physician for bodies as well
as souls, to heal bodies with the medicines which are
useful and beneficial for physical (sickness), and to
cure hearts and souls with that antidote which quickeneth
hearts and souls.
     O my friend, it is incumbent upon thee to be severed


+P 167
(from all else save God), to be attracted, to be sincere,
and to spend thy life in the path of God.  Be thou holy,
spiritual, divine, lively, brilliant, godlike, sanctified,
pure, with merciful character, firm in the Covenant,
fluent and knowing; and gaze toward the Kingdom of
El-ABHA with a heart brimming over with the love of
God, with tears flowing the commemoration of God,
with a face scintillating through the light of God, with
a heart sincere to the beloved of God, and with a
sword which divides truth from falsehood.  By God,
the True One, the Spirit of Baha' will assist thee with
such strength that all the concourse of the earth will
fail (to withstand).

O my Lord, my Hope!+F1
     Praise be unto Thee, for Thou hast sent down unto
us this spiritual table, supreme benefit and heavenly
blessing.  O our Lord!  Strengthen us to partake of
this heavenly food, so that its fine essence may run
through the pillars of our spiritual being and that we
may thereby obtain a celestial power for serving Thy
Cause, promulgating Thy signs and adorning Thy vineyard
with lofty trees, the fruits whereof shall be near
(to gather) and of perfuming fragrances.  Verily Thou
art the Possessor of great bounty!  Verily Thou are the
Clement, the Merciful!

O my Lord, my Hope!+F2
     Thanks be unto Thee for these foods and benefits.
O Lord!  Suffer us to ascend to Thy Kingdom and to
sit at the tables of thy divine world.  Nourish us with


------------------------
1.  May be said before meals.
2.  May be said after meals.
+P 168
the food of Thy meeting and cause us to attain to the
sweetness of beholding Thy beauty, forasmuch as this
is the utmost wish, the mightiest gift and the greatest
bestowal.  O Lord, O Lord!  Make this feasible unto
us.  Verily Thou art the Beneficent, the Giver!  Verily
Thou art the Bestower, the Mighty, the Merciful.

O thou seeker of the True One!
     If thou wishest the divine knowledge and recognition,
purify thy heart from all beside God, be wholly
attracted to the ideal, beloved One; search for and
choose Him and apply thyself to rational and authoritative
arguments.  For arguments are a guide to the
path and by this the heart will be turned unto the Sun
of Truth.  And when the heart is turned unto the Sun,
then the eye will be opened and will recognize the Sun
through the Sun itself.  Then (man) will be in no need
of arguments (or proofs), for the Sun is altogether
independent, and absolute independence is in need of
nothing, and proofs are one of the things (of which absolute
independence has no need).  Be not like Thomas;
be thou like Peter.  I hope you will be healed physically,
mentally and spiritually.

O maid-servant of God!
     Thank God, thy faith increased and thou didst become
attached to the Kingdom of the Merciful.  Endeavor
and supplicate and pray God that, day unto day,
thy firmness and steadfastness may grow and that thy
countenance may radiate through the light of guidance.
Thus shalt thou stand solid as an iron mountain.  For
firmness attracts the bounty of God and steadfastness is


+P 169
a magnet to receive His strength.  Pray thou God for
this (attainment), and I will pray to Him to awaken
the two people that they may avoid alcoholic drinks.
     Hypnotism hath a weak influence over bodies, but
hath no result.  But the power of the Kingdom of God
is great.  If thou canst, endeavor to obtain a share
of that power.
     I ask God to help [thy son] in attaining faith and
assurance and in directing himself to the desired One.
Although young, he shall attain maturity.  May the
love of God take root in his heart from his youthful age.

O thou who art a young tree in the Garden of the Love
        of God!
     I supplicate to God that He may develop and flourish
thee with the shower of mercy, the heat and light
of the Sun of Truth and the soul-imparting breeze of
the Paradise of ABHA and to bestow upon thee a great
limitless delicacy and freshness.

O thou who art quickened by the Divine Fragrances!
     I considered thy letter.  Its expression was wonderful
and indicated the brilliancy of thy heart and conscience.
Be hopeful of the mercy of the Lord of
Creation, whose grace is infinite and the sea of whose
gift is boundless.  I beg of the abundant favor of
that Ancient Lord that thou mayest decorate thy
spiritual reality (being) with the human perfections, be
endowed with a new life, keep steadfast in the Covenant,
diffuse the fragrances (i. e., teach the Truth) and deliver
the Cause of God.

+P 170
O thou who art acknowledging the Oneness of God!
     Verily, I read thy letter which contained beautiful
meanings and wonderful texts; was informed of thy
turning unto God and thy attainment unto the bounty
of the Kingdom, which is apparent and manifest by
the appearance of God.
     O maid-servant of God!  Let not thy hands tremble
nor thy heart be disturbed, but rather be confident and
firm in the love of thy Lord, the Merciful, the Clement.
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily, all existence is [a
book of] pages and tablets which utter the glad-tidings
of the appearance of the Kingdom of thy Lord, the
Supreme, the Great.
     Observe the pages of the universe and discover the
traces which appeared!  Hast thou seen or heard in
any of the previous centuries or generations that which
is manifested in this Glorious Age?  If the writings
of the previous centuries, the middle centuries and the
later centuries, be compared with that which is manifested
in this single century, they will not weigh against
it!  nay, rather, they are as drops of water in comparison
with the ocean.  Magnified is He, who hath
crowned this century with the appearance of His
Kingdom!
     As to thee, turn unto God with a heart cheerfully
swayed by His love and kindled by the fire of His desires,
both day and night.  The lights of God will appear
unto thee, the mysteries of God be unfolded to thee
and thy bosom healed by the exhortations uttered by the
Supreme Pen.
     Convey my greeting and praise to thy respected husband
and say to him that the Jews are still expecting


+P 171
Christ and long to see Him in all anticipation and great
zeal, while His light was manifested, His beauty shone
forth, His call was raised, His trumpet blown, His
standard hoisted, and His stars sparkled; but the Pharisees
are yet in an amazing slumber, immersed in former
traditions, and they make play with the signs of Thy
Lord, the Merciful, the Clement.
     Thank God that He guided thee unto the fountain
of guidance, gave thee to drink from the cup of affection,
summoned thee unto His Supreme Kingdom and
chose thee from among those people.  This is a favor
wholly above comprehension and is not realized by the
intellects which are negligent of the Lord of hosts and
angels.
     O thou friend!  Endeavor so that thou mayest ascend
to the station which is above the firmaments, near to the
Generous Lord who created and made thee.

O thou bright pearl!
     Endeavor, and spare no effort, and hasten to the
Kingdom of thy Lord, the Lord of the shining and
clear evidences and arguments.
     Verily, by Truth, every seed cast in this great and
magnificent century (period) will be cultivated by God
and produce plants through the abundance of the clouds
of His mercy, which preceded the postulates, and from
which all the existing beings have been awakened and
issued, and to which they will return.
     Therefore, use thy utmost power to sow and cast
those pure seeds, the divine teachings, in the hearts
which move and cheer by the fragrance of God.
     Convey my greeting and praise to thy honored,


+P 172
noble-minded husband, for I love him with all that
is within me.

O thou who art attracted by the Breaths of God! -- may
        God confirm thee!
     Verily I read thy letter, which contained expressions
like as of "the pure sealed wine," showing what throbs
of the thoughts of the love of God in the mind of that
righteous one (thyself) and that which shines of the
lights of the knowledge of God in the heart of that
beloved one.
     I beseech God to ordain thee as a sign of His great
signs, to confirm thee to shine as a light in the lantern
of America; to cause thee to be stripped and cut from
all positions, to announce the good tidings of God, to
diffuse the breaths of God, to speak the praise of God
and to turn thy face to the Kingdom of ABHA, to be
freed from depending on this world, to be kindled by
the fire of the love of God, to be adorned with the
ornament of perfection; to be the center of those virtues
and characteristics wherewith the inner qualities of
man are ornamented, to be confirmed by the breaths of
the Holy Ghost, to call on the name of God.
     O my beloved one!  It is incumbent upon thee to
be firm in the Covenant and to stand up and serve the
religion of God.  Verily, this is the magnet of confirmation
and assistance, the attracter of all success and
the leader of hosts of gifts.
     May God protect thee from all accidents!  May the
Glory of ABHA be upon thee!
     Convey my greetings to the spiritual leaf, the servant
of God, thy honored wife, the esteemed ........,


+P 173
and say unto her:  &amp;Serve in the olive garden of God,
that God may help thee by those confirmations by which
intellects are astounded and the perceptions are cleared.&amp;

O thou who art sincere in the Religion of God!
     Verily, the maid-servant of God, the assured leaf
[thy wife] hath presented herself in the Sacred Spot
and is blessed by the pure and holy dust, inhaled the
fragrances of God from the meadow of Abdul-Baha.  She
will soon return unto thee, while being watched over
by the glance of the providence of God.
     I beseech God to cause thee to partake of the heavenly
table, to be firm in the love of God and to transmit
His lights in those regions; to make thee severed from
all else save Him and to be a servant of His Cause,
and to strengthen thee with a power which may penetrate
into the reality of things.

O thou who art attracted by the Speech of Abdul-Baha!
     Verily I speak unto thee through the tongue of my
spirit, from the spiritual direction, and explain for thee
the mysteries of the kingdom and the meanings of the
sacred, heavenly books.  Direct thyself unto the Lord
of the Supreme World and loosen thy tongue, so that
He shall confirm thee by the spirit of Beyan (i. e., explanation)
and breathe into thy mouth the Holy Spirit
and move thy tongue with the best meanings and
mysteries.
     Trust in God and rely on His great bounty, because
His bounty is overflowing like the seas, brilliant like
unto the lights, flowing like currents of water and raining


+P 174
like the clouds.  It is incumbent upon thee to be
humble, lowly and submissive at the appearance of the
lights of the gifts of thy Lord, in every instant.  Serve
the friends of God under all circumstances and conditions.
This is the station of the spiritual ones; this
is the honor of the Bahais; this is the glory of the sincere
ones and this is the sovereignty of the unitarians.

O thou who art attracted unto the Beauty of ABHA!
     Verily I call thee, from this Spot, with a speech
whereby the spirit is breathed into hearts and bodies,
and address thee with a calling whereby His clear wine
overflows in the fountain of a heart which is consumed
by the love of God.
     Verily, I love thee with my heart, my spirit and my
mind, and associate with thee in spirit (and converse
with thee) by my innate tongue.  I love for thee to
arise for that to which I have arisen in servitude to the
Sublime and Holy Threshold, turning unto God, hoping
for martyrdom, so that thou mayest attain to the
gift, the lights of which glisten in the eternal horizon.+F1

O thou whose heart is overflowing with the love of God!
     Verily, I received thy beautiful letter and praised
God for kindling the fire of His love in thy heart and
cheering thy spirit with the cup of the gift of thy Lord.
I ask God to increase thy intoxication with this wine
and gladden thy spirit with this great gospel.  I wrote
letters to those whose names thou didst mention in thy
letter.  Deliver them with rejoicing face, revived heart,
and tongue uttering the name of the Merciful.

+P 175
O thou who art confident in the appearance of the Kingdom
        of God!
     Verily I read thy letter, which was beautifully composed
and which proved thy great love, the extent of
thy knowledge and the illumination of thy sight, by
witnessing the signs whereunto the heads bow in reverence
and faces show respect.
     O beloved!  Thank God that He chose thee for His
love and elected thy wife for the calling of the appearance
of the Kingdom of God.  Verily, this is a great
favor, and wert thou aware of the results which will
follow it in the Kingdom of God, thou wouldst, verily,
rejoice exceedingly and wouldst call with loud voice:
&amp;Blessed are we for this great favor, and glad-tidings
be unto us for this glorious attainment.&amp;
     Consider the past, so that thou mayest become informed
of the mysteries which shall be disclosed in the
future.  When the disciples were calling in the name
of Christ, the Jews scoffed, scorned and laughed at
them.  They were saying, "They (i. e., the disciples)
are taken with madness, and madness is made an art."
They even beat them with whips, threw stones at them,
prevented the people from approaching them, and were
saying, "This man (Christ) is naught but a sorcerer,
blasphemeth God and is possess of a devil."
     Then observe how that persecution and scorn were
changed to glory, honor and reverence.  Ultimately,
they (the Jews) honored their sublime stations and
acknowledged their loftiness, which was exalted, promoted
and glorified in the center of the horizons until
it reached the degree of exaggeration in deeds.  They


+P 176
made for them likenesses and pictures, decorated with
jewels shining in the eyes; they placed these likenesses
or pictures in the temples, churches and
monasteries built on the tops of the mountains, and worshipped
them with respect, glory, majesty and reverence.
This is the condition of the neglectful ones who
are deprived of the Truth (the Manifestations of God)
at the day of their existence among them.  After the
ascension of their (the prophets') spirits unto the Center
of Purity and Piety, then the negligent ones repent
and return, making likenesses and pictures according to
their own ideas, which do not bear resemblance, and
worship the same.  This is the station of the ignorant
ones who are as animals, following every croaker and
shaken by every wind.  "Forsake them to play in their
shallow waters."
     As to thee:  Be happy because of what thy Lord,
the Clement, the Merciful, hath given thee; choosing
thee and thy esteemed wife for entrance into His Kingdom,
for calling in His name, praising Him in assemblies,
gatherings and meetings.
     The truth I verily say unto thee, this divine grace
cannot be exchanged for the sovereignty of the earth,
the east or the west.  For that (the worldly kingdom)
is naught but dreams, torture to the spirit, trouble for
the hearts; its mortality is certain and its destruction
a well known fact -- while this spiritual kingdom and
divine grace will shine, and it is an ABHA (Glorious)
jewel which will glisten on the diadems of great glory
in the course of centuries and cycles.


+P 177
O thou who art directed unto God!
     Thy revered wife, Mrs. ........, is indeed confirmed
by the fragrances of the spirit and rendered victorious
by the hosts of the Kingdom.  Verily, she hath
abandoned comfort and ease; calleth in the name of God
in those regions; hath remained firm in God's religion;
and no power of test hath shaken her.  Rest thou assured!
Her light shall shine in the globe of the love
of God and her face shall be illumined with the light
of God's bounty!
     I pray for a heavenly blessing to descend upon the
heart of [thy wife], for she arose for the spreading of
God's fragrances.  I ask God to protect thee and her
from the winds of trial.  May thy tongue be moved
to utter beautiful explanations and may the hearts of
the people of Johnstown (N. Y.) become tender, so
that they may be guided to the Fountain of the Water
of Life and be illumined by the lights shining from the
kingdom of heaven.

     +F1 Be not in despair, but rather smile by the mercy of
thy Lord; and be not sorrowful when meeting with
worldly difficulties and depressions, for they pass away
-- and thine shall be immortality during ages and centuries,
times and cycles.

     +F2 Be not sad on account of poverty, nor be sorrowful
when the people scorn thee.  Remember the poverty of
Jesus, the persecution of the Jews to His glorious person
and the scorn of Him.  Verily, that poverty is the
glory of the beginning and the ending.  It is a light
which hath illumined the heavens and the earth.

     ***Consider not the present state, for it is
the time of sowing seeds in that country (America)
and, of course, great difficulties are met with, differences
and hindrances of the people being severe.  Firmness
must uphold us.  As the servants and the maid-servants
of the Merciful stand firmly and persevere,
the good see will soon grow and bear the fruit of
blessing.  Then will spirit and fragrance prevail, and
joy and rejoicing come from the heavenly sphere; the
sorrows and toils shall be forgotten and the eternal
peace and rest appear.  I trust, through the bounty of
ABHA, that ye may be strengthened to serve and to
spread the Word of God.***

whomsoever Thou willest and deprivest whomsoever
Thou willest not+F1 !  Shouldst Thou treat justly, we all
are sinners and deserve to be deprived; and shouldst
Thou observe mercy, every sinner shall be made pure
and every stranger shall become a friend.  Therefore,
forgive and pardon and grant Thy mercy unto all.
Thou art the Forgiver, the Light-giver and the
Compassionate!

O thou sign of the Love of God!
     Be rejoiced that thou hast held the cup of providence
in thy hand and drunk the choice wine of guidance,
opened thine eye and witnessed the lights of the Kingdom,
unstopped thine ear and heard thy voice of the
Lord of Hosts.
     Be not grieved at the death of thy dear daughter.
This divine bird flew away to the rose-garden of the
Merciful and that plant of humanity hastened to the
garden of the Kingdom of El-ABHA.  That drop returned
to the Most Great Sea and that ray betook herself
to the Most Great Orb.  Be happy and thankful
because thou wilt see her face shining in the divine
Kingdom and wilt find her as a lamp amid an assembly
in the spiritual heaven.

O thou who art commemorating the praises of God!
     Verily, I read thy letter of elegant expression, for
which I supplicate to God to make thee meek, humble


------------------------
1.  "Deprivest whomsoever Thou willest not," refers to the reward and
      punishment of the souls according to its deeds.  There are many instances
      of this in all the heavenly Scriptures.
+P 180
and fit for the effulgence of the light of His love among
the maid-servants; and (I beg of God) to make all
mankind the children of His mercy!  This is the utmost
mercy of Abdul-Baha for which he is endeavoring
night and day and is summoning all to this fountain
which is flowing with the pure water of the gift of God.
Verily, I pray God to assembly all mankind in the
shadow of the standard of peace and under the tents
of love in the Paradise of El-ABHA; so that all of them
may become the children of God and His beloved ones.
Verily thy Lord is compassionate to the servants who
are rightly guided.
     As to thee:  Appreciate the value of thy father, for
he taught thee to await the manifestation of the Light
of Lights.  Verily he hath inhaled the fragrance of
the Paradise of El-ABHA and his nostrils are therewith
perfumed.  Therefore, he bade thee to anticipate and
prepare thyself for the appearance of the Kingdom of
God.

O thou dear one!
     Blessed art thou, for thou hast entered into the bosom
of the training of God and drunk the cup of knowledge
while thou art young in age among girls.  Thank thou
God for that He hath caused thee to taste the sweetness
of His love at thy earliest childhood.  I beg of God
to protect thee from wavering in the Cause of God, to
make thee firm in the Covenant of God, to guard thy
mother in the stronghold of His great Kingdom and
to make thee a girl successful and nurtured from the
breast of the love of God, refreshed from the milk of
His knowledge in this great day.


+P 181
O thou young in age and great in mind!
     [There is] many a young child who is mature and
grown up, and many an aged [one] who is ignorant and
stupid.  Growth and maturity are in intellect and understanding
and not in age and duration of life.  Verily thou
hast know thy Lord while thou art young in age; but
there are thousands of women who are heedless of the
commemoration of God, veiled from the Kingdom of
God and deprived of the bounty of the gift of God.  As
to thee, thank thy Lord for this great gift.  I beg of God
to heal thy mother, who is revered in the Kingdom of
God.

O my God, my God!
     I am a servant attracted to Thee, humbly coming to
the door of Thy Oneness and addressing the kingdom
of Thy mercy.
     Yes, my God, permit that I should be entirely Thine,
occupied in thinking of Thee, inflamed by the fire of
Thy love and separated from all except Thee, so that
I may work in Thy Cause, spread Thy wisdom, transmit
Thy knowledge and the joy of knowing Thee.
     Yes, my God, I am a flame lighted by the hand of
Thy power.  Do not permit that it be extinguished by
the winds of trials.  Increase my love for Thee, my
ardor for the Beauty of Thy Oneness, the fire that
burneth in me in the Sinai of Thy Singleness, and the
eternal life in me, through Thy bounty and grace; for
Thou art the Protector, the Watcher, the Pitiful and
the Merciful!


+P 182
O thou who art attached to the Beauty of God!
     Verily, I was rejoiced when I read thy excellent letter,
which portrayed a spiritual attraction and a rejoicing
at the (news) of the merciful Kingdom!  Know
thou verily, the hand of divine Providence hath attracted
thee to the Throne of the Kingdom, and the divine
glad-tidings hath caused such joy and happiness in thee,
that thou hast removed the covering and lifted the veiling
from the Countenance of the Divine Beauty, beheld
the Brilliant Face through thine insight, and became
cognizant of the mysteries of purity and sanctity in this
divine Cause!
     Now, with a heart overflowing with the love of God,
supplicate to God with all joy, and thank thou God
for this guidance and this high gift.  And know thou,
that verily, the vanguards of the gifts of thy Lord
shall overtake thee from all sides (parts) when thy
feet become firm in the Path.

O thou who art attracted to the Light of Guidance!
     Verily, I read the signs of thy thanks to God, for
He hath guided thee unto the Path of the Kingdom,
dispelled the darkness, caused thee to enter into the
light of faith, and awakened thee to the proof and
argument.  This is through the grace of thy Lord,
the Merciful, who hath chosen thee for His knowledge
and hath adorned thy head with the crown of His love
which is scintillating in the apex of glory and
beneficence.
     Verily, I beseech the Threshold of Mercifulness to
kindle the lamp of light within thy heart, so that thy
breast may thereby be dilated and thy soul rejoiced.


+P 183
     Thou art present in spirit in a meeting (in Acca)
in which the gifts of God are radiating, even though
thou art remote in regard to body in the far away land.
     As to thy coming here now, this is not in accord
with the wisdom revealed in the Gospels.  But the time
shall come and thou wilt attain to the gifts of thy Lord.
But for the present, make thy tongue fluent in praising
thy clement Lord at every moment and time, so that
thou mayest attain to all good under the shadow of
the Lord of Generosity and Beneficence.

O thou who hast gained illumination from the Light of
        Guidance!
     Verily, I perused thy brilliant letter, which showed
that thou hast advanced toward God, thy sight illumined
by witnessing the signs of God, thy heart cheered
by the sacred and spiritual breeze which is being blown
from the garden of the Kingdom of God.
     It behooveth thee to spend thy life, body and blood
in the path of God, for this mighty gift.
     Verily, I inhale the fragrance of faithfulness from
the believers of that brilliant and pure city.  I beg of
God to make His beloved and maid-servants in that
city as one band, united in soul, heart and tongue, even
as stars assembled in the constellation of Unity, although
the distance between them is extensive and the
interval infinite.x
     O maid-servant of God!  Know thou, the first bounty
from the True One is love, unity and harmony, and
without these all the deeds pass in vain and give no
result.  Love is the result of the Manifestation and


+P 184
the glorious purpose of the rising of Light on the
Mount, in the Sinai of the Forgiving Lord.
     It is incumbent upon you (to act) with merciful harmony
and spiritual unity, so that the bounties of your
Lord may embrace you and make you as waves in this
sacred, moving sea.  This is seemly of the believing
women!  This is the spirit of the assured women!  This
is the light of the peaceful women!  This is the ultimate
wish of the attracted women!
     Verily, I beseech God to illumine thy sight by witnessing
the light of hopes and cause thee to speak His
praise among the maid-servants, and to make thee steadfast
in this path, on which feet have slipped through
the power of tests.
     And I beg of Him to enable thee to confirm thy
parents and make thee a servant in His great vineyard,
and cause the consolation of thine eye, thy noble child,
to enter the garden of His exalted Kingdom.

O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!
     Verily, I read thine excellent letter and was informed
of thy turning unto God, thy drawing near unto the
lofty holy Threshold, thy drinking from the Fountain
of Life and that thine heart hath partaken of the lights
of heaven.  Verily, I beg of God to ordain for thee in
the future to come to this Blessed and White Land, to
cause thee to hear the melodies of the Dove and to
grant that thou mayest present thyself before the hands
of Abdul-Baha.
     Exert thyself, O maid-servant of God, that thou
mayest guide thy relatives and bring union and accord
among the beloved ones and harmony among the maid-servants


+P 185
of God; and that thou mayest become of the
myrtles of the Paradise of Oneness and of the trees
of the Reality of Singleness.
     Every flock of the sheep of God which is protected
under the shadow of the Divine Shepherd will not be
scattered, but when the sheep are dispersed from the
flock, they will necessarily be caught and torn by the
wolf.
     Therefore, it is incumbent upon you to flock together!
It is incumbent upon you to be united!  It is
incumbent upon you to expose yourselves to the fragrances
of God at every time and moment!
     Verily, I am with you when you turn unto God and
are attracted to the fragrances of God, and I pray for
confirmation, union, harmony and love in your behalf.
     Deliver my greetings and praise to the maid-servants
of God there.

O thou wonderful leaf of the Tree of the Love of God!
     All that thou hast written was perused.  It was read
from beginning to end, and it caused joy and fragrance.
But we write a brief but useful answer, on account of
the lack of leisure.  Engage thou in commemorating
God at every morn and turn unto the Horizon of
Mercifulness.
     Take some honey, recite "Ya Baha-ul-ABHA," and
eat a little thereof for several days.  For these thy prevailing
diseases are not on account of sins, but they are
to make thee detest this world and know that there
is no rest and composure in this temporal life.
     I beg of God that thou mayest find a cheerful life,
cause the increase of the longing of all present in the


+P 186

meetings of the maid-servants of the Merciful One and
bring joy and happiness to the handmaidens of God;
so that thou mayest diffuse the fragrances and chant
the manifest verses.  Supplication to God at morn
and eve is conducive to the joy of hearts, and
prayer cause spirituality and fragrance.  Thou shouldst
necessarily continue therein.
     I beg of God that the closed door may be opened
before the face of the friends and that they may be
enabled to visit the Holy Threshold.
     Trust thou in the divine grace and have hope in the
merciful gift.  If thou wishest for everlasting joy and
happiness, engage thou in delivering (teaching) the
Cause of God night and day, for the commemoration of
God attracts confirmation and assistance like unto a
magnet.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter was received and thy words produced effect
in the hearts.  For thy letter showed thy love for
the Glorious Lord, proved thy knowledge of His Highness,
the Merciful One, and indicated thy effort and
exertion in unifying the beloved ones and creating harmony
among the chosen ones.
     O thou esteemed (or dear) maid-servant of God!
All that thou hast looked upon -- even in the dominion of
Victoria, the Queen of England -- is but an image on
the water and a mirage of phantasms!  That which is
a reality and is eternal and everlasting is the love of
God, is the knowledge of His Highness, the Forgiver,
is the spread of the perspicuous religion of God, the


+P 187
uplifting of the Word of God, and the diffusion of
the lights of the guidance of God!
     I beg of God, that thou and thy revered husband
and thy affectionate father will be confirmed by the
gift of the Merciful One; and that thy brother will
also follow you, in order that he may, through the
gems and pearls of the guidance of God, wear a kingly
crown on his head.
     O thou favored maid-servant of God!  I give thee
the name Natekah (i. e., Speaker -- gifted with speech;
it can also be written &amp;Nategheh), in order that thou mayest
find an eloquent speech in teaching (the Truth);
that thou mayest kindle the lamp of light in those parts,
especially in Baltimore, and bestow joy and happiness
upon the hearts through the commemoration of
God.
     My good pleasure is in this, that thou shouldst devote
thy time wholly to teaching (the Truth), so that
thou mayest train the souls, illumine the eyes, and
make the ears hearing.

O thou bird who art warbling in the Garden of the
        Guidance of God!
     Verily, I read thy excellent and brilliant letter.
It showed how thou hast sought the fire of guidance
from the Sinaitic Tree, and art shining by the light of
faithfulness of the Supreme Concourse.
     Blessed art thou; again, blessed art thou!  Glad-tidings
be unto thee; again, glad-tidings be unto thee!
     Appreciate the worth of this peerless and choice
Pearl (of the Truth).  By the life of God, verily, this


+P 188
is the most splendid jewel which glitters on the crown
of glory, among all the people of the world.

O ye+F1 two doves, flying in the verdant Gardens of the
        Kingdom!
     Thank ye your Lord for that by reason of which He
hath guided you into the Path of Safety, led you unto
the Fountain of Life, turned your faces unto the Lord
of the evident Signs, and baptized you with the Water
of Life, and the everlasting spirit of safety, in this new
and glorious century.
     Your pictures came to the presence of the servant
of God, who is supplicating to His Kingdom that He
may cause to descend upon you the heavenly blessings.
He was rejoiced by seeing your likenesses, for his
spirit is attached to the Spirit.  And from the flowers,
which were enclosed in your note, he has smelled the
scent of the gardens of your hearts, which are ornamented
by the flowers of faith and assurance; and I ask
God to continue sending upon you the gifts of His merciful
benevolence at all times.

O thou who art attracted to the Bounty of El-ABHA!
     Verily, I have read thine excellent message, which
announced thy praise to thy Supreme Lord, and I have
understood thine effort and endeavor in spreading the
perfume of guidance and propagating the Supreme
Word!
     Verily, I implore God to keep thee and thy wife
steadfast in such service with which both of your faces
may shine in the Concourse of El-ABHA!

+P 189
     Indeed, this is the treasure of the Kingdom, which
(treasure) ceaseth not; and I beg of Him to cause
you (both) to be in no need of the false beauty of the
world and to be as two rising stars in the horizon of
existence!

O thou messenger in the command of God!
     Blessed art thou for guiding ........ unto the
Fountain of the Water of Life, caused him to enter
the Ark of Safety, demonstrated unto him the manifest
signs, and proved to him the elegant proofs.  May
God reward thee with the best of rewards, in the end
and the beginning.  Therefore, continue spreading the
fragrances of God in this new age, which dawns as
the sun with the lights of favors unto the horizon of
ages and centuries.***

O thou maid-servant of God!
     Be rejoiced at the mercy of God and be delighted by
the remembrance of thy Master!  Thank thou Him,
for He hath removed the veils from thy wight and
shown thee a Glorious Face!  Blessed art thou, as thou
hast sought martyrdom in the Cause of God!  Know
thou verily, He will strengthen thee to the service of
His Cause in His vineyard.

O thou who art set aglow with the Fire of the Love of
        God!
     Thy letter reached me and I noted its beautiful contents.
I ask God to augment thy faith, certainty, steadfastness
and firmness, that thus thou mayest be a cause


+P 190
for enkindling the fire of the love of God in the hearts
of the maid-servants of God.
     We sent thee a rosary, as thou didst so wish.  Mention
God+F1 with this and thus thou mayest be strengthened
in spirit and fragrance, in joy and love.
     Convey my greeting and praise to thy honorable
husband, Mr. ........, the beloved, the precious and
honored.

O thou who art advancing toward the Kingdom of
        God!
     I received thy letter and was informed of the content
of thy speech.
     Know thou, verily, Baha' was the Sun of Love and
Peace, who shone forth with the Light of Guidance and
was a Spirit of Life to all regions.  The signs of His
effulgence shall appear when the love of God shall influence
the hearts, just as the soul influenceth bodies.
The clouds of darkness shall be dispelled from the manifest
light of love and peace, and from the abundant
bounty of reconciliation and tranquillity.
     As to thee:  Do not look at thy weakness and impotence;
nay, look at the power of thy Lord, which
hath surrounded all regions.  The sea of forgiveness
hath moved and the waves of pardon and beneficence
have submerged the people of sin.  Be isolated from
the grades of self and desire, so that thou mayest succeed
in that which behooveth the service of the Kingdom
of God, and that thou mayest be healed from
every disease and sickness.


------------------------
1.  A rosary is generally used in connection with the daily mentioning of the
      Greatest Name.
+P 191
     As to the "white dove," it is the Holy Spirit.  It
shall flutter over thee and over the head of the beloved
of God.
     Verily I beseech God to assist thee with the spirit of
knowledge and enable thee to be good and benevolent
to all the people of religions.

O thou who art advancing toward the Divine
        Kingdom!
     What thou hast written was understood and noted.
Thou hast asked concerning the station of this servant.
The station of this servant is servitude to the Holy
Threshold (BAHA'O'LLAH) and I glory and honor in
this.  Abdul-Baha is the standard of the divine love,
the sign of the gift of God, the servant of the assemblage
of the merciful ones, the light of the meeting
of the spiritual ones.  He is the orb of peace and reconciliation
and the light of love in the world of humanity.
He is the herald of the Kingdom of the Merciful
One and the promulgator of the religion of rectitude
and security.  This is the station of this servant!  This
is the Truth!
     I hope through the divine grace that the brilliancy
of the love of God will pervade all regions, and that
he will remove warfare and strife from the world of
existence.  Then the human world will become expressive
of the unity of the merciful world, the inferior
world will become a clear and purified mirror reflecting
the Supreme Concourse, the East and West will embrace
each other like unto two longing ones and the
North and South will shake hands and clasp each other


+P 192
in the arms like unto two beloved ones.  This is the
station of Abdul-Baha.
     As to the light thou dost witness:  It is not an
earthly light (phenomenal); nay, rather, it is a heavenly
light.  It cannot be seen by the sight; nay, rather,
it is perceived by the insight.
     As to the resurrection of the body of Christ three
days subsequent to His departure:  This signified the
divine teachings and spiritual religion of His Holiness
Christ, which constitute His spiritual body, which is
living and perpetual forevermore.
     By the "three days" of His death is meant that after
the great martyrdom, the penetration of the divine
teachings and the spread of the spiritual law became
relaxed on account of the crucifixion of Christ.  For
the disciples were somewhat troubled by the violence
of divine tests.  But when they became firm, that
divine spirit resurrected and that body -- which signifies
the divine word -- arose.
     Likewise the address of the angels to the people of
Galilee, "That this Christ will return in the same way
and that He will descend from heaven," is a spiritual
address.  For when Christ appeared, He came from
heaven, although He was outwardly born from the
womb of Mary.  For He said:  "No man hath ascended
up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven."
     He said:  "I came down from heaven and likewise
will go to heaven."  By "heaven" is not meant this infinite
phenomenal space, but "heaven" signifies the
world of the divine kingdom which is the supreme station
and seat of the Sun of Truth.
     To be brief:  The mysteries of the Holy Books are


+P 193
many and require explanation and elucidation.  I hope
thine insight will be so opened that the divine mysteries
may become manifest and clear.
O thou candle of the love of God!
     I read what thou hast written.  Its meanings were
spiritual and its contents merciful.  It indicated (thy)
pure intention and expressed clear brilliancy.
     I beg of God that thou mayest become an associate
and partner of Abdul-Baha in servitude to the Holy
Threshold of Baha', that thou mayest praise me in my
pure servitude and summon all to the Most Great
Guidance.

O thou who art advancing toward God!
     What thou has written was perused.  Thou hast
written concerning the meeting of His Highness Christ
after the crucifixion and that some of the apostles perceived
Him but did not recognize Him; but that they
did recognize Him after the breaking of bread.
     Know thou that the Messianic Spirit and the outpouring
of the Holy Spirit is always manifest, but
capacity and ability (to receive it) is more in some
and less in others.  After the crucifixion the apostles
had not in the beginning the capacity and ability of
witnessing the Messianic reality.  For they were agitated.
But when they found firmness and steadfastness
their inner sight became opened, and they saw
the reality of the Messiah as manifest.  For the body
of Christ was crucified and vanished, but the Spirit of
Christ is always pouring upon the contingent world,


+P 194
and is manifest before the insight of the people of
assurance.
     O thou seeker of the kingdom of God!  If thou
wishest thy speech and utterance to take effect in the
hardened hearts, be thou severed from all attachment
to this world and turn unto the Kingdom of God.  Enkindle
the fire of the love of God in the heart with
such intensity that thou mayest become a flame of fire
and a luminous lamp of guidance.  At that time thy
speech will take effect within the hearts, through the
confirmation of the Holy Spirit.

O thou sincere servant of the Lord of the Kingdom!
     Thou art favored and accepted in the Threshold of
His Highness the Incomparable One, and art beloved
and praised in the presence of Abdul-Baha.  Thy services
in the divine kingdom are evident and registered
and the most eminent reward and the most great bounty
are destined and in store for thee.  The confirmation
which hath descended unto thee is conducive to unlimited
favor.  Therefore, be thou engaged in the glorification
of the Forgiving Lord.

O thou whose heart is filled with the Love of God!
     I was informed of thy longing for meeting (me) and
that thy breast is boiling with the love of God.  Blessed
are thou for this wish.
     O maid-servant of God!  Beseech thou God to be
filled with His love and make thy tongue fluent with
the glorification of God.
     Verily, I supplicate God to forgive thy father and
to submerge him in the sea of forgiveness and pardon.


+P 195
     Be not grieved at the death of that infant child, for
it is placed in trust for thee before thy Lord in His
great Kingdom.
     Verily God will bestow upon thee that whereby thy
heart shall be rejoiced and thy breast shall be dilated.
Verily thy Lord is compassionate and merciful!

O thou favored maid-servant in the Threshold of the
        Almighty!
     The letter which thou hast written was perused and
its contents were noted.  Thou hast written concerning
spiritual hearing and insight.  The insight (or inner
perception) is a correct sight, for it never blundereth.
But the outward sight doth err (or misjudgeth); it
seeth the mirage as water, considereth the revolving
flame as a circle, imagineth the images reflected in a
mirror as a reality and judgeth huge bodies as small
ones, from a remote distance.  There are many evidences
as to the blundering of the sight; but the insight
apprehendeth the reality and discovereth the mysteries.
     As to the difference between inspiration and imagination:
Inspiration is in conformity with the Divine
Texts, but imaginations do not conform therewith.  A
real, spiritual connection between the True One and
the servant is a luminous bounty which causeth an
ecstatic (or divine) flame, passion and attraction.
When this connection is secured (or realized) such an
ecstasy and happiness become manifest in the heart that
man doth fly away (with joy) and uttereth melody and
song.  Just as the soul bringeth the body in motion, so
that spiritual bounty and real connection likewise moveth
(or cheereth) the human soul.


+P 196
As to truthful dreams:  I beg of God that thy inner
eye (insight) may be so opened that thou mayest thyself
differentiate between truthful and untruthful
dreams.
     Treat thy friends and relatives in general with the
utmost kindness and love; (deal in like manner) even
with strangers (or outsiders).  Convey my great compassion
to the little maid-servant of God, .........
She must memorize and recite the following commune:

     &amp;O loving God!  I am a young child, a suppliant, a
captive.  Be Thou my refuge, my support, my protector.
I am in distress:  give me the means of tranquillity.
I am needy:  bestow upon me the treasure of
the Kingdom.  I am dead:  give me the Spirit of Life.
I am weak:  favor me with power and strength, so that
I may be a maid-servant in Thy Threshold, with perfect
purity and sanctity; sacrifice myself unto Thee, be
quit of myself and seek Thee, walk in the path of Thy
good pleasure, speak Thy secret and witness the signs
of Thy Oneness wherever I look.  O God!  Make
me ablaze, like unto the fire of Thy love, and make me
free from attachment to this mortal world, until I find
the peace of soul and the rest of conscience.
     &amp;Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty!  Thou art the
Hearer, the Seer!&amp;

O thou who art advancing toward God!
     Blessed art thou, for the lights of guidance have
shone forth upon thee and the bounty of the Supreme
Kingdom hath illumined thy heart.  The effect of the
Spirit will surely increase within hearts, so souls will


+P 197
grow in advancing toward the Kingdom, the wonderful
bounty shall appear from the invisible kingdom, the
hidden exalted world, and your powers and firmness
will increase in the Cause of God, the Lofty, the
Mighty.

O thou Godlike person and spiritual friend!
     Verily God hath, through His bounty and grace, removed
the covering from off thine eyes and inspired thee
the night in which the Morn of Guidance dawned and
the Holy Spirit breathed in the being of "The Exalted,
the Supreme"+F1 .  Ye went out+F2 , desirous to witness and
visit the Lord, and awaited the appearance of the Great
Bounty in that brilliant night.  Is there any evidence
greater than this to the discerning?  No, by my Beloved,
the ABHA!  This is a gift to which ye have
been assigned among mankind.  Thank ye God for this
bestowal in which the inspired ones glory in the kingdom
of heaven.
     As to thee, strengthen thou thy back to spread that
Spirit and diffuse that Light and arise to serve the Cause
of God in His vineyard, so that thou mayest be of the
first to call in the name of God and draw nearer
unto the Kingdom of thy Lord, the Glorious, the Supreme.
Truly, I say unto thee, if thou be steadfast
in this Cause and arise with all thy power to promote
the Word in those parts, and if thou render thine utmost
efforts in breathing the Spirit of Life into the
hearts of the righteous, thou wilt find thyself assisted

2.  The mother of the one to whom this Tablet was revealed was an Adventist,
      who, in 1844, expected to "meet the Lord in the air."  At that time
      the recipient was three months old.
+P 198
by the angels of heaven and the hosts of the Supreme
Concourse; thou wilt hoist the banner of peace and
the sounds of the trumpet will be heard in the tunes of
love and union throughout those countries; thou wilt
guide people (literally, souls) to the running water of
life and lead them to the field of knowledge; thou wilt
give them to drink the wine of assurance and quicken
them with the fragrances of the Merciful One; thou
wilt clothe them with the robes of bestowal and give
them to drink the wine of faithfulness in love for Baha',
so that they will be awakened from the sleep of selfish
desires and behold the signs of their Mighty Lord in
this exalted life.  This is better for thee than all the
glory and dominion of the world.
     As to thy coming at this time to the Blessed Spot
(Acca), this is not in accordance with the wisdom revealed
in the Tablets.  Send unto us some of the traces
of thy pen (writings) so that we may see it and pray
God to assist and render thee successful in everything.

O thou whose face is illumined with the Light of the
        Love of God!
     The answer already hath been delayed, but there is
no harm in that.  For, verily, my heart is gazing unto
thee, my love is constant and permanent for thee and
the fragrances of holiness are wafting (over thee) and
my spirit is pouring upon thee, and the spiritual communication
is extended between us.
     O maid-servant of God!  It is incumbent upon thee
to show forth the greatest steadfastness; it is incumbent
upon thee to stand the tests of the Lord!  Be


+P 199
thou firm in the love of thy Lord, the Clement, the
Merciful!***

O thou who art enkindled with the Fire of the Love
        of God!
     Thy letter was received and I was informed of the
contents.  It was a proof of truthfulness and sincerity
and an evidence of spiritual feelings.  Consider how
the radiance of the light of the Holy Spirit doth illumine
the court of the soul, that it bringeth about spiritual
discoveries and produceth merciful attachment!
The essential meeting is that spiritual attachment (or
union) and heartfelt feelings; when this gift becometh
manifest, heavenly bounties will be attained and hopes
shall be fulfilled.  It is the same as I have written:  Thou
shalt attain to visit Acca; but now a physical visit (or
presence) will lead to interference on the part of the
ignorant and cause the tumult and commotion of the
unwise.  For the present, satisfy thyself with a spiritual
union.  God willing, thy coming will be also brought
about afterward.
     Occupy thyself with the Kingdom as much as thou
canst and forget all else save the True One; in order
that thou mayest, day by day, find a new power in the
Cause of God and gain a great stability.

O thou who art advancing toward the Threshold of
        Mercifulness!
     Verily, I have read the expressions of thy longing
for the visit and thy craving to come to this Brilliant
Spot.  But the violators of the Covenant of God have
stirred up the dust of deception, and besides this, there


+P 200
are numerous obstacles and it is impossible for thee to
come in these times.  But verily, I pray my Lord to
make this success feasible unto thee in a future time.
There is for this a mature wisdom concealed from sight,
but it shall appear as clear as the sun in midday.
     As to thee, be rejoiced at the glad-tidings of thy
Lord and trust in His great gifts, the lights of which
have shone forth upon the horizons of hearts and souls,
and trust in the assistance of thy Master, and ask what
thou wishest of the gifts of thy Lord, the Unconstrained!
Draw nigh unto Him with a pure heart,
cheerful face, gazing eye and a joyful spirit and plunge
with thy whole being into the sea of the love of God
and forget all else save Him, so that thou mayest be
filled with such spiritual sentiments from the kingdom
of God, which will take the reins of desire from thy
hands and move thee with the power of thy Lord, just
as the wind moveth a mote in the open air as it willeth.
At that time we will draw unto each other in spirit, a
nearness which will be eternal, everlasting and endless.

O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!
     Verily, I considered the meanings of thy beautiful
words and found them as a peerless, brilliant pearl,
shining with a luster of the lights of the love of God.
God shall surely enable thee [to speak] in more eloquent
and wonderful words through a confirmation
from the Spirit of the gift of God.***
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily, the picture (photograph)
is an indication of what is in the heart of man.
There are faces which are rejoiced and brilliant like


+P 201
unto the garden of paradise and faces which are dusty
and dark and are covered with the dimness of fire.
     Verily I beg of God that He may strengthen thee in
whatever matter thou mayest undertake and unto which
thou mayest advance.
     O maid-servant of God!  Thy heart shall surely have
attractions and revelations through the power of the
Beauty of El-ABHA, which will be followed by glad-tidings
and signs, in every minute and instant.  Verily,
I reveal unto thee in spirit and address thee in heart,
a speech which will open unto thee the doors of mysteries
which are concealed behind veils.  When mirrors
become pure and the lights shine, the signs of the Sun
of Truth shall reflect therein with most wonderful
splendors.
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily, I have not forgotten
thee and will not forget thee.  Trust thou in the love
of Abdul-Baha, for verily, nothing equals it.
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily, the Household+F1
present unto thee greeting and praise, with all longing
and attraction.

O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!
     I pray to God that He may cause to descend upon
thee a heavenly blessing, quicken thy heart with the
Holy Spirit into an everlasting life and make thy heart
a source of merciful sentiments; so that thy breath
may become a quickener of the souls, thine attractions
may move the heart of the world, thy strong love may
attract the hearts of men, and that thine abundant affection
may become a mercy to mankind in the world


------------------------

+P 202
of existence.  Verily, my Lord is Powerful, Potent and
the Bestower!
     Be thou loving to every afflicted one, a dispeller of
sorrows to every grieved one, a refuge to every fearful
one, a heavenly food to every destitute one, a balm to
every wounded one, a consolation to dejected hearts,
a blessing to unfortunate souls, a treasure to every begging
one and a succor to every lamenting one -- so that
thou mayest be a banner of guidance and the essence
of piety among the maid-servants of thy Supreme Lord.
Verily, thy Lord is the Beneficent, the Gracious, the
Bestower!

O maid-servant of God!
     ***I beg of God that He may make [that
place] a center of merciful events and a point whereon
the lordly favors may fall; and that He may make thee
so ablaze with the fire of His love that the flame of the
love of God may pervade all those parts.

O thou dear maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter was received and a sweet odor wafted
from the rose-garden of its meanings.  Thou hast offered
thanks before the threshold of the One God, for
that thou hast stepped into the Court of the Manifestation
in such a blessed day and hast partaken a share and
portion from the bounties of the Pre-existent Beauty+F1 .
This mortal world is fickle and unstable like unto a
shifting shadow, and the human life is like unto a
mirage and a reflection on the water.  When thou lookest
at the result thou wilt consider the preliminaries as


------------------------
1.  BAHA'O'LLAH.
+P 203
important, otherwise, preliminaries without a result are
of no fruit or harm; they are pure fancy and sheer
darkness.  Therefore even a short duration of life is
sufficient.
     I beg of God that He may render thee successful
so that thou mayest find the result of the supernal life
from the temporal life and attain to the gift of the
heavenly food and be strengthened to serve the Cause
of God.

O thou who art esteemed in the Threshold of the
        Almighty!
     Praise thou God, for that thou hast found the Light
of Guidance, recognized the Lord of the Kingdom, art
engaged in the service of the Divine Garden and hast
guided a number of souls and led them to the Kingdom
of Existence.  When thou occupiest thyself with all
thy strength in service, thou wilt become a magnet of
attraction and cause every seeker to reach the presence
of the Desired One; thou wilt raise a great clamor in
the world and evince such an ecstasy and rapture that
will astonish the minds.
     Send my loving greeting to those souls whom thou
hast guided unto the divine kingdom and say unto them:
&amp;Ye must appreciate Miss ....... Move your tongues
in thanksgiving and be obliged for her great effort; for
she gave you to drink the wine of guidance from the
cup of the love of God and led you to the kingdom of
lights.  Were you to thank her for many years as a
reward for this guidance, ye will not be able to repay
your obligation for this gift.&amp;


+P 204
     Thou hast written concerning the Impersonality of
the Divinity.  Personality is in the Manifestation of the
Divinity, not in the Essence of the Divinity.  The reality
of the divine world is purified and sanctified from
limits and restriction.  But the pure Mirror, which is
the Manifestor of the Sun of Truth and in which
the Sun of Truth is manifest in appearance --
that mirror is restricted, not the lights.  The soul
pervadeth throughout the whole body, and its commands
are effective in all the parts and limbs of man.
Notwithstanding its utmost sanctification (or abstraction)
this soul is manifest and evident in all its grades,
in this material form.  By seeing God is meant beholding
the Manifestation of Himself; for witnessing the
sun in its entire splendor, in a clear glassy surface, is
identical with witnessing the essence of the sun itself.
     When the souls of the sincere depart (from this
body), then their unreal vision (i. e., seeing) is changed
into a vision of reality.  Even as man, when in the
age of babyhood and imperfection, though he seeth
things, yet that vision is superficial and external.  But
when he reacheth the world (or age) of perfection and
becometh endowed with reasoning faculty and (the
power of) discrimination and comprehension, then that
vision of his is a vision (i. e., seeing) of reality+F1 and
not the unreality.
     It is evident that the divine nearness is an unlimited
nearness, be it in this world or the next one.
This is a nearness which is sanctified from the comprehension
of the minds.  The more a man seeketh light
from the Sun of Truth, the nearer he will draw.  For


------------------------
1.  Insight.
+P 205
instance, a clear body is near unto the sun, and a black
stone is far from the sun.  This nearness dependeth upon
clearness, purity and perfection and that remoteness
is due to density, dullness (or obscurity) and
imperfection.
     As to the question whether the souls will recognize
each other in the spiritual world:  This (fact) is certain;
for the Kingdom is the world of vision (i. e.,
things are visible in it), where all the concealed realities
will become disclosed.  How much more the well-known
souls will become manifest.  The mysteries of which
man is heedless in this earthly world, those will he
discover in the heavenly world, and there will he be
informed of the secret of truth; how much more will
he recognize or discover persons with whom he hath
been associated.  Undoubtedly, the holy souls who find
a pure eye and are favored with insight will, in the
kingdom of lights, be acquainted with all mysteries, and
will seek the bounty of witnessing the reality of every
great soul.  Even they will manifestly behold the
Beauty of God in that world.  Likewise will they find
all the friends of God, both those of the former and
recent times, present in the heavenly assemblage.
     As to the difference and distinction between Lazarus
and that "rich man":  The first was spiritual, while
the second was material.  One was in the highest degree
of knowledge and the other in the lowest depths of
ignorance.  The difference and distinction will naturally
become realized between all men after their departure
from this mortal world.  But this (distinction)
is not in respect to place, but it is in respect to the soul
and conscience.  For the Kingdom of God is sanctified


+P 206
(or free) from time and place; it is another world and
another universe.  But the holy souls are promised
the gift of intercession.  And know thou for a certainty,
that in the divine worlds, the spiritual beloved ones
(believers) will recognize each other, and will seek
union (with each other), but a spiritual union.  Likewise,
a love that one may have entertained for any one
will not be forgotten in the world of the Kingdom.
Likewise, thou wilt not forget (there) the life that
thou hast had in the material world.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Hold fast to the
Most Strong Handle+F1 and be thoroughly attracted to
the Kingdom of ABHA, until thou mayest at every instant
find a new confirmation and attain to a wonderful
gift and become a cause for the guidance of souls.

O thou who hast attained to Truth!
     I beg of God that the divine light which is spoken
of in the Twelfth Chapter of John may shed its rays
upon thee forever, so that thou mayest always be in
light.  The life of man in this world is short and will
soon drawn to an end.  Consequently one must appreciate
(or count as gain) every breath (or moment) of
his life and endeavor in that which is conducive to eternal
glory.
     Thou hast written concerning the shining assembly
of Washington (D. C.):  This caused me great joy, for
that assemblage is a rose-garden of mysteries and very
sweet fragrances of being inhaled from it.  I hope
that through the sincerity of heart of the friends and
maid-servants of God, that assembly will continue and


------------------------
1.  The Manifestation of God.
+P 207
be extended (or grow) day by day, will increase in
luminosity every moment and that the members of that
assembly will make extraordinary progress in the Divine
Threshold.
     If the health and well-being of the body be expended
in the path of the Kingdom, this is very acceptable and
praiseworthy; and if it is expended to the benefit of
the human world in general -- even though it be to their
material (or bodily) benefit and be a means of doing
good -- that is also acceptable.  But if the health and
welfare of man be spent in sensual desires, in a life
on the animal plane, and in devilish pursuits -- then disease
is better than such health; nay, death itself is
preferable to such a life.  If thou art desirous of health,
wish thou health for serving the Kingdom.  I hope
thou mayest attain a perfect insight, an inflexible resolution,
a complete health and spiritual and physical
strength in order that thou mayest drink from the
fountain of eternal life and be assisted by the spirit
of divine confirmation.
     Say unto ........:  &amp;Thou art sowing pure seeds,
but that soil (wherein the seeds fall) is full of useless
plants, weeds and rubbish.  Therefore the seeds are
wasted.  Consequently, come and sow those seeds in a
pure, sweet and fertile soil, in order that they may
vegetate, become fresh and verdant and form into heaps
on heaps of harvest.&amp;
     Send my greeting to ........ and say unto her:
&amp;The sun is in the utmost effulgence but the surface
turned toward it must be a mirror; the clearer and purer
it is, the more lights shall be reflected therein.&amp;
     Send my loving greeting to his honor ........ and


+P 208
say unto him:  &amp;Do not miss the opportunity.  Now
in the springtime and the bounty of heaven is pouring
on earth and the fields and rose-gardens are in growth
and development.  Exert thyself as much as thou canst,
in order that through this everlasting bounty and the
sprinklings of the clouds of the divine gift, thou mayest
grow and thrive like unto a fruitful tree, with the
utmost freshness and purity.&amp;
     That matter (or substance) which is the cause of
the moderation and perfection of the body is that perfect
moderate temperament which is produced by the
organization and admixture of constituent elements;
that matter (or substance) is material (or physical) not
spiritual.  But reason, which comprehends (or detects)
the realities of things, is a spiritual reality, not physical
(or material).  Therefore the animal is deprived of
reason, and it (reason) is specialized to mankind.  The
animal feeleth realities which are perceptible to the
senses, but man perceiveth intellectual realities (or
things perceptible to reason).  Consequently, it hath
become evident that reason is a spiritual faculty, not
physical (or material).
     The Holy Land is not tranquil in these days+F1 .  Consequently,
let thy presence (or coming) in the Holy
Land depend on some other time.  Endeavor night and
day in serving the Cause of God; this service is real
visit, and this is meeting, itself.
     Deliver my greeting to each one of the friends of
God and maid-servants of the Merciful with the utmost
love.
     That blessed name which thou hast asked to remain


------------------------
1.  Revealed in 1905.
+P 209
with thee forever and become the cause of spiritual
progress -- the name is "Aseyeh," which is the name
of the mother of Abdul-Baha.  I give the blessed name
to thee.  Be therefore in the utmost joy and happiness,
and be engaged in all gladness and attraction (or
ecstasy) for thou hast become the object of such a
favor.

O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!
     I know how great a love thou hast!  Thou art like
unto a blooming rose in the rose-garden of the love of
God and thou art like unto a fruitful tree on the bank
of the stream of knowledge of God.  I beg of God
that thou mayest always enjoy spiritual nearness and
ever be rejoiced.  Reveal thou (or teach thou) the
Word of God; be not grieved at the people's lack of
hearing.  Do thou sow the seed, and God will make it
grow and the cloud (or rain) of mercy will develop it.
     Convey greeting to the beloved of God and to the
maid-servants of the Merciful.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     Thy detailed letter was perused.  On account of the
multitude of occupations and work, a brief answer is
written.  This brief Tablet is most significant.  Thou
art forever in my memory and in reality thou art present.
Thou art never forgotten!
     Blessed is thy state that thou art firm in the Covenant
and steadfast in the Cause of God.  Rest thou
assured of the bounty and providence of the Heavenly
Lord.  Be thou rejoiced!  Be thou a merciful being!
Be thou illumined!  Associate with all the maid-servants


+P 210
of the Merciful with utmost love and kindness,
also with other women of the world.
     I have prayed for the outpouring of the blessing
upon those souls for whom thou hast asked supplication
of the Holy Spirit (in their behalf).  I hope that they
may become quickened through the breeze of life wafting
from the garden of immortality and be gladdened
with utmost happiness and joy.  But the capacity is necessary
for the descent of rain, and preparation of
soil is of great importance.  The heavenly outpouring
will develop from the pure ground roses and hyacinths.
We also hope that such things will appear from them.
     Convey my respectful greeting to the attracted maid-servant
of God .........  I am always engaged in
her remembrance, beseeching for her merciful gifts
from the Heavenly Father.  Utmost bounty is extended
toward her.
     Exert thyself in studying the Persian language in
order that with perfect eloquence and fluency thou mayest
talk, read and write.
     Know thou the value of ........ for she hath an
illumined heart and a soul gladdened with the love of
God.  She hath presented herself at this Blessed Spot,
hearing the utterances of Abdul-Baha with her own
ears.  Blessed is she, and again, blessed is she!

O thou dear maid-servant of God!
     The letter that thou hast written in Persian was
highly appreciated.  I have read it from beginning to
end.  It contained wonderful thoughts.
     Convey my longing greetings to all the friends in
Washington (D. C.).  Also present my respectful greetings

to the maid-servants of the Merciful.  Present my
respectful salutations to the maid-servant of God, the
Eternal, the Protector, Mrs. ........, for she is near
and dear in the Threshold of Oneness.  I beseech God
that she may be confirmed and assisted in all stations
and attain the heavenly confirmations.

O thou who art attracted to the Kingdom of God!
     The letter written by you *** was received.  Its
contents became evident.  The expressions (of thy
letter) evinced utmost attraction and caused joy and
fragrance.
     Thou hast asked for permission to come to our presence
with his honor .........  I am also longing
greatly after the meeting of the friends.  If there was
no obstacle, it would be very acceptable, but in these
days, thy presence (in this land+F1 ) is not according to
wisdom.  Besides this, thou must be engaged in the
service of the Kingdom in those parts.  Also, the presence
of his honor+F2 ........ is of utmost necessity in
those parts, for we henceforth forward all the Tablets
to him for translation, that he may send to the believers.
If he should move, this work would be neglected.
Therefore now thou must wait until some happy occasion
will bring this about later on.
     Also, thou hast written concerning the meeting with
the minister of Persia.  This is very acceptable.  The
believers of God must render utmost consideration toward
Persian ministers and officials.
     Also convey respectful greetings from Abdul-Baha
to all the friends of God.

O thou maid-servant of the Blessed Perfection!
     Thy letter was received.  It was written in Persian.
I was very much pleased.  I hope thou wilt memorize
all the poetry of the Blessed Perfection and chant with
wonderful melody in the assemblages and gatherings.
These verses will soon be translated into English poetical
form and then this Divine Song will rise from
those lands and reach the ABHA Kingdom in utmost
joy and happiness.
     Thou hast written that ........ is giving lessons
of [the Book of] Ighan+F1 ; this news brought me real
joy.
     Thou hast written that ........ hath started upon
her trips again, to be engaged in the service of the
Kingdom.  In reality she is attracted and will bear
every calamity and trial in the path of the Blessed Perfection
and this very thing will be conducive to her
spiritual development.
     O thou attracted one!  If thou art able, be thou engaged
in the promotion of the Cause of God, either
with ........ or alone.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Whatever thou dost
and upon whatever occasion thou showest any effort,
the end will prove fruitless except in teaching the Cause
of God and in serving the divine Kingdom.
     If the means of thy travel to these parts+F2 be brought
about, it is better to come alone, because ........
must remain in those parts and be engaged in the
service.  The confirmation of the Holy Spirit will
descend upon him uninterruptedly.

O thou attracted maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter *** was received and its contents produced
happiness and joy, for it evinced affinity and
love among the maid-servants of the Merciful One
gathering in the assemblages and commemorating the
name of the True One. ***
     Convey my respectful greeting to ........ and
announce to her:  &amp;This period is a blessed period; endeavor
that thou mayest live according to the requirements
of this Glorious Age.&amp;
     Convey my greeting to ........ and say:  &amp;The

     Announce thou to ........:  &amp;At a time when the
light of the Sun of Truth hath penetrated into all those
regions, then the spiritual oneness will become realized.
Therefore, make thou an effort that the souls may become
attracted with the light of the Kingdom and the
shining heavenly lamp become ignited in thy house.  I
beseech God that thou mayest become a center of merciful
feelings in those regions and seek after the everlasting
glory.&amp;
     I prayed for those whose names thou hast mentioned
in thy letter, asking from God confirmation and assistance
in their behalf.  Say to the beloved maid-servant
of God, ........, to write the book which she had
in mind.


+P 214
O thou favored maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter was received.  Thou hast expressed joy
on account of thy visit to the friends of Chicago.
I also yearn to visit them.  At the time when ye were
assembled in the house of Mrs. ........, Abdul-Baha
was also present with heart and soul.
     I hope that hou mayest become an incarnation of
love and embodiment of spirit and personficiation of
kindness and that thou mayest progress day by day in
the spiritual attributes through the Beauty of ABHA.
     Convey respectful greeting on my behalf to the dear
and kind maid-servant of God, the assured leaf, .......
Behold thou how attracted and enkindled she is!  Love
and have great consideration for the attracted maid-servant
of God, .........  Exercise the utmost affection
and kindness toward the dear maid-servant of
God, .........
     O thou maid-servant of God!  No one hath any way
to the Reality of Deity except through the Instrumentality
of the Manifestation.  To suppose so is a
theory and not a fact.
     Convey greeting on my behalf to ........... and
say:  &amp;If thou art desiring the refulgent light, add to
thy love for God.  If thou art begging for the breaths
of the Holy Spirit, become thou engaged in the commemoration
of the Beauty of ABHA.  If thou art seeking
everlasting glory, choose humility in the path of
the True One.  If thou art aspiring to eternal life, sacrifice
thy soul in the way of God.&amp;
     Announce my love and affection to the attracted
maid-servant ......... and say:  &amp;Every eye which
is weeping for the sake of the love of God is blessed;


+P 215
every ear which is hearing the divine call is blessed.
Then may thine eyes flow with the tears of joy because
of the coruscation of the fire of the heart and may thy
soul and thy spirit be attracted to the Beauty of the
Beloved.&amp;
     Show forth kindness on my behalf to the maid-servants
of the Merciful whom thou hast mentioned by
name in thy letter and impart to them the glad-tidings
of the Kingdom.
     Give especial greeting to ........... and say:
&amp;There lie glorious meanings in the word "Allaho-ABHA.+F1
I hope thou wilt discover those significances.&amp;

O thou spiritual maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter was received and its contents became
known.  God willing, the vision will become actualized.
Announce thou to ........:  "Become thou a new
creation and be thou patient and forbearing.  Be baptized
by the fire of the love of God and by the spirit
of the knowledge of God, in order that thou mayest
become characterized by the spiritual attributes; attain
to the nature of that kind Beloved; be so enkindled that
thou mayest illumine a region, become a sign of guidance
and an ensign of the love of God."
     O thou maid-servant of God!  I know that thou hast
spiritual love for Abdul-Baha and this is confirmed and
beyond doubt.
     Say to ........:  &amp;Leave thou the "New Thought"
and seek after the New Kingdom.  The "New
Thought" is a part of the New Kingdom.  When thou
hast found the latter, thou hast found the former; nay
rather, thou hast found all things.&amp;

1.  The Greatest Name.
+P 216
O thou attracted maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter was received.  Thou hast manifested
cheerfulness and gladness on account of the news of
my happiness.  Abdul-Baha hath the glad-tidings of the
Kingdom of ABHA.  His happiness hath no sorrow in
its trail and His life is not followed by any death.  To
him, prison is a court; to him, a tomb is a spacious palace;
to him, a well is the apex of heaven; and to him,
manacles and chains are the throne of ether.
     If at times he becometh sad, it is not on account of
affliction and adversities, but that grief is produced from
a word or an act which is against the exhortations and
behests of the Blessed Perfection.
     For instance:  I hope that the believers of God may
become the cause of the unity and agreement of the human
realm, and suffer other nations and communities
of the world to enter under the shade of the Canopy of
Oneness.  Now, when the news reacheth me that the
slightest differences have crept in among the believers
of God, I become sad and heartbroken.
     The point is this:  Afflictions and hardships, ordeals
or trials, do not make me weak or faint, nor do they in
the slightest degree make me sad or unhappy.
     Thou hast written regarding the feast *** I became
very happy therefrom.  Convey greeting on
my behalf to the favored maid-servant of God,
......... and say:  &amp;On that night thy house was
the nest and the shelter of the birds of God.  The divine
melodies and the celestial lyres made that place a
feast of heaven and an assembly of the Kingdom.
Abdul-Baha was present there in heart and soul and
was joyful and happy.  Thank thou God.&amp;


+P 217
     Announce salutation to Mrs. ......... and say:
&amp;A thousand times, Well done! -- that thou art working
in the vineyard of the Kingdom and hast arisen to faithfulness
and art engaged in the service of His Highness,
the Almighty!  Thou art helping the helpless ones and
art comforting those who are instance.&amp;
     Convey respectful greeting to Mrs. ......... and
say:  &amp;May thy joy be unending and thy comfort and
happiness everlasting!  May thy life be eternal and the
light of thy thought the heavenly glad-tidings.&amp;
     Convey greeting and kindness to the maid-servant of
God, ........, and say:  &amp;If thou art desiring an
illumined house, enkindle thou therein the lamp of the
love of God; and if thou art seeking after a heavenly
palace, make thy house the gathering place of the believers
of the Merciful One; so that the splendors of
the Sun of Truth may cast therein rays spiritual and the
harmony of holiness ascend to the Kingdom of ABHA.&amp;
     Say to the maid-servant of God!  The feast given by
Mrs. ......... became highly acceptable and the respected
personages who served in that feast, as did
........., Mr. ........., Mrs. ......... and
Mrs. ........., are in reality worthy of all praise.
They were engaged in the duty and the work of Abdul-Baha
and have arisen to serve the believers of God.
     Convey my greeting to his honor ......... and
say:  &amp;Thou didst deliver a wonderful talk on that
night.  Well done!  Well done!  That talk was given


+P 218
in the West yet Abdul-Baha became happy from it in
the East.&amp;
     I congratulate and compliment the maid-servant of
God, ........, in her firmness and steadfastness in
the Cause of God.  Truly, I say, she is illumined, spiritual,
heavenly and celestial.  She taketh care of the
strangers among the friends and serveth and praiseth
the servants of God.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Do not be slow in the
study of the Persian language and be thou engaged in
the service.

O thou who art firm in the Covenant!
     Thy letter was received.  Thou hast written regarding
thy trip to the Holy Land.  God willing, this desire
of thine will be realized.
     The name Aseyeh is acceptable in the Threshold of
Oneness, for the daughter of Pharaoh had this name,
who, when (Moses) the Light of Guidance dawned,
became confirmed by the Merciful One, left the court
of Pharaoh with its grandeur and sovereignty and became
perfumed with the fragrances of holiness.  Then
she assisted in the service of His Holiness (Moses) --
upon him be peace!  Also, Aseyeh was the name of my
mother.
     Thou hast written that thou lovest the Bible.  Undoubtedly,
the friends and the maid-servants of the
Merciful should know the value of the Bible, for they
are the ones who have discovered its real significances
and have become cognizant of the hidden mystery of
the Holy Book.***


+P 219
     Deliver my greeting to ......... and say:  &amp;I
supplicate God that thou mayest gladden and rejoice
the heart of ......... with the melody of the Kingdom,
rend asunder the veil of her concealment, enlighten
her face with the light of the Most Great Guidance
and make her eyes see and her ears hear.&amp;
     Say on my behalf to the maid-servant of God, ........,
&amp;The end of every (material) work is without
result, because it is perishable and inconstant, but the
first (real) work is attraction to the fragrance of God,
enkindlement with the fire of the love of God, reading
the verses of Unity and beholding the lights from the
Dawning-place of Mystery.+F1  After that cometh the training
of the soul, purification of character and service to
humanity.  If thou art able to accomplish any one of
these, the result is eternal and the fruit everlasting.&amp;
     Thou hast written regarding thy coming to the Holy
Land; do not hasten, for then thou mayest travel with
comfort.  It would be better not to resign from the
school, nay rather, avail thyself of the opportunity
during vacation time which is in the season of summer,
and present thyself in this land; because thy presence
in that school is fruitful.  Thou shalt finally study the
Persian language.***

O thou whose breast is dilated with the Fragrances
        of God!
     I received thy letter which showed thine advance toward
the Kingdom of God.
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily, the weakness of
body and its strength do neither harm nor benefit; nay,


------------------------
1.  i. e., as the sun rises out of the darkness.
+P 220
rather the spirit must be strong through the breath of
the Holy Spirit, at this time, so that it may apprehend
the consummate wisdom which is deposited in this great
age.  I beg of God that He may increase joy and
fragrance in thy spirit, give thee power and strength,
and that He may help thee at every moment in faith
and assurance.  Verily my Lord is powerful in all
things!  Trust thou in the grace of thy Master and ask
that which thou wishest from His Name, the Clement,
the Merciful.

O thou who art rejoiced at the Kingdom of God!
     The letter indicating thy great wish to be a maid-servant
of the Cause of God in His wonderful and excellent
vineyard, was received.
     Thank thou God that He hath removed the veil and
hath manifested unto thee the reality of things until
thou hast apprehended that, verily, the world and all
of its concerns are but confused dreams and of
non-duration.
     Verily I beg of God to grant thy greatest wishes and
bestow upon thee the good of this and the world to
come.

O thou herald of the Kingdom!
     Thou wast not alone in the trip that thou didst undertake
in various places.  The spirit and soul of
Abdul-Baha was with thee.  Although thou hast been
afflicted with many and severe persecutions, hast heard
derision, scorn and contempt and observed the opposition
of the heedless ones, yet this is conducive to thy
glory, that thou hast been made a target for the arrow


+P 221

of opposition in the Path of God and hast drunk the
cup of affliction.  Consider this, how many a calamity
was submitted to by those sanctified souls in bygone
ages and to how many sufferings they were resigned!
Thou also must endure dire oppression and ordeals in
the Path of ABHA and maintain the feet of steadfastness
and firmness.  Then thou shalt behold the confirmation
of God surrounding thee.  Rejoice thou and be
happy that thou hast attained to this station and walked
in the footsteps of the holy souls.
     Announce on my behalf longing greeting to Mr. ........
and say, &amp;The melody of the Kingdom is
that which hath caused the motion of the universe; the
musk-diffusing fragrance of the rose-garden of God is
that which hath perfumed the nostrils; and the reflection
of the Sun of Truth is that which hath illumined
the whole earth.  Now is the beginning of illumination!
Therefore, the people of darkness imagine that they
can oppose (this Revelation); yet, ere long they shall
find themselves in loss and consternation!  They shall
observe that the power of the Word of God hath subdued
East and West.  Be thou not sad and dispirited
on account of the opposition of the heedless ones.  Soon
they shall regret sorely.  Reflect thou how the Pharisees
persecuted and looked down in contempt upon His
Holiness the Christ.  The result was that His lamp became
ignited, His light began to shine and His followers
sparkled like unto the stars from the horizon of
existence; and the consequence to the Pharisees was the
pangs of remorse and regrets.&amp;
     Convey, also, greeting to the maid-servant of God,
Mrs. ........ and say, &amp;Thy house is the nest and


+P 222
the shelter of this heavenly bird.  Undoubtedly, thou
must enkindle the lights of the Kingdom therein.&amp;
     Likewise convey respectful greeting on my behalf to
Mrs. ........ and say, &amp;I ask God that thy house
may become the gathering-place of the spiritual ones
and the assembly of the godly ones; that the light of
Truth may shine therein and make it brilliant and
resplendent.&amp;
     Also convey longing greeting to Mr. ........ and
say, &amp;Those souls who, in the time of His Highness
Christ, turned their faces toward the Kingdom and
quaffed the wine of guidance from the cup of the Word
of God, had their troubles changed into everlasting
bliss.  No matter how much they heard the rebuke of
the heedless ones, observed the censure of the relatives,
were afflicted with the injury of the oppressors and
thrown into abjection, yet that ignominy finally became
eternal glory.  Thou must show the utmost love and
kindness towards the heedless ones and the oppressors
and ask from God forgiveness and pardon for them, for
they are ignorant.  If they understood, they would not
oppress; nay, rather would they arise (to serve the
Cause) with faithfulness.&amp;
     Announce, also, respectful greeting from me to Mrs. ........
and Mrs. ........ and say, &amp;The sons of
the Kingdom are scattered throughout the whole world,
but the ignorant Pharisees have arisen with the utmost
hatred instigating persecutions.  They imagine that
persecution and suffering will hinder the promulgation
of the Cause; whereas no rampart is able to obstruct the
descent of the waves of the Most Great Sea; no veil can
conceal the rays of the Sun of Truth; no wall can stay


+P 223
the wafting of the Divine Breeze; and no power is able
to resist the Spirit of God.  Be ye not sad nor dejected
on account of the disturbance and uproar of the people
of desire and passion.  Ere long the symphony of the
Kingdom shall silence all the other noises.  Rest ye assured
and illumine your house with the lights of divine
commemoration.&amp;
     Give my greeting to Mr. ........ and announce
to him, &amp;Caiaphas and Annas were the colossal pillars
of the Mosaic Dispensation in the day of His Highness
the Spirit; but as they did not acknowledge the
Word of God, they fell from the apex of glory to the
bottom of the pit of the greatest abasement.  But Peter
was a catcher of fish; as he turned his face toward
the Word of God, the fame of his imperishable, deathless
and immortal glory encircled East and West; and
he found in the sovereignty of the Kingdom, eternal
and everlasting majesty.  It is the same in these days.&amp;

O thou who art attracted to the Kingdom of God!
     Thy letter was read with the utmost attention.  The
poetry was beautiful.
     Praise be to God, thou art severed from all else save
the Heavenly Father.  Thou hast been of the earth --
thou art now of the Kingdom.  Thou hast been of the
world -- thou art now of the Realm of Might.  Thou
art spreading the divine Teachings.  Thank thou God,
thou art bearing trials in the path of the Kingdom and
art enduring persecutions and sufferings.  These afflictions
are conducive to the spiritual development and the
descent of the Holy Spirit.
     O thou dear maid-servant of God!  I supplicate God


+P 224
that He suffer thee to become a herald of the Kingdom
in all those places, so that thou mayest proclaim the
glad-tidings of the Lord of Hosts.

O thou beloved and benevolent daughter of the Kingdom
        of God!
     The letter which thou hast written was received.  I
read it with the utmost love; thy services became
known and thy forbearance in the afflictions became
evident and manifest.  Happy is thy condition, for
thou art spending thy days in heralding the Kingdom
and art crying, "O ye concourse of men!  Make ye
straight the path; walk ye in the direct road!"  Thou
hast abandoned ease and accepted thousands of hardships
and traveled for the purpose of promoting the
Word of God.
     Convey on my behalf love to Mrs. ........ and
say, &amp;Praise be to God, thou art set aglow with the fire
of the Love of God and hast arisen in the service of
the Cause of God.&amp;
     Announce my affection to the maid-servant, .......
and say, &amp;Thank thou God that thou hast become related
to the Kingdom and art an object of the favors
of the Lord of Might.&amp;
     Gladden the heart of Mrs. ........ by the divine
glad-tidings and say, &amp;Be thou like unto a bird and
unweariedly soar upward until thou reachest the Supreme
Apex.&amp;
     Say thou to Mr. ........, &amp;When engaged in useless
service the end is loss within loss.  Therefore, serve
thou the Lord of the Kingdom, which in the end is
profit within profit.&amp;


+P 225
     Announce my respectful greeting to Mrs. ........
and her daughter and say, &amp;Thank ye God that ye
have illumined faces with the light of Guidance and ye
have perfumed the nostrils with the holy fragrances of
the rose-garden of the Kingdom of ABHA.&amp;
     Proclaim the glad-tidings of the bounty of the Almighty
to Mrs. ........ and deliver my respectful
greeting to Mrs. ........ and say, &amp;In the churches
turn thy face toward the Kingdom of ABHA and supplicate
the help of the Holy Spirit, and, with a detached
heart, begin to talk.&amp;
     Convey respectful greeting to Mr. and Mrs. .........
and say, &amp;Be ye thankful to God that your house
became the nest of the birds of the divine garden and
the shelter of the flocks of heaven.  They sit together,
read the holy Tablets, are engage din the commemoration
of the True One and strive and endeavor to promote
the Word of God.&amp;
     O thou maid-servant of God, Mrs. ..........!
Regarding the star with five points, thou hast made an
excellent comparison.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  If it is possible,
change the meeting of every nineteen days into a feast.
***
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Those fishes which
thou hast seen in the vision are the souls who are swimming
in the sea of this nether world.  God willing, thou
wilt bring them out of the nether world, with the net
of the love of God, into the immensity of the kingdom.
Those brilliant stars which thou hast beheld are the
children of the Kingdom.  That brilliant crescent is
the Cause of God.  The appearance of His Highness


+P 226
Christ and His white robe and resplendent light in His
blessed face is the proof of the power and the promulgation
of the Word of God in America.
     Therefore, it is the same thing which I said:  "The
night is drawing nigh and then no one can work."
Consequently, one must hasten to perform something
and show forth exertion.

     +F1 Thy letter was received.  It became conducive to
happiness.  Up to the present thou hast been serving in
the Kingdom of God and hast been assisted.  I hope
that, in the future, thou wilt become assisted more and
serve more.  Praise be to God!  Thou art watched by
the glances of Providence and art encircled with endless
bounties.  I hope that, day by day, thou mayest
step further, become characterized with a godlike nature
and disposition, manner and morals, in order that
thou mayest become the cause of the guidance of many
souls and the instrument for the illumination of a
region.

O thou beloved maid-servant of God!
     The letter, which thou hast forwarded through Mrs. ........
was received.  Thank thou God that thou
art assisted in the thralldom of His Threshold, art favored
in the Kingdom, art heralding the Name of the
True One, art speaking of divine praises, art guiding
the souls to the Sun of Truth, art quickening the dead
with the breaths of the Holy Spirit and art endeavoring
with heart and soul to spread the Cause.
     Thou hast Mrs. ........ as thy partner and sharer,

+P 227
co-operating with each other to serve, and hast lied in
her house.
     Show thou forth love to Mrs. ........ and convey
to her greetings on my behalf.  Associate with her and
seek her companionship as far as possible, for it is conducive
to the development of you both.

O thou who art advancing toward God!
     Verily, I received thy letter, which showed that thou
hast turned unto the Kingdom of God and advanced toward
the Beauty of El-ABHA.
     Verily, thy Lord hath chosen thee for His love,
elected thee for His knowledge and selected thee for entering
the Paradise of El-ABHA, so that thou mayest
attain to the mightiest bliss and greatest honor:  It is
no other than the Light which is shining upon hearts
and sights and the Spirit which is thrilling and flowing
within veins and nerves!
     Verily, thou hast attained thereto, for thou hast acknowledged
the Oneness of God and His Singleness, and
turned unto His Face, the lights of which are shining
from the horizon of the unseen, upon all regions!

O thou who art attracted to the Call of the Kingdom!
     Thy letter was presented and I was informed of thy
expression.  And it was glorious proof of thine abundant
reliance upon the Kingdom of thy Lord and of
thine excessive love for thy great Master.
     Know thou, verily, the Kingdom is a magnet of the
divine world, and it attracteth the iron of pure hearts
which are capable of the bounties of the Lord of
Might.  Blessed art thou, for thou hast turned unto


+P 228
the Lord of Heaven, thy heart hath relied upon the
light of guidance, thou hast advanced toward the center
of righteousness, and thy spirit is cheered by the bounty
of the Supreme Concourse.
     Verily, I beseech God to strengthen thee with the
Most Great Power, so that the Spirit may pour upon
thee the teachings of the Beauty of El-ABHA, and to
baptize thee with the water of life, the fire of the love
of God and with the spirit of confirmation among the
maid-servants.
     O maid-servant of God!  It is incumbent upon thee
to supplicate to thy Lord, to seek His nearness with thy
heart, to be submissive and humble before His maid-servants
and to serve His great vineyard.
     Forsake the mortal grades (i. e., things of the
world) and be engaged in praising thy Lord; so that
His Holy Spirit may assist thee; may make thee a sign
of faith and illumine thy heart with the light of assurance,
and that thou mayest become a sign of peace, a
servant of reconciliation, love and security.  Verily, my
Merciful Lord is gracious under all aspects!
     As to thy question concerning Christ:  Know thou,
He was perfect in respect to spirit as well as body.
His material (body) was a perfect body in every respect;
none of His material conditions were imperfect
at all, inasmuch as imperfection is contrary to perfection.
His heavenly condition was also a perfect
one, comprising all the divine perfections.  Reflect thou
upon these words, so that the door of knowledge may
be opened before thy face.
     Verily, I beseech God to strengthen the assured


+P 229
leaves (or women) whom thou hast mentioned in thy
letter, under all grades, aspects and circumstances.

O thou who art turning unto the Kingdom of God!
     Thy letter came and I was informed of its wonderful
contents.  Know thou, verily, all the doors are closed
except the door of the kingdom of God!  All the trees
are without fruit except the Tree of Life planted in the
paradise of God!  All the winds are disqueting to the
souls except the cup of the love of God!  Every benefit
vanisheth except the food of heaven.  It is incumbent
upon thee to partake thereof.
     Verily, I beg of God to strengthen thee in these divine
gifts, merciful bestowals and supreme favors.  Exert
thyself, so that thou mayest abundantly enjoy this
glorious grace.

O my God!  O my God!+F1
     This is a servant who hath ascended to the Kingdom
of Thy Mercifulness; supplicated to the realm of Thy
Might and Singleness; is rejoiced at the appearance of
Thy Kingdom; the effulgence of Thy lights and the
spread of Thy signs.  He hath believed in Thy Verses,
been overtaken with the ecstasy of Thy love and with
the cheer of Thy affection, until his soul craved to behold
Thy Beauty -- and could not (or was unable to) endure
the grief and violence of the fire of separation,
hastened unto the Supreme Friend and betook himself

1.  Supplication begging the forgiveness of God for Dr. .........., who hath
      ascended to the Kingdom of God.
+P 230
to Thy Threshold of Holiness at the visiting places of
grandeur!
     O my Lord!  Suffer him to abide in a blessed abode
and cause him to enter into a retreat of faithfulness and
favor him to everlastingly dwell in the heavenly paradise,
the precinct of meeting in the shelter of Thy great
mercy!
     Verily, thou art the Beneficent, the Merciful, the
Powerful, the Forgiving, the Mighty, the Bestower!

O thou who art honorable and faithful to God!
     How many men and women awaited the manifestation
of the Messiah after Moses?  Yet when His beauty
shone forth and His face appeared, they (the people)
did not recognize Him, but continued to follow the superstitions
of the Pharisees, who used to say:  "Where
is the authority of the Messiah?  Where is the throne
of David, the Glorious?  Where is his iron rod?
Where are his innumerable hosts?  Where are his attacking
armies?  Where are his angels of heaven?
Where do we see justice of government existing among
people and even among beasts and insects?  Where is
his great majesty?  Where is his power, which shaketh
heaven and earth?  Is not this a claim of one who is
bewildered and wandering amidst valleys and hills?
Doth he not ride upon as ass, while on his head there
is a crown of thorns and he is despised?"
     Indeed, all of the foregoing statements are of the evil
opinions which the Pharisees used to proclaim through
every man's tongue.  But those who had listening ears
and clear insight, listened not to such misleading


+P 231
speeches, but realized the Messiah as the rising Sun
with His effulgent face, and that the radiance of His
illumination was diffused over the whole world.  They
regarded even the ass on which He (Christ) was
mounted as a splendid throne and also the thorns which
were upon His head as a brilliant diadem!
     Verily, direct thou thine own self towards His Kingdom,
that thou mayest perceive that His traces and
authority continue forever and will never cease!

O thou whose heart is empty and pure through the
        Light of the word of God shining therein!
     I have read thy brilliant letter which proveth thy humbleness
before the Divine Might and thy cheerfulness
by the fragrances of God emanating from the gardens
of expressions and facts.  I ask God to make thee, thy
relations and kindred attentive to the Merciful Mighty
and the Supreme Kingdom and to illumine their sights
and hearts by the light of the knowledge of God.  And
[be] thou rejoiced at the mercy of thy Lord and this
great abundance from the Kingdom of Mysteries.  Be
thou a strong and fortified refuge and a high cave.  This
is naught else than to cut thyself from everything beside
God, to be drawn by the fragrances of God and to be
happy and joyful by the gift of God.

O thou who art shining with the Kingdom's Lights!
     Verily, I am informed of thine earnest desire for the
Kingdom of God, thy sparkling by the love of God and
thy longing for the service of the sacred and effulgent
Threshold.  I pray God to kindle and light the lamp
of knowledge in the glass of thy heart, so that it may


+P 232
shine upon all parts of the world and bring thy husband
to the life by the Spirit of Life, assist thee to announce
the good news by the illuminating Light, and remove
the covering of thy sight so that thou mayest see God's
Beauty and His Essential Perfection, His astonishing
profusion and His appearance to the hearts and spirits.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter *** was received; its contents were
very sweet.  The sweetness of the meanings was
unlimited.  I ask God that thou mayest find rest and
comfort in the shelter of the holy Banner of Peace and
Concord; become the means of spreading the love of
God; attain boundless health and security; grow joyfully,
day by day, through the glad-tidings; soar on
high through ecstasy and delight; sings the melody and
proclaim the call, "Ya Baha-ul-ABHA!"
     O maid-servant of God!  That call to which thou
didst listen is from the Kingdom of ABHA.  Therefore,
praise and glorify the Possessor of that Call, so
that the call may be repeated.
     As to the interpretation of the vision, it is thus:
Ascent from earth to heaven indicateth growth in the
love of God and development in the knowledge of God.
The more thou dost develop, the brighter and more
spacious becometh the pathway to the Kingdom.  The
building in front of which thou didst stand is an edifice
of divine edifices, a station of the spiritual stations.  I
hope that thou mayest attain to that station, also to
other stations which are the other edifices.
     I supplicate and implore the Kingdom of ABHA in


+P 233
behalf of thine honored husband and all the family and
the friends in Cincinnati.  I pray that the heavenly
blessings may descend, the divine bounties become possible
and that thou mayest become a true caller of the
Word of God.

O thou who art turned to the Kingdom of the Lord, the
        Forgiving!
     With prayers and supplications and with submissive
songs of the Texts of God, I plead to Him to accept
thee in His Kingdom; to clothe thee with the mantle of
sanctity; to gloriously cover thee with the veil of abstinence;
to illumine thy brow with the light of singleness;
to console thine eyes with the seeing of the Texts
of the Kingdom in the human form; and to make thee
utter the mentioning of Him, rejoicing through His
bounty, heralding His Kingdom with a bright face,
whose light will illumine all sides

O thou maid-servant of God!
     It is incumbent upon thee to turn thyself wholly to
the kingdom of God, to sever thyself from aught else
but Him, to be filled by the love of God, to put on the
garment of sanctity and continence, which is free from
worldliness, to [become] transfigured in the mantle of
the gifts of the kingdom of God and to be a great sign
among the maid-servants of God; that the Supreme
Concourse may send out through thee a fragrance by
which hearts may be cheered and spirits rested.
     Give this Truth to every pliable soul that thou mayest
deem ready to harken unto the voice of God; for


+P 234
this is better unto thee than the earth and that which
is thereupon.

O thou who art longing to witness the lights from the
        Beauty of El-ABHA!
     Thy letter reached me at this moment and I was rejoiced
at thine excellent words which proved the enkindlement
of the fire of the love of God in thy heart.
Be confident in the bounty of thy Lord.  Verily He will
make thee a manifest example and an evident proof for
the attainment of His Kingdom in this glorious century.
Then the fire of His love will flame in thy heart,
the light of His knowledge will shine in thy face, thy
tongue will speak with eloquent explanation and thy
spirit will be attracted unto the kingdom of knowledge.
     O maid-servant of God!  The Spirit knoweth the
spirit, the Spirit addresseth the spirit and the Spirit associateth
with the spirit.***

O thou spiritual clarion!
     The voice of the physical clarion may travel the distance
of three miles, but the harmony of the spiritual
Clarion reacheth to the East and the West.  The effect
of that is only in the bodies; but the effect of this is in
the spirits.  The first proclaimeth the time of prayer;
the second announceth the appearance of the Most
Great Resurrection.  That hath no conscious knowledge
of its own voice; while this is exhilarated and rejoiced
by its own melody.
     How significant and eloquent were those new verses,
for they were the notes of the clarion of the love of
God.


+P 235
     Raise thou this call as much as thou canst, and sound
and blow this clarion continually night and day, so that
the souls may become quickened and the people find
eternal life.

O thou dear maid-servant of God!
     What thou hast written hath caused joy and happiness,
for it was an evidence of turning to the Kingdom
and of seeking the bounty of heaven.  I ask God to
provide means whereby that which is thy utmost hope
may be realized.
     Concerning the young Japanese, the answer to his
letter is enclosed herein.  Perchance this youth may be
the cause of guiding his family and people.***

O thou flower of the Rose-Garden of the Love of God!
     The letter which thou hast written was read.  Thou
hast written regarding the arrival of the beloved maid-servant
of God, Mrs. ........; that she has lived for
eighteen days in your house and become the cause of joy
and fragrance among the believers.
     Praise be to God! that thou hast seen the effulgence
of the light of the covenant which hath enlightened all
the countries.  Invoke thou God that day by day the
splendors of the Orb of regions may become manifest
and evident more and more.
     Thou hast asked for permission to present thyself
with thy dear husband in this Blessed Spot.  In these
days it is not according to wisdom.  Postpone this matter
until some other time.
     Convey greeting and kindnesses on my behalf to all
the maid-servants of the True One.


+P 236
O thou who art kindled with the fire of the Love of
        God!
     Blessed art thou, for thy letter was presented at the
Blessed Spot and was read by Abdul-Baha with a
delight and love which is journeying out towards all
directions.
     O servant of God!  Be thou a sign of guidance, a
standard of the Supreme Concourse and a light shining
in the meeting of the maid-servants.
     Verily, I beseech my Lord to grant thee thy greatest
wishes and to bestow on thee the privilege of entering
into the center of the Kingdom of God; and to make
thee a herald in His name, in that vast and extensive
region.
     Deliver my greeting and praise to all the maid-servants
of God.

O thou dazzling gem by the light of the Love of God!
     Verily I read thy beautiful, elegant and expressive
letter which informed [me] of thine extreme love for
God, which (love) impresseth the souls and dilateth the
breasts and which causeth thy heart to become filled with
the knowledge of God and overflow with the favor of
God.
     I ask God to make thee a sign of mercy and an
exemplar of servitude to the Sublime Threshold.
     Thank God for saving thee from baseness, trouble,
selfishness and death, and [that He] took away the veil
from before thine eyes, manifested unto thee the Beauty
of El-ABHA, granted thee healing, planted in thy heart
the seed of love and thereby chose thee from among the


+P 237
maid-servants.  Therefore, endeavor so that thou dedicate
(thyself) entirely to God; no thought or mention
should remain in thee save the name of thy Supreme
Lord.  Endeavor so that those countries become
illumined by the light of the gift of God.
     Embrace the light of thine eyes (thy son) on my
behalf in the Kingdom of God.

O maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter was received and its content read.  Thank
God that thou wast guided by the light of guidance and
attracted to the Kingdom of ABHA.  Serve God day
and night and seek happiness from His name.  Although
thou hast met with many difficulties and passed
through many trials, yet thou must thank God that thou
didst attain to the light of guidance and directed thyself
to the Kingdom of Glory.
     I hope that thou mayest be a cause of guidance to
people and that thou mayest seek absolute spirituality.
Train thy dear son in such a manner that he will attain
the illumination of the Kingdom, will become a true
servant of God, a light of love and a radiance of
harmony.

O thou who art enkindled with the fire of the Love of
        God!
     Thank thou thy revered friend and thy attracted
(spiritual) sister who hath guided thee to this right
path and given thee to drink the choice wine of knowledge
from the cheerful cup.  Wert thou duly informed
of this divine bounty, thou wouldst kneel down and


+P 238
prostrate thyself before her for this great gift.  For,
verily, thou wert athirst and she was a clear running
fountain.  Thank thou God for that He hath favored
thee with her meeting, that thou art benefited by her
clouds and sought light from her lamp.  Wert thou to
expend all that is in the earth, thou wouldst not appreciate
her due value.  Glorified is He who hath enabled
her to illumine thine insight, to purify thy heart, to
dilate thy breast and to sanctify thy soul!
     Then know thou, if thy revered husband herald the
Kingdom of God among peoples, he would find the
doors of the Kingdom open before his face among the
nations, and then his breath would take effect within
the heart of the world through the breath of the Holy
Spirit.
     I beg of God to guide him unto that whereunto He
hath guided thee, and to favor him with that with which
He hath favored thee.  At that time the lamps of gifts
will be enkindled among thy kinsmen and people.
     Verily, thy Lord is the Beneficent, the Merciful, the
Giver!
          Upon ye be greeting and praise!
                                    ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.

+P 239
O thou who art attracted by a Breath that passed upon
       thee from the Holy Garden, the Blessed Spot--
       the Paradise of El-Abha!
     I have read thy brilliant letter, which although short
in words yet [is] loquacious, and shows thy firmness in
the Covenant of God, thy steadfastness in the religion
of God, thy adherence to the laws of God, and thine
energy which thou hast shown towards the doctrines of
God.  Thou has done well.  Thou has done well, O
thou shining star in the Horizon of El-Abha!  Well
done!  Well done!  O thou burning candle in the glass
of that remote country!
     It hath been reported by ..... that thou hast
rendered valuable services to the vineyard of God and
His beloved servants, that thou art encouraging the
shaking hearts and making them more firm and solid,
and about the facilitations thou hast made for the promotion
of the utterances of God amongst the people.
By the Life of God! the angels of heaven magnify thee,
the Supreme Concourse praise thee, the party of the
Kingdom of El-Abha announce to thee the glad-tidings
and the hosts of the unseen assist thee and render thee
victorious through the banners of Baha.
     I have answered the two supplications sent through
thee by two newly guided servants.


+P 240
O thou honorable lady!
     Verily, I received thy excellent letter and read it and
my heart was gladdened with its content, which shows
thy guidance.  Thou hast--praise be unto God!--
entered under the shadow of the Kingdom of God and
become one of the sheep of God; [entered] under the
education of the Holy Shepherd, who hath sacrificed
His soul and body, as well as His grades, to His subjects.
     As to the letters which thou hast sent, I forward to
thee their answers through this letter and thou wilt send
them to the owners; thereby thou wilt be rewarded in
the Kingdom of God, since thou hast guided those souls
unto the Right Path, and caused them to enter the
Kingdom of God.  El-Baha be upon thee!

O thou who art advancing towards God!
     I have already read thy letter sent to his honor,
..... May God confirm and strengthen thee to
serve His Cause and to enable thee to speak His praise
among the maid-servants of the Merciful, and to call
out in His name in those regions and climes; so that
thou mayest work in the vineyard of God with thy
heart severed from aught else save God, and overflowing
with the waters of the knowledge of God.
     We have herewith written answers to the three supplications
which thou hast sent.
     Rejoice at the glad-tidings of God, in this day wherein
the fragrances of holiness have perfumed the nostrils
of all in the universe!


+P 241
O thou maid-servant of God!
     I was informed of the contents of thy letter and rejoiced
with the fragrances which are being diffused
from the garden of its texts.  It showed that thou art
inebriated with the wine of the love of God and moved
by the breezes of acceptance which are blowing from
the point of the favor of God.
     By my life, I was rejoiced at thy humility, submissiveness,
lowliness and meekness in the Cause of
God, inasmuch as rendering service to the maid-servants
of God is a mighty crown, which all the greatest queens
among women will glory to wear.
     O maid-servant of God! thou oughtest to pray; thou
oughtest to be suppliant; thou oughtest to be humble in
every time and moment.
     I beg of God to enable thee to serve Him in His
glorious vineyard, and in His garden, by the holy
fragrances of which all regions are perfumed in this
great day.
     As to thy coming to this land, there is no harm in
that.  Thou art permitted to come and this is an ample
reward unto thee.

O thou believer in God!
     Thy letter was received and from its contents happiness
was realized.  It was a proof of faith and assurance
and of firmness in the Covenant and Testament.
     Desire thou through the bounty and mercy of the
Lord of Might that He make thee a cause of spreading


+P 242
the fragrances of God and confirm thee in the
service of the Kingdom of God.
     The letter of Mrs. ........ was considered and for
thy sake a letter was written her.  It is enclosed.
     I pray God and supplicate the Threshold of Mercy
for both of you that you may attain to that which is
the will of God and may be aided and strengthened
(while) in this mortal world.
     There is much work and I have not the leisure to
write more than this.

O thou who has turned towards the Lights of the
       Alliance!
     Verily, I greet thee from the White Place, the
bright, blessed Holy Land, and say:  "Greeting and
praise and blessings and glory be upon thee, O thou
believer in God, and (O thou) enkindled by the fire
of the love of God!
     "Verily, the Lord of Hosts shall watch thee with the
gaze of the eye of favor and shall assist thee in a matter
whereby thy breast shall rejoice and thine eye shall
brighten and thine affairs shall be arranged and composed
from all directions."
     Therefore, thou wilt call and say:  "Blessing be upon
me for this great favor and for this manifest success!"

O thou who art directed unto God!
     Verily, I saw thy photograph and was rejoiced by
perceiving thy illumined likeness, which proved the
purity of thy heart and thy being well directed unto
God.


+P 243
     Strive with thy power to paint thy likeness on the
pages of the hearts with such beauty as to brighten the
minds.  That beauty is the splendor of the Merciful
and the glad-tidings of thy Lord, the Clement, whereby
the faces shine with an eternal light in the course of
ages and centuries.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     In these times thanksgiving for the bounty of the
Merciful One consists in the illumination of the heart
and the feeling of the soul.  This is the reality of
thanksgiving.  But, although offering thanks through
speech or writings is approvable, yet, in comparison
with that, it is but unreal, for the foundation is spiritual
feelings and merciful sentiments.  I hope that you
may be favored therewith.  But the lack of capacity
and merit in the Day of Judgment does not prevent one
from bounty and generosity, for it is the day of grace
and not justice, and to give every one his due is justice.
Consequently, do not look upon thy capacity, nay,
rather, look upon the infinite grace of the Bounty of
Abha who grace is comprehending and whose bounty
is perfect.
     I beg of God through the confirmation and assistance
of the True One thou mayest show the utmost eloquence,
fluency, ability and skill in teaching the real significances
of the Bible.  Turn toward the Kingdom of
Abha and seek the bounty of the Holy Spirit.  Loosen
the tongue and the confirmation of the Spirit shall reach
thee.
     As to that great Sun which thou sawest in a dream:
That is His Holiness the Promised One and the lights


+P 244
thereof are His bounties.  The surface of the water is
transparent body--that is, pure hearts.  Its waves are
the moving of the hearts, the cheering of the souls--
that is, spiritual feelings and merciful sentiments.
Thank tho God for that thou hast had such a revelation
in the world of dreams.
     As to the fact that man must entirely forget himself,
by this is meant that he should arise in the mystery of
sacrifice and that is the disappearance of mortal sentiments
and extinction of blamable morals which constitute
the temporal gloom, and not that the physical
health should be changed into weakness and debility.
     I humbly supplicate to the Threshold of Oneness that
heavenly blessings and merciful forgiveness may overtake
thy dear mother, sisters and loving relations, especially
thy betrothed who suddenly departed from this
world to the next one.

O thou seeker of the Kingdom!
     Thou hast forwarded thy photograph and it was
considered.  In thy face a brilliant light is apparent and
that sparkling light is the love of God.  All faces are
dark except the face which is a mirror of the light
of the love of divinity.  This light is not accidental--
it is eternal.  It is not temporal but real.  When the
heart hath become clear and pure then the face will become
illuminated, because the face is the mirror of the heart.
     I was indeed very happy to look at thy picture and
pray God that thy face may become shining.  Be happy
and joyful and in this Age be it illuminated and full of
light.


+P 245
O thou kind maid-servant of God!
     Truly, I say, thou art worthy of the service in the
Kingdom and art meriting to be a maid-servant in the
threshold of the love of the realm of Might.  Rest
thou assured upon the bounty and favors of the Lord
of Hosts, who will undoubtedly confirm thee.
     Restrict all thy time to the spreading of the fragrances
of God and be thou engaged in the guidance of
souls.  I associate with thee in spirit at all times and
am thy friend and helper.
     Ere long thou shalt behold that innumerable centers
are going to be organised in America+F1 for the purpose
of the promotion of the Cause of God and hearing the
speeches of the maid-servants of the Merciful and the
believers of God.  Consider thou the days of Christ,
how they were a very few, yet in a short space of time
they caused a clamor and acclamation throughout all
regions.
     Convey my greetings to Mrs. ........ and say:
"These seeds which are scattered here and there are
spreading strong roots in the bosom of the earth and
these will develop and grow until many harvests are
gathered.  Rest thou assured."
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Show thou the utmost
affection and love toward Mrs. ........  Truly, I
say, his honor Mirza ........ is beloved and kind.
Ere long he shall behold the universal confirmation
descending upon him.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Strive thou in Buffalo
(N.Y.) so that perfect and lasting spiritual assemblies


------------------------
1.          in 1906.
+P 246
may be established and the souls be trained and progress
spiritually.
     Convey my respectful greetings to Mr. and Mrs.
........ and say:  "A most great gift is prepared
and made ready for you in the universe of the Kingdom
and the invisible realm.  Display ye an endeavor
and show ye an effort, so that ye may attain to it and
become eternal and everlasting."
     Exercise the utmost affection on my part to Miss
........ and say:  "If thou art seeking a heavenly
palace, make thy house the gathering-place of the
friends of God."
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Praise be to God that
thou has become famous throughout the regions as a
Bahai.  This favor is worthy of the utmost thanks and
praise.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Whenever thou art
intending to deliver a speech, turn thy face toward the
Kingdom of Abha and, with a heart detached, begin
to talk.  The breaths of the Holy Spirit will assist thee.
     Assist thou Dr. ........ and help her all the time.
Perchance, God willing, she may attain to guidance.
Exercise the utmost kindness to ........ and say:
"Whatsoever is thy desire is found in the Cause of
Baha'o'llah.  If thou art asking confirmation and
assistance, be thou faithful, firm and steadfast."

O thou who art advancing unto the Kingdom of God!
     Verily, I read thy letter which was sent to us, and I
noted its contents, wherein thou prayest for confirmation
to serve thy Lord.  I pray God to bless thee and


+P 247
aid thee to receive His trusts, so that thou mayest receive
the greatest favor in the world of humanity.
     O maid-servant of God!  Forget all else save God,
be in communion with Him, supplicate and pray to
Him to make thee conqueror over the material things,
impressed by the bounties of the Kingdom, commemorating
the name of thy Lord, pure from all else save
Him, and imbued with the spiritual attributes of those
who are holy (and high); then shall thy breaths have
effect upon the hearts, and attract the hearts of thy son
and husband unto the Kingdom of God.
     I pray god to confirm thee in this, to make firm thy
heart in faith, and give thee a spiritual power, effective
in hearts and spirits.

O thou who art set aglow with the Fire burning in the
       Tree of Sinai!
     Verily, I read thy letter, which speaks of the throbbing
of thy heart by the thoughts of the love of God
and indicates the unity of the maid-servants of the
Merciful, their harmony in the word of God, and their
attraction by the fragrances of God, for they are the
waves of one sea, the leaves of one tree, and the flowers
of one garden.  By these tidings the heart of
Abdul-Baha was made happy and he attained thereby
fragrance and spirituality.
     For the Greatest Name and the Ancient Beauty+F1 --
may my soul be a sacrifice to His beloved--endured all
difficulty and ordeals for the purpose of uniting the
hearts of the beloved of God; that they might be exhilarated


------------------------

+P 248
through the wine of unity and proclaim with
one voice:
"Hasten to love, to love, O peoples of the world!
Hasten to harmony, to harmony, O creatures of the
     universe!
Hasten to peace, to peace, O mankind!
Hasten to safety, to safety, O concourse of the Divine!
Hasten to concord, to concord, O hosts of the Merciful!
Hasten to oneness, to oneness, O people of El-Baha,
     among the people!"
     I ask God to aid you in spreading these fragrances,
and in reading these words in the supreme assemblages
and great meetings.
     Convey my spiritual greeting to thy honored sister.
I ask God to confirm the weak and to make them
mighty in the kingdom of His Majesty.  I pray God
to guide thy honorable husband to the Path of the Kingdom,
the sublime, and to aid thee in the service of His
Cause in His glorious vineyard.***

O thou who has advanced towards Baha'!
     Truly, I say unto thee, wert thou to spend all that is
on earth, thou couldst not obtain this gift which God
hath strengthened thee to take freely.  Lo! it is the
guidance of God and it is being attracted to the Beauty
of El-Baha!  Thank God for this gift, which is the
most wonderful jewel which is glittering on the crown
of great glory and honorable position.


+P 249
O thou who art anticipating the descent of the Gift of
       God!
     The sweetness of the expressions contained in thy
words reached the taste of my perception and I was informed
of the glorious aim embodied in thy sentences.
     No doubt the breeze of God hath awakened thee
from thy sleep, until thou hast become conscious of
the bounties of the Kingdom which are descending at
this time.
     As to thy desire to be severed from this mortal life
and thy great attraction to the eternal life:  This is becoming
to every discerning human being who hath a
lofty character.  I pray God to ordain for thee this pure
life and make thy heart attracted unto exalted grades,
favored in His Supreme Kingdom, humble and meek
before every penitent servant and diffusing the fragrance
of God in this new age.

O thou shining ray!
     Verily, the ray, being transmitted from the etheric
sphere, rends the space and reaches the surface of the
earth and dispels the gloomy darkness.  Verily, be thou
one of the rays of the Sun of Truth and then thou wilt
cause the darkness of error to disappear and wilt change
its intense obscurity into a discovering light which will
guide (the people) unto the Kingdom of God.

O thou effulgence of the Kingdom!
     I read thy letter and was informed of thy speech,
the contents of which were full of the feelings within
thy consciousness, and of thy spiritual sympathies.  The
light is divided into two kinds, material and spiritual.


+P 250
The material light is a vanishing matter and is known
by etheric vibrations.  But the spiritual light is the divine,
eternal and never-ending quality and is a truth of
the Kingdom.  Blessed is thy face for that it hath taken
a portion and a radiance from that Light.

O thou candle of the Love of God!
     The light of man depends on the light of the love
of God.  Thank thou God, for thou hast illuminated
thy face with this light and hast partaken of the bounty
of the Kingdom of El-Abha, chanted the verses of
unity and worn the crown of guidance of the Glorious
Lord on thy head.  This is the real Kingdom!

O thou who art desirous of the Kingdom of God!
     Thy letter was the cause of happiness and its contents
were the proof of thy turning to the Shining
Beauty.  In this blessed period, when the light of the
endless bounties is illuminating the dark world, some
souls, like the butterfly, circled round the Divine Lamp
and with perfect yearning sacrificed their lives.
     I ask of God that thou mayest be one of those souls,
so that the rays of knowledge will shine forth from thy
face to those regions and will be the cause of guiding
the seekers of Reality.
     Though thou wert obliged to leave Baltimore, I hope
that thou wilt be the cause of guidance in Washington
(D.C.).  Receive proofs and evidence from Mirza Abul
Fazl+F1 so that thou wilt be armed with convincing proofs
and sufficient argument to break down the ranks of
denial, pride and ignorance.

O tho dear friend!
     The maid-servant of God ........ hath remembered
thee in her letter and hath thus made my heart
busy with thy thought.  Consider how much she must
care for thee to have remembered thee in such a place.
Indeed, this is great love and I am hopeful that this
may be a confirmation to thee, so that thou mayest become
a personage of the Kingdom, heavenly, illumined
and spiritual and a means of spreading and exemplifying
the qualities and attributes of God.

O thou who art advancing toward God!
     The letter of that divine maid-servant was received
and contents were apprehended.  The morn of guidance
is beaming forth from the supreme horizon and
the light of oneness is shining on the supreme apex.
The verses of unity are being chanted and the evidences
of the Glorious Lord are in themselves the greatest witness
and proof.
     I beg of God that thou mayest be so replenished with
the spirit of the love of God that there may not remain
(in thee) any place or access for the winds of tests.  For
what can dark doubts do with the light of guidance, or
clouds with the shining moon?  Tests and trials only
cause agitation to weak hearts.  But the pure souls, a
hundred thousand tests are but to them like mirage,
imagination and shadow.  The shadow cannot withstand
the rays of the sun and pure fragrances of holiness
will not be concealed through the doubts of the
beetle.  The headache of wavering (or hesitancy) will
not affect those exhilarated with the wine of the love of
God.


+P 252
     In sooth, there will be found in those regions certain
persons like the Pharisees of the time of Christ, who,
night and day, will exert themselves with all heart and
soul to cast forth doubts, in order that they may deprive
the souls of the glad-tidings of the Holy Spirit.  They
will disseminate false rumors and utter many a calumny
and will publish and announce (false) stories.  They
will undertake all these only for the sake of earthly
vanities.
     And some Pharisees among the missionaries of the
Gospel will hasten thither from Persia and say, "We
are aware of the secret of the matter."  All they may
say is sheer slander.
     Now know you these [things], that in its time you
may dispel and annihilate the darkness of those suspicions,
like unto a manifest light.  I beg of God that
He may grant thee a power that thou mayest resist all
in the earth--how much more these weak, hired individuals
who receive salary and bribe for spreading such
calumnies!
     Be ye admonished, O possessors of understanding!

O thou dear maid-servant of God!
     Your letter was received.  Its contents were a glorious
proof that thy heart and soul are attracted to the
fragrances of the Merciful One.  Thank thou God for
that thou art awakened by such a Breeze and quickened
by such a Spirit and hast found joy and fragrance.
     Those souls who have attained to faith, if they be
protected and preserved from tests and keep firm and
steadfast, the divine confirmations will surround them
from all directions.***


+P 253
     I beg of God that thou wilt be confirmed with the
love of God in all conditions.  I beg of God that thou
mayest be so assisted in serving the Holy Threshold
that all thy family will be astonished and amazed, and
will glory and honor.

O ye shining Assembly!+F1
     The meeting that you organized hath attracted the
divine gaze and the subject of your conversation was
the divine commemoration.  A ray from the Kingdom
of Abha fell upon that assemblage and that meeting
was adorned, and a number of souls, supplicants to
God, were gathered in that meeting.  If this assembly
continues as it is befitting and behooving, great results
will thereby appear and conduce to the illumination of
those parts, spiritual progress will ensue, the lights of
the Sun of Truth will shine, hearts will be illumined,
eyes will become seeing, ears become hearing, the lukewarm
(or withdrawn ones) become aflame, the inanimate
(or numbed ones) will be enkindled in soul and
an ecstasy will come to all by which those present will
be astonished.
     I supplicate to and invoke before the Threshold of
Oneness, saying:
     "O Thou Creator!  Preserve and protect Thou that
assembly from grave (or general) tests and keep them
firm and constant in the Covenant and Testament.
Confer upon them such steadfastness as will enable
them to withstand doubts and root our the foundation
of calumnious rumors; for some person hath appeared


------------------------
1.    the Cleveland (O.) assembly.
+P 254
(or arisen) with the utmost falsehood, in those parts,
and publisheth false reports in some newspapers."

     O ye members of the shining assembly!  Each one
of you must resist doubts (or false rumors) in those
parts like unto a great barrier, until the invisible confirmations
may appear and merciful assistance may become
manifest.  May your souls be cheered!

O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!
     Verily, I read thy letter of thanksgiving to God, for
He hath illumined thy heart with the light of the
Mightiest Guidance, dilated thy breast through the fragrance
of the garden of His Kingdom, the Abha,
caused thee to speak His praise in that remote and extensive
country, and hath enabled thee to guide souls
who are attracted to the beauty of God and enkindled
by the fire of His Love at this moment.
     By the Lord of Hosts, God hath ordained for no
one greater good than this, or any spirit more brilliance
than this, or any spirit more activity than this.
     Were the dominions of the whole, entire earth to be
thine, it would not equal this great dominion which is
no other than spreading the guidance of God.  Forasmuch
as the earthly dominion is like unto the kingdom
of Edward VII, king of England, his coronation day
became unto him the day of griefs, the day of sorrows,
and the days of moaning; his joy was changed into
abundant sorrow, and the light of happiness was transformed
into the darkness of a gloomy night.  This is
the condition of the world, its honor, its dominion, its
glory and affluence.


+P 255
     But as to thee--O thou who art attracted unto God!
--thou hast established an eternal and everlasting
throne through the guidance of God, and hast become
crowned with a diadem, the gems of which scintillate
throughout centuries and ages; nay, rather, for cycles
and periods!
     This throne cannot be shaken by the powers of the
earth and its calamities; nor can incidental obstacles,
worldly impediments, or all the diseases and ailments
prevent or delay this coronation.
     For this is under the protection of God and His
preservation, defended by His guard and in the stronghold
of His patronage, and is watched over by the eye
of His mercifulness.  therefore, thank thou God forevermore!
     Deliver my greetings to the attracted maid-servant
of God thy honorable wife, and bear unto her the glad-tidings
of the graces of her Lord.

O thou whom I mention with my heart and tongue!
     Though I do not see thee with mine eyes, I do see
thee with my heart, and mention thee with the fullness
of love, clemency, yearning and attraction, supplicating
my Lord that we may meet together at the meeting of
His Kingdom and the pavilion of His might, where we
shall chant the verses of thanks for His bounty, generosity
and gifts, the lights of which have shone upon all
horizons and their effulgences have become intense upon
the hearts of the people of harmony.
     O thou my dearly beloved!  Hasten!  Hasten! to
the gifts of thy Lord, the Merciful!  Come to the Benefactor;


+P 256
avail thyself of this opportunity and take thy
portion of this Greatest Treasure in this promised day!

O thou spiritual youth and merciful young man!
     Consider the grace of thy Master; how He hath directed
thee to the fountain of salvation, until thou hast
drunk from the salsabil (i.e., clear water of life) of
the guidance of God, in this holy and rich garden.
     Cling to this firm handle and make thy feet steady
in this path, so that the bounties of thy Supreme Lord
may successively pour upon thee and make thee a sign
of His mighty knowledge.

O thou who art directed to the Light of Guidance!
     Thank thou God, for tho hast chanted the verses
of the Mighty guidance in the assemblage of knowledge
and hast unfurled the banner of attraction in those
most extensive places.  Therefore, appreciate this with
due appreciation and know thou that this guidance is a
gift, greater than which cannot be imagined.  Forasmuch
as it is a bounty from the Glorious Lord, a success
to every sincere servant, a light for the faces of devoted
ones and a bestowal from the Lord, the Clement,
the Merciful.

O ye+F1 who are advancing towards the Kingdom of
       God!
     Mr. ........ hath praised you that, verily, ye have
rent the veil asunder, removed the covering, become informed
of the mysteries of God and of the symbols of
the Holy Bible, have understood the interpretations of
its verses, discovered the truth of its evidences and been

hath guided you and ordained for you this great success
and manifest bounty.  Kiss, on my behalf, the faces
of your august children who are nurtured from the
breast of the guidance of God.

O My God!  O My God!
     This thy servant hath abandoned superstitions,
emerged from darkness and hath entered into Thy
Light which hath shone forth to the world!  Praise be
unto Thee, O My God! for thou hast removed the covering
from his insight, caused the reality of Guidance
to appear unto him and hath ordained for him a gift
which is not followed by destruction!
     O Lord!  O Lord!  Send unto him a gentle breeze
from the garden of Thy sanctity in Thy Kingdom of
Abha, so that he may be refreshed and developed as a
flourishing branch in that adorned and thickly planted
grove; cause his tongue to speak Thy praise among
mankind and confirm him through the breath of Thy
Holy Spirit at the time of prayer, so that he may become
a soul unto bodies, a light unto every eye, a joy
to every heart, a consolation to every depressed one, a
happiness to every grieved one, and a proof to every
gazer!  Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Potent, the
Bestower, the Merciful, the Giver!

O thou who art advancing unto God!
     Thy precious and beloved letter came to hand and
all contents noted.  Consider how the bounty of God


+P 258
hath surrounded thee until it brought thee to the shore
of the sea of the endless and boundless gift of God!  I
supplicate the benevolence of God and His providence
to make thee a dazzling light and a merciful and
bounteous gift to His creatures; and to enable thee to
be firm and steadfast in the Cause of the Truth and to
appoint thee as a means for the exaltation of His Word.

O thou confirmed by an inspiration from the Kingdom!
     Blessed thou art, for thou hast delivered the Word
of thy Lord to ........, the maid-servant of God!
     Glad-tidings unto thee for that by reason of which
the spring of knowledge hath flowed out in the garden
of thy heart, inundated thy tongue and made thee utter
the name of thy Lord and call the people to the Kingdom
of thy God!
     I supplicate God, my Lord and thy Lord, to illumine
thy forehead with the light of success and victory, strengthen
thy spirit by the breath of god, quicken thee
by the spirit of God and make thee a pillar of guidance
set up in the firmament of the Kingdom of God.
     Grieve not because of my imprisonment and calamity;
for this prison is my beautiful garden, my mansioned
paradise and my throne of dominion among mankind.
My calamity in my prison is a crown to me in which I
glory among the righteous.  Thou shalt hear greater
than this.
     I ask God to assist whosoever is related to thee to
receive guidance in the future days, and to bless Mrs.
and Miss ........, Miss ........ and Miss ........,
and make them the signs of His gift among
the people of the world.


+P 259
O thou who art attracted unto the Beauty of El-Abha!
     Verily I read thy recent letter***, and noted its beautiful
contents and meanings which proved thy firmness
in the straight Path.
     O friend!  Be set aglow with the fire of the love of
God, so that the hearts of the people will become enlightened
by the light of thy love.
     Supplicate to God, pray to Him and invoke Him at
midnight and at dawn.  Be humble and submissive to
God and chant the verses of thanksgiving at morn and
eve, for that He guided thee unto the Manifest Light
and showed to thee the straight Path and destined to
thee the station of nearness in His wonderful Kingdom.
Verily I ask God to augment for thee, every day, the
light of guidance and His gift of virtue, comfort and
ease.  Thus thou mayest set a good example in that region;
that He may lift up the veil from before the eyes
of thy mother and father, so that they may witness the
lights of the Kingdom of God, which have encompassed
all regions.

O thou who hast spread the Fragrance of God!--may
       God confirm thee!
     Since thou hast reached America, we have not received
any message announcing to us thy safe and sound
arrival there, but Mr. ........, in a letter to us, hath
endeavored to explain in detail that thy return was like
showers of rain to that country and like the attack of a
lion upon those valleys and mountains.  He also informed
us that thou hadst been received there with honors
by the best men; by those whose breasts were dilated


+P 260
by the gentle breeze coming from the gardens of the
Kingdom of God.
     O thou who warmest thyself by the fire of the love
of God, spreading from the Tree of the Covenant!
Let thy soul be at ease and thy heart in peace concerning
the perfect success and progress which the pen is not
able to express, for in a short time thou shalt see the
flag of the Kingdom waving in those far and wide
regions, and the lights of the Truth shining brilliantly
in its dawn above those horizons, and thou shalt know
that thou art the center of the circle of the love of God,
the axis around which souls revolve in their way and
supplication to God.  Therefore, thou must widen thy
heart, dilate thy breast, have patience in plenty, calmness
of soul and cut thyself from everything but God!
By God, the truth is, if thou goest according to the
teachings of El-Abd+F1 and followest the steps of Him
who is annihilated in God, thou shalt see that the
cohorts of the Kingdom of God will come to thy help,
one after another, and that the hosts of the Might of
God will be in thy presence in steady succession, the
gates of the great victory opened and the rays of the
brilliant morning diffused!  By thy life, O my beloved!
if thou didst know what God hath ordained for thee,
thou wouldst fly with delight and thy happiness, gladness
and joy would increase every hour!  El-Baha be
upon thee!
     Present to the beloved people of God there my longings
for them.  Preach to them the glad-tidings of

women, to those who are very much attracted toward
God, and particularly to that one who have proved
that it is possible for a camel to pass through a needle's
eye.  May God keep them in joy and happiness and
burning with His love.

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Be rejoiced for my mentioning thee and gladden
thine eyes by the bounty of thy Lord.  Know, verily,
that His favor unto thee is great, great; for He guided
thee unto the Merciful Light, confirmed thee in bearing
calamities and hardships in the path of God, on
the part of the neglectful ones.
     There is no harm in any affliction which befalleth
thee in the love of El-Baha, for this affliction is a gem
which glistens and shines on the crown of guidance
which adorns thy head among the maid-servants.  Remember
the hardships of the disciples, and what Mary,
the Virgin; Mary, the Magdalene; and Mary, the
mother of Jesus, bore in the path of God; especially
Barbara, until she was martyred in the love of Christ;
and she being attracted unto the Kingdom of God, her
spirit soared unto the summits of holiness in the paradise
of eternal life, in the place of Meeting.

O thou whose nostrils are perfumed with the Fragrances
       of God!
     Verily, I read thy letter which contained graceful expressions
and was of a well made foundation, and I
inhaled the odor of the love of God from the garden
of its meanings and witness the lights of sincerity in

+P 262
the Cause of God from the dawning-place of its mysteries.
     Blessed art thou, O maid-servant of God, for thou
art attracted to the Word of god, and thy heart is
illuminated with the lights of the guidance of God, and
thy soul is cheered by the gentle breeze blowing from
the direction of the favor of God.
     Verily thy Lord is gracious toward thee.  Thank thou
God for this great bounty and praise Him for He hath
caused thee to enter His New Kingdom; and glorify
Him for He hath chosen thee from among those men
and women "who were called".
     Preach the Kingdom of God to every man and maid-servant
who is waiting the appearance of His Glorious
Kingdom.  The lights of guidance shall surely be
spread, even as the morning light spreads over all the
regions of the earth; all the regions of the earth shall be
refreshed by the Word of God.
     Deliver my longings and greetings to the consolation
of thine eye+F1 , ......, and to thy younger son, .......
Verily I love them both even as a compassionate father
loveth his dear children.  As to thee, have for them
an abundant love and exert thine utmost in training
them, so that their being may grow through the milk
of the love of God, forasmuch as it is the duty of
parents to perfectly and thoroughly train their children.
     There are also certain sacred duties on children toward
parents, which duties are written in the Book of
God, as belonging to God.  The (children's) prosperity
in this world and the Kingdom depends upon the

+P 263
good pleasure of parents, and without this they will be
in manifest loss.
     Send my greetings to ........+F1 , who is free in this
world, but a slave of God in His Great Kingdom.

O dear servant of God!
     The tests of God are surrounding you from all directions
and many afflictions have occurred; but thanks be
to God that you and your honorable husband are patient,
thankful and constant.
     The necessity and the particularity of the assured
and believing ones is to be firm in the Cause of God
and withstand the hidden and evident tests.  Thanks
be to God that you are distinguished and made eminent
by this blessing.  Anybody can be happy in the
state of comfort, ease, health, success, pleasure and joy;
but if one will be happy and contented in the time of
trouble, hardship and prevailing disease, it is the proof
of nobility.  Thanks be to God that that dear servant
of God is extremely patient under the disastrous circumstances,
and in the place of complaining gives
thanks.
     Verily I am pleased with both you and [your husband],
and I ask God that you may find pleasure and
ease in another world--for this earthly world is narrow,
dark and frightful, rest cannot be imagined and
happiness really is non-existent, everyone is captured
in the net of sorrow, and is day and night enslaved by
the chain of calamity; there is no one who is at all free
or at rest from grief and affliction.  Still, as the believers
of God are turning to the limitless world, they


------------------------
1.    a man who was born a slave and freed by the emancipation proclamation.
+P 264
do not become very depressed and sad by disastrous
calamities--there is something to console them; but the
others in no way have anything to comfort them at the
time of calamity.  Whenever a calamity and a hardship
occurs, they become sad and disappointed, and hopeless
of the bounty and the mercy of the Glorious Lord.
     Give especial greetings of Abha to all the friends of
God and the divine servants, and give them deep love
from Abdul-Baha.
     O dear servant of God!  Give my greeting and love
to your boys.  I ask God that each one of them become
a shining lamp.

O thou dear maid-servant of God!
     In reality thou art faithful and assured, thoughtful
and mentioning the name of thy Lord.  All the inhabitants
of the Kingdom are satisfied with thy service,
and the approximate angels are opening their tongues
in thy praise.  These angels are spiritual and merciful
powers, and in one sense the angels are those sanctified
souls who have disentangled themselves from the world
of possession and are confirmed with the powers of the
Kingdom.  However, be thou not sad.  Rejoice and
delight in the divine glad-tidings!
     I know that thou art in difficulty, but this difficulty is
conducive to the everlasting felicity and this weakness
is followed by the supreme strength.  Consider thou
how the faithful women in the time of Christ, and after
the departure of His Highness, underwent hardships!
What difficulties did they not bear; and what calamities
did they not endure!  But that adversity and trial,


+P 265
misfortune and derision, became the cause of imperishable
and deathless glory and rest.
     Do ye not look upon the beginning of the affairs; attach
your hearts to the ends and results.  The present
period is like unto the sowing time.  Undoubtedly it is
impregnated with perils and difficulties, but in the future
many a harvest shall be gathered and benefits and
results will come apparent.  When one considers the
issue and the end, exhaustless joy and happiness will
dawn.
     Live thou as far as thou art able according to the
divine commands and advices, because they are conducive
to eternal life.
     Caress and kiss on my behalf, with utmost love and
yearning, thy two dear children.  I supplicate God
that they may come the servants of the Cause of God
as their father and mother have, and be trained according
to Bahai education, so that they may become two
great signs of the love of God.

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily, I read thy interesting letter, understood from
it an excellent meaning and pray to God to augment
thy love, knowledge, certainty and confidence.
     O maid-servant of God!  Everything of importance
in this world demands the close attention of its seeker.
The one in pursuit of anything must undergo difficulties
and hardships until the object in view is attained and
the great success is obtained.  This is the case of things
pertaining to the world.  How much higher is that
which concerns the Supreme Concourse!  That Cause
involves every favor, glory and eternal bliss in the world


+P 266
of God.  The seeker after the great guidance and eternal
happiness necessarily will encounter difficulties.  He
must be patient under such circumstances.  The chosen
believers of the past quaffed the chalice of suffering and
sank deep in the ocean of trials until they attained to
that blessed station and sublime beatitude.
     Verily, I pray to God to aid thy children in the
service of the Word of God, the furtherance of His
Covenant and the spread of His fragrances, for this is
the great happiness of this life and that to come.
     I ask God to confirm the maid-servants of God, Mrs.
........ and Mrs. ........, in spirituality and to
make them firm in turning unto the Center of Mercy
and to make them sincere unto His glorious Face.
     Convey my greetings to Madam ........ and say
to her:  "Be not sorrowful on account of separation;
verily, thy Lord is of more good to thee than anything
in the material world.  He is the best companion and
the best friend and will accompany three under all
aspects."
     Convey my regards to the maid-servant of God,
........, and say to her:  "Be rejoiced, O maid-servant
of God, through the fragrances which have perfumed
the world.  Seek an abundant share from this
table which hath descended from heaven."
     O maid-servant of God!  It is necessary for every
sould who believeth in her Lord to send Abdul-Baha a
letter of acknowledgement in the Oneness of God.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     Glad-tidings unto thee because of my address and
answer to thee!  God hath purified thee from iniquities


+P 267
when He hath drowned thee in the sea of His mercy
and made thee drink the cup of faith and the pure
wine of knowledge.  Well done!  Well done! because thou
hast desired the evanescence of thy will for the will
of God, sought the augmentation of the love of God,
the enlargement of the knowledge of God and straightforwardness
in the path of God.  I ask God to assist
thee under all conditions and to enable thee to attain
the utmost of hopes.

O thou who art calling in the Name of God and heralding
       unto the Kingdom of God!
     Verily I considered the contents of thy recent letter,
thy beautiful writing and I observed thy heartfelt
thanks.  Verily my heart is filled with love and affection;
overflowing with spiritual attractions.
     Verily I know that the Tablets (Book) of Abdul-Baha
and his address is a hidden mystery and concealed fact.
No one is informed of its greatness and importance at
these times, but in the course of time and future centuries
the signs thereof will be manifested, the lights
thereof will dawn forth, the fragrances thereof will be
diffused and the greatness, the importance thereof will
be known.  The truth I say unto thee, that each leaflet
from Abdul-Baha will be a wide-spread book, nay,
rather, a glistening gem on the Glorious Crown.  Know
tho its value and hold great its station.
     Then praise God for that He chose thee to love Him
and elected thee to spread His fragrances.  He selected
thee from among the women of the world, so that thou
become a flame to the fire of His love, a sign of the
Kingdom of His Grace and a summoner to His Name,


+P 268
in humbleness and meekness, invocation and supplication
to God.
     Verily I ask God to protect thee from the waves of
tests and storms of trial until thou becomest firm in the
Cause of thy Lord--a firmness whereby thou be enabled
to withstand all nations and peoples.  When thou
art thus confirmed by God, with firmness and solidity
in His Covenant among the people, thou wilt see the
hosts of the Kingdom shelter thee from all sides with
banners whereunto all heads bow.
     O maid-servant of God!  It is incumbent upon thee
to be firm!  It is incumbent upon thee to be steadfast!
It is incumbent upon thee to be steadfast!  It is incumbent
upon thee to be steadfast in the Cause of the
Light which hath shone forth unto the world with great
brilliancy!
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily, Mary, the Magdalene,
was a villager, but she kept firm in the Cause
of Christ and confirmed the apostles at the time she
declared to them (thus):  "Verily, Christ is alive and
eternal and death did not overtake Him; and verily,
the foundation of His religion is not shaken by His
crucifixion at the hand of the oppressors!"  By this her
face is eternally shining from the horizon of guidance.
     O maid-servant of God!  The circumstances will be
severe for every thankful servant (i.e., believer in the
Teachings) in those boundaries and countries.  The
people shall arise against you with the most bitter
hatred, opposition and envy.  Swords of persecution
and curses shall be thrown at you by all the nations.
The wind of tests and trials shall fiercely blow and
thereby the weak trees, which are not firmly rooted in


+P 269
this wonderful vineyard, shall be uprooted.  But the
trees which are strong, thriving and green will be
strengthened, their branches extended, their leaves
opened, their appearance beautified and their blossoms
and fruits increased.  I ask God to make thee one of
those firmly rooted trees and an extended branch in this
most great vineyard, and to make thy heart like unto
a cup overflowing with His love in every assemblage.
Verily He is the Powerful, the Generous!
     Supplicate to God to guide Mrs. ........, so that
she may become thy partner and partaker of this great
bounty, and to confirm the family of Mr. ........, so
that they may be blest with blessings and successive aids
and with the appearance of the manifest signs.  Thus
all ye may become spreaders of the banner of union,
love, harmony and peace upon plains and deserts, hills
and mountains.

O thou who art firm in the love of God!
     Verily I read thy recent letter*** and I praised God
for His glorious mercy and His blessings which are
successively poured into the pure hearts.
     I have written a reply to the letter of ........ and
have enclosed it with this letter.  I ask God to make
him a sign of guidance and to guide, through him,
souls (people) of his native land and of other people.
Verily, my God chooses whomsoever He willeth, by
His mercy and generosity, for entrance into the Kingdom
of Glory and shineth the lights of (His) Beauty
upon them.  Blessed is he who keeps firm in the Path
and stands for the Cause of thy Merciful Lord--a
firmness like unto the lofty mountains.


+P 270
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily, I pray God to
sanctify thee from the material and thus clothe thee
with the garment of holiness and the mantle of purity
and send through thee the glad-tidings of thy Lord
from the Kingdom of Heaven.
     O maid-servant of God!  It is incumbent upon thee
to be firm and steadfast, for by it man attains the greatest
hope.  Bear every difficulty and be content with any
ordeal for the love of thy Lord, so that thou mayest
obtain that favor, the lights of which shine throughout
the horizons.

***O ye+F1 shining faces and spiritual beings!
     Verily, I was rejoiced at beholding those merciful
faces in whose brows the lights of guidance shine on
account of their turning unto the Kingdom of El-Abha!
O ye beloved of God and His chosen Ones!
     Blessed are your ears, for they have heard the Call!
     Blessed are your eyes, for they have beheld the signs
       of their Mighty Lord!
     Blessed are your tongues, for they have uttered the
       praise of my Lord, the Supreme!
     Blessed are your nostrils, for they have inhaled the
       odor of faithfulness from the people of guidance!
     Blessed are your hearts, for they are attracted to the
       Beauty of El-Abha!
     Blessed are your breasts, for they are dilated by the
       knowledge of God!

+P 271
     Blessed are your souls, for they have partaken of
       the spirit of life from the fragrances of sanctity
       in the Paradise of El-Abha!
     Thank ye God! for He hath guided you unto His
Kingdom and hath chosen you from among the called
ones of nations!  Your Lord hath indeed crowned you
with the diadem of eternal glory (which will continue)
throughout cycles and ages!  Truly I say unto you,
verily, the angels of heaven repeatedly bless you, for
ye have advanced toward God and turned unto His
Great Kingdom.  Ye shall surely see in this effulgence
a flash which will pervade all regions.  At that time,
all nations and communities will arise to praise and
glorify you, and they will bless themselves with your
commemoration in gatherings, temples of worship and
in exalted assemblies.  Is there any gift greater than
this?
     It is incumbent upon you to have union and harmony
and love and uprightness, and to be characterized with
the morals of your Lord, the Clement; to walk in the
highway of equity and beneficence.  Be ye manifestations
of the mercy of God, dawning-places of the light
of His great bounty, and arise with all steadfastness,
truthfulness, trustworthiness, compassion, modesty,
love and accord with the people of the world, no matter
of what community they may be; inasmuch as it behooveth
the light to shine even upon the rocks in the
field, and the soul is qualified for quickening individuals,
even though they be of the ugliest and most disagreeable
form, and a pure tree is adapted to bestow a
blessed fruit even upon those who throw stones at it.


+P 272
O ye+F1 who are attracted!  O ye who are united!  O ye
       who are believers and assured!
     Glad-tidings unto you for that ye believed in God,
were attracted to the Beauty of God, were directed
unto the Kingdom of God and were kindled by the fire
of the love of God!
     Therefore, I say unto you that, verily, the angels
of the Kingdom pray for the maid-servants of the Merciful;
the possessors of brilliant hearts, spiritual susceptibilities,
godlike feelings, heavenly attributes, holy
characteristics, confident souls, perfection of humanity
and sanctified and pure souls who are striving to spread
the spirit of harmony--holy above qualities (pertaining
to) nature and passion--spreaders of the fragrances of
God severed from all else save God, banners of union
and peace--signs of love and accord!
     Blessed are ye for organizing the assembly of
unity!  I ask God to confirm you by the divine aid and
strengthen you by the heavenly strength so that every
one of you may become a shining star by the light of
the love of God in the world, and banners moving by
the breezes of love and peace on the heights of glory
among mankind; and lamps brilliant by the lights of
eternal majesty on the assemblies of men.
     If ye keep firm in this path, ye will see by the eyes
of joy signs wherefore ye will thank your Forgiving
Lord, and will be confirmed by the hosts from the
Supreme Concourse and angels from the Kingdom of
El-Abha.

O ye+F1 longing ones!  O ye cheered ones!  O ye attracted

       God!
     Blessed are ye, for ye have removed the covering;
witnessed the lights of the Sun of Truth which is
shining from the horizon of bestowal; are attracted by
the fragrances sent forth from the garden of the Kingdom;
have arisen to praise the Lord of Grandeur and
Might, and have resolved to disseminate the teachings
of God in those vast and extensive regions!
     Truly I say unto you!  Verily, ye have cast away
superstitions; have partaken an abundant portion from
that Reality which is shining upon all regions; have
perceived the manifest signs, have entered the ark of
salvation and attained unto eternal life, under the
shadow of the Lord of Hosts, gazing unto the Most
Honorable Station, enkindled with the fire ablaze in
the tree of existence, in the spot of Sinai; responding to
the call of the Clement One, severed from the world,
and yearning for the place of sacrifice in the path of
Baha'.
     You will surely hear from this call a ringing voice
in the regions.  Then the nations will awake to this
effulgence and hasten unto the fountain of the Covenant;
so that they may drink fresh and salutary water
from the grace of your Lord, the Clement.
     At that time, the faithful shall be cheered, the sincere
shall rejoice and the yearning ones shall be drawn
unto the unseen world, the Kingdom of your Lord, the
Merciful!

ye in the divine confirmation, the merciful bounty and
the supreme bestowal.  Verily, He will confirm your
hearts, dilate your breasts, make your tongues fluent
and will rejoice your souls by a grace from the Compassionate
Merciful One!
     O ye beloved of Baha'!  Do not look at your weakness,
nay, rely upon the confirmation of the Holy Spirit.
Verily, It maketh the weak strong, the lowly mighty,
the child grown, the infant mature and the small great.
     I beg of God that He may make you diffusers of
His fragrances, servants of His Cause, gazers unto His
Face, speakers in His praise, and that He may protect
you against tests and trials, so that ye may become shining
lights, beaming stars, gleaming lamps and lofty
trees.  Verily, this is not difficult with God!
     Verily, I hope from God that ye may become my
associates in servitude to His Holy Threshold and my
partners at the entrance of the Door of His Oneness;
so that ye may equally serve in His great vineyard.
Then thank ye your Lord, for He hath favored you
with this manifest success.  By God, the True One!
this cannot be equalled either by the dominion of the
world or by the gift of ruling over all regions with
pomp, glory and power!  Reflect ye upon the chosen
ones of God in the earlier ages!  How their worth was
unknown during their days; how they were known by
people as but ordinary individuals and unimportant
persons!  Afterwards, their arguments appeared, their
lights scintillated, their stars beamed, their trees became
lofty, their mysteries gleamed forth, their fruits were
praised, their reservoirs became overflowing, their gardens


+P 275
adorned, their birds warbled and their joy became
perfect in the Kingdom of their Beneficent Lord.
     O my God!  O my God!  These are souls who have
advanced toward Thy Kingdom; their breasts dilated
by supplicating to Thy Realm of Might; their eyes
anticipating the descent of Thy mercy; and their spirits
rejoiced at Thy grace and gift!
     O my God!  O my God!  Guard them by the eye of
Thy protection, preserve them in the cave of Thy defence,
deliver them from the grade of the contingent
world, protect them during the violence of tests and
trials, and assist them by a power from the breath of
Thy Holy Spirit, in the world of existence!  Verily,
Thou art the Beneficent, the Mighty, the Clement!

O thou who art kindled by the Fire of Guidance which
       blazed and burnt in the Tree of Sinai!
     By the life of God, I am moved with joy by the
mention of the beloved and delighted in the love of the
elect!  And now, with a heart clear from aught else
save God and overflowing with the love of God, I
mention thee, supplicating God to make thee a lamp
of guidance in those districts, that out of thee the spirit
of knowledge may be spread upon the hearts and spirits
until thou becomest a spring of fresh and sweet water
whereto the thirsty and earnest desirers will come to
drink, and thus be satisfied with the sweetness thereof.
     Rejoice at this address which I hope from God will
have a great effect on thy heart and spirit and accordingly
become the banner of the Supreme Concourse in
that distant and extensive spot+F1 through which certain

O thou who art advancing toward God!
     Verily I read thy letter which thou hast sent through
Mrs. ........ and was rejoiced at its contents, which
indicated thy excessive love and thy great passion for
the Kingdom of God!
     O my friend!  Thank thou God for He hath illumined
thy sight with a radiance which is shining forth
from the Sun of Truth; hath quickened thee, and baptized
thee with the water of life and with the fire of
the love of god.
     I beg God to bless thee so that thou mayest diffuse
the fragrances of God in those countries and purify
hearts from the filth of ignorance and to make thy
revered wife and honored daughters signs of His love
among the maid-servants of God, and to ordain for
thee a reward befitting one who hath attained (the visit
of) the Holy Threshold in this Cause.
     Verily, I bestowed every kindness upon the maid-servant
of God, Mrs. ........, because she hath been
the cause of thy guidance, and hath given thee to drink
the cup of knowledge.

O thou who art firm in the Covenant!
     Supplicate God that thou mayest be confirmed to
what is worthy and fit for the Most Mighty Cycle.
     Deliver my respectful greeting to Mr. ........ and
refresh him with regards and affection.  Convey my
longing greeting to [Messrs.] ........., ........

the confirmation of the Supreme Kingdom and observe
the protection and preservation of His Highness the

overflowing with the wine of the love of God and at
all times I expect to hear good news of them.
     O thou dear friend!  Thou hast said the truth!
Last year+F1 was the time of test for all the friends.
Trials for the faithful believers are like unto divine
bestowal and everlasting gifts.
     The firmness and steadfastness of the person will
become evident and manifest.  How could the disciples
of His Holiness (Christ) attain to any spiritual development
if they did not undergo trials and tests!
     O friend!  Although we are weak, yet the confirmations
of the Merciful Lord are inexhaustible.  Pray
thou that the ill-natured become good-natured and the
weak become strong.
     The dream thou hast seen is in accord with thy interpretation.
I hope that Mr. ........ may become the
light of the Merciful One and be confirmed and assisted
to spread the Cause of God.

My God!  My God!  Elohim+F2 .
     To this Thy servant give the understanding of the
Old Testament and the New and enable her to speak

secret mysteries of those verses, for Thou art the
Powerful Inspirer and the Mighty One!

O maid-servant of God, thou who hast given up thy
       life to the service of the Kingdom of God!
     I have read the signs of thy thankfulness to God for
guiding thee to the way of the Lord, to the path of
salvation which leads to the Tent of the Testament
behind the Tabernacle in the Capital of the Kingdom.
     Know in the reality of assurance that every true
woman who is attracted by the fragrances of holiness
in this most glorious age will surpass even the most
developed men of previous centuries.
     It is incumbent upon thee to make thy greatest effort;
to put forth thy full strength; to supplicate and to
worship, and to be careful to put thy full trust in the
Kingdom of the Lord Most High.
     Make ready thy soul that thou mayest be like the
light which shineth forth from the loftiest heights on
the coast, by means of which guidance may be given to
the timid ships amid the darkness of fog and the
heaving of the sea.
     Then gain the knowledge of godliness and learn the
exact facts from the revered Abul Fazl+F1 , and, if it be
possible, remain there a few months.
     With regard to thy friend, send her to the sea coast
or accompany her to Marseilles and return to Cairo
that thou mayest learn the necessary proofs.
     Then return to America--this is in case it is possible
for thee.  If anything happens otherwise, the way is
open and it will be made convenient for thee--say

absolutely required.  And upon God let thy confidence
rest.

O thou who in truth art attracted through the Breaths
       of the Holy Spirit!
     I sent to thee a letter few in words and full in its
meanings and its mysteries, showing signs of good-tidings.
By my life, there are manifested meanings in
the mysteries of the words!
     At present I address thee in plain language without
being veiled, and I say to thee:  "Stand up with
all thy strength to guide the followers of negligence
and blindness, and diffuse the breaths of God in those
regions; and set off with all speed to New York and
Chicago and call with the loudest voice in the assemblies
of the beloved ones and invite them to the Alliance of
God; and make them steadfast in the Covenant of God,
and bear good-tidings to all the steadfast ones, and
inspire all who waver to be firm in the religion of God
and to resist all force with is against the Alliance of
God.  Verily I promise the confirmation of the Holy
Spirit to thee in those great assemblies whenever ye
argue upon the Covenant of God."

O thou who art attracted to the Kingdom of God!
     I hope thou wilt ride thy steed in this field as much
as thou canst and that thou mayest know nothing except
praising, worshiping and extolling the Sun of the World
of Creation.
     O maid-servant of God!  The radiance of favor is

is perfect and bounty is overflowing--the doors of
prosperity are opened and hearts are expanded and
dilated.  The drops of the cloud of favor are continually
(falling) and the lakes of graces are successively
overflowing.  The wine of the love of God is circulating,
and the melodies of thankful birds are astonishing
all people distant and near.  The radiance of the
Manifestor of the Mount is illuminating all hearts and
breasts and the never-ending bounties are successively
(flowing) from the divine Kingdom.  I hope that,
through the favor of the Blessed Perfection thou wilt
become the lamp of the society of Green Acre (Me.),
and wilt become the cup-bearer of the wine of the love
of God, thou wilt invite a great number of people into
the Kingdom of the Powerful Lord and wilt teach
numerous souls, thou wilt put the crown of the exalted
gift upon thy heard and wilt rule over the empire of the
greatest spirituality, and thou wilt become the envy of
the queens of all regions and wilt be the rival of all the
celebrated people of the world.

O thou who art wholly advancing unto God!
     Verily I have read thy letter in answer to mine and
praised God--may glory and dignity be unto Him!--
for by reason of which He hath kindled the lamp of
guidance in the glass of thy heart, lighted in thy breast
the fire of love and faithfulness, illumined thy face with

Be happy and rejoice at this speech through

dumb speak and the deaf hear; rather, the decayed
bones will be quickened and the rocks and stones be
affected.
     Remember my spiritual favors which have uninterruptedly
descended upon thee at the table which was
spread under the abundant gifts of the Kingdom of
God.  Verily, I continue supplicating God to make to
grow from the luxuriant garden of the heart the
aromatic plants of His knowledge, through the abundant
rain pouring froth from the clouds of His Kingdom,
the Most Great; that thou mayest be a herald of
the Covenant in those regions and a preacher of the
Kingdom of God in those distant isles.

to remove the veil from them and lift the covering
from before their faces, so that they may witness the
greatest signs of their Lord, the Great, in this day in

of his spiritual grades, and he was your companion in
your meetings and was bearing unto you, with his spiritual
tongue, the glad-tidings of the divine splendors
which shall be poured forth upon you from the Kingdom
of God, in a short time.
     O maid-servant of God!  Be rejoiced at this glad-tidings
whereby the hearts of the people of the Kingdom
of El-Abha are moved with joy.  Verily I beseech
God to make Green Acre as the paradise of El-Abha,
so that the melodies of the nightingale of sanctity may
be heard from it and that the chanting of the verses of
unity may be raised therein; to cause the clouds of the
great gift to pour upon it the rains falling from heaven;
to make those countries become verdant with the myrtles
of truth and inner significances and to plant therein
blessed trees, with the hand of Providence, which may
bring forth pure and excellent fruits wherefrom the
fragrances of God may be diffused throughout all regions.
These signs shall surely appear and these lights
shall shine forth.
     O maid-servant of God, the Merciful!  It is incumbent
upon you to unveil the covering and to witness the
Beauty of the Almighty!  Ye shall surely see the lights
rising in those parts, as ye have already seen them.  Ye
shall surely behold a Pillar of Fire extending upward to
the Supreme Apex and it will call unto you with the
most wonderful expression and will address you, saying:
     "I am the Ancient Light!  I am the Lord of the
Exalted Kingdom!   I am the Star shining forth unto
the horizon of the hearts of the people of Oneness!"
     O maid-servant of God!  Be tranquil in heart and be
enkindled with the fire ignited in the Blessed Tree--an


+P 285
enkindlement which may cause a fire to blaze in the
inanimate hearts in those regions.
     O maid-servant of God!  Be not disheartened if
thou hearest the murmuring of the deniers, the clamor
of the hypocrites, the shouting of the contradictors, the
barking of the furious, harmful dogs, in those climes.
Remember the persecutions which consecutively befell
the disciples of christ from the perverse Jews.  Consequently,
withstand their oppositions with all quiescence
and dignity (patience) and their contradictions with
all cheerfulness, gladness and dilation of heart (i.e.,
exaltation) by day and night.  Resist their fighting
with peace and reconciliation, their blows with kindness
and perfection and their blame with joy and tranquillity.
Do beseech God to direct them to the Path of Salvation
and breathe into them the Spirit of Life.  Be thou a
light to every darkness, a dispeller of every sadness, a
healer for every sick person, a quencher for every thirst,
a shelter for every refugee, a refuge for every captive.
If the Pharisees interfere with thee, it is incumbent
upon thee to implore God to guide them to the road of
salvation!  And it is incumbent upon thee to be affable
to them under all circumstances, to be patient in afflictions,
to be courteous with the enemies and to pray
for the hateful sinners!  This is the nature of the faithful
and convinced women believers whose hearts are
dilated with the fragrances of God and who instruct
(people) in the teachings of God!
     O maid-servant of God!  Trust in the grace of thy
Lord.  He shall surely assist thee with a confirmation
whereat minds will be amazed and the thoughts of the
men of learning will be astonished.  Consider the divine


+P 286
splendors in Green Acre:  One of them is the tree of
fire and another is what was witnessed by thy friend--
a light shining forth unto all sides.  This is through
the grace of thy Lord unto thee!  Consequently, be
engaged in perusing St. John's Revelation; all these
signs are spoken of in that vision.  Thou shalt soon
behold (things) still greater than this.
     O maid-servant of God!  It is incumbent upon thee
to diffuse the fragrances of God and to be occupied in
delivering (teaching) the Cause of God!  Deliver my
greeting to ........ and say unto them:  "Trust ye in
the grace of your Lord and thank your Master, for He
hath directed you to the Path of the Kingdom of God.
Verily He is the Assister, the Beneficent!"
     The coming of any one to these countries is, at this
time, difficult and unallowable.  I beg of God to facilitate
it and then we will permit ........ to come.  I
beg of God to manifest His lights in the heart of
........ so that he may apprehend that which he
never before apprehended and behold the mysteries of
the Kingdom with real certainty in this glorious age.
     God willing, next year some of the teachers (of the
Truth) will present themselves at Green Acre and will
cause the voices of the people of the Kingdom to reach
the Supreme Apex.

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God and
       enkindled with the Fire wherein Moses, the
       Speaker, found Guidance!
     May it be salutary to thee, the draught from this
cup, which is overflowing with the wine of the love of
God.


+P 287
     Blessed art thou, that thy heart is connected with the
callings of the Kingdom of El-Abha, so that thou
hast dispensed with the telepathic wires of the world,
because the terminal of the spiritual wire reached the
center of thy heart and the other is placed in the
Spiritual Center, vibrating informations constantly
through the power of the Spirit and successively conveying
the great glad-tidings.  This is the station of
(or for) every maid-servant whose heart is filled with
the love of God and attracted to the Beauty of El-Abha.
     Thank God for showing unto thee and thy dear
friend, the revered ........, the great power and
might of the Kingdom personified in the body of
humanity, and that thou didst worship Him with a
brilliant heart, and He addressed thee (saying):
"Peace be unto thee!  Peace be unto thee!"  His white
vestment is the garment of the Manifestation and [His]
brilliant color.  Regarding the gems which appeared on
His breast, they are peerless pearls of wisdom which
shine unto the horizons with a godlike fame.  As to His
shining face, verily it hath illumined the earth and
dispersed the darkness from the contingent world.
Regarding thine entrance with thy friend into the gallery
lighted with lamps, know thou that gallery is the
world of humanity and the lamps His wonderful teaching,
His all-wisdom, His perfect bounty and His clear
manifestation.  He is the Absent-Present in the world
of humanity.
     O maid-servant of God!  It is incumbent upon thee
to diffuse the fragrances, it is incumbent upon thee to


+P 288
promulgate the teachings of God and it is incumbent
upon thee to breathe the spirit of life into the hearts
of the people of those regions, so that thou be a lamp
of guidance in the recess of Green Acre.  Take the
cup of the love of God in thy right hand and with thy
left hand hoist the banner of universal peace, love and
affection among the nations of the earth.  Call out
(saying):  "Hasten!  Hasten unto the Great Bounty!
Press!  Press forward unto the Abundant Mercy!
Speed!  Speed unto the Manifest Light!  Be urgent!
Be urgent for the Great Attainment!  Verily, by God
the Truth, the doors of the Kingdom are opened, the
lights of god have shown forth and illumined the
horizon of the earth!  The Lord of Hosts hath descended
with the army of lights and angels of heaven
and depressed the armies of darkness!  He sent His
angels to all directions, with a call of the trumpet of
realities and meanings, instructions and teachings!
Therefore, O people of the earth, appreciate the opportunity,
in this new century, wherein the lights have
been revealed by the Glorious Lord!"
     In regard to the school which tho didst think of
and its organization:  I ask God that thou shouldst
become confirmed in it with all order and command.
But now it is necessary first to organize the Cause of
God in those countries; then, order and preparation.
Therefore arise, through a power from God, in organizing
the Cause of God--that is, the diffusion of the
fragrances of God, promotion of the Word of God
and heralding unto the nations and peoples with a pre-existent
power the appearance of the Most Great Sun.


+P 289

O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!
     Verily I read thy excellent letter and was dilated
through its excellent contents.  Know thou that the
distance of habitation doth not prevent the rising of
the lights, and that time and place only control the
bodies and not the spirits which are free from the contingent
beings, not (do they control) the realities which
are sanctified from the stains of the world.  When
the Spirit is breathed in the East, its signs immediately
appear in the West and it hath a spiritual dominion
which penetrates the pillars of the world.
     Then know thou that God hath not ordained any
greater happiness and joy than the removing of the
veils by witnessing the Kingdom of God and presenting
oneself in an assembly which is radiant with merciful
emotions which cannot be apprehended by minds
and thoughts.
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily opposition will wax
fierce upon thee and denial and unbelief will day by
day increase.  People will arise to oppression and people
will torment thee for thou hast believed in God, art
attracted to the fragrances of God and hath spoken
His praise among the maid-servants.  They will
execrate, revile, curse and oppress thee with acute
tongues.  Be not distressed at this; nay, rather continue
with an increased firmness and stanchness in the Cause
of God.  For through calamity the heart of Abdul-Baha
is attracted; through (suffering) oppression the
breast of Abdul-Baha is dilated; through enduring afflictions
the faithfulness of Abdul-Baha is proven;
through imprisonment the soul of Abdul-Baha is


+P 290
cheered; at every moment he wishes to quaff the cup
of sacrifice in the path of God.
     O maid-servant of God!  Opposition shall surely
pass away, the dark clouds in all regions will be dispelled
and the lights of the Covenant shall shine forth.
At that time your value shall appear among the nations
of the world and tribes and people will arise to praise
you.  Take warning by the former cycles and the bygone
Manifestations.
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily the Cause is great
and great!  Regiments and regiments enter therein!
Some people must necessarily turn their backs upon it,
on account of their lack of sincerity in he Cause of
god and for their selfishness and egotism.
     O maid-servant of God!  A pure sea doth not accept
a dead body, therefore the waves will necessarily throw
the dead finally upon the shores.
     O maid-servant of God!  When some souls turn
away from the love of God, there is no harm therein.
Did not Judas Iscariot, the chief of the apostles, turn
away on account of jealousy for Peter the apostle?
Likewise, some people must necessarily turn away on
account of jealousy for others.
     As to thee:  Consider the predecessors as a warning
to posterity and purify thy heart from all else save
God, under all circumstances.  When thou was in Acca
we pointed this out to thee.
     O maid-servant of God!  Whenever sorrows and
afflictions grow violent toward thee, remember that
which we told thee during thy presence in these lands;
then thy sorrows shall be removed and thy heart shall


+P 291
become dilated through the fragrances of God in these
days.
     Be thou rejoiced at the glad-tidings of God!  Be
as a globe of fire from which the heat of the love of
God will be diffused.  Sanctify thyself from the grades
of this world, be purified from the superstitions of
people and be characterized with spiritual qualities.  Be
thou a mountain of quiescence, a sign of meekness, a
sea of patience, a light of love, a standard of utter
separation (from all else save God), so that thou
mayest become everlasting in the Kingdom of God.
     The light shall surely encompass the maid-servants
who are attracted by the fragrances of God and it will
shine forth from their faces upon all regions.
     O maid-servant of God!  Let thy joy and happiness
be increased every moment through the light of God.
     Verily, the Exalted Leaf and the brilliant Leaves+F1
remember thee by night and day.  Then know thou,
verily the prison is my wonderful paradise in love for
Baha'; it is my lofty stronghold, my impregnable mansion
and glorious throne.  Be not grieved thereat, nay,
rather beg of God to make me quaff the cup of sacrifice
in the path of Baha'.

O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!
     I am already informed of the import of thy wonderful
letter and the meanings of thine excellent words.
I was rejoiced to find how it expressed that thou art
devoted to God, turning unto the Supreme Horizon,

enkindled with the fire of the love of God and attracted
to the fragrances of God.
     I beg of God to increase thy separation from the
world, thy supplication before the Kingdom of God
and thy yearning for the Beauty of God.
     What thou hast said (in thy letter) concerning the
servant of Baha', the "Mother of the Faithful," is but
true.  Verily she is purified in soul, enkindled by the
fire of the love of God, hath sincerely turned unto her
Master, hath completely faced toward the Kingdom of
God and hath arisen to diffuse His fragrances in all
parts and serve His friends with a sincerity and joy
unto which the Supreme Concourse beareth witness.
She shall surely have a firm and steady footing in the
Cause of God, her face shall shine forth from the
Horizon of Loftiness, her fame shall be spread in the
Kingdom of God, and [she] shall have a ringing voice
throughout regions, and the lights of her glorious deeds
shall beam forth during cycles and ages.
     As to ........ and ........, verily the faces of
these are as the pupil of the eye; although the pupil
is created black, yet it is the source of light.  I hope
God will make these black ones the glory of the white
ones and as the depositing of the lights of love of God.
And I ask God to assist them in all circumstances, that
they may be encompassed with the favors of their
Loving Lord throughout centuries and ages.
     As to ........, verily God hath ordained for her
a noble station.  The lights of knowledge shall surely
shine forth from her face upon the world.  Verily she is
attracted to the word of her Lord, was dilated by


+P 293
hearing the speech of Abdul-Baha at the time of meeting
and her eyes became consoled by witnessing the
signs of her Mighty Lord.
     As to the maid-servant of God ........:  God
hath indeed favored her with an excellent disposition
which is like fragrance from a garden of the Merciful
and she passeth her days in serving the Cause of God.
I beg of God to confirm and assist her under all aspects
and circumstances.
     As to the son of the "Mother of the Faithful":  I
beg of God to make his ears attentive, his eyes observing,
his heart abounding with the lights of guidance and
to make his soul as one of the signs of his Mighty
Lord.  Pray ye in his behalf night and day that God
may strengthen him in a matter which may shine, beam
and glow in the niche of the Kingdom of God and
that He may cause him to arise and assist the pious
ones, to seek bounty from the signs, to gain illumination
from the lights, deliver the necks of all men from
the chains of superstition, to feed the needy ones upon
the food of the Kingdom of God and support the weak
ones with a penetrative power from the Word of God.
Verily thy Lord is the Confirmer!

O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!
     We have written a clear and efficient answer to
........ out of the love for thee and for her; otherwise
Abdul-Baha is free from any other mention than
that of God.
     As to thee, be not grieved at anything whatever.
There is a right wisdom in whatever happens in this


+P 294
great Cause.  Be not grieved if the trash of the world
is decreased in thy hands, for thy brilliant heart is a
great treasury, inasmuch as every heart which trusts in
the grace of its Lord is illumined through the lights
of its Creator and it is one of the treasuries of the
Kingdom, filled with the wealth of His divine world
and heavenly bounties.  This is a great wealth!
     Deliver my greetings to ........ and announce to
him the glad-tidings of God and say unto him:  "This
day is the day of soaring and the day of shining.  This
day is the day of the Ancient Honor, Abundant
Wealth, Mighty Dominion and Great Gift.  Appreciate
thou its value and do not neglect it, so that thou
mayest attain to that which was longed for by the holy
ones in bygone ages and centuries."

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily I read thy letter which indicated thy knowledge
of the significances of the Revelation of St. John.
I ask God to enlighten thine eyes by witnessing His
lights which have illumined the horizon of existence to
eternity of eternities.  Praise God that He manifested
unto thee the brilliancy of the Sun of Truth which is
shining from the Kingdom of El-Abha; and God made
thee look with divine eyes at the reality of revelation.
Rest assured the light of the love of God will envelope
the world with great illumination.
     O maid-servant of God!  May God increase thy
glowing with the fire of His love and by a light from
the rays of the Sun of the Universe.
     O maid-servant of God!  Raise the call at Green


+P 295
Acre, summon all unto the Kingdom of God whose
lights shone forth, fragrances wafted, clouds changed
into tears (or drops of rain) and guardians smiled.

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily I read thy last letter and gathered from its
meanings the mysteries of thy great love.  I supplicate
to my Lord that He may at every moment increase
thy joy and fragrance, thy speech and utterance, thine
attraction and enkindlement, and that He may heal thee
from the infirmities which have affected thee and weakened
thy feeble body, and strengthen thee to guide mankind
into the Supreme Kingdom and quicken hearts by
the fragrances of the Paradise of Abha, so that thou
mayest become a bird warbling upon the twigs of the
Tree of Life, with most wonderful melodies and most
charming tunes.

O thou artery pulsating in the body of the world!
     Verily I read thy recent letter which indicated conscious
joy and abundant happiness from the glad-tidings
of the Kingdom of El-Abha.  Know, verily
that the feast is the day wherein God opened thine insight
through the Manifest Light, showed thee unto
His Great Kingdom and granted to thee to drink from
the chalice overflowing with the wine of divine guidance
among the maid-servants.  Is there a feast more
happy and more noble than this?  No, indeed, by the
Lord of Heaven, it is a day wherein the thirsty one
attaineth to the Spring from which gusheth forth cool
and refreshing water, the lover meeteth his Loved One
and the sick one is healed by the remedy of the Physician.
Blessed art thou for attaining unto this!


+P 296
     Verily, the people who rejoice in the day of the feast
and enjoyed the tree+F1 (which) was decorated, following
the custom of ancient times, are the people of superstitions.
By the Majesty of thy Lord!  Were they
in the time of Christ, they would turn their backs and
would not behold His smiling, glorious face; but today
they play in the shallow waters of their superstitions
without discretion.
     Therefore, thank God for His having privileged
thee to attain nearness to the Blessed Tree which is
grown upon the highest Sinai and is set aglow with the
fire of God's love, calling unto responsive listeners.  I
supplicate God to heal thee from all troubles and diseases
and make thee a sign of guidance and a standard
of the Supreme Concourse in those regions and particularly
at Green Acre.

O thou esteemed maid-servant of the Loving Lord!
     What thou hast written in recommendation of a
number of Christians was perused.  Although the presence
of these persons will, in these times, cause the
revolt of the heedless ones and increase the trouble,
yet for your sake we will send them a telegram to
Egypt and permit them to come and visit.  This is but
for thy sake, and Abdul-Baha cannot endure to meet
but the people of the Merciful and does not wish to
be in union except with the heavenly ones.
     O thou chosen maid-servant of God!  It is time for
thee to cry aloud and fervently, day and night, not to
sit still a moment, not to rest for an instant, but to

be always engaged in the commemoration of God and

     Raise thou such melodies and harmony in Green Acre
that may reach unto the Kingdom of Abha and cause
joy and exaltation in the angels of heaven!  This
matter needs a great enthusiasm (heat or exertion)
and a sanctity and purity like unto a manifest light.
Thou knowest what secrets doeth the spirit of Abdul-Baha
communicate with thee and what glad-tidings he
giveth unto thee!  Show forth thy capacity and merit,
for without capacity the Gift doth not become manifest.

O thou dear maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter was excellent and its contents were perfect
and complete.  Happy is thy condition for that thou
hast not forgotten the time of thy visit+F1 , nay, at every
instant thou hast grown in this thought and art remembering
the exhortations of Abdul-Baha and wishing in
thy soul to put them thoroughly into practice.  Praise
be to God that thou hast kept steadfast with all firmness
under the millstone of tests like unto a grain of
diamond.  Be not grieved; tests lead to the development
of holy souls and the ardor of the flame of fire
causeth the pure gold to shine and the violence of winds
is conducive to the growth and thriving of a firm and
well rooted tree.
     If the earthen house and mortal dwelling-place was
burned+F2 , yet I hope that thou mayest build thy nest and
abode, like unto the birds of holiness, in the Tree of
Life in the Divine Kingdom.***

     As to the catalogue of the book of which thou has

book:
     "Although thou hast exerted the utmost endeavors
in compiling this book and hast written the life of His
Kingdom Christ and His blessed sayings--and this
service and labor deserve favor--yet these are events
of former times and all that is past is of a different
effect.  If thou art a hero of the field and a melodious
bird in the garden of the Merciful One, speak of the
Beauty of Abha, for it is ready and present.  consider
that the last year's springtime is past and all that
thou mayest say or hear (about it) is but a story (or
narrative); but appreciate thou this New Year's Spring
--which is this present time--hath pitched its tent with
the utmost magnificence in the field and plain and hath
made the mountain and desert verdant and fresh, hath
made the trees to appear pure and fresh, blooming with
flowers and blossoms through the vernal bounty and
caused them to bring forth pure fruits.  Nor all that
thou mayest speak of the past springtime, be it even
spoken with all excellence and eloquence and in accord
with reality, all that will, nevertheless, be a past story.
     "Do thou not abandon that which is ready in the
present time until thou mayest gain the result and gather
fruits from the garden of thy hopes and wishes.

Otherwise, thy book is a book of history--it will be
concluded and forgotten.  Harken unto me (i.e., take
my advice):  One single ready drop is better than a
sea which is past.  More especially, this New Cause
is like unto a sea, while all those which are past were
like unto rivers."

O bird without a nest!
     It is reported thy home and shelter is burnt, thy resting
place and habitation is become desolate.  Though
this news is greatly affecting, yet do not be sorrowful
and disheartened, because the birds of the divine gardens
have nests on the branches of the Tree of Life.
The earthly abode is not worth the attachment of the
heart, for this structure will surely be destroyed, but
that which is of worth to freed ones (detached from
all save God) is the heavenly palace and the court of
Divine Majesty.  Thanks be to God that for each one
of the divine freed slaves and the heavenly and dear
maid-servants, and indestructible mansion will be erected
in the New Kingdom.  This mansion will be an
everlasting dwelling, an eternal abode and shelter.
     There is a hidden wisdom in the burning of the
house which before long will be clearly known.  Divine
attractions and heavenly bounties alone cause happiness
to the hearts.
     Use your utmost endeavors to dwell in the thought
that in Green Acre this year the divine proclamation
will be raised to the heavenly zenith and the lights
of the supreme guidance will enlighten those regions.
     Be sure that heavenly assistance will be given and


+P 300
that the breeze of the Divine Garden will perfume the
nostrils of the inhabitants of the earth.  Some of the
weak souls thought that this dear maid-servant of God
was attached to this house and to this perishable world.
Now the house is burnt, all will realize that thy attraction
is increasing, thy steps are drawing near, thy
flag is raised higher and thy condition more excellent.
Show forth such happiness and joy that all will be astonished.

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of the
       Kingdom of El-Abha!
     I read thy letter which was beautifully composed and
which indicated that thy delicate body hath gained rest.
I send thee the answer spiritually so that the signs of
the address may become manifest in thy heart.  Verily
thou art with me in spirit at all times.  I ask God to
make thee follow my example in establishing the Kingdom
of Unity and Peace and building up the Dominion
of Love and Faith which was founded by the
Beauty of El-Abha.  Rest and repose are necessary for
thee in these days; be thou composed in all conditions.
Thou art with me under all circumstances.  Then
thank God for His guidance unto thee.  He hath made
thee drink from a cup overflowing with the wine of His
love in the world.  I ask God to make thee the essence
of holiness and purity among the maid-servants of the
Merciful--thus thou mayest be a brilliant flame in the

Among such ideas those which owe their source
to the Light of Truth will be realized in the outward
world; while others of a different origin vanish, come
and go like waves on the sea of imagination and find
no realization in the world of existence.
     "Similarly, numerous, various meetings and assemblages
have been organized during the past ages and bygone
centuries.  All these produced no result except
those assemblages which rendered unmixed service to
the Light of Truth; from such assemblages alone great
results were realized in the world of existence.
     "For instance, consider how many a thousand assemblages--
religious, political and literary--have been
organized in India, Persia, Turkestan, Chinese countries
and, in a word, in every part of Asia.  All these
gave no result except that assemblage of the disciples
of Christ on the mount fifty days after Christ's ascension.
all that hath since been effected along the line of
diffusing the holy fragrances of Christ, uplifting the
Word of God, spreading the Gospel, training souls and
guiding the people, hath been wholly from the result
of the effects produced by that assemblage of the disciples.
Those effects are continual even in the present

that that assemblage will yield no result and will,
before long, be forgotten and consigned to oblivion,
similar to other meetings of bygone times.
     "I beg of God that that esteemed maid-servant of
God shall be the cause of spreading the Cause of God,
so that the Light of Truth may shine and the world be
illumined.
     "When you reflect attentively, you will find that the
Word is what we have hereby said and that all else
save this is pure imagination, is of no stability and is
evanescent.
     "The tree must have roots in order to yield fruit.
The trees of the forest of Asia have yielded no fruit
for thousands of years, except the blessed Trees of the
Divine Manifestations, for each one of these Trees
hath so developed and flourished that it hath trained
and nourished the whole earth with fruits and yields."

O thou beloved maid-servant of God!
     What thou hast written was considered.  It indicated
purity of heart and advancement toward God.
     O thou maid-servant of the Blessed Perfection!  Be
thou not sad, neither be thou unhappy, although the
divine tests are violent, yet are they conducive to the
life of the soul and the heart.  The more often the pure


+P 303
gold is thrown into the furnace of test, the greater will
become its purity and brilliancy and it will acquire a
new splendor and brightness.  I hope that thou art thyself
in such a position.
     Consider thou the lives of the former sanctified souls;
what tests have they not withstood and what persecutions
have they not beheld; while they were surrounded
with calamities they increased their firmness and while
they were overwhelmed with tests they manifested more
zeal and courage.  Be thou also like unto them.
     The utmost favor is shown toward thee and the
divine bounties are thy guide.  endeavor thou, as far
as thou canst, in order that thou mayest be like unto
a chaste and clear mirror, cleansed and purified from
every dust, so that the outpouring of the rays of the
Sun of Truth may descend and thou mayest illumine
those who are around thee.  This is my counsel to thee.
I pray always in thy behalf and supplicate for thy confirmation
and assistance, in order that thou mayest become
a sign of the Most Great Bounty and be the cause
of the guidance of many souls.  If thou art mindful,
seek thou the favor everlasting and the illumination
eternal.  Do thou some work, that thou mayest become
favored in the Threshold of the Almighty and
a beloved maid-servant of the Blessed Perfection, in
the Kingdom.
     His honor ........ hath delivered thy message.
I entreat God that thine utmost hopes and desires may
become realized.
     Every one in the Holy Household is engaged in thy
remembrance and sends thee their longing greeting.


+P 304
     Convey to ........ my respectful greeting and
announce to him:  "No matter how brilliant a receding
star is, its light never reaches to this world.  Worship
thou the newly ascendant Shining Luminary whose
lights are glittering and whose proof is self-evident.
Become thou the cause of guidance of the person whom
thou art respecting.  No matter how much endeavor
and effort is shown, a tree which hath been in existence
for two thousand years or more will never bring new
and fresh fruits.  This is the truth and there is nothing
beyond the truth but manifest error."

O thou who art favored in the Kingdom of the
       almighty!
     The letter that thou hast written with the utmost
eloquence, compassion, humility and submission of heart
and spiritual emotions, hath been read.
     If the people live and act in accord with the General
Tablets which are revealed to the beloved of the East
and of the West, this universe will become another
universe and the whole existence of this world will be
clad in another garment.  You must encourage and reinforce
the beloved of God and the maid-servants of
the Merciful that they may live and act in accord with
the teachings in the General Tablets.
     Consider thou how vast is the arena of the Kingdom
--it hath environed the whole world.  The splendor
of Providence hath encircled all races, nations, communities
and religions; the foundation of foreignness
is swept away and the basis of Oneness is established;
love hath become universal and the spiritual ties are
strengthened.***


+P 305
O thou favored maid-servant of God!
     The meeting which thou hast formed and therein assembled
the faithful (or believers) together and engaged
with them in the commemoration of God, caused
the Supreme Concourse to praise and the angels of
heaven to applaud.
     Be thou a cause of unifying hearts as much as thou
canst and guide thou the heedless souls, and in this
spiritual springtime perfume thou nostrils with the
sweet fragrances of the rose-garden of the Kingdom.
This is eternal life; this everlasting Glory!  And this
is a peace which is not followed by any trouble!  All
else save this is a plaything of children and is useless
and nonsense!

O thou who art advancing towards the Shining Orb of
       the Horizons!
     Verily, the East and West have already glittered
through the light which is shining forth from the
Horizon of the mercy of thy Lord, the Clement, the
Merciful, but the blind are still in great error.
     The Call of God is already raised throughout all
concourses of the earth; but the deaf are still muffled
in thick veils.  All things have already uttered the
praise of God; but the dumb are still continuing in their
astounding silence.
     As to thee:  Listen to the Supreme Concourse and
hear the call, "Glory be unto my Lord, the El-Baha!"

O thou who art spreading the Cause of God!
     I hope thou wilt become as a rising light and obtain
spiritual health--and spiritual health is conducive to


+P 306
physical health--so that thou mayest be enabled to
liquidate thy debts and be strengthened to attain the
blessing of the Forgiving Lord; that thou mayest become
a mirror of truth and reveal the spiritual brilliancy
of the heavenly universe to all eyes, direct large
numbers of people under the shadow of the Powerful
Lord and guide all thy family and relations unto the
Greatest Guidance; and that thou mayest be honored
with a visit to the Holy Threshold after having attained
to all these gifts.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     Acquire the Persian tongue, so as to learn of the
meanings of the divine words and to know the divine
mysteries, to develop an eloquent speech and to translate
the blessed Tablets of Baha'o'llah.  The Persian
language shall become noteworthy in this cycle; nay,
rather, the people shall study it in all the world.

O thou rose of the Rose-Garden of the Love of God!
     His Holiness Christ--may my spirit be His sacrifice!
--said in the Gospel, "Many are called, but few
chosen."  That is, many have been invited to faith, but
few chosen for guidance.  Praise be to God that thou
wert of the chosen, realized the Day of the Lord, heard
the divine Call and attained the Light of Reality!  Endeavor
and make an effort that certain souls may be
trained, of whom His Holiness Christ said, "Ye shall
know the tree by its fruits."  That is to say, every soul
is known by (his) conduct, manners, words and deeds.
Therefore, we must strive with life and heart that, day
by day, our deeds may be better, our conduct more


+P 307
beautiful and our forbearance greater.  That is, to cultivate
love for all the world; to attain beatific character.
     O maid-servant of God!  Study Persian and acquire
it more day by day, for by the study of this language
great and boundless results are obtained.
     Convey greeting and praise to thy revered mother
and also to all thy sisters.  I hope that all may become
bright as the candle through the light of the love of
God.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     Be happy for thou hast found guidance, witnessed
the light of Truth and hearkened unto the exhortations
of Abdul-Baha.  Though the worth and value of this
gift is not apparent and manifest in this world of mortality,
in the divine world this gift is abundantly radiant
and brilliant.  Thou shall of course perceive (or
behold) this.
     I have not forgotten thee nor will I do so, and I
always beg of God that thou wilt day by day increase
in love and that thy heart will become more illuminated.
I was rejoiced with the kindness shown by the dear
maid-servants ........ toward .........  For God
hath guided the maid-servants of the Merciful in order
for kindness (to appear) so that they may become a
mercy to all mankind (or all the creatures) and a gift
to the world of humanity.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     The tongues have spoken of thy attraction to God
and the pens testified of thy burning by the fire of the
love of God.  Indeed the heart of Abdul-Baha approveth


+P 308
of this, because it feeleth its heat from this
distant and Blessed Spot.
     O maid-servant of God!  By God, the Truth, the
Spirit of Christ from the Supreme Concourse doth
in every time and aspect announce to thee this great
good news.
     Be, therefore, a divine bird, proceed to thy native
country, spread the wings of sanctity over those spots
and sing and chant and celebrate the name of thy Lord,
that thou mayest gladden the Supreme Concourse and
make the seeking souls hasten unto thee as the moths
hasten to the lamp, and thus illumine that distant country
by the light of God.

O thou bird warbling in the Garden of the Love of
       God!
     Thank God that He hath illumined thine insight,
led thee unto the Fire glowing in the Tree of Man,
caused thee to utter His praise among the creatures
and guided certain women to whom thou delivered the
Word of God.
     O maid-servant of god!  Verily thy Lord lighteth
the lamp of love in the heart of whomsoever He chooseth.
This is indeed the great happiness.  He confirmeth
him in the service of His Supreme Vineyard.
     I pray God to confirm the relatives in attaining to
the Brilliant Light, to let the light of insight shine
forth to the hearts and sights, to aid thy friends in being
illumined by the light of El-Baha and [being] fed
from the heavenly table, and to make thee empty, void
from the thoughts of the life of this world and filled


+P 309
with the love of thy Lord, ready for His service, uttering
His praise and demonstrating with proofs the appearance
of the Kingdom of God.

O thou who art conscious!
     At last thou didst learn of the path of salvation and
didst find the straight way.  Now remain firm that
thou mayest attain confirmation and victory.
     The powers of the sympathetic nerve are neither
entirely physical nor spiritual, but are between the two
(systems).+F1  The nerve is connected with both.  Its
phenomena shall be perfect when its spiritual and physical
relations are normal.
     When the material world and the divine world are
well co-related, when the hearts become heavenly and
the aspirations grow pure and divine, perfect connection
shall take place.  Then shall this power produce
a perfect manifestation.  Physical and spiritual diseases
will then receive absolute healing.
     The exposition is brief.  Ponder and thou shalt understand
the meaning.  Although, on account of lack
of time, the answer is short, by close reflection it shall
be made long.

O thou who art advancing to the Kingdom of God!
     On perusing the contents of thy brilliant letter, I
became cognizant of the secrets of thy heart, which is
illumined by the clear light.
     Verily, I supplicate my Lord to cause to descend
upon thee an abundant grace of the spirit of His Holiness,


------------------------
1.        to question of a physician regarding the sympathetic nervous system
2.    of the human organism.
+P 310
that thine eyes may become clear and thy  mind
rejoiced by the gift which hath shone over all regions.
     Know that the poor people hasten by parties to the
Kingdom of God; the weak become mighty before thy
Lord, and the slaves when entering the shadow of thy
Lord attain the station of masters, lords and freed
slaves in the presence of God.
     Grieve not because of my confinement, for it is a
joy to my heart, a pleasure to my spirit, a good news to
my soul, an utmost desire of my hope, an intended
aim of my aspiration; because it is a confinement in the
path of God, the Lord of the worlds.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     I have read thy letter which indicated thy straightforwardness
in the love of God and thy desire in spreading
this brilliant light among the offspring of the
Africans.  How good is the intention!  And what an
excellent aim this great aim is!  Indeed the hearts of
the Africans are as a blank scroll of paper upon which
thou canst write any phrase; but thou must have patience
and a heart as firm as a mountain, owing to the
innumerable hardships that may intervene, which could
be endured only by one who surrenders to grievous
calamities.
     If thou art of the people of this field (race-course)
let loose the reins and rely upon the Merciful, and He
will indeed assist thee with the hosts of the unseen at
all times.  Use thy utmost power to affiliate the hearts
and, with the whole of thy might, bring the scattered
souls into union.***


+P 311
     Look not unto thy weakness, but rely upon thy Lord,
and He will then grant thee all thy desires and reveal
to thee the answer without asking.

O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!
     Thou hast said aright, that verily, Abdul-Baha looketh
to deeds and not to words.  Even as it was said by
Christ, "Ye shall know them by their fruits."
     Be not grieved if the affairs are made difficult and
troubles have waxed intense upon thee from all sides!
Verily thy Lord changeth the hardships into facility,
troubles into ease and afflictions into greatest composure.
Verily, thy Lord is on the right path!
     Tests and trials shall soon arise, blessed are those
who endure patiently!  Blessed are those who keep
firm!  Be patient, that thou mayest be rendered victorious
in thy greatest wishes, and know thou that verily,
thou art with me in the nearness of my Lord, the Supreme!
     Verily, this is a glad-tidings unto thee forevermore!

O thou who art controlled by the attraction of the Fragrances
       of God!
     I perused thy letter which speaks of thy love to God
and thine attraction to the Beauty of God, and I became
cheered in heart by its beautiful contents.  In my previous
letter to thee it was my intention to point out to
thee that in the way of exalting the Word of God there
are tests and trials, and in His love there are at all
times calamities and afflictions and sufferings.  Therefore,
it behooveth one to first ponder over these calamities


+P 312
and wistfully accept them, then undertake to spread
the fragrances of God and exalt His Word.  At that
time, whatever may befall him in the love of God, of
reproach, persecution, reviling, abuse, insult, beating,
imprisonment or assassination, will not offend him;
rather it will augment his attraction to the Beauty of
God.  This was what I intended previously.  Otherwise,
woe and misery to the soul which hunts after comfort,
luxury, wealth and affluence, while it is remiss of
the mention of God; because calamity in the path of
God is a favor to Abdul-Baha.
     In one of the Tablets the Beauty of El-Abha sayeth,
"I never passed by a tree that my heart did not address
it, saying, `Would that thou was cut in My Name, that
upon thee my body should be crucified!'"
     This is that which was uttered by the Greatest Name.
This is His Path!  This is the evidence of His Great
Kingdom!

O thou who art commemorating the Name of God!
     Verily, I read thy interesting letter and my heart
was made happy by its beautiful contents.
     O maid-servant of God!  Rest assured in the bounty
of thy Lord and place thy confidence in Him, for He
will confirm thee in all aspects and under all conditions.
     Know, verily, that the seed, however virile it may be,
however strong the hand of the sower, however pure
the water that watereth it, it is impossible for it to
grow, blossom and bear fruit in a short time; nay a
long period is needed for its development.
     So is the Kingdom of God.  Consider the seed which


+P 313
was sown by Christ; verily, it did not blossom until
after a long period.  Thus it is incumbent upon thee
to be patient in all affairs.  Verily thy Lord is powerful,
forgiving, precious and persevering!  Depend upon the
favor of thy LOrd.  He shall bless thee and protect thee
under the shadow of His generosity and mercy.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     I supplicate and implore my Lord to strengthen thee
by the Spirit of Life, make thee enter the Ark of Safety,
and show thee the evident signs; that the veils of the
people of suspicion may be rent asunder and the brilliant
proof of God become manifest to all regions, and
thy heart be made a clear mirror wherein are printed
the Lights of the Kingdom of the earth and heaven.

O thou who art remembered by Abdul-Baha!
     Thy letter which is couched in graceful words hath
given me joy and happiness, for it showeth how thou
art controlled by the attraction of the fragrances of
God and how thou art kindled by the flame of fire that
burneth in the Tree of Sinai.
     Blessed art thou because of this great bounty and
manifest abundance!  Verily, by day and by night I
do mention thee and thy daughter who is the delight of
thine eye, and supplicate God to make you both two
burning lamps, shining at the meetings of the maid-servants
of God, spreading the light of knowledge,
burning the moth of imaginations and surmise and removing,
through the light of manifest evidences and
peremptory proofs, the darkness of suspicions.


+P 314
O thou whose heart is moved by a breeze blowing from
       the Garden of El-Abha!
     Thy elegant and terse letter, couched in graceful
words, was read by me.  I rejoiced at the fragrances
of love, which being scented from the verdant gardens
of the Paradise of El-Abha, have cheerfully moved
thee.
     O maid-servant of God!  Be submissive to thy Lord,
humble to His servants and compliant to his maid-servants.
Overcome passions and desires, purify the
heart from remembrance of aught save that of thy
Lord, the Precious, the Gracious, and be controlled by
the attraction of the Beauty of God, that His remembrance
may run as the spirit in thy blood veins and
limbs, and thus fill thee with the thoughts of the love of
God.
     O maid-servant of God!  Ignite the fire of love in
the hearts which are remiss of the mention of God that
they may become awakened by the breath of God, and
quickened by His Spirit in this Great Day.

O thou attracted maid-servant of God!
     Verily, I bow my face to the dust of the Threshold of
El-Baha and to Him who sitteth on the Throne, I
petition as a supplicating captive, begging Him to make
thee to behold His Glorious Face and to purify thine
insight from aught else save Him among the people.
Verily, He is the refuge of all and our Great Protection!
     We are all poor at His Door, weak before His Power,
lowly at His Threshold, and we possess the power


+P 315
of neither good nor harm.  He is indeed the Confirmer,
the Strengthener, the Benevolent!
     Truly hath He opened before our faces the doors of
the Kingdom, granted us the treasures of His mysteries
through the divine bounty and He hath chosen us
for His love, for attainment unto His lights, the study
of His teachings, the spreading of His name, the guidance
unto His path and service in His great vineyard.
I pray for confirmation in thy behalf and thou shouldst
pray for strength on my part.  Thy prayers for me
should be that I may attain martyrdom in His path,
that my spirit may be His sacrifice, and that my blood
may be shed for His love.
     O maid-servant of God! verily, I long for that cup,
which is overflowing with the bounty of God, as a patient
desiring to be healed, as a thirsty soul seeking
water, as the poor in quest of wealth, and as one in
separation yearning after the meeting of the beloved
one night and day.

O thou who art advancing to the Kingdom of God!
     Verily, I pray God to make thee the sign of guidance
among the maid-servants of the Merciful, to enkindle
in thy heart a spark of that fire which was ignited in
the Sinaiatic Tree and to give thee to drink and overflowing
cup from the choice wine of the love of God,
until the intoxication of that wine may so prevail upon
thee that thou mayest thereby forget all else save God,
be attracted to the Beauty of God, glorify thy Lord
and sanctify Him during morn and eve.
     O maid-servant of God!  It is incumbent upon thee
to be severed from the desires of the world, and it is


+P 316
incumbent upon thee to be attracted to the Supreme
Kingdom.  At that time thou wilt become fluent in
tongue and thou wilt speak in most eloquent words
through the confimation of the Holy Spirit.  This is
that gift which the Lord of Heaven hath promised.

O thou who dost believe in the Spirit of Christ, in the
       Kingdom of God!
     The body is composed, in truth, of corporeal elements
and every composition is necessarily subject to decomposition;
but the spirit is an essence, simple, pure, spiritual,
eternal, perpetual and divine.  He who seeketh
Christ from the point of view of His body hath, in
truth, debased Him and hath gone astray from Him;
but he who seeketh Christ from the point of view of
His Spirit will grow from day to day in joy, attraction,
zeal, proximity, perception and vision.
     Thou hast then to seek the Spirit of Christ in this
marvelous day.  The heaven whither Christ ascended
is not an infinite space.  His heaven is much rather the
kingdom of His Lord, the Munificent.  As He said,
"The Son of Man is in heaven."  It is known then that
His heaven is beyond the boundaries that surround
existence and that He is elevated for the people who
adore.
     Pray God to ascend to this heaven, to taste of its
food--and know thou that the people have not understood
to this day the mystery of the Holy Scriptures.
They believe that Christ was deprived of His heaven
when He was in this world, that He had fallen from the
heights of His elevation and that later He ascended to
this elevated pinnacle--that is to say, towards the heaven


+P 317
which doth not exist, for there is only space.  They
expect that He will descend from this heaven seated
upon a cloud.  They believe that there is in the heavens
a cloud upon which He will be seated and by which He
will descend; while, in reality, the clouds are vapors
which rise from the earth and which do not descend
from the heavens.  The cloud mentioned in the Holy
Scriptures is the human body, because it is a veil for
them, like a cloud, which prevents them from seeing the
Sun of Truth which is shining in the horizon of Christ.
     I pray God to open before your face the gates of
revelation and of vision in such a way that thou shalt
learn the mysteries of God in this known day.***

O ye who are considering the Kingdom of your august
       Savior!
     I know the ardor which enflames you both+F1 with the
desire to present yourselves in the Sacred Place and
I desire, also, to see you both.  But my Lord hath a
supreme wisdom and His wisdom hath required the
imprisonment of Abdul-Baha and the prevention of
visits of impassioned friends.  It is a temporary condition
that will pass away in the future.  In the meantime
I shall remember you in my heart and I love you
with a holy affection that is spiritual, divine, eternal
and perpetual; that is founded on the surest base and on
the most durable of foundations.  I pray God to remove
all the veils and to illumine your hearts with
lights shining from the Supreme Horizon, in such a
manner that the light of guidance shall move before
you and that your hearts shall dilate in perceiving great

signs.  Turn towards California with a luminous
face, a joyous soul, an attracted heart, an enlightened
spirit, an eloquent speech and a radiant expression.  In
those regions God will, through you, become the guide
of many people.

O ye two+F1 singing birds in the Garden of Belief!
     I have read your letter in which you confess the
Unity of God and the grandeur of His reign, and in
which you make known that you have been attracted
by the perfumes of God and that you have bathed in
the sea of knowledge.  Thank God for that!  I pray
God to strengthen your steps in the straight road, to
preserve you from violent tests, in making of you two
green and fruitful trees in His great vineyard, to the
end that ye may arrive at a favor that shall make of
you two elected ones in the court of the august Lord.
Appreciate this favor and give thanks to your Savior
that He hath heaped upon you this great kindness.

O thou who art turning unto the Kingdom of God!
     Thy letter is received and perused.  It afforded us
joy and pleasure, gave us good news and is the token
of the wealth of thy love.  This period of time is the
Promised Age, the assembling of the human race to
the "Resurrection Day" and now is the great "Day of
Judgment."  Soon the whole world, as in springtime,
will change its garb.  The turning and falling of the
autumn leaves is past; the bleakness of the winter time
is over.  The new year hath appeared and the spiritual
springtime is at hand.  The black earth is becoming a

+P 319
verdant garden; the deserts and mountains are teeming
with red flowers; from the borders of the wilderness
the tall grasses are standing like advance guards before
the cypress and jessamine trees; while the birds are singing
among the rose branches like the angels in the highest
heavens, announcing the glad-tidings of the approach
of that spiritual spring, and the sweet music of
their voices is causing the real essence of all things to
move and quiver.
     O my spiritual friend!  Dost thou know from what
airs emanate the notes sung by those birds?  They are
from the melodies of peace and reconciliation, of love
and unity, of justice and security, of concord and harmony.
In a short time this heavenly singing will intoxicate
all humanity; the foundations of enmity shall
be destroyed; unity and affection shall be witnessed in
every assembly; and the lovers of the love of God at
these great festivals shall behold their splendor.
     Therefore, contemplate what a spirit of life God
hath given that the the body of the whole earth may attain
life everlasting!  The Paradise of El-Abha will soon
spread a pavilion from the pole-star of the world, under
whose shelter the beloved shall rejoice and the pure
hearts shall repose in peace.

O ye two+F1 pilgrims of the Holy Shrine!
     The news of your protected and safe arrival in Paris,
France, reached here and made me glad and happy.

of Paris, who met you with the greatest joy
and cheerfulness, and who are themselves in love, peace
and harmony.
     You shall openly declare all the signs of the Kingdom
that you say with you own eyes and shall suggest with
greatest joy and happiness all the divine teachings that
you heard.  I ask and supplicate God to make you to
convinced souls, to bring you forth with such a steadfastness
that each of you may withstand the people of
a country, and to intoxicate you with the wine of the
love of God so that you may cause your hearers to
dance, to be joyful and to exult.
     This is the time of happiness; it is the day of cheerfulness
and exhilaration.  For, praise to God, all the
doors are opened through the bounty of the Glorious
Beauty.  But one must show forth perseverance and
self-devotion and consecrate his thoughts, until the tree
of hope may give fruit and produce consequences.

O ye two+F1 lamps of the Love of God!
     Your letter to ........ was read and its contents
considered.  Its meanings expressed the feelings of
spiritual hearts and emanated from the spring of the
conscience.  This is from the bounty of the Kingdom of
Abha.  I hope that this drop will increase and grow
and become like unto an ocean; that your faith, certainty
and love toward God may grow, that your light
may increase, that ye may become heavenly and that ye
may receive aid and confirmation at every moment,

religion.

O thou respectful soul!
     Thy letter with its great and expressive contents
gave me satisfaction.  It gave utterance to the feelings
of thy heart and to thy contentment.  Thy going to
California was for the best.  I hope that it will give
great results; that through thee the ignorant will receive
knowledge, the blind will gain sight, the deaf will
hear, the dumb will speak, the negligent will awaken,
the heedless will receive intelligence.  If thou arisest as
it must and should be in the service of the Cause, the
divine assistance will direct and the heavenly, everlasting
help will continue.  I hope that thou will be
assisted to the intention which thou hast in thy heart.

O thou faithful maid-servant of God!
     What thou has written me hath been seen.  Indeed
thou belongest to the Kingdom and thou turnest towards
the Horizon of Abha.  I ask from the bounty
of God that thou mayest be enflamed day by day more
and more by the fire of the love of God.
     It seems that thou wast uncertain whether to occupy
thyself in writing or in delivering the tidings of the
Cause of God.  In these days, to deliver the glad-tidings
is the best of all.  Open then thy tongue to
the guidance of the human race on any occasion that
presents itself.
     Thou hast asked about knowledge and cognition.
Read the divine books and tablets and look into he
books of proofs that have been written in presenting


+P 322
this Cause.  One of them is the Book of Ighan+F1 , which
is translated into English.  There is also the book+F3 by
Mirza Abul Fazl and there are others written by the
believers.  In the time to come, many divine books and
tablets will be translated and thou wilt read them; but
thou mayest ask God that thou mayest attract divine
knowledge by the magnet of the love of God.  When
the soul becomes sanctified in every condition and becomes
pure and holy, then the door of the divine knowledge
will be opened to the face.
     Thou hast written about the dear maid-servant of
God, Mrs. ........  That one attracted unto God is
indeed always occupied in the service and she doth her
utmost to spread the divine lights; if she continueth in
the same way there will be great results in the future.
That which is of the greatest importance is to have
firmness, steadfastness and constancy.
     I pray God that through the desires and the efforts
of the maid-servants of the Merciful the foot of the
mountains by the ocean's shore+F4 will be enlightened by
the brilliancy of the love of God in such a way that its
light may be transmitted all over the world.
     You ask if, through the appearance of the Kingdom
of God, every soul hath been saved.  The Sun of Reality
hath appeared to the all the world.  This Luminous
Appearance is salvation and life; but only he who hath
opened the eye of reality and who hath seen these lights
will be saved.

1.        the time of Baha'o'llah's residence in Baghdad (the Dwelling of
2.   Peace), men of learning, including Jews, Christians and Mohammedans,
     visited Him seeking answer to religious and scriptural questions.  Such
     answer He gave in the Book of Ighan, otherwise known as the Book
     of Explanations and Assurance.  It concerns the Reality and Authority
     of the human "Divine Manifestations."

+P 323
     You also ask about the eventual victory of spirituality
in the Bahai age.  It is certain that spirituality
will overcome materiality and that the divine will have
the victory over the human; it is also true that by divine
education souls in every condition of existence will be
elevated, except those that are blind, deaf, dumb and
dead.  How can such souls comprehend the light?  The
sun lighteth up all the dark world, but the blind man
hath no portion in its brilliancy; the cloud of mercy
poureth forth streams of water, but the sterile land will
never produce plants and flowers.
     Give my greetings to the maid-servant of God, Mrs.
........ and to her daughter.  I pray God to assist
them to help them, that their meeting day by day
will grow brighter and that their hearts will be more
and more attracted.
     If you see Mrs........., give her my greeting
and say to her:  "Thou hast come to Acca, thou hast
seen my teachings, thou hast heard my explanations and
thou hast smelled the sweet odors of the Kingdom.  Do
not forget this, and try with thy heart and soul to
diffuse this fragrance to thy respected husband also."
     Give my greeting to all the maid-servants of God.

O thou attracted maid-servant of God!
     The celebration of the Feast of Naurooz+F1 made me
glad.  Consider how different this meeting was from
that of last year.  Consider the bounty and the blessing
of God.  Therefore, know that this Cause is progressive.
All the obstacles of the world cannot hinder it.
Thou didst realize divine joy and happiness in that

meeting.  Is it possible for earthly gatherings to give
such divine joy?  This bounty is in itself the greatest
evidence of the appearance of the Kingdom.  I ask
God to increase daily the fire and zeal of the love of
God.  Thus may that land become a veritable paradise
and the heavenly attainments become manifest.
     If thou knewest in what (spiritual) state I write
this letter thou wouldst surely become like a flame of
fire and set aglow the hearts by the fire of the love of
God.
     Thou hast written concerning the Most Holy Book.+F1
It is intended that in the future-inshallah+F2 --means
will be provided and with the utmost care it will be
translated and sent to those regions.
     O thou dear maid-servant of God!  The souls who
bear the tests of God become the manifestations of
great bounties; for the divine trials cause some souls to
become entirely lifeless, while they cause the holy souls to
ascend to the highest degree of love and solidity.
They cause progress and they also cause retrogression.
     Dr. ........ hath well said.  Surely this Cause is
beyond imaginations and thoughts.  convey greetings
of respect to him, to his revered wife, to his son and
to his bride.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Surely, if holy souls
are found and arise to do well the commandments and
precepts of God, to serve, they will verily become
centers of light; an illuminating ray will extend from
their hearts to all parts and the continent will become
radiant.

and that in this world ye may remain two radiant
candles and in the eternal horizon ye may glisten
like unto two shining stars.

O thou beloved maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter *** was received and its contents became
known.
     In this most Merciful Age the ignorant prejudices
are entirely removed, therefore the marriage of Miss
........ to Mr. ........ is permissible; but Miss
........ must exert herself day and night so that,
like the favored maid-servant of God, Mrs. ........
she may guide her husband.  She must not rest until
she makes him her spiritual as well as physical partner
in life.  But the Bahai engagement is the perfect communication
and the entire consent of both parties.
However, they must show forth the utmost attention
and become informed of one another's character and
the firm covenant made between each other must become
an eternal binding, and their intentions must be
everlasting affinity, friendship, unity and life.  The
bridegroom must, before the bridesman and a few
others, say:  "Verily, we are content with the will of
God".  And the bride must rejoin:  "Verily, we are
satisfied with the desire of God."  This is Bahai matrimony.
     Regarding the marriage of Mr. ........ and Miss
........, that also, God willing, is blessed.


+P 326
     The marriage of the Bahais means that both man
and woman must become spiritually and physically
united, so that they may have eternal unity throughout
all the divine worlds and improve the spiritual life of
each other.  This is Bahai matrimony.

O maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter hath arrived.  It brought joy to all hearts,
for it carried the proof of thy sincere work.  Today,
directing mankind in the right path is the magnet which
will attract to us the help of God.  All those who consecrate
themselves to this work are accompanied by
divine protection.  Thus, rely upon God and address
thy supplications to the Most High.  Then, after perfect
renunciation, care for the souls of the undirected
and negligent.  I pray that thou mayest be aided and
strengthened.
     Thou has demanded the permission to go to Algeria
in order to give thyself to the direction of men; may
God aid and help you in this work.

O thou who art seeking for the Power of the Holy
       Spirit!
     The reality of man is like unto a sea, and the Holy
Power is like unto brilliant pearls.  Not until the sea
moveth in waves doth it throw a shell of pearls upon the
shore.  Therefore if thou wishest to become heavenly,
cut thy attention from the earth; that is, cease to attach
thy heart unto this world and seek connection with
or attachment to the Kingdom and turn unto God.  and
when thou doest this, thou wilt become the mercy of
God and a gift of the Almighty.  Consider how the


+P 327
attracted maid-servant of God, Mrs. ........, is in
constant progress through the heavenly bounty.  I hope
that thou mayest become likewise.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     What thou hast written was perused and its contents
became manifest.  Thou hast questioned how thou
canst accept this divine cause, for thou art a member
of the Church:  (Know thou) in the day of the Manifestation
of Christ, many souls became portionless and
deprived (from the favor of God) because they were
members of the Holy of Holies in Jerusalem.  According
to that membership, they became veiled from that
brilliant Beauty.  Therefore, turn thou thy face to the
Church of God which consists in divine instructions and
merciful exhortations.  For what similarity (is there)
between the church of stone and cement and the Celestial
Holy of Holies!
     Endeavor that thou mayest enter in this Church of
God.  Although thou hast given oath to attend the
church, yet thy spirit is under the Covenant and Testament
of the Spiritual Divine Church.  Thou shouldst
protect this.  Although they consider the wine and the
bread in the church as the blood and body of Christ,
yet this is but the appearance and not the reality.  But
the reality of Christ is the words of the Holy Spirit.
If thou are able, take a portion thereof.
     The performance of baptismal celebration would
cleanse the body, but the spirit hath no share; but the
divine teachings and the exhortations of the Beauty of
Abha will baptize the soul.  This is the real baptism.
I hope that thou wilt receive this baptism.


+P 328
O thou maid-servant of God!
     The subject matter of thy letter is known to me.
Happy is thy condition, for thou hast loved Jesus always
and wept over His sufferings.  Sufferings though
they were intense in those days, yet they are more intense
in these days and are more worthy of being wept
over.  But at present, one must not weep, but one must
show forth firmness and steadfastness and withstand
the tests.
     I beg of God that that maid-servant of God and all
her family be blessed, remain firm and steadfast in love
for His Holiness Baha', and arise (to do) that which
is befitting these days.

O thou who art attracted to the Light of the Kingdom!
     Thank thou God, that in this glorious period, thou
hast advance toward the Manifest Light; thou hast
beheld the doors of the Kingdom open and considered
entrance therein conducive to eternal prosperity and
success.  Thou hast arisen to serve the Cause of god
and occupied thy time in assisting in the spiritual meeting.
Ere long thou shalt know what a light thou hast
enkindled.

O thou who hast been attracted by the Magnet of the
       Kingdom!
     Note that thy Lord hath manifested the Magnet of
the souls and hearts in the Pole of the existing world,
to which all the sacred hearts are attracted from the
far distant lands and countries.
     The iron body is attractable although at long distances


+P 329
away; but the earthen one is not although in
contact and very close.
     Therefore, thank thou God for being an attractable
body, to be drawn to the Magnet of the Kingdom of
God.

O thou whose heart hath been filled with the love of
       the Beauty of God!
     I have read thy kind letter and voiced thy words
which show the excess of thy love to God, the greatness
of thine adherence to the Cause of God and the abundance
of thine attraction to the Kingdom of God.  From
a man like unto thee such words are always expected
and it is your duty thus to proclaim.
     I do greet thee from this Exalted Place, while thou
art in that far distant country, and present to thee salutations
and praise, and I see thee with the eye of the
heart as though thou were present here and I speak to
thee by the tongue of the Spirit, saying:  "Blessed thou
art with every blessing!  Then preach to the beloved
of God in that country the glad-tidings of El-Baha!"
     The form of prayer requested by thee:
     My God! my God! thou art my hope and my
beloved, my intended aim and desire!  With great
humbleness and entire devotion I pray to Thee to make
me the minaret of Thy love in Thy region, the lamp
of Thy knowledge among Thy creatures and the banner
of thy gift in Thy Kingdom.
     Make me one of Thy worshippers who cut themselves
from everything but Thee and sanctify themselves


+P 330
from everything pertaining to the world and
divert themselves from the defects of the suspicious.
     Let my heart be dilated with joy through the spirit
of confirmation from Thy Kingdom and illumine my
sight with seeing the hosts of success following one
another and descending upon me from thine Omnipotence.
     Thou art the Almighty, the Invincible, the Powerful!

O thou who art turned to the Kingdom!
     In truth, I say unto thee that if a spark of the fire of
the love of god should fall into a heart, its flame will
increase gradually, as the breeze blows upon it, until
the sparks of the flame reach the Supreme Kingdom,
providing the necessary preparations are made to kindle
that fire in thy heart, to shed the tears from thine eyes
and to bring thy patience to an end for the purpose of
being drawn into the Kingdom of El-Abha.
     In truth, I say unto thee, if thou hear this call, do
not relax in mentioning God, nor grow weary of spreading
the fragrances of God.  And then rejoice at the
good news of the gifts which shall shine as the sun in
the highest culmination of America.

My God!  My God!
     I am a servant, miserable, humbled, submissive and
low at the door of Thy Oneness, supplicating Thee
with a heart full of Thy love and a face rejoiced at
Thy glad-tidings!
     O God!  Make me of those who are drawn unto
light and [who] detest darkness; with a heart overflowing
with the lights of Thy love among mankind; a


+P 331
tongue fluent in mentioning Thee in the assemblies of
worship (remembrance); a breast, cheered and widened
with Thy knowledge when uttering explanations; an
eye consoled with seeing Thy traces in all directions;
a foot firm in Thy Covenant, which I have received
from the traces of the Supreme Pen; a spreader of
mysteries to those who are heedless of them, who have
veiled themselves with doubts and suspicions.
     Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, the
Generous!

O thou who art kindled with the fire of the Love of
       God!
     Verily I read thy words which showed thy yearning
love in God, and chanted thy expressions written in His
praise.
     I beg of God to make thee a sign of guidance, a
standard of righteousness and a lamp shining with the
light of the knowledge of God.
     Give my greeting and salutation to Mrs. ........
and say to her:  "Be not disappointed by the calamity
which hath befallen thee and be not grieved that the
consolation of thine eye (thy child) hath left the world
of dust and hath ascended to the expanse of the Kingdom,
that he hath abandoned the abode of the lowest
world and hath sought refuge in the presence of the
greatest mercy, where the Lord hath placed him in a
comfortable abode."
     We have already written a consoling letter+F1 to her,
whereby her breast will be dilated and her soul will
cheer.

1.     Tablet commencing bottom page 139, Vol. I.
+P 332
O thou who art attracted unto the Beauty of God!
     Verily I have read thy excellent letter and was gladdened
by its wonderful meaning.  Blessed art thou, as
thou hast been kindled like a lamp by the fire of God's
love and as thou hast supplicated unto God and communicated
with thy Lord with an eloquent tongue and
excellent explanation.
     Verily I pray unto my Lord with all humbleness,
meekness, obedience and submissiveness--which demolisheth
every edifice of self-exaltation--that He shall
strengthen thee by the fragrances of holiness and the
breath of the Spirit of Truth and cause thee to be dedicated
(or severed) unto God, purged and purified
from the dross of the world, holy and sanctified from
carnal passions, sacrificing thy soul to the beloved of
God, contented with that which the Lord hath granted
thee in the world, anxious to perform noble and good
deeds while following the teachings of god, and in all
things adhering to the law of God!
     As God liveth!  shouldest thou be honored by attaining
to this station, thou wilt find thyself in the center
of the Paradise (Ferdowce), the highest of paradises!

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of god
       and steadfast in the Covenant of god!
     Verily I read thine eloquent letter, the composition
of which was beautiful, words excellent and significances
interesting, and I thanked God that He hath chosen
certain souls for His knowledge and love, deposited in
their hearts His mysteries, manifested from their faces


+P 333
His lights and made them the signs of His Kingdom,
the banners of His majesty, the trees of His paradise
and the birds of the garden of His holiness.
     O thou, my honorable friend!  Verily I scented the
fragrance of meekness and humbleness from the orchard
of the meanings of thy letter and was caused to
rejoice, smile and be made glad that God hath made
thee humble and submissive to His beloved.  Verily
this is the greatest bounty from God and by it the
breast of Abdul-Baha is dilated in this remote prison.
     O friend!  Verily the prison is my paradise and the
chains my necklace; my balance (or testing) is my
redemption (or salvation) and the castle is my fortified
safety, for this imprisonment is in the path of my Lord
and it is my salvation, my joy, my gratitude and happiness.
Verily, in calamity the face of Abdul-Baha
shineth and through hardship joy is attained by this
servant in all conditions.
     O thou friend!  Be not sorrowful because of my imprisonment
and lament not for my difficulties; nay,
rather ask God to increase my hardship in His path,
for therein lies a wisdom which none are able to comprehend
save the near angels.
     O thou friend!  Verily, those among the friends who
were martyred in the path of God--verily this is a
favor from God which He bestoweth upon whomsoever
He chooses; verily God is the most bountiful!--
they attained what the holy ones in the Supreme Kingdom
yearned for, and quaffed the wine of grace from
the bountiful hand of thy Lord the Merciful--may
my spirit be a sacrifice to them!


+P 334
     Therefore, be not sorrowful, for in it is a great
bounty for them and by it (martyrdom) the fire of the
love of God is increased in glowing, the Word of God
in spreading, the standard of God in elevation, the
fragrances of God in diffusion, and by this blood the
tree of peace is watered, the orchard of unity and harmony
pruned, and by it the fragrances of holiness
emanate from the Tree of Life and are being diffused
in the world.  Verily this is from the mercy of God,
which is bestowed upon whomsover He wishes.
     O friend!  I implore to God to make thee a banner
of the banners of the Kingdom, firm and steadfast, unshaken
by the most severe winds of tests and trials in
this terrestrial world; to confirm thee in the servitude
of the Sublime Threshold; to guide through thee many
souls and to make thee a sign of meekness and humbleness
before the beloved of God, the Mighty, the Protecting!

O thou who art arisen for the service of the Cause of
       God!
     I received thy recent letter and rejoiced in spirit at
its interesting contents which indicated thy arising for
the service of the Kingdom of god, servitude unto His
beloved ones and meekness and lowliness to His chosen
ones.
     I ask God to augment, day by day, thy zeal, attraction
and glowing with the fire of God's love; to destine
for thee a glorious station (or mansion) in His great
Kingdom and to open before thy face doors of success
and dilation, such that hearts shall be amazed and
minds astounded.


+P 335
O thou who art controlled by the attraction of the Holy
       fragrances of the gardens of God's Kingdom!
     Thy brilliant letter, which thou hast sent by the beloved
........, was read by me.  The bounty is of
God for that He hath inspired thee with the word
of fidelity and chosen thee from among those who are
called, whether men or women.  Therefore, thank thou
thy Lord at morn and eve and glorify His praise for
this favor.  Verily a great favor is bestowed upon thee!
     Our dear friend ......... hath arrived.  He praises
the beloved of God and His maid-servants and adorns
the ears with the pearls of praiseworthy actions and
good qualities of the elect and the faithful.
     I supplicate God to enable him and every one else to
serve Him in the garden of El-Abha and to help thee
to be gentle, humble and submissive; to reveal Himself
upon thee with the attributes of the Merciful and to
grant thee a heavenly table at all times.

O thou honored friend!
     Verily the sight of Providence is far reaching and the
divine glance is perfect.  Thou hast always been a recipient
of favors and the object of the bounty of the
glorious Beauty of Abha.  I trust in God that thou
mayest be thus aided by Him to serve His Cause and so
shine as a luminous star in the horizon of His Kingdom,
an illumining candle burning in the assemblage
of the Bahais; that thou mayest be confirmed by a power
of the Kingdom and attain divine bounty and providence.
     As to the question of women being chosen rather


+P 336
than men:  In this cycle there were men who arose
through a divine power and who shone forth as the sun
from the dawning-point of holiness; and, likewise, there
appeared certain women who became side by side with
men.  The expression which you quote, "Every woman
who is directed to the guidance of God in this great
age, will surpass men in every respect," signified that,
in this age, certain women will appear who will surpass
some men.  It does not mean that they will surpass
all the men who have given their lives as sacrifices
in this Cause; for in this wonderful cycle there appeared
such men as his holiness Khudoos, his holiness Bab-el-Bab,
his holiness the "King of Martyrs" and his holiness
the "Beloved of Martyrs," his holiness the great Vaheed+F1 ,
and such ones who have no equals in the world
of existence.
     If, in the letters to the maid-servants of the Merciful,
there hath been written in the sense of encouragement
(that form which such meanings can be inferred), the
purport is that some women in the wonderful age have
surpassed some men, and not that all women have surpassed
all men.  The members of the House of Spirituality
must give unlimited encouragement to women.
In this age, both men and women are in the shadow of
the Word of God.  Whosoever endeavors the most
will attain the greatest share, be it of men or of women,
of the strong or of the weak.
     As to the matter of teaching and the choosing of
men, the letters which I have written to the Spiritual
Meeting (House of Spirituality) of which you are a


------------------------
1.     martyred in Persia.  Khudoos, in the city of Barfurush; Bab-el-Bab, in
2.     Tabarsi; King of Martyrs and Beloved of Martyrs, both in Ispahan;
       Vaheed, in Nariz.
+P 337
member, will answer this question and will manifest the
station of men who remain firm in the Covenant of God.
Refer to them.
     As to the number of Tablets to women, this is due
to the fact that most of the letters which come to the
Holy Land are from women.  Rarely do letters come
from men and, naturally, to women the most are written.
Men are enjoined more than women to give the
Message of the Cause of God and to diffuse His fragrances.
     My dear friend!  If thou didst know how dear thou
art to Abdul-Baha, thou wouldst spread wings, and
through excess of joy, soar and begin teaching all that
country.
     As to the question:  "Whither shall we turn in our
prayers?"  There is an appointed center toward which
one must direct himself in prayer, but at present this
center is not unfolded because of wisdom.  In its time
this shall be announced.  At present, in those regions,
you should direct yourself, as formerly, to the East.
The appointed and certain center will be announced in
its time.
     You also ask:  "To whom shall we turn?"  Turn to
the Ancient Beauty.  If it be the will of God, the
blessed likeness (of the Manifestation) will be sent in
its proper time, so that, in the world of the heart, thou
mayest direct thyself to that holy likeness and thus be
saved from imagination and phantasy.  However, in
the Temple (Mashrak-el-Azcar) the blessed picture
must never be placed (or hung) on the wall.  This
you should know.
     As to the subject of babes and infants and weak ones


+P 338
who are afflicted by the hands of oppressors:  This
contains great wisdom and this subject is of paramount
importance.  In brief, for those souls there is a recompense
in another world and many details are connected
with this matter.  For those souls that suffering is the
greatest mercy of God.  Verily that mercy of the Lord
is far better and preferable to all the comfort of this
world and the growth and development of this place
of mortality.  If it be the will of God, when thou shalt
be present this will be explained in detail by word of
mouth.

O thou who art firm in the Covenant!
     Your letter *** arrived at this time and was read
with great care.  Its contents proved a source of gladness,
for it indicated firmness.
     Today firmness is of the greatest favors of the merciful
Lord.  How many a soul who traveled in one pathway
and after a time wanting firmness (or constancy)
went back; yea, followed the way again until he reached
the same point (as before) and arrived at the first
destination.  Thus did he waste his life and endeavored
to set the minds (of the people) uneasy and doubtful.
The opportunity and portion of these souls became an
evident loss.
     Thank thou God that thou art firm and constant and
art abiding at the threshold of servitude.  I ask God to
increase daily thy faith and certainty, trust and firmness.
Give thou the glad-tidings in a manner which
shall set afire souls that are in lethargy, give life to
them that are dead and sight to the blind.


+P 339
     Give greeting and praise from Abdul-Baha to all the
friends of God, particularly to the maid-servant of God,
the firm and steadfast Mrs. ........ .  Tell her to
"feel at rest; thou art ever in mind, with me and
present in the gathering.  God willing, I shall ask thee
to come."

O thou friend of old and O thou incomparable companion!
     Many letters have so far been received from thee
and lengthy answers have been written to them, but it
is strange that they have not reached thee.  I was
grieved when Mr. ....... said thou hadst not received
them.  Therefore, I write this epistle immediately
so that it may be a cause of comfort to thee.
     O dear friend!  Thou art more deserving than
others; thou art worthy of every favor and attention.
Is it possible then that I should answer others and leave
thee disappointed?  God forbid!  Thou art an old and
true believer; in faith thou hast attained precedence;
thou art constantly engaged in servitude; with an eloquent
tongue thou art teaching the Cause of God; thou
hast become the cause of faith in others; whenever thou
findest an opportunity thou dost travel and visit the
believers, disseminating the fragrances of God; thou
hast a soul full of glad-tidings and hast an enlightened
and clear heart.  I have a great attachment for thee;
how is it possible then that I should disappoint thee?
     I pray and supplicate God and ask for favor and help
for thee.  I am very desirous to behold thy face.
     Convey to all the beloved of God the utmost longing
on the part of Abdul-Baha.

O Lord!  O Beloved!
     The truthful servant, Mr. ........, abandoned
home, left his native land and crossed the great ocean
until he reached the shore of the Holy Land and arrived
at the Blessed Spot.  He laid his head upon the
threshold of the sacred dust; he implored and supplicated
the Gateway of Unity and sought confirmation
and strength.
     Now he is returning to his native clime to serve and
to spread the fragrances of the Holy Spirit.
     O Lord!  Confirm him, aid and strengthen him
through the hosts of the Kingdom, so that he may become
the cause of the spread of the Word of God, the
cause of joy and happiness to the friends and the means
of awakening the negligent.  Thou art the Mighty and
Powerful and Thou art the Precious, the Almighty, the
Wise!
     O thou truthful servant of the Beauty of Abha!
With a power of the Kingdom, a divine attraction and
a spiritual breath, return thou to that land; fill to overflowing
the lives and hearts with the wine of the love of
God; be the cause of joy to all and the means of unity
and agreement to all; because through unity and agreement
do the beloved of God hoist the standard, shine
with the light of the love of God and are tender to
one another.
     This is the attitude of the beloved of God and this
is the example and life of the sons of the Kingdom of
God.


+P 341
O thou herald of the Kingdom!
     Thank God that thou didst come to the holy shrine,
put thy head upon the holy dust, reached the gathering-place
of the spiritual ones, became a member of the assembly
of the Merciful, found friendship with Abdul-Baha
and with the utmost love and joy spent a few
days there.  Then thou didst receive permission to return
so that thou mayest serve the Kingdom on the
continent of America and show (to the people) the
way to heaven and lead them toward the Lord of
Hosts.  I hope that, with a divine strength and a godlike
personality, with a heavenly guidance, with a divine
attraction and with a spiritual zeal, thou wilt educate
the people.
     O thou, the firm one in the Covenant!  Give my respectful
greeting to thy honored wife and say to her
from me:  "The Jewish people were expecting the
manifestation of Jesus and were at the same time attracted
to Moses.  When His Holiness Christ appeared,
they (the Jewish people) thought that holy
personality intended to take away the eternal honor of
Moses.  Moses, in the eye of Israel, had no equal.
Now, these had never thought that a greater than him
(Moses) would appear.  So this way of thinking became
the cause of their being kept away from the Light
of Christ and they were prevented from the precious
things of the Holy Spirit, notwithstanding the fact that
the greatest friend of Moses was Christ and He made
His Holiness Moses great in the eye of the world and
made Him to be glorious in the contingent world;
whereas, even now, Israel (that is, the Jews) deny His
Holiness, the promised Christ, and count Him to be


+P 342
an enemy of His Holiness Moses and of Aaron and
David; and they were kept away from the bounties of
Christ.  They think that no other great person like
Moses could ever come upon the earth and if such a
person should be sent (by God), he must come under
the shadow of His Holiness Moses and promulgate
the law of the Torah.  This negligence on the part of
the Jews became the cause of keeping away a multitude
from the heavenly bounties and from the beneficence
of the Holy Spirit for nineteen-hundred years.
     "The Sun is ever the same, but the place whence the
Sun hath appeared hath changed.  Then, at Christ's
time, it appeared in the sign of Aquarius, but not it hath
manifested itself from the sign of Cancer.  These signs
are just for an illustration.  The sun is the same sun,
no matter from what sign it may manifest itself or from
what spot it may arise.  Thou must look at the Sun;
do not become veiled by the places from which the Sun
appears."
     O Mr. ........!  Likewise instruct and give my
love to thy dear son and say:  "O dear one of Abdul-Baha!
Be the son of thy father and be the fruit of
that tree.  Be a son that hath been born of his soul and
heart and not only of the water and clay.  A real son
is such an one as hath branches from the spiritual part
of a man.  I ask God that thou mayest be at all times
confirmed and strengthened."
     O thou servant of Baha'!  Thou hast asked regarding
the political affairs.  In the United States it is necessary
that the citizens shall take part in elections.  This
is a necessary matter and no excuse from it is possible.
My object in telling the believers that they should not


+P 343
interfere in the affairs of government is this:  That
they should not make any trouble and that they should
not move against the opinion of the government, but
obedience to the laws and the administration of the
commonwealth is necessary.  Now, as the government
of America is a republican form of government, it is
necessary that all the citizens shall take part in the
elections of officers and take part in the affairs of the
republic.
     O thou firm one in the Covenant!  We give thee
Thahbet (the Firm) for a name, so that this name be
an example of firmness and in the future thou mayest,
even more than before, be confirmed in service, and
upon thee be El-Baha-el-Abha!

O thou Thahbet (Firm) in the Covenant!
     Thy letter was received.  It indicated firmness and
steadfastness; therefore, it gave me joy and gladness.
     Today the greatest of all affairs in the Cause is
firmness and steadfastness.  A tree will not give fruit
unless it be firmly rooted.  A foundation will not last
unless it be firm.  There is nothing in this world of
man greater than firmness.  A soul who is firm will become
a son of the Kingdom of God and will be confirmed
with the power of the Holy Spirit.
     For this reason I have named thee Thahbet (meaning
firmness) and I ask the True One and supplicate
Him that thou shalt remain firm in the Cause of God
as an unshakable mountain and that the whirlwinds of
test shall never have any effect upon thee; nay, rather
that thou shalt be the cause of the firmness of others.
     With me thou art beloved and I ask God that thou


+P 344
mayest become the lighthouse of guidance in those regions
and that thou mayest shine with the lights of oneness
in this world of man.

O thou who art firm in the Covenant!
     The letter, which thou hast written to his honor
Mirza ........, was considered.
     Be thou happy!  Be thou happy! that thou hast put
aside rest and composure; that thou hast traveled
through and visited different states and endured innumerable
inconveniences so that thou might diffuse
the fragrances of mysteries and perfume the nostrils of
the spiritual ones.  When thou wert engaged in the
service of the Cause, thou wert my partner in all trials
and difficulties.  Thou hast been my associate and companion
and both of us were intoxicated and exhilarated
with the wine of the love of god.
     Praise be to God that thou hast been confirmed in
the service and I have likewise been assisted in visiting
the Holy Threshold.  In one day+F1 the world hath become
another world and the chains and manacles of
prison and incarceration have been broken to pieces,
and Abdul-Baha hath attained to the meeting of the
Holy Threshold.
     Although in prison, I have experienced the utmost
joy and fragrance, the heart was attracted, the spirit
rejoiced, the eyes turned toward the Kingdom of God
and the tongue mentioning the Name of the True One
and displaying the utmost effort and endeavor in the
promotion of the Word of God and the diffusion of
the fragrances of God; yet, under all difficulties, there

1.      24,1908, the day of the proclamation of a constitutional government in
2.    Turkey, and the freeing of all political prisoners and exiles.
+P 345
have been no shortcomings, nor hath there been any
lack of enthusiasm.  The call hath been raised uninterruptedly
and the fragrances of holiness have been
diffused through all regions and empires.
     In the meeting that had been organised in Los Angeles
the rays of the Sun of Truth shone forth, making
it an assembly of illumination.  The house of Mr. and
Mrs. ........ became the nest and shelter of the birds
of the Kingdom, and the house of Mrs. ......... and
the residence of Miss ........ in Pasadena became
the gathering-place of the Merciful and the rose-garden
of realities and significances.  I supplicate from the
bounty and favor of His Holiness the Almighty to assist
those holy souls by the invisible confirmations and
that they be helped by the providence and grace of His
Highness the One.
     Convey on my behalf longing greeting to the brother
of Mr. ........ and say:  "Praise God that thou
hast followed in the footsteps of thy respected brother,
associated with him and become his confidant."
     Likewise announce my longing greeting to the assemblies
of Oakland and San Francisco.  The houses
of Mrs. ........ and Mrs. ........ have become
the place of reading the divine verses and the nests of
the nightingales of the heavenly orchard.  A sweet
fragrance hath reached the spirit and soul from those
assemblies.
     Praise be to God, that in all cities the believers have
met thee with the utmost attraction and thy shining
face and joyful disposition became the cause of the enkindlement
of the fire of their souls and hearts.  Undoubtedly
thou shalt also make a trip to Green Acre.


+P 346
     The utmost joy was produced by the news of the
purchase of the ground for the erection of the Temple.
I hope that ere long they may lay the foundation.
     Deliver on my behalf divine glad-tidings to the assemblies
in Seattle, the members of the houses of Mrs.
........ and Mrs. ........ and the assemblies in
Portland and Denver and say:  "O ye sons and daughters
of the Kingdom!  Be ye thankful that although the
light of guidance hath dawned from the East, yet,
praise be to God, it illuminated both the East and the
West!  In order that glorification and thanks may be
shown for these bounties, the words and actions must
be in accordance with the advices and behests of His
Highness Baha'o'llah.  Thanks does not depend upon
words but upon deeds!"

O ye+F1 beloved of God and His sincere friends!
     By the life of God!  The hearts are cheered whenever
you are mentioned, the souls are comforted in your
love, the holy spirits are captivated by your fragrance,
the eyes are expecting to see you and the hearts are
longing to meet you, owing to the fact that your hearts
were kindled with the fire of the love of God, your
ears were charmed by hearing the Word of God and
your souls were rested in the appearance of the mysteries
of God.
     Blessed are ye, O children of the Kingdom of God!
Glad-tidings to ye, O friends of God! as He hath made
your destiny great and your share victory and happiness,
your lamps lighted and your spring to yield supply!

     Ye are the most brilliant stars!  Ye are the most
dazzling lamps!  Ye are the green branches!  Ye are
the ripe fruits!  Ye are the beautiful gardens!  Ye are
the overflowing bowls!
     God is merciful and compassionate!  His bounty is
great and great!  He appropriateth by His mercy
those whom He liketh and chooseth for His love those
of whom He approveth.  This is in accordance with
what Christ said:  "Many are called, but few chosen."
     God maketh your endeavor praiseworthy, your reward
great and your days in El-Baha feasts and pleasures,
because of your casting away the imaginary god
and accepting the Knowable, for [your] discarding
every evil spirit, craving for the witnessed Light and
for turning your faces to the Exalted Position.
     God will show forth your endeavor, increase your
spirit and fragrance, perfume the different directions
with your perfume, enlighten the horizon with your
light and quicken the hearts with that which is treasured
within you; will cheer the souls with what you
have accomplished and cause the verses of thankfulness
to be recited in all places; the banner in remembrance
of you to wave through all the ages; your fame
and praise to encircle the horizon and the tongues to
speak of your virtues and good endeavors.
     By the living Truth!  That bounty is great and great
and the Lord is supreme in majesty!  The confirmation
is successive and success is continuous, and the kindness
of your God, the Merciful, the Compassionate, will
surround you from all sides.


+P 348
O ye+F1 sincere ones!  O ye firm ones!  O ye heralds of
       the Kingdom of God!
     Fly away with joy!  Flutter in the open of the Kingdom!
Spread the wings of sanctity in those districts
and lands, so that the shadow of the King of the Kingdom
may be stretched over those climes and the fragrances
of God be diffused in those tracts and in those
vast and extensive regions.
     By the Lord of the Kingdom!  If one arise to promote
the Word of God with a pure heart, overflowing
with the love of God and severed from the world, the
Lord of Hosts will assist him with such a power as
will penetrate the core of the existent beings.
     As to ye, be rejoiced, O ye children of the Kingdom
of God!  Your faces will surely become illuminated,
your brows shining, your breasts dilated with an abundant
bounty and refreshed with a rain pouring from
the clouds of the gift of God.  You will find yourselves
as souls for the temple of the contingent world and as
arteries pulsating in the body of the universe.  Your
faces will shine with the light of favor throughout all
environments.
     Make your feet firm; withstand the creeds (or multitudes);
chant the Book; and explain mysteries through
an inspiration on the part of your Exalted Lord, the
possessor of glory and honor!

O ye two+F2 revered persons, ye servants in the vineyard
       of God!
     Verily, I read your letter and was informed of its
contents filled with spiritual attractions and thanked


------------------------
1.    three members of the Chicago assembly who were traveling and teaching.
2.    two members of the Chicago assembly.
+P 349
God--glorified is He!--for His grace and His merciful
bestowals.
     It behooveth you to be the first assistant to the Word
of God, the first servant of the Cause of God and the
first one to withstand the spreaders (of false rumors)
who say that which they know not, who calumniate
God, well knowing that they are calumniators and that
they, themselves, have contrived the thing for their
own sakes, and evil is that which they do.
     Remember what the Pharisees published concerning
Jesus, attributed to Him and said about Him and how
they oppressed Him until they paraded Him in Jerusalem
in such a form as made the angels of sanctity to
weep in the Sublime Kingdom.  They put on His head
a crown of thistles; nay, more, they cast dust in His
face--into a face whereby the heaven and the earth is
illuminated!  They turned their backs upon Him, then
bowed and said:  "Peace be unto thee, O King of
kings!  Peace be unto thee, O King of the Jews!"
     Of the same class are the Pharisees and priests in
this manifest day.  "Leave them to amuse themselves
with their vain discourse."  They are as people deluded
by their temptations and are isolated from the gifts of
your Lord, the Clement, the Merciful.  "They are
deaf, dumb and blind; therefore, they will not understand."
     Verily, I, through the grace of my Lord, have never
heeded these souls, even to reading their articles, inasmuch
as their articles signify no other than the buzzing
of flies to the hearing of an eagle, or the croaking of
a frog of the material world to the ears of the leviathan
of the sea of the Kingdom.  Is it to be considered as


+P 350
anything?  No, by no means!  Verily, the eagle soareth
high in the supreme apex while the flies rumble in
the lowest rubbish.
     But it is incumbent upon you to block them up as a
stone with decisive arguments before which heads are
bowed and voices are made humble.  God will
strengthen you therein.  You will surely find these Pharisees
in manifest loss.  Can one ever prevent the waves
of the sea of the Lofty One from rolling?  Or is it possible
for me to restrain the fragrances of sanctity from
diffusion?  Or can one withhold the sun from casting
its rays to all regions?  No, by no means!  Nay, rather
such souls make the table sent down from heaven unlawful
unto themselves.
     How is the bat to be compared with the most great
orb which bestows bounty upon all regions!  How is
the gnat to be compared with the eagle soaring in the
spacious firmament!  How are the Caiaphas and Annas to
be compared with the Christ mounted on the clouds
with great power and glory!
     Thank God that He hath opened your insight to the
Light which is shining from the Supreme Concourse
and caused you to witness His most mighty signs.  By
my life! the hearts of the people of Baha' are cheered
with such gifts!

O ye+F1 sincere, O ye firm and steadfast in the Testament
       of God!
     I have read your letter signed by you, which shows
your steadfastness and firmness in the Covenant of God
and His Testament, which was confirmed by the trace

1.    the Chicago assembly.
+P 351
of His Supreme Pen+F1 , the greatness of which hath been
divulged in all the regions, entered the palaces of kings
of which both rulers and subjects have been informed,
and no human being could ever deny it, even he who
turns away and backslides.  It came to the imagination
of some children that they are able to abolish this Covenant,
the like of which was not known in the early centuries
and the heavenly ages of the past; and they shall
see themselves in evident loss!
     But as to you, O ye firm and steadfast, be straightforward
in the Cause of God, let your feet be firm in
the Religion of God, and arise with every effort within
your power to render victorious the Covenant of God.
By God, the Truth, you will be assisted by a numerous
army, and re-inforced by a cohort of the angels of God.
Pay not the slightest attention to that which is said by
these children, for their statements and sayings are
nothing but confused dreams.
     The Star of the Covenant shall shine intensely upon
all horizons and regions, and the violators will be as
bats hiding themselves in dark holes!  It is enough
humiliation and abasement to them that they have violated
the Covenant of God and contradicted the Appointed
Center, and desired to demolish this solid edifice--
which, alas, could not be!  By God, they did not
demolish but their own edifice, did not shake but their
own foundations, and did not scatter but their own
union, and to them shall come the news of what they
have done!
     But as to you, O ye beloved of God, strengthen yourselves
by every effort and arise to serve the Cause of

God, for verily the Holy Spirit will confirm you by the
breaths of the True One in all cases and under all circumstances!

O thou+F1 who art firm in the Covenant!
     ***The prison is like a paradise to Abdul-Baha, the
depth of the well is as the height of the moon--such is
my desire in the Path of the Blessed Beauty!  Were
it not for the chain, sword and affliction, how should
the people of faithfulness be distinguished from the
people of hatred?  Nay, otherwise, they would seem
as one.  This wound cannot be remedied save by a host
of calamities, and this illness cannot be cured except by
the cup of affliction.
     I ask God that I may not repose for a moment, but
that, night and day, in the love of the Blessed Beauty+F2
--may my spirit be a sacrifice to Him!--I may drink
from the rosy cup of the blood of the heart.
     With every breath do I desire to perceive thousands
of afflictions approaching me from every inhuman one;
at one time, to rest in the bottom of a dungeon; at another,
to repose on the chain; and, ultimately, by the
favor and providence of the Blessed Perfection, to roll
my face and hair in my blood.
     Therefore, their invitation+F3 was not accepted because
they invited departure to that region.  Lately, that
general letter was requested from persia, and it was
sent thereto.***

O ye+F1 friends of God and daughters of the Kingdom!
     The letter you have written was considered.  It
caused abundant spirit and fragrance.  It was not a letter,
it was a rose-garden.  The fragrances of the flowers
of significances were exhaling from that garden and
perfumed the nostrils.  It was a proof of unity and
oneness and an evidence of love and freedom.
     I became very happy through reading it.  I hope
that this love and unity may increase day by day, and
its effects may reach other regions.  The purpose of the
coming of the Manifestation of the Mount is the unification
of the world of humanity.  Therefore, the friends
of God and the daughters of the Kingdom must serve
this purpose and become the cause of joy to the heart
of Abdul-Baha.  Thus can they bring together under
the protection of the Tent of Oneness the other nations
and peoples; make this gloomy world radiant, this mundane
earth a plane of the Kingdom, and the material
world the manifestation of divine signs.
     O ye friends and daughters of the Kingdom and
leaves of the Blessed Tree!  Endeavor to make that
continent the Paradise of Abha, and the West the East
of Lights.  This is the hope of Abdul-Baha.

O ye+F2 dwellers of the Kingdom!
     Thank ye God that ye have turned your faces toward
the Kingdom of Abha, and are yearning for the
outpouring of the Exalted Realm.  Ye are accepted in
the Threshold of the True One and are chosen by the
Most Great Guidance!

+P 354
     Ye have asked regarding the word of the "Ransomed
Ones".  The mystery of "Ransom" (or Sacrifice)
is a most great subject and is inexhaustible.
     Briefly it is as follows:  The moth is a sacrifice to
the candle.  The spring is a sacrifice to the thirsty one.
The sincere lover is a sacrifice to the loved one and the
longing one is a sacrifice to the beloved.  The point
lies in this:  He must wholly forget himself, become a
wanderer (in the Abode of the Beloved) enamoured
with His Tresses.  He must consign to oblivion the
body and soul, the life, comfort and existence.  He
must seek the good pleasure of the True One; desire
the Face of the True One; and walk in the Path of the
True One.  He must become intoxicated with His Cup,
resigned in His Hand and close the eyes to life and living,
in order that he may shine like unto the Light of
Truth from the Horizon of Eternity.  This is the first
station of sacrifice.
     The second station of sacrifice is as follows:  Man
must become severed from the human world, be delivered
from the contingent gloominess, the illumination
of mercifulness must shine and radiate in him, the nether
world become as non-existent and the Kingdom become
manifest.  He must become like unto the iron thrown
within the furnace of fire.  The qualities of iron, such
as blackness, coldness and solidity which belong to the
earth disappear and vanish while the characteristics of
fire, such as redness, glowing and heat, which belong to
the Kingdom become apparent and visible.  Therefore,
iron hath sacrificed its qualities and grades to the fire,
acquiring the virtues of that element.
     Likewise, when the souls are released from the fetters


+P 355
of the world, the imperfections of mankind and that
animalistic darkness, and have stepped into the Realm
of Abstraction, have partaken a share from the outpouring
of the Placeless and have acquired lordly perfections,
they are the "ransomed ones" (or the martyrs)
of the Sun of Truth, who are hastening to the
altar of heart and soul.

O Thou Pure God!+F1
     Gaze providently at the beloved ones and the dear
maid-servants in Chicago.  Confer upon them Thy
bounty and grace.  Teach them the law of the Kingdom,
burn away the veil of material superstition and
light the candle of Thy love in their hearts!
     O God!  The clay (or being) of these servants is
kneaded with the water of fidelity and the nature of
these maid-servants is adorned with love!  They believe
and are assured.  they are firm and steadfast;
they are kneeling and worshipping; they are uttering
(the Words) and are informed.  Render them confirmed
and victorious with the hosts of strength.  Aid
and gladden them through the angels of the Kingdom
of Abha!  At every moment reveal a new power to
them and with every breath confer a great bounty.
Thus with a heavenly power, divine strength, merciful
fragrance, supreme light, and conscious attraction, may
they arise to serve Thee, to perfume the East and the
West with the fragrances of holiness, establish the universal
peace, promulgate integrity and honesty, to adore
the truth, become a means of life to the people of the
world, a cause of comfort and rest to them; to help the

spiritual meeting, to serve the gathering of the Lord,
to send well-informed souls (teachers) to other regions
and climes, to be self-sacrificing with life and heart, to
build the Mashrak-el-Azcar, to raise the anthem of
sanctity to the Supreme Kingdom, to live in perfect love
with one another; nay, rather, to be the cause of rest ot
whole world, to adorn the realm of creation, to destroy
the edifice of jealousy and envy and to establish
the law of love and unity, to be truthful servants of
mankind and conscientious well-wishers of the human
race!
     O God!  Thou art the Able, the Powerful!  Thou
are the Confirmer and the Helper in all conditions and
circumstances!

O thou whose breast is dilated (with joy) for the Kingdom
       of Truth!
     Verily I read thy letter which showed that thine inner
heart is attracted to the Beauty of God and that
thou hast entered the Kingdom of God.  I beg of god
to make thy feet firm in this right path and to protect
thee from violent tests and form calumnies on the part
of every woman who hath, like unto Judas Iscariot,
turned away from the True One and who hath withdrawn
herself and is deprived of the mercy of God.
     As to thee, O maid-servant of God!  Blessed art
thou, for thou hast dealt with people in goodness and
good favor.  Do not seek from them any reward whatever,
but seek all grace and beneficence from thy Lord,
and even deal with the people of great oppression in
faithfulness, for as much as this is becoming of the
people of Baha'.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     The letter that thou hast written, through his honor

happiness in the world of existence for men except in
the splendors of the Light of the Kingdom.
     Thou has written concerning the acceptance (of this
Cause) by some French people.  Make an effort in order
that some firm and steadfast souls may arise in this
great Cause from France, and to make that jungle a
garden of God.
     Be assured in the favor and grace of God, for each
maid-servant of God who ariseth to serve the Kingdom
will undoubtedly be confirmed.

O thou who art honored and dear!
     Thy letter was received and was the source of pleasure,
for thou hast not forgotten this imprisoned one and
remembered Acca.  Although thy days here were few,
as they were pleasant, they will count as years; a real
intimacy between thee and all the family was formed
which will not be forgotten in the passing of the years.
     I desire of God that thou wilt be heavenly, angelic
and spiritual; and as a torch, become illumined with
the love of God in the kingdom of existence.
     In regard to the question thou askest about the picture
of this oppressed one, say that it was much spread in
America:  Know that this imprisoned one never had a
picture taken except in youth, and that one also on account
of the command and will of Baha'o'llah, I
merely consented so as to obey His command.  Therefore
I do not like it to be great spread.


+P 358
     I desire of God, that the traces of the spiritual likeness,
which are attributes and qualities, will remain
eternally.

O thou who art attracted to the Spirit of Truth!
     In whatsoever matter man wisheth to engage, he must
first acquire some capability and make provisions and
preparations therefor.  In this day, whatever soul intendeth
to raise the voice of the Kingdom, and to draw
people under the Tree of Life in the ideal paradise, and
to invite them to eternal life, must first be delivered
from all attachments, must even shut his eyes to rest,
quietude and to the mortal life of this world.
     I hope thou hast abandoned all such (mortal) things,
and when thou hast attained to this great bounty, that
is, when thou art delivered from the attachments of this
mortal world, and hast intended to endure all calamities
in the path ofGod--in such wise that reproaches on
the part of the enemy will seem to thee as praise and
glorification, and the blame of the people of hatred will
appear like unto admiration and applause, and the bitterness
of afflictions will taste as the honey of favor and
all hardships be as sweetness--then canst thou step into
the path of the Kingdom and become the herald of
God.
     Consequently, do thou show a steadfast and firm
footing in this station, engage in guiding the people
and call them unto the Kingdom; then wilt thou find
how the divine magnet--the power of the Word of
God--will attract the hearts and bestow ecstasy and
enthusiasm upon souls!
     When thou reachest this station there shall remain


+P 359
no obstacles and no veil shall intervene, and all that is
thy highest wish shall be realized.
     Send my greeting to Miss ........ .  I hope she
may be wholly attracted to the Kingdom of God.
     As to the book that thou intendest to write:  When
thou hast written it (or if you write it), send it to the
Holy Land (i.e., Acca) to be seen (or examined) so
that thou mayest publish it afterward.

O thou dear maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter was received.  Thy faith and certainty
became evident.  Happy is thy condition, that in such
a day thou hast opened thine eyes and beheld the light
of the Sun of Reality.
     Convey reverential greetings to the believing maid-servant
of God ........ and say:  "Be not grieved
and bear the ordeal from thy husband.  The meeting
of the beloved of God and the maid-servants of the
Merciful take the place of his ignorance.  I hope that
they may be the cause of joy and happiness to thee."

O thou who art advancing to the Kingdom of God!
     What thou hast written became evident and what
thou hast heard from Mirza ........ regarding the
necessity of many teachers in America, is true.  I have
said so.  Indeed, there is need of a thousand teachers,
each one severed from the world, attracted by the Holy
Spirit in the Supreme Concourse and joyful through
the Kingdom of God and in perfect sanctity, holiness
and sufficiency.
     This matter of teachers requires the greatest condition;
that is, they should never stain themselves with


+P 360
the world, they should not look for the least pecuniary
reward from any soul; nay, rather they should bear the
utmost poverty and with the perfect wealth of nature+F1 ,
through the bounty of God, may they associate with
the people.  They should seek no reward nor recompense.
Freely have they received, freely should they
give.  His Holiness Christ sayeth:  "When ye leave the
city, clean off from your shoes the dust thereof."  The
holiness of the teachers must reach this degree.  Thus
may they utter with eloquence, while in ecstasy and
great joy, and guide the people to the manifest light.
     If this be the endeavor, strive with life and heart
and guide the people to he Kingdom of God, lead
them to the straight pathway, inform them of the greatness
and magnitude of this Cause and give them the
glad-tidings through the bounty of divine providence
and the revelation of the Sun of Truth in this great
age.
     Convey my greeting to the advancing maid-servant
of God [thy wife], and say to her:  "O maid-servant
of God!  Seek whilst thou canst the life eternal and
wish for everlasting glory in the divine world."
     Embrace twice thy children, and give my greeting
to the maid-servant of God, thy mother.
     thy name is Joseph.  Let thy title be Bahai.

O thou child of the Kingdom and firm in the Covenant!
     Thy letter, through his honor Mirza ........,
was received and thy former letters also became acceptable
and through the contents of those writings utmost

joy and fragrance was produced, for they all evinced
faith, assurance and firmness in the Covenant.
     In this day the most vital and momentous matter is
steadfastness in the love of the Manifestor of Light on
the Mount of Sinai and endurance of ordeals and unaccountable
calamities in this Cause.
     Ere long the seditious people shall arise in that country
to deride the righteous ones and to ridicule the holy
ones.  Every day they will cast ignominy and at every
moment they will present great persecution.  They shall
revile the friends for the sake of the love of Baha; and
bring down upon them contempt and sarcasm; neither
do they fall short in creating torture.
     This is the custom and sentence of the people of bygone
ages.  Undoubtedly these things must transpire
in these days even with a greater intensity.
     That is why His Holiness the Christ sayeth:  "Everything
which hath happened in the cycles of the former
prophets will certainly occur again in these days."  Consider
ye!  What calumny, slander, cruelty and oppression
were brought down upon the apostles by the Israelites
for the sake of faith and assurance!  They unlocked
the hands of pillage, persecuted and tortured those
sanctified souls.  Therefore, there is no doubt but that
you will become afflicted with trial, calamity and oppression
in the path of the Beauty of Abha.  These trials
are the essence of bestowal and pure bounty and the
proofs of your acceptance in the Threshold of Oneness.
Consequently, when the fire of trials is ignited, celebrate
ye in joy, dance with overflowing emotions and
be ye happy that--praise be to God!--ye have become


+P 362
the target of contempt in the path of the Beauty of
Abha and are hated by the people of passion and
desire.
     Thy services in the highway of the Kingdom are accepted,
thy toleration of the troubles is known and
manifest and thy eloquent speeches in the assemblies of
believers are heard and appreciated.  I hope that
through these services thou mayest become the manifestor
of the favors of the Lord of the Kingdom and
recipient of the merciful glances of His Highness the
Magnificent and the Compassionate.

O thou speaker in the remembrance of God!
     Verily I say unto thee, O servant of God!  The
earth and what is therein are imaginations or reflections
in mirrors or shades; but the bounty of the Kingdom
and the gifts of the invisible world are the thoughts of
the Merciful One, and the lordly radiances are immortal
and constant and unending.  Thou must depend
upon these!  Thou must depend unto these!  Thou
must depend upon these!
     Be assured with the true assurance that, verily, dependence
upon the Covenant of God is surrounded from
all directions by those gifts and the angel hosts assist
it on the right hand and on the left hand, and the
power of the Holy spirit strengthens it in all circumstances
and meets it with signs of splendor in the horizons.
     Therefore, confirm the wavering minds in the path
of God, and the feeble souls with the love of God.


+P 363

O thou pure soul who art kindled by the fire of the love
       of Baha'!
     By God, the True One! thy letter created joy and
happiness within hearts, because it was speaking the
praise of Baha' and contained words which showed thy
attraction to the light of the Beauty of El-Baha.
     Blessed art thou and blessed is thy heart which is
longing for the Kingdom of El-Baha, and that thou
art hoping to serve Baha' in His great vineyard and in
His wonderful garden!
     I beg of God to favor thee with a power which may
encourage thee to promulgate the Truth and guide the
father and sister to the right path.  I beg Him to make
thee a herald, in His name, in those regions.
     Have resignation and devotion and attraction and
make thy heart empty of aught else save the love of
Baha'.  This is the state which was coveted by the
near ones and this is a position which was longed for by
the holy souls.

O thou who hast turned thy face toward the Kingdom
       of God!
     I supplicate God that thou mayest become like unto
Peter, the "Rock"--unshaken, immovable and strong;
be assisted by heavenly confirmation; be helped to the
service of the Cause of God, opening thy tongue to
teach the divine instructions, and living and walking
according to the laws of the Book of Akdas+F1 .
     Thou hast asked permission to come to our presence:
These days are very difficult.  God willing, it will be
brought about in the future.  I pray to God that thou

O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!
     Thy letter *** was received.  Its contents were of
the utmost grace, for it indicated that thou hast become
a heavenly, spiritual Bahai; that is, thou hast found the
attractions of heart and art aspiring to associate with
the Holy Fragrances.
     Peter, who was the Rock (of the Christian dispensation),
was firm and solid; but, in the moment of
Christ's deliverance, that Rock quaked a little, until the
crowing of the cock was raised.  I hope that thou wilt
become, in steadfastness, so firm and so solid that thousands
of deliverances would not cause thee to tremble.
     This is the New Spirit and the uninterrupted assistance.
When this is attained, the language will become
eloquent and the utterance penetrating.

O thou who hast approached the Kingdom of God and
       hast looked toward the Center of the Covenant!
     Verily, thy namesake, the faithful Joseph, fell surely
into grievous distress through the jealousy of his brethren,
who dishonored him; nay, outraged him, and cast
him behind their backs and threw him in a dark well;
they sold him for a paltry price--for a few pence--
returning to their father at eve weeping, and, with
his shirt stained with false blood, they slandered the
wolf who was free from blame.  The same shall also
appear from these violators.  Then interpret this vision:
How the conduct of these former evil-doers agreeth with
the course of the succeeding followers of the great
darkness!


+P 365
     Verily, thou who art called by this honorable name,
desire to have a portion in its great successes, to become
a cherished one in the Egypt of the love of God,
to possess qualities free from all evil and to become the
source of good deeds.
     God assisteth whomsoever He pleaseth with that
which He pleaseth.  Verily He is the Mighty and Powerful!

O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!
     Verily, I received thy letter which spoke of thy extreme
love for God, thy being occupied in the commemoration
of God and thy joy in the Spirit of God.
     Verily, I supplicate God to enkindle in thy heart the
fire of His love; and enkindlement the light of which
shall affect all regions, so that thy face may become
illumined by the lights of the Spirit and [give forth]
fragrance in the world of possibility.  Arise for the
service of the Cause of God in those countries which
are vast and spacious, and sing, warbling beautiful
melodies in the Name of thy Lord, the Supreme.
     I saw thy photograph among the photographs of the
friends, witnessed the light of guidance glistening in thy
face and asked aid and strength for thee in this great
day.
     The most important matter in this day is the spreading
of the fragrances of God in those cities.  Verily,
confirmation will surround thee from all sides.
     This matter is equivalent to thy presence in these
regions.  Now presence is not allowable for a certain
wisdom which God shall manifest in future time.

Verily I approach Thee, O my God, in the darkest hour
       of this dark night, and pray Thee with my inmost

       which are being diffused from Thy Kingdom of
       Abha, and say+F1 :
     O my Lord, I have not words enough to praise Thee,
nor can the birds of meditation ever ascend to the
Kingdom of Thy sanctity.  Thou art, in Thine entity,
sanctified from every praise and commendation, and art
purified, in Thyself, from the thanksgiving of the people
of emanation.  Thou hast been eternally in the
sanctity of Thyself exalted beyond the comprehension
of the knowing among the Supreme Concourse, and
Thou shalt be permanently in the purity of Thine essence,
incomprehensible beyond the knowledge of the
praisers among the dwellers in the exalted Realm of
Might!
     O my God, O my God, because of Thine incomprehensibility,
how can I ever mention Thee by any praise,
or glorify Thee by any commendation!  Thou art, O
my God, exalted and sanctified from all praises and
glorification, O Thou, my beloved!
     O my God, O my God, have pity on my impotence,
my abasement, my indigence, my shame, and my humility.
Give me the cup of Thy forgiveness and Thy gift,
move me by the breath of Thy love, dilate my breast
by the light of Thy knowledge, purify my person by the
mysteries of Thy singleness, and quicken me through the
breezes of the garden of Thy mercy so that I may
sever myself from all beside Thee, lay hold of the
hem of the mantle of Thy majesty, forget aught else

days, be enabled to continue faithful in the threshold
of Thy sanctity and stand up in the service of Thy
Cause, be submissive and lowly before Thy beloved
ones and to account myself as nothing in the
presence of Thy chosen ones.  Verily, Thou art the
Helper, the Assister, the Exalted, the Generous!
     O my God, O my God, I beg of Thee, by the effulgence
of the light of Thy countenance, whereby all
the regions of the world are illumined; by the glances
of the eye of Thy mercy, which comprehends all things;
by the billows of the sea of Thy favor, wherewith all
parts are overflowing; by the rains from the clouds of
Thy gift, which are falling upon the essence of the
created beings; by the radiance of Thy mercy, which
overpowers existence--to strengthen Thy chosen ones
to faithfulness, to enable Thy beloved ones to serve
Thine exalted Threshold, to encircle them through the
hosts of Thy power, which have encompassed all things,
and to assist them through Thy numerous armies from
the Supreme Concourse.
     O my God, these are lowly souls in Thy doorway
and poor ones before Thy court, humbly seeking Thy
grace and in need of Thy confirmation, turning toward
the Kingdom of Thy Singleness, and yearning for the
bounties of Thy gift.  O my Lord, refine their consciences
through the lights of Thy sanctity, and purify
their hearts through the gift of Thy confirmation, dilate
their breasts through the fragrances of joy and happiness,
which are being diffused from Thy Supreme Concourse,
and illumine their sight by witnessing Thy chief
signs.  Make them signs of sanctity and standards of


+P 368
purity waving on the apex of the contingent world, unto
all creatures; so that their words may take effect in the
hearts though they are even as flint.  May they stand
up to serve Thee, to devote themselves unto the Kingdom
of Thy divinity, to turn unto the realm of the
might of Thy self-subsistence, to spread Thy signs, to
become illumined through Thy lights, to unfold Thy
mysteries, to direct Th servants unto the running
water, and the fountain of Tassnime+F1 which is gushing
and springing out in the midst of the paradise of Thy
singleness; to unfold the sail of devotion on board the
Ark of Deliverance and sail on the sea of Thy knowledge,
to spread the wings of unity and soar up towards
the kingdom of Thy Singleness, to become servants
whom the Supreme Concourse may commend, and whom
the people of Thy Kingdom of Abha may praise, to
hear the invisible heralds who announce the chief glad-tidings;
to pray Thee at the dawn with with most wonderful
invocations, while yearning after Thy visit--
O my mighty Lord!--to weep every morn and eve,
longing for the entrance into the shadow of Thy great
mercy!
     O my Lord, assist them in all cases, and help them
under all circumstances, through the angels of Thy
sanctity, who are Thine invisible hosts, and overwhelm
all the armies of the inferior concourse.  Verily, Thou
art the Powerful, the Omnipotent, the Comprehending,
and Thou art the Almighty!
     O pure God, O loving God!  We are wandering
around Thy abode and longing for the gift of Thy
meeting, and are loving Thy characteristics.  We are


------------------------
1.     of the fountains of Paradise mentioned in the Koran.
+P 369
helpless, humble, lowly, and weak; confer Thy mercy
upon us, favor us with Thy gifts, overlook our shortcomings,
and conceal our endless faults.  We are Thine,
whatever we might be (good or bad), and whatever
we may say or hear is but Thy commendation.  We
seek but Thy face, and we search but Thy path.  Thou
art the loving God, while we are but sinners and love
Thee passionately.  O Thou Cloud of Mercy (shower
upon us) a few drops!  O Flower-garden of Favor
(send to us) some fragrances!  O Sea of Gifts (flow
over us) Thy waves!  O Sun of Grace (pour on us)
some radiances!  Have pity on us, and show us favor.
We swear by Thy Beauty that we are full of errors,
and we have no deeds, but hopes.  Except Thy concealing
veil should cover us, and Thy preservation and
protection should favor us, these weak souls have not
enough power to employ themselves in Thy service, and
the indigent ones have not enough wealth to show a
rich appearance.  Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty!
     I beg of Thee to assist them!  Do refresh these faded
souls with the drops of the cloud of Thy gifts, and do
illumine these lowly beings through the effulgences of
the sun of Thy Singleness!  I pray Thee to cast these
thirsty fishes into the sea of Thy mercy; guide their lost
caravan unto the asylum of Thy unity; direct these
bewildered souls unto the fountain of Thy guidance,
and cause these wanderers to abide in the shelter of Thy
might.  Suffer the thirsty ones to drink from the Salsabil+F1
of Thy gifts, and quicken the dead by eternal
life.  Endow the blind with sight, the deaf with hearing,

the heedless with mindfulness, the sleepers with wakefulness,
and the proud with humility.  Verily, Thou art
the Powerful, Thou art the Forgiver!  Thou art the
Loving!  Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Most
High!
     O friends of God, and assistants of this humble servant!
When the Sun of Truth shone forth with Hi
infinite bounties from the dawning-place of hopes, and
the horizon of existence was illuminated through the
radiance of sanctity--then He cast forth such splendor
whereby the gloomy darkness disappeared!  Therefore,
the earth became the envy of the celestial world, and the
realm of dust was made a scene of the exalted kingdom.
Then the fragrances of holiness exhaled, and the sweet
odors were diffused.  The breeze of the divine spring
blew, and the fruitful winds of infinite generosity passed
by from the point of favor.  The brilliant morning
dawned and the glad-tidings of the greatest gift were
announced.  The divine spring appeared throughout the
contingent world.  The earth of existence moved and
the material world was put in motion.  The barren and
dried up soil turned into an eternal garden, and the inanimate
earth was endowed with eternal life.  The
flowers and myrtles of knowledge grew, and the fresh
herbage of the knowledge of God flourished.  The material
world showed forth the bounties of the Merciful,
and the visible world displayed the scene of the invisible
world.  The call of God was raised, the divine banquet
celebrated, the cup of the Testament was circulated and
the universal acclamation was uttered!


+P 371
     Among the people, a multitude became intoxicated
with this divine wine--and a multitude were deprived
of this great favor.  Many a soul enlightened his sight
and insight by the radiance of grace, and many were
cheered and rejoiced at the melodies of unity.  Some
birds sang melodies and harmonies, and some nightingales
began to warble on the branches of the rose-tree
of mercifulness.  The Kingdom and the phenomenal
world were adorned, and became the envy of the delectable
paradise--but, alas--and a thousand times alas!--
that the heedless souls are still in the sleep of negligence,
and the ignorant are keeping clear of this holy gift.
The blind are veiled, the deaf are bereft and the dead
despair of attaining to it; just as it is said (in the Koran)
"They despair of the life to come, as the infidels despair
(of the resurrection of) those who dwell in the graves."
     As to you--O friends of the Merciful!--move your
tongues to thank the Loving Lord, and employ yourselves
in praising and glorifying the Beauty of the
Adored One, for ye were granted the privilege to be
exhilarated from this most pure cup, and became full
of cheer and attraction from this goblet of wine.  Ye
have perfumed your nostrils with the fragrances of sanctity,
and delighted your senses with the scent of the
garment of the Joseph of faithfulness.  Ye tasted the
honey of devotion from the hand of the Unique Beloved
and partook of the eternal table at the feast of
the blessing of the Presence of the Unity.  This favor
is one of the special gifts of the Presence of the Merciful,
and this grace and generosity is one of the incomparable
gifts of our Loving Lord.  this is in accordance
with what Christ said:  "Many are called, but few


+P 372
chosen."  That is to say, there are many who are invited,
but those souls who are signalized with the grace
and favor of guidance are but very rare.  "This is the
bounty of God; He will give the same unto whom He
pleaseth; and God is endowed with great bounty."
     O friends of God! the candle of the Testament is surrounded
by the hypocritical winds of the people of the
world and the nightingale of faithfulness is surprised
by the crows of ill-nature--the violators.  The mindless
birds of night are plotting against the dove of commemoration
and the ferocious beasts are prowling after
the gazelle of the plain of the love of God.  So, He
is in great danger and painful affliction.
     The beloved of God must be as firm as a mountain,
and must not quiver under the most violent shock, nor
grieve at the greatest calamities; but must be as a solid
foundation.  They must cling to the hem of Glory and
trust in the Beauty of the Most High.  They must lean
on the help and assistance of the Ancient Kingdom and
confide in the care and protection of the Generous Lord.
They must at every instant nourish and refresh themselves
with the dew of favor, and in every breath revive
and cheer themselves through the waves of the Holy
Spirit, raise themselves to serve the Cause of the Supreme,
and endeavor their utmost to diffuse the breath
of God.  they must be as a strongly fortified fortress
for the defense of the blessed Cause, and as a well-made
fortification for the protection of the hosts of the
Pre-existent Beauty.  They must in all conditions faithfully
guard the edifice of the Cause of God, and be
scintillating stars on the horizon of the visible; because
the gloomy darkness of all nations prevailed from all


+P 373
directions, and all the creeds of the world are plotting
to quench their evident light.  Notwithstanding the
strenuous opposition of all tribes, how can ye continue
heedless thereof?  So, ye must be conscious and aware
thereof, and be ready to guard and preserve the Cause
of the Creator.  For this day the most necessary duty
is to purify your morals, to correct your manners, and
to improve your deeds.  The beloved of the Merciful
must appear with such morals and habits among the
creatures that the fragrant odor of the garden of sanctity
may perfume all the horizons and may quicken all
the dead souls, because the Manifestation of Divinity
and the dawning of the infinite lights of the Invisible
is intended for the education of souls and the refinement
of the morals of all in existence, so that some
blessed souls may be delivered from the gloomy world
of brutality and be characterized with attributes which
tend to adorn the being of man; that the earthly people
may become godlike, the dark ones may become illuminated,
the uninstructed ones may become familiar
with the mystery of the Kingdom, and the mortal souls
may be associated with the Immortal Splendor; the deprived
ones may partake of the endless sea, and the
ignorant may drink from the living water of knowledge;
the savage may give up their ferocity, and the cruel may
become forbearing; that the warlike may search after
true conciliation and the pitiless savages may be favored
with ideal peace; that the degraded may learn
about the condition of purity and the soiled ones may
attain to the stream of sanctity.  If these divine bounties
do not appear in the being of men, the bounty of the


+P 374
Divine Manifestation will prove fruitless and the splendor
of the Sun of Truth will become without effect.
     So, O beloved of God, endeavor with your hearts
and souls, that ye may be qualified with the morals and
attributes of the Blessed Perfection, and partake of the
bounties of His sanctity; that ye may become signs of
unity and standards of oneness, discover the essence of
singleness and sing harmonies and lays in in this divine
garden, in merciful melodies; that ye may become as
thankful birds, and sing a song in the rose-garden of
existence which may astonish minds and senses; that ye
may hoist a standard on the apex of the universe which
may flutter in the winds of favor, and plant a tree in
the field of the visible world which may bring forth
fruits of the utmost delicacy and freshness.
     I swear by the Ideal Educator that, if ye act in
compliance with the divine exhortations, as revealed in
brilliant Tablets, this gloomy earth will become a mirror
of the Exalted Kingdom, and the inferior page will
display the Kingdom of Abha!
     O friends of God!  Praise be unto God that the invisible
bounties of the Sun of Truth are encompassing
you from all directions, and the doors of mercy are
opened from all parts.  Now is the time to be benefited
and filled therewith.  Seize the opportunity, and
lose not the chance.  Keep yourselves entirely clear of
the world's conditions of gloom, and show forth the
characters and qualities of divine souls, that ye may
consider to what an extent the radiance of the Divine
Sun is shining and brilliant, and how the signs of favor
are showing forth from the invisible World of Unity.
     O friends of God!  Praise be unto God that His


+P 375
Imperial Majesty, the Shah, acts with the utmost kindness,
and His Highness, the Prime Minister, is practising
the greatest fairness and equity towards the people.
So, the friends of God must night and day pray for the
permanence of the glorious empire, and raise themselves
to return thanks to His Majesty for his justice,
equity and kindness, because this is one of the indisputable
commandments of God, as revealed in all
celestial books.

To the beloved of God in Persia!
     O ye dear friends of Abdul-Baha!  It is some time
since any heart-thrilling melody hath reached the ear
of life from certain countries, and life and conscience
have not found happiness and joy.  Howbeit all are
remembered at all times and are indeed present before
the sight.  For, verily, the chalice of the heart is overflowing
with the wine of the love of the friends; and
their attachment and the desire to see them flow and
circulate in the veins and arteries, even as the spirit.
     In this condition it is evident how sad and grieved
the heart is.  In this storm of ordeal, whose wave hath
reached the Supreme Apogee, and the arrow of hate
hath come in succession from the six points; with every
breath there is bewildering news and every day astonishing
signs in the Blessed Spot.
     The center of violation+F1 supposed that through mere
pride the foundation of the Covenant and Testament
could be destroyed and that the righteous ones would
shun and disobey the ordinances of God.  Therefore,


------------------------
1.     unkind brother.
+P 376
he spread writings of suspicion to all parts and busied
himself with secret plans.
     At one time he cried that "The Divine Foundation
is overthrown, the law of God is abrogated, therefore
the Covenant and Testament of God are annulled!"
Again, he moaned and grieved that "We are exiles and
captives, hungry and thirsty, night and day!"  One day
he effected disturbance and commotion, saying, "The
Oneness of God is abolished, and the Manifestation,
before the lapse of a thousand years, hath appeared!"+F1
     Upon finding that these fictions were not successful,
he gradually planned corruptions and caused commotion.
He grasped every garment (means); he calumniated
to the government and he became acquainted
with some of the unfriendly, associated and became confidential
with them.  Together they compiled a report
and presented it to the center of the government, which
disturbed the members of the cabinet.
     Among their fictitious reports was this:  That this
oppressed one+F3 has hoisted the banner of independence;
upon that banner he has inscribed "Ya Baha El-Abha!"
and circulated it in all this country,+F4 in the cities and
hamlets, even among the tribes in the desert, and that
he has summoned them all to assemble under the
banner.
     O God, verily I seek shelter in Thee from this action
which is contrary to the precepts of Baha', nay, it is a
great wrong, committed only by every persistent sinner.


------------------------
1.    accusation that Abdul-Baha was claiming to be a Manifestation who is
2.    promised after a lapse of a thousand years.
3.
4.
+P 377
For Thou hast enjoined upon us obedience to kings and
rulers!
     Among the fictions was that the building upon Mt.
Carmel was purposed to be a fort, built with perfect
solidity and strength, assigned it to be the "illumined
city" and made the Holy Tomb, the Sacred Mecca;
when in truth that is a building containing six vaults.
     Among other fictions was, that he has founded a new
monarchy (kingdom) and that he has called all the
friends to this great wrong.  God forbid; God forbid;
God forbid!  Praise be to Thee!+F1 --this is a great
calumny!--that since the Sacred Tomb+F2 has become a
visiting center for the world, it shall be a great misfortune
to the country and to the public!  and that the
center of violation is not connected with these affairs,
nay rather, he is a Suni, Sanavi, Bekri, and Omari.+F3
That he knows the Blessed Perfection+F4 to be only one
of the reformers among the people, and a follower of
the Path, and that these affairs were instituted by this
oppressed one.
     In short, an inquisitory body was appointed by the
center of the great government--may her glory increase!
--and was sent to this land, taking up its abode
directly in the home of one of the plaintiffs.  The parties
who joined in compiling the report and who were
co-partners of my brother were sent for and questioned
regarding the truth of the report.  They amplified the
contents of the report, explained them, confirmed them
and above all added to them.  They were the plaintiffs,

1.    expression of astonishment.
2.     Tomb of the Bab on Mt. Carmel.
3.     expressions are intended to convey the inference that he is orthodox.
4.
+P 378
the witnesses and the judge.  Now that body hath returned
to the Capital and every day terrible and frightful
news is received.
     But Abdul-Baha--praise be to God!--is in perfect
peace, composure and rest.  He is not even disturbed
through this calumny and fiction, but rather hath
referred all affairs to the pre-ordained decree and in
perfect joy and happiness is ready to give up his life,
expecting every ordeal.
     Praise be to God!--the kind friends of God are also
in a state of resignation and submissiveness.  All are
happy, thankful, joyful, and content.  But the center
of violation presumed that after the shedding of the
blood of this oppressed one, or the throwing of him into the
Mediterranean Sea, he will become nameless, traceless
and forgotten, and that he [himself] would find an
arena to gallop in and could win, with the spear of
suspicions and fictions, the object of his hopes and
desire.  In vain!  In vain!  If there be no permanence
to the fragrance of the musk of faithfulness, will any
one be attracted by the vile odor of jealousy?  If the
deer of God be torn asunder by dogs and wolves, no
one will run after the blood-thirsty wolf.  If the nightingale
of significances end his days, no one will listen
to the croaking of the raven, nor to the cawing of the
crow.  what vain imagination is this, and what an ignorant
display!  Their actions are like unto a mirage
in the desert, which the thirsty imagines to be water,
but when he reaches it, finds it to be nothing.
     In sooth, O ye friends of God, make firm your feet
and heart, make perfect resolve through the power of


+P 379
confirmation of the Blessed Beauty; engage in the service
of the Cause of God and withstand the nations and
the peoples with the firmness, the solidity and and the steadfastness
of the people of Baha'.  Thus may others
wonder how these hearts are fountains of trust and
mines of the love of His Majesty, the Merciful One.
Thus may ye remain unshaken by the painful occurrences
in the Holy Land, and may remain firm through the
disastrous events.  If all the friends oppose (the Cause
of God) with sword and one remain (firm), he will be
the proclaimer of God, a divine herald, and will stand
before all upon the earth.
     In sooth, you must not mind the events in the Radiant
Spot.  The Holy Land is ever in danger and the flood
of ordeal comes from every side, for the call hath become
world-wide and the summons hath spread throughout
the earth, and enemies, both the unfamiliar and the
familiar, are engaged in their plans, their stratagems
and schemes to calumniate; and it is evident that such
a place is in danger, for against calumny there is no
defence, nay rather, some wandering oppressed souls
are imprisoned in a fortress, having no helper, assistant
nor shelter from the sword of accusation and the teeth
of calumny, save God!
     Ye must think of this:  How many dear friends have
hastened to the divine altar; how many blessed souls
have sacrificed life; what holy blood was shed; what
pure hearts were drowned in blood; how many breasts
were offered as targets for the arrows of malice, and
how many sanctified bodies were cut to pieces.  What
is our duty?  To be thinking of our own life and to
dissimulate and associate with enemies and friends, or


+P 380
should we also follow the righteous and walk in the
footprints of those who are great?
     The numbered days (of life) will vanish away, and
the present existence disappear.  The garden of being
will lose its freshness and fragrance, the orchard of
mirth will miss its joy and beauty.  The spring of life
will change into the autumn of death, the joy of happiness
of the palaces will change into the gloomy darkness
of the grave.  Therefore, it is not worth attachment
and the wise person will not set his heart thereon.
The wise and great man seeketh heavenly glory and
divine might, desireth eternal life and seeketh nearness
to the Threshold of God.
     For in the tavern of the mortal world the bile of the
man of God is not removed.  He will not rest a moment
here and will not stain himself with the attachments of
the world.  Nay, rather, the friends are the stars of
the summit of Providence and the planets of the firmament
of Guidance.  with perfect strength do they dispel
darkness and destroy the foundation of envy and
enmity.  They wish for the world and its denizens
unity and peace; they destroy the basis of war and
strife; they seek integrity, faithfulness and friendliness,
and are well-wishes even of the evil-disposed enemy.
Thus they make this prison of infidelity the sublime
mansion of fidelity, and this dungeon of envy a delectable
paradise.
     O ye friends, endeavor with life and heart that this
world may become the mirror of the world of the Kingdom;
that the earthly kingdom be filled with the bounty
of the heavenly; that the voice of the Supreme Concourse
may be raised in commendation, and that the


+P 381
traces of the bounty and grace of the Beauty of Abha
may envelop the earth!
     His honor, Ameen+F1 , hath praised highly the honored
servants and the maid-servants of the Manifest Light;
commending each one separately and eulogizing the
firmness and steadfastness of all; that--praise be to
God!--the friends and maid-servants of the Merciful
in all Persia are in perfect resignation and firm and
steadfast, like unto a firm and solid foundation, and in
an absolute state of ecstasy and attraction are engaged
in spreading the fragrance of the Lord of Lords.
     Through this news, at this time of great jeopardy,
much happiness was realized, for the supreme hope and
desire of this oppressed one is the spirituality of the
hearts and the radiance of the beings of the friends.
When this gift is obtained every ordeal is for him as an
abundant bounty and a great shower.
     O my God!  O my God!  Thou seest me drowned
in the sea of ordeals, seized upon by the fire of infidelity,
with tears flowing in the dark night rolling in the
bed of sleeplessness, mine eyes expectant to see the dawn
of the lights of Faith.  And when I am anxious, as the
fish whose bowels are inflamed upon the dust, I anticipate
the manifestation of Thy bounties from all
sides!
     O Lord!  Surround the friends in other regions with
Thy great bounties and uplift those who are weak
among Thy chosen, through Thy strength and providence,
in every remote place!
     O Lord, verily they are the captives of Thy love and
the prisoners of Thy host, the birds of the atmosphere

of Thy guidance, the fish of the sea of Thy providence,
the stars of the horizon of Thy bounty, the army of
the fortress of Thy law, the banners of Thy remembrance,
the eyes of Thy mercy, the fountains of Thy
grace and the springs of Thy generosity.  Therefore,
guard them with the eye of kindness, confirm them in
promoting Thy Word, strengthen their hearts in Thy
love, reinforce their backs in Thy service, make firm
their loins in Thy servitude, spread through them Thy
fragrances, reveal through them Thy signs, manifest
through them Thy proofs, accomplish through them
Thy words and perfect through them Thy mercy!
     Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, and,
verily, thou art the Clement, the Merciful!

El-Baha, praise, light, blessing and peace be upon thee,+F1
       O thou fire of the Love of God, thou light of the
       Kingdom of God, thou radiance of the Gift of
       God, thou peerless pearl in the Sea of the Mercy
       of God, thou sturdy lion in the Jungle of the
       Guidance of God!
     I testify that, verily, thou hast believed in God, thou
hast become assured of the Verses of God, thou hast
trusted in the appearance of the Kingdom of God, thou
hast turned unto God, thou hast kept firm in the Covenant
of God, thou hast served the Cause of God, thou
hast endeavored to promote the Word of God, and
thou hast suffered martyrdom in the path of God.  May
the soul of men be a sacrifice to thee!
     Blessed is the land which is reddened by thy blood!

1.     recitation when visiting the tomb of his honor Aka-Reza, of Isfand-Abad,

       The chief religious magistrate of the locality commissioned a number of
       men to enter his home at night and they shot him to death.
+P 383
Blessed is the heart which is burnt with the fire of thine
afflictions!  Blessed is the eye which weeps over thy
disaster!  Blessed are the hearts which are consumed
by thy calamities!  Blessed are the bosoms which are
rent asunder by thy sufferings!
     Praise be unto thee!  Exaltation be unto thee!
Faithfulness be unto thee!  O thou sign of guidance
and thou standard of great martyrdom!
     O that the bullets which shot thee were shot at the
breast of Abdul-Baha!  O that the darts which pierced
thee would strike the heart of Abdul-Baha!  By the
might of my Lord, afflictions are much more favored by
Abdul-Baha than the honey of life, inasmuch as this
cup is overflowing with the gift of God.
     Blessed is the one who attaineth to visit thy grave!
Blessed is the forehead which is set against thy tomb!
Blessed is the man who serves thy sepulchre!  Blessed
is the person who lights a lamp+F1 at thy resting-place!
     I beg of God to cause spheres of light to descend upon
thy sepulchre and the clouds of mercy to shower
rains of forgiveness upon thy resting-place and tomb!
     Verily, He is the Compensator, the Beneficent, the
Giver!

O thou peerless, matchless, glorious martyr!+F3

tomb, which is perfumed by the fragrances of sanctity

of sacrifice, hath expended his life in the path of God,
and hath shed his blood on the earth in love for the

denied thy dignity, were veiled from beholding the gift

1.     recitation when visiting the tomb of his honor Aka-Zaman, of Isfand-Abad,
2.     Persia, who suffered martyrdom in 1901.  He was delivered into the
       hands of a mob, who brought him out of prison, made him ride an ox
       and paraded him through the streets.  Many struck him with stones
       and clubs, and wounded him.  While he was surrounded by this
       general assault and uproar and the people danced and clapped their
       hands in joy, Aka-Zaman himself also clapped his hands with them, and
       evinced great joy on account of his approaching martyrdom.  Then a
       wretch from behind cut off his ear and stuffed it into the martyr's
       mouth, but he did not even turn nor move.  Finally they put him to
       death with all kinds of wounds and with the severest persecutions, and
       stoned him.  Then they dragged away his body from under the heaps
       of stones and burned it along with the body of his honor Aka-Seyed-
       Jaffar.
+P 386
matchless among the chosen ones and art fortunate
among the pious!  Blessed art thou, for they pierced
thy shining brow with a nail, and suspended upon it
thine outward decoration, tortured thee by reins, made
thee to ride on a furious bull, paraded thee in the city,
cut off thine ear with a sharp-edged blade, and by force
and compulsion made thee to devour it, tormented thee
with the torture of the wicked, persecuted thee with a
rage like unto the ferocity of ravenous wolves of the
plain and desert, and consumed thy pure body with the
torture of fire!
     Blessed is the pure blood which was shed on the perfumed
soil, and which was poured out in the path of the
forgiving Lord!  Blessed is thy body which was burned
by the hand of every transgressor!  Blessed is thy
throat which was cut by the poniard of every traitor!
Blessed is thy breast which was stricken by the oppressors'
darts!  Blessed is thy heart which was wounded
by a sharp sword!  Blessed art thou, for thou hast
showed forth all happiness and joy when hou wert
being paraded in the streets of the people of haughtiness
and the people of wickedness were clapping their hands
and oppressing thee with innumerable blows and
wounds, whilst thou wert clapping thy hands with them
--O thou manifestor of light!--and wert warbling melodies,
whereby the people of the Kingdom of El-Abha
were moved and breasts dilated (with joy)!
     By God, the True One!  Verily, Abdul-Baha inhaleth
the odor of faithfulness from that remote region,
the soil of which is reddened by thy pure blood, and
beholdeth the lights of bestowal successively pouring upon
thy resplendent tomb, and the rains of grace dropping

thee be bestowal, O thou honorable martyr, who hast
severed thyself from all things in the pah of thine
Ancient Lord, who hast sacrificed thy soul, blood and
body in the path of thy Most Beautiful Beloved One!
     Upon thee be grace from thy Lord, the Exalted!

O ye+F1 beloved servants of Abdul-Baha and the maid-servants
       of the Merciful One!
     It is the early dawn and the soul-refreshing breeze of
the Paradise of Abha is wafting upon all the contingent
beings, but it displays the effect only in pure hearts
and perfumes only the healthy mind.  A seeing eye beholdeth
the splendors of the sun and a hearing ear
listeneth to the melody of the Supreme Concourse.  Although
the mercy of the vernal shower and the heavenly
outpouring descend upon all the earth, yet only from a
virgin soil vegetation groweth while the brackish ground
is deprived and unproductive, for the traces of the outpouring
are not evident and manifest.  Now the holy
Fragrances of Abha are diffused in every clime, but
only the spiritual souls are attracted and draw benefits.
It is hoped by this imprisoned one, from the bounty
of the Living Self-Subsistent, that, through the dominating
power of the Word of God, the nostrils of the


------------------------
1.    the assembly of Zanjan, Persia.
+P 388
heedless ones becomes opened and partake a share from
the fragrances of the Rose-Garden of Mystery.
     O ye friends of God!  The real friends are the skillful
physicians and the divine instructions are the antidote
of the Merciful One and the remedies of the
hearts.  They (the believers) heal the nostril affected
with rheum, make mindful the negligent ones, give a
share to the deprived ones and make hopeful the hopeless
ones.  In this day if anyone liveth in accord with the
heavenly teachings and instructions, he shall become a
spiritual physician to the world of humanity and the
trumpet of Israfel+F1 to quicken the dead; for the confirmations
of the Kingdom of Abha are uninterrupted
and the victory of the Supreme Concourse is the associate
of every one who is pure in heart.  The weak
gnat will become the strong royal falcon and the sparrow
is transformed into the eagle soaring toward the
apex of the Ancient Glory.  Therefore, look ye not
upon your own capability and merit, nay rather, lay
your confidence in the bounty and protection, favor and
grace of the Blessed Perfection--may my life be a
sacrifice to His beloved ones!--and, mounting upon the
charger of magnanimity, rush ye toward the arena of
martyrdom, so that ye may win the polo of favors in
this vast field of God!
     O ye maid-servants of the Merciful One!  The
queens of the world went down to the tombs and disapeared
and vanished from the face of the earth.
There remained for them no fruit, no name, no trace,
no fame and no existence.  But every one of the maid-servants
in the court of Oneness shone forth like unto


------------------------
1.     of the angels of the "Resurrection day," mentioned in the Koran.
+P 389
the brilliant stars from the glorious Ancient Horizon,
cast their rays upon centuries and cycles, attained to
their utmost desires in the Kingdom of Abha and
drank from the wine of meeting (with God) in the
Assembly of the Almighty.  These souls have taken
a share from (the benefits) of being and obtained results.
     O ye friends of the wronged one!  Purify your
eyes from beholding [any as] strangers.  Do ye not see
foreignness, nay rather, know all as friends; for with
the observation of strangeness, the practice of love and
unity is difficult.
     In this wonderful age, according to the divine texts,
ye must befriend all nations and communities.  Ye must
not look upon violence, force, evil intentions, persecutions
or hostility, nay rather, ye must raise your eyes
to the horizon of glory [and see] that each one of
these creatures is a sign of the Lord of Signs and [has]
stepped upon the arena of existence through divine
favor and supreme energy.  Thus they are known and
not unknown, are friends and not strangers.  We must
deal with all according to the above criterion.
     Therefore, the beloved must, with infinite kindness
and love, associate and sympathize with both friends
and strangers and not look at all upon the merits and
capabilities of the persons.  Under all circumstances
they must show forth genuine love and be not defeated
by the intensity of rancor, hatred, quarrel, malice and
the grudge of the people.  Should they (they people)
shoot arrows they (the friends) must administer milk
and honey; if they give poison, the believers must impart
delicacies; if they cause pain, let the beloved be a


+P 390
remedy; if they strike a blow, let them become the antidote.
     O my God!  O my God!  Verily, these are Thy
weak servants and Thy submissive, faithful ones and
Thy sincere maid-servants who are humbled before
Thy illumined Threshold, acknowledging Thy Oneness
which hath appeared like unto the appearance of the
sun in midday, listening to Thy call from Thy mysterious
Kingdom and uttering Thy prayers with hearts
overflowing with Thy love and devotion!
     O my Lord!  Pour upon all of them the rain of Thy
mercy, [cause to] descend upon every one the showers
of Thy bounty from the clouds of Thy munificence,
make them graceful plants in Thy divine Rose-garden
and suffer these myrtles to become verdant, green and
refreshed by the outpouring from the Cloud of Thy
Singleness.
     Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Most High, the
Mighty and Omnipotent, and the Creator of the earth
and heaven, and verily there is no God but Thee, the
Lord of the Manifest Signs!

O servants+F1 of the Blessed Beauty!
     It is a well known fact that, owing to the frequency
of disturbances, the work of delivering the Message
hath been for a short time discontinued.  In consequence,
persons travel less frequently to the different
parts of the country.  It is known and clear that today
the unseen divine assistance encompasseth those who
deliver the Message.  And if the work of delivering


------------------------
1.    the assembly of Teheran, Persia.
+P 391
the Message be neglected, the assistance shall be entirely
cut off, for it is impossible that the friends of God
could receive assistance unless they be engaged in delivering
the Message.  Under all conditions the Message
must be delivered, but with wisdom.  If it be not
possible openly, it must be done quietly.  The friends
should be engaged in educating the souls and should
become instruments in aiding the world of humanity to
acquire spiritual joy and fragrance.  For example:  If
every one of the friends (believers) were to establish
relations of friendship and right dealings with one of
the negligent souls, associate and live with him with
perfect kindliness, and meanwhile through good conduct
and moral behavior lead him to divine instruction,
to heavenly advice and teachings, surely he would gradually
arouse that negligent person and would change
his ignorance into knowledge.
     Souls are liable to estrangement.  Such methods
should be adopted that the estrangement should be first
removed, then the Word will have effect.
     If one of the believers be kind to one of the negligent
ones and with perfect love should gradually make
him understand the reality of the Cause of God in such
a way that the latter should know in what manner the
Religion of God hath been founded and what its object
is, doubtless he will become changed; excepting abnormal
souls who are reduced to the state of ashes and
whose hearts are like stones, yea, even harder.
     If by this method every one of the friends of God
were to try to lead one soul to the right path, the number
of the believers would be doubled every year.  But
this should be carried out with perfect wisdom and in


+P 392
such a manner that no harm would ever result therefrom.
     In the same way those who deliver the Message
should travel to all parts of the country.  And if delivering
the Message should be the cause of disturbance,
let them then be engaged in encouraging and
educating the friends, in order that those souls receive
spiritual attraction and rejoice, seek delight and ecstasy,
acquire new life and through the fragrances of sanctity
gain vivacity and freshness.
     The object is this, that in the time of peace and
safety this work of delivering the Message should be
carried on with the utmost fervor.  But when there is
no peace and safety, extreme wisdom should be exercised,
though no complete cessation of effort is permissible,
for in that case the divine assistance shall be
entirely cut off.
     With regard to the formation of benevolent associations,
surely this subject should be given due attention.
The disciples of His Holiness Christ--may my life be
a sacrifice unto Him!--were only eleven persons and
they had established a benevolent fund.  So the establishment
of the fund had that degree of importance.

O ye+F1 sincere ones!  O ye favored ones!  O ye beseeching
       ones!  O ye supplicating ones!
     Verily, I set my forehead on the dust and turn my
face toward the Lord of Lords and invoke my Lord
with intense fervor and attraction, that He may look
upon you with the glances of the eye of His providence,
watch over you with the gaze of His protection, unite

rejoice you with gladness, exhilarate you with the chalices
of salvation, make you steadfast in the divine Cause
and that He may enable you to cling to the hem of
the Almighty, to hasten toward the place of sacrifice
and to be sheltered under the shadow of the Blessed
Tree whose roots are planted firm and whose branches
are extended to heaven:
     O my Lord! O my Lord!  These are the chosen
ones whose faces are illumined with the light of guidance,
who found the heavenly table pleasing to their
tastes, who submitted willingly to every matter which
happened in the land and sought help from the hosts of
the Supreme Concourse.  Their feet are indeed made
firm, their banners hoisted, their deeds righteous and
their actions just.  O Lord!  Make them fragrant
plants of Thy paradise, flowers of the garden of nearness,
verses of Thy glorious book, words of Thy "Published
tablet" unto the people of the world and as falcons
soaring on the loftiest summit.  Verily Thou art
the Beneficent, the Merciful, the Powerful, the Mighty,
the Bestower!
     O my dear friends!  Yours was not merely a letter;
it was perfumed with amber and diffused a sweet fragrance.
Every word thereof was a rose in the rose-garden
of the love of God and was a flower, a hyacinth.
     When the breeze of Providence blows from the direction
of gift, the gardens of hearts attain thereby exceeding
purity and freshness.  Such significances arise
from the soul and consciousness and impart joy and
fragrance.


+P 394
     O friends!  It is the wish of Abdul-Baha that the
friends may establish general unity and not a particular
meeting of unity.  You must have great consideration
for this fact, for during the past cycles though such
events (founding of particular, i.e., exclusive unity
meetings) were, in the beginning, a means for harmony,
they became in the end the cause of trouble.
     We are all servants of one Threshold, attendants at
one Court, waves of one sea, drops of one stream, the
dust before one door and plants of one garden.  There
must arise no trouble to deprive one from that which
is the real purpose.  The beloved of God must be
friendly even with strangers and intimate even with
outsiders--how much more with others among the
righteous (i.e., believers)!
     To organize assemblies is praiseworthy and acceptable,
but these must be established for certain matters.
For example:  Assemblages for teaching (the Truth),
gatherings for the spread of the fragrances of God,
gatherings for the relief of the orphans, gatherings for
the protection (i.e., feeding, etc.,) of the poor, assemblages
for the spread of learning and, in a word,
there must be gatherings for matters which concern the
well-being of men, such as organizations of a society of
commerce, societies for the expansion of agriculture.
To be brief, similar societies are very acceptable and
praiseworthy and concern all in general and not a particular
number.
     In a word:  That which is conducive to the life (or
growth) of the people is acceptable and whatever is the
cause of disaffection is blameworthy.  I hope all the
friends of the East and West shall rest in the same


+P 395
assemblage and adorn one gathering, appearing with
all the heavenly attributes and virtues in the world of
humanity.
     O my Lord!  O my Lord!  Enable me to witness the
most great sign and to realize the fulfillment of this
hope throughout all regions.  Verily Thou art the
Bestower, the Beneficent, whose bounties are great!
     Some of the friends have asked to present themselves
in these parts.  In these days this does not conform
with wisdom.  God willing, permission shall be
given at some favorable time.

     +F1 Glory be unto Thee, O Thou whose mercy hath encompassed
all things, whose gift is made perfect, whose
power hath encircled the world, whose proof is demonstrated,
whose signs have become manifest, whose words
are promulgated, whose arguments are established and
whose ensigns are hoisted!  Praise be unto Thee for
that which Thou hast bestowed!  Thanks be unto Thee
for that which Thou hast granted!  Glorification behooveth
Thee for Thou hast manifested Thyself!  Glory
be unto Thee  Glory be unto Thee!  How inaccessible
is Thy station!  How manifest is Thy proof and how
all-embracing is Thy munificence!
     Verily the dark night hath been spreading its wings
over all the regions and the face of the heaven and earth
was hidden behind the clouds of inky gloom and blackness--
wherefore the sights were veiled from beholding
the most great signs and inner perceptions were blinded

and unable to find the fire of divine guidance; souls
were wandering in the desert of error and heedlessness
and the possessors of intelligence were lost in the wilderness
of amazement and skepticism, crying and weeping
as a mother bereft of her babe--bewailing and lamenting
like unto a thirsty one in the midst of a vast and
boundless Sahara!
     But through Thy greatest bounty, the glorious dawn
broke and the lightning of guidance flashed from the
Supreme Horizon upon the face of heaven!  Then the
First Point (the Bab) appeared among mankind with
the glad-tidings of Thy Manifestation, the fragrances
of Thy Holiness and the verses of Thy Singleness,
spreading Thy good news, heralding Thy Name, declaring
and praising Thee in numerous epistles!
     Thine is favor for this gift which hath cheered the
souls of the pure ones!  Thine is generosity for Thou
hast enabled every righteous and devoted one to adore
Thee by causing the Sun of Truth to shine upon all
the regions of existence!  Thine is glory and excellence!
Thine is power and beauty!  Thine is sovereignty and
authority!  Thine is dominion and kingdom!  Thine is
exaltation and omnipresence!  Thine is divinity and
lordship!  For thou hast manifested Thy bounty from
the horizon of emanation, rent asunder the veil and
raised the covering from Thy illumined countenance
in the promised day and shone forth upon the world of
being with the rays gleaming from the dawn of revelation!
     Then the "Resurrection" appeared, the "Day ofd
Judgment" became manifest, the "earth" heaved and
shook, the "mountains" were levelled, the "seas" boiled,

the "sun" was eclipsed, the "luminaries" were darkened,
the "stars" scattered, the "signs" became known, the
"bridge" expanded, the "conditions" were fulfilled, the
"balance" was set up, the "fire" burned fiercely and the
"paradise" became begemmed!--wherefore the devoted
ones entered into delectable gardens with beatitude and
the veiled ones were left to amuse themselves with their
own imaginations; the possessors of perception beheld
the lights and those whose eyes were weak vanished in
gloomy darkness before the appearance of the mid-day
Sun!
     Then those whose ears were unstopped and open
rejoiced in listening to the call, while the deaf (or ignorant)
were astonished , crying out, "What is the cause
of this acclamation and rejoicing?"  Then the fluent
speakers loosened their tongues in thanksgiving and
glorification, while the dumb became as hard and lifeless
stones; then the souls were purified, the hearts were
attracted, the breasts were dilated, the characters were
sanctified, the secret thoughts became manifest and the
realities stepped into the arena of existence; they sought
illumination, were guided, became ablaze, enflamed and
enkindled, called forth and proclaimed, saying:
  "Glad-tidings be unto the righteous ones!  Rejoicing
     be unto the perceiving ones!  Happiness be
     unto the favored ones!  Joy be unto the yearning
     ones!  Cheerfulness be unto the attracted ones!

     O ye merciful friends of Abdul-Baha!  At this
moment a letter hath been received from America containing
the good news that that region of the Occident
hath become the Orient; that is, in that region the rays
of the Sun of Truth have appeared and shone forth
with such penetration that the bright light of the morn
of guidance hath dawned and every longing one hath
attained to the desire of this heart, and that the melody
of the Kingdom of Abha ascends continuously to the
Supreme Concourse and the soul-refreshing strains of
"Ya Baha El-Abha!" reach the ears of the peoples and
communities of that country.
     According to what they have written, they have celebrated
the day of the "Birth anniversary" in twenty-four
cities by giving public feasts and beautiful receptions.
They have spent that day in the utmost joy and
happiness, they have sent out general invitations, spread
the table of gifts, engaged in the commemoration of
the True One and in imparting glad-tidings to each
other.  Likewise, letters of congratulation and felicitation
have been received from these twenty-four cities
and assemblies.  Consider ye what influence the penetrative
power of the Word of God hath displayed in
existence and how the universe is stirred and moved


+P 400
through it!  How in America on the "Birth anniversary"
such feasting and banqueting is prepared!  How
the remote ones have become the near ones and how
the customs and habits of the East are spread abroad!
This is the penetrative power of the Word of God and
this is the might of the subduing desire of God!
     O ye friends of God and maid-servants of the Merciful!
His honor Ameen+F1 hath mentioned you with the
highest praise and commendation, saying that, thank
God, the believers in all parts of the cities and towns
are the manifestations of bounties and the dawning-places
of justice and equity; are mindful, obedient, kind-hearted
and steadfast; are engaged in reading the verses
and occupied with spreading the signs; are in the utmost
ecstasy and exhilaration and intoxicated with the pure
wine; are active in praising and adoring the Most
Great Name and intimate in paying homage to the
Holy Threshold; are living in accord with the divine
teachings and exhortations and are in every way endowed
with all human excellences and attributes; that
they are in the utmos unity and agreement and in great
zeal and enthusiasm; are kind to every soul and treat
all the communities with exceeding joy and fragrance;
that they have sympathy even for the enemies and are
faithful friends even to the unjust; that to the outsiders
they are as relatives and to the strangers they
are a swift-healing antidote instead of a poisonous
sting; are the servants of the world of humanity and
manifestors of the attributes of the Merciful One!
Blessed are they for this testimony, which is expressive
of the beauty of their characters and the merit of their

1.     of he teachers of the Bahai Revelation in Persia.
+P 401
virtues!  Truly, I say, his honor Ameen is the well-wisher
of all.  In the day of the Manifestation he was
the Ameen (Faithful) of the Blessed perfection+F1 and
in the days of the Covenant+F2 he is the confidant of this
yearning one.  Therefore, his testimony is heard and
accepted and his evidence is praised and beloved.
     O ye beloved of God!  According to what is heard,
some of the ulemas of the Sheite sect (Persian moslem
mullas), as well as some leaders of the Shekhei school,
are engaged constantly in instigating revolts and have
arisen against the government with enmity and opposition,
confusing the affairs of the state more than before.
     Praise be to God!+F3  What is this heedlessness and
ignorance and what is this antagonism and insubordination!
Verily, the Persian empire hath been at all times
deprived of every bounty on account of the encroaching
influence of the ritualistic mullas!  Whenever that just
government conceived a good intention to introduce reforms
and amelioration of conditions, these ignorant
leaders raised vehement opposition, protested severely
and prevented the introduction of measures which
would better conditions and spread culture and progress.
One must be just.  The intention of His Imperial
Majesty is higher and purer than all the other leaders
and chiefs, for the sole desire of the throne is the
peace and security of the inhabitants and the cultivation
and betterment of the conditions of the empire.
But alas! they do not give a moment's rest to the kind
Padeshah, in order that he may voluntarily and of his
own accord inaugurate reforms as much as may be
warranted by circumstances.

+P 402
     However, the inhabitants of Persia are not the only
ones who are afflicted with this ignorance and blindness.
The people of the imperial Ottoman government are
also in a state of the utmost ignorance and blindness.
Diversity of opinions and ignorance of factions do not
allow one breath of tranquility to the imperial government,
in order that it may adjust internal conditions and
rectify foreign relations.  Yet, under all these conditions,
His Imperial Majesty the Padeshah f the Ottomans
is intelligently directing the affairs.  The proof and
testimony of this assertion is the protection afforded
these exiled ones (in Acca) from the rebellious despotism
of the enemies.  If authority were in the people's
hands or in other hands than those of the government,
the conspiracies and seditions of inside and outside enemies
would have scattered even the ashes of this imprisoned
one to the winds.  But the forebearance, intelligence,
foresight, far-reaching wisdom and discernment
of His Imperial Majesty the Padeshah of the
Ottomans have so far protected these exiled ones, notwithstanding
the attacks of the calumniators and the
party of the slanderers.  We are of those who pray for
these two just kings and are grateful to these two equitable
sovereigns.
     Praise be unto God!  One of the imputations of the
enemies is this:  That--we seek refuge in God--we
deny the validity and truth of the Sun of Guidance, the
Lamp of the Supreme Concourse, the messenger of the
Almighty, His Highness Mohammed Mostafa--upon
Him be greeting and praise!--and that--God forbid!
--we have written books in His refutation.  Woe
unto those who have arisen to spread this great falsehood


+P 403
and calumny!  However, all the friends of God
who are informed of the mysteries know that this exiled
and imprisoned one would readily sacrifice his life at
the dust of the Prophet's feet.  Furthermore, the
Blessed Perfection-may my life be a sacrifice to His
beloved ones--in the book of Ighan, hath established
with invincible proofs and clear arguments the prophethood
of His Highness the Messenger--may my life be a
sacrifice to Him!--and also His Highness the Supreme
(the Bab) hath invoked Him (Mohammed) in many
supplications.  Notwithstanding all these evidences, the
unjust ones are crying out and secretly spreading the
falsehood that we--God forbid!--are His deniers and
the unfaithful friends (nakzeen) acknowledge these erroneous
imputations.  Praise be to God!  If we deny
the messengers and prophets of God, what have we to
say for ourselves?  Glory be unto Thee, O my God!
Verily this is a great calumny!
     To be brief, the aim is this:  Though the interference
of the ignorant and fanatical leaders the country
of Persia is in a state of decadence, although the pure
intention of His Imperial Majesty the crowned Shah
is for progress.  However, ye who are the well-wishers
of the government and are sincere, obedient and kind
toward it, be ye engaged always in service.  Should
any one of you enter into the service (or employment)
of the government, he must live and act with the utmost
truthfulness, righteousness, chastity, uprightness,
purity, sanctity, justice and equity.  But if--I seek refuge
in God--any one betray the least of trusts or
neglect and be remiss in the performance of duties which
are intrusted to him, or by oppression takes one penny


+P 404
of extortion from the subjects, or seeks after his own
personal, selfish aims and ends in the attainment of his
own interests, he shall undoubtedly remain deprived of
the outpourings of His Highness the Almighty!  Beware!
Beware! lest ye fall short in that which ye are
commanded in this Tablet!

O thou who art sweet tongued!

perfume your nostrils by the breath of purity
wafted from the garden of the Supreme Concourse,
cause you to enter the Ark of Safety, and reveal to you
the Manifest Signs.
     Verily this is a great bounty!  Verily this is a manifest
attainment!

O thou who art guided by the Light of Guidance!
     Verily, I am informed of thy confession of the Oneness
of God and thy being attracted to the fragrances
of God.  I implore unto God to make thee a sign of
guidance; thy face rejoicing among the maid-servants
of the Merciful, and thy heart severed from this world,
which weakeneth the hearts and spirits.

O thou whose breast is dilated by the Fragrances of
       God!
     Verily thy letter reached me and I prayed God to confirm
thee in guiding the people to the Manifestation of


+P 409
Lights; satisfying the thirsty ones with the pure and
peaceful water; leading the sick to the Glorious Physician;
guiding those who are led astray into the Path,
imparting the wine to those who are seeking, and feeding
the hungry souls with the food which descendeth
from the heaven of thy Lord, the Glorious!

O thou who seekest for the Will of God!
     Give thanks to God that thou entered the divine
Kingdom and knowest the heavenly Lord of Hosts!
     The light of truth hath radiated from the Sun of
Divinity to the horizons in such a manner that the East
and the West are illumined.  But, alas! the blind do not
see and the deaf do not hear the divine proclamation.
The bats do not perceive the light of the sun and the
beetles cannot enjoy the fragrances of a rose-garden.
     Consider that the horizons of the world were enlightened
through the light of the beauty of His Holiness
Christ; yet all the people were asleep, blind and sightless,
except a few whose eyes were opened and perceived
the lights.  Now thou shalt thank God that a beam of
the light came to thy sight.  I ask God that thine inner
sight may be illumined so that thou mayest discover the
hidden mysteries of the Kingdom of God.  If thou become
so, thou wilt be an evident light and a divine
angel in the celestial dominion; then it dependeth on
the divine confirmation, according to thy perseverance.

O thou seeker of the True One!
     In the day of Christ all nations were expecting that
His Holiness Christ should come from heaven, and He
came from heaven, though outwardly He came from


+P 410
the womb of Mary.  Hence, He hath said in the Gospels:
"No one shall ascend to heaven except the one
who hath come from heaven."  Now all the people expect
Him to come from heaven.
     If thou wishest to find the truth, compare the days
of the Manifestation of the Beauty of Abha with the
days of Christ; consider this is identically like that and
the same doubts and oppositions are put forth (by the
people).
     as to the proofs and arguments of the Beauty of
Abha, these are manifest like the sun.  If thou wishest
a discerning eye and seekest for a hearing ear, set
thou aside that which thou hast heard from fathers and
ancestors, for such things are imitation--and then seek
for the truth with the utmost attention until the divine
confirmation may reach thee and the matter may be
properly disclosed unto thee.

O thou cup overflowing with the Wine of the Love of
       God!
     Know, verily, that the doors of the Kingdom are being
opened to the East and West.  Verily the people
neglected the Name of their Lord after expectancy of
centuries and ages!  However, those whose consciences
were pure, whose hearts were sanctified, urge forward
thereto and enter therein through every door with faces
shining, hearts and spirits rejoiced.  thank God for
this great guidance and mighty gift!

O thou whose tongue is uttering the Name of God!
     Turn wholly unto the Lord of Hosts, "Glorious Station,"
the Manifest; be severed from all things, and


+P 411
hold to the robe of the Clement Lord, and enter into
the extended shade, until thy Lord confirmeth thee by
the fragrances of holiness in this promised day, wherein
the name of the Kingdom is celebrated and spread
in all regions.

O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!
     Verily, I read thy words of thanksgiving to God, for
He hath guided the beloved of God and His maid-servants
to the light of guidance and given them to
drink the cup filled with the wine of the most mighty
gift.  Verily, I beseech the Divine Might to strengthen
them by the Holy Spirit in all times and circumstances
so that they may be firm in the Cause of God and steadfast
in love for Baha', a firmness and steadfastness resembling
that of immovable mountains and lofty hills.
     O maid-servant of God!  Deliver my greetings,
praise and longings to the beloved of God and His
maid-servants in that remote region, and say unto them:
     "Hasten, hasten to the fountain of the mercy of God!
Hasten, hasten to enter into the Kingdom of God!
Hasten, hasten to the effulgence which is shining like
unto the sun from the Supreme Horizons throughout
ages and cycles!
     "O beloved of God and His maid-servants!  Verily
the Beauty of El-Abha hath endured every hardship,
calamity and great affliction in love for you, so that ye
may be directed by the lights of the Kingdom unto the
King of the Realm of Might, and be shining as a brilliant
light in the glass of the contingent world.  Hasten
to avail yourselves of the opportunity to enter [the protection
of] the inaccessible Cause and lofty Shelter!


+P 412
     "Truly I say unto you, this is a gift which neither the
dominion of the world, nor the riches of treasuries, nor
the glory of the distinguished men of the world, can
equal in this glorious century and new age; inasmuch as
crowns are transient, while this is eternal and never
ending."
     O my Lord!  O my Lord!  Strengthen them in
whatsoever Thou willest, with that Thou willest, upon
what Thou willest!

O maid-servant of God!
     Verily thy letter indicated thy faith in the Oneness
of God.  I ask God to make thee firm in His Religion,
to confirm thee through the breath of the Holy Spirit,
so that thou mayest speak the teachings of God and
guide the people unto the Kingdom.
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily the bounty of God
upon thee is great, great!  If thou remainest firm in
the path of the love of thy Lord, thou shalt behold the
doors of success and progress open before thy face from
all sides.  Verily this is not far from the mercy of thy
Lord!

O maid-servant of God!
     I ask God to open before thy face the doors of wisdom,
to give thee a drink of the chalice overflowing
with the wine of certainty, and to inspire thee with the
mysteries of the Holy Book, so that thou mayest know
the significances of vision and the reality of revelation,
and all the hidden symbols of prophetic Scripture, such
as those of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel.


+P 413
O thou who art advancing unto God!
     Thank God for that He taught thee the word of
guidance, illuminated thy heart by the light of the
Kingdom in this world, destined to thee eternal life,
everlasting salvation, progress and prosperity in the
world of spirit.
     Hold to the garment of glory, grasp the firm rope
and loosen thy tongue in praise of the Beloved El-Abha.
Neglect not praying and communing in the
gloomy midnights and morn and eve, and offer glory
unto thy Lord, the Supreme.

O thou who art set aglow with the Fire of the Love of
       God!
     Verily, I am in receipt of thy letter, and my breast
is dilated by its contents which proved thy great attraction
(to God), thy joy of heart and the rejoicing
of thy spirit by the Kingdom of God.
     Trust in God in all matters and lead the people unto
the solid faith, the way of the Kingdom; so that they
may be ushered into the canopy of peace and abide in
the strong castle of the mercy of thy Lord, the Clement;
that they may hoist the standards of the love of
God in the highest mountain summits, promulgate the
revelation of strength on the Ark of Safety and immerse
[thyself] in the seas of the mercy of thy Lord, the
Clement.
     Convey my greetings and praise to thy respected
wife and to thy mother, who believed in her God; cheer
her heart and comfort her spirit through the Kingdom
of God.


+P 414
O thou who art turning thy heart unto the Kingdom of
       God!
     Verily, I read thy recent letter and praised God for
having blessed thee with two babes, as a mercy on His
part.  He is indeed the Merciful, the Generous!
     Give to them the names Leah and Rachel, which are
the names of the two wives of Jacob, for they were two
sisters, beloved of God.  Perchance God hath destined
profound wisdom in this.
     Then thank God that He hath guided thy honorable
wife to the Manifestation of Light, the Revealer of
Signs and the Source of Mysteries.  Verily, this is the
great favor.
     Then know verily, that the doors of tests will be
opened in that town, but it is incumbent on thee to be
steadfast in the love of God and firm in His great
Cause.  He who remaineth firm, grows; and he who is
steadfast will be confirmed by God with great power in
this glorious century.

O thou who art baptized by the Spirit of the Love of
       God!
     Be rejoiced with this great bounty and gladdened by
this mighty gift!
     Verily, thou art from the West and we are from the
East, the distance between is great.  Nevertheless, it is
as if we were from one native land, one city, one house
and one household.  The love of God gathered us all
under the shade of one tent, beneath one banner.
     This is from the power of the command of God and
His dominion, which encompasseth all contingent beings
and affects the hearts of all existing things.


+P 415
O maid-servant of God!
     Verily, the Lord of Hosts calleth thee from the absence
of existence (or non-existence) and sayeth:
     "Come, O My maid-servant, to My Kingdom!
      Come, O My attracted one, unto My Great Paradise!
      Come, O My maid-servant, unto My Sublime
        Heaven!
      Come, O My attracted one, unto the place of My
        Glorious Throne."
     Therefore turn, with a heart throbbing and tears
flowing, unto the Beauty of El-Abha, so that thou obtaineth
the great favor and drinketh from that wine,
and tasteth the fruits of the Paradise of El-Abha.

O thou faithful and confident!
     Thanks be to God that thou hast obtained that which
was sought by all prophets and holy souls; namely, the
knowledge of God and the love of god.  First, the
knowledge; and, second, His unfathomable love.  Also
the different members of thy family, who followed thee
and who obtained that which thou didst obtain.
     This is a great gift from God and hath no equal;
although in this physical world its greatness is not perceivable,
nor its nature clearly known, yet in the spiritual
world it shineth like the sun.
     So long as the pearl remaineth hidden at the bottom
of the sea, its value is not known nor its brilliancy and
fineness seen, it is only when in the hands of the expert
jeweler that its great beauty becomes revealed.
     Thou shouldst be at the utmost height of joy and satisfaction,


+P 416
for thou art surrounded by the bounties of
the Merciful and hast become the object of the appearance
of divine guidance.
     In order to give thanks for this great and glorious
gift, thou shouldst do all thou canst to guide His creatures,
to give sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf,
life to the dead, and endeavor to turn those who are
still attached to material things in the way which leads
to spiritual heights; to help them to travel in the way
of the Kingdom and to walk in the path that leads to
the King of Kings.
     Servant and believer in God!  Present the greetings
of Abdul-Baha to the faithful maid-servant of God
[thy wife] and to thy two revered daughters.

O thou my dear friend, my associate and companion!
     The times of (our) meeting+F1 are still remembered
and the sweetness of thy company is lastingly established
in the recess of (my) life.
     I pray and implore the threshold of the Lord of the
Kingdom always, and seek for thee His strength and
confirmation, saying:
     "O Lord of Hosts!  Confirm Thine affectionate
........ in Thy servitude, aid him in the service of
Thy Word, open to his face the door of knowledge, reveal
to his heart the realities and significances, and
grant him the ecstasy of the cup of reality, gladden him
through the melody of Thy love, make his night, day,
and day, happy!"
     In sooth, O dear one! thy services are evident, thy
endurance of ordeals and difficulties well known.

+P 417
     In the organization of the Mashrak-el-Azcar, thou
art indeed well striving.  I hope thou wilt attain a great
reward, open an eloquent tongue, raise a wonderful
melody in every meeting, draw and paint the images
and forms of the Kingdom in the material world.
     Rest assured in the grace of the Lord and be dilated
by His infinite favors.
     Convey greetings of reverence to the maid-servant of
God [thy wife], likewise thy revered daughter.  I am
ever thoughtful of them and will never forget them.

O thou spiritual friend!
     Thy services are accepted in the Kingdom of Abha,
mentioned in this merciful Assemblage and the cause of
joy and gladness to Abdul-Baha.
     Thank God, thou art a believer and an assured one,
firm and steadfast; a truthful servant of the divine
Kingdom and an agreeable lover of His Holiness
Baha'o'llah.  Thou hast spent thy time in spreading
the fragrances of God and thy possession in the promotion
of the Word of God.
     Rest assured in the great bounty and bestowal, be
attracted by the fragrances of the Kingdom of Abha.
Fatigue not thyself on account of any difficulty and
give not up because of any ordeal.  Be not grieved because
of any trial nor hindered by any hindrance.
     Night and day confine thy time to the education of
the world of humanity.  Arise to guide the creatures
and spend time in promulgating the teachings of His
Holiness Baha'o'llah, so that lives may find glad-tidings,
hearts gladness, the souls eternal life and the
minds extraordinary advancement.


+P 418
     In respect to the Mashrak-el-Azcar:  Brevity must
now be observed; that is, as much as possible endeavor
should be made so that by the assistance of all the
friends and the sincerity of your intentions it may become
instituted and built in Chicago even though it
be not possible to build a most solid, lofty and great
(edifice).  Whatever is now possible should be erected.
     And the question of giving the glad-tidings (i. e.,
teachings of this religion) should be given moment.
The holy souls who are free from the ties of this mortal
world and attain the confirmation of the Holy Spirit,
although they live on earth, yet, verily, they are heavenly,
illuminated, spiritual, divine.  Such souls must
appear and engage, with simplicity, freedom and purity,
in training the public and in guiding all people.  If
such souls arise, the Holy Spirit will aid them, the hosts
of the heavenly angels will render them victorious, the
bounties of the Kingdom of Abha will surround them,
the ray of the Sun of Truth will shine, the breezes of
the Paradise of Abha will give spirit, the ocean of
favors will boil and the good scent of the fragrances
of holiness will perfume the nostrils of the inhabitants
of the world.
     By the bounty and grace of the Educator, I hope
thou mayest attain to this providence and bounty!
     Convey greeting of reverence of utmost kindness to
all thy relations, [thy wife] and thy respected daughter,
and others, and to all the beloved and the maid-servants
of the Merciful.

O thou my spiritual companion!
     Two letter have reached me from you, and the contents


+P 419
of both I have considered.  Communication of
the beloved of God from all parts of the world with
America, and the correspondence of America with all
parts is most agreeable and the cause of attracting the
hearts.  Endeavor greatly to accomplish this important
matter and write to all parts.
     The beloved of God must, like the roses of the rose-garden,
send fragrant messages from one to another,
receive strength from one another, and co-operate together,
by the strength of the Kingdom.  There is no
greater means than communion and communication.
"Communication is half a meeting."
     Send a copy of this letter to all parts and write to
them.  Thus may the beloved of God, in every city,
send collectively letters to other cities, especially America.
This shall be the means of growth and the cause
of attraction.  he souls will be made happy, the spirits
revived, the hearts dilated and the breasts expanded.
Convey greetings and longing to all the beloved of God.

Honorable Dr. .........
     According to what is heard you have received the
permission of medication and the certificate of graduation
(diploma) from the College of Medicine.  Now
experience is necessary in order to attain skill and proficiency.
The greatest of all these is the confirmation and
the strength of His Majesty, the One (God), through
the favor of the Blessed Perfection.  I am hopeful that
will also be thine.
     For the physician the first qualifications are:  Good
intentions, trustworthiness, tenderness, sympathy for


+P 420
the sick, truthfulness, integrity, and the fear of the
Lord.
     With life and heart strive thou to be both a spiritual
and physical physician.  Thus mayest thou be Ameen
and Fareed (Trustworthy and Unique).
     Thy honorable father night and day prays, hopes
and supplicates that thy life, like his, may be entirely
devoted to the service of the Threshold of God, that
thou remain the servant of the Holy Cause.

O Spiritual ........!
     Thy letter is received; likewise that of Mr. ........
Print soon the booklet (Mirza Badi Ullah's Epistle to
the Bahai world) and spread it broadcast.
     The dear maid-servant of God, ........, is indeed
an assured believer; likewise ........, his honor Mr.
........, and his honor Mr. .........  In reality
they are revered souls.  I hope that they will soon arise
for the Mashrak-el-Azcar and thus attain His favor.
     All the beloved of God must strive so that this
eternal edifice arise. ***

O thou bearer of the Great-tidings of the Kingdom of
       God!
     Thy letter *** was received.  It contained the good
news of the assemblage of the beloved ones, of the Meeting
of Faithfulness which was held, the joy and fragrance
obtained, the appearance of the lights of the love
of the Beauty of Abha, and the good news that the
breasts of the beloved ones were dilated (with joy).
This news caused such joy that our afflictions, sufferings
and calamities were wholly forgotten, a new carpet was


+P 421
spread and a great joy attained with the utmost exaltation!
For Abdul-Baha serves with all devotion in order
that union and affection may be created among the beloved
of God; nay, in the whole of the human world.
     My utmost hope and wish is to find that an assemblage
hath been arranged which hath become the
cause of love and affection in the world of humanity
which announceth the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of
Abha, diffuseth the fragrances of the love of God,
setteth the pillars of the world in motion through the
power of divine guidance, and is quickening the dead
through the spirit of divine knowledge!
     O dear friend!  The darkness of error hath encompassed
the world; it is now the time to spread the light
of guidance.  The world hath wholly become the tomb
of the dead; it is now time that it shall be transformed
into palaces of the living.  The East and the West have
become a thorny desert of oppression; it is time they
should become a rose-garden of faithfulness.
     You have written concerning the Feast+F1 of Remembrance
which you arranged after the Persian manner, at
which Mr. ........ and Mr. ........ engaged in
serving the beloved ones like unto Abdul-Baha:  This
arrangement of festivities and affection, chanting of
Tablets, explaining realities and significances, and this
inculcating of the teachings and exhortations of Abdul-Baha
causeth everlasting life and maketh the hearers
as heavenly angels.
     Whenever such an entertainment is arranged through
spiritual sentiments, shining faces and merciful hearts,


------------------------
1.       of Remembrance or Meeting of Faithfulness, held every nineteen days.
+P 422
it is a "Lord's Supper."  For the brilliancy of the
Kingdom of Abha will shine and the spirituality of
Abdul-Baha become manifest.  This is that "divine
table" (or food) of which mention is made in the
prophecies:  "On that day they shall gather together
at the divine table"; and "people shall come from the
East and West and arrive in His Kingdom."
     Convey loving greetings to his honor ........ and
say:  "O dear one!  The heart of Abdul-Baha greatly
rejoiceth at thy reading of the Tablets and Words at
the meetings of the merciful ones!  I beg of God, that
in all assemblages thou mayest cause happiness unto
the hearts of the friends and bestow joy and fragrance!"
     Announce to his honor ......... my love and longing
(for him) and say:  "That Power which strengthened
the apostles is now in full confirmation.  I hope
thou wilt receive an abundant portion from that confirmation."
     Announce the utmost love from Abdul-Baha to his
honor ........ and say:  "O thou friend of my heart!
The heavenly food is needed successively; be thou a
server of the food and direct thou the people of the
world to present themselves at that able and guide
them to partake thereof."
     Convey greetings and respect from Abdul-Baha to
the esteemed maid-servant of God, ........, and say:
"Thou art always in our midst and art not forgotten,
even for a moment.  I beg the Beauty of Abha for
confirmation in thy behalf.  It is some time since, by the
dust of calamities and occupation of mind, the correspondence
hath been delayed; but there is no harm in


+P 423
that.  For my heart is engaged in prayer and I beg
for confirmation in thy behalf."
     Convey on my behalf, greetings and respect to the
invoking maid-servant of God, ........, and say:
"Thank thou God for thou hast arrived at the
Holy City and at the Heavenly Jerusalem and hast
found thy way to the Divine City and entered the Kingdom
of Abha!"
     O thou real friend!  O Mr. ........!  Seek not
a single minute of rest and do not keep still.  Travel
more and more in cities and villages.  Bear the glad-tidings
and guide them.  Strengthen the beloved (i. e.,
believers) and open the eye of perception of the
strangers (those who do not believe).
     As to chanting supplications in the Oriental tune, this
is very agreeable.  His honor ........ must exert his
endeavors in this matter.
     In reality the friends of God are always present in
my society and are associated with the friends of God
in the Sacred Spot; even though they be in the remotest
lands of the earth.
     O thou real friend!  Such entertainments are always
necessary, for they cause the increase of love, unity
and harmony in the friends of God.  Bring about (such
entertainments) by all means.

O thou esteemed maid-servant of the Word of God!
     Praise be to God! upon thy departure from Acca,
thou hast been assisted and rendered successful in serving
the Kingdom of God.  Accordingly, thou must offer
the utmost thanks to the Threshold of Oneness, for this,
thy journey, was fruitful and this peregrination became


+P 424
the cause of discovering the mysteries of the Lord of
Glory.
     Arise thou, in unison with his honor [thy husband],
to serve with the utmost devotion and consecrate your
time, night and day, to promote the Word of God, to
diffuse the fragrances of God and to guide all the people
of the earth.  In the world of existence nothing hath
any result, even if it be dominion over the East and
West.  But that which hath an immortal result is servitude
in the Holy Threshold, service rendered to the
Kingdom of God and guiding all in the earth.  I hope,
through the divine grace and bounty, thou wilt be
assisted and strengthened therein.

O thou who art kindled as a lamp with the Fire of the
       Love of God!
     Be thou a fountain flowing with the waters of the
mercy of God, a myrtle perfumed with the fragrances
of God and a bird warbling the most wonderful melodies
of the knowledge of God in the garden of faith.
     Know thou, verily, the Sun of Truth hath shone
forth with the lights of peace upon all regions.  Strife
and conflict will surely be removed from all the nations
of the earth.  Carnage shall be taken away; fighting,
violence and reviling will be changed into universal
reconciliation and the hosts of tranquillity will pitch
their tents in the midst of the world.  Then the awning
of the mercy of thy Lord will be hoisted and those souls
who are free from the filth of prejudice, contradictions
and presumption and are filled with a love that imparts
affinity, intimacy, affection, meekness and humbleness
will be sheltered under it.


+P 425

O thou who art cheerful in heart, by the Fragrances
       of the Merciful!
     Verily, I read the verses of thy thanksgiving unto
God, for depositing in thy heart an eternal joy reviving
thee by the breath of the Holy spirit to everlasting
life, [for having] cast upon thee the light of guidance
and awakened thee by the breezes of His great mercy.
Therefore, thank God for this.  Verily, His bounty to
thee is great, great!
     Beware not to be sorrowful on account of my confinement;
inasmuch as it is the comfort of my heart,
the healing of my breast, the dispeller of my sorrow
and sadness, the cause of my salvation in servitude to
the Bounty of El-Abha.
     If thou desirest to pray for me a beneficial prayer,
do not ask for the removal of my imprisonment, but
implore God to increase my calamities in the Path of
El-Abha, to make me a sacrifice in His love and give
me to drink the cup of martyrdom by His bounty and
grace.
     I ask God to confirm thee by the breath of His Holy
Spirit, the hosts of His angels and armies of His
strength, so that thou arisest to serve the vineyard of
God and to enlighten the insight of thy revered husband
by the light of the knowledge of the Greatest Name.
This is not far from the bounty of thy Lord.
     The maid-servant of Baha', the Exalted Leaf+F1 , conveys
to thee greetings and praise--likewise the rest of
the brilliant leaves+F2 .
     Regarding the star which appeareth while thou art
turned unto God:  This is the spiritual disclosure and

2.           women.
+P 426
the divine impression.  Also the fire circle which appeareth
to thine eyes, is a spiritual transfiguration and
[signifieth] the Eternal Grace manifesting itself in the
human garment; because "cloud" signifies the human
form (or body), while the "circle of fire," the divine
form, which is manifested in the reality of man.

O thou who art attracted by the Love of God!
     In the Persian tongue has thou written a letter; I
was happy to read it.
     Praise be to God!  This is the dawn of the light of
unity between the Eastern and Western people.  In
Persia the English language is being studied widely and
in America the Persian tongue is beloved by some dear
souls.  In both countries the respective languages are
being studied.  This is in itself a proof that the East
and the West (literally, place of sunrise and sunset)
shall clasp hands as two families.  The standard of
unity shall be raised, and the means of love and friendship
will be accomplished.
     Endeavor to complete the study of the Persian--thus
mayest thou read the Tablets of the Blessed Beauty+F1
and mayest translate them, and without the interpreter's
aid thou mayest read all my letter to thee.

O thou dear maid-servant of God!
     Thank thou the kind Father for that the world of
creation was adorned with the light of His Manifestation

mercy, for His infinite mercy whereby He illumined
thine heart with the light of guidance and thy sight

with witnessing His radiance to the extent that thou
didst hearken to he call of the Supreme Concourse
and didst turn to the horizon of sanctity.  Praise be
to Him and to Him be thanks for this greatest favor
and evident attainment!
     As to thy vision, it is reality itself (it is what hath
occurred).  Whatever thou hast seen in the realm of
vision is interpreted in the contraries and opposites, for
laughter in the world of vision is weeping, and weeping,
joy and happiness; death is longevity, and dangers,
in certain cases, safety itself.  Harm (in this wise) is
helpfulness, and friendship, enmity and hatred.  Therefore,
thou shalt not kill the lamb; nay, rather thou
shalt be the cause of the spread of His Name; thou
shalt share a portion of His eternal life and attain a
share of His infinite mercy.  The impressions of the
heart (the painful feelings of the heart), which were
like the blows of a weapon, are interpreted to mean
joy and happiness.  I hope that thou mayest attain to
all these.
     The purport of the study of the Persian tongue is
this:  That thou mayest memorize a commune in the
Persian and at the time of communion and supplication,
when present in the meeting of the maid-servants of
the Merciful, thou mayest chant it.
     The translation of Tablets is acceptable and beloved.
If, occasionally, thou writest a concise, terse and useful
article, with the utmost sweetness, containing the teachings
and exhortations of the Blessed Perfection,
verbatim, for the purpose of publishing in the journals
of Denmark, it will be most agreeable.  I ask God for
strength and confirmation for thee.


+P 428
    +F1 I ask God that thou mayest find a perceiving eye, an
attentive ear and an eloquent tongue; that thou mayest
loosen thy tongue in delivering the Cause of God,
promoting the Word of God in that country, educating
the children and training them in the training of God,
and in early childhood enkindling in their hearts the
lights of spiritual morals.
     Thou hast written that in thine articles for the papers
thou hast cited from the holy Tablets of Tarazat and
Tajalliat.  It is very agreeable.
     Respecting the translating of Miss Barney's book, in
which thou hast engaged thyself, it is very agreeable;
but thou must communicate concerning this with Miss
Barney herself.  She will assist thee in its publication
and spreading.
     I ask God to aid thee by the divine confirmation and
engage, night and day, with the commemoration of
God.
     Upon thee be Baha El-Abha!

***O ye real friends of Abdul-Baha!
     From the gathering of those illuminated faces and
flowers of the rose-garden (of God) in Camp Mineola+F2
utmost joy and fragrance (to me) was the result.
     I hope that assembly, like sparkling stars, may shed
the lights of love and unison upon the human world,
and become the cause of the happiness and joy of the
inhabitants of the earth; that they may become like
unto clear mirrors reflecting (the rays) of the Sun of
Truth, and give the glad-tidings of the manifestation
of the Lord of the Kingdom.

1.           Tablet as received bore no opening line of address.
2.       a number of the believers spent the summer months.
+P 429
     I ask the blessings of God that year after year He
may add souls to that assembly, and in future it may
become doubled an hundred-fold.
     How blessed it is that this assembly may become
firmly established, and it is sure that the heavenly
confirmations will pour down!

O ye+F1 beloved friends of Abdul-Baha!
     The detailed letter which you have written was received
and it was read with the greatest attention.
From the rose-garden of its significances a perfumed
fragrance reached the nostrils and from its suggestions
and statements traces of sincerity of intention became
manifest.
     Praise be to God!--that each one of that assembly
is like unto a shining lamp, is ignited by the fire of the
love of God, hath closed his eyes to the world and
the inhabitants thereof, hath burned away the veils of
superstitions and hath acquired the treasury of Truth.
I have loosened my tongue to thank God for this gift
at the Threshold of Oneness and praised and glorified
the Incomparable God for His bounty, because He
assisted those souls in the service of the Kingdom, and
established such an assembly in New York that it will
finally become a cause of the guidance of that continent.
     You have written that there is a difference among the
believers concerning the "Second Coming of Christ."
Praise be to God!--time and again this question hath
arisen and its answer hath emanated in a clear and
irrefutable text from the pen of Abdul-Baha that what
is meant in the prophecies by the "Lord of Hosts,"


------------------------
1.    the New York City Board of Counsel.
+P 430
the "Promised Christ" is the Blessed Perfection
(Baha'o'llah) and His Highness the Supreme
(the Bab).  The faith of everyone must resolve
around this palpable and evident text.
     My name is Abdul-Baha, my identity is Abdul-Baha,
my qualification is Abdul-Baha, my reality is Abdul-Baha,
my praise is Abdul-Baha.  Thraldom to the
Blessed Perfection is my glorious and refulgent diadem;
and servitude to all the human race is my perpetual
religion.  Through the bounty and favor of the Blessed
Perfection, Abdul-Baha is the Ensign of the Most-Great-Peace,
which is waving from the Supreme Apex;
and through the gift of the Greatest name, he is the
Lamp of Universal Salvation, which is shining with the
light of the love of God.  The Herald of the Kingdom
is he, so that he may awaken the people of the
East and of the West.  The Voice of Friendship, Uprightness,
Truth and Reconciliation is he, so as to
cause acceleration throughout all regions.  No name,
no title, no mention, no commendation hath he nor will
ever have except Abdul-Baha.  This is my longing.
This is my supreme apex.  This is my greatest yearning.
This is my eternal life.  This is my everlasting
glory!  Express ye the same thing which is issued from
my pen.  This is the duty of all.  Consequently the
friends of God must assist and help Abdul-Baha in the
adoration of the True One; in the servitude to the
human race; in the well-being of the human world and
in divine love and kindness.
     O ye friends of God!  Through the Appearance of
the Blessed Perfection the theories are abrogated and
the facts are established.  The time of superficiality is


+P 431
gone by and the cycle of reality hath appeared.  One
must become the incarnation of Servitude, the personification
of Love, the embodiment of Spirituality and the
mirror of Mercy.
     The believers must become the cause of life; deliver
the people from heedlessness, call the souls to the perfection
of humanity, beckon nations to unity and agreement,
destroy the foundations of foreignness, make
everyone as friends and associates, treat the negligent
souls as their own children, and train and educate them
with the utmost love--so that the ignorant become wise,
the blind become endowed with sight, and the deaf be
given hearing.
     O ye friends of God!  Beware!  Beware of differences!
By differences the Temple of God is razed to
its very foundation, and by the blowing of the winds
of disagreement the Blessed Tree is prevented from
producing any fruit.  By the intense cold of the diversity
of opinions the rose-garden of Unity is withered, and
the fire of the love of God is extinguished!
     O ye friends of God!  Abdul-Baha is the Manifestation
of Thraldom and not "Christ."  The servant of
the human realm is he, and not a "chief."  Nonexistent
is he and not "Existent."  Pure nothingness is
he and not "Eternal+F1 ."
     There is no outcome or result to these discussions.
We must put aside these disputes and controversies,
nay, rather must we consign them to utter oblivion and


------------------------
1.    the Tablet in which I have state `I am not Christ and am not Eternal,'
2.   the meaning is this, that I am not Christ--and not the Eternal Lord!
     But I am Abdul-Baha.  This is its real purport.  Undoubtedly those
     souls who are under the shadow of the Blessed Cause, believing and
     assured, firm and steadfast, and living in accord with the divine
     exhortations and advices, all of them are confirmed in the everlasting
     life."--Abdul-Baha.
+P 432
arise to do that which is indispensable and which is
demanded of us in this Day.  Controversies are words
and not significances, theories and not realities.
     The quintessence of Truth is this:  We must all
become united and harmonized in order to illumine
this gloomy world, to abolish the foundations of hostility
and animosity from among mankind, to perfume
the inhabitants of the universe with the holy fragrances
of the nature and disposition of the Beauty of
Abha, to enlighten the people of the East and West
with the light of guidance, to hoist the tent of the
love of God and suffer each and all to enter under its
protection, to bestow comfort and tranquillity to every
one under the shade of the Divine Tree, to astonish the
enemy by the manifestation of the utmost love, to make
the ravenous and bloodthirsty wolves to be gazelles of
the meadow of the love of God; to administer the
taste of non-resistance to the tyrant, to teach long-suffering
and resignation of the martyrs to the murderer,
to spread the traces of Oneness, to chant the
praises and glorification of the Glorious Lord, to raise
the voice of "Ya Baha El-Abha!" to the Supreme Apex
and to reach the ears of the inhabitants of the Kingdom
with the outcry--"Verily the earth is illumined by the
lights of its Lord!"  This is reality!  This is guidance!
This is service!  This is the consummation of
the perfection of the realm of humanity!
     O ye believers of God!  Each person must summon
the people to the Servitude of Abdul-Baha and not the
Christhood; and no soul must either publicly or privately
utter one word against or in contradiction to the
general Teachings, and no one must believe that Abdul-Baha


+P 433
is the "Second Coming of Christ", nay, rather he
must believe that he is the Manifestation of Servitude,
the Main-spring of the Unity of the human world, the
Herald of the True One with spiritual power throughout
all regions, the Commentator of the Book according
to the divine text, and the Ransom to each one of
the believers of God in the transitory world.
     Print ye this Tablet and spread it throughout all
countries.

O ye+F1 who are turned towards the Kingdom and drawn
       unto the Holy Fragrances diffused from the Garden
       of El-Abha!
     Arise with every power to assist the Covenant of God
and serve in His vineyard.  Be confident that a confirmation
will be granted unto you and a success on
His part given unto you.  Verily He shall support you
by the angels of His Holiness and reinforce you with
the breaths of the Spirit that ye may mount the Ark
of Safety, set forth the evident signs, impart the spirit
of life, declare the essence of His commands and
precepts, guide the sheep who are straying from the
fold in all directions, use every effort in your power to
give the blessings ye have and strive earnestly and
wisely in this new century.  By God, verily the Lord of
Hosts is your support, the angels of heaven your assistance,
the Holy Spirit your companion and the Center
of the Covenant your helper!  Be not idle, but active
and fear not.  Look unto those who have been in the
former ages--how they have resisted all nations and
suffered persecutions and afflictions, and how their stars

shone and their attacks proved successful, their teachings
established, their regions expanded, their hearts gladdened,
their ideas cleared and their motives effective.
Ye are now in a great station and noble rank and ye shall
find yourselves in evident success and prosperity, the
like of which the eye of existence hath never seen in
former ages.
     El-Baha and salutations be upon every one who is
firm in the Covenant, free from dissension, sanctified
from deceits and steadfast in the Path!

O ye+F1 elect and chosen ones of the Kingdom!
     Thank God that the Greatest Name selected and
elected that gathering, ushered it into the Kingdom of
Eternal Glory, honored and crowned it amid the
Supreme Concourse.
     He placed upon each head a glorious diadem of
guidance and established each one upon the throne of
eternal reign.  This is not known now but shall become
evident and clear hereafter.
     The seed when growing, at first doth not attract attention,
but later it becometh green and thriveth, adorning
the rose-garden and the orchard.  Now, likewise,
this divine bounty is unknown, it is not yet revealed,
but soon will its splendor illumine the horizons and
brighten the East and the West.
     Send Mr. ........ to India for the purpose of
teaching.  He must have a companion.  If this be not
possible from among the men, send one of the maid-servants
of the Merciful.
     As to the ordeals of Abdul-Baha, his trials and

+P 435
calamities, grieve not on that account, but rather be in
perfect happiness and joy, for--praise be to God!--he
was worthy and deserved these trials in the Path of
Baha'.
     Through the news of the progress of the Cause of
God, and the unity and agreement of the beloved of
God, great joy was realized, and to such an extent that
I forgot all sorrow and all ills. ***

O ye+F1 sons of the Kingdom!
     At a time when conditions were most difficult and
oppressive and the reception or letters hard and impracticable,
your letter was received.  Therefore, its
reception denoteth that the honorable assembly is confirmed.
I hope from the bounties of His Highness
the Incomparable One that under all circumstances and
conditions ye may become assisted in the service of the
Kingdom of God.
     Ye have written regarding the erection of the
Temple and the purchase of the ground, or the finding
of a place to be as a home for the gathering of the
believers.  At this moment that Abdul-Baha is immersed
in the ocean of calamities, this news caused him
joy and happiness, that--praise be to God!--the friends
and the maid-servants of the Merciful are thinking to
serve the Kingdom of God.
     O ye sanctified souls!  It is the time of firmness and
steadfastness and the period of arising in the service
of the Word of God, for the Blessed City+F2 is environed
from all directions with the tempestuous waves of tests
and trials and the sweeping hurricanes of persecutions


------------------------
1.    the New York City assembly.
2.
+P 436
and hardships are blowing and roaring high.  The joy
and happiness of the heart of Abdul-Baha depends
upon the stability and constancy of the believers.  For
they must live and act in accord with the divine advices
and exhortations and show forth to each other the power
of the perfection of love with infinite accord and unity,
so that they may become the embodiment of one existence,
the waves of ones sea, the myrtles of one rose-garden,
the rays of one sun, the stars of one horizon,
the fruits of one tree and the birds of one meadow.
     Likewise, they must treat with and behave toward
all the governments, nations, communities, kings and
subjects with the utmost sincerity, trustworthiness,
straightforwardness, love and kindness.  Even they
must make hopeful a bloodthirsty enemy, show sympathy
with the utmost faithfulness and honor to the
perfidious unjust, know the ill-wisher as the well-wisher
and torment not the sinner with reproaches.  Should
they become the targets of a thousand arrows of persecution,
they must challenge it with love and friendship
and treat every one with purity of purpose and kindness.
     O ye friends of God!  Show ye an endeavor that all
the nations and communities of the world, even the
enemies, put their trust, assurance and hope in you;
that if a person falls into errors for a hundred-thousand
times he may yet turn his face to you, hopeful that you
will forgive his sins; for he must not become hopeless,
neither grieved nor despondent.  This is the conduct
and the manner of the people of Baha'.  This is the
foundation of the most high pathway!  Ye should
conform your conduct and manners with the advices of
Abdul-Baha.


+P 437
     Concerning the erection of the Temple:  Now all
the believers must become united, so that the Temple
may be built soon in one place.  For should (the believers)
undertake (the erection of the Temple)
in many places, it will not become completed anywhere;
and as in Chicago they have preceded every other place
to plan the erection of the Temple, undoubtedly to cooperate
and help them is nobler and a necessity.  Then,
when it is built in one place, it will become erected in
many other places.  If, for the present, you prepare
or establish a home in New York, though by renting it,
to become a center for the gathering of the believers
of God, it is very acceptable.  God willing, in all the
states of America in the future there will be erected
Temples with infinite architectural beauty, art, with
pleasing proportion and handsome and attractive appearances;
especially in New York.  But for the present,
be ye satisfied with a rented place.
     The utmost happiness was produced by hearing the
news of unity and agreement among the believers in
New York; for the foundation of progress is union
and when this object is attained, the Cause will develop.
     Deliver on my behalf longing greeting to his honor
Mr. ........ .
     When the friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful
gather together on Sundays, in the spiritual
assemblies, exercise ye toward them, on behalf of this
imprisoned one, the utmost affection, love and kindness.
     Convey on behalf of this longing one the glad-tidings
of the attainment to confirmation to his honor Mr.
........; that ere long he shall in such wise be assisted


+P 438
by the confirmations of the Kingdom of Abha that
he, himself, will become astonished.
     O ye members of the spiritual assembly!  Become ye
firm and steadfast in the Covenant and Testament to
such a degree that your meeting become the expression
of one soul and endeavor ye with your hearts and minds
so that ye may become the cause of the illumination of
this darkened world and that through your efforts the
lights of the Kingdom dawn upon this nether sphere.
     Whatever hath and will transpire in this land is
through the conspiracy of the brothers who are not
resting, neither day nor night, and are thirsting for the
blood of Abdul-Baha.  The government is not responsible
at all.  These difficulties are brought about
through the evil slanders and machinations of the
nakazeen+F1 .

O thou+F3 whose heart is attracted and whose breast is
       dilated with joy by the Holy Fragrances!
     Give the glad-tidings to the assemblies of the beloved
who are firm in the Covenant and say:
     "Verily the Lord hath manifested Himself in this
new and wonderful age with the greatest bounty and
mercy, which have never been preceded and whereof the
eye of existence hath never seen the like; and it is His
Great Covenant and New Testament, as appointed by

matter was plainly shown and the branches (sons),
twigs (relations), kinsmen and beloved were commanded
to obey the "appointed Center of the Covenant."
But the Covenant of God and His Testament
is a bounty to the righteous and a curse to the wicked.
     "On hearing this Command some faces have rejoiced
by this Glowing Lamp, and others become gloomy and
in their hearts the fire of jealousy and rebellion hath
been kindled.  They disobeyed the Command of their
Lord the Merciful, endeavored to spread lies and arose
to divulge seditious rumors contrary to that which was
descended from God.  They imagine that they are able
to resist this Power, which penetrates into the heart of
the contingent world, or to cover the Truth through
their false tongues and complicated opinions, and to
withhold this Sea from surging, the holy fragrances
from being spread, and the breaths of the Spirit of the
Ancient from reaching the beloved!  No, by no means!
Verily, the Word of God penetrates into the core of all
things and cannot be resisted either by the hosts of the
world or by the armies of the enemies!  In the past
ages there is a warning to every intelligent one!  Ye
shall see their banners reversed, their sign abolished,
their happiness destroyed in those regions in a similar
way to the disappointment of their hopes in the East.
     "But, as the people of the West are still children
in the Cause+F1 and have not perfect knowledge of its
reality and validity, the nakazeen thought it to be an
easy prey and availed themselves of this opportunity
for laying doubts and suspicions, speaking false words,
divulging seditious calumnies among the people.  Ye

dark clouds which were gathered in those far regions,

shall shine with the Most Dazzling Light; the darkness
will vanish, the firm believers will be in great joy, and
the nakazeen shall be in evident loss."

O ye+F1 servants of God and maid-servants of the
       Merciful!
     The letter, which was in reality the congratulation
for the entrance of the day of the anniversary of His
Highness the Promised One, was received.  The names
of the friends of God were read one after another and
caused great joy.
     I hope that upon the coming of each auspicious day
the friends of God may become doubled, that is, may
become twofold; that the gentle fragrances of the love
of God may be spread so universally that large cohorts
enter under the shadow of the Word of God in a short
space of time, and arise to serve, according to the
heavenly instructions, in order that strife and warfare
may vanish wholly from the human world, and the
beauty of love, friendship and harmony may appear
with such an appearance that all the intellects may
become astonished, all the souls entranced and all the
hearts attracted.
     O ye friends!  O ye maid-servants of the Merciful!
Should ye realize in what a state this Tablet is written,
assuredly ye will soar heavenward with joy and exultations
and begin to cry out:  "Glad-tidings!  Glad-tidings!"

Therefore, to render thanks for these bounties,
open ye the tongue of praise and glorification and engage
yourselves in the divine commemoration, in order that
the confirmation may be added and the assistance may
become renewed!

O ye+F1 beloved!  O ye maid-servants of the Merciful!
     What a wonderful meeting ye have arranged and
longed for the beauty of service and have arisen to
spread the fragrances of God!  Truly I declare, ye
are confirmed by the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse
and are reinforced and empowered by the Exalted

     When the confirmation of the Holy Spirit descendeth,
ye are not a drop, but a roaring sea!  Ye are the stars
of the horizon of guidance!  If this committee become
firm, it will grow and develop; if it remain steadfast, it
will become a gift of the Almighty to the human world;
if it last, it will display marvelous signs for the well-being
of the children of man!
     The hosts of the Kingdom of Abha are drawn and
filed up in battle-array on the plain of the Supreme

upon the field of action with the intention of service;
so that they may assist that band and make it victorious
and triumphant.

     O Thou Almighty God!  Confirm Thou these friends
and the maid-servants of the Merciful!  Grant Thou
to them assistance.  Open Thou before their faces the
closed doors and make them intimate with the fragrances
of holiness, so that they may become the confident
friends of each other; raise the melody and the
song of joy and sing the harmony of heaven, in order
that they may exhilarate and gladden the regions of
the West and impart attraction and ecstasy!
     Make Thou them the magnets of love so that they
may attract the hearts to the Kingdom of Abha!

Thou art the Giver, the Seer and the Hearer!  There

O ye+F1 whom God hath chosen from among those who
       are called!--know that "many are called but few

       Light to descend; whom He guided into the right
       Path, and to whom He gave the Glad-tidings of

     Ye must be sincere and faithful, ye must follow the
ordinances which refer to the Covenant of God, who
is the solid edifice.
     O ye beloved of God, know that steadfastness and
firmness in this new and wonderful Covenant is indeed
the spirit that quickeneth the hearts which are overflowing
with the love of the Glorious Lord; verily, it is

O ye steadfast!  Abandon the heedless, set aside every

from the Supreme World, the procession of attraction
falling incessantly from the heights of heaven, the

continually and the teachings of God penetrating with
the utmost power, while the heedless are indeed in

O ye+F1 esteemed maid-servants of God, and ye revered

maid-servant of God, she who hath ascended to heaven,
i. e., Mrs. ........, hastened from this mortal world
to the divine world and soared from this temporal
realm to the expanse of the Kingdom.  She abandoned
the earthly cage and flew toward the bower of the upper

she may, in that divine rose-garden, engage in praising,
glorifying and sanctifying the True One, with the most

decease, and be not dejected on account of her ascension.

and to pure souls, flight from this world of
dust is the means of attaining the Kingdom of Spheres.
By "Spheres" is not meant this infinite space, nay, is
meant the divine world, and the invisible realm.
     To be brief:  I hope her noble son may seek the

of guidance, ye must, after her, have such unison, love,
association and unity that it may make things better
and more favorable than they were during her days.
     Praise be to God! the divine bounty favors all of
you, he doors of gifts are open before the faces of
you all, and the radiance of the Sun of Truth is shining
upon you all.  Capacity, worth (or merit) and ability,
are necessary, for the clearer and purer the mirror is,
the lights of the Sun are more manifest thereon.
     We are always gazing toward those parts in order
to find from what corner (or place) the voice will be
raised!  We hope Baltimore will become an assemblage
of light and that city may become a mirror of the love
of God!

O ye+F1 my dear friends!
     Your letter was received and its contents were wonderful
and beautiful for it evinced the spreading of the


------------------------
1.    the Baltimore assembly.
+P 445
light of Guidance.  Praise be to God! the lights of
the Morn of Eternity have cast their rays upon that
city, and in the future it will become enlightened, and
luminous stars will dawn, gleam and sparkle from its
horizon.
     Today the Sun of the Most Great Guidance hath appeared
with the greatest splendor from the horizon of
the world, and the rays of the Sun of Truth shine with
utmost light and power therefrom.  Therefore, the
world hath become another world and the bounties,
other bounties!
     A little earnestness and endeavor is encumbent upon
you, so that the pages of the soul may be cleansed and
purified from the rust of attachment to this ephemeral
world.  At that time you will consider how dazzling
and brilliant is the effulgence of the Kingdom.
     The maid-servant of God, Mrs. ........, and the
maid-servant of God, Mrs. ........--praise be to
God!--have made their homes the nest and shelter of
the heavenly birds, and have arranged meetings.  I
hope that these two meeting places will become more
illumined day by day, adding to the knowledge, faith
and assurance of the audience, and increasing their resolution
and steadfastness.
     In fact, those two gathering places are my homes,
and the nest and shelter of the birds of the field of
God.  Convey my loving greetings to each and every
believer!
     Likewise present my respectful greetings to the dear
maid-servants of God in Baltimore and Washington.


+P 446
O thou who art advancing toward the Kingdom of
       Abha!
     Be thankful that thou art inebriated with the cup of
the love of God, hast partaken of the graces of the Supreme
Concourse and art quickened with the fragrances
of holiness.
     Night and day lament and implore, with the utmost
supplication and humility, before the Threshold of the
Presence of the One God, that thou mayest be strengthened
to guide people with all steadfastness on this path
and take a plenteous share from this Most Great Sea.
     The hosts of the Kingdom will assist (thee) and the
heavenly armies will protect and defend thee.  Wherefore
seek bounties as much as thou canst.

O thou who art supplicating unto God!
     Verily I mention thee always and shall never forget
thee forever and ever.  I beseech God to make thee a
sign of guidance among the people and a lamp of dazzling
light in that extensive and large city, so that pure
and good souls may be illuminated by the light of the
knowledge of God and thus serve the Merciful Threshold
by showing earnest desire for love, peace, affinity
and harmony with the people of all religions.  Verily
the Spirit through which the temple of the contingent
world shall be quickened in this time is indeed the
founder of peace, the spirit of affinity and the light of
love.  This is that whereby this being of existence shall
evolve and develop and the world of humanity be
adorned with the raiment of glory and honor.  Therefore
it is incumbent upon thee to enkindle thyself with


+P 447
the fire of the love of God in order that thy words
may have an effect in hearts which are as of hard
stone.

O thou young, incomparable tree of the Rose-garden
       of the Love of God!
     Thank thou God that thou art planted beside this
heavenly stream, has been favored with the inexhaustible
outpouring, hast been trained and developed by
the rain of the cloud of the Kingdom of God and hast
brought forth fruit under the care of the Divine
Gardener.  Now it is the time to cast the shade and
produce delicious fruits and impart sweetness to the
palate of the spiritual ones.  Exert [thyself] with
heart and soul.  Do not rest one moment, neither do
thou seek after composure.  Give thou to others the
glad-tidings of the Kingdom and announce to them
the manifestation of the signs of the Realm of Might!
This is from the bounty of God.  He bestoweth to
whomsoever He willeth.  Verily God is the Possessor
of great gifts!

O thou who hast approached toward God!
     Verily I have received thy letter and my heart was
dilated by the content of thy expression, for it indicated
the illumination of thy heart, the spirituality
of thy soul, thy detachment from all the grades of this
nether world and thy yearning after the effulgences of
the Realm of Light.
     By the glory of my Lord, I declare:  "Verily the
splendors of divinity are continually descending upon
the pure, enlightened souls and the outpouring of the


+P 448
Kingdom fall tumultuously, like unto torrents, upon the
favored realities from the rains of the providence of
thy Lord, the Merciful, the Clement!
     "Cast behind every single thought and idea and attach
thyself to the commemoration of thy Master, the
Ancient.  Be thou soaring in the Kingdom of God,
the Mighty, the Beneficent.  Live thou in Paris until
the fragrance of the love of God may emanate from
thee in the college wherein thou art studying sciences
and unfurl thou the standard of universal peace, reconciliation,
agreement and security among all men.  Rejoice
thou by the bounty of thy Lord which hath
encompassed the whole existence and sing and warble
with the most wonderful melody in the rose-garden of
knowledge.  Verily thy Lord, the Beneficent, will confirm
thee in every moment and second and will empower
thee with such a power that the columns of warfare
and bloodshed shall shake and the foundation of peace
and harmony shall arise."

O thou who art firm in the Covenant of God!
     Mayest thou enjoy this cup which is overflowing
with the pure wine of the love of God!  Glad-tidings
unto thee for that by reason of which thou hast become
an acceptable servant before God!
     Verily I have read thy brilliant letter and praised
God for He hath made the cup of thy heart filled with
the pure wine of His love and hath chosen thee to enter
the Kingdom of His Guidance.
     Now as to what thou askest concerning giving up
the scientific attainment in Paris for the sake of confining
thy days to the delivery of this Truth, it is indeed


+P 449
acceptable and beloved, but if thou acquire both it would
be better and more perfect, because in this new century
the attainment of science, arts and belles lettres,
whether divine or worldly, material or spiritual, is a
matter which is acceptable before God and a duty which
is incumbent upon us to accomplish.  Therefore, never
deny the spiritual things to the material, rather both
are incumbent upon thee.  Nevertheless, at the time
when thou art working for such a scientific attainment,
thou must be controlled by the attraction of the love
of thy Glorious Lord and mindful of mentioning His
Splendid Name.  This being the case, thou must attain
the art thou art studying to its perfection.
     I implore God to assist thee in all cases and aspects
and perfume thy nostrils with the holy fragrance during
all times.  Be tranquil through my love unto thee
and rejoice at my compassion upon thee.
     As to the tribute thou hast sent:  We have accepted
it as a treasure because it was presented by thee with
all love and great sincerity and we shall use it in building
the Holy Tomb+F1 , that thy name may become immortal
forever and ever.

O thou who art directed toward the Light of Guidance!
     In this moment the heart of Abdul-Baha is rejoiced
at thy remembrance and he is writing an answer to
thy letter so that thou mayest be so moved by the
breezes of the love of God that thou mayest become
the envy of the cypress of the rose-garden and cause
joy, yearning, longing and ecstasy to the friends.
     In this great dispensation, art (or a profession) is


------------------------
1.     Tomb of the Bab on Mt. Carmel.
+P 450
identical with an act of worship and this is a clear text
of the Blessed Perfection.  Therefore, extreme effort
should be made in art and this will not prevent the
teaching of the people in that region.  Nay, rather,
each should assist the other in art and guidance.  For
instance, when the studying of art is with the intention
of obeying the command (of God) this study will certainly
be done easily and great progress will soon be
made therein; and when others discover this fragrance
of spirituality in the action itself, this same will cause
their awakening.  Likewise, managing art with propriety
will become the means of sociability and affinity;
and sociability and affinity themselves tend to guide
others (to the Truth).
     Satisfy thy revered father and seek his pleasure,so
that he may consider that thou observest his obedience
more than ever.  Practice the utmost love and affection.
     I supplicate and beseech the Threshold of Oneness
that thou mayest be confirmed and assisted.

O thou who art rejoiced by the Divine Glad-tidings!
     Verily I have received thy last letter and thanked God
that thou didst reach Paris protected and guarded (by
Him).  Thank thou God that He assisted thee to behold
the brilliant faces of the believers of God and
favored thee to meet them in American countries.
For, verily, beholding those shining countenances is a
divine gift; by it the hearts are dilated, the souls are
rejoiced and the spirits are attracted toward the Supreme
Concourse.
     Do not lament over the departure of my dearly beloved


+P 451
Breakwell, for verily he hath ascended to the
luminous rose-garden in the Abha Kingdom, near the
mercy of his Lord, the Almighty, and is crying out
with the loudest voice:  "O that my people knew how
my Lord hath forgiven me and made me one of those
who have attained (to the meeting of God)!"
     O Breakwell, my beloved!  Where is thy beautiful
countenance and where is thy eloquent tongue?  Where
is thy radiant brow and where is thy brilliant face?
     O Breakwell, my beloved!  Where is thy enkindlement
with the fire of the love of God and where is thy
attraction to the fragrances of God?  Where is thy
utterance for the glorification of God and where is thy
rising in the service of God?
     O my dear, O Breakwell!  Where are thy bright
eyes and where are thy smiling lips?  Where are thy
gentle cheeks and where is thy graceful stature?
     O my dear, O Breakwell!  Verily thou hast abandoned
this transitory world and soared upward to the
Kingdom, hast attained to the grace of the Invisible
Realm and sacrificed thyself to the Threshold of the
Lord of Might!
     O my adored one, O Breakwell!  Verily thou hast
left behind this physical lamp, this human glass, these
earthly elements and this worldly enjoyment!
     O my adored one, O Breakwell!  Then thou hast
ignited a light in the glass of the Supreme Concourse,
hast entered the Paradise of Abha, art protected under
the Shade of the Blessed Tree and hast attained to the
Meeting (of the True One) in the Abode of Paradise!


+P 452
     O my dearly beloved, O Breakwell!  Thou hast
been a divine bird and, forsaking thy earthly nest, thou
hast soared toward the holy rose-garden of the Divine
Kingdom and obtained a luminous station there!
     O my dearly beloved, O Breakwell!  Verily thou
art like unto he birds, chanting the verses of thy Lord,
the Forgiving, for thou wert a thankful servant; therefore
thou hast entered (into the realm beyond) with
joy and happiness!
     O my beloved, O Breakwell!  Verily thy Lord hath
chosen thee for His love, guided thee to the Court of
His Holiness, caused thee to enter into the Rizwan+F1
of His Association and granted thee to behold His
Beauty!
     O my beloved, O Breakwell!  Verily thou hast attained
to the eternal life, never-ending bounty, beatific
bliss and immeasurable providence!
     O my beloved, O Breakwell!  Thou hast become a
star in the most exalted horizon, a lamp among the
angels of heaven, a living spirit in the Supreme World
and art established upon the throne of immortality!
     O my adored one, O my Breakwell!  I supplicate
God to increase thy nearness and communication, to
make thee enjoy thy prosperity and union (wih Him),
to add to thy light and beauty and to bestow upon thee
glory and majesty.
     O my adored one, O my Breakwell!  I mention thy
name continually, I never forget thee, I pray for thee
day and night and I see thee clearly and manifestly,
O my adored one, O Breakwell!

1.         i. e., Paradise.
+P 453
   ***Concerning thy question whether all the souls
enjoy eternal life:  Know thou those souls partake of
the Eternal Life in whom the Spirit of Life is breathed
from the Presence of God and all beside them are dead
--without Life, as Christ hath explained in the texts of
the Gospel.  Any person whose insight is opened by
God seeth the souls in their stations after the disintegration
of the bodies.  Verily they are living and are
subsisting before their Lord and he seeth also the dead
souls submerged in the gulfs of mortality.  Then know
thou verily all the souls are created according to the
nature of God and all are in the state of (unconscious)
purity at the time of their births.  But afterward they
differ from one another insofar as they acquire excellencies
or defects.  Nevertheless, the creatures have
different degrees in existence insofar as the creation
goes, for capacities are different, but all of them are
good and pure (in their essence), then afterward they
are polluted and defiled.  Although there are different
states of creation, yet all of them are beneficial.
Glance thou over the temple of man, its members and
its parts.  Among them there are the eye, ear, nose,
mouth, hands and fingers.  Notwithstanding the differences
between these organs, all of them are useful
in their proper spheres.  But if one of them is out of
order, there is need of a remedy and if the medicine
does not heal, then the amputation of that member
becomes necessary.
     Verily I beseech God to make thee confirmed under
all circumstances.  Do not become despondent, neither
be thou sad.  Ere long thy Lord shall make thee a
sign of guidance among mankind.


+P 454
O thou dear and honorable!
     I received thy last letter through his honor ........
and its contents imparted to me spiritual joy, for it
indicated the high and good friendship between thee
and the respectful maid-servant of God, .........  I
supplicate God to increase at every moment and second
your faith, assurance, steadfastness and your knowledge,
and likewise to create spiritual friendship and
celestial love among the friends, in order that they
may become a unit host and enlisted soldiers (of the
Kingdom of God) with accomplishment, skillfulness,
solidarity, fellowship and unison.
     Verily, by this their breasts will become dilated,
their names exalted, their faces illumined, their host
confirmed and their progress, illumination, insight,
knowledge, spirituality, fragrance, attraction, enkindlement,
sanctity and purity promulgated.
     Convey my greeting to ........ and say to her:
"Verily the teachings which flowed from the lips of
His Highness Christ were spiritual, celestial, heavenly
and the cause of the eternal life; therefore it is explained
as heavenly food and the divine table.  But
the philosophers who were the greatest sages of the
world at that time could not realize the power of the
teachings of Christ and these very philosophers were
veiled from the Spirit of Christ and did not acknowledge
His instructions, for their imaginations did not
correspond with the apprehensions of their intellects.
O what remorse is their lot by losing this Great Cause!
Consequently, the teachings of Baha' shall assuredly
breathe the spirit of peace, the love of God and divine
compassion in the hearts of men.  These universal


+P 455
results will become clear to those who cling to them
(teachings) after experience.  As to thee, consider profoundly
these teachings in order that thou mayest apprehend
their realities."
     O my dear Mr. .........!  I beseech God to grant
thee the power of knowledge and understanding so that
thou mayest fathom the mysteries of the teachings
descended from the presence of he Glorious Lord.

O thou spiritual son!
     Verily I have received thy lettter***and its contents
were known.  I supplicate God to open to thee a way
and prepare for thee and guide thee in thy affair.
     But concerning thy marriage with the maid-servant
of God, ........, do not be in a hurry.  Deliberation
and patience are necessary until her mother giveth her
consent and thy father and mother also acquiesce.  This
is the divine commandment!  Take thou hold of it
with a true firmness.  Verily this is better for thee under
all circumstances!  Verily thy Lord is gracious to His
servants and He facilitates ere long every straight
cause.  But thou must submit to and rely upon God
under all conditions and He will bestow upon thee that
which is conducive to thy well-being.  Verily He is
merciful and compassionate!  For how many an affair
was involved in difficulty and then was straightened,
and how many a problem was solved by the permission
of God.
     Be thou not grieved, neither be thou sad.  Finish
thy studies in sciences and then turn thy face unto
God, asking from Him help and protection under all
conditions.


+P 456
O thou dear friend!
     What thou hast written was perused.  I beg of God
that thou wilt become assisted and confirmed under all
circumstances to find the ease of spirit and the happiness
of consciousness, to enter under the shadow of the Tree
of Life and to perfume thy nostrils from the fragrances
of the holy rose-garden and to illumine thy heart with
the lights of the mercy of guidance.  Through the
grace of His Highness, the Almighty, all the affairs
become easy and feasible.

O thou who art attracted to the Fire of the Love of
       God!
     I am cognizant of all thou hast written in thy letters.
To attain the pleasure of God is the more important
thing.  Thank God thou art content with the will of
God and art attached in heart to His divine wishes;
and as thou art thus, all thy desires will be granted
thee.
     Relative to your going to America, thou must observe
the wishes of thy parents and in the meantime
endeavor to diffuse the breaths of God and satisfy those
who are thirsting for the fountain of the knowledge
of God by giving them the heavenly water and merciful
rain.
     Give my greetings to ........ and say to her:  "If
thou desirest to soften the hearts and bring thy friends
under the shadow of the Tree of Life, show forth
firmness and integrity; day by day increase thy sincerity
and severance until by the power of the Truth thou
wilt soften and subdue the hearts and awaken the souls
of the heedless."


+P 457
     Also give my spiritual greetings to Mr. and Mrs.
........ and say to them:  "May your little daughter
be a blessing to you."
     O my dear ........, endure and be patient, and by
patience thou wilt attain thy desire.

O thou sincere servant of God!
     Be not sad nor sorrowful over what hath occurred.
What hath transpired is for the best and in it is a sacred
wisdom concealed which ere long will become manifest.
     Turn thou to the Kingdom of Abha and supplicate
to the Highest Concourse.  The aid and mercy of God
encompasseth all and His divine bounty is all-sufficient.
Verily something will soon occur for that kind friend
(i. e., thyself) which will bring all happiness, joy,
pleasure and contentment in the Kingdom of God.
     Regarding those whose names thou hast written, I
ask aid and assistance for them from God, especially
......... I beseech at the Threshold of the Oneness
of God to shower upon him blessings and open upon
him the door of guidance, bestowing upon his heart the
heavenly light.

O thou who art firm in the Covenant!
     Thank thou God for that thou art assisted to establish
a spiritual meeting in that city.  That assembly is
the rose-garden of the Cause of God and that meeting
is the gathering-place of the beloved of God.  If it
endureth, it is the first assembly of the world and is
the greatest assembly of mankind.  Exert thyself with
all heart and soul so that it may continue and be stable
and constant until blessed results may ensue therefrom,


+P 458
for without firmness and steadfastness no matter shall
prove effective in existence.  Some of the friends organized
meetings for teaching in the neighborhood of
that region, but owing to lack of steadfastness those
meetings scattered with great rapidity.  I hope that
thy spiritual meeting may become continual and cause
the spread of the lights.

O thou my dear friend!
     I am now viewing the flowers in the little garden
and remembering thy rose-like face.  This material
rose, although it is beautiful and fragrant, yet it cannot
be compared with the beauty of the friends.  Great is
the difference between this fragrance and that of the
friends, between the scent of this rose and the fragrance
of the love of God.  That face of thine which attracts
the hearts is far more beautiful and better than this
rose, for with that beauty is accompanied illumination.
     Thy gift is much appreciated and very acceptable.  I
was made very, very happy and I prayed for thee that
thou mayest appreciate the contents and significance
of it.
     Indeed thou hast served in Washington with no will
save the will of God in view and thou hast made me
happy and attained my pleasure.
     Hold the spiritual meeting at the stated times and
be thou its candle, giving (the friends) such happiness
and joy through the glad-tidings of God as will make
them joyful and full of ecstasy.  Give them all my
loving greetings.  Surely manifest the utmost love
and goodness o the Baltimore friends and organize for
them a spiritual gathering.


+P 459
O thou who art firm in the Covenant!
     Great joy was obtained on learning of the harmony
and love of the friends.  Communication with the
friends of various parts is one of the greatest means for
spreading the fragrances.
     The place adjoining Washington, where, during the
summer season, the maid-servant of God, Mrs.
........, shall go, if it will not cause any disturbance
and doth not become a means of talk among the enemies,
the gathering of some of the friends there will be
favorable.  We must be considerate lest it may cause
"sensation" among the people, for some people are weak
and should be treated very quietly.  However, the
gathering of some of the friends there will be a cause
of enkindling the fire of the love of God and the organization
of a Bahai meeting will be harmless.
     Every week two or three of the Washington friends
should go to Baltimore and endeavor to help and encourage
the friends there.
     As to the seven qualifications (of the divinely enlightened
soul) of which thou hast asked an explanation,
it is as follows:
     1.  KNOWLEDGE.  Man must attain the knowledge
of God.
     2.  FAITH.
     3.  STEADFASTNESS.
     4.  TRUTHFULNESS.  Truthfulness is the foundation
of all the virtues of the world of humanity.
Without truthfulness, progress and success in all of the
worlds of God are impossible for a soul.  When this
holy attribute is established in man, all the divine
qualities will also become realized.


+P 460
     5.  UPRIGHTNESS.  And this is one of the greatest
divine attainments.
     6.  FIDELITY.  This is also a beautiful trait of the
heavenly man.
     7.  EVANESCENCE OR HUMILITY.  That is to say,
man must become evanescent in God.  Must forget his
own selfish conditions that he may thus arise to the
station of sacrifice.  It should be to such a degree that
if he sleep, it should not be for pleasure, but to rest
the body in order to do better, to speak better, to explain
more beautifully, to serve the servants of God and to
prove the truths.  When he remains awake, he should
seek to be attentive, serve the Cause of God and sacrifice
his own stations for those of God.  When he attains
to this station, the confirmations of the Holy Spirit will
surely reach him, and man with this power can withstand
all who inhabit the earth.
     In regard to children, thou hast written that it is
decided to train them in the teachings of God from
childhood.  This thought is very acceptable.
     Give greeting and praise to all of the friends of God
and to His maid-servants.

O thou who art firm in the Covenant!
     Thy letter, sent through the maid-servant, ........,
hath been received.  Thou hast written concerning the
changing of names.  A name hath no importance, for
a name must needs have a bearer (i. e., deserving a high
name).  That is to say, consider (people's) morals and
character, then consider the person himself and be attentive
(to detect) one's manners and conduct and
consider his faith and assurance.  If a person is illumined


+P 461
with the light of the love of God, he is (like unto) the
morning star, even though his name be dark; and if he
is a captive in the darkness of error, he is gloomy even
though his name be that of a shining star.  Consequently,
be thou intent that thou makest thy face illumined with
the light of the love of God, through the divine assistance
and favor.  This attribute will make thee
independent of every name!
     Convey my loving greetings to all of the friends of
God.

O thou seeker of the Kingdom!
     Thy letter***was received.  Its contents became
evident.  Thou hast written concerning Baltimore--
this caused me great joy.
     The revered maid-servant of God, Miss ........,
hath undergone great roubles.  Praise be to God! that
she hath arisen (and is confirmed) to serve (the Kingdom
of God).
     I hope that Mr. and Mrs. ........ will become
the cause of spreading (the teachings) and organizing
gathering-places.
     The news of Camp Mineola brought me utmost
joy and fragrance.  I pray to God that the power of
the Word of God may become more evident and manifest
day by day in those regions.
     Convey my respectful greeting to the maid-servant of
God, Mrs. ........, and say:  "Thy service is to the
everlasting Kingdom of Glory and is conducive to eternal
life."
     Convey also my greeting to the maid-servant of God,
Mrs. ........, likewise to Miss .........  I supplicate


+P 462
in their behalf that God may bestow upon them
heavenly illumination.
     In another letter***thou hast expressed sorrow
and grief concerning the events in the Holy Land.
On the contrary, (these events) must cause joy, happiness
and exultation, for this is the day of trial and the
occasion for the manifestation of the secrets of the soul
and heart.  Have the utmost joy about the incidents
in the Holy Land and do not consider from any other
viewpoint; for the deluge of affliction is surrounding
always the Holy Land and the sincere servant of the
True One is like unto the enkindled lamp around about
which the adverse winds blow.  Therefore, you must
engage in your own occupation, be familiar in spreading
the fragrances of God and characterized in promulgating
the Word of God.  For instance, if you receive
news that the Holy Land is entirely changed, you must
not become relaxed at all; nay, rather you must become
firmer, more steadfast and more attracted and more engaged
in the service of the Kingdom.

     +F1 What thou hast written was read and its contents
became known.  In reality blessed days are coming.
This is the time for the service of the Kingdom and
the period of spreading the divine Call.  I hope that
thou and all of the friends will occupy their time in
the service of the Kingdom at this moment when Abdul-Baha
is involved in he greatest danger, so that this
heart may become gladdened and that you may become
strengthened by the Word of God, causing also the
strength of others.

winter.  At that time it will be acted upon according
to the circumstances.
     The petition concerning unity and harmony, signed
by the majority of the believers of God, was received.
We have written a detailed answer for it and it will
be forwarded.  This letter, which was signed by the
majority of the friends, brought me great, great joy.
     The book that thou hast written thou wilt send and,
after its translation, it will be read.
     Each letter that thou receivest from me, where in
the ending there is the command for its spreading, thou
oughtest to publish that letter and circulate it.
     Endeavor so far as thou art able to create unity, harmony
and loving-kindness among the believers of God.

     +F1 Thy last letter was received and its contents brought
joy.  Thank thou God, for thou art engaged in serving
the Word of God and spending thy time with the
friends of God.  If thou somewhat regard thy father
and mother, too, so that they may be somewhat pleased,
this will be the cause of pleasing me.  Father and
mother are worthy of esteem and it is necessary (to
secure their good pleasure); but this on condition that
they may not prevent one from nearness to the Threshold
of the Almighty and may not withhold one from walking
in the path of the Kingdom.  Nay, rather they
(parents) should encourage and inspire one (to walk
in God's path).

     As to living (or conduct) in accord with the Book
of Akdas:  We have spoken of this to his honor Mr.
........, for there is freedom in those lands and there
are no obstacles.
     Likewise, the Ishrakat, Tarazat, and Tajalliat+F1 must
be translated and published (and spread) among the
friends.
     But, whatever writings and articles which the believers
may write for the spread of the Cause of God,
these they must necessarily send to the Holy Land, in
order to be corrected and rectified (or approved of)
and then to be returned to them and then published.
Before their being corrected here and before securing
permission from here, their publication is by no means
allowable.
     As to the obligatory prayer (to be said three times
a day):  Each one must say his prayer alone by himself,
and this is not conditional on a private place;
that is, both at home and in the worshipping-place,
which is a gathering-place, it is allowable for one to
say his prayer; but each person must say his prayer by
himself (i. e., not in company with others who might
recite the same words and continue the same postures
together at the same time).  But if they chant supplications
(communes, etc.) together (and in company),
in a good and effective voice, that is very good.

the green gardens of the earth!  Help the friends, increase
their number, make their hearts sources of inspiration
and their souls dawnings of light.  Thus may
that city become a beautiful paradise and fragrant with
the fragrance of musk.

+F1 O God!
     Make this youth illumined and this weak one strong!
Bestow upon him knowledge and give unto him an
added strength at every dawn.  Thus may he be protected
and sheltered in Thy protection from every sin
to serve Thy Cause, to guide those who are led astray,
to lead those who are poor (or weak), to free those
who are in captivity (or bondage), to awaken those
who are in lethargy and to be happy with Thy remembrance
and thought.  Thou art the Powerful, the Wise!

O thou who art firm in the Covenant!
     The short treatise which thou has written upon
"Service in the Kingdom," forwarding it here and asking
permission for its publication, was read.  Spread it
among the believers.
     Likewise, correspondence with all the believers in all
parts is very desirable.
     The copy of the pamphlet that thou hast sent before,
God willing, in opportune time will be read and forwarded
to thee.
     O thou who art firm in the Covenant!  Endeavor thou
in the service in the Kingdom and, God willing, in a

seasonable time, permission will be given to thee to
come to the East.
     Convey longing greetings to all the friends of God.

O thou servant of Baha'!
     Thy letter***was received.  Correspondence
between the believers of the Orient and the Occident,
as well as between the different states of America, is
of the utmost importance and is conducive to the enkindlement
and attraction of the hearts.  Show thou
great consideration to this matter.
     Thou hast written concerning the translation of Tablets.
Perfect translation will be made at a time when
a committee of translators is organized.  The members
of that committee must be composed of several Persians
and several Americans, all of whom must have the
utmost proficiency in both the Persian and English languages.
Then the Tablets will be translated through
this committee.  For the present the organization of
such a committee is not possible.  Therefore, whenever
the publication of a Tablet becomes necessary, have a
proficient person translate it, then circulate it and the
end will be attained.
     Regarding the station of this servant:  My station
is Abdul-Baha, my name is Abdul-Baha, my qualification
is Abdul-Baha, my praise is Abdul-Baha, my title
is Abdul-Baha.  All the friends of God must declare
this word, in order that all of them become united and
harmonized upon it.  No difference must arise.  Collect,
translate, print and spread all the Tablets written by
me regarding this question.
     Concerning the Book of Akdas:  Undoubtedly it


+P 467
must be translated by a scientific committee of translators.
The translation of one person is not sufficient.
     Concerning the spiritual assembly of Washington:  I
supplicate God that it may finally become the cause of
the unification of all the nations of the world.
     The maid-servant of God, Miss ......., hath not
yet returned from Persia.  God willing, we will direct
her to travel to those parts.
     Thou hast written regarding the believers of Baltimore.
Undoubtedly whenever opportunity affords, the
believers of Washington must go to Baltimore, become
engaged in teaching the Truth, spread the carpet of
feasting and prepare the heavenly table.
     Convey respectful greeting on my behalf to the maid-servant
of God, Miss ........, and say:  "O thou
divinely attracted one!  Day and night, with an eloquent
tongue, teach thou the heedless ones; awaken those who
are speechless and silent.  Undoubtedly the confirmation
of the Holy Spirit will descend upon thee."
     Announce, on my behalf, respectful greeting to the
attracted maid-servant of God, Miss ........, and say:
"O thou beloved maid-servant of God!  Now is the
time, now is the moment in which, like unto Mary
Magdalene (who loosened her tongue in the city of
great Rome), thou mayest arise and become engaged
in teaching the coming of the Kingdom of God and
spread far and wide to the ears the glad-tidings of the
Realm of Eternity!"
     In brief, O thou servant of Baha'!  Strive ye that
the souls be engaged, in all parts of Europe, with the
utmost purity and sanctification, in the diffusion of the
fragrances of God.


+P 468
     Undoubtedly teachers both from among the women
as well as the men must go to Australia and New Zealand
whenever the means and opportunity are brought
about.  Now make ye an effort that perchance through
correspondence some souls, in those parts, may become
illumined with the light of the Kingdom.
     O thou servant of Baha'!  Rest thou assured.  I
supplicate from God that thou mayest be delivered
wholly from passion and desire and become the faithful
and sincere servant of the Beauty of Abha.

O thou who art firm in the Covenant!
     Thou hast written to his honor ........ concerning
the Feast.
     This Feast was established by His Highness the Bab,
to occur once in nineteen days.  Likewise, the Blessed
Perfection [Baha'o'llah] hath commanded, encourage
and reiterated it.  Therefore, it hath the utmost
importance.  Undoubtedly you must give the
greatest attention to its establishment and raise it to the
highest point of importance, so that it may become
continual and constant.  The believers of God must
assemble and associate with each other in the utmost
love, joy and fragrance.  They must conduct themselves
(in these Feasts) with the greatest dignity
and consideration, chant divine verses, peruse instructive
articles, read the Tablets of Abdul-Baha,
encourage and inspire each other with love for the
whole human race, invoke God with perfect joy and
fragrance, sing the verses, glorifications and praises of
the Self-subsistent Lord and deliver eloquent speeches.
The owner of the house must personally serve the beloved


+P 469
ones.  He must seek after the comfort of all and
with the utmost humility he must show forth kindness
to every one.  If the Feast is arranged in this manner
and in the way mentioned, that supper is the "Lord's
supper," for the result is the same result and the effect
is the same effect.
     O thou sincere servant of the Beauty of Abha!  Thou
hast written concerning Baltimore.  Convey respectful
greeting on my behalf to Miss ........ and say:
"Exert thyself as much as thou canst in order that thou
mayest illumine Baltimore, lay there an eternal foundation
and ignite a lamp whose rays may shine throughout
cycles and ages."
     Thou hast written concerning the Tablet of Baka
Ya Ali--Baka Ya Vafi (Tablet of Protection).  This
Tablet is for the healing of ailments.  Whenever one
is anxious about the recovery of an ill one, he may read
this prayer with a melodious voice while in a state of
the utmost attention and concentration.
     Thou hast written regarding Buddha and Confucius.
Buddha was an illustrious personage.  Confucius became
the cause of civilization, advancement and prosperity
for the people of China.  Now it is not the time
when we discuss concerning the stations and positions
of those who are passed away.  We must concentrate
our attention upon the present.  What hath transpired
in a former time is past.  Now is the time when we
restrict our discussion to the Most Great Luminary of
Peace and Salvation in the Age, to talk of the
Blessed Perfection [Baha'o'llah] and to voice His
exhortations, behests and teachings.  Buddha and Confucius
were kings in bygone ages who have disappeared.


+P 470
Their sovereignty in this world is ended and their cycle
is completed.  Now the Throne of the Kingdom of
Abha is established and the Blessed Perfection is sitting
upon the Throne of Grandeur.  We must raise
this Call, promulgate the Word of God and live in
accord with the teachings and advices of the Beauty
of Abha.
     Thou hast written regarding ........, the resident
of Calcutta (India), that he hath forwarded to thee
some addresses so that thou mayest correspond with
them about the Cause of God.  If thou doest write to
them there is no harm done, nay, rather it is advantageous.
     But regarding the tests:  Undoubtedly they must be
violent so that those souls who are weak may fall back,
while the souls who are firm and sincere may shine forth
from the horizon of the Most Great Guidance like unto
the sparkling stars.

O thou sincere servant of God!
     Thy letters are received regularly and by reading them
joy was produced.
     Thou hast written regarding the building of the
Mashrak-el-Azcar in Washington.  This matter was discussed
with the maid-servant of Baha', Miss .........
It hath been concluded that when she arrives in America
she will discuss this question with you.  Whatever will
be the conclusions of your discussion write to Acca.
The maid-servant of Baha' is in Paris; she will go to
America.  These services of thine are in reality worthy
of praises, that thou hast sacrificed thyself wholly to
the True One.

     Mr. ........ and Mr. ....... arrived and stayed
a few days here.  The, with the utmost joy and fragrance,

O thou who art firm in the Covenant!
     Thy letter***was received and its contents became
the cause of the happiness of the heart of this grieved
one, for it was an evidence of exertion and magnanimity
in the service of the Cause of God.
     Thou hast written regarding the publication of a
magazine.  If thou shouldst edit one magazine every
six months--two in a year--then forward it to the Holy
Land to be corrected and returned, after due correction,
for its publication--it is very acceptable and will be the
cause of the penetration of the Word of God.***
     Thy former articles were received.  I have not yet
had time to read them.  However, one of thy articles
was corrected and forwarded and thou hast it printed
and circulated.  Now write thou a new article and send
it here to be corrected.  It is better.
     Regarding the proposition which thou hast suggested
that one of the maid-servants of the Merciful reside in
the Land of Desire and be the medium for the regulation
of correspondence, now it is not according to
wisdom.
     Therefore, now edit thou a magazine in Persian and
English, then forward it here to be revised and sent
back for publication.
     Convey the wonderful Abha greeting to all the
friends of God.***


+P 472
***O thou my kind friend!
     I have the utmost love for thee and I ask God that
thou mayest become assisted in the world and in the
Kingdom and precede Paul and Peter in spreading the
Word of God and diffusing the fragrances of God and
become a manifest ensign in the regions of America.
     Perhaps thou wilt meet a person in Paris who is
thoughtless and followeth his own desire.  Forget thou
wholly his vain sayings and know thou that in future
again thou wilt become in touch with such souls, but
--praise be to God!--the fire of thy love is to such a
degree that the suggestions of such souls do not at all
affect thee.
     In brief, arise thou in the service of thy Lord with
the utmost firmness and steadfastness.  I was very much
pleased with thee.  Undoubtedly this favor will become
the cause of the greatest development for thee.
     Likewise, thou and his honor Mirza ........ are
two brothers and like unto two birds living in one nest
and singing one melody.

O thou who art firm in the Covenant and Testament!
     Thy letter***was received and its contents became
known.  Thou hast written regarding the election of a
committee+F1 .  This is very acceptable, is conducive to the
glory of the Cause of God and the spreading of the
fragrances of God in those regions.  I hope that this
committee may progress day by day until it become a
merciful assembly.
     Thou hast written regarding the correspondence with
other parts, that from now on it will be carried under
the name of The Bahai Assembly of Washington.  This


------------------------
1.     page 441.
+P 473
is also acceptable.  I hope that this committee becometh
established and its members be of the utmost unity and
affinity.  If the Bahai Assembly of Washington ariseth
in a befitting manner to love, service and magnanimity,
the lights of the love of God will be cast upon all sides
from the Assembly and it will find more importance
day by day, until it attain to the Most Supreme Station.

O thou my beloved friend!
     For a long time thou didst have the longing to visit
the Blessed Sport and the yearning to meet this imprisoned
one.  Finally this gift became realized, but it was
for one moment and as the dew to the rose-garden of
the hearts.  The destiny was such and the means were
brought about in this way.  I became sad and disappointed
more than thyself.  But I hope that this meeting became
as the wick of the lamp and the fire--that as soon
as it was touched it became ignited.  I am expecting
the results of this meeting, that I may see thee lighted as
a candle and burning thyself as a moth with the fire
of the love of God, weeping like unto the cloud by the
greatness of love and attraction, laughing like unto the
meadow and stirred into cheerfulness like unto the
young tree by the wafting of the breeze of the Paradise
of Abha!
     All the believers in the East and in this Sport are
expecting the receipt of letters from thee.

     +F1 The letter was received and its contents became evident.
Thou hast written regarding the days of summer,
that thou hast vacation for three months and a half.

1.           Tablet as received bore no opening line of address.
+P 474
Shouldst though find any companions, make thou a
trip to Persia, for during three months and a half it is
possible to reach Teheran, stay there a few days and
then return; but the time is not sufficient to come to
the Holy Land.  If the trip to Persia cannot be brought
about, then to Ishkabad+F1 .
     Regarding the question of matrimony:  Know thou
that the command of marriage is eternal.  It will never
be changed nor altered.  This is divine creation and
there is not the slightest possibility that change or
alteration affect this divine creation (marriage).
     Regarding the remains of his honor the beloved
Breakwell--him who hath attained to the meeting of
the countenance of his Lord in His great Kingdom--
must be interred in that very land, not in some other
place, for to transfer the remains of the believers from
one city to another city is against the test of the Book.
     Concerning the word Baha'o'llah:  It must be
written with O and not with U.
     Regarding the Moronites:  All the communities of
the world will finally become familiar with this great
and most holy Cause and all of them will enter under
the shade of the Word of God.
     Convey my respectful greeting to Mrs. ........ and
say:  "We hope that day by day thou mayest take higher
flights, attain to greater spiritual attraction, thy word
become more penetrative through the power of the
Spirit and through the confirmations of the Kingdom of
Abha become more illumined.  This is the path of
salvation and prosperity.  This is the attractive power
of the Holy Spirit from the Supreme Concourse."

O thou who hast confessed and believed in the Words
       of God!
     Thank God, for He hath uncovered the veil from
before thine eye, and that thou hast witnessed the great
signs of the greatest glad-tidings which have been revealed
in the Gospel, Bible and the Psalms; and wert
confirmed that verily those glad-tidings have been allusions
to the appearance of the Kingdom of God during
this time, and that the horizons shall brighten
through the light of the effulgence in this age, which is
the age of the lights and the century of thy God, the
Powerful, the Almighty!
     What a great gift is this guidance, the standards of
which are raised, the traces of which are published and
the breeze of which has blown, the garden of which is
ornamented, the basins of which have poured out, the
birds of which have sung and the joy of which is completed!
     I beg God to cause thee to be a crier unto His Kingdom
in that region, wherein the Sun of Truth hath
newly commenced to disseminate and the dawn of
guidance hath risen from its horizons.

O thou who art assuredly believing in God!
     Verily, I am informed of thy letter which showeth
how thou art praising God, hast acknowledged the unity
of God, art attracted to His kingdom and art thanking
Him for His favor; that He hath strengthened thee in
guidance, hath illumined thine inner sight with the light
which is shining forth from the Kingdom of El-Abha,
hath caused thee to hear the Call of the Merciful from
the Supreme Concourse and hath made thee one of the


+P 476
chosen ones in His brilliant and holy Threshold.  O
glad-tidings be unto thee for this great gift!  O blessed
art thou for this worthy deed!

O thou maid-servant of God!
     What thou hast written was perused.  It is evident
that thou hast all thy life been seeking the Lord of
signs, until now thou hast found the path of Truth and
discovered the Lord of Hosts and attained His Kingdom.
     If thou shouldst stand firm and steadfast, thou wilt
progress day by day in this condition, and this flame of
fire will become a luminous lamp.  If it be possible for
thee, turn thy face toward that city and be a cause of
guidance to some souls there.  It is not now advisable
for you to write secretly; the time will come for that.
When you go there yourself you will be confirmed to
teach some of the people.

O thou who art advancing toward God!
     Verily, I read thy long letter, which showed thine
abundant joy for the appearance of the Kingdom of
God and the longing of thy heart for the knowledge of
God.  endeavor with thy soul, so that the fountain of
knowledge may flow within thy heart and the bounties
of mysteries may pour upon thee from the Kingdom of
Lights.  Then thou wilt understand the meanings hidden
and recorded in symbols in the Holy Scriptures.
     O maid-servant of God!  Hold fast to the Covenant
which hath emanated from the Supreme Pen and
which is scintillating with the light of the Orb of the
Horizons.  Know thou verily, Baha'o'llah is the


+P 477
Promised One in all the Books and Tablets, and verily,
this servant, is the herald of the Kingdom of God.
     And know thou, that verily, he earthly world is as a
prison to the holy souls and these long for the Kingdom
of Sanctity, as birds long for their nests in the gardens
of beautiful and wonderful trees, flowers and fruits.
And know thou, verily, that those who were following
the steps of Christ, detached their souls from the desires
of the world, and made their hearts to depend on the
bounties of heaven.  Such as the people of the Kingdom
and they are in no need of return for apprehending
the bounty of the Kingdom.  The consciences of
such souls are clear, their inmost hearts are pure, [they]
have obtained their aim, have betaken themselves to
the vicinity of the mercy of their Mighty Lord, and
thus they are in no need of being refined, developed
and again endowed with sight.
     I beg of God to grant all thy wishes and to cause to
appear unto thee the reality of the Cause and the divine
teachings through a heavenly bounty from the heaven
of the Covenant.
     Send my greetings and peace to thy revered husband.
Every one of my household, the firm ones in the Covenant,
present unto thee greetings and praise.

O thou who hast prayed to the Kingdom of God!
     I have read thy letter and I have taken knowledge
of God as to thy conduct towards the Kingdom of God
and also thy conflagration with the fire of God's love.
Be reassured by the grace of thy Lord and direct thyself
towards Him.
     Consider attentively and with assiduity in the New


+P 478
Testament, as well as the Bible, and thou shalt find new
significances, very clear of this great Manifestation.
     I declare by the just God that thou wilt see therein
a revelation of the Holy Spirit which will aid thee in
the good understanding of the Truth and the mysteries
and significances of the Books of God, the All-powerful
and the Eternal.
     Then as to what thou hast asked me for pious people
who died before they heard the Voice of this Manifestation.
Listen:  Those who have mounted to God
before hearing the Voice, if they followed the rules of
conduct as laid down by Jesus and always walked in
the straight path,they have obtained this Dazzling
Light after their rising to the Kingdom of God.  I pray
God to lift the veil for thee and to corroborate by the
spirit of experience, so that all may be evident to thee,
by the Holy Spirit of God.
     I implore God to give thee indication of good conduct
in the way of salvation, as a guiding lamp lighted
from the fire of God's Love, and to cause thee to be
called in His Name by the multitude of the world, so
that the Name of God shall be proclaimed in all far
off countries.
     Give my compliments and my praises to thy estimable
husband; my greeting and praise to thee.

O ye two+F1 maid-servants of God!

O thou thrall of the Lord of the Kingdom!
     Thy photograph was considered with utmost insight.
This picture is an emblem of an enlightened face, that

by the light of the sun.  Therefore, it is called a sun
picture.  I pray to God that thy picture may become
reflected upon the page of existence forever and ever.

O thou attracted maid-servant of God!
     A few days ago the photograph of thyself and sister
was received and a tablet was revealed and forwarded.
Now, also, through pure mercy, the answer of thy letter
is transmitted.
     Praise be to God! that the heavenly blessings are being
poured upon thee and thou art being led by the
light of guidance.
     Supplication to God that the seed of knowledge in the

     Therefore, I beseech God that He may bestow upon
thee a meek and submissive heart and that He may
confirm thee in the service of the divine garden and
assist thee to emulate the actions and deeds of the godly
ones.  Also, that He may guide, to the Kingdom of
God, your father, mother and friends, in order that by
these heavenly blessings they may become fruitful trees
and obtain a portion of the great and glorious gift.

O ye members of the shining assembly!+F1
     The letter which was written by you, was not a letter,
but a musk sack.  For the fragrances of the rose-garden
of its significances perfumed the nostrils of every heavenly
one; evincing firmness in the love of God, steadfastness
in the Covenant and Testament and affinity
among the friends.
     This yearning one was enflamed and burning intensely,
but when I perused that letter, a gentle breeze
wafted and an extraordinary freshness and delicacy was
imparted to me.  I turned my face toward the Threshold
of the Almighty and supplicated Him imploringly
thus:
     "O thou Eternal One!  Make the friends of that
country prosperous, acquaint them with the mysteries;
usher them into the divine rose-garden and reveal to
them the hidden realities and significances; make their
hearts the association of truth and their souls full of
divine melodies and sacred (choral) music!"

by the breeze of the Paradise of Abha and make
them alive by the power of the Holy Spirit.  Verily,
Thou are the Powerful and Omnipotent, and Thou art
the Bestower and generous!"

O thou dear servant of God!
     Thy letter is received and its contents were the cause
of happiness.  Regard the bounty and forgiveness of
the Mighty Creator:  Though Abdul-Baha is in this
blessed and illuminated Spot and thou in St. Peter
(Minn.)--the other side of the world--thou hast inhaled
the divine breath notwithstanding the great distance,
and beheld the heavenly Light.  There are thousands
of people in the Holy Land associated with us and
yet they are deprived and have no hope in God.  This
is naught save a blessing from the heavenly Father
which hath enlightened that face (i. e., thy face) and
made that heart (thy heart) divine.  I ask God that
thou wilt be so animated by the breaths of the Holy
Spirit that thou wilt cause that region to become an
Eden of Paradise and illumine many souls with the
brilliant Light.
     Though we cannot see each other physically at this
time, thank God the Spiritual Breath is a messenger
between us, which is the means of assuring the heart
and rejoicing the spirit.


+P 482
O thou seeker of the Heavenly Kingdom!
     This world resembles the human body and the Kingdom
of God is like the spirit of life.  Think how
narrow and dark the material world of man is, how
afflicted with disease and maladies; but how bright and
spacious is His Spiritual World!  Through this illustration
thou mayest comprehend in what manner is the
Spiritual World portrayed in this earthly world and in
what degree is its power effected.  Though the Spirit
is concealed, its power is manifested and clear in the
phenomenal world; and so with the Kingdom of God,
though it is veiled from the eyes of the ignorant people, to
men of perception it is discernable and evident.  Therefore,
thou must become entirely heavenly that thou
mayest forget the earthly conditions and be immersed
in the perception of Divinity to such a degree that
thou wilt be unconscious of the surrounding material
existence.

O my dear friend!
     Verily, my heart is united with thee even though my
body is in a distant land, for verily neither long distance
nor immense remoteness can prevent the union
between hearts, because the clear hearts are in reality
assembled in union in the Kingdom of God, while
bodies are disperse in the east and west of the earth.
This dispersion cannot stop the affinity and cannot veil
the eye of soul from seeing in all directions.

O thou who art cheerfully moving by the Fragrances
       of God!
     Know thou verily, that when the Sun of Truth shown
forth to the horizons, the eyes of the people of affection


+P 483
were brightened by witnessing thereof, but the blind
are in veil and discord, and say:  "Where is the Sun
of the Horizon?"  Leave them in the veils of passions
and fathoms of the seas of ignorance, to sink and
play.
     Verily, thou shouldst be rejoiced with this Light,
which is shining to the Easts of the earth and the Wests
thereof, and be illumined thereby, so that thou becomest
saved with thy whole being from the gloomy
darkness.  Then thou wilt become of the great signs of
guidance.

O thou seeker of Truth!
     I received the photograph of thy shining figure and
I looked at it with thorough attention.  A tranquility
and steadfastness was manifest in thy visage.  I beg of
God that the lights of the Kingdom may so shine upon
this face (or figure) that they may dispel the darkness
of error from many.  If thou doest act according to the
commandments and exhortations of God, know thou for
a certainty that the luminosity of thy face will day by
day increase.  Be thou happy and well pleased and
arise to offer thanks to God, in order that thanksgiving
may conduce to the increase of bounty.

O thou maid-servant of God!
     Thy message, through the maid-servant of God
........ was received.  Happy is thy state that thou
art seeking the Truth and endeavoring to attain eternal
life.  This is a lofty aim, but it requireth the heavenly
confirmation and assistance.
     I pray that this assistance may be vouchsafed unto


+P 484
thee and this bounty environ thee, that thou hearest the
call of the Kingdom and beholdest the greatest signs.
     Reflect upon this:  What a bounty and what a favor
it is that the sages of the world and the wise among
mankind are incompetent of comprehension, yet the
little children of the Kingdom have attained the Truth,
dwell and abide under the shadow of the Tree of Life
and are assisted by the everlasting and eternal gift!

O maid-servant of God!
     Verily that Infant is born and exists and their will
appear from His Cause a wonder which thou wilt hear
in future.  Thou shalt see Him with the most perfect
form, most great gift, most complete perfection, most
great power and strongest might!  His Face glisteneth
a glistening whereby the horizons are illumined!  Therefore,
forget not this account as long as thou art living,
forasmuch as there are signs for it in the passing centuries
and ages.

     Upon ye be greeting and praise!

     "If the people live and act in accord with
     the General Tablets which are revealed
     in the beloved of the East and of the
     West, this universe will become another
     universe, and the whole existence of this
     world will be clad in another garment"

+P 485
                 TABLETS OF ABDUL-BAHA

O thou who art firm in the Covenant!

     Thou hast asked regarding the phrase, "He is God!"
written above the Tablets.  By this Word it is intended
that no one hath any access to the Invisible Essence.
The way is barred and the road is impassable.  In this
world all men must turn their faces toward "Him-whom
God-shall-Manifest."  He is the "Dawning-place of
Divinity" and the "Manifestation of Deity."  He is
the "Ultimate Goal," the "Adored One" of all and the
"Worshipped One" of all.  Otherwise, whatever flashes
through the mind is not that Essence of essences and
the Reality of realities; nay, rather it is pure imagination+F1
woven by man and is surrounded, not the surrounding.
Consequently, it returns finally to the realm
of suppositions and conjectures.


O God!  O thou Attracted of the hearts of the favored
   ones toward the Manifest Horizon!

     Verily, Thou art witnessing that the fire is ablaze in
the breasts, the tears are streaming from the eyes and
the period of patience and silence hath come to an end.
The eyes of the beloved ones, O my God, are swimming
in tears; the hearts of the yearning ones, O my Beloved,
are wandering in the wilderness of Thy mercifulness;
and the souls of the attracted ones, O my Desires, are
afflicted with anguish on account of Thy separation!
     Verily, they have heard Thy universal proclamation,


------------------------
1.  See page 562
+P 486
O my God, and what Thou has revealed in the Koran:
"Say! travel ye on earth, so that ye may behold the
signs of the mercy of God."  thereupon, after Thy ascension,
the people of faithfulness have arisen, traveling
to distant lands and hastening to far and remote
regions of the world, in order to cry out Thy Name,
to remind the souls of the arrival of Thy days, to lead
the minds to the fountain of Thy signs, to demonstrate
to all the inhabitants of the world Thy proof and Thy
religion, to guide the truth seekers to the right path
and to indicate the straight highway to the strivers.
From among them is Thy servant ... who is
firm in the Ancient Covenant, fleeing from the people
of darkness, drinking from the water of eternal life
and intoxicated with the wine which is overflowing from
the divine cup.  Verily, he hath left his native abode,
waved the hand of farewell to his relatives, forsaken
ease and comfort, hastened to strange and unknown
kingdoms and accepted hardship and adversities while
heralding Thy Name, commemorating Thy glorification,
attracted to Thy beauty, stirred by the fragrances
of Thy holiness, speaking Thy praises, voicing Thy
Cause, guiding others to Thee, proving Thy religion,
demonstrating Thy irrefutable truth, becoming an answerer
to every questioning one and a guide to every
one held in error!
     O my Lord!  O my Lord!  Verily, he endured every
affliction in Thy path and bore patiently every hardship
and adversity in Thy love.  A breath of rest hath he
not breathed, neither hath his sought after any favor,
abode or habitation in this world; nay, rather hath he
walked in the footsteps of Thy most exalted Word, His


+P 487
Highness Christ, for he hath taken the stars for his
lamp, the earth for his bed and the herbs for his food.
Notwithstanding this, his cry was raised in the assemblages
and his voice was heard in the meetings.
The seekers flowed toward him and the thirsty ones
hastened to drink from the water of his utterance.  O
my God!  This is no other than through Thy generosity,
Thy beneficence, Thy mercy and Thy favors.  O
my God!  Help him by the hosts of the approximate
angels, assist him by the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse
amid Thy creatures, make him a lamp of guidance
in that distant part of the earth and a luminary
shining and sparkling from the dawning-place of faithfulness,
in order that he may serve Thy holy threshold,
falling prostrate upon the ground thanking and praising
for Thy bounty, liberality and gifts to him; girding
up his loins of endeavor in Thy service and becoming
reinforced and empowered in Thy adoration!
     O my Lord!  O my Lord!  Assign for him every
bounty and suffer him to become the sign of Thy gifts
amid Thy people.  Then have pity upon me, forgive
me, show me Thy mercy and make me a sharer in his
services, a partner in his adversities and a companion in
his loneliness.
     Verily Thou art the Confirmer, the Assister, the
Mighty, the Generous, the Compassionate and the
Merciful!


O thou who art firm in the Covenant!

     Your letters have been received.  God willing, answer
will be given very soon, but as a matter of great
importance is on foot (afloat), therefore I write it to

+P 488
you in brief and it is this, that his honor Mr. ...
must compose a letter of thanks on behalf of the believers
of America in general and that letter of thanks
should be addressed to a very eminent and lofty personage.
(The contents of that letter must be of this
nature:)  "That excellent news hath reached American
countries that His Royal Highness, the noble Prince,
hath dealt with utmost justice with the subjects and the
people and hath treated all the subjects with perfect
equality.  He hath protected the rights of all and forbidden
the extortions of the tyrants.  He is dealing
with utmost kindness and affinity and is an asylum for
every oppressed one and an open treasury to every indigent
one.  He decides with justice the case of every
pleader and is a refuge and protection to the helpless.
Consequently, we in general, who are the well-wishers
of the government and Persian nation, with utmost
gratification are praising and commending the justice
of His Royal Highness, the Prince, and are content
and glad; and in order to manifest our thanks we present
this petition; and whatever in the line of service is
commanded us, we are ready to comply with the  most
extreme diligence.  We ask earnestly from God that the
Imperial Government become everlasting, His Imperial
Majesty, the just Shah, remain and live long, and His
Royal Highness, the Prince, become to every subject a
divine gift and that he may become confirmed and
helped in all affairs."
     Let there be two copies of this petition and the ore
the believers sign each of these two copies, the better
it is.  Each person must sign personally.  Then (when
they are finished) you forward them here.  We will

+P 489
write on them the address and forward to their destination.
Wisdom does not permit the mentioning of the
name of these two distinguished personages; therefore,
it is better to be left unknown.
     His honor Mr. ... must compose these two
petitions in English with utmost eloquence and perfect
style.  You, likewise, must translate them and forward
them here with the translations.
     Upon thee be greeting and praise!


O thou who art firm in the Covenant!

     Now I have found the opportunity to answer the petitions
recently received and forward them to you in
this mail.
     Regarding the subject of Persia:  Praise be to God!
she became the East of the Sun of Truth in this age.
The Light of Eternity dawned, the Everlasting Glory
unveiled her countenance and the Reality of the Mercifulness
became manifest.  This is the prosperity of Persia.
Undoubtedly she will progress day by day under
the shade of the Blessed Tree until her illumination
shall penetrate throughout the wide expanse of the
earth.
     Regarding the question of the establishment of the
National Assembly:  This National Assembly+F1 will not
bring any rapid results.  Now some of the agitators are
harboring evil intentions and do not let agreement and
union be realized between the nations and the government.
They are instigating the hopeless ones at every
moment and sending them to the British Legation, while
on the other hand they ask private assistance and protection

------------------------
1.  Established Sept. 12, 1906.
+P 490
from the government so that they may procure
wealth.  Each and all of the clergy are thinking in this
line.
     However, we have nothing to do with these proceedings
and counter-proceedings.  We are commanded
to quicken the souls, to train the characters, to illumine
the realm of man, to guide all the inhabitants of the
earth, to create concord and unity among all men and
to lead the world of humanity to the Fountain of the
Everlasting Glory.  The reformation of one empire is
not our aim; nay, rather we invoke from God that all
the regions of the world be reformed and cultivated; the
republic of men become the manifestors of the bounty
of the most glorious Lord; the East and the West be
brought nearer together; and that Turk and Tajik,
Iran and America, India and Arabia, Japan and Persia,
China and Germany; in brief, all the nations and peoples
of the world become as one soul and one spirit, in
order that strife and warfare be entirely removed and
the rancor and hostility disappear so that all become as
the waves of one ocean, the drops of one sea, the flowers
of one rose-garden, the trees of one orchard, the
grains of one harvest and the plants of one meadow.
     Regarding the statement that hath been given out as
the saying of His Majesty the Shah:  This hath no
connection whatever with the Bahais; nay, rather it
hath meant the Babis.  Mirza Yahya, the son of Mirza
Hadi of Doulet Abad, and a few souls of Ezelis+F1 who
are living in Teheran and were at one time secret friends
of Jamal-ed-Din of Afghan, have allied themselves
with the party, which is working against the government,

------------------------
1.  Followers of Subi-Ezel who disturbed the Babis by claiming to be the
    One promised by the Bab.
+P 491
and is engaged in the work of instigating and inciting
the people.  His Imperial Majesty did mean
these souls, that is, the Babis, not the Bahais.  But it is
an established facts that the Bahais are the well-wishers
of the nation and the government; are showing forth
obedience and displaying good intentions; are not interfering
in political matters; are engaged in the education
and spiritualization of characters and are occupied
with the training of the ignorant ones.
     O thou who art firm in the Covenant!  The general
historical report about the Cause of God in that country,+F1
that thou hast forwarded to Menshadi,+F2 became
very acceptable.  Undoubtedly you must, every few
months, write a report about the general conditions and
attitudes of the Cause of God in America and forward
it to Acca, so that we may send it to Persia to be printed
and spread among the people.
     O thou yearning servant of the Beauty of Abha!
In the time that all the ulemas and sages, leaders, merchants
and traders, nay, even the public itself from the
highest to the lowest have taken refuge in the British
Legation and began to complain and clamor that they
are oppressed, His Royal Highness Shoa-Us-Saltanah,
the son of the Shah, cried in the Assembly of Nobles:
"These ulemas and Sheite leaders were always stigmatizing
the Bahais, saying, `They are the ill-wishers of
the government and the corruptors of nations!'  Now
consider ye with the eye of justice!  Sixty years have
rolled by and the Bahais have been the object of the
sword of affliction and the target of the arrows of oppression.
Thousands of houses have been destroyed,

------------------------
1.  America.
2.  One of the well-known Bahais in Egypt.
+P 492
children became captives, women became prisoners,
property was pillaged and not even a small children remained
safe; yet, notwithstanding all of this, not one
single Bahai took refuge under the flag of a foreign
power!  Now these Sheites, though they have always
been treated with the utmost favor and benefit by the
government, yet without the slightest reason they went
under the protection of a foreign power and brought
down such humiliation and dishonor upon the nation
and the government!  If they presented primarily their
petitions to the government, their wishes would be complied
with in a better and more effective way.  This is
the difference between the Sheites and the Bahais!"


O thou who art firm in the Covenant!

     I have received the eloquent article which thou hast
written at the moment of the arrival of the most great
glad-tidings regarding the establishment of the National
Assembly and the organization of the constitutional
and judicial government of Persia according to
the evident command of the Book of Akdas, and the
spontaneous joy and the genuine sympathy demonstrated
by the people of science and discernment in America at
hearing this soul-refreshing news, and the utmost happiness
to the members of the Legation.  I read it and
it became the cause of the utmost joy and fragrance.
     The Constitutional Government, according to the irrefutable
text of the Religion of God, is the cause of
the glory and prosperity of the nation and the civilization
and freedom of the people.  However, according
to what is known, the hands of the selfish leaders from
among the ulemas (Mohammedan clergy) are in this

+P 493
affair.  Outwardly they are desiring the establishment
of the National Assembly and at every moment they
are crying and clamoring (for its immediate realization),
but inwardly they are sowing the seeds of corruption
and agitation and try to put at naught the noble
intention of the government.  In the secret of their
hearts and souls they do not favor the upbuilding of
the National Assembly, the civilization of Persia, the
awakening of the people, the advancement of the age,
the spreading of knowledge and public instruction.
Thieves like to lurk in darkness; fishers desire disturbed
water; the bat shuns the rays of the sun; the black
beetle dislikes the fragrance of the rose-garden; the
ferocious wolf is in expectation of the sleet and snow;
and the wine seller sees his advantage in the inebriate,
irrational drinker.  These leaders of religion also desire
to behold the nation thrown into a weltering chaos of
ignorance so that the rein of affairs remain in the hands
of the arrogant ulemas.  They know that if the nation
began to adore wisdom, truthfulness, progression and
fidelity, it would bring about their (the ulemas)
degradation.
     However, rest ye assured upon the favor and bounty
of His Highness the Almighty; for the Imperial throne
of Persia is confirmed and the Crown of the Sovereignty
of the East is protected,.  Undoubtedly the noble purpose
of His Imperial Majesty will play an important
role in the development of Persia.  May God help and
send victory from the Supreme Kingdom, the heavenly
powers become supporters and the mercy and bestowal
of His Highness the Merciful One become the Helpers!
Be ye engaged in prayer that with the utmost good-pleasure

+P 494
the nation obey the government, comply with
the wise counsels of the attendants of the central dominion,
give no attention to the hearsay of the agitators
and rise not to quarrel with and to protest against
the government like unto the Russian Douma, so as to
throw the whole empire, the nation and the kingdom into
a sea of anarchy and lawlessness.  Much prayer is
needed so that God may help and protect.
     The marks of kindness that thou hast shown to his
honor Mr. ... became highly acceptable.  You
must treat the strangers, at all times, in this manner
and help, as far as possible, all the nations of the world.
     O thou who art firm in the Covenant!  Truly, I say,
thou art firm and have arisen to perform the conditions
of firmness.  This very matter of his honor Mr. ...
is a sign of wonder to all men and the greatest
proof of the power of the Word of God and the penetration
of the servitude of Abdul-Baha.  As thou art
walking in this road and art steadfast in this path,
know thou of a certainty that the assistance of Providence
with descend upon thee and the confirmation of
the Kingdom unveil herself to thee.


O thou who art firm in the Covenant!

     An article in the Broadway Magazine of September,
1906, written by G. A. Dobson and published in New
York, was read.  It is entitled, "The Strangest Religion
in New York."  Unquestionably, you get that magazine
and read it.  The writer complains of the Ottoman
government and its treatmet towards the Bahai community.
There is no doubt that this article will be
read by His Excellency the Turkish Minister or the

+P 495
members of the Legation.  The truth is that His Imperial
Majesty the Sultan Abdul Hamid Khan hath
exercised the utmost justice toward Abdul-Baha.  Although
the internal and external enemies entered into
an alliance, wrote reports full of pure calumnies and
baseless impositions, became themslves the complainers
and witnesses, a body of examiners came from Constantinople
for the investigation of the true situation
and that committee of commissioners became united
with the outside and inside enemies, ratifying all the
impositions and adding to those some more important
matters, yet His Imperial Majesty Abdul Hamid Khan
- may God assist him! - acted with delilberation until it
became known and evident that all these calumnies were
founded upon rancor and hositility.  Therefore, he hath
treated us, until the present time, with the utmost justice
and because of this treatment we are exceedingly
happy.  If there were any other king beside His Imperial
Majesty Sultan Abdul Hamid Khan, he would
exercise his autority in another way in the face of
these unjust imputations and the conspiracies of the
external and internal foes.  Nevertheless, the justice
and equity of the Sultan prevented the attacks of the
enemies and the reports of the people of oppositions
and falsehood from producing any effect.  Therefore,
all the friends must pray from their hearts in behalf of
their Imperial Majesties the Padeshah of the Ottomans
and the Shah of Persia.  As in these days His
Imperial Majesty Sultan Abdul Hamid Khan is in a
state of illness and indisposition, therefore the believers
of God, in meetings and assemblages, in private and
public, but invoke from the Threshold of Oneness

+P 496
swift recovery for him.  The friends and strangers must
know and realize that all the believers of God have the
utmost love for His Majesty the Padeshah of the Ottoman
empire and that they are entreating for him protection
and confirmation.


O thou who art firm in the Covenant!

     The International Congress of Religions was organized
this year+F1 in the capital of Japan.  Many souls
hastened to that empire from different parts of the
world, in order that they might talk of and discuss the
principles of their own religions, each one longing to
convert that assembly to his own religion and establish
the validity of his own particular belief.  This congress
had under discussion the politics of the religions.,  In
truth, it is a political affair and not the attraction of the
heart, faith, advancement toward God nor enkindlement
with the fire of the love of God.  This congress
will not produce a lasting effect, for it is essentially
politico-religious.  What is effective and conducive to
the penetration of the Word of God and the attraction
of hearts is the fragrances of holiness and the divine
glad-tidings, which the members of the congress do not
in the least comprehend.
     Consequently, if the believers of God go to that country -
not to the congress - and through the power of the
Word of God, the breath of the Holy Spirit, the reading
of the verses of Oneness and associating with the
individual inhabitants of that kingdom, undoubtedly
untold and tremendous results will be realized and the
sweet fragrance of the rose-garden of mysteries will

------------------------
1.  During 1906.
+P 497
perfume the nostrils of the people of those regions.  It
is significantly useful if some of the friends of God put
forth and effort and hasten from America to those parts
(Japan).
     O thou servant of God!  Unquestionably, through
the manifestation of the Infinite Power in this glorious
age, wonderful signs will appear in the world and great
changes are seen in the present and promised in the
future, for the Word of God is like unto the Spirit, and
the contingent world like unto the embryo in the womb
of the mother.  Through the power of the Spirit such
various changes and metamorphoses become apparent,
transforming them from one form to another.  Especially
in Persia, through the power of the Word of God,
wonderful signs will appear.
     O thou servant of the True One!  Though I had
not the opportunity of reading one line of the paper
* * * yet I read it with the utmost attention.  Truly,
I say, it was a superior paper and the details of the
reception of the two great ambassadors in the house of
the favored and attracted maid-servant of God, Miss
..., became known.  Such receptions are very
acceptable and praiseworthy.  You must all show forth
the utmost consideration to these two ambassadors,
neither do ye fall short in serving them in whatever
manner possible.
     It is very acceptable for you to present to them the
excellent praises which the Blessed Perfection hath
made in behalf of these two governments, the exhortations
which He hath delivered for obedience to them
and the prayers He hath written for the confirmation
and protection of His Imperial Majesty the Shah.

+P 498
Likewise, the advices and recommendations that this
servant (Abdul-Baha, himself) hath written in Tablets
to Persia and America; also the irrefutable command
that the Blessed Perfection hath given in Tablets that
the believers must obey the kings with the utmost sincerity
and fidelity, and He hath forbidden them to interfere
at all with political problems.  He hath even
prohibited the believers from discussing political affairs.
     Convey respectful greeting on my behalf to the
favored maid-servant of God, Miss ..., the
the utmost kindness and announce to her:  "These
services and self-sacrifices of thine in the Kingdom of
God are acceptable."
     O thou servant of the Blessed Perfection!  Since I
have found this paper very eloquent, I send it to Persia.
     O thou dear friend!  I entreat from His Highness
the Desired One that He may grant divine confirmation
to that illumined youth to such an extent that he may
become the main-spring of spiritual emotions in those
regions.
     Convey respectful greeting with the utmost longing
to all the friends of God on behalf of this servant.


     Thy+F1 letters were received.  Although thou hast
complained on account of not receiving answers to the
petitions of the people, yet thou hast no right to do so,
for the letters coming from those regions are like unto
a sea - who is able to answer all of them?  Some of
the letters are not received and this is not the fault of
the friends and, as the administration of the post is not
well organized, many letters are lost in the mail.  But

------------------------
1. Following Tablet as received bore no opening line of address.
+P 499
to those letters which are received, God willing, no
neglect will be displayed so far as there is time to
answer them.
     Thou hast written regarding the formation of three
gatherings for spreading the Tablets; this is very acceptable.
     Convey greeting on my behalf to the maid-servant
of God, Miss ....  I have written two Tablets
with my own hand to her so that she may realize that
her services are accepted.  Likewise, I have written a
Tablet to his honor Mr. ..., with my own hand,
so that he may known also that his endeavors are praised.
     Thou hast forwarded the copies of six letters addressed
to thee form different assemblies in America.
I have not yet found time to read them, but, God willing,
I will read them.  Rest thou assured.
     I have not time at the present for more than this.
     Upon thee be greeting and praise!


O thou who are firm in the Covenant!

     Thou has written regarding the articles and papers
which are written by the believers of God and the forwarding
of them to this land for correction.  This
servant, on account of the multitude of works and occupations,
hath no time whatever to attend to this matter.
If this articles are read in the spiritual assembly
of each city in America and the printing and spreading
of them is advised and approved by the assembly, it is
acceptable.  This permission is granted so that those
souls do not become disappointed and may be engaged
in the composition and printing of instructive papers.

+P 500
Mr. ... will arrive here and we will discuss with
him regarding this matter.
     Say to Mr. ...:  "If he writeth any article
and the spiritual assembly of Washington doth approve
its circulation, the spreading will be of good results."
     His honor ... hath not displayed the slightest
shortcoming or omission in forwarding the letters and
papers to this land.  Know ye this for a certainty.
Some of the letters have been received, but there hath
not yet been time to answer them; while on the other
hand some of them are lost in the mail.  Whatever
hath been received, its answer dependeth upon time and
opportunity.
     But regarding the articles:  These articles must be
revised and corrected by those souls who know the
history of the Cause.  If they approve their circulation
undoubtedly it will lead to the rapid promotion of the
Cause.  For this servant hath no time whatever (to
revise those articles).
     Regarding the receipt of letters and their early
acknowledgment:  A new and complete system is organized.
God willing, it will become perfected and
put into execution.
     O thou who are firm in the Covenant!  Convey the
longing greeting of this servant to his honor Professor
....  The association which he hath organized
is acceptable and beloved.  God willing, he will become
assisted and the confirmations of the Kingdom of Abha
will descend.  Today any soul who is planted, like a
tree, along the steam of this divine rose-garden, will
grow and develop through the infinite outpourings.  For
the rays of the Sun of Truth will shine forth, the Divine

+P 501
Husbandman will irrigate and the soul-refreshing breeze
will waft from the direction of grace.  Consequently,
that tree will find the utmost freshness and delicacy,
producing delicious fruits.  Deliver to him the enclosed
Tablet.
     Thou hast written regarding his honor Mr. ....
This personage is a believer and assured; he is attracted,
enkindled and of the utmost sincerity.  The
believers of God must have the utmost consideration toward
him; they must not avoid him; they must seek
his companionship in a cheerful manner,.  For this
servant (Abdul-Baha) is intoxicated with the wine of
servitude and he is happy and joyful in the thralldom
of God.  Therefore, all must declare and do whatever
is the wish of his heart and soul.  The point is there:
The believers must associate with Mr. ... with
joy and love.
     Thou hast written regarding the reception at the
Persian Legation and the presence of the people of intelligence,
His Excellency the Turkish Minister, and
the conversation of the attracted maid-servants of God,
... and ....  This news imparted the
greatest joy and happiness.


O heavenly one!

     The maid-servant of God ... hath praised
thee!  I hope thou wilt acquire great proficiency in
writing literature, composition, eloquence of tongue and
fluency of speech, co-operating with the maid-servant
of God in the service of God, becoming an esteemed
servant in the Threshold of Oneness and partaking of
a share of the heavenly gifts, and progressing day by

+P 502
day until thou attain to the apex of the excellencies
of this human world.


O ye+F1 illumined friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful!

     When the darkness of ignorance and heedlessness
concerning the realm of eternity and bereavement (or
deprivation) from the True One had encircled the
universe, then the resplendent Luminary dawned and
the brilliant Light illumined the horizon of the East.
Hence, the Sun of Realty shone forth, scattering the
sparkling lights of the Kingdom to the East and to the
West.  Those who had seeing eyes found the Most
Great Glad-Tidings, began to cry the call, "O blessed
are we!  O blessed are we!" - and have beheld the
reality of things in themselves, have discovered the
mysteries of the Kingdom, were released from superstition
and doubts, perceived the lights of Truth and
became so intoxicated with the cup of the love of
God, that, wholly forgetting themselves and the world
while dancing, they ran with utmost joy and ecstasy to
the city of Martyrdom, sacrificing their minds and
their lives upon the altar of Love.
     But those who were blinded became astonished and
on account of these joyous acclamation were bewildered
and beginning to cry, "Where is the light?" and said,
"We do not behold any light, we do not see any rising
sun!  It is void of any truth!  This is pure imagination!"
     However, they have hastened bat-like in the darkness
below the ground, and according to their own

------------------------

+P 503
thoughts they have found a little comfort and tranquility.
Nevertheless, it is yet the early dawn and
the strength of the heat and the rays of the Sun of
Truth have not yet made their torrid and complete
impression.  When it reacheth the zenith, the heat will
interpenetrate with such great intensity that it will move
and spur to the greatest velocity even the insects below
the earth.  Alhtough they are not able to behold
the light, yet the penetration of the heat will move and
agitate all of them.
     Consequently, O ye friends of God, be ye thankful
that in the Day of the Effulgence ye have turned your
faces to the Orb of the regions and beheld the Lights!
Ye have received a portion from the rays of Truth and
are endowed with a share from the Everlasting Outpouring.
Therefore, ye must not rest one minute, but
thank Him for this bestowal.
     Be ye not seated and silent!  Diffuse the glad-tidings
of the Kingdom far and wide to the ears, promulgate
the Word of God, and put into practice the advices
and covenants of God; that is, arise ye with such
qualities and attributes that ye may continually bestow
life to the body of the world, and nurse the infants of
the universe up to the station of maturity and perfection.
Enkindle with all your might in every meeting
the light of the love of God, gladden and cheer every
heart with the utmost loving-kindness, show forth your
love to the strangers just as you show forth to your
relations.  If a soul is seeking to quarrel, ask ye for
reconciliation; if he blame ye, praise [him]; if he give
you a deadly poison, bestow ye an all-healing antidote;
if he createth death, administer ye eternal life; if he

+P 504
becometh a thorn, change ye into roses and hyacinths.
Perchance, though such deeds and words, this darkened
world will become illuminated, this terrestrial universe
will become transformed into a heavenly realm,
and this satanic prison become a divine court; warfare
and bloodshed be annihilated, and love and faithfulness
hoist the tent of unity upon the apex of the world.
     These are the results of the divine advices and exhortations,
and the epitome of the teachings of the
Bahai Cycle.


O thou who art advanced toward the Kingdom!

     Thy letter was received and its contents created joy,
for it showed thy faith and assurance.  Thou hast written
that they have expelled thee from the church and
thy friends are manifesting aversion toward thee.  This
is the beginning of thy trials.  There are greater trials
than these.  Therefore, be thou not sad, nay rather, be
thou happy and full of glad-tidings.  There is no harm
done if they have expelled thee from the church.  Thou
hast stepped into the Kingdom of God.  Thou hast
entered into the Heavenly Jerusalem and discovered
the Way to the Holy of Holies of the Kingdom.  That
church is of stone and cement, whereas this Holy of
Holies is of overwhelming Light.
     But the more the tormenting friends shun thee, go
thou the nearer to them.  The more they deride and
blame thee, show thou forth the greater love and affection.
Do not look upon their shortcomings.  Look
thou upon all of them as the people of God and endeavor
thou in right-doing and well-meaning.  Ignorant

+P 505
are they; understand they do not.  Therefore they are
avoiding, criticizing and scorning thee.
     Do not pursue thy friend, ...; leave him to
himself.
     In the time of invocation to God, I remember thee
and supplicate and entreat Him to confirm thee and
assist thee in the service of His holy vineyard.


O thou yearner after the Kingdom of God!

     The maid-servant of God, Aseyeh, hath mentioned
thy name in her letter, praising and commending thee.
Likewise thy letter was received.  I was exceedingly
happy on account of the love of the maid-servant of
God, Aseyeh, for thee.  The advent of the prophets
and the revelation of the Holy Books is intended to
create love between souls and friendship between the
inhabitants of the earth.  Real love is impossible unless
one turn his face towards God and be attracted to His
Beauty.  The maid-servants of the Merciful should
love each other with heart and soul; for though there
be many bodies, the spirit of the faith is one and the outpouring
of the Holy Spirit is universal.  There is one
Light but many lamps; there is one Wine but the glasses
differ.  So thou shouldst love with all thy heart and
soul the maid-servants of the Merciful and associate
with them in utmost affection in order that thou mayest
realize divine happiness and behold the outpouring of
mercy.
     I beseech God that heavenly blessings may descend
upon thee, guiding thy relatives, adding day by day to
thy joy and happiness, so that thou mayest become a
heavenly herald, leading others to the Light of Truth.

+P 506
O thou attracted maid-servant of God!

     Thy letter was received.  Its contents were redolent
with spiritual emotion.  Praise be unto God! who hath
created sanctified souls, illumining them with the reflections
of the Sun of Truth, and raising certain persons
for the service of the Kingdom and gardening in the
divine orchard.  I hope thou wilt become a fruitful
tree producing sweet fruits.  Trust thou in the bounties
of God and engage thyself in His service.
     Praise be to God! that thou feelest progress in the
luminous realm through divine love.  This very fact
denotes that, God willing, thou art to be a fruitful tree;
nay, rather, thou wilt become a rose-garden of the
hyacinths+F1 of realities and significances.  Supplicate
God that thou mayest become so.  Verily this is not
impossible for God to fulfill!


O ye two dear maid-servants of God!

     Your longing to visit the Sacred Soil+F2 is expressed
and evident and your presence will be a source of
pleasure to me.
     But the best of meetings is the spiritual meeting;
for in these days visits to these regions are accomplished
with difficulty.
     I ask God that the spiritual meeting become realized
so that the illumined bounty may prevail, the inner
susceptibilities may be awakened and the eternal meeting
in the Kingdom of God may be attained.

O ye two+F1 dear maid-servants of God!

     Man must prove whatsoever he speaketh by deeds
and actions.  If he claim faith, he must live and do
according to the teachings of the Kingdom of Abha.
     Praise be to God! you have proved your words by
deeds, were confirmed by divine strength and have
gathered together the Bahai children in the morn and
taught them communion (prayers).  This deed is very
acceptable and the joy of hearts, that children gather
every morn and turn to the Kingdom, mention God and
commune in the utmost of sweetness and bounty.
     Those children are like plants and this teaching and
praying as rain which gives freshness and delicacy and
as the zephyr of the love of God which revives.
     Blessed are ye and good is your end!

thou shalt see that the East hath embraced the West and
that the Occident and Orient are attracted to each other.
They will become as one soul, one heart and one body."

O thou who art attracted to the Kingdom of God!

     Thou wert an extinguished candle; now - praise be
to God! - thou art ignited; silent wert thou, but how
thou hast become a speaker, a seer, a hearer, living
and endowed with eternal life.!
     Today, any soul who looseneth his tongue in the delivery
of Truth and is engaged in the diffusion of the
fragrances of God, he shall undoubtedly be assisted and
confirmed by the Holy Spirit and can resist the attacks
of all the people of the world, [for the] power of the
Realm of Might shall prevail.  That is why thou seest
that, although the disciples of Christ were physically
weak and apparently vanquished by the persecution of
every king, yet in the end were victorious over all and
brought them under their protection.


O thou maid-servant of God!

     Thy letter was received.  Thou hast written of the
organization of an assembly in that city.  Look not at
the small number; nay, rather seek the pure hearts.
One holy soul is better than one thousand other souls.
If a few souls gather together in a beloved meeting
with the feelings of the Kingdom, with the divine attractions,
with pure hearts and with absolute purity and
holiness, to consort in spirit and fragrance, that gathering
will have its effect upon all the world.  The conditions,
the words and the deeds of that gathering will
lead a world to eternal happiness and will be an evidence

+P 509
of the favors of the Kingdom.  The Holy Spirit
will strengthen them and the hosts of the Supreme
Concourse will render them victorious and the angels
of Abha will come in succession.  By angels is meant
the divine confirmations and heavenly powers.  Angels
are also those holy souls who have severed attachment
to the earthly world, who are free from the fetters of
self and passion and who have attached their hearts to
the Divine Realm and the Merciful Kingdom.  They
are of the Kingdom, heavenly; they are of the Merciful
One, divine.  They are the manifestations of the divine
grace and the dawns of spiritual bounty.
     O maid-servant of God!  Thank God!  Thy dear
husband inhaled a breath of the rose-garden of the
Kingdom.  Now thou must draw him nearer daily
through the love of God and good conduct.
     The San Francisco+F1 occurrences were great.  Such
events ought to awaken people and they should attach
themselves less to the mortal world; for the earthly
world hath such painful experiences and offers such cups
from the bitter wine.


O thou dear maid-servant of God!

     Thy letter and that of thy revered daughter were
received last year, but the storm of trials was so severe
as to hinder the writing of the answers.  You will certainly
excuse.  But I have implored and supplicated the
Kingdom of Abha for you and have sought help and
grace (in your behalf).  Thus may your hearts be set
aglow with the fire of the love of God and [may it]

burn away the self-life.  Night and day may you serve
the divine garden, endeavor to promulgate the lights
of the knowledge of God, attract souls and set aglow
the hearts.  I am hopeful that thus will ye do.  If ye
reach this most glorious and sublime station, ye will
receive congratulative letters from the Kingdom of
Abha.


O thou confident leaf!

     Thank thou God that thou hast been guided by the
light of guidance and illumined by the brilliance of the
Supreme Concourse, kindled by the fire of the love of
God and hath directed thyself to His Kingdom, partook
of the heavenly table and enjoyed the fruits of the
Tree of Life!
     Thou hast been confirmed in serving those who are
nigh unto the divine household.  Thou hast been cut
from aught else save God and hast been made a maid-servant
for the men of God+F1 .
     This is now servitude by sovereignty, and this is not
service but chieftanship and greatness!  This is the garment
of everlasting glory with which thou hast clothed
thyself, and this is the rose of eternal exaltation with
which thou hast adorned thy head.  It is said in the
New Testament:  "Whosoever will be chief among you,
let him be your servant."  In short, thou shouldst thank
God a hundred-thousand times for having been confirmed
and strengthened in obtaining such a great gift!
Know thou the value thereof and consider that its price
is highly appraised.

[your children] may be educated under the shadow of
the Tree of Life; that all the family may discover the
way to the temple of the Lord and gather in the
Kingdom of Abha.
     You have written that the Cause of God is progressing
in that city.  Through the showers of the glad-tidings
of the Cause of God a small mustard seed hath
become a fruitful spreading tree - its roots in the hearts
of the people.  I pray, also, that God may in such wise
cultivate and nurture that Tree that it cast its shadow
over that vast and great country, distributing to all the
fruits of divine knowledge and eternal life.
     O ye two lovers of the Beauty of Abha!  Ere long
the Word of God will display a wonderful influence
and finally that region (America) will become the paradise
of Abha.  Consequently, strive ye bravely that
this aim may be accomplished in the near future.
Striving means this:  Ye must live and move according
to the divine commands and behests, be united in loving
with ecstasy and joy; do not take any rest but engage
continually in the service of the Cause of God.


O thou maid-servant of God!

self and desire.  Exert thyself night and day until

Abandon the body and the material, until the merciful
powers may become manifest; because not until the soil
is become pure will it develop through the heavenly
bounty; not until the heart is purified, will the radiance
of the Sun of Truth shine therein.  I beg of God that
thou wilt day by day increase the purity of thy heart,
and cheerfulness of thy soul, the light of thy insight
and the search for Truth.


O thou honorable one!

supplication, in order that the souls may become quickened,
the hearts may become attracted and all may
become inflamed with the fire of the love of God!


O thou seeker after Truth!

     The question of the Trinity, since the time of His
Holiness Christ until now, is the belief of the Christians,
and to the present time all the learned among them are
perplexed and confounded.  All have confessed that
the question is beyond the grasp of reason, for three
cannot become one, nor one three.  To unite these is
impossible; it is either one or three.  If we say the
Essence of Divinity is divided, even in some aspects,
division is one of the necessities of the contingent world
and of generation, but the Ancient is holy (i.e., whole
and indivisible).  If we say that the Trinity was

+P 513
originally one and was later divided, change and transformation
will be necessarily applied to the Essence of
Oneness, and change and transformation are necessities
of the contingent world and not of the Essence of
Divinity.  If we say this number is Ancient, three
Ancients become necessary, and among the three some
are distinguished which are also Ancients.  In this wise
five Ancients are the result, and among the five are those
who are distinguished and thus nine Ancients become
necessary, and so on ad infinitium.
     Thus considered, Trinity is made a necessity, although
the falsity of Trinity is evident.  Furthermore, the signs
of oneness are evident and plain in all existence.  If
thou shouldst gather all existent beings, thou wouldst
be unable to find two alike in all states and qualities;
of necessity there is a difference.  Thus the signs of oneness
are manifest and evident in all things.  How
much more is the Creator of all things!
     But there are, in the Gospels, clear expressions indicative
of Trinity; among them:  "The Father is in the
Son and the Son is in the Father."  As Christians did
not understand the meaning of this expression, their
thoughts were scattered.
     The reality of this question is as follows:  Divine
Oneness is proven and He revealeth Himself in the
Holy Essences.  The sun is one sun but manifesteth
itself in different mirrors.  If thou lookest into the
mirror and seest the manifestation of the sun, thou wilt
way, the sun is in the mirror and this sun manifest in
the mirror is the same sun of the heavens; although two
suns, yet in reality they are one.  The sun hath not
descended from its high and lofty station, it hath not

+P 514
taken up its abode in this mirror, but hath manifested
itself therein.
     The Christ reality was like unto a pure mirror and
the Sun of Reality shone upon it from the Holy Horizon.
Therefore, it bcame evident that the sun is one
with regard to reality but manifesting itself in all
mirrors.
     This question was explained in full for Miss
..., who translated it upon paper.  Thou wilt
soon learn thereof+F1 .  This difficult question in its entirety
was elucidated, explained and proven.


O thou yearner after the Truth!

     The Supper of the Lord which His Highness the
Spirit (Christ) ate with the apostles was a heavenly
supper and not one of material bread and water, for
material objects have no connection with spiritual objects.
As at that time material food was also present,
therefore the leaders of the religion of Christ thought
that it was material food which was changed into
spiritual food.
     The proof that it was not material food is this:  The
apostles upon many occasions partook of material food
with His Highness Christ, yet the supper of that night
became designated as the "Lord's Supper."  From this
designation it is plain and evident that they ate heavenly
food at that supper.  That heavenly food consisted of
the love of God, the knowledge of God, the mysteries
of God and the bestowal of God.

O thou seeker of Truth!

     The Lord of Hosts became manifest to Moses and
the children of Israel in a pillar of fire, and appeared
to Christ in the fire of the love of God.  This is that
of which it is said in the Gospel:  One must be baptized
with fire and spirit.
     Now the lights of the divine bounties of the fire of
the love of God have shone forth in the word and
letters.  That is, the words and letters are similar to a
mirror, and the Sun of Truth and the Rays of Significances
have become manifest and shone forth in these
mirrors of words and letters.
     Seek thou from God that thy heart may be as one
of these letters, until the Eternal Bounty may cast a
ray of splendor therein.
     Pay attention minutely and cogitate, until thou mayest
apprehend the meaning of this explanation and advance
day by day, like unto thy dear mother.


O thou that mirror in which the Light of Guidance is printed!

     My standard is the commemoration of my Lord!
     My hosts are the knowledge of my Master!
     My sword is the guidance of God!

lowliness, my abasement, my supplication and my beseeching
unto God - this is that permanent reign which
no one is able to dispute, gainsay or usurp!

+P 516
     I beg God to cause thee to be one of the pillars of
this divine reign, that thou mayest abundantly partake
of this joy and gladness, and I invoke God that He
may register thy name in the published Tablet, in the
pages of the Kingdom of God.  I beg God to cause thy
kinsmen (those who are near and dear to thee) to
attain that which thou hast attained, to drink from
that Cup wherefrom thou art exhilarated, to brighten
their eyes through that Light whereby thine eyes were
brightened and to cause them to hearken to that Call
whereby thine ears were delighted; and that He may
make you assemble under the shadow of the Tree of
the Testament, and cause you to be of the hosts of His
Kingdom, that ye may conquer the East of that region
as well as its West, through the sword of peace and
the weapons of love, union and agreement, and that He
may make thee to be a server in His blessed Olive Garden,
and in his El-Abha (i.e., Most Glorious) Paradise,
and in His Holy Garden of the Supreme Kingdom.


O thou who art always calling on God!

     Thank thou God for He hath guided thee to the
path of His Kingdom and provided thee with the fruit
of the Tree of Life, which is planted in the middle of
the Ferdowee (i.e., the highest Paradise).  Yea, this
fruit is the knowing God and love for God, and reliance
upon God and is the virtue with which the reality of
man is adorned, and it is the perfections which are the
great gift for the children of Adam (i.e., mankind) in
this first creation.
     Verily, I beg of God to bestow upon thee and thy

thee and for them everlasting glory and eternal life in

thankfulness, for thou hast guided her to the Kingdom
of her great Lord.
     Verily, I say unto thee, this is better for thee than
to possess the treasures of the world, because by this
means thou wilt be drawn nigh to the Kingdom of God
and the protection of the Merciful One will always
possess thee.


O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!

     Beloved art thou, for thou hast lighted the lamp of

His Name among the people and guided them to the
Kingdom of El-Abha.
     O maid-servant of God!  Fly away with joy, for
God hath strengthened thee in this great gift, which is
a glorious crown, the gems of which are scintillating
with the light of guidance.  Blessed is thy head for it
is decorated with this crown.  Verily, this is better for
thee than the dominion of the world!


O thou who art calling in the cities, the bearer of the

breeze, which is emanating for the people of the world.
     I ask God to make thee a lamp shining and illuminating
in the assemblies of knowledge, that thou shine forth
by the lights of love and peace among the maid-servants
of God, the Merciful.
     O maid-servant of God!  Be a caller to universal
peace, a standard of love among the people, a spreader
of the spirit of concord and union among nations and
sects, an utterer of exhortations, a demonstrator of the
proofs of the appearance of the Kingdom of God, by
a power whereby the hearts of the chosen ones become
attracted, confirmed by a might whereto the necks of
the proud men bow and those of great people are
humbled.
     Take hold of the hem of the Garment of God and
preach the Kingdom of God and baptize the spirits by
the fragrances of God which have perfumed the
horizons.
     Verily, I say unto thee that this holy fragrance is the
Water of Life, the Fire of the Lord which hath flamed
in the Tree of Sinai and the Spirit of Life which
reviveth the dead.
     We send thee herewith answers to the letters thou
sent us.  This is on account of my utmost love for thee,
my great kindness to thee and my extreme sympathy
for thee.  Thank thou God for this great favor.

+P 519
O thou who art set aglow with the Fire of the Love of God!

     Verily, I read thy long letter and was informed of
thy visions, which art for whosoever follows the path
of the Kingdom of God.
     These visions repeat themselves, pass away, and appear
to the human sight every instant; but the matter
which hath stability and upon which confidence is laid, is
the bounty of the Kingdom of God and the Center of
Lights.
     As to the zodiac of the stations of the Sun of Truth,
it is the station of the attainment of the mystery of
sacrifice, whereupon the lights of love, harmony and
salvation shine forth and the manifestation of firmness
dawns, in a cause unendurable by the lofty mountains.
     I ask God to confirm thee therein and to make thee
a sign of salvation, a banner of progress, a spreader of
the fragrances of God and a caller in the Name of God.
     Shouldst thou make firm thy feet in the love of God
and hold steadfast to the Great Cause, God will reveal
unto thee mysteries unheard by the ears and incomprehensible
by the intellects.
     As to thy question regarding the meeting of trinity,
it is incumbent on thee to make it a meeting of unity,
an exposition of the mysteries of singleness, the elevation
of the standard of universal love, the spreading of
the knowledge of thy Merciful Lord, the guidance of
the souls unto the path of the Kingdom of God, the
animation of the hearts by the spirit of the love of
God, and the purification of the eyes by the light of the
knowledge of God.
     Verily, I pray God to confirm thee in lighting the

+P 520
lamp of God's love in the hearts and spirits.  It is
incumbent on thee to organize a spiritual assembly in
that city, wherein the mysteries of the Kingdom of thy
Lord be spread and this wondrous Manifestation
promulgated.
     This is beneficial for thee both in the world and in
the Kingdom, and all else vanisheth away.


O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!

     I have read thy recent letter and noted its beautiful
contents.
     I thank God that He hath opened thy sight for thee,
unfolded to thee His word of love and chosen thee from
among women.
     Thus thou responded to the call, east attracted to
the lights of the Kingdom of the Lord of Manifest
Signs, proclaimed the Truth and called in the Name
of the Lord of the high heaven.
     O maid-servant of God!  This day is not a day of
seclusion and solitude, but a day of proclaiming the
manifestation of the light of the Beauty of thy
Supreme Lord.
     Therefore, abandon silence and seclusion and solitary
nooks and go forth into the arena of explanation.
Convey the Message of thy Lord with clearest speech
and most complete elucidation.  This is better for thee
than solitude.
     The season of seclusion in quiet nooks is the season
of winter when the cold and the winds increase.  But
during the spring, the wafting of gentle breezes, the
passing of fragrances from the rose, the state of
equilibrium in the atmosphere and the green hue of

+P 521
valleys and prairies, it is best for man to leave solitude
and enjoy out-of-door blessings.  Thus be thou happy
in the commemoration of thy Lord.
     Go out from the solitary place like unto a shining
star blazing on its horizon.  This is better for thee in
the Kingdom of the Lord of the worlds.  Thus, hearken
unto the melodies of the birds of holiness, in the garden
of fellowship, upon the branches of purity; to the
murmuring of its waters, the rustling of the trees, the
blowing of its breezes and the cooing of its doves.


O thou beloved maid-servant of God!

     The Divine Providence hath chosen thee, made thee
the object of favors and guided thee to the Heavenly
Father.  He bestowed upon thee the eternal outpouring
and granted thee the life everlasting.
     I hope that thou shalt discover the hidden significances
of divine verses, and through the bounty of the
Almighty, thou mayest become informed of the concealed
mystery and recondite symbol of the stone of the
Most Great Name+F1 .  These mysteries can neither be
written nor uttered.  Whenever the eye of insight is
opened, the reality of meanings is understood.
     In reality, all the souls are silent and speechless, but
be thou a a speaker.  God willing, thou wilt become such.


O thou dear maid-servant of God!

     Mr. ... hath greatly praised thee that - praise
be to God! - thou art like unto a melodious nightingale,
singing and warbling in the rose-garden of the love of
God, and art uttering of the mystery of the Kingdom;

------------------------
1.  Ring stone having this design: [Design of Greatest Name]
+P 522
that thy house and dwelling is a meeting-place of the
spiritual ones and thy nest and abode is a shelter for
the birds of heaven.  Nothing is better than that man
should become a manifestor of the powers of God and
the cause of illuminating the creatures.


O thou who art advancing toward the Kingdom!

     Thy letter was received.  From its contents it became
known that thou hast turned thy face toward His Highness,
the Merciful One, after the reading of the Book
of Ighan+F1 , and hast become a new creation.
     I trust in the favor of the True One, that thy sisters
and brothers may likewise attain, and that thou mayest
become confirmed with the confirmation of the Holy
Spirit, in order that thou mayest be the cause of teaching
many souls, and guide every person with whom thou
hast association and intercourse.
     I ask from God that thou mayest be the cause of the
awakening and mindfulness of thy father and mother,
and that many of thy friends may rend asunder the
veils of superstition and behold the Light of Truth.
     O thou advancer toward the Kingdom!  Endeavor
thou day by day to increase thy yearning and attraction,
so that the attitude of supplication and prayer may be
realized more often.
     If we do not meet in this physical word, I ask from
God that we may meet in the realm of vision, and that
day by day the revelation of the Kingdom may become
greater.  ***
     Convey my respectful greeting to Mr. ...  I
hope that he will become confirmed and assisted in his

------------------------
1.  See foot note page 107, Vol. 1, or page 322, Vol. II.
+P 523
voyage to India; and that the power of the Word of
God will penetrate in such wise in those parts (India)
that Mr. ... himself will stand astonished and
add to his faith and assurance.


O thou tree planted in the Garden of the Love of God!

     Although thou art absent in body, yet, praise God!
thou art present in spirit and art illuminated by the
lights of the Divine Love.  Thou must develop day by
day and become more rejoiced than before through the
fragrances of the Holy Spirit and illumine the hearts
of others by the light of the love of God.  I ask God to
confirm thee in the service of the Threshold of God and
to strengthen thee in His servitude, like unto Abdul-Baha.
Thus thou mayest be thrilled with the ecstasy
of the wine of the Covenant and give a drink thereof
unto the world.


O maid-servant of God!
     Thy letter was read.  The doors of the Kingdom are
open and the bounty of God is like unto spring rain.
Although the signs of material bounty are great, yet
the true bounty is that of heaven, spiritual, which gives
life eternal.  Follow this and thy heart will become as
beautiful as a garden, thine eyes bright, thy spirit happy
and thy thought a comfort to souls.
     Be a well-wisher of humanity and a servant of
mankind.  Thus the strength of the Kingdom will uphold
thee and the avenues of revelation open to thee.
Because today every servant is served and is an honorable
lord and every maid-servant the queen of horizons.

+P 524
Grow in humility and meekness daily, until thou
attainest eternal glory and everlasting grace.


O thou who hast turned thy face toward the Kingdom of God!

     Thy letter was received.  In reality thou art spiritually
hungry and athirst for the Water of Life.
Therefore I send to thee spiritual food and bestow
upon thee the Water of Life Eternal.  That food is
the divine advices and exhortations revealed in the
Tablets and the spiritual outpourings of the breath of
the Holy Spirit.  I hope ere long it will reach thee
and thou wilt behold what an exhilaration and beatitude
it produceth and what cheerfulness and serenity and
what heavenly emotions it createth.
     Educate and train thou that dear child with the
utmost perseverance.


O thou yearning one!

     Be thou a physician to every sick one and teach thou
every ignorant one; that is, show thou to others the
way of the Kingdom and guide them to life eternal.
     Praise be to God!  I became known and revealed myself
to thee in the world of vision and instructed thee
in the search of Truth.  Seek thou the light of God,
relate thou the mysteries of the True One and walk
thou in the path of the Kingdom, so that thou mayest
behold wonderful signs and observe universal confirmations.


O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!

     Verily I am in receipt of thy last letter which indicateth
thy exceeding love for Abdul-Baha, thy confidence

+P 525
in God, and thy good and sincere intention in
the service of the Cause of God.
     Excellent is the statement given by thee in that precious
letter - that ye are in need of love and affinity in
that country to unite the hearts and spirits.
     This is the truth and there is naught beyond the
truth save error.  Know thou assuredly that -

     Love is the mystery of divine revelations!
     Love is the effulgent manifestation!
     Love is the spiritual fulfillment!
     Love is the breath of the Holy Spirit inspired into
       the human spirit!
     Love is the cause of the manifestation of the Truth
       (God) in the phenomenal world!
     Love is the necessary tie proceeding from the realities
       of things through divine creation!
     Love is the means of the most great happiness in
       both the material and spiritual worlds!
     Love is a light of guidance in the dark night!
     Love is the bond between the Creator and the creature
       in the inner world!
     Love is the cause of development to every enlightened
       man!
     Love is the greatest law in this vast universe of God!
     Love is the one law which causeth and controleth
       order among the existing atoms!
     Love is the universal magnetic power between the
       planets and stars shining in the loft firmament!

+P 526
     Love is the cause of unfoldment to a searching mind,
       of the secrets deposited in the universe by the Infinite!
     Love is the spirit of life in the bountiful body of
       the world!
     Love is the cause of the civilization of nations in
       this mortal world!
     Love is the highest honor to every righteous nation!

The people who are confirmed therein are indeed glorified
by the Supreme Concourse, the angels of heaven
and the dwellers of the Kingdom of El-Abha!  But
if the hearts of the people become devoid of the Divine
Grace - the Love of God - they wander in the desert
of ignorance, descend to the depths of ruin and fall to
the abyss of despair where there is no refuge!  They
are like insects living in the lowest plane.
     O beloved of God!  Be ye the manifestations of
God and the lamps of guidance throughout all regions
shining with the light of love and union!
     How beautiful the effulgence of this light!
     O my friend!  Let this letter be spread among the
beloved in America, that they may agree, unite and
love one another; nay, rather that they should love all
the people, and (be willing to) sacrifice even their
lives for one another.
     This is the Path of El-Baha!
     This is the Religion of El-Baha!
     This is the Law of El-Baha!
     He who hath not this hath no portion with El-Baha!

+P 527
O thou maid-servant of God!

     I ask from the favors of the Sun of Truth the splendors
of the eternal outpouring for thee; I beg everlasting
glory and desire for thee and thy family divine
gifts, so that all of you may become united and harmonized,
rest under the shade of the Tree of Life, and
become eternal and established in the Kingdom of Being.


O thou who art turning toward the Kingdom of God!

     I was informed of the contents of thy excellent letter
and supplicated the Holy Threshold, the Circuit of
the Supreme Concourse, to baptize thee with the water
of knowledge and the fire of the love of God and to
make thee a perfect and faithful servant in His Great
Vineyard, so that thou mayest water the trees of the
love of God in the Paradise of Abha; and to make
thee a sign of meekness and humbleness among the
maid-servants of God and a promulgator of His Cause
in those vast and extensive regions.


O thou pure soul+F1 who hath turned with a submissive
  heart to the Kingdom of God!

     Turn thy face to the Assembly of the Covenant and
[hear him] say:  "Salutations and praise be upon you,
the fragrances of God be upon you! for that by reason
of which ye have awakened from your sleep, arisen
from your negligence and heedlessness, aroused from
your couches, relied upon your Creator, depended upon
your Maker and been kindled with the fire burning in
the Spirit on Mt. Sinai and in the Heart of Mt. Paran

------------------------
1.  To the Itaca (N.Y.) assembly.
+P 528
- from this conflagration shall appear dazzling lights,
which shall shine upon all regions.
     "Consider the first century of the time of Christ -
glory be unto Him! - and the beginning of His Cause.
In that time no one but a certain few persons believed
in Him; and the great one among them was Peter the
disciple, who, through the burning of the fire of test
and persecution, was in great fear and denied Christ
three times; then the Jews who were scoffing, persecuting,
deriding and laughing at Him, despised Him as
through He were a thief, a murderer, or a villain, and
committed against Him that which made the hearts
lament, distressed the minds, caused tears to flow and
the foundations of existence to tremble and shake!  They
thought that they had quenched the Fire
which flamed in the tree of Christian certainty; nay,
verily, that Lamp hath diffused its dazzling rays unto
the Supreme Height and that Fire hath burned until it
kindled the hearts of the righteous!"
     "Then consider this day, and the day of His existence
among those people - how they crowned Him with
a diadem of thorns and now how thousands of people
adorn their heads in His name, with the Most Brilliant
Gem, glittering to the sight!  Woe, woe unto the like
of such heedless people!  Alas for the souls, because of
what they have committed against the Word of God
in the day of His Appearance - and today they worship
the dust which the feet of His Beloved have trod!
Such is the condition of the people.  Abandon them
and let them play until they fall in abasement and loss!
     "But as to you, O ye beloved of God, let your breasts

+P 529
be dilated with joy for that by reason of which ye have
attained unto the Day of God, entered the Kingdom
of God, and tasted the food of Knowledge which hath
descended from Heaven!"


O thou who art advancing toward the Kingdom of God!

     Thy letter was read; its contents had bearing upon
Guidance.  Praise be to God! thou possessed a perceiving
eye and an attentive ear!  Now is the time for
thee to give thanks to God with an expressive tongue;
to appreciate this bounty.
     Consider in what a great age thou hast stepped into
the world of existence and under the shadow of what
an Ensign of Guidance thou wert sheltered and attained
the hope and greatest desire of the saints!
     If thou dost arise to comply with that which is deemed
worthy of this favor and is a duty, thou shalt observe
that this Guidance is the crown of eternal sovereignty
and this attainment is everlasting glory, happiness and
the means of the forgiveness of sins and the lamp of
eternal life in the Kingdom of Heaven.


O thou who art witnessing the Light of Guidance!

     Verily I read thy excellent letter and praised God,
for He hath removed the veil (from thy sight), caused
the light of guidance to appear, filled for thee the cup
of bestowal and directed thee to His Kingdom.
     I supplicate God to increase thy faith, to encircle
thee with the lights of the Kingdom, and to guide thy
thirsting and craving sons to the Fountain-head of
Mercifulness.  And (I beg of Him) to enable thee

+P 530

III-530
to teach His truth, to deliver His Cause, to promote
His Word, and to train the souls whom superstitions
have veiled from witnessing the lights of the Bounty of
these days.
     O maid-servant of God!  Be filled with joy, so that
thine eyes may be overflowing with tears of happiness
and beatitude, and beseech thou God to remove the veil
from the face of your sons so that they may find a
spiritual understanding of the existence of God and
may know how the human soul can receive bounty from
the divine Spirit.

O thou kind maid-servant of God!

     Thy letter was like a perfumed nosegay and from
that nosegay the fragrance of faith and assurance was
inhaled.  Well done!  Well done! that thou hast turned
thy face toward the invisible Kingdom.  Excellent!
Excellent that thou art attracted to the Beauty of His
Highness the Almighty!  Well done!  Well done!
How happy thou art that thou hast attained to his
Most Great Gift!


O thou beloved maid-servant of God!

     Thank thou God that thou hast stepped into the arena
of existence in such a blessed Age and hast opened thine
ears and thine eyes in such a Promised Day.  The
Splendor of the Sun of Truth thou hast beheld and the
divine Call thou hast heard.  To thine ultimate desire
thou hast attained and from the sweetness of the
love of God thou hast tasted.  Consequently, supplicate
ardently for spiritual attraction and ecstacy.
     O thou beloved maid-servant of God!  If thou art

+P 531
not seeing dreams (and visions), be thou not sad.  Thou
are going to see, whilst thou art awake.  A wakeful eye
is acceptable in the Threshold of the Almighty.  Therefore,
I hope that thou wilt open the eye of thine insight,
travel in all the realms of God, see the splendor
of the Kingdom and behold the effulgence of the Realm
of Might.
     Show thou forth love and kindness on my behalf
toward thy dear husband and convey to him longing
greeting.  I supplicate from God in his behalf, and
invoke assistance and confirmation for you both.


O ye+F1 friends of Abdul-Baha!

     His honor Mr. ... wrote a letter and in
that letter he mentioned your names, asking divine
favor on your behalf.  While reading your names I
opened my tongue in thanksgiving in the Threshold of
Oneness, that he hath granted such favor and bestowed
such providence.  He guided the souls and pointed out
to them the entrance to the Kingdom.  Such confirmation
deserveth thanks and praise, and such guidance is
the most great bounty of His Highness the One.
     Likewise, you must be engaged day and night, with
all your soul and heart, in thanksgiving and the glorification
of His Highness the Desired One who hath created
you in such a glorious period, made you the manifestors
of guidance in the Day of the Lord, imparted to you
the insight and enkindled your souls and spirits with
the fire of love.  Today the grandeur, the majesty, the
splendor and the magnitude of this station is not clear
and manifest because it is the time of seed-sowing and

------------------------
1.  To the Montreal (Canada) assembly.
+P 532
the beginning of the planting of trees in the orchard
of the Merciful One.  When that seed is grown and
the tree reacheth the time of its fruition, then many
harvests shall be gathered and all regions and kingdoms
shall be adorned with its blossoms and fruits.
     Ere long the Adored One of this providence will
become the Beloved of the assemblages of the world
and the rays of the Sun of Truth will illumine every
house, every place and corner.  At that time the greatness
and superiority of the friends of God will become
evident and demonstrated.
     Consider ye!  In the day of His Highness Christ,
the grandeur and majesty of their Holiness the Apostles,
was not known.  After three-hundred years the loftiness
of the station and the exaltation of their attainment
became manifest.  Ere long the result of the
deeds in this cycle of Baha'o'llah will appear and
every one of the friends and the maid-servants will be
crowned with a diadem whose splendid gems will
radiate brilliancy and effulgence throughout cycles and
ages.
     Therefore, O ye servants of God and the maid-servants
of the Merciful One, do ye not rest for one
moment!  Do ye not seek any composure!  Do ye not
wish for any rest and ease!  Endeavor and make ye an
effort with all your heart and soul to spread the fragrances
of Paradise, to raise the eternal melody of
the Kingdom of Abha, to establish the gathering of
fellowship, to become assisted with the confirmations of
the Holy Spirit; to clothe the temple of existence with
a new garment; to bestow eternal life upon the reality
of souls; to become a cause of the civilization of the

+P 533
human world; to characterize the bloodthirsty animals
with the heavenly attributes and divine commemorations;
to pacify the world with peace and salvation,
and to adorn man with the favors of His Highness
the Merciful One; that perchance ignorance, animosity
and strangeness may be removed entirely from among
the denizens of the world, and the Banner of Reconciliation,
Freedom, Nobleness and Oneness be hoisted;
for the chains of existence contain countless links, each
connected with the other.  This connection is the cause
of the appearance of the invisible powers in the world
of the visible.
     O ye real friends!  Make ye an effort that this universe
may become another universe and this darkened world
find a ray of the Sun of Truth and become luminous
and refulgent.
     I entreat God that this favor may be realized and
this unending outpouring become manifest and apparent,
and the friends of God be confirmed by every
bounty.


O ye+F1 blessed souls!

     On the night of the feast ye entertained the beloved
and were occupied in the service of the friends of God
and the maid-servants of the Merciful One.  Service
to the sons and the daughters of the Kingdom is the
diadem of everlasting glory with which ye have crowned
your heads, the garment of eternal sovereignty with
which ye have adorned your bodies, and the throne of
majesty and grandeur of heaven upon which ye sat.
Abdul-Baha found the utmost rejoicing from that feast

1.  To a family.
+P 534
and he was a host in his heart and soul, praying and
entreating at the Threshold of Oneness that the breaths
of the Holy Spirit waft, the angels of mercy descend
and the confirmations of the Kingdom of Abha surround
you upon all sides.
     Rest ye assured that ye will become illumined,
spiritual and celestial, and your services were accepted
and praised at the Threshold of Oneness.


O ye two+F1 kind and beloved maid-servants of God!

     A splendour from the Supper of the Lord was cast
upon the table that ye have spread and the spiritual
food descended.  It was on this account that the souls
were rejoicing and happy and the spirits of those who
were present were uplifted.  The soul and heart of
Abdul-Baha was present and manifest.  What a happy
night that was, and what a blessed feast!  It became
conducive to the happiness of the people of the Supreme
Concourse, and the cause of joy and bliss to the inhabitants
of the Kingdom of Abha.  I beg of God
that He may assist and confirm you so that ye may bring
about such feasts.


O thou who art attracted to the Kingdom of God!

     Be thou thankful and grateful to the favored maid-servant
..., for she became the cause of thy
utmost joy and bliss; she delivered thee from the narrow
way of doubts and imaginations and ushered thee
into the delectable meadow of happiness and beatitude.
She led thee from the inferior world to the exalted
realm of divinity; she took thee away from darkness

and guided thee to light, and while thou hast been deprived,
she made thee confident of the mysteries of the
Kingdom.
     I supplicate God that the coverings may be removed,
the Beauty of Truth become apparent and evident; in
order that thou mayest be taught in the wisdom of God,
become a great teacher in the world of humanity and
all thy desires be attained.***


O thou seeker of the Kingdom!

     The letter was received and I became acquainted
with its contents.
     The Cause of Baha'o'llah is the same as the Cause
of Christ.  It is the same Temple and the same Foundation.
Both of these are spiritual springtimes and
seasons of the soul-refreshing awakening and the cause
of the renovation of the life of mankind.  The spring
of this year is the same as the spring of last year.  The
origins and ends are the same.  The sun of today is
the sun of yesterday.  In the coming of Christ, the
divine teachings were given in accordance with the infancy
of the human race.  The teachings of Baha'o'llah
have the same basic principles, but are according
to the stage of the maturity of the world and the
requirements of this illumined age.
     O thou seeker of the Kingdom!  Make thou an
effort so that thou mayest partake from the spiritual
Supper of the Lord.  At that time every difficulty will
become easy, and every trouble will be conducive to the
tranquility of the heart and soul.
     I supplicate God that thy spiritual sight be opened
so that thou mayest behold the mysteries of the Kingdom

+P 536
and become the cause of ease, adornment, reconciliation,
faithfulness and uprightness in the human
world.


O thou who art guided by the Light of Guidance!

     The material world is gloomy.  Praise be to God!
thou hast been led to the illumined realm.  Darkness
hath environed all the inhabitants of the globe, but
thou hast found guidance.  The souls are dead; thou
hast been quickened through the Spirit of Truth.  The
eyes are blind; thine eyes became bright by beholding
the lights.  The ears are deaf; thou hast heard the voice
of the Merciful One.
     Thou must express the utmost satisfaction and thanks
to Mrs. ..., for she hath guided thee and
beckoned thee to the everlasting universe.  For thee she
desired perpetual glory and for thee she asked life
eternal.  Therefore strive in order that in the divine
vineyard thou mayest become a gardener of Truth and
live with such deeds and words that thou mayest become
the cause of the enlightenment of the world.


O thou wooer of Truth and attracted one toward the Kingdom of God!

     Thy detailed letter was received and its reading produced
the utmost joy, for it was a glorious proof of
the loftiness of thy aim and the exaltation of thine intention.
Praise be to God! that thou art the well-wisher
of the human world, art attracted to the Kingdom of
Abha and art aspiring for the advancement of the
realm of humanity.  I hope that, through the instrumentality
of these lofty thoughts, attractions of

+P 537
heart and heavenly glad-tidings, thou mayest become
so illumined that, through the mildly beaming splendor
of the love of God, thou mayest shine and gleam
throughout centuries and cycles.
     Thou hast written that thou art a student in the progressive
spiritual school.  Happy is thy condition!  If
the various progressive schools join themselves to the
universal university of the Kingdom, such knowledge
and sciences will be brought into light that man will see
that the potentialities of the "Open Tablet" of existence
are infinite; will realize that all the created
things are as letters and words; will be instructed in
the lessons of the degrees of significances; will perceive
the signs of oneness in the primordial atoms of the
earth; will hear the voice of the Lord of the Kingdom;
will behold the confirmations of the Holy Spirit and
will find such ecstasy and joy that, being unable to contain
himself in the vast area of existence, he will prepare
himself for the journey toward the Kingdom and
will hasten to the immensity of the Realm of Might.
As soon as a bird if fledged, it cannot keep itself on the
ground; nay, rather it soareth up toward the Supreme
Apex - except the birds whose feet are tied, whose
wings are clipped and feathers broken and who are
soiled with water and clay.
     O thou seeker of Truth!  The realm of the Kingdom
is a unit.  The only difference lies in this:  That when
the season of spring dawneth, a new and wonderful
motion and rejuvenation is witnessed in all the existing
things; the mountains and meadows are revived; the
trees find freshness and delicacy and are clothed with
radiant and bright leaves, blossoms and fruits.  In a

+P 538
like manner the preceding Manifestations form an inseparable
link with the subsequent dispensations; nay,
rather they are identical with each other.  Since the
world is constantly developing itself, the rays become
stronger, the outpouring becometh greater and the sun
appeareth in the meridian orbit.
     O thou yearner after the Kingdom!  Each Manifestations
is the heart of the world and the proficient Physician
of every patient.  The world of humanity is sick,
but that skilled Physician hath the healing remedy and
He bestoweth divine teachings, exhortations and advices
which are the remedy of every ailment and the dressing
for every wound.  Undoubtedly, the wise physician
discovereth the needs of the patient at every season
and prescribeth medicine.  Therefore, when thou
wilt compare the teachings of the Beauty of Abha with
the requisitions and necessities of the present time, thou
wilt conclude that they are to the sick body of the world
the swift healing antidote; nay, rather they are the
remedy of everlasting health.  The prescription of the
proficient physicians of the past and the future will
not be the same; nay, rather they will be in accord with
the ailment of the patient.  Although the medicine is
changed, yet all of these are for the sole purpose of
the healing of the sick.  In former dispensations the
sick body of the world could not bear the strong and
overpowering remedies.  That is why His Highness the
Christ said:  "I have yet many things to say unto you,
but ye cannot bear them now.  Howbeit, when He, the
Spirit of the Comforter, who is sent by the Father, is
come, He will guide you into all truth."  Therefore, in
this age of lights, specific teachings have become universal,

+P 539
in order that the outpouring of the Merciful One
environ both the East and the West, the oneness of the
Kingdom of humanity become visible and the luminosity
of truth enlighten the world of consciousness.  The
descent of the New Jerusalem is the heavenly religion
which secures the prosperity of the human world and is
the effulgence of the illumination of the realm of God.
In reality Emmanuel was the forerunner of the second
coming of His Highness the Christ and the herald of
the path of the Kingdom.
     This is self-evident that the letter is an organic member
of the word.  This membership denotes subordination;
that is, the letter draws its life from the word and
hath spiritual relationship with it and is accounted a
part of it.  The apostles were the Letters and His
Highness Christ the Essence of the Word; and the
significance of the Word, which is the Everlasting Outpouring,
cast a splendor upon those Letters,.  Since a
Letter is a part of the Word itself, it is intrinsically
identical with the Word.
     I hope that thou shalt arise to perform all that which
His Highness Emmanuel hath predicted.  Know thou
this of a certainty that thou shalt become assisted.  The
confirmations of the Holy Spirit are descending uninterruptedly.
The power of the Word shall penetrate
in such wise that the Letter will become the reflective
mirror of the Sun of the Word, and the radiation of the
lights of the Word shall illumine the whole earth.
But the heavenly Jerusalem, which is established upon
the Apex of the world and the Holy of Holies of the
Almighty, which hath hoisted its banner, comprehendeth
and includeth in it all the perfections and teachings of

+P 540
the former dispensations.  Likewise, it is the herald
of the oneness of the world of humanity, the ensign of
universal peace, the spirit of eternal life, the lights of
divine perfections, the surrounding bestowal of the
realm of existence, the adornment and grandeur of the
world of creation and the cause of the tranquility of
human-kind.
     Turn thy attention toward the holy Tablets.  Read
and reflect upon the Tablets of Ishraghat, Tajalliat,
the Words of Paradise, the Glad-tidings, Tarazat and
the Book of Akdas.+F1  These divine teachings in this
day are the remedy of the ailments of the world of man
and the dressing for the wounded body of existence;
they are the Spirit of Life, the Ark of Salvation, the
Magnet of the Everlasting Glory and the penetrative
power in the reality of man!


O thou dear wise man!

     They letter *** was considered.  Its contents were
in the utmost of beauty and great joy was realized
therefrom.
     Thou hast asked "Is it possible that this new and
living Cause is to take the place of the dead religion
of England when there hath been organized certain
sects who have arrived at high stations of spiritual
knowledge and to exalted degrees of merciful powers,
and have become distinguished in virtue from all predecessors;
notwithstanding this, is it possible that this
new Cause will attract the attention of such people to
such a degree as to unite their hearts, and gather them
under its over-shadowing protection?"

------------------------
1.  All revealed by Baha'o'llah.
+P 541
     O thou dear friend!  Know thou that the Distinguished
Individual of every age is according to the
virtues of that age.  The Distinguished Personage who
was in the former cycle, His power and virtues were
according to the former age, but in this brilliant age
and divine cycle, the Noble Personage, the Radiant
Star, the Distinguished One, will manifest with virtues
which will eventually amaze the peoples, for He is in
spiritual virtues and divine perfections loftier than all
the Individuals; any, rather He is the Source of Divine
Benediction and the Center of the Radiant Circle.  He
is certainly comprehensive.  There is no doubt that
He will reveal Himself to such a degree as to bring
all under His over-shadowing shelter.
     When thou considerest carefully thou wilt find this
order and system to be established in all things.  The
whole attracted the part, and the center of the circle
is the axis of the compass.  Consider His Holiness the
Spirit (Christ):  Since He was the Center of spiritual
power and the Origin of divine benediction, although
in the beginning He gathered but few under His power,
yet later through that conquering power, He ushered
all sects under the shadow of the Christian tabernacle.
Compare the present with the past, see the great difference.
By this thou canst measure and reach the
reality and know for a certainty that the difference
among the sects of the world is due to the difference
of comprehensions.  As long as the perceptive powers
differ, surely the opinions and thoughts also differ.  But
if One Great Perceptive Power which comprehendeth
all, cometh to the Center, the differing opinions become
united, and ideal unity and oneness are revealed.

+P 542
     For example:  When His Holiness, the Spirit (Jesus
Christ) appeared, the comprehensions of the creatures,
the susceptibilities and minds of the sects then present,
such as the Romans, the Greeks, Assyrians and Israelites
were different.  When the universal power of the Spirit
of God appeared in the Center, eventually after three-hundred
years, all the differing minds gathered under
the protection of One Center.  The same spiritual
susceptibilities were attained.
     For the sake of illustration (literally, likeness), I
will say:  When an army is under the command of
generals who have differing opinions, certainly it will
disagree in regard to maneuvers and in the order of
marching to the battlefields.  But when the great commander-in-chief
who is expert in the arts of warfare
cometh to the front, all the differing opinions will be
erased and one opinion will prevail; the commander-in-chief
will bring all under his own direction.  This
is an instance and not a likeness.
     Now if thou shouldest say, the generals of this army
are every one artists in the art of warfare, expert and
experienced, why should they obey one person, even
though he may have accomplished a great feat - this
saying does not deserve attention, for this matter is
certain and there is no doubt therein.
     Likewise the Holy Manifestations, especially the
reality of the Greatest Name, the Beauty of Abha,
when unveiled amid the assemblage of the world, like
unto Joseph of Canaan, in the divine Egypt, will appear
with such Beauty and Sweetness as to make the
lovers of the world His captives.

+P 543
     As to the souls who are born into this world radiant
entities and who through excessive difficulty are deprived
of great benefits and thus leave the world - they
are worthy of all sympathy, for in reality this is worthy
of regret.  It is for this purpose (that is, it is with regard
to this wisdom) that the great Manifestations
(of God) unveil themselves in this world, bear every
difficulty and ordeal - to make these ready souls dawnings
of light and confer upon them eternal life.  This
is the real atonement that His Holiness Christ made -
He sacrificed Himself for the life of the world.
     As to the question that the holy and spiritual souls
influence, help and guide the creatures after they have
cast off this elemental mould - this is an established
truth of the Bahais.  Nay even the Holy Manifestations
of God extend a great Bounty and an evident
Light after their ascent from this world.  For His
Holiness Christ there was more and greater promotion
of the Word, manifestation of divine power, conversion
of holy souls, and the giving of eternal life, after [His]
martyrdom.  Likewise for the Blessed Beauty (Baha'o'llah)
there was greater bounty and dawning of
light, manifestation of divine power, and effectiveness
of the Word after His Ascent; and ere long the Sun of
His Reality will encircle the world with its motion, heat,
radiation and bounty.
     Be not sorry on account of the limited extent of the
progress of the Bahai Cause in that country+F1 .  This is
the beginning of the dawn.  Consider the Cause of His
Holiness Christ, which took three-hundred years to
produce great effect.  Now sixty years have not passed

------------------------
1.  England.
+P 544
since the beginning of this Cause, and Its Lights are
shed upon all horizons.
     Regarding the Society for healing of which thou art
of a member; when it comes under the protection of
this Cause, its power will be an hundred fold.
     Thou hast observed how extensive is the love of the
Bahais and that the foundation is love.  As the power
of love among the Bahais is in the utmost degree and
superior to that in other religions, it is even the same
in other relations, for the cause of all is Love.
     As to the question of translating the Books and
Tablets of the Blessed Beauty; it will soon be done in
all languages with the utmost of eloquence and excellence.
When the Tablets of His Holiness (Baha'o'llah)
are translated in accordance with the original,
with excellence and eloquence, then the Lights of Significances
will dawn and brighten all the eyes.  Endeavor
thou with all thy power to make the translation as the
original.
     The Blessed Beauty went to Haifa many times, and
thou hast seen Him.+F1  I hope thou mayest attain the
real meeting and that is the witnessing with the eye of
insight and not of sight.
     The essence of the teachings of His Holiness Baha'o'llah
is Universal Love, which comprehendeth all
the virtues of the world of humanity, is the cause of
eternal life and of the progress of all the individuals
of the human race.  Soon thou wilt see that these

------------------------
1.  While in Haifa, some years ago, before he became a believer, the recipient
    of this Tablet saw Baha'o'llah and some of the followers and was
    attracted to Him, but owing to circumstances had no means of communicating
    with Him at that time.
+P 545
heavenly teachings, like unto the light of reality, will
envelope and enlighten the world.
     The short prayer which thou hast written at the
end of thy letter is in reality original, beautiful, sweet
and effective.  Chant it always.


O thou esteemed maid-servant of God!

     Be thou hopeful and be thou happy and rejoiced.
For I have supplicated and beseeched before the Threshold
of the Almighty that thy wish may be realized,
so thou mayest overcome the self and perform charitable
deeds and that the human perfections may appear from
thee; that thou mayest be endowed with lofty gifts;
find thy way to divine wisdom and show forth the manners
and conduct of those who are favored in the
Threshold of the Almighty.
     The essence of all exhortation is that thou shouldst
abandon thyself and sacrifice life, body and heart for
the Beloved One of the world.


O thou servant of God!

     Thy letter was received and the sign of the hand
was observed.  This sign was a mystery of the perfection
of Love.  I ask God that it may become realized,
and day by day, thou mayest walk more and more in
the path of the Kingdom, in order that thou mayest be
freed from the strangers and friends, be disengaged
from attachment to the material world and be attached
wholly to the divine Kingdom.  At that time thou wilt
behold the lights of the most great gift.

+P 546
O thou maid-servant of God!

     Thy poetry was received.  The context was elegant.
The words were eloquent and the theme, the Manifest
Light.  Consequently, it was highly appreciated.  Endeavor,
so far as it is possible for thee, that day by day
thou mayest string the pearls of poesy with sweeter
rhythm and more eloquent contents, in order that it
may become conducive to the perpetuity of thy name
in the spiritual meetings.  Upon thee be greeting and
praise!


O thou servant of God!

     What thou hast written was perused.  Be thou rejoiced
on account of hearing the glad-tidings of the
Kingdom.  To render thanks for such a bounty is to
show forth praiseworthy deeds.
     Sacrifice thyself for the well-being of the people and
be thou a kind comforter to all the inhabitants of the
world.  Ask and pray to God that thou mayest become
an enkindled lamp, to shed light upon the assembly,
to become a lover of men and a well-wisher of human
kind; nay, rather, thou mayest become the manifestation
of the divine providence, finding out the heavenly
gifts, enlisting thyself among the soldiers of the kingdom
of peace and reconciliation, delivering the people
as far as possible from war and carnage, spreading
righteousness and friendship and becoming the cause of
tranquility and composure to the world of humanity.


O thou seeker after Truth!

     The letter which thou hast written to ...
was received and its contents became known.  If thou


+P 547
ask my name and title, it is Abdul-Baha and any name
beside this is unknown here.  Whosoever calleth me by
this name, accept from him - otherwise reject.
     But about the three questions which thou hast asked
for thyself:  The first is true.  Undoubtedly, when a
soul engages in commemoration of the True One, he
will naturally feel the rest of soul and tranquility of
heart.
     The second question about the supernatural power:
Without advancing toward the Kingdom of Abha, it
is impossible and inaccessible.  But should a soul enter
under the shadow of the Blessed Perfection, step into
the divine Kingdom, act according to the councils and
exhortations of God and practice the New Teachings,
unquestionably he will become endowed with a supernatural
power.
     But about thy third question:  "Have I been subjected
to such troubles and vicissitudes before?" and
the indisputable answer, "No!" - this is also true.
     For any soul who walketh in the path of guidance,
there is no doubt he shall endure hardships.  Consider
thou their Highness the Apostles; likewise the Assembly
of Christians, who were sanctified souls; what
calamities and persecutions hailed them in the Cause
during the first and second century and even up to the
third century!
     Look thou around the world of existence:  A little
worldly transaction cannot be brought about except
through surmounting many an obstacle.  How much
more important are the objects of the Supreme World!
Certainly there existeth troubles, trials, afflictions, persecution,
censure and contempt.  When thou didst occupy


+P 548
thy time in the past to give out religious exhortations
and advices, thou experienced some persecutions and
trouble.  But thou canst not realize in this present
moment what great ordeals are in store and what unbearable
calamities, affliction and adversity exist, and
that to give up life is the easiest of all those calamities.
But the end of all these is bliss, overflowing joy, everlasting
exultation, happiness and supreme contentment.
it is eternal life, never ending glory, a lordly gift and
divine sovereignty!
     In brief, thou hast asked concerning my desire for
thee:  I wish, if thou art worldly, to become heavenly;
if thou art of the world of possession, become thou
celestial; if thou art of the material sphere, become an
inhabitant of the realm of Light; hasten from the world
of darkness to the world of illumination and become the
manifestor of the exhortations, advices and instructions
of the Blessed Perfection.  This is my greatest desire
for thee.


O ye+F1 seekers of Truth!
     Your letter was received and its contents became
known.  The new Kingdom hath raised its tents in all
regions and hath enveloped East and West, but the
blind ones cannot see and the deaf ones cannot hear.  In
the time of Christ, the doors of the divine Kingdom
were opened, but the people, being veiled, were negligent
and in a deep sleep.  Therefore, they were deprived
of the spiritual glory.  Now, thank ye God that
ye have found the way to the Kingdom of peace and
salvation and have heard the call of the True One.


------------------------
1.  Husband and wife.
+P 549
     Supplicate God that ye may become heavenly hosts,
spreading the oneness of the world of humanity, taking
in hand the armor of peace and conquering the hearts
with the sword of love.
     Ye are people of the earth, become ye angels of
heaven; ye are from the West, draw ye bounties from
the East!  Be ye illumined, become ye heavenly, become
ye merciful and show kindness to all the people!


O thou dear friend!

     Although a person of good deeds is acceptable at
the Threshold of the Almighty, yet it is first "to know,"
and then "to do."  Although a blind man produceth
a most wonderful and exquisite art, yet he is deprived
of seeing it.  consider how most animals labor for
man, draw loads and facilitate travel; yet, as they are
ignorant, they receive no reward for this toil and labor.
The cloud raineth, roses and hyacinths grow; the plain
and meadow, the garden and trees become green and
blossom; yet they do not realize the results and outcome
of all these.  The lamp is lighted, but as it hath not a
conscious knowledge of itself, no one hath become glad
because of it.  Moreover, a soul of excellent deeds and
good manners will undoubtedly advance from whatever
horizon he beholdeth the lights radiating.  Herein
lies the difference:  By faith is meant, first, conscious
knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds.
     Thou hast asked concerning reincarnation:  Reincarnation
as understood by the people, is untrue; but in
the Gospel, "return" is referred to, and that is the return
of qualities+F1 and not the return of entities.  This


------------------------
1.  i.e., the return of the qualities, powers and attributes in another
    human being.
+P 550
matter is explained in detail in the Book of Ighan,
which is translated and published.  Study that Book.
     But the difference between Christ and others is this:
Christ was the Spirit, others were bodies; Christ was
the Sun, others were mirrors; Christ was the Truth and
was bestowing eternal life, others were dead and imparting
deadness and negligence.
     Thou hast asked concerning the spirits of men:  They
are not at all annihilated - they are immortal.+F1  The
spirits of heavenly souls will find eternal life, that is,
they will attain the highest and most great stations
of perfection; but the spirits of the heedless souls, although
they are eternal, yet they are in a world of
imperfection, concealment and ignorance.  This is a
concise answer.  Contemplate and meditate upon it, in
order that thou mayest comprehend the reality of the
mysteries in detail.  for instance:  No matter how
much the mineral has an existence and life, yet in comparison
to man, it is entirely non-existent and deprived
of life.  For where man is translated from life to
death, his comparative station will be that of a mineral
existence.


O ye+F2 seekers of Truth!

     Your letter was received and a sweet fragrance was
inhaled from the rose-garden of its significances.  it
was an evidence of your insight, hearing and spiritual
life.  For, no matter if the people are living in appearance,
yet they may be dead in reality.  That is why His
Holiness Christ, sayeth in the gospels:  "Let the dead
bury the dead!"


------------------------
1.  i.e., in the sense of continued existence after the death of the body.
2.  Husband and wife.
+P 551
     Praise be to God! that you have found eternal life
from among the dead; that is, you have hear the call
of the divine Kingdom, are attracted to the Heavenly
Countenance and have turned your faces toward the
Center of the Light of Truth.  I hope that you continue
to be a living, eternal light!
     Two stones of the Most Great Name are sent enclosed
with this Tablet.


O thou Glorious Lord!+F1

     Make thou this little maid-servant a brilliant-starred
daughter of the Kingdom; endear her in the Threshold
of Oneness and overflow her with the cup of Thy love,
in order that she may raise the cries of joy and ecstasy
and mix ambergris with musk.+F2
     Verily, Thou art the Powerful and the Mighty, and
Thou art the Wise, the Seer!


O thou plant of the Garden of the Love of God!

     Thy letter was received.  Its content was of utmost
grace and sweetness.  As thou hast turned thy face
toward the Supreme Kingdom, I hope thy disposition
and nature will prove agreeable and comforting to thy
brother and sister.
     Although thou art small, yet I hope thou wilt become
great in the Kingdom.  His Highness Christ, sayeth:
"Happy is the condition of the children!"  God willing,
thou art one of those children.
     Be obedient and kind to thy father and mother,
caressing brother and sister, and day by day adding to
thy faith and assurance.

1.  This Tablet bore the following heading:  "Chant thou this commune."
2.  This metaphor means the state of spontaneous prayer and communion
    with God.
+P 552
O thou dear friend!

     What thou hast written was perused.  Thank thou
God that the doors of the Kingdom are opened and
the way of the Truth become manifest and evident.
Therefore, enter thou completely into this divine Kingdom;
that is, acquire heavenly bliss and beatitude and
turn thy face to the Luminous Realm, so that the hurtful
powers may be dispersed at once, eternal felicity,
composure and tranquility become realized, the heart
find glad-tidings, the soul, peace, and even the body,
grace and beauty.


O thou faithful one!

     One of the requirements of faithfulness is that thou
mayest sacrifice thyself and, in the divine path, close
thine eye to every pleasure and strive with all thy soul
that thou mayest disappear and be lost, like unto a drop,
in the ocean of the love of God.


O thou who art advanced toward God!

     Thy letter was received.  Its contents indicated that
thou hast become alive through the spiritual breaths of
his honor, Mr. .........  Thank thou God that
thou hast attained to this bounty and hast caught the
light of guidance.  Thou must be thankful to his honor,
Mr. ........., to the end of thy days, for from
his hand thou hast drunk this overflowing cup of the
Most Great Guidance.
     Now show thou forth firmness and steadfastness without
wavering.  If any test fall upon thee, it will be
conducive to the strength of thy faith.


+P 553
O thou servant of the True One!

     Thy letter was received.  The meeting *** which
was arranged with the utmost union in the studio of
Miss ......... was in reality spiritual, merciful
and illumined.  The friends of God were associating
with great harmony and friendship.  I hope that all the
people of the world become united and cemented.  The
Blessed Perfection hath appeared for the sole purpose
of the unification and solidarity of the people of the
world, so that all of them may enter under the shade
of one tree, sing one melody in one rose-garden and
adorn the universe with love and oneness.
     Every meeting which is organized for the purpose
of unity and concord will be conducive to changing
strangers into friends, enemies into associated, and
Abdul-Baha will be present in his heart and soul with
that meeting.
     I entreat from God that the believers may at all
times strive to bring about union and harmony, in order
that this power of unity may display an effect in this
world; each country become illuminated, the darkness
of foreignness be dispelled gradually and the light of
unanimity dawn and shed its rays to all parts.


O thou heavenly one!

     Organize ye spiritual assemblies; lay ye the foundation
of union and concord in this world; destroy ye the
fabric of strife and war from the face of the earth;
construct ye the temple of harmony and agreement;
enkindle ye the light of the realm of the oneness of
humanity; open ye your eyes; gaze and behold ye the
other world!  The Kingdom of peace, salvation, uprightness


+P 554
and reconciliation is founded in the Invisible
World, and it will by degrees become manifest and
apparent through the power of the Word of God!
     I supplicate God that ye may become the army of
that Kingdom, in order that by the power of the Most
Great Name, the friends of God may conquer this world
through love, friendship and the strength of the Kingdom
of peace; the human race become compassionate,
and bloodshed and carnage be completely effaced from
the universe.
     The Spirit of truth is soaring on the Supreme Apex,
like unto a bird, in order that it may discover a severed
heart and alight therein and make its nest.
     I hope that all the friends become manifestors of
knowledge and the centers of merciful feelings.  Each
of them become like unto an angel and radiate heavenly
deeds, thoughts and actions.


O thou who art attracted to the Kingdom!

     Thy letter contained meanings full of sweetness.  I
therefore took it in my hand with the utmost love and
became informed of thy desire.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Glad-tidings be unto
thee!  As thou art faithful and art going to remain
firm, the favors of the Bounty of Abha will encircle
thee; thou wilt become a cause of the illumination of
the human world, and be assisted by the heavenly confirmation.


O ye spiritual assembly!+F1

     As ye were gathered in the meeting of hospitality
with the utmost longing for the knowledge of God, that

+P 555
meeting was mentioned in the divine Kingdom and
you became favored with special bounty.  Such gatherings
are very praiseworthy and acceptable, for all beget
joy and fragrance, the hearts become illumined and the
despondent souls become heavenly.
     Likewise, thou I was remote in so far as the body
is concerned, I was near to the friends in heart and
spirit and close to the believers in that assembly.
     I entreat God that your assembly wax greater day
by day and the meeting of the love of God become
adorned with celestial attributes, so that the confirmation
of the Kingdom of God descend continually.


O ye friends!+F1

     Thank God that the Light of Truth shone in that
city, the bounty of guidance was granted, the fire of the
love of God was ignited and the veil of superstition was
burned away.
     Some souls have arisen who have unsealed their eyes,
unstopped their ears, witnessed the great signs and
heard the eternal melody of the Supreme Concourse.
Each of them became a faithful tree in the orchard of
the love of God and a shining luminous star in the
horizon of the knowledge of God.  this is from the
eternal bounty and the everlasting gift.
     I entreat and supplicate in the Threshold of the
Almighty and ask for your confirmation and assistance,
that you may be born wholly out of the physical world
into the Realm Divine, to seek after the eternal life
and wish for the everlasting gift, so that you may
shine upon ages and cycles like unto the morning star!

+P 556
O thou lamp of the Love of God!

     Thou hast made the wish for the great martyrdom
in the path of Baha', that thou mayest become intoxicated
with that overflowing cup and sacrifice this
ephemeral life upon the divine altar, in order that thou
mayest walk in the road of faithfulness and show forth
firmness and steadfastness for the sake of the love of
Baha'.
     This is the ultimate desire of the people of sanctity.
If the eternal prosperity favor and befriend thee, thou
wilt undoubtedly attain to this bounty.  But for the
present this very attitude is sacrifice and martyrdom.
Blessed art thou, and again, blessed art thou!***


O thou daughter of the Kingdom!

     Thy letter was received; its contents were of the
utmost sweetness.  No sooner had I heard it, than I
supplicated to God in thy behalf that thou mayest become
a strong growing tree, protected and guarded
from the winds of tests and attain to heavenly
guidance.
     Know thou the value of Miss .........  Truly
I say, she was an angel of heaven and a light beaming
and sparkling.  Endear thy beloved daughter, ........
Entreat God that she and  ......... may become
two shining lamps in the assemblage of the world and
the cause of the grandeur and promotion of the divine
teachings.
     Blessing be upon thy dear son ......... and his
family.  Endeavor thou in their training.
     Convey on my behalf, spiritual greeting to the new
bridegroom and bride ......... and say to them:


+P 557
"You must become the young trees in the divine garden
and produce good fruits."
     Convey my love to ......... I prayed in behalf
of all the family that they may be confirmed with
the most great guidance and sacrifice their abilities,
talents and possessions in the Path of God.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  This celestial music
hath moved the hearts of the people in the world and
the Blessed Tree embraced all communities and nations
under its shade!


O thou who art attracted toward the Kingdom!

     Be thou not unhappy; the tempest of sorrow shall
pass; regret will not last; disappointment will vanish;
the fire of the love of God will become enkindled, and
the thorns and briars of sadness and despondency will
be consumed!  Be thou happy; rest thou assured upon
the favors of Baha', so that uncertainty and hesitation
may become non-existent and the invisible outpourings
descend upon the arena of being!
     If thou art seeking after spiritual tranquility, turn
thy face at all times toward the Kingdom of Abha.
If thou art desiring divine joy, free thyself from the
bands of attachment.  if thou art wishing for the confirmation
of the Holy Spirit, become thou engaged in
teaching the Cause of God.
     If the friends and relatives are keeping themselves
at a distance from thee, be thou not sad, for God is near
to thee.  Associate thou, as much as thou canst, with
the relatives and strangers; display thou loving kindness;
show thou forth the utmost patience and resignation.
The more they oppose thee, shower thou upon


+P 558
them the greater justice and equity; the more they
show hatred and opposition toward thee, challenge thou
them with great truthfulness, friendship and reconciliation.
     Praise be to God, thou art near to the Kingdom of
Abha!  Rest thou assured.  With all my soul and
spirit, I am thy companion at all moments.  Know thou
this of a certainty!
     I prayed in behalf of thy relatives and family, supplicating
from God confirmation and assistance for them.


O ye+F1 friends of Abdul-Baha!

     The glad-tidings of your attraction and enkindlement,
ecstasy and exhilaration, hath reached us before
and a special Rablet hath been forwarded to you.  Mr.
......... and Mr. ......... arrived and praised
you with the utmost enthusiasm, that "the friends of
Hoboken are firm, steadfast and eloquent (in delivering
the Truth)."  In that region they have adorned a
meeting with the fragrances of holiness and organized
an assembly like unto the delectable paradise.  Each
one of them is like unto a lamp brilliant with the light
of guidance and a conquering host invincible with the
power of the love of god.  Likewise, they gave the
utmost praise to  all the beloved throughout the regions
of America, and they were extremely happy and grateful.
They praised and commended highly the spiritual
assembly of New York, saying that day and night they
were engaged in the service of the Kingdom; likewise
they were very grateful to Mr. .........
     Briefly, four days and four nights were they the

+P 559
guests in the house of this imprisoned one, continually
praising and commending the beloved of God and giving
the glad-tidings of the attraction of the friends with
the fragrances of God.  In this prison, Abdul-Baha hath
no happiness except the arrival of the good news of the
believers.  Whenever one praises them, the heart is
dilated and the soul is rejoiced.
     Therefore, O ye companions of Abdul-Baha, display
ye an effort, so that ye may make that region (America)
the Paradise of Abha, hoisting the banner of the
Most Great Peace and spreading the teachings of the
Beauty of Abha; in order that the slumbrous world
become awakened, the unconscious become mindful, the
universe become another universe, the human world become
the realm of the Kingdom, earthly emotions become
heavenly attractions, cruelty and oppression be
changed into love and faithfulness, the clattering of the
sword be transformed into the sweet melody of the pen
and the discordant sound of war become the wonderful
song of love and intelligence; in order that all the
individuals of humanity embrace each other and live
among themselves in perfect love and affinity.


+F1 O thou who hast addressed Abdul-Baha!

     Verily, I pray my Lord to teach thee a language and
writing of the Kingdom which will satisfy thee, so as to
dispense with all things; for that spiritual writing and
instructive tongue are eloquent, clear, laudable, legible,
read by the tongue and preserved in the heart.  Blessed
is he who knows it in the world of man!

1.  The following four Tablets are addressed to a Japanese residing in the
    United States.
+P 560
     Know, verily, that the Ocean is waving, the Sun
shining, the Stars dawning.  (Understand what I say!)
     The tree will grow, the earth will send forth
hyacinths+F1 and give blessings, and man will become of
the heavenly angels.  Feed on the light of guidance and
impart light to the people.  The bird will warble
melodies unknown save by the birds of heaven; then tear
asunder the veil and see the realities of things with the
eye of God.  Verily, thy Lord guideth whomsoever He
willeth unto the Straight Path!
     The Promised Spot will be made a racecourse for
the steeds of the race of Knowledge and the lights of
the Merciful will shine upon it.  The dispersed ones
will return to the Center of Gathering and the birds
will return from the meadows of the world unto the
Nest of Harmony.  This is a preordained matter.
     As to thee:  Thou hast borne every difficulty and
hardship and soon will be rewarded by God with a good
reward.  He will destine to thee all that is good, and
choose for thee the manifestation of His mercy among
the servants; that they may thus see that the Sons of the
Kingdom have gone out+F2 , while there hath come a soul
from the remotest horizon who hath entreated the
Kingdom of God.***


O thou who art the single one of Japan and the unique
     one of the extreme Orient!

     That country hath been deprived of the divine breath
until this time; now, God be praised! thou art initiated

in the mysteries and conscious of the secrets of the
lights.
     Thou hast been earthly, I hope that thou wilt become
heavenly; thou hast been gloomy, I desire that thou
wilt become luminous.  Thou wert wandering in the
wilderness, thou hast found a way to the abode of the
Beloved One; thou wert a thirsty fish, thou hast attained
to the endless Ocean; thou wert a roving bird,
thou hast reached the divine Rose-garden; thou wert
spiritually sick and thou hast found real health!
     Now is the time that thou shouldest entirely abandon
the comfort, ease, enjoyment and the life of this transient
world, and wholly arise to guide the people of
Japan, illuminating faces, perfuming nostrils and conquering,
through the heavenly hosts and divine reinforcements,
the hearts of the people of that region.
     Do not wonder at the favor and bounty of the Lord.
By the favor of God, how often a drop hath become
undulating like a sea, and an atom hath become shining
like the sun!
     The sun of Truth hath enlightened the divine world
and illumined the universe.  The rays of His grace have
shone upon the East and West, and His heat hath caused
vegetation in all countries.  So the lights and the heat
of the Sun of Truth being help and assistance, what
more dost thou need?
     Thou must warble, like the nightingale of significances,
in the rose-garden, so that thou mayest inspire
all the birds of the meadow to chant and to sing.


O thou youth of God!

     Thank God that thou hast found thy way to the


+P 562
Radiant Kingdom, torn asunder the veil of superstition
and learned the reality of the mysteries.
     All the people have formed a god in the world of
thought, and that form of their own imagination they
worship; when the fact is that the imagined form is
finite and the human mind is infinite.+F1  Surely the infinite
is greater than the finite, for imagination is accidental
(or non-essential) while the mind is essential;
surely the essential is greater than the accidental.
     Therefore consider:  All the sects and peoples worship
their own thought; they create a god in their
own minds and acknowledge him to be the creator of all
things, when that form is superstition - thus people
adore and worship imagination (or illusion).
     That Essence of the Divine Entity and the Unseen
of the unseen is holy above imagination and is beyond
thought.  Consciousness doth not reach It.  Within the
capacity of comprehension of a produced (or created)
reality that Ancient Reality cannot be contained.  It is
a different world; from it there is no information;
arrival thereat is impossible; attainment thereto is prohibited
and inaccessible.  This much is known:  It
exists and Its existence is certain and proven - but the
condition is unknown.
     All the philosophers and the doctors knew that It is,
but they were perplexed in the comprehension of Its
existence and were at last discouraged, and in great

1.  Infinite in regard to imagination, for without the mind there would be no
    imagination.  Another translation of this paragraph is as follows:
    "All the people have formed a god in the world of thought and they
    worship that form of their own imagination, while the fact is that
    the imagined concept is comprehended by the mind which is comprehensive.
    Surely that which comprehends is greater than the comprehended,
    for imagination is accidental (non-essential), while the mind
    is essential.  Surely the essential is greater than the accidental."
+P 563
despair they left this world.  For the comprehension of
the condition and mysteries of that Reality of realities
and Mystery of mysteries there is need for another
power and another sense.  That power and sense is
not possessed by mankind, therefore they have not found
any information.  For example:  If a man possess the
power of hearing, the power of tasting, the power of
smelling and the power of feeling, but no power of
seeing, he cannot see.  Hence, through the powers and
senses present in man the realization of the Unseen
Reality, which is pure and holy above the reach of
doubts, is impossible.  Other powers are needed and
other senses required.  If those powers and senses are
obtained, then information can be had; otherwise, not.
     As to the question of marriage, according to the law
of God:  First you must select one, and then it depends
upon the consent of the father and mother.  Before
your selection they have no right of interference.
     Endeavor as much as thou canst to acquire the English
language with the utmost of eloquence and excellence,
so that thou mayest be enabled to translate the
Tablets into the Japanese tongue.  This is my advice.
Certainly exert thy utmost endeavor to attain this
bounty.


O thou who art attracted by the Word of god to the
     Kingdom of God!

     Turn with the whole of thy being to God, forget
aught else save God, and supplicate God to make thee
a sign of guidance in the midst of people who are veiled
from God; perchance they may be guided to the Orb
of all horizons, enter the kingdom of harmony, drink


+P 564
of the cup of the love of God, rejoice at the manifestation
of the Kingdom of God, and shelter themselves in the shadow
of the Tree of Life in the midst of the Paradise of
God.
     This beseemeth the believers; this is the qualification
of the sincere; this is the path of the knowers, and
this is the utmost aim of the faithful.
     Exert thy utmost power that thou mayest share
this great bounty.


O thou spiritual youth!+F1

     Japan hath made wonderful progress in material
civilization, but she will become perfect when she also
becometh spiritually developed and the power of the
Kingdom becometh manifest in her.
     One will encounter a little difficulty in the beginning
of the establishment of the Cause of God in that country,
but later it will become very easy, for the inhabitants
of Japan are intelligent, sagacious and have
the power of rapid assimilation.
     For the present, a perfect youth like thee is favored
by the bounty of the Kingdom and hath attained to the
knowledge of the Lord of the Kingdom.  Show thou
forth an effort that thou mayest finish that which is
necessary in the acquisition and study of science and
art; then travel thou toward the countries of Japan, so
that thou mayest hoist the Ensign of Truth waving
from the apex of the Supreme Concourse.  Look thou
not upon thine own capability; the invisible divine confirmations

are great and the protection and providence
of the Beauty of Abha is the helper and the assistant.
When a drop draws help from the ocean, it is an ocean
in itself, and a little seed, through the outpouring of
rain, the favor of the sun and the soul-refreshing breeze,
will become a tree with the utmost freshness, full of
leaves, blossoms and fruits.  Therefore, do not consider
thy capacity and merit, but rely upon the infinite
bounty and trust to His Highness the Almighty.
Do not delay.  Undertake soon that which thou art
intending.
     There are prophecies concerning this Manifestation
in the Buddhistic books, but they are in symbols and
metaphors, and some spiritual conditions are mentioned
therein, but the leaders of religion do not understand.
They think these prophecies are material things; yet
those signs are foreshadowing spiritual occurances.


     +F1 Announce greeting on my behalf to the two young
Japanese+F2 and say:
     "His Imperial Majesty, the Mikado, became the
cause of the material progress of Japan.  I hope that
you may become the cause of her spiritual development.
This is the principle of progress.
     "Unless man maketh spiritual progress in the world
of spirit, intellect and heart, he cannot gather universal
results from material advancements.  Now you must
gird up the loins of endeavor and reflect duly, so that
you may quicken the people of Japan through the spirit
of God."

    address.
2.  Refers to the recipients of the preceding Tablets.
+P 566
+F1 O ye spiritual friends of Abdul-Baha!

     "Perfume Thou the East!  Illumine Thou the West!
Bestow Thou light to the North!  Grant Thou life to
the South!"
     This verse hath been revealed from the lips of the
Center of the Covenant one year after the departure+F2 of
Baha'o'llah.  But the nakazeen (not understanding
its spiritual purport) wondered and derided.  Praise
be to God! that now its signs have become manifest, its
power evident, and its proof plain.  Thanks be unto
Him! that the East and West are stirred into cheerfulness,
and through the Holy Fragrances all directions
are perfumed.
     The Blessed Perfection, in a clear text, hath promised
us in the Book:  "Verily I behold you from the
Horizon of Abha and will make victorious whomsoever
will arise in the service of my cause with the hosts of
the Supreme Concourse and the cohorts of the favored
angels!"  Praise be to God! that this victory and confirmation
became visible and manifest and hath shone
forth from the horizon of the world like unto the sun.
     Therefore, O ye friends of God!  Show ye forth
an earnest endeavor and display ye a resolute effort, so
that ye may become assisted in the adoration of the
Ancient Beauty and the Manifest Light; to be the cause
of spreading the light of the Sun of Truth; to infuse
into the dead, antiquated body of the world a new
spirit; to cast in the fields of the hearts pure seeds; to
arise in the service of the Cause; to speak with eloquent

tongues; to become candles of guidance in the assemblage
of the world; to become shining stars in the horizon
of the existent being; to become merciful birds in
the rose-garden of oneness; to sing the melodies of realities
and significances; to spend every breath of your
lives in the most great Cause; and to devote the period
of your existence to the service of this conspicuous Light;
so that in the end ye may be freed from loss and failure
and attain to the inexhaustible treasury of the Kingdom.
For the life on man is wholly subject to danger
and impermanency.  A person cannot put his assurance
even in one moment's continuity.  Notwithstanding
this, the nations of the world, deceived by the mirage
of superstition, imagine themselves secure in the heavenly
way.  Alas!  Alas!  Former communities in bygone
ages entertained the same perishing thoughts; but by
one of those periodical fluctuations they were all hidden
under the ground and afflicted with deprivation and
loss, except those souls who had become pure evanescence
and had arisen with great self-abnegation in
the path of God.  Such souls shine forth as brilliant
stars from the Horizon of the Ancient Glory, and the
results which emanated from their lives in succeeding
ages and cycles are the proofs of this statement.  Therefore,
do ye not rest, neither day nor night; seek ye not
for composure; talk ye of the mystery of servitude, and
seek ye the path of thralldom; so that through the
promised confirmations ye may become assisted from
the Kingdom of Oneness.
     O ye friends!  Dense and gloomy clouds have covered
the horizon of the world, and the darkness of
hatred, malignity, persecution, tyranny, and the greatest


+P 568
cruelty is spreading.  All the people are drunk with
the wine of heedlessness; and blood-thirstiness and rapaciousness
are considered the noblest excellencies of
the world of men.
     His Highness the Almighty hath chosen the friends
from among the concourse of men and hath especialized
them with the most eminent guidance and the highest
gift; so that we may with our souls and hearts exert
ourselves, sacrifice our lives, be engaged in the guidance
of the people and the training of souls; so that the
wild beasts may become the gazelles of the meadows
of unity; the wolves the sheep of God; the bloodthirsty
ones the heavenly angels; the fire of malice be
extinguished and the flame of safety in the blessed
tabernacle bestow illumination; the odor of the nether
realm of infidelity be dispelled and the fragrances of
the rose-garden of faithfulness be diffused in all parts;
the weak draw light from the Universal Reason and
evil souls seek to be purified with the holy and divine
Breath.  There are needed manifestors for this gift;
farmers for this field; gardeners for this rose-garden;
fishers for this sea; luminous stars for this heaven; spiritual
physicians for these ill ones, and loving guides for
these wanderers; so that they may bestow a share to
those who are deprived, grant a portion to those who
are shareless, give unmeasured treasure to the indigent
ones, and show forth the power of proof to the seekers.

     Glory be unto Thee, O my God!  I supplicate unto
Thee, O Thou my Helper!  I invoke Thee, O Thou
my Refuge!  I utter to Thee my agonies, O Thou my
Physician, and entreat Thee with all my hear, my soul
and my spirit, saying:

     O my God!  I my Gid!  Verily, the gloomy night
hath fallen upon all regions and the clouds of ignorance
have extended in all directions; the people are immersed
in the darkness of surmise and the tyrants are
sunk in the depths of brutality and lawlessness; the
red glare of the burning fire is flashing forth from the
nether world; roaring, ominous voices are rising from
the cruel, destructive and terrible armaments; every region
is crying out with its dumb secret tongue:  "Nothing
that I possess hath benefitted me and power and
strength are taken away from me!"  Verily, O my God,
the lamps of guidance are extinguished; the fire of animosity
is enkindled; wrath and antipathy are spread
abroad and provocation and maliciousness are disseminated
upon the face of the earth.  Yet I see only Thy
wronged followers who are crying at the tops of their
voices and summoning the people:

    "Hasten ye toward affinity!
     Hasten ye toward faithfulness!
     Hasten ye toward generosity!
     Hasten ye toward guidance!
     Hasten ye toward union!
     Hasten ye to behold the Light of the World!
     Hasten ye toward love and prosperity!
     Hasten ye toward peace and reconciliation!
     Hasten ye toward the law of disarmament!
     Hasten ye toward harmony and success!
     Hasten ye toward co-operation and mutual help in
       the path of guidance!"

     Verily, these wronged ones do sacrifice themselves
with infinite joy and happiness for the sake of the people,
with all their souls and spirits throughout all regions.

+P 570
Verily, Thou beholdest them weeping at the
misfortunes of every one of Thy creatures and becoming
grieved at the distress of Thy children; they are
kind to all the people and pained at the sight of the
calamities of the inhabitants of the world.  O my Lord!
make the wings of prosperity to grow upon their
shoulders, so that they may ever soar toward the apex
of their aspirations; strengthen their loins in the service
of Thy people, and confirm them in the thralldom
and adoration of the threshold of Thy Holiness.
     Verily, Thou art the Merciful!  Thou art the Clement,
and there is no God but Thee, the Powerful, the
Compassionate, and the Ancient!


Glory be unto Thee, O my God!

     Thou seest me rolling my face in the dust of humility
and contrition, supplicating toward the Kingdom of
Thy Might, yearning for the contemplation of Thy
Greatness, entreating Thy Grandeur, invoking at the
Threshold of Thy Mercifulness, beseeching the realm
of Thy Singleness, acknowledging my shortcomings,
longing for Thy bounty, desiring Thy concealing veil
and expecting the outpouring of the rain of Thy favor
upon all the meadows and mountains!
     O my Lord!  Verily, Thy power hath enveloped all
things, Thy dominion, Thy glory and Thy sovereignty
have become manifest as the manifestation of the sun
in mid-day; Thy Word hath penetrated the reality of
the contingent beings; Thy voice hath been raised on
the apex of the world; Thy beaming lights have radiated
from the dawning-places of all the horizons and
Thy wonderful refulgent signs have become known in


+P 571
all directions; consequently the sights and insights have
become dazzled by beholding these manifestations of
truth!  There is no land in which the fame of Thy
Merciful Cause hath not been spread, and there is no
region in which Thy manifest ensign hath not been
hoisted!  Verily, Thy voice hath reached the ears of
all the inhabitants of the globe, and the attracted ones
have become exhilarated by its holy and divine fragrances!
     Praise be to Thee, O my God! for the bestowal of
this most great bounty upon Thy chosen ones; and
thanks be to Thee, O my Lord! for this most eminent
favor upon Thy righteous servants in suffering them to
become the signs of Thy Oneness in this glorious age
and the standards of Thy sanctity in this new cycle!
     O my Lord!  O my Lord!  Assist the weak ones
with the Supreme Energy; shelter the indigent ones near
the asylum of Thy Greatest Majesty; strengthen the
loins of those souls whose faces radiate with Thy lights
and whose tongues become eloquent in the glorification
and commemoration of Thy Name; make them the
plants of Thy luminous orchard, the blossoms of Thy
blessed tree, the leaves of Thy Sadrat-el-Montaha+F1 and
the flowers of Thy exalted rose-garden!  Verily, Thou
art the Clement, the Lofty, the Magnificent, the Omnipresent
and Thou art the Protector, the Guardian, the Helper, the Powerful, the

+P 572
friends of God - but what can be done!  For there is
neither opportunity nor time.  The affairs are like unto
the waves, and the requirements are like unto the
vernal showers.  I do not rest a moment, neither do I
have leisure for an instant.  Letters are received every
day from all the regions and it is impossible and impracticable
to answer one among ten; yet there is no other
mode than to answer the letters which are the most
important, for the urgent affairs must be attended to.
Therefore, I request the pardon and ask the forgiveness
of the friends, that they may overlook these shortcomings
and be content and happy with that which is possible.
     O ye friends of Abdul-Baha!  The East is illumined,
the West is perfumed and the world is in
motion and acceleration.  Such a tumult is visible in
the regions; and such a spiritual commotion is perceived
in the pillars of the earth!  The fame of the
grandeur of the Word of God hath reached the ears
of the inhabitants of the world, and the voice of the
Cause of God holdeth universal sway!  It is the time for
joy and happiness and the moment of exhileration and
ecstasy.  One must live in accord with the exhortations
and advices of the Blessed Perfection and behave with
such deeds and actions as to become conducive to the
illumination of the world and the manifestion of
mercifulness among the nations.
     All the denizens of the earth, the communities and
the people have taken an axe in their hands to uproot
the life-tree of each other; they are blood-thirsty and
the instigators of corruption; they are armed to the
teeth with destructive implements; each seeketh the


+P 573
death and annihilation of the other.  But the heavenly
power, the divine energy and the celestial hand of
strength, hath raised the canopy of the oneness of the
realm of humanity on the pinnacle of the contingent
being and hoisted the standard of the most great
peace, friendship, love, uprightness and the adoration
of truth.  The friends are the servants of this canopy
and the beloved are the hosts of this standard.  Therefore
they must with one accord arise to that which is
the requirement and the merit of this day, become overflowing
with joy and beatitude, perfume the nostrils
with the fragrances, sweeten the tastes with the honey
and delicacy of love, become the signs of guidance, be
the glad-tidings of the Supreme Concourse and the
army of the Kingdom of Abha; so that they may destroy
the edifice of war and bloodshed, efface the traces
of battle and strife from the face of the earth, uproot
the tree of foreignness and plant the tree of unity in
the rose-garden of the regions, extinguish the fire of
hatred and animosity and set in motion the sea of love
and affinity, erase the traces of discord from the Tablet
of the earth and register thereon the verses of concord,
clear the field of existence from the thorns and brambles
of hostilities and ill-feeling and adorn it with the hyacinths
and anemones of harmony, train and educate the
souls and loosen the tongue in the delivery of the instructions
and teachings of the Blessed Perfection!

     O ye beloved ones!  It is the moment of the ecstasy
of the soul and consciousness and the season of running
in the arena of sacrifice!  Show ye kindness to all; be
ye engaged in the refinement of the souls.  Become ye
as ignited lamps and adorn ye the orchard of


+P 574
being!  These days are swiftly passing and this mortal
life will remain fruitless and without result.  Therefore,
while there is yet time and the arrow is in the bow,
enter ye the chase and strike ye the game.  This game is
the good-pleasure of God, and this chase is the merciful
Providence; that is, living in accord with the divine
instructions.


O Thou Pure God!

     Thou art the Seer and the Hearer!  Thou art the
Powerful and the Mighty!  The fame of Thy Most
Great Cause hath traveled forth and radiated from all
the horizons!  The believers have attracted to the Face of
that Brilliant Orb.  The tongues are engaged in Thy
Commemoration and the hearts are at all times dilated
with the Fragrances of Thy Holiness.  The faces are
all turned toward Thee; the hearts are captive of Thy
Abode, and the souls are athirst for the Salubrious
Water of Thy River.  The call of Thy Greatest Name
hath caused a mighty reverberation throughout all the
kingdoms, and the Power of Thy Consummate Word
hath unfurled Thy Ensign to the East and to the West!
The favored ones supplicate with the utmost humility,
and the righteous ones are in an attitude of soulful
invocation to the Kingdom of Beauty.
     O my God!  Assist Thou all of them and pour upon
them the showers of Thy Supreme Confirmations; so
that they may become the cause of the tranquility of the
world of creation; to be the servants of the human
race; to become, with all their hearts and souls, the real
friends of all nations; to become with the utmost joy


+P 575
and fragrance, the spiritual companions of the adherents
of all religions; to dispel the darkness of
strangeness and to spread the lights of friendship in
this transitory world!
     O God!  Grant Thou to all of them an Asylum in
Thy Neighborhood and gladden their hearts and impart
to them rejoicing through Thine Incomparable
bounties!  Thou are the Omnipotent and the Mighty!
Thou art the Seer and the Hearer!

     O ye real companions!  Day and night Abdul-Baha
is engaged in the remembrances of the friends, and
time after time doth he associate with them and behold
their blessed faces.  I entreat in the Threshold of the
Lord of Existence to confrim them in a befitting manner
and assist them to follow wholly the Commands of
God!
     O ye friends of God!  According to what is heard,
some of the friends have celebrated my birthday in
some countries on the fifth of Zamadi-Avval (23rd day
of May).  Although their intention is no other than
good, their aim be to promote the Word of God and
to commemorate the True One among the people in this
manner, yet, according to the text of the Religion of
God and the irrefutable command, the fifth of Zamadi-Avval
(May 23rd) is the day of the Declaration of His
Highness the Supreme (the Bab) - may my life be a
sacrifice to Him!  Consequently, they must celebrate
and adorn that Blessed Day in the name of the Declaration
of that Orb of regions; make rejoicing and happiness,
and impart the glad-tidings of heavenly beatitude
to each other.  For that holy essence was the Herald


+P 576
of the Most Great Name.  Therefore, no one must
mention that day of the fifth of Zamadi-Avval (May
23rd) except as the Day of the Declaration of His
Highness the Bab.  This is the unquestionable text of
the Religion of God.
     Regarding the birth of this servant, which also
happened on that day, this is a proof of the favors and
bounties of God toward this servant.  However, this
Blessed Day must become known as the Day of the
Declaration of His Highness the Supreme (Bab) and
the beginning of the effulgence of the Sun of Reality.
You must on this account be engaged in rejoicing,
happiness and gladness.  This is the truth!  Beware!
Beware! that you avoid that which is mentioned; otherwise,
it will cause the utmost grief to the heart of
Abdul-Baha.
     I ask from the inexhaustible bounties of His Highness
the Almighty, that the righteous ones become assisted
to live in accord with the Religion of God; neither
do they deviate a hair's breadth therefrom; and spread
this Tablet throughout all regions, so that all the
friends may comprehend the truth and act accordingly.


O ye beloved of God and maid-servants of the Merciful!

     The republic of wise men believes that the difference
in minds and opinions is due to the difference of education
and the acquisition of ethics.  That is, that minds
are equal in origin, but education and the acquisition
of ethics cause minds to differ and comprehensions to be
at variance; that this difference is not in entity but in
education and teaching; that there is no individual distinction


+P 577
for any soul.  Hence, the members of the
human race all possess the capacity of attaining to the
highest station, and the proof they adduce therefor is
this:  "The inhabitants of a country like Africa are
all as wandering savages and wild animals; they lack
intelligence and knowledge; all are uncivilized; not one
civilized and wise man is to be found among them.
On the contrary, consider the civilized countries, the
inhabitants of which are living in the highest state of
culture and ethics, solidarity and inter-dependence; possessing,
with few exceptions, acute power of comprehensions
and sound mind.  Therefore, it is made clear
and evident that the superiority and inferiority of minds
and comprehensions arises from education and cultivation,
or from their lack and absence.  A bent branch is
straightened by training and the wild fruit of the jungle
is made the product of the orchard.  An ignorant man
by learning becomes knowing, and the world of savagery,
through the bounty of a wise educator, is changed
into a civilized kingdom.  The sick is healed by medication,
and the poor man, by learning the arts of commerce,
is made rich.  The follower, by attaining the
virtues of the leader, becomes great, and the lowly man,
by the education of the teacher, rises from the nadir of
oblivion to the zenith of celebrity."  These are the
proofs of the wise men.
     The prophets also acknowledge this opinion, towit:
That education hath a great effect upon the human
race, but they declare that minds and comprehensions
are originally different.  And this matter is self-evident;
it cannot be refuted.  We see that certain children of
the same age, nativity and race, nay, from the same


+P 578
household, under the tutorship of one teacher, differ in
their minds and comprehensions.  One advanceth rapidly,
another is slow in catching the rays of culture, still
another remaineth in the lowest degree of stupidity.
     No matter how much the shell is educated (or
polished), it can never become the radiant pearl.  The
black stone will not become the world illumining gem.
The calocynth+F1 and the thorny cactus can never by training
and development become the blessed tree.  That
is to say, training doth not change the human gem (i.e.,
human nature or entity), but it produceth a marvelous
effect.  By this effective power all that is registered
latent of virtues and capacities in the human reality will
be revealed.
     Cultivation by the farmer maketh of the grain the
harvest, and the effort of the gardener maketh of the
seed a noble tree.  The gentle teacher promoteth the
children of the school to the lofty altitude and the bestowal
of the trainer placeth the little child upon the
throne of ether.  Therefore, it is demonstrated and
proven that minds are different in the original entity
or nature, and that education commandeth a decided and
great influence.  Were there no educator, all souls would
remain savage, and were it not for the teacher, the
children would be ignorant creatures.
     It is for this reason that, in this New Cycle, education
and training are recorded in the Book of God as
obligatory and not voluntary.  That is, it is enjoined
upon the father and mother, as a duty, to strive with
all effort to train the daughter and the son, to nurse
them from the breast of knowledge and to rear them in


------------------------
1.  Cucumis calocynthis.
+P 579
the bosom of sciences and arts.  Should they neglect this
matter, they shall, be held responsible and worthy of
reproach in the presence of the stern Lord.
     This is a sin unpardonable, for they have made that
poor babe a wanderer in the Sahara of ignorance, unfortunate
and tormented; to remain during a lifetime
a captive of ignorance and pride, negligent and without
discernment.  Verily, if that babe depart from this
world at the age of infancy, it is sweeter and better.
In this sense, death is better than life; deprivation than
salvation; non-existence lovelier than existence; the
grave better than the spacious, regal home; for in the
sight of mankind that child is abased and degraded and
in the sight of God weak and defective.  in gatherings
it is ashamed and humiliated and in the arena of examination
subdued and defeated by young and old.
What a mistake is this!  What an everlasting humiliation!
     Therefore, the beloved of God and the maid-servants
of the Merciful must train their children with life and
heart and teach them in the school of virtue and perfection.
They must not be lax in the matter; they must
not be inefficient.  Truly, if a babe did not live at all it
were better than to let it grow ignorant, for that innocent
babe, in later life, would become afflicted with innumerable
defects, responsible to and questioned by God,
reproached and rejected by the people.  What a sin
this would be and what an omission!
     the first duty of the beloved of God and the maid-servants
of the Merciful is this:  They must strive by
all possible means to educate both sexes, male and female;


+P 580
girls like boys; there is no difference whatsoever
between them.  The ignorance of both is blameworthy,
and negligence in both cases is reprovable.  "Are they
who know and they who do not know equal?" (Koran)
     The command is decisive concerning both.  If it be
considered through the eye of reality, the training and
culture of daughters is more necessary than that of sons,
for these girls will come to the station of motherhood
and will mould the lives of the children.  The first
trainer of the child is the mother.  The babe, like unto
a green and tender branch, will grow according to the
way it is trained.  If the training be right, it will grow
right, and if crooked, the growth likewise, and unto
the end of life it will conduct itself accordingly.
     Hence, it is firmly established that an untrained and
uneducated daughter, on becoming a mother, will be
the prime factor in the deprivation, ignorance, negligence
and the lack of training of many children.
     O ye beloved of God and the maid-servants of the
Merciful!  Teaching and learning, according to the
decisive texts of the Blessed Beauty (Baha'o'llah),
is a duty.  Whosover is indifferent therein depriveth
himself of the great bounty.
     Beware!  Beware! that ye fail not in this matter.
Endeavor with heart, with life, to train your children,
especially the daughters.  No excuse is acceptable in
this matter.
     Thus may eternal glory and everlasting supremacy,
like unto the mid-day sun, shine forth in the assemblage
of the people of Baha', and the heart of Abdul-Baha
become happy and thankful.


+P 581
O pure friends of God!

     Cleanliness and sanctity in all conditions are the characteristics
of pure beings and necessities of free souls.
The first perfection consists in cleanliness and sanctity
and in purity from every defect.  When man in all conditions
is pure and immaculate, he will become the center
of the reflection of the manifest Light.  In all his
actions and conduct there must first be purity, then
beauty and independence.  The channel must be cleansed
before it is filled with sweet water.  The pure eye
comprehendeth the sight and the meeting of God; the
pure nostril inhaleth the perfumes of the rose-garden
of bounty; the pure heart becometh the mirror of the
beauty of truth.  This is why, in the heavenly Books,
the divine counsels and commands have been compared
to water.  So, in the Koran it is said, "and we have
caused a pure water to descend from heaven;" and in
the Gospel, "Except a man hath received the baptism
of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the
Kingdom of God."  Then it is evident that the divine
teachings are the heavenly grace and the showers of
the mercy of God, which purify the hearts of men.
     The meaning is, in all conditions, cleanliness and
sanctity, purity and delicacy exalt humanity and make
the contingent beings progress.  Even when applied to
physical things, delicacy causeth the attainment of
spirituality, as it is established in the Holy Scriptures.
     External cleanliness, although it is but a physical
thin, hath a great influence upon spirituality.  For
example, although sound is but the vibrations of the
air which affect the tympanum of the ear, and vibrations


+P 582
of the air are but an accident among the accidents
which depend upon the air, consider how much marvelous
notes or a charming song influence the spirits!  A
wonderful song giveth wings to the spirit and filleth
the heart with exalteth.  To return to the subject, the
fact of having a pure and spotless body likewise exerciseth
an influence upon the spirit of man.
     Now, see how much purity is approved in the Court
of God, that it should be especially mentioned in the
Holy Books of the Prophets.  So the Holy Books forbid
the eating of any unclean thing, or the use of anything
which is not pure.  Certain prohibitions are absolute
and imperative for all: he who commits that which
is forbidden is detested by God and excluded from
the number of the elect.  This applieth to the things
forbidden by an absolute prohibition and of which the
perpetration is a grave sin; they are so vile that even to
mention them is shameful.  There are other forbidden
things which do not cause an immediate evil and of
which the pernicious effect is only gradually produced.
They are also abhorred, blamed and rejected by God,
but their prohibition is not recorded in an absolute way,
although cleanliness and sanctity, spotlessness and
purity, the preservation of health and independence are
required by these interdictions.
     One of these last prohibitions is the smoking of
tobacco, which is unclean, malodorous, disagreeable and
vulgar and of which the gradual harmfulness is universally
recognized.  All clever physicians have judged,
and have also shown by experiment, that one of the
constituents of tobacco is a mortal poison and that
smokers are exposed to different indispositions and


+P 583
maladies.  That is why cleanly people have a marked
aversion for its use.
     His Supreme Highness (the Bab) - may my soul be
His sacrifice! - in the beginning of His Cause, openly
forbade it and all the friends abandoned its use.  But,
as it was a time for caution and he who abstained from
smoking was ill treated, persecuted and even killed,
therefore the friends were obliged, as a matter of prudence,
to smoke.  later, the Kitab-el-Akdas was revealed
and as the prohibition of tobacco was not clearly
stated in it, the friends did not renounce it.  But the
Blessed Perfection had always a marked aversion for
its use.  At the beginning of the Cause, for certain reasons,
he smoked a little, but later he abandoned it completely,
and the holy souls who obeyed him in all circumstances,
also entirely gave up smoking.  I wish to
say that, in the sight of God, the smoking of tobacco is
a thing which is blamed and condemned, very unclean,
and of which the result is by degrees injurious.  Besides
it is a cause of expense and of loss of time and
it is a harmful habit.  So, for those who are firm in
the Covenant, it is a thing reprobated by the reason and
by tradition, the renouncement of which giveth gradual
repose and tranquility, permitteth one to have stainless
hands and a clean mouth, and hair which is not pervaded
by a bad odor.
     Without any doubt, the friends of God on receiving
this epistle will renounce this injurious by all
means, even if it be necessary to do so by degrees.  This
is my hope.
     As to the question of opium, disgusting and execrated,
I resign myself to God for its punishment.  The formal


+P 584
text of the Kitab-el-Akdas forbids and reproves it
and, according to reason, its use leads to madness.  Experience
hath shown that he who giveth himself up to
it is completely excluded from the world of humanity.
Let us take refuge in God against the perpetration of
so shameful a thing, which is the destruction of the
foundations of humanity and which causeth a perpetual
unhappiness.  It taketh possession of the soul of man,
killeth the reason, weakeneth the intelligence, maketh
a living man dead and extinguisheth the natural heat.
It is impossible to imagine anything more pernicious.
Happy is he who never mentioneth the word opium!
But what is the fate of those who make use of it!
     O friends of God!  Force and violence, constraint
and oppression are condemned in this divine cycle, but
to prevent the use of opium, all means must be employed,
so that the human species may be delivered
and freed from this great calamity.  Otherwise, alas!
for all the negligent before God.
     O Lord!  Give to the people of Baha' cleanliness
and holiness in all conditions, purify and free them
from all defilement, deliver them from the use of all
that is execrated, liberate them from the chains of
habits, so that they may be pure and free, clean and
spotless, that they may be worthy servants of the Sacred
Threshold and may deserve to enter into relation with
God.  Deliver them from alcohol and tobacco, and save
them from opium, the purveyor of madness!  Make
them companions of the holy breezes, in order that they
may know the pleasures of the wine of the love of God,
and that they may attain to the joy and the happiness
of attraction to the Kingdom of Abha!


+P 585
     Hast Thou not said, "All that thou hast in thy cellar
will not appease the thirst of my love - bring me, O
cup-bearer, of the wine of the spirit, a cup full as the
sea!"
     O friends of God!  Experience hath shown how
much the renouncing of tobacco, wine and opium,
giveth health, strength and intellectual enjoyments,
penetration of judgment and physical vigor.  There
exists today a tribe+F1 which refrains and abstains from
tobacco, alcohol and opium and it completely excels all
others in power, in bravery, in health, beauty and grace.
A single one of these men can withstand ten men of
other tribes, and this hath been universally proved; that
is to say, generally, the individuals of this tribe are
superior to the individuals of the other tribes.
     Therefore strive that the greatest cleanliness and
sanctity, which is the great desire of Abdul-Baha,
should be resplendent among the Bahais, and that the
companions of God should surpass the rest of mankind
in all conditions and perfections; that they may be physically
and morally superior to others; that through cleanliness
and purity, refinement and health, they may be
the chief of wise men, and that by their affranchisement,
their prudence, and the control of their desires, they
may be the princes of the pure, the free and the wise.
     Upon you be the glory of El-Abha!


O ye two+F2 , servant and maid-servant of the Beauty of
     Abha!

     Thank ye His Highness the Incomparable One, that

fragrance of the rose-garden of the Kingdom of Abha
impart the spirit of life to the inquirers.
     Excellent!  Excellent is your magnanimity and exalted
intention!


O thou who art skilled in the Knowledge of God and
     wise in the Wisdom of the Almighty!

     Turn thy face toward the Kingdom of Might with
supplication and invocation and entreat thy Lord, the
Merciful, with this commune, until the heart and consciousness
be illumined by the breath of God from the
right side of grace and generosity, and say:

     "O my God!  O my God!  Verily I am Thy humble
servant and Thy meek slave.  I beseech Thee with all
my heart and soul, in the middle of nights, and declare:
O my Lord!  O my Lord!  Enlighten the sights [or
eyes] by the outpouring of lights; purify the souls by
the fragrances of Paradise; dilate the hearts by the
wafting of the breeze whereby the sorrows are dispelled,
and exhilarate the spirits by the cups of the wine
which is gleaming and sparkling like unto a lamp!
     "Then intoxicate me with the wine of Thy love, so
that I may attain to success and prosperity in this dawn
of Light; may speak Thy praises, call upon Thy Name,
be engaged in Thy commemoration in this vast country
and spacious continent and be inebriated with the pure


+P 587
Wine which is glowing in the excellent Cup.  Then suffer
me to become the sign of guidance among Thy
creatures and to become a supreme example among the
believers, in order that I may lead others to Thy Word,
spread Thy truth, promulgate Thy knowledge and deliver
Thy teachings.
     "Verily, Thou art the Confirmer, the Assister, the
Mighty, the Powerful and the Beneficent!"


O seeker for the Truth!

     There are two ways of healing sickness, material
means and spiritual means.  The first is by the use of
remedies, of medicines; the second consists in praying to
God and in turning to Him.  Both means should be
used and practiced.
     Illness caused by physical accident should be treated
with medical remedies; those which are due to spiritual
causes disappear through spiritual means.  Thus an illness
caused by affliction, fear, nervous impressions, will
be healed by spiritual rather than by physical treatment.
Hence, both kinds of remedies should be considered.
Moreover, they are not contradictory, and thou shouldst
accept the physical remedies as coming from the mercy
and favor of God, who hath revealed and made manifest
medical science so that His servants may profit
from this kind of treatment also.  Thou shouldst give
equal attention to spiritual treatments, for they produce
marvellous effects.
     Now, if thou wishest to know the divine remedy
which will heal man from all sickness and will give him
the health of the divine kingdom, know that it is the
precepts and teachings of God.l  Guard them sacredly.


+P 588
O thou darling dear!

     Turn thy face toward the Supreme Kingdom and
chant thou this commune:

the bosom of Thy Gift a dear resting-place of comfort,
suffer me to grow and be nurtured with the honey
and the milk of Thy love and train me under the breast
of Thy knowledge; bestow Thou freedom while in a
state of childhood and grant Thou excellence!
     O Thou Incomparable One!  Make me the confident
of the Kingdom of the Unseen!  Verily, Thou
art the Mighty and the Powerful!


O Unequalled Lord!+F1

     For this helpless child be a Protector; for this weak

we are of Thy garden; though we are but young trees,
bare of leaves and blossoms, still we are of Thy
orchard; therefore, nourish this grass with the rain
of Thy county; refresh and vivify these young, languishing
trees with the breeze of Thy spiritual springtime.
     Awaken us, enlighten us, sustain us, give us eternal
life and accept us into Thy Kingdom!

mother.  Praise be to God, she hath attained to the
desire of her heart and hath ascended to the Kingdom
of Abha!
     Happiness dependeth of the spiritual glad-tidings
and not upon material means.  It is found in the Kingdom
of Abha and not in this mortal world.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Become thou not extinguished
by the winds of tests, but rather become
ignited and be more happy, for then thou wilt become
a tried believer.
     Guide the maid-servant of God, Mrs. ........., to
the power of the Holy Spirit and say: "Unless the
Holy Spirit become intermediary, one cannot attain
directly to the bounties of God.  Do not overlook the
obvious truths, for it is a self-evident fact that a child


+P 592
cannot be instructed without a teacher, and knowledge
is a bounty from the bounties of God.  The soil is not
covered with grass and green without the rain of the
cloud; therefore the cloud is the intermediary between
the divine bounties and the soil.  A body doth not
develop and grow without the soul; therefore the soul
is the medium of the spiritual life."
     Convey respectful greeting to Mrs. ......... and
say: "I hope that through the breath of the Holy Spirit
the mysteries may become disclosed to thee, for without
this channel it is impossible and unattainable.  Turn
thine attention to the days of His Highness the Christ;
some people imagine that without the Messianic outpourings,
it is possible to attain to Truth, but this very
imagination became the cause of their deprivation."
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Whenever thou art
desiring to talk and answer questions, turn thy face toward
the Kingdom of Abha and beseech for assistance;
then loosen thy tongue.  Thou wilt behold at that time
how thou art able to answer all the questions!
     o thou maid-servant of God!  The aim of the theosophists
is to attain to Truth, but the Truth is unattainable
except through the favor of the Holy Spirit.  The
light hath a center and if one desire to seek it otherwise
but from the center, he can never attain to it.  In this
solar system the source of light is the sun and every
light is acquired from it; even the lamps of the night
are ignited through the sun, for if there were no sun
the trees would not grow nor the mines develop, so
that the oil be extracted from those trees and mines,
and the lamps of the night be lit by it.  Is it possible
that one attain to the light in this globular sphere without


+P 593
the mediation of the sun?  No, by the life of God!
To suppose it, is pure imagination.  But the Truth is
this:  The main source of the lights is the Sun and the
rays are shed from it upon all the regions.


O ye+F1 spiritual ones!  O ye heavenly ones!

     The assembly which you have established in that
city is a splendor from the congregation of the Supreme
Concourse.  I ask from God that the hearts may be
illuminated, the spirits be rejoiced through the most
great glad-tidings, the eyes be upraised toward the Supreme
Realm and the tongues be loosened in thanksgiving
and glorification.
     The members of that assembly are favored in the
Threshold of Oneness and are loved and respected by
this imprisoned one.  They must continue to teach
with utmost firmness, be engaged in the mentioning of
the True One, read the verses of God, supplicate toward
the Kingdom of eternity, bring about the meetings
of consultation,+F2 and spread the Word of God, the
spiritual attraction of the love of God, the increase of
the knowledge of God and the realization of affinity,
friendship, unison and nobility.


O ye+F3 servants of the True One and the maid-servants
     of the Merciful!

     Do not think that ye are forgotten for one moment!
Abdul-Baha is at all times remembering you with infinite
love and kindness and supplicates assistance and
favor, at the Threshold of Oneness, so that the invisible

confirmation may pour down, the divine bounties
unveil their countenances, the friends in that region
be ignited like unto lamps and the maid-servants
of God shine like stars; in order to illumine that country,
to make that clime the "Paradise of perpetual
abode" [or heaven], to suffer the people to drink from
the wine of guidance, to intoxicate the ones yearning
after the Kingdom of Abha, to open spiritual universities,
to be instructed in the mysteries of the love of God
by the Heavenly Instructor, to associate with each
other with the utmost humility and attain to spiritual
affinity.
     Each one must sacrifice his life and possessions to
the other and each person be loving to all the inhabitants
of the world, rending asunder the curtain of foreignness
and consorting with all the people with union
and accord.  They must be faithful to the traitors and
benevolent to the tyrant.  They must recognize the
enemies as friends, the unknown as known.  These
are the advices and exhortations of God!
     O ye friends:  O ye maid-servants of the Merciful!
In order to thank God for this most great guidance,
consort with all the people with the utmost joy and
happiness, so that ye may become the recipients of the
glances of Providence.
     Become ye not sad on account of any calamity,
neither be ye broken hearted by any trials.  Be ye firm
and steadfast in order that the beloved may become
the cup-bearer of the assembly and the greatest
desire become realized.
     Blessing be upon ye by the bounty of your Lord the
Merciful!


+P 595
+F1 O my Lord!  O my Lord!

     +F2 I am a child of tender years.  Nourish me from the
breast of Thy mercy, train me in the bosom of Thy
love, educate me in the school of Thy guidance and
develop me under the shadow of Thy bounty!  Deliver
me from darkness, make me a brilliant light; free
me from unhappiness, make me a flower of the rose-garden;
suffer me to become the servant of Thy Threshold
and confer upon me the disposition and nature of
the righteous ones; make me a cause of bounty to the
human world and crown my head with the diadem of
eternal life!
     Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Seer,
the Hearer!


     +F3 Thou hast written concerning the universal peace,
that before long the congress of The Hague will be
opened+F4 and discussion will be made in regard to the
universal peace.
     This problem cannot be solved by the congress of
The Hague, whose members are the representatives of
nations; nay, rather, this graceful beloved will unveil
her face in all the regions through the penetrative power
of the Word of God.
     The congress of The Hague is as follows:  The
wine sellers call a meeting so that they may discuss

     Nations who are constantly thinking wither of worldly
conquest, the expansion of their own dominion or waging
war upon their contemporaries, send ministers and
representatives to the congress of The Hague to discuss
the problem of universal peace and legislative registrations
for the prevention of war!
     But regarding the universal language:  Ere long
significance and scientific discussions concerning this matter
will arise among the people of discernment and insight
and it will produce the desired result.


O thou who art attracted by the brilliant lights of the
     Merciful One, shining from the Supreme Kingdom!

     I opened thy letter with the greatest happiness and
considered the meaning of thine address; but sadness
became most intense within me when I learned about
the dissensions among the brethren+F1 in those countries.
By the life of God!  "This is a wonderful thing!"
     Verily,  the mission of all the prophets, the relation
of all the scriptures, the diffusion of the instructions of
God and the descent of His law, were all in order to
establish agreement and union and to strengthen love
and harmony among nations of different customs and
thoughts, of diverse beliefs, doctrines, rites and habits;
of various classes, tribes and races.  So likewise, as
thou seest in this beautiful religion, verily, men of different
beliefs, creeds and religions, of contrary ideas
and thoughts, of various races, languages and natal


------------------------
1.  During the year 1899.
+P 597
lands - whether from East, West, North or South -
all have entered under the shade of this Blessed Tree,
planted, grown and reared in the midst of Paradise,
and are formed into a single nation and religion in
mutual union and agreement, ready to sacrifice their
souls and bodies, each to the other.  This harmony is
not effected but through the influence of the Word of
God and is circulated and spread in all directions among
the believers of God, who are firm in the Covenant.
     The dissensions prevailing in those parts (America)
is altogether too surprising and strange; and I entreat
God to purge it out through thy power of unity and
oneness and unite the congregations and gather together
the dispersed multitude.  verily, He is powerful in all
things!
     But for thee, leave such matters and disturbances and
withdraw from those districts and places and turn thy
face sincerely to God; take His instructions and be expanded
through the breaths of god.  The Spirit of
God shall assist thee and His angels will confirm thee;
the life of holiness of God will be breathed into thy
mouth and thou wilt find thyself in a position free from
these ideas and thoughts resulting from worldly grades.
(Verily, these are disgraces to all who are in the habit
of reading the verses of unity in the assemblies of existence!)
Seize the opportunity, use every effort and
depend not upon circumstances which produce no fruits.
Spend thy days, with all joy and fragrance, in speaking
to the praise of God, being gladdened through His
good tidings, in rejoicing through His graces and in
spreading His breaths.  Then thou shalt, with the eye
of joy, see the banners of the Covenant fluttering above


+P 598
all stately mansions.  Verily, God effecteth that which
He pleaseth; naught can annul His Covenant; naught
can obstruct His favor nor oppose His Cause!  He
doeth with His will that which pleaseth Him and He
is powerful over all things!  At that time thou wilt
find the waverers in manifest loss.
     As for the instructions:  They will be revealed to
thee and spread all through all those regions by the translation
of the divine verses.
     As for the symbol of the cross, appointed in former
times:  Know verily, that the cross form is a wonderful
figure and consists of two right lines placed crosswise -
one perpendicular to the other - and this figure exists
in all things.
     Meditate upon these words and pay attention to
the tissue in all existing substances, either plant, animal
or man, and thou wilt see that they all are
formed of the cross figure or two crosswise lines.  Consider
this intently with true meditation.  Then thou wilt
be taught by the Holy Ghost that it is for this reason
that God hath chosen this symbol to be displayed as
the token of sacrifice in all periods of the ages.
     I will explain to thee, in future time, the mystery
of sacrifice.  There is nothing more beautiful than
this tree united with the cross.  Verily, this tree is a
type of the Tree of Life inconjunction with the cross;
in this, the mystery of sacrifice.
     as for the crescent:  It hath reference to the beginning
of the religion of God which shall grow to be a
full moon.
     As for the stars:  They are types of the guides; for,
verily, the star is a guide to people, even in the


+P 599
most gloomy darkness, on both land and sea.  In
former centuries, people were aided by the pole-star
in whatever direction they went.
     Verily, I supplicate God to raise the instrument of
sacrifice in those regions and to reveal there the mystery
of sacrifice; to cause the crescent of the religion of
God to rise until it groweth into a shining full moon;
to brighten the stars of guidance and guide all through
it; and I beseech Him to assist those brethren to promote
His Word in those most distant places, cause
them to be servants to His precious olive-garden, keepers
of His inaccessible fortress and guides to his
straight path!
     May glory be unto thee and unto them!


O thou who art illuminated by the Light of Knowledge!

     Verily, I beseech God and supplicate Him to increase
thine assurance, thy knowledge and thine attraction and
enkindlement by the fire of the love of God, day by
day.
     O maid-servant of God!  Clothe thyself with the
cuirass of assurance, so that thou mayest endure the
arrows of suspicion which are successively pouring from
the tongues of the heedless ones.  Be a lamp, the light
of which may dispel the darkness, and a real standard
which may remove the doubts of the veiled people.
Turn thou unto the Kingdom of thy Lord, the Ancient,
and seek for confirmation at every moment and time,
so that lights may shine forth unto thee from the kingdom
of mysteries, and the angels of the Kingdom may
come unto thee in succession, with a power from the
Realm of Might.  Verily, thy Lord shall assist thee


+P 600
and strengthen thee in that whereby thy breast will
be dilated among the maid-servants of the Merciful
One!


O thou who art gazing toward Abdul-Baha!

     Now I address thee with a heart filled with affection
toward thee, and say:  "O maid-servant of God!  Be a
flame of the fire of the love of God, and consume the
veils of women's doubts.  And know thou that, verily,
the Lord who "doeth whatsoever He willeth" will assist
thee in proof and argument and will enable thee
to speak the praise of the Merciful One and will make
thee a sign of knowledge.
     "Arise to serve the Cause of God in the vineyard
of God and water the developed and flourishing trees
with the waters of mysteries which are deposited in the
innermost parts of the words of the Books; and be assured
that the fountain of assurance will gush out in
the hearts of the firm and steadfast women believers,
and the divine graces will strengthen them from all
sides, and the Lord will enable them to diffuse the
fragrances.  And He will make them manifest signs,
beaming stars, shining lights, fruitful trees, flowing
fountains, perfect words and mature proofs.  Then
know thou that verily Abdul-Baha is between the fangs
of the dragon of afflictions and in the grasp of dangers
night and day."
     As to ye, O maid-servants of the Merciful One:
"Gird up your loins in union and harmony, so that the
Lord may strengthen your backs in His mighty Kingdom,
make you servants in His excellent vineyard,
raise you to the highest stations in this glorious age,


+P 601
and cause you to reach your greatest hopes in this auspicious
day."
     Address thou the maid-servants of the Merciful One,
and say: "Verily, Mary Magdalene was a villager, but
on account of her keeping firm in the Cause of Christ
after His death, she was rendered successful in such a
matter, whereby her face is shining and beaming forth
on the horizon of the universe forevermore!  And she
surpassed even men in defending the fortress of the
Cause of God against the attack of the hosts of suspicions.
This is indeed a glorious condition!  This is
indeed a great matter!  This is indeed a manifest
light!"


O thou who art attracted to the Spirit of Truth!

     At this moment I remember thee, while the cup of
my tongue is overflowing with the wine of God's praise,
and I address thee in a spirit whereby the hearts of all
the creation are cheerfully moved.
     Know thou, verily, the Spirit hath indeed so surrounded
my limbs that it moveth them as it willeth and
my tongue uttereth the most wonderful speech and most
sweet words while addressing thee, so that thou mayest
be moved by these holy fragrances which perfume all
regions, and be dilated with joy by this address, which
is revealed because of my abundant love for thee and
my excessive kindness and great affection unto thee.
     O maid-servant of God, verily the Holy Spirit
breathes in this day unto the hearts which are moving,
beating, pure and attracted by the love of God.
     Abandon thou every occupation and be engaged in
the affairs of thy Lord and serve the Spirit of Truth


+P 602
which hath poured a spiritual, divine and everlasting
life upon the brilliant hearts.
     O maid-servant of God!  By God, the True One,
verily the crown of mighty gift is suspended betwixt
heaven and earth and the angels of holiness are awaiting
a lofty head which may be worthy of this great bestowal,
so that it may descend upon that head, and that it
may wear that glorious crown, the most precious gems
of which illumine the eyes of all in the world!
     O maid-servant of God!  Many a spiritual woman
came (into the world) and passed away in vain; no
sound is heard of them and no trace of them is seen;
inasmuch as their spirits were not dependent upon the
Holy Spirit, nor were they attracted to the fragrances
of Truth; nor were they ever baptized by the Water
of Life, not by the Spirit of Truth which speaketh in
the assemblies of the Kingdom and which breathes
upon spirits the breezes which waft an eternal glory, the
signs of which are everlasting.


O thou who art attracted to the call of the Lord of the
     Kingdom!

     Know thou, verily, the Kingdom is a magnet of the
divine world, and it attracteth the iron of pure hearts
which are capable of the bounties of the Lord of Might.
Blessed art thou, for thou hast turned unto the Lord
of Heaven, thy heart hath depended upon the Light of
Guidance, thou hast advanced toward the Center of
Righteousness, and thy spirit is cheered by the abundance
of the Supreme Concourse!  Verily, I beseech
God to strengthen thee with "One Mighty in Power,"
so that the spirit may pour upon thee the teachings of


+P 603
the Beauty of El-Abha, and to baptize thee with the
water of life, the fire of the love of God, and with
the spirit of confirmation, among maid-servants.
     O maid-servant of God!  It is incumbent upon thee
to supplicate thy Lord, to seek His nearness with thy
heart, to be submissive and humble before His maid-servants,
and to serve His great vineyard.  forsake
the mortal grades, i.e., things of the world, and be
engaged in praising thy Lord, so that His Holy Spirit
may assist thee, may make thee a sign of faith and
illumine thy heart with the light of assurance and
that thou mayest become a sign of peace and a servant
of reconciliation, love and security.  Verily, my Merciful
Lord is gracious under all aspects!
     As to thy question concerning Christ"  Know thou,
He was perfect in respect to spirit as well as body.
His material (body) was a perfect body in every respect;
none of His material conditions were imperfect.
His heavenly condition was also a perfect
at all, inasmuch as imperfection is contrary to perfection.
His heavenly condition was also a perfect
one, comprising all the divine perfections.  Reflect thou
upon these words, so that the door of knowledge may
be opened before thy face.


O thou maid-servant of God who art attracted to the
     Fragrances of God!

     Speak of my servitude unto God, of my humbleness
and submissiveness to the Beloved of God, and of my
evanescence, nothingness and utter meekness to the
Threshold of Baha'.  Verily, I am the servant of
Baha', the slave of Baha' and the captive of Baha'.
I have no grade but this and I do not possess anything


+P 604
for myself.  Therefore, mention me in my pure servitude;
this is that by which my heart is dilated by
every maid-servant who speaks the praise of God.  I
beseech God to make thee a dove in the grove of holiness,
to coo with the most wonderful melodies the praise
of thy Lord, the Merciful!


O thou who art ablaze with the fire of the Love of
     God!

     As to thy vision that thou wert traveling to Acca in
a ship with the maid-servant of God .........:  this
ship is the ship of the Covenant, which is surrounded
by the winds of discord from the people of hypocrisy.
Be rejoiced that ye two are preserved and have reached
the shore of salvation.
     Know thou, verily, the winds of confirmation shall
surely surround the Ark of Deliverance, the sails of
the covenant shall be unfurled, and it shall reach the
shore of the Kingdom of God.  Blessed art thou, for
thou hast entered this Ark and art saved from
afflictions!
     As to what thou hast seen in the dream, concerning
the letter which reached thee from me, and angels were
enclosed in it and they surrounded thee:  Know thou
verily, that letter is this glorious writing whereby I
address thee; and, verily, this is full of angels of confirmation
from the Kingdom off God and they will assist
thee to serve the Cause of God in the vineyard of God.


O thou seeing one!

     Know thou, verily, God hath preferred the insight to
the sight, because the sight seeth the material things,


+P 605
while the insight apprehendeth the spiritual.  the former
witnesseth the earthly world, while the latter seeth
the world of the Kingdom.  The former's judgment is
temporary, while the latter's vision is everlasting.  Thou
shalt soon behold the Kingdom of God and its mysteries
and the signs of God and the lights of His great Realm
of Divinity!


O thou who art speaking the praise of god in that vast
     and extensive region!

     Thank God, who hath raised such women from the
essences of the love of God in that distant place and
hath made them as fountains of knowledge, sources of
assurance and dawning-places of the commemoration
of thy Lord, the Merciful!  I beg of God to strengthen
them through the most strong power, by the hosts
rushing forth from the kingdom of El-Abha and by
the angels successively coming from heaven.  Verily,
He is the Assister, the Beneficient!
     As to thy question concerning the husband and wife,
the tie between them and the children given to them
by God:  Know thou, verily, the husband is one who
hath sincerely turned unto God, is awakened by the
call of the Beauty of El-Baha and chanteth the verses
of Oneness in the great assemblies; the wife is a being
who wisheth to be overflowing with and seeketh after
the attributes of God and His names; and the tie between
them is none other than the Word of God.  Verily,
it [the Word of God] causeth the multitudes to assemble
together and the remote ones to be united.
Thus the husband and wife are brought into affinity,
are united and harmonized, even as though they were


+P 606
one person.  Through their mutual union, companionship
and love great results are produced in the world,
both material and spiritual.  The spiritual result is the
appearance of divine bounties.  The material result is
the children who are born in the cradle of the love of
God, who are nurtured by the breast of knowledge
of God, who are brought up in the bosom of the gift of
God, and who are fostered in the lap of the training
of God.  Such children are those of whom it was said
by Christ, "Verily, they are the children of the Kingdom!"
     Consequently, O thou maid-servant of God, go unto
the maid-servants of the Merciful one and tell them
from the tongue of Abdul-Baha:  "O maid-servants
of the Merciful!  It is incumbent upon you to train the
children from their earliest babyhood!  It is incumbent
upon you to beautify their morals!  It is incumbent
upon you to attend to them under all aspects and circumstances,
inasmuch as God - glorified and exalted is He!
- hath ordained mothers to be the primary trainers of
children and infants.  This is a great and important
affair and a high and exalted position, and it is not
allowable to slacken therein at all!
     If thou walkest in this right path, thou wouldst become
a real mother to the children, both spiritually
and materially.  I beg of God to make thee severed
from this world, attracted to the fragrances of sanctity
which are being diffused from the garden of the Kingdom
of El-Abha, and a servant of the Cause of God
in the vineyard of God.
     Greeting and high respects to the maid-servant of
God Miss........., who is attracted, enkindled, hath


+P 607
spoken and called out, and hath stripped herself from
the garment of dependence of this mortal world and its
concerns and is clothed with the embroidered garments
of separation (from the world) in this great Paradise.


O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!

     Know thou that some of the souls who arrive at this
Blessed Spot possess hearing, seeing and smelling; they
see what no eye hath ever seen, they hear the melodies
of the Dove of Holiness on the Tree of Life, they inhale
the fragrances of God from this Garden, and they
surely realize that, verily, this Blessed Spot is a center
for pure seeing and strong hearing and is the direction
from which the breezes of the Holy Spirit blow.
     But those who have neither seeing not hearing apprehend
nothing and say what they understand not.
     As to thee and thy daughter who is devoted to god,
who presented herself, saw and heard:  Know ye, verily,
(one possessing) a pure insight is a servant to the
people of Baha', but only the prudent can understand
this.
     Know thou, verily, insight (or mental perception)
seeth that which sight (or physical perception) seeth
not and apprehendeth that which the body perceiveth
not, inasmuch as the sight seeth the mirage as water,
the images pictured in the mirror as a reality and genuine,
and it seeth the earth as stationary, the great stars
as small.  But the insight correcteth the mistake of
the sight and apprehendeth the reality and seeth that
the mirage is not water, that the images pictured in
mirrors are naught else save mere reflections, that the
earth is moving and the distant stars are great.  Consequently,


+P 608
the truth of insight, its effectiveness and power
is proven, as well as the weakness of sight, its inefficiency
and defects.
     Then, know thou that the power of the Word of God
is effective, both in the spirit and the body, and the influence
of the spirit of god is predominant over the
material as well as the essential and spiritual.  And
that, verily, God is powerful in all things, and that the
signs (or verses) have exoteric and esoteric meaning,
and neither their outward preventeth their inward, nor
doth their inward prevent their outward meaning.
     Greeting and praise to the maid-servant of God, thy
revered daughter, and to all who commemorate the
praise of god, long for the Kingdom of God and are
cheerfully moved by the fragrances of God!


O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!

     Consider not thy capacity and merit, nay rather consider
the grace of thy Lord, the Clement, the Merciful.
Verily, thy Lord confirmeth whomsoever He willeth of
His servants, through the glad-tidings of the Kingdom,
the signals of clemency and the spiritual fragrances.
forsake every commemoration and thought in
the cell of oblivion (i.e., forget everything) and confine
thy days and time in preaching the Kingdom of
God, spreading the teachings of god and igniting the
lights of guidance in the hearts which are awaiting the
Kingdom of God.  Truly, I say unto thee, to be engaged
in diffusing the fragrance of God (teaching the
Truth) for one hour of time is better than the dominion
of the world and all therein; for the latter is mortal
and temporary, while the former is permanent and


+P 609
endless.  This is the day of Life, the day of Salvation
and the day of Bestowal; it is not the day of death,
unless it be martyrdom in the path of God, or embracing
the cross in the love of God.


O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!

     As to thy question, "If the husband preventeth his
wife from entering into the Light, or the wife preventeth
the husband from entering into the Kingdom of
God:"  In reality neither one of them preventeth the
other from entering into the Kingdom of God, except
when the husband hath a great attachment to the wife,
or the wife to the husband.  When either one of the
two adoreth the other to the exclusion of God, then
each will prevent the other from entering into the Kingdom
of God.
     As to thy question concerning the additions to the
Old and New Testament:  Know thou, verily, as people
could not understand the words, nor could they apprehend
the realities therein, therefore they have translated
them according to their own understanding and
interpreted the verses after their own ideas and thus the
text fell into confusion.  This is undoubtedly true.  As
to an intentional addition:  This is something uncertain.
But they have made great mistakes as to the
understanding of the texts and the comprehending of
the references and have therefore fallen into doubts,
especially in regard to the symbolical verses.
     As to thy question, "That Abdul-Baha hath said to
some of the believers that evil never exists, nay rather,
it is a non-existent thing:"  This is but truth, inasmuch
as the greatest evil is (man's) going astray and being

+P 610
veiled from Truth.  Error is lack of guidance; darkness
is absence of light; ignorance is lack of knowledge;
falsehood is lack of truthfulness; blindness is lack of
sight; and deafness is lack of hearing.  Therefore, error,
blindness, deafness and ignorance are non-existent
things.  If we say that according to the text of the
bible, "God hardened Pharaoh's heart" that he
not believe in Moses, this signifies that, verily, He did
not soften his heart.  And when we wish to say that
God hath not guided a certain one of His servants, this
would be interpreted (by people) that God led him
astray.  The darkness spoken of in the Bible as being
created by God, signifieth that, verily, God hath not
caused light to shine; inasmuch as where there is no
light, there will be darkness; when there is no sight,
there will be blindness; when there is no life, there ill
be death; when there is no riches, there will be poverty;
and when there is no knowledge, there will be ignorance.
     Consequently, it is proven by indisputable argument
and clear explanation that, verily, evils are non-existent,
but people have not understood the meaning of the
verses of the Bible.
     I beg of God to make thee a faithful servant in His
great vineyard, enable thee to speak His praise, to
diffuse His fragrances, to chant His verses and to herald
His name at every moment.


O thou who art rejoiced at the explanation of the maid-servant
     of God .........!

     Thank thou god that He hath sent forth unto thee
such a spiritual and loving sister, who is preserved from
egotism and desires and is rejoiced at the glad-tidings


+P 611
of God.  Can there be imagined any greater mercy
than this?  No! by the One who hath created the
heaven and earth!  Blessed thou art, for thou hast inhaled
the fragrances of life from the garden of the
Kingdom of El-Baha before thine ears had heard the
call!
     As to ......... whom thou hast mentioned, it
behooveth him to seek only the divine bounties and
subjects which lead to the real knowledge of the invisible
(world of god), through the mediation of the
Holy spirit.  Then he will perceive the reality of the
triune powers in man, through his innate perception.
For, verily, the sign of these triune powers which exist
in mankind are spirit, mind and soul.  The spirit is the
power of life, the mind is the power which apprehendeth
the reality of things, and the soul is an intermediary
between the Supreme Concourse (or Spiritual World)
and the lower concourse (or material world).  It, i.e.,
the soul, hath two phases:  The higher aspireth to the
Kingdom of El-Baha, and the lights of the mind shine
forth from that horizon (or kingdom) unto its higher
sphere; the other phase inclineth to the lower concourse
of the material world and its lowest sphere is enveloped
in the darkness of ignorance.  But when light is poured
upon this phase, and if this phase of the soul is capable
of receiving it, then "truth hath come and falsehood
vanisheth, for falsehood is of short duration" -
otherwise, darkness will surround it from all directions
and it will be deprived of association with the Supreme
Concourse and will remain in the lowest depths.
     As to the "voice:"  There are two kinds of voices.
One is the physical voice and it is expressed by atmospheric


+P 612
vibrations which affect the nerves of the ear;
the other is the breath of the Merciful, and this is a
call which is continually heard from the Supreme Concourse
and cheereth the pure and holy souls.  May it
be beneficial to those who have heard the Call!
     Know thou that the Ancient Light and the Manifest
Beauty (God) hath sown seeds in the soil of existence
and hath irrigated it through His spiritual bounties.
This soil will surely bring forth good plants of divine
gifts; the leaves of this growth are love and union, its
stem is the teachings of the True One and His supreme
laws, and the grain pods are the heavenly blessings
which giveth life to the souls.  Depend thou on these!
Depend thou on these!  Depend thou on this, and abandon
every imagination and be attracted to the light of
reality and discover both the divine truths and physical
truths!
     also, know thou that the greatest spiritual and divine
"chaplet" is the Word of God and the Sun of Truth
which penetrateth the reality of the created things and
attracteth the entire soul of man in the world of existence
and shineth forth unto all horizons (or regions).
Hast thou ever perceived a greater "chaplet" than this?
No! by the Splendor of Baha'!
     Verily, I yearn for the visit of those souls who are
cheered, dilated and moved by and attracted to the
Holy Spirit and the Word of God.


O thou who art awakened to the Cause of God!

     Verily, I read thy letter and my heart was rejoiced
at thine interesting words; and I thanked God for
He hath favored those souls who earnestly desire to


+P 613
guard His strongly fortified fortress and His inaccessible
cave and who love unity, affinity, harmony and
accord and who agree on one opinion, one idea and one
word.  This behooveth the sincere souls!  This behooveth
such as believe in the divine unity!  This
behooveth such as are firm and steadfast in the Covenant,
which is throbbing within the heart of the whole
creation!
     Be ye guardians of the throne of the Kingdom of
God and armies of defense for the Religion of God.
Whenever ye find someone desiring to separate himself
from the flock, it is incumbent upon you to treat him
with fragrance and kindness and persuade and encourage
him, so that this secluded sheep may return to the
flock.
     Verily, thy Lord loveth union and hateth discord; for
the appearance of the Holy Manifestations and divine
laws is only for the sake of affinity, union and concord,
so that the remote, contradictory and different
nations and creeds may enter under the shadow of the
Blessed Tree in unanimous love and agreement.
     I bed of god to confirm all of His dearly beloved
ones in one opinion, one belief, one movement, one
path and one manner.  This is that by which the station
of the beloved ones will be elevated, the Word of
God will be promoted, the fragrances of God will be
diffused and the faces of the sincere ones will be illuminated
in the path of God.  It is incumbent upon you to
practice these [instructions] under all aspects and
circumstances.
     As to the manifestation of the Greatest Name
(Baha'o'llah):  This was the Divine Manifestation


+P 614
which appeared upon the earthly world.  This is He
whom God promised in all His Books and Scriptures,
such as the Bible, the gospels and the Koran.  All
of these Books indicate this fact, and the least doubt
cannot possibly occur to the minds concerning this clear
fact, as is recorded in detail in the heavenly Books, especially
in the brilliant and holy Tablets.  But notwithstanding
this fact, if there is anyone who hesitates
therein, do not dispute with him, nay rather prove this
to him with all joy and fragrance, lest he may be obstinately
compelled to rebellion.


O my God!  O my God!

     Praise be unto Thee! for Thou hast created me of
the most excellent fabric, in the most honored form,
and in the most exalted kind of Thy creation; didst
nurture me from the breast of Thy favor, didst nurse
me in the bosom of Thy mercy, until I grew up under
the protection of Thy divinity, in the cradle of Thy training,
and reached full growth through Thy favor
and grace.  Then Thou hast made me to experience
various circumstances and suffer countless calamities,
afflictions and troubles in myself and griefs in my soul.
Thou hast (finally) guided me to the fountain of Thy
favor and illumined my sight through the light of Thy
guidance, quickened by spirit with Thy fragrances of
holiness and moved my heart with the breeze of the
garden of Thy favor.  Then I became rejoiced at the
appearance of Thy Beauty, the rising of Thy Lights and
the dawning of the morn of Thy Oneness.  Thou hast
delivered me from the depths of sorrows, saved me from
the darkness of griefs and dilated my breast by showing


+P 615
unto me Thy greatest Signs in the Day of Resurrection.
O my Lord!  Engage me in Thy love,
[enable me] to cut myself from aught else save Thee,
to be consumed with the love of Thy Beauty, to burn
with the fire of love for Thy Face, so that I may be
entirely drawn unto Thee and become enkindled by the
fire ablaze in the Sinaiatic Tree.  O my Lord!
Verily, with Thee I am free from all else, while turning
unto Thy Glorious Kingdom.  Deliver me from
every gloomy sorrow; shelter me under the protection
of Thy greatest favor; save me from my attachment
to this inferior world.  O my Lord!  Verily, I am
humble; elevate me through Thy greatest bounty!  I
am poor; enrich me by Thine abundant treasury!  I am
ill; heal me by Thy precious antidote and make me as
a sign of Thy favor among Thy maid-servants!  Verily,
Thou art powerful to do that which Thou willest!
Verily, Thou art Potent and Mighty!


O my Lord!   O my Lord!

     Verily, I am one of Thy maid-servants, supplicating
humbly before the Door of Thy Singleness, beseeching
and humbling myself to Thee!  O my Lord!  Thanks
be unto Thee for Thy greatest guidance and Thy greatest
favor, which Thou hast assigned unto me and unto
Thy worshipping maid-servants, whom Thou hast
chosen to enter Thine exalted Kingdom and abide in
Thy Paradise of El-Abha.  O my Lord!  Sanctify me
from every worldly station in this primal life and purify
me from all else save Thee, O Thou Great Giver!
Exhilarate me with the wine of Thy love, O Thou Brilliant
Countenance!  Intoxicate me with the wine of


+P 616
sanctity, purity, unity and singleness, O Thou who attractest
the hearts of the righteous by the magnet of
favors, unto the Kingdom of El-Abha!  O my Lord!
Cause me to speak Thy praise, illumine my sight
through the light of Thy knowledge, cause me to hear
Thy Call, and quicken me with the spirit of Thy grace.
Make me rejoiced at the melodies of the birds of Thy
holiness, and make me a servant to Thy maid-servants.
Cause my soul to be tranquilized, my heart attached,
and my mind drawn to the light of thy guidance,
which is shining unto all regions; so that I may walk
in the path of Thy good pleasure, yield to Thy decree
and be rejoiced at the most violent calamities, and that
my breast may become dilated during every tribulation,
even though the suffering is beyond endurance.  Verily,
thou art the Holy, the Pure, the Potent, the Powerful,
the Exalted, the Great!


My Lord!  My Lord!

     Thou hast caused me to hear the Call, guided me
unto the sea of favor, awakened me through Thy fragrant
breeze, and quickened me by the spirit of Thy
greatest guidance.  I thank and praise Thee for this.
O my Lord!  O my Lord!  Verily, I am athirst; do
cause me to drink from the fountain of Thy grace.  O
my Lord!  O my Lord!  Verily, I am ill; do heal me
by the antidote of Thy mercy. O my Lord!  O my
Lord!  Verily, I am sick; do Thou cure me through Thy favor.
O my Lord!  O my Lord!  I am needy; do enrich me
through Thy compassion.  And I am poor; render me
prosperous by the treasury of Thy Kingdom.  O my
Lord!  O my Lord!  Increase my hope in the court of


+P 617
Thy holiness, and grant my wishes by thy favor and
grace.  Confirm me to deliver Thy Cause, enable me to
call in Thy Name, and cause me to show forth the
proofs of Thy Manifestation.  Strengthen me to promote
Thy Word, dilate my breast by serving Thy
maid-servants and being humble and submissive before
Thy beloved ones.  O my Lord!  Verily, I am impotent;
do strengthen me by Thy power.  I am lost in
indigence; do confer on me Thy greatest favor.  Make
me as one of the maid-servants who diffuse Thy fragrances,
who worship Thy Kingdom, who bow down in
the worshipping-places of Thy unity, who kneel down
on every dust which is related to the threshold of Thy
beloved ones, and who serve in Thy vineyard, speak
Thy praise and are attracted to Thy love.  Verily,
Thou are the Giver, the Powerful, the Mighty!


O my God!  O my God!

     This, thy servant, is turning unto Thee, relying upon
Thee and is believing in Thee and in Thy great signs.
He hath indeed traversed lands and seas, desiring to
reach Thy brilliant Holy Land and Thy perfuming
dust, and hath advanced toward the lofty court of Thy
mercy to worship Thine Exalted Word.  O my God!
Assist him, through the One Mighty in Power, to
obey Thy command, to walk in the path of Thy good
pleasure to supplicate before the Kingdom of Thy Oneness,
to become severed from all else save Thee, to
beseech Thy might, to be consumed by Thy love and
to spread Thy commemoration, O Thou who grantest
the wishes of every supplicant!  Verily, Thou art the
Powerful, the Mighty!


+P 618
O my God!  O my God!

     This, Thy servant, hath advanced toward Thee, is
passionately wandering in the desert of Thy love, walking
in the path of Thy service, anticipating Thy favors,
hoping for Thy bounty, relying upon Thy Kingdom,
and being exhilarated with the wine of Thy gift.  O my
God!  Increase his fervor in Thy passion, his constancy
in Thy praise and his ardor in Thy love.  Verily, Thou
art the Beneficient and endowed with great bounty!
There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the
Merciful!


O my Lord!  O my Lord!

     This is a lamp lighted by the fire of Thy love and
ablaze with the flame which is ignited in the tree of Thy
mercy.  O my Lord!  Increase his enkindlement, heat and
flame, with the fire which is kindled in the Sinai of Thy
Manifestation.  Verily, Thou art the Confirmer, the
Assister, the Powerful, the Generous, the Loving!


O my Lord, my Beloved, my Desire!

     Befriend me in my loneliness and accompany me in
my exile; remove my sorrow, cause me to be devoted to
Thy Beauty, withdraw me from all else save Thee, attract
me through Thy fragrances of holiness, cause me
to be associated in Thy Kingdom with those who are
severed from all else save Thee and who long to serve
Thy Sacred Threshold and who stand to work in Thy
Cause, and enable me to be one of Thy maid-servants
who have attained to Thy good pleasure.  verily, Thou
art the Gracious, the Generous!


+P 619
O my Lord!+F1

     Thou knowest that the people are encircled with pain
and calamities and are environed with hardships and
trouble.  Every trial doth attack man and every dire
adversity doth assail him like unto the assault of a
serpent.  There is no shelter and asylum for him except
under the wing of Thy protection, preservation,
guard and custody.
     O Thou the Merciful One!  O my Lord!  Make
Thy protection my armory, Thy preservation my shield,
humbleness before the door of Thy Oneness my guard,
and Thy custody and defense my fortress and abode.
Preserve me from the suggestions of myself and desire,
and guard me from every sickness, trial, difficulty and
ordeal.
     Verily, Thou art the Protector, the Guardian, the
Preserver, the Sufficer, and verily, Thou art the Merciful
of the Most Merciful!


O thou who art advancing unto God!

     Verily, I read thy letter and noted its contents.  Rest
assured in the bounty of thy Lord.  Verily, He confirmeth
whomsoever He willeth in all aspects and conditions.
     I supplicate God to sustain thee and thine honorable
husband, to open for you the door of comfort and rest
and protect you from the harm of every hateful one.
     If thou wishest to guide the souls, it is incumbent
on thee to be firm, to be good and to be imbued with
praiseworthy attributes and divine qualities under all

circumstances.  Be a sign of love, a manifestation of
mercy, a fountain of tenderness, kind-hearted, good to
all and gentle to the servants of God, and especially to
those who bear relation to thee, both men and women.
Bear every ordeal that befalleth thee from the people
and confront them not save with kindness, with great
love and good wishes.


O thou lamp glowing with the fire of the Love of
     God!

Know that the garden drew near and the paradise
hath been adorned with the sweet-basils of the knowledge
of God.  Be, therefore, a gilly-flower of fragrant
smell in the Garden of El-Abha, that, through thy perfumed
breaths, the spirits and hearts be quickened and
animated.
     O thou friend of Abdul-Baha!  I do mention thee
now while my heart is throbbing through the breezes
that are blowing from the verdant gardens of the love
of God.  Accordingly, it is incumbent upon thee to be
purely sincere, to turn to the holy Kingdom and to
generously give the spirit in the cause of the Lord of
Might.  Verily, this is no other than an eternal and
everlasting life which hath no end in the world of
existence.


O thou fragrant rose blooming in the Garden of Guidance!

     Thank thou God for that He hath removed from off
thine eyes the covering, made thee to see the signs of
the Kingdom of thy Lord, the supreme, filled for thee
the cup of bounty and gave thee to drink the pure wine


+P 621
of fidelity which He hath promised to the sincere in the
holy Books and Tablets.
     O thou my dear!  The cup of knowledge is overflowing;
blessed are they who partake in draughts!  The
fountain of life is issuing forth; blessed are they who
drink!  The doors of the Kingdom are opened; O what
good news to those who advance!  The garden of
paradise is drawn near; O what a pleasure to those who
enter!  The dove of holiness is cooing; O what a happiness
to those who hear!  The gates of heaven are open;
blessed are they who see!  The hosts of angels are
standing in battle order; what a joy to those who gain
the victory!  The trumpet of life is sounding; how good
it is to those who are awake!
     As to thee:  Realize the bounty of thy Lord as it is,
and thank thou thy Lord and praise Him for that He
hath directed thee to the right path.


O thou who art controlled by the attractions of the
     Fragrance of God!

     Thy terse and eloquent letter, showing the excess of
thine attraction as caused by the fragrances of god, was
read by me.
     I, therefore, supplicate God to confirm thy glorious
children, Frederick, Robert and Herbert, to surround
them with the glances of His merciful eye, to direct
them to the path of guidance and to make them enter
the Ark of Safety which is cleaving the sea of this
contingent world in the midst of the deluge of tests;
that they may become righteous, guiding the people to
the Kingdom of the glorious Lord, the doors of which
are open before the faces of all beings.


+P 622
     I implore Him to appoint thee one of the angels of
the Spirit, that thou mayest blow the spirit of life into
the hearts which are good and pure through the love of
God; that He may strengthen the elect in America to
spread the fragrances of God and to reveal the spirit
of knowledge to the hearts which are cheered by the
breaths of God.


O ye dear children!+F1

     Your father is compassionate, clement and merciful
unto you and desireth for you success, prosperity and
eternal life in the Kingdom of God.  Therefore, it
is incumbent upon you, dear children, to seek his good
pleasure, to be guided by his guidance, to be drawn
by the magnet of the love of God and be brought up
in the lap of the love of God; that ye may become
beautiful branches in the Garden of El-Abha, verdant
and watered by the abundance of the gift of God.


O thou advancer to the Kingdom of God!

     Shouldst thou come with the whole of thy being to
God and be attracted to the lights of the Kingdom of
God and be enkindled by the fire of the love, of God, then
wilt thou see that which thou canst not see today, wilt
comprehend the inner significance of the Word of God
and thoroughly understand the mysteries contained in
the holy books.
     But as to the Jewish doctors, Christian priests and
monks who read those Books, verily, they know the
letter only and they utter the words, as parrots, without
understanding their inner meanings.  They comprehend

+P 623
them not, because they are engrossed in worldly
desires and lusts and their hearts are attached to mundane
allurements.  Verily, are they not heedless of God and
understand nothing and find not the right path?

     +F1 Announce on my behalf respectful greeting to the
maid-servant of god, Madam ........., and say:
     "Praise be to god! that thy house hath become the
nest and the shelter of the divine birds and thy face
is illumined and brightened by the light of the love of
God and thy tongue is loosened in uttering heavenly
proofs and evidences.  Therefore, in order to [give]
thanks for this bestowal, add, day by day, to thy love
of God and be thou engaged in service."


O thou seeker of Truth!

     Praise be to God! the essence of severance is manifest
from this world and the star of the love of God is
shining, and kindness towards mankind is clear and
evident.  These divine gifts became manifest, spread
and known in the world through the teachings of Baha'o'llah.
I hope thou mayest abundantly partake of all
there three benefits, so that thou mayest appear among
people in the utmost spirituality and illumination.


O thou excellent maid-servant of God!

     Thank thou God that thou hast stepped into the arena
of existence in this glorious age, hast become the manifestor
of never-ending outpouring, hast attained to the
most great gift, hast found the season of the divine

+P 624
springtime, hast perfumed thy nostrils with heavenly
flowers, hast discovered the way to the celestial Kingdom
and hast partaken a share from eternal life.


O thou daughter of the Kingdom!

     Thy excellent letter was full of spiritual significance.
It was an indication of the loftiness of thy nature, the
grandeur of thy aspiration, the sincerity of thy aim
and the confirmation of the bounty of His Highness
the Single One.  Moreover, it proved that thou shalt
be purified and sanctified from attachment to material
conditions, be freed from every restriction and thou
shalt dedicate thy life to the spreading of the glad-tidings
of the Kingdom.
     Whenever this longing and desire is attained, that
maid-servant of God [i.e., thyself] will become a
lighted candle in the assemblage of the world, receiving
the lights of the Kingdom and reflecting them in turn
upon the souls.
     This trip thou hast in mind is blessed and acceptable
and the cause of the attainment of everlasting glory
in the world of existence, but thou shouldest have a
companion to go with thee.  Therefore, start thou with
a firm resolution, pure intention, heavenly glad-tidings,
divine gift and supreme confirmation toward the East,
i.e., Japan, China, India, Russia, Greece, Bulgaria,
Roumania, Austria, Germany, France and the English
empires, perchance thou mayest spread the fragrances
of God in those parts and receive the lights of confirmation
from the Kingdom of Holiness.  But it is not
necessary, for the present, to travel in the Turkish,
Egyptian and Persian territories, for internal troubles


+P 625
make the traveling of women very difficult.  It is hoped,
from the eminent bounty and favor of God, that thou
mayest be quickened in such wise, from the fragrances
of the Kingdom of Abha, that thou mayest bestow upon
dead souls eternal life.
     Convey, on my behalf, respectful greetings to the
attracted Miss ........., who is favored and enkindled
with the fire of the love of her Lord.  That
blessed leaf is mentioned and known in the Kingdom of
God.***
     As Persia hath many nomadic tribes and they are
now+F1 rebellious and insurgent and infesting the highways,
the maid-servants of the Merciful cannot travel
there, but men can.  However, after that maid-servant
hath traveled in Japan, China, Russia, Germany, France,
England, Austria, Greece, Roumania, Bulgaria and
India, perhaps peace and security will be established in
Persia and then thou canst also travel there.


O thou daughter of the Kingdom!

     Thank thou God for having found the realm of the
Kingdom, become guided by the lights of the Sun of
Reality and guided others.
     Endeavor day and night in order to make the negligent
souls mindful, to give life to the dead spirits, to heal
the spiritual patients, to make wise the simple, to inform
the uninformed, to make the earthly heavenly, to draw
nigh (unto God) those who are afar and to make the
strangers friends.
     This is the magnetic power which attracts the confirmation
of God.

1.  Revealed during 1908.
+P 626
O thou favored maid-servant of the Kingdom of God!

     The letter, which thou hast written, was received.  Its
contents evinced high aspiration and rare magnanimity;
and that thou hast the intention to travel to the far-eastern
countries and bear great trouble, so that thou
mayest become the cause of the guidance of the souls
and spread the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of God.
This desire indicateth that the beloved maid-servant of
God hath a very high aim.  However, thou mayest deliver
the glad-tidings in the following manner:
     "The Promised One of all the nations of the world
hath become apparent and manifest!  Each community
and religion expecteth the coming of their Promised One,
and His Highness Baha'o'llah is the Promised One
of all!  Therefore, the Cause of Baha'o'llah is conductive
to harmony, raiseth the canopy of the oneness of
the kingdom of humanity upon the apex of the contingent
beings and unfurleth the ensign of universal
brotherhood and ideal commonwealth upon the summit
of the hills and mountains!"
     When thou openest thy tongue with such glad-tidings,
it will become conducive to the teaching of others.
But this trip is indeed very remote and unless there are
several [teachers], the delivery of the glad-tidings will
not produce the desired results in those parts.  Shouldst
thou deem it advisable, thou mayest take a trip to Persia
and on thy return pass by Japan and China.  This plan
seems much better and more pleasant.  Otherwise, thou
mayest act according to thy judgment and it will be acceptable.
     The contribution that thou hast made to the Temple
is beloved.  The Temple is the most great foundation


+P 627
of the world of humanity and it hath many branches.
Although the Temple is the place of worship, with it is
connected a hospital, pharmacy, pilgrims' house, school
for the orphans, and a university for the study of high
sciences.  Every Temple is connected with these five
things.  I hope that now in America they will build a
Temple and gradually add to it the hospital, school, university,
pharmacy and pilgrims' house with the utmost
efficiency and thoroughness.  Thou shouldst make known
to the believers these details, so that they may realize
how important the Temple is.  The Temple is not only
a place for worship; nay, it is perfect in every way.
     O thou beloved maid-servant of God!  Didst thou
know what station is destined and appointed, under the
protection of His Highness Baha'o'llah, for those
souls who are severed, attracted and teachers of truth,
undoubtedly thou shouldst find the utmost joy and happiness,
and, by reason of exultation and rejoicing, soar
toward the heaven of peace, inasmuch as thou art walking
in this road and advancing toward such a Kingdom.
     Regarding the statement that I have written to thee,
about dedicating thyself to the service of the Cause of
God, it means this:  Center thy thoughts in the teachings
of the Cause, day and night, and act according to the
teachings and behests of His Highness Baha'o'llah.
This is not contrary to marriage.  It is possible for thee
to be married and be engaged in the service of the Cause
of God.  The first does not interfere with the latter.
     Briefly, avail thyself of the opportunity and do not
let it slip from thy grasp; i.e., supplicate God that in
this darkened world thou mayest become an ignited
candle and the cause of the guidance of many souls.


+P 628
O ye blessed maid-servant+F1 of the Beauty of Abha!

     If ye have written letters to Abdul-Baha and answers
to them are delayed, know ye of a certainty that untold
hindrances have been the cause.  Be ye not unhappy.
Praise be to God! that, on account of firmness and steadfastness
in the Cause of God and service to the Word of
God, spiritual letters are continually and uninterruptedly
descending from the Supreme Concourse and the Kingdom
of Abha.  That holy Messenger is eternal and
perennial and His messages come to the heart successively
and the verses of oneness are read therein.  Likewise,
this imprisoned one is greatly attached with his
heart and soul to the beloved ones and this very attachment
is the faithful Messenger and the manifest Tablet.
Therefore, my request is this:  Should ye send a hundred
letters and no answers be received, do ye not feel
at all sad; nay, rather think of this occurrence as a
glorious proof of the power of love, as it will demonstrate
that there is no incumbency (or formality) between
us.  Were there any opportunity, undoubtedly
answers would be forwarded.  In brief, I beg of God
that each one of you become the sign of guidance, a
manifest book from the Supreme Concourse, attracted
with the fragrances of God and enkindled with the fire
of the love of God.


O thou pure and spiritual one!

     Turn thou toward God with thy heart beating with
His love, devoted to His praise, gazing toward His
Kingdom and seeking help from His Holy Spirit in a
state of ecstasy, rapture, love, yearning, joy and fragrance.

God will assist thee, through a Spirit from
His Presence, to heal sickness and diseases.


O thou who art turning toward the Kingdom of God!

     I have read thy letter of clearest composition.  I beg
of God to make thee fluent in tongue, pure in heart,
strong in spirit, severed in heart from all else save
God and occupied in the praise of God; to continue in
prayer and supplication unto God, to be humble, meek,
spiritual, free from the earthly world and its concerns
and awakened to the Kingdom and its Manifestation.
Verily, thy Lord is powerful in all things!


O thou who art tranquilized by the Call of the Kingdom
     at this time!

     The meanings of thy words evinced thine abundant
attraction and thy turning unto the Lamp of Lights.
Be not grieved on account of lack of information of
the mysteries of this great Cause.  If thou keepest firm
in the religion of God, the covering shall be removed
for thee and thou shalt become informed of the allegories
and mysteries of the Kingdom of God.
     O maid-servants of God!  Continue in healing hearts
and bodies and seek healing for sick persons by turning
unto the Supreme Kingdom and by setting the heart
upon obtaining healing through the power of the
Greatest Name and by the spirit of the love of God.
     Verily, I beg of God to ordain perfect rest and composure
for thy revered daughter.
     As to your moving to another city:  Meditate thou,
perform the ablution and pray to God before sleeping;
and whatever the Merciful One may inspire unto thee


+P 630
at the time of revelation in a dream, that will be consistent
with obtaining thy wishes.  But the greatest
motive for the happiness (or felicity) of that family,
both in this world and the next one, is that thy revered
husband and thy dear son-in-law should become believers
in the lights of the Kingdom which have surrounded
all regions at this age of effulgence.


O thou who art yearning for the Glad-tidings of God!

     Verily, I was informed of the contents of thy letter
which showed that thine insight is opened, thy heart is
purified, that thou art baptized by the divine water and
by the lordly fire and spirit and that thou art born again
from the womb of this mortal world.  This is through
the grace of thy Lord, the Clement, the Merciful!
     As to the imprisonment of Abdul-Baha:  This is his
utmost wish, his extreme joy and this is what refreshes
his burning; and I do not long for deliverance from the
depths of this agreeable prison.  Verily, this Most Great
Prison is conducive unto the [shining of the] Orb of the
Horizons.+F1
     Verily, I beg of God to bless unto thee thy marriage
with thy revered husband, to protect thee under all conditions
from the violence of tests and trials and to make
thy feet firm in the Religion of God in this wonderful
(or new) age.


O thou who art attracted to the Kingdom!

     Mrs. ......... became the cause of thy life and suffered
thee to inhale of the rose-garden

thyself for her, for she became the means of thy

guidance and thou hast become the object of favor and
a center of the bounty of God.  She was thy guide to
the Kingdom and the cause of eternal life.  Supplicate
thou also from God that thou mayest walk in her footsteps
and become engaged in the training and guidance
of souls.
     Caress on my behalf the beloved maid-servant of
God, Miss ........., thy daughter, and convey to her
my respectful greetings.


O thou dear maid-servant of God!

     Thy letter was received.  Praise God! for thou didst
hear the call of the Kingdom, wast awakened, attentive
and attained faith in the Lord of Hosts.
     His Holiness Christ, addressing the believers, uttereth
the following in the Gospel:  "Be awake lest the
Son of Man come and find ye asleep!"  Now, thou
wast awake, therefore thou didst advance and engage
in the service of the Word of God.  Appreciate the
value of this attainment, and, like unto a candle, radiate
the light of the love of God in the meeting of the
beloved.  Encourage the beloved of God and be a
source of joy and gladness to the Bahais.  hold meetings
and read and chant the heavenly teachings, so that
city may be illumined with the light of reality and that
country become a veritable paradise by the strength
of the Holy Spirit, for this cycle is the cycle of the
Glorious Lord and the melody of oneness and solidarity
of the world of mankind must reach the ears of the
East and West.
     Convey greeting of reverence to all the maid-servants
of God and His man-servants.


+P 632
O ye friends+F1 of this prisoner!

     According to what is heard and evident, you have
arranged an assembly in the utmost beauty and a number
of you present yourselves in that meeting with all
love and unity and engage in communion (i.e., reading
of the communes), chanting of the verses, spiritual
conversation and utterance of the Kingdom.  Blessed
are ye for having adorned such a meeting and for
having prepared such a feast!  That gathering receiveth
bounty from the Supreme Concourse and that nucleus
is under the protection of the Bounty of Abha.
     In thanksgiving for this attainment and confirmation
you must strive to make Boston a fruit-garden+F2 and a
rose-garden.  Verily, this is not difficult with the Lord.
     the beloved of God in this mortal world are each
a spiritual trumpet.  They breathe the breath of life
and thus confer upon them that are dead in negligence
and ignorance, the life eternal.  They are the merciful
physicians who bestow upon the spiritual patients eternal
healing.
     The city of Boston hath great preparation (literally,
readiness), but the endeavor of the righteous is needed
and the efforts and strivings of the free are necessary.
For unless the seed is sown, the bounty and blessing
will not be attained; until the tree be planted, the fresh
fruit will not be produced; unless the candle contact
with fire, it will not ignite; and until a light dawn, the
darkness will not vanish.  Therefore, the beloved of
God must sow the seeds and plant the fresh plants in

that garden.  They must ignite the extinguished candles
so that the purpose may be attained and the beloved
intent unveil its face.
     In the spirit of humility and supplication do I beg
and implore at the Divine Threshold and seek for you
assistance and providence.


O thou near servant to the Threshold of God!

     Thy letter was received and thy desire became known.
Thou wishest to serve the Threshold of God.  I wish
for thee the same.  Therefore, copy the Tablets and
spread them among the beloved.  The meanings of
those leaves are the spiritual table, the heavenly blessing
and the means for the life eternal.
     Thou hast written concerning the organization of
a council for the building of the Mashrak-el-Azcar.
This news brought much spirit and fragrance, for the
nine delegates, sent by the various assemblies, gathered
in that meeting and consulted concerning the building
of the Mashrak-el-Azcar.
     The Mashrak-el-Azcar is the most important matter
and the greatest divine institute.  Consider how the
first institute of His Holiness Moses, after His exodus
from Egypt, was the "Tent of Martyrdom" which He
raised and which was the traveling Temple.  It was a
tent which they pitched in the desert, wherever they
aobde, and worshipped in it.  Likewise, after His Holiness
Christ - may the spirit of the world be a sacrifice
to Him! - the first institute by the disciples was a Temple.
They planned a church in every country.  Consider
the Gospel (read it) and the importance of the
Mashrak-el-Azcar will become evident.


+P 634
     In fine, I hope that all the beloved of God, collectively,
in the continent of America, men and women,
will strive night and day until the Mashrak-el-Azcar
be erected in the utmost solidity and beauty.


O thou who art attracted to the Kingdom!

     Thy likeness (photograph) was seen.  The Sun of
the Kingdom hath shed a light on thee, so thy likeness
is made radiant and thy face happy.
     Beneath the photograph the word "faithfully" was
inscribed which indicated that thine heart is attracted
to faithfulness and that thou seekest faithfulness.  No
attribute is more commmendable than faithfulness.  It
is of the greatest of the virtues in the world of humanity.
I hope that thou mayest be faithful to the Lord
of the Kingdom, be attracted to His Beauty, serve in
His Threshold and strive in His vineyard.


O ye two merciful assemblies!*\0

     Praise be to God! that through the outpouring of
guidance, India is rapidly becoming a Rose-garden of
Abha, for many souls have lately embraced the truth
and are in the utmost attraction and enkindlement.
     Forward ye, as soon as ye can, a few copies of every
Tablet and epistle which is translated into the English
and the books which are written by the believers, in this
language, to the merciful assembly of Bombay and to
his honor ......... in Rangoon.
     O ye spiritual friends of Abdul-Baha!  At this
moment when danger is threatening to surround all

    Assembly of Chicago and the Spiritual Assembly of New York."

directions, Abdul-Baha is attracted to the fragrances
of the Kingdom of Abha and with infinite joy and happiness
is begging providence and favor from the Threshold
of Oneness in your behalf.  Now is the time of
firmness and resolution and the moment of steadfastness
and constancy and the period of showing forth
divine power by the strength of proof, the solidity of
argument, the eloquence of utterance and the grandeur
of spirit!


O thou who art set aglow with the fire of the Love of
     God!

     The letter was received.  Thou hast commended the
meeting held at the home of Miss .........  In reality
it was a goodly meeting.  Although I was absent
in body, yet in life and heart I was present.
     it is as thou hast written:  Thy services at Green
Acre were accepted in the Kingdom of Abha.  Every
year a number of the beloved ones and the maid-sevants
of the Merciful must go to Green Acre and raise
the divine call there.  The more who go, the better.
     Convey greeting of reverence to the dear maid-servant
of God, Mrs. ......... I pray for her and
wish her the joy, the happiness, the tranquility of the
godly.
     Convey loving greeting to his honor Mr. .........
and say:  "It is hoped, through the favor and confirmation
of God, that thou mayest organize a spiritual
meeting at Leominster and become the cause of
guidance to many souls."
     O thou dear maid-servant of God, Florence!  Rest
assured in the bounty and favor of God.  I hope thou
wilt achieve great services.


+P 636
O thou advancer to God!

     Verily, I have read thy brilliant letter which is elegantly
composed.  I supplicate God to alleviate thy trials and
look upon thee with the eye of His mercy under all
aspects.  Turn thou to the Kingdom of thy great Lord
with a truthful heart and with all devotion, sincerity and
great spirituality and ask to be healed from pain and
passions and be confident in the great bounty of thy Lord.


O thou pure soul who art turning toward the Lord of
     the creatures!

     Verily, I received thy letter*** and was informed of
its meanings and contents which indicated thine humbleness
before God and thy meekness to His great realm
of might.
     O my dear one!  This day is the day of purification,
the day of sanctification, the day of turning toward God,
the day of severance from all else save God, the day of
lowliness and humiliation, the day of serving the beloved
ones of God, the day of becoming utterly destitute of
and free from egotism and desire and the day of purity
and sacrifice in the path of God.  This is incumbent upon
thee, so that thou mayest be accepted in the court of
the Almighty and praised in His lofty Threshold of
Holiness.


O thou whose heart is pure and whose souls is rejoiced!

     Verily, thy revered wife sent unto us thy photograph
and we say and rejoiced at witnessing thy face, even
though it was a (mere) image, for, verily, this image
indicateth the reality.  Verily, I saw in thine eyes the
sign of acuteness and thought.  Let thy thoughts be


+P 637
an eternal thought, a spiritual reflection and divinely
full of meaning.  This is but truth and there is naught
beyond truth except extinction.


O maid-servant of God!

     Thank thy Lord for confirming thee unto this wonderful
day and new century and giving thee to drink the
cup of His love with the hand of His providence.
Verily, this is a great favor.
     Be not sorrowful on account of the maid-servant of
God, Madam .........  This is a test on the part of
God and its wisdom (or reason) is concealed.  We ask
God to gaze on her with the eye of mercy.  Verily, He
is the Merciful, the Clement!


O thou who hath advanced to the Kingdom of his
     Lord, the Glorious!

     Know thou that the Kingdom of God hath pitched
its tents, hoisted its banner and uplifted its pavilions in
this extensive space.  The hosts of the angels of God
have come down with standards of signs; marched off
towards all horizons; opened the cities of the hearts of
the servants by the power of thy Lord, the Generous;
and have blown the great trumpet.  The Hoy Spirit
hath freely given eternal life to every pure heart, and
the souls became attracted through the effulgence of
the Beauty of the Glorious Kingdom and through the
brilliancy of the Light of Truth over all regions.  The
clamor of the spiritual people hath risen with praise
and glory to God, the All-glorious!
     As to thee, thank thou thy Lord for that He hath


+P 638
enabled to see the sins of His Kingdom in this
wonderful day.  Arise to serve the Cause of thy Lord
and devote thyself to God's service as a penitent
servant.


O thou servant of God!

     I was assuredly informed of thy confessing the unity
of God and that thou hast drawn from the ocean of the
gift of God and thine insight hath brightened by the
light of guidance and by the dependence of thine heart
upon the lights of the Beauty of God.  The, glad-tidings
be unto thee for this bounty which God hath
assigned unto every holy and spiritual being in the Kingdom
of God.
     By the life of God! verily, the gift of guidance, during
this great century and this age of lights, is greater than
reigning over the earth and all that is in it; because the
earthly reign is mortal, banishing, imaginary and of no
permanence; but this gift is permanent, eternal, everlasting
and endless.  consequently, it is confirmed that
this (gift of guidance) is greater than the sovereignty
of the world.
     O servant of God!  Rejoice, announce glad-tidings and
be filled with the Spirit and preach and call in the Name
of God in that region and hear the good-tidings of God
in that land!
     Thou shalt hear the sound of this glorious bell in every
near and distant region, and the call of the True One
will be elevated in the monasteries of the world of mankind,
just as it was elevated in the assmeblies of the
divine world, and the earthly people will be combined
with the divine and heavenly concourse.


+P 639
     Thereupon thy heart shall rejoice, thy soul shall become
pure, thine eye shall brighten and thou shalt be
inwardly revived.  Praise be upon thee!


O thou who art advancing unto the Face of God!

     Blessed art thou for that thou wert saved from the
storm of doubts, wert healed from all manner of
disease, wert rejoiced in spirit by the fragrances of God,
held firm to the love of God and God helped thee
through the trials.  This we heralded unto thee before
and it was an ordained and firm promise.
     Draw night unto God and perservere in (thy) communion
with (or prayer to) thy Lord, so that the fire
of God's love may glow more luminously in the heart,
its heat grow stronger and give warmth to that region
and its sound reach the Supreme Concourse.


O thou maid-servant of God!

     Truly, I say, complete capacity and ability is the
cause of the appearance of the divine gifts.  Souls are
many who in the years gone by have listened to the glad-tidings,
but up to this time they have remained veiled,
deprived and unmoved.  But, through the bounty of the
Beauty of Abha, as soon as thou didst hear the call,
thou didst turn thy face toward the Lord of Hosts and
became a believer in God and assured of His divine
verses.  Immediately the Most Great Name made an
impression upon thee.  Therefore, I hope thy breath
may become also effective and in a short time, like unto
dry wood, become enkindled and ignited.
     Do not wonder at the mercy and bounty of God.


+P 640
Consider thou how one spark sets on fire a great forest.
Therefore, there is great hope, and the favor and grace
of the Almighty is limitless.


O thou advancing maid-servant of God!

     Thy letter was received and I was informed of its
contents.  Thanks be to God! thou art guided to the
Light of guidance and hast attained to this most great
gift.  I hope thou mayest become a daughter of the
Kingdom.  Thou must be thankful to Mrs. .........,
for she was the cause of thy guidance; and thou must
forever seek the providence of God in her behalf, for
she hath illumined thine eyes.  The love that she hath
shown to you, its value is not known at present, but
after departing from this transient world, its value will
become known and evident in the divine Kingdom, and
even in this mortal world its value shall appear in
future.  In the days of Christ, guidance had no importance
whatever to the deniers; now consider how
much importance it hath gained.
     Turn thou with thy heart ot he divine Kingdom
and supplicate to Him, (saying):

     "O Compassionate God!  Thanks be to Thee for
Thou hast awakened and made (me) conscious.  Thou
hast given me a seeing eye and favored me with a hearing
ear; hast led me to Thy Kingdom and guided me
to Thy Path.  Thou hast shown me the right way and
caused me to enter the Ark of Deliverance.  O God!
Keep me steadfast and make me firm and stanch.  Protect
me from violent tests and preserve and shelter me
in the strongly fortified fortress of Thy Covenant and


+P 641
Testament.  Thou art the Powerful!  Thou art the
Seeing!  Thou art the Hearing!  O Thou the Compassionate
God!  Bestow upon me a heart which, like
unto glass, may be illumined wit the light of Thy love,
and confer upon me a thought which may change this
world into a rose-garden through the spiritual bounty.
Thou art the Compassionate, the Merciful!  Thou art
the Great Beneficent God!"


O ye+F1 friends of God!

     Do ye know in what cycle ye are created and in what
age ye exist?  This is the age of the Blessed Perfection
and this is the time of the Greatest Name!  This is the
century of the Manifestation, the age of the Sun of the
Horizons and the beautiful springtime of His Holiness
the Eternal One!
     The earth is in motion and growth; the mountains,
hills and prairies are green and pleasant; the bounty is
overflowing; the mercy universal; the rain is descending
from the cloud of mercy; the brilliant Sun is shining;
the full moon is ornamenting the horizon of ether; the
great ocean-tide is flooding every little stream; the gifts
are successive; the favors consecutive; and the refreshing
breeze is blowing, wafting the fragrant perfume of
the blossoms.  Boundless treasure is in the hand of the
King of Kings!  Lift the hem of thy garment in order
to receive it.
     If we are not happy and joyous at this season, for
what other season shall we wait and for what other time
shall we look?
     This is the time for growing; the season for joyous

bounty, turn to the presence of the generous God; ask
assistance from the Kingdom of Abha; seek confirmation
from the Supreme World; turn thy vision to the
horizon of eternal wealth; and pray for help from the
Source of Mercy!
     Soon shall ye see the friends attaining their longed-for
destination and pitching their tents, while we are but in
the first day of our journey.


O thou servant+F1 of the Threshold of God!

I read what flowed from thy pen in the love of God,
and found charming meanings from the contents (of
thy letter).  I hope, through the gift of the glorious
Lord, that thou wilt be always refreshed and revived by
the fragrances of the Merciful.
     As to what thou hast written concerning "Reincarnation":
Believing in reincarnation is one of the old tenets
held by most nations and creeds, as well as by the Greek
and Roman philosophers and wise men, the old Egyptians
and the chief Assyrians.  But all these sayings and
superstitions are vanity in the sight of God.
     The greatest [argument] produced by those who held
to reincarnation has been this:  "That it is necessary
to the justice of God to give every one his due.  Now
everybody who is afflicted by any calamity is said to have
sinned; but when a little child, which is still in the womb
of its mother and hath just been formed, is found to
be blind, deaf or imperfect, how could it have committed


------------------------
1.  To a believer in Baku, Russia.
+P 643
any sin that we might say this imperfection is
given to it as a punishment therefore - so, though such
a child hath not done outwardly any sin in the womb
of its mother, ye [they say] it must have sinned when
it was in its former body, which hath caused it to suffer
this punishment."
     Indeed, these people have been negligent of the fact
that had the creation been carried out in a uniform
fashion, how could the statement be true, that "God
doeth whatever He wisheth and God doeth whatever He
desireth!"+F1
     Though the fact of "Return" is mentioned in the
Divine Books, by this is intended the return of the
qualities, characters, perfections, truths and lights (of
the past age), which re-appear in every age, and not
(the return) of certain persons and souls.  For example:
If we say this lamp is the return of that of last night,
or that the last year's flower hath returned in the garden
(this year), in this sense the return of the individual,
or identity, or personality is not meant; nay, rather, it
is intended that the same qualities and states existing
in that lamp or flower, which are now seen in this lamp
or flower, have returned.  That is, the same perfections
and virtues and properties which existed in the past
springtime have returned during this present springtime.
For instance:  When one says, these fruits are the same
as those of last year; in this sense, he hath reference to
the freshness and delicacy of the fruit, which hath returned,


------------------------
1.  Abdul-Baha elucidated Jesus' teaching against the theory of "blindness
    from birth" and the defects being caused by the sin of the individual
    former state (see St. John 9:1-3), thus: "Jesus states that this
    defect exists in order to prove and show that the gift of sight is from
    God alone and is one of his bounties.  Because were all created with
    sight the people would consider it a mere natural fact that they must be
    so made, and not give God thanks for His great gift." - Translator.
+P 644
although there is no doubt that the identical fruit
of last year hath not returned.
     Have the friends of God found such enjoyments and
respose during their existence on this visible earth, that
they might wish to have their return renewed and repeated
constantly?  Are all these calamities, injuries,
trials and difficulties of the once coming not sufficient for
them that they should wish a repeated life in this world?
Hath this cup been of such sweetness that they should
long for it successively and repeatedly?  No!  the
friends of the Beauty of El-Baha neve seek any recompense
or reward except the meeting and the visit (of
God) in the Kingdom of El-Baha; and they never walk
but in the valley of desire to attain the Supreme Height.
They only wish the immortal blessing and the eternal
gift, which are sanctified above the worldly understanding.
     Because, when thou lookest with the iron sight, thou
wilt find that all mankind is suffering in this earthly
world; there is no one in such tranquility that this (state)
might have been a reward for his good deeds in a former
life and there is no soul so happy that this might be the
fruit of his past pain!  Had the life of a man in his
spiritual being been only confined to his life in this world,
the creation would have proved useless; the divine qualities
would have no result and effect; nay, all things,
created beings and the world of creation would have
proved abortive.  I ask pardon of God for such false
imaginations and for such errors!
     As the usefulness and powers of the life (of a child)
were not seen in that dark and narrow world (of the
womb), but when it is brought into this vast world, all


+P 645
the use of its growth and development becometh manifest
and obvious in it, so likewise, reward and punishment,
paradise and hell, and the requital of deeds and
actions done by it in the present life become manifest
and evident when it is transferred to the world to come
- which is far from this world!  Had the life and
growth of the child in the womb been confined to that
condition, then the existence of the child in the womb
would have proved utterly abortive and unintelligible;
as would the life of this world, were its deeds, actions
and their results not to appear in the world to come.
     Therefore, know thou that the True One possesseth
invisible worlds which human meditation is unable to
comprehend and the intellect of man hath no power to
imagine.  When thou wilt purify and clarify thy spiritual;
nostrils from every worldly moisture, then thou wilt
inhale the holy fragrances diffusing from the merciful
gardens of these worlds.
     El-Abha be upon thee and upon all those who are
gazing and turning unto the Kingdom of El-Baha, which
God hath sanctified above the understanding of the heedless
souls and from being perceived by the eye of those
who deny!


O my spiritual friends!+F1

     What you have written is perused, all of which was
an entreaty and invocation unto God and a desire for
devotion unto the Most High.  I hope through the
bounty of God, day by day, your assurance, belief and
faith will increase; moment by moment the flame of
the love of God will be intensified; louder and louder

will the proclamation of the Word of God be heard
in that country; the breeze of sanctity will begin to
blow; the attraction of the inner consciousness will
cause these districts to be animated; the mercy and aid
of God will be your associates and the assistance from
the Kingdom of compassion will be momentarily bestowed.
Now is the time for those spiritual friends,
(i.e., yourselves,) to adorn the divine meetings, endeavor
to spread the Cause of god, arise to diffuse
His breaths and stand for the promotion of His Word;
that the breath of the Holy Spirit may bestow life to the
hearts, causing the spirits to attain the Beloved.
     The letter you have previously written is not yet
received; if it were you may be sure it would be answered,
because this servant hath great love and attachment
for the believers in that city and will always communicate
with them.
     O Thou pitiful God!  These friends are perfectly
infatuated with Thy nearness; they have given their
hearts for the beauty of Thy face; are devoted to Thy
Kingdom and are intoxicated by the wine of belief.  In
the meeting of the covenant they are bearing in their
hands the cup of anxiety, needing Thy benevolence and
yearning for the heavenly blessings.
     O Mighty Creator!  Cause these souls to be the receptacle
of Thy mercy, regarded by divine attention,
and render each one as a lighted candle, that they may
illuminate that region with the light of righteousness.
Make them the companions of and partaker with this
servant [Abdul-Baha] in the devotion of Thy Threshold.
O my God!  Strengthen the weak ones and
open the eyes of those who are anxious to behold the


+P 647
beauty of the Kingdom, that they may arise with divine
strength, heavenly bounty, spiritual blessing, ethereal
breaths and mighty assistance for Thy service, dispelling
the superstitions of the doubters, elucidating the
proofs and evidences before all seekers, healing the
sick, being kind to the poor, a refuge and home for the
helpless and a light for the hopeless.
     Thou art the Powerful and the Able, the Pitiful and
Compassionate God!
     O my friends!  Endeavor to your utmost ability
that, day by day, unity and harmony will increase and
the love of God will so firmly capture the hearts that
they will forget all save Him and be engrossed, night
and day, in mentioning the Kingdom, the heavenly signs
and the divine verses.  If love, friendship, association
and unity be established among the believers, the door
of all significances will be opened and each believer of
God will be able to explain and interpret all of the
holy Books.
     O believers!  The tests of God are very severe; you
should beseech and cry unto Him that you may be firm
and steadfast during all temptations.


     +F1 As to [what thou hast heard concerning] the child
born from Russian parentage, this is pure imagination.
Yea, certain persons shall in this divine dispensation
produce heavenly children and such children shall
promulgate the teachings of the Beauty of Abha and
serve His great Cause.  Through a heavenly power and
spiritual confirmation they shall be enabled to promote

the Word of God and to diffuse the fragrances of God.
These children are neither Oriental nor Occidental,
neither Asiatic nor American, neither European nor
African, but they are of the Kingdom; their native
home is heaven and their resort is the Kingdom of
Abha.  This is but the truth and there is naught after
truth save superstitions (or fancy).


O thou spiritual beloved!

     I have carefully looked at thy picture and found that
from thy face emanates the spiritual glad-tidings, the
merciful complaisance and the heavenly brightness.
Their traces shall appear and their lights shall shine.


O thou who art gazing toward the Kingdom of the
     Testament!

     I already received thy letter which announced thy
receipt of the loving letter sent to thee by the pen of
Abdul-Baha.  By God the True One!  Verily, those
letters are as gifts of God to thee, to thy noble wife and
to thine honorable daughter.  I beg of God to enable
thee to perfectly endeavor to practice according to their
contents.
     Yes, some of the intellectually cultured people in
those countries exert themselves to reach the loftiest
summits of prosperity in worldly affairs and most of
them are desiring wealth and are making an effort to
attain it somehow.  But they are unmindful of the
treasury of the Kingdom, the spiritual affluence and the
wealth of mind; therefore, thou findest them subject to
the rage of lusts and under the influence of egotistic and
selfish desires, sinking into intemperance and engaged

+P 649
in drinking the cup of lust.  Were they to become mindful
of their heedlessness and awakened from the sleep of
ignorance, they would become intoxicated by the cup of
the love of God and exhilarated by the good cheer of the
wine of the knowledge of God.
     I beg of God to shine forth unto you with the lights
of His sanctity and send to you divine souls, that they
may fully reveal to you the divine teachings.
     The letters which I sent to you are as the fragrant
breezes of the garden of the knowledge of God, which
can be smelled by every one whose sense of smelling is
clean and purified from any rheum, because they are
glad-tidings proceeding from pure lips which are fluent
in explaining the mysteries of God.  I beg of God to
ordain for us to meet one another.


O thou who art assuredly believing in God!

     Verily, I read thy letter which showed how thou art
believing in God, assured of the signs of God and art
attracted by the love of God.
     I thank God for that He hath ignited the fire of His
love in thy heart, hath drawn thee by the magnet of His
guidance, hath dilated thy heart through the light of
His knowledge, hath assisted thee to be firm in His
Testament, hath sent down His blessing upon thee, upon
thy household and upon thy children, hath illuminated
thy house by igniting therein the lamp of the praise of
God, hath caused those souls who have drawn nigh unto
the Kingdom to abide in thy house+F1 - those who deliver
the Cause of God, who speak the praise of God and

explain the indisputable proofs of God unto the servants.
It behooveth thee to thank God for this great gift and
say:
     "O my Lord!  Confirm me to serve Thy beloved and
to be submissive and humble before Thy chosen ones.
Make me to know the meaning of Thy Words and inform
me of the mysteries of Thy signs.  Place me in
the shadow of the standard of Thy Testament and
preserve me from Thy tests which break backs and unveil
the sins of the back-sliders and tend to disgrace
the party of deception and the people of wickedness
(i.e., the nakazeen).  Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the
Pardoner!"


O thou confident soul who art content and patient!

     Verily, I read thy welcome letter and was informed of
its contents which gladdened the hearts of the unitarians
(i.e., the believers at Acca) of thy desire for God's
confirmation in the service of His Cause among the
sincere servants.  Do not consider the weakness of the
people, but observe the power of attainment in this
manifest day.  Separate thyself from all thoughts, strip
thyself from the unclean garment of attachment to this
drossful (or earthly) world, arise for the service of thy
Lord, the Clement, and be clothed with the robe of assurance
(or certainty), so that thou mayest behold the
hosts of confirmation from thy Lord arising from all
sides.
     As to thy information concerning the services of
Mirza Assad Ullah to the holy and brilliant Threshold,
verily, it gladdened Abdul-Baha and he thanked God
for this great bounty unto him (Mirza Assad Ullah)


+P 651
and the chosen of God.  Verily, I hope, through the
favor of my Lord, that He will confirm ye unto that
which he (Mirza Assad Ullah) was confirmed; because
the treasury of the favors of thy Lord are full of
bounties.  Verily, he granteth to whomsoever He
wisheth what He desireth, and, verily, He is the Generous,
the Giver and the Forgiver!


O thou spiritual person and heavenly man - may God
     confirm thee!

     Know, that the divine springtime hath come with its
rains and abundance, with the heat of its sun, the breeze
of its life and the scent of its fragrance; and through
this universal and great abundance, the land of the holy
truth and facts hath moved and brought forth of every
kind, good and beautiful fruits.  But the barren, wicked
land will not bring forth save the thorn of denial, of
haughtiness and disdain.  Therefore, thank thou God
for He hath made thee a good, fertile land by the clouds
of the abundance of God the Chosen.
     Convey my greetings to thy esteemed wife and
daughter, who are honored by the people of the Kingdom
of Perfection.


O thou who art esteemed and guarded!

     Thank God for that by reason of which thy picture
hath come into the court of holiness of perfumed
breaths.  I supplicate to God to confirm thee in that
which beseemeth this station.


O thou who art rejoiced by the Appearance of God!

     Blessed art thou for that thine eyes were brightened
by the light of guidance, thine ears heard the calling of


+P 652
God from the Supreme Concourse, thine heart was
gladdened by the love of God and attracted unto the
Beauty of God.  Verily, by the Lord of Hosts, thou wilt
find thyself in the Kingdom surrounded by favors on the
part of thy Lord, the Clement, and the angels of mercy
will herald to thee glad-tidings which are the greatest
gift from the King of Might.
     Upon thee be El-Baha and upon thee be praise!  O
thou who art attracted by the fragrance of God in this
manifest day!


O thou who art exhilarated by the Wine of the Love of
     God - young in age and old in soul!

     Truly, truly, I say unto thee, thy thanksgiving for
my brilliant letter, which was sent thee, caused me to
address thee repeatedly with the greatest affection of soul
and spirit.  By the life of God! verily, this letter will
make thee and thine household [rejoice] throughout the
eternity of the eternities, because the tongue of Abdul-Baha
is addressing thee from this lofty and sublime
threshold of the Blessed Perfection.
     I assuredly cast mine eyes on the picture traced by
thine hand and smelled the fragrance of the love of God
from its flowers, because it is painted while thine heart
hath been overflowing with the love of Baha' and thou
hast made it as a token for thy remembrance.
     I beg of God to make thee cut thine heart from this
world and whatever is in it, to devote thy life to the
service of the maid-servants of God, to kneel down,
worship and glorify the affectionate Lord, the Exalted,
the Lord of angels and spirit!***

To the servant of God!

     I ask God to make thee a growing, developing branch
in His vineyard, bearing flowers, leaves and fruits, with
widespread branches, blooming, verdant and watered
by the abundance of the clouds of His Kingdom and the
heat of the sun of His Word.


To the servant of God, .........:

     What thou hast written is understood.  In reply I
will elucidate briefly, the purport of which you, with
your intelligence, will surely comprehend:
     The world of humanity is encompassed by the darkness
of conventionalities, disagreements, discords,
avoidance, animosity, enmity, ignorance, folly, lustful
desires and animal tendencies; the gloomy night had
darkened the horizon of the world in such manner that
all had forgotten the light and deemed the darkness
inevitable in the world of humanity, and its solution
impossible; when, unexpectedly, the Light of Reality
appeared and enlightened the horizon of the world,
diffusing its rays throughout the East and West, the
beholding of which instantly delighted the perfect and
perceiving eyes; but the imperfect eyes, afflicted by the
darkness, were dazzled by the radiance, while the negligent
closed theirs and turned away entirely.  That
light is the Love of God, the Spirit of God, unity, concord,
science and knowledge, bounty and perfection, redemption
of life, spiritual perception, universal peace,
alliance of the nations, unification of all peoples and


+P 654
the reality of the attributes of the Merciful One, which
I hope thou wilt fully attain.


O seeker of the truth!

     There are two ways of healing diseases, the material
way and the spiritual way.  The first is the remedies
of the physician; the second prayers and turning one's
self to God.  Both must be practiced and followed.
The diseases that happen to be caused by physical accident
are cured by medical aid; others, which are due
to spiritual causes, will disappear by spiritual means.
For instance: For a disease due to grieving, fear, nervous
impressions, the spiritual remedies will take more
effect than the physical.  Therefore, these tow kinds of
remedies must be followed; neither is an obstacle to the
other.  You must take care of the physical remedies.
These also came from the bounty and mercy of God
who revealed and made evident the science of medicine,
so that His servants may also be benefited by this mode
of healing.  In the same way take care of the spiritual
healing, because it giveth wonderful results.
     And if thou art looking for the divine remedy
which will cure the spirit of man of all diseases and
make him obtain the health of the divine Kingdom,
know that it is the precepts and teaching of God.  Take
the greatest care of them.


     +F1 Thy letter was received and its contents noted.  In
truth, thou hast been thrown amid dire ordeals, enduring
agonizing afflictions.  These trials were according


------------------------
1.  The following Tablet as received bore no opening line of address.
+P 655
to the consummate wisdom, therefore they were for the
best.  It is good for man to endure (in such moments).
     Reflect upon his holiness Job:  What trials, calamities
and perplexities did he not endure!  But these
tests were like unto the fire and his holiness Job was
like unto pure gold.  Assuredly gold is purified by being
submitted to the fire and if it contain any alloy or imperfection,
it will disappear. That is the reason why
violent tests become the cause of the everlasting glory of
the righteous and are conducive to the destruction and
disappearance of the unrighteous.
     The wisdom of all these tribulations that poured successively
upon thee was this, that thou shouldst be prepared
and made ready for this Cause, that thou mightiest
expect the attainment to the greatest guidance, for all
these trials were but a preparation for thine entrance into
the Most Exalted Paradise and the beginning of obtaining
this most great benefit.
     Unless the season of winter appear, thunder roll, lightening
flash, snow and rain fall, hail and frost descend
and the intensity of cold execute its command, the season
of the soul-refreshing spring would not come, the
fragrant breeze would not waft, the moderation of temperature
would not be realized, the roses and hyacinths
would not grow, the surface of the heart would not
become a delectable paradise, the trees would not bloom,
neither would they bring forth fruits and leaves.  That
was the beginning of the manifestation of these roses,
hyacinths, buds, blossoms and fruits.
     Therefore, be not distressed on account of those
adversities which fell upon thee; nay, rather, arise and


+P 656
render thanks that the ultimate goal is the attainment to
this eminent bounty and the enjoyment of this highest
gift of the almighty God.  Consequently gird up the
loins of thine endeavor, that thereby some results might
be produced, some fruits gathered, the lamp of everlasting
life ignited and the gifts of the Lord of the Kingdom
be manifest, so that thou mayest accomplish again,
with great yearning and exaltation, the worship of the
Lord of Hosts.


O thou who art firm in the Covenant!

     Thy last letter, sent by Mirza ........., hath arrived.
It is not a very long time since I wrote thee a
letter in which I said how contented I was with thee
and I explained to thee the importance of thy visit to
India and showed thee the results and the fruits of that
visit.
     At this moment hath arrived a letter in which thou
hast praised the believers of Rangoon, especially Seyed
........., Mirza ........., Mirza ......... and
Khai Khosroe+F1 who sacrificed his life for thine; ea,
this is the truth!  Consider what a difference exists between
his country and thine and what a great effect
this Bahai spirit hath manifested that an oriental sacrificed
his life for an Occidental!  What attraction, what
love, what relationship is this!  Blessed are those who
are able to arrive at an understanding of the reality of
the power of this love!
     Concerning Mr. ........., one of the Hindus of


------------------------
1.  Khai Khosroe was a Zoroastrian Bahai of Bombay, India, who left his
    home and went to Lahore to nurse Mr. Sydney Sprague who was sick
    of a fever.  Mr. Sprague recovered, while the great Khai Khosroe
    died.  He was the first Oriental friend to give his life for a Western
    Bahai brother.
+P 657
whom thou hast written:  Say to him, "To me thou
art not a stranger, but a friend; thou art not unknown,
but known."
     Thou hast spoken of a spiritual wave.  This is not
a wave, but a sea; nay, the very ocean!  But his is not
to destroy the cities, but to purify them; and soon it will
submerge them all.  This does not mean destruction,
but salvation; it is not death, but life; it is not enmity,
but love; it is not pain; it is a remedy.  The world of
existence is the body, and this is its spirit; this immense
world is the glass [chimney], and this is the lamp
[lighted wick]; humanity is the heaven, and this is its
sun.  The signs of this bounty are clear and visible.
The proof is the changing of the characters of the
friends and the perfection that the believers have made
in their actions and words:  They were dark, they became
luminous; they were terrestrial, they became
celestial; they were human, they became divine; they
were diabolic, they became angelic; they were a drop,
they became the sea; they were an atom, they became
the sun.  These are the signs of those who are entirely
submerged by this wave; that is to say, this ocean.
     O thou .........!  I hope that thou wilt progress
more and more; that thou wilt increase thy knowledge
and science; and that thou wilt ever strive for gentleness
and love.
     Perhaps it will be possible for thee, next winter, to
go to Persia.


O thou maid-servant of God!

     thank ye that God hath enkindled the light of guidance
in this darkness of ignorance, hath quickened those


+P 658
who were asleep, made mindful those who were heedless,
made unproductive trees full of blossoms and fruit,
and old men laden with years, fair and graceful youths.
     Praise be unto God!  What an effect there lies in
divine guidance!  It endoweth the blind with sight,
granteth strength to the impotent, maketh the darkened
ones illuminated, changeth youth to the aged; nay, rather
it breatheth life into the dead!
     O thou maid-servant of God!  If thou seeketh after
a work which is brighter and more attractive, sweeter
and more delightful than all the affairs, it is the thralldom
in the Threshold of the Almighty and servitude to
His Highness the Lord of Might.
     Forget thou entirely the ease, tranquility, composure
and living of this transitory world and occupy thyself
with the well-being and the service of the human world
and conduct thyself in accord with the advices and exhortations
of God.


O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!

     I have read thy beautiful letter containing beautiful
significances and indicating that which hath occurred to
thy heart of spiritual events, and that which hath encompassed
thy spirit of merciful thoughts.  This is
from the bounty of Thy Lord upon thee and upon
every maid-servant chosen by His mercy in this new
age.
     (Question:  "Master, who art thou?  Art thou the
Christ?")
     As to what thou asked concerning me:  Verily, I say
unto thee, that I am indeed an humble, submissive and


+P 659
imploring servant of God; a servant of His Beloved;
a messenger of the exaltation of His Word; a spreader
of His Fragrances; an extoller of the banner of love
and harmony; a promoter of the greatest peace among
all nations and tribes; a kindler of the fire of the love of
God in the hearts of the people; a runner to the place
of martyrdom in the Cause of God; a yearner for
every calamity in the love of God; a longer for suspension
upon the cross for the love of the beloved; a herald
of the Kingdom of God among the sects of all horizons.
This is my station and condition; this is my blazing
crown; this is my glorious throne; because my servitude
to the Holy Threshold is my brilliant light, my shining
star and my drawn sword; and beside this I have no
other name.
     Then know that for the dominion of the reality of
Christ there is no beginning and there is no end.
Everlastingly that luminous Entity hath been sitting on
the throne of might and everlastingly It will have a
penetrating dominion over the worlds of existence.
This dominion is eternal and everlasting and has no
abrupt end.
     (Question:  "When is the time of the millenium?
Will I see it?)
     Concerning the one thousand years as recorded in
the Book:  It signifieth the beginning of this Manifestation
until the end of its predominance throughout the
contingent world; because this Cause is great, its powers
are growing and its signs are dazzling.  It shall
continue in elevation, exaltation, growth, promulgation
and promotion until it shall reach the apex of its glory
in one thousand years - as the day of this Manifestation


+P 660
is one thousand years.  Thou shalt see its conquering
power, its manifest dominion, its eternal might and
its everlasting glory.
     (Question:  "At the time of thy departure will there
not be some great spiritual manifestation all over the
earth?")
     As to the question of "after my departure" to the
neighborhood of the mercy of my Lord:  Know there
shall appear wonderful traces; the breath of God shall
pass by; the fragrance of God shall spread and the
Spirit of God shall run in the body of the contingent
world both before and after my departure; but I supplicate
God that He may grant the greatest spirituality
in these days.  Endeavor, therefore, that thou mayest
have a great portion in it.
     (Question:  "What did the vision of a paper signify
in my dream?")
     Concerning the appearance of a paper in thy dream,
before thine eyes, which thou wast unable to read:
Thou shalt read it through the permission of God and
thou shalt comprehend its meanings.  It is a diary of
the Word of God and the divine mysteries.


O ye+F1 who are attracted by the Fragrances of God!

     Verily, this mundane world is as the mirage of the
desert, but the Kingdom is like unto a sea of great
surges and rolling waves.  Those who longed for the
mirage have indeed become more thirsty the more they
hastened toward it and have perished in grief after a
drop of water.
     Ye see, as the condition really is, that the people of

the world are striving day and night for the sake of
attaining perfect happiness and tranquil life, but the result
is none other to them than disappointment, affliction,
lamentation and destruction.
     But those who have advanced to the Kingdom of
God have assuredly advanced to a sea of clear and
limpid water and thus have attained unto the greatest
bounty, the perfect rest and the eternal life to which
there is no abrupt end.  Their faces have shined with
joy, their souls delighted with pleasure, their hearts
illumined and their cups overflowed with abundance.
Their edifice hath risen high, their palaces have been
adorned, their suns shone, their stars gleamed and their
diadems radiated with a dazzling light.  Their dominions
have expanded and their lights have spread to all
ages and generations.  These are their set-up thrones,
their high palaces, their luminous lamps and their shining
moons throughout all horizons.  These are their
traces in the world; how much more then would be
their lights in the highest of the high - consider, therefore,
O ye maid-servants of the Merciful!
     This being the case, care no more for the world and
its desires, but cling to the spiritual world and its gifts,
spread the fragrances of God, be submissive to the
Word of God, establish a spiritual meeting-place
wherefrom theincense of sanctity and purity will rise
up to God, assemble there with fragrance and spirituality
and celebrate the Name of your Lord by day and
by night.  At that time ye would become illumined
lamps, spiritual stars; rather, eternal suns.  This is a
favor that was longed for by the spirits of the godly
people and the hearts of the queens in the former ages.


+P 662
O ye maid-servants+F1 of God and leaves of the Tree of

     Blessed are ye for attaining to that which was the
greatest hope of Mary the Magdalene and Mary the
mother of Jacob!  This gift was shining on the face of
the Virgin Mary like unto a brilliant gem glistening on
the great crown of glory.
     Happy are ye for this favor, the likeness of which
was not seen by the eye of existence, not its similitude
heard by the ears of the creatures; because it is the
greatest favor on the part of the Lord of the Kingdoms
in the world of existence; that is, the greatest guidance,
the attainment unto the day of the Lord and listening
unto the call of God.  How blessed is this great
favor!
     O ye maid-servants of God!  All the palaces shall
be destroyed and become like graves, buried beneath
the ground, but god, through His mighty hand, will
build for ye solid palaces in His Kingdom which will
not be destroyed forever and evermore; nay, rather its
foundation will be strengthened in the course of ages
and centuries.
     Therefore, call in His Name, spread the fragrances
of God, guide unto the path of God and cause souls
to enter the Kingdom of God!

world will all engage in praising you and such activity
will be brought about in the West as will increase the
motion and activity in the East.
     You have written concerning the meetings in Cambridge

it will increase the diffusing of the fragrances.
     The news concerning the unity, harmony, affinity and
oneness of the maid-servants of the Merciful One and
the friends of God in those parts, imparted the utmost
joy and happiness (to me).  This indicated that the

and say:  "The Beauty of Abha - may my life be a
sacrifice to the dust of His footsteps! - hath opened a
great door before your faces and bestowed a weighty
gift upon you.  We must know the value of this and
sacrifice ourselves entirely; nay, we must forget ourselves.
We must wish for no rest and seek no joy.  We
must seek no name nor fame, no ease, amplitude nor
convenience; nay, we must sacrifice everything in order
that we may be clad in the kingdom of immortality!"+F1
     The letter which thou hast written was received and
its perusal brought me joy, for it indicated that you are
extremely pleased with the beloved ones (i.e., men)
and the maid-servants of God in Persia.  forsooth,
their love is heartfelt and real; they are devoted in
service with all their soul and they are attracted by the


------------------------
1.  Literally, in order that we may emerge our head out of the bosom of the
    kingdom of immortality.
+P 664
love of the friends with all their heart.  If any occasion
befalleth and cases of tests come up, they will
sacrifice their precious lives for the sake of the friends
and freely give up all their possessions.
     Briefly, O thou dear maid-servant of God!  Praise
be to God! thou didst see with thine own eyes, thou
didst hear with thine own ears and thou didst comprehend
with thine own heart.  Thou didst witness the
qualities and the life and conduct of Abdul-Baha and
thou didst behold the love and kindness, faith and assurance
of the friends of Persia.  Thou didst see the exaltation
(or progress) of the Cause of God and thou didst
test the general character (or qualities) of the friends;
and thou didst know with perfect assurance that the
Cause of Baha'o'llah is the means for the quickening
of the world and for the extraordinary progress of mankind;
that it hath quickened Persia and hath removed the
darkness of ignorance, that the friends are kind unto all
the people of the world and self-sacrificing servants
of mankind.


O thou who art firm in the Covenant!

     I am ever busy with the remembrance of the friends,
praying and supplicating at the threshold of His Majesty,
the Merciful One, and seek aid and assistance for
the beloved.
     Concerning the journey of Mr. .........:  The
friends of the west put forth their efforts and helped
until the means for the trip were made ready and he
left for India in perfect comfort and is now busy with
the diffusion of the fragrances.  This service of the
beloved to the Kingdom of Abha will be the means of


+P 665
great bounty, a magnet of strength and power attracting
assistance and providence in the divine realm.
     The beloved of God must take thought night and
day for the spread of the fragrances and for the promotion
of the Word of God.  They must send criers
and messengers (teachers) to all parts of the world.
Every soul who is himself able must ignite the candle
of guidance, illumine the hearts with the light of knowledge
and, if possible, they must travel to other countries
of God.  Thus may the confirmation of the Holy
Spirit arrive and the breath of life reach other souls.
     The purport is this:  I am made happy and am
pleased with the souls who have furnished the means
for the journey of Mr. ......... I pray for them and
supplicate for bounty and blessing on their behalf.


     +F1 Convey my respectful greeting to Mr. ......... and
say:  "Praise be to God! that there exists in thee capacity
and endowment to enter into the Kingdom of God,
and that thy wisdom and intelligence are known to the
republic.+F2  Therefore, tarry thou not.  Enter thou immediately
into the Kingdom of God.  Enlist thyself
in the roll of the army of the Lord of Hosts, in order
that thou mayest become the cause of salvation to the
people, endow sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf
and life to the dead.  This is the divine gift!  This is
the supreme guidance!  make thou thy meetings a
palace for the heavenly beloved and thy residence a
glass for the light of Deity.  Suffer thy home to become
a nest for the dove of the Holy Spirit and thine

eye the mirror for the reflection of the Beauty of the
Almighty."


O ye beloved friends of Abdul-Baha!+F1

     The news of your spiritual assembly reached this
Illumined Spot and the heart of this yearning one was
rejoiced on account of your concord, unity and affinity.
What wonderful meetings and brilliant gatherings were
those, whose fame will become world-wide and whose
melody will ere long reach to all the kingdoms! that
in the region of America the believers are real companions
and associates with each other and are as beloved
friends among themselves; that they bring about gatherings
of friendship, engage themselves in the praise and
glorification of the glorious Lord, deliver eloquent
speeches, establish the proofs and arguments of the
Manifestation of the Sun of Truth, spread the divine
teachings and shed broadcast the musk-diffusing fragrances
of the Kingdom, so that the nostrils become
perfumed and the eyes become brightened.
     O ye friends!  O ye maid-servants of the Merciful!
Those assemblies are the emblems of the Supreme Concourse
and the prototypes of the congregations of the
spirits in the Kingdom of Abha.  Avail yourselves of
the opportunities of this time, neither let the occasion
slip by unheeded.  The season of the soul-refreshing
springtime will not appear at all time, neither will the
breezy dawn be at every moment.  Now is the time of
proclamation and the occasion of supplication and invocation
toward the Kingdom of Abha.
     Therefore, sing ye the sweet melody in the assemblages,


------------------------
1.  To the Brooklyn (N.Y.) assembly.
+P 667
entreat ye at the Threshold of the Kingdom
of the Lord of Hosts and beg ye for confirmation and
assistance.  The Guide of Providence will appear and
the "beloved of divine gift" will unveil her luminous
countenance.


O thou dear maid-servant of God!

     thou hast learned of thy Lord and engaged thyself
in the servitude of the Lord of Hosts.  In the promised
day thou art adoring the beloved Countenance and
thou shalt be aided and confirmed in that which is the
greatest desire of the saints.
     The cause of eternal glory to man is faith and certainty
and then living (or acting) according to the behests
of His Majesty the Eternal God.  My hope is
that thou wilt attain to the three.
     As long as thou canst, wish thou the most great
peace for all mankind:  Associate with all in perfect
love and kindness; hold all dear and count all friends
and familiar ones; know no enemies; imagine no
strangers.  Thus mayest thou be a mercy to the people
of the world and a source of bounty to the world of
humanity.


O thou who art waiting for the Appearance of the
     Kingdom!


     Glad-tidings be unto thee, for the Kingdom of God
hath raised its tent and tabernacle upon the apex of the
world, the standard of the Kingdom is hoisted, the call
of the Kingdom is sent forth and the hosts of the
Kingdom have appeared.
     Therefore, there are many fortresses and castles of


+P 668
hearts which are conquered and many regions of spirits
which are subdued.  The lights of the Kingdom have
shone forth from the horizon of the East and West.
Praise be to God! that thou hast entered therein and
hast received manifest outpouring from the Most Great
Beauty.
     Although thou art old in age, yet thou art young
in spirit and have freshness and vivacity, vigor and
strength, beauty and sweetness.  Thank thou God for
this.


O thou maid-servant of God!

     The breeze of Life is wafting from the rose-garden
of the Kingdom; become thou undoubtedly moved thereby.
The rays of light are emanating from the Luminary
of regions; become thou unquestionably illumined thereby.
Drink thou as much as thou canst from this overflowing
cup of the love of God and then cause others to drink;
take thou a portion from this ocean of guidance and
then suffer others to share.
     I hope that God will become thy helper and the outpouring
of the manifest Light will shine in thy heart.


O thou who art attracted to the Kingdom!

     Thy letter was received and i supplicated and implored
at the Divine Kingdom that He may bestow real
health to thee, thy husband and thy child and confirm
all of you by the heavenly assistance and grant you
happiness and joy in both worlds!


+P 669
O thou bird of the Rose-garden of the Love of God!

     Thank thou God that, through the utterances of Mrs.
........., thou hast heard of the universe of the
Kingdom, thy heart recognized (the Truth), thine eyes
became seeing and thy soul became mindful.  Shouldst
thou remain firm and steadfast in faith, the desire of thy
heart and soul will become realized, thou wilt find the
utmost joy and wilt be assisted in visiting the holy
Threshold.


O thou who art uttering the mention of God!

     Know, that the pure hearts upon which the mysteries
of the Kingdom of God are printed and pictured, are
reflectors one upon another and thus the once can discover
the secrets of the other, because such hearts are
only mirrors confronting each other on which the secrets
of unity, affinity and concord are printed and reflected.
Accordingly, it would be possible that a certain servant
of the servants of the Merciful might discover a treasured
mystery or a preserved sign, whatever his shortcomings
or defects might be; yet we do indeed rely
upon God the Forgiver.  I supplicate Him to deliver
us from the pangs of lust and its dangers and from the
destructive conditions of passion.
     Verily, I do testify that thine heart is moved by the
fragrance of the love of God, that thy memory is a
fountain overflowing with the water of the knowledge
of God.  Therefore, finish the poem which thou art
composing and send it here, that through reading it
the breast of the believers may be refreshed and dilated
with joy.


+P 670
O thou who art kindled by the fire of the Love of God!


     Rejoice through the fragrance of God and be attracted
by the melodies of the holy birds in the garden
of the gifts of God!  Verily, I, with great humbleness
and submissiveness before the abundance of His mercy,
do roll my face upon the dust to make thee a sign of
unity and a gift of mercy, that thou mayest be, in all
aspects and cases, near to the Kingdom of God.
     Blessed thou art for this great abundance!  Glad-tidings
unto thee because of this manifest light!  By
the life of God! a single drop of the ocean of His love
is more profitable unto thee than the earth and that
which is thereupon, because this will vanish and perish,
but that drop of love will remain eternally and everlastingly
in the worlds of God.


O thou dear servant of God!

     During the time of thy visit here the meanings of the
words of Christ, "Let the dead bury their dead," was
explained to thee.  Those souls who are not vivified and
attracted  by the Holy Spirit, are accounted among the
dead, because their souls are deprived of the breath of
the Holy Spirit, and these persons after physical death
are in a certain condition, having feeling and discernment
in their environment, but in comparison with the
pure souls who have been vivified by the Holy Spirit,
they are as dead and deprived.
     For example:  The mineral kingdom in comparison
with the vegetable is lifeless; also the existence
of the animal kingdom in comparison with that of man
is death.  The meaning is not that the neglectful souls
will be non-existent.


+P 671
     Give my loving greeting to all the servants of God
and the sharers of divinity.


O thou attracted one!

     Thy letter was an evidence of the happiness and
rejoicing of thy heart and soul and a proof of knowing
the True One and severing thyself from all else save
Him.  When thou beholdest with the eye of Truth,
then thou wilt realize that in this world neither known
or unknown, neither kind father or beloved son, mother
or sister, help us.  No persons assist except the Benevolent
Almighty.
     When thou knowest Him, thou art independent from
all else.  When thou art attached to His love, then
thou art detached from every kith and kin.
     O thou attracted one of the Kingdom!  Complete
thou the study of the art of music and sacrifice thyself
more or less to the Lord of the Kingdom.
     The spiritual lily reached [me] in the world of the
Merciful and its sweet fragrance perfumed the nostril.+F1
I ask God that thou mayest find a soul overflowing with
glad-tidings, seek a heart of joy and attain to tthe beautiful
ideal!  That thou mayest sever thyself from this
world and soar up to the Universe of the Creator!


O thou beloved maid-servant of God!

     Thy letter was received and from the rose-garden
of its significances sweet fragrances were inhaled.
Thank God that thou hast found guidance, become
knowing, attached thyself to the Lord of the Kingdom
and attained to spiritual attraction.

1.  The recipient of this Tablet, when writing to Abdul-Baha, extended to him,
    in spirit, a lily.
+P 672
     Thou hast asked permission to come in the presence.
If the means are brought about that traveling may
be made with utmost ease, thou hast permission.


O thou spiritual leaf who art verdant and well-watered
     by the outpouring from the Kingdom of God!

     Verily, I beseech His Presence, the Mighty and the
majestic One, to enlighten the mind through the lights
gleaming from the summit of the Kingdom, and by
which thy tongue shall become eloquent with the remembrance
of the Ever-living One (He who liveth and
dieth not), to make thee a lamp shininng with the lights
of knowledge in those far-distant horizons and vast
countries.
     Verily, I say unto thee, the Covenant of God and
His Alliance is a Lamp diffusing lights from the Supreme
Concourse unto the horizons of the earth and heaven.
Whosoever hath this Divine Lamp before his face, his
forehead shall glisten with manifest light and his speech
shall take effect in all minds and spirits, and God shall
assist him by the poser which penetrateth the essences
of things.


O thou bird of the Garden of God!

     Why art thou sad and sorrowful, disappointed and
grieved!  Praise be to God! the eternal bounty is in
succession, the divine glory is apparent and manifest, the
display of Providence and light of guidance is glistening
and shining from the Kingdom of Abha and the
appearance of the Greatest Sun is clear and evident.  if
thou art outwardly far, then thou art near in spirit, and


+P 673
if thou art absent in body, thou art present in heart
and spirit.
     Arise and wash thy body, wear a pure gown, and
directing thyself to the Kingdom of God, supplicate and
pray to Him.  Sleep in a clean, well prepared and ventilated
place, and ask for appearance (or display) in
the world of vision.  Thou wilt have visions which will
cause the doors of doubts to be closed, which will five
you new joy, wonderful dilation, brilliant glory.  thou
wilt comprehend realities and meanings.
     Verily, the bounty of the Kingdom is unlimited and
the favors of the Lord of Majesty are like unto the
rains of springtime.


O thou maid-servant of God!

     Dost thou remember when Mrs. ......... was
talking with thee, what a cheerful feeling thou felt in
thy heart?  And what a gladness and rejoicing thou didst
find?  Even thy friends were astonished at what was the
cause of this joy.  Therefore, follow thou that rejoicing,
and continue (saying) the Greatest Name every
morning.
     May thy soul be cheered!


O thou maid-servant of God!

     Happiness consists of two kinds; physical and spiritual.
The physical happiness is limited; its utmost duration
is one day, one month, one year.  It hath no result.
Spiritual happiness is eternal and unfathomable.  This
kind of happiness appeareth in one's soul with the love
of God and suffereth one to attain to the virtues and
perfections of the world of humanity.  Therefore, endeavor


+P 674
as much as thou art able in order to illumine the
lamp of thy heart by the light of love.


O thou seeker of the Divine Kingdom!

     The heavenly doors opened, the hosts of realities and
significances rushed forth, the Lord of Hosts established
a heavenly throne and spread the armies of peace and
reconciliation in all parts of the world, in order that
the reign of peace and love may be founded.  Now
that army is engaged in [diffusing] virtues throughout
all regions.
     As to thee:  Be thou of God, that thou mayest become
a leader of peace and reconciliation, hoist the
banner of love and quicken the souls through the
confirmation of the Holy Spirit.


O thou who art longing for the Heavenly Kingdom!

     Mrs. ......... became the guide and directed thee
to the path of the Kingdom and informed thee of my
love.  Whatever she said is correct.  I am the lamp and
the love of God is my light.  this light hath become
reflected in the mirrors of hearts.  Therefore turn thou
unto thy heart, that is, when it is in the utmost freedom,
and behold how the radiance of my love is manifest
in that mirror, and thou art near unto me.
     Recite the Greatest Name at every morn, and turn
thou unto the Kingdom of Abha, until thou mayest
apprehend my mysteries.


O thou plant in the Garden of the Kingdom!

     God created man in the utmost perfection, for He
inscribed the edict of the divine likeness on his brow.


+P 675
Every excellent person (or soul), if confirmed by the
heavenly bounty, is a plant of the Kingdom and becometh
green and refreshed and putteth forth wonderful
blossoms and groweth on the river bank of the love of
God.


O thou seeker of Truth!

     Thank thou the maid-servant of God Mrs. .........,
for she hath guided thee to the Divine Kingdom and
led thee to the noblest station of the human world.
Appreciate thou her value, and turn thou unto the Word
of God, so that thou mayest be confirmed by the power
of the Merciful One, and attain to that which is wished
for by the holy ones.


O thou who art advancing toward the Kingdom of God!

     The doors of the Ideal Heaven of God are opened
and some souls are on the wing like unto birds of holiness
and have attained to the divine Kingdom.
     I beg of God that thou wilt become one of those
birds and soar up in such manner that thou mayest
astonish all.


O ye maid-servants of His Majesty, the Lord - daughters
     and sons of the Kingdom!+F1

     The meeting of the Lord's Supper, which you held in
the home of Mr. and Mrs. ......... (was blessed)
with the lights of the Beauty of the Merciful, which
shone from the Kingdom of Abha, and Abdul-Baha was
present in spirit and heart although absent in body.


------------------------
1.  To the Fruitport (Mich.) assembly.
+P 676
That meeting was exceedingly bright, and as the rose-garden,
emitted a pleasant fragrance.
     Meetings organized with the utmost holiness and
piety, wherein those who are present engage in the mention
and thought of God, and wherein the verses of Oneness
are chanted and the prayers of the Threshold of the
Lord of Verses are offered and the exhortations and
counsels of the Blessed Beauty recited, such meetings are
illumined, spiritual, divine and heavenly.  They are the
means of training the world of humanity.
     I am, night and day, engaged in remembering you,
and happy with your thought, and ask the Lord of the
Kingdom for confirmation, that He may make each one
of you a sign of guidance and the means of educating
and guiding other women and men.
     The bounty and grace of God in this illumined cycle
is like the ocean.  Every instant it surges, reaching the
apogee with its waves and inundating the shores of existence.
Therefore, O ye maid-servants of the Merciful
and servants of God, endeavor while this ocean is still
surging and this cloud raining and pouring, to make the
surface of the earth feel the reality, that it may grow the
hyacinths, the flowers and frits of concord, peace, love,
faith, realities and significances.


O seeker of Truth!

     If thou desirest that god may open thy (spiritual)
eye, thou must supplicate unto God, pray to and commune
with Him at midnight, saying:

     "o Lord, I have turned my face unto thy Kingdom of
Oneness and am drowned in the sea of Thy mercy!  O


+P 677
Lord, enlighten my sight by beholding Thy lights in this
dark night, and make me happy by the wine of Thy
love in this wonderful age!  O Lord, make me hear Thy
call, and open before my face the doors of Thy heaven,
so that I may see the light of Thy glory (Baha') and
become attracted to Thy beauty!
     "Verily, thou art the Giver, the Generous, the Merciful,
the Forgiving!"

At that time such signs will appear which will guide
thee to the Kingdom of Thy Lord, the Merciful.
     The babe dressed in the white garment that gave thee
the jessamine is a fragrance of the fragrances of God,
reared through His love, a sign of His signs and a
breeze of His breezes.  It hath a wonderful power
and there shall be for it astonishing states to the minds
and spirits.  Understand what I say to thee through the
best of symbols.


O thou maid-servant of God!

     Thy writing was considered.  Thank God that thou
wert fed from the table which hath descended from
heaven.  That food is the "I am the bread which
descended from heaven," recorded in the Gospel.  That
is faith, certainty, love and knowledge.  I ask God
that, day by day, thy steps may progress, that thou
mayest grow firmer in the love of God; that unto thee
and thy kindred a blessing of God shall come, and that
thou mayest remain protected and sheltered under all
conditions.  Thus, may thy weakness be changed to
strength and thy inability to power.


+P 678
O ye+F1 dear servants of God!

     Your letter received and the contents proved excellent.
That which is the desire of you hearts is the
utmost hope of the daughters of the Kingdom; that is,
they wish to sacrifice themselves for the Beauty of Abha+F2
and offer their lives for His Holiness, the Supreme.+F3
     In reality, the radiant, pure hearts are the Mashrak-el-Azcar
and from them the voice of supplication and
invocation continually reacheth the Supreme Concourse.
     I ask God to make the heart of every one of you a
temple of the Divine Temples and to let the lamp of
the great guidance be lighted therein; and when the
hearts find such an attainment, they will certainly exert
the utmost endeavor and energy in the building of the
Mashrak-el-Azcar; thus may the outward express the
inward, and the form (or letter) indicate the meaning
(or reality).


O servant of God!

     Give thanks to God, for thou hast come to the Holy
Land, visited the Sacred Threshold, associated with us
for a few days and heard the divine admonitions, which
are in the heavenly Books.  Now return, behave and
act with perfect firmness, according to the heavenly
teachings, in those regions, in order that you may become
the cause by which human perfections will be
attained.


O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!

     Give thanks unto God for having revealed unto thee,
in visions, the mysteries of His Kingdom and for having


------------------------
1.  To three maid-servants at Chicago.
2.  Baha'o'llah.
3.  The Bab.
+P 679
strengthened thee to attain certain revelations which
show thine utmost attraction and constancy unto this
great Cause.
     Verily, the three birds are the three holy souls.  The
one on the right is His Holiness the great Bab, the one
on the left is His Honor the Khudoos,+F1 the glorious
soul, and the great bird in the middle is the Greatest
Name.+F2  The light shining from the Supreme Horizon
is the Beauty of El-Abha.  These birds descended from
an infinite height and the nearer they came to earth the
more their majesty and glory became manifest.  All nations
were promised by a sure promise and were awaiting
with anxiety and longing the coming of the Promised
One.  The two birds accompanying the great bird in
the center signifies that the Bab and His Honor the
Khudoos were both under the wings of the Greatest
name.  As those birds descended and their shadows extended
vertically over the expectants, as the sun approacheth
the zenith at noontide, at this time thou hast
seen a majestic being in the form of man upon the back
of the huge bird in the center.  This person in the
human form is the "divine station" mentioned in the
Bible:  "Let us make man in our image after our likeness."
And the divine lights were reflected from the
reality of the Greatest Name.  Although this station
is far from the minds and understandings, yet its lights
are apparent, its rays reflected and its brilliancy manifested
throughout the universe.
     The white garments signify holy dignity and a station
sanctified from color, i.e., free from the universal


------------------------
1.  Khudoos, literally, Holy; the title given to one of the great martyrs of
    Persia.
2.  Baha'o'llah
+P 680
conditions and material qualities.  That luminous countenance,
manifested in beauty, signifieth that the divine
lights shone forth from the human form, which were
reflected and descended upon thee, dazzling the eyes of
those who were perceiving it as the sun dazzles the
eyes of those who try to look upon it.  That divine form
manifested itself in America and entered the great
Temple which shall soon be constructed therein.  this
glorious Temple resembles the Oriental edifices and soon
thou wilt see it erected there with a most solid foundation
and strongest basis.  That divine face will beam
upon numberless souls who will enter this Temple.
     Regarding the table laid in that magnificent house:
This is the heavenly table of divine knowledge, love
and eternal life.  As to the people gathered there, they
are the beloved of God and His chosen ones whose faces
shine with wonderful and heavenly beauty.  The woman
sitting at the side of the Temple is the law of God,
which will soon dispel all veils and its beauty will appear,
after which it shall be established forever and ever.  The
stamped coins presented to the woman sitting in that
honored station, are the good deeds and actions of the
beloved of God and His maid-servants, submitted with
praise, greetings and great thanksgiving unto that holy
law.  The beautiful woman is blessed by being touched
by that Merciful Being the glory of whose blessing
shall suffuse the universe.  Then the Merciful Being returned
to His station, mounting the bird and ascended
to the Supreme Horizon in the infinite realm.
     This vision showeth that thou, O confirmed and attracted
one, by the breezes of God will soon be acquainted
with the ancient mysteries, for the Manifest


+P 681
Light will appear to thee.  The vision also signifieth
that a Mashrak-el-Azcar will soon be established in
America.  The cries of supplication and invocation will
be raised to the Highest Kingdom therefrom and, verily,
the people will enter into the religion of God by troops
with great enthusiasm and attraction.
     Concerning thy vision of the angels surrounding the
great white throne:  This "throne" is the body of the
Greatest name.  The beautiful and glorious person
riding upon the white horse is the Greatest Name and
the white horse means also His glorious body.  The
herald who proclaimed the written names is Abdul-Baha
who announceth the names of those who deserve
salvation and are firm in the Covenant of God, and
thou art one of those people, the people of salvation.
Be thankful for this great favor.


O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!

     Verily, thy coming, at this time, unto this shining,
blessed Holy Land is not consistent with wisdom, but
when the (proper) time cometh, we shall give thee permission
to come to this Spot of Light.  Thank thou God
for that the love of God hath pervaded thee and seized
the reins from thy hands.  This spiritual love shall
surely pervade all regions.
     As to the human souls (or individuals):  Unless they
acquire the light, they are unable to shine upon other
individuals.  But when a man ariseth to expound the
arguments of God and invite people to enter in the
religion of God, and when he uttereth those argumments
and advanceth consummate proofs concerning the appearance
of the great Kingdom, then intense love shall


+P 682
become manifest in his heart.  This love causeth the
development of this spirit by the grace of the beneficent
Lord.  Consider, O maid-servant of God, the bearer
who brought the garment of Joseph to Jacob.  That
messenger was the bearer of the garment, but he could
not inhale the fragrance of Joseph.  But Jacob, whose
nostrils were pure, inhaled the fragrances of Joseph from
a long distance.
     It may be that man can guide a blessed, holy soul into
the Kingdom of God while he, himself, is deprived
therof.  Consider Judas Iscariot:  He invited others,
while he, himself, was deprived of the Kingdom of
God.  But in spiritual training (or development) it is
impossible for an imperfect one to perfect another or
train another unless he first conquers his own self and
desire and becomes purified from selfish impurities in
order to become capable of merciful slendors.  When
he acquires divine bounties, then he is able to train
another.  An ignorant man hath no power to teach a
seeker (of knowledge) and a poor man hath no power
to succor a needy one.  Consequently, be thou assured
that, verily, man needs to wish for eternal life and
then confer the same upon another.  These human perfections
and merciful bounties are that peace which was
promised and spoken of by Christ.
     Then know thou that, verily, the people of Baha'
must need be distinguished from others in all respects,
until they become the lamps of the True One among the
creatures and the stars of guidance shining from the
Supreme Concourse.
     Then know thou, verily, that Luminous Man, the
lights of whose Face dazzle the eyes and before whom


+P 683
thou knelt down when thou sawest His light, is the
Greatest Name, the Ancient Light, the Honorable
Temple!


O thou sincere servant of Baha'o'llah!

     Thy letter was received and its content was the cause
of infinite happiness, for it was an indication of thy
firmness in the faith and thy steadfastness in the Covenant
and Testament.  Today, the greatest of all titles
and praises are firmness and steadfastness, for the tests
and trials are of the utmost intensity.  I ask God that
day by day thou mayest increase in steadfastness, so like
unto a solid rock thou mayest withstand the tempestuous
sea of test.
     The people of the world are like unto trees (i.e.,
trees without roots), they are torn up by the passing
of a gust of wind, but trees which are deeply rooted,
strong and sturdy, are not uprooted by the most violent
tempest - therefore they produce leaves, blossoms and
fruits.
     O thou spiritual friend!  Thou hast asked the wisdom
of prayer.  Know thou that prayer is indispensable and
obligatory, and man under no pretext whatsoever is
excused from performing the prayer unless he be
mentally unsound, or an insurmountable obstacle prevent
him.  The wisdom of prayer is this:  That it
causeth a connection between the servant and the True
One, because in that state (i.e., prayer) man with all
heart and soul turneth his face towards His Highness
the Almighty, seeking His association and desiring His
love and compassion.  The greatest happiness for a
lover is to converse with his beloved, and the greatest


+P 684
gift for a seeker is to become familiar with the object of
his longing; that is why with every soul who is attracted
to the Kingdom of God, his greatest hope is to
find an opportunity to entreat and supplicate before his
Beloved, appeal for His mercy and grace and be immersed
in the ocean of His utterance, goodness and
generosity.
     Beside all this, prayer and fasting is the cause of
awakening and mindfulness and conducive to protection
and preservation from tests.  The obligatory prayer is
revealed from the Supreme Pen and is translated in
America.  Ask for it from the believers and use it.


O thou beloved maid-servant of God!

     Thank thou God that thou art directed to the Light
of Guidance and ushered into the Kingdom of the Love
of God, became the recipient of the inexhaustible bounties
and that thou hast a son like ........., who is
the servant in the Threshold of God and is one of the
sons of the Kingdom of the Merciful.
     God hath accomplished His gift in thee; thou must
be happy and thankful and hopeful for the favor of
the True one.


O thou who art longing for the Kingdom!

     Mr. ......... in thy behalf hath made a great
endeavor.  Thou shouldst be eternally grateful to him
and thank him, for he hath guided thee to the Kingdom,
led thee to life eternal and set upon thy brow a
crown whose brilliant gems shall illumine the world of
existence.  That crown is the Divine Guidance.  Thousands


+P 685
of illustrious and famous women are deprived but
thou hast partaken of a share of this heavenly food.
The queens of the world are portionless, but thou art
inexhaustibly supplied.
     Therefore, thank thou the Pure, the Almighty, and
adore Him, that He hath bestowed such a beloved and
glorious gift upon thee!


O thou leaf who art moved by the Breeze of God!

     Verily, I address thee with all spiritual love and
gladness from this my residence at the base of Mount
Carmel, which is blessed through all ages by the prophets,
as recorded in the ancient Books.  And I beseech
His Highness the Merciful One to ordain thee a faithful
footing in the Kingdom of God and to provide for
thee all things by which thy mind may be brightened,
thy breast be gladdened, thy tongue become eloquent
and whereby the doors of the meanings hinted at in the
sacred Books and Tablets be opened to thy mind.
Verily, the people are veiled from comprehending the
meanings of the Gospel, the Bible and the Koran and
know not the interpretation of the scriptures of God,
except those whose eyes are opened by the outpouring
of the Spirit of God.  Thou shalt behold men-servants
and maid-servants of Baha' in those far-distant lands
and wide countries, speaking the secrets of the Gospel
and the mysteries of the Bible and the allusions of the
Koran and the explanation of the Words of the Merciful
One.  Those are the servants to whomsoever
God hath assigned His mercy which overfloweth the
existence.


+P 686
O thou tree planted in the Vineyard of God!

     Verily, the clouds of the mercy of thy Lord have
poured forth the rain of His greatest gift; the heat of
the Sun of Truth hath become intense upon the plains,
valleys and hills, and the winds of fecundation of the
mercy of thy Lord have blown o'er the gardens, mountains
and thickets.  Therefore, O thou tree, be verdant,
blossom, put forth leaves and bear beautiful fruits in this
most Supreme Paradise!


O thou who art seeking fire from the Fire of the Love
     of God!

     I received thy brilliant letter and became pleased with
its beautiful contents.  Shouldst thou desire to add perception
and understanding, to become fully aware of the
mysteries as deposited in the Holy Books and to spread
the divine significances, it is incumbent upon thee to be
straightforward in the right Path, to be firm in the
teachings and to be patient under the great test.  he
who is steadfast shall grow and he who is straightforward
shall succeed.
     I supplicate God to grant thee power wherewith thou
wilt confront the beliefs of all regions and innumerable
nations; and to make it possible for thee to come hither
in a convenient time when no obstacles exist, but now
there are many obstacles in the way of thy coming.
However, if thou turn thy face thoroughly to God, He
will grant thee wisdom and power which maketh thy
words to penetrate the hearts as the spirit penetrate
the body.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Thou must leave


+P 687
selfishness, separate thyself from the world and cling
thoroughly to the Most Supreme Kingdom.
     give my salutations to Mrs. ......... and to the
maid-servant of God, ........., and say to them
that "God hath chosen His pure, devout and good maid-servants
to turn their faces to Him and to become
attracted by His fragrances in this new and wonderful
day."


O thou son of the Kingdom!

     Thy sweet letters with their interesting contents are
always conducive to the joy of the hearts.  They are
like unto the melodies of the nightingale which imparteth
exultation to soul and mind.  Thank thou God!
that thou hast gone to those parts+F1 for the purpose of
spreading the Word of God and diffusing the holy fragrances
of the Kingdom of God and that thou art a gardener
in the divine orchard.  Ere long, confirmation and
assistance shall environ thee.
     O thou son of the Kingdom!  If one possesses the
love of God, everything that he undertakes is useful,
but if the undertaking is without the love of God, then
it is hurtful and the cause fo veiling one's self from
the Lord of the Kingdom.  But with the love of God
every bitterness is changed into sweetness and every gift
becometh precious.  For instance, a musical and melodious
voice imparteth life to an attracted heart but
lureth toward lust those souls who are engulfed in
passion and desire.
     With the love of God all sciences are accepted and
beloved, but without it, are fruitless; nay, rather the

------------------------
1.  Germany.
+P 688
cause of insanity.  Every science is like unto a tree; if
the fruit of it is the love of God, that is a blessed
tree.  Otherwise it is dried wood and finally a food
for fire.
     O thou sincere servant of the True One and the
spiritual physician of the people!  Whenever thou presentest
thyself at the bed of a patient turn thy face
toward the Lord of the Kingdom and supplicate assistance
from the Holy Spirit and heal the ailments of
the sick one.  I beg of God to bestow thee with an
eloquent tongue.


O thou maid-servant of God!

     Thy letter was received and the contents indicated
that - praise be to God! - thy heart is ablaze with the
fire of the love of God and thine eyes are illumined with
the light of the guidance of God, that thy face is cheerfully
beaming and thy countenance is shining and
gleaming.
     Say unto thine honored helpmate, thy dear husband:
"Thousands of souls, including the great divines and
Pharisees among the Jews, were awaiting the Manifestation
of Christ, lamenting and weeping and supplicating
that the Messiah should soon appear.  But when His
Holiness Christ came with a beautiful face and sweet
utterance and dawned from the day-spring of the contingent
world like unto the shining sun, all those souls
who awaited Him rejected Him, became afflicted with
the sleep of heedlessness, did not wake up by the voice
of Christ nor did they gain consciousness.  Now
again the same is the case in the Manifestation of
Baha'o'llah."


+P 689
     I beg of God that thy dear husband be guided through
the light of guidance and become a sign of the gift
of the Kingdom of Abha.


O thou who art attracted to the Kingdom!

     The decoration and adornment of the tongue consists
in praising and thanksgiving to the Lord Almighty,
especially when a man is guided by divine grace and
mercy to the path of guidance and when he is intoxicated
by the chalice of boundless blessings.
     Thank God that - praise be to God! - the glass of
thy life and heart hath become bright with the lamp of
guidance, and the chalice of hope and desire hath overflowed
with the wine of the love of God.  This is an
attainment and blessing that, if thou give thanks a
thousand centuries and cycles, thou wilt not be capable
of doing it justice.  Therefore, in the utmost joy,
gladness, rejoicings and endless happiness thou must
open thy tongue in thanksgiving and glorifying the Lord
of mercy and become the cause of enlightenment.
     When in perfect obedience thou followest the path of
the evident Light, thou mayest rest assured that in a
little while life will find the Beloved, the seeker the
Desired One and the traveler the Goal.
     Kiss the face and hair of thy dear children for me,
love them and educate them in divine education.


***O ye+F1 children of the Kingdom!

     The letter that ye have written, although short and
significant, was a manifest book and an evidence of
your faith and assurance and a proof of your union
and harmony.


------------------------
1.  To the Seattle (Wash.) assembly.
+P 690
     Praise be to God! that ye are gathered in one assembly
like unto the stars of the Pleiades, are illumined
with the light of the knowledge of God and through
the outpouring of the cloud of the love of God, ye are
the fresh flowers of the meadow and plain; ye are intimate
and familiar with infinite unity and love.
     Therefore, this meeting is blessed.  But if it is firmly
established and become constant, it will bring forth
great results and most weighty developments will be
attained.  Consequently, persevere ye in renewing your
meetings and display utmost magnanimity in firmness
and steadfastness.  When the root of the tree of the garden
is well established and its protection is safeguarded,
it will bring forth luscious fruits.
     Likewise, when the regiment of an army and the individuals
of a cohort are united and related with ease,
untold triumphs will be acquired.  But if they come
together one day and disperse another day, no fruits
will be produced.
     Therefore, as ye have prepared an army of heaven
and become the host of life, ye must continue to hold
meetings, have spiritual communications, be firm in resolution,
steadfast in purpose and be constant and persevering
so that ye may win celestial conquests.
     I supplicate and entreat at the Threshold of God
to assist and confirm you in firmness and steadfastness
and cause you to guide the inhabitants of that region.


O thou lover of humanity!+F1

     Thy letter was received and its contents imparted
spiritual significances.  Thank thou God that from thy


------------------------
1.  To a believer in New Zealand.
+P 691
early childhood thou hast been always a seeker after
salvation and hast been spending thy energy and effort
in charitable affairs and the excellences of the world
of humanity.  However, every great Cause in this world
of existence findeth a visible expression through three
means; first, intention; second, confirmation; third,
action.  Today on this earth there are many souls who
are the spreaders of peace and reconciliation and are
longing for the realization of the oneness and unity of
the world of man; but this intention needs a dynamic
power, so that it may become manifest in the world of
being.  Today the divine instructions and lordly exhortations
of Baha'o'lah promulgate this most
great aim and the confirmations of the Kingdom are the
supports and defenders of this eminent intention.  For
the power of the Word of God is penetrative and the
existence of the divine Kingdom is uninterrupted.
Therefore, ere long it will become evident and clear
that the ensign of the Most Great Peace is the teachings
of Baha'o'llah.  For the intention, the power
and the action, all the three essential elements are
brought together and the realization of everything in
the contingent world dependeth upon these three principles.
     Therefore, O thou lover of the oneness of the world
of humanity! spread thou as much as thou canst the instructions
and teachings of His Highness Baha'o'llah,
so that the desired Beloved become unveiled in the assembly
of humankind and cast her light upon all the
people.
     Likewise, some of the ancient philosophers have
spoken regarding the oneness of the world of humanity,


+P 692
but confirmation and assistance became not their
supports and helpers.  Consequently their endeavors
ended in being without result and the tree of their hope
without fruit.
     Thou hast written regarding the language of Esperanto.
This language will be spread and universalized
to a certain degree, but later on a language more complete
than this, or the same language will undergo
some changes and alterations and will be adopted and
become universal.  I hope that Dr. Zamenhof become
assisted by the invisible confirmation and do a great
service to the world of humanity.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Whatsoever question
thou hast in thy heart, turn thou thy heart toward the
Kingdom of Abha and entreat in the Threshold of the
Almighty and reflect upon that problem, then unquestionably
the light of truth shall dawn and the reality
of that problem will become evident and clear to thee.
For the teachings of His Highness Baha'o'llah are
the keys to all the doors.  Every hidden secret will become
discovered and every hidden mystery will become
manifest and apparent.***


O thou who art rejoicing by the Glad-tidings of God!

     The contents of thy letter clearly show that thou art
drawn by the love of God, pondering over the Cause
of God and that the cover hath been removed from
off thine eyes.
     I ask God to shower down upon thee a heavenly
blessing; to make thee to serve His Cause and attain His
good pleasure; to teach thee that which thou knewest


+P 693
not; to inspire thee with His argument and proof; to
confirm thee in faith and assurance; and to make thee
the sign of the Merciful among the concourse of the
worlds.
     Verily, He is the Giver, the Generous!


O thou maid-servant of God, who art guided to the
     Light of Guidance!

     Verily, I read thy letter which expressed praise to
thy Supreme Lord for having guided thee to the Fountain-head
of Knowledge, quickened thy heart with the
spirit of faith, poured on thee the clouds of beneficence
and opened thine insight to witness His mighty signs in
the world of man.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Be rejoiced by this
most great glad-tidings; praise in commemorating the
Name of thy Supreme Lord; thank thou God because
He hath quickened thee with an eternal spirit, bestowed
upon thee a heavenly bounty and hath illumined thy
face with the light by which the existence scintillates in
the world of emanation!
     Verily, I was informed of thy great longing to present
thyself at this holy, luminous Spot, but at present
this is not favorable; but I bear unto thee the glad-tidings
that when thou hast departed to thy native land,
the invisible hosts will surely confirm and assist thee
with power and strength, and God will reveal unto thy
heart that which will rejoice it forevermore; and He
shall endow thee with a speech whereat thou in thyself
shalt be astonished and wilt say:  "Blessed am I for
this great gift!  Glad-tidings be unto me for this mighty


+P 694
bestowal, for my Lord hath confirmed me therewith
and enabled me to uplift the Word of God and to diffuse
His fragrances!  Verily, I glory among all the
women of the world!  This is a bestowal which hath
no equal!"
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Verily, the tongue of
the Supreme Concourse uttereth the praise of those
women who are the glory of men; women who have
forgotten themselves, have abandoned their own rest,
attached their hearts to the Kingdom of God, raised
their voice in the Name of God, diffused the signs of
God and uttereed clear arguments and firm proofs concerning
the manifestation of the Kingdom of God.
Trust thou in this promise; then depart to those regions
with infinite joy and gladness and bear unto people
glad-tidings in commemorating thy Lord.  Verily, thy
Lord will assist thee under all aspects and circumstances.
And in the coming year, if it is possible for thee to
come, present thyself at this Blessed Spot and fragrant
region.


O thou maid-servant of God who art attracted unto
     Him!

     Verily, I read thy letter and was informed of its
words.  Its meaning showed that thou hast come out
of the tests of God and that thou art firm and steadfast
in the love of God.  This is through the grace of thy
Lord and His mercy upon those of His maid-servants
who are firm in His right path.
     Gird up thy loins, therefore, to serve the Cause of
God in His great vineyard; trust in the favors of thy
Lord; supplicate unto Him and beseech in the middle


+P 695
of the night and at early morn just as a needy and captive
one beseeches.  It is incumbent upon thee to turn
unto the Kingdom of God and to pray, supplicate and
invoke during all times.  This is the means by which
thy soul shall ascend upward to the apex of the gift of
God.


O thou seeker after the Beauty of the True One!

     What thou hast written was perused.  In indicated
thy yearning and advancement toward the Kingdom of
God.
     If thou standest steadfast and firm in this seeking and
advancement, not becoming agitated by the trials, giving
repose and composure to the mind, and freeing
thyself from attachment to this ephemeral world, be
thou assured that thou shalt become an enkindled lamp,
spreading the lights of faith, assurance, knowledge and
the love of God in every gathering-place.
     We will five thee permission to stand before the
Presence when it is a favorable and suitable time and
not contrary to wisdom.
     If thou seekest after the light of the Kingdom, hasten
undoubtedly to the meetings of the believers, in order
that the rays of truth may reflect in thy heart.


O thou advancing maid-servant of God!

     Thy letter was received and considered.  Thank God
that the evidence and the proof became clear and manifest
to thee.  He gave thee eyes to see therewith the
lights of guidance; He gave thee ears to hear the divine
call; He gave thee nostrils to sense the beautiful fragrance
of the rose-garden of the Kingdom; He gave thee


+P 696
taste to find the sweetness of the love of God; He gave
thee a tongue to mention Him.  Therefore, thou must
thank Him night and day for having attained this bounty.
Thus mayest thou become firm in trials and bear
every difficulty and, like unto the mountains, hold thy
feet firm and steadfast, so that thou mayest not be
shaken by the adverse winds.
     The bounty of the Lord of the Kingdom is great and
His outpouring is glorious.  His favors are boundless.
I ask, through His bounty, to grant thee readiness and
capacity, so that the rains of mercy may cultivate flowers
of significances in the garden of the heart.
     The essential thing is firmness and steadfastness.  I
hope that all the friends and the maid-servants of the
Merciful One may be strengthened and confirmed
therein.
     To pardon shortcomings is an attribute of the Lord
of forgiveness.  Thank God, thou art a dawning-point
of kindness and the recipient of pardon and forgiveness.
     Sacrifice thy life to the Lord of the Kingdom and
seek only His will.  Make thy meeting the house of
Abdul-Baha and the rose-garden of the heavenly birds.
     Convey reverential greeting to Miss ......... and
say:  "Know thou the value of the day of the Lord
and take a portion and a share of the bounty in this
glorious cycle.  If a tree doth not thrive and grow in
this divine springtime, in what season will it bear fruit?
I hope that, though the life-nurturing breeze of the
rose-garden of the Kingdom, thou mayest become a tree
full of blossoms and fruit."
     Convey reverential greeting to the maid-servant of
God, ......... and say:  "Happy is thy condition


+P 697
that thou art meek and humble and directed to the
Kingdom of God and looking to God.  I ask God that,
day by day, thou mayest become more illumined and
more spiritual."
     Be in sympathy with ......... and in the utmost of
kindness.  Close thine eyes to shortcomings and live
according to the divine teachings.  I hope that the breath
of life may penetrate them.  Thank God that in the
world of vision thou art witnessing great signs.
     In great tenderness blow the breath of life into
......... and ......... and call them to God.  Perchance,
through divine bounty and providence, their
hearts may become radiant and illumined and may
remain firm and steadfast through trials.
     To be far in body is of no account.  To be near in
spirit is essential.  Seek that from God.  When thou
hast attained that, thou art always with me.


O thou ignited candle!

     The real light is the light of the love o God.  Praise
be to God! thy face is illumined by the radiance of the
divine love and thy nostrils are perfumed through the
fragrances of the garden of the Kingdom of Abha,
and thou art engaged, night and day, in service in this
divine garden and art spreading the Tablets of Abdul-Baha.
Wherefore, thank thou God that thou art
assisted to such a service.


O thou who art gazing toward the Kingdom!

     Thy letter was received.  its contents became known.
Thank thou God that thy house became the shelter and


+P 698
the nest of the birds of the Kingdom.  The spiritual
assembly was arranged.  Abdul-Baha, in His heart, was
present in your gathering and His spirit was gazing
upon you.
     In order to render thanks for this gift, you must become
engaged in creating harmony and union to such
an extent that all of you may become as one soul and
one spirit; that you may become waves of one sea,
breezes of one rose-garden, flowers of one meadow and
trees of one orchard.  You must devote your time to
the training of yourselves and the guidance of souls.
     Thy house is my house.  Therefore, it must become
adorned with the lights of the Kingdom.


O thou who hast turned thy face toward the Kingdom!

     What thou hast written was read.  Convey my loving
greeting to ......... and say:  "Every soul who
was deprived of the Kingdom of God in the day of
Christ was disappointed in the other world.  Now be
thou a seeker of Truth with all thy soul and heart and
receive thou the reflection of guidance, so that thou
mayest not become sad and disappointed in the other
realm."
     O my Juliet!  In this glorious age the divine confirmations
are like unto the rays of the sun.  The hearts
and souls are like unto the surface of crystal.  The
clearer the crystal the greater the refulgence of the sunlight.
     Praise be to God! that the door of servitude is already
opened before thy face.  Therefore, be thou the
cause of happiness to the souls of the friends of God;
impart thou attraction and exhilaration to others and


+P 699
suffer them to quaff the wine of bounty from the cup of
the most great guidance, in order that they may open
wings like unto birds and soar upward, upward to the
realm of the Kingdom.
     Thou hast written:  "So that the friends may discover
the Truth, become like unto a flaming torch and
change the darkness of that country into illumination."
This statement was of the utmost sweetness.  My heart
was rejoiced by reading it.  The second statement of
thy letter was this:  "In order that we may demonstrate
this manifest light to others through deeds and actions."
This also was of the utmost eloquence and beauty.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  The penetration of
the word of man dependeth upon the heat of the fire
of the love of God.  The more the splendors of the
love of God become manifest in the heart, the greater
will be the penetration of the Word.
     I hope that thou, O my Juliet, with ........., will
become confirmed in the service and arise to the good
pleasure of the True One.


O thou beloved maid-servant of God!

     The letter was received and a sweet fragrance was
inhaled from the rose-garden of its significances.  Glad-tidings
be unto thee that thou hast become the object
of such county and hast attained to the Kingdom of the
Lord of Hosts.  I hope that thou mayest progress day
by day in the spiritual attributes, the beauty of deeds,
the knowledge of the True One and the love of God,
and that thou mayest grow nearer and nearer to the
threshold of the Almighty.
     Convey on my behalf greeting and salutation to his


+P 700
honor Prof. ........ I desire from my heart and
soul that he may become a cause of the illumination of
the world, hoist the ensign of gift and point out the
light of the Kingdom to the eyes.
     Announce respectful greeting to the attracted maid-servant
of God, Mrs. .........  In reality, she is
spiritual and illumined and hath arisen to the requirements
of service.  You must exercise toward her the
utmost respect and consideration.
     Show thou on my behalf loving kindness to .........
and rejoice her heart by the gift of the most great glad-tidings.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  The utmost desire of
the lordly ones is the union of the friends, the agreement
of the believers and the spiritual communication
of the hearts; in order that they may shine in this darkened
world like unto bright stars; educate all the communities
of the world like unto bright stars; educate all the communities
of the world in the precepts of love; be kind
and benevolent to every one, sympathetic and compassionate
to all; to become the cool and pure water to
every thirsty one, a heavenly table to every hungry one,
a swift healing antidote to every sick one and the cause
of the everlasting glory to every humiliated one.
     Convey on my behalf respectful greeting to all the
maid-servants of the Merciful One and the friends of
God.


O thou who art enkindled with the fire of the Love of
     God!

     Thou art a beloved daughter in the Kingdom of
Abha and art respected in the presence of Abdul-Baha.
Truly, I declare, thou art engaged in the service of the


+P 701
Cause of God from all directions, art familiar with the
glorification of the Most Great name and art intimate
in spreading the fragrances of holiness.  God is pleased
with thee, I am pleased with thee and the angels of the
Supreme Concourse are pleased with thee.
     It is hoped, from the bounty of His Highness the
Almighty, that thou mayest find such ecstasy and exhilaration
and so ignite the fire of the love of God that
thou mayest bring the regions of America near to the
Kingdom of Abha.


O maid-servant of the Beauty of Abha!

     The valued epistle was received and the contents understood.
By its reading and perusal the utmost of
spirit and fragrance was obtained, for it indicated that
during the period of cessation of communication, no
failure obtained in the delivery of the Word of God.
     O servant of the Kingdom!  Know for a certainty
that this light of reality shall eventually envelop the
world, illuminating the East and the West entirely.
     That dear maid-servant of God [i.e., thyself] is in
reality the servant of the Cause of God and in future
thou wilt be more confirmed.
     I pray for .........
     Convey my great respect to the attracted maid-servants
of God, Mrs. ......... and Mrs. .........,
and say:  "Praise God for having found the treasury
of the Kingdom and that in the Threshold of the Kingdom
of the Lord ye are very dear and are of the maid-servants
of the Beauty of Abha."
     Convey my message to his honor ......... and say:
"Thank God that thou became a sign of the divine


+P 702
blessing and the cause of guiding the people.  I hope
day by day thou wilt become more illumined and eloquent
until thou mayest guide a great number of people."


O thou attracted one of the Kingdom!

     The epistle was received; likewise the enclosed epistle
was read.  The personage (Mr. .........) is in reality
enraptured with the truth and seeketh the discovery of
the mysteries of God.  His intention is blessed and his
efforts (directed toward) the development of the world
of humanity.
     The various sects who consider themselves servants
of the world of humanity are possessed of good
intention, but they are inert, not active; captive, not free;
silent, not eloquent; slow, not fast.  They have sluggish
movement and great intention.  These tow do not agree
(or unite).
     Many a good intention was there in the world of existence
which left no trace, for it was not confirmed by
the effective power.  But the good intentions of the beloved
of God and the merciful projects of the real
friends are enforced by the power of the Word of God;
therefore, it is effective and quick in action and the
means of life to the world of humanity.  Thank thou
God that He hath provided such a means for thee that
by divine aid, heavenly confirmation, merciful intention
and heavenly power thou mayest arise to serve, so that
thou mayest see wonderful signs and marvelous results.
     The good news of the unity and concord of the
friends of New York proved a great source of Joy.  The
original intention and the divine foundation is the unification


+P 703
of the world of humanity.  Therefore, this
merciful reality must first find realization among the
friends (Bahais), so that it may affect other souls.
     Today the world and the people are under the shadow
of divine providence, the light of the Sun of Reality
hath been shed upon the world of minds and thoughts;
hence, light is seen everywhere.


O thou illumined maid-servant of God!

     Thy letter was received.  Praise be to God! that thou
art assisted and confirmed and, through the light of the
love of God, thou art an ignited candle.  Thou hast an
eloquent tongue and a pure heart; thou art attracted to
the Kingdom and wondering, in awe and astonishment,
at the power and dominion of the Lord of Hosts.
     Exercise infinite kindness and convey longing greeting
on my behalf to Miss .........
     Thank God that thou hast found a way to the treasury
of the Kingdom and hast attained to the heavenly
wealth.
     I supplicate God that the hearts and souls of .........
and ......... receive a share from the love of God,
and that ......... find a portion from the divine bestowal
and be assisted with heavenly confirmations, so
that she may help thee.


O thou who art attracted to the Beauty of God!

     Thy letter was received.  I ask from God, supplicating
and entreating in the Threshold of Oneness, that
thy utmost desire may become realized.  The desire of
the sanctified souls is always for sacrifice in the path of


+P 704
God, attraction by the merciful fragrances, the vivification
of souls, the proclamation of universal peace, the
establishment of the oneness of humanity and the enkindlement
of the fire of the love of God in the hearts
of men.  It is my hope that the desire of the friends of
God be as such, so that they may be released from the
influence of the ephemeral world, shine in the Kingdom
of eternity, be exhilarated by the wine of the love of
God and, like unto the tempestuous sea, rage and roar
with the ardor of the love of God.  I desire this
station for thee.


O thou who art preparing to receive knowledge from
     the Herald of the Kingdom!

     I have read thy letter in which thou showed thy
desire toward the divine teachings and the texts of
the knowledge of Truth.  Blessed thou art and more
blessed thou shalt be if thy feet be firm, thy heart
tranquil through the fragrance of His Holy Spirit
and thy secret and hidden thoughts pure before the
Lord of Hosts!  Then, by God the Truth! the hosts
of the angels of the Kingdom shall surround thee and
convey to all thy limbs and veins the Spirit of Life;
thy tongue shall utter fluently and distinctly the most
eloquent and clear words and thoughts; thy bosom
shall be cheered with joy through the appearance of
the evident texts; thy face shall be illuminated, among
the daughters of the Kingdom, with the light of firmness;
the door of glad-tidings shall be opened before thy
face and thou shalt receive knowledge through the
symbolic signs descending from the heavenly Kingdom
in the Books and Tablets!


+P 705
O thou who are supplicating to God and turning to
     the Spirit of His Kingdom!

     I have read the texts of thy praise to God on the
occasion of the arrival of my letter to thee.  Know thou,
that letter sent to thee by me, was only because of my
perfect love for thee and my pity upon thee, for I had
the desire that the fragrance of the Holy Spirit, which
hath perfumed all regions and imbued the entire body of
the world with the Spirit of Life, should pass over
thee and abide with thee.  Notwithstanding the high
position it occupieth, still, with an eloquent tongue,
through which the Spirit moveth, hearts are attracted
and bosoms burn, it speaketh to the pure hearts and
to the good and righteous souls in every spot of the
earth.  This is the powerful Spirit, the dazzling light,
the brilliant star and the overwhelming and universal
abundance.  And, from its traces, spread and divulged
everywhere, thou wilt know and realize its influence and
comprehend its radiance.  I ask God to expose thee by
its coals of fire and illuminate thee by its brightness.
Turn thyself wholly to it - thus thou shalt be enabled
to ascertain its influence and power, the strength of
its life and the greatness of its confirmation.  Verily, I
say unto thee, that if for the appearance of that Divine
Essence thou desirest to have a definite proof, and indisputable
testimony and a strong, convincing evidence,
thou must prepare thyself to make thy heart empty and
thine eye ready to look only toward the Kingdom of
God.  Then, at that time, the radiance of that widespread
effulgence will descend upon thee successively,
and that motion rendered thee by the Holy Spirit will


+P 706
make thee dispense with any other strong evidence that
leadeth to the appearance of this Light, because the
greatest and strongest proof for showing the abundance
of the Spirit to the bodies is the very appearance
of its power and influence in those bodies.
     Think deeply of this in order to know the reality of
my explanation and demonstration.


O thou that virtuous soul and individual who art ready
     for the confirmation of the Holy Spirit!

     I, with the utmost clemency, have read thy brilliant
letter which showeth thine advancement toward the
Kingdom of God and the excessive preparation for the
effulgence of the lights of God and the greatest tendency
for the baptism of the Spirit of God and thy pleasure
at the glad-tidings of God, thine attraction by the
fragrance of God and thy gladness in the love of God.
May God strengthen thee so thou mayest come nearer
to God, to separate thyself from aught else save Him
and to assist thee in spreading His lights and uttering
the abundance of His mysteries, to perfume thy nostrils
with the fragrance of His holiness and to prepare
for thee the heavenly table, that thou mayest taste the
delight of His loving-kindness.  I now assure thee, O
servant of God, that, if thy mind become empty and
pure from every mention and thought and thy heart
attracted wholly to the Kingdom of God, forget all
else besides God and come in communion with the
Spirit of God, then the Holy Spirit will assist thee
with a power which will enable thee to penetrate all
things, and a Dazzling Spark which enlightens all
sides, a Brilliant Flame in the zenith of the heavens,


+P 707
will teach thee that which thou dost not know of the
facts of the universe and of the divine doctrine.  Verily,
I say unto thee, every soul which ariseth today to guide
others to the path of safety and infuse in them the
Spirit of Life, the Holy Spirit will inspire that soul
with evidences, proofs and facts and the lights will
shine upon it from the Kingdom of God.  Do not
forget what I have conveyed unto thee from the breath
of the Spirit.  Verily, it is the shining morning and
the rosy dawn which will impart unto thee the lights, reveal
the mysteries and make thee competent in science,
and through it the pictures of the Supreme World
will be printed in thy heart and the facts of the secrets
of the Kingdom of God will shine before thee.  Christ
said - glory be to Him! - "Many are called but few
chosen."  Thank thou thy Lord for He hath made thee
of the chosen.  By my life! verily, this is a station
which God giveth to whomsoever He pleaseth.  Know
its value and appreciate it according to its desserts!
Arise with all thy power to answer [i.e., to perform]
all that is necessary to obtain this grace and bounty
and be strengthened in all circumstances and conditions
of this existence.  how many noble-minded women,
who were the queens of all provinces and countries, have
died and passed away and thou no longer hearest any
mention of them; but every servant of the servants of
the Merciful, who were in the past decades and centuries,
owing to their bright faces illumined by the lights
of truth and knowledge, their stars shine until today
in the horizon of the highest and their rays dazzle in
the mirrors of the world and their fame is divulged in
the Supreme World and their sanctification spread in


+P 708
the Kingdom of God; and if - God forbid! - the foot
of man deviate as did that of Judas, so that he became
human after he was divine and sold the blood of Christ
for a small and trifling sum - verily, there is in that
a great lesson to the people of understanding!
     Although I am far away from thee in body, still I
am near unto thee in spirit.  But I ask God that the
body will follow the spirit and out meeting will be
facilitated.  The most essential thing is the spiritual
relation, the hearty friendship and the heavenly attraction.
Thou must accomplish this.


O thou gem of the Kingdom and brilliant leaf!

     Verily, I have read thy letter which showeth how
thou art turning unto God, moved by the breath of
God, drawn by the Spirit of God and how the mystery
of existence, the image of the Lord of Hosts, was revealed
unto thee.  This indicates that God shall open
before thee the doors of revelation and the Spirit of
Truth shall confirm thee with evident signs.
     Seeing this servant in thy prayers is a proof of the
ideal nearness, of the spiritual unity and of the impression
that was printed within thine own consciousness.
At all times I do supplicate to the divine Kingdom
to make thy heart a pure, clear and polished mirror, facing
the most glorious Kingdom, El-Abha, that the pictures
of the Supreme Concourse may be printed in it,
and this is exactly what was meant in the Bible by this
text:  "Let us create man after our own image and
likeness."
     To see repeatedly is an evidence that the vision will
take place both in the spirit and body; but separation


+P 709
and union, parting and meeting are things which belong
to the material body.  The spirit is sanctified from
association, departure, nearness, remoteness, connection
and separation, for these are of the properties of material
bodies and of the characteristics of the elementary
facts; but the Spirit is everlastingly in the station of its
loftiness and supremacy in a similar way to the sun
which is continually stationed in its sphere orbit; its appearance
and disappearance signify the clearness of the
place and the fineness of the body which is facing it,
and as long as the confronting surface continues to be
in a well-polished condition, the lights of the sun will
then appear in it; but when it becometh rough and impure,
the lights disappear.
     Consequently, it hath been proven that nearness and
remoteness signify smoothness, clearness and fineness;
or rust, impurity and roughness, respectively.
     And if God wisheth, through the clearness of the
heart, we will be continually in the assembly of alliance
and friendship, resting permanently in the spiritual and
heavenly realm, adoring and worshipping God, meeting
and uniting by the holy fragrances, drawn by the magnet
of the love of God and thanking Him for this great
bounty and evident victory.
     As to our meeting materially (i.e., face to face), I
ask God that He may ordain this for us in the way He
deemeth best.
     Then know, O thou virtuous soul, that as soon as
thou becometh separated from aught else save God and
dost cut thyself from the worldly things, thy heart will
shine with the lights of divinity and with the effulgence
of the Sun of Truth from the horizon of the Realm of


+P 710
Might, and then thou wilt be filled by the spirit of
power from God and become capable of doing that
which thou desirest.  This is the confirmed truth.
     As to the desire shown by thee towards serving holy
and spiritual souls, it is indeed of the best desires and
of the most noble qualities.  Blessed is he who is
strengthened and confirmed by such a desire during all
his life, in the hope of attaining eternal life.
     As to thee, O thou being who art attracted to God,
announce the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of God
through the breaths of the Holy Spirit; for He will
confirm thee in a similar manner to the confirmation He
bestowed upon the holy souls in the past decades and
former ages.


O thou who art attracted to the "Spirit of Truth!"

     At this moment I remember thee while the cup of
my tongue is overflowing with the wine of God's praise
and I address thee in a spirit whereby the hearts of all
the creation are cheerfully moved.
     Know thou, verily, the Spirit hath indeed so surrounded
my limbs that it moveth them as it willeth and
my tongue uttereth the most wonderful speeches and
most sweet words while addressing thee, so that thou
mayest be moved by these holy fragrances which perfume
all regions and be dilated with joy by this address
which is raised from my abundant love for thee and my
excessive kindness and great affection unto thee.
     o maid-servant of God!  Verily, the Holy Spirit
breathes, in this day, unto the hearts which are moving,
beating, pure and attracted by the love of God.


+P 711
     Abandon thou every occupation and be engaged in
the affairs of thy Lord and serve the "Spirit of Truth"
which hath poured a spiritual, divine and everlasting
life upon the brilliant hearts.
     O maid-servant of God!  By God the True One, verily,
the crown of mighty gift is suspended betwixt heaven
and earth and the angels of holiness are awaiting a lofty
head which may be worthy of this great bestowal, so
that it may descend upon that head, that it may wear
that glorious crown, the most precious gems of which
illumine the eyes of all the world.
     O maid-servant of God!  Many spiritual women
came (into the world) and passed away in vain; no
sound is heard of them and no trace is seen of them,
inasmuch as their spirits were not dependent upon the
Holy Spirit, nor were they attracted to the fragrances
of truth; nor were they ever baptized by the water of
life, by the fire of the love of God, nor by the "Spirit
of Truth" which speaketh in the assemblies of the Kingdom
and breatheth upon spirits the breezes which waft
an eternal glory, the signs of which are everlasting.


O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!

     I was informed of thy recent letter which indicated
thine abundant love for God, thine attraction to the
Kingdom of God and thy reliance upon the Word of
God.
     Verily, I address thee, with the tongue of my spirit,
such an address which is life to hearts and souls, light
to existent beings and is joy and fragrance.  Hearken
unto this address and be dilated in breast for the emanation
of this letter.


+P 712
     Be thou a breath of life, a banner of salvation and a
manifest sign in this great world, so that thou mayest
become a lamp of reconciliation and peace, a banner of
love and attraction, a star of guidance among mankind,
(and be thou) humble, meek and a servant to the
maid-servants of the Merciful One.  Unfurl the sail
of spirit on the ship of guidance and hoist the banner
of piety in those regions, so that the everlasting light
may shine forth upon all parts.
     Verily, I am cognizant of the sincerity of thine
intention and the purity of thine heart.  Therefore, I
address thee with this great address, so that thou mayest
impart the "Greatest Name" to whomsoever thou findest
prepared for entering the Kingdom of God.
     We have sent letters for the names which were written
in thy letter.  We have also sent [stones of the]
Greatest Name and roses which express the redness of
my blood which I beg of God to be shed in the path
of God.
     Then, know thou, verily, I will always associate thee
with the fragrances of the Spirit and will continually
rejoice thee at the glad-tidings of god.  I beg of God
to enable thee to diffuse the spirit of life (i.e., to teach
this truth0, to herald the Kingdom of God, to speak
the praise of God and to be wholly attracted to the Word
of God, so that thou mayest become a well-rooted tree
in the garden of the Kingdom, its fruits within reach,
its wide-spread branches overshadowing those regions.


O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of Holiness!

     Verily, I read thy words in which thou hast thanked
God for His great kindness and providence after those


+P 713
Tablets reached thee, for the bounty of their significances
which hath shone forth upon thee.  Verily, they are
Tablets the words of which have proceeded from a
heart which is filled with the love of God, is free and
isolated from all else save God, is illumined and over-flowing
with the bounties of the Kingdom of El-Abha
and in which the verses of unity are traced through the
breath of the spirit of the gift of God.
     O maid-servant of God!  It is incumbent upon thee
to learn that which the spirit of Abdul-Baha poureth
upon thee.  Look not at thy capacity and ability; nay,
look at the grace of thy Lord in these days and at the
gift of His Kingdom, the like of which hath never been
seen by the eye of existence in former cycles.
     Verily existence is a parched ground and the bounty
of the Kingdom is a copious rain.  The ground of existence
shall surely be developed into myrtles of the
wisdom of God, for the fragrances of holiness have
encompassed the earth, east and west, the glad-tidings
of God have successively come from the Kingdom of
heaven and the Sun of Truth hath shone forth to all
regions with the greatest effulgence.  Impart thou the
Greatest Name to the ears, so that all may call out
among nations: "O Thou Baha' of the world!  O Thou
Sun of Pre-existence!"
     Truly, I say unto thee, this blessed Name is the spirit
of life, the deliverer from death, the word of salvation
and of manifest signs!  Thou shalt surely hear from
all parts the cry, "Ya Baha El-Abha!" reaching to the
Supreme Concourse.
     Deliver my spiritual greeting to thy spiritual son and
to his revered wife whose name is near to thy name.


+P 714
Deliver my greeting to thy spiritual daughter, the
revered ......... and tell her: "O my dear daughter!
Turn unto the Kingdom of thy Lord and be benefited
by spiritual bounties.  Be attracted by the fragrances of
holiness - such an attraction which may breather life into
dead souls, quicken them by a pure life and may illumine
their sights with the light which is shining forth
to all the world in this glorious century and new age."
     Deliver my praise to the maid-servant of God, .........
and say unto her:  "Verily, thou hast seen the physical
picture of Abdul-Baha printed by the rays of the phenomenal
sun (i.e., his photograph) and thine eyes became
overflowing with tears.  Beg thou of God that
He may show unto thee his (Abdul-Baha's) spiritual
picture printed by the ray shining forth from the Merciful
Kingdom.  Then the attractions of God shall overtake
thee and make thee as a spark of fire aflame with
the heat of the love of God."
     O maid-servant of God!  It is incumbent upon thee
to visit his holiness Mirza Abul Fazl, so that thou mayest
learn from him the arguments and decisive texts in
the holy Bible concerning the appearance of the Kingdom
of God in this great cycle.  Verily, his visit+F1 is a
prize unto thee, a hoard+F2 unto thee, a consolation unto
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily, Mr. .........
is an excellent man, exerting all his powers to diffuse
fragrances of God.  God shall surely strengthen

him in a great matter and make him a banner waving
through the winds of confirmation upon this glorious
castle.
     As to my drinking the sup of sacrifice: By the Lord
of heaven, this is my utmost hope, the joy of my heart,
the consolation of my soul and my final desire.  Thou
shouldst pray God that He may prepare this hope for
me and ordain for me this mighty gift and that he may
give me to quaff this cup which is overflowing with the
wine of faithfulness in the path of Baha'.
     O maid-servant of God!  When I had thy letter in
my hand, I was in such a condition that the breeze of
the love of God cheered me and I was thereby moved
with such joy that the place was filled with the spirit of
the love of God.  No doubt thy heart hath been also
impressed by this spiritual joy, merciful attraction and
ecstatic love.


O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!

     Verily, I read thy letter of graceful expressions and
eloquent composition and was rejoiced in heart at the
feelings sent forth from thy pure heart.  Verily, I invoke
God that He may bestow upon thee the confirmation
of the Spirit in all moments, so that thou mayest
direct (or guide) people to the glorified and praised
One, hold the cup of the love of God in thy hand, give
it to drink to every thirsty [one], heal every sick person
and nourish every hungry one with this table (or
food) which hath descended from heaven.
     As to thy question concerning the registering of the
names of those to whom thou hast given the "Greatest


+P 716
Name," there is no obstacle (or harm) in this.  Verily,
thy Lord will enroll their names upon the scroll of the
Kingdom and the angels of heaven will bless them with
the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of Abha.
     As to what thou hast said concerning the longing
and the burning of thy revered daughter with the fire
of the love of God:  I beg of God to make her a sign
of salvation and a light scintillating in the Supreme
Apex.
     As to what thou hast written concerning thy coming
(to Acca):  For the present this is not consistent with
wisdom.  When the opportunity cometh, at an appointed
time, we will summon thee to come; and this is a
glad-tidings unto thee and the greatest joy and happiness.
     O maid-servant of God!  It is incumbent upon thee
to boil forth like unto the fire ablaze in Sinai, so that
thou mayest attract hearts unto the Kingdom of the
Merciful.  This is a gift which the dominion of the
world cannot equal!


O thou lamp who art enkindled with the fire of the
     Love of God!

     Verily, I read thy recent letter which showed thy
strong love, thy being ablaze with the fire of the love
of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praised, and the penetration
of the Spirit of Truth in thy limbs, nerves, veins,
arteries, bones, blood and flesh, until it hath taken the
reins of power from thy hands and moveth thee as it
willeth, causeth thee to speak in what it willeth and attracteth
thee as it willeth.  This is becoming of whatever
heart is replenished with the spirit of the love of


+P 717
God.  Thou shalt surely behold wondrous traces and
shalt discover the signs of thy Mighty Lord.
     O maid-servant of God!  The meaning which thou
hast apprehended from my former statement is the real
fact.  It is the meaning of (my) statement; God hath
strengthened thee therein and shall surely confirm thee
in still greater than this.  At that time thou wilt say:
"This is that which was promised by Abdul-Baha and
His promise was certain and decided."
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily, thy Lord hath
breathed the spirit of argument into thy mouth.  Speak
thou in the most wonderful explanation and meditate
not at the time of advancing proofs, evidences and signs,
and speak thou that which the Spirit inspireth thee.
This is a proof unto thee and unto every just one among
the possessors of understanding.
     O maid-servant of God!  Verily, I am with thee in
spirit and reveal unto thee the word of guidance at
every moment and time.
     O maid-servant of God!  We have sent thee nine
ring stones of the Greatest Name.  This is an allusion
unto thee of a matter which thou shalt surely understand
henceforth.  We have also sent unto thee a photograph
of His Holiness the glorious Badi whom thy Lord did
send to His Highness Nassir-ed'Din-Shah with a manifest
epistle by which He perfected the proof and evidence
to the people of Persia.  this faithful messenger
(Badi) took the epistle of Baha' with all power and
authority and repaired to the threshold of His Highness
the Shah, while cheered and smiling in joy.  He then
presented himself before the Shah and said:  "This is


+P 718
an epistle from Baha'o'llah," and then presented it to
him.  They arrested him and after severe torture and
punishment, delivered him to the executioners.  he was
sitting between the executioners at the time of his death
with all dignity, while turning unto God.


O thou candle of the Love of God!

     What thou hast written was considered.  The contents
were spiritual and the sentiments merciful.  Praise
be to God! that thou art attracted to the Beauty of
Abha and severed from the world.  Thy face hast
glowed like unto fire and thou hast consumed the veils
of superstitions.  Thou hast opened thine eyes to the
Sun of Truth and inhaled the fragrant odor from the
garment of the divine Joseph.  Thy mission now is this:
Travel as much as possible to different parts in America,
pass through cities and villages (or towns), guide all
to the Beauty of Abha and raise the call of the Kingdom
and say:  "O greatest of glad-tidings, for the Sun
of Truth of the Beauty of Abha hath dawned from the
horizon
of the contingent world and illumined the regions
with the lights of the mightiest guidance!  The
reality of the Pentateuch and the Gospel have become
manifest and the mysteries of the heavenly Books have
appeared!  Now is the age of the Merciful One and the
time of joy and gladness!  O ye heedless ones, be ye
conscious!  O ye sleepers, be ye awake!  O ye blind
ones, see!  O ye deaf ones, hear!  O ye dumb ones,
speak!  O ye dead ones, be quickened!  O ye destitute
ones, receive a portion and share!  It is the irradiation
of the Merciful One and the moving of the boundless
sea!  It is the bounty of the wonderful springtime and


+P 719
the downpour of the rain of the gift of the Great
Lord!"  This is thy mission.
     Send greeting to the maid-servant fo God, Miss
........, and say,  "As the love of God hath the utmost
penetration in thy heart, the ring-stone bearing the
Greatest Name will take effect in thy heart like unto a
strong wine, for capacity is great and the power of the
wine is intense.  Therefore, there wilt not remain any
power or resistance."+F1
     Looking upon the picture which thou hast sent caused
great delight, joy and fragrance.  God willing, thine
actual picture (or form) will also become present
(here).
     When thou wert present at Acca, the seeds of the
love of God were sown in thy heart, through the power
of the Spirit.  At that time they were not so much
manifest.  Now that pure seed is growing more verdant
and refreshed, day by day, and becometh more manifest.
This is why thou findest thyself possessing more and
more spiritual sentiments.


     +F2 The contents of thy last letter were extremely rejoicing,
for they were a glorious evidence of the glowing
of the fire of the love of God, of attainment to the
gift of God and of the spiritual connection of the
spirits.  Forasmuch as hearts are like unto mirrors,
when the light of the love of God is enkindled, brilliant
rays will reflect and merciful phenomena become manifest
and clear.  Physical nearness or remoteness is of
no importance; the essential fact is the spiritual affinity

and ideal nearness.  Judas Iscariot was for a long time
favored in the holy court of His Holiness Christ, yet
he was entirely far and remote; while Paul, the apostle,
was in close embrace with His Holiness.  The Egyptian
carrier of glad-tidings was the bearer of the garment
of Joseph, yet he could not inhale the fragrance of the
garment.  His holiness Jacob, in Canaan, longed for
meeting (Joseph), yet he was near and inhaled the
fragrance of the garment.  Consequently, it is evident
that one can certainly and surely inhale the perfume of
affinity even from a far distance.  I beg of God that
He may strengthen and solidify such connections between
the friends (believers), so that the spiritual
unity may become a manifest light and the earthly
world may become a camping-place for the heavenly
hosts.
     O thou dear maid-servant of God!  Be thou aglow
and illumined and be thou enkindled in soul with the
fire of the love of God in every assemblage.  Be not
quiet for a moment and do not seek composure even for
an hour (i.e., be active in spreading the light).  Be
thou a cause for the illumining of hearts and spiritualizing
of souls.  Always communicate about this (truth)
with that great personage in France and write to him:
"No matter how clear, pure and polished a mirror may
be, not until it is turned unto the Sun of Truth will it
find glorious bounty and become reflective of rays."

O thou servant of the Beauty of Abha!

     We considered all that thou hast written.  It seems
that the maid-servant of God, Mrs. ........., hath
arisen to deliver (the truth).  If she advanceth in this


+P 721
manner, maketh more effort and day by day groweth
in spirituality, sincerity, devotion and severance, in a
short time she will become purely merciful and will
spiritualize others; she will progress in the stations of
sanctity and purity; she will become the possessor of a
fluent speech and will find her heart brilliant and full
of serenity and faith to such an extent that her pure
breath will so take effect even in stone, tree and clay
(i.e., in all people), that she, herself, will be astonished.
When the interior parts of musical instruments
become clear and polished, their tone will take effect
and warm the hearts.  I hope the maid-servant of God,
Mrs. ........., may attain to this degree, for she is
capable.


O thou who art attracted to the Holy Spirit!

     It is some time since news hath come from thee,
though I have the utmost kindness toward that favored
maid-servant of the Threshold of the Almighty.  I beg
of God that the power of the Spirit will cause in thee
such an ecstasy and attraction that thou mayest be the
cause of everlasting life to the seekers; mayest hold a
cup of the knowledge of God in thy hand and give people
to drink the wine of the love of God; that thou
mayest exhilarate the souls, awaken the heedless, bring
the ignorant to consciousness, make the blind seeing,
quicken the dead, enkindle the faded souls and refresh
the withered ones.
     Convey greeting and praise to the favored maid-servant
of God, thy revered daughter.  Also, announce
thou on my behalf the confirmations of the Holy Spirit
unto the other maid-servants of the Merciful One.


+P 722
     O thou divinely attracted one!  If thou wishest for
the illumination of the Kingdom, exert thyself in steadfastness
as much as thou canst and resist thou the tests,
so that thou mayest, like unto a lamp, illumine the
world and bestow everlasting life, like unto the Spirit.


O thou flame of the Love of God!

     What thou hast written caused joy, for that letter
was like unto a rose-garden whose roses of significances
bestowed the sweet odor of the love of God upon the
nostrils.  Similarly, my answers to thy letters will, like
unto rain and dew, bestow infinite purity and freshness
upon those myrtles of significances which have blossomed
in the garden of the heart.
     thou hast written concerning the tests that have
come upon thee.  To the sincere ones, tests are as a
gift from God, the Exalted, for a heroic person hasteneth,
with the utmost joy and gladness, to the tests of a
violent battlefield, but the coward is afraid and trembles
and utters moaning and lamentation.  Likewise,
an expert student prepareth and memorizeth his lessons
and exercises with the utmost effort, and in the
day of examination he appeareth with infinite joy before
the master.  Likewise, the pure gold shineth radiantly
in the fire of test.  Consequently, it is made clear
that for holy souls, trials are as the gift of God, the
Exalted; but for weak souls they are an unexpected
calamity.  This test is just as thou hast written: it removeth
the rust of egotism from the mirror of the
heart until the Sun of Truth may shine therein.  For,
no veil is greater than egotism and no matter how thin
that covering may be, yet it will finally veil man entirely


+P 723
and prevent him from receiving a portion from
the eternal bounty.
     O thou attracted maid-servant of God!  When the
men and maid-servants of God pass in my mind, I feel
the heat of the love of God and I pray the Almighty
God to assist those blessed souls with the invisible hosts.
Praise be to God! the prophecies of all the prophets
have become manifest and are fulfilled in this holy and
blessed age and this great day of Baha'o'llah!
     O thou attracted maid-servant of God!  Nearness
is, in reality, of the soul, not of the body, and help and
receptivity of help are spiritual, not physical.  Notwithstanding
this, I hope that thou mayest attain nearness
in every respect.  Be thou assured that the divine bounties
will so encompass holy souls even as the light of
the sun doth the moon and stars.
     Convey thou, on behalf of Abdul-Baha, the sweet
odor of the fragrances of holiness to the nostrils of
each one of the friends of God and the maid-servants
of the Merciful and inspire and encourage thou all of
them to diffuse the fragrances of God (i.e., to teach
the truth).


O thou dear sister!

     The letter arrived at a time when - praise be to
God! - calamities and sufferings in the path of God
have surrounded us from every direction and arrows
and darts are flying from every bow.  But, through the
love of His Holiness Baha'o'llah, we, in this intense
darkness, are like unto a shining torch, and while in
this tempest of calamities, we are turning toward the
Kingdom of the Almighty and engaged in remembering


+P 724
thee.  We do not consider this calamity as billows
of the sea of afflictions and sufferings; nay, it is the
ark of deliverance and the shore of peace and security.
     Praise be to God! according to the commandments
and exhortations of Baha'o'llah, we are the well-wisher
of all governments and act toward all the nations
of the world in peace and love.  We have no intention
but that which is good and no desire but the
good pleasure of God.  We mean well toward every
people and seek to have sincerity and good-will toward
every government.  In return for arrows and swords,
we present milk and honey and we heal the deadly
poison with the swift healing antidote.  Night and day
we are in action and exertion, in order to dress the
wounds and cure the pain (of the people), to care for
the afflicted and comfort even the ill-natured one, so
that, through the assistance and favor of God, this
darkness of selfish prejudice shall vanish and the error
of folly and ignorance shall be changed into divine
guidance.
     O thou dear sister!  Whenever the daughters of the
Kingdom are ready in the Presence, they become initiated
into the mystery and are always companions and
associates (with us).
     Convey respectful greeting to the favored maid-servant
of God, Mrs. ........., and tell her:  "Be
thou assured in the divine favors and rejoice in the
glad-tidings of the Merciful One."
     I hope the maid-servants of the Merciful will day
by day increase in faith and assurance.
     I send thee a few stones (of the Greatest Name).
     All the holy leaves send greeting to thee.


+P 725
O thou beloved maid-servant of God!

     Thy letter was received and it produced joy and
fragrance.  Its contents were of the utmost sweetness.
Whatsoever thou mayest write I will read with great
attention.
     Praise be to God! thou hast consumed the veils and
become enkindled with the fire of the love of God.
thank thou God for this.
     Mr. ......... hath been delighted with your city,
for he hath inhaled the fragrance fo the love of God
from it.
     Although thy visit to Acca in the year 1899 was
short, yet it was the breath of life.  Later on its traces
will become manifest.
     I hope that the divine mysteries may become revealed
to thee at all time.  Become thou engaged in
teaching the truth, for the teaching of the Cause containeth
the power of a magnet; it attracteth the mysteries
of God.
     Regarding my freedom:  To me prison is freedom;
to me incarceration is an open court; to me humility is
identical with glory; to me adversity is a gift and death
is life.  I hope that thou wilt also take a portion from
this sea and seek a reflection from these lights, becoming
and ignited lamp so that the winds of contradiction
will not blow it out, and day by day more revelation
and vision may descend, and thou be enkindled more
than before with the fire of the love of God.
     Convey respectful greeting to the maid-servants of
the Merciful One.  I supplicate God that they may
add to their faith and assurance every moment.


+P 726
O thou sign of the Kingdom and the bird singing with
     the most wonderful melodies in the rose-garden
     of Paradise!

     Verily, I have considered the meanings of thy brilliant
letter which was of most eloquent expression and
found it overflowing with praise, thanksgiving, sanctification,
supplication and invocation toward the Supreme
Kingdom.  By my life, it was like unto a rose-garden
adorned with the myrtles of realities and truths, wherefrom
the pure fragrances emanated and perfumed the
nostrils and dilated the hearts and souls.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Display thou an effort,
gird up the loins of endeavor, dilate thy breast
and be thou prepared for the manifestation of the
breaths of the Holy Spirit in thine heart.  By God, the
true One, verily, the Holy Spirit confirmeth every
maid-servant who ariseth to spread the fragrances of
God, so that the inhabitants of the whole world cannot
overcome her spiritual strength - for similar things have
happened in the past centuries.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Celebrate the praises
of God; become thou engaged with His mentioning like
unto the tempestuous and roaring torrent rushing down
from the mountains and hills; rend asunder the veils
and coverings, so that the shining lights may become
manifest to the eyes, refreshing the hearts of the righteous
ones with the gentle breezes of the flowers of truth
and the sweet fragrance of the dawn of eternity.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Verily, the bounties
of thy Lord are great and great in this glorious century
and new age; the confirmations are consecutive
and continuous; the rays of the Sun of Truth are shining


+P 727
and sparkling; the stars of guidance are gleaming
and scintillating and the rains of generosity are falling
and flowing!  Blessing is upon the one who taketh a
share from this glorious outpouring and receiveth illumination
from this light which is shining forth from
the firmament of ether.
     O thou maid-servant of God!  Blessed art thou, for
the Temple of the Covenant (Abdul-Baha) hath become
manifest to thee in a dream with incomparable
humility and submission toward God, and that thou hast
beheld that countenance overflowing with yearning, attraction
and love toward the Beauty of the Almighty.
Ere long thou shalt witness a great effect through this
observation, whereby the spirit of life will become manifest
in thee, which is now flowing in the veins of the
contingent beings.  Then thou shalt behold that which
none have seen!  At that time thou shalt fall upon the
ground before God the True One, for He hath favored
thee with this most great bounty.


O thou bird of the Rose-garden of the Kingdom!

     In appearance there hath some time elapsed since
news hath been received from thee, but in spirit the arrival
of the news is uninterrupted.  I hope, from the
bounties of the Exalted, the Quickener of the souls,
that thou mayest not rest for one moment but pulsate
constantly like unto the pulsation of an artery in the
body of the world, to infuse the spirit of life in the souls
and suffer the people to soar up the the zenith of the
Kingdom.
     Undoubtedly, write thou letters and do not stop correspondence
even in appearance.
