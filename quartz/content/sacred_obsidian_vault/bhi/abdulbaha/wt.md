Herein Follow the Tablets and 
Testament of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
 
     ALL-PRAISE TO HIM Who, by the Shield of His Covenant, 
hath guarded the Temple of His Cause from the 
darts of doubtfulness, Who by the Hosts of His Testament hath 
preserved the Sanctuary of His most Beneficent Law and protected 
His Straight and Luminous Path, staying thereby the onslaught 
of the company of Covenant-breakers, that have threatened 
to subvert His Divine Edifice; Who hath watched over 
His Mighty Stronghold and All-Glorious Faith, through the 
aid of men whom the slander of the slanderer affect not, whom 
no earthly calling, glory and power can turn aside from the 
Covenant of God and His Testament, established firmly by His 
clear and manifest words, writ and revealed by His All-Glorious 
Pen and recorded in the Preserved Tablet.  
 
     Salutation and praise, blessing and glory rest upon that 
primal branch of the Divine and Sacred Lote-Tree, grown out, 
blest, tender, verdant and flourishing from the Twin Holy 
Trees; the most wondrous, unique and priceless pearl that doth 
gleam from out the Twin surging seas; upon the offshoots of 
the Tree of Holiness, the twigs of the Celestial Tree, they that 
in the Day of the Great Dividing have stood fast and firm in the 
Covenant; upon the Hands (pillars) of the Cause of God that 
have diffused widely the Divine Fragrances, declared His 
Proofs, proclaimed His Faith, published abroad His Law, detached 
themselves from all things but Him, stood for righteousness 
in this world, and kindled the Fire of the Love of God in 
the very hearts and souls of His servants; upon them that have 
believed, rested assured, stood steadfast in His Covenant and 
followed the Light that after my passing shineth from the 
Dayspring of Divine Guidance--for behold! he is the blest and 
sacred bough that hath branched out from the Twin Holy Trees.  
Well is it with him that seeketh the shelter of his shade that 
shadoweth all mankind.  
 
+P4 
     O ye beloved of the Lord!  The greatest of all things is the 
protection of the True Faith of God, the preservation of His 
Law, the safeguarding of His Cause and service unto His Word.  
Ten thousand souls have shed streams of their sacred blood in 
this path, their precious lives they offered in sacrifice unto Him, 
hastened wrapt in holy ecstasy unto the glorious field of 
martyrdom, upraised the Standard of God's Faith and writ with 
their life-blood upon the Tablet of the world the verses of His 
Divine Unity.  The sacred breast of His Holiness, the Exalted 
One (may my life be a sacrifice unto Him), was made a target 
to many a dart of woe, and in &amp;Mazindaran, the blessed feet of 
the &amp;Abha Beauty (may my life be offered up for His loved ones) 
were so grievously scourged as to bleed and be sore wounded.  
His neck also was put into captive chains and His feet made fast 
in the stocks.  In every hour, for a period of fifty years, a new 
trial and calamity befell Him and fresh afflictions and cares 
beset Him.  One of them:  after having suffered intense vicissitudes, 
He was made homeless and a wanderer and fell a victim 
to still new vexations and troubles.  In &amp;Iraq, the Day-Star of 
the world was so exposed to the wiles of the people of malice as 
to be eclipsed in splendor.  Later on He was sent an exile to 
the Great City (Constantinople) and thence to the Land of 
Mystery (Adrianople), whence, grievously wronged, He was 
eventually transferred to the Most Great Prison (&amp;Akka).  He 
Whom the world hath wronged (may my life be offered up for 
His loved ones) was four times banished from city to city, till 
at last, condemned to perpetual confinement, He was incarcerated 
in this prison, the prison of highway robbers, of brigands and of 
man-slayers.  All this is but one of the trials that have afflicted 
the Blessed Beauty, the rest being even as grievous as this.  
     And still another of His trials was the hostility, the flagrant 
injustice, the iniquity and rebellion of &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya.  Although 
that Wronged One, that Prisoner, had through His loving-kindness 
nurtured him in His own bosom ever since his early 
years, had showered at every moment His tender care upon him, 
exalted his name, shielded him from every misfortune, endeared 
him to them of this world and the next, and despite the firm 
exhortations and counsels of His Holiness, the Exalted One 
(the &amp;Bab) and His clear and conclusive warning;--"Beware, 
beware, lest the Nineteen Letters of the Living and that which 
hath been revealed in the &amp;Bayan veil thee!" yet notwithstanding 
 
+P5 
this, &amp;Mirza &amp;Yahya denied Him, dealt falsely with Him, believed 
Him not, sowed the seeds of doubt, closed his eyes to His manifest 
verses and turned aside therefrom.  Would that he had been 
content therewith!  Nay, he even attempted to shed the sacred 
blood (of &amp;Baha'u'llah) and then raised a great clamor and 
tumult around him, attributing unto &amp;Baha'u'llah malevolence 
and cruelty towards himself.  What sedition he stirred up and 
what a storm of mischief he raised whilst in the Land of Mystery 
(Adrianople)!  At last, he wrought that which caused the Day-Star 
of the world to be sent an exile to this, the Most Great 
Prison, and sorely wronged, and in the West of this Great Prison 
He did set.  
     O ye that stand fast and firm in the Covenant!  The Center 
of Sedition, the Prime Mover of mischief, &amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad 
&amp;Ali, hath passed out from under the shadow of the Cause, hath 
broken the Covenant, hath falsified the Holy Text, hath inflicted 
a grievous loss upon the true Faith of God, hath scattered 
His people, hath with bitter rancor endeavored to hurt &amp;Abdu'l-Baha 
and hath assailed with the utmost enmity this servant of 
the Sacred Threshold.  Every dart he seized and hurled to 
pierce the breast of this wronged servant, no wound did he 
neglect to grievously inflict upon me, no venom did he spare 
but he poisoned therewith the life of this hapless one.  I swear 
by the most holy &amp;Abha Beauty and by the Light shining from 
His Holiness, the Exalted One (may my soul be a sacrifice for 
Their lowly servants), that because of this iniquity the dwellers 
in the Pavilion of the &amp;Abha Kingdom have bewailed, the Celestial 
Concourse is lamenting, the Immortal Maids of Heaven in the 
All-Highest Paradise have raised their plaintive cries and the 
angelic company sighed and uttered their moanings.  So grievous 
the deeds of this iniquitous person became that he struck with 
his axe at the root of the Blessed Tree, dealt a heavy blow at 
the Temple of the Cause of God, deluged with tears of blood 
the eyes of the loved ones of the Blessed Beauty, cheered and 
encouraged the enemies of the One True God, by his repudiation 
of the Covenant turned many a seeker after Truth aside from 
the Cause of God, revived the blighted hopes of &amp;Yahya's following, 
made himself detested, caused the enemies of the Greatest 
Name to become audacious and arrogant, put aside the firm and 
conclusive verses and sowed the seeds of doubt.  Had not the 
promised aid of the Ancient Beauty been graciously vouchsafed 
 
+P6 
at every moment to this one, unworthy though he be, he surely 
would have destroyed, nay exterminated the Cause of God and 
utterly subverted the Divine Edifice.  But, praised be the Lord, 
the triumphant assistance of the &amp;Abha Kingdom was received, 
the hosts of the Realm above hastened to bestow victory.  The 
Cause of God was promoted far and wide, the call of the True 
One was noised abroad, ears in all regions were inclined to the 
Word of God, His standard was unfurled, the ensigns of Holiness 
gloriously waved aloft and the verses celebrating His Divine 
Unity were chanted.  Now, that the true Faith of God may be 
shielded and protected, His Law guarded and preserved and 
His Cause remain safe and secure, it is incumbent upon everyone 
to hold fast unto the Text of the clear and firmly established 
blessed verse, revealed about him.  None other transgression 
greater than his can be ever imagined.  He (&amp;Baha'u'llah) 
sayeth, glorious and holy is His Word:--"My foolish loved ones 
have regarded him even as my partner, have kindled sedition in 
the land and they verily are of the mischief-makers."  Consider, 
how foolish are the people!  They that have been in His 
(&amp;Baha'u'llah's) Presence and beheld His Countenance, have 
nevertheless noised abroad such idle talk, until, exalted be His 
explicit words, He said:--"Should he for a moment pass out 
from under the shadow of the Cause, he surely shall be brought 
to naught."  Reflect!  What stress He layeth upon one moment's 
deviation:  that is, were he to incline a hair's breadth to the right 
or to the left, his deviation would be clearly established and his 
utter nothingness made manifest.  And now ye are witnessing 
how the wrath of God hath from all sides afflicted him and how 
day by day he is speeding towards destruction.  Ere long will ye 
behold him and his associates, outwardly and inwardly, condemned 
to utter ruin.  
     What deviation can be greater than breaking the Covenant 
of God!  What deviation can be greater than interpolating 
and falsifying the words and verses of the Sacred Text, even 
as testified and declared by &amp;Mirza &amp;Badi'u'llah!  What deviation 
can be greater than calumniating the Center of the Covenant 
himself!  What deviation can be more glaring than spreading 
broadcast false and foolish reports touching the Temple of God's 
Testament!  What deviation can be more grievous than decreeing 
the death of the Center of the Covenant, supported by the 
holy verse:--"He that layeth a claim ere the passing of a 
 
+P7 
thousand years...," whilst he (&amp;Muhammad &amp;Ali) without 
shame in the days of the Blessed Beauty had advanced such 
a claim as this and been confuted by Him in the aforementioned 
manner, the text of his claim being still extant in his own handwriting 
and bearing his own seal.  What deviation can be more 
complete than falsely accusing the loved ones of God!  What 
deviation can be more evil than causing their imprisonment and 
incarceration!  What deviation can be more severe than delivering 
into the hands of the government the Holy Writings 
and Epistles, that haply they (the government) might arise 
intent upon the death of this wronged one!  What deviation 
can be more violent than threatening the ruin of the Cause 
of God, forging and slanderously falsifying letters and documents 
so that this might perturb and alarm the government 
and lead to the shedding of the blood of this wronged one,--
such letters and documents being now in the possession of the 
government!  What deviation can be more odious than his 
iniquity and rebellion!  What deviation can be more shameful 
than dispersing the gathering of the people of salvation!  What 
deviation can be more infamous than the vain and feeble interpretations 
of the people of doubt!  What deviation can be 
more wicked than joining hands with strangers and with the 
enemies of God!  
     A few months ago, in concert with others, he that hath 
broken the Covenant, hath prepared a document teeming with 
calumny and slander wherein, the Lord forbid, among many 
similar slanderous charges, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha is deemed a deadly 
enemy, the ill-wisher of the Crown.  They so perturbed the 
minds of the members of the Imperial Government that at 
last a Committee of Investigation was sent from the seat of His 
Majesty's Government which, violating every rule of justice 
and equity that befit His Imperial Majesty, nay, with the 
most glaring injustice, proceeded with its investigations.  The 
ill-wishers of the One True God surrounded them on every 
side and explained and excessively enlarged upon the text of 
the document whilst they (the members of the Committee) 
in their turn blindly acquiesced.  One of their many calumnies 
was that this servant had raised aloft a banner in this city, 
had summoned the people together under it, had established 
a new sovereignty for himself, had erected upon Mount Carmel 
a mighty stronghold, had rallied around him all the peoples of 
 
+P8 
the land and made them obedient to him, had caused disruption 
in the Faith of &amp;Islam, had covenanted with the following of 
Christ and, God forbid, had purposed to cause the gravest 
breach in the mighty power of the Crown.  May the Lord 
protect us from such atrocious falsehoods!  
     According to the direct and sacred command of God we 
are forbidden to utter slander, are commanded to show forth 
peace and amity, are exhorted to rectitude of conduct, straightforwardness 
and harmony with all the kindreds and peoples 
of the world.  We must obey and be the well-wishers of the 
governments of the land, regard disloyalty unto a just king 
as disloyalty to God Himself and wishing evil to the government 
a transgression of the Cause of God.  With these final and 
decisive words, how can it be that these imprisoned ones should 
indulge in such vain fancies; incarcerated, how could they show 
forth such disloyalty!  But alas!  The Committee of Investigation 
hath approved and confirmed these calumnies of my 
brother and ill-wishers and submitted them to the presence of 
His Majesty the Sovereign.  Now at this moment a fierce storm 
is raging around this prisoner who awaiteth, be it favorable or 
unfavorable, the gracious will of His Majesty, may the Lord 
aid him by His grace to be just.  In whatsoever condition he 
may be, with absolute calm and quietness, &amp;Abdu'l-Baha is ready 
for self-sacrifice and is wholly resigned and submitted to His 
Will.  What transgression can be more abominable, more odious, 
more wicked than this!  
     In like manner, the focal Center of Hate, hath purposed 
to put &amp;Abdu'l-Baha to death and this is supported by the testimony 
written by &amp;Mirza &amp;Shu'a'u'llah himself and is here 
enclosed.  It is evident and indisputable that they are privily 
and with the utmost subtlety engaged in conspiring against me.  
The following are his very words written by him in this letter:--
"I curse at every moment him that hath kindled this discord, 
imprecate in these words `Lord! have no mercy upon him' and 
I hope ere long God will make manifest the one that shall have 
no pity on him, who now weareth another garb and about 
whom I cannot any more explain."  Reference he doth make by 
these words to the sacred verse that beginneth as follows:--"He 
that layeth a claim ere the passing of a thousand years..."  
Reflect!  How intent they are upon the death of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha!  
Ponder in your hearts upon the phrase "I cannot any more 
 
+P9 
explain" and realize what schemes they are devising for this 
purpose.  They fear lest, too fully explained, the letter might 
fall into alien hands and their schemes be foiled and frustrated.  
The phrase is only foretelling good tidings to come, namely 
that regarding this all requisite arrangements have been made.  
     O God, my God!  Thou seest this wronged servant of 
Thine, held fast in the talons of ferocious lions, of ravening 
wolves, of bloodthirsty beasts.  Graciously assist me, through 
my love for Thee, that I may drink deep of the chalice that 
brimmeth over with faithfulness to Thee and is filled with Thy 
bountiful Grace; so that, fallen upon the dust, I may sink 
prostrate and senseless whilst my vesture is dyed crimson with 
my blood.  This is my wish, my heart's desire, my hope, my 
pride, my glory.  Grant, O Lord my God, and my Refuge, 
that in my last hour, my end may even as musk shed its 
fragrance of glory!  Is there a bounty greater than this?  Nay, 
by Thy Glory!  I call Thee to witness that no day passeth but 
that I quaff my fill from this cup, so grievous are the misdeeds 
wrought by them that have broken the Covenant, kindled discord, 
showed their malice, stirred sedition in the land and 
dishonored Thee amidst Thy servants.  Lord!  Shield Thou 
from these Covenant-breakers the mighty Stronghold of Thy 
Faith and protect Thy secret Sanctuary from the onslaught of 
the ungodly.  Thou art in truth the Mighty, the Powerful, the 
Gracious, the Strong.  
     In short, O ye beloved of the Lord!  The Center of Sedition, 
&amp;Mirza &amp;Muhammad &amp;Ali, in accordance with the decisive words 
of God and by reason of his boundless transgression, hath 
grievously fallen and been cut off from the Holy Tree.  Verily, 
we wronged them not, but they have wronged themselves!  
     O God, my God!  Shield Thy trusted servants from the 
evils of self and passion, protect them with the watchful eye 
of Thy loving kindness from all rancor, hate and envy, shelter 
them in the impregnable stronghold of Thy care and, safe from 
the darts of doubtfulness, make them the manifestations of Thy 
glorious Signs, illumine their faces with the effulgent rays shed 
from the Dayspring of Thy Divine Unity, gladden their hearts 
with the verses revealed from Thy Holy Kingdom, strengthen 
their loins by Thy all-swaying power that cometh from Thy 
Realm of Glory.  Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Protector, the 
Almighty, the Gracious!  
 
+P10 
     O ye that stand fast in the Covenant!  When the hour 
cometh that this wronged and broken-winged bird will have 
taken its flight into the Celestial Concourse, when it will have 
hastened to the Realm of the Unseen and its mortal frame will 
have been either lost or hidden neath the dust, it is incumbent 
upon the &amp;Afnan, that are steadfast in the Covenant of God and 
have branched from the Tree of Holiness; the Hands, (pillars) 
of the Cause of God (the glory of the Lord rest upon them), 
and all the friends and loved ones, one and all to bestir themselves 
and arise with heart and soul and in one accord, to diffuse the 
sweet savors of God, to teach His Cause and to promote His 
Faith.  It behooveth them not to rest for a moment, neither to 
seek repose.  They must disperse themselves in every land, pass 
by every clime, and travel throughout all regions.  Bestirred, 
without rest, and steadfast to the end, they must raise in every 
land the triumphal cry "&amp;Ya &amp;Baha'u'l-Abha!" (O Thou the Glory 
of Glories), must achieve renown in the world wherever 
they go, must burn brightly even as a candle in every meeting 
and must kindle the flame of Divine love in every assembly; 
that the light of truth may rise resplendent in the midmost 
heart of the world, that throughout the East and throughout 
the West a vast concourse may gather under the shadow of the 
Word of God, that the sweet savors of holiness may be diffused, 
that faces may shine radiantly, hearts be filled with the Divine 
spirit and souls be made heavenly.  
     In these days, the most important of all things is the 
guidance of the nations and peoples of the world.  Teaching 
the Cause is of utmost importance for it is the head corner-stone 
of the foundation itself.  This wronged servant has spent his 
days and nights in promoting the Cause and urging the peoples 
to service.  He rested not a moment, till the fame of the Cause 
of God was noised abroad in the world and the celestial strains 
from the &amp;Abha Kingdom roused the East and the West.  The 
beloved of God must also follow the same example.  This is the 
secret of faithfulness, this is the requirement of servitude to 
the Threshold of &amp;Baha!  
     The disciples of Christ forgot themselves and all earthly 
things, forsook all their cares and belongings, purged themselves 
of self and passion, and with absolute detachment scattered 
far and wide and engaged in calling the peoples of the 
world to the divine guidance; till at last they made the world 
 
+P11 
another world, illumined the surface of the earth, and even 
to their last hour proved self-sacrificing in the pathway of that 
beloved One of God.  Finally in various lands they suffered 
glorious martyrdom.  Let them that are men of action follow 
in their footsteps!  
     O my loving friends!  After the passing away of this 
wronged one, it is incumbent upon the &amp;Aghsan (Branches), the 
&amp;Afnan (Twigs) of the Sacred Lote-Tree, the Hands (pillars) of 
the Cause of God and the loved ones of the &amp;Abha Beauty to 
turn unto Shoghi Effendi--the youthful branch branched from 
the two hallowed and sacred Lote-Trees and the fruit grown 
from the union of the two offshoots of the Tree of Holiness,--
as he is the sign of God, the chosen branch, the Guardian of the 
Cause of God, he unto whom all the &amp;Aghsan, the &amp;Afnan, the 
Hands of the Cause of God and His loved ones must turn.  He 
is the Interpreter of the Word of God and after him will succeed 
the first-born of his lineal descendents.  
     The sacred and youthful branch, the Guardian of the 
Cause of God, as well as the Universal House of Justice to be 
universally elected and established, are both under the care 
and protection of the &amp;Abha Beauty, under the shelter and unerring 
guidance of the Exalted One (may my life 
be offered up for them both).  Whatsoever they decide is of 
God.  Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not 
obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them 
hath rebelled against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed 
God; whoso contendeth with them hath contended with God; 
whoso disputeth with him hath disputed with God; whoso 
denieth him hath denied God; whoso disbelieveth in him hath 
disbelieved in God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and 
turneth aside from him hath in truth deviated, separated himself 
and turned aside from God.  May the wrath, the fierce indignation, 
the vengeance of God rest upon him!  The mighty stronghold 
shall remain impregnable and safe through obedience to 
him who is the Guardian of the Cause of God.  It is incumbent 
upon the members of the House of Justice, upon all the &amp;Aghsan, 
the &amp;Afnan, the Hands of the Cause of God to show their obedience, 
submissiveness and subordination unto the Guardian of the 
Cause of God, to turn unto him and be lowly before him.  He 
that opposeth him hath opposed the True One, will make a 
breach in the Cause of God, will subvert His Word and will 
 
+P12 
become a manifestation of the Center of Sedition.  Beware, 
beware, lest the days after the ascension (of &amp;Baha'u'llah) be 
repeated when the Center of Sedition waxed haughty and 
rebellious and with Divine Unity for his excuse deprived himself 
and perturbed and poisoned others.  No doubt every vainglorious 
one that purposeth dissension and discord will not 
openly declare his evil purposes, nay rather, even as impure 
gold, will he seize upon divers measures and various pretexts 
that he may separate the gathering of the people of &amp;Baha.  My 
object is to show that the Hands of the Cause of God must be 
ever watchful and so soon as they find anyone beginning to 
oppose and protest against the Guardian of the Cause of God, 
cast him out from the congregation of the people of &amp;Baha and 
in no wise accept any excuse from him.  How often hath grievous 
error been disguised in the garb of truth, that it might sow the 
seeds of doubt in the hearts of men!  
     O ye beloved of the Lord!  It is incumbent upon the 
Guardian of the Cause of God to appoint in his own life-time 
him that shall become his successor, that differences may not 
arise after his passing.  He that is appointed must manifest in 
himself detachment from all worldly things, must be the essence 
of purity, must show in himself the fear of God, knowledge, 
wisdom and learning.  Thus, should the first-born of the 
Guardian of the Cause of God not manifest in himself the truth 
of the words:--"The child is the secret essence of its sire," 
that is, should he not inherit of the spiritual within him (the 
Guardian of the Cause of God) and his glorious lineage not be 
matched with a goodly character, then must he, (the Guardian 
of the Cause of God) choose another branch to succeed him.  
     The Hands of the Cause of God must elect from their own 
number nine persons that shall at all times be occupied in the 
important services in the work of the Guardian of the Cause of 
God.  The election of these nine must be carried either unanimously 
or by majority from the company of the Hands of the 
Cause of God and these, whether unanimously or by a majority 
vote, must give their assent to the choice of the one whom the 
Guardian of the Cause of God hath chosen as his successor.  
This assent must be given in such wise as the assenting and dissenting 
voices may not be distinguished (i.e., secret ballot).  
     O friends!  The Hands of the Cause of God must be 
nominated and appointed by the Guardian of the Cause of God.  
 
+P13 
All must be under his shadow and obey his command.  Should 
any, within or without the company of the Hands of the Cause 
of God disobey and seek division, the wrath of God and His 
vengeance will be upon him, for he will have caused a breach 
in the true Faith of God.  
     The obligations of the Hands of the Cause of God are to 
diffuse the Divine Fragrances, to edify the souls of men, to 
promote learning, to improve the character of all men and to 
be, at all times and under all conditions, sanctified and detached 
from earthly things.  They must manifest the fear of God by 
their conduct, their manners, their deeds and their words.  
     This body of the Hands of the Cause of God is under the 
direction of the Guardian of the Cause of God.  He must continually 
urge them to strive and endeavor to the utmost of their 
ability to diffuse the sweet savors of God, and to guide all the 
peoples of the world, for it is the light of Divine Guidance that 
causeth all the universe to be illumined.  To disregard, though 
it be for a moment, this absolute command which is binding 
upon everyone, is in no wise permitted, that the existent world 
may become even as the &amp;Abha Paradise, that the surface of the 
earth may become heavenly, that contention and conflict amidst 
peoples, kindreds, nations and governments may disappear, that 
all the dwellers on earth may become one people and one race, 
that the world may become even as one home.  Should differences 
arise, they shall be amicably and conclusively settled by 
the Supreme Tribunal, that shall include members from all the 
governments and peoples of the world.  
     O ye beloved of the Lord!  In this sacred Dispensation, 
conflict and contention are in no wise permitted.  Every aggressor 
deprives himself of God's grace.  It is incumbent upon 
everyone to show the utmost love, rectitude of conduct, straightforwardness 
and sincere kindliness unto all the peoples and 
kindreds of the world, be they friends or strangers.  So intense 
must be the spirit of love and loving kindness, that the stranger 
may find himself a friend, the enemy a true brother, no difference 
whatsoever existing between them.  For universality is of 
God and all limitations earthly.  Thus man must strive that 
his reality may manifest virtues and perfections, the light 
whereof may shine upon everyone.  The light of the sun 
shineth upon all the world and the merciful showers of Divine 
Providence fall upon all peoples.  The vivifying breeze reviveth 
 
+P14 
every living creature and all beings endued with life obtain 
their share and portion at His heavenly board.  In like manner, 
the affections and loving kindness of the servants of the One 
True God must be bountifully and universally extended to all 
mankind.  Regarding this, restrictions and limitations are in no 
wise permitted.  
     Wherefore, O my loving friends!  Consort with all the 
peoples, kindreds and religions of the world with the utmost 
truthfulness, uprightness, faithfulness, kindliness, good-will and 
friendliness, that all the world of being may be filled with the 
holy ecstasy of the grace of &amp;Baha, that ignorance, enmity, hate 
and rancor may vanish from the world and the darkness of 
estrangement amidst the peoples and kindreds of the world may 
give way to the Light of Unity.  Should other peoples and 
nations be unfaithful to you show your fidelity unto them, 
should they be unjust toward you show justice towards them, 
should they keep aloof from you attract them to yourselves, 
should they show their enmity be friendly towards them, should 
they poison your lives, sweeten their souls, should they inflict a 
wound upon you, be a salve to their sores.  Such are the attributes 
of the sincere!  Such are the attributes of the truthful.  
     And now, concerning the House of Justice which God hath 
ordained as the source of all good and freed from all error, it 
must be elected by universal suffrage, that is, by the believers.  
Its members must be manifestations of the fear of God and daysprings 
of knowledge and understanding, must be steadfast in 
God's faith and the well-wishers of all mankind.  By this House 
is meant the Universal House of Justice, that is, in all countries 
a secondary House of Justice must be instituted, and these 
secondary Houses of Justice must elect the members of the 
Universal one.  Unto this body all things must be referred.  
It enacteth all ordinances and regulations that are not to be 
found in the explicit Holy Text.  By this body all the difficult 
problems are to be resolved and the Guardian of the Cause of 
God is its sacred head and the distinguished member for life of 
that body.  Should he not attend in person its deliberations, he 
must appoint one to represent him.  Should any of the members 
commit a sin, injurious to the common weal, the Guardian of the 
Cause of God hath at his own discretion the right to expel him, 
whereupon the people must elect another one in his stead.  This 
House of Justice enacteth the laws and the government enforceth 
 
+P15 
them.  The legislative body must reinforce the executive, the 
executive must aid and assist the legislative body so that through 
the close union and harmony of these two forces, the foundation 
of fairness and justice may become firm and strong, that all the 
regions of the world may become even as Paradise itself.  
     O Lord, my God!  Assist Thy loved ones to be firm in Thy 
Faith, to walk in Thy ways, to be steadfast in Thy Cause.  Give 
them Thy grace to withstand the onslaught of self and passion, 
to follow the light of Divine Guidance.  Thou art the Powerful, 
the Gracious, the Self-Subsisting, the Bestower, the Compassionate, 
the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.  
     O friends of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha!  The Lord, as a sign of His 
infinite bounties, hath graciously favored His servants by providing 
for a fixed money offering (&amp;Huquq), to be dutifully 
presented unto Him, though He, the True One and His servants 
have been at all times independent of all created things, and God 
verily is the All-Possessing, exalted above the need of any 
gift from His creatures.  This fixed money offering, however, 
causeth the people to become firm and steadfast and draweth 
Divine increase upon them.  It is to be offered through the 
Guardian of the Cause of God, that it may be expended for the 
diffusion of the Fragrances of God and the exaltation of His 
Word, for benevolent pursuits and for the common weal.  
     O ye beloved of the Lord!  It is incumbent upon you to be 
submissive to all monarchs that are just and to show your fidelity 
to every righteous king.  Serve ye the sovereigns of the world 
with utmost truthfulness and loyalty.  Show obedience unto 
them and be their well-wishers.  Without their leave and permission 
do not meddle with political affairs, for disloyalty to 
the just sovereign is disloyalty to God Himself.  
     This is my counsel and the commandment of God unto you.  
Well is it with them that act accordingly.

                         [PART TWO] 
 
He Is God 
 
     O MY LORD, my heart's Desire, Thou Whom I ever invoke, 
Thou Who art my Aider and my Shelter, my Helper and 
my Refuge!  Thou seest me submerged in an ocean of calamities 
that overwhelm the soul, of afflictions that oppress the heart, of 
woes that disperse Thy gathering, of ills and pains that scatter 
Thy flock.  Sore trials have compassed me round and perils have 
from all sides beset me.  Thou seest me immersed in a sea of 
unsurpassed tribulation, sunk into a fathomless abyss, afflicted 
by mine enemies and consumed with the flame of their hate, enkindled 
by my kinsmen with whom Thou didst make Thy strong 
Covenant and Thy firm Testament, wherein Thou biddest them 
turn their hearts to this wronged one, to keep away from me the 
foolish, the unjust, and refer unto this lonely one all that about 
which they differ in Thy Holy Book, so that the Truth may be 
revealed unto them, their doubts may be dispelled and Thy 
manifest Signs be spread abroad.  
     Yet now Thou seest them, O Lord, my God! with Thine eye 
that sleepeth not, how that they have broken Thy Covenant and 
turned their backs thereon, how with hate and rebelliousness 
they have erred from Thy Testament and have arisen intent 
upon malice.  
     Adversities have waxed still more severe as they rose with 
unbearable cruelty to overpower and crush me, as they scattered 
far and wide their scrolls of doubt and in utter falsehood hurled 
their calumnies upon me.  Not content with this, their chief, 
O my God, hath dared to interpolate Thy Book, to fraudulently 
alter Thy decisive Holy Text and falsify that which hath been 
revealed by Thy All-Glorious Pen.  He did also maliciously 
insert that which Thou didst reveal for the one that hath 
wrought the most glaring cruelty upon Thee, disbelieved in 
Thee and denied Thy wondrous Signs, into what Thou didst 
reveal for this servant of Thine that hath been wronged in this 
world.  All this he did that he might beguile the souls of men 
and breathe his evil whisperings into the hearts of Thy devoted 
 
+P18 
ones.  Thereunto did their second chief testify, confessing it in 
his own handwriting, setting thereupon his seal and spreading 
it throughout all regions.  O my God!  Could there be a more 
grievous injustice than this?  And still they rested not, but 
further strove with stubbornness, falsehood and slander, with 
scorn and calumny to stir up sedition in the midst of the government 
of this land and elsewhere, causing them to deem me a 
sower of sedition and filling the minds with things that the ear 
abhorreth to hear.  The government was thus alarmed, fear fell 
upon the sovereign, and the suspicion of the nobility was 
aroused.  Minds were troubled, affairs were upset, souls were 
perturbed, the fire of anguish and sorrow was kindled within the 
breasts, the Holy Leaves (of the Household) were convulsed 
and shaken, their eyes rained with tears, their sighs and lamentations 
were raised and their hearts burned within them as they 
bewailed this wronged servant of Thine, fallen a victim into 
the hands of these, his kindred, nay, his very enemies!  
     Lord!  Thou seest all things weeping over Me and My kindred 
rejoicing in My woes.  By Thy Glory, O my God!  Even amongst 
mine enemies, some have lamented my troubles and my distress, 
and of the envious ones a number have shed tears because of 
my cares, my exile and my afflictions.  They did this because 
they found naught in me but affection and care and witnessed 
naught but kindliness and mercy.  As they saw me swept into 
the flood of tribulation and adversity and exposed even as a 
target to the arrows of fate, their hearts were moved with 
compassion, tears came to their eyes and they testified declaring:
--"The Lord is our witness; naught have we seen from 
him but faithfulness, generosity and extreme compassion."  The 
Covenant-breakers, foreboders of evil, however, waxed fiercer in 
their rancor, rejoiced as I fell a victim to the most grievous 
ordeal, bestirred themselves against me and made merry over 
the heartrending happenings around me.  
     I call upon Thee, O Lord my God! with my tongue and 
with all my heart, not to requite them for their cruelty and their 
wrong-doings, their craft and their mischief, for they are foolish 
and ignoble and know not what they do.  They discern not 
good from evil, neither do they distinguish right from wrong, 
nor justice from injustice.  They follow their own desires and 
walk in the footsteps of the most imperfect and foolish amongst 
them.  O my Lord!  Have mercy upon them, shield them from 
 
+P19 
all afflictions in these troubled times and grant that all trials 
and hardships may be the lot of this Thy servant that hath fallen 
into this darksome pit.  Single me out for every woe and make 
me a sacrifice for all Thy loved ones.  O Lord, Most High!  
May my soul, my life, my being, my spirit, my all be offered 
up for them.  O God, my God!  Lowly, suppliant and fallen 
upon my face, I beseech Thee with all the ardor of my invocation 
to pardon whosoever hath hurt me, forgive him that 
hath conspired against me and offended me, and wash away the 
misdeeds of them that have wrought injustice upon me.  Vouchsafe 
unto them Thy goodly gifts, give them joy, relieve them 
from sorrow, grant them peace and prosperity, give them Thy 
bliss and pour upon them Thy bounty.  
     Thou art the Powerful, the Gracious, the Help in Peril, 
the Self-Subsisting!  
     O dearly beloved friends!  I am now in very great danger 
and the hope of even an hour's life is lost to me.  I am thus 
constrained to write these lines for the protection of the Cause of 
God, the preservation of His Law, the safeguarding of His 
Word and the safety of His Teachings.  By the Ancient Beauty!  
This wronged one hath in no wise borne nor doth he bear a 
grudge against any one; towards none doth he entertain any 
ill-feeling and uttereth no word save for the good of the world.  
My supreme obligation, however, of necessity, prompteth me 
to guard and preserve the Cause of God.  Thus, with the 
greatest regret, I counsel you saying:  Guard ye the Cause of 
God, protect His law and have the utmost fear of discord.  
This is the foundation of the belief of the people of &amp;Baha 
(may my life be offered up for them):  "His Holiness, the 
Exalted One (the &amp;Bab), is the Manifestation of the Unity and 
Oneness of God and the Forerunner of the Ancient Beauty.  His 
Holiness the &amp;Abha Beauty (may my life be a sacrifice for His 
steadfast friends) is the Supreme Manifestation of God and 
the Dayspring of His Most Divine Essence.  All others are 
servants unto Him and do His bidding."  Unto the Most Holy 
Book every one must turn, and all that is not expressly recorded 
therein must be referred to the Universal House of Justice.  
That which this body, whether unanimously or by a majority 
doth carry, that is verily the truth and the purpose of God 
Himself.  Whoso doth deviate therefrom is verily of them that 
love discord, hath shown forth malice, and turned away from 
 
+P20 
the Lord of the Covenant.  By this House is meant that Universal 
House of Justice which is to be elected from all countries, 
that is from those parts in the East and West where the loved 
ones are to be found, after the manner of the customary elections 
in Western countries such as those of England.  
     It is incumbent upon these members (of the Universal 
House of Justice) to gather in a certain place and deliberate 
upon all problems which have caused difference, questions that 
are obscure and matters that are not expressly recorded in the 
Book.  Whatsoever they decide has the same effect as the Text 
itself.  Inasmuch as the House of Justice hath power to 
enact laws that are not expressly recorded in the Book and bear 
upon daily transactions, so also it hath power to repeal the 
same.  Thus for example, the House of Justice enacteth today a 
certain law and enforceth it, and a hundred years hence, circumstances 
having profoundly changed and the conditions having 
altered, another House of Justice will then have power, according 
to the exigencies of the time, to alter that law.  This it can 
do because these laws form no part of the divine explicit Text.  
The House of Justice is both the initiator and the abrogator of 
its own laws.  
     And now, one of the greatest and most fundamental principles 
of the Cause of God is to shun and avoid entirely the 
Covenant-breakers, for they will utterly destroy the Cause of 
God, exterminate His Law and render of no account all efforts 
exerted in the past.  O friends!  It behooveth you to call to mind 
with tenderness the trials of His Holiness, the Exalted One, 
and show your fidelity to the Ever-Blest Beauty.  The utmost 
endeavor must be exerted lest all these woes, trials and afflictions, 
all this pure and sacred blood that hath been shed so 
profusely in the Path of God, may prove to be in vain.  Ye 
know well what the hands of the Center of Sedition, &amp;Mirza 
&amp;Muhammad &amp;Ali, and his associates have wrought.  Among 
his doings, one of them is the corruption of the Sacred Text 
whereof ye are all aware, the Lord be praised, and know that 
it is evident, proven and confirmed by the testimony of his 
brother, &amp;Mirza &amp;Badi'u'llah, whose confession is written in his 
own handwriting, beareth his seal, is printed and spread abroad.  
This is but one of his misdeeds.  Can a transgression be imagined 
more glaring than this, the interpolation of the Holy Text?  
Nay, by the righteousness of the Lord!  His transgressions are 
 
+P21 
writ and recorded in a leaflet by itself.  Please God, ye will 
peruse it.  
     In short, according to the explicit Divine Text the least 
transgression shall make of this man a fallen creature, and 
what transgression is more grievous than attempting to destroy 
the Divine Edifice, breaking the Covenant, erring from the 
Testament, falsifying the Holy Text, sowing the seeds of doubt, 
calumniating &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, advancing claims for which God 
hath sent down no warrant, kindling mischief and striving to 
shed the very blood of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, and many other things 
whereof ye are all aware!  It is thus evident that should this 
man succeed in bringing disruption into the Cause of God, he 
will utterly destroy and exterminate it.  Beware lest ye approach 
this man, for to approach him is worse than approaching fire!  
     Gracious God!  After &amp;Mirza &amp;Badi'u'llah had declared in 
his own handwriting that this man (&amp;Muhammad &amp;Ali) had 
broken the Covenant and had proclaimed his falsification of the 
Holy Text, he realized that to return to the True Faith and pay 
allegiance to the Covenant and Testament would in no wise 
promote his selfish desires.  He thus repented and regretted 
the thing he had done and attempted privily to gather in his 
printed confessions, plotted darkly with the Center of Sedition 
against me and informed him daily of all the happenings within 
my household.  He has even taken a leading part in the 
mischievous deeds that have of late been committed.  Praise 
be to God affairs recovered their former stability and the loved 
ones obtained partial peace.  But ever since the day he entered 
again into our midst, he began afresh to sow the seeds of sore 
sedition.  Some of his machinations and intrigues will be recorded 
in a separate leaflet.  
     My purpose is, however, to show that it is incumbent upon 
the friends that are fast and firm in the Covenant and Testament 
to be ever wakeful lest after this wronged one is gone this 
alert and active worker of mischief may cause disruption, privily 
sow the seeds of doubt and sedition and utterly root out the 
Cause of God.  A thousand times shun his company.  Take 
heed and be on your guard.  Watch and examine; should anyone, 
openly or privily, have the least connection with him, cast him 
out from your midst, for he will surely cause disruption and 
mischief.  
 
+P22 
     O ye beloved of the Lord!  Strive with all your heart to 
shield the Cause of God from the onslaught of the insincere, 
for souls such as these cause the straight to become crooked and 
all benevolent efforts to produce contrary results.  
     O God, my God!  I call Thee, Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers, 
Thy Saints and Thy Holy Ones, to witness that I have 
declared conclusively Thy Proofs unto Thy loved ones and 
set forth clearly all things unto them, that they may watch over 
Thy Faith, guard Thy Straight Path and protect Thy Resplendent 
Law.  Thou art, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!  
 
 
+P23 
                            [PART THREE] 
 
He Is the Witness, the All-Sufficing 
 
     O MY GOD! my Beloved, my heart's Desire!  Thou knowest, 
Thou seest that which hath befallen this servant of Thine, 
that hath humbled himself at Thy Door, and Thou knowest the 
sins committed against him by the people of malice, they that 
have broken Thy Covenant and turned their backs on Thy Testament.  
In the day-time they afflicted me with the arrows of hate 
and in the night-season they privily conspired to hurt me.  At dawn 
they committed that which the Celestial Concourse did lament 
and at eventide they unsheathed against me the sword of 
tyranny and hurled in the presence of the ungodly their darts 
of calumny upon me.  Notwithstanding their misdeeds, this 
lowly servant of Thine was patient and did endure every 
affliction and trial at their hands, though by Thy power and 
might he could have destroyed their words, quenched their fire 
and stayed the flame of their rebelliousness.  
     Thou seest, O my God! how my long-suffering, my forbearance 
and silence have increased their cruelty, their arrogance 
and their pride.  By Thy Glory, O Beloved One!  They have 
misbelieved in Thee and rebelled against Thee in such wise that 
they left me not a moment of rest and quiet, that I might arise 
as it is meet and seemly, to exalt Thy Word amidst mankind, 
and might serve at Thy Threshold of Holiness with a heart that 
overfloweth with the joy of the dwellers of the &amp;Abha Kingdom.  
     Lord!  My cup of woe runneth over, and from all sides 
blows are fiercely raging upon me.  The darts of affliction have 
compassed me round and the arrows of distress have rained 
upon me.  Thus tribulation overwhelmed me and my strength, 
because of the onslaught of the foemen, became weakness within 
me, while I stood alone and forsaken in the midst of my woes.  
Lord!  Have mercy upon me, lift me up unto Thyself and make 
me to drink from the Chalice of Martyrdom, for the wide world 
with all its vastness can no longer contain me.  
     Thou art, verily, the Merciful, the Compassionate, the 
Gracious, the All-Bountiful!  
 
+P24 
     O ye the true, the sincere, the faithful friends of this 
wronged one!  Everyone knoweth and believeth what calamities 
and afflictions have befallen this wronged one, this prisoner, at 
the hands of those who have broken the Covenant at the time 
when, after the setting of the Day-Star of the world, his heart 
was consumed with the flame of His bereavement.  
     When, in all parts of the earth, the enemies of God profiting 
by the passing away of the Sun of Truth, suddenly and with 
all their might launched their attack; at such a time and in the 
midst of so great a calamity, the Covenant-breakers arose with 
the utmost cruelty, intent upon harm and the stirring up of the 
spirit of enmity.  At every moment a misdeed they did commit 
and bestirred themselves to sow the seeds of grievous sedition, 
and to ruin the edifice of the Covenant.  But this wronged one, 
this prisoner, did his utmost to hide and veil their doings, that 
haply they might regret and repent.  His long-suffering and 
forbearance of these evil deeds, however, made the rebellious 
ones still more arrogant and daring; until, through leaflets 
written with their own hands, they sowed the seeds of doubt, 
printing these leaflets and scattering them broadcast throughout 
the world, believing that such foolish doings would bring to 
naught the Covenant and the Testament.  
     Thereupon the loved ones of the Lord arose, inspired with 
the greatest confidence and constancy and aided by the power 
of the Kingdom, by Divine Strength, by heavenly Grace, by the 
unfailing help and Celestial Bounty, they withstood the enemies 
of the Covenant in well-nigh three score and ten treatises and 
supported by conclusive proofs, unmistakable evidences and clear 
texts from the Holy Writ, they refuted their scrolls of doubt 
and mischief-kindling leaflets.  The Center of Sedition was thus 
confounded in his craftiness, afflicted by the wrath of God, sunk 
into a degradation and infamy that shall be lasting until the 
Day of Doom.  Base and wretched is the plight of the people 
of evil deeds, they that are in grievous loss!  
     And as they lost their cause, grew hopeless in their efforts 
against the loved ones of God, saw the Standard of His Testament 
waving throughout all regions and witnessed the power 
of the Covenant of the Merciful One, the flame of envy so 
blazed within them as to be beyond recounting.  With the utmost 
vigor, exertion, rancor and enmity, they followed another 
path, walked in another way, devised another plan:  that of 
 
+P25 
kindling the flame of sedition in the heart of the very government 
itself, and thus cause this wronged one, this prisoner to 
appear as a mover of strife, inimical to the government and a 
hater and opponent of the Crown.  Perchance &amp;Abdu'l-Baha may 
be put to death and his name be made to perish whereby an 
arena may be opened unto the enemies of the Covenant wherein 
they may advance and spur on their charger, inflict a grievous 
loss upon everyone and subvert the very foundations of the 
edifice of the Cause of God.  For so grievous is the conduct 
and behavior of this false people that they are become even 
as an axe striking at the very root of the Blessed Tree.  Should 
they be suffered to continue they would, in but a few days' time, 
exterminate the Cause of God, His Word, and themselves.  
     Hence, the beloved of the Lord must entirely shun them, 
avoid them, foil their machinations and evil whisperings, guard 
the Law of God and His religion, engage one and all in diffusing 
widely the sweet savors of God and to the best of their 
endeavor proclaim His Teachings.  
     Whosoever and whatsoever meeting becometh a hindrance 
to the diffusion of the Light of Faith, let the loved ones give 
them counsel and say:  "Of all the gifts of God the greatest is 
the gift of Teaching.  It draweth unto us the Grace of God and 
is our first obligation.  Of such a gift how can we deprive ourselves?  
Nay, our lives, our goods, our comforts, our rest, we 
offer them all as a sacrifice for the &amp;Abha Beauty and teach the 
Cause of God."  Caution and prudence, however, must be observed 
even as recorded in the Book.  The veil must in no wise 
be suddenly rent asunder.  The Glory of Glories rest upon you.  
     O ye the faithful loved ones of &amp;Abdu'l-Baha!  It is incumbent 
upon you to take the greatest care of Shoghi Effendi, the 
twig that hath branched from and the fruit given forth by the 
two hallowed and Divine Lote-Trees, that no dust of despondency 
and sorrow may stain his radiant nature, that day by day 
he may wax greater in happiness, in joy and spirituality, and 
may grow to become even as a fruitful tree.  
     For he is, after &amp;Abdu'l-Baha, the Guardian of the Cause 
of God, the &amp;Afnan, the Hands (pillars) of the Cause and the 
beloved of the Lord must obey him and turn unto him.  He 
that obeyeth him not, hath not obeyed God; he that turneth 
away from him, hath turned away from God and he that denieth 
him, hath denied the True One.  Beware lest anyone falsely interpret 
 
+P26 
these words, and like unto them that have broken the 
Covenant after the Day of Ascension (of &amp;Baha'u'llah) advance 
a pretext, raise the standard of revolt, wax stubborn and open 
wide the door of false interpretation.  To none is given the right 
to put forth his own opinion or express his particular conviction.  
All must seek guidance and turn unto the Center of the Cause 
and the House of Justice.  And he that turneth unto whatsoever 
else is indeed in grievous error.  
     The Glory of Glories rest upon you!
