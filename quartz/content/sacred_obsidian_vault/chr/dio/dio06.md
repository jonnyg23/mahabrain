 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iii-p1"></a>What is the power of prayer, and concerning the blessed Hierotheus,  and concerning reverence and covenant in the Word of God.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iii-p2"></a>SECTION I.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iii-p3"></a>FIRST, with your permission, let us examine the all-perfect Name of Goodness,  which is indicative of the whole progressions of Almighty God, having invoked the  supremely good, and super-good Triad--the Name which indicates Its whole best Providences.  For, we must first be raised up to It, as Source of good, by our prayers; and by  a nearer approach to It, be initiated as to the all good gifts which are established  around It. For It is indeed present to all, but all are not present to It. But then,  when we have invoked It, by all pure prayers and unpolluted mind, and by our aptitude  towards Divine Union, we also are present to It. For, It is not in a place, so that  It should be absent from a particular place, or should pass from one to another.  But even the statement that It is in all existing beings, falls short of Its infinitude  (which is) above all, and embracing all. Let us then elevate our very selves by  our prayers to the higher ascent of the Divine and good rays,--as if a luminous chain  being suspended from the celestial heights,  <a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iii-Page_28"></a> and reaching down hither, we, by ever clutching this upwards, first  with one hand, and then with the other, seem indeed to draw it down, but in reality  we do not draw it down, it being both above and below, but ourselves are carried  upwards to the higher splendours of the luminous rays. Or, as if, after we have  embarked on a ship, and are holding on to the cables reaching from some rock, such  as are given out, as it were, for us to seize, we do not draw the rock to us, but  ourselves, in fact, and the ship, to the rock. Or to take another example, if any  one standing on the ship pushes away the rock by the sea shore, he will do nothing  to the stationary and unmoved rock, but he separates himself from it, and in proportion  as he pushes that away, he is so far hurled from it. Wherefore, before everything,  and especially theology, we must begin with prayer, not as though we ourselves were  drawing the power, which is everywhere and nowhere present, but as, by our godly  reminiscences and invocations, conducting ourselves to, and making ourselves one  with, it.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iii-p4"></a>SECTION II.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iii-p5"></a>Perhaps also, this is worthy of apology, that whilst our illustrious leader,  Hierotheus, is compiling his <i>Theological Elements, </i>in a manner above natural  capacity, we, as if those were not sufficient, have composed others, and this present  theological treatise. And yet, if that man had deigned to treat systematically all  the theological treatises, and had gone  <a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iii-Page_29"></a> through the sum of all theology, by detailed expositions, we should  not have gone to such a height of folly, or stupidity, as to have attempted alone  theological questions, either more lucidly or divinely than he, or to indulge in  vain talk by saying superfluously the same things twice over, and in addition to  do injustice to one, both teacher and friend, and that we, who have been instructed  from his discourses, after Paul the Divine, should filch for our own glorification  his most illustrious contemplation and elucidation. But, since in fact, he, whilst  teaching things divine, in a manner suitable to presbyters, set forth comprehensive  definitions, and such as embraced many things in one, as were suitable to us, and  to as many as with us were teachers of the newly-initiated souls, commanding us  to unfold and disentangle, by language commensurate with our ability, the comprehensive  and uniform compositions of the most intellectual capacity of that illustrious man;  and you, yourself, have oftentimes urged us to this, and sent back the very book,  as being of transcendent value; for this reason, then, we too distinguish him as  a teacher of perfect and presbyterial conceptions for those who are above the common  people, even as certain second Oracles, and next to the Anointed of God. But for  people, such as we are, we will transmit things Divine, according to our capacity.  For, if strong meat belongs to the perfect, how great perfection is required that  the same should feed others. Correctly, then, we have affirmed this, that  <a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iii-Page_30"></a> the self-perceptive vision of the intelligible Oracles, and their  comprehensive teaching, needs presbyterial power; but the science and the thorough  teaching of the reasons which lead to this, fittingly belong to those purified and  hallowed persons placed in a subordinate position. And yet, we have insisted upon  this with the utmost care, that, as regards the things that have been thoroughly  investigated by him, our divine leader, with an accurate elucidation, we should  not, in any way, handle the same tautologically, for the same elucidation of the  Divine text expounded by him. For, amongst our inspired hierarchs (when both we,  as you know, and yourself, and many of our holy brethren, were gathered together  to the depositing of the Life-springing and God-receptive body, and when there were  present also James, the brother of God, and Peter, the foremost and most honoured  pinnacle of the Theologians, when it was determined after the depositing, that every  one of the hierarchs should celebrate, as each was capable, the Omnipotent Goodness  of the supremely Divine Weakness), he, after the Theologians, surpassed, as you  know, all the other divine instructors, being wholly entranced, wholly raised from  himself, and experiencing the pain of his fellowship with the things celebrated,  and was regarded as an inspired and divine Psalmist by all, by whom he was heard  and seen and known, and not known. And why should I say anything to thee concerning  the things there divinely spoken? For,  <a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iii-Page_31"></a> if I do not forget myself, many a time do I remember to have heard  from thee certain portions of those inspired songs of praise; such was thy zeal,  not cursorily, to pursue things Divine.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iii-p6"></a>SECTION III.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iii-p7"></a>But to pass over the mystical things there, both as forbidden to the multitude  and as known to thee, when it was necessary to communicate to the multitude, and  to bring as many as possible to the sacred knowledge amongst ourselves, he so excelled  the majority of sacred teachers, both by use of time and purity of mind, and accuracy  of demonstrations, and by his other sacred discourses, that we should scarcely have  dared to look so great a sun straight in the face. For we are thus far conscious  in ourselves, and know, that we may neither advance to understand sufficiently the  intelligible of Divine things, nor to express and declare the things spoken of the  divine knowledge. For, being far removed from the skill of those divine men, as  regards theological truth, we are so inferior that we should have, through excessive  reverence, entirely come to this--neither to hear nor to speak anything respecting  divine philosophy, unless we had grasped in our mind, that we must not neglect the  knowledge of things divine received by us. And to this we were persuaded, not only  by the innate aspirations of the minds which always lovingly cling to the permitted  contemplation of the supernatural, but also by the most excellent order itself of  the Divine institutions,  <a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iii-Page_32"></a> which prohibits us, on the one hand, from much inquisition into things  above us, as above our degree, and as unattainable; yet, on the other hand, persistently  urges us to graciously impart to others also whatever is permitted and given to  us to learn. Yielding then to these considerations, and neither shirking nor flinching  from the attainable discovery of things Divine, but also not bearing to leave unassisted  those who are unable to contemplate things too high for us, we have brought ourselves  to composition, not daring indeed to introduce anything new, but by more easy and  more detailed expositions to disentangle and elucidate the things spoken by the  Hierotheus indeed.</p>
