 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Works of Dionysius the Areopagite, tr. by John Parker, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv"></a> <h3 align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p0.1"></a>CAPUT IV.</h3> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p1"></a>Concerning Good, Light, Beauty, Love, Ecstasy, Jealousy, and  that the Evil is neither existent, nor from existent, nor in things being.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p2"></a>SECTION I.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p3"></a>BE it so then. Let us come to the appellation "Good," already mentioned in our  discourse, which the Theologians ascribe pre-eminently and exclusively to the super-Divine  Deity, as I conjecture, by calling the supremely Divine Subsistence, Goodness; and  because the Good, as essential Good, by Its being, extends Its Goodness to all things  that be.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p4"></a>For, even as our sun--not as calculating or choosing, but by its very being, enlightens  all things able  <a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_33"></a> to partake of its light in their own degree--so too the Good--as superior  to a sun, as the archetype <i>par excellence, </i>is above an obscure image--by Its  very existence sends to all things that be, the rays of Its whole goodness, according  to their capacity. By reason of these (rays) subsisted all the intelligible and  intelligent essences and powers and energies. By reason of these they are, and have  their life, continuous and undiminished, purified from all corruption and death  and matter, and generation; and separated from the unstable and fluctuating and  vacillating mutability, and are conceived of as incorporeal and immaterial, and  as minds they think in a manner supermundane, and are illuminated as to the reasons  of things, in a manner peculiar to themselves; and they again convey to their kindred  spirits things appropriate to them; and they have their abiding from Goodness; and  thence comes to them stability and consistence and protection, and sanctuary of  good things; and whilst aspiring to It, they have both being and good being; and  being conformed to It, as is attainable, they are both patterns of good, and impart  to those after them, as the Divine Law directs, the gifts which have passed through  to themselves from the Good.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p5"></a>SECTION II.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p6"></a>Thence come to them the supermundane<br> orders, the unions amongst themselves,  the mutual penetrations, the unconfused distinctions, the powers elevating the inferior  to the superior, the providences  <a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 34</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_34"></a> of the more exalted for those below them; the guardings of things  pertaining to each power; and unbroken convolutions around themselves; the identities  and sublimities around the aspiration after the Good; and whatever is said in our  Treatise concerning the angelic properties and orders. Further also, whatever things  belong to the heavenly Hierarchy, the purifications befitting angels, the  supermundane illuminations, and the things perfecting the whole angelic perfection, are from  the all-creative and fontal Goodness; from which was given to them the form of Goodness,  and the revealing in themselves the hidden Goodness, and that angels are, as it  were, heralds of the Divine silence, and project, as it were, luminous lights revealing  Him Who is in secret. Further, after these--the sacred and holy minds--the souls,  and whatever is good in souls is by reason of the super-good Goodness--the fact that  they are intellectual--that they have essential life--indestructible--the very being  itself--and that they are able, whilst elevated themselves to the angelic lives,  to be conducted by them as good guides to the good Origin of all good things, and  to become partakers of the illuminations, thence bubbling forth, according to the  capacity of each, and to participate in the goodlike gift, as they are able, and  whatever else we have enumerated in our Treatise concerning the soul. But also,  if one may be permitted to speak of the irrational souls, or living creatures, such  as cleave the air, and such as walk on earth, and such as creep along earth, and  those whose life is in waters,  <a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_35"></a> or amphibious, and such as live concealed under earth, and burrow  within it, and in one word, such as have the sensible soul or life, even all these  have their soul and life, by reason of the Good. Moreover, all plants have their  growing and moving life from the Good; and even soulless and lifeless substance  is by reason of the Good, and by reason of It, has inherited its substantial condition.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p7"></a>SECTION III.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p8"></a>But, if the Good is above all things being, as indeed it is, and formulates the  formless, even in Itself alone, both the non-essential is a pre-eminence of essence,  and the non-living is a superior life, and the mindless a superior wisdom, and whatever  is in the Good is of a superlative formation of the formless, and if one may venture  to say so, even the nonexistent itself aspires to the Good above all things existing,  and struggles somehow to be even itself in the Good,--the really  Superessential--to  the exclusion of all things.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p9"></a>SECTION IV.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p10"></a>But what slipped from our view in the midst of our discourse, the Good is Cause  of the celestial movements in their commencements and terminations, of their not  increasing, not diminishing, and completely changeless, course <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">31</font></a>
 ,  and of the noiseless movements, if one may so speak, of the vast celestial transit,  and of the astral orders, and the beauties and  <a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_36"></a> lights, and stabilities, and the progressive swift motion of certain  stars, and of the periodical return of the two luminaries, which the Oracles call  "great," from the same to the same quarter, after which our days and nights being  marked, and months and years being measured, mark and number and arrange and comprehend  the circular movements of time and things temporal. But, what would any one say  of the very ray of the sun? For the light is from the Good, and an image of the  Goodness, wherefore also the Good is celebrated under the name of Light; as in a  portrait the original is manifested. For, as the goodness of the Deity, beyond all,  permeates from the highest and most honoured substances even to the lowest, and  yet is above all, neither the foremost outstripping its superiority, nor the things  below eluding its grasp, but it both enlightens all that are capable, and forms  and enlivens, and grasps, and perfects, and is measure of things existing, and age,  and number, and order, and grasp, and cause, and end; so, too, the brilliant likeness  of the Divine Goodness, this our great sun, wholly bright and ever luminous, as  a most distant echo of the Good, both enlightens whatever is capable of participating  in it, and possesses the light in the highest degree of purity, unfolding to the  visible universe, above and beneath, the splendours of its own rays, and if anything  does not participate in them, this is not owing to the inertness or deficiency of  its distribution of light, but is owing to the inaptitude for light-reception of  the things which do not unfold  <a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_37"></a> themselves for the participation of light. No doubt the ray passing  over many things in such condition, enlightens the things after them, and there  is no visible thing which it does not reach, with the surpassing greatness of its  own splendour. Further also, it contributes to the generation of sensible bodies,  and moves them to life, and nourishes, and increases, and perfects, and purifies  and renews; and the light is both measure and number of hours, days, and all our  time. For it is the light itself, even though it was then without form, which the  divine Moses declared to have fixed that first Triad <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">32</font></a>
  of our days. And, just as Goodness turns all things to Itself, and  is chief collector of things scattered, as One-springing and One-making Deity, and  all things aspire to It, as Source and Bond and End, and it is the Good, as the  Oracles say, from Which all things subsisted, and are being brought into being by  an all-perfect Cause; and in Which all things consisted, as guarded and governed  in an all-controlling route; and to Which all things are turned, as to their own  proper end; and to Which all aspire --the intellectual and rational indeed, through  knowledge, and the sensible through the senses, and those bereft of sensible perception  by the innate movement of the aspiration after life, and those without life, and  merely being, by their aptitude for mere substantial participation; after the same  method of its illustrious original, the light also collects and turns to itself  all things existing--things with sight  <a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_38"></a> <i>--</i>things with motion--things enlightened--things heated--things  wholly held together by its brilliant splendours--whence also, Helios, because it  makes all things altogether (<a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p10.4"></a>ἀολλῆ), and collects  things scattered. And all creatures, endowed with sensible perceptions, aspire to  it, as aspiring either to see, or to be moved and enlightened, and heated, and to  be wholly held together by the light. By no means do I affirm, after the statement  of antiquity, that as being God and Creator of the universe, the sun, by itself,  governs the luminous world, but that the invisible things of God are clearly seen  from the foundation of the world, being understood by the things that are made,  even His eternal power and Deity.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p11"></a>SECTION V.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p12"></a>But we have spoken of these things in our <i>Symbolical Theology. </i>Let us  now then celebrate the spiritual Name of Light, under Which we contemplate the Good,  and declare that He, the Good, is called spiritual <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">33</font></a>
   Light, on the ground that He fills every supercelestial mind with spiritual light,  and expels all ignorance and error from all souls in which they may be, and imparts  to them all sacred light, and cleanses their mental vision from the mist which envelops  them, from ignorance, and stirs up and unfolds those enclosed by the great weight  of darkness, and imparts, at first, a measured radiance; then, whilst they taste,  as it were, the light, and  <a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_39"></a> desire it more, more fully gives Itself, and more abundantly enlightens  them, because "they have loved much," and ever elevates them to things in advance,  as befits the analogy of each for aspiration.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p13"></a>SECTION VI.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p14"></a>The Good then above every light is called spiritual Light, as fontal ray, and  stream of light welling over, shining upon every mind, above, around <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">34</font></a>
 , and in the world, from its fulness, and renewing their  whole mental powers, and embracing them all by its over-shadowing; and being above  all by its exaltation; and in one word, by embracing and having previously and pre-eminently  the whole sovereignty of the light-dispensing faculty, as being source of light  and above all light, and by comprehending in itself all things intellectual, and  all things rational, and making them one altogether. For as ignorance puts asunder  those who have gone astray, so the presence of the spiritual light is collective  and unifying of those being enlightened, both perfecting and further turning them  towards the true Being, by turning them from the many notions and collecting the  various views, or, to speak more correctly, fancies, into one true, pure and uniform  knowledge, and by filling them with light, one and unifying.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p15"></a>SECTION VII.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p16"></a>This Good is celebrated by the sacred theologians, both as beautiful and as Beauty,  and as Love, and as  <a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_40"></a> Beloved; and all the other Divine Names which beseem the beautifying  and highly-favoured comeliness. But the beautiful and Beauty are not to be divided,  as regards the Cause which has embraced the whole in one. For, with regard to all  created things, by dividing them into participations and participants, we call beautiful  that which participates in Beauty; but beauty, the participation of the beautifying  Cause of all the beautiful things. But, the superessential Beautiful is called  Beauty, on account of the beauty communicated from Itself to all beautiful things,  in a manner appropriate to each, and as Cause of the good harmony and brightness  of all things which flashes like light to all the beautifying distributions of its  fontal ray, and as calling (<a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p16.1"></a>καλοῦν) all things  to Itself (whence also it is called Beauty) (<a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p16.2"></a>κάλλος),  and as collecting all in all to Itself. (And it is called) Beautiful, as (being)  at once beautiful and super-beautiful, and always being under the same conditions  and in the same manner beautiful, and neither coming into being nor perishing, neither  waxing nor waning; neither in this beautiful, nor in that ugly, nor at one time  beautiful, and at another not; nor in relation to one thing beautiful, and in relation  to another ugly, nor here, and not there, as being beautiful to some, and not beautiful  to others; but as Itself, in Itself, with Itself, uniform, always being beautiful,  and as having beforehand in Itself pre-eminently the fontal beauty of everything  beautiful. For, by the simplex and supernatural nature of all beautiful things,  all beauty, and everything  <a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 41</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_41"></a> beautiful, pre-existed uniquely as to Cause. From this Beautiful (comes)  being to all existing things,--that each is beautiful in its own proper order; and  by reason of the Beautiful are the adaptations of all things, and friendships, and  inter-communions, and by the Beautiful all things are made one, and the Beautiful  is origin of all things, as a creating Cause, both by moving the whole and holding  it together by the love of its own peculiar Beauty; and end of all things, and beloved,  as final Cause (for all things exist for the sake of the Beautiful) and exemplary  (Cause), because all things are determined according to It. Wherefore, also, the  Beautiful is identical with the Good, because all things aspire to the Beautiful  and Good, on every account, and there is no existing thing which does not participate  in the Beautiful and the Good. Yea, reason will dare to say even this, that even  the non-existing participates in the Beautiful and Good. For then even it is beautiful  and good, when in God it is celebrated superessentially to the exclusion of all.  This, the one Good and Beautiful, is uniquely Cause of all the many things beautiful  and good. From this are all the substantial beginnings of things existing, the unions,  the distinctions, the identities, the diversities, the similarities, the dissimilarities,  the communions of the contraries, the commingling of things unified, the providences  of the superior, the mutual cohesions of those of the same rank; the attentions  of the more needy, the protecting and immoveable abidings and stabilities of their  whole selves and, on the other hand, the  <a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 42</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_42"></a> communions of all things among all, in a manner peculiar to each,  and adaptations and unmingled friendships and harmonies of the whole, the blendings  in the whole, and the undissolved connections of existing things, the never-failing  successions of the generations, all rests and movements, of the minds, of the souls,  of the bodies. For, that which is established above every rest, and every movement,  and moves each thing in the law of its own being to its proper movement, is a rest  and movement to all.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p17"></a>SECTION VIII.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p18"></a>Now, the divine minds <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">35</font></a>
  are said to be moved circularly indeed,  by being united to the illuminations of the Beautiful and Good, without beginning  and without end; but in a direct line, whenever they advance to the succour of a  subordinate, by accomplishing all things directly; but spirally, because even in  providing for the more indigent, they remain fixedly, in identity, around the good  and beautiful Cause of their identity, ceaselessly dancing around.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p19"></a>SECTION IX.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p20"></a>Further, there is a movement of soul, circular indeed,--the entrance into itself  from things without, and the unified convolution of its intellectual powers, bequeathing  to it inerrancy, as it were, in a sort of circle, and turning and collecting itself,  from the many things without, first to itself, then, as having become single, uniting  with the uniquely unified powers, and thus conducting to the Beautiful and  <a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 43</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_43"></a> Good, which is above all things being, and One and the Same, and without  beginning and without end. But a soul is moved spirally, in so far as it is illuminated,  as to the divine kinds of knowledge, in a manner proper to itself, not intuitively  and at once, but logically and discursively; and, as it were, by mingled and relative  operations; but in a straight line, when, not entering into itself, and being moved  by unique intuition (for this, as I said, is the circular), but advancing to things  around itself, and from things without, it is, as it were, conducted from certain  symbols, varied and multiplied, to the simple and unified contemplations.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p21"></a>SECTION X.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p22"></a>Of these three motions then in everything perceptible here below, and much more  of the abidings and repose and fixity of each, the Beautiful and Good, which is  above all repose and movement, is Cause and Bond and End; by reason of which, and  from which, and in which, and towards which, and for sake of which, is every repose  and movement. For, both from It and through It is both Essence and every life, and  both of mind and soul and every nature, the minutiae, the equalities, the magnitudes,  all the standards and the analogies of beings, and harmonies and compositions; the  entireties, the parts, every one thing, and multitude, the connections of parts,  the unions of every multitude, the perfections of the entireties, the quality, the  weight, the size, the infinitude, the compounds,  <a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 44</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_44"></a> the distinctions, every infinitude, every term, all the bounds, the  orders, the pre-eminences, the elements, the forms, every essence, every power,  every energy, every condition, every sensible perception, every reason, every conception,  every contact, every science, every union, and in one word, all things existing  are from the Beautiful and Good, and in the Beautiful and Good, and turn themselves  to the Beautiful and Good.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p23"></a>Moreover, all things whatever, which are and come to being, are and come to being  by reason of the Beautiful and Good; and to It all things look, and by It are moved  and held together, and for the sake of It, and by reason of It, and in It, is every  source exemplary, final, creative, formative, elemental, and in one word, every  beginning, every bond, every term, or to speak summarily, all things existing are  from the Beautiful and Good; and all things non-existing are superessentially in  the Beautiful and Good; and it is of all, beginning and term, above beginning and  above term, because from It, and through It, and in It, and to It, are all things,  as says the Sacred Word.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p24"></a>By all things, then, the Beautiful and Good is desired and beloved and cherished;  and, by reason of It, and for the sake of It, the less love the greater suppliantly;  and those of the same rank, their fellows brotherly; and the greater, the less considerately;  and these severally love the things of themselves continuously; and all things by  aspiring to the Beautiful and Good, do and wish all things whatever  <a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 45</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_45"></a> they do and wish. Further, it may be boldly said with truth, that  even the very Author of all things, by reason of overflowing Goodness, loves all,  makes all, perfects all, sustains all, attracts all; and even the Divine Love is  Good of Good, by reason of the Good. For Love itself, the benefactor of things that  be, pre-existing overflowingly in the Good, did not permit itself to remain unproductive  in itself, but moved itself to creation <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">36</font></a>
 ,  as befits the overflow which is generative of all.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p25"></a>SECTION XI.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p26"></a>And let no one fancy that we honour the Name of Love beyond the Oracles, for  it is, in my opinion, irrational and stupid not to cling to the force of the meaning,  but to the mere words; and this is not the characteristic of those who have wished  to comprehend things Divine, but of those who receive empty sounds and keep the  same just at the ears from passing through from outside, and are not willing to  know what such a word signifies, and in what way one ought to distinctly represent  it, through other words of the same force and more explanatory, but who specially  affect sounds and signs without meaning, and syllables, and words unknown, which  do not pass through to the mental part of their soul, but buzz without, around their  lips and ears, as though it were not permitted to signify the number four, by twice  two, or straight lines by direct lines, or motherland by fatherland, or any other,  which signify the self-same thing, by many parts of speech.  <a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 46</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_46"></a></p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p27"></a>We ought to know, according to the correct account, that we use sounds, and syllables,  and phrases, and descriptions, and words, on account of the sensible perceptions;  since when our soul is moved by the intellectual energies to the things contemplated,  the sensible perceptions by aid of sensible objects are superfluous; just as also  the intellectual powers, when the soul, having become godlike, throws itself, through  a union beyond knowledge, against the rays of the unapproachable light, by sightless  efforts. But, when the mind strives to be moved upwards, through objects of sense,  to contemplative conceptions, the clearer interpretations are altogether preferable  to the sensible perceptions, and the more definite descriptions are things more  distinct than things seen; since when objects near are not made clear to the sensible  perceptions, neither will these perceptions be well able to present the things perceived  to the mind. But that we may not seem, in speaking thus, to be pushing aside the  Divine Oracles, let those who libel the Name of Love (<a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p27.1"></a>Ἔρωτος)  hear them. "Be in love with It," they say, "and It will keep thee--Rejoice over It,  and It will exalt thee--Honour It, in order that It may encompass thee,"--and whatever  else is sung respecting Love, in the Word of God.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p28"></a>SECTION XII.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p29"></a>And yet it seemed to some of our sacred expounders that the Name of Love is more  Divine than that of loving-kindness (<a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p29.1"></a>ἀγάπης).  But even the  <a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 47</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_47"></a> Divine Ignatius <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">37</font></a>
  writes, "my own Love  (<a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p29.3"></a>ἔρως) is crucified;" and in the introductions  to the Oracles you will find a certain One saying of the Divine Wisdom, "1 became  enamoured of her Beauty." So that we, certainly, need not be afraid of this Name  of Love, nor let any alarming statement about it terrify us. For the theologians  seem to me to treat as equivalent the name of Loving-kindness, and that of Love;  and on this ground, to attribute, by preference, the veritable Love, to things Divine,  because of the misplaced prejudice of such men as these. For, since the veritable  Love is sung of in a sense befitting God, not by us only, but also by the Oracles  themselves, the multitude, not having comprehended the Oneness of the Divine Name  of Love, fell away, as might be expected of them, to the divided and corporeal and  sundered, seeing it is not a real love, but a shadow, or rather a falling from the  veritable Love. For the Oneness of the Divine and one Love is incomprehensible to  the multitude, wherefore also, as seeming a very hard name to the multitude, it  is assigned to the Divine Wisdom, for the purpose of leading back and restoring  them to the knowledge of the veritable Love; and for their liberation from the difficulty  respecting it. And again, as regards ourselves, where it happened often that men  of an earthly character imagined something out of place, (there is used) what appears  more euphonius. A certain one says, "Thy  <a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 48</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_48"></a> affection fell upon me, as the affection of the women." For those  who have rightly listened to things Divine, the name of Loving-kindness and of Love  is placed by the holy theologians in the same category throughout the Divine revelations,  and this is of a power unifying, and binding together, and mingling pre-eminently  in the Beautiful and Good; pre-existing by reason of the beautiful and good, and  imparted from the beautiful and good, by reason of the Beautiful and Good; and sustaining  things of the same rank, within their mutual coherence, but moving the first to  forethought for the inferior, and attaching the inferior to the superior by respect.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p30"></a>SECTION XIII.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p31"></a>But Divine Love is extatic, not permitting (any) to be lovers of themselves,  but of those beloved. They shew this too, the superior by becoming mindful of the  inferior; and the equals by their mutual coherence; and the inferior, by a more  divine respect towards things superior. Wherefore also, Paul the Great, when possessed  by the Divine Love, and participating in its extatic power, says with inspired lips,  "I live no longer, but Christ lives in me." As a true lover, and beside himself,  as he says, to Almighty God, and not living the life of himself, but the life of  the Beloved, as a life excessively esteemed. One might make bold to say even this,  on behalf of truth, that the very Author of all things, by the beautiful and good  love of everything, through an overflow of His loving goodness, becomes out of Himself,  by His providences for all existing things,  <a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_49"></a> and is, as it were, cozened by goodness and affection and love, and  is led down from the Eminence above all, and surpassing all, to being in all, as  befits an extatic superessential power centred in Himself. Wherefore, those skilled  in Divine things call Him even Jealous, as (being) that vast good Love towards all  beings, and as rousing His loving inclination to jealousy,--and as proclaiming Himself  Jealous--to Whom the things desired are objects of jealousy, and as though the objects  of His providential care were objects of jealousy for Him. And, in short, the lovable  is of the Beautiful and Good, and Love preexisted both in the Beautiful and Good,  and on account of the Beautiful and Good, is and takes Being.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p32"></a>SECTION XIV.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p33"></a>But what do the theologians mean when at one time they call Him Love, and Loving-kindness,  and at another, Loved and Esteemed? For, of the one, He is Author and, as it were,  Producer and Father; but the other, He Himself is; and by one He is moved, but by  the other He moves; or (when they say), that He Himself is Procurer and Mover of  Himself and by Himself. In this sense, they call Him esteemed and loved, as Beautiful  and Good: but again Love and Loving-kindness, as being at once moving and conducting  Power to Himself;--the alone--self Beautiful and Good, by reason of Itself, and, being,  as it were, a manifestation of Itself through Itself, and a good Progression of  the  <a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_50"></a> surpassing union, and a loving Movement, simplex, self-moved, self-operating,  pre-existing in the Good, and from the Good bubbling forth to things existing, and  again returning to the Good, in which also the Divine Love indicates distinctly  Its own unending and unbeginning, as it were a sort of everlasting circle whirling  round in unerring combination, by reason of the Good, from the Good, and in the  Good, and to the Good, and ever advancing and remaining and returning in the same  and throughout the same. And these things our illustrious initiator divinely set  forth throughout His Hymns of Love, of which we may appropriately make mention,  and, as it were, place as a certain sacred chapter to our treatise concerning Love.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p34"></a>SECTION XV.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p35"></a>Extract from the "Hymns of Love" by the most holy Hierotheus:--</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p36"></a>Love, whether we speak of Divine, or Angelic, or intelligent, or psychical, or  physical, let us regard as a certain unifying and combining power, moving the superior  to forethought for the inferior, and the equals to a mutual fellowship, and lastly,  the inferior to respect towards the higher and superior.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p37"></a>SECTION XVI.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p38"></a>Of the same, from the same Erotic Hymns.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p39"></a>Since we have arranged the many loves from the one, by telling, in due order,  what are the<a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_51"></a> kinds of knowledge and powers of the mundane and  supermundane loves; over which, according to the defined purpose of the discourse, the orders  and ranks of the mental and intelligible loves preside; next after <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">38</font></a>
  which are placed the self-existent intelligible and divine,  over the really beautiful loves there which have been appropriately celebrated by  us; now, on the other hand, by restoring all back to the One and enfolded Love,  and Father of them all, let us collect and gather them together from the many, by  contracting It into two Powers entirely lovable, over which rules and precedes altogether  the Cause, resistless from Its universal Love beyond all, and to which is elevated,  according to the nature of each severally, the whole love from all existing things.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p40"></a>SECTION XVII.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p41"></a>Of the same, from the same Hymns of Love.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p42"></a>Come then, whilst collecting these again into one, let us say, that it is a certain  simplex power, which of itself moves to a sort of unifying combination from the  Good, to the lowest of things existing, and from that again in due order, circling  round again, through all to the Good from Itself, and through Itself and by Itself,  and rolling back to Itself always in the same way.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p43"></a>SECTION XVIII.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p44"></a>And yet, any one might say, "if the Beautiful and Good is beloved and desired,  and esteemed  <a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 52</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_52"></a> by all (for even that which is non-existing desires It, as we have  said, and struggles how to be in It; and Itself is the form-giving, even of things  without form, and by It alone, even the non-existing is said to be, and is  superessentially)--"How  is it that the host of demons do not desire the Beautiful and Good, but, through  their earthly proclivities, having fallen away from the angelic identity, as regards  the desire of the Good, have become cause of all evils both to themselves and to  all the others who are said to be corrupted? and why, in short, when the tribes  of demons have been brought into being from the Good, are they not like the Good?  or how, after being a good production from the Good, were they changed? and what  is that which depraved them, and in short, what is evil? and from what source did  it spring? and in which of things existing is it? and how did He, Who is Good, will  to bring it into being? and how, when He willed it, was He able? And if evil is  from another cause, what other cause is there for things existing, beside the Good?  Further, how, when there is a Providence, is there evil, either coming into existence  at all, or not destroyed? And how does any existing thing desire it, in comparison  with the Good?</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p45"></a>SECTION XIX. <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">39</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p46"></a>Such a statement as this might be alleged by way of objection. We, however, on  our part, will  <a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 53</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_53"></a> pray the objector to look to the truth of the facts, and will make  bold to say this first. The Evil is not from the Good, and if it is from the Good,  it is not the Evil. For, it is not the nature of fire to make cold, nor of good  to bring into being things not good; and if all things that be are from the Good  (for to produce and to preserve is natural to the Good, but to destroy and to dissolve,  to the Evil), there is no existing thing from the Evil, nor will the Evil itself  be, if it should be evil even to itself. And, if it be not so, the Evil is not altogether  evil, but has some portion of the Good, in consequence of which it wholly is. Now,  if the things existing desire the Beautiful and Good, and whatever they do, they  do for the sake of that which seems good, and every purpose of things existing has  the Good for its beginning and end (for nothing looking to the Evil <i>qua </i>evil,  does what it does), how shall the Evil be in things existing; or, wholly being,  how has it been seduced from such a good yearning? Also if all the things existing  are from the Good, and the Good is above all things existing, then there is existing  in the Good even the non-existing; but the Evil is not existing; and, if this be  not the case, it is not altogether evil, nor non-existing, for the absolutely non-existing  will be nothing, unless it should be spoken of as in the Good superessentially.  The Good, then, will be fixed far above both the absolutely existing and the non-existing;  but the Evil is neither in things existing, nor in things non-existing, but, being  further distant from the Good than  <a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_54"></a> the non-existing itself, it is alien and more unsubstantial. Where  then is the Evil? some one may perchance say. For if the Evil is not,--virtue and  vice are the same, both universally and particularly. Or, not even that which opposes  itself to virtue will be evil, and yet sobriety and license, and righteousness and  unrighteousness, are contraries. And I, by no means, speak in reference to the just  and unjust man, and the temperate and intemperate man; but also, long before the  difference between the just man and his opposite is made manifest externally, in  the very soul itself the vices stand altogether apart from the virtues, and the  passions rebel against the reason; and from this we must grant some evil contrary  to the Good. For the Good is not contrary to Itself, but as the product from one  Source and one Cause, It rejoices in fellowship and unity and friendship. Nor yet  is the lesser good opposed to the greater, for neither is the less heat or cold  opposed to the greater. The Evil <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">40</font></a>
  then is in things existing,  and is existing, and is opposed, and is in opposition to, the Good; and if it is  the destruction of things existing, this does not expel the Evil from existence;  but it will be, both itself existing, and generator of things existing. Does not  frequently the destruction of one become birth of another? and the Evil will be  contributing to the completion of the whole, and supplying through itself non-imperfection  to the whole.  <a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 55</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_55"></a></p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p47"></a>SECTION XX.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p48"></a>Now to all this true reason will answer, that the Evil <i>qua </i>evil makes  no single essence or birth, but only, as far as it can, pollutes and destroys the  subsistence of things existing. But, if any one says, that it is productive of being,  and that by destruction of one it gives birth to another, we must truly answer,  that not <i>qua </i>destruction it gives birth, but <i>qua </i>destruction and evil,  it destroys and pollutes only, but it becomes birth and essence, by reason of the  Good; and the Evil will be destruction indeed, by reason of itself; but producer  of birth by reason of the Good; and <i>qua </i>evil, it is neither existing, nor  productive of things existing; but, by reason of the Good, it is both existing and  good-existing, and productive of things good. Yea, rather (for neither will the  same by itself be both good and evil, nor the self-same power be of itself destruction  and birth--neither as self-acting power, nor as self-acting destruction), the absolutely  Evil is neither existing nor good, nor generative, nor productive of things being  and good; but the Good in whatever things it may be perfectly engendered, makes  them perfect and pure, and thoroughly good,--but the things which partake of it in  a less degree are both imperfectly good, and impure, by reason of the lack of the  Good. And (thus) the Evil altogether, is not, nor is good, nor good producing; but  that which approaches more or less near the Good will be proportionately good; since  the All-perfect Goodness, in passing through all, not only passes to the  <a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 56</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_56"></a> All-good beings around Itself, but extends Itself to the most remote,  by being present to some thoroughly, to others subordinately, but to the rest, in  the most remote degree, as each existing thing is able to participate in It. And  some things, indeed, participate in the Good entirely, whilst others are deprived  of It, in a more or less degree, but others possess a more obscure participation  in the Good; and to the rest, the Good is present as a most distant echo. For if  the Good were not present according to the capacity of each, the most Divine and  honoured would occupy the rank of the lowest. And how were it possible that all  should participate in the Good uniformly, when not all are in the same way adapted  to its whole participation?</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p49"></a>Now, this is the exceeding greatness of the power of the Good, that It empowers,  both things deprived, and the deprivation of Itself, with a view to the entire participation  of itself. And, if one must make bold to speak the truth, even the things fighting  against It, both are, and are able to fight, by Its power. Yea rather, in order  that I may speak summarily, all things which are, in so far as they are, both are  good, and from the Good; but, in so far as they are deprived of the Good, are neither  good, nor do they exist. For, even with regard to the other conditions, such as  heat or cold, there are things which have been heated, and when the heat has departed  from them, many of them are deprived both of life and intelligence (now Almighty  God is outside essence, and is, superessentially), and, in  <a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 57</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_57"></a> one word, with regard to the rest, even when the condition has departed,  or has not become completely developed, things exist, and are able to subsist; but  that which is every way deprived of the Good, in no way or manner ever was, or is,  or will be, nor is able to be. For example, the licentious man, even if he have  been deprived of the Good, as regards his irrational lust, in this respect he neither  is, nor desires realities, but nevertheless he participates in the Good, in his  very obscure echo of union and friendship. And, even Anger participates in the Good,  by the very movement and desire to direct and turn the seeming evils to the seeming  good. And the very man, who desires the very worst life, as wholly desirous of life  and that which seems best to him, by the very fact of desiring, and desiring life,  and looking to a best life, participates in the Good. And, if you should entirely  take away the Good, there will be neither essence, nor life, nor yearning, nor movement,  nor anything else. So that the fact, that birth is born from destruction, is not  a power of evil, but a presence of a lesser good, even as disease is a defect of  order, not total--for, if this should be, not even the disease itself will continue  to exist, but the disease remains and is, by having the lowest possible order of  essence, and in this continues to exist as a parasite. For that which is altogether  deprived of the Good, is neither existing, nor in things existing; but the compound,  by reason of the Good in things existing, and in consequence of this in things  <a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 58</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_58"></a> existing, is also existing in so far as it participates in the Good.  Yea rather, all things existing will so far be, more or less, as they participate  in the Good; for, even as respects the self-existing Being, that which in no ways  is at all, will not be at all; but that which partially is, but partially is not,  in so far as it has fallen from the ever Being, is not; but so far as it has participated  in the Being, so far it is, and its whole being, and its non-being, is sustained  and preserved. And the Evil,--that which has altogether fallen from the Good--will  be good, neither in the more nor in the less; but the partially good, and partially  not good, fight no doubt against a certain good, but not against the whole Good,  and, even it is sustained by the participation of the Good, and the Good gives essence  even to the privation of Itself, wholly by the participation of Itself; for, when  the Good has entirely departed, there will be neither anything altogether good,  nor compound, nor absolute evil. For, if the Evil is an imperfect good, (then) by  the entire absence of the Good, both the imperfect and the perfect Good will be  absent; and then only will be, and be seen, the Evil, when on the one hand, it is  an evil to those things to which it was opposed, and, on the other, is expelled  from other things on account of their goodness. For, it is impossible that the same  things, under the same conditions in every respect, should fight against each other.  The Evil then is not an actual thing.  <a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 59</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_59"></a></p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p50"></a>SECTION XXI.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p51"></a>But neither is the Evil in things existing. For, if all things existing are from  the Good, and the Good is in all things existing, and embraces all, either the Evil  will not be in things existing, or it will be in the Good; and certainly it will  not be in the Good, for neither is cold in fire, nor to do evil in Him, Who turns  even the evil to good. But, if it shall be, how will the Evil be in the Good? If  forsooth, from Itself, it is absurd and impossible. For it is not possible, as the  infallibility of the Oracles affirms, that a "good tree should bring forth evil  fruits," nor certainly, <i>vice versa. </i>But, if not from Itself, it is evident  that it will be from another source and cause. For, either the Evil will be from  the Good, or the Good from the Evil; or, if this be not possible, both the Good  and the Evil will be from another source and cause, for no dual is source, but a  Unit will be source of every dual. Further, it is absurd that two entirely contraries  should proceed and be from one and the same, and that the self-same source should  be, not simplex and unique, but divided and double, and contrary to itself, and  be changed; and certainly it is not possible that there should be two contrary sources  of things existing, and that these should be contending in each other, and in the  whole. For, if this were granted, even Almighty God will not be in repose, nor free  from disquietude, if there were indeed something bringing disturbance even to Him.  Then,  <a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_60"></a> everything will be in disorder, and always fighting; and yet the Good  distributes friendship to all existing things, and is celebrated by the holy theologians,  both as very Peace, and Giver of Peace. Wherefore, things good are both friendly  and harmonious, every one, and products of one life, and marshalled to one good;  and kind, and similar, and affable to each other. So that the Evil is not in God,  and the Evil is not inspired by God. But neither is the Evil from God, for, either  He is not good, or He does good, and produces good things; and, not once in a way,  and some; and at another time not, and not all; for this would argue transition  and change, even as regards the very Divinest thing of all, the Cause. But, if in  God, the Good is sustaining essence, God, when changing from the Good, will be sometimes  Being, and sometimes not Being. But, if He has the Good by participation, He will  then have it from another; and sometimes He will have it, and sometimes not. The  Evil, then, is not from God, nor in God, neither absolutely nor occasionally.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p52"></a>SECTION XXII.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p53"></a>But neither is the Evil in Angels; for if the good-like angel proclaims the goodness  of God, being by participation in a secondary degree that which the Announced is  in the first degree as Cause, the Angel is a likeness of Almighty God--a manifestation  of the unmanifested light--a mirror untarnished--most transparent--without flaw--pure--without  spot--  <a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 61</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_61"></a> receiving, if I may so speak, the full beauty of the Good-stamped  likeness of God--and without stain, shedding forth undefiledly in itself, so far  as is possible, the goodness of the Silence, which dwells in innermost shrines.  The Evil, then, is not even in Angels. But by punishing sinners are they evil? By  this rule, then, the punishers of transgressors are evil, and those of the priests  who shut out the profane from the Divine Mysteries. And yet, the being punished  is not an evil, but the becoming worthy of punishment; nor the being deservedly  expelled from Holy things, but the becoming accursed of God, and unholy and unfit  for things un-defiled.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p54"></a>SECTION XXIII.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p55"></a>But, neither are the demons evil by nature; for, if they are evil by nature,  neither are they from the Good, nor amongst things existing; nor, in fact, did they  change from good, being by nature, and always, evil. Then, are they evil to themselves  or to others? If to themselves, they also destroy themselves; but if to others,  how destroying, or what destroying?--Essence, or power, or energy? If indeed Essence,  in the first place, it is not contrary to nature; for they do not destroy things  indestructible by nature, but things receptive of destruction. Then, neither is  this an evil for every one, and in every case; but, not even any existing thing  is destroyed, in so far as it is essence and nature, but by the defect of nature’s  order, the  <a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 62</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_62"></a> principle of harmony and proportion lacks the power to remain as it  was. But the lack of strength is not complete, for the complete lack of power takes  away even the disease and the subject; and such a disease will be even a destruction  of itself; so that, such a thing is not an evil, but a defective good, for that  which has no part of the Good will not be amongst things which exist. And with regard  to the destruction of power and energy the principle is the same. Then, how are  the demons, seeing they come into being from God, evil? For the Good brings forth  and sustains good things. Yet they are called evil, some one may say. But not as  they are (for they are from the Good, and obtained a good being), but, as they are  not, by not having had strength, as the Oracles affirm, "to keep their first estate."  For in what, tell me, do we affirm that the demons become evil, except in the ceasing  in the habit and energy for good things Divine? Otherwise, if the demons are evil  by nature, they are always evil; yet evil is unstable. Therefore, if they are always  in the same condition, they are not evil; for to be ever the same is a characteristic  of the Good. But, if they are not always evil, they are not evil by nature, but  by wavering from the angelic good qualities. And they are not altogether without  part in the good, in so far as they both are, and live and think, and in one word--as  there is a sort of movement of aspiration in them. But they are said to be evil,  by reason of their weakness as regards their action according to nature. The evil  then, in them, is  <a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 63</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_63"></a> a turning aside and a stepping out of things befitting themselves,  and a missing of aim, and imperfection and impotence, and a weakness and departure,  and falling away from the power which preserves their integrity in them. Otherwise,  what is evil in demons? An irrational anger--a senseless desire--a headlong fancy.--But  these, even if they are in demons, are not altogether, nor in every respect, nor  in themselves alone, evils. For even with regard to other living creatures, not  the possession of these, but the loss, is both destruction to the creature, and  an evil. But the possession saves, and makes to be, the nature of the living creature  which possesses them. The tribe of demons then is not evil, so far as it is according  to nature, but so far as it is not; and the whole good which was given to them was  not changed, but themselves fell from the whole good given. And the angelic gifts  which were given to them, we by no means affirm that they were changed, but they  exist, and are complete, and all luminous, although the demons themselves do not  see, through having blunted their powers of seeing good. So far as they are, they  are both from the Good, and are good, and aspire to the Beautiful and the Good,  by aspiring to the realities, Being, and Life, and Thought; and by the privation  and departure and declension from the good things befitting them, they are called  evil, and are evil as regards what they are not: and by aspiring to the non-existent,  they aspire to the Evil.  <a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 64</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_64"></a></p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p56"></a>SECTION XXIV.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p57"></a>But does some one say that souls are evil? If it be that they meet with evil  things providentially, and with a view to their preservation, this is not an evil,  but a good, and from the Good, Who makes even the evil good. But, if we say that  souls become evil, in what respect do they become evil, except in the failure of  their good habits and energies; and, by reason of their own lack of strength, missing  their aim and tripping? For we also say, that the air around us becomes dark by  failure and absence of light, and yet the light itself is always light, that which  enlightens even the darkness. The Evil, then, is neither in demons nor in us, as  an <i>existent </i>evil, but as a failure and dearth of the perfection of our own  proper goods.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p58"></a>SECTION XXV.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p59"></a>But neither is the Evil in irrational creatures, for if you should take away  anger and lust, and the other things which we speak of, and which are not absolutely  evil in their own nature, the lion having lost his boldness and fierceness will  not be a lion; and the dog, when he has become gentle to every body, will not be  a dog, since to keep guard is a dog’s duty, and to admit those of the household,  but to drive away the stranger. So the fact that nature is not destroyed is not  an evil, but a destruction of nature, weakness, and failure of the natural habitudes  and energies and powers. And, if all  <a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 65</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_65"></a> things through generation in time have their perfection, the imperfect  is not altogether contrary to universal nature.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p60"></a>SECTION XXVI.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p61"></a>But neither is the Evil in nature throughout, for if all the methods of nature  are from universal nature, there is nothing contrary to it. But in each individual  (nature) one thing will be according to nature, and another not according to nature.  For one thing is contrary to nature in one, and another in another, and that which  is according to nature to one, is to the other, contrary to nature. But malady of  nature, that which is the contrary to nature, is the deprivation of things of nature.  So that there is not an evil nature; but this is evil to nature, the inability to  accomplish the things of one’s proper nature.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p62"></a>SECTION XXVII.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p63"></a>But, neither is the Evil in bodies. For deformity and disease are a defect of  form, and a deprivation of order. And this is not altogether an evil, but a less  good; for if a dissolution of beauty and form and order become complete, the body  itself will be gone. But that the body is not cause of baseness to the soul is evident,  from the fact that baseness continues to coexist even without a body, as in demons.  For this is evil to minds and souls and bodies, (viz.) the weakness and declension  from the habitude of their own proper goods.  <a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 66</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_66"></a></p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p64"></a>SECTION XXVIII.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p65"></a>But neither (a thing which they say over and over again) is the evil in matter,  so far as it is matter. For even it participates in ornament and beauty and form.  But if matter, being without these, by itself is without quality and without form,  how does matter produce anything--matter, which, by itself, is impassive? Besides  how is matter an evil? for, if it does not exist in any way whatever, it is neither  good nor evil but if it is any how existing, and all things existing are from the  Good, even it would be from the Good; and either the Good is productive of the Evil,  or the Evil, as being from the Good, is good; or the Evil is capable of producing  the Good; or even the Good, as from the Evil, is evil; or further, there are two  first principles, and these suspended from another one head. And, if they say that  matter is necessary, for a completion of the whole Cosmos, how is matter an evil?  For the Evil is one thing, and the necessary <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">41</font></a>
  is another.  But, how does He, Who is Good, bring anything to birth from the Evil? or, how is  that, which needs the Good, evil? For the Evil shuns the nature of the Good. And  how does matter, being evil, generate and nourish nature? For the Evil, <i>quâ </i>evil, neither generates, nor nourishes, nor solely produces, nor preserves anything.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p66"></a>But, if they should say, that it does not make baseness in souls, but that they  are dragged to it, how will this be true? for many of them look towards the  <a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 67</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_67"></a> good; and yet how did this take place, when matter was dragging them  entirely to the Evil? So that the Evil in souls is not from matter, but from a disordered  and discordant movement. But, if they say this further, that they invariably follow  matter, and unstable matter is necessary for those who are unable to stand firmly  by themselves, how is the Evil necessary, or the necessary an evil?</p>

 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p68"></a>But neither is it this which we affirm--the "privation fights against the Good  by its own power <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">42</font></a>
 "; for the complete privation is altogether  powerless, and the partial has the power, not in respect of privation, but in so  far as it is not a complete privation. For, whilst privation of good is partial,  it is not, as yet, an evil, and when, it has become an accomplished fact, the nature  of the evil has departed also.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p69"></a>SECTION XXX.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p70"></a>But, to speak briefly, the Good is from the one and the whole Cause, but the  Evil is from many and partial defects. Almighty God knows the Evil <i>qua </i>good;  and, with Him, the causes of the evils are powers producing good <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">43</font></a>
 . But, if the Evil is eternal, and creates, and has  power, and is, and does, whence do these come to it? Is it either from the Good,  or by the Good from the Evil, or by both from another cause? Everything that is  according to nature comes into being from a  <a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 68</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_68"></a> defined cause. And if the Evil is without cause, and undefined, it  is not according to nature. For there is not in nature what is contrary to nature;  nor is there any <i>raison d’ etre </i>for want of art in art. Is then the soul  cause of things evil, as fire of burning, and does it fill everything that it happens  to touch with baseness? Or, is the nature of the soul then good, but, by its energies,  exists sometimes in one condition, and sometimes in another? If indeed by nature,  even its existence is an evil, and whence then does it derive its existence? Or,  is it from the good Cause creative of the whole universe? But, if from this, how  is it essentially evil? For good are all things born of this. But if by energies,  neither is this invariable, and if not, whence are the virtues? Since it (the soul)  comes into being without even seeming good. It remains then that the Evil is a weakness  and a falling short of the Good.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p71"></a>SECTION XXXI.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p72"></a>The Cause of things good is One. If the Evil is contrary to the Good, the many  causes of the Evil, certainly those productive of things evil, are not principles  and powers, but want of power, and want of strength, and a mixing of things dissimilar  without proportion. Neither are things evil unmoved, and always in the same condition,  but endless and undefined, and borne along in different things, and those endless.  The Good will be beginning and end of all, even things evil, for, for the sake of  the Good, are all things, both those that are good, and  <a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 69</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_69"></a> those that are contrary. For we do even these as desiring the Good  (for no one does what he does with a view to the Evil), wherefore the Evil has not  a subsistence, but a parasitical subsistence, coming into being for the sake of  the Good, and not of itself.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p73"></a>SECTION XXXII.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p74"></a>It is to be laid down that being belongs to the Evil as an accident and by reason  of something else, and not from its own origin, and thus that that which comes into  being appears to be right, because it comes into being for the sake of the Good,  but that in reality it is not right for the reason that we think that which is not  good to be good. The desired is shewn to be one thing, and that which comes to pass  is another. The Evil, then, is beside the path, and beside the mark, and beside  nature, and beside cause, and beside beginning, and beside end, and beside limit,  and beside intention, and beside purpose. The Evil then is privation and failure,  and want of strength, and want of proportion, and want of attainment, and want of  purpose; and without beauty, and without life, and without mind, and without reason,  and without completeness, and without stability, and without cause, and without  limit, and without production; and inactive, and without result, and disordered,  and dissimilar, and limitless, and dark, and unessential, and being itself nothing  in any manner of way whatever. How, in short, can evil do anything by its mixture  with the Good? For that which is altogether without participation  <a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 70</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_70"></a> in the Good, neither is anything, nor is capable of anything. For,  if the Good is both an actual thing and an object of desire, and powerful and effective,  how will the contrary to the Good,--that which has been deprived of essence, and  intention, and power, and energy,--be capable of anything? Not all things are evil  to all, nor the same things evil in every respect. To a demon, evil is to be contrary  to the good-like mind--to a soul, to be contrary to reason--to a body, to be contrary  to nature.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p75"></a>SECTION XXXIII.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p76"></a>How, in short, are there evils when there is a Providence? The Evil, <i>qua </i>evil, is not, neither as an actual thing nor as in things existing. And no single  thing is without a Providence. For neither is the Evil an actual thing existing  unmixed with the Good. And, if no single thing is without participation in the Good,  but the lack of the Good is an evil, and no existing thing is deprived absolutely  of the Good, the Divine Providence is in all existing things, and no single thing  is without Providence. But Providence, as befits Its goodness, uses even evils which  happen for the benefit, either individual or general, of themselves or others, and  suitably provides for each being. Wherefore we will not admit the vain statement  of the multitude, who say that Providence ought to lead us to virtue, even against  our will. For to destroy nature is not a function of Providence. Hence, as Providence  is conservative of the nature of each, it provides for  <a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 71</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_71"></a> the free, as free; and for the whole, and individuals, according to  the wants of all and each, as far as the nature of those provided for admits the  providential benefits of its universal and manifold Providence, distributed proportionably  to each.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p77"></a>SECTION XXXIV.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p78"></a>The Evil, then, is not an actual thing, nor is the Evil in things existing. For  the Evil, <i>qua </i>evil, is nowhere, and the fact that evil comes into being is  not in consequence of power, but by reason of weakness. And, as for the demons,  what they are is both from the Good, and good. But their evil is from the declension  from their own proper goods, and a change--the weakness, as regards their identity  and condition, of the angelic perfection befitting them. And they aspire to the  Good, in so far as they aspire to be and to live and to think. And in so far as  they do not aspire to the Good, they aspire to the non-existent; and this is not  aspiration, but a missing of the true aspiration.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p79"></a>SECTION XXXV.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-p80"></a>Now the Oracles call conscious transgressors those who are thoroughly weak as  regards the ever memorable knowledge or the practise of the Good, and who, knowing  the will, do not perform it,--those who are hearers indeed, but are weak concerning  the faith, or the energy of the Good. And for some, it is against their will to  understand to do good, by reason of the deviation or weakness of the will.  <a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 72</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_72"></a> And in short, the Evil (as we have often said) is want of strength  and want of power, and defect, either of the knowledge, or the never to be forgotten  knowledge, or of the faith, or of the aspiration, or of the energy of the Good.  Yet, some one may say, the weakness is not punishable, but on the contrary is pardonable.  Now, if the power were not granted, the statement might hold good; but, if power  comes from the Good, Who giveth, according to the Oracles, the things suitable to  all absolutely, the failure and deviation, and departure and declension of the possession  from the Good of our own proper goods is not praiseworthy. But let these things  suffice to have been sufficiently said according to our ability in our writings  "<i>Concerning just and Divine chastisement" </i>throughout which sacred treatise  the infallibility of the Oracles has cast aside those sophistical statements as  senseless words, speaking injustice and falsehood against Almighty God. But now,  according to our ability, the Good has been sufficiently praised, as really lovable,--as  beginning and end of all--as embracing things existing--as giving form to things not  existing--as Cause of all good things--as guiltless of things evil--as Providence and  Goodness complete--and soaring above things that are and things that are not--and  turning to good things evil, and the privation of Itself--as by all desired, and  loved, and esteemed, and whatever else, the true statement, as I deem, has demonstrated  in the preceding.  <a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.iv-Page_73"></a></p>
