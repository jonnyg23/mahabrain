 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Works of Dionysius the Areopagite, tr. by John Parker, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iv.ii.xiii"></a> <h3 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p0.1"></a>CAPUT XIII.</h3> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p1"></a>For what reason the Prophet Isaiah is said to have been purified  by the Seraphim.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p2"></a>Section I.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p3"></a>Come, then, let us examine this as best we can, why the Seraphim  is said to be sent to one of the Theologians; for some one may object, that not  one of the inferior Angels, but he, the enrolled amongst the most reverend Beings,  cleanses the Prophet.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p4"></a>Section II.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p5"></a>Some, then, affirm that, according to the definition already given  of the mutual relation of all the Minds, the Logion does not name one of the highest  around God, as having come for the cleansing of the Theologian, but that some one  of the Angels, placed over us as a sacred Minister of the Prophet’s cleansing, is  called by the same name. as the Seraphim, on the ground that the removal of the  faults spoken of, and the restoration of him who was cleansed for the Divine mission,  was through fire; and they say that the Logion speaks simply of one of the Seraphim,  not one of those who are established around God, but one of the Powers set over  us for the purpose of cleansing.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p6"></a>Section III.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p7"></a>Now another man brought forward to me a by no means foolish defence  of the present position.  <a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 47</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.xiii-Page_47"></a> For he said that that great one, whoever he was,--the Angel who formed  this vision for the purpose of teaching the theologian Divine things,--referred  his own cleansing function to God, and after God, to the first working Hierarchy.  And was not this statement certainly true? For he who said this, affirmed that the  supremely Divine Power in visiting all, advances and penetrates all irresistibly,  and yet is invisible to all, not only as being superessentially elevated above all,  but as secretly transmitting its providential energies to all; yea, rather,  it is manifested to all the intellectual Beings in due degree, and by conducting  Its own gift of Light to the most reverend Beings, through them, as first, It distributes  in due order to the subordinate, according to the power of each Division to bear  the vision of God; or to speak more strictly, and through familiar illustrations  (for if they fall short of the Glory of God, Who is exalted above all, yet they  are more illustrating for us), the distribution of the sun’s ray passes with easy  distribution to first matter, as being more transparent than all, and, through it  with greater clearness, lights up its own splendours; but when it strikes more dense  materials, its distributed brilliancy becomes more obscure, from the inaptitude  of the materials illuminated for transmission of the gift of Light, and from this  it is naturally contracted, so as to almost entirely exclude the passage of Light.  Again, the heat of fire transmits itself chiefly to things that are more receptive,  and yielding, and conductive  <a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 48</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.xiii-Page_48"></a> to assimilation to itself; but, as regards repellent opposing substances,  either it leaves none, or a very light, trace of its fiery energy; and further,  when through substances favourable to its proper action, it comes in contact with  things not congenial,--first, it perchance makes things easily changed to heating  hot, and through them heats proportionately either water or something else which  is not easily heated. After the same rule, then, of Nature’s well-ordered method,  the regulation of all good order, both visible and invisible, manifests supernaturally  the brightness of its own gift of Light, in first manifestation to the most exalted  Beings, in abundant streams, and through these, the Beings after them partake of  the Divine ray. For these, as knowing God first, and striving preeminently after  Divine virtue, and to become first-workers, are deemed worthy of the power and energy  for the imitation of God, as attainable, and these benevolently elevate the beings  after them to an equality, as far as possible, by imparting ungrudgingly to them  the splendour which rests upon themselves, and these again to the subordinate, and  throughout each Order, the first rank imparts its gift to that after it, and the  Divine Light thus rests upon all, in due proportion, with providential forethought.  There is, then, for all those who are illuminated, a Source of illumination, viz.,  God, by nature, and really, and properly, as Essence of Light, and Cause of Being,  and Vision itself; but, by ordinance, and for Divine imitation, the relatively  <a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.xiii-Page_49"></a> superior (is source) for each after it, by the fact, that the Divine rays  are poured through it to that. All the remaining Angelic Beings, then, naturally  regard the highest Order of the Heavenly Minds as source, after God, of every God-knowledge  and God-imitation, since, through them, the supremely Divine illumination is distributed  to all, and to us. Wherefore, they refer every holy energy of Divine imitation to  God indeed as Cause, but to the first Godlike Minds, as first agents and teachers  of things Divine.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p8"></a>The first Order, then, of the holy Angels possesses, more than  all, the characteristic of fire, and the streaming distribution of supremely Divine  wisdom, and the faculty of knowing the highest science of the Divine illuminations,  and the characteristic of Thrones, exhibiting their expansion for the reception  of God; and the ranks of the subordinate Beings possess indeed the empyrean, the  wise, the knowing, the God-receptive, faculty, but subordinately, and by looking  to the first, and through them, as being deemed worthy of the Divine imitation in  first operation, are conducted to the attainable likeness of God. The aforesaid  holy characteristics, then, which the Beings after them possess, through the first,  they attribute to those Beings themselves, after God, as Hierarchs.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p9"></a>Section IV.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.xiii-p10"></a>He who said this, used to affirm, that this vision was shewn to  the Theologian, through one of the  <a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.xiii-Page_50"></a>holy and blessed Angels set over us, and that from his illuminating  direction, he was elevated to that intellectual contemplation in which he saw the  most exalted Beings seated (to speak symbolically) under God, and with God, and  around <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_214"><font size="1">215</font></a>
  God, and the super-princely <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="#fn_215"><font size="1">216</font></a>
   Eminence elevated unspeakably above them and all, seated on high in the midst of  the superior Powers. The Theologian then learned, from the things seen, that, as  compared with every super-essential pre-eminence, the Divine Being was seated incomparably  above every visible and invisible power, yea, even that It is exalted above all,  as the Reality of all things, as Absolute--not even like to the first of created  Beings;--further also, that It is source and essentiating Cause, and unalterable  Fixity of the undissolved continuance of all things, from, Which is both the being  and the well-being of the most exalted Powers themselves. Then he revealed that  the Godlike powers of the most holy Seraphim, themselves, whose sacred appellation  signifies the Fiery, concerning which we shall shortly speak as best we can, conducted  the elevations of the empyrean power to the Divine likeness. And, the holy Theologian,  by viewing the description of free and most exalted elevation of the sixfold wings  to the Divine Being in first, middle, and last conceptions, and further, their endless  feet and many faces, and their extended wings--one under their feet, and the other  over their faces, as seen in vision, and the perpetual movement of their middle  wings--was  <a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.xiii-Page_51"></a>brought to the intelligible knowledge of the things seen, since there  was manifested to him the power of the most exalted minds for deep penetration and  contemplation, and the sacred reverence which they have, supermundanely, for the  bold and courageous and unattainable scrutiny into higher and deeper mysteries;  and of the incessant and high-flying perpetual movement of their Godlike energies  in due proportion. But he was also taught the hidden mysteries of that supremely  Divine and much esteemed Hymn of Praise--whilst the Angel who formed the vision  imparts, as far as possible, his own sacred knowledge to the Theologian. He also  taught him this, that the participation, as far as attainable, in the supremely  Divine and radiant purity, is a purification to the pure however pure; and it being  accomplished from the very Godhead by most exalted causes, for all the sacred Minds  by a superessential hiddenness, is in a manner more clear, and exhibits and distributes  itself, in a higher degree, to the highest powers around It; but with regard to  the second, or us, the lowest mental powers, as each is distant from, as regards  the Divine likeness, so It contracts its brilliant illumination to the single unknowable  of its own hiddenness. And it illuminates the second, severally, through the first;  and, if one must speak briefly, it is firstly brought from hiddenness to manifestation  through the first powers. This, then, the Theologian was taught by the Angel who  was leading him to Light--that purification, and all the supremely Divine operations,  <a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 52</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.xiii-Page_52"></a>illuminating through the first Beings, are distributed to all the rest,  according to the relation of each for the deifying participations. Wherefore he  reasonably attributed to the Seraphim, after God, the characteristic of purification  by fire. There is nothing, then, absurd, if the Seraphim is said to purify the Prophet.  For, as God purifies all, by being cause of every purification, yea, rather (for  I use a familiar illustration) just as our Hierarch, when purifying or enlightening  through his Leitourgoi or Priests, is said himself to purify and enlighten, since  the Orders consecrated through him attribute to him their own proper sacred operations;  so also the Angel who effected the purification of the Theologian attributes his  own purifying science and power to God, indeed, as Cause, but to the Seraphim as  first-operating Hierarch; as any one might say with Angelic reverence, whilst teaching  one who was being purified by him, "There is a preeminent Source, and Essence, and  Worker, and Cause of the cleansing wrought upon you from me, He Who brings both  the first Beings into Being, and holds them together by their fixity around Himself,  and keeps them without change and without fall, moving them to the first participations  of His own Providential energies (for this, He Who taught me these things used to  say, shews the mission of the Seraphim), but as Hierarch and Leader after God, the  Marshal of the most exalted Beings, from whom I was taught to purify after the example  of God -- this is he, who cleanses thee through me, through whom the Cause and  Creator  <a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 53</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.xiii-Page_53"></a> of all cleansing brought forth His own provident energies from the Hidden  even to us." These things, then, he taught me, and I impart them to thee. Let it  be a part of thy intellectual and discriminating skill, either, to acquit each of  the causes assigned from objection, and to honour this before the other as having  likelihood and good reason, and perhaps, the truth; or, to find out from yourself  something more allied to the real truth, or to learn from another; (God, of course,  giving expression, and Angels supplying it;) and to reveal to us, the friends of  Angels, a view more luminous if it should be so, and to me specially welcome.</p>
