 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p1"></a><a name="iv.iii.v-p1.1"></a>I. Concerning sacerdotal  Consecrations.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p2"></a>Section I.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p3"></a>Such, then, is the most Divine perfecting work of the Muron But it may be opportune,  after these Divine ministrations, to set forth the sacerdotal Orders and elections  themselves, and their powers, and operations, and consecrations, and the triad of  the superior ranks under them; in order that the arrangement of our Hierarchy may  be demonstrated, as entirely rejecting and excluding the disordered, the unregulated,  and the confused; and, at the same time, choosing and manifesting the regulated  and ordered, and well-established, in the gradations of the sacred Ranks within  it. Now we have well shewn, as I think, in the Hierarchies already extolled by us,  the threefold division of every Hierarchy, when we affirmed that our sacred tradition  holds, that every Hierarchical transaction is divided into the most Divine Mystic  Rites, and the inspired experts and teachers of them, and those who are being religiously  initiated by them.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p4"></a>Section II.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p5"></a>Thus the most holy Hierarchy of the supercelestial Beings has, for its initiation,  its own possible and most immaterial conception of God and things Divine, and the  complete likeness to God, and a persistent  <a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 124</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_124"></a> habit of imitating God, as far as permissible.  And its illuminators, and leaders to this sacred consecration, are the very first  Beings around God. For these generously and proportionately transmit to the subordinate  sacred Ranks the ever deifying notions given to them, by the self-perfect Godhead  and the wise-making Divine Minds. Now the Ranks, who are subordinate to the first  Beings, are, and are truly called, the initiated Orders, as being religiously conducted,  through those, to the deifying illumination of the Godhead. And after this,--the  heavenly and supermundane Hierarchy,--the Godhead gave the Hierarchy under the  Law, imparting its most holy gifts, for the benefit of our race, to them (as being  children according to the Logion), by faint images of the true, and copies far from  the Archetypes, and enigmas hard to understand, and types having the contemplation  enveloped within, as an analogous light not easily discerned, so as not to wound  weak, eyes by the light shed upon them. Now to this Hierarchy under the Law, the  elevation to spiritual worship is an initiation. Now the men religiously instructed  for that holy tabernacle by Moses,--the first initiated and leader of the Hierarchs  under the Law,--were conductors; in reference to which holy tabernacle,--when  describing for purposes of instruction the Hierarchy under the Law,--he called  all the sacred services of the Law an image of the type shewn  <a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 125</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_125"></a> to him in Mount Sinai. But "initiated"  are those who are being conducted to a more perfect revelation of the symbols of  the Law, in proportion to their capacity. Now the Word of God calls our Hierarchy  the more perfect revelation, naming it a fulfilment of that, and a holy  inheritance. It is both heavenly and legal, like the mean between extremes, common  to the one, by intellectual contemplations, and to the other, because it is variegated  by sensible signs; and, through these, reverently conduces to the Divine Being.  And it has likewise a threefold division of the Hierarchy, which is divided into  the most holy ministrations of the Mystic Rites, and into the Godlike ministers  of holy things, and those who are being conducted by them, according to their capacity,  to things holy.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p6"></a>And each of the three divisions of our Hierarchy, comformably to that of the  Law, and the Hierarchy, more divine than ours, is arranged as first and middle and  last in power; consulting both reverent proportion, and well-ordered and concordant  fellowship of all things <i>in </i>harmonious rank.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p7"></a>Section III.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p8"></a>The most holy ministration, then, of the Mystic Rites has, as first Godlike power,  the holy cleansing of the uninitiated; and as middle, the enlightening instruction  of the purified; and as last, and summary of the former, the perfecting of those  instructed in  <a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 126</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_126"></a> science of their proper instructions;  and the order of the Ministers, in the first power, cleanses the uninitiated through  the Mystic Rites; and in the second, conducts to light the purified; and in the  last and highest of the Ministering Powers, makes perfect those who have participated  in the Divine light, by the scientific completions of the illuminations contemplated.  And of the Initiated, the first power is that being purified; and the middle is  that being enlightened, after the cleansing, and which contemplates certain holy  things; and the last and more divine than the others, is that enlightened in the  perfecting science of the holy enlightenment of which it has become a contemplator.  Let, then, the threefold power of the holy service of the Mystic Rites be extolled,  since the Birth in God is exhibited in the Oracles as a purification and enlightening  illumination, and the Rite of the Synaxis and the Muron, as a perfecting knowledge  and science of the works of God, through which the unifying elevation to the Godhead  and most blessed communion is reverently perfected. And now let us explain next  the sacerdotal Order, which is divided into a purifying and illuminating and perfecting  discipline.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p9"></a>Section IV.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p10"></a>This, then, is the all-sacred Law of the Godhead, that, through the first, the  second are conducted to Its most Divine splendour. Do we not see the material substances  of the elements, first approaching, by preference, things which are more congenial  <a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 127</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_127"></a> to them, and, through these, diffusing  their own energy to other things? Naturally, then, the Head and Foundation of all  good order, invisible and visible, causes the deifying rays to approach the more  Godlike first, and through them, as being more transparent Minds, and more properly  adapted for reception and transmission of Light, transmits light and manifestations  to the subordinate, in proportions suitable to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p11"></a>It is, then, the function of these, the first contemplators of God, to exhibit  ungrudgingly to those second, in proportion to their capacity, the Divine visions  reverently gazed upon by themselves, and to reveal the things relating to the Hierarchy  (since they have been abundantly instructed with a perfecting science in all matters  relating to their own Hierarchy, and have received the effectual power of instruction),  and to impart sacred gifts according to fitness, since they scientifically and wholly  participate in sacerdotal perfection.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p12"></a>Section V.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p13"></a>The Divine Rank of the Hierarchs, then, is the first of the God-contemplative  Ranks; and it is, at the same time, highest and lowest; inasmuch as every Order  of our Hierarchy is summed up and fulfilled in it. For, as we see every Hierarchy  terminated in the Lord Jesus, so we see each terminated in its own inspired Hierarch.  Now the power of the Hierarchical Rank permeates the whole  <a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 128</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_128"></a> sacred body, and through every one  of the sacred Ranks performs the mysteries of its proper Hierarchy. But, pre-eminently,  to it, rather than to the other Ranks, the Divine institution assigned the more  Divine ministrations. For these are the perfecting images of the supremely Divine  Power, completing all the most Divine symbols and all the sacred orderings. For  though some of the worshipful symbols are consecrated by the Priests, yet never  will the Priest effect the holy Birth in God without the most Divine Muron; nor  will he consecrate the mysteries of the Divine Communion, unless the communicating  symbols have been placed upon the most Divine Altar; and neither will he be Priest  himself, unless he has been elected to this by the Hierarchical consecrations. Hence  the Divine Institution uniquely assigned the dedication of the Hierarchical Ranks,  and the consecration of the Divine Muron and the sacred completion of the Altar,  to the perfecting powers of the inspired Hierarchs.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p14"></a>Section VI.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p15"></a>It is, then, the Hierarchical Rank which, full of the perfecting power, pre-eminently  completes the perfecting functions of the Hierarchy, and reveals lucidly the sciences  of the holy mysteries, and teaches their proportionate and sacred conditions and  powers. But the illuminating Rank of the Priests conducts those, who are being initiated  under the Rank of, the inspired Hierarchs, to the  <a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 129</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_129"></a> Divine visions of the Mystic Rites,  and in co-operation with it, ministers its proper ministrations. Whatever then this  Rank may do, by shewing the works of God, through the most holy symbols, and perfecting  those who draw nigh in the Divine contemplations, and communion of the holy rites,  it yet refers those, who crave the science of the religious services contemplated,  to the Hierarch. And the Rank of the Leitourgoi (which is purifying and separates  the unfit, previous to the approach to the ministrations of the Priests), thoroughly  purifies those who are drawing nigh, by making them entirely pure from opposing  passions, and suitable for the sanctifying vision and communion. Hence, during the  service of the Birth in God, the Leitourgoi strip him who draws nigh of his old  clothing, yea further, even take off his sandals, and make him stand towards the  west for renunciation; and again, they lead him back to the east (for they are of  the purifying rank and power), enjoining on those who approach to entirely cast  away the surroundings of their former life, and shewing the darkness of their former  conduct, and teaching those, who have said farewell to the lightless, to transfer  their allegiance to the luminous. The Leitourgical Order, then, is purifying, by  leading those who have been purified to the bright ministrations of the Priests,  both by thoroughly purifying the uninitiated and by bringing to birth, by the purifying  illuminations and teachings of the Oracles, and further, by sending  <a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 130</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_130"></a>away from the Priests the unholy, without  respect of persons. Wherefore also the Hierarchical institution places it at the  holy gates, suggesting that the approach of those who draw nigh to holy things should  be in altogether complete purification, and entrusting the approach to their reverent  vision and communion to the purifying powers, and admitting them, through these,  without spot.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p16"></a>Section VII.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p17"></a>We have shewn, then, that the Rank of the Hierarchs is consecrating and perfecting,  that of the Priests, illuminating and conducting to the light; and that of the Leitourgoi  purifying and discriminating; that is to say, the Hierarchical Rank is appointed  not only to perfect, but also at the same time, to enlighten and to purify, and has  within itself the purifying sciences of the power of the Priests together with the  illuminating. For the inferior Ranks cannot cross to the superior functions, and,  besides this, it is not permitted to them to take in hand such quackery as that.  Now the more Divine Orders know also, together with their own, the sacred sciences  subordinate to their own perfection. Nevertheless, since the sacerdotal orderings  of the well-arranged and unconfused order of the Divine operations are images of  Divine operations, they were arranged in Hierarchical distinctions, shewing in themselves  the illuminations marshalled into the first, and middle, and last, sacred operations  and Ranks; manifesting, as I said, in themselves the well-ordered and  <a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 131</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_131"></a>unconfused character of the Divine  operations. For since the Godhead first cleanses the minds which He may enter, then  enlightens, and, when enlightened, perfects them to a Godlike perfection; naturally  the Hierarchical of the Divine images divides itself into well-defined Ranks and  powers, shewing clearly the supremely Divine operation firmly established, without  confusion, in most hallowed and unmixed Ranks. But, since we have spoken, as attainable  to us, of the sacerdotal Ranks and elections, and their powers and operations, let  us now contemplate their most holy consecrations as well as we can.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p18"></a><a name="iv.iii.v-p18.1"></a>II. Mysterion of Sacerdotal Consecrations.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p19"></a>The Hierarch, then, being led to the Hierarchical consecration, after he has  bent both his knees before the Altar, has upon his head <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">263</font></a>
   the God-transmitted oracles, and the Hierarchical hand, and in this manner is consecrated  by the Hierarch, who ordains him by the altogether most holy invocations. And the  Priest, after he has bent both his knees before the Divine Altar, has the Hierarchical  right hand upon his head, and in this manner is dedicated by the Hierarch, who ordains  him with hallowing invocations. And the Leitourgos, after he has bent one of two  knees before the Divine Altar, has upon his head the right hand of the Hierarch  who ordains him, being completed by him  <a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 132</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_132"></a>with the initiating invocations of  the Leitourgoi. Upon each of them the cruciform seal is impressed, by the ordaining  Hierarch, and, in each case, a sacred proclamation of name takes place, and a perfecting  salutation, since every sacerdotal person present, and the Hierarch who ordained,  salute him who has been enrolled to any of the aforenamed sacerdotal Ranks.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p20"></a><a name="iv.iii.v-p20.1"></a>III. Contemplation.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p21"></a>Section I.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p22"></a>These things, then, are common both to the Hierarchs, and Priests, and Leitourgoi,  in their sacerdotal consecrations,--the conducting to the Divine Altar and kneeling,--the  imposition of the Hierarchical hand,--the cruciform seal,--the announcement  of name,--the completing salutation.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p23"></a>And special and select for the Hierarchs is the imposition of the Oracles upon  the head, since the subordinate Ranks have not this; and for the Priests the bending  of both knees, since the consecration of the Leitourgoi has not this; for the Leitourgoi,  as has been said, bend the one of two knees only.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p24"></a>Section II.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p25"></a>The conducting then to the Divine Altar, and kneeling, suggests to all those  who are being sacerdotally ordained, that their own life is entirely placed under  God, as source of consecration, and that their  <a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 133</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_133"></a>whole intellectual self, all pure and  hallowed, approaches to Him, and that it is of one likeness, and, as far as possible,  meet for the supremely Divine and altogether most holy, both Victim <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">264</font></a>
  and Altar, which purifies, sacerdotally, the Godlike  Minds.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p26"></a>Section III.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p27"></a>And the imposition of the Hierarchical hand signifies at once the consecrating  protection, by which, as holy children, they are paternally tended, which bequeaths  to them a sacerdotal condition and power, and drives away their adverse powers,  and teaches, at the same time also, to perform the sacerdotal operations, as those  who, having been consecrated, are acting under God, and have Him as Leader of their  own operations in every respect.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p28"></a>Section IV.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p29"></a>And the cruciform seal manifests the inaction of all the impulses of the flesh,  and the God-imitated life looking away unflinchingly to the manly most Divine life  of Jesus, Who came even to Cross and death with a supremely Divine sinlessness,  and stamped those who so live with the cruciform image of His own sinlessness as  of the same likeness.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p30"></a>Section V.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p31"></a>And the Hierarch calls aloud the name of the consecrations and of those consecrated,  the mystery denoting that the God-beloved consecrator is  <a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 134</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_134"></a>manifestor of the supremely Divine  choice,--not of his own accord or by his own favour leading those who are ordained  to the sacerdotal consecration, but being moved by God to all the Hierarchical dedications.  Thus Moses, the consecrator under the Law, does not lead even Aaron, his brother,  to sacerdotal consecration, though thinking him both beloved of God and fit for  the priesthood, until moved by God to this, he in submission to God, Head of consecration,  completed by Hierarchical rites the sacerdotal consecration. But even our supremely  Divine and first Consecrator (for the most philanthropic Jesus, for our sake, became  even this), did "not glorify Himself," as the Logia say, but He Who said to Him,  "Thou art Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek." Wherefore also whilst  Himself leading the disciples to sacerdotal consecration, although being as God  chief Consecrator, nevertheless He refers the Hierarchical completion of the work  of consecration to His altogether most Holy Father, and the supremely Divine Spirit,  by admonishing the disciples, as the Oracles say, not to depart from Jerusalem,  but to "await the promise of the Father, which ye heard of Me, that ye shall be  baptized in Holy Ghost." And indeed, the Coryphaeus of the disciples himself, with  the ten, of the same rank and Hierarchy with himself, when he proceeded to the sacerdotal  consecration of the twelfth of the disciples, piously left the selection to  <a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 135</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_135"></a>the Godhead,  saying, "Shew <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">265</font></a>
  whom Thou hast chosen," and received him, who was  divinely designated by the Divine lot, into the Hierarchical number of the sacred  twelve. Now concerning the Divine lot, which fell as a Divine intimation upon Matthias,  others have expressed another view, not clearly, as I think, but I will express  my own sentiment. For it seems to me that the Oracles name "lot " a certain supremely  Divine gift, pointing out to that Hierarchical Choir him who was designated by the  Divine election; more particularly, because the Divine Hierarch must not perform  the sacerdotal acts of his own motion, but, under God, moving him to do them as  prescribed by the Hierarchy and Heaven.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p32"></a>Section VI.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p33"></a>Now the salutation, for the completion of the sacerdotal consecration, has a  religious significance. For all the members of the sacerdotal Ranks present, as  well as the Hierarch himself who has consecrated them, salute the ordained. For  when, by sacerdotal habits and powers, and by Divine call and dedication, a religious  mind has attained to sacerdotal completion, he is dearly loved by the most holy  Orders of the same rank, being conducted to a most Godlike comeliness, loving the  minds similar to himself, and religiously loved by them in return. Hence it is that  the mutual sacerdotal salutation is religiously performed, proclaiming the religious  <a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_136"></a>communion of minds of like character,  and their loveable benignity towards each other, as keeping, throughout, by sacerdotal  training, their most Godlike comeliness.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p34"></a>Section VII</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p35"></a>These things, as I said, are common to the whole sacerdotal consecration. The  Hierarch, however, as a distinctive mark, has the Oracles most reverently placed  upon his head. For since the perfecting power and science of the whole Priesthood  is bequeathed to the inspired Hierarchs, by the supremely Divine and perfecting  goodness, naturally are placed upon the heads of the Hierarchs the Divinely transmitted  Oracles, which set forth comprehensively and scientifically every teaching of God,  work of God, manifestation of God, sacred word, sacred work, in one word, all the  Divine and sacred works and words bequeathed to our Hierarchy by the beneficent  Godhead; since the Godlike Hierarch, having participated entirely in the whole Hierarchical  power, will not only be illuminated, in the true and God-transmitted science of  all the sacred words and works committed to the Hierarchy, but will also transmit  them to others in Hierarchical proportions, and will perfect Hierarchically in most  Divine kinds of knowledge and the highest mystical, instructions, all the most perfecting  functions of the whole Hierarchy. And the distinctive feature of the ordination  of Priests, as contrasted with the ordering  <a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 137</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_137"></a> of the Leitourgoi, is the bending of  the two knees, as that bends only the one, and is ordained in this Hierarchical  fashion.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v-p36"></a>Section VIII.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p37"></a>The bending then denotes the subordinate introduction of the conductor, who places  under God that which is reverently introduced. And since, as we have often said,  the three Orders of the consecrators, through the three most holy Mystic Rites and  powers, preside over the three ranks of those initiated, and minister their saving  introduction under the Divine yokes, naturally the order of Leitourgoi as only purifying,  ministers the one introduction of those who are being purified, by placing it under  the Divine Altar, since in it the minds being purified, are supermundanely hallowed.  And the Priests bend both their knees, since those who are religiously brought nigh  by them have not only been purified, but have been ministerially perfected into  a contemplative habit and power of a life thoroughly cleansed by their most luminous,  ministrations through instruction. And the Hierarchy bending both his knees, has  upon his head the God-transmitted Oracles, leading, through his office of Hierarch,  those who have been purified by the Leitourgic power, and enlightened by the ministerial,  to the science of the holy things contemplated by them in proportion to their capacities,  and through this science perfecting those who are brought nigh, into the most complete  holiness of which they are capable.  <a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_138"></a></p>
