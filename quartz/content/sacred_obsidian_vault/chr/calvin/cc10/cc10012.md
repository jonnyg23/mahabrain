 <p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN17"><a name="xiii-p1"></a>PSALM 78</p>  		
 <p><a name="xiii-p2"></a>To comprehend many things within small compass, it is to be observed, that in this psalm there are two leading topics. On the one hand, it is declared how God adopted for himself a Church from the posterity of Abraham, how tenderly and graciously he cherished it, how wonderfully he brought it out of Egypt, and how varied were the blessings which he bestowed upon it. On the other hand, the Jews, who were so much indebted to him for the great 		  blessings which he had conferred upon them, are upbraided for having from time to time perversely and treacherously revolted from so liberal a father; so that his inestimable goodness was clearly manifested, not only in his free adoption of them at first, but also in continuing by the uninterrupted course of his goodness to strive against the rebellion of so perfidious and stiff-necked a people. Moreover, mention is made of the renewal of God’s grace, and as it were of a second election which 		  he made when he chose David out of the tribe of Judah to sway the scepter over the kingdom of Israel.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.i-p6"></a><b>1.</b><i> Give ear, O my people! to my law.</i> From the close of the psalm, it may with probability be conjectured, that it was written long after the death of David; for there we have celebrated the kingdom erected by God in the family of David. There also the tribe of Ephraim, which is said to have been rejected, is 			 contrasted with, and set in opposition to, the house of David. From this it is evident, that the ten tribes were at that time in a state of separation from the rest of the chosen people; for there must be some good reason why the kingdom of Ephraim is branded with a mark of dishonor as being illegitimate and bastard.   			  <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_307"><font size="1">308</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p8"></a>Whoever was the inspired writer of this psalm, he does not introduce God speaking as is thought by some, but he himself addresses the Jews in the character of a teacher. It is no objection to this that he calls the people <i>his people, </i>and the law <i>his law; </i>it being no uncommon thing for the prophets to borrow the name of Him by 			 whom they were sent, that their doctrine might have the greater authority. And, indeed, the truth which has been committed to their trust may, with propriety, be called <i>theirs. </i>Thus Paul, in <a name="xiii.i-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016">Ro 2:16</a><a name="xiii.i-p8.1"></a>, glories in the gospel as <i>his gospel, </i>an expression not to be understood as implying that 			 it was a system which owed its origin to him, but that he was a preacher and a witness of it. I am somewhat doubtful whether interpreters are strictly correct in translating the word <a name="xiii.i-p8.2"></a>תורה<i>, torah, </i>by law.   			  <a name="fr_308"></a><a href="#fn_308"><font size="1">309</font></a>
  			  The meaning of it seems to be somewhat more general, as appears from the following clause, where the Psalmist uses the phrase,<i> the words of my mouth,</i> in the same sense. If we consider with what inattention even those who make great professions of being the disciples of God listen to his voice, we will admit that the prophet had good reason for 			 introducing his lessons of instruction by a solemn call of attention. He does not, it is true, address the unteachable and obstinate, who frowardly refuse to submit themselves to the word of God; but as even true believers themselves are generally too backward to receive instruction, this exhortation, so far from being superfluous, was highly necessary to stir up the sluggish and inactive among them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p10"></a>To secure for himself the greater attention, he declares it to be his purpose to discuss subjects of a great, high, and difficult character. The word <a name="xiii.i-p10.1"></a>משל, <i>mashal, </i>which I have translated <i>a parable, </i>denotes grave and 			 striking sentences, such as adages, or proverbs, and apophthegms.   			  <a name="fr_309"></a><a href="#fn_309"><font size="1">310</font></a>
  			  As then the matter itself of which we treat, if it is weighty and important, awakens the minds of men, the inspired penman affirms that it is his purpose to utter only striking sentences and notable sayings. The word <a name="xiii.i-p11.2"></a>חידות, <i>chidoth, </i>which, following others, I have rendered <i>enigmas, 			 </i>is here used, not so much for dark sentences, as for sayings which are pointed and worthy of special notice.   			  <a name="fr_310"></a><a href="#fn_310"><font size="1">311</font></a>
  			  He does not mean to wrap up his song in ambiguous language, but clearly and distinctly to dwell both upon the benefits of God and the ingratitude of the people. Only, as I have said, his design is to stimulate his readers to weigh and consider more attentively the subject propounded. This passage is quoted by Matthew, (<a name="xiii.i-p14.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#035">Mt 13:35</a><a name="xiii.i-p14.8"></a>,) and applied to the 			 person of Christ, when he held the minds of the people in suspense by parables which they could not understand. Christ’s object in doing so, was to prove that he was a distinguished prophet of God, and that thus he might be received with the greater reverence. Since he then resembled a prophet because he preached sublime mysteries in a style of language above the common kind, that which the sacred writer here affirms concerning himself, is with propriety transferred to him. If in this psalm 			 there shines forth such a majesty as may justly stir up and inflame the readers with a desire to learn, we gather from it with what earnest attention it becomes us to receive the gospel, in which Christ opens and displays to us the treasures of his celestial wisdom.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.i-p15"></a><a name="xiii.i-p15.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p16"></a><b>3.</b><i> What we have heard and known.</i> There seems to be some discrepancy between what the Psalmist had stated in the commencement, when he said that he would speak of great and hidden matters, and what he now adds, that his subject is a common one, and such as is transmitted from one age to another by the father to 			 the son. If it was incumbent upon the fathers to recount to their children the things here spoken of, these things ought, of course, to have been familiarly known to all the people, yea, even to those who were most illiterate, and had the weakest capacity. Where, then, it may be said, are the enigmas or dark sentences of which he has just now made mention? I answer, that these things can easily be reconciled; for although the psalm contains many things which are generally known, yet he 			 illustrates them with all the splendor and ornaments of diction, that he may the more powerfully affect the hearts of men, and acquire for himself the greater authority. At the same time, it is to be observed, that however high may be the majesty of the Word of God, this does not prevent the benefits or advantages of it from reaching even to the unlearned and to babes. The Holy Spirit does not in vain invite and encourage such to learn from it: — a truth which we ought carefully to mark. If 			 God, accommodating himself to the limited capacity of men, speaks in an humble and lowly style, this manner of teaching is despised as too simple; but if he rise to a higher style, with the view of giving greater authority to his Word, men, to excuse their ignorance, will pretend that it is too obscure. As these two vices are very prevalent in the world, the Holy Spirit so tempers his style as that the sublimity of the truths which he teaches is not hidden even from those of the weakest 			 capacity, provided they are of a submissive and teachable disposition, and bring with them an earnest desire to be instructed. It is the design of the prophet to remove from the mind all doubt respecting his sayings, and for this purpose, he determines to bring forward nothing new, but such subjects as had been long well known, and received without dispute in the Church. He accordingly not only says <i>we have heard, </i>but also <i>we have known. </i>Many things are rashly spread abroad which have no foundation in truth; yea, nothing is more common than for the ears of men to be filled with fables. It is, therefore, not without cause that the prophet, after having spoken of the things which he had heard, at the same time, refers in confirmation of their truth to undoubted testimony. He adds, that the knowledge of these subjects 			 had been communicated to the Jews by <i>their fathers. </i>This does not imply, that what is taught under the domestic roof is always faultless; but it is obvious, that there is afforded a more favorable opportunity of palming upon men forgeries for truth, when things are brought from a distant country. What is to be principally observed is, that all fathers are not here spoken of indiscriminately, but only those who were chosen to be God’s peculiar 			 people, and to whom the care of divine truth was intrusted.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.i-p17"></a><a name="xiii.i-p17.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p18"></a><b>4.</b> <i>We will not conceal them from their children in the generation to come.</i> Some take the verb <a name="xiii.i-p18.1"></a>נכחד, <i>nechached, </i>in the <i>nephil </i>conjugation, and translate it, <i>they are not concealed or hidden. </i>But it ought, according to the rules of grammar, to be resolved thus: — <i>We</i> <i>will not conceal them from our posterity, </i>implying, that what we have been taught by our ancestors we should endeavor to transmit to their children. By this means, 			 all pretense of ignorance is removed; for it was the will of God that these things should be published from age to age without interruption; so that being transmitted from father to child in each family, they might reach even the last family of man. The end for which this was to be done is shown — that <i>they might celebrate the praises of Jehovah, in the wonderful works which he hath done</i></p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.i-p19"></a><a name="xiii.i-p19.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p20"></a><b>5.</b> <i>He established a testimony in Jacob.</i>   			  <a name="fr_311"></a><a href="#fn_311"><font size="1">312</font></a>
  			  As the reception or approbation of any doctrine by men would not be a sufficient reason for yielding a firm assent to its truth, the prophet proceeds farther, and represents God as the author of what he brings forward. He declares, that the father’s were not led to instruct their children in these truths under the mere impulse of their own minds, but by the commandment of God. Some understand the words, <i>He hath established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel,</i> as implying that God had established a decree in Jacob, to be observed as an inviolable rule, which was, that the deliverance divinely wrought for the people should be at all times in the mouth of every Israelite; but this seems to give too restricted a sense. I therefore consider <i>statute, </i>or <i>testimony, </i>and <i>law,</i>   			  <a name="fr_312"></a><a href="#fn_312"><font size="1">313</font></a>
  			  as referring to the written law, which, however, was partly given for this end, that by the remembrance of their deliverance, the people, after having been once gathered into one body, might be kept in their allegiance to God. The meaning then is, that God not only acquired a right to the Jews as his people by his mighty power, but that he also sealed up his grace, that the knowledge of it might never be obliterated. And, undoubtedly, it was 			 then registered as it were in public records, when the covenant was ratified by the written law, in order to assure the posterity of Abraham that they had been separated from all other nations. It would have been a matter of very small importance to have been acquainted with, or to have remembered the bare history of what had been done, had their eyes not been, at the same time, directed to the free adoption and the fruit of it. The decree then is this, That the fathers being instructed in the 			 doctrine of the law themselves, should recount, as it were, from the mouth of God, to their children, that they had been not only once delivered, but also gathered into one body as his Church, that throughout all ages they might yield a holy and pure obedience to him as their deliverer. The reading of the beginning of the second clause of the verse properly is, <i>Which he commanded, etc. </i>But the relative <a name="xiii.i-p22.1"></a>אשר<i>, asher, which, </i>I have no doubt, is here put by way of exposition for <i>namely, </i>or<i> that is, he commanded, </i>etc. I have translated it <i>for, </i>which amounts to the same thing.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.i-p23"></a><a name="xiii.i-p23.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p24"></a><b>6.</b> <i>That the generation to come might know them.</i> In this verse, the Psalmist confirms what he had said concerning the continued transmission of divine truth. It greatly concerns us to know, that the law was given not for one age only; but that the fathers should transmit it to their 			 children, as if it were their rightful inheritance, in order that it might never be lost, but be preserved to the end of the world. This is the reason why Paul, in <a name="xiii.i-p24.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015">1Ti 3:15</a><a name="xiii.i-p24.1"></a>, asserts that “the Church is the pillar and ground of the truth;” by which he does not mean that the truth of itself is weak, and stands in need of foreign supports, but that God extends and diffuses it by 			 the instrumentality of his ministers, who when they faithfully execute the office of teaching with which they are invested, sustain the truth, as it were, upon their shoulders. Now, the prophet teaches us, that it is our bounden duty to use our endeavors that there may be a continual succession of persons to communicate instruction in divine truth. It is said of Abraham before the law was written, <a name="xiii.i-p24.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019">Ge 18:19</a><a name="xiii.i-p24.2"></a>,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xiii.i-p25"></a>“I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment;”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p26"></a>and after his death, this was enjoined upon the patriarchs as a necessary part of their duty. No sooner was the law delivered, than God appointed priests in his Church to be public masters and teachers. He has also testified by the prophet Isaiah, that the same is to be observed under the New Testament dispensation, saying,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xiii.i-p27"></a>“My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, from henceforth and for ever.” (<a name="xiii.i-p27.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021">Isa 59:21</a><a name="xiii.i-p27.1"></a>)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p28"></a>In the passage before us, however, a particular injunction is given to the fathers on this point — each of them is enjoined diligently to instruct his own children, and all without distinction are taught, that their exertions in transmitting the name of God to their posterity will be most acceptable to Him, and receive his highest approbation. By the words, <i>That the 			 children to be born should arise,</i> is not denoted a small number of individuals; but it is intimated, that the preachers of divine truth, by whose efforts pure religion may flourish and prevail for ever, will be as numerous as those who are born into the world.</p>  <a name="xiii.ii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption20"><a name="xiii.ii-p1"></a><a name="xiii.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#007">Psalm 78:7-11</a><a name="xiii.ii-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p2"></a><b>7.</b> That they might set their hope   				   <a name="fr_313"></a><a href="#fn_313"><font size="1">314</font></a>
  				   in God, and not forget the works of God; but keep his commandments. <b>8.</b> And that they might not be as their fathers, a rebellious [or an apostatising] and a provoking generation; a generation which directed not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not faithful towards God. <b>9.</b> The children of Ephraim, being armed and shooting with the bow, turned back in the day 				  of battle. <b>10.</b> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law. <b>11.</b> And they forgat his works, and the wonders which he had shown them.</p> 				  			   		    		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p4"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ii-p5"></a><a name="xiii.ii-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p6"></a><b>7.</b> <i>That they might set their hope in God.</i> Here the Psalmist points out the use to which the doctrine which he had stated should be applied. In the first place, the fathers, when they find that on the one hand they are instrumental in maintaining the pure worship of God, and that on the 			 other, they are the means of providing for the salvation of their children, should, by such a precious result of their labors, be the more powerfully stirred up to instruct their children. In the second place, the children on their part, being inflamed with greater zeal, should eagerly press forward in the acquisition of divine knowledge, and not suffer their minds to wander in vain speculations, but should aim at, or keep their eyes directed to, the right mark. It is unhappy and wretched toil 			 to be</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xiii.ii-p7"></a>“ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of <br> 			 the truth,” (<a name="xiii.ii-p7.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#007">2Ti 3:7</a><a name="xiii.ii-p7.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p8"></a>When, therefore, we hear for what purpose the law was given, we may easily learn what is the true and most successful method of deriving benefit from it. The inspired writer places <i>trust </i>first, assigning it the highest rank. He then requires the observance of the holy commandments of God; and he puts in the middle the remembrance of the works of God, which serves to confirm and strengthen faith. In short, what he means is, that the sum 			 of heavenly wisdom consists in this, that men, having their hearts fixed on God by a true and unfeigned faith, call upon him, and that, for the purpose of maintaining and cherishing their confidence in him, they exercise themselves in meditating in good earnest upon his benefits; and that then they yield to him an unfeigned and devoted obedience. We may learn from this, that the true service of God begins with faith. If we transfer our trust and confidence to any other object, we defraud him of 			 the chief part of his honor.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ii-p9"></a><a name="xiii.ii-p9.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p10"></a><b>8.</b> <i>And that they might not be as their fathers, a rebellious and provoking generation.</i> The Psalmist here shows still more distinctly how necessary this sermon was, from the circumstance that the Jews were exceedingly prone to revolt from God, if they were not kept in subjection by 			 powerful restraints. He takes it as a fact, which could not be questioned, that their hearts were in no respect better than the hearts of their fathers, whom he affirms to have been a treacherous, rebellious, crooked and disobedient race. They would, therefore, immediately backslide from the way of God, unless their hearts were continually sustained by stable supports. The experience of all ages shows that what Horace writes concerning his own nation is true every where: —</p>  		  
 <p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent30"><a name="xiii.ii-p11"></a><i>“</i><a name="xiii.ii-p11.1"></a><i>Ætas parenturn, pejor avis, tulit <br> 			 Nos nequiores, mox daturos <br> 			 Progeniem vitiosiroem</i><i>.” <br> 			 </i>Odes, <i>Book III. Ode vi.</i></p>  		  
 <p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent31"><a name="xiii.ii-p12"></a><i>“The age that gave our fathers birth, <br> 			 Saw them their noble sires disgrace: <br> 			 We, baser still, shall leave on earth <br> 			 The still increasing guilt of our degenerate race.” <br> 			 </i>Boscawen’Translation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p13"></a>What then would be the consequence, did not God succor the world which thus proceeds from evil to worse? As the prophet teaches the Jews from the wickedness and perverseness of their fathers, that they stood in need of a severe discipline to recall them from the imitation of bad examples, we learn from this, how great the folly of the world is, in persuading itself that the example of the fathers is to be regarded as 			 equivalent to a law, which ought, in every case, to be followed. He does not here speak of all people without distinction, but of the holy and chosen race of Abraham; nor does he rebuke a small number of persons, but almost the whole nation, among whom there prevailed excessive obstinacy, as well as perverse forgetfulness of the grace of God, and perfidious dissimulation. He does not mention merely the fathers of one age, but he comprehends a period stretching back into a remote antiquity, that 			 persons may not take occasion to excuse themselves in committing sin, from the length of time during which it has prevailed. We must therefore make a wise selection from amongst the fathers of those whom it becomes us to imitate. It being a work of great difficulty to remove the disposition to this perverse imitation of the fathers, towards whom the feeling of reverence is naturally impressed on the minds of their successors, the prophet employs a multiplicity of terms to set forth the 			 aggravated wickedness of the fathers, stigmatising them as chargeable with apostasy, provocation, treachery, and hypocrisy. These are very weighty charges; but it will be evident from the sequel that they are not exaggerated. The word <a name="xiii.ii-p13.1"></a>הכין<i>, hechin, </i>which I have rendered <i>directed, </i>is by some translated <i>established, </i>but in my opinion, the meaning rather is, that God’s ancient people always turned aside from God into crooked by-paths. Also, in what follows, instead of reading <i>whose spirit was not faithful towards God, </i>some read <i>whose spirit leaned not upon God.</i>   			  <a name="fr_314"></a><a href="#fn_314"><font size="1">315</font></a>
  			  But it is better to follow the former interpretation, That they were not faithfully and steadfastly devoted to God, although they had solemnly sworn allegiance to him. The Papists make use of this passage as an argument to prove that man has the power of bending his own heart, and directing it either to good or evil as he pleases; but this is an inference from it which cannot stand examination for a single moment. Although the prophet justly 			 blames those who have not directed their heart aright, his object is not expressly to speak of what men can do of themselves. It is the special work of God to turn to himself the hearts of men by the secret influence of his Holy Spirit. It does not however follow from this, that they will be exempted from blame, when their own lust and depravity draw them away from God. Moreover, from the sins which are here reproved, we should learn in what way he would have us to obey and serve him. In the 			 first place, we must lay aside all obstinacy and take his yoke upon us;   			  <a name="fr_315"></a><a href="#fn_315"><font size="1">316</font></a>
  			  and, secondly, we must clothe ourselves with the spirit of meekness, bring the affections of the heart to the obedience of God, and follow after uprightness, and that not with the fervor of a mere transient impulse, but with unfeigned and unwavering steadfastness.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ii-p16"></a><a name="xiii.ii-p16.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p17"></a><b>9.</b> <i>The children of Ephraim being armed, and shooting with the bow. </i>The sacred writer sets before us an example of this unfaithfulness in the children of Ephraim. As those who are pertinaciously set upon doing evil are not easily led to repentance and reformation by simple instruction, the punishments with 			 which God visited the children of Ephraim are brought forward, and by these it is proved that they were reprobates. Since they were a warlike people, it was an evidence of the divine displeasure for them to turn their backs in battle. And it is expressly declared, that they were skillful <i>in</i> <i>shooting with the bow;</i>   			  <a name="fr_316"></a><a href="#fn_316"><font size="1">317</font></a>
  			  for it is an additional stigma to represent such as were armed with weapons to wound their enemies at a distance as fleeing through fear. From this, it is the more abundantly manifest that they had incurred the displeasure of God, who not only deprived them of his aid, but also made their hearts effeminate in the hour of danger.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p19"></a>Here the question may be raised, Why the children of Ephraim only are blamed, when we find a little before, all the tribes in general comprehended in the same sentence of condemnation? Some commentators refer this to the slaughter of the sons of Ephraim by the men of Gath, who came forth against them to recover their cattle of which they had been despoiled, 			 <a name="xiii.ii-p19.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#020">1 Chr. 7:20</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#021">21</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#022">22</a><a name="xiii.ii-p19.1"></a>.  			  <a name="fr_317"></a><a href="#fn_317"><font size="1">318</font></a>
  			 But this exposition is too restricted. Perhaps the kingdom of Israel had fallen into decay, and had been almost ruined when this psalm was composed. It is therefore better to follow the opinion of other interpreters, who think, that by the figure synecdoche, the children of Ephraim are put for the whole people. But these interpreters pass over without consideration the fact, which ought not to be overlooked, that the Ephraimites are purposely named because they were the means of 			 leading others into that rebellion which took place when Jeroboam set up the calves, (<a name="xiii.ii-p20.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#025">1Ki 12:25-33</a><a name="xiii.ii-p20.4"></a>.) What we have already said must be borne in mind, that towards the close of the psalm, the rejection of the tribe of Ephraim is, not, without cause, contrasted with the election of the tribe of Judah. The children of Ephraim are also here spoken of by way of comparison, to warn the true children of 			 Abraham from the example of those who cut themselves off from the Church, and yet boasted of the title of the Church without exhibiting holy fruits in their life.  			  <a name="fr_318"></a><a href="#fn_318"><font size="1">319</font></a>
  			 As they surpassed all the other tribes in number and wealth, their influence was too powerful in beguiling the simple; but of this the prophet now strips them, showing that they were deprived of the aid of God.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p23"></a><b>10.</b> <i>They kept not the covenant of God.</i> This is the reason assigned for the Ephraimites turning their backs in the day of battle; and it explains why the divine assistance was withheld from them. Others, it is true, were guilty in this respect as well as they, but the vengeance of God 			 executed on that tribe, which by its influence had corrupted almost the whole kingdom, is purposely brought forward as a general warning. Since then the tribe of Ephraim, in consequence of its splendor and dignity, when it threw off the yoke, encouraged and became as it were a standard of shameful revolt to all the other tribes, the prophet intended to put people on their guard, that they might not suffer themselves in their simplicity to be again deceived in the same manner. It is no light 			 charge which he brings against the sons of Ephraim: he upbraids them on account of their perfidiousness in despising the whole law and in violating the covenant. Although he employs these two words, <i>law </i>and <i>covenant, </i>in the same sense; yet, in placing <i>the covenant </i>first, he clearly shows that he is speaking not only of the moral law, the 			 all-perfect rule of life, but of the whole service of God, of the truth and faithfulness of the divine promises, and of the trust which ought to be reposed in them,   			  <a name="fr_319"></a><a href="#fn_319"><font size="1">320</font></a>
  			  of invocation, and of the doctrine of true religion, the foundation whereof was the adoption. He therefore calls them covenant-breakers, because they had fallen from their trust in the promises, by which God had entered into covenant with them to be their Father. Yet he afterwards very properly adds <i>the law, </i>in which the covenant was sealed up, as it were, in public records. He aggravates the enormity of their guilt 			 by the word <i>refuse, </i>which intimates that they were not simply carried away by a kind of thoughtless or inconsiderate recklessness, and thus sinned through giddiness, want of knowledge or foresight, but that they had purposely, and with deliberate obstinacy, violated the holy covenant of God.</p>

  			  for the Israelites to depart from God, to whom they were under so many and strong obligations. Nor would it have been possible for them to have been so bewitched by Satan, had they not quite forgotten the many miracles wrought in their behalf, which formed so many bonds to keep them in the fear of God and in obedience to him. That no excuse might be left for extenuating their guilt, the prophet ennobles those works by applying to them the term <i>wonderful, </i>thereby intimating, that God’s manner of acting was not of a common kind, so as easily to account for their gradually forgetting his works, but that the Israelites had perversely and wickedly shut their eyes, that they might not be restrained in their sinful course, by beholding the glory of God.</p>  <a name="xiii.iii"></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p6"></a><b>12.</b> <i>He wrought marvellously in the sight of their fathers.</i> The Psalmist is still to be regarded as condemning the posterity of the Israelites for their guilt; but he very properly, at the same time, begins to speak of the first ancestors of the nation, intimating, that the whole race 			 of them, even from their first original, were of a perverse and rebellious disposition. But having remarked that the children of Ephraim had fallen into apostasy, because they had forgotten the wonderful works of God, he continues to prosecute the same subject. Meanwhile, as I have said, he makes a very happy transition to speak of the fathers, whom it was his object to include in the same condemnation. In the first place, he adverts to the miracles which were wrought in the midst of the land 			 of Egypt, previous to the departure of the people from it. To recall these the more vividly to the mind, he names a place which was highly celebrated — <i>the field of Zoan.</i> He next comes to speak of the passage through the sea, where he repeats what was brought under our notice in the previous psalm, that the order of nature was reversed when the waters stopped in their course, and 			 were even raised up into solid heaps like mountains. In the third place, he declares, that after the people had passed through the Red Sea, God still continued to be their guide in their journey; and that this might not be a mere temporary deliverance, he graciously continued to stretch forth his hand to bestow upon them new testimonies of his goodness. It being a difficult and wearisome thing for them to pursue their journey through dry and sandy regions, it was no ordinary blessing to be 			 protected from the heat of the sun by the intervention of a cloud. This, however, was to them a pledge of more distinguished grace. God hereby testified, that this people were under his protection, until they should reach the heavenly inheritance. Accordingly, Paul teaches in <a name="xiii.iii-p6.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#002">1Co 10:2</a><a name="xiii.iii-p6.1"></a>, that there was a kind of baptism administered to the people in that cloud, as also in 			 their passing through the sea; the fruit of which is not limited to this frail and transitory life, but extends even to everlasting salvation.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p8"></a><b>15.</b> <i>He clave the rocks in the wilderness.</i> The Psalmist produces another evidence of the fatherly love by which God testified the greatness of the care which he exercised about the welfare of this people. It is not simply said that God gave them drink, but that he did this in a 			 miraculous manner. Streams, it is true, sometimes issue from rocks, but the rock which Moses smote was completely dry. Whence it is evident, that the water was not brought forth from any spring, but that it was made to flow from the profoundest deeps, as if it had been said, from the very center of the earth. Those, therefore, who have interpreted this passage as meaning, that the Israelites drank in the bottomless deeps, because the waters flowed in great abundance, have failed in giving the 			 true explanation. Moses, in his history of the miracle, rather enhances its greatness, by intimating, that God commanded those waters to come gushing from the remotest veins.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p9"></a>The same truth is confirmed in the following verse, in which it is stated, that where there had not been a single drop of water before there was a large and mighty river. Had there only sprung out of the rock a small rivulet, ungodly men might have had some apparent ground for cavilling at, and underrating the goodness of God, but when the water gushed out in such copious abundance all on a sudden, who does not see that the ordinary course 			 of nature was changed, rather than that some vein or spring which lay hidden in the earth was opened?</p>  <a name="xiii.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p7"></a><b>17.</b><i> Yet they continued still to sin against him.</i> The prophet, having briefly declared how God, by a continual succession of benefits, had clearly manifested the greatness of his love towards the children of Abraham, now adds, that after having been laid under such deep and solemn obligations to him, they, as 			 was natural to them, and according to their customary way, wickedly rebelled against him. In the first place, he accuses them of having provoked him grievously, by pertinaciously adding iniquity to iniquity; and then he points out the particular kind of the provocation with which they were chargeable. By the word <i>provoke, </i>he intimates, that it was no light offense which they had committed, but wickedness so heinous and aggravated as not to be 			 endured. From the place in which it was committed, he aggravates the enormity of the sin. It was in the very wilderness, whilst the remembrance of their deliverance was yet fresh in their memory, and where they had every day full in their view tokens of the presence of God, and where even necessity itself should have constrained them to yield a true and holy obedience — it was in that place, and under these circumstances, that they repressed not their insolence and unbridled 			 appetite.   			  <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_324"><font size="1">325</font></a>
  			  It was then, certainly, a proof of monstrous infatuation for them to act in such a wanton and disgraceful manner as they did, at the very time when their want of all things should have proved the best remedy for keeping them under restraint, and to do this even in the presence of God, who presented before them such manifestations of his glory as filled them with terror, and who allured them so kindly and tenderly to himself.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.iv-p9"></a><a name="xiii.iv-p9.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p10"></a><b>18.</b> <i>And they tempted God in their heart.</i> This is the provocation of which mention is made in the preceding verse. Not that it was unlawful for them simply to ask food, when constrained to do so by the cravings of hunger. Who can impute blame to persons, when being hungry, they implore 			 God to supply their necessities? The sin with which the Israelites were chargeable consisted in this, that not content with the food which He had appointed them, they gave loose reins to their lusts. He, at that time, had begun to feed them with manna, as we shall again see by and by. It was their loathing of that sustenance which impelled them eagerly to desire new food, as if they disdained the allowance assigned them by their heavenly Father. This is what is meant when it is said that 			 <i>they asked food for their soul</i>    			  <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_325"><font size="1">326</font></a>
  			  They were not reduced to the necessity of asking it by hunger; but their lust was not satisfied with living on the provision which God had appointed for them. On this account, it is declared, that <i>they tempted God,</i> overpassing, as they did, the bounds within which he had limited them. Whoever, undervaluing and despising the 			 permission or license which He grants, gives full scope to his own intemperate lust, and desires more than is lawful, is said to tempt God. He acts as if he would subject Him to his own caprice, or questioned whether He could do more than he is pleased really to do. God has power to accomplish whatever he wills; and assuredly, the person who would separate the power of God from his will, or represent him as unable to do what he wills, does all he can to rend him in pieces. Those are chargeable 			 with doing this, who are set upon trying whether he will grant more than he has given them permission to ask. That, therefore, the lust of the flesh may not stir us up to tempt him, let us learn to impose a restraint upon our desires, and humbly to rest contented within the limits which are prescribed to us. If the flesh is allowed to indulge itself without control, we will not be satisfied with ordinary bread, but will often, and in many ways, murmur against God.</p>

  			  and now he adds, that they were not ashamed openly to utter with their impure and blasphemous tongues, the impiety which they had inwardly conceived. From this, it is the more abundantly manifest that malignity and wickedness had taken entire possession of their hearts. Thus we see how lust conceives sin, when it is admitted into the soul with unhallowed consent. Afterwards the sin develops itself farther, even as we see the Israelites 			 proceeding to such a length of profane wantonness, as to call in question the power of God, as if they made no account of it, any farther than as it ministered to their lust. By the <i>table prepared </i>which is spoken of, is to be understood the dainty food, which was their ordinary fare in Egypt. A single dish did not satisfy their appetite. They were not contented unless they could gratify themselves with great abundance and variety. When it is 			 said in the following verse, <i>Behold! God smote the rock, and the waters gushed out, etc</i>., this, I have no doubt, is the language of bitter irony, with which the prophet taunts their unblushing insolence. It is not very likely that they spake in this manner; but he relates, as it were, with their mouth, or in their person, the things which took place before their eyes.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.iv-p15"></a><a name="xiii.iv-p15.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p16"></a><b>21.</b><i> Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth.</i> This hearing of God implies full and perfect knowledge; and it is a figure taken from earthly judges, who cannot punish criminals until they have become thoroughly acquainted with the cause. He is said to hear his own people, when he shows his favor and mercy 			 towards them by granting their requests; and, on the other hand, he is said to hear those blasphemies which he does not allow to pass unpunished. To remove all ground for thinking that the divine wrath was unduly severe, the enormity of the guilt of the Israelites is again described as manifested in this, that<i> they believed not God, nor trusted in his salvation.</i> It is here taken 			 as an indisputable point, that promises were made to them to which they ought to have yielded an assent, which, however, they were prevented from yielding by the extreme infatuation with which they were carried away. <i>To trust in the salvation of God,</i> is to lean upon his fatherly providence, and to regard him as sufficient for the supply of all our wants. 			 From this we learn not only how hateful unbelief is in the sight of God, but also, what is the true nature of faith, and what are the fruits which it produces. Whence is it that men quietly submit themselves to Him, but because they are persuaded that their salvation is singularly precious in his sight, and are fully assured that he will give them whatever is needful for them? It is thus that they are led to surrender themselves to him, to be governed according to his good pleasure. Faith, 			 then, is the root of true piety. It teaches us to hope for, and to desire every blessing from God, and it frames us to yield obedience to him; while those who distrust him must necessarily be always murmuring and rebelling against him. The scope of the prophet is this, that the pretences to faith which are made by those who do not hope for salvation from God, rest upon false grounds; for when God is believed in, the hope of salvation is speedily produced in the mind, and this hope renders to 			 him the praise of every blessing.</p>  <a name="xiii.v"></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.v-p6"></a><b>23.</b><i> But he had commanded the clouds from above.</i> It is a mistake to suppose that this miracle is related merely in the way of history. The prophet rather censures the Israelites the more severely from the consideration, that although fed to the full with manna, they ceased not to lust after the dainties which they 			 knew God had denied them. It was the basest ingratitude to scorn and reject the heavenly food, which, so to speak, associated them with angels. Were a man who dwells in France or Italy to grieve and fret that he has not the bread of Egypt to eat, nor the wine of Asia to drink, would he not make war against God and nature, after the manner of the giants of old? Much less excusable was the inordinate lust of the Israelites, whom God not only furnished with earthly provision in rich abundance, but 			 to whom he also gave the bread of heaven for their support. Had they even endured hunger for a lengthened period, propriety and duty would have required them to ask food with more humility. Had they been supplied with only bran and chaff to eat, it would have been their bounden duty to have acknowledged that in the place where they were — in the wilderness — this was no ordinary boon of Heaven. Had only coarse bread been granted them, they would have had sufficient reason for thanksgiving. But 			 how much stronger were their obligations to God, when he created a new kind of food, with which, by stretching out, as it were, his hand from heaven, he supplied them richly and in great abundance? This is the reason why the manna is called <i>corn of heaven, </i>and <i>bread of the mighty</i> Some explain the Hebrew word <a name="xiii.v-p6.1"></a>אבירים<i>, abbirim, </i>as denoting <i>the heavens,</i>   			  <a name="fr_328"></a><a href="#fn_328"><font size="1">329</font></a>
  			  an opinion which I do not altogether reject. I, however, prefer taking it for <i>angels, </i>as it is understood by the Chaldee interpreter, and some others who have followed him.   			  <a name="fr_329"></a><a href="#fn_329"><font size="1">330</font></a>
  			  The miracle is celebrated in high terms, to present the impiety of the people in a more detestable light; for it was a much more striking display of divine power for manna to be rained down from heaven, than if they had been fed either with herbs or fruits, or with other increase of the earth. Paul, in <a name="xiii.v-p8.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003">1Co 10:3</a><a name="xiii.v-p8.5"></a>, calls the manna <i>spiritual meat, </i>in a different sense — because it was a figure and symbol of Christ. But here the design of the prophet is to reprove the twofold ingratitude of the people, who despised not only the common food which was produced from the ground, but also the bread of angels. Some have translated the verbs in the past tense, <i>He commanded the clouds </i>—<i> he opened the doors of heaven </i>—<i> he rained down manna, etc</i>    			  <a name="fr_330"></a><a href="#fn_330"><font size="1">331</font></a>
  			  But to remove all ambiguity, I have thought it preferable to translate the verbs in the preterpluperfect tense, <i>He had commanded, he had opened, he had rained, </i>to enable my readers the better to understand that the prophet does not here simply relate this history, but recalls it to remembrance for another purpose, as a thing which happened long ago.</p>  <a name="xiii.vi"></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.vi-p7"></a><b>26.</b> <i>He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens.</i> We have here related how God granted the request of his people. This does not imply that he favourably regarded their fretful desires, but that he showed by the effect that it was in his power to do what they believed it to be 			 impossible for him to accomplish. From this, we may perceive how injudiciously some expositors here join together <i>the flesh </i>and <i>the manna. </i>The reason why the flesh was given was altogether different from that for which the manna was given. God, in giving the manna, performed the office of a father; but by the flesh, he satisfied their gluttonous desires, that their very greediness in devouring it 			 might choke them. It would not have been a difficult matter for God to have created quails in the midst of the wilderness; but he chose rather to bring them by the force of the winds, to teach the Israelites that all the elements are obedient to his command, and that the distance of places cannot prevent his power from immediately penetrating from the east even to the west.   			  <a name="fr_333"></a><a href="#fn_333"><font size="1">334</font></a>
  			  That unbelieving people, therefore, were furnished with an undoubted proof of the power of <i>God, </i>from which they had malignantly detracted, in seeing all the elements of nature ready to obey and promptly to execute whatever he has commanded. Besides, he no doubt raised the winds according to the situation of the camp, although it would have been easy for him, without any means, to have presented flesh before them. It 			 is stated, that <i>they did eat and were filled,</i> not only to intimate that God brought to them a large supply of birds, with which their bellies might be stuffed to the full; but also, that it was ungovernable lust which led them to ask flesh, and not a solicitude for having provision on which to live. It has been said above, that manna had been given them in the greatest abundance, 			 but here it is intended expressly to censure their gluttony, in which they gave manifest proof of their unbridled appetite. God promises, in <a name="xiii.vi-p8.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#019">Ps 145:19</a><a name="xiii.vi-p8.6"></a>, as a peculiar privilege to those who fear him, that “he will fulfill their desire;” but it is in a different way that he is here said to have yielded to the perverse desires of the people, who had cast off all fear of him; for that 			 which his favor and loving-kindness would have led him to refuse, he now granted them in his wrath. This is an example well worthy of our attention, that we may not complain if our desires are frowned upon and crossed by the secret providence of God when they break forth beyond bounds. God then truly hears us, when, instead of yielding to our foolish inclinations, he regulates his beneficence according to the measure of our welfare; even as in lavishing upon the wicked more than is good for 			 them, he cannot, properly speaking, be said to hear them: he rather loads them with a deadly burden, which serves to cast them down headlong into destruction.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.vi-p9"></a><a name="xiii.vi-p9.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.vi-p10"></a>The Psalmist expresses this still more clearly, by adding immediately after, (verses 30, 31,) that this pampering proved fatal to them, as if with the meat they had swallowed the flame of the divine wrath. When he says that <i>they were not estranged from their lust, </i>this implies, that they were still burning 			 with their lust. If it is objected that this does not agree with the preceding sentence, where it is said, that “they did eat, and were thoroughly filled,” I would answer, that if, as is well known, the minds of men are not kept within the bounds of reason and temperance, they become insatiable; and, therefore, a great abundance will not extinguish the fire of a depraved appetite. Some translate the clause, <i>They were not disappointed, </i>and 			 others, <i>They did not yet loathe their meat. </i>This last translation brings out the meaning very well; but it is too far removed from the signification of the Hebrew word <a name="xiii.vi-p10.1"></a>זור, <i>zur, </i>which I have rendered <i>estranged. </i>The prophet intended to 			 express in two words a present felt pleasure; for when God executed vengeance upon the people, they still indulged in the excessive gratification of the palate.   			  <a name="fr_334"></a><a href="#fn_334"><font size="1">335</font></a>
  			  <i>The wrath of God </i>is said metaphorically <i>to ascend, </i>when he suddenly rises up to execute judgment; for when he apparently shuts his eyes and takes no notice of our sins, he seems, so to speak, to be asleep. The punishment was felt by persons of every condition among the Israelites; but <i>the fat ones</i>   			  <a name="fr_335"></a><a href="#fn_335"><font size="1">336</font></a>
  			  and <i>the chosen </i>are expressly named, in order to exhibit the judgment of God in a light still more conspicuous. It did not happen by chance that the most robust and vigorous were attacked and cut off by the plague. As the strong are commonly deceived by their strength, and proudly exalt themselves against God, forgetting their own weakness, and thinking that they may do whatever they please, 			 it is not surprising to find that the wrath of God burned more fiercely against such persons than against others.</p>  <a name="xiii.vii"></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.vii-p6"></a><b>32.</b><i> For all this they still sinned.</i> It is a common proverb, that fools become wise when the rod is applied to them. Hence it follows, that those who have often been chastised of God, and yet are not thereby brought to repentance and amendment, are utterly to be despaired of. Such was the obstinacy of the 			 Israelites here described. They could not be reformed by any of the afflictions which were sent upon them. It was a dreadful manifestation of the vengeance of God to see so many bodies of strong and vigorous men stretched dead on the ground. It was therefore a proof of monstrous obduracy, when they were not moved at such an appalling spectacle. By the expression <i>wondrous works,</i> is not only meant the plague just now spoken of: the other miracles, previously mentioned, are comprehended. There is, therefore, laid to the charge of the people a twofold wickedness; — they are accused not only of disbelieving the word of God, but also of despising the miracles which he wrought. For this reason, it is added, that their plagues were increased; even as God denounces and threatens by Moses, that he will deal sevenfold more severely with the 			 obstinate and hardened who persevere in their wickedness.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.vii-p8"></a><b>33.</b> <i>And he consumed their days in vanity.</i> As the Psalmist here speaks of the whole people, as if he had said, that all without exception were speedily consumed, from the least even to the greatest, this might with probability be referred to that most grievous punishment which was 			 confirmed and ratified by the wrath of God — that they should all perish in the wilderness with only two exceptions, Joshua and Caleb; because, when already near the land of Canaan, they had turned back. That vast multitude, therefore, after they had shut against themselves the door of entrance into the Holy Land, died in the wilderness during the course of forty years. <i>Days </i>are put in the first place, and then <i>years; 			 </i>by which it is intimated, that the duration of their life was cut short by the curse of God, and that it was quite apparent that they failed in the midst of their course. <i>Their days </i>then were consumed <i>in vanity; </i>for they vanished away like smoke: and <i>their years in haste, </i>because they passed swiftly away like a stream. The 			 word <a name="xiii.vii-p8.1"></a>בהלה, <i>behalah, </i>here translated <i>haste, </i>is by some rendered <i>terror. </i>I would rather prefer reading <i>tumult; </i>for it is undoubtedly meant that their life was taken away, as when in a tumult 			 any thing is taken by force.   			  <a name="fr_337"></a><a href="#fn_337"><font size="1">338</font></a>
  			  But I would not be disposed to change the word <i>haste, </i>which brings out the meaning more perspicuously. It was a display of righteous retribution, on account of their obstinacy, that their strength which made them proud, thus withered and vanished all on a sudden as a shadow.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.vii-p11"></a><b>34.</b> <i>When he slew them, then they sought him.</i> By the circumstance here recorded, it is intended to aggravate their guilt. When under a conviction of their wickedness they acknowledged that they were justly punished, and yet did not with sincerity of heart humble themselves before 			 God, but rather mocked him, intending to put him off with false pretences, their impiety was the less excusable. If a man who has lost his judgment does not feel his own calamities, he is excusable because he is insensible; but he who is forced to acknowledge that he is culpable, and yet always continues the same, or after having lightly sought pardon, in fair but deceitful words, suddenly returns to his former state of mind, manifestly shows by such hollowness of heart that his disease is 			 incurable. It is here tacitly intimated, that the punishments, by which a people so obstinate were constrained to seek God, were of no common or ordinary kind; and we are informed, (verse 35,   			  <a name="fr_338"></a><a href="#fn_338"><font size="1">339</font></a>
  			 ) not only that they were convinced of wickedness, but also that they were affected with a sense and a remembrance of the redemption from which they were fallen. By this means they are the more effectually deprived of all excuse on the ground of ignorance. The language implies that they were not carried away inadvertently, or deceived through ignorance, but that they had provoked the wrath of God, by dealing treacherously, as it were with 			 deliberate purpose. And, indeed, God opened their eyes with the view of more openly discovering their desperate wickedness, as if, shaking off their hypocrisy and flatteries, he drew them from their lurking-places into the light.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.vii-p13"></a><a name="xiii.vii-p13.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.vii-p14"></a><b>36.</b> <i>And they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.</i> Here they are charged with perfidiousness, because they neither confessed their guilt with sincerity of heart, nor truly ascribed to God the glory of their deliverance. We are not to suppose that they 			 made no acknowledgement at all; but it is intimated that the confession of the mouth, as it did not proceed from the heart, was constrained and not voluntary. This is well worthy of being noticed; for from it we learn, not only the duty incumbent upon us of guarding against that gross hypocrisy which consists in uttering with the tongue, before men, one thing, while we think a different thing in our hearts, but also that we ought to beware of a species of hypocrisy which is more hidden, and 			 which consists in this, that the sinner, being constrained by fear, flatters God in a slavish manner, while yet, if he could, he would shun the judgment of God. The greater part of men are mortally smitten with this disease; for although the divine majesty extorts from them some kind of awe, yet it would be gratifying to them were the light of divine truth completely extinguished. It is, therefore, not enough to yield an assent to the divine word, unless that assent is accompanied with true and 			 pure affection, so that our hearts may not be double or divided. The Psalmist points out the cause and source of this dissimulation to be, that they were not <i>steadfast and faithful </i>By this he intimates, that whatever does not proceed from unfeigned purity of heart is accounted lying and deceit in the sight of God. Since this uprightness is every where required in the law, he accuses the people with being covenant-breakers, because they had not 			 kept the covenant of God with that fidelity which became them. As I have observed elsewhere, there is always to be presupposed a mutual relation and correspondence between the covenant of God and our faith, in order that the unfeigned consent of the latter may answer to the faithfulness of the former.</p>  <a name="xiii.viii"></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.viii-p7"></a><b>38.</b> <i>Yet he, being merciful, expiated their iniquity.</i> To show the more fully that no means had succeeded in bending the Israelites, and causing them to return to a sound state of mind, we are now informed that, although God bare with their multiplied transgressions, and exercised his 			 mercy in forgiving them, they had no less manifested their wickedness in abusing his benignity in every instance in which it was displayed, than they had shown themselves refractory and obstinate when he treated them with severity. At the same time, the reason is assigned why they did not utterly perish. They no doubt deserved to be involved in one common destruction; but it is declared that God mitigated his anger, that some seed of them might remain. That none might infer, from these examples 			 of vengeance which have been mentioned, that God had proceeded to punish them with undue severity, we are told that the punishments inflicted upon them were moderate — yea, mild, when compared with the aggravated nature of their wickedness. God kept back his hand, not looking so much to what they had deserved, as desiring to give place to his mercy. We are not, however, to imagine that he is changeable, when at one time he chastises us with a degree of severity, and at another time gently draws 			 and allures us to himself; for in the exercise of his matchless wisdom, he has recourse to different means by which to try whether there is really any hope of our recovery. But the guilt of men becomes more aggravated, when neither his severity can reform them nor his mercy melt them. It is to be observed, that the mercy of God, which is an essential attribute of his nature, is here assigned as the reason why he spared his people, to teach us that he was not induced by any other cause but this, 			 to show himself so much inclined and ready to pardon. Moreover, as he pardoned them not only in one instance, nor in one respect, it is affirmed that <i>he expiated their iniquity, that he might not destroy them; </i>and again, that although he had been oftentimes provoked, he yet ceased not to turn away his anger; and, finally, that he mitigated his chastisements, lest the people 			 should be overwhelmed with the weight of them.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.viii-p8"></a><a name="xiii.viii-p8.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.viii-p9"></a><b>39.</b> <i>And he remembered that they were flesh.</i> Another reason is now brought forward why God had compassion on the people, which is, his unwillingness to try his strength against men who are so constituted as to live only for a short period in this world, and who then quickly pass 			 away; for the forms of expression here used denote the frailty by which the condition of men is made miserable. <i>Flesh </i>and <i>spirit </i>are frequently contrasted in the Scriptures; not only when<i> flesh </i>means our depraved and sinful nature, and <i>spirit </i>the uprightness to which the children of God are born 			 again; but also when men are called <i>flesh, </i>because there is nothing firm or stable in them: as it is said in Isaiah, (<a name="xiii.viii-p9.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003">Isa 31:3</a><a name="xiii.viii-p9.1"></a>,) “Egypt is flesh, and not spirit.” In this passage, however, the<i> words flesh </i>and <i>spirit </i>are employed in the same sense — <i>flesh </i>meaning that men are subject to corruption and putrefaction; and <i>spirit, </i>that they are only a breath or a fleeting shadow. As men are brought to death by a continual wasting and decay, the people are compared to a wind which passes away, and which, of its own accord, falls and does not return again. When we have 			 run our race, we do not commence a new life upon the earth; even as it is said in Job,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xiii.viii-p10"></a>“For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?” (<a name="xiii.viii-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007">Job 14:7</a><a name="xiii.viii-p10.1"></a>)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.viii-p11"></a>The meaning, then, as we may now clearly perceive, is, that God, in the exercise of his mercy and goodness, bare with the Jews, not because they deserved this, but because their frail and transitory condition called forth his pity and induced him to pardon them. We shall afterwards meet with an almost similar statement in <a name="xiii.viii-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#013">Ps 103:13-16</a><a name="xiii.viii-p11.1"></a>, where 			 God is represented as being merciful to us, because he sees that we are like grass, and that we soon wither and become dry like hay. Now, if God find in us nothing but misery to move him to compassion, it follows that it is solely his own pure and undeserved goodness which induces him to sustain us. When it is affirmed that men <i>return not, </i>when they have finished the course of their life in this world, it is not meant to exclude the hope of a future resurrection; for men are contemplated 			 only as they are in themselves, and it is merely their state on earth which is spoken of. With respect to the renovation of man to the heavenly life, it is a miracle far surpassing nature. In the same sense it is said, in another place, “His spirit goeth forth, and returneth not,” (<a name="xiii.viii-p11.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/apo/wis016.htm#014">Wisdom 16:14</a><a name="xiii.viii-p11.2"></a>;) language which implies that men, when they are born into the world, do not bring with them the hope of future restoration, which must be derived from the grace of regeneration.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.viii-p13"></a><b>40.</b> <i>How often did they provoke him in the desert?</i> Here the preceding sentence is confirmed, it being declared that, as they had in so many instances provoked God in the wilderness, by the vast accumulation of their sins,   			  <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">342</font></a>
  			  they must of necessity have perished a thousand times, had not God as often shown himself favorable and merciful towards them. The interrogatory form of the sentence expresses more significantly that they continued sinning without intermission. The word <i>wilderness </i>includes in it the circumstance both of place and of time. By this it is intended, first, to reprove their ingratitude, in that the memory of God’s 			 benefits, while still so fresh in their minds, and even the sight of them daily before their eyes, were not at least able to check them in their wickedness; and, secondly, to condemn their impetuous and infatuated recklessness, in heaping up such a multitude of sins within so short a period.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.viii-p15"></a>In the same sense it is added immediately after, (verse 41,) that <i>they returned </i>to their former ways, and <i>tempted God. </i>The word <i>return </i>does not here signify change, but a continued course of sinning. The heinous indignity which is done to God when men tempt him, is expressed 			 by a beautiful metaphor. The Hebrew word <a name="xiii.viii-p15.1"></a>תוה<i>, tavah, </i>signifies <i>to mark out </i>or <i>describe. </i>It is intimated, that when the people dared to limit the operations of God, according to their own pleasure, he was, as it were, shut up within bars of wood or iron, and his 			 infinite power circumscribed within the narrow boundaries to which unbelief would confine it. And assuredly, whenever men do not go beyond their own understandings, it is as if they would measure God by their own small capacity, which is nothing else than to pull him down from his throne; for his Majesty must be brought into subjection to us, if we would have him to be regulated according to our own fancy.</p>  <a name="xiii.ix"></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p13"></a><b>42.</b> <i>They remembered not his hand.</i> The sacred writer still continues to upbraid the Israelites; for the simple remembrance of God’s benefits might have restrained them, had they not wilfully and perversely forgotten whatever they had experienced. From this impious forgetfulness proceed 			 waywardness and all rebellion. <i>The hand of God, </i>as is well known, is by the figure metonomy taken for his power. In the deliverance of the chosen tribes from Egypt here celebrated, the hand of God was stretched forth in a new and an unusual manner. And their impiety, against which the prophet now inveighs, was rendered the more detestable, from the fact that they accounted as nothing, or soon forgat, that which no length of time ought to have 			 effaced from their memory. Farther, he recounts certain examples of the power of God, which he calls first <i>signs, </i>and then <i>miracles, </i>(verse 43,) that, by the recital of these, he may again rebuke the shameful stupidity of the people. By both these words he expresses the same thing; but in the second clause of the verse, the word <i>miracles </i>gives 			 additional emphasis, implying that, by such strange and unheard-of events, the Egyptians had at that time been stricken with such terror as ought not to have vanished so speedily from the minds of the Israelites.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ix-p14"></a><a name="xiii.ix-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p15"></a><b>44.</b> <i>When he turned their rivers into blood.</i> The Psalmist does not enumerate in their order the miracles by which God gave evidence of his power in the deliverance of his people. He considered it enough to bring to their remembrance the well-known histories of these events, which would 			 be sufficient to lay open the wickedness and ingratitude with which they were chargeable; nor is it necessary for us to stay long on these things, since the narrative of Moses gives a more distinct and fuller account of what is here briefly stated. Only I would have my readers to remember that, although God often punished the sins of the heathen by sending upon them hail and other calamities, yet all the plagues which at that time were inflicted upon the Egyptians were of an extraordinary 			 character, and such as were previously unheard-of. A variety of words is therefore employed to enhance these memorable instances of the vengeance of God, as that <i>he sent upon them the fierceness of his wrath, fury, anger, and affliction</i> This accumulation of words is intended to awaken minds which are asleep to a discovery of so many miracles, of which both the number and the 			 excellence might be perceived even by the blind themselves.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p16"></a>In the last place, it is added that God executed these judgments <i>by angels. </i>Although God has, according as it has pleased him, established certain laws, both in heaven and on earth, and governs the whole order of nature in such a manner as that each creature has assigned to it its own peculiar office; yet whenever it seems good to him he makes use of the ministration of angels for executing his commands, not by ordinary or natural 			 means, but by his secret power, which to us is incomprehensible. Some think that devils are here spoken of, because the epithet <i>evil </i>or <i>hurtful </i>is applied to <i>angel.</i>  			  <a name="fr_350"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">351</font></a>
  			  This opinion I do not reject; but the ground upon which they rest it has little solidity. They say that as God dispenses his benefits to us by the ministry of elect angels, so he also executes his wrath by the agency of reprobate angels, as if they were his executioners. This I admit is partly true; but I deny that this distinction is always observed. Many passages of Scripture can be quoted to the contrary. When the army of the Assyrians laid siege to the holy city Jerusalem, 			 who was it that made such havoc among them as compelled them to raise the siege, but the angel who was appointed at that time for the defense of the Church? (<a name="xiii.ix-p17.9"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035">2Ki 19:35</a><a name="xiii.ix-p17.9"></a>.) In like manner, the angel who slew the first-born in Egypt (<a name="xiii.ix-p17.10"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#005">Ex 11:5</a><a name="xiii.ix-p17.10"></a>) was not only a minister and an executor of the wrath of God against the 			 Egyptians, but also the agent employed for preserving the Israelites. On the other hand, although the kings of whom Daniel speaks were avaricious and cruel, or rather robbers, and turned all things upside down, yet the Prophet declares, (chapter 20:13,) that holy angels were appointed to take charge of them. It is probable that the Egyptians were given over and subjected to reprobate angels, as they deserved; but we may simply consider the angels here spoken of as termed <i>evil, </i>on account 			 of the work in which they were employed, — because they inflicted upon the enemies of the people of God terrible plagues to repress their tyranny and cruelty. In this way, both the heavenly and elect angels, and the fallen angels, are justly accounted the ministers or executors of calamity; but they are to be regarded as such in different senses. The former yield a prompt and willing obedience to God; but the latter, as they are always eagerly intent upon doing mischief, and would, if they 			 could, turn the whole world upside down, are fit instruments for inflicting calamities upon men.</p>

  			  To take away all excuse from this ungrateful people, whom the most evident and striking proofs of the goodness of God which were presented before their eyes could not keep in their obedience to him, it is here again repeated that the wrath of God overflowed Egypt like an impetuous torrent. The miracle adverted to is the last which was there wrought, when God, by the powerful hand of his angel, slew, in one night, all the first-born of Egypt. 			 According to a common and familiar mode of speaking in the Hebrew language, the first-born are called <i>the beginning, </i>or <i>the first-fruits of strength. </i>Although the old advance to death as they decline in years, yet as they are in a manner renewed in their offspring, and thus may be said to recover their decayed strength, the term <i>strength </i>is 			 applied to their children.

 <p><a name="xiii.x-p9"></a><b>52.</b><i> And he made his people to go forth like sheep.</i> The Psalmist again celebrates God’s fatherly love towards the chosen people, whom, as we have elsewhere remarked, he compares to a flock of sheep. They had no wisdom or power of their own to preserve and defend themselves; but God graciously condescended to 			 perform towards them the office of a shepherd. It is a singular token of the love which he bore towards them, that he did not disdain to humble himself so far as to feed them as his own sheep. What could a multitude who had never been trained up to the art of war do against powerful and warlike enemies? So far from having learned the art of war, the people, as is well known, had been employed, when in Egypt, in mean and servile occupations, as if they had been condemned to toil under the earth 			 in mines or in quarries.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.x-p10"></a><a name="xiii.x-p10.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p11"></a><b>53.</b><i> And he conducted them in safety, and they were not afraid.</i> This does not imply that they relied on God confidently, and with tranquil minds, but that, having God for their guide and the guardian of their welfare, they had no just cause to be afraid. When at any time they were thrown into consternation, this 			 was owing to their own unbelief. From this cause proceeded these murmuring questions to which they gave utterance, when Pharaoh pursued them, upon their leaving Egypt, and when they were “sore afraid:” “Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for 			 us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness,” (<a name="xiii.x-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011">Ex 14:11</a><a name="xiii.x-p11.1"></a>.) This security, then, is not to be referred to the feeling of this in the minds of the people, but to the protection of God, by which it came to pass that, their enemies having been drowned in the Red Sea, they enjoyed quiet and repose in the wilderness. Other benefits which God had bestowed upon them 			 are here recited, and at the same time other transgressions with which they had been chargeable. This shows the more clearly their deep ingratitude. After having obtained possession of the inheritance which was promised them, as if they had been under no obligations to God, their hearts were always rebellious and untractable. The accomplishment, and, as it were, the concluding act of their deliverance, was the putting them in possession of the land of Canaan, from entering which they had 			 precluded themselves, had not God determined, notwithstanding their wickedness, to complete, in all respects, the work which he had commenced. The land itself is called <i>the borders of God’s sanctuary, </i>(verse 54,) because God, in assigning it to his people, had also consecrated it to himself. This, it is manifest, exhibits in a more heinous and aggravated light the iniquity of the people, who brought into that land the same pollutions with which 			 it had been anciently defiled. What madness was it for the people of Israel, who knew that the old inhabitants of the country had been driven from it on account of their abominations, to strive to surpass them in all kinds of wickedness? as if they had been resolved to do all they could to bring down upon their own heads that divine vengeance which they had seen executed upon others. The words <i>this mountain </i>are improperly explained by some as 			 applying to the whole country of Judea; for although it was a mountainous country, there were in it plain and level grounds of large extent, both as to breadth and length. I have, therefore, no doubt, that by way of amplification the Psalmist makes honorable mention of mount Zion, where God had chosen a habitation for himself, and his chief seat. I indeed allow, that under this expression, by the figure synecdoche, a part is put for the whole; only I would have my readers to understand, that 			 this place is expressly named, because from it, as from a source or fountain, flowed the holiness of the whole land. It is asserted that God, by his right hand, possessed or acquired this mountain; for the Hebrew verb <a name="xiii.x-p11.2"></a>קנה<i>, kanah, </i>may be understood in either of these senses: and this assertion is made, that the Israelites might not be lifted up with pride, as if 			 they had achieved the conquest of the land, or had obtained the peaceable possession of it by their own power. As is stated in <a name="xiii.x-p11.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003">Ps 44:3</a><a name="xiii.x-p11.3"></a>,</p>

Besides, it would have been unlawful for them to have taken possession of the country, had it not been the will of God that the first inhabitants should be deprived of it, and that 			 strangers should be established in it in their room.</p>

With respect to the word <i>tempt, </i>we have already explained its import. But it is added in general, that <i>they provoked God, because they had not kept his covenant</i> By this last clause, their open and gross rebellion is the more 			 completely demonstrated; for, although they had been plainly taught their duty, they nevertheless refused to submit to the authority of God. The law is called <i>testimonies </i>or <i>agreements,</i>   			  <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">357</font></a>
  			  because, as men enter into contracts upon certain conditions, so God, by his covenant, entered into a contract with this people, and bound them to himself. In speaking of them in this manner, there is pronounced upon them no light censure; but when they are charged in the next verse with apostasy and perfidiousness, that fills up the measure of their guilt. God had adopted them to be his people: they, on the other hand, despising his favor, 			 voluntarily renounce it. He had gathered them together under his wings; and they, by their waywardness, scatter themselves in all directions. He had promised to be a father to them; and they refuse to be his children. He had shown them the way of salvation; and they, by going astray, willingly precipitate themselves into destruction. The prophet, therefore, concludes, that in every age they showed themselves to be an impious and wicked people. It is again to be noticed, that the fault which is 			 most severely condemned in them is, that they too much resembled their fathers. This is particularly mentioned, to prevent any man from deceiving himself by supposing, that in indiscriminately imitating his ancestors he is doing right, and that he may not think of making use of their example as an argument for defending his own conduct. The instability of the people is next expressed by a very apposite figure, which Hosea also employs in <a name="xiii.x-p17.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016">Ho 7:16</a><a name="xiii.x-p17.2"></a>. As archers are deceived when they have a bow which is too weak, or ill bent, or crooked and flexible, so it is stated, that this people <i>turned back, </i>and slipped away by their deceitful and tortuous craftiness, that they might not be governed by the hand of God.</p>

And the fruits which uniformly proceed from the contempt of the law are, that men who choose rather to follow their own understanding than to submit to the authority of God, become wedded to gross superstitions. The Psalmist complains that the service of God was 			 corrupted by them in two ways; in the first place, by their defacing the glory of God, in setting up for themselves idols and graven images; and, secondly, by their inventing strange and forbidden ceremonies to appease the anger of God.</p>  <a name="xiii.xi"></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.xi-p10"></a><b>59</b> <i> God heard it, and was wroth.</i> The prophet again shows that God, when he found that no good resulted from his long-suffering, which the people abused, yea, even treated with mockery, and perverted as an encouragement to greater excess in sinning, at length proceeded to inflict 			 severe punishments upon them. The metaphor, which he borrows from earthly judges, is frequently to be met with in the Scriptures. When God is said <i>to hear, </i>it is not meant that it is necessary for him to make inquisition, but it is intended to teach us that he does not rush forth inconsiderately to execute his judgments, and thus to prevent any from supposing that he ever acts precipitately. The amount of what is stated is, that the people 			 continued so pertinaciously in their wickedness, that at length the cry of it ascended to heaven; and the very weight of the punishment demonstrated the aggravated nature of the offense.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.xi-p11"></a><a name="xiii.xi-p11.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xi-p12"></a>After it is said that Israel, whom God had loved so much, was become an abomination in his sight, it is added, (verse 60,) that they were bereft of the presence of God, which is the only source of true felicity and comfort under calamities of every kind. God, then, is said <i>to have abhorred Israel, 			 </i>when he permitted the ark of the covenant to be carried into another country, as if he intended by this to indicate that he had departed from Judea, and bidden the people farewell. It is indeed very obvious, that God was not fixed to the outward and visible symbol; but as he had given the ark to be a token or sign of the close union which subsisted between him and the Israelites, in suffering it to be carried away, he testified, that he himself had also departed from 			 them. Shiloh having been for a long time the abode of the ark, and the place where it was captured by the Philistines, (<a name="xiii.xi-p12.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#011">1Sa 4:11</a><a name="xiii.xi-p12.1"></a>,) it is termed <i>the habitation </i>or <i>dwelling-place of God. </i>The manner of his residence, in short, is beautifully expressed in the next sentence, where 			 Shiloh is described as his dwelling-place <i>among men. </i>God, it is true, fills both heaven and earth; but as we cannot attain to that infinite height to which he is exalted, in descending among us by the exercise of his power and grace, he approaches as near to us as is needful, and as our limited capacity will bear. It is a very emphatic manner of speaking to represent God as so incensed by the continual wickedness of his people, that he was 			 constrained to forsake this place, the only one which he had chosen for himself upon the earth.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.xi-p13"></a><a name="xiii.xi-p13.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xi-p14"></a><b>61.</b> <i>And he delivered his strength into captivity.</i> In this verse, the same subject is prosecuted: it is declared, that <i>the strength </i>of God, by which the Israelites had been shielded and defended, was at that time <i>in captivity. </i>Not that his power could only be exerted in connection with the outward symbol; but instead of opposing their enemies as he had formerly done, it was now his will that the grace by which he had preserved his people should, so to speak, be led captive. This, however, is not to be understood as implying that the Philistines had made God their prisoner. The meaning simply is, that the Israelites were deprived of the protection of God, in 			 consequence of which they fell into the hands of their enemies, even as an army is put to flight when the general is taken prisoner. The ark is also termed <i>the beauty of God; </i>because, being in himself invisible, he made it the symbol of his presence, or, as it were, a mirror in which he might be seen. It is a bold, and at first sight, an absurd hyperbole, to say that the strength of God was taken prisoner by the Philistines; but it is expressly 			 used for the purpose of aggravating the wickedness of the people. As he had been accustomed mightily to display the power of his arm in aiding them, the offenses with which he had been provoked must have been of a very heinous character, when he suffered that symbol of his power to be forcibly carried away by a heathen army. We are taught by the prophet Jeremiah, (<a name="xiii.xi-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012">Jer 7:12</a><a name="xiii.xi-p14.1"></a>,) that what is here related of Shiloh, is addressed as a warning to all those who, flattering themselves upon false grounds, that they enjoy the presence of God, are lifted up with vain confidence: “But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.” If, therefore, when God approaches us 			 familiarly, we do not sincerely receive him with that reverence which becomes us, we have ground to fear that what happened to the people of Shiloh will happen also to us. So much the more disgusting, then, is the boasting of the Pope and his adherents, who support the claims of Rome as the special dwelling-place of God, from the fact, that the Church in former times flourished in that city. It is to be remembered, — what they seem to forget, — that Christ, who is the true temple of the 			 Godhead, was born in Bethlehem, and brought up in Nazareth, and that he dwelt and preached in Capernaum and Jerusalem; and yet the miserable desolation of all these cities affords a dreadful testimony of the wrath of God.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.xi-p16"></a><b>62.</b><i> And he shut up his people to the sword.</i> Other parts of the calamity which befell Israel in the time of the high priest Eli are here mentioned. God, in permitting the ark to be carried away, showed that he had withdrawn his favor from them. This was also demonstrated from the fact, that all the flower of 			 the people — those who were in the prime and blush of manhood — were consumed by the wrath of God: which is expressed by <i>the fire devouring them. </i>But this language is metaphorical, as is evident from the history of the event referred to, which informs us, that those that perished who were of the chosen of Israel, to the number of thirty thousand men, fell by the sword of the enemy, and not by fire, (<a name="xiii.xi-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#010">1Sa 4:10</a><a name="xiii.xi-p16.1"></a>.) This figure points out the suddenness of the dreadful calamity. It is as if it had been said, They were destroyed in a moment, even as fire quickly consumes chaff and the dry leaves of trees.   			  <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">361</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xi-p18"></a>The great extent of this slaughter is heightened by another figure, which is, that for want of men, the maidens continued unmarried. This is the meaning of the clause, <i>Their virgins were not applauded;</i> the reference being to the nuptial songs which were wont 			 to be sung at marriages in praise of the bride. To aggravate still more the unwonted and appalling nature of the calamity, it is added, that even <i>the priests, </i>whom God had taken under his special protection, perished indiscriminately with others. When it is said, that <i>the widows made no lamentation,</i> I would explain it as denoting, 			 either that they themselves died first for sorrow, so that they had no opportunity of mourning for others, or else, that when led captive by their enemies, they were prohibited to mourn. By all these expressions, the object is to show, in a few words, that all kinds of calamities were heaped upon them.   			  <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_361"><font size="1">362</font></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.xi-p21"></a><b>65.</b><i> But the Lord awoke as one asleep.</i> Some understand this as spoken of the Israelites, implying that the Lord awoke against them; and others, as spoken of their enemies. If the first sense is adopted, it need not excite our surprise, that the Israelites are termed, in the 66th verse, <i>the enemies of God, </i>even as they are so designated in <a name="xiii.xi-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024">Isa 1:24</a><a name="xiii.xi-p21.1"></a>,</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.xi-p23"></a>And thus the meaning will be, that the Israelites paid dearly for abusing the patience of God, by taking encouragement from it to indulge to greater excess in the commission of sin; for awaking suddenly, he rushed upon them with so much the greater fury. But as we find the prophets drawing their doctrine from Moses, and also framing their language according to his as a standard, the opinion of those who understand this and the following 			 verse, as referring to the Philistines, is no less probable. The prophet here appears to have borrowed this order, from the song of Moses, (<a name="xiii.xi-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#027">De 32:27</a><a name="xiii.xi-p23.1"></a>,) where God declares, that while he punished his own people, he, at the same time, did not forget to repress their enemies. Since it is a common proverb, that the issue of wars is uncertain, if, after the enemies of the chosen tribes had obtained the 			 victory, no change had happened to them, it would not have been so manifest, that what befell his own people was a punishment inflicted upon them by God. But when God, after having afflicted and humbled the Israelites, made his judgments to fall on their conquerors, without the instrumentality of man, beyond all human expectation, and contrary to what happens in the ordinary course of events; — from this it is the more plainly manifest, that when the Israelites were laid in the dust, it was the 			 work of God, who intended thus to punish them. The prophet, however, at the same time, gives us to understand, that God was constrained, as it were, by necessity, to punish them with greater severity; because, in afterwards inflicting his judgments upon the Philistines, he gave abundant evidence of his regard to his covenant, which the Israelites might be very apt to think he had quite forgotten. Although he had, so to speak, taken the side of the Philistines for a time, it was not his 			 intention utterly to withdraw his love from the children of Abraham, lest the truth of his promise should become void.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xi-p24"></a>The figure of a drunken man may seem somewhat harsh; but the propriety of using it will appear, when we consider that it is employed in accommodation to the stupidity of the people. Had they been of a pure and clear understanding,   			  <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_362"><font size="1">363</font></a>
  			  God would not have thus transformed himself, and assumed a character foreign to his own. When he, therefore, compares himself to a drunken man, it was the drunkenness of the people; that is to say, their insensibility that constrained him to speak thus: which was so much the greater shame to them. With respect to God, the metaphor derogates nothing from his glory. If he does not immediately remedy our calamities, we are ready to think that he is sunk into a profound 			 sleep. But how can God, it may be said, be thus asleep, when he is superior in strength to all the giants, and yet they can easily watch for a long time, and are satisfied with little sleep? I answer, when he exercises forbearance, and does not promptly execute his judgments, the interpretation which ignorant people put upon his conduct is, that he loiters in this manner like a man who is stupified, and knows not how to proceed.   			  <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_363"><font size="1">364</font></a>
  			  The prophet, on the contrary, declares, that this sudden awaking of God will be more alarming and terrible than if he had at the first lifted up his hand to execute judgment; and that it will be as if a giant, drunken with wine, should start up suddenly out of his sleep, while as yet he had not slept off his surfeit. Many restrict the statement in the 66th verse, concerning God’s <i>smiting his enemies behind, </i>to the 			 plague which he sent upon the Philistines, recorded in <a name="xiii.xi-p26.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#012">1Sa 5:12</a><a name="xiii.xi-p26.2"></a>. The phrase, <i>everlasting disgrace, </i>agrees very well with this interpretation; for it was a shameful disease to be afflicted with haemorrhoids in their hinder parts. But as the words, <i>They were smitten 			 behind, </i>admit of a more simple sense, I leave the matter undecided.</p>  <a name="xiii.xii"></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p6"></a><b>67.</b> <i>And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph. </i>Those who suppose that the word <i>enemies, </i>in the 66th verse, applies to the Israelites, connect these verses with the preceding, and suppose the meaning to be, that the wound which God had inflicted upon them was 			 incurable. But, preferring the other opinion, which regards the Philistines as spoken of, and the scope to be, that God, in punishing them so severely, evidently showed that the covenant which he had made with his people was not disannulled, since he had avenged himself in such an awful manner upon their enemies, the explanation which I would rather give is, that this is added by way of correction, as if it had been said, That God was not yet fully reconciled towards his people who had wickedly 			 revolted from him, and that, as an evidence of this, there remained among them some traces of the punishment with which he had visited them. The meaning of the text, therefore, is, that when the ark was taken by the Philistines, God was, so to speak, asleep, having been made drunk by the sins of his people, so that he could no longer keep watch for their defense as he had been accustomed to do; and yet, that he did not continue long sunk in sleep, but that, whenever he saw the ungodly 			 Philistines treating with mockery the glory of his majesty, this heinous insult awoke and provoked him, just as if a giant, having well supped, had awoke from his first sleep before he had recovered from the exciting effects of his wine; and that, at the same time, his anger had not been so provoked against this heathen and uncircumcised nation as to prevent him from exhibiting some signs of the chastisement which he had inflicted upon the wicked and ungrateful Israelites even to the end. The 			 rejection spoken of amounts to this, that when God permitted his ark to be carried away to another place, the Israelites were thereby deprived of the honor with which, by special privilege, they had been previously distinguished.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p7"></a>There are two principal points which should here be particularly attended to; in the first place, when the Philistines were smitten with unseemly ulcers, the plainest evidence was afforded that when the Israelites were conquered by them, this happened solely because God willed it to be so. He did not recover new strength, or gather together a new army for the purpose of invading, some short time after, the Philistines who had been 			 victorious, nor did he have recourse, in doing this, to foreign aid. The other point is, that although God stretched forth his hand against the Philistines, to show that he had still some remembrance of his covenant, and some care of the people whom he had chosen, yet in restoring the Israelites in some measure to their former state, he made the rejection of Shiloh a perpetual monument of his wrath. He, therefore, rejected the tribe of Ephraim;  			  <a name="fr_365"></a><a href="#fn_365"><font size="1">366</font></a>
  			 not that he cast them off for ever, or completely severed them from the rest of the body of the Church, but he would not have the ark of his covenant to reside any longer within the boundaries of that tribe. To the tribe of Ephraim is here opposed the tribe of Judah, in which God afterwards chose for himself a dwelling-place.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p9"></a>Thus the prophet proceeds to show, that when the ark of the covenant had a resting-place assigned to it on mount Zion, the people were in a manner renewed; and this symbol of reconciliation being restored to them, they were recovered to the favor of God from which they had fallen. As God had, so to speak, been banished from the kingdom, and his strength led into captivity through the sins of the Israelites, they had need to be taught, by 			 this memorial, that God had been so highly displeased with their wickedness, that he could not bear to look upon the place in which he had formerly dwelt. After this separation, although to teach the people to be more on their guard in time to come, there was not a full and perfect restitution, yet God again chose a fixed residence for his ark, which was a manifestation of wonderful goodness and mercy on his part. The ark, after its return, was carried from one place to another, as to Gath, 			 Ekron, and other places, until mount Zion was pointed out by an oracle as its fixed abode; but this intervening period is not taken notice of by the prophet, because his design went no farther than to impress upon the memory, both the example of the punishment, and the grace of God, which was greater than any could have ventured to hope for.  			  <a name="fr_366"></a><a href="#fn_366"><font size="1">367</font></a>
  			 That which is often repeated by Moses should also be remembered:</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xiii.xii-p11"></a>“But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come,” etc., (<a name="xiii.xii-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005">De 12:5</a><a name="xiii.xii-p11.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p12"></a>Shiloh having acquired this renown, because the ark had dwelt there for a long time, when the ark was carried away into the country of the enemies of Israel, the minds of men were strangely perplexed, until they knew the place which God had chosen for its future residence. The ten tribes were not at that time rejected, and they had an equal interest in the kingdom and the priesthood with the tribe of Judah; but in process of time their own 			 rebellion cut them off. This is the reason why the prophet says, in scorn, that the tribe of Ephraim was rejected, and that the tribe of Joseph, from whom it sprung, was not chosen.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.xii-p13"></a><a name="xiii.xii-p13.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p14"></a><b>68.</b> <i>But he chose the tribe of Judah.</i> The meaning is, that God preferred the tribe of Judah to all the rest of the people, and chose from it a king, whom he might set over all the Israelites as well as the Jews. And he chose <i>the 			 mountain of Zion,</i> appointing a certain spot upon it to be the seat of his sanctuary. That the cause of this choice might not be sought any where else but in God, it is particularly stated that the preferring of mount Zion to all other places, and the enriching of it in such a distinguished manner, proceeded entirely from the free and unmerited love of God. The relative <i>which </i>is here 			 put instead of the causal adverb <i>for; </i>the meaning being, that the sanctuary of God was established there, not for any worthiness of the place, but solely because it was the good pleasure of God. It was proper that this second restitution of the people should be no less free than their first adoption was, when God made his covenant with Abraham, or when he delivered them from the land of Egypt. God’s <i>love </i>to the place had a respect to men. From this it follows, that the Church has been gathered together from the beginning, and in all ages, by the pure grace and goodness of God; for never have men been found to possess any intrinsic meritorious claims to his regard, and the Church is too precious to be left to depend upon the power of men.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.xii-p15"></a><a name="xiii.xii-p15.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p16"></a><b>69.</b> <i>And built his sanctuary like high places.</i>   			  <a name="fr_367"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">368</font></a>
  			  In this verse, what is intimated is simply this, that Mount Zion was singularly beautified; which, however, ought to be referred to the heavenly pattern. It was not the will of God that the minds of his people should be entirely engrossed with the magnificence of the building, or with the pomp of outward ceremonies; but that they should be elevated to Christ, in whom the truth of the figures of the former economy was exhibited. It is, 			 therefore affirmed, that <i>the sanctuary was built like high places; </i>that is to say, it was conspicuous among all the high mountains: even as Isaiah (<a name="xiii.xii-p17.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002">Isa 2:2</a><a name="xiii.xii-p17.6"></a>,) and Micah, (<a name="xiii.xii-p17.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001">Mic 4:1</a><a name="xiii.xii-p17.7"></a>,) prophesying of the building of the new and spiritual temple, declare that it “shall be established in the tops of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills.” And it is well known that fortresses were in those days erected upon high places. Zion is next compared to the entire mass of the globe: <i>He hath built his sanctuary like the earth,</i>   			  <a name="fr_368"></a><a href="#fn_368"><font size="1">369</font></a>
  			 <i> which he has established for ever. </i>Some regions of the globe are visited by earthquakes, or perish by the opening of the earth, or are agitated by some violent commotion, or undergo some alteration; but the body of the earth itself continues always stable and unchanged, because it rests upon deep foundations. It is, therefore, here taught that the building spoken of was not temporary, like the sumptuous palaces of kings, which fall into 			 ruins during the lapse of time, or are in danger of being destroyed by other means; but that it was founded to stand entire, even to the end of the world. If it is objected that the temple was destroyed by the Chaldeans and Assyrians, the answer is obvious, That the stability celebrated consists in Christ alone; for, if the ancient sanctuary, which was only a figure, is considered merely in itself, without any regard to that which it typified, it will be only an empty shadow. But as God 			 intended it to be a pledge to show that Christ was to come, perpetuity is justly attributed to it. In like manner it is said, in another place, (<a name="xiii.xii-p18.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001">Ps 87:1</a><a name="xiii.xii-p18.1"></a>,) “His foundation is in the holy mountains;” and in Isaiah, (<a name="xiii.xii-p18.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#032">Isa 14:32</a><a name="xiii.xii-p18.2"></a>,) “The Lord hath founded Zion;” and again, in <a name="xiii.xii-p18.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#002">Ps 74:2</a><a name="xiii.xii-p18.3"></a>, God is said “to dwell in mount Zion,” so that it should never be moved.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.xii-p19"></a><a name="xiii.xii-p19.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p20"></a><b>70.</b> <i>And he chose David his servant.</i> After having made mention of the temple, the prophet now proceeds to speak of the kingdom; for these two things were the chief signs of God’s choice of his ancient people, and of his favor towards them; and Christ also hath appeared as our king 			 and priest to bring a full and perfect salvation to us. He proves that David was made king by God, who elevated him from the sheepfold, and from the keeping of cattle, to the royal throne. It serves in no small degree to magnify the grace of God, that a peasant was taken from his mean shepherd’s cot, and exalted to the dignity of a king. Nor is this grace limited to the person of David. We are taught that whatever worth there was in the children of Abraham, flowed from the fountain of God’s 			 mercy. The whole glory and felicity of the people consisted in the kingdom and priesthood; and both these are attributed to the pure grace and good pleasure of God. And it was requisite that the commencement of the kingdom of Christ should be lowly and contemptible, that it might correspond with its type, and that God might clearly show that he did not make use of external aids in order to accomplish our salvation.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.xii-p21"></a><a name="xiii.xii-p21.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p22"></a><b>71.</b> <i>He took him from following the suckling ewes, etc.</i> The grace of God is farther commended from the circumstance, that David, who was a keeper of sheep, was made the shepherd of the chosen people and heritage of God. There is an allusion to David’s original condition; but the 			 Spirit of God, at the same time, shows us the difference between good and lawful kings, and tyrants, robbers, and insatiable extortioners, by telling us that whoever would aspire to the character of the former must be like shepherds.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p23"></a>It is afterwards added, (verse 72,) that David had faithfully performed the duties of the trust committed to him. By this the prophet indirectly rebukes the ingratitude and perverseness of the people, who not only overturned the holy and inviolable order which God had established, but who had also, in shaking off his salutary yoke, thrown themselves into a state of miserable dispersion. What follows concerning <i>the prudence of David’s 			 hands </i>seems to be an improper form of expression. But it is intended forcibly to express, that he not only was successful in what he had undertaken, but that he was governed by the Spirit of God, which prevented him from putting his hand at random to any work which might come in his way, and led him prudently and skilfully to do that to which faith and duty called him; and thus, in the success of his undertakings, his wisdom appears more conspicuous than his good fortune.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xiii.i-p7"></a> Calmet refers the composition of this psalm to the days of Asa, who, aided by the Syrians, obtained a signal victory over the Israelites, and brought back to the pure worship of God many out of the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon. See <a name="xiii.i-p7.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#000">2Ch 15</a><a name="xiii.i-p7.1"></a> and <a name="xiii.i-p7.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#000">2Ch 16</a><a name="xiii.i-p7.2"></a>. Schnurrer 				  supposes, that the special purpose for which it was composed was, to celebrate a decisive victory which had been gained over the kingdom of Ephraim or Israel by Abijah, the king of Judah during the reign of Jeroboam. Walford thinks this opinion highly probable. “There is,” say’s he, “an eulogy passed upon David at the conclusion of the psalm, which makes it likely that the author of it wished to conciliate the favor of the whole people towards David’s successors, from whom 				  Jeroboam had revolted: and in verse 9th, there is a reference to Ephraim which affords some degree of evidence in support of Schnurrer’s hypothesis. Whatever may be thought of this hypothesis, we cannot hesitate to admit that the psalm itself is clear, pungent, and persuasive, and must have been felt to be so by the persons for whose use it was written.”</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.i-p14"></a>“The words <i>law</i>,<i> parable</i>, and <i>dark sayings</i>,” he observes, “which are found in the English translation of verses 1st and 2d, are not appropriate to the recitals which are contained in 				  the psalm.

He translates <a name="xiii.i-p14.1"></a>חידות, <i>chidoth</i>, “pointed truths,” and objects to its being 				  translated <i>dark sayings</i>  “There is nothing obscure in the psalm,” says he, “it contains instructive historical truth, but no enigma.

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xiii.v-p8"></a> The Chaldee paraphrase of the expression, <i>the bread of the mighty</i>, is, “the food that descends from the dwelling of angels;” so that, according to this view, it signifies no more than, “corn of heaven,” by which the manna is described in the preceding verse. Dr Geddes and Williams observe, that the Hebrew word <a name="xiii.v-p8.1"></a>אבירים, <i>abbirim</i>, never signifies <i>angels</i>, but persons of the higher classes, the <i>rich</i>, the <i>great</i>, the <i>noble</i>; and that the meaning of the Psalmist is, that the Israelites found in the manna a dainty, delicate food, such as might suit the palates of the great; that it was bread fit for princes; the best, the choicest of bread. This agrees with Simonis’ rendering of the phrase, “<a name="xiii.v-p8.2"></a>cibus nobilium, scilicet principum; hoc est, cibus exquisitus, delicatus, eximius.” Such also is the view taken by Fry, Walford, and others. If by <a name="xiii.v-p8.3"></a>אבירים, <i>abbirim</i>,<i> the mighty</i>,<i> 				  </i>angels should be understood, as it is rendered in all the ancient versions, the meaning will be substantially the same; for the manna, by an obvious poetical figure, may be called <i>the bread of angels</i>, to denote food of the most exquisite kind; just as Paul speaks of <i>the tongues of angels</i>,<i> 				  </i>(<a name="xiii.v-p8.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001">1Co 13:1</a><a name="xiii.v-p8.4"></a>,) to indicate eloquence of the highest order.</p>

The Chaldee has “a mixture of living creatures of the wood.” “<i>A mixture</i>; a mixed collection of beasts,” says Bythner. In our English Bible, it is “divers sorts of flies.” Others read, “swarms of flies.” Bishop Mant reads, “the ravening 						fly;” Fry, simply “the fly;” and Walford, “the horse-fly.” “The Seventy,” says Mant, “have rendered the original word translated ‘fly,’ when spoken of the Egyptian plague, constantly by <a name="xiii.ix-p4.6"></a>κυνομυία, ‘the dog-fly;’ whence it is plain those translators thought it meant some particular species of fly, in opposition to those who are of opinion that it meant 						‘all sorts of flies.’ (See Parkhurst on <a name="xiii.ix-p4.7"></a>ערב.) What particular species was intended has been much doubted. Bruce, however, seems to have decided the question, and fixed the insect to be the Ethiopian fly, called Zimb, of which he has given a particular description. Some of its effects are thus represented by him. ‘As soon as this plague appears, and their buzzing is heard, all the cattle 						forsake their food, and run wildly about the plain, till they die, worn out with fatigue, fright, and hunger. No remedy remains but to leave the black earth, and hasten down to the sands of Atbara; and there they remain, while the rains last, this cruel enemy not daring to pursue them further. Though his size be immense, as is his strength, and his body covered with a thick skin, defended with strong hair, yet even the camel is not capable of sustaining the violent punctures the fly makes with 						his pointed proboscis. When once attacked by this fly, his body, head, and legs, break out into large bosses, which swell, break, and putrefy, to the certain destruction of the creature. Even the elephant and rhinoceros, which, by reason of their enormous bulk, and the vast quantity of food and water they daily need, cannot shift to desert and dry places, as the season may require, are obliged to roll themselves in mud and mire; which, when dry, coats them over like armor, and enables them to 						stand their ground against this winged assassin.’” — <i>Mant</i></p>

But we are so little acquainted with the various kinds of destructive insects that ravage the Eastern countries, that it is somewhat difficult to determine the particular species meant by this term. It is distinguished from the locust in Solomon’s prayer at 						the dedication of the temple, <a name="xiii.ix-p5.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#028">2Ch 6:28</a><a name="xiii.ix-p5.3"></a>, and in <a name="xiii.ix-p5.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004">Joe 1:4</a><a name="xiii.ix-p5.4"></a>, where it is mentioned as eating up what the locusts had left. Harmer is of opinion that it is the species of insects now called <i>sim </i>in Persia, referred to in the 						following extract from Sir John Chardin’s Travels: — “Persia is subject to have its harvests spoiled by hail, by drought, or by insects, either locusts or small insects which they call <i>sim</i>, which are small white lice, which fix themselves on the foot of the stalk of corn, gnaw it, and make it die. It is rare for a year to be exempt from one or other of these scourges, which affect the ploughed 						lands and the gardens,” etc. On this Harmer observes, “The enumeration by Solomon and that of this modern writer, though not exactly alike, yet so nearly resemble each other, that one would be inclined to believe these small insects are what Solomon meant by the word [<a name="xiii.ix-p5.5"></a>חסיל, <i>chasil</i>] translated ‘caterpillars’ in our English version.” — 						<i>Harmer</i>’<i>s Observations</i>, volume 3, page 316. <a name="xiii.ix-p5.6"></a>חסיל,<i> chasil</i>, is rendered <a name="xiii.ix-p5.7"></a>βρουχος by the LXX., in <a name="xiii.ix-p5.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#028">2Ch 6:28</a><a name="xiii.ix-p5.8"></a>, and by Aquila here, and also by the Vulgate in Chronicles and in <a name="xiii.ix-p5.9"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004">Isa 33:4</a><a name="xiii.ix-p5.9"></a>, and it is rendered by Jerome here, <a name="xiii.ix-p5.10"></a><i>bruchus</i>, “the chaffer,” which every one knows to be a great devourer of the leaves of trees.

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xiii.ix-p6"></a> The Hebrew word here translated “grasshopper” is, <a name="xiii.ix-p6.1"></a>ארבה, <i>arbeh</i>, which properly means “locust.” The locust receives no fewer than ten different names in Scripture, each of which indicates something characteristic. It is 						called <a name="xiii.ix-p6.2"></a>ארבה, <i>arbeh</i>, from its extraordinary fecundity. No animal is more prolific; nor has Providence ever employed an agency more effective in destroying the fruits of the earth. Dr Russell, in his Natural History of Aleppo, observes that locusts “sometimes arrive in such incredible 						multitudes as it would appear fabulous to relate, destroying the whole of the verdure wherever they pass.” A Traveller in Syria says, “That country, together with Egypt, Persia, and almost all the whole middle part of Asia, partakes in another scourge besides volcanoes and earthquakes, and that no less terrible; I mean those clouds of locusts of which travelers have spoken: the quantity of these insects is incredible to any man who has not seen it: the earth is covered by them for several 						leagues round. One may hear at a distance the noise they make in brousing the plants and trees, like an army plundering in secret. It would be better to be concerned with Tartars than these little destructive animals: one might say that fire follows their tract.” — See <i>Parkhurst</i>’<i>s Lexicon </i>on <a name="xiii.ix-p6.3"></a>רבה,4.</p>

It bears fruit resembling the fig, whilst its leaves are like those of the mulberry-tree; whence its name, <a name="xiii.ix-p7.2"></a>συκος, (<a name="xiii.ix-p7.3"></a><i>sycos</i>,) a fig-tree, and, <a name="xiii.ix-p7.4"></a>μωρος, (<a name="xiii.ix-p7.5"></a><i>moros</i>,) a 						mulberry-tree.

Fry also reads “messengers of evil,” and has the following note: “Such is the literal meaning and exact rendering of <a name="xiii.ix-p17.3"></a>מלאכי רעים, and not <i>evil angels</i>, which would be regularly <a name="xiii.ix-p17.4"></a>מלאכים רעים. By these <i>messengers of evil</i>, I make no doubt, no 				  more is meant than Moses and Aaron, who were charged with denunciations of wrath to Pharaoh, previously to the infliction of all the several plagues.” Archbishop Secker, however, observes, that although <a name="xiii.ix-p17.5"></a>מלאכים רעים would be the proper expression for <i>evil angels</i>, yet the plural of 				  <a name="xiii.ix-p17.6"></a>לאכ is sometimes written defectively <a name="xiii.ix-p17.7"></a>מלאכי. The LXX. has, <a name="xiii.ix-p17.8"></a>ἀποστολὢν δἰ ἀγγελων πονηρῶν, “a message by evil angels.”</p>

And sometimes I have known it, when bent, to <i>start aside </i>— regain its quiescent position — to my no small danger; and, in one or two cases, to my injury. This image is frequently used in the Sacred Writings; but no person has understood it, not being acquainted with the Eastern <i>recurved bow</i>, which must be bent the contrary way, in order to be proper for use These Israelites, when brought out of their natural bent, soon recoiled, and relapsed into their former state.”</p>

Previous to that period, Ephraim was in some sort the leading tribe; and the first erection of the tabernacle in Shiloh, whither the tribes went up, gave to the sons of Joseph a kind of metropolitan dignity in Israel. Hence, this period is considered as 						the time of their precedency in the nation. But the children of Ephraim, or Israel, under their precedency, had been faithless to their trust, and in the day of trial, had not answered to their promise and professions.
