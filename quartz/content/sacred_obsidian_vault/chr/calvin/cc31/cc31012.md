 <p><a name="ix.iv-p5"></a><i>And Zacharias said to the angel</i> Next follows the doubt of Zacharias, and the punishment which the Lord inflicted on his unbelief. He had prayed that he might obtain offspring, and now that it is promised, he distrusts, as if he had forgotten his own prayers and faith. It might, at first sight, appear harsh that God is so much offended by 			 his reply. He brings forward his old age as an objection. Abraham did the same; and yet his faith is so highly applauded that Paul declares, he</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ix.iv-p6"></a>“considered not his own body now dead, neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb,” (<a name="ix.iv-p6.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019">Ro 4:19</a><a name="ix.iv-p6.1"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iv-p7"></a>but unhesitatingly relied on the truth and power of God. Zacharias inquires how, or by what proof, he might arrive at certainty. But Gideon was not blamed for twice asking a sign, (<a name="ix.iv-p7.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#017">Judg. 6:17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#037">37</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#039">39</a><a name="ix.iv-p7.1"></a>.) Nay more, we are shortly after this informed of Mary’s objection, 			 <i>How shall this be, since I know not a man? </i>(ver. 34,) which the angel passes over as if it contained nothing wrong. How comes it then that God punishes Zacharias so severely, as if he had been guilty of a very heinous sin? I do acknowledge that, if the words only are considered, either 			 all were equally to blame, or Zacharias did nothing wrong. But as the actions and words of men must be judged from the state of the heart, we ought rather to abide by the judgment of God, to whom the hidden secrets of the heart are naked and opened, (<a name="ix.iv-p7.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#013">Heb 4:13</a><a name="ix.iv-p7.3"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iv-p8"></a>Unquestionably, the Lord beheld in Zacharias something worse than his words may bear, and therefore his anger was kindled against him for throwing back with distrust the promised favor. We have no right, indeed, to lay down a law to God which would not leave him free to punish in one the fault which he pardons in others. But it is very evident that the case of Zacharias was widely different from that of Abraham, or Gideon, or Mary. This does 			 not appear in the words; and therefore the knowledge of it must be left to God, whose eyes pierce the depths of the heart. Thus God distinguishes between Sarah’s laugh (<a name="ix.iv-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#012">Ge 18:12</a><a name="ix.iv-p8.1"></a>) and Abraham’s, (<a name="ix.iv-p8.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017">Ge 17:17</a><a name="ix.iv-p8.2"></a>,) though the one apparently does not differ from the other. The reason why Zacharias doubted was, that, stopping at 			 the ordinary course of nature, he ascribed less than he ought to have done to the power of God. They take a narrow and disparaging view of the works of God, who believe that he will do no more than nature holds out to be probable, as if his hand were limited to our senses or confined to earthly means. But it belongs to faith to believe that more can be done than carnal reason admits. Zacharias had no hesitation with regard to its being the voice of God, but as he looked too exclusively at the 			 world, an indirect doubt arose in his mind if what he had heard would really happen. In that respect he did no slight injury to God, for he went so far as to reason with himself, whether God, who had undoubtedly spoken to him, should be regarded as worthy of credit.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iv-p9"></a>At the same time, we ought to know that Zacharias was not so unbelieving as to turn aside wholly from the faith; for there is a general faith which embraces the promise of eternal salvation and the testimony of a free adoption. On the other hand, when God has once received us into favor, he gives us many special promises, — that he will feed us, will deliver us from dangers, will vindicate our reputation, will protect our life; — and so there 			 is a special faith which answers particularly to each of these promises. Thus, it will sometimes happen, that one who trusts in God for the pardon of his sins, and for salvation, will waver on some point, — will be too much alarmed by the dread of death, too solicitous about daily food, or too anxious about his plans. Such was the unbelief of Zacharias; for while he held the root and foundation of faith, he hesitated only on one point, whether God would give to him a son. Let us know, 			 therefore, that those who are perplexed or disturbed by weakness on some particular occasion do not entirely depart or fall off from the faith, and that, though the branches of faith are agitated by various tempests, it does not give way at the root. Besides, nothing was farther from the intention of Zacharias than to call in question the truth of a divine promise; but while he was convinced generally that God is faithful, he was cunningly drawn by the craft and wiles of Satan to draw a wicked 			 distinction. It is all the more necessary for us to keep diligent watch: for which of us shall be secure against the snares of the devil, when we learn that a man so eminently holy, who had all his life maintained strict watchfulness over himself, was overtaken by them?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iv-p10"></a><a name="ix.iv-p10.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iv-p11"></a><b>19. </b><i>I am Gabriel</i> By these words the angel intimates that it was not his veracity, but that of God who sent him, and whose message he brought, that had been questioned; and so he charges Zacharias with having offered an insult to God. To <i>stand before 			 God</i> signifies to be ready to yield obedience. It implies that he is not a mortal man, but a heavenly spirits — that he did not fly hither at random, but, as became a servant of God, had faithfully performed his duty: and hence it follows that <i>God, </i>the author of the promise, had been treated with indignity and contempt in 			 the person of his ambassador. Of similar import is the declaration of Christ, “<i>he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me,”</i> (<a name="ix.iv-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016">Lu 10:16</a><a name="ix.iv-p11.1"></a>.) Although the preaching of the gospel is not brought to us from heaven by angels, yet, since God attested by so many 			 miracles that he was its author, and since Christ, the Prince and Lord of angels, once published it with his own mouth, (<a name="ix.iv-p11.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002">Heb 1:2</a><a name="ix.iv-p11.2"></a>,) that he might give it a perpetual sanction, its majesty ought to make as deep an impression upon us, as if all the angels were heard loudly proclaiming its attestation from heaven. Nay, the apostle, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, not satisfied with 			 elevating the word of the gospel, which speaks by the mouth of men, to an equality with the law brought by angels, draws an argument from the less to the greater.</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ix.iv-p12"></a>“If the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of rewards” <br> 			 (<a name="ix.iv-p12.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002">Heb 2:2</a><a name="ix.iv-p12.2"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ix.iv-p13"></a><i>“</i>of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God,”<br> 			 (<a name="ix.iv-p13.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029">Heb 10:29</a><a name="ix.iv-p13.2"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iv-p14"></a>whose “voice shakes not the earth only, but also heaven?” (<a name="ix.iv-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026">Heb 12:26</a><a name="ix.iv-p14.1"></a>.) Let us learn to render to God the obedience of faith, which he values more highly than all sacrifices. <i>Gabriel</i> means the 			 strength, or power, or pre-eminence of God, and this name is given to the angel on our account, to instruct us that we must not ascribe to angels any thing of their own, for whatever excellence they possess is from God. The Greek participle, <a name="ix.iv-p14.2"></a>παρεστηκὼς, <i>(standing,) </i>is in the past tense, but everybody knows that the past tense of such verbs is often taken for the present, and particularly when a continued act is expressed. The word <a name="ix.iv-p14.3"></a>εὐαγγελίσασθαι<i> (to convey glad tidings) aggravates</i> the crime of Zacharias; for he was ungrateful to God, 			 who kindly promised a joyful and desirable event.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iv-p15"></a><a name="ix.iv-p15.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iv-p16"></a><b>20.</b> <i>And, behold, thou shalt be dumb</i> It was suitable that this kind of punishment should be inflicted on Zacharias, that, being dumb, he might await the fulfillment of the promise, which, instead of interrupting it by noisy murmurs, he ought to have heard in silence. Faith has its silence 			 to lend an ear to the Word of God. It has afterwards its turn to speak and to answer Amen, according to that passage,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ix.iv-p17"></a>“I will say to them, Thou art my people, and they shall say, <br> 			 Thou art my God,” (<a name="ix.iv-p17.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023">Ho 2:23</a><a name="ix.iv-p17.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iv-p18"></a>But as Zacharias had rashly interrupted the Word of God, he is not allowed this favor of breaking out immediately in thanksgiving, but is denied for a time the use of his tongue, which had been too forward. Yet God is pleased graciously to mitigate the punishment, first, by limiting its duration to ten months, and next by not withholding from Zacharias the favor which he was unworthy to enjoy. With the same gentleness does he 			 treat us every day: for when our faith is weak, and we throw out many obstacles, the truth of God, in continuing to flow toward us, must of necessity break through them with a kind of violence. That is the angel’s meaning, when he reproaches Zacharias with unbelief, and yet declares that those things which Zacharias did not believe would be <i>accomplished in due time</i> And so 			 Zacharias is not a little relieved by learning that his fault has not made void the promise of God, which will afterwards be displayed in a more remarkable manner. It does sometimes happen that, notwithstanding the opposition made by unbelievers, the Lord bestows and fulfils what he had promised to them. We have a remarkable instance of this in King Ahaz, who rejected the promised safety, and yet was delivered from his enemies, (<a name="ix.iv-p18.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#012">Isa 7:12</a><a name="ix.iv-p18.1"></a>.) But that resulted, without any advantage to him, in the salvation of the chosen people. It was otherwise with Zacharias, in whom the Lord chastises, and at the same time pardons, the weakness of faith.</p>
