 <p><a name="xiv.i-p7"></a><b>3.</b><i> And the scribes and Pharisees bring to him.</i> It is plain enough that this passage was unknown anciently to the Greek Churches; and some conjecture that it has been brought from some other place and inserted here. But as it has always been received by the Latin Churches, and is found in many old Greek manuscripts, 			 and contains nothing unworthy of an Apostolic Spirit, there is no reason why we should refuse to apply it to our advantage. When the Evangelist says that <i>the scribes brought to him a woman,</i> he means that it was done by an agreement among them, in order to lay traps for Christ. He expressly mentions <i>the 			 Pharisees,</i> because they were the chief persons in the rank of <i>scribes</i>  In adopting this pretense for slander, they display enormous wickedness, and even their own lips accuse them; for they do not disguise that they have a plain commandment of the Law, and hence it follows that they act 			 maliciously in putting a question as if it were a doubtful matter. But their intention was, to constrain Christ to depart from his office of preaching grace, that he might appear to be fickle and unsteady. They expressly state that adulteresses are condemned by Moses, (<a name="xiv.i-p7.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010">Le 20:10</a><a name="xiv.i-p7.1"></a>,) that they may hold Christ bound by the sentence already given by the Law, for it was not lawful to 			 acquit those whom the Law condemned; and, on the other hand, if he had consented to the Law, he might be thought to be somewhat unlike himself.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.i-p8"></a><a name="xiv.i-p8.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.i-p9"></a><b>6.</b><i> And Jesus stooping down.</i> By this attitude he intended to show that he despised them. Those who conjecture that <i>he wrote </i>this or the other thing, in my opinion, do not understand his meaning. Nor do I approve of the ingenuity of Augustine, who thinks that in this 			 manner the distinction between the Law and the Gospel is pointed out, because Christ did not write on <i>tables of stone</i>, (<a name="xiv.i-p9.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018">Ex 31:18</a><a name="xiv.i-p9.1"></a>,) but on man, who is dust and earth. For Christ rather intended, by doing nothing, to show how unworthy they were of being heard; just as if any person, while 			 another was speaking to him, were to draw lines on the wall, or to turn his back, or to show, by any other sign, that he was not attending to what was said. Thus in the present day, when Satan attempts, by various methods, to draw us aside from the right way of teaching, we ought disdainfully to pass by many things which he holds out to us. The Papists teaze us, to the utmost of their power, by many trifling cavils, as if they were throwing 			 clouds into the air. If godly teachers be laboriously employed in examining each of those cavils, they will begin to weave Penelope’s web;   			  <a name="fr_207"></a><a href="#fn_207"><font size="1">208</font></a>
  			  and therefore delays of this sort, which do nothing but hinder the progress of the Gospel, are wisely disregarded.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.i-p11"></a><a name="xiv.i-p11.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.i-p12"></a><b>7.</b><i> He who is without sin among you.</i> He said this according to the custom of the Law; for God commanded that the witnesses should, with their own hands, put malefactors to death, according to the sentence which had been pronounced on them; that greater caution might be used in bearing testimony, (<a name="xiv.i-p12.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#007">De 17:7</a><a name="xiv.i-p12.1"></a>.) There are many who proceed rashly to overwhelm their brother by perjury, because they do not think that they inflict a deadly wound by their tongue. And this very argument, had weight with those slanderers, desperate as they were; for no sooner do they obtain a sight of it, than they lay aside those fierce passions with which they were swelled when they came. Yet there is this 			 difference between the injunction of the Law and the words of Christ, that in the Law God merely enjoined that they should not condemn a man with the tongue, unless they were permitted to put him to death with their own hands; but here Christ demands from the witnesses perfect innocence, so that no man ought to accuse another of crime, unless he be pure, and free from every fault. Now what he said, at that time, to a few persons, we ought to view as spoken to all, that whoever accuses another, 			 ought to impose on himself a law of innocence; otherwise, we do not pursue wicked actions, but rather are hostile to the persons of men.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.i-p13"></a>In this way, however, Christ appears to take out of the world all judicial decisions, so that no man shall dare to say that he has a right to punish crimes. For shall a single judge be found, who is not conscious of having something that is wrong? Shall a single witness be produced who is not chargeable with some fault? He appears, therefore, to forbid all witnesses to give public testimony, and all judges to occupy the judgment-seat. I reply: 			 this is not an absolute and unlimited prohibition, by which Christ forbids sinners to do their duty in correcting the sins of others; but by this word he only reproves hypocrites, who mildly flatter themselves and their vices, but are excessively severe, and even act the part of felons, in censuring others. No man, therefore, shall be prevented by his own sins from correcting the sins of others, and even from punishing them, when it may be found necessary, provided that both in himself and in 			 others he hate what ought to be condemned; and in addition to all this, every man ought to begin by interrogating his own conscience, and by acting both as witness and judge against himself, before he come to others. In this manner shall we, without hating men, make war with sins.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.i-p14"></a><a name="xiv.i-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.i-p15"></a><b>9.</b><i> And being reproved by their conscience.</i> Here we perceive how great is the power of an evil conscience. Though those wicked hypocrites intended to entrap Christ by their cavils, yet as soon as he pierces their consciences by a single word, shame puts them to flight. This is the hammer with which we must break 			 the pride of hypocrites. They must be summoned to the judgment-seat of God. Though it is possible that the shame, with which they were struck before men, had greater influence over them than the fear of God, still it is a great matter that, of their own accord, they acknowledge themselves to be guilty, when they thus fly away as if they were confounded. It is immediately added,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.i-p16"></a><i>Beginning from the eldest even to the last.</i> Our attention is drawn to this circumstance, that, according as each of them surpassed the others in honorable rank, he was the more quickly moved by his condemnation. And would to God that   			  <a name="fr_208"></a><a href="#fn_208"><font size="1">209</font></a>
  			  our <i>scribes</i>, who in the present day sell their labors to the Pope to make war with Christ, had at least as much modesty as those men; but they are so destitute of shame that, while they have rendered themselves infamous by every detestable crime, they glory in the fact that they are permitted to be as abominable as they choose, without being punished. We ought also to 			 observe how widely this conviction of sin, by which the scribes were affected, differs from true repentance. For we ought to be affected by the judgment of God in such a manner, that we shall not seek a place of concealment to avoid the presence of the Judge, but rather shall go direct to Him, in order to implore his forgiveness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.i-p18"></a><i>Jesus was left alone.</i> This was brought about by the Spirit of wisdom, that those wicked men, having gained nothing by tempting Christ, went away. Nor is there any reason to doubt that we shall succeed in defeating all the contrivances of our enemies, provided that we permit ourselves to be governed by the same Spirit. But it frequently 			 happens that they gain an advantage over us, because, not attending to their snares, we are not careful to take advice, or rather, trusting to our own wisdom, we do not consider how much we need the government of the Holy Spirit. He says that Christ remained <i>alone;</i> not that the people, whom he was formerly teaching, had left him, but because all the <i>scribes</i>, who had brought the adulteress, gave him no farther annoyance. When it is said that <i>the woman</i> remained with Christ, let us learn by this example that there is nothing better for us than to be brought, as guilty, to his tribunal, provided that we surrender ourselves mildly and 			 submissively to his government.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.i-p19"></a><a name="xiv.i-p19.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.i-p20"></a><b>11.</b> <i>Neither do I condemn thee.</i> We are not told that Christ absolutely acquitted the woman, but that he allowed her to go at liberty. Nor is this wonderful, for he did not wish to undertake any thing that did not belong to his office. He bad been sent by the Father to gather <i>the lost sheep</i>, (<a name="xiv.i-p20.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#006">Mt 10:6</a><a name="xiv.i-p20.1"></a>;) and, therefore, mindful of his calling, he exhorts the woman to repentance, and comforts her by a promise of grace. They who infer from this that adultery ought not to be punished with death, must, for the same reason, admit that inheritances ought not to be divided, 			 because Christ refused to arbitrate in that matter between two brothers, (<a name="xiv.i-p20.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#013">Lu 12:13</a><a name="xiv.i-p20.2"></a>.) Indeed, there will be no crime whatever that shall not be exempted from the penalties of the law, if adultery be not punished; for then the door will be thrown open for any kind of treachery, and for poisoning, and murder, and robbery. Besides, the adulteress, when she bears an unlawful child, not only 			 robs the name of the family, but violently takes away the right of inheritance from the lawful offspring, and conveys it to strangers. But what is worst of all, the wife not only dishonors the husband to whom she had been united, but prostitutes herself to shameful wickedness, and likewise violates the sacred covenant of God, without which no holiness can continue to exist in the world.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.i-p21"></a>Yet the Popish theology is, that in this passage Christ has brought to us the Law of grace, by which adulterers are freed from punishment. And though they endeavor, by every method, to efface from the minds of men the grace of God, such grace as is every where declared to us by the doctrine of the Gospel, yet in this passage alone they preach aloud the Law of grace. Why is this, but that they may pollute, with unbridled lust, almost every 			 marriage-bed, and may escape unpunished? Truly, this is the fine fruit  			  <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">210</font></a>
  			 which we have reaped from the diabolical system of celibacy, that they who are not permitted to marry a lawful wife can commit fornication without restraint. But let us remember that, while Christ forgives the sins of men, he does not overturn political order, or reverse the sentences and punishments appointed by the laws.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.i-p23"></a><i>Go, and sin no more.</i> Hence we infer what is the design of the grace of Christ. It is, that the sinner, being reconciled to God, may honor the Author of his salvation by a good and holy life. In short, by the same word of God, when forgiveness is offered to us, we are likewise called to repentance. Besides, though this exhortation looks 			 forward to the future, still it humbles sinners by recalling to remembrance their past life.</p>  <a name="xiv.ii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption20"><a name="xiv.ii-p1"></a><a name="xiv.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012">John 8:12-14</a><a name="xiv.ii-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="xiv.ii-p2"></a><b>12. </b>Therefore Jesus spoke again to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he who followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. <b>13.</b> The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou testifiest concerning thyself, thy testimony is not true.  				   <a name="fr_210"></a><a href="#fn_210"><font size="1">211</font></a>

 <p><a name="xiv.ii-p7"></a><b>12.</b> <i>I am the light of the world.</i> Those who leave out the former narrative, which relates to the adulteress,   			  <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">213</font></a>
  			  connect this discourse of Christ with the sermon which he delivered on the last day of the assembly. It is a beautiful commendation of Christ, when he is called <i>the light of the world;</i> for, since we are all blind by nature, a remedy is offered, by which we may be freed and rescued from darkness and made partakers of the true<i> light</i>  Nor is it only to one person or to another that this benefit is offered, for Christ declares that he is <i>the light of the whole world</i>; for by this universal statement he intended to remove the distinction, not only between Jews 			 and Gentiles, but between the learned and ignorant, between persons of distinction and the common people.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.ii-p9"></a>But we must first ascertain what necessity there is for seeking this <i>light</i>; for men will never present themselves to Christ to be illuminated, until they have known both that <i>this world </i>is darkness, and that they themselves are altogether blind. Let us therefore know that, when 			 the manner of obtaining this light is pointed out to us in Christ, we are all condemned for blindness, and everything else which we consider to be <i>light</i> is compared to darkness, and to a very dark night. For Christ does not speak of it as what belongs to him in common with others, but claims it as being peculiarly his own. Hence it follows, that out of Christ there is not even a 			 spark of true <i>light</i>  There may be some appearance of brightness, but it resembles lightning, which only dazzles the eyes. It must also be observed, that the power and office of illuminating is not confined to the personal presence of Christ; for though he is far removed from us with respect to his body, yet he daily sheds his light upon us, by the doctrine of the Gospel, and by the secret power 			 of his Spirit. Yet we have not a full definition of this light, unless we learn that we are illuminated by the Gospel and by the Spirit of Christ, that we may know that the fountain of all knowledge and wisdom is hidden in him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.ii-p10"></a><i>He who followeth me.</i> To the doctrine he adds an exhortation, which he immediately afterwards confirms by a promise. For when we learn that all who allow themselves to be governed by Christ are out of danger of going astray, we ought to be excited to follow him, and, indeed, by stretching out his hand — as it were — he draws us to him. 			 We ought also to be powerfully affected by so large and magnificent a promise, that they who shall direct their eyes to Christ are certain that, even in the midst of darkness, they will be preserved from going astray; and that not only for a short period, but until they have finished their course. For that is the meaning of the words used in the future tense, <i>he</i> <i>shall not walk in darkness</i>,<i> but shall have the light of life</i>  Such is also the import of this latter clause, in which the perpetuity of <i>life</i> is stated in express terms. 			 We ought not to fear, therefore, lest it leave us in the middle of the journey, for it conducts us even to <i>life</i>  The genitive <i>of life</i>, in accordance with the Hebrew idiom, is employed, instead of the adjective, to denote the effect; as if he had said, 			 <i>the life-giving light</i>  We need not wonder that such gross darkness of errors and superstitions prevails in <i>the world</i>, in which there are so few that have their eyes fixed on Christ.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.ii-p11"></a><a name="xiv.ii-p11.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.ii-p12"></a><b>13.</b> <i>The Pharisees therefore said.</i> They adduce as an objection what is commonly said, that no man ought to be trusted, when speaking in his own cause. For a <i>true testimony </i>is put for “what is lawful and worthy of credit.” In short, they mean that it is of no use for him to speak, unless he bring proof from some other quarter.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.ii-p13"></a><a name="xiv.ii-p13.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.ii-p14"></a><b>14.</b> <i>Though I testify concerning myself.</i> Christ replies, that his testimony possesses sufficient credit and authority, because he is not a private person belonging to the great body of men, but holds a very different station. For when he says, that <i>he knoweth whence he came, and whither he goeth,</i> he thus excludes himself from the ordinary rank of men. The meaning therefore is, that every man is heard with suspicion in his own cause, and it is provided by the laws, that no man shall be believed, when he speaks for his own advantage. But this does not apply to the Son of God, who holds a rank above the whole world; for he is not reckoned as 			 belonging to the rank of men, but has received from his Father this privilege, to reduce all men to obedience to him by a single word.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.ii-p15"></a><i>I know whence I came.</i> By these words he declares that his origin is not from the world, but that he proceeded from God, and therefore that it would be unjust and unreasonable that his doctrine, which is Divine, should be subjected to the laws of men. But as he was at that time clothed with the form of a servant, in consequence of which 			 they despised him on account of the mean condition of the flesh, he sends them away to the future glory of his resurrection, from which his Divinity, formerly hidden and unknown, received a clear demonstration. That intermediate condition, therefore, ought not to have prevented the Jews from submitting to God’s only ambassador, who had been formerly promised to them in the Law.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.ii-p16"></a><i>But you know not whence I came, and whither I go.</i> He means that his glory is not at all diminished by their unbelief. Again, as he has given the same testimony to us, our faith ought to despise all the reports and slanders of wicked men; for it cannot be founded upon God without rising 			 far above the loftiest pride of the world. But in order that we may perceive the majesty of his Gospel, we ought always to direct our eyes to the heavenly glory of the Son of God,   			  <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">214</font></a>
  			  and to hear him speaking in the world, so as to remember <i>whence he came</i>, and what authority he now possesses, after having discharged his embassy. For as he humbled himself for a time, so now he is highly exalted   			  <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_214"><font size="1">215</font></a>
  			  at the right hand of the Father, <i>that every knee may bow to him</i>, (<a name="xiv.ii-p18.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010">Php 2:10</a><a name="xiv.ii-p18.2"></a>.)</p>  <a name="xiv.iii"></a>

 <p><a name="xiv.iii-p6"></a><b>15.</b> <i>You judge according to the flesh.</i> This may be explained in two ways; either that they<i> judge according to</i> the wicked views of <i>the 			 flesh</i>, or that they <i>judge according</i> to the appearance of the person. For <i>the flesh</i> sometimes denotes the outward appearance of a man; and both meanings agree well with 			 this passage, since wherever either the feelings of <i>the flesh </i>prevail, or a regard to the person regulates the judgment, neither truth nor justice dwells. But I think that the meaning will be more certain, if you contrast <i>the flesh </i>with <i>the Spirit</i>, understanding his meaning to be, that they are not 			 lawful and competent judges, because they have not the Spirit for their guide.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.iii-p7"></a><i>I judge no man.</i> Here, too, commentators differ. Some distinguish it thus, that <i>he</i> <i>does not judge</i> as man. Others refer it to the 			 time, that while he was on earth, he did not undertake the office of a <i>Judge</i>  Augustine gives both expositions, but does not decide between them. But the former distinction cannot at all apply. For this sentence contains two clauses, that Christ <i>does not judge</i>, and that <i>if he judge</i>,<i> his judgment is solid and just</i>, because it is divine. As to the former clause, therefore, in which he says that <i>he does not judge</i>, I confine it to what belongs peculiarly to this passage. For in order the more fully to convict his enemies of pride, he employs this comparison, that they unjustly assume the liberty to <i>judge,</i> and yet cannot condemn him, while he merely teaches and abstains from performing the office of a <i>judge.</i></p>

Now the authority arises from this consideration, that he does nothing but according to the commandment of the Father.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.iii-p10"></a><i>For I am not alone.</i> This phrase amounts to an affirmative, that he is not one of the ordinary rank of men, but that he must be considered along with the office which was assigned to him by the Father. But why does he not rather make an open assertion of his Divinity, as he might truly and justly have done? The reason is, that as his 			 Divinity was concealed under the veil of the flesh, he brings forward his Father, in whom it was more manifest. Still, the object of the discourse is, to show that all that he does and teaches ought to be accounted Divine.</p>

 <p><a name="xiv.iii-p12"></a><b>17.</b> <i>Even in your law it is written.</i> The argument might, at first sight, appear to be weak, because no man is received as a witness in his own cause.

  			  ought to be excluded from the ordinary number of other men,   			  <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">218</font></a>
  			  because he neither is a private individual, nor transacts his own private business. As to his distinguishing himself from his Father, by doing so he accommodates himself to the capacity of his hearers, and that on account of his office, because he was at that time a servant of the Father, from whom, therefore, he asserts that all his doctrine has proceeded.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.iii-p15"></a><a name="xiv.iii-p15.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.iii-p16"></a><b>19.</b> <i>Where is thy father</i>? There can be no doubt whatever, that it was in mockery that they inquired about <i>his Father</i>  For not only do they, with their wonted 			 pride, treat contemptuously what he had said about <i>the Father</i>, but they likewise ridicule him for talking loftily about <i>his Father</i>, as if he had drawn his birth from heaven. By these words, therefore, they mean that they do not value so highly Christ’s <i>Father</i>, as to ascribe any thing to the Son on his account. And the reason why there are so many in the present day who, with daring presumption, despise Christ, is, that few consider that God has sent him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.iii-p17"></a><i>You neither know me nor my Father.</i> He does not deign to give them a direct reply, but in a few words reproaches them with the ignorance in which they flattered themselves. They inquired about <i>the Father</i>; and yet when they had the Son before their eyes, <i>seeing</i>,<i> they did not see</i>, (<a name="xiv.iii-p17.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#013">Mt 13:13</a><a name="xiv.iii-p17.1"></a>.) It was therefore a just punishment of their pride and wicked ingratitude, that they who despised the Son of God, who had been 			 familiarly offered to them, never approached to <i>the Father</i>  For how shall any mortal man ascend to the height of God, unless he be raised on high by the hand of his Son? God in Christ condescended to the mean condition of men, so as to stretch out his hand; and do not those who reject God, when he thus approaches to them, deserve to be excluded from heaven?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.iii-p18"></a>Let us know that the same thing is spoken to us all; for whoever aspires to know God, and does not begin with Christ, must wander — as it were — in a labyrinth; for it is not without good reason that Christ is called the image of the Father, as has been already said. Again, as all who, leaving Christ, attempt to rise to heaven, after the manner of <i>the giants</i>,  			  <a name="fr_218"></a><a href="#fn_218"><font size="1">219</font></a>
  			 are destitute of all right knowledge of God, so every man who shall direct his mind and all his senses to Christ, will be led straight to the Father. For on good grounds does God declare that,</p>

It was a much frequented place, and hence we infer that this sermon was delivered by Christ amidst a large assembly of men, so that the people had less excuse. 			 The Evangelist likewise holds out to us the astonishing power of God in this respect, that they were constrained to endure Christ openly <i>teaching in the temple,</i> though but lately they sought to seize him, and put him to death. For since they held an undisputed sway <i>in the temple, 			 </i>so that they ruled there with the fierceness of tyrants, they might have banished Christ from it by a single word. And when he ventured to take upon himself the office of a teacher, why do they not instantly lay violent hands on him? We see then that God caused men to hear him, and guarded him by his protection, so that those savage beasts did not touch him, though they had their throats opened to swallow him.   			  <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_220"><font size="1">221</font></a>

The meaning of these words amounts to this. “The wicked will at length feel how great loss they have suffered by rejecting Christ, when he freely offers himself to them. They will feel it, but it will be too late, for there will 			 be no more room for repentance.” And to alarm them still more by showing them that their judgment is near at hand, in the first place, he says that he will soon <i>go</i> <i>away</i>, by which he means that the Gospel is preached to them only for a short time, and that if they allow this opportunity to pass away, <i>the accepted time and 			 the days appointed for salvation </i>(<a name="xiv.iv-p5.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008">Isa 49:8</a><a name="xiv.iv-p5.2"></a>; <a name="xiv.iv-p5.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002">2Co 6:2</a><a name="xiv.iv-p5.3"></a>) will not always last. Thus also, in the present day, when Christ knocks at our door, we ought to go immediately to meet him, lest he be wearied by our slothfulness and withdraw from us. 			 And indeed we have learned, by many experiments in all ages, how greatly this departure of Christ is to be dreaded.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.iv-p6"></a><i>And you shall seek me.</i> We must first ascertain in what manner the persons now spoken of <i>sought Christ</i>; for if they had been truly converted, they would not have <i>sought </i>him in vain; because 			 he has not falsely promised that, as soon as a sinner groans, he will be ready to assist him. Christ does not mean, therefore, that they <i>sought him </i>by the right way of faith, but that they <i>sought him</i>, as men, overwhelmed by the extremity of anguish, look for deliverance on every hand. For unbelievers would desire to have God reconciled to them, 			 but yet they do not cease to fly from him. God calls them; the approach consists in faith and repentance; but they oppose God by hardness of heart, and, overwhelmed with despair, they exclaim against him. In short, they are so far from desiring to enjoy the favor of God, that they do not give him permission to assist them, unless he deny himself, which he will never do.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.iv-p7"></a>In this manner, however wicked the scribes were, they would willingly have applied to themselves the redemption which had been promised by the hand of the Messiah, provided that Christ would transform himself, to suit their natural disposition. Wherefore, by these words Christ threatens and denounces to all unbelievers, that, after having despised the doctrine of the Gospel, they will be seized with such anguish, that they 			 shall be constrained to cry to God, but their howling will be of no avail; because, as we have already said, <i>seeking</i>,<i> they do not seek</i>  And this is still more plainly expressed in the next clause, when he says, <i>you shall die in your sin;</i> for he shows that the cause of their destruction will be, that they were disobedient and rebellious to the very last. What is the nature of <i>their sin</i> we shall presently see.</p>

Shocking stupidity! But thus does Satan 			 infatuate the reprobate, that, intoxicated with more than brutal indifference,   			  <a name="fr_221"></a><a href="#fn_221"><font size="1">222</font></a>
  			  they may throw themselves into the midst of the flame of the wrath of God.

Yet it is certain that this is an affected or sardonic smile, for they are pierced inwardly with unseen wounds; but all on a sudden, like men bereft of their senses, they burst out 			 into furious laughter.</p>

Under the 			 words,<i> world</i> and<i> beneath,</i> he includes all that men naturally possess, and thus points out the disagreement which exists between his Gospel and the ingenuity and sagacity of the human mind; for the Gospel is heavenly wisdom, but our mind grovels on the earth. No man, 			 therefore, will ever be qualified to become a disciple of Christ, till Christ has formed him by his Spirit.

Not that there are no other sins but unbelief,   			  <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="#fn_222"><font size="1">223</font></a>
  			  or that it is unbelief alone which subjects us to the condemnation of eternal death before God, as some men too extravagantly talk; but because it drives us away from Christ, and deprives us of his grace, from which we ought to expect deliverance from all our sins. That the Jews reject the medicine with obstinate malice, is their mortal disease; and hence it arises that the slaves of Satan do not cease to heap up sins on sins, and continually to bring down upon themselves fresh condemnations. And, therefore, he immediately adds, —</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.iv-p16"></a><i>If you do not believe that I am.</i> For there is no other way for lost men to recover salvation, but to betake themselves to Christ. The phrase, <i>that I am</i>, is emphatic; for, in order to make the meaning complete, we must supply all that the 			 Scripture ascribes to the Messiah, and all that it bids us expect from him. But the sum and substance is — the restoration of the Church, the commencement of which is the light of faith, from which proceed righteousness and a new life. Some of the ancient writers have deduced from this passage the Divine essence of Christ; but that is a mistake, for he speaks of his office towards us. This statement is worthy of observation; for men never consider sufficiently the evils in which they are 			 plunged; and though they are constrained to acknowledge their destruction, yet they neglect Christ, and look around them, in every direction, for useless remedies. Wherefore we ought to believe that, until the grace of Christ be manifested to deliver us, nothing but a boundless mass of all evils reigns perpetually in us.   			  <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">224</font></a>

There is no ambiguity of this sort in the Greek, but still the Greek commentators also differ as to the meaning.

  			  “You now,” says he, “have all your senses — as it were — fascinated, and, therefore, you understand nothing of all that I say; but the time will yet come, when you shall know that a Prophet of God has lived among you, and has spoken to you.” This is the manner in which we ought to deal with wicked men; we ought expressly to summon them to the judgment-seat of God. But this knowledge, which Christ speaks of, comes too 			 late, when the reprobate and unbelievers,   			  <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">231</font></a>
  			  dragged to punishment, reluctantly acknowledge that God, to whom they ought mildly to have given honor and reverence, is their Judge. For he does not promise them repentance, but declares that, after they have been struck with new and unexpressed horror at the wrath of God, they will be aroused from that sleep in which they now repose. Thus Adam’s eyes were opened, so that, overwhelmed with shame, he sought in vain for places of concealment, and ultimately was 			 convinced that he was ruined. Yet that knowledge of Adam, which was in itself useless, turned to his advantage through the grace of God; but the reprobate, being overwhelmed with despair, have their eyes opened only for this purpose, that they may perceive their destruction. To this kind of knowledge God conducts them in a variety of ways. Sometimes it happens that, constrained by heavy afflictions, they learn that God is angry with them; sometimes, without any outward punishment, he inwardly 			 torments them; and, at other times, he permits them to sleep until he call them out of the world.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.v-p26"></a>By the term <i>exalt</i> Christ points out his own death. He mentions his death, in order to warn them that, though they destroy him according to the flesh, they will gain nothing by it; as if he had said, “Now you treat me with haughty scorn, while I speak to you; but ere long your wickedness will proceed farther, even 			 so far as to put me to death. Then will you triumph, as if you had gained your wish, but within a short time you shall feel, to your utter ruin, how widely my death differs from destruction.” He employs the word <i>exalt</i>, in order to vex them the more. Their intention was to plunge Christ into the lowest hell. He tells them that they will be completely 			 disappointed, and that the event will be altogether contrary to what they thus expect. He may, indeed, have intended to allude to the outward form of his death, that he was <i>to be lifted up </i>on the cross; but he looked chiefly to the glorious result of it, which soon afterwards followed, contrary to the expectation of all. True, indeed, <i>in the cross </i>itself he gained a splendid triumph over Satan, 			 before God and the angels, by <i>blotting out the hand-writing </i>of sin, and cancelling the condemnation of death, (<a name="xiv.v-p26.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014">Col 2:14</a><a name="xiv.v-p26.1"></a>;) but it was only after that the Gospel had been preached, that this triumph began to be made known to men. The same thing which happened shortly afterwards — that Christ rose out of the grave, and ascended to 			 heaven — is what we ought daily to expect; for, notwithstanding all the contrivances of wicked men to oppress Christ in his Church, not only will he rise in spite of them, but he will turn their wicked efforts into the means of promoting the progress of his kingdom.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.v-p27"></a><i>That I am.</i> I have already stated that this does not refer to Christ’s Divine essence, but to his office; which appears still more clearly from what follows, when he affirms that he does nothing but by the command of the Father; for this means, that he was sent by God, and that he performs his office faithfully.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.v-p28"></a><i>And that I do nothing of myself.</i> That is, I do not put myself forward, to attempt anything rashly. Again, the word <i>speak,</i> refers to the same thing, that is, to the office of teaching; for when Christ wishes to prove that he 			 does nothing but by the commandment of the Father, he says that he <i>speaks </i>as he has been taught by Him. The meaning of the words, therefore, may be summed up thus: In the whole of these proceedings, which you condemn, no part is my own, but I only execute what God has enjoined upon me; the words which you hear from my mouth are his words, and my calling, of which He is the Author, is directed by him alone. Let us remember, however, what I have 			 sometimes mentioned already, that these words are accommodated to the capacity of the hearers. For, since they thought that Christ was only one of the ordinary rank of men, he asserts that whatever in him is Divine is not his own; meaning that it is not of man or by man; because the Father teaches us by him, and appoints him to be the only Teacher of the Church; and for this reason he affirms that <i>he has been taught by the Father</i></p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.v-p29"></a><a name="xiv.v-p29.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.v-p30"></a><b>29. </b><i>And he who hath sent me is with me.</i> He again boasts that God, under whose guidance and authority he does every thing, will assist him, so that he shall not labor in vain and to no purpose, as if he had said, that the power of the Spirit of God accompanies his ministry. All faithful teachers ought to be endued 			 with the same confidence, so as to entertain no doubt that the hand of God will be near them, when, with a pure conscience, they discharge such a ministry as he demands. For God does not furnish them with his word, in order that they may strike the air with an idle and useless sound, but makes his word successful by the secret efficacy of his Spirit, and at the same time guards them by his protection, that, when their enemies shall have been subdued, they may remain invincible against the whole 			 world. And, indeed, if they judge of themselves and their own powers, they must give way every hour; so that the only method of pursuing is, to be convinced that they are supported by the hand of God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.v-p31"></a><i>Because I do always the things which please him.</i> We must observe the reason why Christ declares that God is on his side, and that he will never be deprived of his assistance. It is, because he is regulated entirely by his will, and serves him in sincerity. For this is what he means by the word <i>always,</i> that he does not obey God only in part, but is entirely and unreservedly devoted to his service. Wherefore, if we desire to enjoy the same presence of God, our whole reason must be subjected to his authority; for if our senses hold the government in any degree, all our exertions will be fruitless, because the blessing of God will not be on them. And though for a time we may be delighted with the joyful prospect of 			 success, yet the final result will be dismal.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.v-p32"></a><i>The Father hath not left me alone</i>  By these words, he indirectly complains of the treachery of his nation, in which he found scarcely any that gave him their support. Yet he shows that he reckons this alone to be abundantly sufficient, that he has God to protect him. Such is the courage with which we ought to be 			 animated in the present day, that we may not give way on account of the small number of believers; for, though the whole world be opposed to his doctrine, still we <i>are not alone</i>  Hence, too, it is evident how foolish is the boasting of the Papists, who, while they neglect God, proudly boast of their vast numbers.</p>  <a name="xiv.vi"></a>

When 			 he says that they who are firmly rooted <i>in his word</i>, so as <i>to continue </i>in him, <i>will truly be his disciples</i>, he means that many profess to be <i>disciples </i>who yet are not so in reality, and have no right 			 to be accounted such. He distinguishes his followers from hypocrites by this mark, that they who falsely boasted of faith give way as soon as they have entered into the course, or at least in the middle of it; but believers persevere constantly to the end. If, therefore, we wish that Christ should reckon us to be his disciples, we must endeavor to persevere.</p>

But the statement is general. Wherefore, whatever progress any of us have made in the Gospel, let him know that he needs new additions. This is the reward which Christ bestows on their perseverance, that he admits them to greater familiarity with him; though in this way he does nothing more than add another gift to the former, so that no man ought to 			 think that he is entitled to any reward. For it is he who impresses his word on our hearts by his Spirit, and it is he who daily chases away from our minds the clouds of ignorance which obscure the brightness of the Gospel. In order that the truth may be fully revealed to us, we ought sincerely and earnestly to endeavor to attain it. It is the same unvarying truth which Christ teaches his followers from the beginning to the end, but on those who were at first enlightened by him, as it were with 			 small sparks, he at length pours a full light. Thus believers, until they have been fully confirmed, are in some measure ignorant of what they know; and yet it is not so small or obscure a knowledge of faith as not to be efficacious for salvation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.vi-p13"></a><i>The truth shall make you free.</i> He commends the knowledge of the Gospel from the fruit which we derive from it, or — which is the same thing — from its effect, namely, that it restores us to <i>freedom</i>  This is an invaluable blessing. Hence it follows, that nothing is more excellent or desirable than the knowledge of the Gospel. All men feel and acknowledge that <i>slavery </i>is a very wretched state; and since the Gospel delivers us from it, it follows that we derive from the Gospel the treasure of a blessed life.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.vi-p14"></a>We must now ascertain what kind of liberty is here described by Christ, namely, that which <i>sets us free</i> from the tyranny of Satan, sin, and death. And if we obtain it by means of the Gospel, it is evident from this that we are by nature the <i>slaves </i>of sin. Next, 			 we must ascertain what is the method of our deliverance. For so long as we are governed by our sense and by our natural disposition, we are <i>in bondage </i>to sin; but when the Lord regenerates us by his Spirit, he likewise <i>makes us free</i>, so that, loosed from the snares of Satan, we willingly obey righteousness. But regeneration proceeds from faith, 			 and hence it is evident that freedom proceeds from the Gospel.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.vi-p15"></a>Let Papists now go and proudly vaunt of their free-will, but let us, who are conscious of our own slavery, glory in none but Christ our Deliverer. For the reason why the Gospel ought to be reckoned to have achieved our deliverance is, that it offers and gives us to Christ <i>to be freed </i>from the yoke of sin. Lastly, we ought to observe, that <i>freedom </i>has its degrees according to the measure of their faith; and therefore Paul, 			 though clearly <i>made free</i>, still groans and longs after perfect freedom, (<a name="xiv.vi-p15.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024">Ro 7:24</a><a name="xiv.vi-p15.1"></a>.)</p>

  			  or others. My opinion is, that they replied to Christ in a confused manner, as usually happens in a promiscuous crowd; and that this reply was made rather by despisers than by those who believed. It is a mode of expression very customary in Scripture, whenever the body of a people is mentioned, to ascribe generally to all what belongs only to a part.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.vi-p19"></a>Those who object that they are <i>Abraham</i>’<i>s seed</i>,<i> and have always been free</i>, easily inferred from the words 			 of Christ that <i>freedom </i>was promised to them as to people who were <i>slaves</i>  But they cannot endure to have it said that they, who are a holy and elect people, are reduced to <i>slavery</i>  For of what avail was <i>the adoption and the 			 covenant</i>, (<a name="xiv.vi-p19.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004">Ro 9:4</a><a name="xiv.vi-p19.1"></a>,) by which they were separated from other nations, but because they were accounted the children of God? They think, therefore, that they are insulted, when <i>freedom is </i>exhibited to them as a blessing which they do not yet possess. But it might be 			 thought strange that they should maintain that they <i>never were enslaved,</i> since they had been so frequently oppressed by various tyrants, and at that time were subjected to the Roman yoke, and groaned under the heaviest burden of <i>slavery</i>; and hence it may be easily seen how foolish 			 was their boasting.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.vi-p20"></a>Yet they had this plausible excuse, that the unjust sway of their enemies did not hinder them from continuing to be <i>free</i> by right. But they erred, first, in this respect, that they did not consider that the right of adoption was founded on the Mediator alone; for how comes it that <i>Abraham’s seed</i> is <i>free</i>, but because, by the extraordinary grace of the Redeemer, it is exempted from the general bondage of the human race? But there was another error less tolerable than the former, that, though they were altogether degenerate, yet they 			 wished to be reckoned among the children of <i>Abraham</i>, and did not consider that it is nothing else than the regeneration of the Spirit that makes them lawful <i>children of Abraham</i>  And indeed, it has been too common a vice in almost all ages, to refer to the 			 origin of the flesh the extraordinary gifts of God, and to ascribe to nature those remedies which Christ bestows for correcting nature. Meanwhile, we see how all who, swelled with false confidence, flatter themselves on their condition drive away from them the grace of Christ. And yet this pride is spread over the whole world, so that there is scarcely one person in a hundred who feels that he needs the grace of God.</p>

He proves that they are the <i>slaves of sin,</i> because, being enslaved by the desires of the flesh, they continually sin. It is astonishing that men are not convinced by their own experience, so that, laying aside their pride, they may learn to be humble. And it is a very frequent occurrence in the present day, that, the greater the load of vices by which a man is weighed down, the more fiercely does he utter unmeaning words in extolling free-will.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.vi-p23"></a>Christ appears to say nothing more here than what was formerly said by philosophers, that they who are devoted to their lusts are subject to the most degrading <i>slavery</i>. But there is a deeper and more hidden meaning; for he does not argue what evil men bring on themselves, but what is the condition of human nature. The philosophers thought that any man is a <i>slave </i>by his own choice, and that by the same choice he returns to 			 <i>freedom</i>. But here Christ maintains, that all who are not delivered by him are in a state of <i>slavery</i>, and that all who derive the contagion of sin from corrupted nature are <i>slaves </i>from their birth. We must attend to the comparison between grace and nature, on which Christ here dwells; from which it may be easily seen that men are destitute of freedom, unless they regain it from some other quarter. Yet this <i>slavery </i>is voluntary, so that they who 			 necessarily sin are not compelled to sin.</p>

For what he possesses as his own by nature he imparts to us by adoption, when we are ingrafted by faith into his body, and become his members. Thus we ought to remember what I said formerly, that the Gospel is the instrument by which we obtain our <i>freedom</i>  So then 			 our<i> freedom </i>is a benefit conferred by Christ, but we obtain it by faith, in consequence of which also Christ regenerates us by his Spirit. When he says that they <i>shall be truly free,</i> there is an emphasis on the word <i>truly;</i> for we must supply the contrast with the foolish persuasion by which the Jews were swelled with pride, in like manner as the greater part of the world imagine that they possess a kingdom, while they are in the most wretched bondage.</p>

And yet they rely on nothing but the confidence of the flesh. But carnal descent, without faith, is nothing more than a false pretense. We now understand what it was that so greatly 			 blinded them, so that they treated Christ with disdain, though armed with deadly thunder. Thus the word of God, which might move stones, is ridiculed in the present day by Papists, as if it were a fable, and fiercely persecuted by fire and sword; and for no other reason but that they rely on their false title of “the Church,” and hope that they will be able to deceive both God and man.

  			  for he refuses to give the very name to all who do not resemble <i>Abraham</i>  True, it frequently happens that <i>children</i> do not resemble, in their conduct, the parents from whom they are sprung; but here Christ does not 			 argue about carnal descent, but only affirms that they who do not retain by faith the grace of adoption are not reckoned among <i>the children of Abraham</i> before God. For since God promised to the seed of Abraham that he would be their God, saying,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xiv.vii-p8"></a>I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, <br> 			 (<a name="xiv.vii-p8.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007">Ge 17:7</a><a name="xiv.vii-p8.2"></a>,)</p>

Christ denies this, and justly; for they who are the children of the promise must be born again by the Spirit, and all who desire to obtain a place in the kingdom of God ought to be new creatures. Carnal descent from Abraham was not indeed useless, and of no value, provided that the truth were added to it. For election dwells in the seed of Abraham, but it is free, so that all whom God sanctifies by his Spirit are accounted heirs of life.</p>

But they erred grievously in this respect, that they imagined that God was bound to the whole seed of Abraham. For they reason thus: “God adopted for 			 himself the family of Abraham; therefore, since we are Abraham’s descendants, we must be the children of God.” We now see how they thought that they had holiness from the womb, because they were sprung from a holy root. In short, they maintain that they are the family of God, because they are descended from the holy fathers. In like manner, the Papists in the present day are exceedingly vain of an uninterrupted succession from the fathers.

Hypocritical religion, indeed, presumptuously shelters itself under the name of God; but how can they agree with the Father who disagree with his only Son?

He calls them <i>children of the devil</i>, not only because they imitate him, but because they are led by his instigation to fight against Christ. For as we are called <i>the 			 children of God</i>, not only because we resemble him, but because he governs us by his Spirit, because Christ lives and is vigorous in us, so as to conform us to the image of his Father; so, on the other hand, the devil is said to be the<i> father</i> or those whose 			 understandings he blinds, whose hearts he moves to commit all unrighteousness, and on whom, in short, he acts powerfully and exercises his tyranny; as in <a name="xiv.viii-p9.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004">2Co 4:4</a><a name="xiv.viii-p9.1"></a>; <a name="xiv.viii-p9.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002">Eph 2:2</a><a name="xiv.viii-p9.2"></a>, and in other passages.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.viii-p10"></a>The Manicheans foolishly and ineffectually abused this passage to prove their absurd tenets. For since, when Scripture calls us the children of God, this does not refer to the transmission or origin of the substance, but to the grace of the Spirit, which regenerates us to newness of life; so this swing of Christ does not relate to the transmission of substance, but to the corruption of nature, of which man’s revolt was the cause and origin. 			 When men, therefore, are born children of the devil, it must not be imputed to creation, but to the blame of sin. Now Christ proves this from the effect, because they willingly, and of their own accord, are disposed to follow the devil.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.viii-p11"></a><i>He was a murderer from the beginning.</i> He explains what are those desires, and mentions two instances, cruelty and falsehood; in which the Jews too much resembled Satan. When he says that the devil <i>was a 			 murderer</i>, he means that he contrived the destruction of man; for as soon as man was created, Satan, impelled by a wicked desire of doing injury, bent his strength to destroy him. Christ does not mean <i>the beginning</i> of the creation, as if God implanted in him the disposition to do injury; but he 			 condemns in Satan the corruption of nature, which he brought upon himself. This appears more clearly from the second clause, in which he says,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.viii-p12"></a><i>He did not remain in the truth.</i> For though those who imagine that the devil was wicked by nature, endeavor to make evasions, yet these words plainly state that there was a change for the worse, and that the reason why Satan was <i>a liar </i>was, that <i>he revolted 			 from the truth</i>  That he is <i>a liar</i>, arises not from his nature having been always contrary to truth, but because he fell from it by a voluntary fall. This description of Satan is highly useful to us, that every person for himself may endeavor to beware of his snares, and, at the same time, to repel his violence and fury; 			 for</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xiv.viii-p13"></a>he goeth about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour, <br> 			 (<a name="xiv.viii-p13.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008">1Pe 5:8</a><a name="xiv.viii-p13.2"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.viii-p14"></a>and has a thousand stratagems at his command for deceiving. So much the more ought believers to be supplied with spiritual arms for fighting, and so much the more earnestly ought they to keep watch with vigilance and sobriety. Now, if Satan cannot lay aside this disposition, we ought not to be alarmed at it, as if it were a new and uncommon occurrence, when errors exceedingly numerous and varied spring up; for Satan stirs up his followers 			 like bellows, to deceive the world by their impostures. And we need not wonder that Satan puts forth such strenuous efforts to extinguish the light of <i>truth</i>; for it is the only life of the soul. So, then, the most important and most deadly wound for killing the soul is<i> falsehood</i>. As all who have eyes to see perceive, in the present day, such a picture of Satan in Popery, they ought, first, to consider with what enemy they carry on war, and, next, to betake themselves 			 to the protection of Christ their Captain, under whose banner they fight.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.viii-p15"></a><i>Because the truth is not in him.</i> This statement, which immediately follows the other, is a confirmation <i>a posteriori</i>, as the phrase is; that is, it is drawn from the effect. For Satan hates the truth, and therefore cannot endure it, 			 but, on the contrary, is entirely covered with falsehoods. Hence Christ infers, that he is entirely fallen from the truth, and entirely turned away from it. Let us not wonder, therefore, if he daily exhibits the fruits of his apostacy.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.viii-p16"></a><i>When he speaketh falsehood.</i> These words are generally explained as if Christ affirmed that the blame of <i>falsehood</i> does not belong to God, who is the Author of nature, but, on the contrary, 			 proceeds from corruption. But I explain it more simply, that it is customary with the devil to speak <i>falsehood</i>, and that he knows nothing but to contrive corruptions, frauds, and delusions. And yet we justly infer from these words, that the devil has this vice from himself, and that, while it is peculiar to him, it may likewise be said to be accidental; 			 for, while Christ makes the devil to be the contriver of <i>lying</i>, he evidently separates him from God, and even declares him to be contrary to God. For <i>he is a liar</i>,<i> and the father of it</i>  The word<i> father </i>has the same object as the preceding statement; for the reason why Satan is said to be the father <i>of falsehood</i> is, because he is estranged from God, in whom alone truth dwells, and from whom it flows as from the only fountain.</p>

 <p><a name="xiv.ix-p6"></a><b>46.</b> <i>Which of you?</i> This question proceeds from perfect confidence; for, knowing that they could not justly bring any reproach against him, he glories over his enemies, as having obtained a victory. And yet he does not say that he is free from their slanders; for, though they had no reason 			 for reproaching, still they did not cease to pour out slanders on Christ; but he means that no crime dwells in him. And such is the import of the Greek word <a name="xiv.ix-p6.1"></a>ἐλέγχειν, as the Latins use <i>coarguere</i>, (<i>to convict</i>,) when a person is held <i>convicted </i>of the fact. <i>Which of you Convicteth me of sin?</i> Yet those who think that Christ here asserts his complete innocence, because he alone surpassed all men, so far as he was the Son of God, are mistaken. For this defense must be restricted to what belongs to the 			 passage, as if he had asserted that nothing could be brought forward to show that he was not a faithful servant of God. In like manner Paul also glories that he is not conscious of any crime (<a name="xiv.ix-p6.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004">1Co 4:4</a><a name="xiv.ix-p6.2"></a>;) for that does not extend to the whole life, but is only a defense of his doctrine and apostleship. It is away from the subject, therefore, to speculate, as some do, about the 			 perfection of righteousness which belongs to the Son of God alone; since the only object which he has in view is, to give authority to his ministry, as appears more clearly from what follows; for he again adds immediately afterwards, <i>If I speak truth, why do you not believe me?</i> From which we infer that Christ is rather defending his doctrine than his person.</p>

 <p><a name="xiv.ix-p8"></a><b>47.</b> <i>He who is of God.</i> As he has a full right to take this for granted, that he is the ambassador of the heavenly Father, and that he discharges faithfully the office which has been committed to him, he kindles into greater indignation against them; for their impiety was no longer 			 concealed, since they were so obstinate in rejecting the word of God. He had showed that they could not bring forward any thing which he had not taught as from the mouth of God. He concludes, therefore, that they have nothing in common with God, for they do not hear the words of God;   			  <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">242</font></a>
  			  and, without saying any thing about himself, he charges them with being at war with God. Besides, we are taught by this passage, that there is not a more evident sign of a reprobate mind, than when one cannot endure the doctrine of Christ, even though, in other respects, it shone with angelic sanctity; as, on the contrary, if we embrace that doctrine cheerfully, we have what may be called a visible seal of our election. For he who has the word enjoys God himself; 			 but he who rejects it excludes himself from righteousness and life. Wherefore, there is nothing which we ought to fear so much as to fall under that dreadful sentence.</p>

  			  Besides, though they bring a double reproach against Christ, still they wish to do nothing more than to say in a few words, that he is a detestable man, and that he is actuated by a wicked spirit. The Jews reckoned <i>the Samaritans </i>to be apostates and corrupters of the Law; and therefore, whenever they wished to stamp a man with infamy, they called him <i>a 			 Samaritan.</i> Having no crime more heinous, therefore, to reproach Christ with, they seize at random, and without judgment, this vulgar taunt. To express it in a few words, we see that with effrontery they curse him, as men are wont to do when, infuriated like enraged dogs, they cannot find any thing to say.</p>

 <p><a name="xiv.ix-p14"></a><b>49.</b> <i>I have not a devil.</i> He passes by the first charge, and clears himself only of the second. Some think that he did so, because he disregarded the insult offered to his person, and undertook only the defense of the doctrine. But they are mistaken, in my opinion; for it is not probable 			 that the Jews were so ingenious in distinguishing between the life and the doctrine of the Lord Jesus.   			  <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">244</font></a>
  			  Besides, the dislike of this name arose, as we have said, from this circumstance, that the <i>Samaritans</i>, being perverse and degenerate observers of the Law, had debased it by many superstitions and corruptions, and had polluted the whole worship of God by foreign inventions. Augustine flies to allegory, and says that Christ did not refuse to be called a <i>Samaritan</i>, because he is a true guardian of his flock. But Christ’s intention appears to me to have been different; for since the two reproaches cast upon him had the same object, by refuting the one, he refutes the other; and, indeed, if the matter be duly considered, they insulted him more grievously by calling him <i>a Samaritan</i> than by calling him <i>a demoniac</i>  But, as I have already said, Christ satisfies himself with a simple refutation, which he draws from what is contrary, when he asserts that he labors to promote the honor of his Father; for he who duly and sincerely honors him must be guided by the Spirit of God, and must be a faithful servant of God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.ix-p16"></a><i>You have dishonored me.</i> This clause may be explained, as if it were a complaint of Christ, that he does not receive the honor due to him on account of his promoting the glory of God. But I think that he looks much higher, and connects the glory of the Father with his own, in this manner. “I claim nothing for myself which does not tend 			 to the glory of God; for his majesty shines in me, his power and authority dwells in me; and therefore, when you treat me so disdainfully, you pour contempt on God himself.” He immediately adds, therefore, that God will revenge this insult. For they might have alleged that he was ambitious, if he had not testified that it was not from any personal feelings of a carnal nature that he cared about the honor or contempt showed to himself, but so far as the honor or contempt of God is concerned. 			 Besides, though we are at a great distance from Christ, let every man be fully convinced that, if he be sincerely desirous to promote the glory of God, he will find that God has secured for him abundant commendation; for we shall always find that saying to be true,</p>

For this reason, he intended to terrify the wicked whose malice was desperate, but to do so in such a manner as to leave ground of consolation for 			 the good, or to draw to him those who were not yet ruined. Whatever dislike of the word of God, therefore, may be entertained by the greatest part of men, yet the faithful teacher ought not to be wholly employed in reproving the wicked, but ought also to impart the doctrine of salvation to the children of God, and endeavor to bring them to sound views, if there be any of them who are not perfectly incurable. In this passage, therefore, Christ promises eternal life to his disciples, but demands 			 disciples who shall not only prick up their ears, like asses, or profess with the mouth that they approve of his doctrine, but who shall keep his doctrine as a precious treasure. He says that <i>they shall never see death</i>; for, when faith quickens the soul of a man, death already has its sting extracted and its venom removed, and so cannot inflict a deadly wound.</p>

Some think that they slanderously torture his words, by using the expression,<i> taste of death</i>, which Christ had not used; but this appears to me to be groundless. I rather think that both of the phrases, <i>to</i> <i>taste of death </i>and <i>to see death</i>, were used by the Hebrews in the same 			 sense; namely, <i>to die</i>  But they are false interpreters in this respect, that they apply the spiritual doctrine of Christ to the body. No believer <i>shall see death</i>, because believers, <i>having been born again of incorruptible seed</i>, (<a name="xiv.x-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023">1Pe 1:23</a><a name="xiv.x-p8.1"></a>,) live even when they die; because, united to Christ their Head, they cannot be extinguished by death; because <i>death </i>is to them a passage into the heavenly kingdom; because</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xiv.x-p9"></a>the Spirit, dwelling in them, is life on account of righteousness, <br> 			 (<a name="xiv.x-p9.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010">Ro 8:10</a><a name="xiv.x-p9.2"></a>,)</p>

They act unjustly and absurdly, therefore, in contrasting the servants with the Lord; and they even act improperly towards <i>Abraham and the Prophets</i>, by abusing their name in opposition to Christ. But this 			 wickedness has prevailed in almost every age, and prevails even in the present day, that wicked men, by mangling the works of God, make him appear to be contrary to himself. God glorified himself by the Apostles and Martyrs; the Papists frame idols for themselves out of the Apostles and Martyrs, that they may occupy the place of God; and do they not, in this manner, manufacture engines out of the very favors of God, to destroy his power? For how little remains for God or for Christ, if the 			 saints have all that the Papists so lavishly bestow upon them! Wherefore, we ought to know that the whole order of the Kingdom of God is destroyed, unless Prophets, Apostles, and all that can be called Saints, be placed far below Christ, that he alone may hold the highest rank. And, indeed, we cannot speak of the Saints more respectfully than when we place them below Christ. But the Papists, though they may deceive the ignorant by boasting that they are faithful admirers of the Saints, offer an 			 insult both to God and to them, because, by assigning to them a lofty station, they reduce Christ to a level with them. And, indeed, they are doubly in the wrong, because they prefer the Saints to Christ in doctrine; and because, by clothing themselves with the spoils of Christ, they deprive him of almost all his power.</p>

For here, as in many other passages, he distinguishes between himself and God, by way of concession. In short, he declares that he desires no glory whatever but what has been given him by the Father.

  			  profession of faith. It is that which proceeds from true knowledge. And whence comes that knowledge, but from the word? Consequently, all who boast of the name of God without the word of God are mere liars. Yet to their audacity Christ opposes the assurance of his conscience; and thus all the servants of God ought to be prepared in their hearts to be satisfied with this alone, that God is on their side, though the whole world should rise against him. Thus anciently 			 the Prophets and Apostles had invincible courage and magnanimity, which stood firm against the dreadful attacks of the whole world, because they knew by whom they were sent.

 <p><a name="xiv.xi-p5"></a><b>56.</b> <i>Your father Abraham.</i> He grants to them, in words only, what he formerly took from them, that <i>Abraham is their father</i>  But he shows how idle is the objection drawn from the name of 			 <i>Abraham</i>  “He had no other object,” says he, “during his whole life, than to see my kingdom flourish. He longed for me when I was absent, you despise me when I am present.” What Christ here asserts concerning Abraham alone, applies to all the saints. But this doctrine has greater weight in the person of Abraham, because he is the father of the whole Church. Whoever then desires to be reckoned in 			 the number of the godly, let him rejoice, as he ought to do, in the presence of Christ, for which Abraham ardently longed.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.xi-p6"></a><i>Exulted to see my day.</i> The word <i>exult</i> expresses a vehement zeal   			  <a name="fr_247"></a><a href="#fn_247"><font size="1">248</font></a>
  			  and ardent affection. We must now supply the contrast. Though the knowledge of Christ was still so obscure, Abraham was inflamed by so strong a desire, that he preferred the enjoyment of it to everything that was reckoned desirable. How base then is the ingratitude of those who despise and reject him, when he is plainly offered to them? The word<i> day</i> does not, in this passage, denote eternity, (as Augustine thought,) but the time of Christ’s kingdom, when he appeared in the world clothed with flesh, to fulfill the office of Redeemer.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.xi-p8"></a>But a question now arises, How did Abraham behold, even with the eyes of faith, the manifestation of Christ? For this appears not to agree with another statement of Christ,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xiv.xi-p9"></a>Many kings and prophets desired to see the things which you see, <br> 			 and yet did not see them, <br> 			 (<a name="xiv.xi-p9.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#024">Lu 10:24</a><a name="xiv.xi-p9.3"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.xi-p10"></a>I reply, faith has its degrees in beholding Christ. Thus the ancient prophets beheld Christ at a distance, as he had been promised to them, and yet were not permitted to behold him present, as he made himself familiarly and completely visible, when he came down from heaven to men.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.xi-p11"></a>Again, we are taught by these words that, as God did not disappoint the desire of <i>Abraham</i>, so he will not now permit any one to breathe after Christ, without obtaining some good fruit which shall correspond to his holy desire. The reason why he does not grant the enjoyment of himself to many is — the wickedness of men; for few desire him. <i>Abraham</i>’<i>s joy </i>testifies that he regarded the knowledge of the kingdom of 			 Christ as an incomparable treasure; and the reason why we are told that he<i> rejoiced to see the day of Christ </i>is, that we may know that there was nothing which he valued more highly. But all believers receive this fruit from their faith, that, being satisfied with Christ alone, in whom they are fully and completely happy and blessed, their consciences are calm and cheerful. And indeed no man knows Christ aright, unless he gives him this honor of relying entirely upon him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.xi-p12"></a>Others explain it to mean, that Abraham, being already dead, enjoyed the presence of Christ, when he appeared to the world; and so they make the time of <i>desiring </i>and the time of <i>seeing </i>to be different. And indeed it is true, that the coming of Christ was manifested to holy spirits after death, of which coming they were held in expectation during the whole of their life; but I do not know if so refined an exposition agrees with 			 Christ’s words.</p>

 <p><a name="xiv.xi-p14"></a><b>57.</b> <i>Thou art not yet fifty years old.</i> They endeavor to refute Christ’s saying, by showing that he had asserted what was impossible, when he <i>who was not yet fifty years of age makes himself equal to Abraham</i>, who died many centuries before. Though Christ was not yet thirty-four years of age, yet they allow him to be somewhat older, that they may not appear to be too rigid and exact in dealing with him; as if they had said, “Thou certainly wilt not make thyself so old, though thou wert to boast that thou art already <i>fifty years of age</i>.” Consequently, those who conjecture that he looked older than he actually was, or that the <i>years </i>mentioned in this passage are not solar years, in either case labor to no purpose.

 <p><a name="xiv.xi-p16"></a><b>58.</b><i> Before Abraham was.</i> As unbelievers judge only from the appearance of the flesh, Christ reminds them that he has something greater and higher than human appearance, which is hidden from the senses of the flesh, and is perceived only by the eyes of faith; and that, in this respect, he might be seen by the 			 holy fathers, before he was manifested in the flesh. But he uses different verbs. <i>Before Abraham </i>was,   			  <a name="fr_248"></a><a href="#fn_248"><font size="1">249</font></a>
  			  or, <i>Before Abraham </i>was born,   			  <a name="fr_249"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">250</font></a>

  			  a power heavenly and divine, the perception of which reached from the beginning of the world through all ages.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.xi-p21"></a>Yet these words may be explained in two ways.

But I extend it much farther, because the power and grace of Christ, so far as he is the Redeemer of the world, was common to all ages. It 			 agrees therefore with that saying of the apostle, <i>Christ yesterday</i>,<i> and to-day</i>,<i> and for ever</i>, (<a name="xiv.xi-p21.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008">Heb 13:8</a><a name="xiv.xi-p21.2"></a>.) For the context appears to demand this interpretation. He had formerly said that Abraham longed for his day with vehement desire; and as this seemed incredible to the Jews, he adds, that he himself also existed at that time. The reason assigned will not appear sufficiently 			 strong, if we do not understand that he was even then acknowledged to be the Mediator, by whom God was to be appeased. And yet the efficacy which belonged, in all ages, to the grace of the Mediator depended on his eternal Divinity; so that this saying of Christ contains a remarkable testimony of his Divine essence.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.xi-p22"></a>We ought also to observe the solemn form of an oath, <i>Verily, verily.</i> Nor do I disapprove of the opinion of Chrysostom, that the present tense of the verb is emphatic; for he does not say, <i>I was</i>, but 			 <i>I am;</i> by which he denotes a condition uniformly the same from the beginning to the end. And he does not say, <i>Before Abraham </i>was, but, <i>Before Abraham </i>was made; which implies that 			 Abraham had a beginning.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.xi-p23"></a><a name="xiv.xi-p23.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.xi-p24"></a><b>59. </b><i>Then they took up stones.</i> There is reason to believe that they did this, as if Christ ought to be stoned according to the injunction of the Law, (<a name="xiv.xi-p24.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016">Le 24:16</a><a name="xiv.xi-p24.1"></a>.) Hence we infer how great is the 			 madness of inconsiderate zeal; for they have no ears to know the cause, but they have hands ready to commit murder. I have no doubt that Christ rescued himself by his secret power, but yet under the appearance of a low condition; for he did not intend to make a clear display of his Divinity without leaving something for human infirmity. Some copies have the words, <i>And so Jesus passed through the midst of them</i>;<i> 			 </i>which Erasmus justly considers to have been borrowed from the Gospel by <a name="xiv.xi-p24.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#030">Lu 4:30</a><a name="xiv.xi-p24.2"></a>.

 <p class="Center"><a name="xiv.xi-p25"></a>in whom dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead, <br> 			 |(<a name="xiv.xi-p25.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009">Col 2:9</a><a name="xiv.xi-p25.2"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.xi-p26"></a>retain possession of the outward temple; but they are greatly deceived, when they think that they have a temple in which God does not dwell. Such is the course now pursued by the Pope and his followers. After having banished Christ, and in this manner profaned the Church, they foolishly glory in the false disguise of a Church.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xiv.v-p9"></a> He refers to Nonnus, a Greek writer, who rendered into hexameter verse the Gospel by John. The passage stands thus:</p>  				
 <p class="Center"><a name="xiv.v-p10"></a><a name="xiv.v-p10.1"></a>Ti&gt;v su&lt; pe&gt;leiv kai&lt; Cristo&lt;v ajni&gt;acen, oa xiv.v-p11}<i>Who art thou</i>?<i> and Christ cried aloud</i>, What (I say) to you from the beginning,<i> having an innumerable multitude of things to say and judge</i>  So far as relates to <a name="xiv.v-p11.1"></a>τὴν ἀρχὴν,<i> Nonnus </i>appears to agree with <i>Calvin</i>; for he renders it <a name="xiv.v-p11.2"></a>ἐξ ἀρχη̈ς,<i> from the 				  beginning</i>. — <i>Ed</i></p> 			 } 			  But a different reading is more generally adopted, and appears to be the true one. I interpret <a name="xiv.v-p11.3"></a>τὴν ἀρχὴν, <i>from the beginning</i>; so that the meaning, in my opinion, is this: “I did not arise suddenly, but as I was formerly promised, so now I come forth publicly.” He 			 adds,  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.v-p12"></a><i>Because I also speak to you;</i> by which he means that he testifies plainly enough who he is, provided that they had ears. This word, <a name="xiv.v-p12.1"></a>ὄτι <i>because</i>, is not employed merely to assign a reason, as if Christ intended to prove that he was <i>from the beginning</i>, because <i>he now speaks</i>; but he asserts that there is such an agreement between his doctrine and the eternity which he has spoken of, that it ought to be 			 reckoned an undoubted confirmation of it. It may be explained thus: “<i>According to the beginning</i>, that is, what I have formerly said, I now, as it were, confirm anew;” or, “And truly what I now also speak, is in accordance with the conditions made in all ages, so as to be a strong confirmation of it.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.v-p13"></a>In short, this reply consists of two clauses; for, under the word <i>beginning,</i> he includes an uninterrupted succession of ages, during which God had made a covenant with their fathers. When he says that <i>he also speaks</i>, he joins his doctrine with the ancient predictions, and shows that it depends on them. Hence it follows that the Jews had no other reason for their ignorance, than that they did not believe either the Prophets or the Gospel; for it is the same Christ that is exhibited in all of them. They pretended to be disciples of the Prophets, and to look to the eternal covenant of God; but still they rejected Christ, who had been promised<i> 			 from the beginning,</i> and presented himself before them.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.v-p14"></a><a name="xiv.v-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.v-p15"></a><b>26.</b> <i>I have many things to say and judge of you.</i> Perceiving that he is in the position of one who sings to the deaf, he pursues his discourse no farther, but only declares that God will defend that doctrine, which they despise, because he is the Author of it. “If I wished to accuse you,” 			 says he, “your malice and wickedness supply me with ample materials; but I leave you for the present. But my Father, who committed to me the office of a teacher, will not fail to fulfill his promise; for he will always vindicate his word against the wicked and sacrilegious contempt of men.” This saying of Christ is of the same import with that of Paul,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xiv.v-p16"></a>If we deny him, he remaineth faithful, he cannot deny himself, <br> 			 (<a name="xiv.v-p16.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013">2Ti 2:13</a><a name="xiv.v-p16.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.v-p17"></a>In short, he threatens the judgment of God against unbelievers, who refuse to give credit to his word; and he does so on this ground, that God must inevitably defend his truth. Now this is the true firmness of faith, when we believe that God is alone sufficient to establish the authority of his doctrine, though the world should reject it. All who, relying on this doctrine, serve Christ faithfully, may fearlessly accuse the whole world of 			 falsehood.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.v-p18"></a><i>And I speak to the world those things which I have heard from him.</i> He says that he utters nothing which he has not received from the Father; and this is the only confirmation of a doctrine, when the minister shows that what he speaks has proceeded from the Father. Now we know that Christ sustained, at that time, the office of a minister; 			 and, therefore, we need not wonder, if he demands that men listen to him, because he brings to them the commandments of God. Besides, by his example he lays down a general law for the whole Church, that no man ought to be heard, unless he speak from the mouth of God. But while he lays low the wicked arrogance of those men who take upon themselves to speak without the word of God, faithful teachers, who know well the nature of their calling, are fortified and armed by him with unshaken firmness, 			 that, under the guidance of God, they may boldly bid defiance to all mortals.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiv.v-p19"></a><a name="xiv.v-p19.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiv.v-p20"></a><b>27. </b><i>They did not know that he spoke to them about the Father.</i> Hence we see how stupid those men are whose understandings are possessed by Satan. Nothing could be more plain than that they were summoned to the judgment-seat of God. But what then? They are altogether blind. This happens daily to other enemies of 			 the Gospel; and such blindness ought to instruct us to walk with fear.   			  <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">229</font></a>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xiv.xi-p19"></a> <a name="xiv.xi-p19.1"></a>πρὶν Αβραὰμ γενέσθαι, ἐγώ εἰμι. Our Author’s idea, to which he merely alludes, appears to be that, instead of saying, <a name="xiv.xi-p19.2"></a>ἐγὼ ἐγενόμνη, or, <a name="xiv.xi-p19.3"></a>ἐγὼ γίνομαι, Christ purposely said, <a name="xiv.xi-p19.4"></a>ἐγώ εἰμι, because the verb <a name="xiv.xi-p19.5"></a>εἰμῖ, standing contrasted with <a name="xiv.xi-p19.6"></a>γενέσθαι, would convey the idea of underived existence. — 				  <i>Ed</i></p>
