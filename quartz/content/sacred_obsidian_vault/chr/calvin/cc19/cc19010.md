 <p><a name="xi.i-p2"></a><b>1.</b> And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, <i>and </i>in the fifth month, <i>that </i>Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which <i>was </i>of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence 				  of the priests, and of all the people, saying,</p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.i-p7"></a><a name="xi.i-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.i-p8"></a>The Prophet relates here with what haughtiness, and even fury, the false prophet Hananiah came forward to deceive the people and to proclaim his trumperies, when yet he must have been conscious of his own wickedness.  			  <a name="fr_191"></a><a href="#fn_191"><font size="1">192</font></a>
  			 It hence clearly appears how great must be the madness of those who, being blinded by God, are carried away by a satanic impulse. The circumstances of the case especially shew how great a contempt of God was manifested by this impostor; for he came into the Temple, the priests were present, the people were there, and there before his eyes he had the sanctuary and the ark of the covenant; and we know that the ark of the covenant is everywhere represented as having the presence of God; 			 for God was by that symbol in a manner visible, when he made evident the presence of his power and favor in the Temple. As Hananiah then stood before God’s eyes, how great must have been his stupidity to thrust himself forward and impudently to announce falsehood in the name of God himself! He had yet no doubt but that he falsely boasted that he was God’s prophet.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.i-p10"></a>And he used the same words as Jeremiah did, <i>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel</i> Surely these words ought to have been like a thunderbolt to him, laying prostrate his perverseness, even had he been harder than iron; for what does Jehovah of hosts mean? This name expresses not only the eternal existence 			 of God, but also his power, which diffuses itself through heaven and earth. Ought not Hananiah then to have trembled when any other had alleged God’s name? But now, though he derided and laughed to scorn the prophetic office as well as God’s holy name, he yet hesitated not to boast that God was the author of this prophecy, which was yet nothing but an imposture. And he added, <i>the God of Israel, </i>so that he might be in nothing inferior to Jeremiah. This was a grievous trial, calculated not only to discourage the people, but also to break down the firmness of the holy Prophet. The people saw that God’s name was become a subject of contest; there was a dreadful conflict, “God has spoken to me;” “Nay, rather to me.” Jeremiah and Hananiah were opposed, the one to the other; each 			 of them claimed to be a Prophet. Such was the conflict; the name of God seemed to have been assumed at pleasure, and flung forth by the devil as in sport.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.i-p11"></a>As to Jeremiah, his heart must have been grievously wounded, when he saw that unprincipled man boldly profaning God’s name. But, as I have already said, God in the meantime supported the minds of the godly, so that they were not wholly cast down, though they must have been somewhat disturbed. For we know that God’s children were not so destitute of feeling as not to be moved by such things; but yet God sustained all those who were endued 			 with true religion. It was indeed easy for them to distinguish between Jeremiah and Hananiah; for they saw that the former announced the commands of God, while the latter sought nothing else but the favor and plaudits of men.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.i-p12"></a>But with regard to Hananiah, he was to them an awful spectacle of blindness and of madness, for he dreaded not the sight of God himself, but entered the Temple and profaned it by his lies, and at the same time assumed in contempt the name of God, and boasted that he was a prophet, while he was nothing of the kind. Let us not then wonder if there be many mercenary brawlers at this day, who without shame and fear fiercely pretend God’s name, and 			 thus exult over us, as though God had given them all that they vainly prattle, while yet it may be fully proved that they proclaim nothing but falsehoods; for God has justly blinded them, as they thus profane his holy name. We shall now come to the words:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.i-p13"></a><i>And it was in the same year, </i>even <i>in the fourth of Zedekiah’s reign, etc</i>. The fourth year seems to have been improperly called the <i>beginning</i> of his reign. We have said elsewhere, that it may have been that God had laid up this prophecy with Jeremiah, and did not design it to be immediately published. But there would be nothing strange in this, were the confirmation of his reign called its beginning. Zedekiah was made king by Nebuchadnezzar, because the people would not have been willing to accept a foreigner. He might indeed have set one of his own governors over the whole country; and he might 			 also have made a king of one of the chief men of the land, but he saw that anything of this kind would have been greatly disliked. He therefore deemed it enough to take away Jeconiah, and to put in his place one who had not much power nor much wealth, and who was to be his tributary, as the case was with Zedekiah. But in course of time Zedekiah increased in power, so that he was at peace in his own kingdom. We also know that he was set over neighboring countries, as Nebuchadnezzar thought it 			 advantageous to bind him to himself by favors. This fourth year then might well be deemed the beginning of his reign, for during three years things were so disturbed, that he possessed no authority, and hardly dared to ascend the throne. This then is the most probable opinion.   			  <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">193</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.i-p15"></a>He says afterwards, that Hananiah <i>spoke </i>to him <i>in the presence of the priests and of the whole people</i>    			  <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="#fn_193"><font size="1">194</font></a>
  			  Hananiah ought at least to have been touched and moved when he heard Jeremiah speaking, he himself had no proof of his own call; nay, he was an impostor, and he knew that he did nothing but deceive the people, and yet he audaciously persisted in his object, and, as it were, avowedly obtruded himself that he might contend with the Prophet, as though he carried on war with God. He said, <i>Broken is the yoke of the king of Babylon, </i>that is, the tyranny by which he has oppressed the people shall be shortly broken. But he alluded to the yoke which Jeremiah had put on, as we shall presently see. The commencement of his prophecy was, that there was no reason for the Jews to dread the present power of the king of 			 Babylon, for God would soon overthrow him. They could not have entertained hope of restoration, or of a better condition, until that monarchy was trodden under foot; for as long as the king of Babylon bore rule, there was no hope that he would remit the tribute, and restore to the Jews the vessels of the Temple. Hananiah then began with this, that God would break the power of the king of Babylon, so that he would be constrained, willing or unwilling, to let the people free, or that the people 			 would with impunity extricate themselves from the grasp of his power. He then adds, —</p>  <a name="xi.ii"></a>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.ii-p5"></a><a name="xi.ii-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.ii-p6"></a>We now see that what Hananiah had in view was to promise impunity to the people, and not only this, but also to soothe them with vain confidence, as though the people would have their king soon restored, together with the spoils which the enemy had taken away. But he began by referring to the power of the king, lest that terrible sight should occupy the minds of the people so 			 as to prevent them to receive this joyful prophecy. He then says, <i>Further, when two years shall pass,</i>   			  <a name="fr_194"></a><a href="#fn_194"><font size="1">195</font></a>
  			  <i>I will bring back to this place all the vessels which King Nebuchadnezzar has taken away</i> Jeremiah had assigned to the people’s exile seventy years, as it has been stated before, and as we shall hereafter often see; but here the false prophet says, that after two years the exile of the king and of the people would come to an end, and that the vessels 			 which had been taken away would be restored; he speaks also of the king himself, —</p>  <a name="xi.iii"></a>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.iii-p5"></a><a name="xi.iii-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.iii-p6"></a>Hananiah promised as to the king himself, what he had just predicted respecting the vessels of the Temple and of the palace. But it may be asked, how did he dare to give hope as to the restoration of Jeconiah, since that could not have been acceptable to Zedekiah? for Jeconiah could not have again gained what he had lost without the abdication of Zechariah; but he would have never submitted willingly to lose his own dignity and to 			 become a private man, and to allow him who had been deprived of this high honor to return again. But there is no doubt but that he relied on the favor of the people, and that he was fully persuaded that if Zedekiah could ill bear to be thus degraded, he would yet be constrained to shew a different feeling; for Zedekiah himself regarded his own reign as not honorable, as he sat not in David’s throne by the right of succession. He had been set on the throne by a tyrant, and he dared not to make 			 any other pretense to the people than that he wished Jeconiah to return and to possess the kingdom of which he had been deprived. As then this impostor knew that the king dared not to shew any displeasure, but that his prophecy would be gratifying and acceptable to the people, he boldly promised what we here read respecting the return of Jeconiah.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.iii-p7"></a>He hence says in God’s name, <i>Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and all the captive people, who have been led away to Babylon, will I restore to this place. </i>We see that he was ever inflated with the same arrogance, and that he wholly disregarded God, whose name he thus in sport profaned. But all this flowed from this 			 fountain, even because he had been blinded by the righteous judgment of God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.iii-p8"></a>he then confirms his own prophecy, repeating its beginning, <i>I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon</i>    			  <a name="fr_195"></a><a href="#fn_195"><font size="1">196</font></a>
  			  He had made open for himself an entrance, by saying that the destruction of the Babylonian monarchy was at hand; and now, after having given utterance to what seemed good to him on the whole affair, he refers again to that event. As then he promised that the monarchy would not stand longer than two years, the Jews might have supposed that they would become free, and might thus have hoped for a happy state of things; and this was the design 			 of the impostor; but what was the answer of Jeremiah? His opposition to him was frank and firm; but as he saw that he had incurred the ill-will of the people, he was anxious to remove it; and before he repeated what he had said of their seventy years in exile, he shewed that he had not eagerly received his commission, as though he had been alienated from his people, or had disregarded their welfare, or had been carried away by some morbid feeling to bring a sad and mournful message. He 			 therefore said, —</p>  <a name="xi.iv"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption21"><a name="xi.iv-p1"></a><a name="xi.iv-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#005">Jeremiah 28:5-6</a><a name="xi.iv-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="xi.iv-p2"></a><b>5.</b> Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="xi.iv-p3"></a><b>5.</b> Tunc dixit Jeremias propheta Chananiae prophetae coram oculis sacerdotum et coram oculis totius populi, qui stabant in domo Jehovae <i>(hoc est, </i>in Tempe,)</p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="xi.iv-p4"></a><b>6.</b> Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD’S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="xi.iv-p5"></a><b>6.</b> Et dixit Jeremias propheta, Amen, sic faciat Jehova, stabiliet Jehova sermones tuos, quos prophetasti ad reducendum <i>(hoc est, </i>ut reducantur) vasa Templi et tota captivitas ex Babylone ad hunc locum.</p> 				  			   		    		  
 <p><a name="xi.iv-p6"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.iv-p7"></a><a name="xi.iv-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.iv-p8"></a>I have shortly reminded you of the design of the Prophet; for it was to be feared that the people would not hear him, or at least that they would not well receive him, as he had threatened them and handled them roughly and severely. We know that men ever seek to be flattered; hence adulations are ever delightfully received. Such is the pride of men, that they cannot bear to be called to an account for what they have done; and <i>they </i>become 			 also indignant, when they see their crimes and vices brought to light; besides, they are so delicate and tender, that they avoid as much as they can all adverse rumors; and if any fear assails them, they instantly resist.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.iv-p9"></a>Now Jeremiah had been furnished with a twofold message, to expose the vices of the people, to shew that the Jews were unworthy to inherit the land, as they were covenant-breakers and despisers of God and of his Law; and then, as they had been so often refractory and perverse, he had another message, that they would not be suffered to escape unpunished, as they had in so many ways, and for so long a time continued to provoke God’s wrath; all 			 this was very displeasing to the people. It was therefore Jeremiah’s object to turn aside the false suspicion under which he labored, and he testified that he desired nothing more than the well-being of the people; “Amen,” he said, “may it thus happen, I wish I were a false prophet; I would willingly retract, and that with shame, all that I have hitherto predicted, so great is my care and anxiety for the safety of the public; for I would prefer the welfare of the whole people to my own 			 reputation.” But he afterwards added, as we shall see, that the promise of Hananiah was wholly vain, and that nothing would save the people from the calamity that was very near at hand.</p>  <a name="xi.v"></a>  		  
 <p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld15"><a name="xi.v-p1"></a>PRAYER</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.v-p2"></a>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou continuest to invite us to thyself, and often to remind us of our sins, that we may embrace the hope of mercy that is offered to us, — O grant, that we may not be ungrateful for this so great and invaluable a blessing, but come to thee in real humility and true repentance, and that trusting in thine infinite goodness, we may not doubt but that thou wilt be propitious to us, so that we may be kindled with the desire for 			 true religion, and in all things obey thy word, that thy name may be glorified in us, until we shall at length come into that celestial glory, which thy Son hath obtained for us by his blood. — Amen.</p>  <a name="xi.vi"></a>  		  
 <p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref14"><a name="xi.vi-p1"></a>Lecture One Hundred and Seventh</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.vi-p2"></a><a name="xi.vi-p2.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vi-p3"></a>We began in the last Lecture to explain the answer of Jeremiah, when he said to Hananiah, “May God confirm thy words, and may the vessels of the Temple be restored to this place and return together with the captive people.” We briefly stated what is now necessary again to repeat, that there were two feelings in the Prophets apparently contrary, and yet they were compatible with one another. Whatever God had commanded them they boldly declared, 			 and thus they forgot their own nation when they announced anything of an adverse kind. Hence, when the Prophets threatened the people, and said that war or famine was near at hand, they doubtless were so endued with a heroic greatness of mind, that dismissing a regard for the people, they proceeded in the performance of their office; they thus strenuously executed whatever God had commanded them. But they did not wholly put off every humane feeling, but condoled with the miseries of the 			 people; and though they denounced on them destruction, yet they could not but receive sorrow from their own prophecies. There was, therefore, no inconsistency in Jeremiah in wishing the restoration of the vessels of the Temple and the return of the exiles, while yet he ever continued in the same mind, as we shall hereafter see.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vi-p4"></a>If any one objects and says that this could not have been the case, for then Jeremiah must have been a vain and false prophet; the answer to this is, that the prophets had no recourse to refined reasoning, when they were carried away by a vehement zeal; for we see that Moses wished to be blotted out of the book of life, and that Paul expressed a similar wish, even that he might be an anathema from Christ for his brethren. (<a name="xi.vi-p4.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032">Ex 32:32</a><a name="xi.vi-p4.1"></a>; <a name="xi.vi-p4.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003">Ro 9:3</a><a name="xi.vi-p4.2"></a>.) Had any one distinctly asked Moses, Do you wish to perish and to be cut off from the hope of salvation? his answer, no doubt, would have been, that nothing was less in his mind than to cast away the immutable favor of God; but when his mind was wholly fixed on God’s glory, which would have been exposed to all kinds of 			 reproaches, had the people been destroyed in the Desert, and when he felt another thing, a solicitude for the salvation of his own nation, he was at the time forgetful of himself, and being carried away as it were beyond himself, he said, “Rather blot me out of the book of life,<i>” </i>and the ease of Paul was similar. And the same view we ought to take of Jeremiah, when he, in effect, said, I would I were a false prophet, and that thou hast predicted to the people what by the event may be 			 found to be true.” But Jeremiah did not intend to take away even the least thing from God’s word; he only expressed a wish, and surrendered to God the care for the other, the credit and the authority of his prophecy, he did not, then, engage for this, as though he ought to have made it good, if the event did not by chance correspond with his prophecy; but he left the care of this with God, and thus, without any difficulty, he prayed for the liberation and return of the people. But it now 			 follows —</p>  <a name="xi.vii"></a>

 <p><a name="xi.vii-p10"></a>Jeremiah, having testified that he did not wish for anything adverse to his own people, but had a good will towards them, now adds that what he had predicted was yet most true. Here is seen more fully what I have said of his twofold feeling; for though the Prophet wished to consult the welfare of the people, he did not yet cease to render full obedience to God, and to announce those messages which were at the same time very grievous: thus 			 Jeremiah did not keep silence, but became an herald of God’s vengeance against the people. On the one hand, then, he showed that he desired nothing more than the welfare and the safety of his people, and that yet it was not in his power nor in that of any mortal to change the celestial decree which he had pronounced. We hence see that God so influenced the minds and hearts of his servants, that they were not cruel or barbarous; and yet they were not made soft and pliable through the influence 			 of humanity, but boldly declared what God had commanded them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p11"></a>For this reason he said, <i>Nevertheless, hear thou this word which I pronounce in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people</i> By these words Jeremiah indirectly condemned the vanity of Hananiah, who sought to flatter the people, and by his adulations hunted for favor and applause, as it is usual with such 			 impostors, he then said that it availed him nothing to give the people the hope of a near deliverance, for God had not changed his purpose. And Jeremiah now boldly and openly opposed him, as he had sufficiently rebutted that ill-will with which he was unjustly loaded; for impostors ever find out calumnies by which they assail the faithful servants of God. He might at the beginning have objected to Jeremiah and said, “Thou art alienated from thine own nation, thou art not touched by the many 			 miseries by which we have been hitherto distressed, nor carest thou for what may happen to us in future.” Thus he might have kindled hatred against Jeremiah, had he not cleared himself. But after he had testified that he felt kindly and was well affected towards his own nation, he assailed the impostor himself, and hesitated not to assert what seemed very grievous, that the people would become captives.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p12"></a>Yet Jeremiah seems here to have been smitten in some measure with fear; for he did not confirm his own prophecy, but left that as it were in suspense; and yet he doubtless exposed the false declaration of Hananiah. But we know that the whole of what the Prophet said is not recited; for he only in a brief way records the heads or the chief things; and further, as we shall presently see, Jeremiah could not act as he wished in the midst of such 			 a tumult, for he would have spoken to the deaf; and as Hananiah had prejudiced the minds of almost all, the holy Prophet would not have been listened to while there was such a confusion. He was therefore satisfied with the brief assertion, that God would soon shew that Hananiah was a false witness in promising so quick a return to the captives and exiles.</p>

  			  Then he adds, changing the number, <i>“When any prophet spoke of peace, </i>the event proved whether or not he was a true prophet.   			  <a name="fr_197"></a><a href="#fn_197"><font size="1">198</font></a>
  			  Now, experience itself will shortly prove thee to be false, for after two years the people who are now in Babylon will be still there under oppression, and the condition of the residue will be nothing better, for those who now remain in the city and throughout all Judea shall be driven into exile as well as their brethren.”</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.vii-p22"></a><a name="xi.vii-p22.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p23"></a>Jeremiah seems here to conclude that those alone are to be deemed true prophets who prove by the event that they have been sent from above; and it not only appears that this may be gathered from his words, but it may also be shewn to be the definition of a true prophet; for when the event corresponds with the prophecy, there is no doubt but that he who predicted what comes to pass must have been sent by God. But we must bear in mind what is 			 said in <a name="xi.vii-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001">Deut. 13:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#002">2</a><a name="xi.vii-p23.1"></a>, where God reminds the people that even when the event answers to the prophecy, the prophets are not to be thoughtlessly and indiscriminately believed, as though they predicted what was true;</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xi.vii-p24"></a>“for God,” he says, “tries thee,” that is, proves thy faith, whether thou wilt be easily carried away by every wind of doctrine.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p25"></a>But there are two passages, spoken by Moses himself, which at the first sight seem to militate the one against the other. We have already quoted the first from <a name="xi.vii-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#000">De 13</a><a name="xi.vii-p25.1"></a>; we have the other in the <a name="xi.vii-p25.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018">De 18:18</a><a name="xi.vii-p25.2"></a>,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xi.vii-p26"></a>“The prophet who has predicted what is found to be true,<br> 			 I have sent him.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p27"></a>God seems there to acknowledge as his faithful servants those who foretell what is true. But Moses had before reminded the people that even impostors sometimes speak the truth, but that they ought not on this account to be believed. But we must remember what God often declares by Isaiah, when he claims to himself alone the foreknowledge of things,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xi.vii-p28"></a>“Go,” he says, “and inquire whether the gods of the Gentiles will answer as to future things.” (<a name="xi.vii-p28.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007">Isa 44:7</a><a name="xi.vii-p28.1"></a>)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p29"></a>We see that God ascribes to himself alone this peculiarity, that he foreknows future events and testifies respecting them. And surely nothing can be more clear than that God alone can speak of hidden things: men, indeed, can conjecture this or that, but they are often mistaken.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p30"></a>With regard to the devil, I pass by those refined disquisitions with which Augustine especially wearied himself; for above all other things he toiled on this point, how the devils reveal future and hidden things? He speculated, as I have said, in too refined a manner. But the solution of the difficulty, as to the subject now in hand, may be easily given. We first conclude, that future events cannot be known but by God alone, and that, 			 therefore, prescience is his exclusive property, so that nothing that is future or hidden can be predicted but by him alone. But, then, it does not follow that God does not permit liberty to the devil and his ministers to foretell something that is true. How? As the case was with Balaam, who was an impostor, ready to let on hire or to sell his prophecies, as it is well known, and yet he was a prophet. But it was a peculiar gift to foretell things: whence had he this? Not from the devil any 			 farther than it pleased God; and yet the truth had no other fountain than God himself and his Spirit. When, therefore, the devil declares what is true, it is as it were extraneous and adventitious.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p31"></a>Now, as we have said, that God is the source of truth, it follows that the prophets sent by him cannot be mistaken; for they exceed not the limits of their call, and so they do not speak falsely of hidden things; but when they declare this or that, they have him as their teacher. But these terms, as they say, are not convertible — to foretell what is true and to be a true prophet: for some, as I have said, predict what is found afterwards by 			 trial and experience to be true, and yet they are impostors; nor did God, in the eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, intend to give a certain definition by which his own prophets are to be distinguished; but as he saw that the Israelites would be too credulous, so as greedily to lay hold on anything that might have been said, he intended to restrain that excess, and to correct that immoderate ardor. Hence he commanded them to expect the event, as though he had said, “If any arise among you who 			 will promise this or that in my name, do not immediately receive what they may announce; but the event will shew whether I have sent them.” So also, in this place, Jeremiah says, that the true prophets of God had spoken efficiently, as they had predicted nothing but what God had ratified and really proved to have come from him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p32"></a>Thus, then, we ought to think of most, that is, that those who predict what is true are for the most part the prophets of God: this is to be taken as the general rule. But we cannot hence conclude, that all those who apparently predict this or that, are sent by God, so that the whole of what they teach is true: for one particular prophecy would not be sufficient to prove the truth of all that is taught and preached. It is enough that God 			 condemns their vanity who speak from their own hearts or from their own brains, when the event does not correspond. At the same time he points out his own prophets by this evidence, — that he really shews that he has sent them, when he fulfils what has been predicted by them. As to false prophets there is a special reason why God permits to them so much liberty, for the world is worthy of such reward, when it willingly offers itself to be deceived. Satan, the father of lies, lays everywhere his 			 snares for men, and they who run into them, and wish to cast themselves on his tenterhooks, deserve to be given up to believe a lie, as they will not, as Paul says, believe the truth. (<a name="xi.vii-p32.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#010">2 Thess. 2:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011">11</a><a name="xi.vii-p32.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p33"></a>We now then see what was the object of Jeremiah: his design was not to prove that all were true prophets who predicted something that was true, for this was not, his subject; but he took up another point, — that all who predicted this or that, which was afterwards found to be vain, were thus convicted of falsehood. If then any one predicted what was to be, and the thing itself came not to pass, it was a sufficient proof of his presumption: it 			 hence appeared, that he was not sent of God as he boasted. This was the object of Jeremiah, nor did he go beyond it; for he did not discuss the point, whether all who predicted true things were sent from above, and whether all their doctrines were to be credited and they believed indiscriminately; this was not the subject handled by Jeremiah; but he shewed that Hananiah was a false prophet, for it would appear evident after two years that he had vainly spoken of what he had not received from 			 God’s Spirit. And the same thing Moses had in view, as I have already explained.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p34"></a>As to the <i>prophets, </i>who had been in all ages and <i>prophesied </i>respecting many lands and great kingdoms, they must be considered as exclusively the true prophets: for though there had been some prophets among heathen 			 nations, yet Jeremiah would not have thought them worthy of so great an honor; and it would have been to blend together sacred and profane things, had he placed these vain foretellers and the true prophets in the same rank. But we know that all God’s servants had so directed their discourse to the elect people, as yet to speak of foreign kingdoms and of far countries; and this has not been without reason distinctly expressed; for when they spoke of any monarchy they could not of themselves 			 conjecture what would be: it was therefore necessary for them thus to speak by the impulse of the Holy Spirit. Were I disposed to assume more than what is lawful, and to pretend that I possess some special gift of prophesying, I could more easily lie and deceive, were I to speak only of one city, and of the state of things open before my eyes, than if I extended my predictions to distant countries: when therefore Jeremiah says that the prophets had spoken of divers and large countries, and of 			 most powerful kingdoms, he intimates that their predictions could not have been ascribed to human conjectures; for were any one possessed of the greatest acuteness, and were he to surpass angels in intelligence, he yet could not predict what is hereafter to take place in lands beyond the seas But whatever had been predicted by the prophets, God sanctioned it by the events of time. It then follows that their call was at the same time sanctioned; that is, when God as it were ratified from heaven 			 what they had spoken on earth. Whether therefore the prophets spoke of peace, that is, of prosperity, or of war, famine, and pestilence, when experience proved that true which they had said, their own authority was at the same time confirmed, as though God had shewed that they had been sent by him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p35"></a>We must also notice the word <a name="xi.vii-p35.1"></a>תמאב<i>, beamet, </i>he says that God sent them <i>in truth</i> He condemns here the boldness which impostors ever assume; for they surpass God’s faithful servants 			 in boasting that they have been sent. As then they were thus insolent, and by a fallacious pretense of having been called to their office, deceived unwary men, the Prophet adds here this clause, intimating that they were not all sent in truth. He thus conceded some sort of a call to these unprincipled men, but yet shewed how much they differed from God’s servants, whose call was sealed by God himself. It follows —</p>  <a name="xi.viii"></a>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.viii-p7"></a><a name="xi.viii-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.viii-p8"></a>It was not enough for the impostor to resist the holy servant of God to his face, without laying sacrilegious hands on that visible symbol, by which it had pleased God to testify that the Prophet’s message was true. For such was the tardiness of the people, nay, their insensibility, that they could not be much moved by words; therefore God added a symbol, for Jeremiah carried cords or bands around his neck: and it was a sign of reproach 			 before men, yet, in order to touch the people, he refused not to undergo that reproach.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.viii-p9"></a>The band then on the neck of Jeremiah was like a sacrament; for it was a visible sign to establish the credit of his message. And what did Hananiah do? After having insolently inveighed against Jeremiah, and promised deliverance to the people after two years, he violently broke and took off the cord or the band which Jeremiah had around his neck.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.viii-p10"></a>We hence see how great and how impetuous is the fury of those whom the devil impels: for when once they arrive at that degree of temerity as to dare to resist the word of God, and, were it possible, to cast him from his own throne, they spare no symbols of his power and glory. We ought especially to notice this madness of Hananiah; for he not only resisted God’s servant, and endeavored to subvert his prophecy, but also snatched away the 			 bands, that he might set up the falsehood of the devil in opposition to the true sacrament. This sign, as we have said, availed to confirm the prophecy of which we have heard; but what was done by Hananiah? he not only took away that sign, but by breaking the bands he attracted the attention of men, and by such a representation made them to believe that there would be in two years a deliverance. Then Hananiah displayed his furious zeal in two ways; for he profaned that symbol which Jeremiah had 			 adopted according to God’s command, and he also took it away, as though he aimed to be above God, and to overthrow his truth, and would triumph over it.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.viii-p11"></a>The same thing we now see done under the Papacy: for we know that what Christ had commanded has been either corrupted, or obscured, or blotted out by them; and they have also devised fictitious sacraments and innumerable pompous rites, by which they fascinate foolish and credulous men. The same did Hananiah; and therefore his disciples and imitators are the Papists; who not only reject or extenuate the testimonies which have come from God, 			 but plainly dishonor his sacraments by arrogantly bringing forward their own devices and inventions.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.viii-p12"></a><a name="xi.viii-p12.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.viii-p13"></a>We must also notice how craftily this impostor insinuated himself; for he seemed to imitate the true prophets of God, for he set a sign before the people, and then added a doctrine. The Papists have their empty signs, but they only delight the eyes, while yet they have no care nor concern for the ears. But Hananiah came still nearer to God’s servants, so that he might deceive even those who were not stupid. What, indeed, 			 could we desire more in this man than that he should set forth a sign? He also added the name of God and declared what was his purpose, <i>in this manner will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar: </i>nor did he speak in his own name, but assumed the person of God, <i>Thus saith Jehovah, </i>I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.viii-p14"></a>But as we have elsewhere said, this preposterous imitation of the devil ought not to disturb pious minds; for God ever supplies his own people with the spirit of discernment, provided they humbly pray to him. And therefore whenever Jeremiah repeated the word prophet, which he conceded to Hananiah, as he assumed it himself, for whenever he spoke of Hananiah, he honored him with this name, even that he was a prophet, — the holy man was not 			 ignorant what an occasion of offense it was, when a prophet, who is so acknowledged in the Church of God, is yet the minister of Satan, a liar and an impostor. But his object was to warn us in due time, lest novelty should frighten us when any boasts of the title of a prophet. So the Papists brag that they are prelates and bishops, and boast that they are the successors of the Apostles: but the devil is their chief, who calls himself the Vicar of Christ on the earth. Then Jeremiah designedly 			 called Hananiah so many times a prophet, so that our faith, when any such thing happens to us, may not fail, as though some new thing had taken place. I cannot to-day finish the last part of the verse.</p>  <a name="xi.ix"></a>  		  
 <p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld15"><a name="xi.ix-p1"></a>PRAYER</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.ix-p2"></a>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou wouldest so try the constancy of our faith as to permit the devil to blend his lies with thy holy truth, we may not yet be entangled in them, but be attentive to that light which thou settest before us, and by which thou guidest us into the way of salvation; and may we in the spirit of docility so offer ourselves to be ruled by thee, that thou mayest also become our faithful and infallible leader, until we shall at 			 length attain that eternal life which has been obtained for us by the blood of thine only-begotten Son. — Amen.</p>  <a name="xi.x"></a>  		  
 <p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref14"><a name="xi.x-p1"></a>Lecture one Hundred and Eighth</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.x-p2"></a>Hananiah, after having broken the bands of Jeremiah, predicted that God would liberate the Jews as well as other nations from under the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar; and it is at length added, that Jeremiah <i>went his way; </i>by which words the Prophet intimates that he left the place, for he was unwilling contentiously to 			 dispute with a violent man, or rather with a wild beast; for it is probable, nay, it may be concluded as certain, that Hananiah had great power in the Temple, for his prophecies were plausible. For as men always seek flatteries, when they heard promised to them what was especially desirable, even an end to all their evils and calamities after two years, all of them greedily received what the impostor had said. Besides, not only his tongue fought against Jeremiah, but also his hands, for he 			 violently assailed the holy man when he broke his bands. Hence Jeremiah could not have acted otherwise than to turn aside as it were from the storm; nor did he do this through fear, but because he saw that his adversary would be his superior in wrangling, nor did he hope to be heard amidst noise and clamors; for he saw that a great tumult would immediately rise if he began to speak. He found it therefore necessary to withdraw from the people.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.x-p3"></a>We are hereby reminded that we ought wisely to consider what occasions may require; for it is not right nor expedient to speak always and everywhere. When, therefore, the Lord opens our mouth, no difficulties ought to restrain us so as not to speak boldly; but when there is no hope of doing good, it is better sometimes to be silent than to excite a great multitude without any profit. True indeed is that saying of Paul, that we ought to be 			 instant out of season, (<a name="xi.x-p3.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002">2Ti 4:2</a><a name="xi.x-p3.1"></a>;) but he means, that the ministers of Christ, though they may sometimes offend and exasperate the minds of many, ought not yet to desist but to persevere. But Jeremiah had no hearers, and the whole people were so incensed, that he could do nothing against that impostor even if he exposed himself to death. He therefore was silent, for he had already discharged the duties of his 			 office; he might have also withdrawn, that he might come furnished with new messages, and thus endued with new authority, as, indeed, it appears from what follows, —</p>  <a name="xi.xi"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption21"><a name="xi.xi-p1"></a><a name="xi.xi-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#012">Jeremiah 28:12-13</a><a name="xi.xi-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="xi.xi-p2"></a><b>12.</b> Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah <i>the prophet</i>, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="xi.xi-p3"></a><b>12.</b> Et fuit sermo Jehovae ad Jeremiam, postquam confregit Chananiah propheta jugum (<i>aut,</i> vinculum) e collo Jeremiae prophetae, dicendo,</p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="xi.xi-p4"></a><b>13.</b> Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="xi.xi-p5"></a><b>13.</b> Vade et loquere cum Chanania, dicendo, (alloquere Chananiam, dicendo,) Sic dicit jehova, Vincula lignea fregisti; fac autem tibi loco illorum vincula ferrea.</p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.xi-p7"></a><a name="xi.xi-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.xi-p8"></a>It hence appears that Jeremiah had regard only to the common benefit of the people, and that he wisely kept silence for a time, that he might not throw pearls before swine, and thus expose in a manner the holy name of God to the insolence of the ungodly. He therefore waited until he might again go forth with new messages, and thus secure more credit to himself. For had he contended longer with Hananiah, contentions would have been kindled on 			 every side, there would have been no hearing in a tumult, and the Jews would have wholly disregarded anything he might have then spoken. But as he had withdrawn from the crowd, and was afterwards sent by God, the Jews could not have so presumptuously despised him or his doctrine. This, then, was the reason why he was for a short time silent.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.xi-p9"></a>If he feared and trembled in the midst of these commotions, God in due time confirmed him by giving him new commands: <i>The word of Jehovah, </i>he says, <i>came to Jeremiah, </i>after Hananiah broke the band from his neck. By these words 			 he intimates, that the ungodly, however insolently they may rise up against God, ever depart with shame and reproach. For Hananiah had not only opposed Jeremiah by his words and tongue, but had also broken the cords or bands from his neck. This, then, the Prophet now repeats, in order that he might shew, as it were by his finger, that Hananiah by his audacity gained nothing, except that he rendered his vanity more notorious.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.xi-p10"></a><a name="xi.xi-p10.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.xi-p11"></a>Now it is an abrupt sentence when he says, <i>Go and speak to Hananiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou hast broken the wooden bands; but make to thee iron bands; </i>Jeremiah does not keep to the same point; for in the first clause he relates what he had been commanded to say to Hananiah; and in the second he relates 			 what God had commanded him to do, even iron bands. But there is no obscurity as to the meaning; for doubtless the Prophet might have arranged his words thus, “Thou hast broken the bands from my neck; but God has commanded me to make new ones from iron.”   			  <a name="fr_198"></a><a href="#fn_198"><font size="1">199</font></a>
  			  Though Jeremiah, then, only tells us here that God commanded him to make iron bands, it may yet be easily concluded that when he spoke of wooden bands he at the same time added what he relates of iron bands, but in a different connection., Now follows the explanation, —</p>  <a name="xi.xii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption21"><a name="xi.xii-p1"></a><a name="xi.xii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#014">Jeremiah 28:14</a><a name="xi.xii-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="xi.xii-p2"></a><b>14.</b> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="xi.xii-p3"></a><b>14.</b> Quoniam sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus Israel, jugum ferreum imposui super collum omnium gentium istorum, ut serviant Nevuchadnezer, regi Babylonis, et servient ei, atque etiam bestiam agri dedi illi.</p> 				  			   		    		  
 <p><a name="xi.xii-p4"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.xii-p5"></a><a name="xi.xii-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.xii-p6"></a>It would have been a vain spectacle, had Jeremiah brought only his iron band around his neck; but when he added an explanation of the symbol, he no doubt prevailed on many to believe his prophecy, and rendered those inexcusable who had hardened themselves in their wickedness. But it is worthy of being observed, that God replaced the wooden bands with iron bands; and he did this, because the whole people had through their foolish and 			 wicked consent approved of the madness of that impostor, who had dared to profane that symbol, by which God had testified that he did not speak in vain, but seriously by the mouth of his servant.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.xii-p7"></a>A profitable doctrine may be hence elicited, — that the ungodly by barking against God gain nothing, except that they kindle more and more his wrath, and thus render double their own evils, like a dog, who being ensnared obstinately strives to extricate himself from the snare and to shake it off, and thus strangles himself. In like manner the ungodly, the more they resist God, the heavier judgment they procure for themselves. And, therefore, 			 whenever God declares to us that he is offended with our sins, we ought to take heed, lest while we seek to break the wooden bands, he be preparing and forming for us iron bands. Our condition will ever become worse, unless we humbly deprecate God’s wrath as soon as it appears, and also patiently submit to his scourges when he chastises us for our offenses. We ought then to bear this in mind as to the wooden and iron bands.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.xii-p8"></a>He adds, <i>Upon the neck of all these nations</i> The Jews, as it has been stated, hoped that Nebuchadnezzar could be in a moment driven back beyond the Euphrates, and would be made to surrender other countries which he had occupied; and all the neighboring nations had conspired, and sent ambassadors here and there; 			 and when the Amorites, the Moabites, and other nations gave encouragement to the Jews, they also in their turn animated others, so that they might all make an assault on the Babylonians. As, then, such a secret conspiracy gave courage to the Jews, this was the reason why the Prophet spoke of other nations. He says, <i>And they shall serve him</i> He had, indeed, already subdued all these 			 countries; but the Prophet means, that the domination of the king of Babylon would continue, though Hananiah had said, that it would stand only for two years. Continuance, then, is set in opposition to a short time, as though the Prophet had said, “Let, indeed, the nations chafe and fret, but they shall abide under the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar, and in vain shall they attempt to extricate themselves, for God has delivered them up to 			 bondage.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.xii-p9"></a>This servitude may at the same time be explained in another way; the condition of these nations was bearable, as long as Nebuchadnezzar ordered tribute to be paid; and when he sent his prefects, the object was no other than to retain possession; but when he found that they could not be otherwise subdued than by a harder servitude, he began to exercise great tyranny, though he had been before an endurable master. The same thing may be also said 			 of the Jews; for we know that they had been tributaries to the king of Babylon; and as he had spared them, his humanity might have been deemed a sort of liberty; but when he found that a hard wood could not be split but by a hard wedge, he began more violently to oppress them. Then that servitude began which is now mentioned. The Jews, therefore, began then really to serve the king of Babylon, when he saw that they would not endure that bearable yoke which he had laid on them, but in their 			 obstinacy and pride ever struggled against it.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.xii-p10"></a>The Prophet adds, <i>The beast of the field have 1 also given him</i> By these words he indirectly upbraids the Jews, as we have before reminded you, with their perverseness, because they perceived not that it was the righteous judgment of God, that Nebuchadnezzar imposed laws on them as a conqueror; for they would 			 have been defended by a celestial aid, as it is said by Moses, had they not deprived themselves of it. (<a name="xi.xii-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#025">De 29:25</a><a name="xi.xii-p10.1"></a>.) As, then, they had long rejected the protection of God, hence it was that Nebuchadnezzar invaded their country and conquered them. As they now continued to bite and champ their bridle, the Prophet exposes their madness; for they did not humble themselves under 			 the mighty hand of God, while wild beasts, void of reason and understanding, perceived that it happened through God’s secret and wonderful providence, that Nebuchadnezzar took possession of these lands. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet expressly mentioned wild beasts, as though he said, that the Jews were so refractory, that there was in them less reason, humility, and solicitude than in lions, bears, and animals of the like kind; for through the secret impulse of God the wild beasts 			 submitted to the authority of King Nebuchadnezzar, while the Jews became more and more insolent. It was the highest madness not to acknowledge God’s judgment, while this was done by wild and savage animals. It follows, —</p>  <a name="xi.xiii"></a>

 <p><a name="xi.xiii-p2"></a><b>15.</b> Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="xi.xiii-p3"></a><b>15.</b> Et dixit jeremias propheta Chananiae prophetae, Audi agedum Chanania, non misit to Jehova, et tu confidere fecisti populum hunc super mendacio (<i>vel,</i> in mendacio.)</p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.xiii-p5"></a><a name="xi.xiii-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.xiii-p6"></a>There would not have been weight enough in the plain teaching of Jeremiah had he not confronted his adversary, as the case is at this day with us; when insolent and unprincipled men rise up and dare to vomit forth their blasphemies, by which they darken and degrade the doctrines of true religion, we are under the necessity to contend with them, otherwise what we teach would be ineffectual; for the minds of many, I mean the simple, are in 			 suspense and fluctuate when they see a great conflict between two contrary parties. It was therefore necessary for the holy man to expose the lies of Hananiah, for he ever vaunted himself and boasted of his own predictions.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.xiii-p7"></a>But what did Jeremiah say? <i>Jehovah hath not sent thee</i> This refutation ought to be noticed whenever we contend with Satan’s ministers and false teachers; for whatever they may pretend, and with whatever masks they may cover their lies, this one thing ought to be more than sufficient to put an end to their 			 boastings, — that they have not been sent by the Lord. Jeremiah might have contended in a long speech with Hananiah, for he might have been made sufficiently eloquent through the Holy Spirit suggesting and dictating whatever was needful on the subject; but this concise brevity produced much greater effect than if he had made great display and used many words. Let this, then, be borne in mind, that wherever there is a controversy about religion, we ought ever to ask whether he who speaks has 			 been sent by God; for whatever he may babble, though the most acute, and though he may talk things which may fill with wonder the minds of the simple, yet all this is nothing but smoke when his doctrine is not from God. So also we ought at this day to deal in a brief manner with those mercenary dogs of the Pope who bark against the pure truth of the Gospel; we ought to be satisfied with this compendious answer, — that God is not their master and teacher. But as our state now is different from 			 that of the ancient people, we must observe that sent by the Lord is he only whose doctrine is according to the rule of the Law, and of the Prophets, and of the Gospel. If, then, we desire to know whom the Lord has sent, and whom he approves as his servants, let us come to the Scripture, and let there be a thorough examination; he who speaks according to the Law, the Prophets, and the Gospel, has a sure and an indubitable evidence of his divine 			 call; but he who cannot prove that he draws what he advances from these fountains, whatever his pretences may be, ought to be repudiated as a false prophet. We hence see what an important instruction this passage contains.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.xiii-p8"></a>He then adds, <i>Thou hast made this people to rely on falsehood</i> They pervert the meaning of the Prophet who thus render the words, “Thou hast falsely rendered this people secure,” at least they lessen by one half what the Prophet intended to express; for not only is Hananiah condemned because he vainly and 			 falsely pretended God’s name, but the word <a name="xi.xiii-p8.1"></a>רקש<i>, shicor, </i>is introduced, the very thing employed; as though he had said, “Thou feedest this people with a vain hope which thou hast formed in thine own brains; therefore thy fictions make this people to go astray.” Hence Jeremiah not only accused this impostor that he by his fictions deceived the people, but also that 			 he brought forward his prophecies in God’s name; and these removed their fear and gave them some hope, so that the people became torpid in their security.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.xiii-p9"></a>Let us learn from this passage that we ought especially to take heed when the ground of trust is the subject, lest we rely on any empty or perishable thing, like wretched hypocrites who devour shadows only, and afterwards find nothing solid in their own fictions. But when we refer to trust, let there be something solid on which we can safely rely; and we know that we cannot possibly be disappointed, if we look to God for all things, if we 			 recumb on his mercy alone; for there is no rest nor peace for us anywhere else but in Christ. Let us then retain this object of trust, and let it be our only support. It follows, —</p>  <a name="xi.xiv"></a>

It was then God’s design, in his paternal indulgence, to stretch forth his hand to them, and also in an especial manner to render inexcusable 			 the unbelieving who had already given themselves up, as it were, to the devil; for the greater part were not moved by an event, so memorable;  			  <a name="fr_199"></a><a href="#fn_199"><font size="1">200</font></a>

 <p><a name="xi.xv-p6"></a>All those who had disregarded Jeremiah saw, in a manner, before their eyes the judgment of God. No surer confirmation could have been expected by the Jews, had they a particle of understanding, than to see the impostor slain by the word of Jeremiah alone; for he never touched him with a finger, nor caused him to be led to punishment, though he deserved this; but he drove him out of the world by the mere sound of his tongue. As, then, the word 			 of the holy Prophet had a celestial and divine power, as though God himself had fulminated from heaven, or with an armed hand had slain that ungodly man, how great was their blindness not to be moved! However, they were not moved; hence some of the Rabbins, wishing to conceal, as their manner is, the reproach of their own nation, imagine that the disciples of Hananiah secretly took away his body, and that then the people knew nothing of his death. But what need is there of such an evasion as 			 this? for Jeremiah says no such thing, but speaks of the event as well known; it was indeed a sure testimony of his own call. It hence follows that it was not unknown to the Jews; and yet the devil had so blinded the greatest part of them, that they paid no more attention to the holy man than before; on the contrary, they wholly disregarded those threatenings of which he had been the witness and herald.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.xv-p7"></a>But how does this appear? the greatest part of the people often rose up against him as though he was the most wicked of men; he was accused as the betrayer of his country, and hardly escaped, through the clemency of. a cruel king, when he was cast into a dungeon as one half-dead. Since, then, the Jews thus pertinaciously raged, we hence understand what the Prophet so often threatened them with, even with the spirit of giddiness, and of fury, 			 and of madness, and of stupor, and of drunkenness. Moreover, it was needful for that small portion which was not wholly irreclaimable to be restored to the right way; and this was done by this manifest proof of Jeremiah’s call. It was also necessary on the other hand that the unbelieving should be more restrained, so that they might be condemned by their own conscience, as Paul calls heretics self-condemned who were become fixed in their own perverseness, and had willingly and designedly sold 			 themselves as slaves to the devil.</p>  <a name="xi.xvi"></a>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xi.i-p14"></a> Gataker mentions various attempted solutions of this difficulty, the one stated here; another, that eleven years, the extent of his reign, being divided into three parts, the three first and the beginning of the fourth might be deemed the beginning of his reign; and a third, which he prefers, that the fourth year refers not to Zedekiah, but to the Sabbatical year, it was the fourth in that cycle; and it appears that according to chronologers the 				  destruction of Jerusalem happened on a Sabbatical year, the fourth in the eighteenth jubilee. In this case the first year of Zedekiah being the fourth after a Sabbath-year, his eleventh would correspond with the next period of their kind, allowance being made as to the commencement of the year in which he began to reign. Blayney adopts the second solution. Perhaps it would be best to take “beginning,” as Scott does, as meaning the early or former part of his reign.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xi.i-p16"></a> Hananiah was, as some think, a priest, for Gibeon in the tribe of Benjamin was one of the cities allotted to the priests; he was, no doubt, by profession, a prophet, he is so called throughout by Jeremiah. There was among the Jews, from early times, an order of men called prophets; they were not all endued with the gift of prophecy, but were trained up in seminaries for the purpose, to be the interpreters of the law and teachers of the people. See 				  <a name="xi.i-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#020">1Sa 19:20</a><a name="xi.i-p16.1"></a>; <a name="xi.i-p16.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#003">2 Kings 2:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#001">2 Kings 6:1</a><a name="xi.i-p16.2"></a>. Hananiah was probably a prophet of this kind, and was on this account called a prophet by Jeremiah; but he appears here in another character, as a prophet endued with the spirit of prophecy. The scribes in the New Testament seem to have been the teaching prophets of the 				  Old.</p>

 <p><a name="xi.vii-p16"></a>It is rather difficult to render this verse. Calvin here repeats the word “prophesied,” which perhaps would be the best construction. There is a <a name="xi.vii-p16.1"></a>ו before “prophesied” in the text, which connects it with “have been.” I would then render it as follows, —</p>  				
 <p class="Center"><a name="xi.vii-p17"></a><b>8.</b> The prophets, who have been before me and before thee from the beginning, and have prophesied concerning many lands and against mighty kingdoms, have prophesied of war, and of famine, and of pestilence.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xi.vii-p19"></a> It is not the past but the future tense is used here, “The prophet, who shall prophesy of peace,” etc.; so the versions, except the Vulg. In the former verse Jeremiah speaks of what all the previous prophets had predicted, that is, of war, famine, and pestilence, as to various kingdoms, and Judah no doubt as forming a part of them. Now, in this verse he seems to say, that if a prophet should be found speaking a different language, contrary to 				  that of all former prophets, the event alone, the fulfillment of his prophecy alone could prove him a true prophet. He intimates that as Hananiah said things contrary to all former prophets, he was not to be believed until what he said came to pass. The verse may be thus rendered, —</p>  				
 <p class="Center"><a name="xi.vii-p20"></a><b>9.</b> The prophet who shall prophesy (or who prophesies) of peace, when the word of that prophet shall come, he will be known as the prophet whom Jehovah hath sent in truth.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xi.xiv-p7"></a> The last clause of this verse is not here explained. Calvin’s version is, “revolt hast thou spoken against Jehovah;” the Vulg., “against the Lord hast thou spoken;” the Syr., “iniquity hast thou spoken before the Lord;” and the Targ., “perverseness hast thou spoken before Jehovah.” Blayney’s version is, “thou hast spoken prevarication concerning Jehovah.” Gataker renders it the same with Calvin, and explains it thus, — “Because by thy lying tales 				  thou hast heartened and encouraged men to stand out against God’s word, and against his admonitions and menaces by his prophets.” Henry gives the same view.</p>  				
 <p><a name="xi.xiv-p8"></a>Blayney says that, <a name="xi.xiv-p8.1"></a>הרס properly signifies declining or turning aside from the straight path, the path of truth and right, and that here it means the presumption of uttering as a revelation from God what a man knew to be not so. The same phrase occurs in two other places, <a name="xi.xiv-p8.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#005">De 13:5</a><a name="xi.xiv-p8.2"></a>; <a name="xi.xiv-p8.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#032">Jer 29:32</a><a name="xi.xiv-p8.3"></a>. The <a name="xi.xiv-p8.4"></a>לא here before Jehovah is <a name="xi.xiv-p8.5"></a>לע in several MSS.; but the 				  prepositions are sometimes the same. The rendering that would suit the three places would be the following: — “For of turning aside hast thou spoken contrary to Jehovah,” that is, to his expressed will or command. The meaning might be thus conveyed, — “for thou hast encouraged disobedience contrary to the express command of God.” — <i>Ed</i></p>
