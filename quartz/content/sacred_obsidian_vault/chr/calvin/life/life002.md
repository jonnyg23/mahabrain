SCRIPTURAL ARGUMENTS EXHORTING TO IT. </h4> 
 <p class="SectionInfo1"><a name="iii-p1"></a>This first chapter consists of two parts,—I. Connection  between this treatise on the Christian Life and the doctrine of Regeneration  and Repentance. Arrangement of the treatise, sec. 1–3. II. Extremes to be  avoided; 1. False Christians denying Christ by their works condemned, sec. 4.  2. Christians should not despair, though they have not attained perfection,  provided they make daily progress in piety and righteousness.</p> 
 <p class="normal"><a name="iii-p2"></a>1. WE have said that the object of regeneration is to bring  the life of believers into concord and harmony with the righteousness of God,  and so confirm the adoption by which they have been received as sons. But  although the law comprehends within it that new life by which the image of God  is restored in us, yet, as our sluggishness stands greatly in need both of helps  and incentives it will be useful to collect out of Scripture a true account of  this reformations lest any who have a heartfelt desire of repentance should in  their zeal go astray. Moreover, I am not unaware that, in undertaking to  describe the life of the Christian, I am entering on a large and extensive  subject, one which, when fully considered in all its parts, is sufficient to  fill a large volume. We see the length to which the Fathers in treating of  individual virtues extend their exhortations. This they do, not from mere  loquaciousness; for whatever be the virtue which you undertake to recommend,  your pen is spontaneously led by the copiousness of the matter so to amplify,  that you seem not to have discussed it properly if you have not done it at  length. My intention, however, in the plan of life which I now propose to give,  is not to extend it so far as to treat of each virtue specially, and expatiate  in exhortation. This must be sought in the writings of others, and particularly  in the Homilies of the Fathers. <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a>
   For me it will be sufficient to point out the method by which a pious man may be  taught how to frame his life aright, and briefly lay down some universal rule by  which he may not improperly regulate his conduct. I shall one day possibly find  time for more ample discourse, [or leave others to perform an office for which I  am not so fit. I have a natural love of brevity, and, perhaps, any attempt of  mine at copiousness would not succeed. Even if I could gain the highest applause  by being more prolix, I would scarcely be disposed to attempt it, <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">2</font></a>
 ]  while the nature of my present work requires me to glance at simple doctrine  with as much brevity as possible. As philosophers have certain definitions of  rectitude and honesty, from which they derive particular duties and the whole  train of virtues; so in this respect Scripture is not without order, but  presents a most beautiful arrangement, one too which is every way much more  certain than that of philosophers. The only difference is, that they, under the  influence of ambition, constantly affect an exquisite perspicuity of  arrangement, which may serve to display their genius, whereas the Spirit of God,  teaching without affectation, is not so perpetually observant of exact method,  and yet by observing it at times sufficiently intimates that it is not to be  neglected.</p> 
 <p class="normal"><a name="iii-p3"></a>2. The Scripture system of which we speak aims chiefly at two  objects. The former is, that the love of righteousness, to which we are by no  means naturally inclined, may be instilled and implanted into our minds. The  latter is, (see chap. ii.,) to prescribe a rule which will prevent us while in  the pursuit of righteousness from going astray. It has numerous admirable  methods of recommending righteousness. <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">3</font></a>
   Many have been already pointed out in different parts of this work; but we shall  here also briefly advert to some of them. With what better foundation can it  begin than by reminding us that we must be holy, because “God is holy?” (<a name="iii-p3.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#001">Lev. xix. 1</a><a name="iii-p3.3"></a>; <a name="iii-p3.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#016">1 Pet. i. 16.</a><a name="iii-p3.4"></a>) For when we were scattered abroad like lost sheep,  wandering through the labyrinth of this world, he brought us back again to his  own fold. When mention is made of our union with God, let us remember that  holiness must be the bond; not that by the merit of holiness we come into  communion with him, (we ought rather first to cleave to him, in order that,  pervaded with his holiness, we may follow whither he calls,) but because it  greatly concerns his glory not to have any fellowship with wickedness and  impurity. Wherefore he tells us that this is the end of our calling, the end to  which we ought ever to have respect, if we would answer the call of God. For to  what end were we rescued from the iniquity and pollution of the world into which  we were plunged, if we allow ourselves, during our whole lives, to wallow in  them? Besides, we are at the same time admonished, that if we would be regarded  as the Lord’s people, we must inhabit the holy city Jerusalem, (Isaiah rev. 8,  <i>et alibi</i>;) which, as he hath consecrated it to himself, it were impious  for its inhabitants to profane by impurity. Hence the expressions, “Who shall  abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh  uprightly, and worketh righteousness,” (<a name="iii-p3.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001">Ps. 15:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#002">2</a><a name="iii-p3.5"></a>; <a name="iii-p3.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003">Ps. 24:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004">4</a><a name="iii-p3.6"></a>) for the  sanctuary in which he dwells certainly ought not to be like an unclean stall.</p> 
 <p class="normal"><a name="iii-p4"></a>3. The better to arouse us, it exhibits God the Father, who,  as he hath reconciled us to himself in his Anointed, has impressed his image  upon us, to which he would have us to be conformed, (<a name="iii-p4.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004">Rom. v. 4</a><a name="iii-p4.1"></a>.) Come, then, and  let them show me a more excellent system among philosophers, who think that they  only have a moral philosophy duly and orderly arranged. They, when they would  give excellent exhortations to virtue, can only tell us to live agreeably to  nature. Scripture derives its exhortations from the true source, <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">4</font></a>
   when it not only enjoins us to regulate our lives with a view to God its author  to whom it belongs; but after showing us that we have degenerated from our true  origin, viz., the law of our Creator, adds, that Christ, through whom we have  returned to favour with God, is set before us as a model, the image of which our  lives should express. What do you require more effectual than this? Nay, what do  you require beyond this? If the Lord adopts us for his sons on the condition  that our life be a representation of Christ, the bond of our adoption,—then,  unless we dedicate and devote ourselves to righteousness, we not only, with the  utmost perfidy, revolt from our Creator, but also abjure the Saviour himself.  Then, from an enumeration of all the blessings of God, and each part of our  salvation, it finds materials for exhortation. Ever since God exhibited himself  to us as a Father, we must be convicted of extreme ingratitude if we do not in  turn exhibit ourselves as his sons. Ever since Christ purified us by the laver  of his blood, and communicated this purification by baptism, it would ill become  us to be defiled with new pollution. Ever since he ingrafted us into his body,  we, who are his members, should anxiously beware of contracting any stain or  taint. Ever since he who is our head ascended to heaven, it is befitting in us  to withdraw our affections from the earth, and with our whole soul aspire to  heaven. Ever since the Holy Spirit dedicated us as temples to the Lord, we  should make it our endeavour to show forth the glory of God, and guard against  being profaned by the defilement of sin. Ever since our soul and body were  destined to heavenly incorruptibility and an unfading crown, we should earnestly  strive to keep them pure and uncorrupted against the day of the Lord. These, I  say, are the surest foundations of a well-regulated life, and you will search in  vain for any thing resembling them among philosophers, who, in their  commendation of virtue, never rise higher than the natural dignity of man.</p> 
 <p class="normal"><a name="iii-p5"></a>4. This is the place to address those who, having nothing of  Christ but the name and sign, would yet be called Christians. How dare they  boast of this sacred name? None have intercourse with Christ but those who have  acquired the true knowledge of him from the Gospel. The Apostle denies that any  man truly has learned Christ who has not learned to put off “the old man, which  is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and put on Christ,” (<a name="iii-p5.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022">Eph. iv. 22.</a><a name="iii-p5.1"></a>)  They are convicted, therefore, of falsely and unjustly pretending a knowledge of  Christ, whatever be the volubility and eloquence with which they can talk of the  Gospel. Doctrine is not an affair of the tongue, but of the life; is not  apprehended by the intellect and memory merely, like other branches of learning;  but is received only when it possesses the whole soul, and finds its seat and  habitation in the inmost recesses of the heart. Let them, therefore, either  cease to insult God, by boasting that they are what they are not, or let them  show themselves not unworthy disciples of their divine Master. To doctrine in  which our religion is contained we have given the first place, since by it our  salvation commences; but it must be transfused into the breast, and pass into  the conduct, and so transform us into itself, as not to prove unfruitful. If  philosophers are justly offended, and banish from their company with disgrace  those who, while professing an art which ought to be the mistress of their  conduct, convert it into mere loquacious sophistry, with how much better reason  shall we detest those flimsy sophists who are contented to let the Gospel play  upon their lips, when, from its efficacy, it ought to penetrate the inmost  affections of the heart, fix its seat in the soul, and pervade the whole man a  hundred times more than the frigid discourses of philosophers?</p> 
 <p class="normal"><a name="iii-p6"></a>5. I insist not that the life of the Christian shall breathe  nothing but the perfect Gospel, though this is to be desired, and ought to be  attempted. I insist not so strictly on evangelical perfection, as to refuse to  acknowledge as a Christian any man who has not attained it. In this way all  would be excluded from the Church, since there is no man who is not far removed  from this perfection, while many, who have made but little progress, would be  undeservedly rejected. What then? Let us set this before our eye as the end at  which we ought constantly to aim. Let it be regarded as the goal towards which  we are to run. For you cannot divide the matter with God, undertaking part of  what his word enjoins, and omitting part at pleasure. For, in the first place,  God uniformly recommends integrity as the principal part of his worship, meaning  by integrity real singleness of mind, devoid of gloss and fiction, and to this  is opposed a double mind; as if it had been said, that the spiritual  commencement of a good life is when the internal affections are sincerely  devoted to God, in the cultivation of holiness and justice. But seeing that, in  this earthly prison of the body, no man is supplied with strength sufficient to  hasten in his course with due alacrity, while the greater number are so  oppressed with weakness, that hesitating, and halting, and even crawling on the  ground, they make little progress, let every one of us go as far as his humble  ability enables him, and prosecute the journey once begun. No one will travel so  badly as not daily to make some degree of progress. This, therefore, let us  never cease to do, that we may daily advance in the way of the Lord; and let us  not despair because of the slender measure of success. How little soever the  success may correspond with our wish, our labour is not lost when to-day is  better than yesterday, provided with true singleness of mind we keep our aim,  and aspire to the goal, not speaking flattering things to ourselves, nor  indulging our vices, but making it our constant endeavour to become better,  until we attain to goodness itself. If during the whole course of our life we  seek and follow, we shall at length attain it, when relieved from the infirmity  of flesh we are admitted to full fellowship with God.</p>
