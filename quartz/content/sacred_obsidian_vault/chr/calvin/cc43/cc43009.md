 <p><a name="iii.vii.i-p11"></a><b>1</b> <i>Do not harshly rebuke an elder</i>  He now recommends to Timothy gentleness and moderation in correcting faults. Correction is a medicine, which has always some bitterness, and consequently is disagreeable. Besides, Timothy being a young man, his severity would have been less tolerable, if it had not been somewhat 				moderated.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.i-p12"></a><i>But exhort him as a father</i> The Apostle enjoins him to reprove elder persons as parents; and he even employs the milder term, <i>exhort</i> It is impossible not to be moved with reverence, when we place before our eyes our father or our mother; in consequence of which, instead of harsher vehemence, we 				are immediately influenced by modesty. Yet it ought to be observed, that he does not wish old men to be spared or indulged in such a manner as to sin with impunity and without correction; he only wishes that some respect should be paid to their age, that they may more patiently bear to be admonished.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.i-p13"></a><i>The younger as brethren</i> Even towards younger persons he wishes moderation to be used, though not in an equal degree; for the vinegar must always be mingled with oil, but with this difference, that reverence should always be shewn to older persons, and equals should be treated with brotherly gentleness. Hence pastors are taught, that they must not only take into account 				their office, but must also see particularly what is due to the age of individuals; for the same things are not applicable to all. Let it therefore be remembered, that, if dramatic performers attend to decorum on the stage, it ought not to be neglected by pastors, who occupy so lofty a station.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.i-p14"></a><a name="iii.vii.i-p14.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.i-p15"></a><b>2</b> <i> The younger as sisters, with all chastity</i> The phrase, with all chastity, relates to younger women; for at that age they ought always to dread every kind of suspicion. Yet Paul does not forbid Timothy to have any criminal or immodest conduct towards young women, (for there was no need of such a prohibition,) but only 				enjoins him to beware of giving to wicked men any handle for laughter. For this purpose, he demands a chaste gravity, which shall shine throughout all their intercourse and conversation; so that he may more freely converse with young persons, without any unfavorable reports.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.i-p16"></a><a name="iii.vii.i-p16.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.i-p17"></a><b>3</b> <i>Honor widows that are really widows. By </i>the word <i>honor</i> he does not mean any expression of respect, but that special care of them which bishops   				 <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">85</font></a>
  				 took in the ancient Church; for widows were taken under the protection of the Church, that they might be supported out of the common funds. The meaning of this mode of expression is as if he had said, “For selecting widows that are to be taken under your care and that of the deacons, you ought to consider who they are <i>that are really widows</i>    				 <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">86</font></a>
  				 What was their condition we shall afterwards explain more fully. But we must here attend to the reason why Paul does not admit any but those who are absolutely widows, and, at the same time, widows without children; for, in that condition, they dedicated themselves to the Church, that they might withdraw from all the private concerns of a family, and might lay aside every hindrance. Justly, therefore, does Paul forbid to receive the 				mothers of families, who are already bound by a charge of a different kind. When he calls them “really widows”, he alludes to the Greek word χήρα, which is derived ἀπὸ τοῦ χηροῦσθαι, from a verb which signifies to be “deprived” or “destitute.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.i-p20"></a><a name="iii.vii.i-p20.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.i-p21"></a><b>4</b> <i>If any widow</i> There are various ways of explaining this passage; and the ambiguity arises from this circumstance, that the latter clause may refer either to widows or to their children. Nor is this consistent with the verb (<i>let them learn)</i> being plural, while Paul spoke of a <i>widow </i>in the singular number; for a change of number is very customary in a general discourse, that is, when the writer speaks of a whole class, and not of an individual. They who think that it relates to widows, are of the opinion that the meaning is, “let them learn, by the pious government of their family, to repay to their successors the education that they received 				from their ancestors.” This is the explanation given by Chrysostom and some others. But others think that it is more natural to interpret it as relating to children and grandchildren. Accordingly, in their opinion, the Apostle teaches that the mother or grandmother is the person towards whom they should exercise their piety; for nothing is more natural than (ἀντιπελαργία) the return of filial for parental affection; and it is very unreasonable 				that it should be excluded from the Church. Before the Church is burdened with them, let them do their duty.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.i-p22"></a>Hereto I have related the opinion of others. But I wish my readers to consider if it would not agree better with the context in this manner: “Let them learn to conduct themselves in a godly manner at home.” As if he had said, that it would be valuable as a preparatory instruction, that they should train themselves to the worship of God, by performing godly offices at home towards their relatives; for nature commands us to love our 				parents next to God; that this secondary piety leads to the highest piety. And as Paul saw that the very rights of nature were violated under the pretense of religion,   				 <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">87</font></a>
  				in order to correct this fault, he commanded that widows should be trained by domestic apprenticeship to the worship of God.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.i-p24"></a><i>To shew piety towards their own house</i> Almost all the commentators take the verb εὐσεβεῖν in an active sense, because it is followed by an accusative; but that is not a conclusive argument, for it is customary with the Greek authors to have a preposition understood. And this exposition agrees well with the context, that, 				by cultivating human piety, they should train themselves in the worship of God; lest a foolish and silly devotion should divest them of human feelings. Again, let widows learn to repay what they owe to their ancestors by educating their own offspring.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.i-p25"></a><i>For this is good and acceptable before God</i> Not to shew gratitude to our ancestors is universally acknowledged to be monstrous; for that is a lesson taught us by natural reason. And not only is this conviction natural to all, that affection towards our parents is the second degree of piety; but the very storks teach us gratitude by their example; and that is the 				etymology of the word ἀνιπελαργία    				 <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">88</font></a>
  				 But Paul, not satisfied with this, declares that God hath sanctioned it; as if he had said, “There is no reason why any one should think that it has its origin in the opinion of men; but God hath so ordained.”</p>  <a name="iii.vii.ii"></a>  			  				 				     				  
 <p class="TableCaption15"><a name="iii.vii.ii-p1"></a><a name="iii.vii.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005">1 Timothy 5:5-8</a><a name="iii.vii.ii-p1.1"></a></p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p2"></a><b>5</b>. Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p3"></a><b>5</b>. Porro quae vere vidua est ac desolata, sperat in Deo, et perseverat in orationibus et obsecrationibus noctu et die.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p8"></a><b>8</b>. But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p10"></a><a name="iii.vii.ii-p10.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p11"></a><b>5</b> <i>She who is really a widow</i> He expresses his meaning more clearly than before; for he shews that they are really widows who are solitary and have no children. He says that such persons <i>hope in God</i> Not that this is done by all, or by them alone; 				for we may see many widows that are childless, and that have no relatives whatever, who nevertheless are haughty and insolent, and altogether ungodly both in heart and in life. On the other hand, then, are those who have many children, and who are not prevented from having their hope placed in God; such as Job and Jacob and David. But for this, (πολυτεκνία) a multitude of children would be a curse, whereas Scripture always reckons it among the 				remarkable blessings of God. But Paul says here that widows “hope in God,” in the same manner as he elsewhere writes, that the unmarried study only to please God, because their affections are not divided like those of married persons. (<a name="iii.vii.ii-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#032">1Co 7:32</a><a name="iii.vii.ii-p11.1"></a>.) The meaning therefore is, that they have nothing to disturb their thoughts, from looking to God alone; because they find 				nothing in the world on which they can rely. By this argument he commends them; for, when human aid and every refuge fails them, it is the duty of the Church to stretch forth her hand to render assistance; and thus the condition of the widow, who is childless and desolate, implores the aid of the pastor.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p12"></a><i>Continueth in prayers</i>. This is the second ground of commendation, that they continually devote themselves to prayer. Hence it follows, that they ought to be relieved and supported at the expense of the Church. At the same time, by these two marks he distinguishes between the worthy and the unworthy; for these words are of the same import as if he enjoined that they only shall be received who 				look for no aid from men, but rely on God alone, and, laying aside other cares and employments, are earnestly devoted to prayer; and that others are ill qualified and of no advantage to the Church. Again, this constancy in prayer demands freedom from other cares; for they who are occupied with the government of a family have less freedom and leisure. We are all, indeed, commanded to pray continually; but it ought to be considered what is demanded by every person’s condition, when, in order to 				pray, retirement and exemption from all other cares are demanded.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p13"></a>What Paul praises in widows, Luke (<a name="iii.vii.ii-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#036">Lu 2:36</a><a name="iii.vii.ii-p13.1"></a>) asserts as to Anna, the daughter of Phanuel; but the same thing would not apply to all, on account of the diversity in their manner of life. There will be foolish women — apes, and not imitators, of Anna — who will run from altar to altar, and will do nothing but sigh and mutter till noon. On this presence, 				they will rid themselves of all domestic affairs; and, having returned home, if they do not find everything arranged to their wish, they will disturb the whole family by outrageous cries, and will sometimes proceed to blows. Let us therefore remember that there are good reasons why it is the peculiar privilege of those who are widows and childless, to have leisure for praying by night and by day; because they are free from lawful hindrances, which would not permit those who govern a family to 				do the same.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p14"></a>And yet this passage lends no countenance to monks or nuns, who sell their mutterings or their loud noises for the sake of leading an easy and idle life. Such were anciently the Euchites or Psallians; for monks and Popish priests differ in no respect, except that the former, by continually praying, thought that none but themselves were pious and holy, while the latter, with inferior industry, imagined that they sanctify both themselves 				and others. Paul had no thought of anything of this sort, but only intended to shew how much more freely they may have leisure for prayer who have nothing else to disturb them.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p15"></a><a name="iii.vii.ii-p15.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p16"></a><b>6</b><i>. She who is in luxury</i>. After having described the marks by which real widows may be known, he now contrasts them with others that ought not to be received. The Greek participle which he employs, σπαταλῶσα, means one who allows herself every indulgence, and leads an easy and luxurious life. Accordingly, Paul (in my 				opinion) censures those who abuse their widowhood for this purpose, that, being loosed from the marriage yoke, and freed from every annoyance, they may lead a life of pleasant idleness; for we see many who seek their own freedom and convenience, and give themselves up to excessive mirth.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p17"></a><i>Is dead while she liveth</i>  When Paul says that such persons “are dead while they live,” this is supposed by some to mean that they are unbelievers; an opinion with which I do not at all agree. I think it more natural to say that a woman “is dead,” when she is useless, and does no good; for to what purpose do we live, if it be not that our actions may yield some 				advantage? And what if we should say that the emphasis lies in the word liveth? For they who covet an indolent life, that they may live more at their ease, have constantly in their mouth the proverbial saying: —</p>  			 
 <p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent19"><a name="iii.vii.ii-p18"></a><i>“For life is not to live, but to be well.”</i>   				 <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">89</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p20"></a>The meaning would therefore be: “If they reckon themselves happy, when they have everything to their heart’s wish, and if they think that nothing but repose and luxury can be called life, for my part, I declare that they are dead.” But as this meaning might seem liable to the charge of excessive ingenuity, I wished merely to give a passing glimpse of it, without making any positive assertion. This at least is certain, that Paul here 				condemns indolence, when he calls those women dead who are of no use.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p21"></a><a name="iii.vii.ii-p21.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p22"></a><b>7</b> <i>And command these things</i> He means, that not only does he prescribe to Timothy the course which he ought to follow, but the women also must be carefully taught not to be stained with such vices. It is the duty of the pastor not only to oppose the wicked practices or ambition of those who act an unreasonable part, but 				to guard against every danger, as far as lies in his power, by instruction and constant warnings.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p23"></a><i>That they may be blameless.</i> It was the natural result of prudence and steadfastness not to admit widows, unless they were worthy; but yet it was proper to assign a reason why they were not admitted; and it was even necessary to forewarn the Church that unworthy persons should not be brought forward, or should not offer themselves. Again, Paul commends this part of 				instruction on the ground of utility; as if he had said, that it must by no means be despised, because it is common, since it aims at the chief part of a good and perfect life. Now there is nothing that ought to be more diligently learned in God’s school than the study of a holy and upright life. In a word, moral instruction is compared with ingenious speculations, which are of no visible advantage, agreeably to that saying,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.vii.ii-p24"></a>“All Scripture is profitable, that the man of God may become perfect,” etc. (<a name="iii.vii.ii-p24.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016">2Ti 3:16</a><a name="iii.vii.ii-p24.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p25"></a><a name="iii.vii.ii-p25.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p26"></a><b>8</b> <i> And if any person do not provide for his own</i> Erasmus has translated it, “If any woman do not provide for her own,” making it apply exclusively to females. But I prefer to view it as a general statement; for it is customary with Paul, even when he is treating of some particular subject, to deduce arguments from 				general principles, and, on the other hand, to draw from particular statements a universal doctrine. And certainly it will have greater weight, if it apply both to men and to women.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p27"></a><i>He hath denied the faith</i>    				 <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">90</font></a>
  				 He says that they who do not care about any of their relatives, and especially about their own house, have “denied the faith.” And justly; for there is no piety towards God, when a person can thus lay aside the feelings of humanity. Would faith, which makes us the sons of God, render us worse than brute beasts? Such inhumanity, therefore, is open contempt of God, and denying of the faith.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p29"></a>Not content with this, Paul heightens the criminality of their conduct, by saying, that he who forgets his own <i>is worse than an infidel</i> This is true for two reasons. First, the further advanced any one is in the knowledge of God, the less is he excused; and therefore, they who shut their eyes against the clear light of God are worse than 				infidels. Secondly, this is a kind of duty which nature itself teaches; for they are (στοργαὶ φυσικαί) natural affections. And if, by the mere guidance of nature, infidels are so prone to love their own, what must we think of those who are not moved by any such feeling? Do they not go even beyond the ungodly in brutality? If it be objected, that, among unbelievers, there are also many parents 				that are cruel and savage; the explanation is easy, that Paul is not speaking of any parents but those who, by the guidance and instruction of nature, take care of their own offspring; for, if any one have degenerated from that which is so perfectly natural, he ought to be regarded as a monster.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p30"></a>It is asked, Why does the Apostle prefer the members of the household to the children? I answer, when he speaks of <i>his own and especially those of his household, </i>by both expressions he denotes the children and grandchildren. For, although children may have been transferred, or may have passed into a different family by marriage, or in any way 				may have left the house of the parents; yet the right of nature is not altogether extinguished, so as to destroy the obligation of the older to govern the younger as committed to them by God, or at least to take care of them as far as they can. Towards domestics, the obligation is more strict; for they ought to take care of them for two reasons, both because they are their own blood, and because they are a part of the family which they govern.</p>  <a name="iii.vii.iii"></a>

  				 and more clearly than he had formerly done.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p15"></a><i>Not under sixty years of age</i> First, he describes the age, <i>sixty years; </i>for, being supported at the public expense, it was proper that they should have already reached old age. Besides, there was another and stronger reason; for they consecrated themselves to the ministry of the Church, which 				would have been altogether intolerable, if there were still a likelihood of their being married. They were received on the condition that the Church should relieve their poverty, and that, on their part, they should be employed in ministering to the poor, as far as the state of their health allowed. Thus there was a mutual obligation between them and the Church. It was unreasonable that those who were under that age, and who were still in the vigor of life, should be a burden to others. 				Besides, there was reason to fear that they would change their mind and think of being married again. These are two reasons why he does not wish any to be admitted “under sixty years of age.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p16"></a><i>Who hath been the wife of one man</i>  As to the desire of marrying, that danger had been sufficiently guarded against, when a woman was more than sixty years old; especially if, during her whole life, she had not been married to more than one husband. It may be regarded as a sort of pledge of continence and chastity, when a woman has arrived at that age, satisfied with 				having had but one husband. Not that he disapproves of a second marriage, or affixes a mark of ignominy to those who have been twice married; (for, on the contrary, he advises younger widows to marry;) but because he wished carefully to guard against laying any females under a necessity of remaining unmarried, who felt it to be necessary to have husbands. On this subject we shall afterwards speak more fully.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p18"></a><b>10 </b><i>For good works</i> Those qualifications which are next enumerated relate partly to honor, and partly to labor. There can be no doubt that the assemblies of widows were honorable, and highly respectable; and, therefore, Paul does not wish that any should be admitted into them, but those who had excellent attestations of the whole of their past 				life. Besides, they were not appointed in order to lazy and indolent inactivity, but to minister to the poor and the sick, until, being completely worn out, they should be allowed honorably to retire. Accordingly, that they may be better prepared for the discharge of their office, he wishes them to have had long practice and experience in all the duties which belong to it; such as — labor and diligence in bringing up children, hospitality, ministering to the poor, and other charitable 				works.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p19"></a>If it be now asked, Shall all that are barren be rejected, because they have never borne any children? We must reply, that Paul does not here condemn barrenness, but the daintiness of mothers, who, by refusing to endure the weariness of bringing up their children, sufficiently shew that they will be very unkind to strangers. And at the same time he holds out this as an honorable reward to godly matrons, who have not spared themselves, 				that they, in their turn, shall be received into the bosom of the Church in their old age.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p20"></a>By a figure of speech, in which a part is taken for the whole, he means by <i>the washing of the feet </i>all the services which are commonly rendered to the saints; for at that time it was customary to “wash the feet.”   				 <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">92</font></a>
  				 An employment of this nature might have the appearance of being mean and almost servile; and therefore he makes use of this mark for describing females who were industrious, and far from being fastidious or dainty. What next follows relates to liberality; and, lastly, he expresses the same thing in general terms, when he says, <i>if she hath been diligent in every good work; </i>for here he speaks 				of acts of kindness.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p23"></a><b>11</b> <i>Refuse younger widows</i> He does not enjoin that they be excommunicated from the Church, or have any mark of disgrace put upon them; but he only asserts that they must not be rewarded by obtaining that honor which he has already mentioned. And if the Spirit of God, by the mouth of Paul, declares that no woman under 				sixty years of age deserves to be admitted into that order, because at that age the unmarried state was dangerous; what effrontery was it, afterwards, to lay down a law of celibacy for young women in all the warmth of youthful years? Paul, I say, does not allow of abstaining from marriage till they are in extreme old age, and altogether beyond the danger of incontinence. They afterwards came to forty years as the age for putting the veil on virgins, and next to thirty; and at length they began 				to put the veil — indiscriminately, and without exception — on females of any age. They allege, that continence is much easier for virgins, who have never had a husband, than it is for widows. But they will never succeed in proving, that there is no reason to dread that danger against which Paul guards and commands others to guard. Accordingly, it is rash, and even cruel, to lay a snare for those who still are young girls, and who would have been fitter for the married state.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p24"></a><i>For when they have begun to be wanton against Christ</i> He says that they are “wanton against Christ,” who, forgetting the condition to which they were called, indulge in unbecoming mirth; for they ought to have kept themselves under the yoke of modesty, as becomes grave and respectable females. Accordingly, a more luxurious and abandoned course 				of life is a sort of wantonness against Christ, to whom they had pledged their fidelity. As Paul had seen many instances of this kind, he meets it by a general remedy, that none should be admitted who were of an age that could ever induce them to desire to be married.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p25"></a>How many monsters of crimes are produced every day in Popery by that compulsory celibacy of nuns! What barriers does it not deliberately break through! And therefore, although this course had at first appeared to be commendable, yet, taught by experiments so many and so terrible, they ought to have somewhat complied with in the counsel of Paul. But they are so far from doing this, that they provoke the wrath of God more and more, from 				day to day, by their obstinacy. Nor do I speak of nuns only, but priests and monks are also compelled by them to observe perpetual celibacy. Yet disgraceful lusts rage amongst them, so that hardly one in ten lives chastely; and in monasteries, the least of the evils is ordinary fornication. If they would incline their heart to hear God speaking by the mouth of Paul, they would instantly have recourse to this remedy which he prescribes; but so great is their pride, that they furiously persecute 				all who remind them of it.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p26"></a>Some read the words thus: — “When they become wanton, they will marry in opposition to Christ.” Although this makes little difference as to Paul’s meaning, the former view is preferable.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p28"></a><b>12</b> <i> Having condemnation, because they have renounced their first faith. “</i>To have condemnation,” is interpreted by some as signifying “to deserve reproof.” But I take it to be a statement of greater severity, that Paul terrifies them by the damnation of eternal death; as if he reproved them by saying that that excellent 				order, which ought rather to have united them to Christ, was the very ground of their condemnation. And the reason is added, that they entirely “revolt from the faith” of baptism and from Christianity. I am aware that there are some who interpret it differently; that is, that they break the pledge which they gave to the Church by marrying, having formerly promised that they would live unmarried till death. This is exceedingly absurd. Besides, why should he call it 				<i>their first faith?</i></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p29"></a>Accordingly, Paul rises to greater vehemence against them, and magnifies the enormity of the offense, by saying that not only would they bring disgrace on Christ and his Church by departing from the condition to which they had agreed, but they likewise broke their “first faith” by wicked revolt. Thus it usually happens, that he who has once transgressed the bounds of modesty gives himself up to all impudence. It grieved him that the 				levity of those women was a reproach to the godly, and that their lustfulness was reproved, or, at least, was liable to reproof. This led them to proceed to greater and greater degrees of licentiousness, till they renounced Christianity. That amplification is exceedingly appropriate; for is there anything more absurd than that they should, through a wish to promote the advantage of persons, open the door to the denial of Christ?</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p30"></a>The attempt of the Papists to support, by means of this passage, a vow of perpetual celibacy, is absurd. Granting that it was customary to exact from the widows an engagement in express terms, still they would gain nothing by this admission. First, we must consider the end. The reason why widows formerly promised to remain unmarried, was not that they might lead a holier life than in a state of marriage, but because they could not, at 				the same time, be devoted to husbands and to the Church; but in Popery, they make a vow of continence, as if it were a virtue acceptable to God on its own account. Secondly, in that age they renounced the liberty of marrying at the time when they ceased to be marriageable; for they must have been, at least, sixty years old, and, by being satisfied with being once married, must have already given a proof of their chastity. But now, vows are made among the Papists to renounce marriage, either 				before the time, or in the midst of time ardor of youthful years.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p31"></a>Now we disapprove of the tyrannical law about celibacy, chiefly for two reasons. First, they pretend that it is meritorious worship before God; and secondly, by rashness in vowing, they plunge souls into destruction. Neither of these was to be found in the ancient institution. They did not make a direct vow of continence, as if the married life were less acceptable to God, but only, so far as it was rendered necessary by the office to 				which they were elected, they promised to keep from the tie of marriage for their whole life; nor did they deprive themselves of the liberty of marrying, till the time when, though they had been ever so free, it was foolish and unreasonable for them to marry. In short, those widows differed as much from the nuns, as Anna the prophetess from Claude the Vestal.   				 <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">93</font></a>

  				 was the image of a good and respectable mother of a family. But there are many who are diseased with the opposite vice. Nothing delights them more than the liberty of running from one place to another, and especially when, being freed from the burden of a family, they have nothing to do at home.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iii-p36"></a><i>Tattlers and busybodies</i> Besides, those widows, under the pretense of the respect due to the public character which they sustained, had more easy access to many persons. This opportunity, obtained through the kindness of the Church, they abused for purposes of “idleness;” and next, as usually happens, from slothfulness sprung curiosity, which is also the mother of 				talkativeness. Most true is the saying of Horace: “Shun an inquisitive person, for he is always a tattler.”   				 <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">95</font></a>
  				 “No trust should be placed,” as Plutarch says, “in inquisitive persons, for, as soon as they have heard anything, they are never at rest till they have blabbed it out.” This is especially the case with women, who, by nature, are prone to talkativeness, and cannot keep a secret.

 <p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p9"></a><b>14</b>  <i>I wish the younger </i>(widows) <i>to marry</i>. Censorious men laugh at this injunction of the Apostle. “As if,” say they, “it had been necessary to stimulate their excessively strong desire; for who does not know that almost all widows have naturally a wish to be married?” 				Superstitious men, on the other hand, would reckon that this doctrine concerning marriage is highly unsuitable to an Apostle of Christ. But, after a careful examination of the whole matter, men of sound judgment will acknowledge that Paul teaches nothing here but what is necessary and highly useful. For, on the one hand, there are many to whom widowhood gives the opportunity of greater licentiousness; and, on the other hand, there are always arising spirits speaking lies in hypocrisy, who make 				holiness to consist in celibacy, as if it were angelical perfection, and either totally condemn marriage, or despise it as if it savored of the pollution of the flesh. There are few either of men or women that consider their calling. How rarely do you find a man who willingly bears the burden of governing a wife! The reason is, that it is attended by innumerable vexations. How reluctantly does a woman submit to the yoke!</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p10"></a>Consequently, when Paul bids the younger widows marry, he does not invite them to nuptial delights; and, when he bids them bear children, he does not exhort them to indulge lust; but, taking into account the weakness of the sex, and the slipperiness of the age, he exhorts them to chaste marriage, and, at the same time, to the endurance of those burdens which belong to holy marriage. And he does this, especially, in order that he may not 				be thought to have acted contemptuously in excluding them from the rank of widows; for he means, that their life will be not less acceptable to God than if they remained in widowhood. And, indeed, God pays no regard to the superstitious opinions of men, but values this obedience more highly than all things else, when we comply with our calling, instead of permitting ourselves to be carried along by the wish of our own heart.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p11"></a>Having heard that consolation, they have no reason to complain that injury is done to them, or to take it in that they are excluded from one kind of honor; for they learn that, in the married state, they are not less acceptable to God, because they obey his calling. When he speaks of <i>bearing children, </i>he includes, under a 				single word, all the annoyances that must be endured in bringing up children; in the same manner as, under <i>the government of the house, </i>he includes all that belongs to household management.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p12"></a><i>To give no occasion to the adversary</i> For, as the husband may be said to be the covering of the wife, so widowhood is liable to many unfavorable suspicions. And what purpose does it serve, to arm the enemies of the gospel with calumnies, without any necessity? But it is very difficult for a widow, in the flower of her age, to act with such caution that wicked men shall 				not find some pretext for slandering her; and, therefore, if they sincerely desire edification, let them, in order to shut the mouth of evil speakers, choose a way of life that is less liable to suspicion. Here, I suppose, the common <i>adversaries </i>of the gospel to be meant, rather than the private adversaries of any woman; for Paul speaks indefinitely.   				 <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">96</font></a>

 <p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p15"></a><b>15</b> <i>For some have already turned aside</i> It is certain, that there is no ordinance so holy that some evil may not arise out of it through the wickedness of men. Yet those things which are necessary ought to remain unmoved, whatever may happen to them, although the sky should fall. But when we are at liberty to choose 				either way, and when this or that has been found by experience to be advantageous, it is a matter of prudence to lay aside what was formerly approved, as in the present case. It was not at all necessary that women, who were still young, should be admitted into the rank of widows; experience shewed that it was dangerous and hurtful; and, therefore, Paul justly advises to take care for the future that nothing of this kind may happen.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p16"></a>If the revolt of some women was regarded by him as a sufficiently strong argument for seeking a universal remedy, how many arguments would the Papists have for abolishing their filthy celibacy, if they had any regard to edification!

 <p><a name="iii.vii.iv-p17"></a><i>After Satan</i> The expression is worthy of notice; because no one can turn aside from Christ, in the smallest degree, without following Satan; for he has dominion over all who do not belong to Christ.

  				 For preserving the good order of the Church, it is likewise highly necessary that elders should not be neglected, but that due regard should be paid to them; for what could be more unfeeling than to have no care about those who have the care of the whole Church? Here πρεσβύτερος <i>(elder) is </i>not a name of age, but of office.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p15"></a><i>Accounted worthy of double honor</i> Chrysostom interprets “double honor” as meaning “support and reverence.” I do not oppose his opinion; let it be adopted by any one that chooses. But for my own part, I think it is more probable that a comparison is here drawn between widows and elders. Paul had formerly enjoined that honor should be paid — to widows; but elders are more 				worthy of being honored than widows, and, with respect to them, ought therefore to receive double honor.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p16"></a>But in order to shew that he does not recommend masks, he adds, <i>who rule well; </i>that is, who faithfully and laboriously discharge their office. For, granting that a person should a hundred times obtain a place, and though he should boast of his title; yet, if he do not also perform his duty, he will have no right to demand that he shall be 				supported at the expense of the Church. In short, he means that honor is not due to the title, but to the work performed by those who are appointed to the office.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p17"></a>Yet he prefers <i>those who labor in word and doctrine, </i>that is, those who are diligent in teaching the word; for those two terms, <i>word</i> and <i>doctrine, </i>signify the same thing, namely, the preaching of 				the word. But lest any one should suppose him to mean by the <i>word</i> an indolent, and, as it is called, a speculative study of it, he adds <i>doctrine</i>    				 <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">99</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p19"></a>We may learn from this, that there were at that time two kinds of elders; for all were not ordained to teach. The words plainly mean, that there were some who “ruled well” and honorably, but who did not hold the office of teachers. And, indeed, there were chosen from among the people men of worth and of good character, who, united with the pastors in a common council and authority administered the discipline of the Church, and were a 				kind of censors for the correction of morals. Ambrose complains that this custom had gone into disuse, through the carelessness, or rather through the pride, of the doctors, who wish to possess undivided power.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p20"></a>To return to Paul, he enjoins that support shall be provided chiefly for pastors, who are employed in teaching. Such is the ingratitude of the world, that very little care is taken about supporting the ministers of the word; and Satan, by this trick, endeavors to deprive the Church of instruction, by terrifying many, through the dread of poverty and hunger, from bearing that burden.   				 <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">100</font></a>

 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p29"></a>I reply, this is a necessary remedy against the malice of men; for none are more liable to slanders and calumnies than godly teachers.   				 <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">103</font></a>
  				Not only does it arise from the difficulty of their office, that sometimes they either sink under it, or stagger, or halt, or blunder, in consequence of which wicked men seize many occasions for finding fault with them; but there is this additional vexation, that, although they perform their duty correctly, so as not to commit any error whatever, they never escape a thousand censures. And this is the craftiness of Satan, to draw away the hearts of men from ministers, that 				instruction may gradually fall into contempt. Thus not only is wrong done to innocent persons, in having their reputation unjustly wounded, (which is exceedingly base in regard to those who hold so honorable a rank,) but the authority of the sacred doctrine of God is diminished.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p31"></a>And this is what Satan, as I have said, chiefly labors to accomplish; for not only is the saying of Plato true in this instance, that “the multitude are malicious, and envy those who are above them,” but the more earnestly any pastor strives to advance the kingdom of Christ, so much the more is he loaded with envy, and so much the fiercer are the assaults made on him. Not only so, but as soon as any charge against the ministers of the 				word has gone abroad, it is believed as fully as if they were already convicted. This is not merely owing to the higher degree of moral excellence which is demanded from them, but because almost all are tempted by Satan to excessive credulity, so that, without making any inquiry, they eagerly condemn their pastors, whose good name they ought rather to have defended.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p32"></a>On good grounds, therefore, Paul opposes so heinous iniquity, and forbids that elders shall be subjected to the slanders of wicked men till they have been convicted by sufficient proof. We need not wonder, therefore, if they whose duty it is to reprove the faults of all, to oppose the wicked desires of all, and to restrain by their severity every person whom they see going astray, have many enemies. What, then, will be the consequence; 				if we shall listen indiscriminately to all the slanders that are spread abroad concerning them?</p>

  				 Whenever any measure is taken for the protection of good men, it is immediately seized by bad men to prevent them from being condemned. Accordingly, what Paul had said about repelling unjust accusations he modifies by this statement, so that none may, on this presence, escape the punishment due to sin. And, indeed, we see how great and diversified are the privileges by which Popery surrounds its clergy; so that, although their life be ever so wicked,   				 <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">105</font></a>
  				 still they are exempted from all reproof. Certainly, if regard be had to the cautions which are collected by Gratian,   				 <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">106</font></a>
  				 (Caus. 2, Quest. 4 and Quest. 7,) there will be no danger of their being ever compelled to give an account of their life. Where will they find the seventy-two witnesses for condemning a bishop, which are demanded by the disgusting bull issued by Pope Sylvester? Moreover, seeing that the whole order of laymen is debarred from accusing, and as the inferior orders, even of the clergy, are forbidden to give any annoyance to the higher classes of them, what shall 				hinder them from fearlessly mocking at all decisions?</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p38"></a>It is therefore proper, carefully to observe this moderation, that insolent tongues shall be restrained from defaming elders by false accusations, and yet that every one of them who conducts himself badly shall be severely corrected; for I understand this injunction to relate to elders, that they who live a dissolute life shall be openly reproved.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p39"></a><i>That others also may fear</i> Wherefore? That others, warned by such an example, may fear the more, when they perceive that not even those who are placed above them in rank and honor are spared; for as elders ought to lead the way to others by the example of a holy life, so, if they commit crime, it is proper to exercise severity of discipline toward them, that it may serve 				as an example to others. And why should greater forbearance be used toward those whose offenses are much more hurtful than those of others? Let it be understood that Paul speaks of crimes or glaring transgressions, which are attended by public scandal; for, if any of the elders shall have committed a fault, not of a public nature, it is certain that he ought to be privately admonished and not openly reproved.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p41"></a><b>21</b> <i> I adjure thee before God</i> Paul introduced this solemn appeal, not only on account of the very great importance of the subject, but likewise on account of its extreme difficulty. Nothing is more difficult than to discharge the office of a public judge with so great impartiality as never to be moved by favor for any 				one, or to give rise to suspicions, or to be influenced by unfavorable reports, or to use excessive severity, and in every cause to look at nothing but the cause itself; for only when we shut our eyes to persons   				 <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">107</font></a>
  				 do we pronounce an equitable judgment.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p43"></a>Let us remember that, in the person of Timothy, all pastors are admonished, and that Timothy is armed, as with a shield, against wicked desires, which not infrequently occasion much trouble even to some excellent persons. He therefore places God before the eyes of Timothy, that he may know that he ought to execute his office not less conscientiously than if he were in the presence of God and of his angels.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p44"></a><i>And the Lord Jesus Christ</i>.

 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p45"></a><i>And the elect angels</i>. To “Christ” he adds “angels,” not as judges, but as the future witnesses of our carelessness, or rashness, or ambition, or unfaithfulness. They are present as spectators, because they have been commanded to take care of the Church. And, indeed, he must be worse than stupid, and must have a heart of stone, whose indolence and carelessness are not shaken off by this single 				consideration, that the government of the Church is under the eye of God and the angels; and when that solemn appeal is added, our fear and anxiety must be redoubled. He calls them “<i>elect</i> angels,”   				 <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">108</font></a>
  				 not only to distinguish them from the reprobate angels, but on account of their excellence, in order that their testimony may awaken deeper reverence.</p>

  				. The Greek word προκρίμα, to translate it literally, answers to the Latin word <a name="iii.vii.v-p48.2"></a><i>proejudicium</i><i>, “</i>a judgment beforehand.” But it rather denotes excessive haste,   				 <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">110</font></a>
  				 as when we pronounce a decision at random, without having fully examined the matter; or it denotes immoderate favor, when we render to persons more than is proper, or prefer some persons as being more excellent than others; which, in the decisions of a judge, is always unjust. Paul, therefore, condemns here either levity or acceptance of persons.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.v-p50"></a>To the same purpose is that which immediately follows, that there must be no <i>turning to this side or that; </i>for it is almost impossible to tell how difficult it is, for those who hold the office of a judge, to keep themselves unmoved, amidst assaults so numerous and so diversified.

 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p11"></a><b>22</b> <i>Lay not hands suddenly on any man</i> There can be no doubt that he intended to guard Timothy against ill-will, and to obviate many complaints, which are continually arising against the godly servants of Christ, who refuse to comply with the ambitious requests of any. For some accuse them of sternness; others of envy; 				and some exclaim that they are cruel, because they do not at once receive those who boast of having some recommendatory qualities. This is what we abundantly experience in the present day. Paul therefore exhorts Timothy not to lay aside judicious caution, and not to suffer himself to be overpowered by improper feelings; not that Timothy needed such an admonition, but to restrain, by his authority, those who otherwise might have given annoyance to Timothy,</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p12"></a>First, the “<i>laying on of hands</i>” means Ordination:   				 <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">112</font></a>
  				 that is, the sign is put for the thing signified; for he forbids him to receive too easily any one that has not been fully tried. There are some who, through a desire of novelty, would wish to receive into the ministerial office, some person hardly at all known, as soon as he has given one or two exhibitions that are reckoned good. It is the duty of a wise and thoughtful bishop, to resist this troublesome feeling, in the same manner as Paul here bids Timothy 				do.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p14"></a><i>Neither partake of other men’s sins</i> He means that he who consents to an unlawful act of ordination is involved in the same guilt as the chief actors in it. Yet some explain it thus: “If he admit unworthy persons, whatever faults they may afterwards commit, to him will be imputed the blame or a part of the blame.” But I think that this is a more simple view of it: 				“Though others rush forth to such rashness, do not make thyself a partaker with them, lest thou share in their guilt.” Even where our judgment is otherwise sound, it often happens that we are carried away by the folly and levity of others.   				 <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">113</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p16"></a><i>Keep thyself pure</i>  I consider this also to have the same reference as the preceding clause. As if he had said, “If others do anything that is wrong, beware lest any contagion reach you, either by consent or by approbation. If you cannot hinder them from polluting themselves, it is at least your duty to have your counsels at all times separated from theirs, so that you 				may keep yourself pure.” If any prefer to view it as a general statement, let him enjoy his opinion; but, for my own part, I reckon it to be more suitable to limit it to the present context.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p17"></a><a name="iii.vii.vi-p17.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p18"></a><b>23</b> <i>No longer drink water</i> There are some who conjecture that this sentence, which breaks off the train of thought, was not written by Paul. But we see that Paul was not so anxious about keeping up the close connection of a discourse, and that it was very customary with him to intermingle a variety of statements without 				any arrangement. Besides, it is possible that what had been formerly written in the margin of the Epistle afterwards found its way into this passage through the mistake of the transcribers. Yet there is no necessity for giving ourselves much trouble on that point, if we consider Paul’s custom, which I have mentioned, of sometimes mingling various subjects.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p19"></a>What is said amounts to this, that Timothy should accustom himself to drink a little wine, for the sake of preserving his health; for he does not absolutely forbid him to “drink water,” but to use it as his ordinary beverage; and that is the meaning of the Greek word ὑδροποτεῖν</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p20"></a>But why does he not simply advise him to <i>drink wine? </i>For when he adds, a <i>little, </i>he appears to guard against intemperance, which there was no reason to dread in Timothy. I reply, this was rather expressed, in order to meet the slanders of wicked men, who would otherwise have been ready to mock at his advice, on this or some such pretext: “What sort of philosophy is this, which encourages to drink wine? Is that the road by 				which we rise to heaven?” In order to meet jeers of this kind, he declares that he provides only for a case of necessity; and at the same time he recommends moderation.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p21"></a>Now it is evident that Timothy was not only frugal, but even austere, in his mode of living; so much so as even not to take care of his health; and it is certain that this was done, neither through ambition nor through superstition. Hence we infer, that not only was he very far from indulging in luxury and superfluities, but that, in order that he might be better prepared for doing the work of the Lord, he retrenched a portion even of 				his ordinary food; for it was not by natural disposition, but through a desire of temperance, that he was abstemious.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p22"></a>How few are there at the present day, who need to be forbidden the use of water; or rather how many are there that need to be limited to drink wine soberly! It is also evident how necessary it is for us, even when we are desirous to act right, to ask from the Lord the spirit of prudence, that he may teach us moderation. Timothy was, indeed, upright in his aims; but, because he is reproved by the Spirit of God, we learn that excess of 				severity of living was faulty in him. At the same time a general rule is laid down, that, while we ought to be temperate in eating and drinking, every person should attend to his own health, not for the sake of prolonging life, but that, as long as he lives, he may serve God, and be of use to his neighbors.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p23"></a>And if excessive abstinence is blamed, when it brings on or promotes diseases, how much more should superstition be avoided? What judgment shall we form as to the obstinacy of the Carthusians,   				 <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">114</font></a>
  				who would sooner have died than taste the smallest morsel of flesh in extreme necessity? And if those who live sparingly and soberly are commanded not to injure their health by excessive parsimony, no slight punishment awaits the intemperate, who, by cramming their belly, waste their strength. Such persons need not only to be advised, but to be kept back from their fodder like brute beasts.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p26"></a><b>24</b> <i> The sins of some men are visible beforehand</i>  As there is nothing that distresses more the faithful ministers of the Church, than to see no way of correcting evils, and to be compelled to endure hypocrites, of whose wickedness they are aware and to be unable to banish from the Church many who are destructive plagues, 				or even to hinder them from spreading their venom by secret arts;   				 <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">115</font></a>
  				 Paul supports Timothy by this consolation, that, when it shall please God, they, will one day be brought to public view. Thus he strengthens him for the exercise of patience; because he ought calmly to await the fit time which God in his wisdom has appointed.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p28"></a>There is another kind of base conduct that sorely distresses good and holy pastors. When they have most conscientiously discharged their duty, they are provoked by many unfair statements, are loaded with much ill-will, and perceive that those actions which deserved praise are turned into blame. Paul meets this case also, by informing Timothy, that there are some good works which are reserved for being brought to light at a future 				period; and consequently that, if their praise is, as it were, buried under ground by the ingratitude of men, that also ought to be patiently endured, till the time of revelation have arrived.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p29"></a>Yet not only does he provide a remedy for these evils, but, because it often happens that we are mistaken in choosing ministers, unworthy persons insinuating themselves cunningly, and the good being unknown to us; and even though we do not go wrong in judging, but still cannot bring others to approve of our judgment, the most excellent being rejected, notwithstanding all our efforts to the contrary, while bad men either insinuate or 				force themselves forward; it is impossible that our condition and that of the Church should not occasion great anguish. Accordingly, Paul strenuously endeavors to remove, or at least to alleviate, this cause of uneasiness. The meaning may be thus summed up. “We must bear what cannot be immediately corrected; we must sigh and groan, while the time for the remedy is not fully come; and we must not apply force to diseases, till they are either ripened or laid open. On the other hand, when virtue 				does not receive the honor which it deserves, we must wait for the full time of revelation, and endure the stupidity of the world, and wait quietly in darkness till the day dawn.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p30"></a><i>Hastening to judgment</i> I now come to the words, after having given a brief illustration of the subject. When he says that <i>the sins of some men are visible beforehand, </i>he means that they are discovered early, and come to the knowledge of men, as it were, before the time. He expresses the same 				thing by another comparison, that they run, as it were, and “hasten to their judgment;” for we see that many run headlong, and, of their own accord, bring damnation on themselves, though the whole world is desirous to save them. Whenever this happens, let us remember that the reprobate are prompted by an unseen movement of Providence, to throw out their foam.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p31"></a><i>In some they follow after</i> The rendering given by Erasmus, “Some they follow after,” I do not approve. Although it seems to be more in accordance with the Greek construction, yet the sense requires that the preposition ἐν be understood; for the change of case does not destroy the contrast. As he had said that the sins of 				some men hasten rapidly to their judgment; so now, on the other hand, he adds, that the sins of some men (or, of others) come slowly to be known. But instead of the genitive “of some,” he uses the dative “in some” (or “in others.”) He means that, although the sins of some men may be concealed longer than we would wish, and are slowly brought to light, yet they shall not always be concealed; for they too shall have their own time. And if the version of Erasmus be preferred, still the meaning 				must be the same, that, although the vengeance of God does not hasten, yet it follows slowly behind them.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p32"></a><a name="iii.vii.vi-p32.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.vii.vi-p33"></a><b>25</b> <i> In like manner also the good works</i> He means, that sometimes piety and other virtues obtain early and speedily their applause among men; so that great men are held in estimation; and that, if it happen otherwise, the Lord will not suffer innocence and uprightness to be always oppressed; for 				it is often obscured by calumnies, or by clouds, but at length shall be fulfilled the prediction, (<a name="iii.vii.vi-p33.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003">Da 12:3</a><a name="iii.vii.vi-p33.1"></a>; <a name="iii.vii.vi-p33.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043">Mt 13:43</a><a name="iii.vii.vi-p33.2"></a>,) that God will cause them to shine forth like the dawn of the day. But we have need of a calm spirit to endure; and therefore we must always 				consider what is the limit of our knowledge, that we may not go beyond it; for that would be to assume to ourselves the prerogative of God.</p>

If this is dreadful and absolutely shocking, ought we not to be better advised than we have been to conceal ourselves under the wings of our God, and to suffer ourselves to be governed by him, till he renew us by his Holy Spirit in such a manner that we shall not be so giddy and foolish as we have been?

For the devils were not created wicked and malicious as they now are, enemies of all that is good, and false and cursed in their nature. They were angels of God, but they were not elected to persevere, and so they fell. Thus God reserved what he chose among the angels. And so we have already a mirror of God’s election of us to heaven, by free grace before we came into 					 the world. Now, if we see the grace of God displayed even to angels, what shall become of us? For all mankind were lost and ruined in Adam, and we are an accursed, and, as the Scripture tells us, are born “children of wrath.” (<a name="iii.vii.v-p46.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003">Eph 2:3</a><a name="iii.vii.v-p46.1"></a>.)

This gracious election must prevail, in order to separate us from the reprobate, who remain in their perdition. We ought, therefore, carefully to remark this passage, that Paul, when speaking of the angels, shews that their high rank proceeds from their having been chosen and elected by God.

The founder of this monastic society, which surpassed all the rest in the extravagant austerity of their manners and discipline, was Bruno, a native of Cologne, and canon of the cathedral of Rheims in France. This zealous ecclesiastic, 					 who had neither power to reform, nor patience to bear, the dissolute manners of his Archbishop Manasse, retired from his church, with six of his companions and, having obtained the permission of Hugh, bishop of Grenoble, fixed his residence in the miserable desert already mentioned. He adopted at first the rule of St. Benedict, to which he added a considerable number of severe and rigorous precepts. His successors, however, went still farther, and imposed upon the Carthusians new laws, much 					 more intolerable than those of their founder, — laws which inculcated the highest degrees of austerity that the most gloomy imagination could invent.” <i>Mosheim’s Eccl.
