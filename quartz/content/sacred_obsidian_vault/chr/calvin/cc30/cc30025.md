 <p><a name="v.i.i-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Very angry has Jehovah been with your fathers:</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p5"></a><b>3 </b>Thou shalt therefore say to them, — Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, — Return ye to me, saith Jehovah of hosts; And I will return to you, saith Jehovah of hosts:</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p6"></a><b>4 </b>Be ye not like your fathers, For cry to them did the former Prophets, saying, — Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, — “Return ye, I pray, from your evil ways, And from your evil works;” But they heard not, nor attended to me, Saith Jehovah.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p7"></a><b>5 </b>Your fathers — where are they? And the Prophets — do they for ever live?</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p8"></a><b>6 </b>But my words and my statutes, Which I committed to my servants the Prophets, Have they not laid hold on your fathers? — When they returned, they said, — “As Jehovah of hosts had purposed to do to us According to our ways and our works, So hath he done to us.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p9"></a><b>7 </b>On the twenty-fourth of the eleventh month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo, the Prophet, saying, —</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p10"></a><b>8 </b>I saw by night, and behold a man riding on a red horse; and he stood among the myrtles in a low place; and after him were horses, red, variegated, and white.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p11"></a><b>9 </b>And I said, What are these, my Lord? And the Angel, who spoke with me, said to me, I will show thee what these are.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p12"></a><b>10 </b>And the Angel, who stood among the myrtles, answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p13"></a><b>11 </b>And they answered the angel of Jehovah, who stood among the myrtles, and said — “We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, the whole earth rests and is quiet.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p14"></a><b>12 </b>And the Angel of Jehovah answered and said, Jehovah of hosts! How long wilt thou not pity Jerusalem And the cities of Judah, Which thou hast despised these seventy years! (<b>42</b>)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p15"></a><b>13 </b>Then answered Jehovah the Angel, who spoke with me, with good words, with comfortable words.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p16"></a><b>14 </b>And the Angel, who spoke with me, said to me, Cry, saying, —— Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, — I am zealous for Jerusalem And for Sion, with great zeal: (<b>44</b>)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p17"></a><b>15 </b>And with great anger am I angry With the nations which are quiet; For I was angry a little, And they helped on the evil.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p18"></a><b>16 </b>Therefore thus saith Jehovah, — I am turned to Jerusalem in compassions; My house shall be built in it, Saith Jehovah of hosts; And a line shall be extended over Jerusalem.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p19"></a><b>17 </b>Cry again, saying, — Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, — Yet wear out shall cities through abundance, (<b>51</b>) And Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, And will yet choose Jerusalem.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p20"></a><b>18 </b>And I raised my eyes and saw, and behold four horns;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.i-p21"></a><b>19 </b>and I said to the angel, who was speaking with me, What are these? and he said to me, These are the four horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</p>

 <p><a name="v.i.ii-p11"></a><b>9 </b>For, behold, I shake my hand over them, And they shall be a prey to their servants; And ye shall know That Jehovah of hosts hath sent me.</p>

 <p><a name="v.i.iii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>And Jehovah said to Satan, — Rebuke thee, Satan, let Jehovah; Yea, rebuke thee let Jehovah, Who has chosen Jehovah: Is not this a brand snatched from the fire!</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.iii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>And Joshua was clad in sordid garments, and stood before the angel:</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.iii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>and he answered and said to those who stood before him, saying, Take the sordid garments from off him: and he said to him, See I have made to pass from thee thine iniquity, and I will clothe thee with new garments.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.iii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>And I said, Let them set a pure mitre on his head: and they set a mitre on his head when they had clothed him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah stood by:</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.iii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>And protest did the angel of Jehovah to Joshua, saying, —</p>

 <p><a name="v.i.iii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>Hear now, O Joshua! the high priest, Thou and thy associates who stand before thee; For men of wonder are these; For, behold, I will bring forth my servant, the Branch:</p>

 <p><a name="v.i.iv-p8"></a><b>6 </b>And he answered and said to me, saying, Not by a host, and not by courage, But by my Spirit, (<b>110</b>) Saith Jehovah of hosts.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.iv-p9"></a><b>7 </b>What art thou, great mountain, Before Zerubbabel? — A plain: And he shall bring forth the top-stone, <i>With</i> shoutings, “Grace, grace to it.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.iv-p10"></a><b>8 </b>Then came the word of Jehovah to me, saying, —</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.i.iv-p11"></a><b>9 </b>The hands of Zerubbabel have founded this house, And his hands shall complete it; And thou shalt know That Jehovah of hosts has sent me to you.</p>

 <p><a name="v.i.v-p6"></a><b>4 </b>I will bring it forth, saith Jehovah of hosts; and it shall come into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears by my name falsely; and it shall abide in the midst of his house and consume it, both its timber and its stones.</p>
