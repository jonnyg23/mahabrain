 <p><a name="ii.iii.i-p71"></a><b>2</b>  <i>When any man hath a running issue.</i> He here alludes to other species of contamination, for which a solemn purification is required. And, first, he teaches that men are defiled by the flow of the seminal fluid, which occurs in two ways, either when it 				involuntarily bursts out in sleep, or when it escapes gradually in the disease, which the Greeks call <a name="ii.iii.i-p71.1"></a>γονόρ᾿ῥοια This Supplement might, as I have said, be appended to the Seventh Commandment, because every   				 <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">17</font></a>
  				 indisposition arising from lust appears here to be condemned; but, if we look more closely, we shall perceive that it is a general law for the cultivation of purity, and which must <i>not</i> be confined to chastity alone. For this flux, arising from disease and debility, unless it be contracted from immoderate venery, has nothing in common with venereal lust. Besides, what is immediately after added concerning the 				menstruation of women, is connected with other forms of uncleanness and defilement. The sum then is, that the seminal-flux is reckoned among the pollutions which prevented the Israelites from entering the tabernacle, and from the external service of God; and thence the rule must always be borne in mind, that whatever proceeds from an unclean man is corrupt, and that no one can duly offer either himself, or what he possesses, to God, except he who is pure and perfect in soul and body. Thus Paul 				explains the end and object of this ceremony, when he exhorts believers that, being received as God’s peculiar people, they should cleanse themselves</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ii.iii.i-p73"></a>"from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit.” <br> 				(<a name="ii.iii.i-p73.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001">2Co 7:1</a><a name="ii.iii.i-p73.2"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="ii.iii.i-p74"></a>But Moses further declares, that uncleanness is contracted, not only when the seed is emitted, but when it is retained; and that not only is the man himself rendered unclean, but whatever he may have touched — his bed, his seat, his saddle, his clothes; and that the contagion extends to others also, if any should have lain on the same bed, or ridden on the same saddle. Thus did God desire to impress them with horror, that they might be 				more accustomed to fly from all impurity. Nor would the crime have been detestable: in itself, had not spiritual purity been set forth under this external exercise and symbol. Thus, too, in (<a name="ii.iii.i-p74.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003">Ps. 24:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004">4</a><a name="ii.iii.i-p74.1"></a>), the truth of this figure is described:</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ii.iii.i-p75"></a>"Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in His holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart."</p>  			 
 <p><a name="ii.iii.i-p76"></a>Therefore he who was conscious of no sin in the seminal-flux, still must be reminded by this sign of the corruption of his nature; and at the same time be an example to others, that all should diligently take heed to themselves, because corruption cleaves to the whole human race. In the ablution the remedy of the evil was proposed, since the mark of ignominy induced them to repentance. It is expedient that whosoever is infected 				with any stain should be brought to shame, so as to be displeased with himself; but the acknowledgment of the evil would produce despair, unless the hope of pardon were associated with it. Therefore, those to whom purification was necessary, are always sent to water; and, whenever water is mentioned, the passage in St. John should be brought to mind, that Christ came “by water and blood,” to purge and expiate all uncleanness. (<a name="ii.iii.i-p76.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006">1Jo 5:6</a><a name="ii.iii.i-p76.1"></a>.) Besides the water, a sacrifice of turtle doves, or two young pigeons is added; and this has reference to the same thing; viz., that purification for the unclean must be sought for elsewhere, which we have at length obtained by the sacrifice of Christ.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ii.iii.i-p77"></a><a name="ii.iii.i-p77.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="ii.iii.i-p78"></a><b>19.</b><i> And if a woman have an issue. </i>Women are now spoken of who suffer under a twofold issue of blood; for with almost all it occurs every month, (whence it is called <i>menses, </i>or <i>menstruation,</i>) and some labor under a constant hemorrhage. He declares both to be unclean; and, after menstruation, a certain period of separation is appointed, during which the law prohibited their cohabitation with men; but, if the blood flowed beyond the usual time, the time of purification is postponed until it ceased. Whence it appears, that in every shameful thing the Jews were reminded of their uncleanness, that thus they might be accustomed to modesty and seek after purity. And this still 				more clearly appears at the end of the chapter, where it is said, (v. 3l,) “Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not — when they defile my tabernacle.” God, I say, briefly sets forth His intention that He would drive away all profanation far from His people; because he desires sincerity to prevail amongst his worshippers, and cannot bear his tabernacle to be polluted by any stain.</p>
