 <p><a name="iv.i-p2"></a><b>1.</b> And he came to Derbe and Lystra; and, behold, there was there a certain disciple named Timotheus, the son of a certain faithful woman, a Jewess, and his father was a Grecian. <b>2.</b> He was well reported of by the brethren which were at Lystra and Iconium. <b>3.</b> Paul would have him to go with him; and when he had taken him he circumcised him, because of those Jews which were in those places.

 <p><a name="iv.i-p5"></a><b>1.</b> Luke doth now begin to declare what were the proceedings of Paul after that Barnabas and he were separate. And first he showeth, that he took to his company at Lystra Timothy to be his companion. But, to the end we may know that Paul did nothing rashly, or without good consideration, Luke saith plainly, that Timothy was such a man as the brethren did well like of, and that they gave testimony of his godliness; for thus doth he speak 			 word for word. And so Paul himself observeth the like choice, which he elsewhere commandeth to be made in choosing ministers, (<a name="iv.i-p5.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#000">1 Timothy 3</a><a name="iv.i-p5.1"></a>: 7.) Neither is it to be thought, that those prophecies did even then come to light wherewith Timothy was set forth and adorned by the Spirit, as Paul doth testify elsewhere, (<a name="iv.i-p5.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018">1Ti 1:18</a><a name="iv.i-p5.2"></a>.) But there seemeth to be some disagreement in that, in that Luke saith that 			 Timotheus was well reported of amongst the brethren; and Paul will have him to have a good report of those who are without, who is chosen to be a bishop. I answer, that we must principally look unto the judgment of the godly, as they be sole meet witnesses, and do alone rightly discern well and wisely according to the Spirit of God; and that we ought to attribute no more to the wicked than to blind men. Therefore it appeareth that godliness and holiness of life must be judged according to the 			 will and consent of godly men; that he be counted worthy to be a bishop whom they commend. Notwithstanding, I confess that even this also is required in the second place, that the very infidels be enforced to commend him; lest the Church of God come in danger  			  <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="#fn_171"><font size="1">172</font></a>
  			 of their slanders and evil speaking, if it commit [permit] itself to be governed by men of evil report.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.i-p7"></a><a name="iv.i-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p8"></a><b>3.</b><i> He circumcised him, because of the Jews.</i> Luke doth plainly express that Timothy was not circumcised, because it was necessary it should be so, or because the religion of that sign did continue as yet, but that Paul might avoid an offense. Therefore there was respect had of men, whereas the matter was free before 			 God. Wherefore, the circumcising of Timothy was no sacrament, as was that which was given to Abraham and his posterity, (<a name="iv.i-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#013">Ge 17:13</a><a name="iv.i-p8.1"></a>;) but an indifferent ceremony which served only for nourishing of love, and not for any exercise of godliness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p9"></a>Now, the question is, whether it were lawful for Paul to use a vain sign, whose signification and force was abolished; for it seemeth a vain thing when there is a departure made from the institution of God. But circumcision was commanded by God to continue only until the coming of Christ. To this question I answer, that circumcision did so cease at the coming of Christ, that, notwithstanding the use thereof was not quite abolished by and by; but 			 it continued free, until all men might know that Christ was the end of the law, by the more manifest revelation of the light of the gospel.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p10"></a>And here we must note three degrees. The first is, that the ceremonies of the law were so abolished by the coming of Christ, that they did neither any longer appertain unto the worship of God, neither were they figures of spiritual things, neither was there any necessity to use them. The second is, that the use thereof was free, until the truth of the gospel might more plainly appear. The third, that it was not lawful for the faithful to retain 			 them, save only so far forth as the use thereof served for edification, neither was there any superstition thereby fostered; though that free power to use them, whereof I have spoken, be not without exception, because there was a divers respect to be had of ceremonies. For circumcision was not in the same place wherein the sacrifices were, which were ordained for the purging [expiating] of sins. Wherefore it was lawful for Paul to circumcise Timotheus; it had not been lawful for him to offer a 			 sacrifice for sin. This is, indeed, a general thing, that all the worship of the law did cease at the coming of Christ, (because it was to continue but for a time,) as touching faith and conscience; but concerning the use we must know this, that it is indifferent, and left in the liberty of the godly for a short time, so far as it was not contrary to the confession of faith. We must note the shortness of time whereof I speak, to wit, until the plain manifestation of the Gospel; because some 			 learned men are grossly deceived in this point, who think that circumcision doth yet take place  			  <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_172"><font size="1">173</font></a>
  			 among the Jews; whereas Paul teacheth, that it is superfluous when we are buried with Christ by baptism, (<a name="iv.i-p11.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011">Col. 2:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012">12</a><a name="iv.i-p11.2"></a>.) It was better and more truly said in the old proverb, That the synagogue was to be buried with honor.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p12"></a>Now it resteth that we declare how far forth the use of circumcision was indifferent. That shall easily appear by the manner of the liberty. Because the calling of the Gentiles was not as yet generally known, it was meet that the Jews should have some prerogative granted them. Therefore, until it might be better known that the adoption was deducted from the lineage and kindred of Abraham unto all the Gentiles, it was lawful, so far as 			 edification did require, to retain the sign of difference. For seeing that Paul would not circumcise Titus, and doth avouch that the same was well done, (<a name="iv.i-p12.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#003">Ga 2:3</a><a name="iv.i-p12.1"></a>,) it followeth that it was not lawful to use this ceremony always and without choice. Therefore they were to have respect unto edification, and unto the public commodity of the Church. Because he could not circumcise Titus, unless he would betray 			 the doctrine  			  <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_173"><font size="1">174</font></a>
  			 of the Gospel, and lay himself open to the slanders of the adversaries, he abstained from the free use of the ceremony, which he did use in Timotheus, when he saw that it was profitable for the Church. Hereby it doth easily appear what horrible confusion doth reign in Popery. There is there a huge heap of ceremonies, and to what end but that hey may have instead of one veil of the old temple an hundred. God did abrogate those ceremonies which he had commanded, that the truth of the 			 Gospel might shine more clearly. Men durst take upon them to bring in new, and that without keeping any measure. After this came in a wicked surmise, that all these serve for the worship of God. At length followed the devilish confidence of merit. Now, forasmuch as it is evident enough that such ceremonies are neither veils nor sepulchres wherewith Christ is covered, but rather stinking dunghills wherein faith  			  <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">175</font></a>
  			 and religion are choked, those who make the use thereof generally free do ascribe more to the Pope than the Lord granteth to his law. It is to no end to speak of the mass and of such filthiness which contain in themselves manifest idolatry.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p15"></a><i>They all knew this.</i> Luke telleth us that this was Paul’s drift, to make an entrance for Timotheus unto the Jews, lest they should abhor him as a profane man. They knew all (saith he) that his father was a Grecian. Therefore, because the mothers had no power over their children, they were fully persuaded that he was uncircumcised. Let the readers not here by the 			 way, how miserable the bondage of the people of God was then. Eunice, mother to Timotheus, was one of the small remnant which the very Jews themselves counted a monster, and yet, being married to a man which was an infidel, she durst not consecrate her children to God. No, she durst not so much as give them the external sign of grace, and yet she ceased not therefore to instruct her son of a child holily in the fear of God, and in his true worship—an example surely worthy to be followed of 			 women, whom their husbands affray with their tyrannous government, from keeping and training up their children and families chastely in true godliness. Grecian is taken in this place for a Gentile, after the old and common custom of the Scripture.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.i-p16"></a><a name="iv.i-p16.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p17"></a><b>4.</b><i> They delivered them the decrees to keep.</i> In these words Luke doth signify unto us how desirous Paul was of peace. The best and strongest bond to keep and foster peace among the churches, was to keep that which was set down by the apostles. When Paul taketh great pains about that, he taketh great heed lest through his fault there arise 			 any trouble. And let us remember that that continued but for a time. Because, so soon as he seeth the danger of offense cease, he doth quite unburthen the churches, and setting apart the decree, he maketh that free which the apostles had their forbidden. And yet doth he not cancel or violate by that abrogation that which the apostles had decreed, or contemn the authors themselves; because they were not determined to establish a perpetual law, but only to mitigate for a short time that which 			 might hurt weak consciences; as I did more at large declare in the former chapter. Whereby the folly of the Papists is sufficiently refuted, who do grievously lay to our charge that we be far unlike Paul, because we will have the consciences of the godly governed by the Word of God alone, setting light by the decrees of the Church, as they call them, and not to be subject to the will of men. But, as I have already said, Paul meant nothing less than to ensnare men’s consciences in the snare of 			 necessity, for he is not contrary to himself, when he crieth in other places, that</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="iv.i-p18"></a>“all things are clean to the clean,” <br> 			 (<a name="iv.i-p18.2"></a>Titus 1:15.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p19"></a>And again,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="iv.i-p20"></a>“He which is clean eateth all things,” <br> 			 (<a name="iv.i-p20.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#002">Ro 14:2</a><a name="iv.i-p20.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p21"></a>And again,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="iv.i-p22"></a>“The kingdom of God is not meat and drink,”<br> 			 (<a name="iv.i-p22.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017">Ro 14:17</a><a name="iv.i-p22.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p23"></a>And again,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="iv.i-p24"></a>“Meat doeth not commend us to God,” <br> 			 (<a name="iv.i-p24.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#008">1Co 8:8</a><a name="iv.i-p24.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p25"></a>Again,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="iv.i-p26"></a>“Eat all things which are sold in the shambles, asking no question for conscience sake,” <br> 			 (<a name="iv.i-p26.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025">1Co 10:25</a><a name="iv.i-p26.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p27"></a>But in one word he reconcileth those things which might otherwise seem to disagree, when he commanded to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, for another’s man conscience sake. Nevertheless, he taketh great heed that he bind not godly souls with the laws of men.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p28"></a>Therefore we attempt nothing at this day which is contrary to or disagreeing with Paul. But the Papists mock us too grossly when they compare their laws with the decrees of the apostles. The apostles invented no new worship of God, they had erected no new spiritual government; but for the desire they had to maintain peace, they exhorted the Gentiles that they would yield a little to the Jews. Before the Pope can excuse his laws under this 			 color, he must first change them wholly. And as for us, seeing that the Papists do place the spiritual worship of God in man’s inventions, and translate the right which belongeth to God alone unto men, that they may reign as lords over souls; we are enforced manfully to withstand them, unless through treacherous silence we will betray the grace gotten by the blood of Christ. Now, what likelihood can there be between three decrees set down for the help and comfort of the weak, and an infinite 			 heap of laws, which doth not only oppress miserable souls with the weight thereof, but also swallow up faith? We know the complaint of Augustine writing to Januarius, that the Church was wickedly laden even then with too great a burden of traditions. Could he, I pray you, suffer the bondage of these times, which is almost a hundred times harder and heavier?</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.i-p29"></a><a name="iv.i-p29.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.i-p30"></a><b>5.</b><i> The churches were confirmed.</i> By this we gather, that that which Luke setteth down, or rather touched concerning the decrees of the apostles, was, as it were, put in by the way, being not much appertinent unto the matter.   			  <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_175"><font size="1">176</font></a>
  			  For he commendeth a far other fruit of Paul’s doctrine, when he saith that the churches were confirmed in the faith. Therefore Paul did so order external things, that he was principally careful for the kingdom of God, which consisteth in the doctrine of the gospel, and doth far surpass and surmount external order. Therefore those decrees were mentioned, inasmuch as they were expedient for maintaining concord, that we might know that the holy man had a care thereof. 			 But religion and godliness hath the former place, whose sole foundation is faith; which again doth stay itself upon the pure Word of God, and doth not depend upon men’s laws. Now, by this example, Luke pricketh us forward to proceed continually, lest, at the beginning, sloth or neglect of profiting come upon us. Also the way to increase faith is expressed, to wit, when the Lord doth stir us up by the industry of his servants; as at that time he used the labor and diligence of Paul and his 			 companions. When he addeth immediately that they were also increased in number, he commendeth another fruit of preaching, and yet he doth therewithal signify unto us, that the more those profit in faith who are first called, the more do they bring unto Christ; as if faith did creep abroad unto others by branches.   			  <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">177</font></a>

 <p class="TableCaption06"><a name="iv.ii-p1"></a><a name="iv.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006">Acts 16:6-10</a><a name="iv.ii-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="iv.ii-p2"></a><b>6.</b> And when they had gone through Phrygia and the country of Galatia, they were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to speak the word in Asia <b>7.</b> And going into Mysia, they essayed to go into Bithynia: and the Spirit suffered them not. <b>8.</b> And when they had passed through Mysia, they came down to Troada, [Troas.] <b>9.</b> And Paul saw a vision by night; There was a certain man of Macedonia, standing and praying him, and saying, Coming 				  into Macedonia, help us. <b>10.</b> And so soon as he saw the vision, we sought straightway to go into Macedonia, being surely confirmed that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.</p> 				  			   		    		  
 <p><a name="iv.ii-p3"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.ii-p4"></a><a name="iv.ii-p4.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.ii-p5"></a><b>6.</b><i> When they had gone throughout.</i> Luke showeth here how diligent and careful Paul and his companions were in the office of teaching; for he saith that they journeyed through divers regions of the Lesser Asia that they might preach the gospel. But he reciteth one thing which is worth remembering, that they were forbidden by the Spirit of 			 God to speak of Christ in some places, which serveth not a little to set forth the apostleship of Paul; as undoubtedly he was not a little encouraged to proceed, when he knew that the Spirit of God was his guide in his way, and the governor of his actions. And whereas whithersoever they came they prepared themselves to teach, they did that according to their calling, and according to the commandment of God. For they were sent to preach and publish the gospel to the Gentiles without exception; 			 but the Lord revealed his counsel in governing the course of their journey which was before unknown, even in a moment.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.ii-p6"></a>Notwithstanding, the question is, If Paul taught nowhere by whither he was led by the Spirit, what certainty shall the ministers of the Church have at this day of their calling, who are certified by no oracles when they must speak or hold their peace? I answer, Seeing that Paul’s province and charge was so wide, he had need of the singular direction of the Spirit. He was not made the apostle of one particular place, or of a few cities, but he 			 had received commandment to preach the gospel through Asia and Europe; which was to sail in a most wide sea. Wherefore, there is no cause why we should wonder that in that confused wideness God beckoned unto him, as it were by reaching forth his hand, how far he would have him go, or whither. But here ariseth another harder question, why the Lord did forbid Paul to speak in Asia, and suffered him not to come into Bithynia? For, if answer be made that these Gentiles were unworthy of the doctrine 			 of salvation, we may again demand why Macedonia was more worthy? Those who desire to be too wise, do assign the causes of this difference in men, that the Lord vouchsafeth every man of his gospel, as he seeth him bent unto the obedience of faith; but he himself saith far otherwise, to wit, that he appeared plainly to those which sought him not, and that he spake to those who asked not of him. For whence cometh aptness to those to be taught, and a mind to obey, but from his Spirit? Therefore, it 			 is certain that some are not preferred before other some by their merit, seeing that all men are naturally like backward and wayward from faith. Therefore, there is nothing better than to leave free power to God to vouchsafe and deprive of his grace whom he will. And surely as his eternal election is free, so his calling is also free which floweth thence, and is not grounded in men, seeing that he is not indebted to any.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.ii-p7"></a>Wherefore, let us know that the gospel springeth and issueth out to us out of the sole fountain of mere grace. And yet God doth not want a just reason, why he offereth his gospel to some, and passeth over other some. But I say that that reason lieth hid in his secret counsel. In the mean season, let the faithful know that they were called freely when others were set aside, lest they take that to themselves which is due to the mercy of God 			 alone. And in the rest, whom God rejecteth for no manifest cause, let them learn to wonder at the deep depth of his judgment, which they may not seek out. And here the word Asia is taken for that part which is properly so called. When Luke saith that Paul and his companions essayed to come into Bithynia until they were forbidden by oracles, save only when need required, as they Lord useth to be present with his in doleful  			  <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">178</font></a>
  			 and uncertain matters.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.ii-p9"></a><a name="iv.ii-p9.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.ii-p10"></a><b>9.</b><i> A vision by night.</i> The Lord would not that Paul should stay any longer in Asia; because he would draw him into Macedonia. And Luke expresseth the manner of the drawing, that a man of Macedonia appeared to him by night. Where we must note that the Lord did not always observe the same manner of revelation, because divers kinds are more 			 convenient for confirmation. And it is not said that this vision was offered in a dream, but only in the night season. For there be certain night visions which men see when they be awake.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.ii-p11"></a><i>Help us.</i> This speech setteth forth the ministry committed to Paul. For, seeing that the gospel is the power of God to salvation, (<a name="iv.ii-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016">Ro 1:16</a><a name="iv.ii-p11.1"></a>,) those which are the ministers of God are said to help those who perish; that having delivered them from death, 			 they may bring them unto the inheritance of eternal life. And this ought to be no small encouragement for godly teachers to stir up the heat of their study and desire, when they hear that they call back miserable souls from destruction, and that they help those who should otherwise perish, that they may be saved. Again, all people unto whom the gospel is brought are taught reverently to embrace the ministers thereof as deliverers, unless they will maliciously reject the grace of God; and yet 			 this commendation and title is not so translated unto men, that God is robbed even of the best part of his praise; because, though he by his ministers give salvation, yet is he the only author thereof, as if he reached out his hands to help.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.ii-p12"></a><a name="iv.ii-p12.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.ii-p13"></a><b>10.</b><i> Being fully persuaded.</i> Hence we gather, that is was not bare vision, but that it was also confirmed by the testimony of the Spirit. For Satan doth oftentimes abuse ghosts and visures [masks] to deceive withal, that he may mock and cozen the unbelievers. Whereby it cometh to pass, that the bare vision leaveth man’s mind in doubt; but 			 such as are divine indeed, those doth the Spirit seal by a certain mark, that those may not doubt nor waver whom the Lord will have certainly addicted to himself. A wicked spirit appeared to Brutus, inviting him to enter that unhappy combat and battle which he had at Philippi, even in the very same place whereunto Paul was afterwards called. But as the cause was far unlike, so the Lord dealt far otherwise with his servant, so that he put him out of doubt, and left him not astonished with fear. 			 Now, in Paul and his companions the desire to obey ensued immediately upon the certainty; for, so soon as they understand that the Lord called them, they address themselves to their journey. The termination of the participle which is here used is active; and though it have divers significations, I do not doubt but that Luke’s meaning is, that Paul and the rest, after that they had conferred [compared] this vision with the former oracles, were fully persuaded that the Lord had called them into 			 Macedonia.</p>  <a name="iv.iii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption06"><a name="iv.iii-p1"></a><a name="iv.iii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#011">Acts 16:11-15</a><a name="iv.iii-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p><a name="iv.iii-p5"></a><b>11.</b> This history doth, as it were in a glass, show how sharply the Lord did exercise the faith and patience of his, by bringing them in great straits which they could not have overcome unless they had been endued with singular constancy; for the entrance of Paul into Macedonia is reported to be such, as that it might have cause him to give but small credence to the vision. These holy men, leaving the work which they had in hand, did 			 cross the seas with great haste, as if the whole nation of the Macedonians would have come to meet them with earnest desire to be helped. Now, the success is so far from being answerable to their hope, that their mouths are almost quite stopped. When they enter the chief city, they find non there with whom they may take any pains; therefore they are enforced to go into the field, that they may speak in an obscure corner and wilderness. Yea, even there they cannot have one man which will hearken 			 to their doctrine; they can only have one woman to be a disciple of Christ, and that one which was an alien. Who would not have said that this journey was taken in hand foolishly which fell out so unhappily? But the Lord doth thus bring to pass his works under a base and weak kind,  			  <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">179</font></a>
  			 that his power may shine more clearly at length; and it was most meet that the beginnings of the kingdom of Christ should be so ordered, that they might taste [savor] of the humility of the cross. But we must mark the constancy of Paul and his companions, who being not dismayed with such unprosperous beginnings, try whether any occasion will offer itself contrary to their expectation. And assuredly the servants of Christ must wrestle with all lets, neither must they be discouraged, 			 but go forward to-morrow, if this day there appear no fruit of their labor, for there is no cause why they should desire to be more happy than Paul. When Luke saith that they abode in that city, some had rather have it, that they conferred or disputed, but the other translation is more plain. And the text persuadeth us to make choice thereof, because Luke will shortly after declare that Lydia was the first-fruits of that Church; and we may easily guess that the apostles went out of the city, 			 because there was no gate opened to them in it.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iii-p8"></a><b>13.</b><i> In the day of the Sabbaths.</i> No doubt the Jews sought some place which was solitary and by the way, when they were disposed to pray, because their religion was then everywhere most odious. And God, by their example, meant to teach us what great account we ought to make of the profession of faith; that we do not forsake it either for 			 fear of envy or of dangers. They had, indeed, in many places synagogues, but it was not lawful for them to assemble themselves publicly at Philippi, which was a free city of Rome.   			  <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">180</font></a>
  			  Therefore, they withdraw themselves into a secret corner, that they may pray to God where they could not be espied; and yet there were those who did grudge even at this, so that they might think that it might both cause trouble and danger, but they prefer the worship of God before their own quietness and commodity. Furthermore, we may gather by this word Sabbath, that Luke speaketh of the Jews. Secondly, forasmuch as he commendeth the godliness of Lydia, it must 			 needs be that she was a Jewess, which matter needeth no long disputation, forasmuch as we know that it was an heinous offense for the Grecians and Romans to celebrate the Sabbath, or to take up Jewish rites. Now, we understand that the Jews made choice of the river’s bank, but because they shunned the company of men, and the sight of the people. If any man object, why did not every man pray in his house privately? The answer is ready, that this was a solemn rite of praying, to testify 			 godliness; and that being far   			  <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">181</font></a>
  			  from the superstitions of the Gentiles, they might one exhort another to worship God alone, and that they might nourish the religion received of the fathers among themselves. As touching Paul and his fellows who were lately come,   			  <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">182</font></a>
  			  it is to be thought that they came thither not only to pray, but also because they hope to do some good. For it was a fit place for them to teach in, being far from noise; and it was meet that they should be more attentive to hear the word who came thither to pray. Luke putteth the day of the Sabbaths instead of the Sabbath; where, following Erasmus, I have translated it, <i>There was wont </i>to be prayer; the old 			 interpreter hath, <i>did seem</i>. And the word [<a name="iv.iii-p11.2"></a>νομιζεσθαι] hath both significations among the Grecians. Yet this sense is more fit for this present place, that they did commonly use to have prayer there.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.iii-p12"></a><i>We spake to the women.</i> Either that place was appointed for the assemblies of women,   			  <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">183</font></a>
  			  or else religion was cold among men, so that they came more slowly. Howsoever it be, we see that the holy men omit no occasion or opportunity, because they vouchsafed to offer the gospel even to women alone. Furthermore, forasmuch as it seemeth likely to me that men and women made their prayers there together, I suppose that Luke omitted the men either because they would not hear, or else because they profited nothing by hearing.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iii-p15"></a><b>14.</b><i> A woman named Lydia.</i> If they had been heard of a few women, yet this had been to enter in, as it were, by a strait chink; but now whereas one only heareth attentively and with fruit, might it not have seemed that the way was stopt before Christ?   			  <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">184</font></a>
  			  But afterward there sprung a noble Church of that one small graft, which Paul setteth out with many excellent commendations; yet it may be that Lydia had some companions, whereof there is no mention made, because she did far excel them all. And Luke doth not assign that for the cause why this one woman did show herself apt to be taught, because she was more witty   			  <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">185</font></a>
  			  than the rest, or because she had some preparation of herself; but he saith that the Lord opened her heart that she might give ear and take heed to the speech of Paul. He had of late commended her godliness; and yet he showeth that she could not comprehend the doctrine of the gospel, save only through the illumination of the Spirit. Wherefore, we see that not faith alone, but all understanding and knowledge of spiritual things, is the peculiar gift of God, and that 			 the ministers do no good by teaching and speaking unless the inward calling of God be thereunto added.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.iii-p18"></a>By the word heart, the Scripture meaneth sometimes the mind, as when Moses saith, “God hath not given thee hitherto a heart to understand.” So likewise in this place, Luke doth not only signify unto us that Lydia was brought by the inspiration of the Spirit, with affection of heart to embrace the gospel, but that her mind was lightened, that she might understand it. By this let us learn that such is the blockishness, such is the blindness of 			 men, that in seeing they see not, in hearing they hear not, until such time as God doth give them new eyes and new ears. But we must note the speech, that the heart of Lydia was opened was opened that she might give ear to the external voice of the teacher. For as preaching alone is nothing else but the dead letter, so we must beware lest a false imagination, or a show of secret illumination, lead us away from the word whereupon faith dependeth, and wherein it resteth. For many, to the end they 			 may amplify the grace of the Spirit, feign to themselves certain inspired persons,  			  <a name="fr_185"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">186</font></a>
  			 that they may leave no use of the external word. But the Scripture doth not suffer any such divorce to be made which joineth the ministry of men with the secret inspiration of the Spirit. Unless the mind of Lydia had been opened, Paul’s preaching should have been only literal;  			  <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_186"><font size="1">187</font></a>
  			 and yet the Lord doth not inspire her with bare revelations only, but he giveth her the reverence of his word, so that the voice of man, which might otherwise have been uttered in vain, doth pierce into a mind endued with heavenly light.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.iii-p21"></a>Therefore, let those brain-sick fellows be packing, [begone,] who, under color [pretext] of the Spirit, refuse external doctrine. For we must note the temperature of moderation which Luke setteth down here, that we can have or obtain nothing by the hearing of the word alone, without the grace of the Spirit; and that the Spirit is given us, not that he may bring contempt of the word, but rather that he may dip [instill] into our minds into our 			 minds, and write in our hearts the faith thereof.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.iii-p22"></a>Now, if the cause be demanded why the Lord opened one woman’s heart alone, we must return unto that principle, that so many believe as we are ordained  			  <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_187"><font size="1">188</font></a>
  			 to life. For the fear of God, which went before the plain and manifest knowledge of Christ in Lydia, was also a fruit of free election. The describers of situations of places  			  <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">189</font></a>
  			 say, that Thyratira is a city of Lydia situate upon the side of the river called Hermus, and that it was sometimes called Pelopia; but some there be who attribute it to Phrygia, some to Mysia.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.iii-p25"></a><a name="iv.iii-p25.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.iii-p26"></a><b>15.</b><i> When she was baptized.</i> Hereby it appeareth how effectually God wrought in Lydia even in a short moment. For it is not to be doubted but that she received and embraced the faith of Christ sincerely, and gave him her name, before Paul would admit her unto baptism. This was a token of mere readiness; also, her 			 holy zeal and godliness do therein show themselves, in that she doth also consecrate her family to God. And, surely, all the godly ought to have this desire, to have those who are under them to be partakers of the same faith. For he is unworthy to be numbered among the children of God, and to be a ruler over others, whosoever is desirous to reign and rule in his own house over his wife, children, servants, and maids, and will cause them to give no place to Christ. Therefore, let every one of 			 the faithful study to govern and order his house so, that it may be an image of the Church. I grant that Lydia had not in her hand the hearts of all those which were of her household, that she might turn unto Christ whomsoever she would;   			  <a name="fr_189"></a><a href="#fn_189"><font size="1">190</font></a>
  			  but the Lord did bless her godly desire, so that she had her household obedient. The godly (as we have already said) must endeavor, with might and main, to drive from their houses all manner of superstition; secondly, that they have not profane families, but that they keep them under the fear of the Lord. So Abraham, the father of the faithful, was commanded to circumcise all his servants with him; and he is commanded for the care he had to govern his house, and to 			 instruct his family. Furthermore, if this duty be required at the hands of the householder, much more of a prince, that he suffer not so much as in him lieth the name of God to be profaned in his realm.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.iii-p28"></a><i>She besought them, saying.</i> This hath the force of an adjuration, when she saith, if ye have judged me faithful; as if she should say, I beseech you by that faith which you have approved by baptism, that ye refuse not to lodge with me; and Lydia did by such an earnest desire testify how entirely she loved the gospel. Nevertheless, it is not to be doubted but 			 that the Lord gave her such an affection, to the end Paul might be the more encouraged to proceed, not only because he saw that he was liberally and courteously entertained, but also because he might thereby judge of the fruit of his doctrine. Therefore, this was not the woman’s inviting only, but also God’s to keep Paul and his company there, to which end that tendeth also that Lydia enforced them, as if God did lay hand upon them, and stay them in the woman’s person.</p>  <a name="iv.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="iv.iv-p5"></a><b>16.</b> Luke prosecuteth the increase of the Church; for though he do not straightway in a word express that thing, yet is it easily gathered out of the text, that many were brought into the faith, or at least that the Church was somewhat augmented, and Paul did not frequent the assemblies in time of prayer in vain. Notwithstanding, Luke doth also report that Satan did interrupt this course; to wit, because after that the apostles were 			 beaten with rods, and cast in [into] prison, they were at length enforced to depart the city; yet we shall see in the end of this chapter, that when Satan had done his worst, there was some body of the Church gathered before they did depart.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.iv-p6"></a><i>Having a spirit of divination,</i> (or of Python.) The poets do feign that the serpent called Python was slain with the dart of Phoebus; hereupon rose another invention;   			  <a name="fr_190"></a><a href="#fn_190"><font size="1">191</font></a>
  			  that they said, that those who were possessed were inspired with the spirit of Python, and, peradventure, they were thereupon called Phoebades, in honor of Apollo. But Luke followeth the common custom of speaking, because he showeth the error of the common people, and not through what inspiration the maid did prophesy. For it is certain that the devil did deceive men under the visor of Apollo, as all idolatry and subtilty was invented and forged in his shop. But 			 some men may marvel that the devil (through whose motion and persuasion the maid did cry) was the author of such an honorable commendation, wherewith she adorned Paul and Silas, and the rest. For, seeing that he is the father of lying, how could the truth proceed from him? Secondly, how is it that he gave place willingly to the servants of Christ, by whom his kingdom was destroyed? how can this hang together, that he prepared the minds of the people to hear the gospel, whose mortal enemy he is? 			 Assuredly, there is nothing more proper to him than to turn away the minds of the people from the word of the gospel, which he doth now will and wish them to hear.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.iv-p8"></a>Whence cometh such a sudden change, or unwonted emotion? But the devil is the father of lying in such sort, that he covereth himself under the ale and deceivable color of truth. There he played another person through his crafty subtilty, than was agreeable to his nature;  			  <a name="fr_191"></a><a href="#fn_191"><font size="1">192</font></a>
  			 that by creeping in craftily he might do the more hurt; and, therefore, whereas he is called the father of lies, we must not so take it as if he did always lie manifestly and without any color. Yea, rather we must beware of his crafty subtilty, lest when he pretendeth the color of truth he deceive us under a vain show. We see, also, how he useth like subtilty daily. For what can bear a fairer show than the Pope’s titles, wherein he doth not boast himself to be the adversary of Christ, 			 but he doth not boast himself to be the adversary of Christ, but his vicar? What can be more plausible than that solemn preface, In the name of the Lord, Amen? Notwithstanding we know, that whilst the hypocritical ministers of Satan do thus pretend the truth, they corrupt it, and, with a deadly corruption, infect it. Seeing that Satan hath a double way to resist the gospel, to wit, because he doth sometimes rage openly, and sometimes he creepeth in craftily under lies, he hath also two kinds of 			 lying and deceiving, either when he overthroweth the Word of God with false doctrines and gross superstitions, or else when he doth craftily feign that he is a friend of the Word, and so doth insinuate himself subtilely;  			  <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">193</font></a>
  			 yea, he doth never hurt more deadly than when he transformeth himself into an angel of light. Now, we perceive to what end that so gorgeous a title did tend, wherewith he did extol Paul and his companions, namely, because it was not so convenient for him to make open war against the gospel, he went about to overthrow the credit thereof by secret shifts. For if Paul had admitted that testimony, there should have been no longer any difference between the wholesome  			  <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="#fn_193"><font size="1">194</font></a>
  			 doctrine of Christ and the mocks of Satan. The light and brightness of the gospel should have been entangled in the darkness of lying, and so quite put out.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.iv-p12"></a>But the question is, why God doth grant Satan so great liberty, as to suffer him to deceive miserable men, and to bewitch them with true divinations? For, omitting the disputations which some men move concerning his foresight, I take this for a plain case, that he doth prophesy and foretell things to come, and which are hidden only through God’s sufferance. But God seemeth by this means to lay open men who are reckless or careless to his 			 subtilty, so that they cannot beware. For seeing that prophecies breathe out divine power, men’s minds must needs be touched with reverence so often as they come abroad, unless they contemn God. I answer, that Satan hath never so much liberty granted him of God, save only that the unthankful world may be punished, which is so desirous of a lie, that it had rather be deceived than obey the truth. For that is a general evil, whereof Paul complaineth in the first chapter to the Romans,(<a name="iv.iv-p12.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021">Ro 1:21</a><a name="iv.iv-p12.1"></a>,) That men do not glorify God, being known naturally by the creation of the world, and that they suppress his truth unjustly.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.iv-p13"></a>It is a just reward for so great unthankfulness, that Satan hath the bridle given him, that through divers jugglings he may work the ruin of those who turn away maliciously from the light of God. Therefore, so often as you read the divinations of Satan, think upon the just judgment of God. Now, if God so sharply punish the contempt of his light in the profane Gentiles, who have no other teachers but the heaven and earth, how much more sharp 			 punishment do those deserve who wittingly and willingly choke the pure doctrine of salvation, revealed to them in the law and the gospel? No marvel, therefore, if Satan have long bewitched the world so freely with his subtilty, since that the truth of the gospel hath been wickedly contemned, which was made most manifest. But it is objected again, that no man is free from danger when false divinations fly to and fro so fast. For even as well the good as the evil seem to be subject to the 			 cozenage of Satan when the truth is darkened and overcast. The answer is ready, though Satan set snares for all men in general, yet are the godly delivered by the grace of God, lest they be caught together with the wicked. There is also a more manifest distinction set down in the Scripture, because the Lord doth by this means try the faith and godliness of his, and doth make blind the reprobate, that they may perish as they be worthy. Therefore Paul saith plainly, that Satan hath not leave 			 granted him to lead any into error save those who will not obey God and embrace the truth, (<a name="iv.iv-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011">2 Thess. 2:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#012">12</a><a name="iv.iv-p13.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.iv-p14"></a>Whereby is also reproved their wicked ungodliness, who, under this color, excuse the profane contempt of all doctrine; whither shall we turn ourselves, (say they,) seeing that Satan is so expert to deceive? Therefore, it is better for us to live without any religion at all, than, through the desire of religion, to run headlong into destruction. Neither do they object and pretend this fear for their excuse in earnest; but, seeing they desire 			 nothing more than to wander carelessly, like beasts, without any fear of God, they can be content with any excuse, so they be not tied to any religion. I confess, indeed, that Satan doth no less craftily than wickedly abuse the sacred name of God; and that that proverb is too true which Papistry hath brought forth, that, the Lord doth pronounce that he will be the teacher of the humble, and hath promised that he will be nigh to those which are right in heart; seeing that Paul teacheth that the 			 Word of God is the sword of the Spirit; seeing that he doth testify that those who are well-grounded in the faith of the gospel are not in danger to be seduced by man; seeing that Peter calleth the Scripture a light shining in a dark place; seeing that courteous exhortation, or inviting of Christ, can never deceive us, “Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you;” let Satan do what he can, and let the false prophets seek to darken the truth so much as they are able, we need 			 not be afraid lest the Spirit of wisdom and discretion [discernment] forsake us, who ruleth  			  <a name="fr_194"></a><a href="#fn_194"><font size="1">195</font></a>
  			 Satan at his pleasure, and maketh us triumph over him by the faith of his word.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iv-p17"></a><b>18.</b><i> Paul took it grievously.</i> It may be that at the first Paul neglected, and did not greatly regard the crying of the maid, because he hoped that there would be no account made thereof, and had rather that it should vanish away of itself. But the continual repetition doth at length make him weary; because, if he had any long dissembled, 			 Satan would have waxed more and more insolent through his silence and patience. Secondly, he ought not to have broken out into this prohibition rashly, until he knew for a certainty that he was furnished with the power of God. For Paul’s commandment   			  <a name="fr_195"></a><a href="#fn_195"><font size="1">196</font></a>
  			  had been foolish and vain without the commandment of God. And this must be noted, lest any man condemn Paul of too great hastiness, because he encountered so valiantly with the unclean spirit. For he did not conceive any grief or indignation, save only that he saw that the stability of Satan would increase, unless he did betimes prevent it; neither did he attempt any thing without the motion of the Spirit; neither did he enter the conflict until he was armed with 			 power from heaven. Notwithstanding, he seemeth to be contrary to himself, seeing that he saith elsewhere that he rejoiceth upon what occasion soever he see the gospel preached, (<a name="iv.iv-p18.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018">Php 1:18</a><a name="iv.iv-p18.2"></a>,) even by wicked men, and such as did study of set purpose to bring him in contempt. I answer, that he had another more apt reason for himself in this place;   			  <a name="fr_196"></a><a href="#fn_196"><font size="1">197</font></a>
  			  because all men would have thought that the spirit of the maid had played with Paul;   			  <a name="fr_197"></a><a href="#fn_197"><font size="1">198</font></a>
  			  so that by that means the doctrine of the gospel should not only have come in [into] suspicion, but should also have come into great contempt.   			  <a name="fr_198"></a><a href="#fn_198"><font size="1">199</font></a>
  			  And to this end was it that Christ also did command the devil to hold his peace, (<a name="iv.iv-p21.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#025">Mr 1:25</a><a name="iv.iv-p21.2"></a>,) whereas notwithstanding he suffered his name to be extolled by unmeet and unworthy men, (<a name="iv.iv-p21.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#035">Lu 4:35</a><a name="iv.iv-p21.3"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.iv-p22"></a><i>I command thee.</i> We must note the form of speech; for as the miracle was about to have a double use, namely, that the power of Christ might be known; secondly, that he might declare that he had no fellowship with Satan’s jugglings; so Paul, in giving the authority and power to Christ alone, doth declare that he is only a minister; that done, he doth openly set 			 Christ against the devil,   			  <a name="fr_199"></a><a href="#fn_199"><font size="1">200</font></a>
  			  to the end that, by the conflict, all men may see that they be deadly enemies. For it was profitable that many should be awaked who had been given to such gross seducing, that being well purged, they might come to the true faith.</p>

And though the heat of zeal wherewith Paul was 			 provoked to anger did raise the whirlwind of persecution, yet is he not therefore to be blamed; neither did it any whit repent Paul that he had wrought the miracle, so that he did wish that were undone which was done, because he knew full well through what motion he had driven the devil out of the maid. Whereby we are taught that we must not rashly condemn things which are well done, and that which is taken in hand at the commandment of God, though an unhappy success follow; because God doth 			 then examine [test] the constancy of those which be his, until a more joyful and prosperous end drive away all sorrow. As touching the men, Luke expresseth the cause why they were so mad upon Paul; to wit, because their hope of filthy gain was gone. But though they were pricked forward with covetousness only to persecute the Gospel and the ministers thereof; yet they pretend a fair color, that it grieveth them that the public state should be perverted, that their ancient laws should be broken, 			 and peace troubled.

 <p><a name="iv.iv-p33"></a><b>21.</b> <i>Ordinances which.</i> They lean to a prejudice, lest the cause should come to be disputed; as the Papists deal with us at this day, this was decreed in a General Council; it is a more ancient and common opinion, than that is may be called in question; custom hath long time approved this; this hath been established by consent more than a thousand years 			 ago. But to what end tend all these things, save only that they may rob the Word of God of all authority? They make boast of man’s decrees, but in the mean season they leave no place at all for the laws of God. We may see only this place what force these prejudices ought to have. The laws of the Romans were excellent, but religion doth depend upon the Word of God alone. Therefore in this matter we must take great heed, that men being brough under, the authority of God alone do prevail, and that 			 he make all things which in the world are excellent subject to him.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iv-p35"></a><b>22.</b> <i>The multitude came together.</i> When Luke declareth that there was great encourses of the people made, after that a few men of no reputation, to wit, such as did juggle and cozen to get gain, and whose filthiness was well known, had made some stir; he reacheth with what fury the world rageth against Christ. 			 Foolishness and inconstancy are indeed common vices among all people, and almost continual, but the wonderful force of Satan doth therein betray itself, in that those who are in other matters modest and quiet, are for a matter of no importance in a heat,   			  <a name="fr_204"></a><a href="#fn_204"><font size="1">205</font></a>
  			  and became companions of most vile persons, when the truth must be resisted. There was never a whit more modesty to be found in the judges themselves, if we consider what was their duty. For they ought, by their gravity, to have appeased the fury of the people, and to have set themselves stoutly against their violence, they ought to have aided and defended the guiltless; but they lay hands on them outrageously, and renting their garments, they command them to be 			 stripped naked and whipt before they know the matter. Surely the malice of men is to be lamented;   			  <a name="fr_205"></a><a href="#fn_205"><font size="1">206</font></a>
  			  whereby it came to pass, that almost all the judgment-seats of the world, which ought to have been sanctuaries of justice, have been polluted with the wicked and sacrilegious oppugning of the gospel.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.iv-p38"></a>Notwithstanding, the question is, why they were cast in prison, seeing that they were already punished, for the prison was ordained for the keeping of men? They used this kind of correction, until they might know more; and so we see the servants of Christ more sharply handled than adulterers, robbers, and other most vile persons.  			  <a name="fr_206"></a><a href="#fn_206"><font size="1">207</font></a>
  			 Whereby appeareth more plainly that force of Satan in stirring up the minds of men, that they observe no show of judgment in persecuting the gospel. But though the godly be more hardly handled for defending the truth of Christ, than are the wicked for their wickedness; yet it goeth well with the godly, because they triumph gloriously before God and his angels in all injuries which they suffer. They suffer reproach and slander; but because they know that the marks of Christ are in 			 greater price and more esteemed in heaven than the vain pomps of the earth, the more wickedly and reproachfully the world doth vex them, the greater cause have they to rejoice. For if profane writers did so honor Themistocles, that they preferred his prison before the seat and court of judges; how much more honorably must we think of the Son of God, whose cause is in hand so often as the faithful suffer persecution for the gospel? Therefore, though the Lord suffered Paul and Silas to be 			 scourged and imprisoned by the wicked judges, yet he did not suffer them to be put to any shame, but that which turned to their greater renown. For seeing that those persecutions, which we must suffer for the testimony of the gospel, are remnants of the sufferings of Christ; like as our Prince turned the cross, which was accursed, into a triumphant [triumphal] chariot, so he shall, in like sort, adorn the prisons and gibbets of his, that they may there triumph over Satan and all the wicked.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.iv-p40"></a><i>Renting their garments.</i> Because the old interpreter had truly translated this, it was evil done of Erasmus to change it, that the magistrates did rent their own garments. For this was Luke’s meaning only, that the holy men were outrageously   			  <a name="fr_207"></a><a href="#fn_207"><font size="1">208</font></a>
  			  beaten, the lawful order of judgment being neglected, and that they laid hands on them with such violence that their garments were rent. And this had been too far disagreeing with the custom of Romans, for the judges to cut [rend] their own garments publicly in the market-place; especially seeing the question was concerning an unknown religion, for which they did not greatly care; but I will not long stand about a plain matter.</p>  <a name="iv.v"></a>

 <p><a name="iv.v-p5"></a><b>23.</b><i> That he should keep them safe.</i> Whereas the magistrates command that Paul and Silas should be kept so diligently, it was done to this end, that they might know more of the matter. For they had already beaten them with rods to appease the tumult. And this is that which I said of late, that the world doth rage with such blind fury against 			 the ministers of the gospel, that it doth keep no mean in severity. But as it is very profitable for us, for example’s sake, to know how uncourteously and uncomely the witnesses of Christ were entertained in times past; so it is no less profitable to know that which Luke addeth immediately concerning their fortitude and patience. For even when they lay bound with fetters, he saith that in prayer they lauded God, whereby it appeareth that neither the reproach with they suffered, nor the stripes 			 which made their flesh smarter, nor the stink of the deep dungeon, nor the danger of death, which was hard at hand, could hinder them from giving thanks to the Lord joyfully and with glad hearts.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.v-p6"></a>We must note this general rule, that we cannot pray as we ought, but we must also praise God. For though the desire to pray arise of the feeling of our want and miseries, and therefore it is, for the most part, joined with sorrow and carefulness;  			  <a name="fr_208"></a><a href="#fn_208"><font size="1">209</font></a>
  			 yet the faithful must so bridle their affections, that they murmur not against God; so that the right form of prayer doth join two affections together, (to look too contrary,) [viz.] carefulness and sorrow, by reason of the present necessity which doth keep us down, and joyfulness, by reason of the obedience whereby we submit ourselve to God, and by reason of the hope which, showing us the haven high at hand, doth refresh us even in the midst of shipwreck. Such a form doth Paul 			 prescribe to us. Let your prayers (saith he) be made known to God with thanksgiving, (<a name="iv.v-p7.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006">Php 4:6</a><a name="iv.v-p7.2"></a>.) But in this history we must note the circumstances. For though the pain of the stripes were grievous, though the prison were troublesome, though the danger were great, seeing that Paul and Silas cease not to praise God, we gather by this how greatly they were encouraged to bear the cross. So Luke reported 			 before that the apostles rejoiced, because they were counted worthy to suffer reproach for the name of the Lord, (<a name="iv.v-p7.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041">Ac 5:41</a><a name="iv.v-p7.3"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.v-p8"></a><i>And those which lay bound.</i> We must know that Paul and Silas prayed aloud, that they might make the boldness of a good conscience known to others who were shut up in the same prison; for they might have made their prayer with secret groaning and sighing of heart as they were wont, or they might have prayed unto the Lord quietly and softly. 			 Why do they then exalt their voice? Assuredly, they do not that for any ambition; but that they may profess, that, trusting to the goodness of their cause, they fly without fear unto God. Therefore, in their prayers was included a confession of faith, which did appertain unto a common example, and prepared as well the malefactor’s as the jailer’s house to consider the miracle.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v-p9"></a><a name="iv.v-p9.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.v-p10"></a><b>26.</b> <i>There was an earthquake.</i> The Lord, in showing this visible sign, meant chiefly to provide for his servants, that they might more manifestly know that they prayers were heard; yet he had respect also of the rest. He could have loosed the fetters of Paul and Silas without an earthquake, and also have opened the 			 gates. But that addition served not a little to confirm them, seeing that the Lord, for their sakes, did shake both the air and also the earth. Again, it was requisite that the keeper of the prison and the rest should feel the presence of God, lest they should think that the miracle came by chance. Neither is it to be doubted, but that the Lord did then show a token of his power, which should be profitable for all ages; so that the faithful may fully assure themselves that he will be nigh unto 			 them so often as they are to enter   			  <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">210</font></a>
  			  combats and dangers for the defense of the gospel. Nevertheless, he doth neither always keep the same course, to testify his presence by manifest signs; neither is it lawful for us to prescribe him a law. For he did help his by manifest miracles then for this cause, that we may be content with his hidden grace at this day; concerning which matter we have spoken more upon the second chapter.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.v-p12"></a><a name="iv.v-p12.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.v-p13"></a><b>27.</b> <i>When the keeper of the prison was awaked.</i> He would have slain himself that he might prevent punishment; for it had been a foolish answer to have said that the doors were opened of their own accord. But this question may be asked, Seeing that Paul seeth that they might have some hope to escape if he should slay 			 himself, why doth he hinder him? for he seemeth by this means to refuse the deliverance which was offered by God; yea, it seemeth to have been a mere toy,   			  <a name="fr_210"></a><a href="#fn_210"><font size="1">211</font></a>
  			  in that the Lord would have the jailer awaked, lest there should be any use   			  <a name="fr_211"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">212</font></a>
  			  of the miracle. I answer, that we must in this place have respect unto his counsel and purpose. For he did not loose Paul and Silas, and the rest, from their fetters, neither did he, therefore, open the doors, that he might straightway let them go free; but that, by showing the power of his hand, he might seal up the faith of Paul and Silas, and might make the name of Christ glorious among others. Therefore, he doth so yield to the petitions of Paul and Silas, that 			 he showeth that he is able enough to deliver them so often as he shall think it good; and that nothing can hinder him, but that he is able to enter not only into prisons, but also into graves, that he may deliver those that be his.   			  <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">213</font></a>
  			  He opened the gates of the prison to Peter to another end, as we saw in chapter twelve. But now, forasmuch as he had another way in readiness to deliver Paul and Silas, he meant not so much to deliver them for the present time by miracle, as to confirm them against the time to come. Again, we must call that to mind which I said of late, that the opening of the prison appertained unto others, that it might be known to many witnesses that God did favor the doctrine, 			 which was now burthened with an unjust prejudice. Undoubtedly, Paul perceived this; and therefore, though his hands were loosed, he did not once wag from his place.   			  <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">214</font></a>
  			  He might have gone away, if he had been so disposed. Why doth he not? Was it because he contemned the grace of God? or because, through his slothfulness, he will make the miracle frustrate? None of all these is probable; whence we gather that he was holden by God, as the Lord useth to direct the minds of those which be his in doubtful matters, that they may follow sometimes ignorantly, sometimes wittingly, that which is expedient to be done, and not pass their 			 bounds.</p>  <a name="iv.vi"></a>

  			  Hereby it appeareth what a good thing it is for men to be thrown down from their pride, that they may learn to submit themselves to God. He was hardened in his superstitions; therefore, he might with a lofty stomach   			  <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="#fn_215"><font size="1">216</font></a>
  			  have despised whatsoever Paul and Silas should have said, whom he had reproachfully   			  <a name="fr_216"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">217</font></a>
  			  thrust into the innermost part of the prison. Now, fear maketh him apt to be taught and gentle. Therefore, so often as the Lord shall strike us or cast us down,   			  <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">218</font></a>
  			  let us know that this is done that we may be brought in [to] order from our too much haughtiness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.vi-p10"></a>But it is a wonder that he was not reproved for falling down at their feet. For why did Paul wink at that which (as Luke recordeth) Peter would not suffer in Cornelius? (<a name="iv.vi-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#026">Ac 10:26</a><a name="iv.vi-p10.1"></a>.) I answer, that Paul doth therefore bear with the keeper, because he knoweth that he was not moved with superstition, but with fear of God’s judgment so to humble himself. It was a 			 kind of worship common enough; but chiefly among the Romans it was a solemn thing when they would humbly crave any thing, or crave pardon, they fell down at their knees to whom they put their supplication. Therefore, there was no cause why Paul should be displeased with a man whom he saw simply humbled of God. For if there had been any thing committed contrary to the glory of God, he had not forgotten that zeal which he showed before among the men of Lycaonia. Therefore, by his silence, we 			 gather that in this kind of worship there was nothing contrary to godliness or the glory of God.</p>

  			  touched, so that he was ready to do what they should command him, whom not many hours before he had bound uncourteously.

But in this place the keeper (acknowledging the power of God) was not only a little afraid, so that he returned straightway unto his former cruelty, but he showeth himself obedient to God, and desirous of sound and wholesome doctrine. He demandeth how he may obtain salvation; whereby it appeareth more plainly that he was not suddenly taken with some light   			  <a name="fr_219"></a><a href="#fn_219"><font size="1">220</font></a>

 <p><a name="iv.vi-p16"></a><b>31.</b> <i>Believe in the Lord Jesus.</i> This is but a short, and, to look to, a cold and hungry definition of salvation, and yet it is perfect to believe in Christ. For Christ alone hath all the parts of blessedness and eternal life included in him, which he offereth to us by the gospel; and by faith we receive them, as I 			 have declared, (<a name="iv.vi-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009">Ac 15:9</a><a name="iv.vi-p16.1"></a>.) And here we must note two things; first, that Christ is the mark   			  <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_220"><font size="1">221</font></a>
  			  whereat faith must aim; and, therefore, men’s minds do nothing else but wander when they turn aside from him. Therefore, no marvel if all the divinity of Popery be nothing else but an huge lump   			  <a name="fr_221"></a><a href="#fn_221"><font size="1">222</font></a>
  			  and horrible labyrinth; because, neglecting Christ, they flatter themselves in vain and frivolous speculations. Secondly, we must note, that after we have embraced Christ by faith, that alone is sufficient to salvation. But the latter member, which Luke addeth by and by, doth better express the nature of faith, Paul and Silas command the keeper of the prison to believe in the Son of God. Do they precisely stay in this voice [word] only? Yea, it followeth in Luke, in 			 the text, [context,] that they preached the word of the Lord. Therefore, we see how the faith is not a light or dry opinion concerning unknown things, but a plain and distinct knowledge of Christ conceived out of the gospel. Again, if the preaching of the gospel be absent, there shall no faith remain any longer. To conclude, Luke coupleth faith with preaching and doctrine; and after that he hath briefly spoke of faith, he doth, by way of exposition, show the true and lawful way of believing. 			 Therefore, instead of that invention of entangled faith, whereof the Papists babble, let us hold faith unfolded in the word of God, that it may unfold to us the power of Christ.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.vi-p19"></a><a name="iv.vi-p19.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.vi-p20"></a><b>33.</b> <i>He was baptized, and all his household. </i>Luke doth again commend the godly zeal of the keeper, that he did consecrate all his whole house to the Lord; wherein doth also appear the grace of God, in that he brought all his whole family unto a godly consent. And we must also note the notable exchange: he was of 			 late about to murder himself, because he thought that Paul and the rest were escaped; but now laying aside all fear, he bringeth them home.   			  <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="#fn_222"><font size="1">223</font></a>
  			  So that we see how faith doth animate and encourage those to behave themselves stoutly who before had no heart. And surely, when we droop   			  <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">224</font></a>
  			  through fear and doubtfulness, there is no better matter of boldness than to be able to cast all our cares into God’s bosom; that no danger may terrify us from doing our duty, whilst that we look for an end at God’s hand, such as he shall see to be most profitable.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.vi-p24"></a><b>34.</b><i> He rejoiceth that he believed.</i> The external profession of faith was before commended in the jailer; now the inward fruit thereof is described. When he did lodge the apostles,   			  <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">225</font></a>
  			  and was not afraid of punishment, but did courteously entertain them in his own house, otherwise than he was enjoined by the magistrate, he did testify that his faith was not idle. And that joy whereof Luke speaketh in this place is a singular good thing, which every man hath from his faith. There is no great torment than an evil conscience; for the unbelievers, though the seek by all means to bring themselves into a certain amazedness, yet because they have no 			 peace with God, they must needs quake and tremble. But admit they perceive not their present torments, yea, they rage and play the madmen through mad and unbridled licentiousness; yet are they never quiet, neither do they enjoy quiet joy.   			  <a name="fr_225"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">226</font></a>
  			  Therefore, sincere and quiet stable joy proceedeth from faith alone, when we perceive that God is merciful to us. In this respect, Zacharias saith, “Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Sion, behold, they King cometh.” Yea, this effect is everywhere in the Scripture attributed to faith, that it maketh the souls joyful. Therefore, let us know that faith is not a vain or dead imagination, but a lively sealing [sense] of the grace of God, which bringeth perfect joy by 			 reason of the certainty of salvation, whereof it is meet that the wicked be void, who do both fly from the God of peace, and disturb all righteousness.</p>  <a name="iv.vii"></a>

 <p><a name="iv.vii-p5"></a><b>35.</b><i> When it was day.</i> The question is, how it came to pass that the judges did so suddenly change their purpose? The day before they had commanded that Paul and Silas should be bound with fetters, as if they meant to punish them cruelly, now they let them go free.

  			  But it appeareth that, forasmuch as the matter stood as yet still in one state, they were brought into repentance of their own accord. I answer, that there is no other thing here set down but that which falleth out most commonly when sedition is once raised. For not only the minds of the common people begin to rage, but also the tempest carrieth away the governors also, no doubt perversely. For we know that of Virgil, —</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.vii-p7"></a>“And as amidst a mighty rout, when discord oft is bred, And baser froward-minded men with furious rage are led; Forthwith flies fire, and stones are flung, madness doth tools supply, Then if on the sudden they do any one espy Whom love to commonwealth and just deserts have reverent made, They hush, and eke attentive stand, to hear what will be said: He governs both their will and rage, With words their wrath he doth assuage.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.vii-p8"></a>Therefore, there can be nothing more unseemly than what in a hot tumult the judges should be set on fire [along] with the people; but it falleth out so for the most part. Therefore, when those officers saw the people up, they thought there was cause enough why they should beat the apostles with rods. But now they are caused with shame and infamy to suffer punishment for their lightness, [levity.] Peradventure also, when they 			 inquire of the beginning of the tumult, they find those who had deceived the people   			  <a name="fr_227"></a><a href="#fn_227"><font size="1">228</font></a>
  			  in the fault. Therefore, when they had found out that Paul and Silas were innocent, they let them go, though too late. By which example, those which bear rule are taught to beware of too much haste. Again, we see how carelessly magistrates flatter   			  <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">229</font></a>
  			  themselves in their own offenses, which they know full well they have committed, especially when they have to do with unknown and base persons. When these men grant free liberty to Paul and Silas to depart, they are not ignorant that they had before done them injury; yet they think it will be sufficient if they do not continue to do them injury still, and to be more cruel upon them.   			  <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">230</font></a>
  			  The apparitors [officers] are called [<a name="iv.vii-p11.2"></a>ραβδουχοι], of the staves which they did bear; whereas the ensigns of the sergeants [lictors] were hatches bound with rods.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.vii-p12"></a><i>After that they have beaten us openly.</i> Their defense consisteth upon [of] two points, that they raged against, and cruelly intreated, the body of a man that was a Roman; secondly, that they did that contrary to the order of law. We shall see afterwards that Paul was a citizen of Rome. But it was straitly provided by Portius’ law, by the laws of Sempronius, and 			 also by many more, that no man should have power of life or death over any citizen of Rome but the people. Notwithstanding, it may seem to be a strange thing that Paul did not maintain [assert] his right before he was beaten with rods; for the judges might honestly excuse themselves by his silence; but it is to be thought that he was not heard in the midst of the tumult. If any man object that he doth now seek remedy too late, and out of season, yea, that he doth catch at a vain and foolish 			 comfort,   			  <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">231</font></a>
  			  when he requireth that the magistrates come themselves, we may readily answer, Paul was like to fare never a whit the better therefore; but we must mark that he meant nothing less than to provide for his own private commodity; but that he might ease the brethren somewhat afterward,   			  <a name="fr_231"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">232</font></a>
  			  that the magistrates might not be so bold as to rage so freely against the good and innocent brethren. Because he had gotten their heads under his girdle,   			  <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">233</font></a>
  			  he translated his right to help the brethren, that they might be borne with. This was the cause for which he did chide them. And so Paul did wisely use the opportunity offered him; as we must neglect nothing which may take for the bridling of the enemies, that they take not to themselves so much liberty to oppress or vex the innocent, forasmuch as the Lord bringeth to our hands such helps not in vain. Notwithstanding, let us remember that if we have been injured in 			 anything, we must not repay injuries, but we must only endeavor to stay their lust, lest they hurt others in like sort.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.vii-p16"></a><a name="iv.vii-p16.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.vii-p17"></a><b>38.</b><i> They were afraid, because they were Romans.</i> They are not once moved with the other point, because they had handled innocents cruelly without discretion;   			  <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">234</font></a>
  			  and yet that was the greater reproach. But because they did not fear that any man would punish them, they were not moved with God’s judgment. This is the cause that they do carelessly pass over that which was objected concerning injury done by them, only they are afraid of the officers   			  <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">235</font></a>
  			  of the Romans, and lest they should be beheaded for violating the liberty in the body of a citizen. They knew that this was death if any of the chief governors [prefects] should commit it, then what should become of the officers of one free city?   			  <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">236</font></a>
  			  Such is the fear of the wicked, because they have an amazed   			  <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">237</font></a>
  			  conscience before God, they do long time flatter themselves in all sins, until the punishment   			  <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">238</font></a>
  			  of men hang over their heads.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.vii-p24"></a><b>40.</b><i> When they saw, etc.</i> They were desired to part presently; yet it became them to regard the brethren, lest the tender seed of the gospel should perish, and undoubtedly they would have tarried longer if they had been suffered, but the prayers and requests of the magistrates were imperious and armed, which they are enforced to obey. 			 Nevertheless, they foreslow [neglect] not their necessary duty, but they exhort the brethren to be constant. And whereas they went straight to Lydia, it is a token, that though the Church were increased, yet that woman was the chief even of a greater number, as touching diligence in duties of godliness;   			  <a name="fr_238"></a><a href="#fn_238"><font size="1">239</font></a>
  			  and that appeareth more plainly thereby, because all the godly were assembled in her house.</p>
