 <p><a name="x.i-p2"></a><b>1.</b> Men, brethren, and fathers, hear mine excuse which I make now before you. <b>2.</b> And when they heard that he spake to them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more silence: And he said, <b>3.</b> I truly am a man, a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city of Cilicia, and brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day. 				  <b>4.</b> And I persecuted this way unto death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women. <b>5.</b> As the chief priest doth bear me witness, and all the older of elders, of whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound to Jerusalem, that they might be punished.</p>

 <p><a name="x.i-p5"></a>Though we may guess by the beginning of this speech what was Paul’s drift, yet because he was interrupted, we know not certainly what he was about to say. The sum of that part which is refitted is this, that forasmuch as he was well and faithfully instructed in the doctrine of the law, he was a godly and religious worshipper of God in the sight of the world. Secondly, that he was an enemy to the gospel of Christ, so that he was counted among the 			 priests one of the principal maintainers and defenders of the law. Thirdly, that he did not change his sect unadvisedly; but that being tamed and convict by an oracle from heaven, he gave his name to Christ. Fourthly, that he did not embrace unknown things, but that God appointed him a faithful teacher, of whom he learned all things perfectly. Lastly, that when he was returned to Jerusalem, and sought to do good to his countrymen, God did not permit him. So that he brought not the doctrine of 			 salvation unto foreign nations without good consideration, or because he hated his own nation, but being commanded by God so to do.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.i-p6"></a><b>1.</b><i> Men, brethren, and fathers.</i> It is a wonder that he giveth so great honor yet to the desperate enemies of the gospel, for they had broken all bond of brotherly fellowship, and by oppressing the glory of God, had spoiled themselves of all titles of dignity. But because Paul speaketh in this place as some one of the 			 people, he speaketh so lovingly unto the body itself, and useth towards the heads words honorable without dissembling. And surely because their casting off was not made known as yet, though they were unworthy of any honor, yet it was meet that Paul should reverently acknowledge in them the grace of God’s adoption. Therefore, in that he calleth them brethren and fathers, he doth not so much regard what they have deserved, as into what degree of honor God had exalted them. And all his oration is 			 so framed that he goeth about to satisfy them, freely indeed, and without flattering, yet humbly and meekly. Therefore, let us learn so to reverence and honor men that we impair not God’s right. For which cause the pope’s pride is the more detestable, who, seeing he hath made himself an high priest without the commandment of God and the consent of the Church, doth not only challenge to himself all titles of honor, but also such tyranny, that he goeth about to bring Christ in subjection; as if 			 when God doth exalt men he did resign up his right and authority to them, and did stoop down to them.</p>

 <p><a name="x.i-p8"></a><b>2.</b><i> That he spake Hebrew.</i> This is indeed an usual thing, that when men which speak diverse languages are together, we hear those more willingly who speak our own language; but the Jews were moved with another peculiar cause, because they imagined that Paul was offended   			  <a name="fr_496"></a><a href="#fn_496"><font size="1">497</font></a>
  			  with his own kindred, so that he did even hate their tongue, or that he was some rogue which had not so much as learned the speech of that nation whereof he said he came. Now, so soon as they heard their own language, they began to have some better hope. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether Paul spake in the Hebrew or in the Syrian tongue; for we know that the speech of the Jews was corrupt and degenerate after their exile, forasmuch as they had much from the 			 Chaldeans and Syrians. For mine own part, I think, that because he spake as well to the common sort as unto the elders, he used the common speech which was at that day usual.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="x.i-p10"></a><a name="x.i-p10.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.i-p11"></a><b>3.</b> <i>I am a Jew.</i> As all things were out of order at that day among the Jews, many rogues and vagabonds, to the end they might have some shroud for their wickedness, did falsely boast that they were Jews. Therefore, to the end Paul may acquit himself of this suspicion, he beginneth at his birth; 			 that done, he declareth that he was known in Jerusalem, because he was brought up there of [from] a child; though this latter thing seemeth to be spoken not only for certainty’s sake, but because it skilled much that this should also be known how well he had been instructed.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.i-p12"></a>There is nothing more bold to cause trouble than unlearned men. And at that day the government of the Church was so decayed, that religion was not only subject to sects, but also miserably mangled and torn in pieces. Therefore, Paul nameth his master, lest any man may think that he had not been nousled up in learning,  			  <a name="fr_497"></a><a href="#fn_497"><font size="1">498</font></a>
  			 and therefore had he forsaken the worship of the fathers; as many men, who are not trained up in learning, forget their nature and grow out of kind.  			  <a name="fr_498"></a><a href="#fn_498"><font size="1">499</font></a>
  			 But Paul saith chiefly that he was well taught in the law, that the Jews may understand that it was not through ignorance (as it falleth out oftentimes) that he causeth such ado, and doth counterfeit their monsters.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.i-p15"></a>It is to be doubted whether this be that Gamaliel of whom mention is made before, (<a name="x.i-p15.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034">Ac 5:34</a><a name="x.i-p15.1"></a>). Scholars are said to sit at their masters’ feet, because forasmuch as they be not as­ yet of strong and sound judgment, they must bring such modesty and aptness to be taught, that they must make all their senses subject to their masters, and must depend upon their mouth. 			 So Mary is said to sit at Jesus’ feet (<a name="x.i-p15.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#039">Lu 10:39</a><a name="x.i-p15.2"></a>) when she giveth ear to his doctrine. But and if such reverence be due to earthly masters, how much more ought we to prostrate ourselves before the feet of Christ, that we may give ear to him when he teacheth us out of his heavenly throne? This speech doth also put boys and young men in remembrance of their duty, that they be not stout nor stubborn, or that they be 			 not puffed nor lifted up against their masters through some foolish confidence, but that they suffer themselves quietly and gently to be framed by them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.i-p16"></a><i>Taught in the law of the fathers.</i> The old interpreter doth translate it word for word, taught <i>according to the truth of the fathers’ law, </i>saving that <a name="x.i-p16.1"></a>ἀκρίβεια is rather a <i>perfect way</i>   			  <a name="fr_499"></a><a href="#fn_499"><font size="1">500</font></a>
  			  than <i>truth. </i>Notwithstanding the question is, What he meaneth by this perfect way, seeing all of them had one and the same form of the law? He seemeth to me to distinguish that purer form of knowledge wherein he had been trained up from the common instruction, which did more disagree with the true and natural meaning of the law. And although the law of the Lord was then corrupt by many additions, even among the best 			 doctors, yet because religion was altogether there corrupt among many, Paul doth for good causes boast, that he was both well and also diligently instructed in the law of the fathers; or (which is all one) exactly or perfectly, lest any man should think that he had gotten only some small smattering, as if he were one of the common sort.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.i-p18"></a>But because many who are well taught are, notwithstanding, full stuffed with Epicurish contempt of God, he declareth that he was zealous toward God; as if he should say, that the serious study of godliness was annexed to doctrine, so that he meant not to daily in holy things, as profane men do of set purpose confound all things.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.i-p19"></a>But because this his zeal was altogether rash, he maketh himself like to the other Jews for that time. Notwithstanding, this may be taken in good part, that he did long ago no less worship God from his heart than they did then.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="x.i-p20"></a><a name="x.i-p20.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.i-p21"></a><b>4.</b> <i>I persecuted this way. </i>This is the second point, that he was an enemy to Christ’s doctrine, and that he was more fervent in resisting the same than all the rest, until he was pulled back by the hand of God; which thing he saith the chief priests and elders can testify. Therefore, there can be no suspicion in such 			 a sudden change. Whereas he saith, that he had letters given him to deliver to the brethren, it must be referred unto the Jews, as if he had called them his countrymen; but he meant to appease them with a more honorable title. For this is Paul’s drift, that he may declare his natural and lawful beginning which he took of that nation;   			  <a name="fr_500"></a><a href="#fn_500"><font size="1">501</font></a>
  			  and also how desirous he was to be linked with them in friendship.</p>  <a name="x.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="x.ii-p2"></a><b>6.</b> And it happened that as I journeyed and drew near to Damascus about noon, that suddenly a great light shone round about me from heaven. <b>7.</b> And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? <b>8.</b> And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. <b>9.</b> And they which were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid: but they 				  heard not the voice of him which talked with me. <b>10.</b> Then I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go to Damascus; and there it shall be told thee what things be ordained for thee to do. <b>11.</b> And when I saw not by reason of the glory of the light, being led by the hand by those companions which were with me, I came to Damascus.</p> 				  			   		    		  
 <p><a name="x.ii-p3"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="x.ii-p4"></a><a name="x.ii-p4.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.ii-p5"></a><b>6.</b><i> And it happened.</i> Because this history was expounded more at large in the ninth chapter, I will only briefly touch those things which were there spoken. But this is peculiar to this present place, that Paul reckoneth up his circumstances, that by them he may prove that he was converted by God. And this is the third 			 member of the sermon; otherwise this change should have been thought to have proceeded of inconstancy, or rashness, or else it should not have been void of some infamy. For nothing is more intolerable than to start aside from the course of godliness which men have once entered; and also not to do that which they are commanded to do. Therefore, lest any man might suspect Paul’s conversion, he proveth by many miracles which he bringeth to light, that God was the author thereof. In the 			 night-season there appear oftentimes lightnings, which come of the hot exhalations of the earth; but this was more strange, that about noon a sudden light did not only appear, but did also compass him about like a lightning, so that through fear thereof he fell from his horse, and lay prostrate upon the ground. Another miracle, in that he heard a voice from heaven; another, in that his companions heard it not as well as he. Also, there follow other things, that, after that he was sent to 			 Damascus, the event is correspondent to the oracle; because Ananias cometh to meet him. Also, in that his sight is restored to him in a moment.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.ii-p6"></a><i>I fell to the earth.</i> As Paul was puffed up with Pharisaical pride, it was meet that he should be afflicted and thrown down, that he might hear Christ’s voice. He would not have despised God openly, neither durst he refuse the heavenly oracle; yet his mind should never have been framed unto the obedience of faith, if he had continued in his 			 former state; therefore, he is thrown down by violence, that he may learn to humble himself willingly. Furthermore, there is in Christ’s words only a brief reprehension, which serveth to appease the rage of Paul being so cruelly bent. Nevertheless, we have thence an excellent consolation, in that Christ taking upon him the person of all the godly, doth complain that whatsoever injury was done to them was done to him. And as there can no sweeter thing be imagined to lenify the bitterness of 			 persecution, than when we hear that the Son of God doth suffer not only with us, but also in us, so again, the bloody enemies of the gospel, who being now besotted with pride, do mock the miserable Church, shall perceive whom they have wounded.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="x.ii-p7"></a><a name="x.ii-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.ii-p8"></a><b>9.</b><i> They which were with me.</i> I showed in the other place, that there is no such disagreement in the words of Luke as there seemeth to be. Luke said there, that though Paul’s companions stood amazed, yet heard they a voice.   			  <a name="fr_501"></a><a href="#fn_501"><font size="1">502</font></a>
  			  But in this place he saith, they heard not the voice of him which spake to Paul though they saw the light. Surely it is no absurd thing to say that they heard some obscure voice; yet so that they did not discern it as Paul himself, whom alone Christ meant to stay and tame with the reprehension. Therefore, they hear a voice, because a sound doth enter into their ears, so that they know that some speaketh from heaven; they hear not the voice of him that spake to Paul, 			 because they understand not what Christ saith. Moreover, they see Paul compassed about with the light, but they see none which speaketh from heaven.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="x.ii-p10"></a><a name="x.ii-p10.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.ii-p11"></a><b>10.</b><i> What shall I do, Lord?</i> This is the voice of a tamed man, and this is the true turning unto the Lord; when laying away all fierceness and fury, we bow down our necks willingly to bear his yoke, and are ready to do whatsoever he commandeth us. Moreover, this is the beginning of well-doing, to ask the mouth of 			 God; for their labor is lost who think upon repentance without his word. Furthermore, in that Christ appointeth Ananias to be Paul’s master, he doth it not for any reproach, or because he refuseth to teach him; but by this means he meaneth to set forth, and also to beautify the outward ministry of the Church.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.ii-p12"></a>And even in the person of one man, he teacheth us  			  <a name="fr_502"></a><a href="#fn_502"><font size="1">503</font></a>
  			 that we must not grudge to hear him speak with the tongue of men. To the same end tendeth that which followeth immediately, that he was blind, until offering himself to become a scholar, he had declared  			  <a name="fr_503"></a><a href="#fn_503"><font size="1">504</font></a>
  			 the humility of his faith. God doth not indeed make blind all those whom he will lighten; but there is a general rule prescribed to all men, that those become foolish with themselves who will be wise to him.</p>  <a name="x.iii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption06"><a name="x.iii-p1"></a><a name="x.iii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#012">Acts 22:12-15</a><a name="x.iii-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="x.iii-p2"></a><b>12.</b> And one Ananias, a godly man according to the law, approved by the testimony of all the Jews which dwelt there, <b>13.</b> Coming unto me, and standing by me, said to me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And I receiving my sight, the same hour saw him. <b>14.</b> But he said to me, The God of our fathers hath prepared thee that thou mightest know his will, and see the Just, and hear a voice from his mouth. <b>15.</b> Because thou shalt 				  be his witness before all men of those things which thou hast seen and heard. <b>16.</b> And now why stayest thou? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, in calling upon the name of the Lord.</p> 				  			   		    		  
 <p><a name="x.iii-p3"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="x.iii-p4"></a><a name="x.iii-p4.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.iii-p5"></a><b>12.</b><i> One Ananias.</i> Paul proceedeth now unto the fourth point, to wit, that he did not only give his name to Christ, being astonished with miracles, but that he was also well and thoroughly instructed in the doctrine of the gospel. I have already said that Ananias met Paul, not by chance, but through the direction of 			 Christ. And whereas he giveth him the title of godliness as concerning the law, and saith that he was well reported of by the whole nation, in these words he preventeth the wrong   			  <a name="fr_504"></a><a href="#fn_504"><font size="1">505</font></a>
  			  opinion which they might conceive. As they loathed the Gentiles, so they would never have allowed any teacher coming from them; and one that had revolted from the law should have been most detestable. Therefore, he witnesseth that he worshipped God according to the law, and that his godliness was known and commended among all the Jews, so that they ought not to suspect him. These words, according to the law, are ignorantly, by some, coupled with the text following, 			 that he was approved according to the law. For Ananias’ religion is rather distinguished by this mark from the superstitions of the Gentiles. Though we must note, that the law is not mentioned to establish the merits of works, that they may be set against the grace of God; but Ananias’ godliness is clearly acquitted of all evil suspicion which might have risen among the Jews. And seeing that he restoreth sight to Paul with one word, it appeareth thereby that he was sent of God, as I have said 			 before.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="x.iii-p7"></a><a name="x.iii-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.iii-p8"></a><b>14.</b><i> The God of our fathers.</i> As nothing is more fit to provoke us joyfully to go forward toward God, than when we know that God doth prevent us with his free goodness, that he may call us back from destruction to life; so Ananias beginneth here. God, saith he, hath ordained thee to know his will. For by this means 			 Paul is taught that God had respect unto him at such time as he went astray, and was altogether an enemy to his own salvation; and so God’s predestination doth abolish all preparations which sophisters imagine, as if man did prevent God’s grace by his own free will. In calling him the God of the fathers, he reneweth the remembrance of the promises, that the Jews may know that the new calling of Paul is joined with them, and that those fall not away from the law who pass over unto Christ. 			 Therefore Paul confirmeth that by these words which he avouched before in his own person, that he had not made any departure from the God of Abraham, whom the Jews had in times past worshipped, but that he continueth in the ancient worship which the fathers did use, which he had learned out of the law.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.iii-p9"></a>Wherefore, when the question is about religion, let us learn by the example of Paul, not to imagine any new God, (as the Papists and Mahometans have done, and as all heretics use to do) but let us retain that God who hath revealed himself in times past to the fathers, both by the law, and also by diverse oracles. This is that antiquity wherein we must remain, and not in that whereof the Papists boast in vain, who have invented to themselves a 			 strange God, seeing they have forsaken the lawful fathers.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.iii-p10"></a>The same is to be said at this day of the Jews, whose religion, seeing it disagreeth with the law and the prophets, their God must also be degenerate and feigned. For he who would in times past be called the God of Abraham and of the fathers, appeared at length in the person of his Son, that he may now be called by his own name,  			  <a name="fr_505"></a><a href="#fn_505"><font size="1">506</font></a>
  			 or title, the Father of Christ. Therefore, he which rejecteth the Son hath not the Father, who cannot be separated from him. And Ananias saith, that it cometh to pass, through the free election of God, that the truth of the gospel doth now appear to Paul; whereupon it followeth, that he did not attain unto this by his own industry, which the experience of the thing did also declare. For nothing was more stubborn than Paul until Christ did tame him. And if we desire to know the cause 			 and beginning, Ananias calleth us back unto the counsel of God, whereby he was appointed and ordained; and assuredly it is a more precious thing to know the will of God, than that men can attain unto it by their own industry.  			  <a name="fr_506"></a><a href="#fn_506"><font size="1">507</font></a>
  			 That which Ananias affirmeth of Paul ought to be translated unto all, that the treasure of faith is not common to all;  			  <a name="fr_507"></a><a href="#fn_507"><font size="1">508</font></a>
  			 but it is offered peculiarly to the elect. Furthermore, it appeareth more plainly by the next member what this will of God is. For God spake at sundry times and many ways by his prophets, but last of all, he revealed and made known his will and himself wholly in his Son (<a name="x.iii-p13.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001">Heb 1:1</a><a name="x.iii-p13.2"></a>).</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.iii-p14"></a><i>To see the Just.</i> Seeing all the Greek books   			  <a name="fr_508"></a><a href="#fn_508"><font size="1">509</font></a>
  			  in a manner agree together in the masculine gender, I wonder why Erasmus would rather translate it in the neuter, <i>Which is Just; </i>which sense the readers see to be cold and far let [fetched]. Therefore, I do not doubt but that <i>Just </i>is taken in this place for Christ; and the text runneth very finely   			  <a name="fr_509"></a><a href="#fn_509"><font size="1">510</font></a>
  			  thus, because it followeth immediately after, <i>and hear a voice from his mouth. </i>And it is certain that all the godly and holy men did most of all desire that they might see Christ. Thence flowed that confession of Simeon,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="x.iii-p17"></a>“Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace; because mine eyes have seen thy salvation,” (<a name="x.iii-p17.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#029">Lu 2:29</a><a name="x.iii-p17.1"></a>).</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.iii-p18"></a>Therefore this seeing, which godly kings and prophets did most earnestly desire, as Christ himself doth witness, (<a name="x.iii-p18.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#024">Lu 10:24</a><a name="x.iii-p18.1"></a>) is not without cause extolled as a singular benefit of God. But because the sight of the eyes should profit little or nothing, which we know was to many deadly, he adjoineth the hearing of the voice. Ananias setteth down the cause why God 			 did vouchsafe Paul of so great honor, to wit, that he might be to his Son a public witness; and he doth so prepare him, that he may learn not only for himself alone,  			  <a name="fr_510"></a><a href="#fn_510"><font size="1">511</font></a>
  			 but that he may have so much the more care to profit, because he shall be the teacher of all the whole Church.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="x.iii-p20"></a><a name="x.iii-p20.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.iii-p21"></a><b>16.</b> <i>And now, why tarriest thou?</i> It is not to be doubted but that Ananias did faithfully instruct Paul in the principles of godliness; for he would not have baptized him if he had been void of true faith. But Luke passeth over many things, and doth briefly gather the sum. Therefore, seeing 			 Paul doth understand that the promised redemption is now given in Christ, Ananias saith, for good causes, that nothing ought to stay him from being baptized. But when he saith, Why tarriest thou? he doth not chide Paul, neither doth he accuse him of slackness, but he doth rather amplify the grace of God by adding baptism. The like sentence had we in the tenth chapter, (<a name="x.iii-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#047">Ac 10:47</a><a name="x.iii-p21.1"></a>)</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="x.iii-p22"></a>“Can any man let [hinder] those from being baptized with water who have the Holy Ghost given them even as we?”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.iii-p23"></a>But when he saith, Wash away thy sins, by this speech he expresseth the force and fruit of baptism, as if he had said, Wash away thy sins by baptism. But because it may seem that by this means more is attributed to the outward and corruptible element than is meet, the question is, whether baptism be the cause of our purging. Surely, forasmuch as the blood of Christ is the only means whereby our sins are washed away, and as it was once shed to 			 this end, so the Holy Ghost, by the sprinkling thereof through faith, doth make us clean continually. This honor cannot be translated unto the sign of water, without doing open injury to Christ and the Holy Ghost; and experience doth teach how earnestly men be bent upon this superstition. Therefore, many godly men, lest they put confidence in the outward sign, do overmuch extenuate the force of baptism. But they must keep a measure, that the sacraments may be kept within their bounds, lest they 			 darken the glory of Christ; and yet they may not want their force and use.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.iii-p24"></a>Wherefore, we must hold this, first, that it is God alone who washeth us from our sins by the blood of his Son; and to the end this washing may be effectual in us, he worketh by the hidden power of his Spirit. Therefore, when the question is concerning remission of sins, we must seek no other author thereof but the heavenly Father, we must imagine no other material cause but the blood of Christ; and when we be come to the formal cause, the 			 Holy Ghost is the chief. But there is an inferior instrument, and that is the preaching of the word and baptism itself. But though God alone doth work by the inward power of his Spirit, yet that doth not hinder but that he may use, at his pleasure, such instruments and means as he knoweth to be convenient; not that he includeth in the element anything which he taketh either from his Spirit or from the blood of Christ, but because he will have the sign itself to be an help for our infirmity.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.iii-p25"></a>Therefore, forasmuch as baptism doth help our faith, that it may reap forgiveness of sins by the blood of Christ alone, it is called the washing of the soul. So that the washing, spoken of by Luke, doth not note out the cause; but is referred unto the understanding of Paul, who, having received the sign, knew better that his sins were done away.  			  <a name="fr_511"></a><a href="#fn_511"><font size="1">512</font></a>
  			 Though we must also note this, that there is no bare figure set before us in baptism, but that the giving of the thing is thereto annexed; because God promised nothing deceitfully, but doth, indeed, fulfill that which under the signs he doth signify. Notwithstanding, we must again beware that we tie not the grace of God to the sacraments; for the external administration of baptism profiteth nothing, save only where it pleaseth God it shall. By this there is also another question 			 answered which may be moved. For seeing Paul had the testimony of the grace of God, his sins were already forgiven him. Therefore, he was not washed only by baptism, but he received a new confirmation of the grace which he had gotten.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.iii-p27"></a><i>In calling upon the name of the Lord.</i> It is out of question that he meaneth Christ, not because the name of Christ alone is called upon in baptism, but because the Father commandeth us to ask of him whatsoever is figured in baptism; neither doth the operation of the Spirit tend to any other end, saving that it may make us partakers of 			 his death and resurrection. Therefore, Christ is appointed to excel in baptism, yet inasmuch as he is given us of the Father, and inasmuch as he poureth out his graces upon us by the Holy Ghost. Whereby it cometh to pass that the calling upon the name of Christ containeth both the Father and the Son.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.iii-p28"></a>Wherefore, Ananias doth not mean, that the name of Christ must only be named, but he speaketh of prayer, whereby the faithful do testify, that the effect of the outward sign is in the power of Christ alone. For the sacraments have neither any power of salvation included in them, neither are they anything worth of themselves. Wherefore, this member is, as it were, a correction of the former saying, because Ananias doth, in plain words, send 			 Paul from reposing confidence in the external sign unto Christ.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.iii-p29"></a>It is well known how much the Papists differ from this rule, who tie the cause of grace to their exorcisms and enchantments; and they are so far from studying to direct the miserable people unto Christ, that they rather drown Christ in baptism, and pollute his sacred name by their enchantments.</p>  <a name="x.iv"></a>

  			  if Paul had not been cut off [stopped short] with their outrageous outcries. Notwithstanding, his drift and purpose doth plainly appear by the former text, [context] for he beginneth to intreat of his ministry, that he may show that he departed not from the Jews of his own accord, as if he withdrew him of malice from taking pains with them; but he was drawn unto the Gentiles contrary to his expectation and purpose. For he came purposely to Jerusalem, that he might 			 impart with his own nation that grace which was committed to him. But when the Lord cutteth off his hope which he had to do good, he driveth him thence. But there was a double offense which Paul goeth about to cure. For they both thought that the covenant of God was profaned if the Gentiles should be admitted into the Church together with them, and nothing did grieve the proud nation so much as that others should be preferred before them, or so much as made equal with them. Therefore Paul’s 			 defense consisteth in this, that he was ready, so much as in him <i>lay, </i>to do them the best service he could; but he was afterward enforced by the commandment of God to go to the Gentiles, because he would not have him to be idle at Jerusalem. Whereas Erasmus translateth it, That I was carried without myself, is in Greek word for word, That I was in a trance; whereby he meant to purchase credit to the oracle. Also the circumstance of the time and 			 place doth confirm the same, in that the Lord appeared to him as he prayed in the temple; which was an excellent preparation to hear the voice of God, Concerning the manner of seeing,   			  <a name="fr_513"></a><a href="#fn_513"><font size="1">514</font></a>

 <p><a name="x.iv-p9"></a><b>18.</b><i> Because they will not.</i> Though the commandment of God alone ought to be sufficient enough to bind us to obey, yet to the end Paul might be the more willing to follow, Christ showeth him a reason why he will have him depart out of Jerusalem; to wit, because he should lose his labor there; but he was not chosen to 			 that end that he might be idle, or do no good by teaching; though this were a sore trial, and such as we may think did sore shake him.   			  <a name="fr_514"></a><a href="#fn_514"><font size="1">515</font></a>
  			  Not long before the function of preaching the gospel was enjoined him, that his voice might sound throughout the whole world; now even at the first entrance he is inhibited; yea, his labor seemeth to be condemned of peculiar reproach when his witness [testimony] is rejected, because his person is hated. But it was meet that the holy servant of the Lord should be thus humbled, that all the preachers of the gospel might learn to give over themselves wholly to obey 			 Christ, that when they be excluded from one place, they may be ready immediately to go to another, and that they may not be discouraged, nor cease off from doing their duty, though they be undeservedly loathed.</p>

 <p><a name="x.iv-p12"></a><b>19.</b><i> Lord, they know.</i> By this speech Paul doth testify that he was not beside himself, or brought into perplexity,   			  <a name="fr_515"></a><a href="#fn_515"><font size="1">516</font></a>
  			  but that he did assuredly believe the oracle. For without doubt he knew Christ, whom he calleth Lord. And Paul objecteth, that it cannot almost be, but that when they see him so suddenly changed, such a spectacle will move them. Whence he gathereth that he shall not be unfruitful. He thought so indeed; but Christ answereth flatly, that he hath appointed him another charge, and he taketh from him the hope which he had in vain conceived touching the Jews. The question 			 is, whether it were lawful for Paul to object these reasons to Christ; for it is as much as if he did avouch that that is probable, which Christ said could not be. I answer, that God giveth his saints leave, familiarly, to utter their affections before him;   			  <a name="fr_516"></a><a href="#fn_516"><font size="1">517</font></a>
  			  especially when they seek no other thing but the confirmation of their faith.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.iv-p15"></a>If any man stand in his own conceit, or stubbornly refuse that which God commandeth, his arrogancy shall be worthily condemned; but God vouchsafeth his faithful servants of a singular privilege, that they may modestly object those things which may call them back from the desire to obey; to the end that being free from lets, they may wholly addict themselves to serve God; as Paul, after that he was taught that it pleased the Lord that it should 			 be so, he doth not gainsay nor contend any longer, but being content with that one exception, and making an end there, he maketh himself ready to take his journey, which he seemed to be loath to take. In the mean season, whereas the Jews are not touched with so many miracles, their stubbornness and pride, which cannot be tamed, is discovered. Which upbraiding did undoubtedly cause them to rage.</p>

 <p><a name="x.iv-p17"></a><b>22.</b> <i>Away with such a fellow.</i> Luke showeth here how outrageously Paul’s sermon was interrupted. For they do not only oppress him with their crying, but they desire to have him put to death; where it doth also plainly appear how frenzy [frenzied] pride is. The Jews conceived so great good 			 liking of themselves, that they did not only despise all the whole world in comparison of themselves, but they stood also more stoutly in defense of their own dignity than of the law itself, as if all religion did consist in this, that Abraham’s stock might excel all other mortal men. So now they rage against and rail upon Paul, because he said that he was sent to be the apostle of the Gentiles; as if God were bound by his own liberality to suffer the contempt of his power   			  <a name="fr_517"></a><a href="#fn_517"><font size="1">518</font></a>
  			  in the wicked and unthankful, on whom he bestowed excellent graces above all other. And it is no marvel if there were such fierceness and fury at that day among the Jews, seeing that being by all means wasted,   			  <a name="fr_518"></a><a href="#fn_518"><font size="1">519</font></a>
  			  and accustomed to suffer extreme reproaches at this day, they cease not, notwithstanding, to swell with servile pride. But these be fruits of reprobation, until God gather together the remnant according to Paul’s prophecy (<a name="x.iv-p19.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005">Ro 11:5</a><a name="x.iv-p19.2"></a>).</p>  <a name="x.v"></a>

 <p><a name="x.v-p6"></a><b>24.</b><i> The chief captain.</i> It was well and wisely done of the chief captain thus to withdraw Paul from the sight of the people, forasmuch as his presence did move and more provoke them who were already too much moved. For by this means he provideth for the life of the holy man, and partly appeaseth the madness of the 			 people. But when he com-mandeth him to be scourged, to whose charge he heard no certain crime laid, he seemeth to deal unjustly. And yet this injury [injustice] was not without color, because it was likely that it was, not without cause, that all the people had conspired to put one man to death. Therefore, a vehement presumption was the cause of so strait examination. But we must note that this is a common custom among politic men, that they be just judges, so far as is expedient for them; but 			 if they be called away by profit, then they go out of the way. Nevertheless, it is sufficient for them to color this their wickedness with the title of wisdom, because they hold that general principle, that the world cannot be governed without some show or color of justice; but in all actions that subtilty whereof I spake doth prevail, that they consider rather what is profitable than what is equal and right.</p>

 <p><a name="x.v-p8"></a><b>25.</b><i> Is it lawful?</i> He allegeth first the privilege of the city, then he defendeth himself by common law. And though there were more weight in the second point, (to wit, that it is not lawful to scourge a man before his cause is heard) yet should he have prevailed nothing, unless the centurion had been more moved with 			 the honor of the Roman empire. For nothing was then more heinous than to do any thing which was contrary to the liberty of the people of Rome. Valerius’ law, the law of Porcius, and of Sempronius, and such like, did forbid that no man should do any violence to the body of the city of Rome   			  <a name="fr_520"></a><a href="#fn_520"><font size="1">521</font></a>
  			  without the commandment of the people. The privilege was so (sure and) holy, that they thought it to be not only a deadly offense, but also such an offense as could not be purged, that a citizen of Rome should be beaten.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.v-p10"></a>Therefore, Paul escaped rather by the privilege than by common equity, yet did he not doubt in a good cause to bear off the injury which was prepared for him, with this buckler of the city. But we must know that he did so allege the right and privilege of the city, that the chief captain was brought to believe him, because his words should not hare been credited unless he had used some proof. Moreover, it was no hard matter for a man, who was 			 well known, to bring forth witnesses. We alleged a cause in the sixteenth chapter, why he suffered himself to be scourged at Philippos, [Philippi] which he now preventeth by his own declaration; to wit, because he should not have been heard in a tumult raised among the common people (<a name="x.v-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#037">Ac 16:37</a><a name="x.v-p10.1"></a>). But because he hath now to deal with the soldiers of Rome, who did behave themselves more moderately and gravely, he 			 useth the opportunity.</p>

 <p><a name="x.v-p12"></a><b>26.</b><i> This man is a Roman.</i> Some man may marvel that he was so credulous, who was appointed to be chief in examining Paul, that he doth affirm the thing, as if he knew it to be so. For if he ought to believe Paul’s words, every malefactor might, by this shift, have escaped punishment. But this was their manner of 			 dealing, he which did say that he was a citizen of Rome, unless he could bring in some which knew him, or prove it lawfully, he was punished; for it was death for any man to pretend the freedom of the city falsely. Wherefore, the centurion referreth the matter unto the chief captain, as doubting thereof; and he (as we have said) doth straightway examine the matter more thoroughly. And though Luke doth not express by what testimonies Paul did prove himself to be a citizen of Rome, yet, 			 undoubtedly, the chief captain knew the truth of the matter before he loosed him.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="x.v-p13"></a><a name="x.v-p13.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="x.v-p14"></a><b>28.</b><i> With a great sum.</i> The chief captain objecteth this to refute him as if he should say, that the freedom of the city is not so common, and easily to be obtained. How can it be that thou, being some base fellow of the country of the Cilicians, shouldst obtain this honor, for which I paid sweetly? Whereas Paul maketh 			 answer, that he was free born, who never saw the city, yea, whose father it may be was never there, there is no cause why this should trouble any man. For those who are skillful in the Roman history know that certain were made free of the city who dwelt in the provinces, if, having deserved well of the commonwealth, or in war, or in other weighty affairs, they did desire and crave this reward of the deputies, [proconsuls] so that it is no absurdity to say that he was born a citizen of Rome, 			 who, descending by his ancestors of some province far distant from Rome, did never set foot in Italy. Notwithstanding, the question is, how this can hang together, that the chief captain was afraid, because he had bound a citizen of Rome, and yet he did not loose him from his bonds until the morrow? It may be that he deferred it till the next day, lest he should show some token of fear. Notwithstanding, I think that the chief captain was afraid, because Paul was bound at his commandment, that 			 he might be scourged, because this was to do injury to the body of a citizen of Rome, and to break the common liberty, and that [although] it was lawful to put a Roman in prison.</p>
