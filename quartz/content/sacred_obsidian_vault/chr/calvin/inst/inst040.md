 <p class="introHead"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p1"></a>REDEMPTION FOR MAN LOST TO BE SOUGHT IN CHRIST.</p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p2"></a>The parts of this chapter are, I. The excellence of the doctrine of Christ the Redeemer—a doctrine always entertained by the Church, sec. 1. II. Christ, the Mediator in both dispensations, was offered to the faith of the pious Israelites and people of old, as is plain from the institution of sacrifice, the calling of Abraham’s family, and the elevation of David and his posterity, sec. 2. III. Hence the consolation, strength, hope, and confidence of the godly under the 				Law, Christ being offered to them in various ways by their heavenly Father.</p>  			 
 <p class="introHead"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p3"></a><i>Sections.</i></p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p4"></a>1. The knowledge of God the Creator of no avail without faith in Christ the Redeemer. First reason. Second reason strengthened by the testimony of an Apostle. Conclusion. This doctrine entertained by the children of God in all ages from the beginning of the world. Error of throwing open heaven to the heathen, who know nothing of Christ. The pretexts for this refuted by passages of Scripture.</p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p5"></a>2. God never was propitious to the ancient Israelites without Christ the Mediator. First reason founded on the institution of sacrifice. Second reason founded on the calling of Abraham. Third reason founded on the elevation of David’s family to regal dignity, and confirmed by striking passages of Scripture.</p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p6"></a>3. Christ the solace ever promised to the afflicted; the banner of faith and hope always erected. This confirmed by various passages of Scripture.</p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p7"></a>4. The Jews taught to have respect to Christ. This teaching sanctioned by our Saviour himself. The common saying, that God is the object of faith, requires to be explained and modified. Conclusion of this discussion concerning Christ. No saving knowledge of God in the heathen.</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p8"></a>  			 
 </p><p class="Body"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p9"></a>1. The whole human race having been undone in the person of Adam, the excellence and dignity of our origin, as already described, is so far from availing us, that it rather turns to our greater disgrace, until God, who does not acknowledge man when defiled and corrupted by sin as his own work, appear as a Redeemer in the person of his only begotten Son. Since our fall from life unto death, all that knowledge of God the Creator, of which we have discoursed, would be 				useless, were it not followed up by faith, holding forth God to us as a Father in Christ. The natural course undoubtedly was, that the fabric of the world should be a school in which we might learn piety, and from it pass to eternal life and perfect felicity. But after looking at the perfection beheld wherever we turn our eye, above and below, we are met by the divine malediction, which, while it involves innocent creatures in our fault, of necessity fills our own souls with despair. For 				although God is still pleased in many ways to manifest his paternal favour towards us, we cannot, from a mere survey of the world, infer that he is a Father. Conscience urging us within, and showing that sin is a just ground for our being forsaken, will not allow us to think that God accounts or treats us as sons. In addition to this are our sloth and ingratitude. Our minds are so blinded that they cannot perceive the truth, and all our senses are so corrupt that we wickedly rob God of his 				glory. Wherefore, we must conclude with Paul, “After that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p9.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021">1 Cor. 1:21</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p9.1"></a>). By the “wisdom of God,” he designates this magnificent theatre of heaven and earth replenished with numberless wonders, the wise contemplation of which should have enabled us to know God. But this we do with little profit; and, therefore, he invites us to faith in Christ,—faith which, by a 				semblance of foolishness, disgusts the unbeliever. Therefore, although the preaching of the cross is not in accordance with human wisdom, we must, however, humbly embrace it if we would return to God our Maker, from whom we are estranged, that he may again become our Father. It is certain that after the fall of our first parent, no knowledge of God without a Mediator was effectual to salvation. Christ speaks not of his own age merely, but embraces all ages, when he says “This is life eternal 				that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p9.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003">John 17:3</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p9.2"></a>). The more shameful therefore is the presumption of those who throw heaven open to the unbelieving and profane, in the absence of that grace which Scripture uniformly describes as the only door by which we enter into life. Should any confine our Saviour’s words to the period subsequent to the promulgation of the Gospel, the refutation is at hand; since on a ground common to all ages and nations, it 				is declared, that those who are estranged from God, and as such, are under the curse, the children of wrath, cannot be pleasing to God until they are reconciled. To this we may add the answer which our Saviour gave to the Samaritan woman “Ye worship ye know not what; we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p9.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022">John 4:22</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p9.3"></a>). By these words, he both charges every Gentile religion with falsehood, and assigns the reason—viz. that under the Law the Redeemer was promised to the chosen 				people only, and that, consequently, no worship was ever pleasing to God in which respect was not had to Christ. Hence also Paul affirms, that all the Gentiles were “without God,” and deprived of the hope of life. Now, since John teaches that there was life in Christ from the beginning, and that the whole world had lost it (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p9.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004">John 1:4</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p9.4"></a>), it is necessary to return to that fountain; And, accordingly, Christ declares that inasmuch as he is a propitiator, he is life. And, indeed, the inheritance of 				heaven belongs to none but the sons of God (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p9.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006">John 15:6</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p9.5"></a>). Now, it were most incongruous to give the place and rank of sons to any who have not been engrafted into the body of the only begotten Son. And John distinctly testifies that those become the sons of God who believe in his name. But as it is not my intention at present formally to discuss the subject of faith in Christ, it is enough to have thus touched on it in passing.</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p10"></a>2. Hence it is that God never showed himself propitious to his ancient people, nor gave them any hope of grace without a Mediator. I say nothing of the sacrifices of the Law, by which believers were plainly and openly taught that salvation was not to be found anywhere but in the expiation which Christ alone completed. All I maintain is that the prosperous and happy state of the Church was always founded in the person of Christ. For although God embraced the whole 				posterity of Abraham in his covenant, yet Paul properly argues (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016">Gal. 3:16</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.1"></a>), that Christ was truly the seed in which all the nations of the earth were to be blessed, since we know that all who were born of Abraham, according to the flesh, were not accounted the seed. To omit Ishmael and others, how came it that of the two sons of Isaac, the twin brothers, Esau and Jacob, while yet in the womb, the one was chosen and the other rejected? Nay, how came it that the first-born was rejected, and the 				younger alone admitted? Moreover, how happens it that the majority are rejected? It is plain, therefore, that the seed of Abraham is considered chiefly in one head, and that the promised salvation is not attained without coming to Christ, whose office it is to gather together those which were scattered abroad. Thus the primary adoption of the chosen people depended on the grace of the Mediator. Although it is not expressed in very distinct terms in Moses, it, however, appears to have been 				commonly known to all the godly. For before a king was appointed over the Israelites, Hannah, the mother of Samuel, describing the happiness of the righteous, speaks thus in her song, “He shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed;” meaning by these words, that God would bless his Church. To this corresponds the prediction, which is afterwards added, “I will raise me up a faithful priest, and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010">1 Sam. 2:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#035">35</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.2"></a>). And there 				can be no doubt that our heavenly Father intended that a living image of Christ should be seen in David and his posterity. Accordingly, exhorting the righteous to fear Him, he bids them “Kiss the Son,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012">Psalm 2:12</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.3"></a>). Corresponding to this is the passage in the Gospel, “He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023">John 5:23</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.4"></a>). Therefore, though the kingdom was broken up by the revolt of the ten tribes, yet the covenant which God had made in David and his successors behaved to stand, 				as is also declared by his Prophets, “Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s sake,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#034">1 Kings 11:34</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.5"></a>). The same thing is repeated a second and third time. It is also expressly said, “I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#039">1 Kings 11:39</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.6"></a>). Some time afterwards it was said, “Nevertheless, for David’s sake did the Lord his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after 				him, and to establish Jerusalem,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#004">1 Kings 15:4</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.7"></a>). And when matters were bordering on destruction, it was again said, “Yet the Lord would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s sake, as he had promised to give him alway a light, and to his children,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#019">2 Kings 8:19</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p10.8"></a>).</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p11"></a>The sum of the whole comes to this—David, all others being excluded, was chosen to be the person in whom the good pleasure of the Lord should dwell; as it is said elsewhere, “He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh;” “Moreover, he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;” “But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved;” “He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheep folds: from following the ewes great with young he 				brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#060">Ps. 78:60</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#067">67</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070">70</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#071">71</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p11.1"></a>). In fine, God, in thus preserving his Church, intended that its security and salvation should depend on Christ as its head. Accordingly, David exclaims, “The Lord is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed;” and then prays “Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance;” intimating, that the safety of the Church was indissolubly connected with the government of Christ. In the same 				sense he elsewhere says, “Save, Lord: let the king hear us when we call,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p11.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#009">Ps. 20:9</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p11.2"></a>). These words plainly teach that believers, in applying for the help of God, had their sole confidence in this—that they were under the unseen government of the King. This may be inferred from another psalm, “Save now, I beseech thee O Lord: Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p11.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025">Ps. 118:25</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026">26</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p11.3"></a>). Here it is obvious that believers are invited to Christ, in the assurance that they will be safe when 				entirely in his hand. To the same effect is another prayer, in which the whole Church implores the divine mercy “Let thy hand be upon the Man of thy right hand, upon the Son of man, whom thou madest strong (or best fitted) for thyself,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p11.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017">Ps. 80:17</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p11.4"></a>). For though the author of the psalm laments the dispersion of the whole nations he prays for its revival in him who is sole Head. After the people were led away into captivity, the land laid waste, and matters to appearance desperate, Jeremiah, 				lamenting the calamity of the Church, especially complains, that by the destruction of the kingdom the hope of believers was cut off; “The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p11.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020">Lam. 4:20</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p11.5"></a>). From all this it is abundantly plain, that as the Lord cannot be propitious to the human race without a Mediator, Christ was always held forth to the holy Fathers under the Law as the object of their 				faith.</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p12"></a>3. Moreover when comfort is promised in affliction, especially when the deliverance of the Church is described, the banner of faith and hope in Christ is unfurled. “Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed,” says Habakkuk (3:13). And whenever mention is made in the Prophets of the renovation of the Church, the people are directed to the promise made to David, that his kingdom would be for ever. And there is nothing 				strange in this, since otherwise there would have been no stability in the covenant. To this purpose is the remarkable prophecy in <a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014">Isaiah 7:14</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.1"></a>. After seeing that the unbelieving king Ahab repudiated what he had testified regarding the deliverance of Jerusalem from siege and its immediate safety, he passes as it were abruptly to the Messiah, “Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel;” intimating indirectly, that though the king and his people wickedly 				rejected the promise offered to them, as if they were bent on causing the faith of God to fail, the covenant would not be defeated—the Redeemer would come in his own time. In fine, all the prophets, to show that God was placable, were always careful to bring forward that kingdom of David, on which redemption and eternal salvation depended. Thus in Isaiah it is said, “I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have given him for a witness to the 				people,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003">Isa. 55:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004">4</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.2"></a>); intimating, that believers, in calamitous circumstances, could have no hope, had they not this testimony that God would be ready to hear them. In the same way, to revive their drooping spirits, Jeremiah says, “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005">Jer. 23:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006">6</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.3"></a>). In 				Ezekiel also it is said, “I will set up one Shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. And I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them: I the Lord have spoken it. And I will make with them a covenant of peace,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023">Ezek. 34:23</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024">24</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025">25</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.4"></a>). And again, after discoursing of this wondrous renovation, he says, “David my servant shall be king over them: and they all shall have one shepherd.” “Moreover, I 				will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024">Ezek. 37:24-26</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.5"></a>). I select a few passages out of many, because I merely wish to impress my readers with the fact, that the hope of believers was ever treasured up in Christ alone. All the other prophets concur in this. Thus Hosea, “Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011">Hosea 1:11</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.6"></a>). This he afterwards explains in clearer terms, 				“Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord their God, and David their king,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005">Hosea 3:5</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.7"></a>). Micas, also speaking of the return of the people, says expressly, “Their king shall pass before them, and the Lord on the head of them,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013">Micah 2:13</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.8"></a>). So Amos, in predicting the renovation of the people, says “In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up the ruins, and I will build it as in the days of 				old,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.9"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011">Amos 9:11</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.9"></a>); in other words, the only banner of salvation was, the exaltation of the family of David to regal splendour, as fulfilled in Christ. Hence, too, Zechariah, as nearer in time to the manifestation of Christ, speaks more plainly, “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.10"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009">Zech. 9:9</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p12.10"></a>). This corresponds to the passage already quoted from the Psalms, “The Lord is their strength, and he 				is the saving health of their anointed.” Here salvation is extended from the head to the whole body.</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p13"></a>4. By familiarising the Jews with these prophecies, God intended to teach them, that in seeking for deliverance, they should turn their eyes directly towards Christ. And though they had sadly degenerated, they never entirely lost the knowledge of this general principle, that God, by the hand of Christ, would be the deliverer of the Church, as he had promised to David; and that in this way only the free covenant by which God had adopted his chosen people would be 				fulfilled. Hence it was, that on our Saviour’s entry into Jerusalem, shortly before his death, the children shouted, “Hosannah to the son of David,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009">Mt. 21:9</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p13.1"></a>). For there seems to have been a hymn known to all, and in general use, in which they sung that the only remaining pledge which they had of the divine mercy was the promised advent of a Redeemer. For this reason, Christ tells his disciples to believe in him, in order that they might have a distinct and complete belief in God, “Ye believe 				in God, believe also in me,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p13.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#001">John 14:1</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p13.2"></a>). For although, properly speaking, faith rises from Christ to the Father, he intimates, that even when it leans on God, it gradually vanishes away, unless he himself interpose to give it solid strength. The majesty of God is too high to be scaled up to by mortals, who creep like worms on the earth. Therefore, the common saying that God is the object of faith (Lactantius, lib. 4 c. 16), requires to be received with some modification. When Christ is called 				the image of the invisible God (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p13.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col. 1:15</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p13.3"></a>), the expression is not used without cause, but is designed to remind us that we can have no knowledge of our salvation, until we behold God in Christ. For although the Jewish scribes had by their false glosses darkened what the Prophets had taught concerning the Redeemer, yet Christ assumed it to be a fact, received, as it were, with public consent, that there was no other remedy in desperate circumstances, no other mode of delivering the Church than 				the manifestation of the Mediator. It is true, that the fact adverted to by Paul was not so generally known as it ought to have been—viz. that Christ is the end of the Law (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p13.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004">Rom. 10:4</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p13.4"></a>), though this is both true, and clearly appears both from the Law and the Prophets. I am not now, however, treating of faith, as we shall elsewhere have a fitter place (Book 3 Chap. 2), but what I wish to impress upon my readers in this way is, that the first step in piety is, to acknowledge that God is a Father, 				to defend, govern, and cherish us, until he brings us to the eternal inheritance of his kingdom; that hence it is plain, as we lately observed, there is no saving knowledge of God without Christ, and that, consequently, from the beginning of the world Christ was held forth to all the elect as the object of their faith and confidence. In this sense, Irenæus says, that the Father, who is boundless in himself, is bounded in the Son, because he has accommodated himself to our capacity, lest our 				minds should be swallowed up by the immensity of his glory (Irenaeus, lib. 4 cap. 8). Fanatics, not attending to this, distort a useful sentiment into an impious dream,18 				 <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">181</font></a>
  				as if Christ had only a share of the Godhead, as a part taken from a whole; whereas the meaning merely is, that God is comprehended in Christ alone. The saying of John was always true, “whosoever denieth the Son, the same has not the Father,” (<a name="iv.ii.vii-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023">1 John 2:23</a><a name="iv.ii.vii-p14.1"></a>). For though in old time there were many who boasted that they worshipped the Supreme Deity, the Maker of heaven and earth, yet as they had no Mediator, it was impossible for them truly to enjoy the mercy of God, so as to feel 				persuaded that he was their Father. Not holding the head, that is, Christ, their knowledge of God was evanescent; and hence they at length fell away to gross and foul superstitions betraying their ignorance, just as the Turks in the present day, who, though proclaiming, with full throat, that the Creator of heaven and earth is their God, yet by their rejection of Christ, substitute an idol in his place.</p>
