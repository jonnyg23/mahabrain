 <p><a name="v.i-p5"></a><b>1.</b> <i>I am the true Vine.</i> The general meaning of this comparison is, that we are, by nature, barren and dry, except in so far as we have been engrafted into Christ, and draw from him a power which is new, and which does not proceed from ourselves. I have followed other commentators in rendering 			 <a name="v.i-p5.1"></a>ἄμπελος by <i>vitis</i>, (<i>a vine</i>,) and <a name="v.i-p5.2"></a>κλήματα by <i>palmites</i>, (<i>branches</i>.) Now, <i>vitis </i>(<i>a vine</i>) strictly denotes the plant itself, and not a field planted with <i>vines</i>,<i> 			 </i>which the Latin writers call <i>vinea</i>, (<i>a vineyard</i>;) although it is sometimes taken for <i>vinea </i>a vineyard; as, for example, when Cicero mentions in the same breath,<i> pauperum agellos et </i>vlticulas, <i>the small fields and </i>small vineyards <i>of</i> <i>the poor</i> <i> Palmites </i>(<i>branches</i>) are what may be called the 			 <i>arms </i>of the tree, which it sends out above the ground. But as the Greek word <a name="v.i-p5.3"></a>κλὢμα sometimes denotes <i>a vine</i>, and <a name="v.i-p5.4"></a>ἄμπελος,<i> a 			 vineyard</i>, I am more disposed to adopt the opinion, that Christ compares himself to a field planted with <i>vines</i>, and compares us to the plants themselves. On that point, however, I will not enter into a debate with any person; only I wish to remind the reader, that he ought to adopt that view which appears to him to derive 			 greater probability from the context.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p6"></a>First, let him remember the rule which ought to be observed in all parables; that we ought not to examine minutely every property of<i> the vine</i>, but only to take a general view of the object to which Christ applies that comparison. Now, there are three principal parts; first, that we have no 			 power of doing good but what comes from himself; secondly, that we, having a root in him, are dressed and pruned by the Father; thirdly, that he removes the unfruitful branches, that they may be thrown into the fire and burned.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p7"></a>There is scarcely any one who is ashamed to acknowledge that every thing good which he possesses comes from God; but, after making this acknowledgment, they imagine that universal grace has been given to them, as if it had been implanted in them by nature. But Christ dwells principally on this, that the vital sap — that is, all life and strength  			  <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">76</font></a>
  			 — proceeds from himself alone. Hence it follows, that the nature of man is unfruitful and destitute of everything good; because no man has the nature of a <i>vine</i>, till he be implanted in him. But this is given to the elect alone by special grace. So then, the Father is the first Author of all blessings, who plants us with his hand; but the commencement of life is in Christ, since we begin to take root in him. When he calls himself <i>the </i>true <i>vine </i>the meaning 			 is, <i>I am </i>truly <i>the</i> <i>vine</i>, and therefore men toil to no purpose in seeking strength anywhere else, for from none will useful fruit proceed but from <i>the branches </i>which shall be produced by me.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.i-p9"></a><a name="v.i-p9.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p10"></a><b>2.</b> <i>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit</i>  As some men corrupt the grace of God, others suppress it maliciously, and others choke it by carelessness, Christ intends by these words to awaken anxious inquiry, by declaring that all <i>the branches</i> which shall be unfruitful will be cut off from <i>the vine</i>  But here comes a question. Can any one who is engrafted into Christ be without fruit? I answer, many are supposed to be <i>in the vine</i>, according to the opinion of men, who actually have no root <i>in the vine</i>  Thus, in the writings of the prophets, the Lord calls the people of Israel <i>his vine</i>, because, by outward profession, they had the name of The Church.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p11"></a><i>And every branch that beareth, fruit he pruneth.</i> By these words, he shows that believers need incessant culture that they may be prevented from degenerating; and that they produce nothing good, unless God continually apply his hand; for it will not be enough to have been once made partakers of adoption, if God do not continue the work of his 			 grace in us. He speaks of pruning or <i>cleansing</i>,   			  <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">77</font></a>
  			  because our flesh abounds in superfluities and destructive vices, and is too fertile in producing them, and because they grow and multiply without end, if we are not <i>cleansed </i>or <i>pruned</i>   			  <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">78</font></a>
  			  by the hand of God. When he says that vines are <i>pruned</i>,<i> that they may yield more abundant fruit</i>, he shows what ought to be the progress of believers in the course of true religion?   			  <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">79</font></a>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.i-p15"></a><a name="v.i-p15.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p16"></a><b>3.</b> <i>You are already clean, on account of the word.</i> He reminds them that they have <i>already</i> experienced in themselves what he had said; that they have been planted in him, and have 			 also been <i>cleansed </i>or <i>pruned</i>  He points out the means of <i>pruning</i>, namely, doctrine; and there can be no doubt that he speaks of outward preaching, for he expressly <i>mentions the 			 word,</i> which they had heard from his mouth. Not that <i>the word</i> proceeding from the mouth of a man has so great efficacy, but, so far as Christ works in the heart by the Spirit, <i>the word</i> itself is the instrument of 			 <i>cleansing</i>  Yet Christ does not mean that the apostles are pure from all sin, but he holds out to them their experience, that they may learn from it that the continuance of grace is absolutely necessary. Besides, he commends to them the doctrine of the gospel from the fruit which it produces, that they may be more powerfully excited to meditate on it continually, since it resembles the 			 vine-dresser’s knife to take away what is useless.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.i-p17"></a><a name="v.i-p17.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p18"></a><b>4.</b><i> Abide in me.</i> He again exhorts them to be earnest and careful in keeping the grace which they had received, for the carelessness of the flesh can never be sufficiently aroused. And, indeed, Christ has no other object in view than to keep us</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.i-p19"></a>as a hen keepeth her chickens under her wings, <br> 			 (<a name="v.i-p19.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037">Mt 23:37</a><a name="v.i-p19.2"></a>)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p20"></a>lest our indifference should carry us away, and make us fly to our destruction. In order to prove that he did not begin the work of our salvation for the purpose of leaving it imperfect in the middle of the course, he promises that his Spirit will always be efficacious in us, if we do not prevent him. <i>Abide in me</i>, says he; 			 <i>for I am ready to abide in you</i>  And again, <i>He who abideth in me beareth much fruit.</i> By these words he declares that all who have a living root in him are fruit-bearing <i>branches</i></p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.i-p21"></a><a name="v.i-p21.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p22"></a><b>5.</b> Without me you can do nothing. This is the conclusion and application of the whole parable. So long as we are separate from him, we bear no fruit that is good and acceptable to God, for we are unable to do anything good. The Papists not only extenuate this statement, but destroy its substance, and, indeed, they altogether evade it; for, though in words they acknowledge that 			 we can do nothing without Christ, yet they foolishly imagine that they possess some power, which is not sufficient in itself, but, being aided by the grace of God, co-operates (as they say,) that is, works along with it;   			  <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">80</font></a>
  			  for they cannot endure that man should be so much annihilated as to do nothing of himself. But these words of Christ are too plain to be evaded so easily as they suppose. The doctrine invented by the Papists is, that we can do nothing without Christ, but that, aided by him, we have something of ourselves in addition to his grace. But Christ, on the other hand, declares that we can do nothing of ourselves. The branch, he says, beareth not fruit of itself; and, 			 therefore, he not only extols the aid of his co-operating grace, but deprives us entirely of all power but what he imparts to us. Accordingly, this phrase, <i>without me,</i> must be explained as meaning, except from me.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p24"></a>Next follows another sophism; for they allege that <i>the branch</i> has something from nature, for if another branch, which is not fruit-bearing, be engrafted in the vine, it will produce nothing. But this is easily answered; for Christ does not explain what the branch has naturally, before it become united to the vine, but rather means that we begin to become branches at the time when we are united to him. And, indeed, Scripture elsewhere 			 shows that, before we are in him, we are dry and useless wood.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.i-p25"></a><a name="v.i-p25.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p26"></a><b>6.</b> <i>If any one abide not in me.</i> He again lays before them the punishment of ingratitude, and, by doing so, excites and urges them to perseverance. It is indeed the gift of God, but the exhortation to fear is not uncalled for, lest our flesh, through too great indulgence, should root us out.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p27"></a><i>He is cast out, and withered, like a branch.</i> Those who are cut off from Christ are said to <i>wither</i> like a dead branch; because, as the commencement of strength is from him, so also is its uninterrupted continuance. Not that it ever happens that any one of the elect is dried up, but because there are many hypocrites who, in outward appearance, flourish and are green for a time, but who afterwards, when they ought to yield fruit, show the very opposite of that which the Lord expects and demands from his people.   			  <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">81</font></a>

 <p><a name="v.ii-p6"></a><b>7.</b><i> If you abide in me.</i> Believers often feel that they are starved, and are very far from that rich fatness which is necessary for yielding abundant fruit. For this reason it is expressly added, whatever those who are in Christ may need, there is a remedy provided for their poverty, as soon as they ask it from God. This is a very useful 			 admonition; for the Lord often suffers us to hunger, in order to train us to earnestness in prayer. But if we fly to him, we shall never want what we ask, but, out of his inexhaustible abundance, he will supply us with every thing that we need, (<a name="v.ii-p6.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#005">1Co 1:5</a><a name="v.ii-p6.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p7"></a><i>If my words abide in you.</i> He means that we take root in him by faith; for as soon as we have departed from the doctrine of the Gospel, we seek Christ separately from himself. When he promises that he will grant whatever we wish, he does not give us leave to form wishes according to our own 			 fancy. God would do what was ill fitted to promote our welfare, if he were so indulgent and so ready to yield to us; for we know well that men often indulge in foolish and extravagant desires. But here he limits the wishes of his people to the rule of praying in a right manner, and that rule subjects, to the good pleasure of God, all our affections. This is confirmed by the connection in which the words stand; for he means that his people <i>will </i>or <i>desire </i>not riches, or honors, or any thing of that nature, which the flesh foolishly desires, but the vital sap of the Holy Spirit, Which enables them to bear fruit.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.ii-p8"></a><a name="v.ii-p8.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p9"></a><b>8.</b> <i>In this my Father is glorified</i> This is a confirmation of the former statement; for he shows that we ought not to doubt that God will listen to the prayers of his people, when they desire to be rendered fruitful; for this contributes very greatly to his glory. But by this end or effect he 			 likewise kindles in them the desire of doing good; for there is nothing which we ought to value more highly than that the name of God may be glorified by us. To the same effect is the latter clause, <i>that you may become my disciples;</i> for he declares that he has no one in his flock who does not <i>bear fruit</i> to the <i>glory </i>of God.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.ii-p10"></a><a name="v.ii-p10.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p11"></a><b>9.</b><i> As the Father hath loved me.</i> He intended to express something far greater than is commonly supposed; for they who think that he now speaks of the sacred <i>love </i>of God the Father, which he always had towards the Son, philosophize away from the subject; for it was 			 rather the design of Christ to lay, as it were, in our bosom a sure pledge of God’s <i>love </i>towards us. That abstruse inquiry, as to the manner in which the Father always <i>loved </i>himself in the Son, has nothing to do with the present passage. But the<i> love</i> which is here mentioned must be 			 understood as referring to us, because Christ testifies that <i>the Father loves </i>him, as he is the Head of the Church. And this is highly necessary for us; for he who without a Mediator, inquires how he is <i>loved</i> by God, involves him in a labyrinth, in which he will neither discover the entrance, nor the means of extricating himself. We 			 ought therefore to cast our eyes on Christ, in whom will be found the testimony and pledge of the love of God; for the love of God was fully poured out on him, that from him it might flow to his members. He is distinguished by this title, that he is <i>the beloved Son</i>, in whom the will of the Father is satisfied, (<a name="v.ii-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017">Mt 3:17</a><a name="v.ii-p11.1"></a>.) But we ought to observe the end, which is, that God may accept us in him. So, then, we may contemplate in him, as in a mirror, God’s paternal love towards us all; because he is not <i>loved </i>apart, or for his own private advantage, but that he may unite us with him to the Father.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p12"></a><i>Abide in my love.</i> Some explain this to mean, that Christ demands from his disciples mutual <i>love;</i> but others explain it better, who understand it to mean the <i>love</i> of Christ towards us. He means that we should continually enjoy that love with which he once loved us, and, therefore, that we ought to take care not to deprive ourselves of it; for many reject the grace which is offered to them, and many throw away what they once had in their hands. So, then, since we have been once received into the grace of Christ, we must see that we do not fall from it through our own 			 fault.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p13"></a>The conclusion which some draw from these words, that there is no efficacy in the grace of God. unless it be aided by our steadfastness, is frivolous. For I do not admit that the Spirit demands from us no more than what is in our own power, but he shows us what we ought to do, that, if our strength be deficient, we may seek it from some other quarter. In like manner, when Christ exhorts us, in this passage, to perseverance, we must; not rely on 			 our own strength and industry, but we ought to pray to him who commands us, that he would confirm us in his love.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.ii-p14"></a><a name="v.ii-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p15"></a><b>10.</b> <i>If you keep my commandments.</i> He points out to us the method of perseverance. his, to follow where he calls, for, as Paul says,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.ii-p16"></a>They who are in Christ walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit, <br> 			 (<a name="v.ii-p16.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001">Ro 8:1</a><a name="v.ii-p16.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p17"></a>For these two things are continually united, that faith which perceives the undeserved love of Christ toward us, and a good conscience and newness of life. And, indeed, Christ does not reconcile believers to the Father, that they may indulge in wickedness without reserve, and without punishment; but that, governing them by his Spirit, he may keep them under the authority and dominion of his Father. Hence it follows, that the love of Christ is 			 rejected by those who do not prove, by true obedience, that they are his disciples.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p18"></a>If any one object that, in that case, the security of our salvation depends on ourselves, I reply, it is wrong to give such a meaning to Christ’s words; for the obedience which believers render to him is not the cause why he continues his love toward us, but is rather the effect of his love. For whence comes it that they answer to their calling, but because they are led by the Spirit of adoption of free grace?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p19"></a>But again, it may be thought that the condition imposed on us is too difficult, that we should <i>keep the commandments </i>of Christ, which contain the absolute perfection of righteousness, — a perfection which far exceeds our capacity, — for hence it follows, that the love of Christ will be useless, if we be not endued with angelical purity. The answer is easy; for when Christ speaks of the desire of living a good and holy life, he does not 			 exclude what is the chief article in his doctrine, namely, that which alludes to righteousness being freely imputed, in consequence of which, through a free pardon, our duties are acceptable to God, which in themselves deserved to be rejected as imperfect and unholy. Believers, therefore, are reckoned as <i>keeping</i> <i>the commandments </i>of Christ when they apply their earnest attention to them, though they be far distant from the object at which they aim; for they are delivered from that 			 rigorous sentence of the law,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.ii-p20"></a>Cursed be he that hath not confirmed all the words of this law to do them, <br> 			 (<a name="v.ii-p20.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026">De 27:26</a><a name="v.ii-p20.2"></a>).</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p21"></a><i>As I also have kept my Father’s commandments.</i> As we have been elected in Christ, so in him the image of our calling is exhibited to us in a lively manner; and therefore he justly holds himself out to us as a pattern, to the imitation of which all the godly ought to be conformed. “In me,” 			 says he, “is brightly displayed the resemblance of those things which I demand from you; for you see how sincerely I am devoted to obedience to <i>my Father</i>, and how I persevere in this course. <i>My Father</i>, too, hath loved me, not for a moment, or for a short time, but his love toward me is constant.” This conformity between the Head and the members ought to be always placed before our eyes, not only that believers may form themselves after the example of Christ, but that, they may entertain a confident hope that his Spirit will every day form them anew to be better and better, that they may walk to the end in newness of life.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.ii-p22"></a><a name="v.ii-p22.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p23"></a><b>11.</b> <i>These things I have spoken to you.</i> He adds, that his love is far from being unknown to the godly, but that it is perceived by faith, so that they enjoy blessed peace of conscience; for the <i>joy </i>which 			 he mentions springs from that peace with God which is possessed by all that have been justified by free grace. As often, then, as God’s fatherly love towards us is preached, let us know that there is given to us ground for true <i>joy</i>, that, with peaceable consciences, we may be certain of our salvation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p24"></a><i>My joy and your joy.</i> It is called <i>Christ</i>’<i>s joy </i>and <i>our joy </i>in various respects. It is <i>Christ</i>’<i>s</i>, because it is given to us by him; for he is both the Author and the Cause of it. I say that he is the <i>Cause </i>of it, because we were freed from guilt, when</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.ii-p25"></a>the chastisement of our peace was laid on him, (<a name="v.ii-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005">Isa 53:5</a><a name="v.ii-p25.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p26"></a>I call him also the Author of it, because by his Spirit he drives away dread and anxiety in our hearts, and then arises that calm cheerfulness. It is said to be <i>ours </i>for a different reason; because we enjoy it since it has been given to us. Now since Christ declares that <i>he spake these things</i>,<i> that the disciples might have joy</i>, we conclude from these words, that all who have duly profited by this sermon have 			 something on which they can rest.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p27"></a><i>That my joy may abide in you.</i> By the word <i>abide </i>he means, that it is not a fleeting or temporary<i> joy </i>of which he speaks, but a<i> joy </i>which never fails or passes away. Let us therefore learn 			 that we ought to seek in the doctrine of Christ the assurance of salvation, which retains its vigor both in life and in death.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p28"></a><i>That your joy may be full.</i> He adds, that this <i>joy </i>will be solid and<i> full; </i>not that believers will be entirely free from all sadness, but that the ground for<i> joy </i>will be far greater, so that 			 no dread, no anxiety, no grief, will swallow them up; for those to whom it has been given to glory in Christ will not be prevented, either by life, or by death, or by any distresses, from bidding defiance to sadness.</p>  <a name="v.iii"></a>

True, the love and reverence for God comes first in order, but as the true proof of it is <i>love</i> toward our neighbors, he dwells chiefly on this point. Besides, as he formerly held himself out for a pattern in maintaining the general doctrine, so he now holds himself out for a pattern in a particular instance; for he loved all his people, that they may love each other. Of the reason why he lays down no express rule, in this passage, about loving unbelievers, we have spoken under the former 			 chapter.</p>

 <p><a name="v.iii-p8"></a><b>13.</b> <i>Greater love hath no one than this.</i> Christ sometimes proclaims the greatness of his love to us, that he may more fully confirm our confidence in our salvation; but now he proceeds further, in order to inflame us, by his example, to love the brethren. Yet he joins both together; for he 			 means that we should taste by faith how inestimably delightful his goodness is, and next he allures us, in this way, to cultivate brotherly love. Thus Paul writes:</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.iii-p9"></a>Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and sacrifice to God of a sweet-smelling savor, (<a name="v.iii-p9.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002">Eph 5:2</a><a name="v.iii-p9.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iii-p10"></a>God might have redeemed us by a single word, or by a mere act of his will, if he had not thought it better to do otherwise for our own benefit, that, by not sparing his own well-beloved Son, he might testify in his person how much he cares for our salvation. But now our hearts, if they are not softened by the inestimable sweetness of Divine love, must be harder than stone or iron.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iii-p11"></a>But a question is put. How did Christ die for friends, since</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.iii-p12"></a>we were enemies, before he reconciled us, (<a name="v.iii-p12.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010">Ro 5:10</a><a name="v.iii-p12.1"></a>;)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iii-p13"></a>for, by expiating our sins through the sacrifice of his death, he destroyed the enmity that was between God and us? The answer to this question will be found under the third chapter, where we said that, in reference to us, there is a state of variance between us and God, till our sins are blotted out by the death of Christ; but that the cause of this grace, which has been manifested in Christ, was the  			  <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">84</font></a>
  			 In this way, too, Christ laid down his life for those who were strangers, but whom, even while they were strangers, he loved, otherwise he would not have died for them.</p>

 <p><a name="v.iii-p21"></a><b>15.</b> <i>Henceforth I will not call you servants.</i> By another argument he shows his love toward the disciples, which was, that he opened his mind fully to them, as familiar communication is maintained among <i>friends. </i>“I have condescended,” he 			 says, “far more to you than a mortal man is wont to condescend to his <i>servants</i>  Let this be regarded by you, therefore, as a pledge of my love toward you, that I have, in a kind and friendly manner, explained to you the secrets of heavenly wisdom which I had heard from the Father.” It is indeed a noble commendation of the Gospel, that we have the heart of Christ opened (so to speak) in it, so 			 that we can no longer doubt of it or perceive it slightly. We have no reason for desiring to rise above the clouds, or to penetrate into the deep, (<a name="v.iii-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006">Rom. 10:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#007">7</a><a name="v.iii-p21.1"></a>) to obtain the certainty of our salvation. Let us be satisfied with this testimony of his love toward us which is contained in the Gospel, for it will never deceive us. Moses said to the ancient 			 people,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.iii-p22"></a>What nation under heaven is so highly favored as to have God near to them, as God talked, with you this day? <br> 			 (<a name="v.iii-p22.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007">De 4:7</a><a name="v.iii-p22.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iii-p23"></a>But far higher is the distinction which God hath conferred on us, since God hath entirely conveyed himself to us in his Son. So much the greater is the ingratitude and wickedness of those who, not satisfied with the admirable wisdom of the Gospel, fly with proud eagerness to new speculations.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iii-p24"></a><i>All that I have heard from my Father.</i> It is certain that the disciples did not know all that Christ knew, and indeed it was impossible that they should attain to so great a height; and because the wisdom of God is incomprehensible, he distributed to each of them a certain measure of knowledge, according as he judged to be necessary. Why 			 then does he say that he revealed <i>all things</i>? I answer, this is limited to the person and office of the Mediator. He places himself between God and us, having received out of the secret sanctuary of God those things which he should deliver to us — as the phrase is — from hand to hand. Not one of those things, therefore, which related to our salvation, and 			 which it was of importance for us to know was omitted by Christ in the instructions given to his disciples. Thus, so far as he was appointed to be the Master and Teacher of the Church, he heard nothing from the Father which he did not faithfully teach his disciples. Let us only have an humble desire and readiness to learn, and we shall feel that Paul has justly called the Gospel <i>wisdom to make men perfect</i>, (<a name="v.iii-p24.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028">Col 1:28</a><a name="v.iii-p24.1"></a>.)</p>  <a name="v.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="v.iv-p5"></a><b>16.</b> <i>You have not chosen me.</i> He declares still more clearly that it must not be ascribed to their own merit, but to his grace, that they have arrived at so great an honor; for when he says that <i>he was not chosen by them</i>, it is as if he had said, that whatever they have they did not obtain by their own skill or industry. Men commonly imagine some kind of concurrence to take place between the grace of God and the will of man; but that contrast, <i>I chose you</i>,<i> I was not chosen by you</i>, claims, exclusively, for Christ alone what is usually divided between Christ and man; as if he had said, that a man is not moved of his own accord to seek Christ, until he has been sought by him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p6"></a>True, the subject now in hand is not the ordinary <i>election </i>of believers, by which they are adopted to be the children of God, but that special <i>election</i>, by which he set apart his disciples to the office of preaching the Gospel. But if it was by free gift, and not by their own 			 merit, that they were <i>chosen </i>to the apostolic office, much more is it certain that the <i>election</i>, by which, from being the children of wrath and an accursed seed, we become the children of God, is of free grace. Besides, in this passage Christ magnifies his grace, by which they had been <i>chosen</i> to be Apostles, so as to join with it that former election by which they had been engrafted into the body of the Church; or rather, he includes in these words all the dignity and honor which he had conferred on them. Yet I acknowledge that Christ treats expressly of the apostleship; for his design is, to excite the disciples to execute their office diligently and faithfully.   			  <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">85</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p8"></a>He takes, as the ground of his exhortation, the undeserved favor which he had bestowed on them; for the greater our obligations to the Lord, the more earnest ought we to be in performing the duties which he demands from us; otherwise it will be impossible for us to avoid the charge of base ingratitude. Hence it appears that there is nothing which ought more powerfully to kindle in us the desire of a holy and religious life, than when we 			 acknowledge that we owe every thing to God, and that we have nothing that is our own; that both the commencement of our salvation, and all the parts which follow from it, flow from his undeserved mercy. Besides, how true this statement of Christ is, may be clearly perceived from the fact, that Christ <i>chose </i>to be his apostles those who might have been thought to be the most unfit of all for the office; though in their person he intended to preserve an enduring monument of his grace. For, 			 as Paul says, (<a name="v.iv-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016">1Co 2:16</a><a name="v.iv-p8.1"></a>,) who among men shall be found fit for discharging the embassy by which God reconciles mankind to himself? Or rather, what mortal is able to represent the person of God? It is Christ alone who makes them fit by his election. Thus Paul ascribes his <i>apostleship </i>to <i>grace</i>, (<a name="v.iv-p8.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005">Ro 1:5</a><a name="v.iv-p8.2"></a>,) and again mentions that</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.iv-p9"></a>he had been separated from his mother’s womb, <br> 			 (<a name="v.iv-p9.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015">Ga 1:15</a><a name="v.iv-p9.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p10"></a>Nay more, since we are altogether useless servants, those who appear to be the most excellent of all will not be fit for the smallest calling, till they have been <i>chosen</i>. Yet the higher the degree of honor to which any one has been raised, let him remember that he is under the deeper obligations to God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p11"></a><i>And I have appointed you.</i> The election is hidden till it is actually made known, when a man receives an office to which he had been appointed; as Paul, in the passage which I quoted a little ago, where he says that <i>he had been separated from his mother</i>’<i>s womb</i>, adds, that he was created an apostle, because <i>it so pleased God</i>  His words are:</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.iv-p12"></a>When it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace, <br> 			 (<a name="v.iv-p12.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015">Ga 1:15</a><a name="v.iv-p12.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p13"></a>Thus also the Lord testifies that he <i>knew </i>Jeremiah <i>before he was in his mother</i>’<i>s womb</i>, (<a name="v.iv-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#005">Jer 1:5</a><a name="v.iv-p13.1"></a>,) though he calls him to the prophetical office at the proper and appointed time. It may happen, no doubt, that one who is duly qualified enters into the office of teaching; or rather, it usually happens in the Church that no one is 			 called till he be endued and furnished with the necessary qualifications. That Christ declares himself to be the Author of both is not wonderful; since it is only by him that God acts, and he acts along with the Father. So then, both election and ordination belong equally to both.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p14"></a><i>That you may go.</i> He now points out the reason why he mentioned his grace. It was, to make them apply more earnestly to the work. The apostleship was not a place of honor without toil, but they had to contend with very great difficulties; and therefore Christ encourages them not to shrink 			 from labors, and annoyances, and dangers. This argument is drawn from the end which they ought to have in view; but Christ reasons from the effect, when he says,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p15"></a><i>That you may bear fruit;</i> for it is hardly possible that any one would devote himself earnestly and diligently to the work, if he did not expect that the labor would bring some advantage. Christ, therefore, declares that their efforts will not be useless or unsuccessful, provided that they are ready to obey and follow when he calls 			 them.   			  <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">86</font></a>
  			  For he not only enjoins on the apostles what their calling involves and demands, but promises to them also prosperity and success, that they may not be cold or indifferent. It is hardly possible to tell how great is the value of this consolation against those numerous temptations which daily befall the ministers of Christ. Whenever, then, we see that we are losing our pains, let us call to remembrance that Christ will, at length, prevent our exertions from being 			 vain or unproductive; for the chief accomplishment of this promise is at the very time when there is no appearance of <i>fruit. </i>Scorners, and those whom the world looks upon as wise men, ridicule our attempts as foolish, and tell us that it is in vain for us to attempt to mingle heaven and earth; because the <i>fruit </i>does not yet correspond to our wishes. But since Christ, on the contrary, has promised 			 that the happy result, though concealed for a time, will follow, let us labor diligently in the discharge of our duty amidst the mockeries of the world.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p17"></a><i>And that your fruit may abide.</i> A question now arises, why does Christ say that this <i>fruit </i>will be perpetual? As the doctrine of the Gospel obtains souls to Christ for eternal salvation, many think that this is the perpetuity of <i>the fruit</i>  But I extend the statement much farther, as meaning that the Church will last to the very end of the world; for the labor of the apostles yields <i>fruit </i>even in the present day, and our preaching is not for a single age only, but will enlarge the Church, so that new <i>fruit </i>will be seen to spring up after our death.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p18"></a>When he says, <i>your fruit</i>, he speaks as if it had been obtained by their own industry, though Paul teaches that <i>they who plant or water are nothing</i>, (<a name="v.iv-p18.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007">1Co 3:7</a><a name="v.iv-p18.1"></a>.) And, indeed, the formation of the Church is so excellent a work of God, that the glory of it ought not to be ascribed to men. But as the Lord displays his power by the agency of men, that they may not labor in vain, he is wont to transfer to them even that which belongs peculiarly to himself. Yet let us remember that, when he so graciously commends his disciples, it is to encourage, and not to puff 			 them up.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p19"></a><i>That your Father may give you all that you ask in my name.</i> This clause was not added abruptly, as many might suppose; for, since the office of teaching far exceeds the power of men, there are added to it innumerable attacks of Satan, which never could be warded off but by the power of God. That the apostles may not be discouraged, Christ 			 meets them with the most valuable aid; as if he had said, “If the work assigned to you be so great that you are unable to fulfill the duties of your office, my Father will not forsake you; for I have appointed you to be ministers of the Gospel on this condition, that my Father will have his hand stretched out to assist you, whenever you pray to him, <i>in my name</i>, to grant you assistance.” And, indeed, that the greater part of teachers either languish through indolence, or utterly give way through despair, arises from nothing else than that they are sluggish in the duty of prayer.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p20"></a>This promise of Christ, therefore, arouses us to call upon God; for whoever acknowledges that the success of his work depends on God alone, will offer his labor to him with fear and trembling. On the other hand, if any one, relying on his own industry, disregard the assistance of God, he will either throw away his spear and shield, when he comes to the trial, or he will be busily employed, but without any advantage. Now, we must here guard 			 against two faults, pride and distrust; for, as the assistance of God is fearlessly disregarded by those who think that the matter is already in their own power, so many yield to difficulties, because they do not consider that they fight through the power and protection of God, under whose banner they go forth to war.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.iv-p21"></a><a name="v.iv-p21.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p22"></a><b>17.</b> <i>These things I command you.</i> This too, was appropriately added, that the Apostles might know that mutual love among ministers is demanded above all things, that they may be employed, with one accord, in building up the Church of God; for there is no greater hindrance than when every one 			 labors apart, and when all do not direct their exertions to the common good. If, then, ministers do not maintain brotherly intercourse with each other, they may possibly erect some large heaps, but latterly disjointed and confused; and, all the while, there will be no building of a Church.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.iv-p23"></a><a name="v.iv-p23.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p24"></a><b>18. </b><i>If the world hate you.</i> After having armed the Apostles for the battle, Christ exhorts them likewise to patience; for the Gospel cannot be published without instantly driving the world to rage. Consequently, it will never be possible for godly teachers to avoid the hatred of the world. Christ gives them early 			 information of this, that they may not be instances of what usually happens to raw recruits, who, from wont of experience, are valiant before they have seen their enemies, but who tremble as soon as the battle is commenced. And not only does Christ forewarn his disciples, that nothing may happen to them which is new and unexpected, but likewise confirms them by his example; for it is not reasonable that Christ should be <i>hated by the world</i>, and that we, who represent his person, should have the world on our side, which is always like itself.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p25"></a><i>You know.</i> I have translated the verb <a name="v.iv-p25.1"></a>γινώσκετε in the indicative mood, <i>you know</i>; but if any one prefer to translate it in the imperative mood, 			 <i>know ye</i>, I have no objection, for it makes no change in the meaning. There is greater difficulty in the phrase which immediately follows, <a name="v.iv-p25.2"></a>πρῶτον ὑμῶν, <i>before you</i>; for when he says that he is <i>before </i>the disciples, this may be referred either to <i>time </i>or to<i> rank</i>  The former exposition has been more generally received, namely, that Christ <i>was hated by the world </i>before the Apostles were <i>hated</i>  But I prefer the second exposition, namely, that Christ, who is far exalted above them, was not exempted from the hatred of the world, and therefore his ministers ought not to refuse the same condition; for the phraseology is the same as that which we have seen twice before, in <a name="v.iv-p25.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#027">Joh 1:27</a><a name="v.iv-p25.3"></a> and 30, <i>He who 			 cometh after me is preferred to me</i>, (<a name="v.iv-p25.4"></a>ὅτι πρῶτός μου ἦν,)<i> for he was before me</i></p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.iv-p26"></a><a name="v.iv-p26.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p27"></a><b>19. </b><i>If you were of the world.</i> This is another consolation, that the reason why they are <i>hated by the world </i>is, that they have been separated from it. Now, this is their true happiness and glory, for in this manner they have been rescued from destruction.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p28"></a><i>But I have chosen you out of the world. To choose </i>means here <i>to separate</i>  Now, if they were <i>chosen out of the world</i>,<i> 			 </i>it follows that they were a part <i>of the world</i>, and that it is only by the mercy of God that they are distinguished from the rest who perish. Again, by the term, <i>the world</i>, Christ describes, in this passage, all who have not been 			 regenerated by the Spirit of God; for he contrasts the Church with <i>the world</i>, as we shall see more fully under the seventeenth chapter. And yet this doctrine does not contradict the exhortation of Paul,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.iv-p29"></a>Be at peace with all men, as far as lieth in you, <br> 			 (<a name="v.iv-p29.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#018">Ro 12:18</a><a name="v.iv-p29.2"></a>;)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p30"></a>for the exception which he adds amounts to saying, that we ought to see what is right and proper for us to do that no man, by seeking to please <i>the world</i>, may give himself up to its corruptions.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p31"></a>But there is still another objection that may be urged; for we see that it commonly happens that wicked men, who are <i>of the world</i>, are not only <i>hated</i>, but accursed by others. In this respect, 			 certainly, <i>the world loveth</i> not <i>what is its own</i>. I reply, earthly men, who are regulated by the perception of their flesh, never have a true hatred of sin, but only so far as they are affected by the consideration of their own convenience or 			 injury. And yet the intention of Christ was not to deny that <i>the world </i>foams and rages within itself by internal quarrels. He only intended to show, <i>that the world hates</i> nothing in believers but what is of God. And hence, too, it plainly appears how foolish are the dreams of the Anabaptists, who conclude, from this single argument 			 that they are the servants of God, because they displease the greater part of men. For it is easy to reply, that many who are <i>of the world </i>favor their doctrine, because they are delighted at the thought of having every thing in shameful confusion; while many who are <i>out of the world </i>hate it, because they are desirous that the good order of the state should remain unbroken.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.iv-p32"></a><a name="v.iv-p32.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p33"></a><b>20. </b><i>Remember the word.</i> It might also be read in the indicative mood, <i>You remember the word</i>, and the meaning is not very different; but I think that it is more suitable to read it in the imperative mood, <i>Remember the word. </i>It is a confirmation of what Christ had spoken immediately before, when he said that he was hated by the world, though he was far more excellent than his disciples; for it is unreasonable that the condition of <i>the servant </i>should be better than that of <i>his master</i>  Having spoken of persons, he 			 likewise makes mention of doctrine.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iv-p34"></a><i>If they have heard my word, they will keep yours also.</i> Nothing gives greater uneasiness to the godly than when they see the doctrine, which is of God, haughtily despised by men; for it is truly shocking and dreadful, and the sight of it might shake the stoutest heart. But when we remember on the other hand, that not less obstinate 			 resistance was manifested against the Son of God himself, we need not wonder that the doctrine of God is so little reverenced among men. When he calls it <i>his doctrine </i>and <i>their doctrine</i>, this refers to the ministry. Christ is the only Teacher of the Church; but he intended that <i>his doctrine</i>, of which he had been the first Teacher, should be afterwards preached by the apostles.</p>

 <p><a name="v.iv-p36"></a><b>21.</b> <i>But all these things they will do to you.</i> As the fury of the world is monstrous, when it is so enraged against the doctrine of its own salvation, Christ assigns the reason to be, that it is hurried on by blind ignorance to its own destruction; for no man would deliberately engage in 			 battle against God. It is blindness and ignorance of God, therefore, that hurries on the world, so that it does not hesitate to make war with Christ. We ought, then, always to observe the cause of this conduct, and the true consolation consists in nothing else than the testimony of a good conscience. It should also excite gratitude in our minds, that, while the world perishes in its blindness, God hath given to us his light. Yet let it be understood that hatred of Christ arises from stupidity 			 of mind, when God is not known; for, as I have often said, unbelief is blind; not that wicked men do not understand or know anything, but because all the knowledge that they have is confused, and quickly vanishes away. On this subject I have elsewhere treated more largely.</p>  <a name="v.v"></a>

 <p><a name="v.v-p5"></a><b>22.</b> <i>If I had not come.</i> He had said that the Jews regarded the Gospel with hatred, because they did not know God. Lest any one should think that this tended to alleviate their guilt, he adds, that it is through malice that they are blind, just as if one were to shut his eyes, that he might not 			 be compelled to see the light. For otherwise it might have been brought as an objection against Christ. “If they do not know thy Father, how comes it that thou dost not cure their ignorance? Why didst thou not at least make trial whether they were altogether incapable of being taught, or not?” He replies, that he has performed the duty of a good and faithful Teacher, but without success, because their malice would not suffer them to acquire soundness of mind. In the person of those men he 			 intended to strike terror into all who reject the truth of God, when it is offered to them, or intentionally fight against it, when it is known. And though a dreadful vengeance awaits them, still Christ, in this passage, looks chiefly to his own disciples, to animate them by the confident and well-grounded expectation of victory, lest, at any time, they should yield to the malice of wicked men; for when we learn that such will be the issue, we may already triumph, as if we were in the midst of 			 the battle.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p6"></a><i>They would not have sin.</i> It may be thought that Christ intended by these words to say, that there is no other sin but unbelief; and there are some who think so. Augustine speaks more soberly, but he approaches to that opinion; for, since faith forgives and blots out all sins, he says, that the only sin that damns a man is unbelief. This is 			 true, for unbelief not only hinders men from being delivered from the condemnation of death, but is the source and cause of all evils. But the whole of that reasoning is inapplicable to the present passage; for the word<i> sin </i>is not taken in a general sense, but as related to the subject which is now under consideration; as if Christ had said, that their ignorance is utterly inexcusable, because in his person they maliciously rejected God; just as 			 if we were to pronounce a person to be innocent, just, and pure, when we wished merely to acquit him of a single crime of which he had been accused. Christ’s acquittal of them, therefore, is confined to one kind of <i>sin</i>, because it takes away from the Jews every pretense of ignorance in this <i>sin</i>,   			  <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">87</font></a>
  			  of despising and hating the Gospel.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p8"></a>But there is still another question that arises: “Was not unbelief sufficient to condemn men before the coming of Christ?” There are fanatics who reason inconclusively from this passage, that all who died before the coming of Christ died without faith, and remained in a state of doubt and suspense till Christ manifested himself to them; as if there were not many passages of Scripture which testify that their conscience alone was sufficient to 			 condemn them. <i>Death</i>, says Paul, <i>reigned in the world even to Moses</i>, (<a name="v.v-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014">Ro 5:14</a><a name="v.v-p8.1"></a>.) And again he declares, that</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.v-p9"></a>they who have sinned without law shall perish without law, <br> 			 (<a name="v.v-p9.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012">Ro 2:12</a><a name="v.v-p9.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p10"></a>What, then, does Christ mean? There is undoubtedly an admission made in these words, by which he means that the Jews have nothing more to offer in extenuation of their guilt, since they knowingly and willfully rejected the life which was offered to them. Thus the excuse which he makes for them does not free them from all blame, but only extenuates the heinousness of their crime, according to that saying, <i>The</i> <i>servant</i>,<i> who knoweth the will of his master</i>,<i> and despiseth it</i>,<i> shall be severely 			 punished</i>?   			  <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">88</font></a>
  			  For it was not the intention of Christ here to promise pardon to any, but to hold his enemies convicted, who had obstinately rejected the grace of God, that it might be fully evident that they were unworthy of all pardon and mercy.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p14"></a><i>If I had not come and SPOKEN TO THEM.</i> It ought to be observed, that he does not speak of his coming, as viewed by itself, but as connected with his doctrine, for they would not have been held guilty of so great a crime on account of his bodily presence alone, but the contempt of the doctrine made them utterly inexcusable.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.v-p15"></a><a name="v.v-p15.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p16"></a><b>23.</b><i> He who hateth me hateth my Father also.</i> This is a remarkable passage, which teaches us that no man can hate the doctrine of the Gospel without manifesting his impiety against God. There are many, indeed, who profess differently in words; for, though they abhor the Gospel, still they wish to be thought very good 			 servants of God; but it is false, for a contempt of God is concealed within. In this manner Christ discovers the hypocrisy of many by the light of his doctrine; and on this subject we have spoken more largely under that passage,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.v-p17"></a>Whosoever doeth what is evil hateth the light   			  <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">89</font></a>

 <p><a name="v.v-p19"></a>and under that passage,</p>

 <p><a name="v.v-p23"></a><b>24. </b><i>If I had not done among them the works</i>  Under the word <i>works </i>he includes, in my opinion, all the proofs which he gave of his Divine glory; for by miracles, and by the power of the Holy Spirit, and by other demonstrations, he clearly proved 			 that he was the Son of God, so that in him was plainly seen the majesty <i>of the Only-begotten Son</i>, as we have seen under <a name="v.v-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</a><a name="v.v-p23.1"></a>    			  <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">91</font></a>
  			  It is commonly objected, that he did not perform more miracles or greater miracles than Moses and the Prophets. The answer is well known, that Christ is more eminent in miracles in this respect, that he was not merely a minister, like the rest, but was strictly the Author of them; for he employed his own name, his own authority, and his own power, in performing miracles. But, as I have said, he includes in general 			 all the testimonies of heavenly and spiritual power by which his Divinity was displayed.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p25"></a><i>They have seen and hated. </i>He concludes that his enemies cannot escape by any shifts to which they may have recourse, since they despised his power, which evidently was altogether Divine; for God had openly manifested his Divinity in the Son; and therefore it would serve no purpose for them to say that they had only 			 to do with a mortal man. This passage reminds us to consider attentively the works of God, in which, by displaying his power, he wishes us to render the honor which is due to him. Hence it follows, that all who obscure the gifts of God, or who contemptuously overlook them, are ungrateful to God, and malicious.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.v-p26"></a><a name="v.v-p26.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p27"></a><b>25.</b> <i>But that the word may be fulfilled.</i> What is contrary to nature appears to be incredible. But nothing is more contrary to reason than to hate God; and, therefore, Christ says that so great was the malice with which their minds were envenomed, that <i>they hated him 			 without a cause</i>  Christ quotes a passage from <a name="v.v-p27.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019">Ps 35:19</a><a name="v.v-p27.1"></a>, which, he says, is now <i>fulfilled</i>  Not that the same thing did not happen, formerly, to David, but to reprove the obstinate malice of the nation, which reigned 			 perpetually from age to age, being continued from grandfathers to grandchildren in unbroken succession; as if he had said, that they were in no respect better than their fathers, who <i>hated </i>David <i>without a cause.</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p28"></a><i>Which is written in their Law.</i> By the word <i>Law, </i>he means the Psalms; for the whole doctrine of the Prophets was nothing else than an appendage to <i>the Law</i>; and we know that the ministry of Moses 			 lasted till the time of Christ. He calls it their <i>Law</i>, not as an expression of respect for them, but to wound them more deeply by a designation which was well known among them; as if he had said, “They have <i>a Law </i>transmitted to them by hereditary right, in which they see their morals painted to the 			 life.”</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.v-p29"></a><a name="v.v-p29.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p30"></a><b>26. </b><i>But when the Comforter is come.</i> After having explained to the apostles that the Gospel ought not to be less highly valued by them, because it has many adversaries, even within the Church itself; Christ now, in opposition to the wicked fury of those men, produces the testimony of the Spirit, and if their 			 consciences rest on this testimony, they will never be shaken; as if he had said, “True, the world will rage against you; some will mock, and others will curse your doctrine; but none of their attacks will be so violent as to shake the firmness of your faith, when <i>the Holy Spirit </i>shall have been given to you to establish you by his testimony.” And, indeed, when the world rages on all sides, our 			 only protection is, that the truth of God, scaled by the Holy Spirit on our hearts, despises and defies all that is in the world; for, if it were subject to the opinions of men, our faith would be overwhelmed a hundred times in a day.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p31"></a>We ought, therefore, to observe carefully in what manner we ought to remain firm among so many storms. It is because</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.v-p32"></a>we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things which have been given to us by God, <br> 			 (<a name="v.v-p32.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012">1Co 2:12</a><a name="v.v-p32.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p33"></a>This single witness powerfully drives away, scatters, and overturns, all that the world rears up to obscure or crush the truth of God. All who are endued with this Spirit are so far from being in danger of falling into despondency on account of the hatred or contempt of the world, that every one of them will obtain glorious victory over the whole world. Yet we must beware of relying on the good opinion of men; for so long as faith shall wonder 			 in this manner, or rather, as soon as it shall have gone out of the sanctuary of God, it must become involved in miserable uncertainty. It must, therefore, be brought back to the inward and secret testimony of the Spirit, which, believers know, has been given to them from heaven.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p34"></a>The Spirit is said to <i>testify of Christ</i>, because he retains and fixes our faith on him alone, that we may not seek elsewhere any part of our salvation. He calls him also the <i>Comforter</i>, that, relying on his protection, we may never 			 be alarmed; for by this title Christ intended to fortify our faith, that it may not yield to any temptations. When he calls him <i>the Spirit of truth</i>, we must apply the term to the matter in hand; for we must presuppose a contrast to this effect, that, when they have not this Witness, men are carried about in various ways, and have no firm resting-place, but, 			 wherever he speaks, he delivers the minds of men from all doubt and fear of being deceived.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p35"></a>When he says that he <i>will send him from the Father</i>, and, again, that <i>he proceedeth from the Father</i>, he does so in order to increase the weight of his authority; for the testimony of 			 <i>the Spirit</i> would not be sufficient against attacks so powerful, and against efforts so numerous and fierce, if we were not convinced that <i>he proceedeth from God</i>  So then it is Christ who sends the Spirit, but it is from the 			 heavenly glory, that we may know that it is not a gift of men, but a sure pledge of Divine grace. Hence it appears how idle was the subtlety of the Greeks, when they argued, on the ground of these words, that the Spirit does not<i> proceed</i> from the Son; for here Christ, according to his custom, mentions <i>the 			 Father </i>in order to raise our eyes to the contemplation of his Divinity.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.v-p36"></a><a name="v.v-p36.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p37"></a><b>27.</b><i> And you also bear testimony.</i> Christ means that the testimony of <i>the Spirit </i>will not be of such a nature that the apostles shall have it for their private advantage, or that they alone shall enjoy it, but that by them it will be widely diffused, because they will 			 be organs of the Holy Spirit, as indeed, he spoke by their mouth. We now see in what way <i>faith is by hearing</i>, (<a name="v.v-p37.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017">Ro 10:17</a><a name="v.v-p37.1"></a>,) and yet it derives its certainty from the <i>seal </i>and <i>earnest of the Spirit</i>, (<a name="v.v-p37.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013">Eph. 1:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014">14</a><a name="v.v-p37.2"></a>.) Those who do not sufficiently know the darkness of the human mind imagine that faith is formed naturally by hearing and preaching alone;   			  <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">92</font></a>
  			  and there are many fanatics who disdain the outward preaching, and talk in lofty terms about secret revelations and inspirations, (<a name="v.v-p38.2"></a>ἐνθουσιασμοὺς) But we see how Christ joins these two things together; and, therefore, though there is no faith till the Spirit of God seal our minds and hearts, still we 			 must not go to seek visions or oracles in the clouds; but the word,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.v-p39"></a>which is near us, in our mouth and heart, <br> 			 (<a name="v.v-p39.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008">Ro 10:8</a><a name="v.v-p39.2"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p40"></a>must keep all our senses bound and fixed on itself, as Isaiah says beautifully:</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.v-p41"></a>My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever, <br> 			 (<a name="v.v-p41.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021">Isa 59:21</a><a name="v.v-p41.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p42"></a><i>Because you are with me from the beginning.</i> This clause was added in order to inform us that so much the greater credit is due to the apostles on this ground, that they were eye-witnesses of what they relate; as John says,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="v.v-p43"></a>what we have heard, what we have seen, <br> 			 what our hands have handled, we declare to you; <br> 			 (<a name="v.v-p43.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001">1Jo 1:1</a><a name="v.v-p43.3"></a>)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.v-p44"></a>for thus the Lord intended to provide for our welfare in every possible way, that nothing might be wanting for a full confirmation of the Gospel.</p>
