 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.xliii"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xliii-p0.1"></a>43. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.xliii-p1"></a>The third petition is, THY WILL BE DONE ON EARTH AS IT IS IN  HEAVEN. Though this depends on his kingdom, and cannot be disjoined from it, yet  a separate place is not improperly given to it on account of our ignorance,  which does not at once or easily apprehend what is meant by God reigning in the  world. This, therefore, may not improperly be taken as the explanation, that God  will be King in the world when all shall subject themselves to his will. We are  not here treating of that secret will by which he governs all things, and  destines them to their end (see chap. xxiv. s. 17). For although devils and men  rise in tumult against him, he is able by his incomprehensible counsel not only  to turn aside their violence, but make it subservient to the execution of his  decrees. What we here speak of is another will of God, namely, that of which  voluntary obedience is the counterpart; and, therefore, heaven is expressly  contrasted with earth, because, as is said in The Psalms, the angels "do his  commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word" (<a name="iii.xliii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020">Psalm 103:20</a><a name="iii.xliii-p1.1"></a>). We are,  therefore, enjoined to pray that as everything done in heaven is at the command  of God, and the angels are calmly disposed to do all that is right, so the earth  may be brought under his authority, all rebellion and depravity having been  extinguished. In presenting this request we renounce the desires of the flesh,  because he who does not entirely resign his affections to God, does as much as  in him lies to oppose the divine will, since everything which proceeds from us  is vicious. Again, by this prayer we are taught to deny ourselves, that God may  rule us according to his pleasure; and not only so, but also having annihilated  our own may create new thoughts and new minds so that we shall have no desire  save that of entire agreement with his will; in short, wish nothing of  ourselves, but have our hearts governed by his Spirit, under whose inward  teaching we may learn to love those things which please and hate those things  which displease him. Hence also we must desire that he would nullify and  suppress all affections which are repugnant to his will.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="iii.xliii-p2"></a>Such are the three first heads of the prayer, in presenting which we should  have the glory of God only in view, taking no account of ourselves, and paying  no respect to our own advantage, which, though it is thereby greatly promoted,  is not here to be the subject of request. And though all the events prayed for  must happen in their own time, without being either thought of, wished, or asked  by us, it is still our duty to wish and ask for them. And it is of no slight  importance to do so, that we may testify and profess that we are the servants  and children of God, desirous by every means in our power to promote the honour  due to him as our Lord and Father, and truly and thoroughly devoted to his  service. Hence if men, in praying that the name of God may be hallowed, that his  kingdom may come, and his will be done, are not influenced by this zeal for the  promotion of his glory, they are not to be accounted among the servants and  children of God; and as all these things will take place against their will, so  they will turn out to their confusion and destruction.</p>
