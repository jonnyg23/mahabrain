 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.xxvii"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xxvii-p0.1"></a>27. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.xxvii-p1"></a>On the whole, since Scripture places the principal part of worship  in the invocation of God (this being the office of piety which he requires of us  in preference to all sacrifices), it is manifest sacrilege to offer prayer to  others. Hence it is said in the psalm: "If we have forgotten the name of our  God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god, shall not God search this  out?" (<a name="iii.xxvii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#020">Ps. 44:20</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#021">21</a><a name="iii.xxvii-p1.1"></a>). Again, since it is only in faith that God desires to be  invoked, and he distinctly enjoins us to frame our prayers according to the rule  of his word: in fine, since faith is founded on the word, and is the parent of  right prayer, the moment we decline from the word, our prayers are impure. But  we have already shown, that if we consult the whole volume of Scripture, we  shall find that God claims this honour to himself alone. In regard to the office  of intercession, we have also seen that it is peculiar to Christ, and that no  prayer is agreeable to God which he as Mediator does not sanctify. And though  believers mutually offer up prayers to God in behalf of their brethren, we have  shown that this derogates in no respect from the sole intercession of Christ,  because all trust to that intercession in commending themselves as well as  others to God. Moreover, we have shown that this is ignorantly transferred to  the dead, of whom we nowhere read that they were commanded to pray for us. The  Scripture often exhorts us to offer up mutual prayers; but says not one syllable  concerning the dead; nay, James tacitly excludes the dead when he combines the  two things, to "confess our sins one to another, and to pray one for another"  (<a name="iii.xxvii-p1.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016">James 5:16</a><a name="iii.xxvii-p1.2"></a>). Hence it is sufficient to condemn this error, that the beginning  of right prayer springs from faith, and that faith comes by the hearing of the  word of God, in which there is no mention of fictitious intercession,  superstition having rashly adopted intercessors who have not been divinely  appointed. While the Scripture abounds in various forms of prayer, we find no  example of this intercession, without which Papists think there is no prayer.  Moreover, it is evident that this superstition is the result of distrust,  because they are either not contented with Christ as an intercessor, or have  altogether robbed him of this honour. This last is easily proved by their  effrontery in maintaining, as the strongest of all their arguments for the  intercession of the saints, that we are unworthy of familiar access to God.  This, indeed, we acknowledge to be most true, but we thence infer that they  leave nothing to Christ, because they consider his intercession as nothing,  unless it is supplemented by that of George and Hypolyte, and similar phantoms.</p>
