 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.xxxiii"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xxxiii-p0.1"></a>33. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.xxxiii-p1"></a>It is also plain that the public prayers are not to be couched in  Greek among the Latins, nor in Latin among the French or English (as hitherto  has been every where practised), but in the vulgar tongue, so that all present  may understand them, since they ought to be used for the edification of the  whole Church, which cannot be in the least degree benefited by a sound not  understood. Those who are not moved by any reason of humanity or charity, ought  at least to be somewhat moved by the authority of Paul, whose words are by no  means ambiguous: "When thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that  occupieth the room of the unlearned say, Amen, at thy giving of thanks, seeing  he understandeth not what thou sayest? For thou verily givest thanks, but the  other is not edified" (<a name="iii.xxxiii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016">1 Cor. 14:16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#017">17</a><a name="iii.xxxiii-p1.1"></a>). How then can one sufficiently admire  the unbridled license of the Papists, who, while the Apostle publicly protests  against it, hesitate not to bawl out the most verbose prayers in a foreign  tongue, prayers of which they themselves sometimes do not understand one  syllable, and which they have no wish that others should understand? <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">21</font></a>
  Different  is the course which Paul prescribes, "What is it then? I will pray with the  spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also; I will sing with the  spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also:" meaning by the  <i>spirit</i> the special gift of tongues, which some who had received it abused  when they dissevered it from the mind, that is, the understanding. The principle  we must always hold is, that in all prayer, public and private, the tongue  without the mind must be displeasing to God. Moreover, the mind must be so  incited, as in ardour of thought far to surpass what the tongue is able to  express. Lastly, the tongue is not even necessary to private prayer, unless in  so far as the internal feeling is insufficient for incitement, or the vehemence  of the incitement carries the utterance of the tongue along with it. For  although the best prayers are sometimes without utterance, yet when the feeling  of the mind is overpowering, the tongue spontaneously breaks forth into  utterance, and our other members into gesture. Hence that dubious muttering of  Hannah (<a name="iii.xxxiii-p1.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#013">1 Samuel 1:13</a><a name="iii.xxxiii-p1.4"></a>), something similar to which is experienced by all the  saints when concise and abrupt expressions escape from them. The bodily gestures  usually observed in prayer, such as kneeling and uncovering of the head (Calv.  in <a name="iii.xxxiii-p1.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#036">Acts 20:36</a><a name="iii.xxxiii-p1.5"></a>), are exercises by which we attempt to rise to higher veneration  of God.</p>
