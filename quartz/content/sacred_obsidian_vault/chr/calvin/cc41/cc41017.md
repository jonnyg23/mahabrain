 <p><a name="iv.vi.i-p8"></a><b>1.</b><i> Be ye therefore followers.</i> The same principle is followed out and enforced by the consideration that children ought to be like their father. He reminds us that we are the children of God, and that therefore we ought, as far as possible, to resemble Him in acts of kindness. It is impossible not to perceive, that the division of chapters, in the present instance, is 		particularly unhappy, as it has made a separation between parts of the subject which are very closely related. If, then, we are the children of God, we ought to be <i>followers of God.</i> Christ also declares, that, unless we shew kindness to the unworthy, we cannot be the children of our heavenly Father.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.i-p9"></a>“Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you; <i>that ye may be the children of your</i> <i>Father which is in heaven</i>; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the 		unjust.”<br> 		(<a name="iv.vi.i-p9.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044">Matt. 5:44</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045">45</a><a name="iv.vi.i-p9.2"></a>.)   		 <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_152"><font size="1">153</font></a>

 <p><a name="iv.vi.i-p12"></a><b>2.</b> <i>And walk in love as Christ also hath loved us.</i> Having called on us to imitate God, he now calls on us to imitate Christ, who is our true model. We ought to embrace each other with that love with which Christ has embraced us, for what we perceive in Christ is our true guide.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.i-p13"></a><i>And gave himself for us.</i> This was a remarkable proof of the highest love. Forgetful, as it were, of himself, Christ spared not his own life, that he might redeem us from death. If we desire to be partakers of this benefit, we must cultivate similar affections toward our neighbors. Not that any of us has reached such high perfection, but all must aim and strive according to the measure of their 		ability.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.i-p14"></a><i>An offering and a sacrifice to God of a sweet smelling savor.</i> While this statement leads us to admire the grace of Christ, it bears directly on the present subject. No language, indeed, can fully represent the consequences and efficacy of Christ’s death. This is the only price by which we are reconciled to God. The doctrine of faith on this subject holds the highest rank. But the more 		extraordinary the discoveries which have reached us of the Redeemer’s kindness, the more strongly are we bound to his service. Besides, we may infer from Paul’s words, that, unless we love one another, none of our duties will be acceptable in the sight of God. If the reconciliation of men, effected by Christ, was <i>a sacrifice of a sweet smelling savor, </i>  		 <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">154</font></a>

 <p><a name="iv.vi.ii-p14"></a><b>3.</b> <i>But fornication.</i> This chapter, and the <a name="iv.vi.ii-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#000">Col 3</a><a name="iv.vi.ii-p14.1"></a>, contain many parallel passages, which an intelligent reader will be at no loss to compare without my assistance. Three things are here enumerated, which the 		apostle desires Christians to hold in such abhorrence, that they shall not even be named, or, in other words, shall be entirely unknown among them. By <i>uncleanness</i> he means all base and impure lusts; so that this word differs from <i>fornication,</i> only as the whole class differs from a single department. The third is <i>covetousness,</i> which is nothing more than an immoderate desire of gain. To this precept he adds the authoritative declaration, that he demands nothing from them but that which <i>becometh saints,</i> — manifestly excluding from the number and fellowship of the saints all fornicators, and impure and covetous persons.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.vi.ii-p15"></a><a name="iv.vi.ii-p15.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.ii-p16"></a><b>4.</b> <i>Neither filthiness.</i> To those three — other three are now added. By <i>filthiness</i> I understand all that is indecent or inconsistent with the modesty of the godly. By <i>foolish talking</i> I understand conversations that are either unprofitably or wickedly 		foolish; and as it frequently happens that idle talk is concealed under the garb of <i>jesting</i> or wit, he expressly mentions pleasantry, — which is so agreeable as to seem worthy of commendation, — and condemns it as a part of <i>foolish talking</i>  The Greek word εὐτραπελία is often used by heathen writers, in a good sense, for 		that ready and ingenious pleasantry in which able and intelligent men may properly indulge. But as it is exceedingly difficult to be witty without becoming satirical, and as jesting itself carries in it a portion of conceit not at all in keeping with the character of a godly man, Paul very properly dissuades from this practice.   		 <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_154"><font size="1">155</font></a>
  		 Of all the three offenses now mentioned, Paul declares that they are <i>not convenient,</i> or, in other words, that they are inconsistent with Christian duty.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.ii-p18"></a><i>But rather grace.</i> Others render it <i>giving of thanks;</i> but I prefer Jerome’s interpretation. With the vices which had been formerly mentioned it was proper that Paul should contrast something of a general character, displaying itself in all our communications with each other. If he had said, “While 		they take pleasure in idle or abusive talk, do you give thanks to God,” the exhortation would have been too limited. The Greek word, εὐχαριστία, though it usually signifies <i>Thanksgiving,</i> admits of being translated <i>Grace.</i> “All our conversations ought 		to be, in the true sense of the words, sweet and graceful; and this end will be gained if the useful and the agreeable are properly mingled.”</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.vi.ii-p19"></a><a name="iv.vi.ii-p19.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.ii-p20"></a><b>5.</b> <i>For this ye know.</i> If his readers were at all captivated by the allurements of those vices which have been enumerated, the consequence would be that they would lend a hesitating or careless ear to his admonitions. He determines, therefore, to alarm them by this weighty and dreadful threatening, that such vices shut against us the kingdom of God. 		By appealing to their own knowledge, he intimates that this was no doubtful matter. Some might think it harsh, or inconsistent with the Divine goodness, that all who have incurred the guilt of fornication or covetousness are excluded from the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven. But the answer is easy. Paul does not say that those who have fallen into those sins, and recovered from them, are not pardoned, but pronounces sentence on the sins themselves. After addressing the Corinthians in the 		same language, he adds:</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.vi.ii-p21"></a>“And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.”<br> 		(<a name="iv.vi.ii-p21.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011">1Co 6:11</a><a name="iv.vi.ii-p21.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.ii-p22"></a>When men have repented, and thus give evidence that they are reconciled to God, they are no longer the same persons that they formerly were. But let all fornicators, or unclean or covetous persons, so long as they continue such, be assured that they have no friendship with God, and are deprived of all hope of salvation. It is called <i>the kingdom of Christ and of God,</i> 		because God hath given it to his Son that we may obtain it through him.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.ii-p23"></a><i>Nor covetous man, who is an idolater.</i>  “Covetousness,” as he says in another place, “is idolatry,” (<a name="iv.vi.ii-p23.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005">Col 3:5</a><a name="iv.vi.ii-p23.2"></a>,) — not the idolatry which is so frequently condemned in Scripture, but one of a different description. All covetous men must deny God, and put wealth in his place; such is their blind greediness of wretched gain. But why does Paul attribute to covetousness alone what belongs equally to other carnal passions? In what respect is covetousness better entitled to this disgraceful name than ambition, or than a vain confidence in 		ourselves? I answer, that this disease is widely spread, and not a few minds have caught the infection. Nay, it is not reckoned a disease, but receives, on the contrary, very general commendation. This accounts for the harshness of Paul’s language, which arose from a desire to tear from our hearts the false view.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.vi.ii-p24"></a><a name="iv.vi.ii-p24.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.ii-p25"></a><b>6.</b><i> Let no man deceive you.</i> There have always been ungodly dogs,   		 <a name="fr_155"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">156</font></a>
  		 by whom the threatenings of the prophets were made the subject of merriment and ridicule. We find such characters in our own day. In all ages, indeed, Satan raises up sorcerers of this description, who endeavor by unholy scoffs to escape the Divine judgment, and who actually exercise a kind of fascination over consciences not sufficiently established in the fear of God. “This is a trivial fault. Fornication is 		viewed by God as a light matter. Under the law of grace God is not so cruel. He has not formed us so as to be our own executioners. The frailty of nature excuses us.” These and similar expressions are often used by the scoffers. Paul, on the contrary, exclaims that we must guard against that sophistry by which consciences are ensnared to their ruin.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.ii-p27"></a><i>For because of these things cometh the wrath of God.</i> If we consider the present tense to be here used, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, for the future, these words are a threatening of the last judgment. But I agree with those who take the word <i>cometh</i> in an indefinite sense, — <i>the word of 		God</i> usually <i>cometh,</i> — as reminding them of the ordinary judgments of God which were executed before their own eyes. And certainly, if we were not blind and slothful, there are sufficiently numerous examples by which God testifies that he is the just avenger of such crimes, — examples of the pouring out of divine indignation, privately against individuals, and publicly against cities, and kings, and nations.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.ii-p28"></a><i>Upon the children of disobedience,</i> — upon <i>unbelievers</i> or <i>rebels.</i> This expression must not be overlooked. Paul is now addressing believers, and his object is not so much to present alarming views of their own danger, as to rouse them to behold reflected in wicked men, as in mirrors, the dreadful 		judgments of God. God does not make himself an object of terror to his children, that they may avoid him, but does all that can be done in a fatherly manner, to draw them to himself. They ought to learn this lesson, not to involve themselves in a dangerous fellowship with the ungodly, whose ruin is thus foreseen.</p>  <a name="iv.vi.iii"></a>

 <p><a name="iv.vi.iii-p18"></a><b>8.</b> <i>For ye were once darkness.</i> The precepts which immediately follow derive greater weight from the motives with which they are mingled. Having spoken of unbelievers, and warned the Ephesians not to become partakers of their crimes and their destruction, he argues still further, that they ought to differ widely from the life and conduct of those 		men. At the same time, in order to guard them against ingratitude to God, he refreshes their remembrance of their own past life. “You ought,” he says, “to be very different persons from what you formerly were; for out of darkness God hath made you light.” <i>Darkness</i> is the name here given to the whole nature of man before regeneration; for, where the brightness of God does not shine, there is nothing but fearful darkness. <i>Light,</i> again, is the name given to those who are <i>enlightened</i> by the Spirit of God; for immediately afterwards in the same sense, he calls them <i>children of light,</i> and draws the inference, that they ought to walk in light, because by the mercy of God they had been rescued from darkness. Observe here, we are said to be<i> light in the Lord,</i> because, while we are out of Christ, all is under the dominion of Satan, whom we know to be the Prince of darkness.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.vi.iii-p19"></a><a name="iv.vi.iii-p19.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.iii-p20"></a><b>9.</b> <i>For the fruit of the light. </i>  		 <a name="fr_156"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">157</font></a>
  		 This parenthesis is introduced, to point out the road in which the <i>children of light</i> ought to walk. A complete description is not given, but a few parts of a holy and pious life are introduced by way of example. To give them a general view of duty, their attention is again directed to the will of God. Whoever desires to live in a proper and safe manner, let him resolve to obey God, and to take his will as the rule. 		To regulate life entirely by his command is, as he says in another Epistle, <i>a reasonable service,</i> (<a name="iv.vi.iii-p21.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001">Ro 12:1</a><a name="iv.vi.iii-p21.3"></a>,) or, as another inspired man expresses it, <i>To obey is better than sacrifice.</i> (<a name="iv.vi.iii-p21.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022">1Sa 15:22</a><a name="iv.vi.iii-p21.4"></a>.) I wonder how the word Spirit (πνεὐματος) has crept into many Greek manuscripts, as the other reading is more consistent, — <i>the fruit of the light</i>  Paul’s meaning indeed is not affected; for in either case it will be this, that believers must walk in the light, because they are “children 		of the light.” This is done, when they do not live according to their own will, but devote themselves entirely to obedience to God, — when they undertake nothing but by his command. Besides, such obedience is testified by its fruits, such as <i>goodness, righteousness, and truth.</i></p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.vi.iii-p22"></a><a name="iv.vi.iii-p22.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.iii-p23"></a><b>11.</b><i> And have no fellowship.</i> As “the children of light” dwell amidst the darkness, or, in other words, in the midst of “a perverse and crooked generation,” (<a name="iv.vi.iii-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005">De 32:5</a><a name="iv.vi.iii-p23.1"></a>,) — there is good reason for warning them to keep themselves apart from wicked actions. It is not enough that we do not, of our own accord, undertake anything wicked. We must beware of joining or assisting those who do wrong. In short, we must abstain from giving any consent, or advice, or approbation, or assistance; for in all these ways we <i>have 		fellowship.</i> And lest any one should imagine that he has done his duty, merely by not conniving, he adds, <i>but rather reprove them. </i>  		 <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">158</font></a>
  		 Such a course is opposed to all dissimulation. Where a manifest offense is committed against God, every man will be eager to vindicate himself from any share in the guilt, but very few will guard against connivance; nearly all will practice some kind of dissimulation. But rather than the truth of God shall not remain unshaken, let a hundred worlds perish.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.iii-p25"></a>The word ἐλέγχειν, which is translated <i>reprove,</i> answers to the metaphor of darkness; for it literally signifies to drag forth to the light what was formerly unknown. As ungodly men flatter themselves in their vices, (<a name="iv.vi.iii-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#002">Ps 36:2</a><a name="iv.vi.iii-p25.1"></a>,) and wish their crimes to be concealed, or to be reckoned virtues, Paul enjoins that they shall be <i>reproved.</i> He calls them <i>unfruitful;</i> because they not only do no good, but are absolutely hurtful.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.vi.iii-p26"></a><a name="iv.vi.iii-p26.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.iii-p27"></a><b>12.</b> <i>Which are done by them in secret.</i> This shews the advantage of reproving the ungodly. If they do but escape the eyes of men, there is no crime, however shocking to be mentioned, which they will not perpetrate. To use a common proverb, “Night has no shame.” What is the reason of this? Sunk in the darkness of ignorance, they neither see their own baseness, nor think that it is seen by God and by angels. But let the torch of God’s word be brought forward, and their eyes are opened. Then they begin to blush and be ashamed. By their advices and reproofs the saints enlighten blind unbelievers, and drag forth from their concealment to the light of day those who were sunk in ignorance.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.iii-p28"></a>When unbelievers keep the doors of their houses shut, and withdraw from the view of men, <i>it is a shame even to speak of</i> the baseness and wickedness with which they rush into all manner of licentiousness. Would they thus lay aside all shame, and give loose reins to their passions, if darkness did not give them courage, — if they did not entertain 		the hope that what is hidden will pass unpunished? But do you, by reproving them, bring forward the light, that they may be ashamed of their own baseness. Such shame, arising from an acknowledgment of baseness, is the first step to repentance.</p>

Erasmus, by substituting another word for<i> reprove,</i> has destroyed the whole meaning; for Paul’s object is to shew that it will not be without advantage if the works of unbelievers are reproved.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.vi.iii-p32"></a><b>13.</b> <i>But when all things are reproved.</i> As the participle, (φανερούμενον,) which is translated,<i> that which doth make manifest,</i> is in the middle voice, it admits either of a passive or active signification. It may be either 		rendered, <i>that which is made manifest,</i> or <i>that which doth make manifest.</i> If the passive signification, which is followed by the ancient translator, be preferred, the word <i>light</i> will denote, as formerly, <i>that which gives light,</i> and the meaning will be, that evil works, which had been concealed, will 		stand out to public view, when they have been <i>made manifest</i> by the word of God: If the participle be taken actively, there will still be two ways of expounding it: 1. Whatever manifests is light; 2. That which manifests anything or all things, is light; taking the singular as put for the plural number. There is no difficulty, as Erasmus dreaded, about the article; for the apostles are not in the habit of adhering very strictly to rule about 		placing every article, and even among elegant writers this mode of using it would be allowable. The context appears to me to shew clearly that this is Paul’s meaning. He had exhorted them to reprove the evil works of unbelievers, and thus to drag them out of darkness; and he now adds, that what he enjoins upon them is the proper business of light — <i>to make manifest</i>  It is Light, he says, which makes all things manifest; 		and hence it followed that they were unworthy of the name, if they did not bring to light what was involved in darkness.</p>

I shall state my opinion. He first exhibits Christ as speaking by his ministers; for this is the ordinary message which is every day delivered by preachers of the gospel. What other object do 		they propose than to raise the dead to life?</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.vi.iii-p35"></a>“The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live”<br> 		(<a name="iv.vi.iii-p35.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025">Joh 5:25</a><a name="iv.vi.iii-p35.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.iii-p36"></a>Let us now attend to the context. “Unbelievers,” Paul had said, “must be reproved, that, being brought forth to the light, they may begin to acknowledge their wickedness.” He therefore represents Christ as uttering a voice which is constantly heard in the preaching of the gospel,</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.iii-p37"></a><i>Arise, thou that sleepest.</i> The allusion, I have no doubt, is to the prophecies which relate to Christ’s kingdom; such as that of Isaiah,</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.vi.iii-p38"></a>“Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah<br> 		is risen upon thee” (<a name="iv.vi.iii-p38.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001">Isa 60:1</a><a name="iv.vi.iii-p38.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.iii-p39"></a>Let us therefore endeavor, as far as lies in our power, to rouse the sleeping and dead, that we may bring them to the light of Christ.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.iii-p40"></a><i>And Christ shall give thee light.</i> This does not mean that, when we have risen from death to life, his light begins to shine upon us, as if our performances came before his grace. All that is intended is to show that, when Christ enlightens us, we rise from death to life, — and thus to confirm the former statement, that unbelievers must be recovered from their blindness, in order to be saved. 		Instead of ἐπιφαύσει, <i>he</i> <i>shall give light,</i> some copies read ἐφάψεται, <i>he shall touch;</i> but this reading is an evident blunder, and may be dismissed without any argument.   		 <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">159</font></a>

The community at large is divided, as it were, into so many yokes, out of which arises mutual 		obligation. There is, first, the yoke of marriage between husband and wife; — secondly, the yoke which binds parents and children; — and, thirdly, the yoke which connects masters and servants. By this arrangement there are six different classes, for each of whom Paul lays down peculiar duties. He begins with wives, whom he enjoins to be subject to their husbands, in the same manner as to Christ, — <i>as to the Lord.</i> Not that the authority is equal, 		but wives cannot obey Christ without yielding obedience to their husbands.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.vi.v-p24"></a><b>23.</b> <i>For the husband is the head of the wife.</i> This is the reason assigned why wives should be obedient. Christ has appointed the same relation to exist between a husband and a wife, as between himself and his church. This comparison ought to produce a stronger impression on their minds, than the mere declaration that such is the appointment of God. 		Two things are here stated. God has given to the husband authority over the wife; and a resemblance of this authority is found in Christ, who <i>is the head of the church,</i> as the husband is of the wife.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.v-p25"></a><i>And he is the savior of the body.</i> The pronoun HE (αὐτός) is supposed by some to refer to <i>Christ;</i> and, by others, to <i>the husband.</i> It applies more naturally, in my opinion, to Christ, but still with a view to the present subject. In this point, as well 		as in others, the resemblance ought to hold. As Christ rules over his church for her salvation, so nothing yields more advantage or comfort to the wife than to be subject to her husband. To refuse that subjection, by means of which they might be saved, is to choose destruction.</p>

The particle <i>but,</i> may lead some to believe that the words, <i>he is the savior of the body,</i> are intended to anticipate an objection. Christ has, no doubt, 		this peculiar claim, that he is the Savior of the Church: nevertheless, let wives know, that their husbands, though they cannot produce equal claims, have authority over them, after the example of Christ. I prefer the former interpretation; for the argument derived from the word <i>but,</i> (ἀλλά,) does not appear to me to have much weight.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.vi.v-p29"></a><b>25.</b> <i>Husbands, love your wives.</i> From husbands, on the other hand, the apostle requires that they cherish toward their wives no ordinary love; for to them, also, he holds out the example of Christ, — <i>even as Christ also loved the church.</i> If they are honored to bear his image, 		and to be, in some measure, his representatives, they ought to resemble him also in the discharge of duty.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.v-p30"></a><i>And gave himself for it.</i> This is intended to express the strong affection which husbands ought to have for their wives, though he takes occasion, immediately afterwards, to commend the grace of Christ. Let husbands imitate Christ in this respect, that he scrupled not to die for his church. One peculiar consequence, indeed, which resulted from his death, — that by it he redeemed his church, — is 		altogether beyond the power of men to imitate.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.vi.v-p32"></a><b>26.</b> <i>That he might sanctify,</i> — or, that he might separate it to himself; for such I consider to be the meaning of the word <i>sanctify</i>  This is accomplished by the forgiveness of sins, and the regeneration of the Spirit.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.v-p33"></a><i>Washing it with the washing of water.</i> Having mentioned the inward and hidden sanctification, he now adds the outward symbol, by which it is visibly confirmed; as if he had said, that a pledge of that sanctification is held out to us by baptism. Here it is necessary to guard against unsound interpretation, lest the wicked superstition of men, as has frequently happened, change a sacrament into an 		idol. When Paul says that we are washed by baptism, his meaning is, that God employs it for declaring to us that we are washed, and at the same time performs what it represents. If the truth — or, which is the same thing, the exhibition of the truth — were not connected with baptism, it would be improper to say that baptism is the washing of the soul. At the same time, we must beware of ascribing to the sign, or to the minister, what belongs to God alone. We must not imagine that washing is 		performed by the minister, or that water cleanses the pollutions of the soul, which nothing but the blood of Christ can accomplish. In short, we must beware of giving any portion of our confidence to the element or to man; for the true and proper use of the sacrament is to lead us directly to Christ, and to place all our dependence upon him.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.v-p34"></a>Others again suppose that too much importance is given to the sign, by saying that baptism is the washing of the soul. Under the influence of this fear, they labor exceedingly to lessen the force of the eulogium which is here pronounced on baptism. But they are manifestly wrong; for, in the first place, the apostle does not say that it is the sign which washes, but declares it to be exclusively the work of God. It is God who washes, and 		the honor of performing it cannot lawfully be taken from its Author and given to the sign. But there is no absurdity in saying that God employs a sign as the outward means. Not that the power of God is limited by the sign, but this assistance is accommodated to the weakness of our capacity. Some are offended at this view, imagining that it takes from the Holy Spirit a work which is peculiarly his own, and which is everywhere ascribed to him in Scripture. But they are mistaken; for God acts by 		the sign in such a manner, that its whole efficacy depends upon his Spirit. Nothing more is attributed to the sign than to be an inferior organ, utterly useless in itself, except so far as it derives its power from another source.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.v-p35"></a>Equally groundless is their fear, that by this interpretation the freedom of God will be restrained. The grace of God is not confined to the sign; so that God may not, if he pleases, bestow it without the aid of the sign. Besides, many receive the sign who are not made partakers of grace; for the sign is common to all, to the good and to the bad alike; but the Spirit is bestowed on none but the elect, and the sign, as we 		have said, has no efficacy without the Spirit. The Greek participle καθαρίσας, is in the past tense, as if he had said, “After having washed.” But, as the Latin language has no active participle in the past tense, I chose rather to disregard this, and to translate it (<a name="iv.vi.v-p35.1"></a><i>mundans</i>) <i>washing,</i> instead of (<a name="iv.vi.v-p35.2"></a><i>mundatam</i>) <i>having been</i> <i>washed;</i> which would have kept out of view a matter of far greater importance, namely, that to God alone belongs the work of 		cleansing.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.v-p36"></a><i>In the word. </i>  		 <a name="fr_164"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">165</font></a>
  		 This is very far from being a superfluous addition; for, if the <i>word</i> is taken away, the whole power of the sacraments is gone. What else are the sacraments but seals of the word? This single consideration will drive away superstition. How comes it that superstitious men are confounded by signs, but because their minds are not directed to the <i>Word,</i> which would lead 		them to God? Certainly, when we look to anything else than to the word, there is nothing sound, nothing pure; but one absurdity springs out of another, till at length the signs, which were appointed by God for the salvation of men, become profane, and degenerate into gross idolatry. The only difference, therefore, between the sacraments of the godly and the contrivances of unbelievers, is found in the Word.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.v-p38"></a>By the <i>Word</i> is here meant the promise, which explains the value and use of the signs. Hence it appears, that the Papists do not at all observe the signs in a proper manner. They boast indeed, of having “the Word,” but appear to regard it as a sort of enchantment; for they 		mutter it in an unknown tongue; as if it were addressed to dead matter, and not to men. No explanation of the mystery is made to the people; and in this respect, were there no other, the sacrament begins to be nothing more than the dead element of water.<i> In the word</i> is equivalent to “By the word.”</p>

 <p><a name="iv.vi.v-p40"></a><b>27.</b> <i>That he might present it to himself.</i> He declares what is the design of baptism and of our being washed. It is, that we may live in a holy and unblamable manner before God. We are washed by Christ, not that we may return to our pollution, but that we may retain through our life the purity which we have once received. This is described in 		metaphorical language appropriate to his argument.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.v-p41"></a><i>Not having spot or wrinkle.</i> As the beauty of the wife produces love in the husband, so Christ adorns the Church his bride with holiness as a proof of his regard. This metaphor contains an allusion to marriage; but he afterwards lays aside the figure, and says plainly, that Christ has reconciled the church, <i>that it might be holy and without blemish.</i> 		The true beauty of the church consists in this conjugal chastity, that is, in holiness and purity.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.v-p42"></a>The word <i>present</i> (παραστήσὟ) implies that the church ought to be holy, not only in the view of men, but in the eyes of the Lord; for Paul says, <i>that he might present it to himself,</i> not that he might shew it to others, though the fruits of that hidden purity become afterwards 		evident in outward works. Pelagians were wont to quote this passage in order to prove the perfection of righteousness in this life, but have been successfully answered by Augustine. Paul does not state what has been done, but for what purpose Christ has cleansed his church. Now, when a thing is said to be done that another may afterwards follow, it is idle to conclude that this latter thing, which ought to follow, has been already done. We do not deny that the holiness of the church is already 		begun; but, so long as there is daily progress, there cannot be perfection.</p>  <a name="iv.vi.vi"></a>

 <p><a name="iv.vi.vi-p16"></a><b>28.</b><i> He that loveth his wife.</i> An argument is now drawn from nature itself, to prove that men ought to love their wives. Every man, by his very nature, loves himself. But no man can love himself without loving his wife. Therefore, the man who does not love his wife is a monster. The minor proposition is proved in this manner. Marriage was appointed by God on the condition 		that the two should be <i>one flesh;</i> and that this unity may be the more sacred, he again recommends it to our notice by the consideration of Christ and his church. Such is the amount of his argument, which to a certain extent applies universally to human society. To shew what man owes to man, Isaiah says, “hide not thyself from thine own 		flesh.” (<a name="iv.vi.vi-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007">Isa 58:7</a><a name="iv.vi.vi-p16.1"></a>.) But this refers to our common nature. Between a man and his wife there is a far closer relation; for they not only are united by a resemblance of nature, but by the bond of marriage have become one man. Whoever considers seriously the design of marriage cannot but love his wife.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.vi.vi-p18"></a><b>29.</b><i> Even as Christ the church.</i> He proceeds to enforce the obligations of marriage by representing to us Christ and his Church; for a more powerful example could not have been adduced. The strong affection which a husband ought to cherish towards his wife is exemplified by Christ, and an instance of that unity which belongs to marriage is declared to exist between himself 		and the Church. This is a remarkable passage on the mysterious intercourse which we have with Christ.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.vi.vi-p19"></a><a name="iv.vi.vi-p19.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.vi-p20"></a><b>30.</b> <i>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</i> First, this is no exaggeration, but the simple truth. Secondly, he does not simply mean that Christ is a partaker of our nature, but expresses something higher (καὶ ἐμφατικώτερον) <i>and</i> <i>more emphatic.</i></p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.vi.vi-p21"></a><a name="iv.vi.vi-p21.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.vi-p22"></a><b>31.</b> <i>For this cause.</i> This is an exact quotation from the writings of Moses. (<a name="iv.vi.vi-p22.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024">Ge 2:24</a><a name="iv.vi.vi-p22.1"></a>.) And what does it mean? As Eve was formed out of the substance of her husband, and thus was a part of himself; so, if we are the true members of 		Christ, we share his substance, and by this intercourse unite into one body. In short, Paul describes our union to Christ, a symbol and pledge of which is given to us in the ordinance of the supper. Those who talk about the torture exercised on this passage to make it refer to the Lord’s supper, while no mention is made of the supper, but of marriage, are egregiously mistaken. When they admit that the death of Christ is commemorated in the supper, but not that such intercourse exists as we 		assert from the words of Christ, we quote this passage against them. Paul says that <i>we are members of his flesh and of his bones.</i> Do we wonder then, that in the Lord’s supper he holds out his body to be enjoyed by us, and to nourish us unto eternal life? Thus we prove that the only union which we maintain to be represented by the Lord’s supper is here declared in its truth and consequences by the apostle.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.vi-p23"></a>Two subjects are exhibited together; for the spiritual union between Christ and his church is so treated as to illustrate the common law of marriage, to which the quotation from Moses relates. He immediately adds, that the saying is fulfilled in <i>Christ and the church.</i> Every opportunity which presents itself for proclaiming our obligations to Christ is readily embraced, 		but he adapts his illustration of them to the present subject. It is uncertain whether Moses introduces Adam as using these words, or gives them as an inference drawn by himself from the creation of man. Nor is it of much consequence which of these views be taken; for, in either case, we must hold it to be an announcement of the will of God, enjoining the duties which men owe to their wives.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.vi-p24"></a><i>He shall leave his father and mother.</i> As if he had said, “Let him rather <i>leave his father and mother</i> than not cleave to his wife.” The marriage bond does not set aside the other duties of mankind, nor are the commandments of God so inconsistent with 		each other, that a man cannot be a good and faithful husband without ceasing to be a dutiful son. It is altogether a question of degree. Moses draws the comparison, in order to express more strongly the close and sacred union which subsists between husband and wife. A son is bound by an inviolable law of nature to perform his duties towards his father; and when the obligations of a husband towards his wife are declared to be stronger, their force is the better understood. He who resolves to be 		a good husband will not fail to perform his filial duties, but will regard marriage as more sacred than all other ties.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.vi-p25"></a><i>And they two shall be one flesh.</i> They shall be one man, or, to use a common phrase, they shall constitute one person; which certainly would not hold true with regard to any other kind of relationship. All depends on this, that the wife was formed of the flesh and bones of her husband. Such is the union between us and Christ, who in some sort makes us partakers of his substance. “We are bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh,” (<a name="iv.vi.vi-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023">Ge 2:23</a><a name="iv.vi.vi-p25.1"></a>;) not because, like ourselves, he has a human nature, but because, by the power of his Spirit, he makes us a part of his body, so that from him we derive our life.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iv.vi.vi-p26"></a><a name="iv.vi.vi-p26.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.vi-p27"></a><b>32.</b> <i>This is a great mystery.</i> He concludes by expressing his astonishment at the spiritual union between Christ and the church. <i>This is a great mystery;</i> by which he means, that no language can explain fully what it implies. It is to no purpose that men fret themselves to comprehend, by the judgment 		of the flesh, the manner and character of this union; for here the infinite power of the Divine Spirit is exerted. Those who refuse to admit anything on this subject beyond what their own capacity can reach, act an exceedingly foolish part. We tell them that the flesh and blood of Christ are exhibited to us in the Lord’s supper. “Explain to us the manner,” they reply, “or you will not convince us.” For my own part, I am overwhelmed by the depth of this mystery, and am not ashamed to join Paul in acknowledging at once my ignorance and my admiration. How much more satisfactory would this be than to follow my carnal judgment, in undervaluing what Paul declares to be a deep mystery! Reason itself teaches how we ought to act in such matters; for whatever is supernatural is 		clearly beyond our own comprehension. Let us therefore labor more to feel Christ living in us, than to discover the nature of that intercourse.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.vi-p28"></a>We cannot avoid admiring the acuteness of the Papists, who conclude from the word <i>mystery</i> (μυστήριον) that marriage is one of seven sacraments, as if they had the power of changing water into wine. They enumerate seven sacraments, while Christ has instituted no more than two; and, to prove that 		matrimony is one of the seven, they produce this passage. On what ground? Because the Vulgate has adopted the word <i>Sacrament</i> (<a name="iv.vi.vi-p28.1"></a><i>sacramentum</i>) as a translation of the word <i>Mystery,</i> which the apostle uses. As if Sacrament (<a name="iv.vi.vi-p28.2"></a><i>sacramentum</i>) did not frequently, among Latin writers, denote <i>Mystery,</i> or as if <i>Mystery</i> had not been the word employed by Paul in the same Epistle, when speaking of the calling of the Gentiles. But the present question is, Has marriage been appointed as a sacred symbol of the grace of God, to declare and represent to us something spiritual, such as 		Baptism or the Lord’s Supper? They have no ground for such an assertion, unless it be that they have been deceived by the doubtful signification of a Latin word, or rather by their ignorance of the Greek language. If the simple fact had been observed, that the word used by Paul is <i>Mystery,</i> no mistake would ever have occurred.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.vi-p29"></a>We see then the hammer and anvil with which they fabricated this sacrament. But they have given another proof of their indolence in not attending to the correction which is immediately added,</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.vi.vi-p30"></a><i>But I speak concerning Christ and the church.</i> He intended to give express warning that no man should understand him as speaking of marriage; so that his meaning is more fully expressed than if he had uttered the former sentiment without any exception. The <i>great mystery</i> is, that Christ breathes into the church his own life and power. But who would 		discover here anything like a sacrament? This blunder arose from the grossest ignorance.</p>

Husbands are required to love their wives, and wives to <i>fear</i> (φοβὢται) their husbands, understanding by <i>fear</i> that <i>reverence</i> which will lead them to be submissive. Where reverence does not exist, there will be no willing subjection.   		 <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">166</font></a>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.vi.vi-p33"></a> “One peculiarity in this injunction has been usually overlooked. What is instructive on either side is not enforced, but what is necessary to direct and hallow such an instinct is inculcated. The woman loves in deep, undying sympathy; but, to teach her how this fondness should know and fill its appropriate sphere, she is commanded to obey and honor. The man, on the other hand, feels that his position is to govern; but, to shew him what should 			 be the essence and means of his government, he is enjoined to love.” — Eadie.</p>
