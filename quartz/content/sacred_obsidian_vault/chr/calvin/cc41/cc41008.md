 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p14"></a><b>1.</b> <i>Now I say</i>. Whoever made the division into chapters has improperly separated this paragraph from the preceding, as it is nothing else than the concluding section, (ἐπεξεργασία,) in which Paul explains and illustrates the difference that exists between us and the ancient people. He does so by 		introducing a third comparison, drawn from the relation which a person under age bears to his tutor. The young man, though he is free, <i>though he is lord of all</i> his father’s family, still resembles a slave; for he is under the government of tutors.   		 <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">65</font></a>
  		 But the period of guardianship lasts only “until the time appointed by the father” after which he enjoys his freedom. In this respect the fathers under the Old Testament, being the sons of God, were free; but they were not in possession of freedom, while the law held the place of their tutor, and kept them under its yoke. That slavery of the law lasted as long as it pleased God, who put an end to it at the coming of Christ. Lawyers enumerate various methods by 		which the tutelage or guardianship is brought to a close; but of all these methods, the only one adapted to this comparison is that which Paul has selected, “the appointment of the father.”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p16"></a>Let us now examine the separate clauses. Some apply the comparison in a different manner to the case of any man whatever, whereas Paul is speaking of two nations. What they say, I acknowledge, is true; but it has nothing to do with the present passage. The elect, though they are the children of God from the womb, yet, until by faith they come to the possession of freedom, remain like slaves under the law; but, from the time that they have 		known Christ, they no longer require this kind of tutelage. Granting all this, I deny that Paul here treats of individuals, or draws a distinction between the time of unbelief and the calling by faith. The matters in dispute were these. Since the church of God is one, how comes it that our condition is different from that of the Israelites? Since we are free by faith, how comes it that they, who had faith in common with us, were not partakers with us of the same freedom? Since we are all 		equally the children of God, how comes it that we at this day are exempt from a yoke which they were forced to bear? On these points the controversy turned, and not on the manner in which the law reigns over each of us before we are freed by faith from its slavery. Let this point be first of all settled, that Paul here compares the Israelitish church, which existed under the Old Testament, with the Christian church, that thus we may perceive in what points we agree and in what we differ. This 		comparison furnishes most abundant and most profitable instruction.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p17"></a>First, we learn from it that our hope at the present day, and that of the fathers under the Old Testament, have been directed to the same inheritance; for they were partakers of the same adoption. According to the dreams of some fanatics, and of Servetus among others, the fathers were divinely elected for the sole purpose of prefiguring to us a people of God. Paul, on the other hand, contends that they were elected in order to be together 		with us the children of God, and particularly attests that to them, not less than to us, belonged the spiritual blessing promised to Abraham.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p18"></a>Secondly, we learn that, notwithstanding their outward slavery, their consciences were still free. The obligation to keep the law did not hinder Moses and Daniel, all the pious kings, priests, and prophets, and the whole company of believers, from being free in spirit. They bore the yoke of the law upon their shoulders, but with a free spirit they worshipped God. More particularly, having been instructed concerning the free pardon of sin, 		their consciences were delivered from the tyranny of sin and death. Hence we ought to conclude that they held the same doctrine, were joined with us in the true unity of faith, placed reliance on the one Mediator, called on God as their Father, and were led by the same Spirit. All this leads to the conclusion, that the difference between us and the ancient fathers lies in accidents, not in substance. In all the leading characters of the Testament or Covenant we agree: the ceremonies and form of 		government, in which we differ, are mere additions. Besides, that period was the infancy of the church; but now that Christ is come, the church has arrived at the estate of manhood.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p19"></a>The meaning of Paul’s words is clear, but has he not some appearance of contradicting himself? In the Epistle to the Ephesians he exhorts us to make daily progress</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.vi.i-p20"></a>“till we come to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.” (<a name="iii.vi.i-p20.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013">Eph 4:13</a><a name="iii.vi.i-p20.1"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p21"></a>In the first Epistle to the Corinthians he says, (<a name="iii.vi.i-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#002">1Co 3:2</a><a name="iii.vi.i-p21.1"></a>,)</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.vi.i-p22"></a>“I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able;”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p23"></a>and shortly after this he compares the Galatians to children. (<a name="iii.vi.i-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019">Ga 4:19</a><a name="iii.vi.i-p23.1"></a>) In those passages, I reply, the apostle speaks of particular men, and of their faith as individuals; but here he speaks generally of two bodies without regard to persons. This reply will assist us in resolving a much greater difficulty. When we look at the matchless faith of 		Abraham, and the vast intelligence of the holy prophets, with what effrontery shall we dare to talk of such men as our inferiors? Were not they rather the heroes, and we the children? To say nothing of ourselves, who among the Galatians would have been found equal to any of those men?</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p24"></a>But here, as I have already said, the apostle describes not particular persons, but the universal condition of both nations. Some men were endowed with extraordinary gifts; but they were few, and the whole body did not share with them. Besides, though they had been numerous, we must inquire not what they inwardly were, but what was that kind or government under which God had placed them; and that was manifestly a school, 		παιδαγωγία, a system of instruction for children. And what are we now? God has broken those chains, governs his church in a more indulgent manner, and lays not upon us such severe restraint. At the same time, we may remark in passing, that whatever amount of knowledge they might attain partook of the nature of the period; for a dark cloud continually rested on the revelation which they enjoyed. And hence that saying of our Savior,</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p25"></a>“Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see: for I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.” (<a name="iii.vi.i-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#023">Luke 10:23</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#024">24</a><a name="iii.vi.i-p25.1"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p26"></a>We now understand in what respect we are preferred to those who were greatly our superiors; for the statements are not applied to persons, but relate entirely to the economy of the Divine administration.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p27"></a>This passage will prove a most powerful battery for destroying the pageantry of ceremonies, which constitutes the entire splendor of the Papal system. For what else is it that dazzles the eyes of simple people, so as to lead them to regard the dominion of the Pope, if not with admiration, at least with some degree of reverence, but the magnificent army of ceremonies, rites, gesticulations, and equipage of every description, contrived for 		the express purpose of amazing the ignorant? From this passage it appears that they are false disguises, by which the true beauty of the church is impaired. I do not now speak of greater and more frightful corruptions, such as, that they hold them out for divine worship, imagine them to possess the power of meriting salvation, and enforce with more rigid severity the observation of those trifles than the whole law of God. I only advert to the specious pretext under which our modern contrivers 		apologize for such a multitude of abominations. What though they object that the ignorance of the multitude prevails to a greater extent than it formerly did among the Israelites, and that many assistances are therefore required? They will never be able in this way to prove that the people must be placed under the discipline or a school similar to what existed among the people of Israel; for I shall always meet them with the declaration, that the appointment of God is totally different.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p28"></a>If they plead expediency, I ask, are they better judges of what is expedient than God himself? Let us entertain the firm conviction that the highest advantage, as well as the highest propriety, will be found in whatever God has determined. In aiding the ignorant, we must employ not those methods which the fancy of men may have been pleased to contrive, but those which had been fixed by God themself, who unquestionably has left out nothing 		that was fitted to assist their weakness. Let this shield suffice for repelling any objections: “God has judged otherwise, and his purpose supplies to us the place of all arguments; unless it be supposed that men are capable of devising better aids than those which God had provided, and which he afterwards threw aside as useless.” Let it be carefully observed, Paul does not merely say that the yoke which had been laid upon the Jews is removed from us, but expressly lays down a distinction in 		the government which God has commanded to be observed. I acknowledge that we are now at liberty as to all outward matters, but only on the condition that the church shall not be burdened with a multitude of ceremonies, nor Christianity confounded with Judaism. The reason of this we shall afterwards consider in the proper place.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p30"></a><b>3.</b> <i>Under the elements of the world. Elements</i> may either mean, literally, outward and bodily things, or, metaphorically, rudiments. I prefer the latter interpretation. But why does he say that those things which had a spiritual signification were <i>of the world</i>? We did not, he says, enjoy the truth in 		a simple form, but involved in earthly figures; and consequently, what was outward must have been “of the world,” though there was concealed under it a heavenly mystery.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.vi.i-p31"></a><a name="iii.vi.i-p31.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p32"></a><b>4.</b> <i>When the fullness of the time was come</i>. He proceeds with the comparison which he had adduced, and applies to his purpose the expression which has already occurred, “the time appointed by the Father,” — but still shewing that the time which had been ordained by the providence of God was proper and seasonable. That season is the most fit, and 		that mode of acting is the most proper, which the providence of God directs. At what time it was expedient that the Son of God should be revealed to the world, it belonged to God alone to judge and determine. This consideration ought to restrain all curiosity. Let no man presume to be dissatisfied with the secret purpose of God, and raise a dispute why Christ did not appear sooner. If the reader desires more full information on this subject, he may consult what I have written on the conclusion 		of the Epistle to the Romans.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p33"></a><i>God sent forth his Son</i>. These few words contain much instruction. The Son, who was sent, must have existed before he was sent; and this proves his eternal Godhead. Christ therefore is the Son of God, sent from heaven. Yet this same person was <i>made of a woman</i>, because he assumed our nature, which shews that he has two natures. Some copies read 		<i>natum</i> instead of <i>filium</i>; but the latter reading is more generally followed, and, in my opinion, is preferable. But the language was also expressly intended to distinguish Christ from other men, as having been formed of the substance of his mother, and not by ordinary generation. In any other sense, it would have been trifling, and foreign to the subject. The word <i>woman</i> is here put generally for the female sex.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p34"></a><i>Subjected under the law.</i> The literal rendering is, <i>Made under the law</i>; but in my version I have preferred another word, which expresses more plainly the fact that he was placed in subjection to the law. Christ the Son of God, who might have claimed to be exempt from every kind of subjection, became subject to the law. Why? He did so in our room, 		that he might obtain freedom for us. A man who was free, by constituting himself a surety, redeems a slave: by putting on himself the chains, he takes them off from the other. So Christ chose to become liable to keep the law, that exemption from it might be obtained for us; otherwise it would have been to no purpose that he should come under the yoke of the law, for it certainly was not on his own account that he did so.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p35"></a><i>To redeem them that were under the law</i>    		 <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">66</font></a>
  		 We must here observe, the exemption from the law which Christ has procured for us does not imply that we no longer owe any obedience to the doctrine of the law, and may do whatever we please; for the law is the everlasting rule of a good and holy life. But Paul speaks of the law with all its appendages. From subjection to that law we are redeemed, because it is no longer what it once was. “The vail being rent,” (<a name="iii.vi.i-p36.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051">Mt 27:51</a><a name="iii.vi.i-p36.1"></a>,) freedom is openly proclaimed, and this is what he immediately adds.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.vi.i-p37"></a><a name="iii.vi.i-p37.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.i-p38"></a><b>5.</b> <i>That we might receive the adoption</i>. The fathers, under the Old Testament, were certain of their adoption, but did not so fully as yet enjoy their privilege. <i>Adoption</i>, like the phrase, “the redemption of our body,” (<a name="iii.vi.i-p38.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023">Ro 8:23</a><a name="iii.vi.i-p38.2"></a>,) is here put for actual possession. As, at the last day, we receive the fruit of our redemption, so now we receive the fruit of adoption, of which the holy fathers did not partake before the coming of Christ; and therefore those who now burden the church with an excess of ceremonies, defraud her of the just right of adoption.</p>  <a name="iii.vi.ii"></a>  	  		 		     		  
 <p class="TableCaption15"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p1"></a><a name="iii.vi.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006">Galatians 4:6-11</a><a name="iii.vi.ii-p1.1"></a></p> 		    		 		     		  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p2"></a><b>6.</b> And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</p> 		     		  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p3"></a><b>6.</b> Quoniam autem estis filii, misit Deus Spiritum Filii sui in corda vestra, clamantem, Abba, Pater.</p> 		    		 		     		  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p4"></a><b>7.</b> Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p16"></a><b>6.</b> <i>And because ye are sons</i>. The adoption which he had mentioned, is proved to belong to the Galatians by the following argument. This adoption must have preceded the testimony of adoption given by the Holy Spirit; but the effect is the sign of the cause. In venturing, he says, to call God your Father, you have the advice 		and direction of the Spirit of Christ; therefore it is certain that you are the sons of God. This agrees with what is elsewhere taught by him, that the Spirit is the earnest and pledge of our adoption, and gives to us a well-founded belief that God regards us with a father’s love.</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p17"></a>“Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit<br> 		in our hearts.” (<a name="iii.vi.ii-p17.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022">2Co 1:22</a><a name="iii.vi.ii-p17.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p18"></a>“Now he that hath wrought us for the self-same thing is God,<br> 		who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.”<br> 		(<a name="iii.vi.ii-p18.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#005">2Co 5:5</a><a name="iii.vi.ii-p18.3"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p19"></a>But it will be objected, do not wicked men, too, carry their rashness so far as to proclaim that God is their Father? Do they not frequently, with greater confidence than others, utter their false boasts? I reply, Paul’s language does not relate to idle boasting, or to the proud opinion of himself which any man may entertain, but to the testimony of a pious conscience which accompanies the new birth. This argument can have no weight but 		in the case of believers, for ungodly men have no experience of this certainty; as our Lord himself declares.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p20"></a>“The Spirit of truth,” says he, “whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him.”<br> 		(<a name="iii.vi.ii-p20.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017">Joh 14:17</a><a name="iii.vi.ii-p20.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p21"></a>This is implied in Paul’s words, <i>God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts</i>. It is not what the persons themselves, in the foolish judgment of the flesh, may venture to believe, but what God declares in their hearts by his Spirit. <i>The Spirit of his Son</i> is a title more strictly adapted to the present 		occasion than any other that could have been employed. We are the sons of God, because we have received the same Spirit as his only Son.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p22"></a>Let it be observed, that Paul ascribes this universally to all Christians; for where this pledge of the Divine love towards us is wanting, there is assuredly no faith. Hence it is evident what sort of Christianity belongs to Popery, since any man who says, that he has the Spirit of God, is charged by them with impious presumption. Neither the Spirit of God, nor certainty, belongs to their notion of faith. This single tenet held by them 		is a remarkable proof that, in all the schools of the Papists, the devil, the father of unbelief, reigns. I acknowledge, indeed, that the scholastic divines, when they enjoin upon the consciences of men the agitation of perpetual doubt, are in perfect agreement with what the natural feelings of mankind would dictate. It is the more necessary to fix in our minds this doctrine of Paul, that no man is a Christian who has not learned, by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, to call God his Father.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p23"></a><i>Crying</i>. This participle, I think, is used in order to express greater boldness. Hesitation does not allow us to speak freely, but keeps the mouth nearly shut, while the half-broken words can hardly escape from a stammering tongue. “Crying,” on the other hand, expresses firmness and unwavering confidence.</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p24"></a>“For we have not received again the spirit of bondage to fear,<br> 		but of freedom to full confidence.” (<a name="iii.vi.ii-p24.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015">Ro 8:15</a><a name="iii.vi.ii-p24.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p25"></a><i>Abba, Father</i>. The meaning of these words, I have no doubt, is, that calling upon God is common to all languages. It is a fact which bears directly on the present subject, that the name <i>Father</i> is given to God both by the Hebrews and by the Greeks; as had been predicted by Isaiah,</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p26"></a>“Every tongue shall make confession to my name.”<br> 		(<a name="iii.vi.ii-p26.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023">Isa 45:23</a><a name="iii.vi.ii-p26.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p27"></a>The whole of this subject is handled by the apostle at greater length in his Epistle to the Romans. I judge it unnecessary to repeat here observations which I have already made in the exposition of that Epistle, and which the reader may consult. Since, therefore, Gentiles are reckoned among the sons of God, it is evident that adoption comes not by the merit of the law, but by the grace of faith.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p29"></a><b>7.</b> <i>Wherefore thou art no more a servant</i>. In the Christian Church slavery no longer exists, but the condition of the children is free. In what respect the fathers under the law were slaves, we have already inquired; for their freedom was not yet revealed, but was hidden under the coverings and yoke of the law. Our attention is again directed to 		the distinction between the Old and New Testaments. The ancients were also sons of God, and heirs through Christ, but we hold the same character in a different manner; for we have Christ present with us, and in that manner enjoy his blessings.</p>

His object is to make their fall appear more criminal, by comparing it with past events. It is not wonderful, he says, 		that formerly <i>ye did service to them which by nature are no gods</i>; for, wherever ignorance of God exists, there must be dreadful blindness. You were then wandering in darkness, but how disgraceful is it that in the midst of light you should fall into such gross errors! The main inference is, that the Galatians were less excusable for corrupting the gospel than they had formerly been for idolatry. But here it ought to be observed, that, till we 		have been enlightened in the true knowledge of one God, we always serve idols, whatever pretext we may throw over the false religion. The lawful worship of God, therefore, must be preceded by just views of his character<i>. By nature</i>, that is, in reality, <i>they are no gods</i>. Every object of worship which men contrive is a creature of their own imagination. In the opinion of men idols may be gods, but 		in reality they are nothing.</p>

  		<i> after that ye have known God</i>. No language can express the base ingratitude of departing from God, when he has once been known. What is it but to forsake, of our own accord, the light, the life, the fountain of all benefits, — “to forsake,” as Jeremiah complains,</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p35"></a>“the fountain of living waters, and hew out cisterns,<br> 		broken cisterns, that can hold no water!” (<a name="iii.vi.ii-p35.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013">Jer 2:13</a><a name="iii.vi.ii-p35.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p36"></a>Still farther to heighten the blame, he corrects his language, and says, <i>or rather have been, known by God</i>; for the greater the grace of God is towards us, our guilt in despising it must be the heavier. Paul reminds the Galatians whence they had derived the knowledge of God. He affirms that they did not obtain it by their own exertions, by the acuteness or industry of 		their own minds, but because, when they were at the farthest possible remove from thinking of him, God visited them in his mercy. What is said of the Galatians may be extended to all; for in all are fulfilled the words of Isaiah,</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p37"></a>“I am sought by them that asked not for me:<br> 		I am found by them that sought me not.” (<a name="iii.vi.ii-p37.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001">Isa 65:1</a><a name="iii.vi.ii-p37.2"></a>.)</p>

The expression is figurative, and merely denotes, that to fall again into wicked superstition, as if they had never received the truth of God, was the height of folly. When he calls the ceremonies <i>beggarly elements</i>, he views them as out of Christ, and, what is more, as opposed to Christ. To the fathers they were not only profitable exercises and aids to piety, but efficacious means of grace. But then their whole value lay in Christ, and in the appointment of God. The false apostles, on the other hand, neglecting the promises, endeavored to oppose the ceremonies to Christ, as if Christ alone were not sufficient. That they should be regarded by Paul as 		worthless trifles, cannot excite surprise; but of this I have already spoken. The word <i>bondage</i> conveys a reproof for submitting to be slaves.   		 <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">68</font></a>

 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p42"></a><b>10.</b><i> Ye observe days</i>. He adduces as an instance one description of “elements,” the observance of days. No condemnation is here given to the observance of dates in the arrangements of civil society. The order of nature out of which this arises, is fixed and constant. How are months and years computed, but by the revolution of the sun and moon? What distinguishes summer 		from winter, or spring from harvest, but the appointment of God, — an appointment which was promised to continue to the end of the world? (<a name="iii.vi.ii-p42.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022">Ge 8:22</a><a name="iii.vi.ii-p42.1"></a>.) The civil observation of days contributes not only to agriculture and to matters of politics, and ordinary life, but is even extended to the government of the church. Of what nature, then, was the observation which Paul reproves? It 		was that which would bind the conscience, by religious considerations, as if it were necessary to the worship of God, and which, as he expresses it in the Epistle to the Romans, would make a distinction between one day and another. (<a name="iii.vi.ii-p42.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#005">Ro 14:5</a><a name="iii.vi.ii-p42.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p43"></a>When certain days are represented as holy in themselves, when one day is distinguished from another on religious grounds, when holy days are reckoned a part of divine worship, then days are improperly observed. The Jewish Sabbath, new moons, and other festivals, were earnestly pressed by the false apostles, because they had been appointed by the law. When we, in the present age, intake a distinction of days, we do not represent them as 		necessary, and thus lay a snare for the conscience; we do not reckon one day to be more holy than another; we do not make days to be the same thing with religion and the worship of God; but merely attend to the preservation of order and harmony. The observance of days among us is a free service, and void of all superstition.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p45"></a><b>11.</b> <i>Lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain</i>. The expression is harsh, and must have filled the Galatians with alarm; for what hope was left to them, if Paul’s labor had been in vain? Some have expressed astonishment that Paul should be so powerfully affected by the observance of days, as almost to designate it a subversion of the whole 		gospel. But if we carefully weigh the whole, we shall see that there was just reason; and that the false apostles not only attempted to lay the yoke of Jewish bondage on the neck of the church, but filled their minds with wicked superstitions. To bring back Christianity to Judaism, was in itself no light evil; but far more serious mischief was done, when, in opposition to the grace of Christ, they set up holidays as meritorious performances, and pretended that this mode of worship would 		propitiate the divine favor. When such doctrines were received, the worship of God was corrupted, the grace of Christ made void, and the freedom of conscience oppressed.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p46"></a>Do we wonder that Paul should be afraid that he had labored in vain, that the gospel would henceforth be of no service? And since that very description of impiety is now supported by Popery, what sort of Christ or what sort of gospel does it retain? So far as respects the binding of consciences, they enforce the observance of days with not less severity than was done by Moses. They consider holidays, not less than the false apostles did, 		to be a part of the worship of God, and even connect with them the diabolical notion of merit. The Papists must therefore be held equally censurable with the false apostles; and with this addition in aggravation, that, while the former proposed to keep those days which had been appointed by the law of God, the latter enjoin days, rashly stamped with their own seal, to be observed as most holy.</p>  <a name="iii.vi.iii"></a>

 <p><a name="iii.vi.iii-p22"></a><b>12.</b> <i>Be as I am</i>. Having till now spoken roughly, he begins to adopt a milder strain. The former harshness had been more than justified by the heinousness of the offense; but as he wished to do good, he resolves to adopt a style of conciliation. It is the part of a wise pastor to consider, not what those who have wandered may justly deserve, but 		what may be the likeliest method of bringing them back to the right path. He must “be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine.” (<a name="iii.vi.iii-p22.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002">2Ti 4:2</a><a name="iii.vi.iii-p22.1"></a>.) Following the method which he had recommended to Timothy, he leaves off chiding, and begins to use entreaties. <i>I beseech you</i>, he says, 		and calls them<i> brethren</i>, to assure them that no bitterness had mingled with his reproofs.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iii-p23"></a>The words, <i>be as I am</i>, refer to the affection of the mind.

The proverb still holds: “to be loved, you must be lovely.”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iii-p24"></a><i>Ye have not injured me at all</i>. This is intended to remove the suspicion which might have rendered his former reproofs more disagreeable. If we think that a person is speaking under a sense of injury, or revenging a private quarrel, we turn away our minds from him entirely, and are sure to torture whatever he says into an unfavourable interpretation. Paul therefore meets the rising prejudice by 		saying, “So far as respects myself, I have no cause to complain of you. It is not on my own account, nor from any hostility to you, that I feel warmly; and therefore, if I use strong language, it must arise from some other cause than hatred or anger.”</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vi.iii-p26"></a><b>13.</b> <i>Ye know that, through infirmity of the flesh</i>. He recalls to their recollection the friendly and respectful manner in which they had received him, and he does so for two reasons. First, to let them know that he loved them, and thus to gain a ready ear to all that he says; and secondly, to encourage them, that, as they had begun well, they 		would go on in the same course. This mention of past occurrences, then, while it is an expression of his kind regards, is intended likewise as an exhortation to act in the same manner as they had done at an earlier period.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iii-p27"></a>By <i>infirmity of the flesh</i> he means here, as in other places, what had a tendency to make him appear mean and despised. <i>Flesh</i> denotes his outward appearance, which the word infirmity describes to have been contemptible. Such was Paul when he came among them, without show, without pretense, without worldly honors or rank, 		without everything that could gain him respect or estimation in the eyes of men. Yet all this did not prevent the Galatians from giving him the most honorable reception. The narrative contributes powerfully to his argument, for what was there in Paul to awaken their esteem or veneration, but the power of the Holy Spirit alone? Under what pretext, then, will they now begin to despise that power? Next, they are charged with inconsistency, since no subsequent occurrence in the life of Paul could 		entitle them to esteem him less than before. But this he leaves to be considered by the Galatians, contenting himself with indirectly suggesting it as a subject of consideration.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vi.iii-p29"></a><b>14.</b> <i>My temptation</i>. That is, “Though ye perceived me to be, in a worldly point of view, a contemptible person, yet ye did not reject me.” He calls it a <i>temptation</i> or trial, because it was a thing not unknown or hidden, and he did not himself attempt to conceal it, as is usually done by ambitious 		men, who are ashamed of anything about them that may lower them in public estimation. It frequently happens that unworthy persons receive applause, before their true character has been discovered, and shortly afterwards are dismissed with shame and disgrace. But widely different was the case of Paul, who had used no disguise to impose on the Galatians, but had frankly told them what he was.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iii-p30"></a><i>As an angel of God</i>. In this light every true minister of Christ ought to be regarded. As God employs the services of angels for communicating to us his favors, so godly teachers are divinely raised up to administer to us the most excellent of all blessings, the doctrine of eternal salvation. Not without good reason are they, by whose hands God dispenses to us such a treasure, compared to 		angels: for they too are the messengers of God, by whose mouth God speaks to us. And this argument is used by Malachi.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iii-p31"></a>“The priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth, <i>for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts</i>.” (<a name="iii.vi.iii-p31.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007">Mal 2:7</a><a name="iii.vi.iii-p31.1"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iii-p32"></a>But the apostle rises still higher, and adds, <i>even as Christ Jesus</i>; for the Lord himself commands that his ministers shall be viewed in the same light as himself.</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.vi.iii-p33"></a>“He that heareth you heareth me,<br> 		and he that despiseth you despiseth me.” (<a name="iii.vi.iii-p33.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016">Lu 10:16</a><a name="iii.vi.iii-p33.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iii-p34"></a>Nor is this wonderful; for it is in his name that they discharge their embassy, and thus they hold the rank of him in whose room they act. Such is the highly commendatory language which reveals to us at once the majesty of the gospel, and the honorable character of its ministry. If it be the command of Christ that his ministers shall be thus honored, it is certain that contempt of them proceeds from the instigation of the devil; and 		indeed they never can be despised so long as the word of God is esteemed. In vain do the Papists attempt to hold out this pretext for their own arrogant pretensions. As they are plainly the enemies of Christ, how absurd is it that they should assume the garb, and take to themselves the character, of Christ’s servants! If they wish to obtain the honors of angels, let them perform the duty of angels: if they wish that we should listen to them as to Christ, let them convey to us faithfully his 		pure word.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vi.iii-p36"></a><b>15.</b> <i>Where is there your blessedness?</i> Paul had made them happy, and he intimates that the pious affection with which they formerly regarded him was an expression of their happiness. But now, by allowing themselves to be deprived of the services of him to whom they ought to have attributed whatever knowledge they possessed of Christ, they gave 		evidence that they were unhappy. This hint was intended to produce keen reflection. “What? Shall all this be lost? Will you forfeit all the advantage of having once heard Christ speaking by my lips? Shall the foundation in the faith which you received from me be to no purpose? Shall your falling away now destroy the glory of your obedience in the presence of God?” In short, by despising the pure doctrine which they had embraced, they throw away, of their own accord, the <i>blessedness</i> which they had obtained, and draw down upon themselves the destruction in which their unhappy career must terminate.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iii-p37"></a><i>For I bear you record</i>. It is not enough that pastors be respected, if they are not also loved; for both are necessary to make the doctrine they preach be fully relished; and both, the apostle declares, had existed among the Galatians. He had already spoken of their respect for him, and he now speaks of their love. To be willing to <i>pluck out their own eyes</i>, if it had been necessary, was an evidence of very extraordinary love, stronger than the willingness to part with life.</p>

It was entirely their own fault, he says, that they had changed their minds. Though it is a common remark, that truth begets hatred, yet, except through the malice and wickedness of those who cannot endure to hear it, truth is never hateful. 		While he vindicates himself from any blame in the unhappy difference between them, he indirectly censures their ingratitude. Yet still his advice is friendly, not to reject, on rash or light grounds, the apostleship of one whom they had formerly considered to be worthy of their warmest love. What can be more unbecoming than that the hatred of truth should change enemies into friends? His aim then is, not so much to upbraid, as to move them to repentance.</p>

He mentions the immoderate ambition of those men, and warns the Galatians not to be led astray by 		their appearance of zeal. The comparison is borrowed from honorable love, as contrasted with those professions of regard which arise from unhallowed desires. Jealousy, on the part of the false apostles, ought not to impose upon them; for it proceeded not from right zeal, but from an improper desire of obtaining reputation, — a desire most unlike that holy jealousy of which Paul speaks to the Corinthians.</p>

  		 They not only endeavor to gain your affections, but, as they cannot obtain possession of you by any other means, they endeavor to kindle strife between us. When you have been thrown as it were destitute, they expect that you will yield yourselves up to them; for they perceive that, so long as there shall be maintained between us a religious harmony, they can have no influence. This stratagem is frequently resorted to by all the ministers of Satan. By producing in 		the people a dislike of their pastor, they hope afterwards to draw them to themselves; and, having disposed of the rival, to obtain quiet possession.

It may mean: “They indeed attempt to withdraw your affections from 		me, that, when you are thrown destitute, you may go over to them; but do you, who loved me while I was present, continue to cherish the same regard for me when I am absent.” But a more correct explanation is suggested by the opposite senses which the word ζηλοῦσθαι bears. As, in the former verse, he had used the word <i>jealous</i> in a bad sense, denoting an improper way of accomplishing an object, so 		here he uses it in a good sense, denoting a zealous imitation of the good qualities of another.

 <p><a name="iii.vi.iii-p58"></a>This is a remarkable passage for illustrating the efficacy of the Christian ministry.

Let us always attend to this distinction, that, when a minister is contrasted with God, he is nothing, and can do nothing, and is utterly useless; but, because the Holy Spirit works efficaciously by means of him, he comes to be regarded and praised as an agent. Still, it is not what he can do in himself, or apart from God, but what God does by him, that is there described. If ministers wish to do anything, let them labor to form Christ, not to form themselves, in their hearers.

 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p17"></a><i>To be under the law</i>, signifies here, to come under the yoke of the law, on the condition that God will act toward you according to the covenant of the law, and that you, in return, bind yourself to keep the law.

 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p19"></a><b>22.</b> <i>For it is written</i>. No man who has a choice given him will be so mad as to despise freedom, and prefer slavery. But here the apostle teaches us, that they who are under the law are slaves. Unhappy men! who willingly choose this condition, when God desires to make them free. He gives a representation of this in the two sons of Abraham, one of 		whom, the son of a slave, held by his mother’s condition;   		 <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">73</font></a>
  		 while the other, the son of a free woman, obtained the inheritance. He afterwards applies the whole history to his purpose, and illustrates it in an elegant manner.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p21"></a>In the first place, as the other party armed themselves with the authority of the law, the apostle quotes the law on the other side. <i>The law</i> was the name usually given to the Five Books of Moses. Again, as the history which he quotes appeared to have no bearing on the question, he gives to it an allegorical interpretation. But as the apostle declares that these things 		are <i>allegorized</i>, (ἀλληγορούμενα,) Origen, and many others along with him, have seized the occasion of torturing Scripture, in every possible manner, away from the true sense. They concluded that the literal sense is too mean and poor, and that, under the outer bark of the letter, there lurk deeper mysteries, which cannot be extracted but by beating out allegories. And this they had no difficulty 		in accomplishing; for speculations which appear to be ingenious have always been preferred, and always will be preferred, by the world to solid doctrine.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p22"></a>With such approbation the licentious system gradually attained such a height, that he who handled Scripture for his own amusement not only was suffered to pass unpunished, but even obtained the highest applause. For many centuries no man was considered to be ingenious, who had not the skill and daring necessary for changing into a variety of curious shapes the sacred word of God. This was undoubtedly a contrivance of Satan to undermine 		the authority of Scripture, and to take away from the reading of it the true advantage. God visited this profanation by a just judgment, when he suffered the pure meaning of the Scripture to be buried under false interpretations.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p23"></a>Scripture, they say, is fertile, and thus produces a variety of meanings.  		 <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">74</font></a>
  		I acknowledge that Scripture is a most rich and inexhaustible fountain of all wisdom; but I deny that its fertility consists in the various meanings which any man, at his pleasure, may assign. Let us know, then, that the true meaning of Scripture is the natural and obvious meaning; and let us embrace and abide by it resolutely. Let us not only neglect as doubtful, but boldly set aside as deadly corruptions, those pretended expositions, which lead us away from the natural 		meaning.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p25"></a>But what reply shall we make to Paul’s assertion, that these things <i>are allegorical</i>? Paul certainly does not mean that Moses wrote the history for the purpose of being turned into an allegory, but points out in what way the history may be made to answer the present subject. This is done by observing a figurative representation of the Church there delineated. And a 		mystical interpretation of this sort (ἀναγωγή) was not inconsistent with the true and literal meaning, when a comparison was drawn between the Church and the family of Abraham. As the house of Abraham was then a true Church, so it is beyond all doubt that the principal and most memorable events which happened in it are so many types to us. As in circumcision, in sacrifices, in the whole Levitical priesthood, there was an allegory, as there is an 		allegory at the present day in our sacraments, — so was there likewise in the house of Abraham; but this does not involve a departure from the literal meaning. In a word, Paul adduces the history, as containing a figurative representation of the two covenants in the two wives of Abraham, and of the two nations in his two sons. And Chrysostom, indeed, acknowledges that the word <i>allegory</i> points out the present application to be (κατάχρησις)  		 <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">75</font></a>
  		 different from the natural meaning; which is perfectly true.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p28"></a><b>23.</b> <i>But he who was of the bond woman</i>. Both were sons of Abraham according to the flesh; but in Isaac there was this peculiarity, that he had the promise of grace. In Ishmael there was nothing besides nature; in Isaac there was the election of God, signified in part by the manner of his birth, which was not in the ordinary course, but miraculous. 		Yet there is an indirect reference to the calling of the Gentiles, and the rejection of the Jews: for the latter boast of their ancestry, while the former, without any human interference, are become the spiritual offspring of Abraham.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.vi.iv-p29"></a><a name="iii.vi.iv-p29.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p30"></a><b>24.</b> <i>These are the two covenants</i>. I have thought it better to adopt this translation, in order not to lose sight of the beauty of the comparison; for Paul compares the two διαθὢκαι, to two mothers, and to employ <i>testamentum</i>, (a testament,) which is 		a neuter noun, for denoting a mother, would be harsh. The word<i> pactio</i> (a covenant) appears to be, on that account, more appropriate; and indeed the desire of obtaining perspicuity, as well as elegance, has led me to make this choice.   		 <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">76</font></a>
 </p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p32"></a>The comparison is now formally introduced. As in the house of Abraham there were two mothers, so are there also in the Church of God. Doctrine is the mother of whom we are born, and is twofold, Legal and Evangelical. The legal mother, whom Hagar resembles,<i> gendereth to bondage</i>. Sarah again, represents the second, which gendereth to freedom; though Paul begins higher, and 		makes our first mother Sinai, and our second, Jerusalem. The two covenants, then, are the mothers, of whom children unlike one another are born; for the legal covenant makes slaves, and the evangelical covenant makes freemen.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p33"></a>But all this may, at first sight, appear absurd; for there are none of God’s children who are not born to freedom, and therefore the comparison does not apply. I answer, what Paul says is true in two respects; for the law formerly brought forth its disciples, (among whom were included the holy prophets, and other believers,) to slavery, though not to permanent slavery, but because God placed them for a time under the law as “a 		schoolmaster.”  		 <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">77</font></a>
  		(<a name="iii.vi.iv-p34.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#025">Ga 3:25</a><a name="iii.vi.iv-p34.2"></a>.) Under the vail of ceremonies, and of the whole economy by which they were governed, their freedom was concealed: to the outward eye nothing but slavery appeared. “Ye have not,” says Paul to the Romans, “received the spirit of bondage again to fear.” (<a name="iii.vi.iv-p34.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015">Ro 8:15</a><a name="iii.vi.iv-p34.3"></a>.) Those holy fathers, though 		inwardly they were free in the sight of God, yet in outward appearance differed nothing from slaves, and thus resembled their mother’s condition. But the doctrine of the gospel bestows upon its children perfect freedom as soon as they are born, and brings them up in a liberal manner.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p35"></a>Paul does not, I acknowledge, speak of that kind of children, as the context will show. By the children of Sinai, it will afterwards be explained, are meant hypocrites, who are at length expelled from the Church of God, and deprived of the inheritance. What, then, is the gendering to bondage, which forms the subject of the present dispute? It denotes those who make a wicked abuse of the law, by finding in it nothing but what tends to 		slavery. Not so the pious fathers, who lived under the Old Testament; for their slavish birth by the law did not hinder them from having Jerusalem for their mother in spirit. But those who adhere to the bare law, and do not acknowledge it to be “a schoolmaster to bring them to Christ,” (<a name="iii.vi.iv-p35.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024">Ga 3:24</a><a name="iii.vi.iv-p35.1"></a>,) but rather make it a hinderance to prevent their coming to him, are the Ishmaelites born to slavery.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p36"></a>It will again be objected, why does the apostle say that such persons are born of God’s covenant, and are considered to belong to the Church? I answer, strictly speaking, they are not God’s children, but are degenerate and spurious, and are disclaimed by God, whom they falsely call their Father. They receive this name in the Church, not because they are members of it in reality, but because for a time they presume to occupy that place, 		and impose on men by the disguise which they wear. The apostle here views the Church, as it appears in this world: but on this subject we shall afterwards speak.</p>

  		 I shall not waste time in refuting the expositions of other writers; for Jerome’s conjecture, that Mount Sinai had two names, is trifling; and the disquisitions of Chrysostom about the agreement of the names are equally unworthy of notice. Sinai is called Hagar,   		 <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">79</font></a>
  		 because it is a type or figure, as the Passover was Christ. The situation of the mountain is mentioned by way of contempt. It lies in Arabia, beyond the limits of the holy land, by which the eternal inheritance was prefigured. The wonder is, that in so familiar a matter they erred so egregiously.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p42"></a><i>And answers, on the other hand.</i> The Vulgate translates it, <i>is joined</i> (conjunctus est) to Jerusalem; and Erasmus makes it, <i>borders on</i> (confinis) Jerusalem; but I have adopted the phrase, <i>on the other hand,</i> (ex adverso,) in order to avoid obscurity. 		For the apostle certainly does not refer to nearness, or relative position, but to resemblance, as respects the present comparison. The word, σύστοιχα, which is translated <i>corresponding to</i>, denotes those things which are so arranged as to have a mutual relation to each other, and a similar word, συατοιχία, when applied to trees and other objects, 		conveys the idea of their following in regular order. Mount Sinai is said (συστοιχεῖν) <i>to correspond to</i> that which is now Jerusalem, in the same sense as Aristotle says that Rhetoric is (ἀντίστροφος) the <i>counterpart</i> to Logic, by a metaphor borrowed from lyric compositions, which were usually 		arranged in two parts, so adapted as to be sung in harmony. In short, the word, συστοιχεῖ, <i>corresponds</i>, means nothing more than that it belongs to the same class.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p43"></a>But why does Paul compare the present Jerusalem with Mount Sinai? Though I was once of a different opinion, yet I agree with Chrysostom and Ambrose, who explain it as referring to the earthly Jerusalem, and who interpret the words, <i>which now is</i>, τὣ νῦν ̔ιερουσαλὴμ, as 		marking the slavish doctrine and worship into which it had degenerated. It ought to have been a lively image of the new Jerusalem, and a representation of its character. But such as it now is, it is rather related to Mount Sinai. Though the two places may be widely distant from each other, they are perfectly alike in all their most important features. This is a heavy reproach against the Jews, whose real mother was not Sarah but the spurious Jerusalem, twin sister of Hagar; who were therefore 		slaves born of a slave, though they haughtily boasted that they were the sons of Abraham.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p47"></a>but by the power of the Holy Spirit. The heavenly Jerusalem, which derives its origin from heaven, and dwells above by faith, is the mother of believers. To the Church, under God, we owe it that we are</p>

But the Papists are fools and twice children, who expect to give us uneasiness by producing these words; for their mother is an adulteress, who brings forth to death the children of the devil; and how foolish is the demand, that the children of God should surrender themselves to her to be cruelly slain! Might not the synagogue of Jerusalem at that time have assumed such haughty 		pretensions, with far higher plausibility than Rome at the present day? and yet we see how Paul strips her of every honorable distinction, and consigns her to the lot of Hagar.</p>  <a name="iii.vi.v"></a>

 <p><a name="iii.vi.v-p14"></a><b>27.</b> <i>For it is written</i>. The apostle proves, by a quotation from Isaiah, that the lawful sons of the Church are born according to the promise. The passage is in <a name="iii.vi.v-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#000">Isa 54</a><a name="iii.vi.v-p14.1"></a> where the prophet speaks of the kingdom of Christ and the calling of 		the Gentiles, and promises to the barren wife and the widow a numerous offspring; for it is on this ground that he exhorts the Church to “sing” and “rejoice.” The design of the apostle, let it be carefully remarked, is to deprive the Jews of all claim to that spiritual Jerusalem to which the prophecy relates. Isaiah proclaims, that her children shall be gathered out of all the nations of the earth, and not by any preparation of hers, but by the free grace and blessing of God.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.v-p15"></a>He next concludes that we become the sons of God by promise, after the example (κατὰ ᾿Ισαὰκ) of Isaac, and that in no other way do we obtain this honor. To readers little skilled or practiced in the examination of Scripture, this reasoning may appear inconclusive; because they do not hold the most undoubted of all 		principles, that all the promises, being founded on the Messiah, are of free grace. It was because the apostle took this for granted, that he so fearlessly contrasted the promise with the law.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.vi.v-p16"></a><a name="iii.vi.v-p16.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.v-p17"></a><b>29.</b> <i>As then, he that was born after the flesh</i>. He denounces the cruelty of the false apostles, who wantonly insulted pious persons that placed all their confidence in Christ. There was abundant need that the uneasiness of the oppressed should be soothed by consolation, and that the cruelty of their oppressors should be severely checked. It is not 		wonderful, he says, that the children of the law, at the present day, do what Ishmael their father at first did, who, trusting to his being the first-born, persecuted Isaac the true heir. With the same proud disdain do his posterity now, on account of outward ceremonies, circumcision, and the various services of the law, molest and vaunt over the lawful sons of God. <i>The Spirit</i> is again contrasted with the flesh, that is, the calling of God with 		human appearance. (<a name="iii.vi.v-p17.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#007">1Sa 16:7</a><a name="iii.vi.v-p17.1"></a>.) So the disguise is admitted to be possessed by the followers of the Law and of works, but the reality is claimed for those who rely on the calling of God alone, and depend upon his grace.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.v-p18"></a><i>Persecuted.</i> But persecution is nowhere mentioned, only Moses says that Ishmael was <a name="iii.vi.v-p18.1"></a>קהצמ, (<i>metzahek,</i>) <i>mocking</i>, (<a name="iii.vi.v-p18.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009">Ge 21:9</a><a name="iii.vi.v-p18.2"></a>;) and by this participle he intimates that Ishmael ridiculed his brother Isaac. The explanation offered by some Jews, that this was a simple smile, is entirely inadmissible; for what cruelty would it have argued, that a harmless smile should have been so fearfully revenged? There cannot then be a doubt that he maliciously endeavored to provoke the child Isaac by reproachful language.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.v-p19"></a>But how widely distant is this from persecution?  		 <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">80</font></a>
  		And yet it is not idly or unguardedly that Paul enlarges on this point. No persecution ought to distress us so much as to see our calling attempted to be undermined by the reproaches of wicked men. Neither blows, nor scourging, nor nails, nor thorns, occasioned to our Lord such intense suffering as that blasphemy:</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.vi.v-p21"></a>“He trusted in God; what availeth it to him?<br> 		for he is deprived of all assistance.” (<a name="iii.vi.v-p21.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#043">Mt 27:43</a><a name="iii.vi.v-p21.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.v-p22"></a>There is more venom in this than in all persecutions; for how much more alarming is it that the grace of Divine adoption shall be made void, than that this frail life shall be taken from us? Ishmael did not persecute his brother with the sword; but, what is worse, he treated him with haughty disdain by trampling under foot the promise of God. All persecutions arise from this source, that wicked men despise and hate in the elect the grace 		of God; a memorable instance of which we have in the history of Cain and Abel. (<a name="iii.vi.v-p22.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#008">Ge 4:8</a><a name="iii.vi.v-p22.1"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.v-p23"></a>This reminds us, that not only ought we to be filled with horror at outward persecutions, when the enemies of religion slay us with fire and sword; when they banish, imprison, torture, or scourge; but when they attempt, by their blasphemies, to make void our confidence, which rests on the promises of God; when they ridicule our salvation, when they wantonly laugh to scorn the whole gospel. Nothing ought to wound our minds so deeply as 		contempt of God, and reproaches cast upon His grace: nor is there any kind of persecution more deadly than when the salvation of the soul is assailed. We who have escaped from the tyranny of the Pope, are not called to encounter the swords of wicked men. But how blind must we be, if we are not affected by that spiritual persecution, in which they strive, by every method, to extinguish that doctrine, from which we draw the breath of life! — when they attack our faith by their blasphemies, and 		shake not a few of the less informed! For my own part, I am far more grieved by the fury of the Epicureans than of the Papists. They do not attack us by open violence; but, in proportion as the name of God is more dear to me than my own life, the diabolical conspiracy which I see in operation to extinguish all fear and worship of God, to root out the remembrance of Christ, or to abandon it to the jeers of the ungodly, cannot but rack my mind with greater anxiety, than if a whole country were 		burning in one conflagration:</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.vi.v-p24"></a><a name="iii.vi.v-p24.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.v-p25"></a><b>30.</b> <i>But what saith the Scripture</i>? There was some consolation in knowing that we do but share the lot of our father Isaac; but it is a still greater consolation, when he adds, that hypocrites, with all their boasting, can gain nothing more than to be <i>cast out</i> of the spiritual family of Abraham; and 		that, to whatever extent they may harass us for a time, the inheritance will certainly be ours. Let believers cheer themselves with this consolation, that the tyranny of the Ishmaelites will not last for ever. They appear to have reached the highest pre-eminence, and, proud of their birthright, look down upon us with contempt; but they will one day be declared to be the descendants of Hagar, the sons of a slave, and unworthy of the inheritance.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.v-p26"></a>Let us be instructed by this beautiful passage,</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.vi.v-p27"></a>“not to fret ourselves because of evil-doers,<br> 		neither be envious against the workers of iniquity,”<br> 		(<a name="iii.vi.v-p27.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001">Ps 37:1</a><a name="iii.vi.v-p27.3"></a>,)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.v-p28"></a>when they hold a temporary habitation and rank in the Church, but patiently to look for the end which awaits them. There are many pretended Christians, or strangers, who hold a place in the Church, but who afterwards give evidence of their departure from the faith, as he who, proud of his birthright, at first reigned, was cast out like a foreigner with the posterity of Ishmael. Some censorious persons smile at Paul’s simplicity, in 		comparing a woman’s passion, arising out of a trifling quarrel, to a judgment of God. But they overlook the decree of God, which took effect in such a manner, as to make it manifest that the whole transaction was directed by a heavenly providence. That Abraham should have been commanded to humor his wife (<a name="iii.vi.v-p28.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012">Ge 21:12</a><a name="iii.vi.v-p28.1"></a>) entirely in the matter, is no doubt extraordinary, but proves that God employed the 		services of Sarah for confirming his own promise. In a word, the <i>casting out</i> of Ishmael was nothing else than the consequence and the accomplishment of that promise, “In Isaac shall thy seed be called,” (<a name="iii.vi.v-p28.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012">Ge 21:12</a><a name="iii.vi.v-p28.2"></a>,) — not in Ishmael. Although, therefore, it was the revenging of a woman’s quarrel, yet God did not the less make known his sentence by her mouth as a type of the Church.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.vi.v-p29"></a><a name="iii.vi.v-p29.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.v-p30"></a><b>31.</b> <i>So then, brethren</i>. He now exhorts the Galatians to prefer the condition of the children of Sarah to that of the children of Hagar; and having reminded them that, by the grace of Christ, they were born to freedom, he desires them to continue in the same condition. If we shall call the Papists, Ishmaelites and Hagarites, and boast that we are 		the lawful children, they will smile at us; but if the two subjects in dispute be fairly compared, the most ignorant person will be at no loss to decide.</p>
