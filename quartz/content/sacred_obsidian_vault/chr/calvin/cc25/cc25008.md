 <p><a name="ix.i-p3"></a><b>1 </b>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon arrived at Jerusalem and besieged it.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p4"></a><b>2 </b>And God delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, and part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar, into the house of his god; and he placed the vessels in the treasure-house of his god.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p5"></a><b>3 </b> Then the king commanded Aspenaz, the chief of the eunuchs, to bring some of the children of Israel, and of the royal seed, and of the nobles,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p6"></a><b>4 </b>Youths in whom there was no blemish, but of beautiful aspect, skilled in all prudence, and understanding knowledge, and capable of expressing their thoughts, and in whom was rigor, that they might stand in the king’s palace and be taught the literature and language of the Chaldees.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p7"></a><b>5 </b>And the king appointed them a daily allotment of the royal food, and of the wine of his own drinking; thus nourishing them for three years, that at the end they should stand before the king.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p8"></a><b>6 </b>Now, among these youths there were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Misael, and Azariah.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p9"></a><b>7 </b>The chief of the eunuchs gave them each names: he called Daniel, Belteshazzar; Hananiah, Shadrach; and Misael, Meshach; and Azariah, Abednego.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p10"></a><b>8 </b>And Daniel determined in his heart not to pollute himself with the portion of the king’s food and drink: and he requested the chief of the eunuchs that he might not thus defile himself.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Now, God had placed Daniel in favor and pity before the chief of the eunuchs.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p12"></a><b>10 </b>And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, — I am afraid of my lord the king, he has appointed your food and drink, for he will observe your faces emaciated when compared with the youths your equals, thus ye will endanger my head with the king.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p13"></a><b>11 </b>Then said Daniel to Meltzar, whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Misael, and Azariah, —</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p14"></a><b>12 </b>Try thy servants for ten days: let nothing but pulse be given us to eat and water to drink.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p15"></a><b>13 </b>Then let our countenances be inspected before thy face, and the countenances of the youths who eat a portion of the royal diet, and deal with thy servants, according to what thou shalt behold.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p16"></a><b>14 </b>So he listened to their advice, and proved them for ten days.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p17"></a><b>15 </b>And at the end of the ten days their countenances appeared plump, and they were fatter than all the other youths who had partaken of the royal diet.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p18"></a><b>16 </b>Then Meltzar removed both their portion of food and of wine, and gave them pulse.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p19"></a><b>17 </b>Thus God gave to these four youths knowledge, and science in all literature, and wisdom; and Daniel received the power of understanding all visions and dreams.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p20"></a><b>18 </b>At the end of the period at which the king commanded them to be brought before him, the chief of the eunuchs introduced them to Nebuchadnezzar.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p21"></a><b>19 </b>Then the king addressed them: and among them all none was like Daniel, Hananiah, Misael, and Azariah, as they stood before the king.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p22"></a><b>20 </b>And in every expression of wisdom and intelligence, in which they were examined by the king, he found them ten times superior to all the soothsayers and astrologers throughout his whole realm.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p23"></a><b>21 </b>And Daniel continued until the first year of king Cyrus.</p>  <a name="ix.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="ix.ii-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Now, in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams: and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep became interrupted.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Then the king commanded them to call together the astrologers and soothsayers, the sorcerers and the Chaldeans, to declare to the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled for understanding the dream,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>And the Chaldeans said to the king in Syriac: O king, live for ever! Tell thy servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, — The matter is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me both the dream and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces and your bones shall become a dunghill:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>But if ye will show the dream and its interpretation, ye shall receive from me large rewards, and gifts, and much honor; therefore declare to me the dream and its interpretation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p9"></a><b>7 </b>They answered a second time and said: Let the king narrate the dream to his servants, and we will declare its interpretation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>The king answered and said: In truth I perceive that ye would gain time, because ye know that the dream has fallen out of your mind,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Besides, if ye will not declare to me the dream, there is but one sentence for you: as ye have prepared a lying and corrupt discourse to relate before me, until the time be changed, wherefore narrate the dream to me, and I shall know your ability to declare its interpretation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p12"></a><b>10 </b>The Chaldeans replied before the king, saying: There is not a man upon earth who can explain the king’s matter; besides, no king, or prince, or prefect ever made such a request to any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p13"></a><b>11 </b>And the subject of the king’s inquiry is precious, and none can explain it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>On this account the king was filled with anger and fury, and ordered the destruction of all the wise men of Babylon.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p15"></a><b>13 </b>Then the edict went forth, and the wise men were slain, and they sought Daniel and his companions for the purpose of slaying them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p16"></a><b>14 </b>Then Daniel inquired concerning the counsel, and the edict of Arioch the captain of the royal guards, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p17"></a><b>15 </b>He announced and said to Arioch, the king’s captain: Wherefore is the decree so urgent from the king’s presence? Then Arioch explained the matter to Daniel.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p18"></a><b>16 </b>Then Daniel entered and asked the king to give him time, and he would bring the interpretation to the king.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p19"></a><b>17 </b>Then Daniel went home, and opened the subject to Hananiah, and Misael, and Azariah, his companions:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p20"></a><b>18 </b>That they might implore mercy from the God of heaven concerning this secret, and that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p21"></a><b>19 </b>Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision by night: then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p22"></a><b>20 </b>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever! Wisdom and might are his:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p23"></a><b>21 </b>It is he who changeth times and seasons: He appoints and removes kings: He gives wisdom to the wise, And knowledge to those who are skilled in science.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p24"></a><b>22 </b>He reveals hidden and secret things, He knows what lies hid in darkness, And light dwells with him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p25"></a><b>23 </b>O God of my fathers, I confess to thee and praise thee: For thou hast given me wisdom and strength: Thou hast now revealed to me what we desired of thee: Thou hast made known to us the king’s request.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p26"></a><b>24 </b>Therefore Daniel went unto Arioch, whom the king had ordered to slay the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: Introduce me to the king, and I will show him the interpretation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p27"></a><b>25 </b>Then Arioch hastily introduced Daniel to the king, and said thus to him: I have found a man among the sons of the captivity of Judah, who will make known the interpretation to the king.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p28"></a><b>26 </b>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to tell me the dream which I saw, as well as its interpretation?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p29"></a><b>27 </b>Daniel answered the king by saying: The wise men and the magi, the astrologers and sorcerers, cannot declare to the king what he demands;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p30"></a><b>28 </b>But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets: He has declared to King Nebuchadnezzar the events of the latter days: This is thy dream, this is the vision of thy head upon thy couch.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p31"></a><b>29 </b>Thy thoughts, O king, came up to thee upon thy bed, as to what shall be hereafter: He who reveals secrets has explained the future to thee.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p32"></a><b>30 </b>And as to me, this secret was not revealed to me through my superiority in wisdom over other living men, but that I should explain the interpretation to the king, and that thou shouldst know the thoughts of thy heart.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p33"></a><b>31 </b>Thou, O king, wast looking, and beheld a great image! This great image and its excellent splendor stood before thee, And its form was terrible.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p34"></a><b>32 </b>The head of this image was of pure gold: Its breast and its arms were of silver: Its belly and thighs of brass.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p35"></a><b>33 </b>Its legs of iron: Its feet partly of iron and partly of clay:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p36"></a><b>34 </b>Thou wast looking until a stone was cut out without human hand, It struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p37"></a><b>35 </b>Then the iron and the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, were broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer thrashing-floor; and the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them: and the stone which struck the image became a great mountains and filled the whole earth.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p38"></a><b>36 </b>This is the dream; and we will declare its interpretation before the king.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p39"></a><b>37 </b>Thou, O king, art a king of kings: For the God of heaven has given to thee a kingdom of power, and strength, and glory.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p40"></a><b>38 </b>And wherever the dwelling—place of the children of men, of the beasts of the field, and of the fowls of heaven exists, He hath given it into thine handy and hath made thee ruler over all, Thou art this head of gold.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p41"></a><b>39 </b>And after this shall arise another kingdom inferior to them, And another of brass — a third kingdom shall succeed, And it shall bear sway over all the earth.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p42"></a><b>40 </b>Then a fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: For as iron breaks all things in pieces and reduces them to atoms, And as iron bruises all these things, So shall this empire bruise and brake to pieces.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p43"></a><b>41 </b>And whereas thou didst behold the feet and the toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron: The kingdom shall be divided: the strength of iron shall be in it: Because thou sawest iron mingled with the moistened clay.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p44"></a><b>42 </b>And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay; So that kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p45"></a><b>43 </b>And whereas thou didst behold iron mixed with testaceous clay, So they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: But they shall not adhere to one another, as iron will not mingle with clay.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p46"></a><b>44 </b>And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: And this kingdom shall not be left to any other people, But it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, And it shall stand for ever.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p47"></a><b>45 </b>Besides this thou didst behold the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, which broke the iron, brass, clay, silver, and gold. The great God has made known the coming events of futurity: The dream is true, and the interpretation of it is correct.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p48"></a><b>46 </b>Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped Daniel; and commanded men to offer to him a sacrifice and a sweet-smelling fragrance.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p49"></a><b>47 </b>The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Truly your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since thou hast been able to reveal this secret.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p50"></a><b>48 </b>Then the king exalted Daniel, and gave him many valuable presents, and appointed him ruler of the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the elders over all the wise men of Babylon.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p51"></a><b>49 </b>Then Daniel made a request of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the administration of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was at the king’s gate.</p>  <a name="ix.iii"></a>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.iii-p1"></a>  		  
 </p><p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref16"><a name="ix.iii-p2"></a>CHAPTER 3</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Nebuchadnezzar the king made a golden image; its height was sixty cubits, its breadth six cubits. He erected it on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Then King: Nebuchadnezzar sent to gather together the princes, the satraps, and the magistrates, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the presidents, and all the governors of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnezzar had erected.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>Then the princes, the senators, and the magistrates, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the presidents, and all the governors of the provinces collected together at the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnezzar had erected. And when they stood before the image which Nebuchadnezzar had erected,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>A herald proclaimed in the midst of the multitude, O people, nations, and languages, to you it is spoken:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>Whenever ye shall hear the sound of the trumpet, harp, pipe, psaltery, sackbut, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye must fall down and worship the golden image which King Nebuchadnezzar has erected.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>And whosoever shall not bend the knee and adore, shall be instantly cast into the midst of a furnace of burning fire.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Therefore at the very same hour, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, harp, pipe, psaltery, sackbut, dulcimer, and all musical instruments, all people, languages, and nations, fell down adoring the golden image which King Nebuchadnezzar had erected.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>Wherefore the Chaldeans immediately approached and vociferously accused the Jews.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p11"></a><b>9 </b>They spoke, and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p12"></a><b>10 </b>Thou, O king, hast issued an edict, that as soon as every man shall hear the sound of the trumpet, harp, pipe, psaltery, sackbut, dulcimer, and all musical instruments, he shall fall down and adore the golden image.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p13"></a><b>11 </b>And he who shall not fall down and adore, shall be east into the midst of a furnace of burning fire.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the administration of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: these men have not paid attention to thee, O king: they do not worship thy gods, and they do not adore the image which thou hast erected.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p15"></a><b>13 </b>Then Nebuchadnezzar, with rage and fury, commanded Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to be brought before him: then those men (the Chaldeans) brought them up before the king.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p16"></a><b>14 </b>Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said to them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that ye do not worship my gods, nor yet adore the image which I have erected?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p17"></a><b>15 </b>Now, are ye prepared, as soon as ye shall hear the sound of the trumpet, harp, pipe, psaltery, sackbut, dulcimer, and all musical instruments, to fall down and adore the image which I have made? For if ye will not adore it, ye shall be east the stone hour into the midst of a furnace of burning fire: and who is that God who shall deliver you from my hand?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p18"></a><b>16 </b>Shadrach, Meshaeh, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, we are not anxious about our reply to thee concerning this matter.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p19"></a><b>17 </b>Behold! our God whom we worship is powerful. He can free us from the furnace of burning fire, and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p20"></a><b>18 </b>But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not worship thy gods, and we will not adore the golden image which thou hast erected.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p21"></a><b>19 </b>Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and the figure of his face was changed towards Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: he spoke and commanded the furnace to be heated seven times more than it was usual to heat it.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p22"></a><b>20 </b>And he commanded the very strongest of his attendants to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to east them into the furnace of burning fire.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p23"></a><b>21 </b>Then those men were bound in their mantles, and turbans, and garments, and were east into the furnace of burning fire.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p24"></a><b>22 </b>Because the king’s order was urgent, and he had commanded the furnace to be made so exceedingly hot, the extremity of the flame slew the men who had taken up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p25"></a><b>23 </b>And those three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound in the midst of the furnace of burning fire.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p26"></a><b>24 </b>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was terrified, and rose in haste, and spoke, and said to his counselors, Did we not cast these men bound into the furnace? They answered <i>and </i>said to the king, True, O king!</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p27"></a><b>25 </b>He answered and said, But I see four men loose, walking in the fire, and they have no hurt: and the aspect of the fourth is like the Son of a God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p28"></a><b>26 </b>Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the furnace of burning fire; he spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the most High God, come forth and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the midst of the fire.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p29"></a><b>27 </b>Then the satraps, generals, prefects, and counselors of the king assembled to behold those men, over whose body the fire had no power, and a hair of their head was not burnt, neither were their garments changed, nor had the smell of fire passed over them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p30"></a><b>28 </b>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and preserved his servants, who have trusted in him and changed the king’s edict, and delivered up their bodies, that they might neither worship nor adorn any god except their own God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p31"></a><b>29 </b>Hence I issue a decree, that any nation, people, and tongue, which shall utter a perverse speech against the God of these men, namely, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and his house shall be reduced to a dungheap: because there is no other God who can deliver after this method.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p32"></a><b>30 </b>Then the king rendered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego prosperous in the province of Babylon.</p>  <a name="ix.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="ix.viii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>I saw the ram butting westward, and northward, and southward; No beasts could stand before him: No one could snatch anything from his hand: Thus he did according to his pleasure, and magnified himself.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.viii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>And I was attentive, and behold! A he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, And yet he never touched the ground: The goat, too, had a remarkable horn between its eyes.</p>

 <p><a name="ix.xi-p37"></a><b>35 </b>Also some of those who have understanding shall fall, to prove, and purge, and whiten them even for a definite time, since it is still for an appointed time.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xi-p38"></a><b>36 </b>And the king shall act according to his will, and shall raise himself, and magnify himself above every deity, and against the God of gods shall he speak wonderful things; He shall prosper also unto the consummation of the anger, Since the decision has been made.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xi-p39"></a><b>37 </b>He shall not attend to either the God of his fathers, nor to the desire of women: He shall not attend to any deity, for he shall magnify himself above them all.</p>

 <p><a name="ix.xii-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Moreover, at that time shall Michael the mighty prince stand up, standing for the sons of thy people; And there shall be a time of affliction, such as was not from the existence of nations until that period. Yet at this period thy people shall escape, every one who shall be found written in the book.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>And many of those who sleep, and have been reduced to earth and dust, shall awake; some to perpetual life, and others to shame and continued abomination.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>Then the wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; And those who have turned many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>And thou, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal up the book, till the time appointed. Many shall investigate, and knowledge shall be increased.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>Then I Daniel was gazing, and behold two others standing, One on this side, and the other on that of the river’s bank.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>And one of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long will it be to the end of these wonders?”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xii-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Then I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river; He raised his right hand and his left towards the heavens, and swore by him who liveth for ever, That it should be for the appointed time, times, and half a time; And at the completion of the dispersion of the holy people, All these things shall be accomplished.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>Then I heard, but I did not understand; and I said, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these events?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xii-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Then he said, Depart, Daniel, because the words are closed and sealed up to the time appointed.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xii-p12"></a><b>10 </b>Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; Yet the impious shall act impiously: And the impious will not understand, but the prudent will understand.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xii-p13"></a><b>11 </b>From the time of taking away the continual sacrifice, to the setting up of the desolating abomination, shall be 1290 days.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>Blessed is he who shall have waited, and shall have arrived at the 1335 days.</p>
