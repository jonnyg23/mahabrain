 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Paradise Lost and Regained</i>, by John Milton, [1667 and 1671], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h1 align="center">PARADISE REGAINED</h1>  <h3 align="center">The Third Book</h3>  
 <p>So spake the Son of God; and Satan stood<br> A while as mute, confounded what to say,<br> What to reply, confuted and convinced<br> Of his weak arguing and fallacious drift;<br> At length, collecting all his serpent wiles,<br> With soothing words renewed, him thus accosts:—</p>  
 <p>"I see thou know'st what is of use to know,<br> What best to say canst say, to do canst do;<br> Thy actions to thy words accord; thy words<br> To thy large heart give utterance due; thy heart<br> Contains of good, wise, just, the perfet shape.<br> Should kings and nations from thy mouth consult,<br> Thy counsel would be as the oracle<br> Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems<br> On Aaron's breast, or tongue of Seers old<br> Infallible; or, wert thou sought to deeds<br> That might require the array of war, thy skill<br> Of conduct would be such that all the world<br> Could not sustain thy prowess, or subsist<br> In battle, though against thy few in arms.<br> These godlike virtues wherefore dost thou<br> Affecting private life, or more obscure<br> In savage wilderness, wherefore deprive<br> All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thyself<br> The fame and glory-glory, the reward<br> That sole excites to high attempts the flame<br> Of most erected spirits, most tempered pure<br> Aethereal, who all pleasures else despise,<br> All treasures and all gain esteem as dross,<br> And dignities and powers, all but the highest?<br> Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe. The son<br> Of Macedonian Philip had ere these<br> Won Asia, and the throne of Cyrus held<br> At his dispose; young Scipio had brought down<br> The Carthaginian pride; young Pompey quelled<br> The Pontic king, and in triumph' had rode.<br> Yet years, and to ripe years judgment mature,<br> Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment.<br> Great Julius, whom now all the world admires,<br> The more he grew in years, the more inflamed<br> With glory, wept that he had lived so long<br> Inglorious. But thou yet art not too late."</p>  
 <p>To whom our Saviour calmly thus replied:—<br> "Thou neither dost persuade me to seek wealth<br> For empire's sake, nor empire to affect<br> For glory's sake, by all thy argument.<br> For what is glory but the blaze of fame,<br> The people's praise, if always praise unmixed?<br> And what the people but a herd confused,<br> A miscellaneous rabble, who extol<br> Things vulgar, and, well weighed, scarce worth the praise?<br> They praise and they admire they know not what,<br> And know not whom, but as one leads the other;<br> And what delight to be by such extolled,<br> To live upon their tongues, and be their talk?<br> Of whom to be dispraised were no small praise—<br> His lot who dares be singularly good.<br> The intelligent among them and the wise<br> Are few, and glory scarce of few is raised.<br> This is true glory and renown-when God,<br> Looking on the Earth, with approbation marks<br> The just man, and divulges him through Heaven<br> To all his Angels, who with true applause<br> Recount his praises. Thus he did to Job,<br> When, to extend his fame through Heaven and Earth,<br> As thou to thy reproach may'st well remember,<br> He asked thee, 'Hast thou seen my servant Job?'<br> Famous he was in Heaven; on Earth less known,<br> Where glory is false glory, attributed<br> To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame.<br> They err who count it glorious to subdue<br> By conquest far and wide, to overrun<br> Large countries, and in field great battles win,<br> Great cities by assault. What do these worthies<br> But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave<br> Peaceable nations, neighbouring or remote,<br> Made captive, yet deserving freedom more<br> Than those their conquerors, who leave behind<br> Nothing but ruin wheresoe'er they rove,<br> And all the flourishing works of peace destroy;<br> Then swell with pride, and must be titled Gods,<br> Great Benefactors of mankind, Deliverers,<br> Worshipped with temple, priest, and sacrifice?<br> One is the son of Jove, of Mars the other;<br> Till conqueror Death discover them scarce men,<br> Rowling in brutish vices, and deformed,<br> Violent or shameful death their due reward.<br> But, if there be in glory aught of good;<br> It may by means far different be attained,<br> Without ambition, war, or violence—<br> By deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent,<br> By patience, temperance. I mention still<br> Him whom thy wrongs, with saintly patience borne,<br> Made famous in a land and times obscure;<br> Who names not now with honour patient Job?<br> Poor Socrates, (who next more memorable?)<br> By what he taught and suffered for so doing,<br> For truth's sake suffering death unjust, lives now<br> Equal in fame to proudest conquerors.<br> Yet, if for fame and glory aught be done,<br> Aught suffered-if young African for fame<br> His wasted country freed from Punic rage—<br> The deed becomes unpraised, the man at least,<br> And loses, though but verbal, his reward.<br> Shall I seek glory, then, as vain men seek,<br> Oft not deserved? I seek not mine, but His<br> Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am."<br> To whom the Tempter, murmuring, thus replied:<br> "Think not so slight of glory, therein least<br> Resembling thy great Father. He seeks glory,<br> And for his glory all things made, all things<br> Orders and governs; nor content in Heaven,<br> By all his Angels glorified, requires<br> Glory from men, from all men, good or bad,<br> Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption.<br> Above all sacrifice, or hallowed gift,<br> Glory he requires, and glory he receives,<br> Promiscuous from all nations, Jew, or Greek,<br> Or Barbarous, nor exception hath declared;<br> From us, his foes pronounced, glory he exacts."</p>  
 <p>To whom our Saviour fervently replied:<br> "And reason; since his Word all things produced,<br> Though chiefly not for glory as prime end,<br> But to shew forth his goodness, and impart<br> His good communicable to every soul<br> Freely; of whom what could He less expect<br> Than glory and benediction-that is, thanks—<br> The slightest, easiest, readiest recompense<br> From them who could return him nothing else,<br> And, not returning that, would likeliest render<br> Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy?<br> Hard recompense, unsuitable return<br> For so much good, so much beneficence!<br> But why should man seek glory, who of his own<br> Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs<br> But condemnation, ignominy, and shame—<br> Who, for so many benefits received,<br> Turned recreant to God, ingrate and false,<br> And so of all true good himself despoiled;<br> Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take<br> That which to God alone of right belongs?<br> Yet so much bounty is in God, such grace,<br> That who advance his glory, not their own,<br> Them he himself to glory will advance."</p>  
 <p>So spake the Son of God; and here again<br> Satan had not to answer, but stood struck<br> With guilt of his own sin-for he himself,<br> Insatiable of glory, had lost all;<br> Yet of another plea bethought him soon:—</p>  
 <p>"Of glory, as thou wilt," said he, "so deem;<br> Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass.<br> But to a Kingdom thou art born-ordained<br> To sit upon thy father David's throne,<br> By mother's side thy father, though thy right<br> Be now in powerful hands, that will not part<br> Easily from possession won with arms.<br> Judaea now and all the Promised Land,<br> Reduced a province under Roman yoke,<br> Obeys Tiberius, nor is always ruled<br> With temperate sway: oft have they violated<br> The Temple, oft the Law, with foul affronts,<br> Abominations rather, as did once<br> Antiochus. And think'st thou to regain<br> Thy right by sitting still, or thus retiring?<br> So did not Machabeus. He indeed<br> Retired unto the Desert, but with arms;<br> And o'er a mighty king so oft prevailed<br> That by strong hand his family obtained,<br> Though priests, the crown, and David's throne usurped,<br> With Modin and her suburbs once content.<br> If kingdom move thee not, let move thee zeal<br> And duty-zeal and duty are not slow,<br> But on Occasion's forelock watchful wait:<br> They themselves rather are occasion best—<br> Zeal of thy Father's house, duty to free<br> Thy country from her heathen servitude.<br> So shalt thou best fulfil, best verify,<br> The Prophets old, who sung thy endless reign—<br> The happier reign the sooner it begins.<br> Reign then; what canst thou better do the while?"</p>  
 <p>To whom our Saviour answer thus returned:—<br> "All things are best fulfilled in their due time;<br> And time there is for all things, Truth hath said.<br> If of my reign Prophetic Writ hath told<br> That it shall never end, so, when begin<br> The Father in his purpose hath decreed—<br> He in whose hand all times and seasons rowl.<br> What if he hath decreed that I shall first<br> Be tried in humble state, and things adverse,<br> By tribulations, injuries, insults,<br> Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence,<br> Suffering, abstaining, quietly expecting<br> Without distrust or doubt, that He may know<br> What I can suffer, how obey? Who best<br> Can suffer best can do, best reign who first<br> Well hath obeyed-just trial ere I merit<br> My exaltation without change or end.<br> But what concerns it thee when I begin<br> My everlasting Kingdom? Why art thou<br> Solicitous? What moves thy inquisition?<br> Know'st thou not that my rising is thy fall,<br> And my promotion will be thy destruction?"</p>  
 <p>To whom the Tempter, inly racked, replied:—<br> "Let that come when it comes. All hope is lost<br> Of my reception into grace; what worse?<br> For where no hope is left is left no fear.<br> If there be worse, the expectation more<br> Of worse torments me than the feeling can.<br> I would be at the worst; worst is my port,<br> My harbour, and my ultimate repose,<br> The end I would attain, my final good.<br> My error was my error, and my crime<br> My crime; whatever, for itself condemned,<br> And will alike be punished, whether thou<br> Reign or reign not-though to that gentle brow<br> Willingly I could fly, and hope thy reign,<br> From that placid aspect and meek regard,<br> Rather than aggravate my evil state,<br> Would stand between me and thy Father's ire<br> (Whose ire I dread more than the fire of Hell)<br> A shelter and a kind of shading cool<br> Interposition, as a summer's cloud.<br> If I, then, to the worst that can be haste,<br> Why move thy feet so slow to what is best?<br> Happiest, both to thyself and all the world,<br> That thou, who worthiest art, shouldst be their King!<br> Perhaps thou linger'st in deep thoughts detained<br> Of the enterprise so hazardous and high!<br> No wonder; for, though in thee be united<br> What of perfection can in Man be found,<br> Or human nature can receive, consider<br> Thy life hath yet been private, most part spent<br> At home, scarce viewed the Galilean towns,<br> And once a year Jerusalem, few days'<br> Short sojourn; and what thence couldst thou observe?<br> The world thou hast not seen, much less her glory,<br> Empires, and monarchs, and their radiant courts—<br> Best school of best experience, quickest in sight<br> In all things that to greatest actions lead.<br> The wisest, unexperienced, will be ever<br> Timorous, and loth, with novice modesty<br> (As he who, seeking asses, found a kingdom)<br> Irresolute, unhardy, unadventurous.<br> But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit<br> Those rudiments, and see before thine eyes<br> The monarchies of the Earth, their pomp and state—<br> Sufficient introduction to inform<br> Thee, of thyself so apt, in regal arts,<br> And regal mysteries; that thou may'st know<br> How best their opposition to withstand."</p>  
 <p>With that (such power was given him then), he took<br> The Son of God up to a mountain high.<br> It was a mountain at whose verdant feet<br> A spacious plain outstretched in circuit wide<br> Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers flowed,<br> The one winding, the other straight, and left between<br> Fair champaign, with less rivers intervened,<br> Then meeting joined their tribute to the sea.<br> Fertile of corn the glebe, of oil, and wine;<br> With herds the pasture thronged, with flocks the hills;<br> Huge cities and high-towered, that well might seem<br> The seats of mightiest monarchs; and so large<br> The prospect was that here and there was room<br> For barren desert, fountainless and dry.<br> To this high mountain-top the Tempter brought<br> Our Saviour, and new train of words began:—</p>  
 <p>"Well have we speeded, and o'er hill and dale,<br> Forest, and field, and flood, temples and towers,<br> Cut shorter many a league. Here thou behold'st<br> Assyria, and her empire's ancient bounds,<br> Araxes and the Caspian lake; thence on<br> As far as Indus east, Euphrates west,<br> And oft beyond; to south the Persian bay,<br> And, inaccessible, the Arabian drouth:<br> Here, Nineveh, of length within her wall<br> Several days' journey, built by Ninus old,<br> Of that first golden monarchy the seat,<br> And seat of Salmanassar, whose success<br> Israel in long captivity still mourns;<br> There Babylon, the wonder of all tongues,<br> As ancient, but rebuilt by him who twice<br> Judah and all thy father David's house<br> Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste,<br> Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis,<br> His city, there thou seest, and Bactra there;<br> Ecbatana her structure vast there shews,<br> And Hecatompylos her hundred gates;<br> There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream,<br> The drink of none but kings; of later fame,<br> Built by Emathian or by Parthian hands,<br> The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there<br> Artaxata, Teredon, Ctesiphon,<br> Turning with easy eye, thou may'st behold.<br> All these the Parthian (now some ages past<br> By great Arsaces led, who founded first<br> That empire) under his dominion holds,<br> From the luxurious kings of Antioch won.<br> And just in time thou com'st to have a view<br> Of his great power; for now the Parthian king<br> In Ctesiphon hath gathered all his host<br> Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild<br> Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid<br> He marches now in haste. See, though from far,<br> His thousands, in what martial equipage<br> They issue forth, steel bows and shafts their arms,<br> Of equal dread in flight or in pursuit—<br> All horsemen, in which flight they must excel;<br> See how in warlike muster they appear,<br> In rhombs, and wedges, and half-moons, and wings."</p>  
 <p>He looked, and saw what numbers numberless<br> The city gates outpoured, light-armed troops<br> In coats of mail and military pride.<br> In mail their horses clad, yet fleet and strong,<br> Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice<br> Of many provinces from bound to bound—<br> From Arachosia, from Candaor east,<br> And Margiana, to the Hyrcanian cliffs<br> Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales;<br> From Atropatia, and the neighbouring plains<br> Of Adiabene, Media, and the south<br> Of Susiana, to Balsara's haven.<br> He saw them in their forms of battle ranged,<br> How quick they wheeled, and flying behind them shot<br> Sharp sleet of arrowy showers against the face<br> Of their pursuers, and overcame by flight;<br> The field all iron cast a gleaming brown.<br> Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor, on each horn,<br> Cuirassiers all in steel for standing flight,<br> Chariots, or elephants indorsed with towers<br> Of archers; nor of labouring pioners<br> A multitude, with spades and axes armed,<br> To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill,<br> Or where plain was raise hill, or overlay<br> With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke:<br> Mules after these, camels and dromedaries,<br> And waggons fraught with utensils of war.<br> Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp,<br> When Agrican, with all his northern powers,<br> Besieged Albracca, as romances tell,<br> The city of Gallaphrone, from thence to win<br> The fairest of her sex, Angelica,<br> His daughter, sought by many prowest knights,<br> Both Paynim and the peers of Charlemane.<br> Such and so numerous was their chivalry;<br> At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presumed,<br> And to our Saviour thus his words renewed:—</p>  
 <p>"That thou may'st know I seek not to engage<br> Thy virtue, and not every way secure<br> On no slight grounds thy safety, hear and mark<br> To what end I have brought thee hither, and shew<br> All this fair sight. Thy kingdom, though foretold<br> By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou<br> Endeavour, as thy father David did,<br> Thou never shalt obtain: prediction still<br> In all things, and all men, supposes means;<br> Without means used, what it predicts revokes.<br> But say thou wert possessed of David's throne<br> By free consent of all, none opposite,<br> Samaritan or Jew; how couldst thou hope<br> Long to enjoy it quiet and secure<br> Between two such enclosing enemies,<br> Roman and Parthian? Therefore one of these<br> Thou must make sure thy own: the Parthian first,<br> By my advice, as nearer, and of late<br> Found able by invasion to annoy<br> Thy country, and captive lead away her kings,<br> Antigonus and old Hyrcanus, bound,<br> Maugre the Roman. It shall be my task<br> To render thee the Parthian at dispose,<br> Choose which thou wilt, by conquest or by league.<br> By him thou shalt regain, without him not,<br> That which alone can truly reinstall thee<br> In David's royal seat, his true successor—<br> Deliverance of thy brethren, those Ten Tribes<br> Whose offspring in his territory yet serve<br> In Habor, and among the Medes dispersed:<br> Ten sons of Jacob, two of Joseph, lost<br> Thus long from Israel, serving, as of old<br> Their fathers in the land of Egypt served,<br> This offer sets before thee to deliver.<br> These if from servitude thou shalt restore<br> To their inheritance, then, nor till then,<br> Thou on the throne of David in full glory,<br> From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond,<br> Shalt reign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear."</p>  
 <p>To whom our Saviour answered thus, unmoved:—<br> "Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm<br> And fragile arms, much instrument of war,<br> Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought,<br> Before mine eyes thou hast set, and in my ear<br> Vented much policy, and projects deep<br> Of enemies, of aids, battles,and leagues,<br> Plausible to the world, to me worth naught.<br> Means I must use, thou say'st; prediction else<br> Will unpredict, and fail me of the throne!<br> My time, I told thee (and that time for thee<br> Were better farthest off), is not yet come.<br> When that comes, think not thou to find me slack<br> On my part aught endeavouring, or to need<br> Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome<br> Luggage of war there shewn me-argument<br> Of human weakness rather than of strength.<br> My brethren, as thou call'st them, those Ten Tribes,<br> I must deliver, if I mean to reign<br> David's true heir, and his full sceptre sway<br> To just extent over all Israel's sons!<br> But whence to thee this zeal? Where was it then<br> For Israel, or for David, or his throne,<br> When thou stood'st up his tempter to the pride<br> Of numbering Israel-which cost the lives<br> Of threescore and ten thousand Israelites<br> By three days' pestilence? Such was thy zeal<br> To Israel then, the same that now to me.<br> As for those captive tribes, themselves were they<br> Who wrought their own captivity, fell off<br> From God to worship calves, the deities<br> Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth,<br> And all the idolatries of heathen round,<br> Besides their other worse than heathenish crimes;<br> Nor in the land of their captivity<br> Humbled themselves, or penitent besought<br> The God of their forefathers, but so died<br> Impenitent, and left a race behind<br> Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce<br> From Gentiles, but by circumcision vain,<br> And God with idols in their worship joined.<br> Should I of these the liberty regard,<br> Who, freed, as to their ancient patrimony,<br> Unhumbled, unrepentant, unreformed,<br> Headlong would follow, and to their gods perhaps<br> Of Bethel and of Dan? No; let them serve<br> Their enemies who serve idols with God.<br> Yet He at length, time to himself best known,<br> Remembering Abraham, by some wondrous call<br> May bring them back, repentant and sincere,<br> And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood,<br> While to their native land with joy they haste,<br> As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft,<br> When to the Promised Land their fathers passed.<br> To his due time and providence I leave them."</p>  
 <p>So spake Israel's true King, and to the Fiend<br> Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles.<br> So fares it when with truth falsehood contends.</p>
