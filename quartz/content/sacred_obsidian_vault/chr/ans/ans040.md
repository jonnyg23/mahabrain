 <p><a name="v.VII-p1"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="v.VII-p2"></a>In what way all other beings exist through this Nature and derive existence from it.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.VII-p3"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="v.VII-p4"></a>THERE now remains the discussion of that whole class of beings that exist through another, as to how they exist through the supreme Substance, whether because this Substance created them all, or because it was the material of all. For, there is no need to inquire whether all exist through it, for this reason, namely, that there being another creative agent, or another existing material, this supreme Substance has merely aided in bringing about the existence of all 			 things: since it is inconsistent with what has already been shown, that whatever things are should exist secondarily, and not primarily, through it.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.VII-p5"></a>First, then, it seems to me, we ought to inquire <a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a> <a name="v.VII-Page_49"></a>whether that whole class of beings which exist through another derive existence from any material. But I do not doubt that all this solid world, with its parts, just as we see, consists of earth, water, fire, and air. These four elements, of course, can be conceived of without these forms which we see in actual objects, so that their formless, or even confused, nature appears to be the material of all bodies, 			 distinguished by their own forms. ‑‑ I say that I do not doubt this. But I ask, whence this very material that I have mentioned, the material of the mundane mass, derives its existence. For, if there is some material of this material, then that is more truly the material of the physical universe.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.VII-p6"></a>If, then, the universe of things, whether visible or invisible, derives existence from any material, certainly it not only cannot be, but it cannot even be supposed to be, from any other material than from the supreme Nature or from itself, or from some third being ‑‑ but this last, at any rate, does not exist. For, indeed, nothing is even conceivable except that highest of all beings, which exists through itself, and the universe of beings which exist, not 			 through themselves, but through this supreme Being. Hence, that which has no existence at all is not the material of anything.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.VII-p7"></a>From its own nature the universe cannot derive existence, since, if this were the case, it would in some sort exist through itself and so through another than that through which all things exist. But all these suppositions are false.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.VII-p8"></a>Again, everything that derives existence from material derives existence from another, and exists later than that other. Therefore, since nothing is other <a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a> <a name="v.VII-Page_50"></a>than itself, or later than itself, it follows that nothing derives material existence from itself.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.VII-p9"></a>But if, from the material of the supreme Nature itself, any lesser being can derive existence, the supreme good is subject to change and corruption. But this it is impious to suppose. Hence, since everything that is other than this supreme Nature is less than it, it is impossible that anything other than it in this way derives existence from it.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.VII-p10"></a>Furthermore: doubtless that is in no wise good, through which the supreme good is subjected to change or corruption. But, if any lesser nature derives existence from the material of the supreme good, inasmuch as nothing exists whencesoever, except through the supreme Being, the supreme good is subjected to change and corruption through the supreme Being itself. Hence, the supreme Being, which is itself the supreme good, is by no means good; which is a contradiction. 			 There is, therefore, no lesser nature which derives existence in a material way from the supreme Nature.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.VII-p11"></a>Since, then, it is evident that the essence of those things which exist through another does not derive existence as if materially, from the supreme Essence, nor from itself, nor from another, it is manifest that it derives existence from no material. Hence, seeing that whatever is exists through the supreme Being, nor can aught else exist through this Being, except by its creation, or by its existence as material, it follows, necessarily, that nothing besides it 			 exists, except by its creation. And, since nothing else is or has been, except that supreme Being and the beings created by it, it could create nothing at all through any other instrument or aid than itself. But all that <a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a> <a name="v.VII-Page_51"></a>it has created, it has doubtless created either from something, as from material, or from nothing.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.VII-p12"></a>Since, then, it is most patent that the essence of all beings, except the supreme Essence, was created by that supreme Essence, and derives existence from no material, doubtless nothing can be more clear than that this supreme Essence nevertheless produced from nothing, alone and through itself, the world of material things, so numerous a multitude, formed in such beauty, varied in such order, so fitly diversified.</p>
