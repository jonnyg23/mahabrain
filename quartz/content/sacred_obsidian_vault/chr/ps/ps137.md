 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Salome is in doubt.</font></span>And when |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>342</b>.</font></span> the Saviour had said this, Salome started forward and said: "My Lord, if our parents are the rulers, how standeth it written in the Law of Moses: 'He who shall abandon his father and his mother, let him die the death'? Hath not thus the Law made statement thereon?"</p>  
 <p>And when Salome had said this, the light-power in Mary Magdalene bubbled up in her and she said to the Saviour: "My Lord, give commandment unto me that I discourse with my sister Salome to tell her the solution of the word which she hath spoken."</p>  
 <p>It came to pass then, when the Saviour had heard Mary say these words, that he called her most exceedingly blessed. The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "I give commandment unto thee, Mary, that thou speak the solution of the word which Salome hath spoken."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Mary removeth the doubt of Salome.</font></span>And when the Saviour had said this, Mary started forward to Salome, embraced her and said unto her: "My sister Salome, concerning the word which thou hast spoken: It standeth written in the Law of Moses: 'He who shall abandon his father and his mother, let him die the death,'--now, therefore, my sister Salome,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="green">p. 283</font></a></p>  
 <p>the Law hath not said this concerning the soul nor concerning the body nor concerning the counterfeiting spirit, for all these are sons |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>343</b>.</font></span> of the rulers and are out of them. But the Law hath said this concerning the power which hath came forth out of the Saviour, and which is the light-man within us to-day. The Law hath moreover said: Every one who shall remain without the Saviour and all his mysteries, his parents, will not only die the death but go to ruin in destruction."</p>  
 <p>When then Mary had said this, Salome started forward to Mary and embraced her anew. Salome said: "The Saviour hath power to make me understanding like thyself."</p>  
 <p>It came to pass, when the Saviour had heard the words of Mary, that he called her most exceedingly blessed. The Saviour answered and said unto Mary in the midst of his disciples: "Hearken, therefore, Mary, who it is who compelleth the man until he sinneth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the charge given to the counterfeiting spirit.</font></span>"Now, therefore, the rulers seal the counterfeiting spirit to the soul, [but] so that it doth not agitate it every hour, making it do all sins and all iniquities. And they give commandment moreover unto the counterfeiting spirit, saying: 'If the soul cometh out of the body, do not agitate it, being assigned to it and transferring it to all the regions of the judgments, region by region, on account of all the sins which thou hast made it do, in order that it may be chastized in all the regions of the judgments, so that it may not be able to go |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>344</b>.</font></span> on high to the Light and return into changes of the body.'</p>  
 <p>"In a word, they give commandment to the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="green">p. 284</font></a></p>  
 <p>counterfeiting spirit, saying: 'Do not agitate it at all at any hour unless it doth not speak mysteries and undo all the seals and all the bonds with which we have bound thee to it. [But] if it sayeth the mysteries and undoeth all the seals and all the bonds and [sayeth] the apology of the region, and if it cometh, then let it go forth, for it belongeth to those of the Light of the Height and hath become a stranger unto us and unto thee, and thou wilt not be able to seize it from this hour onwards. If on the contrary it sayeth not the mysteries of the undoing of thy bonds and of thy seals and of the apologies of the region, then seize it and let it not out; thou shalt transfer it to the chastisements and all the regions of the judgments on account of all the sins which thou hast made it do. After this lead [such souls] before the Virgin of Light, who sendeth them once more into the circuit.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the charge given to the servitors.</font></span>"The rulers of the great Fate of the æons hand these over to the counterfeiting spirit; and the rulers summon the servitors of their æons, to the number of three-hundred-and-sixty-and-five, and give them the soul and the counterfeiting spirit, which are bound to one another. The counterfeiting spirit is the without of the soul, and the compound of the power is the within of the soul, being within both of them, in order that they may be able to stand, for |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>345</b>.</font></span> it is the power which keepeth the two up-right. And the rulers give commandment to the servitors, saying unto them: This is the type which ye are to put into the body of the matter of the world.' They say unto them indeed: 'Put the compound of the power, the within of the soul, within them</p>  
 <p><a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="green">p. 285</font></a></p>  
 <p>all, that they may be able to stand, for it is their up-rightness, and after the soul put the counterfeiting spirit.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of conception.</font></span>"Thus they give commandment to their servitors, that they may deposit it into the bodies of the antitype. And following this fashion the servitors of the rulers bring the power and the soul and the counterfeiting spirit, bring them down to the world, and pour [them] out into the world of the rulers of the midst. The rulers of the midst look after the counterfeiting spirit; and also the destiny, whose name is Moira, leadeth the man until it hath him slain through the death appointed unto him, which the rulers of the great Fate have bound to the soul. And the servitors of the sphere bind the soul and the power and the counterfeiting spirit and the destiny. And they portion them all and make them into two portions and seek after the man and also after the woman in the world to whom they have given signs, in order that they may |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>346</b>.</font></span> send them into them. And they give one portion to the man and one portion to the woman in a victual of the world or in a breath of the air or in water or in a kind which they drink.</p>  
 <p>"All this I will tell unto you and the species of every soul and the type, how they enter into the bodies, whether of men or of birds or of cattle or of wild beasts or of reptiles or of all the other species in the world. I will tell you their type, in what type they enter into men; I will tell it you at the expansion of the universe.</p>  
 <p>"Now, therefore, when the servitors of the rulers cast the one portion into the woman and the other into the man in the fashion which I</p>  
 <p><a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="green">p. 286</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the compulsion of the parents.</font></span>have told you, then the servitors secretly compel them, even if they are removed at very great distance from one another, so that they concert to be in a concert of the world. And the counterfeiting spirit which is in the man, cometh to the portion which is entrusted to the world in the matter of his body, and lifteth it and casteth it down into the womb of the woman [into the portion] which is entrusted to the seed of wickedness.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the process of gestation.</font></span>"And in that hour the three-hundred-and-sixty-and-five servitors of the rulers go into her womb and take up their abode in it. The servitors bring the two portions the one to the other, and moreover the servitors withhold |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>347</b>.</font></span> the blood of all the food of the woman which she will eat and which she will drink, and they withhold [it] in the womb of the woman up to forty days. And after forty days they knead the blood of the power of all the food and knead it well in the woman's womb.</p>  
 <p>"After forty days they spend another thirty days in building its members in the image of the body of the man; each buildeth a member. I will tell you the decans who will build it [<i>sc.</i> the body]; I will tell them you at the expansion of the universe.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the incarnation of the soul.</font></span>"If then after this the servitors shall have completed the whole body and all its members in seventy days, after this the servitors summon into the body which they have built,--first indeed they summon the counterfeiting spirit; thereafter they summon the soul within them; and thereafter they summon the compound of the power into the soul; and the destiny they put outside</p>  
 <p><a name="page_287"><font size="1" color="green">p. 287</font></a></p>  
 <p>them all, as it is not blended with them, [but] following them and accompanying them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the sealing of the plasm.</font></span>"And after this the servitors seal them one to the other with all the seals which the rulers have given them. [And] they seal the day on which they have taken up their abode in the womb of the woman,--they seal [it] on the left hand |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>348</b>.</font></span> of the plasm; and they seal the day on which they have completed the body, on the right hand; and they seal the day on which the rulers have handed it over to them, on the middle of the skull of the body of the plasm; and they seal the day on which the soul hath come forth out of the rulers, they seal it on the [left of] the skull of the plasm; and they seal the day on which they kneaded the members and separated them for a soul, they seal it on the right of the skull of the plasm; and the day on which they have bound the counterfeiting spirit to it [the soul], they seal on the back of the skull of the plasm; and the day on which the rulers have breathed the power into the body, they seal on the brain which is in the midst of the head of the plasm and also on the inside [? the heart] of the plasm; and the number of years which the soul will spend in the body, they seal on the forehead which is on the plasm. And so they seal all those seals on the plasm. I will tell you the names of all these seals at the expansion of the universe; and after the expansion of the universe I will tell you wherefor all hath come to pass. And, if ye could understand it, I am that mystery.</p>  
 <p>"Now, therefore, the servitors complete the whole man. And of all these seals with which they have sealed the body, |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>349</b>.</font></span> the servitors carry the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_288"><font size="1" color="green">p. 288</font></a></p>  
 <p>whole peculiarity and bring it to all the retributive rulers who [are] over all the chastisements of the judgments; and these hand it over to their receivers, in order that they may lead their souls out of the bodies,--they hand over to them the peculiarity of the seals, in order that they may know the time when they are to lead the souls out of the bodies, and in order that they may know the time when they are to bring to birth the body, so that they may send their servitors in order that they may draw near and follow the soul and bear witness of all the sins it shall do,--they and the counterfeiting spirit,--on account of the manner and way, how they shall chastize it in the judgment.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the destiny.</font></span>"And when the servitors have given the peculiarity of the seals to the retributive rulers, they withdraw themselves to the economy of their occupations which is appointed unto them through the rulers of the great Fate. And when the number of months of the birth of the babe is completed, the babe is born. Small in it is the compound of the power, and small in it is the soul; and small in it is the counterfeiting spirit. The destiny on the contrary is large, as it is not mingled into the body for their economy, but followeth the soul |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>350</b>.</font></span> and the body and the counterfeiting spirit, until the time when the soul shall come forth out of the body, on account of the type of death by which it shall slay it [the body] according to the death appointed for it by the rulers of the great Fate.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of how a man cometh by his death.</font></span>"Is he to die by a wild beast, the destiny leadeth the wild beast against him until it slay him; or is he to die by a serpent, or is he to fall</p>  
 <p><a name="page_289"><font size="1" color="green">p. 289</font></a></p>  
 <p>into a pit by mischance, or is he to hang himself, or is he to die in water, or through such [kinds of death], or through another death which is worse or better than this,--in a word, it is the destiny which forceth his death. upon him. This is the occupation of the destiny, and it hath no other occupation but this. And the destiny followeth every man until the day of his death."</p>
