 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">I saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven.  They were descending to earth, and again ascending to heaven, preparing for the fulfilment of some important event.  Then I saw another mighty angel commissioned to descend to earth, and unite his voice with the third angel, and give power and force to his message.  Great power and glory were imparted to the angel, and as he descended, the earth was lightened with his glory.  The light which went before and followed after this angel, penetrated everywhere, as he cried mightily, with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.  The message of the fall of Babylon, as given by the second angel, is again given, with the addition of the corruptions which have been entering the churches since 1844.  The work of this angel comes in at the right time, and joins in the last great work of the third angel's message, as it swells into a loud cry.  And the people of God are fitted up everywhere to stand in the hour of temptation which they are soon to meet.  I saw a great light resting upon them, and they united in the message, and fearlessly proclaimed with great power the third angel's message.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Angels were sent to aid the mighty angel from heaven, and I heard voices which seemed to sound everywhere, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues; for her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.  This message seemed to be an addition to the third message, and joined it, as the midnight cry joined the second angel's message in 1844.  The glory of God rested upon the patient, waiting saints, and they fearlessly gave the last solemn warning, proclaiming the fall of Babylon, and calling upon God's people to come out of her; that they might escape her fearful doom.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">The light that was shed upon the waiting ones penetrated everywhere, and those who had any light in the churches, who had not heard and rejected the three messages, answered to the call, and left the fallen churches.  Many had come to years of accountability since these messages had been given, and the light shone upon them, and they were privileged to choose life or death.  Some chose life, and took their stand with those looking for their Lord, and keeping all his commandments.  The third message was to do its work; all were to be tested upon it, and the precious ones were to be called out from the religious bodies.  A compelling power moves the honest, while the manifestation of the power of God holds in fear and restraint relatives and friends, and they dare not, neither have they power to, hinder those who feel the work of the Spirit of God upon them.  The last call is carried even to the poor slaves, and the pious among them, with humble expressions, pour forth their songs of extravagant joy at the prospect of their happy deliverance, and their masters cannot check them; for a fear and astonishment keep them silent.  Mighty miracles are wrought, the sick are healed, and signs and wonders follow the believers.  God is in the work, and every saint, fearless of consequences, follows the convictions of his own conscience, and unites with those who are keeping all the commandments of God; and they sound abroad the third message with power.  I saw that the third message would close with power and strength far exceeding the midnight cry.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Servants of God, endowed with power from on high, with their faces lighted up, and shining with holy consecration, went forth fulfilling their work, and proclaiming the message from heaven.  Souls that were scattered all through the religious bodies answered to the call, and the precious were hurried out of the doomed churches, as Lot was hurried out of Sodom before her destruction.  God's people were fitted up and strengthened by the excellent glory which fell upon them in rich abundance, preparing them to endure the hour of temptation.  A multitude of voices I heard everywhere, saying, Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</p>
