   <h2 align="center">THE SPIRITUAL LIFE NOT A LIFE OF IMITATION</h2>
 
   <p>It is equally important for us to remember, if the spiritual life is to be real to us, that it is not a life of
   the imitation or repetition of the experience of others. That we need others here, as elsewhere, is clear. That we
   come into most that is of value to us, through introduction by some other, is also plain. Nevertheless, if the
   spiritual world is to have the fullest reality for us—the reality it ought to have for a mind awakened to mature
   self-consciousness—we must have some experience in the spiritual that is genuinely our own, not a hollow echo of
   something we have heard from others.</p>
 
   <p>In a Christian community, where the language of religious experience is familiar, perhaps there is no greater
   danger besetting the spiritual life than this danger of merely imitating the experience of others. To face the
   reality of a genuine religious experience, heartily to fulfil the conditions upon which alone it may become genuinely
   ours, means much that is uncomfortable—real willingness to see the facts of our own life and need as they are, the
   breaking down of our pride, the giving up of our selfishness and self-indulgence, the putting of ourselves really and
   persistently in the presence of God's supreme revelation in Christ. This is not easy. Men naturally shrink from
   it. It is far easier to satisfy oneself with a very shallow dealing with the problem of our life, and then to catch
   up the traditional language of religious experience from others.</p>
 
   <p>This temptation, in the individual himself, is increased by the virtual demand that has been very generally made
   by the Church, that there must be a full expression of the meaning of the Christian life at the very beginning, or
   even as a condition of entering upon it at all. But how is it possible that this should honestly be? It seems very
   like requiring a student to pass upon a course as a condition of entering it. A confession of Christ that means
   anything must be one's own, the honest expression of what one has already found Christ to be. A confession of
   faith requires that the faith—the living experience—should be there, before we confess it. But how can a man confess
   the divinity of Christ, for example, as a condition of becoming a disciple of Christ? The only confession of
   Christ's divinity, that can be even approximately adequate, can come only in his disciple-ship, in one's
   deepening experience of what Christ has come to be to him. Plainly, Christ's own little circle of the twelve came
   only gradually, under association with him, to any adequate confession of him. We have no right to require more. The
   point of insistence is, not that we should accept the creed of the apostles in order to come into their experience,
   but rather that we should seek an experience like the apostles, that may fruit in a like confession, which can then
   be genuinely our own.</p>
 
   <p>The very familiarity with the language of religious experience, then, the instinctive temptation to catch up the
   expression of life rather than to insist upon the life itself, and the demand of the Church for an expression of
   Christian life quite beyond the possibility of experience,—all combine to produce the far too general habit of
   expressing more than has been personally known and experienced, and hence to give the sense of unreality. This is, to
   my mind, the most serious danger, for example, of the Christian Endeavor pledge, particularly with those quite young,
   where the matter is not carefully guarded. They are pledged to speak, whether they have really something of their own
   to say or not. They naturally catch up the language of Christian experience, which they have heard from others.
   Gradually, if they are thoughtful and conscientious and have not been making unusual growth, they come to feel that
   their language is no true reflection of their own experience. They feel its hollowness; a reaction sets in; and a
   most depressing sense of the unreality of the spiritual life naturally succeeds. We must not shut our eyes to such
   dangers. In any case, wherever the religious life becomes, to any large degree, a life of mere imitation or
   repetition of others' experiences, and the person is at all thoughtful, there the spiritual life is certain to
   come to seem thoroughly unreal.</p>
