   <h2 align="center">SOME COMMON LOGICAL FALLACIES</h2>
 
   <p>This practical nature of all belief itself indicates that, for the sake of the spiritual life itself, a protest is
   constantly needed in the interests of the whole concrete reality and of the whole man. In the last analysis, perhaps
   the greatest danger that can beset a man's spiritual life and thought is to misconceive both as having to do only
   with some fraction of a man's being or living. As to our religious thinking, this means that we are to avoid the
   mistakes which come from forgetting the influence of certain common logical fallacies, and the mistake of failing to
   set aside certain traditional objections, which are supposed to put religious faith and life at peculiar
   disadvantage.</p>
 
   <p>And, first, let us be sure that the spiritual life is guarded from the influence of certain logical fallacies
   which, while very common, are none the less unwarranted and dangerous. Nowhere more than in our ultimate thinking
   upon spiritual themes do we need to be sure of the soundness of our reasoning. Two of these common fallacies have
   been already implied in the emphasis upon the practical nature of all knowledge and belief, and may be merely
   mentioned in this summary view of such logical mistakes, namely: the two great and far reaching mistakes of ignoring
   all that cannot be precisely formulated, and so yielding to the constant temptation to cut short the facts to suit
   our theories; and, particularly, of making the intellectual the sole standard of reality, and so practically
   identifying the logical and the metaphysical. The history of philosophy and the history of theology teem with
   examples of both mistakes, some of which have been already noted.</p>
 
   <p>Besides these, three other common fallacies deserve attention: those of being dominated by a word, by an analogy,
   and by what is imageable. In all these cases the fundamental difficulty is that the word or the analogy or the image
   is not really thought through.</p>
 
   <p>One would hardly believe, were the evidence not forced upon him, the extent to which the thought of even
   professional thinkers has been dominated by words. The only deliverance from such domination is the persistent
   determination to use no words without having some clear corresponding thought. Domination by; a word whose
   implications are never made really clear, it has been often noted, is seen in the constant use, by Locke and his
   followers, of the word "impression." No doubt an inadequate analogy is also strongly at work here. Taken
   together, the domination has been so real, that "the tang of Locke's cask," as some one has expressed
   it, is to be recognized in very much of English thought down to the present. Domination by a word is particularly
   easy, when the word has a double meaning, or seems capable, at least, of looking in two directions at once. Thus,
   many have hidden from themselves the real difficulties of their conception by the choice of the word
   "impulse"; which has both a recognized physical and psychical meaning, and so seems admirably adapted to
   serve as an explanatory principle, that shall be neither a mechanical force nor a conscious mind. These people seem
   never to have compelled themselves to face the question, whether they could really think any tertium quid,
   corresponding to the ambiguity of the word. There has been a similar playing with the word "appearance,"
   the word "thought," and the word "force." And—not to extend enumeration of examples—it
   particularly concerns the thinker on religious themes to notice, that one may be successfully challenged to give any
   clear meaning to the term "impersonal spirit," and to similar designations, that have nowhere figured more
   largely than in anti-theistic discussions. We are not to be bullied by a word, however sonorous or often repeated. We
   may and we must demand, if we have any desire really to reach the truth, that every term have a clear corresponding
   thought. It is not vain to insist upon the point. Over and over again in the history of thought, great interests have
   been sacrificed to a word.</p>
 
   <p>The extent to which men are satisfied, in their search for an explanation, by mere names, is another almost
   humorous illustration of this domination by words. Few seem to have made it clear to themselves, for example, that
   naming a comparatively unknown force is no explanation of it, or that a "law" of nature is no explanation
   of the why and wherefore of the phenomena whose behavior the law only formulates.</p>
 
   <p>Domination by a striking analogy is still more common and more dangerous. It is more dangerous because the analogy
   may be supposed to be partly applicable. The mind then accepts it as wholly adequate, instead of insisting on a clear
   recognition of the precise limitations of the analogy. It then substitutes for real thinking upon the subject in
   hand, the much easier process of drawing out the analogy. It may even congratulate itself upon some peculiarly deep
   thinking, when it has abused its analogy, in making it "go on all fours." One can hardly doubt, for
   example, that theology has often so abused the analogy of human law and government. And it is worth serious thought
   by us all, just now, whether under the stimulus of the idea of evolution, with its manifold applications, we are not
   all in danger of unthinking domination by the biological analogy. Let us say frankly, that much of this biological
   thinking on spiritual themes is simply not thinking at all, but just deluding ourselves with a half-thought analogy.
   And let us recall Lotze's protest—when the world was once before going wild over a precisely similar idea—against
   the term organic, "for which," he says, "a long defense will have to be made if at the last day
   account has to be given for every idle word."[<a name="text16" href="#foot16">16</a>]</p>
 
   <p>Once more, we are peculiarly liable to delusion, when a matter can be in some way presented to us in an Image,
   although we may not be able truly to think it at all. The clearness and apparent obviousness of the image of an
   actual contact or impact of two bodies, for example, is felt, probably, by most to solve forthwith the whole problem
   of the possibility of reciprocal action; although, in truth, it throws not a particle of light upon the difficult
   question of how we are really to think the reciprocal action as taking place. And so in countless problems, the mere
   imaging power is made to take the place of thinking; and it does it so effectively, that often the really serious
   difficulties are not even raised. Almost all the force of much anti-theistic argument lies in this shallow appeal to
   the power of sense-imagery. The argument seems to get on swimmingly because it moves on a crude sense plane, and
   never faces the real difficulties, which require a final theistic view for their solution. The difficult problem of
   interaction, already referred to, is a good example of such ignored difficulties. So, too, by imaging laws to
   themselves as some kind of real existences, men seem to be able to accomplish much without needing to assume God, and
   escape many difficult questions; but the process can hardly be called thinking. Such theorists tell us that, grant
   them matter, force, and laws, they will easily show how the cosmos has arisen from chaos. The appeal here is almost
   wholly to the imaging power, and—to mention but a single difficulty—the view quite fails to make clear how that in
   which laws already rule can be in any sense a "chaos." It is to be regretted that the philosophizing of men
   whose training has been wholly in natural science, has been so largely on this plane of simple appeal to the sense
   imagination. Perhaps no one of late has shown more convincingly the weakness of this kind of reasoning than Ward, in
   his Naturalism and Agnosticism.</p>
