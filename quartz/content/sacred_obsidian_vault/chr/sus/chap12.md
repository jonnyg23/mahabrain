   <h2 align="center">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SCIENTIFIC AND RELIGIOUS PROBLEMS</h2>
 
   <p>We have now passed in review the misconceptions, injurious to the spiritual life, which arise from ignoring the
   likeness and connections of the spiritual life with the rest of life. And we turn now to note the misconceptions
   which come from ignoring the real difference of the spiritual life, its unique sphere and contribution.</p>
 
   <p>In the first place, we may get into great darkness from forgetting that the problems of religious faith have
   certain distinctive differences from those in natural science; for to forget these differences is to expect an
   impossible solution in religion.</p>
 
   <p>This means, if we are to keep clear of delusion here, we must, first, carefully observe science's threefold
   restriction of itself to experience, to the tracing of purely causal connections, and to phenomena.</p>
 
   <p>The restriction to experience implies a clear recognition of the fact that science cannot in any case anticipate
   results independent of previous experience in the same or similar lines. And this really means that the full cause of
   the next stage in the observed process is not present for it in the stage now under observation, in even the most
   favorable cases. Hume is right, here, in asserting that, in truth, we never really see the causal connection. At most
   only a part of the conditions disclose themselves to even the finest scientific analysis in the finite things and
   properties. It seems plain that in this aspect, then, natural science itself looks to and requires an ultimate ideal
   view to complete it.</p>
 
   <p>The restriction to the tracing of purely causal connections—though even this, as we have just seen, is not
   ultimate—means that the one great question for natural science is the question of process—how the thing came to be—of
   mechanical explanation, not the question of meaning. Thus, to use Paulsen's illustration, there are two quite
   different questions as to a page of print: How did it come to be, what were the processes involved? and what does the
   page mean? Now the question as to process is the question of science. But the religious question is primarily and
   necessarily one of meaning, of ideal interpretation. This distinction holds, although it is to be not only granted
   but asserted, that in an ultimate philosophical view the two questions cannot be kept absolutely apart; there we must
   ask as to their mutual relations. Now it is to be observed that religion's question of the meaning of things
   cannot be solved in the same way as science's question of process; though religion, desiring to know exactly how
   God has acted, must take full account of all the facts brought out by scientific investigation, and must grant
   absolute freedom of investigation. But when all science's facts of process are fully set forth, the question of
   their meaning still remains unanswered; and the precise point now to be noted, I repeat, is that this question of
   meaning that presses upon the religious inquiry, it is impossible to answer in the same way as the scientific
   question of process. The attempt, therefore, to solve the problem of religious thinking and living just as the
   scientific problem is solved, is foredoomed to failure. We can know beforehand that such a solution is impossible.
   The two problems differ widely.</p>
 
   <p>Once more, science's restriction of itself to phenomena means that all ultimate questions are left out of
   account as not so reachable. It is this very fact, probably, that makes it so easily possible for scientific
   investigators, when they turn from strict scientific inquiry to philosophical questions, to lose sight of the far
   reaching character of the assumptions involved in terms which they use as matters of course. A method of
   investigation that deliberately—and for its own limited questions, wisely—ignores all ultimate problems evidently
   will not solve these ultimate problems. Upon these we can get light only by extended inference from ascertained
   facts, guided by the laws and demands of our own being. Even a single science, like chemistry, when it tries to
   become in its own sphere a rational system of thought, is obliged to go quite beyond the phenomenal and bring in much
   of hypothesis and distant inference.</p>
 
   <p>From the point of view, then, of any one of science's own three restrictions of itself, it is plain that the
   religious problem is not the same as the scientific problem, and hence cannot be solved in the same way. Science,
   therefore, as such, does not bar the way to faith.</p>
 
   <p>Moreover, in tracing out the difference between the scientific and religious problem, it is worth noting that
   science itself is an ideal construction of the world—an attempt to think the world into unity in
   mathematico-mechanical terms. That is, science is itself an ideal which the mind freely creates, cherishes, and seeks
   to realize; and, as itself such an ideal, cannot, to follow Münsterberg's thought, legitimately rule out other
   ideals—aesthetic, ethical, or religious. Rather, as James suggests, the comparative success of science is an
   encouragement in the pursuit of the other more difficult ideals of thinking the world into unity in aesthetic,
   ethical, or religious terms.</p>
 
   <p>Once more, the scientific problem may be called a purely intellectual one; although even here, in the highest
   scientific questions, imagination must be used; and Lange, though the sympathetic historian of materialism, believed
   that the greatest scientific discoveries have always been made by those who worked from the point of view of the
   ideal. Still, in general, it may be truly affirmed that the scientific problem is a purely intellectual one. In such
   investigations one may wisely set aside all reference to feeling and volition. The question is simply one of exact
   intellectual formulation, where any obtrusive feeling, or thought of extraneous purpose would only hinder the
   result.</p>
 
   <p>That is never true of really ultimate questions, and never true in real living. We have already seen that even the
   problem of pure knowing cannot be solved in merely intellectual terms. While, then, in its proximate inquiries
   natural science may very properly cultivate the coldly intellectual mood and ignore all other appeals; for religion
   to do so would be to take the thoroughly unscientific position of ignoring most important data, and so making a true
   solution impossible. This is no attempt to evade truth, but the "appeal from a partial and fragmentary truth to
   a fuller truth." The contrast between scientific and religious faith may, perhaps, be put in this form:
   scientific faith takes account, and needs to take account, only of intellectual data; while religious faith takes
   account of the data involved in the feeling of dependence, in æsthetic feelings and in ethical feelings. Where these
   are overlooked, naturally, as Lotze says, "a very barren rationalism takes the place of that which the whole
   reason, acting in all directions would be able to produce."[<a name="text23" href="#foot23">23</a>] "The
