   <h2 align="center">THE SPIRITUAL LIFE NOT A LIFE OF MAGICAL INHERITANCE</h2>
 
   <p>A third misconception of the nature of the spiritual life, which is certain finally to give the sense of its
   unreality, is that it is a life of magical inheritance of results.</p>
 
   <p>Our own time is particularly liable to have this feeling. So far as the scientific spirit really affects men, they
   are certain to give increasing emphasis to the necessity, in all spheres, of the recognition of laws, of conditions,
   and of time. If results in the spiritual life, therefore, are conceived as coming without clear conditions, in a kind
   of merely magical way, that life unavoidably takes on for such minds a decided aspect of unreality. It has no
   intelligible connection with the rest of their life, and there seems to be nothing they can do with it. This makes it
   imperative that those, who would make the spiritual world a reality for the most wide-awake minds of our time, must
   themselves see the spiritual life as a genuine sphere of laws, with its own clear conditions that can be known and
   stated and fulfilled, with a certainty of results following. It is not the frills of scientific illustration that the
   interpreter of the spiritual life needs to-day, but the genuine scientific spirit in the study of his own greatest
   sphere. Drummond's greatest contribution to the thought of his time lay just here. And there is still great
   opportunity for a thoughtful carrying on of his central contention of law in the spiritual world.</p>
 
   <p>And even for those who are not consciously, and perhaps not at all, affected by the scientific temper of our
   times, there is a similar baffling sense of the unreality of spiritual things, if the magical conception largely
   prevails. Even such must have the sense that, in their religious life, they are simply feeling around in the dark.
   What may result, they can have no idea; much disappointment is certain; they can only hope that here and there
   something of what they seek may be stumbled upon. And when even such minds turn to the ordinary avocations of their
   lives, and note how confidently they may count upon results following upon conditions, they can hardly fail to
   contrast the sharp out-lines of this real life of work with the dimness of the spiritual.</p>
 
   <p>And none of us may forget without distinct and large loss that the spiritual life, like all life, is a growth,
   always involving laws, conditions, and time. To forget or ignore this, is to make it certain that the spiritual life
   will become unreal to us. That is simply to say that we are bound to take account of the common psychological
   conditions of our life, already considered, and particularly to note the special laws of the spiritual life itself,
   to be considered later. These laws, in a word, are the laws of a deepening personal relation, which every day's
   true living makes better known.</p>
