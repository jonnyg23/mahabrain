   <h2 align="center">OUR VERY QUESTIONINGS A PROOF OF REALITY</h2>
 
   <p>But, with reference to all these unremovable causes of the seeming unreality of the spiritual life, we should not
   fail to notice that our very questionings here are an evidence of reality. It is hard to see how else the questions
   could arise at all.</p>
 
   <p>In the question of freedom, for example, if the mind were wholly determined, it is difficult to see how the very
   notion of freedom should arise at all; or if the ideas, which compose it, be conceived somehow to have arisen, it is
   still more difficult to see how it could mean anything to a mind that did not already know freedom in its own
   experience. I confess myself quite dissatisfied with the ordinary facile psychological geneses of the conviction of
   freedom. They seem to me only another great example of the ever-besetting "psychologist's fallacy. The
   simple fact, that with any intelligence I can raise the question of freedom, that I can give any meaning to it
   satisfying even to my own mind,—this alone seems to me good evidence of the fact of freedom. The question is itself
   explicable, only upon the presupposition of the fact.</p>
 
   <p>So, too, in the question of immortality, is not Emerson right in maintaining that the perennial interest with
   which men perpetually return to this problem, is itself better evidence of the reality of the future life than any
   proofs which they might discover? If we were mere creatures of the day, complete kindred of animals, it is hard to
   see how this question of the immortal life should come so to press upon us. Is it not the stirring within us of our
   own birthright, that prompts the questioning? Is it a false response that men have made, these years since Wordsworth
   wrote, to his "intimations of immortality"? Are questionings, in truth, no evidence here? Does not, rather,
   the note of satiety, unrest, disillusion, and final despair, which inevitably shows itself in all poetry that
   reflects any thorough-going attempt on the part of man to find his entire satisfaction in the flesh, bear
   unmistakable testimony to the fact that man is more than animal?[<a name="text1" href="#foot1">1</a>]</p>
 
   <p>So, once more, the very existence of the problem of evil in practically all minds points to its own solution. For
   the question could not arise in all minds, except upon the assumption in all that, in a world that ought to be,
   happiness and virtue would fall together. But in this common assumption made by all minds, as demanded by their very
   constitutions, must we not see an unmistakable self-expression of that power that lies back of the universe, and,
   therefore, an implicit answer to our own doubt,—a virtual pledge that finally, at least, that shall be which is here
   demanded?</p>
 
   <p>A similar thing is to be said even with reference to the question of the existence and love of God. Unless man is
   by his very nature religious, it is difficult to see how the primal religious question could even arise. The simple
   fact that the question is one of never-dying interest to man, that he persistently recurs to it in his highest
   moments, and unconsciously assumes it in his deepest experiences and even in his commonest activities—the mere fact
   that he so questions as concerning an absolutely vital interest, is itself strong evidence of the reality of that
   questioned. Thus "Physicus," in the very act of renouncing all religious faith, says, as if it were a
   matter of course, "I am confident that truth must in the end be most profitable for the race;" thus
   unconsciously still betraying a fundamentally religious belief.</p>
 
   <p>Here, too, the persistent, unconscious showings of the nature of men must be taken as self-expressions of that
   Absolute which is back of all, and so evidence of such a God as the soul seeks. A thoughtful modern novelist thus
   concludes one of her stones: "Full assurance has not been granted me, and it is my lot in doing battle to strike
   often in the dark. Yet I have moments when I know that the strife is not in vain. In these I wonder why we are so
   troubled about our duty to our fellow-man, and about our knowledge of God. The one command in regard to our neighbor
   is not obscure. And our foreboding lest our faith in God shall escape us seems futile, inasmuch as we cannot escape
   from our faith." One can hardly deny the force of this consideration, without calling in question that
   fundamental assumption of all our thinking and living—the honesty of the world. When this is denied, all thinking,
   scientific, philosophical, or religious, is at an end.</p>
 
   <p>"Rather I prize the doubt<br>
     Low kinds exist without,<br>
     Finished and finite clods, untroubled by a spark. </p>
 
   <p> Poor vaunt of life indeed,<br>
        Were man but formed to feed<br>
    On joy, to solely seek and find and feast;<br>
    Such feasting ended, then<br>
        As sure an end to men;<br>
    Irks care the crop-full bird? Frets doubt the maw-<br>
            crammed beast?</p>
 
   <p>    Rejoice we are allied<br>
        To That which doth provide<br>
    And not partake, effect and not receive!<br>
        A spark disturbs our clod;<br>
        Nearer we hold of God<br>
    Who gives, than of his tribes that take, I must believe. </p>
 
   <p>    Then, welcome each rebuff<br>
        That turns earth's smoothness rough,<br>
    Each sting that bids nor sit nor stand, but go!<br>
        Be our joys three parts pain!<br>
        Strive, and hold cheap the strain;<br>
    Learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe!               </p>
 
   <p>    For thence—a paradox<br>
        Which comforts while it mocks—<br>
    Shall life succeed in that it seems to fail:<br>
        What I aspired to be,<br>
        And was not, comforts me:<br>
    A brute I might have been, but would not sink i' the<br>
            scale."</p>
