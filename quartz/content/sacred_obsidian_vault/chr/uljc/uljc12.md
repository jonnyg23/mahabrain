 <p>1. The words of Issa spread among the Pagans, through whose country he passed, and the inhabitants abandoned their idols.</p>

 <p>2. Seeing which, the priests demanded of him who thus glorified the name of the true God, that he should, in the presence of the people, prove the charges he made against them, and demonstrate the vanity of their idols.</p>  
 <p>3. And Issa answered them: "If your idols, or the animals you worship, really possess the supernatural powers you claim, let them strike me with a thunder-bolt before you!"</p>  
 <p>4. "Why dost not thou perform a miracle," replied the priests, "and let thy God confound ours, if He is greater than they?"</p>  
 <p>5. But Issa said: "The miracles of our God have been wrought from the first day when the universe was created; and are performed every day and every moment; whoso</p>  
 <p><a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="green">p. 179</font></a></p>  
 <p>sees them not is deprived of one of the most beautiful gifts of life.</p>  
 <p>6. "And it is not on inanimate objects of stone, metal or wood that He will let His anger fall, but on the men who worship them, and who, therefore, for their salvation, must destroy the idols they have made.</p>  
 <p>7. "Even as a stone and a grain of sand, which are naught before man, await patiently their use by Him,</p>  
 <p>8. "In like manner, man, who is naught before God, must await in resignation His pleasure for a manifestation of His favor.</p>  
 <p>9. "But woe to you! ye adversaries of men, if it is not the favor you await, but rather the wrath of the Most High; woe to you, if you demand that He attest His power by a miracle!</p>  
 <p>10. "For it is not the idols which He will</p>  
 <p><a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="green">p. 180</font></a></p>  
 <p>destroy in His wrath, but those by whom they were created; their hearts will be the prey of an eternal fire and their flesh shall be given to the beasts of prey.</p>  
 <p>11. "God will drive away the contaminated animals from His flocks; but will take to Himself those who strayed because they knew not the heavenly part within them."</p>  
 <p>12. When the Pagans saw that the power of their priests was naught, they put faith in the words of Issa. Fearing the anger of the true God, they broke their idols to pieces and caused their priests to flee from among them.</p>  
 <p>13. Issa furthermore taught the Pagans that they should not endeavor to see the eternal Spirit with their eyes; but to perceive Him with their hearts, and make</p>  
 <p><a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="green">p. 181</font></a></p>  
 <p>themselves worthy of His favors by the purity of their souls.</p>  
 <p>14. "Not only," he said to them, "must ye refrain from offering human sacrifices, but ye may not lay on the altar any creature to which life has been given, for all things created are for man.</p>  
 <p>15. "Withhold not from your neighbor his just due, for this would be like stealing from him what he had earned in the sweat of his brow.</p>  
 <p>16. "Deceive none, that ye may not yourselves be deceived; seek to justify yourselves before the last judgment, for then it will be too late.</p>  
 <p>17. "Be not given to debauchery, for it is a violation of the law of God.</p>  
 <p>18. "That you may attain to supreme bliss ye must not only purify yourselves, but</p>  
 <p><a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="green">p. 182</font></a></p>  
 <p>must also guide others into the path that will enable them to regain their primitive innocence."</p>
