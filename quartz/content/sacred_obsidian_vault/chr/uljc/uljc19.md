 <p>I. By order of the governor, the soldiers seized Issa and the two robbers, and led them to the place of execution, where they were nailed upon the crosses erected for them.</p>  
 <p>2. All day long the bodies of Issa and the two robbers hung upon the crosses, bleeding, guarded by the soldiers. The people stood all around and the relatives of the executed prayed and wept.</p>  
 <p>3. When the sun went down, Issa's tortures ended. He lost consciousness and his soul disengaged itself from the body, to reunite with God.</p>  
 <p>4. Thus ended the terrestrial existence of the reflection of the eternal Spirit under the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="green">p. 216</font></a></p>  
 <p>form of a man who had saved hardened sinners and comforted the afflicted.</p>  
 <p>5. Meanwhile, Pilate was afraid for what he had done, and ordered the body of the Saint to be given to his relatives, who put it in a tomb near to the place of execution. Great numbers of persons came to visit the tomb, and the air was filled with their wailings and lamentations.</p>  
 <p>6. Three days later, the governor sent his soldiers to remove Issa's body and bury it in some other place, for he feared a rebellion among the people.</p>

 <p>mortal remains of the saint in whom part of the divine Spirit had lived on earth.</p>  
 <p>8. When Pilate learned of this rumor, he grew angry and prohibited, under penalty of death, the naming of Issa, or praying for him to the Lord.</p>  
 <p>9. But the people, nevertheless, continued to weep over Issa's death and to glorify their master; wherefore, many were carried into captivity, subjected to torture and put to death.</p>  
 <p>10. And the disciples of Saint Issa departed from the land of Israel and went in all directions, to the heathen, preaching that they should abandon their gross errors, think of the salvation of their souls and earn the perfect bliss which awaits human beings in the immaterial world, full of glory, where the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="green">p. 218</font></a></p>  
 <p>great Creator abides in all his immaculate and perfect majesty.</p>  
 <p>11. The heathen, their kings, and their warriors, listened to the preachers, abandoned their erroneous beliefs and forsook their priests and their idols, to celebrate the praises of the most wise Creator of the Universe, the King of Kings, whose heart is filled with infinite mercy</p>
