 <p></p><p><a name="pg_165"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 165</font></a></p><p></p><p>Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall 
 eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. 
 Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?--JESUS.
 </p><p>He sent His word, and healed them, and delivered them from their 
 destructions.--PSALMS.
 </p><p></p><p>PHYSIOLOGY is one of the apples from "the tree 
 of knowledge." Evil declared that eating this fruit
 would open man's eyes and make him as a god. Instead
 of so doing, it closed the eyes of mortals to man's Godgiven dominion over the earth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man not structural</font></p>
 To measure intellectual capacity by the size of the 
 brain and strength by the exercise of muscle, is to
 subjugate intelligence, to make mind mortal, and to place this so-called mind at the
 mercy of material organization  and  non-intelligent
 matter.
 <p></p><p>Obedience to the so-called physical laws of health has 
 not checked sickness. Diseases have multiplied, since
 man-made material theories took the place of spiritual
 truth. 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Causes of sickness</font></p>
 You say that indigestion, fatigue, sleeplessness, cause
 distressed stomachs and aching heads. Then 
 you consult your brain in order to remember 
 what has hurt you, when your remedy lies in forgetting
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_166%20%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 166  </font></a></p><p></p><p>the whole thing; for matter has no sensation of its own, 
 and the human mind is all that can produce pain.
 As a man thinketh, so is he. Mind is all that feels,
 acts, or impedes action. Ignorant of this, or shrinking
 from its implied responsibility, the healing effort is made
 on the wrong side, and thus the conscious control over the 
 body is lost.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Delusions pagan and medical</font></p>
 The Mohammedan believes  in  a  pilgrimage  to  Mecca
 for the salvation of his soul. The popular doctor believes
 in his prescription, and the pharmacist believes
 in the power of his drugs to save a man's
 life. The Mohammedan's belief is a religious
 delusion; the doctor's and pharmacist's is a medical
 mistake.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Health from reliance on spirituality</font></p>
 The erring human mind is inharmonious in itself.
 From it arises the inharmonious body. To ignore
 God as of little use in sickness is a mistake.
 Instead of thrusting Him aside in times of
 bodily trouble, and waiting for the hour of
 strength in which to acknowledge Him, we should learn
 that He can do all things for us in sickness as in
 health.
 <p></p><p>Failing to recover health through adherence to physiology and hygiene, the despairing invalid often drops  
 them, and in his extremity and only as a last resort, turns 
 to God. The invalid's faith in the divine Mind is less
 than in drugs, air, and exercise, or he would have resorted 
 to Mind first. The balance of power is conceded to be 
 with matter by most of the medical systems; but when
 Mind at last asserts its mastery over sin, disease, and 
 death, then is man found to be harmonious and
 immortal.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_167"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 167</font></a></p><p></p><p>Should we implore a corporeal God to heal the sick
 out of His personal volition, or should we understand the
 infinite divine Principle which heals? If we rise no higher
 than blind faith, the Science of healing is not attained, and
 Soul-existence, in the place of sense-existence, is not comprehended. We apprehend Life in divine Science only
 as we live above corporeal sense and correct it. Our proportionate admission of the claims of good or of evil determines the harmony of our existence,--our health, our
 longevity, and our Christianity.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The two masters</font></p>
 We cannot serve two masters nor perceive divine Science with the material senses. Drugs and hygiene cannot
 successfully usurp the place and power of the 
 divine source of all health and perfection. If 
 God made man both good and evil, man must remain
 thus. What can improve God's work? Again, an error
 in the premise must appear in the conclusion. To have
 one God and avail yourself of the power of Spirit, you
 must love God supremely.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Half-way success </font></p>
 The "flesh lusteth against the Spirit." The flesh and
 Spirit can no more unite in action, than good can coincide with evil. It is not wise to take a halting and half-way position or to expect to work
 equally with Spirit and matter, Truth and error. There,
 is but one way--namely, God and His idea--which
 leads to spiritual being. The scientific government of the
 body must be attained through the divine Mind. It is impossible to gain control over the body in any other way.
 On this fundamental point, timid conservatism is absolutely inadmissible. Only through radical reliance on
 Truth can scientific healing power be realized.
 <p></p><p>Substituting good words for a good life, fair seeming
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_168%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 168 </font></a></p><p></p><p>for straightforward character, is a poor shift for the weak
 and worldly, who think the standard of Christian Science
 too high for them.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Belief on the wrong side</font></p>
 If the scales are evenly adjusted, the removal of a single
 weight from either scale gives preponderance to the opposite. Whatever influence you cast on the side 
 of matter, you take away from Mind, which 
 would otherwise outweigh all else. Your belief militates
 against your health, when it ought to be enlisted on the 
 side of health. When sick (according to belief) you rush 
 after drugs, search out the material so-called laws of
 health, and depend upon them to heal you, though you 
 have already brought yourself into the slough of disease 
 through just this false belief.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The divine authority</font></p>
 Because man-made systems insist that man becomes 
 sick and useless, suffers and dies, all in consonance with
 the laws of God, are we to believe it? Are
 we to believe an authority which denies God's
 spiritual command relating to perfection,--an authority
 which Jesus proved to be false? He did the will of the
 Father. He healed sickness in defiance of what is called 
 material law, but in accordance with God's law, the law 
 of Mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Disease foreseen</font></p>
 I have discerned disease in the human mind, and recognized the patient's fear of it, months before the so-called
 disease made its appearance in the body. Disease being a belief, a latent illusion of mortal
 mind, the sensation would not appear if the error of belief
 was met and destroyed by truth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Changed mentality</font></p>
 Here let a word be noticed which will be
 better understood hereafter,--chemicalization.
 By chemicalization I mean the process which mortal
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_169"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 169</font></a></p><p></p><p>mind and body undergo in the change of belief from a
 material to a spiritual basis.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific foresight</font></p>
 Whenever an aggravation of symptoms has occurred
 through mental chemicalization, I have seen the mental
 signs, assuring me that danger was over, before 
 the patient felt the change; and I have said  
 to the patient, "You are healed," - sometimes to his discomfiture, when he was incredulous. But it always came
 about as I had foretold.
 <p>I name these facts to show that disease has a mental,
 mortal origin,--that faith in rules of health or in drugs
 begets and fosters disease by attracting the mind to the
 subject of sickness, by exciting fear of disease, and by dosing the body in order to avoid it. The faith reposed in
 these things should find stronger supports and a higher
 home. If we understood the control of Mind over body,
 we should put no faith in material means.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind the only healer</font></p>
 Science not only reveals the origin of all disease as
 mental, but it also declares that all disease is cured by
 divine Mind. There can be no healing except by this Mind, however much we trust
 a drug or any other means towards which human faith
 or endeavor is directed. It is mortal mind, not matter, which brings to the sick whatever good they may
 seem to receive from materiality. But the sick are never
 really healed except by means of the divine power.
 Only the action of Truth, Life, and Love can give
 harmony.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Modes of matter</font></p>
 Whatever teaches man to have other laws and to
 acknowledge other powers than the divine
 Mind, is anti-Christian.  The good that a
 poisonous drug seems to do is evil, for it robs man of
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_170%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 170 </font></a></p><p></p><p>reliance on God, omnipotent Mind, and according to belief, poisons the human system. Truth is not the basis of
 theogony. Modes of matter form neither a moral nor a
 spiritual system. The discord which calls for material
 methods is the result of the exercise of faith in material
 modes,--faith in matter instead of in Spirit.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Physiology unscientific</font></p>
 Did Jesus understand the economy of man less than
 Graham or Cutter? Christian ideas certainly present
 what human theories exclude--the Principle
 of man's harmony. The text, "Whosoever 
 liveth and believeth in me shall never die," not only contradicts human systems, but points to the self-sustaining 
 and eternal Truth.
 <p></p><p>The demands of Truth are spiritual, and reach the
 body through Mind. The best interpreter of man's needs 
 said: "Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat,
 or what ye shall drink."
 </p><p></p><p>If there are material laws which prevent disease, what
 then causes it? Not divine law, for Jesus healed the
 sick and cast out error, always in opposition, never in
 obedience, to physics.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Causation considered</font></p>
 Spiritual causation is the one question to be considered, 
 for more than all others spiritual causation relates to
 human progress. The age seems ready to
 approach this subject, to ponder somewhat
 the supremacy of Spirit, and at least to touch the hem
 of Truth's garment.
 <p></p><p>The description of man as purely physical, or as both
 material and spiritual,--but in either case dependent
 upon his physical organization,--is the Pandora box,
 from which all ills have gone forth, especially despair.
 Matter, which takes divine power into its own hands and
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_171"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 171</font></a></p><p></p><p>claims to be a creator, is a fiction, in which paganism and
 lust are so sanctioned by society that mankind has caught
 their moral contagion.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Paradise regained</font></p>
 Through discernment of the spiritual opposite of materiality, even the way through Christ, Truth, man will
 reopen with the key of divine Science the gates 
 of Paradise which human beliefs have closed,
 and will find himself unfallen, upright, pure, and free,
 not needing to consult almanacs for the probabilities either
 of his life or of the weather, not needing to study brainology to learn how much of a man he is.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A closed question</font></p>
 Mind's control over the universe, including man, is
 no longer an open question, but is demonstrable Science.
 Jesus illustrated the divine Principle and the
 power of immortal Mind by healing sickness 
 and sin and destroying the foundations of death.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Matter versus Spirit</font></p>
 Mistaking his origin and nature, man believes himself to
 be combined matter and Spirit. He believes that Spirit
 is sifted through matter, carried on a nerve, exposed to ejection by the operation of matter.
 The intellectual, the moral, the spiritual,--yea, the image
 of infinite Mind,--subject to non-intelligence!
 <p></p><p>No more sympathy exists between the flesh and Spirit
 than between Belial and Christ.
 </p><p></p><p>The so-called laws of matter are nothing but false beliefs that intelligence and life are present where Mind
 is not. These false beliefs are the procuring cause of all
 sin and disease. The opposite truth, that intelligence and
 life are spiritual, never material, destroys sin, sickness,
 and death.
 </p><p></p><p>The fundamental error lies in the supposition that man
 is a material outgrowth and that the cognizance of good
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_172"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 172</font></a></p><p></p><p>or evil, which he has through the bodily senses, constitutes his happiness or misery.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Godless Evolution</font></p>
 Theorizing about man's development from mushrooms
 to monkeys and from monkeys into men
 amounts to nothing in the right direction and
 very much in the wrong.
 <p></p><p>Materialism grades the human species as rising from 
 matter upward. How then is the material species maintained, if man passes through what we call death and 
 death is the Rubicon of spirituality? Spirit can form 
 no real link in this supposed chain of material being.
 But divine Science reveals the eternal chain of existence 
 as uninterrupted and wholly spiritual; yet this can be 
 realized only as the false sense of being disappears.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Degrees of development</font></p>
 If man was first a material being, he must have passed 
 through all the forms of matter in order to become man. 
 If the material body is man, he is a portion of
 matter, or dust. On the contrary, man is the 
 image and likeness of Spirit; and the belief that there is 
 Soul in sense or Life in matter obtains in mortals, alias
 mortal mind, to which the apostle refers when he says 
 that we must "put off the old man."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Identity not lost</font></p>
 What is man? Brain, heart, blood, bones, etc., the
 material structure? If the real man is in the material
 body, you take away a portion of the man when
 you amputate a limb; the surgeon destroys
 manhood, and worms annihilate it. But the loss of a limb 
 or injury to a tissue is sometimes the quickener of manliness; and the unfortunate cripple may present more nobility than the statuesque athlete,--teaching us by his 
 very deprivations, that "a man's a man, for a' that."
 <p></p><p><font size="1">When man is man</font></p>
 When we admit that matter (heart, blood, brain, acting
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_173"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 173</font></a></p><p></p><p>through the five physical senses) constitutes man, we fail
 to see how anatomy can distinguish between 
 humanity and the brute, or determine when 
 man is really man and has progressed farther than his
 animal progenitors.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Individualization</font></p>
 When the supposition, that Spirit is within what it
 creates and the potter is subject to the clay,
 is individualized, Truth is reduced to the level
 of error, and the sensible is required to be made manifest
 through the insensible.
 <p></p><p>What is termed matter manifests nothing but a material
 mentality. Neither the substance nor the manifestation
 of Spirit is obtainable through matter. Spirit is positive.
 Matter is Spirit's contrary, the absence of Spirit. For
 positive Spirit to pass through a negative condition
 would be Spirit's destruction.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man not structural</font></p>
 Anatomy declares man to be structural. Physiology
 continues this explanation, measuring human 
 strength by bones and sinews, and human life 
 by material law. Man is spiritual, individual, and eternal; material structure is mortal.
 Phrenology makes man knavish or honest according to
 the development of the cranium; but anatomy, physiology,
 phrenology, do not define the image of God, the real immortal man.
 <p></p><p>Human reason and religion come slowly to the recognition of spiritual facts, and so continue to call upon
 matter to remove the error which the human mind alone
 has created.
 </p><p></p><p>The idols of civilization are far more fatal to health
 and longevity than are the idols of barbarism. The idols
 of civilization call into action less faith than Buddhism
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_174%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 174 </font></a></p><p></p><p>in a supreme governing intelligence.  The  Esquimaux
 restore health by incantations as consciously as do civilized practitioners by their more studied methods.
 </p><p></p><p>Is civilization only a higher form of idolatry, that
 man should bow down to a flesh-brush, to flannels, to
 baths, diet, exercise, and air? Nothing save divine
 power is capable of doing so much for man as he can
 do for himself.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Rise of thought</font></p>
 The footsteps of thought, rising above material standpoints, are slow, and portend a long night to the traveller;
 but the angels of His presence--the spiritual
 intuitions that tell us when "the night is far
 spent, the day is at hand"--are our guardians in the
 gloom. Whoever opens the way in Christian Science is 
 a pilgrim and stranger, marking out the path for generations yet unborn.
 <p></p><p>The thunder of Sinai and the Sermon on the Mount
 are pursuing and will overtake the ages, rebuking in 
 their course all error and proclaiming the kingdom of 
 heaven on earth. Truth is revealed. It needs only to
 be practised.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Medical errors</font></p>
 Mortal belief is all that enables a drug to cure mortal
 ailments. Anatomy admits that mind is somewhere in
 man, though out of sight. Then, if an individual is sick, why treat the body alone and 
 administer a dose of despair to the mind? Why declare
 that the body is diseased, and picture this disease to the 
 mind, rolling it under the tongue as a sweet morsel and
 holding it before the thought of both physician and patient? We should understand that the cause of disease 
 obtains in the mortal human mind, and its cure comes 
 from the immortal divine Mind. We should prevent the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_175"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 175</font></a></p><p></p><p>images of disease from taking form in thought, and we
 should efface the outlines of disease already formulated in
 the minds of mortals.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Novel Diseases</font></p>
 When there are fewer prescriptions, and less thought is
 given to sanitary subjects, there will be better
 constitutions and less disease. In old times
 who ever heard of dyspepsia, cerebro-spinal meningitis,
 hay-fever, and rose-cold?
 <p></p><p>What an abuse of natural beauty to say that a rose,
 the smile of God, can produce suffering! The joy of its
 presence, its beauty and fragrance, should uplift the
 thought, and dissuade any sense of fear or fever. It is
 profane to fancy that the perfume of clover and the breath
 of new-mown hay can cause glandular inflammation,
 sneezing, and nasal pangs.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No ancestral dyspepsia</font></p>
 If a random thought, calling itself dyspepsia, had
 tried to tyrannize over our forefathers, it would have
 been routed by their independence and industry. Then people had less time for selfishness, coddling, and sickly after-dinner talk. The exact amount of food the stomach could digest was not
 discussed according to Cutter nor referred to sanitary
 laws. A man's belief in those days was not so severe
 upon the gastric juices. Beaumont's "Medical Experiments" did not govern the digestion.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Pulmonary misbeliefs</font></p>
 Damp atmosphere and freezing snow empurpled the
 plump cheeks of our ancestors, but they never indulged
 in the refinement of inflamed bronchial tubes.
 They were as innocent as Adam, before he ate 
 the fruit of false knowledge, of the existence of tubercles
 and troches, lungs and lozenges.
 <p></p><p><font size="1">Our modern Eves</font></p>
 "Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise," says
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_176%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 176 </font></a></p><p></p><p>the English poet, and there is truth in his sentiment. The 
 action of mortal mind on the body was not so injurious
 before inquisitive modern Eves took up the
 study of medical works and unmanly Adams 
 attributed their own downfall and the fate of their offspring to the weakness of their wives.
 </p><p></p><p>The primitive custom of taking no thought about
 food left the stomach and bowels free to act in obedience to nature, and gave the gospel a chance to be seen 
 in its glorious effects upon the body. A ghastly array of 
 diseases was not paraded before the imagination. There
 were fewer books on digestion and more "sermons in 
 stones, and good in everything." When the mechanism 
 of the human mind gives place to the divine Mind, selfishness and sin, disease and death, will lose their 
 foothold.
 </p><p></p><p>Human fear of miasma would load with disease the
 air of Eden, and weigh down mankind with superimposed 
 and conjectural evils. Mortal mind is the worst foe of 
 the body, while divine Mind is its best friend.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Diseases not to be classified</font></p>
 Should all cases of organic disease be treated by a
 regular practitioner, and the Christian Scientist try
 truth only in cases of hysteria, hypochondria, and hallucination? One disease is no
 more real than another. All disease is the
 result of education, and disease can carry its ill-effects
 no farther than mortal mind maps out the way. The 
 human mind, not matter, is supposed to feel, suffer, enjoy. Hence decided types of acute disease are quite as
 ready to yield to Truth as the less distinct type and chronic 
 form of disease. Truth handles the most malignant contagion with perfect assurance.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_177"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 177</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">One basis for all sickness</font></p>
 Human mind produces what is termed organic disease as certainly as it produces hysteria, and it must relinquish all its errors, sicknesses, and sins.
 I have demonstrated this beyond all cavil. 
 The evidence of divine Mind's healing power and absolute control is to me as certain as the evidence of my own
 existence.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental and physical oneness</font></p>
 Mortal mind and body are one. Neither exists without
 the other, and both must be destroyed by immortal Mind.
 Matter, or body, is but a false concept of mortal mind. This so-called mind builds its own
 superstructure, of which the material body is
 the grosser portion; but from first to last, the body is a
 sensuous, human concept.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The effect of names</font></p>
 In the Scriptural allegory of the material creation,
 Adam or error, which represents the erroneous theory
 of life and intelligence in matter , had the
 naming of all that was material. These names 
 indicated matter's properties, qualities, and forms. But
 a lie, the opposite of Truth, cannot name the qualities and
 effects of what is termed matter, and create the so-called
 laws of the flesh, nor can a lie hold the preponderance
 of power in any direction against God, Spirit and
 Truth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Poison defined mentally</font></p>
 If a dose of poison is swallowed through mistake, and
 the patient dies even though physician and
 patient are expecting favorable results, does
 human belief, you ask, cause this death? Even
 so, and as directly as if the poison had been intentionally
 taken.
 <p></p><p>In such cases a few persons believe the potion swallowed by the patient to be harmless, but the vast ma</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_178"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 178</font></a></p><p></p><p>jority of mankind, though they know nothing of this particular case and this special person, believe the arsenic,
 the strychnine, or whatever the drug used, to be poisonous, for it is set down as a poison by mortal mind. 
 Consequently, the result is controlled by the majority of
 opinions, not by the infinitesimal minority of opinions in 
 the sick-chamber.
 </p><p></p><p>Heredity is not a law. The remote cause or belief
 of disease is not dangerous because of its priority and 
 the connection of past mortal thoughts with present. 
 The predisposing cause and the exciting cause are
 mental.
 </p><p></p><p>Perhaps an adult has a deformity produced prior to his
 birth by the fright of his mother. When wrested from
 human belief and based on Science or the divine Mind, to
 which all things are possible, that chronic case is not 
 difficult to cure.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Animal magnetism destroyed</font></p>
 Mortal mind, acting from the basis of sensation in
 matter, is animal magnetism; but this so-called mind,
 from which comes all evil, contradicts itself,
 and must finally yield to the eternal Truth, or
 the divine Mind, expressed in Science. In proportion to our understanding of Christian Science, we are
 freed from the belief of heredity, of mind in matter or animal magnetism; and we disarm sin of its imaginary power 
 in proportion to our spiritual understanding of the status
 of immortal being.
 <p></p><p>Ignorant of the methods and the basis of metaphysical 
 healing, you may attempt to unite with it hypnotism,
 spiritualism, electricity; but none of these methods can 
 be mingled with metaphysical healing.
 </p><p></p><p>Whoever reaches the understanding of Christian Science
 </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a></p><p></p><p>in its proper signification will perform the sudden cures
 of which it is capable; but this can be done only by
 taking up the cross and following Christ in the daily
 life.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Absent patients</font></p>
 Science can heal the sick, who are absent from their
 healers, as well as those present, since space is no obstacle to Mind. Immortal Mind heals what eye  
 hath not seen; but the spiritual capacity to ap-  
 prehend thought and to heal by the Truth-power, is won 
 only as man is found, not in self-righteousness, but reflecting the divine nature.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Horses mistaught</font></p>
 Every medical method has its advocates. The preference of mortal mind for a certain method creates a demand
 for that method, and the body then seems to require such treatment. You can even educate a
 healthy horse so far in physiology that he will take cold
 without his blanket, whereas the wild animal, left to his
 instincts, sniffs the wind with delight. The epizootic is
 a humanly evolved ailment, which a wild horse might
 never have.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Medical works objectionable</font></p>
 Treatises on anatomy, physiology, and health, sustained
 by what is termed material law, are the promoters of sickness and disease. It should not
 be proverbial, that so long as you read medical works you
 will be sick.
 <p></p><p>The sedulous matron - studying her Jahr with homoeopathic pellet and powder in hand, ready to put you
 into a sweat, to move the bowels, or to produce sleep is unwittingly sowing the seeds of reliance on matter,
 and her household may erelong reap the effect of this
 mistake.
 </p><p></p><p>Descriptions of disease given by physicians and adver</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_180%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 180 </font></a></p><p></p><p>tisements of quackery are both prolific sources of sickness.
 As mortal mind is the husbandman of error, it should be
 taught to do the body no harm and to uproot its false 
 sowing.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The invalid's outlook</font></p>
 The patient sufferer tries to be satisfied when he sees
 his would-be healers busy, and his faith in their efforts is 
 somewhat helpful to them and to himself; but
 in Science one must understand the resuscitating law of Life. This is the seed within itself bearing 
 fruit after its kind, spoken of in Genesis.
 <p>Physicians should not deport themselves as if Mind
 were non-existent, nor take the ground that all causation
 is matter, instead of Mind. Ignorant that the human 
 mind governs the body, its phenomenon, the invalid may
 unwittingly add more fear to the mental reservoir already 
 overflowing with that emotion.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Wrong and right way</font></p>
 Doctors should not implant disease in the thoughts of
 their patients, as they so frequently do, by declaring disease to be a fixed fact, even before they go to
 work to eradicate the disease through the material faith which they inspire. Instead of furnishing 
 thought with fear, they should try to correct this turbulent
 element of mortal mind by the influence of divine Love
 which casteth out fear.
 <p></p><p>When man is governed by God, the ever-present
 Mind who understands all things, man knows that with
 God all things are possible. The only way to this 
 living Truth, which heals the sick, is found in the Science 
 of divine Mind as taught and demonstrated by Christ
 Jesus.
 </p><p></p><p><font size="1">The important decision</font></p>
 To reduce inflammation, dissolve a tumor, or cure organic disease, I have found divine Truth more potent than
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_181%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 181 </font></a></p><p>all lower remedies. And why not, since Mind, God, is
 the source and condition of all existence? Before deciding that the body, matter, is disordered, one 
 should ask, "Who art thou that repliest to 
 Spirit? Can matter speak for itself, or does
 it hold the issues of life?" Matter, which can neither
 suffer nor enjoy, has no partnership with pain and pleasure, but mortal belief has such a partnership.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Manipulation unscientific</font></p>
 When you manipulate patients, you trust in electricity
 and magnetism more than in Truth; and for 
 that reason, you employ matter rather than 
 Mind. You weaken or destroy your power when you resort to any except spiritual means.
 <p></p><p>It is foolish to declare that you manipulate patients but
 that you lay no stress on manipulation. If this be so, why
 manipulate? In reality you manipulate because you are
 ignorant of the baneful effects of magnetism, or are not
 sufficiently spiritual to depend on Spirit. In either case
 you must improve your mental condition till you finally
 attain the understanding of Christian Science.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Not words but deeds</font></p>
 If you are too material to love the Science of Mind and
 are satisfied with good words instead of effects, if you
 adhere to error and are afraid to trust Truth, 
 the question then recurs, "Adam, where art 
 thou?" It is unnecessary to resort to aught besides
 Mind in order to satisfy the sick that you are doing something for them, for if they are cured, they generally know
 it and are satisfied.
 <p></p><p>"Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
 If you have more faith in drugs than in Truth, this faith
 will incline you to the side of matter and error. Any
 hypnotic power you may exercise will diminish your
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_182%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 182 </font></a></p><p></p><p>ability to become a Scientist, and vice versa. The act
 of healing the sick through divine Mind alone, of casting
 out error with Truth, shows your position as a Christian
 Scientist.
 </p><p></p><p><font size="1">Physiology or Spirit</font></p>
 The demands of God appeal to thought only; but the
 claims of mortality, and what are termed laws of nature, 
 appertain to matter. Which, then, are we to
 accept as legitimate and capable of producing
 the highest human good? We cannot obey both physiology and Spirit, for one absolutely destroys the other, 
 and one or the other must be supreme in the affections.
 It is impossible to work from two standpoints. If we 
 attempt it, we shall presently "hold to the one, 
 and despise the other."
 <p></p><p>The hypotheses of mortals are antagonistic to Science 
 and cannot mix with it. This is clear to those, who heal
 the sick on the basis of Science.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No material law</font></p>
 Mind's government of the body must supersede the socalled laws of matter. Obedience to material law prevents full obedience to spiritual law,--the law
 which overcomes material conditions and puts
 matter under the feet of Mind. Mortals entreat the divine Mind to heal the sick, and forthwith shut out the aid
 of Mind by using material means, thus working against 
 themselves and their prayers and denying man's Godgiven ability to demonstrate Mind's sacred power. Pleas
 for drugs and laws of health come from some sad incident,
 or else from ignorance of Christian Science and its transcendent power.
 <p></p><p>To admit that sickness is a condition over which God 
 has no control, is to presuppose that omnipotent power 
 is powerless on some occasions. The law of Christ, or
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_183"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 183</font></a></p><p></p><p>Truth, makes all things possible to Spirit; but the socalled laws of matter would render Spirit of no avail, and
 demand obedience to materialistic codes, thus departing
 from the basis of one God, one lawmaker. To suppose
 that God constitutes laws of inharmony is a mistake; discords have no support from nature or divine law, however
 much is said to the contrary.
 </p><p></p><p>Can the agriculturist, according to belief, produce a
 crop without sowing the seed and awaiting its germination according to the laws of nature? The answer is no,
 and yet the Scriptures inform us that sin, or error, first
 caused the condemnation of man to till the ground, and
 indicate that obedience to God will remove this necessity.
 Truth never made error necessary, nor devised a law to
 perpetuate error.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Laws of nature spiritual</font></p>
 The supposed laws which result in weariness and disease are not His laws, for the legitimate and only possible
 action of Truth is the production of harmony. 
 Laws of nature are laws of Spirit; but mortals  
 commonly recognize as law that which hides the power of
 Spirit. Divine Mind rightly demands man's entire obedience, affection, and strength. No reservation is made
 for any lesser loyalty. Obedience to Truth gives man
 power and strength. Submission to error superinduces
 loss of power.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Belief and understanding</font></p>
 Truth casts out all evils and materialistic methods
 with the actual spiritual law,--the law which gives
 sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, voice  
 to the dumb, feet to the lame. If Christian 
 Science dishonors human belief, it honors spiritual understanding; and the one Mind only is entitled to
 honor.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_184%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 184 </font></a></p><p></p><p>The so-called laws of health are simply laws of mortal 
 belief. The premises being erroneous, the conclusions
 are wrong. Truth makes no laws to regulate sickness, 
 sin, and death, for these are unknown to Truth and should 
 not be recognized as reality.
 </p><p></p><p>Belief produces the results of belief, and the penalties it affixes last so long as the belief and are inseparable from it. The remedy consists in probing the trouble
 to the bottom, in finding and casting out by denial the
 error of belief which produces a mortal disorder, never 
 honoring erroneous belief with the title of law nor yielding obedience to it. Truth, Life, and Love are the only 
 legitimate and eternal demands on man, and they are 
 spiritual lawgivers, enforcing obedience through divine
 statutes.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Laws of human belief</font></p>
 Controlled by the divine intelligence, man is harmonious and eternal. Whatever is governed by a false belief
 is discordant and mortal. We say man suffers
 from the effects of cold, heat, fatigue. This
 is human belief, not the truth of being, for matter cannot
 suffer. Mortal mind alone suffers,--not because a law 
 of matter has been transgressed, but because a law of this 
 so-called mind has been disobeyed. I have demonstrated
 this as a rule of divine Science by destroying the delusion 
 of suffering from what is termed a fatally broken physical 
 law.
 <p></p><p>A woman, whom I cured of consumption, always 
 breathed with great difficulty when the wind was from
 the east. I sat silently by her side a few moments. Her 
 breath came gently. The inspirations were deep and natural. I then requested her to look at the weather-vane. 
 She looked and saw that it pointed due east. The wind
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_185"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 185</font></a></p><p></p><p>had not changed, but her thought of it had and so her difficulty in breathing had gone. The wind had not produced
 the difficulty. My metaphysical treatment changed the
 action of her belief on the lungs, and she never suffered
 again from east winds, but was restored to health.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A so-called mind-cure</font></p>
 No system of hygiene but Christian Science is purely
 mental. Before this book was published, other books
 were in circulation, which discussed "mental 
 medicine" and "mind-cure," operating through
 the power of the earth's magnetic currents to regulate life
 and health. Such theories and such systems of so-called
 mind-cure, which have sprung up, are as material as the
 prevailing systems of medicine. They have their birth
 in mortal mind, which puts forth a human conception
 in the name of Science to match the divine Science of immortal Mind, even as the necromancers of Egypt strove
 to emulate the wonders wrought by Moses. Such theories
 have no relationship to Christian Science, which rests on
 the conception of God as the only Life, substance, and
 intelligence, and excludes the human mind as a spiritual
 factor in the healing work.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Jesus and hypnotism</font></p>
 Jesus cast out evil and healed the sick, not only without drugs, but without hypnotism, which is 
 the reverse of ethical and pathological Truthpower.
 <p></p><p>Erroneous mental practice may seem for a time to benefit the sick, but the recovery is not permanent. This is
 because erroneous methods act on and through the material stratum of the human mind, called brain, which is
 but a mortal consolidation of material mentality and its
 suppositional activities.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">False stimulus</font></p>
 A patient under the influence of mortal mind is healed
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_186%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 186 </font></a></p><p></p><p>only by removing the influence on him of this mind, by
 emptying his thought of the false stimulus
 and reaction of will-power and filling it with
 the divine energies of Truth.
 </p><p></p><p>Christian Science destroys material beliefs through the
 understanding of Spirit, and the thoroughness of this work 
 determines health. Erring human mind-forces can work 
 only evil under whatever name or pretence they are employed; for Spirit and matter, good and evil, light and 
 darkness, cannot mingle.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Evil negative and self-destructive</font></p>
 Evil is a negation, because it is the absence of truth.
 It is nothing, because it is the absence of something. It
 is unreal, because it presupposes the absence 
 of God, the omnipotent and omnipresent.
 Every mortal must learn that there is neither
 power nor reality in evil.
 <p></p><p>Evil is self-assertive. It says: "I am a real entity, overmastering good." This falsehood should strip evil of all 
 pretensions. The only power of evil is to destroy itself. It 
 can never destroy one iota of good. Every attempt of evil
 to destroy good is a failure, and only aids in peremptorily 
 punishing the evil-doer. If we concede the same reality to 
 discord as to harmony, discord has as lasting a claim upon
 us as has harmony. If evil is as real as good, evil is also as 
 immortal. If death is as real as Life, immortality is a myth.
 If pain is as real as the absence of pain, both must be immortal; and if so, harmony cannot be the law of being.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ignorant idolatry</font></p>
 Mortal mind is ignorant of self, or it could never be 
 self-deceived. If mortal mind knew how to be better, it
 would be better. Since it must believe in something besides itself, it enthrones matter as deity.
 The human mind has been an idolater from the beginning,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_187"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 187</font></a></p><p></p><p>having other gods and believing in more than the one
 Mind.
 </p><p></p><p>As mortals do not comprehend even mortal existence,
 how ignorant must they be of the all-knowing Mind and
 of His creations.
 </p><p></p><p>Here you may see how so-called material sense creates
 its own forms of thought, gives them material names, and
 then worships and fears them. With pagan blindness,
 it attributes to some material god or medicine an ability
 beyond itself. The beliefs of the human mind rob and
 enslave it, and then impute this result to another illusive
 personification, named Satan.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Action of mortal mind</font></p>
 The valves of the heart, opening and closing for the passage of the blood, obey the mandate of mortal mind as directly as does the hand, admittedly moved by the will. Anatomy allows the mental
 cause of the latter action, but not of the former.
 <p></p><p>We say, "My hand hath done it." What is this my but
 mortal mind, the cause of all materialistic action? All
 voluntary, as well as miscalled involuntary, action of the
 mortal body is governed by this so-called mind, not by
 matter.  There is no involuntary action. The divine Mind
 includes all action and volition, and man in Science is governed by this Mind. The human mind tries to classify
 action as voluntary and involuntary, and suffers from the
 attempt.
 </p><p></p><p><font size="1">Death and the body</font></p>
 If you take away this erring mind, the mortal material
 body loses all appearance of life or action, and this socalled mind then calls itself dead; but the human mind still holds in belief a body, through
 which it acts and which appears to the human mind to
 live,--a body like the one it had before death. This body
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_188%20%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 188  </font></a></p><p></p><p>is put off only as the mortal, erring mind yields to God, 
 immortal Mind, and man is found in His image.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Embryonic sinful thoughts</font></p>
 What is termed disease does not exist. It is neither
 mind nor matter. The belief of sin, which has grown
 terrible in strength and influence, is an unconscious error in the beginning,--an embryonic
 thought without motive; but afterwards it
 governs the so-called man. Passion, depraved appetites,
 dishonesty, envy, hatred, revenge ripen into action, only to
 pass from shame and woe to their final punishment.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Disease a dream</font></p>
 Mortal existence is a dream of pain and pleasure in
 matter, a dream of sin, sickness, and death; and it is like
 the dream we have in sleep, in which every one
 recognizes his condition to be wholly a state of
 mind. In both the waking, and the sleeping dream, the
 dreamer thinks that his body is material and the suffering
 is in that body.
 <p></p><p>The smile of the sleeper indicates the sensation produced physically by the pleasure of a dream. In the
 same way pain and pleasure, sickness and care, are
 traced upon mortals by unmistakable signs.
 </p><p></p><p>Sickness is a growth of error, springing from mortal
 ignorance or fear. Error rehearses error. What  causes
 disease cannot cure it. The soil of disease is mortal
 mind, and you have an abundant or scanty crop of disease,
 according to the seedlings of fear.    Sin and the fear of
 disease must be uprooted and cast out.
 </p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sense yields to understanding</font></p>
 When darkness comes over  the  earth,  the  physical
 senses have no immediate evidence of a sun.
 The human eye knows not where the orb of
 day is, nor if it exists. Astronomy gives  the
 desired information regarding the sun.  The  human  or
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_189"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 189</font></a></p><p></p><p>material senses yield to the authority of this science, and
 they are willing to leave with astronomy the explanation of
 the sun's influence over the earth.  If the eyes see no sun
 for a week, we still believe that there is solar light and
 heat. Science (in this instance named natural) raises
 the human thought above the cruder theories of the
 human mind, and casts out a fear.
 </p><p></p><p>In like manner mortals should no more deny the power
 of Christian Science to establish harmony and to explain
 the effect of mortal mind on the body, though the cause
 be unseen, than they should deny the existence of the sunlight when the orb of day disappears, or doubt that the sun
 will reappear. The sins of others should not make good
 men suffer.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ascending the scale</font></p>
 We call the body material; but it is as truly mortal
 mind, according to its degree, as is the material brain
 which is supposed to furnish the evidence 
 of all mortal thought or things. The human 
 mortal mind, by an inevitable perversion, makes all
 things start from the lowest instead of from the highest
 mortal thought. The reverse is the case with all the
 formations of the immortal divine Mind. They proceed
 from the divine source; and so, in tracing them, we constantly ascend in infinite being.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Human reproduction</font></p>
 From mortal mind comes the reproduction of the
 species, - first the belief of inanimate, and then of animate matter. According to mortal thought, 
 the development of embryonic mortal mind
 commences in the lower, basal portion of the brain, and
 goes on in an ascending scale by evolution, keeping always
 in the direct line of matter, for matter is the subjective
 condition of mortal mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_190"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 190</font></a></p><p></p><p>Next we have the formation of so-called embryonic
 mortal mind, afterwards mortal men or mortals,--all this
 while matter is a belief, ignorant of itself, ignorant of what
 it is supposed to produce. The mortal says that an inanimate unconscious seedling is producing mortals, both body
 and mind; and yet neither a mortal mind nor the immortal
 Mind is found in brain or elsewhere in matter or in mortals.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Human stature</font></p>
 This embryonic and materialistic human belief called
 mortal man in turn fills itself with thoughts
 of pain and pleasure, of life and death, and 
 arranges itself into five so-called senses, which presently
 measure mind by the size of a brain and the bulk of a 
 body, called man.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Human frailty</font></p>
 Human birth, growth, maturity, and decay are as the
 grass springing from the soil with beautiful green blades,
 afterwards to wither and return to its native
 nothingness. This mortal seeming is temporal;
 it never merges into immortal being, but finally disappears, and immortal man, spiritual and eternal, is found 
 to be the real man.
 <p></p><p>The Hebrew bard, swayed by mortal thoughts, thus 
 swept his lyre with saddening strains on human existence:
 </p><p></p><p>   As for man, his days are as grass:<br>
    As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.<br>
    For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;<br>
    And the place thereof shall know it no more.<br>
 </p><p></p><p>When hope rose higher in the human heart, he sang:
 </p><p></p><p>  As for me, I will behold Thy face in righteousness:<br>
   I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness.<br>
       . . . . .<br>
   For with Thee is the fountain of life;<br>
   In Thy light shall we see light.<br>
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_191"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 191</font></a></p><p></p><p>The brain can give no idea of God's man. It can take
 no cognizance of Mind. Matter is not the organ of infinite Mind.
 </p><p></p><p>As mortals give up the delusion that there is more than
 one Mind, more than one God, man in God's likeness will
 appear, and this eternal man will include in that likeness
 no material element.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The immortal birth</font></p>
 As a material, theoretical life-basis is found to be a
 misapprehension of existence, the spiritual and divine
 Principle of man dawns upon human thought,
 and leads it to "where the young child was,"
 - even to the birth of a new-old idea, to the spiritual
 sense of being and of what Life includes. This the whole
 earth will be transformed by Truth on its pinions of light,
 chasing away the darkness of error.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual freedom</font></p>
 The human thought must free itself from self-imposed
 materiality and bondage. It should no longer 
 ask of the head, heart, or lungs: What are 
 man's prospects for life? Mind is not helpless. Intelligence is not mute before non-intelligence.
 <p></p><p>By its own volition, not a blade of grass springs up, not
 a spray buds within the vale, not a leaf unfolds its fair
 outlines, not a flower starts from its cloistered cell.
 </p><p></p><p>The Science of being reveals man and immortality as
 based on Spirit. Physical sense defines mortal man as
 based on matter, and from this premise infers the mortality of the body.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No physical affinity</font></p>
 The illusive senses may fancy affinities with their opposites; but in Christian Science, Truth never mingles
 with error. Mind has no affinity with matter,
 and therefore Truth is able to cast out the ills
 of the flesh. Mind, God, sends forth the aroma of Spirit,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_192"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 192</font></a></p><p></p><p>the atmosphere of intelligence. The belief that a pulpy 
 substance under the skull is mind is a mockery of intelligence, a mimicry of Mind.
 </p><p></p><p>We are Christian Scientists, only as we quit our reliance 
 upon that which is false and grasp the true. We are not 
 Christian Scientists until we leave all for Christ. Human 
 opinions are not spiritual. They come from the hearing 
 of the ear, from corporeality instead of from Principle,
 and from the mortal instead of from the immortal. Spirit 
 is not separate from God. Spirit is God.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Human power a blind force</font></p>
 Erring power is a material belief, a blind miscalled force,
 the offspring of will and not of wisdom, of the mortal mind 
 and not of the immortal. It is the headlong 
 cataract, the devouring flame, the tempest's
 breath. It is lightning and hurricane, all that is selfish, 
 wicked, dishonest, and impure.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The one real power</font></p>
 Moral and spiritual might belong to Spirit, who holds
 the "wind in His fists;" and this teaching accords with
 Science and harmony. In Science, you can
 have no power opposed to God, and the physical senses must give up their false testimony. Your influence for good depends upon the weight you throw into 
 the right scale. The good you do and embody gives you
 the only power obtainable. Evil is not power. It is a 
 mockery of strength, which erelong betrays its weakness 
 and falls, never to rise.
 <p></p><p>We walk in the footsteps of Truth and Love by following the example of our Master in the understanding of 
 divine metaphysics. Christianity is the basis of true healing. Whatever holds human thought in line with unselfed 
 love, receives directly the divine power.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind cures hip-disease</font></p>
 I was called to visit Mr. Clark in Lynn, who had been
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_193"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 193</font></a></p><p></p><p>confined to his bed six months with hip-disease, caused by
 a fall upon a wooden spike when quite a boy. On entering the house I met his physician, who said that 
 the patient was dying. The physician had just
 probed the ulcer on the hip, and said the bone was carious
 for several inches. He even showed me the probe, which
 had on it the evidence of this condition of the bone. The
 doctor went out. Mr. Clark lay with his eyes fixed and
 sightless. The dew of death was on his brow. I went to
 his bedside. In a few moments his face changed; its
 death-pallor gave place to a natural hue. The eyelids
 closed gently and the breathing became natural; he was
 asleep. In about ten minutes he opened his eyes and
 said: "I feel like a new man. My suffering is all gone."
 It was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon
 when this took place.
 </p><p></p><p>I told him to rise, dress himself, and take supper with
 his family. He did so. The next day I saw him in the
 yard. Since then I have not seen him, but am informed
 that he went to work in two weeks. The discharge from
 the sore stopped, and the sore was healed. The diseased
 condition had continued there ever since the injury was
 received in boyhood.
 </p><p></p><p>Since his recovery I have been informed that his physician claims to have cured him, and that his mother has
 been threatened with incarceration in an insane asylum
 for saying: "It was none other than God and that woman
 who healed him." I cannot attest the truth of that 
 report, but what I saw and did for that man, and what 
 his physician said of the case, occurred just as I have
 narrated.
 </p><p></p><p>It has been demonstrated to me that Life is God
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a></p><p></p><p>and that the might of omnipotent Spirit shares not its
 strength with matter or with human will. Reviewing this brief experience, I cannot fail to discern the 
 coincidence of the spiritual idea of man with the divine 
 Mind.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Change of belief</font></p>
 A change in human belief changes all the physical symptoms, and determines a case for better or for
 worse. When one's false belief is corrected
 Truth sends a report of health over the body.
 <p></p><p>Destruction of the auditory nerve and paralysis of the
 optic nerve are not necessary to ensure deafness and blindness; for if mortal mind says, "I am deaf and blind," it 
 will be so without an injured nerve. Every theory opposed to this fact (as I learned in metaphysics) would
 presuppose man, who is immortal in spiritual understanding, a mortal in material belief.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Power of habit</font></p>
 The authentic history of Kaspar Hauser is a useful hint
 as to the frailty and inadequacy of mortal mind. It 
 proves beyond a doubt that education constitutes this so-called mind, and that, in turn,
 mortal mind manifests itself in the body by the false 
 sense it imparts. Incarcerated in a dungeon, where 
 neither sight nor sound could reach him, at the age of
 seventeen Kaspar was still a mental infant, crying and 
 chattering with no more intelligence than a babe, and 
 realizing Tennyson's description:
 <p></p><p>      An infant crying in the night,<br>
       An infant crying for the light,<br>
       And with no language but a cry.<br>
 </p><p></p><p>His case proves material sense to be but a belief formed
 by education alone. The light which affords us joy gave
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_195"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 195</font></a></p><p></p><p>him a belief of intense pain. His eyes were inflamed by
 the light. After the babbling boy had been taught to
 speak a few words, he asked to be taken back to his dungeon, and said that he should never be happy elsewhere.
 Outside of dismal darkness and cold silence he found no
 peace. Every sound convulsed him with anguish. All
 that he ate, except his black crust, produced violent
 retchings. All that gives pleasure to our educated senses
 gave him pain through those very senses, trained in an
 opposite direction.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Useful knowledge</font></p>
 The point for each one to decide is, whether it is mortal
 mind or immortal Mind that is causative. We 
 should forsake the basis of matter for metaphysical Science and its divine Principle.
 <p></p><p>Whatever furnishes the semblance of an idea governed
 by its Principle, furnishes food for thought. Through astronomy, natural history, chemistry, music, mathematics,
 thought passes naturally from effect back to cause.
 </p><p></p><p>Academics of the right sort are requisite. Observation, invention, study, and original thought are expansive
 and should promote the growth of mortal mind out of itself, out of all that is mortal.
 </p><p></p><p>It is the tangled barbarisms of learning which we
 deplore,--the mere dogma, the speculative theory, the
 nauseous fiction. Novels, remarkable only for their
 exaggerated pictures, impossible ideals, and specimens
 of depravity, fill our young readers with wrong tastes
 and sentiments. Literary commercialism is lowering the
 intellectual standard to accommodate the purse and to
 meet a frivolous demand for amusement instead of for
 improvement. Incorrect views lower the standard of 
 truth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a></p><p></p><p>If materialistic knowledge is power, it is not wisdom.
 It is but a blind force. Man has "sought out many inventions," but he has not yet found it true that knowledge can 
 save him from the dire effects of knowledge. The power 
 of mortal mind over its own body is little understood.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sin destroyed through suffering</font></p>
 Better the suffering which awakens mortal mind from
 its fleshly dream, than the false pleasures
 which tend to perpetuate this dream. Sin
 alone brings death, for sin is the only element
 of destruction.
 <p></p><p>"Fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body
 in hell," said Jesus. A careful study of this text allows 
 that here the word soul means a false sense or material 
 consciousness. The command was a warning to beware,
 not of Rome, Satan, nor of God, but of sin. Sickness, 
 sin, and death are not concomitants of Life or Truth. 
 No law supports them. They have no relation to God
 wherewith to establish their power. Sin makes its own 
 hell, and goodness its own heaven.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Dangerous shoals avoided</font></p>
 Such books as will rule disease out of mortal mind, and so efface the images and thoughts of disease, instead of impressing them with forcible
 descriptions and medical details,--will help
 to abate sickness and to destroy it.
 <p></p><p>Many a hopeless case of disease is induced by a single
 post mortem examination,--not from infection nor from
 contact with material virus, but from the fear of the 
 disease and from the image brought before the mind; it 
 is a mental state, which is afterwards outlined on the
 body.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Pangs caused by the press</font></p>
 The press unwittingly sends forth many sorrows and
 diseases among the human family. It does this by giv<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_197"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 197</font></a></p><p></p><p>ing names to diseases and by printing long descriptions
 which mirror images of disease distinctly in thought. A
 new name for an ailment affects people like a 
 Parisian name for a novel garment. Every one 
 hastens to get it. A minutely described disease costs many a man his earthly days of comfort. What
 a price for human knowledge! But the price does not exceed the original cost. God said of the tree of knowledge,
 which bears the fruit of sin, disease, and death, "In the
 day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Higher standard for mortals</font></p>
 The less that is said of physical structure and laws, and
 the more that is thought and said about moral 
 and spiritual law, the higher will be the standard of living and the farther mortals will be removed from imbecility or disease.
 <p></p><p>We should master fear, instead of cultivating it. It
 was the ignorance of our forefathers in the departments
 of knowledge now broadcast in the earth, that made them
 hardier than our trained physiologists, more honest than
 our sleek politicians.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Diet and dyspepsia</font></p>
 We are told that the simple food our forefathers ate
 helped to make them healthy, but that is a mistake.
 Their diet would not cure dyspepsia at this
 period. With rules of health in the head 
 and the most digestible food in the stomach, there would 
 still be dyspeptics. Many of the effeminate constitutions 
 of our time will never grow robust until individual opinions improve and immortal belief loses some portion of its 
 error.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Harm done by physicians</font></p>
 The doctor's mind reaches that of his patient. The 
 doctor should suppress his fear of disease, else his belief 
 in its reality and fatality will harm his patients even more
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_198"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 198</font></a></p><p></p><p>than his calomel and morphine, for the higher stratum of 
 mortal mind has in belief more power to harm man than
 the substratum, matter. A patient hears the
 doctor's verdict as a criminal hears his deathsentence. The patient may seem calm under it, but he is
 not. His fortitude may sustain him, but his fear, which 
 has already developed the disease that is gaining the 
 mastery, is increased by the physician's words.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Disease depicted</font></p>
 The materialistic doctor, though humane, is an artist who outlines his thought relative to disease, and then 
 fills in his delineations with sketches from textbooks. It is better to prevent disease from 
 forming in mortal mind afterwards to appear on the 
 body; but to do this requires attention. The thought of
 disease is formed before one sees a doctor and before 
 the doctor undertakes to dispel it by a counter-irritant,
 - perhaps by a blister, by the application of caustic or
 croton oil, or by a surgical operation. Again, giving another direction to faith, the physician prescribes drugs, 
 until the elasticity of mortal thought haply causes a
 vigorous reaction upon itself, and reproduces a picture 
 of healthy and harmonious formations.
 <p></p><p>A patient's belief is more or less moulded and formed
 by his doctor's belief in the case, even though the doctor 
 says nothing to support his theory. His thoughts and his 
 patient's commingle, and the stronger thoughts rule the
 weaker. Hence the importance that doctors be Christian 
 Scientists.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind over matter</font></p>
 Because the muscles of the blacksmith's arm are
 strongly developed, it does not follow that
 exercise has produced this result or that a
 less used arm must be weak. If matter were the cause
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_199"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 199</font></a></p><p></p><p>of action, and if muscles, without volition of mortal
 mind, could lift the hammer and strike the anvil, it
 might be thought true that hammering would enlarge
 the muscles. The trip-hammer is not increased in size
 by exercise. Why not, since muscles are as material as
 wood and iron? Because nobody believes that mind is
 producing such a result on the hammer.
 </p><p></p><p>Muscles are not self-acting. If mind does not move
 them, they are motionless. Hence the great fact that
 Mind alone enlarges and empowers man through its
 mandate,--by reason of its demand for and supply of
 power. Not because of muscular exercise, but by reason of the blacksmith's faith in exercise, his arm becomes
 stronger.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Latent fear subdued</font></p>
 Mortals develop their own bodies or make them sick,
 according as they influence them through mortal mind.
 To know whether this development is produced 
 consciously or unconsciously, is of less importance than a knowledge of the fact. The feats of the gymnast prove that latent mental fears are subdued by him.
 The devotion of thought to an honest achievement makes
 the achievement possible. Exceptions only confirm this
 rule, proving that failure is occasioned by a too feeble
 faith.
 <p></p><p>Had Blondin believed it impossible to walk the rope
 over Niagara's abyss of waters, he could never have
 done it. His belief that he could do it gave his thoughtforces, called muscles, their flexibility and power which
 the unscientific might attribute to a lubricating oil. His
 fear must have disappeared before his power of putting
 resolve into action could appear.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Homer and Moses</font></p>
 When Homer sang of the Grecian gods, Olympus was
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_200"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 200</font></a></p><p></p><p>dark, but through his verse the gods became alive in a 
 nation's belief. Pagan worship began with muscularity,
 but the law of Sinai lifted thought into the 
 song of David. Moses advanced a nation to 
 the worship of God in Spirit instead of matter, and illustrated the grand human capacities of being bestowed 
 by immortal Mind.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A mortal not man</font></p>
 Whoever is incompetent to explain Soul would be wise
 not to undertake the explanation of body. Life is, always
 has been, and ever will be independent of
 matter; for life is God, and man is the idea
 of God, not formed materially but spiritually, and not 
 subject to decay and dust. The Psalmist said: "Thou 
 madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy
 hands. Thou hast put all things under his feet."
 <p></p><p>The great truth in the Science of being, that the real 
 man was, is, and ever shall be perfect, is incontrovertible;
 for if man is the image, reflection, of God, he is neither 
 inverted nor subverted, but upright and Godlike.
 </p><p></p><p>The suppositional antipode of divine infinite Spirit
 is the so-called human soul or spirit, in other words 
 the five senses,--the flesh that warreth against Spirit.
 These so called material senses must yield to the infinite
 Spirit, named God.
 </p><p></p><p>St. Paul said: "For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
 (I Cor. ii. 2.) Christian Science says: I am determined 
 not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and 
 him glorified.
