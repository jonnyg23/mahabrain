 <h1 align="CENTER">Chapter XI - Some Objections Answered</h1>
 <p></p><p><a name="pg_341"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 341</font></a></p><p></p><p>And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?--JESUS.
 </p><p>But if the spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His spirit that dwelleth in you.--PAUL.
 </p><p></p><p>THE strictures on this volume would condemn to
 oblivion the truth, which is raising up thousands
 from helplessness to strength and elevating them from
 a theoretical to a practical Christianity. These criticisms
 are generally based on detached sentences or clauses separated from their context. Even the Scriptures, which
 grow in beauty and consistency from one grand root, appear contradictory when subjected to such usage. Jesus
 said, "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see 
 God" [Truth].
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Supported by facts</font></p>
 In Christian Science mere opinion is valueless. Proof
 is essential to a due estimate of this subject. Sneers at
 the application of the word Science to Christianity cannot prevent that from being scientific which is based on divine Principle, demonstrated according to a divine given rule, and subjected to proof.
 The facts are so absolute and numerous in support of
 Christian Science, that misrepresentation and denuncia<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_342%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 342 </font></a></p><p></p><p>tion cannot overthrow it. Paul alludes to "doubtful disputations." The hour has struck when proof and demonstration, instead of opinion and dogma, are summoned to
 the support of Christianity, "making wise the simple."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Commands of Jesus</font></p>
 In the result of some unqualified condemnations of
 scientific Mind-healing, one may see with sorrow the sad
 effects on the sick of denying Truth. He that
 decries this Science does it presumptuously,
 in the face of Bible history and in defiance of the direct
 command of Jesus, "Go ye into all the world, and preach
 the gospel," to which command was added the promise
 that his students should cast out evils and heal the sick.
 He bade the seventy disciples, as well as the twelve,
 heal the sick in any town where they should be hospitably
 received.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Christianity scientific</font></p>
 If Christianity is not scientific, and Science is not of
 God, then there is no invariable law, and truth becomes
 an accident. Shall it be denied that a system
 which works according to the Scriptures has
 Scriptural authority?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Argument of good works</font></p>
 Christian Science awakens the sinner, reclaims the
 infidel, and raises from the couch of pain the helpless
 invalid. It speaks to the dumb the words of
 Truth, and they answer with rejoicing. It
 causes the deaf to hear, the lame to walk, and the blind
 to see. Who would be the first to disown the Christliness of good works, when our Master says, "By their
 fruits ye shall know them"?
 <p></p><p>If Christian Scientists were teaching or practising
 pharmacy or obstetrics according to the common theories, no denunciations would follow them, even if their
 treatment resulted in the death of a patient. The people
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_343"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 343</font></a></p><p></p><p>are taught in such cases to say, Amen. Shall I then be 
 smitten for healing and for teaching Truth as the Principle of healing, and for proving my word by my deed? 
 James said: "Show me thy faith without thy works, and
 I will show thee my faith by my works."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Personal experience</font></p>
 Is not finite mind ignorant of God's method? This 
 makes it doubly unfair to impugn and misrepresent the
 facts, although, without this cross-bearing, 
 one might not be able to say with the apostle, 
 "None of these things move me." The sick, the halt,
 and the blind look up to Christian Science with blessings,
 and Truth will not be forever hidden by unjust parody 
 from the quickened sense of the people.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Proof from miracles</font></p>
 Jesus strips all disguise from error, when his teachings
 are fully understood. By parable and argument he explains the impossibility of good producing evil; 
 and he also scientifically demonstrates this great 
 fact, proving by what are wrongly called miracles, that 
 sin, sickness, and death are beliefs - illusive errors which he could and did destroy.
 <p></p><p>It would sometimes seem as if truth were rejected because meekness and spirituality are the conditions of its
 acceptance, while Christendom generally demands so
 much less.           
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Example of the disciples</font></p>
 Anciently those apostles who were Jesus' students,
 as well as Paul who was not one of his students, healed
 the sick and reformed the sinner by their 
 religion. Hence the mistake which allows 
 words, rather than works, to follow such examples!
 Whoever is the first meekly and conscientiously to press 
 along the line of gospel-healing, is often accounted a
 heretic.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_344%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 344 </font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Strong position</font></p>
 It is objected to Christian Science that it claims God
 as the only absolute Life and Soul, and man to be His
 idea,--that is, His image. It should be
 added that this is claimed to represent the
 normal, healthful, and sinless condition of man in divine
 Science, and that this claim is made because the Scriptures say that God has created man in His own image
 and after His likeness. Is it sacrilegious to assume that
 God's likeness is not found in matter, sin, sickness, and
 death?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Efficacy may be attested</font></p>
 Were it more fully understood that Truth heals and
 that error causes disease, the opponents of a demonstrable
 Science would perhaps mercifully withhold
 their misrepresentations, which harm the sick;
 and until the enemies of Christian Science test its efficacy
 according to the rules which disclose its merits or demerits, it would be just to observe the Scriptural precept,
 "Judge not."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The one divine method</font></p>
 There are various methods of treating disease, which
 are not included in the commonly accepted systems; but
 there is only one which should be presented
 to the whole world, and that is the Christian
 Science which Jesus preached and practised and left to us
 as his rich legacy.
 <p></p><p>Why should one refuse to investigate this method
 of treating disease? Why support the popular systems
 of medicine, when the physician may perchance be an
 infidel and may lose ninety-and-nine patients, while
 Christian Science cures its hundred?  Is it because
 allopathy and homoeopathy are more  fashionable and
 less spiritual?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Omnipotence set forth</font></p>
 In the Bible the word Spirit is so commonly applied
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_345"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 345</font></a></p><p></p><p>to Deity, that Spirit and God are often regarded as synonymous terms; and it is thus they are uniformly used
 and understood in Christian Science. As it 
 is evident that the likeness of Spirit cannot be 
 material, does it not follow that God cannot be in His
 unlikeness and work through drugs to heal the sick? 
 When the omnipotence of God is preached and His absoluteness is set forth, Christian sermons will heal the
 sick.          
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Contradictions not found</font></p>
 It is sometimes said, in criticising Christian Science,
 that the mind which contradicts itself neither knows
 itself nor what it is saying. It is indeed no
 small matter to know one's self; but in this 
 volume of mine there are no contradictory 
 statements,--at least none which are apparent to those 
 who understand its propositions well enough to pass
 judgment upon them. One who understands Christian
 Science can heal the sick on the divine Principle of Christian Science, and this practical proof is the only feasible
 evidence that one does understand this Science.
 <p></p><p>Anybody, who is able to perceive the incongruity between God's idea and poor humanity, ought to be able
 to discern the distinction (made by Christian Science)
 between God's man, made in His image, and the sinning 
 race of Adam.
 </p><p></p><p>The apostle says: "For if a man think himself to be
 something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself." 
 This thought of human, material nothingness, which
 Science inculcates, enrages the carnal mind and is the
 main cause of the carnal mind's antagonism. 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">God's idea the ideal man    </font></p>
 It is not the purpose of Christian Science to "educate
 the idea of God, or treat it for disease," as is alleged
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_346%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 346 </font></a></p><p></p><p>by one critic. I regret that such criticism confounds man
 with Adam.  When man is spoken of as made in God's
 image, it is not sinful and sickly mortal man
 who is referred to, but the ideal man, reflecting
 God's likeness.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Nothingness of error</font></p>
 It is sometimes said that Christian Science teaches the
 nothingness of sin, sickness, and death, and then teaches
 how this nothingness is to be saved and healed.
 The nothingness of nothing is plain; but we
 need to understand that error is nothing, and that its
 nothingness is not saved, but must be demonstrated in
 order to prove the somethingness - yea, the allness of Truth. It is self-evident that we are harmonious only
 as we cease to manifest evil or the belief that we suffer
 from the sins of others. Disbelief in error destroys error,
 and leads to the discernment of Truth. There are no
 vacuums. How then can this demonstration be "fraught
 with falsities painful to behold"?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Truth antidotes error</font></p>
 We treat error through the understanding of Truth,
 because Truth is error's antidote. If a dream ceases, it
 is self-destroyed, and the terror is over. When
 a sufferer is convinced that there is no reality
 in his belief of pain,--because matter has no sensation,
 hence pain in matter is a false belief,--how can he suffer
 longer? Do you feel the pain of tooth-pulling, when you
 believe that nitrous-oxide gas has made you unconscious?
 Yet, in your concept, the tooth, the operation, and the
 forceps are unchanged.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Serving two masters</font></p>
 Material beliefs must be expelled to make room for
 spiritual understanding. We cannot serve both
 God and mammon at the same time; but is
 not this what frail mortals are trying to do? Paul says:
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_347"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 347</font></a></p><p></p><p>"The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against 
 the flesh." Who is ready to admit this?
 </p><p></p><p>It is said by one critic, that to verify this wonderful 
 philosophy Christian Science declares that whatever is
 mortal or discordant has no origin, existence, nor realness. Nothing really has Life but God, who is infinite 
 Life; hence all is Life, and death has no dominion. This
 writer infers that if anything needs to be doctored, it
 must be the one God, or Mind. Had he stated his syllogism correctly, the conclusion would be that there is nothing left to be doctored.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Essential element of Christianity</font></p>
 Critics should consider that the so-called mortal man
 is not the reality of man. Then they would behold the
 signs of Christ's coming. Christ, as the spiritual or true idea of God, comes now as of 
 old, preaching the gospel to the poor, healing the sick, and casting out evils.  Is it error which
 is restoring an essential element of Christianity, namely, apostolic, divine healing? No; it is the Science
 of Christianity which is restoring it, and is the light
 shining in darkness, which the darkness comprehends
 not.
 <p>If Christian Science takes away the popular gods, sin, sickness, and death, - it is Christ, Truth, who destroys these evils, and so proves their nothingness.
 </p><p></p><p>The dream that matter and error are something
 must yield to reason and revelation.  Then  mortals 
 will behold the nothingness of sickness and sin, and
 sin and sickness will disappear from consciousness.
 The harmonious will appear real, and   the  inharmonious unreal. These critics will then see that error
 is indeed the nothingness, which they chide us for
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_348%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 348 </font></a></p><p></p><p>naming nothing and which we desire neither to honor
 nor to fear.
 </p><p></p><p>Medical theories virtually admit the nothingness of
 hallucinations, even while treating them as disease; and
 who objects to this? Ought we not, then, to approve
 any cure, which is effected by making the disease appear
 to be--what it really is--an illusion?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">All disease a delusion</font></p>
 Here is the difficulty: it is not generally understood how
 one disease can be just as much a delusion as another. It
 is a pity that the medical faculty and clergy
 have not learned this, for Jesus established
 this foundational fact, when devils, delusions, were cast
 out and the dumb spake.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Elimination of sickness</font></p>
 Are we irreverent towards sin, or imputing too much
 power to God, when we ascribe to Him almighty Life
 and Love? I deny His cooperation with evil,
 because I desire to have no faith in evil or in
 any power but God, good. Is it not well to eliminate from
 so-called mortal mind that which, so long as it remains in
 mortal mind, will show itself in forms of sin, sickness, and
 death? Instead of tenaciously defending the supposed
 rights of disease, while complaining of the suffering, disease brings, would it not be well to abandon the defence,
 especially when by so doing our own condition can be improved and that of other persons as well?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Full fruitage yet to come</font></p>
 I have never supposed the world would immediately
 witness the full fruitage of Christian Science, or that sin,
 disease, and death would not be believed for
 an indefinite time; but this I do aver, that,
 as a result of teaching Christian Science, ethics and
 temperance have received all impulse, health has been
 restored, and longevity increased. If such are the pres<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_349"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 349</font></a></p><p></p><p>ent fruits, what will the harvest be, when this Science is
 more generally understood?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Law and gospel</font></p>
 As Paul asked of the unfaithful in ancient days, so 
 the rabbis of the present day ask concerning our healing and teaching, "Through breaking the law,
 dishonorest thou God?" We have the gospel,  
 however, and our Master annulled material law by healing contrary to it. We propose to follow the Master's
 example. We should subordinate material law to spiritual law. Two essential points of Christian Science are,
 that neither Life nor man dies, and that God is not the
 author of sickness.   
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Language inadequate      </font></p>
 The chief difficulty in conveying the teachings of divine
 Science accurately to human thought lies in this, that like
 all other languages, English is inadequate to
 the expression of spiritual conceptions and 
 propositions, because one is obliged to use material terms
 in dealing with spiritual ideas. The elucidation of Christian Science lies in its spiritual sense, and this sense must
 be gained by its disciples in order to grasp the meaning of
 this Science. Out of this condition grew the prophecy
 concerning the Christian apostles, "They shall speak with
 new tongues."
 <p></p><p>Speaking of the things of Spirit while dwelling on 
 a material plane, material terms must be generally employed. Mortal thought does not at once catch the
 higher meaning, and can do so only as thought is educated up to spiritual apprehension. To a certain extent
 this is equally true of all learning, even that which is
 wholly material.     
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Substance spiritual     </font></p>
 In Christian Science, substance is understood to be
 Spirit, while the opponents of Christian Science believe
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_350"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 350</font></a></p><p></p><p>substance to be matter. They think of matter as something and almost the only thing, and of the things which
 pertain to Spirit as next to nothing, or as very
 far removed from daily experience. Christian
 Science takes exactly the opposite view.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Both words and works</font></p>
 To understand all our Master's sayings as recorded
 in the New Testament, sayings infinitely important,
 his followers must grow into that stature of
 manhood in Christ Jesus which enables them
 to interpret his spiritual meaning. Then they know
 how Truth casts out error and heals the sick. His
 words were the offspring of his deeds, both of which
 must be understood.  Unless the works are comprehended which his words explained, the words are
 blind.
 <p></p><p>The Master often refused to explain his words, because
 it was difficult in a material age to apprehend spiritual
 Truth. He said: "This people's heart is waxed gross,
 and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they
 have closed; lest at any time they should see with their
 eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand
 with their heart, and should be converted, and I should
 heal them."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The divine life-link</font></p>
 "The Word was made flesh." Divine Truth must be
 known by its effects on the body as well as on the mind,
 before the Science of being can be demonstrated. Hence its embodiment in the incarnate Jesus,--that life-link forming the connection through
 which the real reaches the unreal, Soul rebukes sense, and
 Truth destroys error.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Truth a present help</font></p>
 In Jewish worship the Word was materially explained,
 and the spiritual sense was scarcely perceived. The
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_351"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 351</font></a></p><p></p><p>religion which sprang from half-hidden Israelitish history
 was pedantic and void of healing power. When we lose
 faith in God's power to heal, we distrust the
 divine Principle which demonstrates Christian  
 Science, and then we cannot heal the sick. Neither can
 we heal through the help of Spirit, if we plant ourselves
 on a material basis.
 </p><p></p><p>The author became a member of the orthodox Congregational Church in early years. Later she learned 
 that her own prayers failed to heal her as did the prayers
 of her devout parents and the church; but when the
 spiritual sense of the creed was discerned in the Science 
 of Christianity, this spiritual sense was a present help. It
 was the living, palpitating presence of Christ, Truth, which
 healed the sick.      
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Fatal premises    </font></p>
 We cannot bring out the practical proof of Christianity,
 which Jesus required, while error seems as potent and
 real to us as Truth, and while we make a personal devil and an anthropomorphic God our  
 starting-points,--especially if we consider Satan as a
 being coequal in power with Deity, if not superior to Him. 
 Because such starting-points are neither spiritual nor
 scientific, they cannot work out the Spirit-rule of Christian
 healing, which proves the nothingness of error, discord, 
 by demonstrating the all-inclusiveness of harmonious
 Truth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Fruitless worship</font></p>
 The Israelites centred their thoughts on the material 
 in their attempted worship of the spiritual. To them
 matter was substance, and Spirit was shadow. 
 They thought to worship Spirit from a material standpoint, but this was impossible. They might
 appeal to Jehovah, but their prayer brought down no
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_352%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 352 </font></a></p><p></p><p>proof that it was heard, because they did not sufficiently
 understand God to be able to demonstrate His power
 to heal,--to make harmony the reality and discord the
 unreality.
 </p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spirit the tangible</font></p>
 Our Master declared that his material body was not
 spirit, evidently considering it a mortal and material belief of flesh and bones, whereas the Jews took
 a diametrically opposite view. To Jesus, not
 materiality, but spirituality, was the reality of man's existence, while to the rabbis the spiritual was the intangible and uncertain, if not the unreal.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ghosts not realities</font></p>
 Would a mother say to her child, who is frightened at
 imaginary ghosts and sick in consequence of the fear:
 "I know that ghosts are real. They exist,
 and are to be feared; but you must not be
 afraid of them"?
 <p></p><p>Children, like adults, ought to fear a reality which
 can harm them and which they do not understand, for
 at any moment they may become its helpless victims;
 but instead of increasing children's fears by declaring
 ghosts to be real, merciless, and powerful, thus watering the very roots of childish timidity, children should
 be assured that their fears are groundless, that ghosts
 are not realities, but traditional beliefs, erroneous and
 man-made.
 </p><p></p><p>In short, children should be told not to believe in ghosts,
 because there are no such things. If belief in their reality
 is destroyed, terror of ghosts will depart and health be restored. The objects of alarm will then vanish into nothingness, no longer seeming worthy of fear or honor. To
 accomplish a good result, it is certainly not irrational to
 tell the truth about ghosts.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_353"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 353</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The real and the unreal</font></p>
 The Christianly scientific real is the sensuous unreal. 
 Sin, disease, whatever seems real to material sense, is unreal in divine Science. The physical senses 
 and Science have ever been antagonistic, and
 they will so continue, till the testimony of the physical
 senses yields entirely to Christian Science.  
   
 How can a Christian, having the stronger evidence of
 Truth which contradicts the evidence of error, think of
 the latter as real or true, either in the form of sickness or 
 of sin? All must admit that Christ is "the way, the
 truth, and the life," and that omnipotent Truth certainly
 does destroy error.         
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Superstition obsolete </font></p>
 The age has not wholly outlived the sense of ghostly
 beliefs. It still holds them more or less. Time has not
 yet reached eternity, immortality, complete 
 reality. All the real is eternal. Perfection 
 underlies reality. Without perfection, nothing is wholly
 real. All things will continue to disappear, until per-  
 fection appears and reality is reached. We must give up
 the spectral at all points. We must not continue to admit
 the somethingness of superstition, but we must yield up 
 all belief in it and be wise. When we learn that error
 is not real, we shall be ready for progress, "forgetting
 those things which are behind."       
 <p></p><p>The grave does not banish the ghost of materiality.
 So long as there are supposed limits to Mind, and those
 limits are human, so long will ghosts seem to continue. 
 Mind is limitless. It never was material. The true idea
 of being is spiritual and immortal, and from this it follows
 that whatever is laid off is the ghost, some unreal belief. 
 Mortal beliefs can neither demonstrate Christianity nor
 apprehend the reality of Life.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_354"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 354</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Christian warfare</font></p>
 Are the protests of Christian Science against the notion
 that there can be material life, substance, or mind "utter
 falsities and absurdities," as some aver? Why
 then do Christians try to obey the Scriptures
 and war against "the world, the flesh, and the devil"?
 Why do they invoke the divine aid to enable them to leave
 all for Christ, Truth? Why do they use this phraseology,
 and yet deny Christian Science, when it teaches precisely
 this thought? The words of divine Science find their
 immortality in deeds, for their Principle heals the sick
 and spiritualizes humanity.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Healing omitted</font></p>
 On the other hand, the Christian opponents of Christian Science neither give nor offer any proofs that their
 Master's religion can heal the sick. Surely
 it is not enough to cleave to barren and desultory dogmas, derived from the traditions of the elders who
 thereunto have set their seals.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific consistency</font></p>
 Consistency is seen in example more than in precept.
 Inconsistency is shown by words without deeds, which
 are like clouds without rain.  If our words
 fail to express our deeds, God will redeem that
 weakness, and out of the mouth of babes He will perfect
 praise. The night of materiality is far spent, and with
 the dawn Truth will waken men spiritually to hear and
 to speak the new tongue.
 <p></p><p>Sin should become unreal to every one. It is in itself
 inconsistent, a divided kingdom. Its supposed realism
 has no divine authority, and I rejoice in the apprehension
 of this grand verity.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual meaning</font></p>
 The opponents of divine Science must be
 charitable, if they would be Christian.  If the
 letter of Christian Science appears inconsistent, they should
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_355"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 355</font></a></p><p></p><p>gain the spiritual meaning of Christian Science, and then 
 the ambiguity will vanish.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Practical arguments</font></p>
 The charge of inconsistency in Christianly scientific 
 methods of dealing with sin and disease is met by something practical,--namely, the proof of the   
 utility of these methods; and proofs are better 
 than mere verbal arguments or prayers which evince no
 spiritual power to heal.
 <p></p><p>As for sin and disease, Christian Science says, in the 
 language of the Master, "Follow me; and let the dead
 bury their dead." Let discord of every name and nature
 be heard no more, and let the harmonious and true sense 
 of Life and being take possession of human consciousness.
 </p><p></p><p>What is the relative value of the two conflicting theories regarding Christian healing? One, according to 
 the commands of our Master, heals the sick. The other,
 popular religion, declines to admit that Christ's religion
 has exercised any systematic healing power since the first 
 century.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Conditions of criticism</font></p>
 The statement that the teachings of Christian Science in this work are "absolutely false, and the most 
 egregious fallacies ever offered for acceptance," is an opinion wholly due to a misapprehension both of the divine Principle and practice of 
 Christian Science and to a consequent inability to demonstrate this Science. Without this understanding, no one
 is capable of impartial or correct criticism, because demonstration and spiritual understanding are God's immortal
 keynotes, proved to be such by our Master and evidenced
 by the sick who are cured and by the sinners who are 
 reformed.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Weakness of material theories</font></p>
 Strangely enough, we ask for material theories in sup<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_356%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 356 </font></a></p><p></p><p>port of spiritual and eternal truths, when the two are so
 antagonistic that the material thought must become spiritualized before the spiritual fact is attained.
 So-called material existence affords no evidence
 theories of spiritual existence and immortality. Sin,
 sickness, and death do not prove man's entity or immortality. Discord can never establish the facts of harmony.
 Matter is not the vestibule of Spirit.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Irreconciliable differences</font></p>
 Jesus reasoned on this subject practically, and controlled sickness, sin, and death on the basis of his spirituality. Understanding the nothingness of
 material things, he spoke of flesh and Spirit
 as the two opposites, - as error and Truth, not contributing in any way to each other's happiness and existence.
 Jesus knew, "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh
 profiteth nothing."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Copartnership impossible</font></p>
 There is neither a present nor an eternal copartnership between error and Truth, between flesh and Spirit.
 God is as incapable of producing sin, sickness, and death as He is of experiencing these
 errors. How then is it possible for Him to create man
 subject to this triad of errors,--man who is made in the
 divine likeness?
 <p></p><p>Does God create a material man out of Himself, Spirit?
 Does evil proceed from good? Does divine Love commit a fraud on humanity by making man inclined to sin,
 and then punishing him for it? Would any one call it
 wise and good to create the primitive, and then punish its
 derivative?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Two infinite creators absurd</font></p>
 Does subsequent follow its antecedent?  It does.
 Was there original self-creative sin? Then there must
 have been more than one creator, more than one God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_357"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 357</font></a></p><p></p><p>In common justice, we must admit that God will not 
 punish man for doing what He created man
 capable of doing, and knew from the outset 
 that man would do. God is "of purer eyes 
 than to behold evil." We sustain Truth, not by accepting, but by rejecting a lie.    
    
 Jesus said of personified evil, that it was "a liar, and
 the father of it." Truth creates neither a lie, a capacity
 to lie, nor a liar. If mankind would relinquish the belief 
 that God makes sickness, sin, and death, or makes man
 capable of suffering on account of this malevolent triad,
 the foundations of error would be sapped and error's destruction ensured; but if we theoretically endow mortals
 with the creativeness and authority of Deity, how dare we
 attempt to destroy what He hath made, or even to deny
 that God made man evil and made evil good?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Anthropomorphism</font></p>
 History teaches that the popular and false notions
 about the Divine Being and character have originated
 in the human mind. As there is in reality but 
 one God, one Mind, wrong notions about God
 must have originated in a false supposition, not in immortal Truth, and they are fading out. They are false
 claims, which will eventually disappear, according to the
 vision of St. John in the Apocalypse.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">One supremacy  </font></p>
 If what opposes God is real, there must be two
 powers, and God is not supreme and infinite. Can
 Deity be almighty, if another mighty and 
 self-creative cause exists and sways mankind? Has the Father "Life in Himself," as the Scriptures say, and, if so, can Life, or God, dwell in evil and 
 create it? Can matter drive Life, Spirit, hence, and so
 defeat omnipotence?
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_358%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 358 </font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Matter impotent</font></p>
 Is the woodman's axe, which destroys a tree's so-called
 life, superior to omnipotence? Can a leaden bullet deprive a man of Life,--that is, of God, who is
 man's Life? If God is at the mercy of matter,
 then matter is omnipotent. Such doctrines are "confusion worse confounded." If two statements directly contradict each other and one is true, the other must be false.
 Is Science thus contradictory?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific and Biblical facts</font></p>
 Christian Science, understood, coincides with the
 Scriptures, and sustains logically and demonstratively
 every point it presents. Otherwise it would
 not be Science, and could not present its
 proofs. Christian Science is neither made up of contradictory aphorisms nor of the inventions of those who scoff
 at God. It presents the calm and clear verdict of Truth
 against error, uttered and illustrated by the prophets,
 by Jesus, by his apostles, as is recorded throughout the
 Scriptures.
 <p></p><p>Why are the words of Jesus more frequently cited
 for our instruction than are his remarkable works? Is
 it not because there are few who have gained a true
 knowledge of the great import to Christianity of those
 works?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Personal confidence</font></p>
 Sometimes it is said; "Rest assured that whatever
 effect Christian Scientists may have on the sick, comes
 through rousing within the sick a belief
 that in the removal of disease these healers
 have wonderful power, derived from the Holy Ghost."
 Is it likely that church-members have more faith in
 some Christian Scientist, whom they have perhaps
 never seen and against whom they have been warned,
 than they have in their own accredited and  orthodox
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_359"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 359</font></a></p><p></p><p>pastors, whom they have seen and have been taught 
 to love and to trust?
 </p><p></p><p>Let any clergyman try to cure his friends by their 
 faith in him. Will that faith heal them? Yet Scientists will take the same cases, and cures will follow.
 Is this because the patients have more faith in the Scientist than in their pastor? I have healed infidels whose
 only objection to this method was, that I as a Christian Scientist believed in the Holy Spirit, while they, the 
 patients, did not.
 </p><p></p><p>Even though you aver that the material senses are
 indispensable to man's existence or entity, you must 
 change the human concept of life, and must at length
 know yourself spiritually and scientifically. The evidence of the existence of Spirit, Soul, is palpable only to 
 spiritual sense, and is not apparent to the material senses,
 which cognize only that which is the opposite of Spirit.
 </p><p></p><p>True Christianity is to be honored wherever found,
 but when shall we arrive at the goal which that word
 implies? From Puritan parents, the discoverer of Christian Science early received her
 religious education. In childhood, she often listened
 with joy to these words, falling from the lips of her
 saintly mother, "God is able to raise you up from sickness;" and she pondered the meaning of that Scripture
 she so often quotes: "And these signs shall follow them
 that believe; . . . they shall lay hands on the sick, 
 and they shall recover."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Two different artists</font></p>
 A Christian Scientist and an opponent are like two
 artists. One says: "I have spiritual ideals, 
 indestructible and glorious. When others see
 them as I do, in their true light and loveliness,--and
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_360"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 360</font></a></p><p></p><p>know that these ideals are real and eternal because drawn
 from Truth,--they will find that nothing is lost, and all
 is won, by a right estimate of what is real."
 </p><p></p><p>The other artist replies: "You wrong my experience.
 I have no mind-ideals except those which are both mental
 and material. It is true that materiality renders these
 ideals imperfect and destructible; yet I would not exchange mine for thine, for mine give me such personal
 pleasure, and they are not so shockingly transcendental.
 They require less self-abnegation, and keep Soul well out
 of sight. Moreover, I have no notion of losing my old
 doctrines or human opinions."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Choose ye to-day</font></p>
 Dear reader, which mind-picture or externalized thought
 shall be real to you,--the material or the spiritual?
 Both you cannot have.  You are bringing out
 your own ideal.  This ideal is either temporal
 or eternal. Either Spirit or matter is your model. If you
 try to have two models, then you practically have none.
 Like a pendulum in a clock, you will be thrown back and
 forth, striking the ribs of matter and swinging between the
 real and the unreal.
 <p></p><p>Hear the wisdom of Job, as given in the excellent translation of the late Rev. George R. Noyes, D.D.: </p><p></p><p>   Shall mortal man be more just than God?<br>
    Shall man be more pure than his Maker?<br>
    Behold, He putteth no trust in His ministering spirits,<br>
    And His angels He chargeth with frailty.<br>
 </p><p></p><p>Of old, the Jews put to death the Galilean Prophet,
 the best Christian on earth, for the truth he spoke and
 demonstrated, while to-day, Jew and Christian can unite
 in doctrine and denomination on the very basis of Jesus'
 words and works. The Jew believes that the Messiah or
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_361"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 361</font></a></p><p></p><p>Christ has not yet come; the Christian believes that
 Christ is God. Here Christian Science intervenes, explains these doctrinal points, cancels the disagreement, 
 and settles the question. Christ, as the true spiritual idea,
 is the ideal of God now and forever, here and everywhere.
 The Jew who believes in the First Commandment is a 
 monotheist; he has one omnipresent God. Thus the Jew
 unites with the Christian's doctrine that God is come and
 is present now and forever. The Christian who believes
 in the First Commandment is a monotheist. This he
 virtually unites with the Jew's belief in one God, and
 recognizes that Jesus Christ is not God, as Jesus himself 
 declared, but is the Son of God. This declaration of
 Jesus, understood, conflicts not at all with another of his
 sayings: "I and my Father are one,"--that is, one in 
 quality, not in quantity. As a drop of water is one with
 the ocean, a ray of light one with the, sun, even so God
 and man, Father and son, are one in being. The Scripture reads: "For in Him we live, and move, and have
 our being."
 </p><p></p><p>I have revised Science and Health only to give a 
 clearer and fuller expression of its original meaning. Spiritual ideas unfold as we advance. A human perception of
 divine Science, however limited, must be correct in order 
 to be Science and subject to demonstration. A germ of infinite Truth, though least in the kingdom of heaven is the
 higher hope on earth, but it will be rejected and reviled 
 until God prepares the soil for the seed. That which
 when sown bears immortal fruit, enriches mankind only
 when it is understood,--hence the many readings given 
 the Scriptures, and the requisite revisions of Science and
 Health with Key to the Scriptures.
