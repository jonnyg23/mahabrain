 <h1 align="CENTER">Chapter III - Marriage</h1>
 <p></p><p><a name="pg_56"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 56</font></a></p><p></p><p>What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
 In the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but
 are as the angels of God in heaven.--JESUS.
 </p><p></p><p>WHEN our great Teacher came to him for baptism,
 John was astounded. Reading his thoughts, Jesus
 added: "Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us
 to fulfil all righteousness." Jesus' concessions (in certain
 cases) to material methods were for the advancement of
 spiritual good.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Marriage temporal</font></p>
 Marriage is the legal and moral provision for generation among human kind. Until the spiritual creation
 is discerned intact, is apprehended and understood, and His kingdom is come as in the vision
 of the Apocalypse, - where the corporeal sense of creation was cast out, and its spiritual sense was revealed from
 heaven,--marriage will continue, subject to such moral
 regulations as will secure increasing virtue.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Fidelity required</font></p>
 Infidelity to the marriage covenant is the social scourge
 of all races, "the pestilence that walketh in darkness,
 . . . the destruction that wasteth at noonday."
 The commandment, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," is no less imperative than the one, "Thou
 shalt not kill."
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_57"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 57</font></a></p><p></p><p>Chastity is the cement of civilization and progress.
 Without it there is no stability in society, and without it
 one cannot attain the Science of Life.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental elements</font></p>
 Union of the masculine and feminine qualities constitutes completeness. The masculine mind reaches a
 higher tone through certain elements of the
 feminine, while the feminine mind gains courage and strength through masculine qualities. These
 different elements conjoin naturally with each other, and
 their true harmony is in spiritual oneness. Both sexes
 should be loving, pure, tender, and strong. The attraction between native qualities will be perpetual only as it
 is pure and true, bringing sweet seasons of renewal like
 the returning spring.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Affection's demands</font></p>
 Beauty, wealth, or fame is incompetent to meet the
 demands of the affections, and should never weigh
 against the better claims of intellect, goodness, and virtue. Happiness is spiritual,
 born of Truth and Love.   It is unselfish; therefore
 it cannot exist alone, but requires all mankind to
 share it.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Help and discipline</font></p>
 Human affection is not poured forth vainly, even
 though it meet no return. Love enriches the nature, enlarging, purifying, and elevating it. The wintry
 blasts of earth may uproot the flowers of affection, and scatter them to the winds; but this severance
 of fleshly ties serves to unite thought more closely to
 God, for Love supports the struggling heart until it ceases
 to sigh over the world and begins to unfold its wings for
 heaven.
 <p></p><p>Marriage is unblest or blest, according to the disappointments it involves or the hopes it fulfils. To happify
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_58"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 58</font></a></p><p></p><p>existence by constant intercourse with those adapted to
 elevate it, should be the motive of society. Unity of
 spirit gives new pinions to joy, or else joy's drooping
 wings trail in dust.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Chord and discord</font></p>
 Ill-arranged notes produce discord. Tones of the
 human mind may be different, but they should be concordant in order to blend properly. Unselfish
 ambition, noble life-motives, and purity, these constituents of thought, mingling, constitute individually and collectively true happiness, strength, and
 permanence.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mutual freedom</font></p>
 There is moral freedom in Soul. Never contract the
 horizon of a worthy outlook by the selfish exaction of
 all another's time and thoughts. With additional joys, benevolence should grow more
 diffusive. The narrowness and jealousy, which would
 confine a wife or a husband forever within four walls, will
 not promote the sweet interchange of confidence and love;
 but on the other hand, a wandering desire for incessant
 amusement outside the home circle is a poor augury for
 the happiness of wedlock. Home is the dearest spot on
 earth, and it should be the centre, though not the boundary, of the affections.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A useful suggestion</font></p>
 Said the peasant bride to her lover: "Two eat no more
 together than they eat separately." This is a hint that
 a wife ought not to court vulgar extravagance
 or stupid ease, because another supplies her
 wants. Wealth may obviate the necessity for toil or the
 chance for ill-nature in the marriage relation, but nothing can abolish the cares of marriage.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Differing duties</font></p>
 "She that is married careth . . . how she may please
 her husband," says the Bible; and this is the pleasantest
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_59"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 59</font></a></p><p></p><p>thing to do. Matrimony should never be entered into
 without a full recognition of its enduring obligations on
 both sides. There should be the most tender
 solicitude for each other's happiness, and mutual attention and approbation should wait on all the years
 of married life.
 </p><p></p><p>Mutual compromises will often maintain a compact
 which might otherwise become unbearable. Man should
 not be required to participate in all the annoyances and
 cares of domestic economy, nor should woman be expected to understand political economy. Fulfilling the
 different demands of their united spheres, their sympathies should blend in sweet confidence and cheer, each
 partner sustaining the other,--thus hallowing the union
 of interests and affections, in which the heart finds peace
 and home.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Trysting renewed</font></p>
 Tender words and unselfish care in what promotes the
 welfare and happiness of your wife will prove more salutary
 in prolonging her health and smiles than stolid
 indifference or jealousy. Husbands, hear  this
 and remember how slight a word or deed may renew the
 old trysting-times.
 <p></p><p>After marriage, it is too late to grumble over incompatibility of disposition. A mutual understanding should
 exist before this union and continue ever after, for deception is fatal to happiness.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Permanent obligation</font></p>
 The nuptial vow should never be annulled, so long as
 its moral obligations are kept intact; but the frequency
 of divorce shows that the sacredness of this relationship is losing its influence, and that fatal
 mistakes are undermining its foundations. Separation
 never should take place, and it never would, if both
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a></p><p></p><p>husband and wife were genuine Christian Scientists.
 Science inevitably lifts one's being higher in the scale of
 harmony and happiness.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Permanent affection</font></p>
 Kindred tastes, motives, and aspirations are necessary
 to the formation of a happy and permanent companionship. The beautiful in character is also the
 good, welding indissolubly the links of affection. A mother's affection cannot be weaned from her
 child, because the mother-love includes purity and constancy, both of which are immortal. Therefore maternal
 affection lives on under whatever difficulties.
 <p></p><p>From the logic of events we learn that selfishness
 and impurity alone are fleeting, and that wisdom will
 ultimately put asunder what she hath not joined
 together.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Centre for affections</font></p>
 Marriage should improve the human species, becoming
 a barrier against vice, a protection to woman, strength to
 man, and a centre for the affections. This,
 however, in a majority of cases, is not its
 present tendency, and why? Because the education of
 the higher nature is neglected, and other considerations, 
 - passion, frivolous amusements, personal adornment,
 display, and pride,--occupy thought.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual concord</font></p>
 An ill-attuned ear calls discord harmony, not appreciating concord. So physical sense, not discerning the true
 happiness of being, places it on a false basis.
 Science will correct the discord, and teach us
 life's sweeter harmonies.
 <p></p><p>Soul has infinite resources with which to bless mankind,
 and happiness would be more readily attained and would
 be more secure in our keeping, if sought in Soul. Higher
 enjoyments alone can satisfy the cravings of immortal
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_61"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 61</font></a></p><p></p><p>man. We cannot circumscribe happiness within the
 limits of personal sense. The senses confer no real
 enjoyment.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ascendency of good</font></p>
 The good in human affections must have ascendency
 over the evil and the spiritual over the animal, or happiness will never be won. The attainment of
 this celestial condition would improve our
 progeny, diminish crime, and give higher aims to ambition. Every valley of sin must be exalted, and every
 mountain of selfishness be brought low, that the highway
 of our God may be prepared in Science. The offspring
 of heavenly-minded parents inherit more intellect, better
 balanced minds, and sounder constitutions.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Propensities inherited</font></p>
 If some fortuitous circumstance places promising children in the arms of gross parents, often these beautiful
 children early droop and die, like tropical
 flowers born amid Alpine snows. If perchance
 they live to become parents in their turn, they may reproduce in their own helpless little ones the grosser traits
 of their ancestors. What hope of happiness, what noble
 ambition, can inspire the child who inherits propensities
 that must either be overcome or reduce him to a loathsome wreck?
 <p></p><p>Is not the propagation of the human species a greater
 responsibility, a more solemn charge, than the culture of
 your garden or the raising of stock to increase your flocks
 and herds? Nothing unworthy of perpetuity should be
 transmitted to children.
 </p><p></p><p>The formation of mortals must greatly improve to
 advance mankind. The scientific morale of marriage is
 spiritual unity. If the propagation of a higher human
 species is requisite to reach this goal, then its material con</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_62"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 62</font></a></p><p></p><p>ditions can only be permitted for the purpose of generating. The foetus must be kept mentally pure and the
 period of gestation have the sanctity of virginity.
 </p><p></p><p>The entire education of children should be such as to
 form habits of obedience to the moral and spiritual law,
 with which the child can meet and master the belief in socalled physical laws, a belief which breeds disease.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Inheritance heeded</font></p>
 If parents create in their babes a desire for incessant
 amusement, to be always fed, rocked, tossed, or talked
 to, those parents should not, in after years,
 complain of their children's fretfulness or frivolity, which the parents themselves have occasioned.
 Taking less "thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or
 what ye shall drink"; less thought "for your body what
 ye shall put on," will do much more for the health of the
 rising generation than you dream. Children should be
 allowed to remain children in knowledge, and should
 become men and women only through growth in the
 understanding of man's higher nature.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The Mind creative</font></p>
 We must not attribute more and more intelligence
 to matter, but less and less, if we would be wise and
 healthy. The divine Mind, which forms the
 bud and blossom, will care for the human
 body, even as it clothes the lily; but let no mortal interfere with God's government by thrusting in the laws of
 erring, human concepts.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Superior law of Soul</font></p>
 The higher nature of man is not governed by the lower;
 if it were, the order of wisdom would be reversed.
 Our false views of life hide eternal harmony,
 and produce the ills of which we complain.
 Because mortals believe in material laws and reject the
 Science of Mind, this does not make materiality first and
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_63"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 63</font></a></p><p></p><p>the superior law of Soul last. You would never think
 that flannel was better for warding off pulmonary disease
 than the controlling Mind, if you understood the Science
 of being.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual origin</font></p>
 In Science man is the offspring of Spirit. The beautiful, good, and pure constitute his ancestry. His origin is
 not, like that of mortals, in brute instinct, nor
 does he pass through material conditions prior
 to reaching intelligence. Spirit is his primitive and ultimate source of being; God is his Father, and Life is the
 law of his being.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The rights of woman</font></p>
 Civil law establishes very unfair differences between the
 rights of the two sexes. Christian Science furnishes no
 precedent for such injustice, and civilization
 mitigates it in some measure. Still, it is a
 marvel why usage should accord woman less rights than
 does either Christian Science or civilization.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Unfair discrimination</font></p>
 Our laws are not impartial, to say the least, in their
 discrimination as to the person, property, and parental
 claims of the two sexes. If the elective franchise for women will remedy the evil with-  
 out encouraging difficulties of greater magnitude, let us
 hope it will be granted. A feasible as well as rational
 means of improvement at present is the elevation of
 society in general and the achievement of a nobler
 race for legislation,--a race having higher aims and
 motives.
 <p></p><p>If a dissolute husband deserts his wife, certainly the
 wronged, and perchance impoverished, woman should be
 allowed to collect her own wages, enter into business
 agreements, hold real estate, deposit funds, and own her
 children free from interference.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_64"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 64</font></a></p><p></p><p>Want of uniform justice is a crying evil caused by the
 selfishness and inhumanity of man. Our forefathers
 exercised their faith in the direction taught by the Apostle
 James, when he said: "Pure religion and undefiled before
 God and the Father, is this, To visit the fatherless and
 widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted
 from the world."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Benevolence hindered</font></p>
 Pride, envy, or jealousy seems on most occasions to
 be the master of ceremonies, ruling out primitive Christianity. When a man lends a helping hand
 to some noble woman, struggling alone with
 adversity, his wife should not say, "It is never well to
 interfere with your neighbor's business." A wife is
 sometimes debarred by a covetous domestic tyrant from
 giving the ready aid her sympathy and charity would
 afford.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Progressive development</font></p>
 Marriage should signify a union of hearts. Furthermore, the time cometh of which Jesus spake, when he
 declared that in the resurrection there should
 be no more marrying nor giving in marriage,
 but man would be as the angels. Then shall Soul rejoice in its own, in which passion has no part. Then
 white-robed purity will unite in one person masculine wisdom and feminine love, spiritual understanding and perpetual peace.
 <p></p><p>Until it is learned that God is the Father of all, marriage will continue. Let not mortals permit a disregard
 of law which might lead to a worse state of society than
 now exists. Honesty and virtue ensure the stability of
 the marriage covenant. Spirit will ultimately claim its
 own,--all that really is,--and the voices of physical
 sense will be forever hushed.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_65"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 65</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Blessing of Christ</font></p>
 Experience should be the school of virtue, and human
 happiness should proceed from man's highest nature.
 May Christ, Truth, be present at every bridal
 altar to turn the water into wine and to give to
 human life an inspiration by which man's spiritual and
 eternal existence may be discerned.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Righteous foundations</font></p>
 If the foundations of human affection are consistent
 with progress, they will be strong and enduring.  Divorces
 should warn the age of some fundamental error
 in the marriage state. The union of the sexes
 suffers fearful discord. To gain Christian Science and its
 harmony, life should be more metaphysically regarded.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Powerless promises</font></p>
 The broadcast powers of evil so conspicuous to-day
 show themselves in the materialism and sensualism of
 the age, struggling against the advancing
 spiritual era. Beholding the world's lack of
 Christianity and the powerlessness of vows to make home
 happy, the human mind will at length demand a higher affection.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Transition and reform</font></p>
 There will ensue a fermentation over this as over many
 other reforms, until we get at last the clear straining of
 truth, and impurity and error are left among
 the lees. The fermentation even of fluids is
 not pleasant. An unsettled, transitional stage is never
 desirable on its own account. Matrimony, which was once
 a fixed fact among us, must lose its present slippery footing, and man must find permanence and peace in a more
 spiritual adherence.
 <p></p><p>The mental chemicalization, which has brought conjugal infidelity to the surface, will assuredly throw off
 this evil, and marriage will become purer when the scum
 is gone.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_66"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 66</font></a></p><p></p><p>Thou art right, immortal Shakespeare, great poet of
 humanity:
 </p><p></p><p>      Sweet are the uses of adversity;<br>
    Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,<br>
    Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.<br>
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Salutary sorrow</font></p>
 Trials teach mortals not to lean on a material staff, a broken reed, which pierces the heart. We do not
 half remember this in the sunshine of joy
 and prosperity. Sorrow is salutary. Through
 great tribulation we enter the kingdom. Trials are
 proofs of God's care. Spiritual development germinates not from seed sown in the soil of material hopes,
 but when these decay, Love propagates anew the higher
 joys of Spirit, which have no taint of earth. Each successive stage of experience unfolds new views of divine
 goodness and love.
 <p></p><p>Amidst gratitude for conjugal felicity, it is well to remember how fleeting are human joys. Amidst conjugal
 infelicity, it is well to hope, pray, and wait patiently on
 divine wisdom to point out the path.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Patience is wisdom</font></p>
 Husbands and wives should never separate if there
 is no Christian demand for it. It is better to await the
 logic of events than for a wife precipitately
 to leave her husband or for a husband to
 leave his wife. If one is better than the other, as must
 always be the case, the other pre-eminently needs good
 company. Socrates considered patience salutary under
 such circumstances, making his Xantippe a discipline for
 his philosophy.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The gold and dross</font></p>
 Sorrow has its reward. It never leaves us
 where it found us. The furnace separates
 the gold from the dross that the precious metal may
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_67"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 67</font></a></p><p></p><p>be graven with the image of God. The cup our Father
 hath given, shall we not drink it and learn the lessons
 He teaches?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Weathering the storm</font></p>
 When the ocean is stirred by a storm, then the clouds
 lower, the wind shrieks through the tightened shrouds,
 and the waves lift themselves into mountains.
 We ask the helmsman: "Do you know your
 course? Can you steer safely amid the storm?" He
 answers bravely, but even the dauntless seaman is not
 sure of his safety; nautical science is not equal to the
 Science of Mind. Yet, acting up to his highest understanding, firm at the post of duty, the mariner works on
 and awaits the issue. Thus should we deport ourselves
 on the seething ocean of sorrow. Hoping and working, one should stick to the wreck, until an irresistible
 propulsion precipitates his doom or sunshine gladdens
 the troubled sea.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual power</font></p>
 The notion that animal natures can possibly give force
 to character is too absurd for consideration, when we
 remember that through spiritual ascendency
 our Lord and Master healed the sick, raised
 the dead, and commanded even the winds and waves to
 obey him. Grace and Truth are potent beyond all other
 means and methods.
 <p></p><p>The lack of spiritual power in the limited demonstration
 of popular Christianity does not put to silence the labor
 of centuries. Spiritual, not corporeal, consciousness is
 needed. Man delivered from sin, disease, and death
 presents the true likeness or spiritual ideal.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Basis of true religion</font></p>
 Systems of religion and medicine treat of physical pains
 and pleasures, but Jesus rebuked the suffering from any
 such cause or effect. The epoch approaches when the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_68"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 68</font></a></p><p></p><p>understanding of the truth of being will be the basis of
 true religion. At present mortals progress slowly for
 fear of being thought ridiculous. They are
 slaves to fashion, pride, and sense.   Sometime we shall learn how Spirit, the great architect, has
 created men and women in Science. We ought to weary
 of the fleeting and false and to cherish nothing which
 hinders our highest selfhood.
 </p><p></p><p>Jealousy is the grave of affection. The presence of
 mistrust, where confidence is due, withers the flowers
 of Eden and scatters love's petals to decay.   Be not
 in haste to take the vow "until death do us part."
 Consider its obligations, its responsibilities, its relations to your growth and to your influence on other
 lives.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Insanity and agamogenesis</font></p>
 I never knew more than one individual who believed
 in agamogenesis; she was unmarried, a lovely character, was suffering from incipient insanity, and
 a Christian Scientist cured her. I have named
 her case to individuals, when casting my bread upon
 the waters, and it may have caused the good to ponder
 and the evil to hatch their silly innuendoes and lies, since
 salutary causes sometimes incur these effects. The perpetuation of the floral species by bud or cell-division is
 evident, but I discredit the belief that agamogenesis
 applies to the human species.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">God's creation intact</font></p>
 Christian Science presents unfoldment, not accretion;
 it manifests no material growth from molecule to mind,
 but an impartation of the divine Mind to man
 and the universe. Proportionately as human
 generation ceases, the unbroken links of eternal, harmonious being will be spiritually discerned; and man,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_69"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 69</font></a></p><p></p><p>not of the earth earthly but coexistent with God, will
 appear. The scientific fact that man and the universe
 are evolved from Spirit, and so are spiritual, is as fixed in
 divine Science as is the proof that mortals gain the sense
 of health only as they lose the sense of sin and disease.
 Mortals can never understand God's creation while believing that man is a creator. God's children already created
 will be cognized only as man finds the truth of being.
 Thus it is that the real, ideal man appears in proportion
 as the false and material disappears. No longer to marry
 or to be "given in marriage" neither closes man's continuity nor his sense of increasing number in God's infinite plan. Spiritually to understand that there is but
 one creator, God, unfolds all creation, confirms the Scriptures, brings the sweet assurance of no parting, no pain,
 and of man deathless and perfect and eternal.
 </p><p></p><p>If Christian Scientists educate their own offspring
 spiritually, they can educate others spiritually and not
 conflict with the scientific sense of God's creation. Some
 day the child will ask his parent: "Do you keep the First
 Commandment? Do you have one God and creator, or
 is man a creator?" If the father replies, "God creates
 man through man," the child may ask, "Do you teach
 that Spirit creates materially, or do you declare that
 Spirit is infinite, therefore matter is out of the question?" Jesus said, "The children of this world marry,
 and are given in marriage: But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in
 marriage."
