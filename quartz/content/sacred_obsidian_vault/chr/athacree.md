 <h1>Athanasian Creed</h1>
 <hr> 
 <p>1.  Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary 
 that he hold the catholic faith; 
 </p><p>2.  Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled,
 without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.  
 </p><p>3.  And the catholic faith is this: That we worship one God in 
 Trinity, and Trinity in Unity;
 </p><p>4.  Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance.
 </p><p>5.  For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and
 another of the Holy Spirit.  
 </p><p>6.  But the Godhead of the Father, of
 the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is all one, the glory equal, the majesty
 coeternal.  
 </p><p>7.  Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is
 the Holy Spirit.  
 </p><p>8.  The Father uncreated, the Son uncreated, and the
 Holy Spirit uncreated.  
 </p><p>9.  The Father incomprehensible, the Son
 incomprehensible, and the Holy Spirit incomprehensible.  
 </p><p>10.  The
 Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Spirit eternal.  
 </p><p>11.
 And yet they are not three eternals but one eternal.  
 </p><p>12.  As also
 there are not three uncreated nor three incomprehensible, but one
 uncreated and one incomprehensible.  
 </p><p>13.  So likewise the Father is
 almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Spirit almighty.  
 </p><p>14.  And
 yet they are not three almighties, but one almighty.  
 </p><p>15.  So the
 Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God; 
 </p><p>16.  And
 yet they are not three Gods, but one God.  
 </p><p>17.  So likewise the
 Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Spirit Lord; 
 </p><p>18.  And yet
 they are not three Lords but one Lord.  
 </p><p>19.  For like as we are
 compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by himself
 to be God and Lord; 
 </p><p>20.  So are we forbidden by the catholic religion
 to say; There are three Gods or three Lords.  
 </p><p>21.  The Father is made
 of none, neither created nor begotten.  
 </p><p>22.  The Son is of the Father
 alone; not made nor created, but begotten.  
 </p><p>23.  The Holy Spirit is
 of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten,
 but proceeding.  
 </p><p>24.  So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one
 Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.  
 </p><p>25.
 And in this Trinity none is afore or after another; none is greater or
 less than another.  
 </p><p>26.  But the whole three persons are coeternal,
 and coequal.  
 </p><p>27.  So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in
 Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.  
 </p><p>28.  He
 therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.  
 </p><p>29.
 Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also
 believe rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
 </p><p>30.  For
 the right faith is that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus
 Christ, the Son of God, is God and man.  
 </p><p>31.  God of the substance of
 the Father, begotten before the worlds; and man of substance of His
 mother, born in the world.  
 </p><p>32.  Perfect God and perfect man, of a
 reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting.  
 </p><p>33.  Equal to the Father
 as touching His Godhead, and inferior to the Father as touching His
 manhood.  
 </p><p>34.  Who, although He is God and man, yet He is not two,
 but one Christ.  
 </p><p>35.  One, not by conversion of the Godhead into
 flesh, but by taking of that manhood into God.  
 </p><p>36.  One altogether,
 not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person.  
 </p><p>37.  For as
 the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ;
 
 </p><p>38.  Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again
 the third day from the dead; 
 </p><p>39.  He ascended into heaven, He sits on
 the right hand of the Father, God, Almighty; 
 </p><p>40.  From thence He
 shall come to judge the quick and the dead.  
 </p><p>41.  At whose coming all
 men shall rise again with their bodies; 
 </p><p>42.  and shall give account
 of their own works.  
 </p><p>43.  And they that have done good shall go into
 life everlasting and they that have done evil into everlasting fire.
 
 </p><p>44.  This is the catholic faith, which except a man believe
 faithfully he cannot be saved.  </p></body>
