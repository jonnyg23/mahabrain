 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 149</h4> <i>
 </i><p>The Jews gather in Jerusalem to attend the feast. The Christines go to Jericho. Jesus dines with Zaccheus. He relates the parable of the ten talents.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>The great passover of the Jews, the feast of spring, was calling every loyal Jew up to Jerusalem.<br> <b>2. </b>Ten days before the feast the Lord and his disciples left the Ephraim hills and by the Jordan way, went down to Jericho.<br> <b>3. </b>And as they entered Jericho a wealthy publican came out to see the Lord; but he was small in stature and the throng was great and he could see him not.<br> <b>4. </b>A tree, a sycamore, stood by the way and he climbed up the tree and found a seat among its boughs.<br> <b>5. </b>When Jesus came, he saw the man and said, O Zacheus, make haste, come down; I would abide with you to-day.<br> <b>6. </b>And Zaccheus came down and joyfully received the Lord; but many of the stricter sect called out and said,<br> <b>7. </b>For shame! he goes to lodge with Zaccheu, the sinner and the publican.<br> <b>8. </b>But Jesus did not care for what they said; he went his way with Zaccheus, who was a man of faith, and as they talked together Zaccheus said,<br> <b>9. </b>Lord, I have ever tried to do the right; I give unto the poor half of my goods, and if by any means I wrong a man, I right the wrong by paying him four fold.<br> <b>10. </b>And Jesus said to him, Your life and faith are known to God, and lo, the benedictions of the Lord of hosts abide with you and all your house.<br> <b>11. </b>Then Jesus spoke a parable to all; he said, A vassal of an emperor was made a king, and he went to the foreign land to claim his rights and take the kingdom to himself.<br> <b>12. </b>Before he went he called ten trusted servants and to each he gave a pound and said,<br> <b>13. </b>Go forth and use these pounds as you have opportunity, that you may gain for me more wealth, And then he went his way.<br> <b>14. </b>And after many days he came again, and called the ten, demanding a report.<br> <b>15. </b>The first one came and said, Lord, I have gained nine pounds; you gave me one and here are ten.<br> <b>16. </b>The king replied, Well done, you faithful man; because you have been faithful in a little thing I judge that you will be a faithful servant in a greater thing;<br> <b>17. </b>Behold, I make you ruler over nine important cities of my realm.<br> <b>18. </b>The second came and said, Lord, I have gained for you four pounds; you gave me one, and here are five.<br> <b>19. </b>The king replied, And you have proven up your faithfulness. Behold, I make you ruler over four important cities of my realm.<br> <b>20. </b>another came and said, Lord, I have doubled what you gave to me. You gave one pound to me and here are two.<br> <b>21. </b>The ruler said, And you have proved your faithfulness; Behold, I make you ruler over one important city of my realm.<br> <b>22. </b>Another came and said, Lord, here is what you gave to me. I knew you were an austere man, oft reaping where you did not sow and I was sore afraid, and so I took the pound you gave to me and hid it in a secret place; and here it is.<br> <b>23. </b>The king exclaimed, You slothful man! you knew what I required, that I expected every man to do his best.<br> <b>24. </b>If you were timid and afraid to trust your judgment in the marts of trade, why did you not go forth and put my money out for gain, that I could have my own with interest?<br> <b>25. </b>Then turning to the steward of his wealth the ruler said, Take you this pound and give it unto him who has by diligence earned nine.<br> <b>26. </b>For lo, I say, that every one who uses what he has and gains, shall have abundantly; but he who hides away his talent in the earth shall forfeit what he has.</p>
