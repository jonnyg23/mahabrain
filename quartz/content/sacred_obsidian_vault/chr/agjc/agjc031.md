 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 28</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Udraka gives a feast in Jesus' honour. Jesus speaks on the unity of God and the brotherhood of life. Criticises the priesthood. Becomes the guest of a farmer.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>Benares is the sacred city of the Brahms, and in Benares Jesus taught; Udraka was his host.<br> <b>2. </b>Udraka made a feast in honour of his guest, and many high born Hindu priests and scribes were there.<br> <b>3. </b>And Jesus said to them, With much delight I speak to you concerning life--the brotherhood of life.<br> <b>4. </b>The universal God is one, yet he is more than one; all things are God; all things are one.<br> <b>5. </b>By the sweet breaths of God all life is bound in one; so if you touch a fibre of a living thing you send a thrill from the centre to the outer bounds of life.<br> <b>6. </b>And when you crush beneath your foot the meanest worm, you shake the throne of God, and cause the sword of right to tremble in its sheath.<br> <b>7. </b>The bird sings out its song for men, and men vibrate in unison to help it sing.<br> <b>8. </b>The ant constructs her home, the bee its sheltering comb, the spider weaves her web, and flowers breath to them a spirit in their sweet perfumes that gives them strength to toil.<br> <b>9. </b>Now, men and birds and beasts and creeping things are deities, made flesh; and how dare men kill anything?<br> <b>10. </b>'Tis cruelty that makes the world awry. When men have learned that when they harm a living thing they harm themselves, they surely will not kill, nor cause a thing that God has made to suffer pain.<br> <b>11. </b>A lawyer said, I pray you, Jesus, tell who is this God you speak about; where are his priests, his temples and his shrines?<br> <b>12. </b>And Jesus said, The God I speak about is everywhere; he cannot be compassed with walls, nor hedged about with bounds of any kind.<br> <b>13. </b>All people worship God, the One; but all the people see him not alike.<br> <b>14. </b>This universal God is wisdom, will and love.<br> <b>15. </b>All men see not the Triune God. One sees him as the God of might; another as the God of thought; another as the God of love.<br> <b>16. </b>A man's ideal is his God, and so, as man unfolds. Man's God to-day, to-morrow is not God.<br> <b>17. </b>The nations of the earth see God from different points of view, and so he does not seem the same to every one.<br> <b>18. </b>Man names the part of God he sees, and this to him is all of God; and every nation sees a part of God, and every nation has a name for God.<br> <b>19. </b>You Brahmans call him Parabrahm; in Egypt he is Thoth; and Zeus is his name in Greece; Jehovah is his Hebrew name; but everywhere he is the causeless Cause, the rootless Root from which all things have grown.<br> <b>20. </b>When men become afraid of God, and take him for a foe, they dress up other men in fancy garbs and call them priests.<br> <b>21. </b>And charge them to restrain the wrath of God by prayers; and when they fail to win his favour by their prayers, to buy him off with sacrifice of animal, or bird.<br> <b>22. </b>When man sees God as one with him, as Father-God, he needs no middle man, no priest to intercede;<br> <b>23. </b>He goes straight up to him and says, My Father-God! and then he lays his hand in God's own hand, and all is well.<br> <b>24. </b>And this is God. You are, each one, a priest, just for yourself; and sacrifice of blood God does not want.<br> <b>25. </b>Just give your life in sacrificial service to all of life, and God is pleased.<br> <b>26. </b>When Jesus had thus said he stood aside; the people were amazed, but strove among themselves.<br> <b>27. </b>Some said, He is inspired by Holy Brahm; and others said, He is insane; and others said, He is obsessed; he speaks as devils speak.<br> <b>28. </b>But Jesus tarried not. Among the guests was one, a tiller of the soil, a generous soul, a seeker after truth, who loved the words that Jesus spoke, and Jesus went with him, and in his home abode.</p>
