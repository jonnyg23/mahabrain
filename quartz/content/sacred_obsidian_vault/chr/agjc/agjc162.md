 <p></p> <h4>SECTION XVIII<br> <br> TZADDI<br> <br> The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus</h4> <h4>Chapter 159</h4> <i>
 </i><p>The Christines attend a feast in Simon's house. Mary anoints the master with a costly balm, and Judas and others rebuke her for profligacy. Jesus defends her. The rulers of the Jews employ Ananias to arrest Jesus. Ananias bribes Judas to aid him.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>Bar-Simon, who was once a leper and was cleansed by Jesus by the sacred Word, abode in Bethany.<br> <b>2. </b>In honour of the Christine Lord he gave a feast, and Lazarus was among the guests, and Ruth and Martha served.<br> <b>3. </b>And as the guests reclined about the table, Mary took a cruse of rich perfume and poured it out on Jesus' head and feet.<br> <b>4. </b>And then she knelt and with her hair she wiped his feet; the odour of the rich perfume filled all the room.<br> <b>5. </b>Now, Judas, always looking at the selfish side of life, exclaimed, For shamed, why did you waste that costly perfume thus?<br> <b>6. </b>We might have sold it for three hundred pence, and had the money to supply our wants and feed the poor.<br> <b>7. </b>(Now, Judas was the treasurer, and carried all the money of the Christine band.)<br> <b>8. </b>And others said, Why, Mary, what a profligate you are! You should not throw such wealth away.<br> <b>9. </b>But Jesus said, You men, be still; let her alone; you know not what you say.<br> <b>10. </b>The poor are with you constantly; at any time you can administer to them; but I will not be with you long.<br> <b>11. </b>And Mary knows the sadness of the coming days; she has anointed me beforehand for my burial.<br> <b>12. </b>The gospel of the Christ will everywhere be preached, and he who tells the story of the Christ will tell about this day; and what was done by Mary at this hour will be a sweet memorial to her wherever men abide.<br> <b>13. </b>And when the feast was over Jesus went with Lazarus to his home.<br> <b>14. </b>Now, in Jerusalem the priests and Pharisees were busy with their plans to seize the Lord and take his life.<br> <b>15. </b>The high priest called a counsel all the wisest men and said, This deed must be accomplished in a secret way.<br> <b>16. </b>He must be taken when the multitudes are not a-near, else we may cause a war; the common people may stand forth in his defence and thus pollute this sacred place with human blood.<br> <b>17. </b>And what we do, that we must do before the great day of the feast.<br> <b>18. </b>And Ananias said, I have a plan that will succeed. The twelve with Jesus every day go forth alone to pray;<br> <b>19. </b>And we will find their trysting place; then we can seize the man and bring him here without the knowledge of the multitudes.<br> <b>20. </b>I know one of the twelve, a man who worships wealth, and for a sum I think that he will lead the way to where the man is wont to pray.<br> <b>21. </b>And then Caiaphas said, If you will lead the way and bribe the man of whom you speak, to aid in seizing Jesus in a secret place, then we will give to you a hundred silver pieces for your hire.<br> <b>22. </b>And Ananias said, 'Tis well.<br> <b>23. </b>And then he went to Bethany and found the twelve at Simon's house and, calling Judas to the side he said,<br> <b>24. </b>If you would care to make a sum of money for yourself hear me:<br> <b>25. </b>The high priest and other rulers in Jerusalem would like to talk with Jesus when alone, that they may know about his claims;<br> <b>26. </b>And if he proves himself to be the Christ, lo, they will stand in his defence.<br> <b>27. </b>Now, if you will but lead the way to where your master is tomorrow night that they may send a priest to talk with him alone, there is a sum of silver, thirty pieces, that the priests will give to you:<br> <b>28. </b>And Judas reasoned with himself; he said, It surely may be well to give the Lord a chance to tell the priests about his claims when he is all alone.<br> <b>29. </b>And if the priests would do him harm he has the power to disappear and go his way as he has done before; and thirty pieces is a goodly sum.<br> <b>30. </b>And so he said to Ananias, I will lead the way, and by a kiss make known which person is the Lord.</p>
