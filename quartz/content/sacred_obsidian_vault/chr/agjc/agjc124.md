 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 121</h4> <i>
 </i><p>The Christines are in Nazareth. Miriam sings a Christine song of praise. Jesus teaches in the synagogue. He heals a dumb man who is obsessed. The people do not believe in him. The Pharisees call him a tool of Beelzebul. The Christines go to Cana.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>It was a gala day in Nazareth. The people there had met with one accord to celebrate some great event.<br> <b>2. </b>And Jesus and the foreign masters and the twelve, and Mary, mother of the Lord, and Miriam were there.<br> <b>3. </b>And when the people were assembled in the great hall of the town, the graceful singer, Miriam, stood and sang a song of praise.<br> <b>4. </b>But few of all the multitude knew who the singer was; but instantly she won all hearts.<br> <b>5. </b>For many days she sang the songs of Israel, and then she went her way.<br> <b>6. </b>The Sabbath came and Jesus went into the synagogue. He took the book of Psalms and read:<br> <b>7. </b>Blest is the man who puts his trust in God, respecting not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies.<br> <b>8. </b>O lord, my God, the works that thou hast done for us are wonderful; and many are thy thoughts for us; we cannot count them all,<br> <b>9. </b>Thou dost not call for sacrifice, nor offerings of blood; burnt offerings and offerings for sin thou dost not want;<br> <b>10. </b>And lo, I come to do thy will, O God, thy law is in my heart,<br> <b>11. </b>And I have preached the word of righteousness and peace unto the thronging multitudes; I have declared the counsel of my God in full.<br> <b>12. </b>I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and grace.<br> <b>13. </b>I have not kept thy loving-kindness and thy truth away from men; I have declared them to the multitudes.<br> <b>14. </b>O Lord, make wide my lips that I may tell thy praise; I do not bring the sacrifice of blood, nor yet burnt offerings for sin.<br> <b>15. </b>The sacrifices I would bring to thee, O God, are purity in life, a contrite heart, a spirit full of faith and love, and these thou wilt receive.<br> <b>16. </b>And when he had thus read, he gave the book back to the keeper of the books, and then he said,<br> <b>17. </b>Upon these ends of earth these messages of God have come.<br> <b>18. </b>Our people have exalted sacrificial rites and have neglected mercy, justice and the rights of men.<br> <b>19. </b>You Pharisees, you priests, you scribes, your God surfeited with blood; God does not heed your prayers; you stand before your burning victims; but you stand in vain.<br> <b>20. </b>Turn you unto the testimonies of the law; reform and turn to God, and you shall live.<br> <b>21. </b>Let not your altars be accursed again with smoke of innocence.<br> <b>22. </b>Bring unto God as sacrifice a broken and a contrite heart.<br> <b>23. </b>Lift from your fellow men the burdens that you have imposed.<br> <b>24. </b>And if you hearken not, and if you turn not from your evil ways, lo, God will smite this nation with a curse.<br> <b>25. </b>And when he had thus said he stood aside, and all the people were astonished, and they said,<br> <b>26. </b>Where did this man get all his knowledge and his power? From whence did all this wisdom come?<br> <b>27. </b>Is not this Mary's son, whose home is out on Marmion Way?<br> <b>28. </b>Are not his brothers, Jude and James and Simon, known among our honoured men? Are not his sisters with us here?<br> <b>29. </b>But they were all offended by the words he spoke.<br> <b>30. </b>And Jesus said, A prophet has no honour in his native land; he is not well received among his kin; his foes are in his home.<br> <b>31. </b>And Jesus wrought not many mighty works in Nazareth, because the people had no faith in him. He did not tarry long.<br> <b>32. </b>But as he passed from thence two blind men followed him and cried, Thou son of David, hear! Have mercy, Lord, and open up our eyes that we may see.<br> <b>33. </b>And Jesus said, Do you believe that I can open up your eyes and make you see?<br> <b>34. </b>They said, Yea, Lord, we know that if you speak the Word then we can see.<br> <b>35. </b>And Jesus touched their eyes and spoke the Word; he said, According to your faith so will it be.<br> <b>36. </b>And they were blest; they opened up their eyes and saw.<br> <b>37. </b>And Jesus said, Tell not this thing to any one.<br> <b>38. </b>But they went forth and told the news through all the land.<br> <b>39. </b>As Jesus walked along the way a man who was obsessed, and who was dumb, was brought to him.<br> <b>40. </b>And Jesus spoke the Word; the unclean spirit came out of the man; his tongue was loosed; he spoke; he said, Praise God.<br> <b>41. </b>The people were amazed; They said, This is a mighty deed; we never saw that done before.<br> <b>42. </b>The Pharisees were also much amazed; but they cried out and said,<br> <b>43. </b>You men of Israel, take heed; this Jesus is a tool of Beelzebul; he heals the sick and casts the spirits out in Satan's name.<br> <b>44. </b>But Jesus answered not; he went his way.<br> <b>45. </b>And with the foreign masters and the twelve he went up to the town where he once turned the water into wine, and tarried certain days.</p>
