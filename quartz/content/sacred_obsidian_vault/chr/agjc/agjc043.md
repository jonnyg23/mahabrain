 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 40</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Jesus teaches the magians. Explains the Silence and how to enter it. Kaspar extols the wisdom of Jesus. Jesus teaches in the groves of Cyrus.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>Now, in the early morning Jesus came again to teach and heal. A light not comprehended shown about, as though some mighty spirit overshadowed him.<br> <b>2. </b>A magus noted this and asked him privately to tell from whence his wisdom came, and what the meaning of the light.<br> <b>3. </b>And Jesus said, There is a Silence where the soul may meet its God, and there the fount of wisdom is, and all who enter are immersed in light, and filled with wisdom, love and power.<br> <b>4. </b>The magus said, Tell me about this Silence and this light, that I may go and there abide.<br> <b>5. </b>And Jesus said, The Silence is not circumscribed; is not a place closed in with wall, or rocky steeps, nor guarded by the sword of man.<br> <b>6. </b>Men carry with them all the time the secret place where they might meet their God.<br> <b>7. </b>It matters not where men abide, on mountain top, in deepest vale, in marts of trade, or in the quiet home; they may at once, at any time, fling wide the door, and find the Silence, find the house of God; it is within the soul.<br> <b>8. </b>One may not be so much disturbed by noise of business, and the words and thoughts of men if he goes all alone into the valley or the mountain pass.<br> <b>9. </b>And when life's heavy load is pressing hard, it is far better to go out and seek a quiet place to pray and meditate.<br> <b>10. </b>The Silence is the kingdom of the soul which is not seen by human eyes.<br> <b>11. </b>When in the Silence, phantom forms mat flit before the mind; but they are all subservient to the will; the master soul may speak and they are gone.<br> <b>12. </b>If you would find this Silence of the soul you must yourself prepare the way. None but the pure in heart may enter here.<br> <b>13. </b>And you must lay aside all tenseness of the mind, all business cares, all fears, all doubts and troubled thoughts.<br> <b>14. </b>Your human will must be absorbed by the divine; then you will come into a consciousness of holiness.<br> <b>15. </b>You are in the Holy Place, and you will see upon a living shrine the candle of the Lord aflame.<br> <b>16. </b>And when you see it burning there, look deep into the temple of your brain, and you will see it all aglow.<br> <b>17. </b>In every part, from head to foot. are candles all in place, just waiting to be lighted by the flaming torch of love.<br> <b>18. </b>And when you see the candles all aflame, just look, and you will see, with eyes of soul, the waters of the fount of wisdom rushing on; and you may drink, and there abide.<br> <b>19. </b>And then the curtains part, and you are in the Holiest of All, where rests the Arc of God, whose covering is the Mercy Seat.<br> <b>20. </b>Fear not to lift the sacred board; the Tables of the Law are in the Ark concealed.<br> <b>21. </b>Take them and read them well; for they contain all precepts and commands that men will ever need.<br> <b>22. </b>And in the Ark, the magic wand of prophecy lies waiting for your hand; it is the key to all the hidden meanings of the present, future, past.<br> <b>23. </b>And then, behold, the manna there, the hidden bread of life; and he who eats shall never die.<br> <b>24. </b>The cherubim have guarded well for every soul this treasure box, and whosoever will enter in and find his own.<br> <b>25. </b>Now Kaspar heard the Hebrew master speak and he exclaimed, Behold, the wisdom of the gods has come to men!<br> <b>26. </b>And Jesus went his way, and in the sacred groves of Cyrus, where the multitudes were met, he taught and healed the sick.</p>
