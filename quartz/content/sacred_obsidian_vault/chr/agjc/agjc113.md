 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 110</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Miriam sings a song of victory. The song. Jesus reveals the symbolic character of the journey of Israel from Egypt to Canaam.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>And Miriam stood before the surging crowd, and casting up her eyes to heaven she sung anew the song of victory:<br> <b>2. </b>Bring forth the harp, the vina and the lyre; bring forth the highest sounding cymbal, all ye choirs of heaven. Join in the song, the new, new song.<br> <b>3. </b>The Lord of hosts has stooped to hear the cries of men, and lo, the citadel of Beelzebul is shaking as a leaf before the wind.<br> <b>4. </b>The sword of Gideon is again unsheathed.<br> <b>5. </b>The Lord, with his own hand has pulled far back the curtains of the night; the sun of truth is flooding heaven and earth;<br> <b>6. </b>The demons of the dark, of ignorance and death, are fleeing fast; are disappearing as the dew beneath the morning sun.<br> <b>7. </b>God is our strength and song; is our salvation and our hope, and we will build anew a house for him;<br> <b>8. </b>Will cleanse our hearts, and purify their chambers, every one. We are the temple of the Holy Breath.<br> <b>9. </b>We need no more a tent within the wilderness; no more a temple built with hands.<br> <b>10. </b>We do not seek the Holy Land, nor yet Jerusalem.<br> <b>11. </b>We are the tent of God; we are his temple built without the sound of edged tools.<br> <b>12. </b>We are the Holy Land; we are the New Jerusalem; Allelujah, praise the Lord!<br> <b>13. </b>And when the song was done the multitudes exclaimed, Praise God.<br> <b>14. </b>And Jesus said, Behold the way!<br> <b>15. </b>The sons of men have groped for ages in the darkness of Egyptian night.<br> <b>16. </b>The Pharaohs of sense have bound them with their chains.<br> <b>17. </b>But God has whispered through the mists of time and told them of a land of liberty and love.<br> <b>18. </b>And he has sent his Logos forth to light the way.<br> <b>19. </b>The Red Sea rolls between the promised land and Egypt's sands.<br> <b>20. </b>The Red Sea is the carnal mind.<br> <b>21. </b>Behold, the Logos reaches out his hand; the sea divides; the carnal mind is reft in twain; the sons of men walk through dry shod.<br> <b>22. </b>The Pharaohs of sense would stay them in their flight; the waters of the sea return; the Pharaohs of sense are lost and men are free.<br> <b>23. </b>For just a little while men tread the wilderness of Sin; the Logos leads the way;<br> <b>24. </b>And when at last men stand upon the Jordan's brink, these waters stay, and men step forth into their own.</p>
