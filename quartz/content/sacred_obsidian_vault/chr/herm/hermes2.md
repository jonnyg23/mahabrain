 <h2>The Corpus Hermeticum</h2>
 
 
 
 <h3>translated by G.R.S. Mead</h3>
 
 
 
 <h2>II.  To Asclepius
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;This dialogue sets forth the difference between the physical
 
 
 
 and metaphysical worlds in the context of Greek natural philosophy.
 
 
 
  Some of the language is fairly technical:  the "errant spheres"
 
 
 
  of sections 6 and 7 are the celestial spheres carrying the planets,
 
 
 
 while the "inerrant sphere" is that of the fixed stars.
 
 
 
  It's useful to keep in mind, also, that "air" and "spirit"
 
 
 
 are interchangeable concepts in Greek thought, and that the concept
 
 
 
 of the Good has a range of implications which don't come across
 
 
 
 in the English word:  one is that the good of any being, in Greek
 
 
 
 thought, was also that being's necessary goal.

 &lt;The criticism of childlessness in section 17 should probably
 
 
 
 be read as a response to the Christian ideal of celibacy, which
 
 
 
 horrified many people in the ancient world.  - JMG&gt;

 1.  Hermes:  All that is moved, Asclepius, is it not moved
 
 
 
 in something and by something?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Asclepius:  Assuredly.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  And must not that in which it's moved be greater than
 
 
 
 the moved? 
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  It must.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  Mover, again, has greater power than moved?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  It has, of course.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  The nature, furthermore, of that in which it's moved must
 
 
 
 be quite other from the nature of the moved?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  It must completely.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 2.  H: Is not, again, this cosmos vast, [so vast] that than
 
 
 
 it there exists no body greater?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  Assuredly.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  And massive, too, for it is crammed with multitudes of
 
 
 
 other mighty frames, nay, rather all the other bodies that there
 
 
 
 are?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  It is.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  And yet the cosmos is a body?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  It is a body.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  And one that's moved?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 3.  A:  Assuredly.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  Of what size, then, must be the space in which it's moved,
 
 
 
 and of what kind [must be] the nature [of that space]?  Must it
 
 
 
 not be far vaster [than the cosmos], in order that it may be able
 
 
 
 to find room for its continued course, so that the moved may not
 
 
 
 be cramped for want of room and lose its motion?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  Something, Thrice-greatest one, it needs must be, immensely
 
 
 
 vast.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 4.  H:  And of what nature?  Must it not be, Asclepius, of
 
 
 
 just the contrary?  And is not contrary to body bodiless?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  Agreed.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  Space, then, is bodiless.  But bodiless must either be
 
 
 
 some godlike thing or God [Himself].  And by "some godlike
 
 
 
 thing" I mean no more the generable [i.e., that which is
 
 
 
 generated] but the ingenerable.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 5.  If, then, space be some godlike thing, it is substantial;
 
 
 
 but if 'tis God [Himself], it transcends substance.  But it is
 
 
 
 to be thought of otherwise [than God], and in this way.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 God is first "thinkable" &lt;or "intelligible"&gt;
 
 
 
 for us, not for Himself, for that the thing that's thought doth
 
 
 
 fall beneath the thinker's sense.  God then cannot be "thinkable"
 
 
 
 unto Himself, in that He's thought of by Himself as being nothing
 
 
 
 else but what He thinks.  But he is "something else"
 
 
 
 for us, and so He's thought of by us.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 6.  If space is, therefore, to be thought, [it should] not,
 
 
 
 [then, be thought as] God, but space.  If God is also to be thought,
 
 
 
 [He should] not [be conceived] as space, but as energy that can
 
 
 
 contain [all space].
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Further, all that is moved is moved not in the moved but in
 
 
 
 the stable.  And that which moves [another] is of course stationary,
 
 
 
 for 'tis impossible that it should move with it.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  How is it, then, that things down here, Thrice-greatest
 
 
 
 one, are moved with those that are [already] moved?  For thou
 
 
 
 hast said the errant spheres were moved by the inerrant one.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  This is not, O Asclepius, a moving with, but one against;
 
 
 
 they are not moved with one another, but one against the other.
 
 
 
  It is this contrariety which turneth the resistance of their
 
 
 
 motion into rest.  For that resistance is the rest of motion.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 7.  Hence, too, the errant spheres, being moved contrarily
 
 
 
 to the inerrant one, are moved by one another by mutual contrariety,
 
 
 
 [and also] by the spable one through contrariety itself.  And
 
 
 
 this can otherwise not be.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 The Bears up there &lt;i.e., Ursa Major and Minor&gt;, which
 
 
 
 neither set nor rise, think'st thou they rest or move?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  They move, Thrice-greatest one.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  And what their motion, my Asclepius?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  Motion that turns for ever round the same.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  But revolution - motion around same - is fixed by rest.
 
 
 
  For "round-the-same" doth stop "beyond-same".
 
 
 
  "Beyond-same" then, being stopped, if it be steadied
 
 
 
 in "round-same" - the contrary stands firm, being rendered
 
 
 
 ever stable by its contrariety.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 8.  Of this I'll give thee here on earth an instance, which
 
 
 
 the eye can see.  Regard the animals down here - a man, for instance,
 
 
 
 swimming!  The water moves, yet the resistance of his hands and
 
 
 
 feet give him stability, so that he is not borne along with it,
 
 
 
 nor sunk thereby.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  Thou hast, Thrice-greatest one, adduced a most clear instance.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  All motion, then, is caused in station and by station.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 The motion, therefore, of the cosmos (and of every other hylic
 
 
 
 &lt;i.e., material&gt; animal) will not be caused by things exterior
 
 
 
 to the cosmos, but by things interior [outward] to the exterior
 
 
 
 - such [things] as soul, or spirit, or some such other thing incorporeal.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 'Tis not the body that doth move the living thing in it; nay,
 
 
 
 not even the whole [body of the universe a lesser] body e'en though
 
 
 
 there be no life in it.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 9.  A:  What meanest thou by this, Thrice-greatest one?  Is
 
 
 
 it not bodies, then, that move the stock and stone and all the
 
 
 
 other things inanimate?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  By no means, O Asclepius.  The something-in-the-body,
 
 
 
 the that-which-moves the thing inanimate, this surely's not a
 
 
 
 body, for that it moves the two of them - both body of the lifter
 
 
 
 and the lifted?  So that a thing that's lifeless will not move
 
 
 
 a lifeless thing.  That which doth move [another thing] is animate,
 
 
 
 in that it is the mover.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Thou seest, then, how heavy laden is the soul, for it alone
 
 
 
 doth lift two bodies.  That things, moreover, moved are moved
 
 
 
 in something as well as moved by something is clear.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 10.  A:  Yea, O Thrice-greatest one, things moved must needs
 
 
 
 be moved in something void.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  Thou sayest well, O [my] Asclepius!  For naught of things
 
 
 
 that are is void.  Alone the "is-not" is void [and]
 
 
 
 stranger to subsistence.  For that which is subsistent can never
 
 
 
 change to void.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  Are there, then, O Thrice-greatest one, no such things
 
 
 
 as an empty cask, for instance, and an empty jar, a cup and vat,
 
 
 
 and other things like unto them?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  Alack, Asclepius, for thy far-wandering from the truth!
 
 
 
  Think'st thou that things most full and most replete are void?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 11.  A:  How meanest thou, Thrice-greatest one?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  Is not air body?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  It is.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  And doth this body not pervade all things, and so, pervading,
 
 
 
 fill them?  And "body"; doth body not consist from blending
 
 
 
 of the "four" &lt;elements&gt;?  Full, then, of air
 
 
 
 are all thou callest void; and if of air, then of the "four".
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Further, of this the converse follows, that all thou callest
 
 
 
 full are void - of air; for that they have their space filled
 
 
 
 out with other bodies, and, therefore, are not able to receive
 
 
 
 the air therein.  These, then, which thou dost say are void, they
 
 
 
 should be hollow named, not void; for they not only are, but they
 
 
 
 are full of air and spirit.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 12.  A:  Thy argument (logos), Thrice-greatest one, is not
 
 
 
 to be gainsaid; air is a body.  Further, it is this body which
 
 
 
 doth pervade all things, and so, pervading, fill them.  What are
 
 
 
 we, then, to call that space in which the all doth move?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  The bodiless, Asclepius.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  What, then, is Bodiless?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  'Tis Mind and Reason (logos), whole out of whole, all
 
 
 
 self-embracing, free from all body, from all error free, unsensible
 
 
 
 to body and untouchable, self stayed in self, containing all,
 
 
 
 preserving those that are, whose rays, to use a likeness, are
 
 
 
 Good, Truth, Light beyond light, the Archetype of soul.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 A:  What, then, is God?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 13.  H:  Not any one of these is He; for He it is that causeth
 
 
 
 them to be, both all and each and every thing of all that are.
 
 
 
  Nor hath He left a thing beside that is-not; but they are all
 
 
 
 from things-that-are and not from things-that-are-not.  For that
 
 
 
 the things-that-are-not have naturally no power of being anything,
 
 
 
 but naturally have the power of the inability-to-be.  And, conversely,
 
 
 
 the things-that-are have not the nature of some time not-being.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 14.  A:  What say'st thou ever, then, God is?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 H:  God, therefore, is not Mind, but Cause that the Mind is;
 
 
 
 God is not Spirit, but Cause that Spirit is; God is not Light,
 
 
 
 but Cause that the Light is.  Hence one should honor God with
 
 
 
 these two names [the Good and Father] - names which pertain to
 
 
 
 Him alone and no one else.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 For no one of the other so-called gods, no one of men, or
 
 
 
 daimones, can be in any measure Good, but God alone; and He is
 
 
 
 Good alone and nothing else.  The rest of things are separable
 
 
 
 all from the Good's nature; for [all the rest] are soul and body,
 
 
 
 which have no place that can contain the Good.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 15.  For that as mighty is the Greatness of the Good as is
 
 
 
 the Being of all things that are - both bodies and things bodiless,
 
 
 
 things sensible and intelligible things.  Call thou not, therefore,
 
 
 
 aught else Good, for thou would'st imious be; nor anything at
 
 
 
 all at any time call God but Good alone, for so thou would'st
 
 
 
 again be impious.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 16.  Though, then, the Good is spoken of by all, it is not
 
 
 
 understood by all, what thing it is.  Not only, then, is God not
 
 
 
 understood by all, but both unto the gods and some of the men
 
 
 
 they out of ignorance do give the name of Good, though they can
 
 
 
 never either be or become Good.  For they are very different from
 
 
 
 God, while Good can never be distinguished from Him, for that
 
 
 
 God is the same as Good.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 The rest of the immortal ones are nonetheless honored with
 
 
 
 the name of God, and spoken of as gods; but God is Good not out
 
 
 
 of courtesy but out of nature.  For that God's nature and the
 
 
 
 Good is one; one os the kind of both, from which all other kinds
 
 
 
 [proceed].
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 The Good is he who gives all things and naught receives. 
 
 
 
 God, then, doth give all things and receive naught.  God, then,
 
 
 
 is Good, and Good is God.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 17.  The other name of God is Father, again because He is
 
 
 
 the that-which-maketh-all.  The part of father is to make.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Wherefore child-making is a very great and a most pious thing
 
 
 
 in life for them who think aright, and to leave life on earth
 
 
 
 without a child a very great misfortune and impiety; and he who
 
 
 
 hath no child is punished by the daimones after death.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And this is the punishment:  that that man's soul who hath
 
 
 
 no child, shall be condemned unto a body with neither man's nor
 
 
 
 woman's nature, a thing accursed beneath the sun.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Wherefore, Asclepius, let not your sympathies be with the
 
 
 
 man who hath no child, but rather pity his mishap, knowing what
 
 
 
 punishment abides for him.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Let all that has been said then, be to thee, Asclepius, an
 
 
 
 introduction to the gnosis of the nature of all things.
