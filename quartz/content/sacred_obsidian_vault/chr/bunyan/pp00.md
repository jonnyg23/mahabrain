 The Author's Apology
 
 
 For His Book
 
 
 When at the first I took my Pen in hand
 Thus for to write; I did not understand
 That I at all should make a little Book
 In such a mode; Nay, I had undertook
 To make another, which when almost done,
 Before I was aware I this begun.
 
 
 And thus it was: I was writing of the Way
 And Race of Saints, in this our Gospel-day,
 Fell suddenly into an Allegory
 About their Journey, and the way to Glory,
 In more than twenty things which I set down:
 This done, I twenty more had in my Crown,
 And they again began to multiply,
 Like sparks that from the coals of fire do fly.
 Nay then, thought I, if that you breed so fast,
 I'll put you by yourselves, lest you at last
 Should prove and infinitum, and eat out
 The Book that I already am about.
 
 
 Well, so I did; but yet I did not think
 To shew to all this World my Pen and Ink
 In such a mode; I only thought to make
 I knew not what: nor did I undertake
 Thereby to please my Neighbor; no not I;
 I did it mine own self to gratifie.
 
 
 Neither did I but vacant seasons spend
 In this my Scribble; nor did I intend
 But to divert myself in doing this
 From worser thoughts which make me do amiss.
 
 
 Thus I set Pen to Paper with delight,
 And quickly had my thoughts in black and white.
 For having now my Method by the end,
 Still as I pull'd, it came; and so I penn'd
 It down, until it came at last to be
 For length and breadth the bigness which you see.
 
 
 Well, when I had thus put mine ends together,
 I shew'd them others, that I might see whether
 They would condemn them, or them justifie;
 And some said, Let them live; some, Let them die;
 Some said, John, print it; others said, Not so:
 Some said, It might do good; others said, No.
 
 
 Now was I in a straight, and did not see
 Which was the best thing to be done by me:
 At last I thought, Since you are thus divided,
 I print it will, and so the case decided.
 
 
 For, thought I, some I see would have it done,
 Though others in that Channel do not run.
 To prove then who advised for the best,
 Thus I thought fit to put it to the test.
 
 
 I further thought, if now I did deny
 Those that would have it thus, to gratifie,
 I did not know but hinder them I might
 Of that which would to them be great delight.
 
 
 For those which were not for its coming forth
 I said to them, Offend you I am loth,
 Yet since your Brethren pleased with it be,
 Forbear to judge till you do further see.
 
 
 If that thou wilt not read, let it alone;
 Some love the meat, some love to pick the bone:
 Yea, that I might them better palliate,
 I did too with them thus Expostulate:
 
 
 May I not write in such a stile as this?
 In such a method too, and yet not miss
 Mine end, thy good? why may it not be done?
 Dark Clouds bring Waters, when the bright bring none.
 Yea, dark or bright, if they their Silver drops
 Cause to descend, the Earth, by yielding Crops,
 Gives praise to both, and carpeth not at either,
 But treasures up the Fruit they yield together;
 Yea, so commixes both, that in her Fruit
 None can distinguish this from that: they suit
 Her well, when hungry; but, if she be full,
 She spues out both, and makes their blessings null.
 
 
 You see the ways the Fisher-man doth take
 To catch the Fish; what Engines doth he make?
 Behold how he engageth all his Wits,
 Also his Snares, Lines, Angles, Hooks, and Nets.
 Yet Fish there be, that neither Hook, nor Line,
 Nor Snare, nor Net, nor Engine can make thine;
 They must be grop'd for, and be tickled too,
 Or they will not be catch'd, whate'er you do.
 
 
 How doth the Fowler seek to catch his Game
 By divers means, all which one cannot name?
 His Gun, his Nets, his Lime-twigs, Light, and Bell;
 He creeps, he goes, he stands; yea who can tell
 Of all his postures? Yet there's none of these
 Will make him master of what Fowls he please.
 Yea, he must Pipe and Whistle to catch this;
 Yet if he does so, that Bird he will miss.
 
 
 If that a Pearl may in a Toad's head dwell,
 And may be found too in an Oyster-shell;
 If things that promise nothing do contain
 What better is than Gold; who will disdain,
 That have an inkling of it, there to look,
 That they may find it? Now my little Book
 (Though void of all those Paintings that may make
 It with this or the other man to take)
 Is not without those things that do excel
 What do in brave, but empty notions dwell.
 
 
 Well, yet I am not fully satisfied,
 That this your Book will stand, when soundly try'd.
 
 
 Why, what's the matter? It is dark. What tho?
 But it is feigned: What of that I tro?
 Some men, by feigning words as dark as mine,
 Make truth to spangle, and its rays to shine.
 But they want solidness. Speak man thy mind.
 They drowned the weak; Metaphors make us blind.
 
 
 Solidity indeed becomes the Pen
 Of him that writeth things Divine to men;
 But must I needs want solidness, because
 By Metaphors I speak? Were not God's Laws,
 His Gospel-Laws, in olden time held forth
 By Types, Shadows, and Metaphors? Yet loth
 Will any sober man be to find fault
 With them, lest he be found for to assault
 The highest Wisdom. No, he rather stoops,
 And seeks to find out what by Pins and Loops,
 By Calves, and Sheep, by Heifers, and by Rams,
 By Birds, and Herbs, and by the blood of Lambs,
 God speaketh to him. And happy is he
 That finds the light and grace that in them be.
 
 
 Be not too forward therefore to conclude
 That I want solidness, that I am rude:
 All things solid in shew not solid be;
 All things in parables despise not we;
 Lest things most hurtful lightly we receive,
 And things that good are, of our souls bereave.
 
 
 My dark and cloudy words they do but hold
 The Truth, as Cabinets inclose the Gold.
 
 
 The Prophets used much by Metaphors
 To set forth Truth; yea, whoso considers
 Christ, his Apostles too, shall plainly see,
 That Truths to this day in such Mantles be.
 
 
 Am I afraid to say that Holy Writ,
 Which for its Stile and Phrase puts down all Wit,
 Is everywhere so full of all these things,
 Dark Figures, Allegories? Yet there springs
 From that same Book that lustre, and those rays
 Of light, that turns our darkest nights to days.
 
 
 Come, let my Carper to his Life now look,
 And find there darker lines than in my Book
 He findeth any; Yea, and let him know,
 That in his best things there are worse lines too.
 
 
 May we but stand before impartial men,
 To his poor One I dare adventure Ten,
 That they will take my meaning in these lines
 Far better than his lies in Silver Shrines.
 Come, Truth, although in Swaddling-clouts, I find,
 Informs the Judgment, rectifies the Mind,
 Pleases the Understanding, makes the Will
 Submit; the Memory too it doth fill
 With what doth our Imagination please;
 Likewise it tends our troubles to appease.
 
 
 Sound words I know Timothy is to use,
 And old Wive's Fables he is to refuse;
 But yet grave Paul him nowhere doth forbid
 The use of Parables; in which lay hid
 That Gold, those Pearls, and precious stones that were
 Worth digging for, and that with greatest care.
 
 
 Let me add one word more. O man of God,
 Art thou offended? Dost thou wish I had
 Put forth my matter in another dress,
 Or that I had in things been more express?
 Three things let me propound, then I submit
 To those that are my betters, as is fit.
 
 
 1. I find not that I am denied the use
 Of this my method, so I no abuse
 Put on the Words, Things, Readers; or be rude
 In handling Figure or Similitude,
 In application; but, all that I may,
 Seek the advance of Truth this or that way.
 Denied, did I say? Nay, I have leave,
 (Example too, and that from them that have
 God better pleased, by their words or ways,
 Than any man that breatheth now a-days)
 Thus to express my mind, thus to declare
 Things unto thee, that excellentest are.
 
 
 2. I find that men (as high as Trees) will write
 Dialogue-wise; yet no man doth them slight
 For writing so; Indeed if they abuse
 Truth, cursed be they, and the craft they use
 To that intent; but yet let Truth be free
 To make her sallies upon thee and me,
 Which way it pleases God. For who knows how,
 Better than he that taught us first to Plow,
 To guide our Mind and Pens for his Design?
 And he makes base things usher in Divine.
 
 
 3. I find that Holy Writ in many places
 Hath semblance with this method, where the cases
 Do call for one thing, to set forth another;
 Use it I may then, and yet nothing smother
 Truth's golden Beams: nay, by this method may
 Make it cast forth its rays as light as day.
 
 
 And now, before I do put up my Pen,
 I'll shew the profit of my Book, and then
 Commit both thee and it unto that hand
 That pulls the strong down, and makes weak ones stand.
 
 
 This Book it chalketh out before thine eyes
 The man that seeks the everlasting Prize;
 It shews you whence he comes, whither he goes,
 What he leaves undone, also what he does;
 It also shews you how he runs and runs,
 Till he unto the Gate of Glory comes.
 
 
 It shews too, who set out for life amain,
 As if the lasting Crown they would obtain;
 Here also you may see the reason why
 They lose their labour, and like Fools do die.
 
 
 This Book will make a Traveller of thee,
 If by its Counsel thou wilt ruled be;
 It will direct thee to the Holy Land,
 If thou wilt its directions understand:
 Yea, it will make the slothful active be;
 The blind also delightful things to see.
 
 
 Art thou for something rare and profitable?
 Wouldest thou see a Truth within a Fable?
 Art thou forgetful? Wouldest thou remember
 From New-year's-day to the last of December?
 Then read my Fancies, they will stick like Burrs,
 And may be to the Helpless, Comforters.
 
 
 This Book is writ in such a Dialect
 As may the minds of listless men affect:
 It seems a novelty, and yet contains
 Nothing but sound and honest Gospel strains.
 
 
 Would'st thouedivert thyself from Melancholy?
 Would'st thou be pleasant, yet be far from folly?
 Would'st thou read Riddles, and their Explanation?
 Or else be drowned in thy Contemplation?
 Dost thou love picking meat? Or would'st thou see
 A man i' th' Clouds, and hear him speak to thee?
 Would'st thou be in a Dream, and yet not sleep?
 Or would'st thou in a moment laugh and weep?
 Wouldest thou lose thyself, and catch no harm,
 And find thyself again without a charm?
 Would'st read thyself, and read thou know'st not what,
 And yet know whether thou art blest or not,
 By reading the same lines? O then come hither,
 And lay my Book, thy Head, and Heart together.
