 Section VI.
 
 
      When the Family where Christiana was, saw that they had a purpose to go
 forward, they called the whole house together, to give thanks to their King
 for sending of them such profitable Guests as these. Which done, they said to
 Christiana, And shall we not shew thee something, according as our custom is
 to do to Pilgrims, on which thou mayest meditate when thou art upon the way?
 So they took Christiana her Children and Mercy, into the closet, and shewed
 them one of the Apples that Eve did eat of and that she also did give to her
 Husband, and that for the eating of which they both were turned out of
 Paradise, and asked her what she thought that was? Then Christiana said, 'Tis
 Food or Poison, I know not which. So they opened the matter to her, and she
 held up her hands and wondered.
 
 
      Then they had her to a place, and shewed her Jacob's Ladder. Now at that
 time there were some Angels ascending upon it. So Christiana looked and
 looked, to see the Angels go up, and so did the rest of the Company. Then they
 were going in to another place to shew them something else, but James said to
 his Mother, Pray bid them stay here a little longer, for this is a curious
 sight. So they turned again, and stood feeding their eyes with this so
 pleasant a prospect. After this they had them into a place where did hang up a
 Golden Anchor, so they bid Christiana take it down, For, said they, you shall
 have it with you, for 'tis of absolute necessity that you should, that you may
 lay hold of that within the vail, and stand steadfast, in case you should meet
 with turbulent weather. So they were glad thereof. Then they took them, and
 had them to the Mount upon which Abraham our Father had offered up Isaac his
 Son, and shewed them the Altar, the Wood, the Fire, and the Knife, for they
 remain to be seen to this very day. When they had seen it, they held up their
 hands and blest themselves, and said, Oh what a man for love to his Master,
 and for denial to himself was Abraham. After they had shewed them all these
 things, Prudence took them into the Dining-room, where stood a pair of
 excellent Virginals, so she played upon them, and turned what she had shewed
 them into this excellent song, saying,
 
 
 Eve's Apple we have shew'd you,
 Of that be you aware;
 You have seen Jacob's Ladder too,
 Upon which Angels are.
 An Anchor you received have,
 But let not these suffice,
 Until with Abr'am you have gave
 Your best a Sacrifice.
 
 
      Now about this time, one knocked at the door; so the Porter opened, and
 behold Mr Great-heart was there; but when he was come in, what joy was
 there? For it came now fresh again into their minds, how but a while ago he
 had slain old Grim Bloody-man the Giant, and delivered them from the Lions.
 
 
      Then said Mr Great-heart to Christiana and to Mercy, My Lord has sent
 each of you a Bottle of Wine, and also some parched Corn, together with a
 couple of Pomgranates. He has also sent the Boys some Figs and Raisins to
 refresh you on your way.
 
 
      Then they addressed themselves to their Journey, and Prudence and Piety
 went along with them. When they came at the gate, Christiana asked the Porter
 if any of late went by? He said, No, only one some time since, who also told
 me that of late there had been a great robbery committed on the King's
 Highway, as you go; but he saith the thieves are taken, and will shortly be
 tried for their lives. Then Christiana and Mercy were afraid, but Matthew
 said, Mother fear nothing, as long as Mr Great-heart is to go with us and to
 be our Conductor.
 
 
      Then said Christiana to the Porter, Sir, I am much obliged to you for all
 the kindnesses that you have shewed me since I came hither, and also for that
 you have been so loving and kind to my Children. I know not how to gratify
 your kindness. Wherefore pray as a token of my respects to you, accept of this
 small mite. So she put a gold Angel in his hand, and he made her a low
 obeisance, and said, Let thy Garments be always white, and let thy Head want
 no Ointment. Let Mercy live and not die, and let not her works be few. And to
 the Boys he said, Do you fly youthful lusts, and follow after Godliness with
 them that are grave and wise, so shall you put gladness into your Mother's
 heart, and obtain praise of all that are sober-minded. So they thanked the
 Porter and departed.
 
 
      Now I saw in my Dream that they went forward until they were come to the
 brow of the Hill, where Piety bethinking herself, cried out, Alas! I have
 forgot what I intended to bestow upon Christiana and her Companions, I will go
 back and fetch it. So she ran and fetched it. While she was gone, Christiana
 thought she heard in a Grove a little way off on the right hand, a most
 curious, melodious note, with words much like these,
 
 
 Through all my Life thy Favour is
 So frankly shew'd to me,
 That in thy House for evermore
 My dwelling-place shall be.
 
 
      And listening still she thought she heard another answer it, saying,
 
 
 For why? The Lord our God is good,
 His Mercy is for ever sure;
 His Truth at all times firmly stood,
 And shall from age to age endure.
 
 
      So Christiana asked Prudence what 'twas that made those curious notes?
 They are, said she, our Country Birds; they sing these notes but seldom,
 except it be at the Spring, when the Flowers appear, and the Sun shines warm,
 and then you may hear them all day long. I often, said she, go out to hear
 them, we also oft-times keep them tame in our house. They are very fine
 company for us when we are melancholy, also they make the Woods and Groves and
 Solitary places, places desirous to be in.
 
 
      By this time Piety was come again; so she said to Christiana, Look here,
 I have brought thee a scheme of all those things that thou hast seen at our
 house, upon which thou mayest look when thou findest thyself forgetful, and
 call those things again to remembrance for thy edification and comfort.
 
 
      Now they began to go down the Hill into the Valley of Humiliation. It was
 a steep Hill, and the way was slippery; but they were very careful, so they
 got down pretty well. When they were down in the Valley, Piety said to
 Christiana, This is the place where Christian your Husband met with that foul
 Fiend Apollyon, and where they had that Fight that they had; I know you cannot
 but have heard thereof. But be of good courage; as long you have here Mr Great
 - heart to be your Guide and Conductor, we hope you will fare the better. So
 when these two had committed the Pilgrims unto the conduct of their Guide, he
 went forward and they went after.
 
 
      Great-heart. Then said Mr Great-heart, we need not to be so afraid of
 this Valley, for here is nothing to hurt us unless we procure it to ourselves.
 'Tis true, Christian did here meet with Apollyon, with whom he also had a sore
 Combat; but that fray was the fruit of those slips that he got in his going
 down the Hill; for they that get slips there, must look for combats here. And
 hence it is that this Valley has got so hard a name; for the common people
 when they hear that some frightful thing has befallen such a one in such a
 place, are of an opinion that that place is haunted with some foul Fiend or
 evil Spirit; when alas it is for the fruit of their doing, that such things do
 befall them there.
 
 
      This Valley of Humiliation is of itself as fruitful a place as any the
 Crow flies over; and I am persuaded if we could hit upon it, we might find
 somewhere hereabouts, something that might give us an account why Christian
 was so hardly beset in this place.
 
 
      Then James said to his Mother, Lo, yonder stands a Pillar, and it looks
 as if something was written thereon, let us go and see what it is. So they
 went, and found there written, Let Christian's slips before he came hither,
 and the Battles that he met with in this place, be a warning to those that
 come after. Lo, said their Guide, did not I tell you that there was something
 hereabouts that would give intimation of the reason why Christian was so hard
 beset in this place? Then turning himself to Christiana, he said, No
 disparagement to Christian more than to many others whose hap and lot his was;
 for 'tis easier going up than down this Hill, and that can be said but of few
 Hills in all these parts of the world. But we will leave the good man, he is
 at rest, he also had a brave Victory over his Enemy, let him grant that
 dwelleth above, that we fare no worse when we come to be tried than he.
 
 
      But we will come again to this Valley of Humiliation. It is the best and
 most fruitful piece of ground in all those parts. It is fat ground, and as you
 see, consisteth much in meadows; and if a man was to come here in the Summer -
 time, as we do now, if he knew not anything before thereof, and if he also
 delighted himself in the sight of his eyes, he might see that would be
 delightful to him. Behold how green this Valley is, also how beautified with
 Lillies. I have also known many labouring men that have got good estates in
 this Valley of Humiliation (for God resisteth the Proud, but gives more Grace
 to the Humble) for indeed it is a very fruitful soil, and doth bring forth by
 handfuls. Some also have wished that the next way to their Father's house were
 here, that they might be troubled no more with either Hills or Mountains, to
 go over; but the way is the way, and there's an end.
 
 
      Now as they were going along and talking, they espied a Boy feeding his
 Father's Sheep. The Boy was in very mean cloaths, but of a very fresh and well
 - favoured countenance, and as he sate by himself, he sung. Hark, said Mr
 Great-heart, to what the Shepherd's Boy saith. So they hearkened, and he
 said,
 
 
 He that is down needs fear no fall,
 He that is low no pride;
 He that is humble, ever shall
 Have God to be his Guide.
 I am content with what I have,
 Little be it, or much:
 And Lord, contentment still I crave,
 Because thou savest such.
 Fulness to such a burden is
 That go on Pilgrimage;
 Here little, and hereafter Bliss,
 Is best from age to age.
 
 
      Then said their Guide, Do you hear him? I will dare to say, that this Boy
 lives a merrier life, and wears more of that Herb called Heart's-ease in his
 bosom, than he that is clad in Silk and Velvet; but we will proceed in our
 discourse.
 
 
      In this Valley our Lord formerly had his Country-house; he loved much
 to be here; he loved also to walk these Meadows, for he found the air was
 pleasant. Besides here a man shall be free from the noise, and from the
 hurryings of this life. All states are full of Noise and Confusion, only the
 Valley of Humiliation is that empty and solitary place. Here a man shall not
 be so let and hindred in his Contemplation, as in other places he is apt to
 be. This is a Valley that nobody walks in, but those that love a Pilgrim's
 life. And tho' Christian had the hard hap to meet here with Apollyon, and to
 enter with him a brisk encounter, yet I must tell you, that in former times
 men have met with Angels here, have found Pearls here, and have in this place
 found the words of Life.
 
 
      Did I say our Lord had here in former days his Country-house, and that
 he loved here to walk? I will add, in this place, and to the people that live
 and trace these Grounds, he has left a yearly revenue to be faithfully payed
 them at certain seasons, for their maintenance by the way, and for their
 further encouragement to go on in their Pilgrimage.
 
 
      Samuel. Now as they went on, Samuel said to Mr. Great-heart, Sir, I
 perceive that in this Valley my Father and Apollyon had their Battle, but
 whereabout was the Fight, for I perceive this Valley is large?
 
 
      Great-heart. Your Father had that Battle with Apollyon at a place
 yonder before us, in a narrow passage just beyond Forgetful Green. And indeed
 that place is the most dangerous place in all these parts. For if at any time
 the Pilgrims meet with any brunt, it is when they forget what favours they
 have received, and how unworthy they are of them. This is the place also where
 others have been hard put to it; but more of the place when we are come to it;
 for I persuade myself that to this day there remains either some sign of the
 Battle, or some Monument to testify that such a Battle there was fought.
 
 
      Mercy. Then said Mercy, I think I am as well in this Valley as I have
 been anywhere else in all our Journey, the place methinks suits with my
 spirit. I love to be in such places where there is no rattling with Coaches,
 nor rumbling with Wheels. Methinks here one may without much molestation, be
 thinking what he is, whence he came, what he has done, and to what the King
 has called him. Here one may think, and break at heart, and melt in one's
 spirit, until one's eyes become like the Fishpools of Heshbon. They that go
 rightly through this Valley of Baca make it a Well, the Rain that God sends
 down from Heaven upon them that are here also filleth the Pools. This Valley
 is that from whence also the King will give to their vineyards, and they that
 go through it shall sing, as Christian did for all he met with Apollyon.
 
 
      Great-heart. 'Tis true, said their Guide, I have gone through this
 Valley many a time, and never was better than when here.
 
 
      I have also been a Conduct to several Pilgrims, and they have confessed
 the same, To this man will I look, saith the King, even to him that is Poor,
 and of a Contrite Spirit, and that trembles at my Word.
 
 
      Now they were come to the place where the afore mentioned Battle was
 fought. Then said the Guide to Christiana her Children and Mercy, This is the
 place, on this ground Christian stood, and up there came Apollyon against him.
 And look, did not I tell you? Here is some of your Husband's Blood upon these
 stones to this day; behold also how here and there are yet to be seen upon the
 place some of the shivers of Apollyon's broken Darts. See also how they did
 beat the ground with their feet as they fought, to make good their places
 against each other, how also with their by-blows they did split the very
 stones in pieces. Verily Christian did here play the man, and shewed himself
 as stout, as could, had he been there, even Hercules himself. When Apollyon
 was beat, he made his retreat to the next Valley, that is called the Valley of
 the Shadow of Death, unto which we shall come anon.
 
 
      Lo yonder also stands a Monument, on which is engraven this Battle, and
 Christian's Victory, to his fame throughout all ages. So because it stood just
 on the wayside before them, they stept to it and read the writing, which word
 for word was this.
 
 
 Hard by here was a Battle fought,
 Most strange, and yet most true;
 Christian and Apollyon sought
 Each other to subdue.
 The Man so bravely play'd the Man,
 He made the Fiend to fly;
 Of which a Monument I stand,
 The same to testify.
 
 
      When they had passed by this place, they came upon the borders of the
 Shadow of Death; and this Valley was longer than the other; a place also most
 strangely haunted with evil things, as many are able to testify. But these
 Women and Children went the better through it because they had day-light,
 and because Mr Great-heart was their Conductor.
 
 
      When they were entred upon this Valley, they thought that they heard a
 groaning as of dead men, a very great groaning. They thought also they did
 hear words of Lamentation spoken, as of some in extreme Torment. These things
 made the Boys to quake, the Women also looked pale and wan; but their Guide
 bid them be of good comfort.
 
 
      So they went on a little further, and they thought that they felt the
 ground begin to shake under them, as if some hollow place was there; they
 heard also a kind of hissing as of Serpents, but nothing as yet appeared. Then
 said the Boys, Are we not yet at the end of this doleful place? But the Guide
 also bid them be of good courage, and look well to their feet, lest haply,
 said he, you be taken in some Snare.
 
 
      Now James began to be sick, but I think the cause thereof was fear; so
 his Mother gave him some of that glass of Spirits that she had given her at
 the Interpreter's house, and three of the Pills that Mr Skill had prepared,
 and the Boy began to revive. Thus they went on till they came to about the
 middle of the Valley, and then Christiana said, Methinks I see something
 yonder upon the road before us, a thing of such a shape such as I have not
 seen. Then said Joseph, Mother, what is it? An ugly thing, Child, an ugly
 thing, said she. But Mother, what is it like? said he. 'Tis like I cannot tell
 what, said she. And now it was but a little way off. Then said she, It is
 nigh.
 
 
      Well, well, said Mr Great-heart, Let them that are most afraid keep
 close to me. So the Fiend came on, and the Conductor met it; but when it was
 just come to him, it vanished to all their sights. Then remembered they what
 had been said some time ago, Resist the Devil, and he will fly from you.
 
 
      They went therefore on, as being a little refreshed; but they had not
 gone far, before Mercy looking behind her, saw, as she thought, something most
 like a Lion, and it came a great padding pace after; and it had a hollow Voice
 of Roaring, and at every Roar that it gave it made all the Valley echo, and
 their hearts to ake, save the heart of him that was their Guide. So it came
 up, and Mr Great-heart went behind, and put the Pilgrims all before him. The
 Lion also came on apace, and Mr Great-heart addressed himself to give him
 Battle. But when he saw that it was determined that resistance should be made,
 he also drew back and came no further.
 
 
      Then they went on again, and their Conductor did go before them, till
 they came at a place where was cast up a Pit the whole breadth of the way, and
 before they could be prepared to go over that, a great Mist and a Darkness
 fell upon them, so that they could not see. Then said the Pilgrims, Alas! now
 what shall we do? But their Guide made answer, Fear not stand still and see
 what an end will be put to this also. So they stayed there because their path
 was marr'd. They then also thought that they did hear more apparently the
 noise and rushing of the Enemies, the fire also and the smoke of the Pit was
 much easier to be discerned. Then said Christiana to Mercy, Now I see what my
 poor Husband went through, I have heard much of this place, but I never wash
 here afore now. Poor man, he went here all alone in the night; he had night
 almost quite through the way; also these Fiends were busy about him as if they
 would have torn him in pieces. Many have spoke of it, but none can tell what
 the Valley of the Shadow of Death should mean, until they come in it
 themselves. The heart knows its own Bitterness, and a stranger intermeddleth
 not with its Joy. To be here is a fearful thing.
 
 
      Great-heart. This is like doing business in great Waters, or like going
 down into the deep; this is like being in the heart of the Sea, and like going
 down to the bottoms of the Mountains; now it seems as if the Earth with its
 bars were about us for ever. But let them that walk in Darkness and have no
 Light, trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon their God. For my part, as
 I have told you already, I have gone often through this Valley, and have been
 much harder put to it than now I am, and yet you see I am alive. I would not
 boast, for that I am not mine own saviour, but I trust we shall have a good
 Deliverance. Come let us pray for Light to him that can lighten our Darkness,
 and that can rebuke not only these, but all the Satans in Hell.
 
 
      So they cried and prayed, and God sent Light and Deliverance, for there
 was now no let in their way, no not there where but now they were stopt with a
 Pit. Yet they were not got through the Valley; so they went on still, and
 behold great stinks and loathsome smells, to the great annoyance of them. Then
 said Mercy to Christiana, There is not such pleasant being here as at the
 Gate, or at the Interpreter's, or at the house where we lay last.
 
 
      Oh but, said one of the Boys, it is not so bad to go through here as it
 is to abide here always, and for ought I know, one reason why we must go this
 way to the house prepared for us, is, that our home might be made the sweeter
 to us.
 
 
      Well said Samuel, quoth the Guide, thou hast now spoke like a man. Why,
 if ever I get out here again, said the Boy, I think I shall prize light and
 good way better than ever I did in all my life. Then said the Guide, We shall
 be out by and by.
 
 
      So on they went, and Joseph said, Cannot we see to the end of this Valley
 as yet? Then said the Guide, Look to your feet, for you shall presently be
 among the Snares. So they looked to their feet and went on, but they were
 troubled much with the Snares. Now when they were come among the Snares, they
 espied a man cast into the Ditch on the left hand, with his flesh all rent and
 torn. Then said the Guide, That is one Heedless, that was a going this way, he
 has lain there a great while. There was one Take-heed with him when he was
 taken and slain, but he escaped their hands. You cannot imagine how many are
 killed hereabouts, and yet men are so foolishly venturous, as to set out
 lightly on Pilgrimage, and to come without a Guide. Poor Christian, it was a
 wonder that he here escaped; but he was beloved of his God, also he had a good
 heart of his own, or else he could never a done it. Now they drew towards the
 end of the way, and just there where Christian had seen the Cave when he went
 by, out thence came forth Maul a Giant. This Maul did use to spoil young
 Pilgrims with Sophistry; and he called Great-heart by his name, and said
 unto him, How many times have you been forbidden to do these things? Then said
 Mr Great-heart, What things? What things? quoth the Giant, you know what
 things, but I will put an end to your trade. But pray, said Mr Great-heart,
 before we fall to it, let us understand wherefore we must fight. Now the Women
 and Children stood trembling, and knew not what to do. Quoth the Giant, You
 rob the Country, and rob it with the worst of thefts. These are but generals,
 said Mr Great-heart, come to particulars, man.
 
 
      Then said the Giant, Thou practisest the craft of a Kidnapper, thou
 gatherest up Women and Children, and carriest them into a strange Country, to
 the weakening of my master's Kingdom. But now Great-heart replied, I am a
 servant of the God of Heaven, my business is to persuade sinners to
 repentance, I am commanded to do my endeavour to turn Men Women and Children,
 from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; and if this be
 indeed the ground of thy quarrel, let us fall to it as soon as thou wilt.
 
 
      Then the Giant came up, and Mr Great-heart went to meet him; and as he
 went he drew his Sword, but the Giant had a Club. So without more ado they
 fell to it, and at the first blow the Giant stroke Mr Great-heart down upon
 one of his knees; with that the Women and Children cried out; so Mr Great -
 heart recovering himself, laid about him in full lusty manner, and gave the
 Giant a wound in his arm; thus he fought for the space of an hour to that
 height of heat, that the breath came out of the Giant's nostrils, as the heat
 doth out of a boiling Caldron.
 
 
      Then they sat down to rest them, but Mr Great-heart betook him to
 prayer; also the Women and Children did nothing but sigh and cry all the time
 that the Battle did last.
 
 
      When they had rested them, and taken breath, they both fell to it again,
 and Mr Great-heart with a full blow fetched the Giant down to the ground.
 Nay hold and let me recover, quoth he. So Mr Great-heart fairly let him get
 up. So to it they went again, and the Giant missed but little of all to
 breaking Mr Great-heart's skull with his Club.
 
 
      Mr Great-heart seeing that, runs to him in the full heat of his spirit,
 and pierceth him under the fifth rib; with that the Giant began to faint, and
 could hold up his Club no longer. Then Mr Great-heart seconded his blow, and
 smit the head of the Giant from his shoulders. Then the Women and Children
 rejoiced, and Mr Great-heart also praised God for the deliverance he had
 wrought.
 
 
      When this was done, they among them erected a Pillar, and fastened the
 Giant's head thereon, and wrote underneath in letters that Passengers might
 read,
 
 
 He that did wear this head, was one
 That Pilgrims did misuse;
 He stopt their way, he spared none,
 But did them all abuse;
 Until that I Great-heart arose,
 The Pilgrim's Guide to be;
 Until that I did him oppose
 That was their Enemy.
 
 
      Now I saw that they went to the Ascent that was a little way off cast up
 to be a Prospect for Pilgrims, (that was the place from whence Christian had
 the first sight of Faithful his Brother) wherefore here they sat down and
 rested, they also here did eat and drink and make merry, for that they had
 gotten deliverance from this so dangerous an Enemy. As they sat thus and did
 eat, Christiana asked the Guide if he had caught no hurt in the Battle. Then
 said Mr Great-heart No. save a little on my flesh; yet that also shall be so
 far from being to my determent, that it is at present a proof of my love to my
 Master and you, and shall be a means by Grace to increase my reward at lasts.
 
 
      Chris. But was you not afraid, good Sir, when you see him come out with
 his club?
 
 
      Great-heart. It is my duty, said he, to disrust mine own ability that I
 have reliance on him that is stronger than all.
 
 
      Chris. But what did you think when he fetched you down to the ground at
 the first blow?
 
 
      Great-Heart. Why I thought, quoth he that so my Master himself was
 served, and yet he it was that conquered at the last.
 
 
      Matt. When you all have thought what you please, I think God has been
 wonderful good unto us, both in bringing us out of this Valley, and in
 delivering us out of the hand of this Enemy; for my part I see no reason why
 we should distrust our God any more, since he has now, and in such as place as
 this, given as such testimony of his love as this.
 
 
      Then they got up and went forward. Now a little before them stood an Oak,
 and under it when they came to it, they found an old Pilgrim fast asleep; they
 knew that he was a Pilgrim by his Cloaths and his Staff and his Girdle.
 
 
      So the Guide Mr Great-heart awaked him, and the old Gentleman as he
 lift up his eyes, cried out, What's the matter? who are you? and what is your
 business here?
 
 
      Great-heart. Come man be not so hot, here is none but Friends: yet the
 old man gets up and stands upon his guard, and will know of them what they
 were. Then said the Guide, My name is Great-heart, I am the Guide of these
 Pilgrims which are going to the Coelestial Country.
 
 
      Honest. Then said Mr Honest, I cry you mercy, I fear'd that you had been
 of the company of those that some time ago did rob Little-faith of his
 money; but now I look better about me, I perceive you are honester people.
 
 
      Great-heart. Why what would or could you a done to a helped yourself,
 if we indeed had been of that company?
 
 
      Hon. Done! why I would a fought as long as breath had been in me; and had
 I so done, I am sure you could never have given me the worst on't; for a
 Christian can never be overcome, unless he shall yield of himself.
 
 
      Great-heart. Well said, Father Honest, quoth the Guide, for by this I
 know thou art a cock of the right kind, for thou hast said the truth.
 
 
      Hon. And by this also I know that thou knowest what true Pilgrimage is,
 for all others do think that we are the soonest overcome of any.
 
 
      Great-heart. Well now we are so happily met, pray let me crave your
 name, and the name of the place you came from.
 
 
      Hon. My name I cannot, but I came from the Town of Stupidity, it lieth
 about four degrees beyond the City of Destruction.
 
 
      Great-heart. Oh! are you that Countryman then? I deem I have half a
 guess of you, your name is Old Honesty, is it not? So the old Gentleman
 blushed, and said, Not Honesty in the abstract, but Honest is my name, and I
 wish that my nature shall agree to what I am called.
 
 
      Hon. But Sir, said the old Gentleman, how could you guess that I am such
 a man, since I came from such a place?
 
 
      Great-heart. I had heard of you before, by my Master, for he knows all
 things that are done on the Earth; but I have often wondered that any should
 come from your place, for your Town is worse than is the City of Destruction
 itself.
 
 
      Hon. Yes, we lie more off from the Sun, and so are more cold and
 senseless; but was a man in a Mountain of Ice, yet if the Sun of Righteousness
 will arise upon him his frozen heart shall feel a thaw; and thus it hath been
 with me.
 
 
      Great-heart. I believe it, Father Honest, I believe it, for I know the
 thing is true.
 
 
      Then the old Gentleman saluted all the Pilgrims with a holy kiss of
 charity, and asked them of their names, and how they had fared since they set
 out on their Pilgrimage.
 
 
      Chris. Then said Christiana, My name I suppose you have heard of, good
 Christian was my Husband, and these four were his Children. But can you think
 how the old Gentleman was taken, when she told them who she was! He skipped,
 he smiled, and blessed them with a thousand good wishes, saying,
 
 
      Hon. I have heard much of your Husband, and of his travels and Wars which
 he underwent in his days. Be it spoken to your comfort, the name of your
 Husband rings over all these parts of the world: his Faith, his Courage, his
 Enduring, and his Sincerity under all, has made his name famous. Then he
 turned him to the Boys, and asked them of their names, which they told him.
 And then said he unto them, Matthew, be thou like Matthew the Publican, not in
 vice but in vertue. Samuel, said he, be thou like Samuel the Prophet, a man of
 faith and prayer. Joseph, said he, be thou like Joseph in Potiphar's house,
 chaste, and one that flies from temptation. And James be thou like James the
 Just and like James the Brother of our Lord.
 
 
      Then they told him of Mercy, and how she had left her Town and her
 Kindred to come along with Christiana and with her Sons. At that the old
 honest man said, Mercy is thy name? by Mercy shalt thou be sustained, and
 carried through all those difficulties that shall assault thee in thy way,
 till thou shalt come thither where thou shalt look the Fountain of Mercy in
 the face with comfort.
 
 
      All this while the Guide Mr Great-heart was very much pleased, and
 smiled upon his Companion.
 
 
      Now as they walked along together, the Guide asked the old Gentleman if
 he did not know one Mr Fearing, that came on Pilgrimage out of his parts?
 
 
      Hon. Yes, very well, said he. He was a man that had the root of the
 matter in him, but he was one of the most troublesome Pilgrims that ever I met
 with in all my days.
 
 
      Great-heart. I perceive you knew him, for you have given a very right
 character of him.
 
 
      Hon. Knew him! I was a great Companion of his; I was with him most an
 end; when he first began to think of what would come upon us hereafter, I was
 with him.
 
 
      Great-heart. I was his Guide from my Master's house to the gates of the
 Coelestial City.
 
 
      Hon. Then you knew him to be a troublesome one.
 
 
      Great-heart. I did so, but I could very well bear it, for men of my
 calling are oftentimes intrusted with the conduct of such as he was.
 
 
      Hon. Well then, pray let us hear a little of him, and he managed himself
 under your conduct.
 
 
      Great-heart. Why, he was always afraid that he should come short of
 whither he had a desire to go. Everything frightened him that he heard anybody
 speak of, that had but the least appearance of opposition in it. I hear that
 he lay roaring at the Slough of Dispond for above a month together, nor durst
 he, for all he saw several go over before him, venture, tho' they, many of
 them, offered to lend him their hand. He would not go back again neither. The
 Coelestial City, he said, he should die if he came not to it, and yet was
 dejected at every difficulty, and stumbled at every Straw that anybody cast in
 his way. Well, after he had lain at the Slough of Dispond a great while, as I
 have told you; one Sun-shine morning, I do not know how, he ventured, and so
 got over. But when he was over, he would scarce believe it. He had, I think, a
 Slough of Dispond in his mind, a Slough that he carried everywhere with him,
 or else he could never have been as he was. So he came up to the Gate, you
 know what I mean, that stands at the head of this way, and there also he stood
 a good while before he would adventure to knock. When the Gate was opened he
 would give back, and give place to others, and say that he was not worthy; for
 for all he gat before some to the Gate, yet many of them went in before him.
 There the poor man would stand shaking and shrinking; I dare say it would have
 pitied one's heart to have seen him, nor would he go back again. At last he
 took the Hammer that hanged on the Gate in his hand, and gave a small Rap or
 two; then one opened to him, but he shrank back as before. He that opened
 stept out after him, and said, Thou trembling one, what wantest thou? With
 that he fell down to the ground. He that spoke to him wondered to see him so
 faint. So he said to him, Peace be to thee, up, for I have set open the door
 to thee, come in, for thou art blest. With that he gat up, and went in
 trembling, and when he was in, he was ashamed to shew his face. Well, after he
 had been entertained there a while, as you know how the manner is, he was bid
 go on his way, and also told the way he should take. So he came till he came
 to our house. But as he behaved himself at the Gate, so he did at my Master
 the Interpreter's door. He lay thereabout in the cold a good while, before he
 would adventure to call, yet he would not go back, and the nights were long
 and cold then. Nay he had a Note of Necessity in his bosom to my Master, to
 receive him and grant him the comfort of his house, and also to allow him a
 stout and valiant Conduct because he was himself so chickin-hearted a man;
 and yet for all that he was afraid to call at the door. So he lay up and down
 thereabouts till, poor man, he was almost starved. Yea so great was his
 Dejection, that tho' he saw several others for knocking got in, yet he was
 afraid to venture. At last, I think I looked out of the window, and perceiving
 a man to be up and down about the door, I went out to him, and asked what he
 was; but, poor man, the water stood in his eyes; so I perceived what he
 wanted. I went therefore in and told it in the house, and we shewed the thing
 to our Lord. So he sent me out again, to entreat him to come in; but I dare
 say I had hard work to do it. At last he came in, and I will say that for my
 Lord, he carried it wonderful lovingly to him. There were but few good bits at
 the Table but some of it was laid upon his trencher. Then he presented the
 Note, and my Lord looked thereon, and said his desire should be granted. So
 when he had been there a good while, he seemed to get some heart, and to be a
 little more comfortable; for my Master, you must know, is one of very tender
 bowels, specially to them that are afraid; wherefore he carried it so towards
 him as might tend most to his encouragement. Well, when he had had a sight of
 the things of the place, and was ready to take his Journey to go to the City,
 my Lord, as he did to Christian before, gave him a Bottle of Spirits, and some
 comfortable things to eat. Thus we set forward, and I went before him; but the
 man was but of few words, only he would sigh aloud.
