   <h3 align="center">IV. THE CHURCH AT THYATIRA.</h3>  
 <p align="center">(<b>A Lax Church</b>.)</p>  
 <p align="center">Rev. 2:18-29.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="1">1. <b>THE SALUTATION</b>--"And unto the Angel of the Church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath His eyes like unto a <b>flame of fire</b>, and His feet are like <b>fine brass</b>.  
 <p>2. <b>THE COMMENDATION</b>--"I know thy <b>works</b>, and <b>charity</b>, and <b>service</b>, and <b>faith</b>, and thy <b>patience</b>, and thy <b>works</b>; and the last to be more than the first.</p>  
 <p>3. <b>THE COMPLAINT</b>--"Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, <b>because thou sufferest that woman JEZEBEL</b>, which calleth herself a <b>Prophetess</b>, to <b>teach</b> and to <b>seduce</b> my servants to <b>commit fornication</b>, and to <b>eat things sacrificed unto idols</b>. And I gave her space to repent of her fornication: and she repented not. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am He which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works."</p>  
 <p>4. <b>THE PROMISE</b>--"But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. But that which ye have already, <a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a> hold fast till I come. And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give <b>power over the nations</b>: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of My Father. And I will give him the <b>MORNING STAR</b>. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches."</p></font></dir>  
 <p>In His commendation of this Church, Christ lays the emphasis on their "works," as if they depended on them, and claimed they de-served merit for "works" of "Supererogation." But He had a complaint to make against them that was terrible in its awfulness. He charges them not merely with permitting a bad woman, Jezebel, who called herself a "Prophetess," to remain in the Church, but with permitting her to "teach" her pernicious doctrines, and to "seduce" the servants to "commit fornication," and to "eat things sacrificed to idols."</p>  
 <p>Who this woman was is a question. She was a "pretender," and called herself a "prophetess." Probably she was of noble lineage. She certainly was a woman of commanding influence. Whether her real name was Jezebel or not, she was so like her prototype in the Old Testament, Jezebel the wife of Ahab, that Christ called her by that name. Jezebel, the wife of Ahab, was not by birth a daughter of Abraham, but a princess of idolatrous Tyre, at a time, too, when its royal family was famed for cruel savagery and intense devotion to Baal and Astarte. Her father, Eth-baal, a priest of the latter deity, murdered the reigning monarch Phales, and succeeded him. Ahab, king of Israel, to strengthen his kingdom, married Jezebel, and she, aided and abetted by Ahab, introduced the licentious worship of Baal into Israel, and killed all the prophets of the Lord she could lay her hands on. And this influence she exercised, not only while her husband was alive, but also during the reign of her two sons, Ahaziah and Jehoram. Moreover, the marriage of her daughter Athaliah to Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, introduced idolatrous worship into Judah, and it was not long before there was a house of Baal built in Jerusalem, and so Jezebel caused all Israel to sin after the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 1 Kings 16:29-33.</p>  
 <p>There is no question that, whether Jezebel was a real person or not, she typified a "System" and that "System" was the "Papal Church." When the "Papal Church" introduced images and pictures into its churches for the people to bow down to it became idolatrous. And when it set up its claim that the teaching of the Church is superior to the Word of God, it assumed the role of "Prophetess." A careful study of the "Papal System" from A. D. 606 to the Reformation A. D. 1520, with its institution of the "Sacrifice of the Mass" and other Pagan rites, reveals in it the sway of "Jezebelism." It was also a period of "Jezebelistic Persecution," as seen in the wars of the Crusades, and the rise of the Inquisition. A careful comparison of this "Message" with the Parable of "The Leaven" will reveal the wonderful correspondence between the two, the "Jezebel" of the Church of Thyatira, being the "Woman" of the Parable, who inserted the "Leaven" of "False Doctrine" into the Meal of the Gospel. This Period extended from A. D. 606 to the Reformation A. D. 1520.</p>
