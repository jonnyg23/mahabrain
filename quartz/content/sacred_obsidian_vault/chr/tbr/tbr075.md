   <h3 align="center">SIXTH VIAL.</h3>  <h3 align="center">(The Euphrates Dried Up.)</h3>  
 <p align="center">Rev. 16:12.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="1">"And the 'Sixth Angel' poured out his Vial upon the <b>GREAT RIVER EUPHRATES</b>; and the water thereof was <b>DRIED UP</b>, that the way of the '<b>Kings of the East</b>' might be prepared."</font></dir>  
 <p>This means the literal river Euphrates. The other Plagues will be real, and why does not this mean the drying up of the real Euphrates River. The opening up of a dry passage through the Red Sea that the Children of Israel might escape from Egypt, and the parting of the waters of the River Jordan that they might pass over into the Land of Canaan, are facts of history, why then shall not the River Euphrates be dried up that the Kings of the East and their armies may cross over and assemble for the Battle of Armageddon? The prophecy in Isa. 11:15-16, where "the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian Sea (Red Sea), and . . . shake His hand over the River (Euphrates) and smite its seven streams, so men can go over '<b>DRY SHOD</b>'," refers to this time. The Kings shall journey East from Africa, and West from Asia that they may meet in Palestine for the "Battle of Armageddon." The drying up of the Euphrates will serve a twofold purpose. It will permit the remnant of Israel from Assyria to return, and also allow the nations of the far East to be gathered for the "Judgment of Nations." Matt. 25:31-46.</p>
