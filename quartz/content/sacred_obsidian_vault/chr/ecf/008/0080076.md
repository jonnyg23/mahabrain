 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xiv-p2"></a>Having detailed to him what purpose I had conceived from the beginning, and how I had been distracted with vain inquiries, and all those things which at first I intimated to thee, my lord James, so that I need not repeat the same things now, I willingly agreed to travel with him; “for that,” said I, “is just what I was most eagerly desirous of.  But first I should wish the scheme of truth to be expounded to me, that I may know whether the soul is mortal or immortal; and if immortal, whether it shall be brought into judgment for those things which it does here.  Further, I desire to know what that righteousness <a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 81</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.iii.xiv-Page_81"></a>is, which is pleasing to God; then, further, whether the world was created, and why it was created, and whether it is to be dissolved, and whether it is to be renovated and made better, or whether after this there shall be no world at all; and, not to mention everything, I should wish to be told what is the case with respect to these and such like things.”  To this Peter answered, “I shall briefly impart to you the knowledge of these things, O Clement:  therefore listen.”</p>
