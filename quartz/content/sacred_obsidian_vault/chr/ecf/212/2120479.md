 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.v.xxv-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.v.xxv-p1.1"></a>Epistle LII.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.v.xxv-p2"></a>To John, Archbishop.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.v.xxv-p3"></a>Gregory to John, Archbishop of the Corinthians.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.xxv-p4"></a>The equity and solicitude of Secundinus our brother and fellow-bishop, which had been well known to us of old, is shewn also by the tenor of your letters.  In this matter he has greatly pleased us, and made us glad, in that in the cause of Anastasius <a name="fr_1615"></a><a href="#fn_1615"><font size="1">1616</font></a>
 , once bishop, which we charged him to enquire into, he has both exercised his vigilance diligently and judged the crimes that were discovered as justice required, and as was right.  But in all these things we return thanks to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.xxv-p5.1"></a>God</span> for that, when certain accusers held back, He brought the truth to his knowledge, lest the originator of such great crimes should escape detection.  But seeing that, in the sentence wherein it is evident that the above-named Anastasius has been justly condemned and deposed, our above-named brother and fellow-bishop has visited the offence of certain persons in such a manner as to reserve them for our judgment, we therefore have seen fit to signify by this present epistle what is to be held to and observed concerning them.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.xxv-p6"></a>As to Paul the deacon then, the bearer of these presents, although his fault is exceedingly to his shame and discredit—namely, that deluded by promises, he held back from accusation of his late bishop who has been lately deposed, and that, in the eagerness of cupidity, he consented, against his own soul, to keep silence rather than declare the truth—yet, since it befits us to be more kind than strict, we pardon him this fault, and decide that he is to be received again into his rank and position.  For we believe that the affliction which he has endured since the time of the sentence being pronounced may suffice for the punishment of this fault.  But as to Euphemius and Thomas, who received sacred orders for relinquishing their accusation, it is our will that they be deprived of these sacred orders, and, having been deposed from them, so continue; and we decree that they shall never, under any pretext or excuse, be restored to sacred orders.  For it is in the highest degree improper, and contrary to the rule of ecclesiastical discipline, that they should enjoy the dignity which they have received, not for their merits, but as the reward of wickedness.  Yet, inasmuch as it is fit for us to incline to mercy more than to strict justice, it is our will that the same Euphemius and Thomas be restored to the rank and position, but to that only, from which they had been promoted to sacred orders, and receive during all the days of their life the stipends of these positions, as they had been before accustomed.  Further, as to Clematius the reader, I appoint, from a like motive of benignity, that he is to be restored   <a name="page_182b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 182b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.v.xxv-Page_182b"></a>to his rank and position.  To all these also, that is, to Paul the deacon, to Euphemius, Thomas, and Clematius, let your Fraternity take care to supply their emoluments, according to the rank and position in which each of them is, as each has been accustomed to receive them, from this present thirteenth indiction without any diminution.  Inasmuch, therefore, as the above-named Paul the deacon asserts that he expended much for the advantage of your Church, and desires to be aided by the succour of your Fraternity for recovery of the same, we exhort that, if this is so, you should concur with him in all possible ways, and support him with your aid, for recovering what he has given, since no reason allows that he should unjustly suffer loss in what he has expended for the advantage of the generality.  Furthermore, let your Fraternity restore without delay the three pounds of gold which, at the instance of our above-named brother and fellow-bishop Secundinus, it appears that the said Paul the deacon gave for the benefit of your Church, lest (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.xxv-p6.1"></a>God</span> forbid) you should seem to burden him, not reasonably, but out of mere caprice.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.v.xxv-p5"></a> Anastasius, bishop of the Metropolitan See of Corinth, had been deposed for some serious crime, the nature of which is not mentioned, Secundinus, bishop of some other see, having apparently been commissioned by Gregory to investigate the charges against him.  John, to whom this letter is addressed had now succeeded him.  See also Epp. LVII., LVIII.</p>
