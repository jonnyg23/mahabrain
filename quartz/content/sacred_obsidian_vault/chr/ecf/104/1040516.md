 <p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.xxix-p2"></a>67.  <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xxix-p2.1"></a>Augustin</span> answered:  What if your private person, whom you deem a forger, were to set forth to any one the law of the emperor?  Would not the man, when he had compared it with the law of those who have the genuine law, and found it to be identically the same, lay aside all care about the source from which he had obtained it, and consider only what he had obtained?  For what the forger gives is false when he gives it of his own   falseness; but when something true is given by any person, even though he be a forger, yet, although the giver be not truthful, the gift is notwithstanding true.</p>
