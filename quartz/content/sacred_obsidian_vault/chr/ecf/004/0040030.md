 <p>  </p><h2 align="CENTER"><a></a> 5. Five Books in Reply to Marcion.</h2>  
 <p>(Author Uncertain.)</p>    <ul>
 <p><a></a> Book I.-Of the Divine Unity, and the Resurrection of the Flesh.</p>    
 <p><a></a> Part I.-Of the Divine Unity.</p>      <ul>
 <p>After the Evil One's impiety</p>      
 <p>Profound, and his life-grudging mind, entrapped</p>      
 <p>Seduced men with empty hope, it laid</p>      
 <p>Them bare, by impious suasion to false trust</p>      
 <p>5 In him,-not with impunity, indeed;</p>      
 <p>For he forthwith, as guilty of the deed,</p>      
 <p>And author rash of such a wickedness,</p>      
 <p>Received deserved maledictions. Thus,</p>      
 <p>Thereafter, maddened, he, most desperate foe,</p>      
 <p>10 Did more assail and instigate men's minds</p>      
 <p>In darkness sunk. He taught them to forget</p>      
 <p>The Lord, and leave sure hope, and idols vain</p>      
 <p>Follow, and shape themselves a crowd of gods,</p>      
 <p>Lots, auguries, false names of stars, the show Is</p>      
 <p>15 Of being able to o'errule the births</p>      
 <p>Of embryos by inspecting entrails, and</p>      
 <p>Expecting things to come, by hardihood</p>      
 <p>Of dreadful magic's renegadoes led,</p>      
 <p>Wondering at a mass of feigned lore;</p>      
 <p>20 And he impelled them headlong to spurn life,</p>      
 <p>Sunk in a criminal insanity;</p>      
 <p>To joy in blood; to threaten murders fell;</p>      
 <p>To love the wound, then, in their neighbour's flesh;</p>      
 <p>Or, burning, and by pleasure's heat entrapped,</p>      
 <p>25 To transgress nature's covenants, and stain</p>      
 <p>Pure bodies, manly sex, with an embrace</p>      
 <p>Unnameable, and uses feminine</p>      
 <p>Mingled in common contact lawlessly;</p>      
 <p>Urging embraces chaste, and dedicate</p>      
 <p>30 To generative duties, to be held</p>      
 <p>For intercourse obscene for passion's sake.</p>      
 <p>Such in time past his deeds, assaulting men,</p>      
 <p>Through the soul's lurking-places, with a flow</p>      
 <p>Of scorpion-venom,-not that men would blame</p>      
 <p>35 Him, for they followed of their own accord:</p>      
 <p>His suasion was in guile; in freedom man</p>      
 <p>Performed it.</p>      
 <p>Whileas the perfidious one</p>      
 <p>Continuously through the centuries<sup><a href="footnote/fn33.htm">1</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Is breathing such ill fumes, and into hearts</p>      
 <p>40 Seduced injecting his own counselling</p>      
 <p>And hoping in his folly (alas!) to find</p>      
 <p>Forgiveness of his wickedness, unware</p>      
 <p>What sentence on his deed is waiting him;</p>      
 <p>With words of wisdom's weaving,<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm">2</a></sup> and a voice</p>      
 <p>45 Presaging from God's Spirit, speak a host</p>      
 <p>Of prophets. Publicly he<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3403_685617">3</a></sup> does not dare</p>      
 <p>Nakedly to speak evil of the Lord,</p>      
 <p>Hoping by secret ingenuity</p>      
 <p>He possibly may lurk unseen. At length</p>      
 <p>50 The soul's Light<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3408_685771">4</a></sup> as the thrall of flesh is held;</p>      
 <p>The hope of the despairing, mightier</p>      
 <p>Than foe, enters the lists; the Fashioner,</p>      
 <p>The Renovator, of the body He;</p>      
 <p>True Glory of the Father; Son of God;</p>      
 <p>55 Author unique; a Judge and Lord He came,</p>      
 <p>The orb's renowned King; to the oppress</p>      
 <p>Prompt to give pardon, and to loose the bound;</p>      
 <p>Whose friendly aid and penal suffering</p>      
 <p>Blend God and renewed man in one. With child</p>      
 <p>60 Is holy virgin: life's new gate opes; words</p>      
 <p>Of prophets find their proof, fulfilled by facts;</p>      
 <p>Priests<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3421_686285">5</a></sup> leave their temples, and-a star their guide-</p>      
 <p>Wonder the Lord so mean a birth should choose.</p>      
 <p>Waters-sight memorable!-turn to wine;</p>      
 <p>65 Eyes are restored to blind; fiends trembling cry,</p>      
 <p>Outdriven by His bidding, and own Christ!</p>      
 <p>All limbs, already rotting, by a word</p>      
 <p>Are healed; now walks the lame; the deaf forthwith</p>      
 <p>Hears hope; the maimed extends his hand; the dumb</p>      
 <p>70 Speaks mighty words: sea at His bidding calms,</p>      
 <p>Winds drop; and all things recognise the Lord:</p>      
 <p>Confounded is the foe, and yields, though fierce,</p>      
 <p>Now triumphed over, to unequal<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3433_686835">6</a></sup> arms!</p>      
 <p>When all his enterprises now revoked</p>      
 <p>75 He<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3436_687030">7</a></sup> sees; the flesh, once into ruin sunk, </p>      
 <p>Now rising; man-death vanquisht quite-to heavens</p>      
 <p>Soaring; the peoples sealed with holy pledge</p>      
 <p>Outpoured;<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3440_687192">8</a></sup> the work and envied deeds of might</p>      
 <p>Marvellous;<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3442_687480">9</a></sup> and hears, too, of penalties</p>      
 <p>80 Extreme, and of perpetual dark, prepared</p>      
 <p>For himself by the Lord by God's decree</p>      
 <p>Irrevocable; naked and unarmed,</p>      
 <p>Damned, vanquisht, doomed to perish in a death</p>      
 <p>Perennial, guilty now, and sure that he</p>      
 <p>85 No pardon has, a last impiety</p>      
 <p>Forthwith he dares,-to scatter everywhere</p>      
 <p>A word for ears to shudder at, nor meet</p>      
 <p>For voice to speak. Accosting men cast off</p>      
 <p>From God's community,<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3453_688172">10</a></sup> men wandering</p>      
 <p>90 Without the light, found mindless, following</p>      
 <p>Things earthly, them he teaches to become</p>      
 <p>Depraved teachers of depravity.</p>      
 <p>By<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3458_688504">11</a></sup> them he preaches that there are two Sires,</p>      
 <p>And realms divided: ill's cause is the Lord<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3460_688952">12</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>95 Who built the orb, fashioned breath-quickened flesh,</p>      
 <p>And gave the law, and by the seers' voice spake.</p>      
 <p>Him he affirms not <i>good</i>, but owns Him <i>just</i>;</p>      
 <p>Hard, cruel, taking pleasure fell in war;</p>      
 <p>In judgment dreadful, pliant to no prayers.</p>      
 <p>100 His suasion tells of other one, to none</p>      
 <p>E'er known, who nowhere is, a deity</p>      
 <p>False, nameless, constituting nought, and who</p>      
 <p>Hath spoken precepts none. Him he calls <i>good</i>;</p>      
 <p>Who judges none, but spares all equally,</p>      
 <p>105 And grudges life to none. No judgment waits</p>      
 <p>The guilty; so he says, bearing about</p>      
 <p>A gory poison with sweet honey mixt</p>      
 <p>For wretched men. That flesh can rise-to which</p>      
 <p>Himself was cause of ruin, which he spoiled</p>      
 <p>110 Iniquitously with contempt (whence,<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3477_689763">13</a></sup> cursed,</p>      
 <p>He hath grief without end), its ever-foe,-</p>      
 <p>He doth deny; because with various wound</p>      
 <p>Life to expel and the salvation whence</p>      
 <p>He fell he strives: and therefore says that Christ</p>      
 <p>115 Came suddenly to earth,<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3483_689997">14</a></sup> but was not made,</p>      
 <p>By any compact, partner of the flesh;</p>      
 <p>But Spirit-form, and body feigned beneath</p>      
 <p>A shape imaginary, seeks to mock</p>      
 <p>Men with a semblance that what is not is.</p>      
 <p>120 Does this, then, become God, to sport with men</p>      
 <p>By darkness led? to act an impious lie?</p>      
 <p>Or falsely call Himself a man? He walks,</p>      
 <p>Is carried, clothed, takes due rest, handled is,</p>      
 <p>Suffers, is hung and buried: man's are all</p>      
 <p>125 Deeds which, in holy body conversant,</p>      
 <p>But sent by God the Father, who hath all</p>      
 <p>Created, He did perfect properly,</p>      
 <p>Reclaiming not another's but His own;</p>      
 <p>Discernible to peoples who of old</p>      
 <p>130 Were hoping for Him by His very work,</p>      
 <p>And through the prophets' voice to the round world<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm">15</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Best known: and now they seek an unknown Lord,</p>      
 <p>Wandering in death's threshold manifest,</p>      
 <p>And leave behind the known. False is their faith,</p>      
 <p>135 False is their God, deceptive their reward,</p>      
 <p>False is their resurrection, death's defeat</p>      
 <p>False, vain their martyrdoms, and e'en Christ's name</p>      
 <p>An empty sound: whom, teaching that He came</p>      
 <p>Like magic mist, they (quite demented) own</p>      
 <p>140 To be the actor of a lie, and make</p>      
 <p>His passion bootless, and the populace<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3511_691373">16</a></sup> </p>      
 <p> (A feigned one!) without crime! Is God <i>thus</i> true?</p>      
 <p>Are <i>such</i> the honours rendered to the Lord?</p>      
 <p>Ah! wretched men! gratuitously lost</p>      
 <p>145 In death ungrateful! Who, by blind guide led,</p>      
 <p>Have headlong rushed into the ditch!<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3517_691610">17</a></sup> and as</p>      
 <p>In dreams the fancied rich man in his store</p>      
 <p>Of treasure doth exult, and with his hands</p>      
 <p>Grasps it, the sport of empty hope, so ye, so</p>      
 <p>150 Deceived, are hoping for a shadow vain</p>      
 <p>Of guerdon!</p>      
 <p>Ah! ye silent laughingstocks,</p>      
 <p>Or doomed prey, of the dragon, do ye hope, </p>      
 <p>Stern men for death in room of gentle peace?<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3526_692035">18</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Dare ye blame God, who hath works</p>      
 <p>155 So great? in whose earth, 'mid profuse displays</p>      
 <p>Of His exceeding parent-care, His gifts</p>      
 <p> (Unmindful of Himself!) ye largely praise,</p>      
 <p>Rushing to ruin! do ye reprobate-</p>      
 <p>Approving of the works-the Maker's self,</p>      
 <p>160 The world's<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3534_692630">19</a></sup> Artificer, whose work withal</p>      
 <p>Ye are yourselves? Who gave those little selves</p>      
 <p>Great honours; sowed your crops; made all the brutes<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3537_692770">20</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Your subjects; makes the seasons of the year</p>      
 <p>Fruitful with stated months; grants sweetnesses,</p>      
 <p>165 Drinks various, rich odours, jocund flowers,</p>      
 <p>And the groves' grateful bowers; to growing herbs</p>      
 <p>Grants wondrous juices; founts and streams dispreads</p>      
 <p>With sweet waves, and illumes with stars the sky</p>      
 <p>And the whole orb: the infinite sole Lord,</p>      
 <p>170 Both Just and Good; known by His work; to none</p>      
 <p>By aspect known; whom nations, flourishing</p>      
 <p>In wealth, but foolish, wrapped in error's shroud,</p>      
 <p> (Albeit 'tis beneath an alien name</p>      
 <p>They praise Him, yet) their Maker knowing! dread</p>      
 <p>175 To blame: nor e'en one<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3551_693368">21</a></sup> -save you, hell's new gate!-</p>      
 <p>Thankless, ye choose to speak ill of your Lord!</p>      
 <p>These cruel deadly gifts the Renegade</p>      
 <p>Terrible has bestowed, through Marcion-thanks</p>      
 <p>To Cerdo's mastership-on you; nor come'</p>      
 <p>180 The thought into your mind that, from Christ's name</p>      
 <p>Seduced, Marcion's name has carried you</p>      
 <p>To lowest depths.<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3559_693818">22</a></sup>   Say of His many acts</p>      
 <p>What one displeases you? or what hath God</p>      
 <p>Done which is not to be extolled with praise?</p>      
 <p>185 Is it that He permits you, all too long,</p>      
 <p> (Unworthy of His patience large,) to see</p>      
 <p>Sweet light? you, who read truths,<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3565_694748">23</a></sup> and, docking them,</p>      
 <p>Teach these your falsehoods, and approve as past</p>      
 <p>Things which are yet to be?<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3568_694900">24</a></sup> What hinders, else,</p>      
 <p>190 That <i>we</i> believe <i>your</i> God incredible?<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3570_695023">25</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Nor marvel is't if, practiced as he<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3572_695793">26</a></sup> is,</p>      
 <p>He captived you unarmed, persuading you</p>      
 <p>There are two Fathers (being damned by One),</p>      
 <p>And all, whom he had erst seduced, are gods;</p>      
 <p>195 And after that dispread a pest, which ran</p>      
 <p>With multiplying wound, and cureless crime,</p>      
 <p>To many. Men unworthy to be named,</p>      
 <p>Full of all magic's madness, he induced</p>      
 <p>To call themselves "Virtue Supreme; "and feign</p>      
 <p>200 (With harlot comrade) fresh impiety;</p>      
 <p>To roam, to fly.<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3583_696223">27</a></sup> He is the insane god</p>      
 <p>Of Valentine, and to his Aeonage</p>      
 <p>Assigned heavens thirty, and Profundity</p>      
 <p>Their sire.<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3587_696708">28</a></sup>   He taught two baptisms, and led</p>      
 <p>205 The body through the flame. That there are gods</p>      
 <p>So many as the year hath days, he bade</p>      
 <p>A Basilides to believe, and worlds</p>      
 <p>As many. Marcus, shrewdly arguing</p>      
 <p>Through numbers, taught to violate chaste form</p>      
 <p>210 'Mid magic's arts; taught, too, that the Lord's cup</p>      
 <p>Is an oblation, and by prayers is turned</p>      
 <p>To blood. His<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3596_697254">29</a></sup> suasion prompted Hebion</p>      
 <p>To teach that Christ was born from human seed; </p>      
 <p>He taught, too, circumcision, and that room</p>      
 <p>215 Is still left for the Law, and, though Law's founts</p>      
 <p>Are lost,<sup><a href="footnote/fn36.htm">30</a></sup> its elements must be resumed.</p>      
 <p>Unwilling am I to protract in words</p>      
 <p>His last atrocity, or to tell all</p>      
 <p>The causes, or the names at length. Enough</p>      
 <p>220 It is to note his many cruelties</p>      
 <p>Briefly, and the unmentionable men,</p>      
 <p>The dragon's organs fell, through whom he now,</p>      
 <p>Speaking so much profaneness, ever toils</p>      
 <p>To blame the Maker of the world.<sup><a href="footnote/fn36.htm#P3610_697852">31</a></sup> But come;</p>      
 <p>225 Recall your foot from savage Bandit's cave,</p>      
 <p>While space is granted, and to wretched men</p>      
 <p>God, patient in perennial parent-love,</p>      
 <p>Condones all deeds through error done! Believe</p>      
 <p>Truly in the true Sire, who built the orb;</p>      
 <p>230 Who, on behalf of men incapable</p>      
 <p>To bear the law, sunk in sin's whirlpool, sent</p>      
 <p>The true Lord to repair the ruin wrought,</p>      
 <p>And bring them the salvation promised</p>      
 <p>Of old through seers. He who the mandates gave</p>      
 <p>235 Remits sins too. Somewhat, deservedly,</p>      
 <p>Doth He exact, because He formerly</p>      
 <p>Entrusted somewhat; or else bounteously,</p>      
 <p>As Lord, condones as it were debts to slaves:</p>      
 <p>Finally, peoples shut up 'neath the curse,</p>

 <p>Abstains from sin, or truly suffers wounds</p>

 <p>And wrestling in the course, combinedly</p>

 <p>255 Of wages-deals, both good and just, whom we</p>      
 <p>Believe Almighty: to the thankless kind</p>

 <p>So are we bidden to believe, and not</p>      
 <p>Be willing to cast blame unlawfully</p>      
 <p>On the Lord in our teaching, as if He</p>      
 <p>265 Were one to raise the <i>soul</i>, as having met</p>      
 <p>With ruin, and to set her free from death</p>      
 <p>So that the granted faculty of life</p>      
 <p>Upon the ground of sole desert (because</p>      
 <p>She bravely acted), should abide with her;<sup><a href="footnote/fn36.htm#P3662_700011">36</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>270 While she who ever shared the common lot</p>      
 <p>Of toil, the <i>flesh</i>, should to the earth be left,</p>      
 <p>The prey of a perennial death. Has, then,</p>      
 <p>The <i>soul</i> pleased God by acts of fortitude?</p>      
 <p>By no means could she Him have pleased alone</p>      
 <p>275 Without the <i>flesh</i>. Hath she borne penal bonds?<sup><a href="footnote/fn36.htm#P3669_700401">37</a></sup> </p>

 <p>These were the causes which Paul had to write</p>

 <p>For blood-to God. From whose piacular death,</p>      
 <p>That to the wasted race<sup><a href="footnote/fn38.htm#P3842_711253">68</a></sup> it might be sign</p>

 <p>Forsooth, an image of Christ's virtue was:<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4314_736552">150</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>To teach that death's fierce battles should not be</p>

 <p>Above all fame, appears; who, having braced</p>      
 <p>Herself for warlike toil, for country's sake,</p>

 <p>The pledge<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4339_737707">153</a></sup> dear to his heart; who suddenly</p>      
 <p>Fell by a lot unhoped by any. He,</p>      
 <p>To keep his promise, broke the sacred laws</p>      
 <p>150 Of parenthood: the shade of mighty fear</p>

 <p>Of sin: as solace of his widowed life</p>      
 <p>For<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4346_737954">154</a></sup> wickedness, renown, and, for crime, praise,</p>

 <p>255 The heavenly words fly through the orb: with these</p>      
 <p>Christ's blood is likewise held context, so told</p>      
 <p>Obscurely by the seers' presaging mouth.</p>      
 <p>The <i>number</i> of the wings doth set a seal</p>

 <p>260 Those <i>twenty-four</i> have certainly enough</p>      
 <p>Which sang the Lord's ways and the times of peace:</p>      
 <p>These all, we see, with the new covenant</p>      
 <p>Cohere. Thus also John; the Spirit thus</p>      
 <p>To him reveals that in that number stand</p>      
 <p>265 The enthroned elders white<sup><a href="footnote/fn49.htm#P4997_772961">276</a></sup> and crowned, who (as</p>

 <p>The Lord's throne, and upon the glassy sea</p>      
 <p>Subigneous: and four living creatures, winged</p>      
 <p>And full of eyes within and outwardly,</p>      
 <p>270 Do signify that hidden things are oped,</p>      
 <p>And all things shut are at the same time seen,</p>      
 <p>In the word's eye. The glassy flame-mixt sea</p>      
 <p>Means that the laver's gifts, with Spirit fused</p>      
 <p>Therein, upon believers are conferred.</p>      
 <p>275 Who could e'en tell what the Lord's parentcare</p>      
 <p>Before His judgment-seat, before His bar,</p>

 <p>Thus all parts of the covenant old and new,</p>      
 <p>Those sacred rights and pregnant utterances</p>

 <p>Their sayings, who to false ways have declined;</p>      
 <p>And from the Lord and God, eternal King,</p>      
 <p>290 Who such an orb produced, detract, and seek</p>      
 <p>Some other deity 'neath feigned name,</p>

 <p>The <i>first</i> Book did the enemy's words recall In</p>      
 <p>order, which the senseless renegade</p>      
 <p>Composed and put forth lawlessly; hence, too,</p>      
 <p>Touched briefly flesh's hope, Christ's victory,</p>

 <p>The Law's conjoined mysteries, and what</p>      
 <p>In the new covenant the one God hath</p>      
 <p>Delivered. The <i>third</i> shows the race, create</p>

 <p>Of our own elders noted, (times preserved</p>

 <p>15 The author<sup><a href="footnote/fn50.htm#P5066_776558">285</a></sup> of this wickedness, unknown,</p>

 <p>The <i>fourth</i>, too, the piacular rites recalls</p>

 <p>In which the Victim True appeared, by saints</p>      
 <p>20 Expected long since, with the holy Seed.</p>      
 <p>This <i>fifth</i> doth many twists and knots untie,</p>

 <p>Without attesting prophet.</p>      
 <p>And although</p>      
 <p>25 With strong arms fortified we vanquish foes,</p>

 <p>All things polluted, impious, unallowed,</p>      
 <p>Commaculate, -the blind's path without light!</p>

 <p> (Although with double risk<sup><a href="footnote/fn50.htm#P5094_777665">288</a></sup> ) to ope our words.</p>      
 <p>40 Who, then, the God whom ye say is the true,</p>

 <p>To pity and to succour all combined,</p>      
 <p>And to re-elevate men vanquisht quite</p>

 <p>Is held in check; why, then, so late appear</p>      
 <p>His ever-kindness, duteous vigilance?</p>      
 <p>55 How comes it that he ne at all before</p>      
 <p>Offered himself to any, but let slip</p>      
 <p>Poor souls in numbers?<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5115_778585">291</a></sup> and then with his mouth</p>

 <p>The Shepherd ought<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5120_778832">292</a></sup> to have disrobed himself</p>      
 <p>Of flesh, as if his victor-self withal</p>      
 <p>Had ever been a spirit, and as such<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5123_778972">293</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Willed to rescue all expelled souls, </p>      
 <p>65 Without a body, everywhere, and leave</p>

 <p>The world<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5128_779141">294</a></sup> on one day equally with corpses</p>      
 <p>To leave the orb void; and to raise the souls</p>      
 <p>To heaven. Then would human progeny</p>      
 <p>70 At once have ceased to be born; nor had</p>

 <p>But say, whose suasion hash, with fraud astute,</p>      
 <p>Made you "abide," and in divided love</p>      
 <p>105 Of offspring live secure, and commit crime</p>

 <p>Paved in the waves a path, and freely gave</p>

 <p>What<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5259_785892">315</a></sup> hath the Living Power done</p>      
 <p>To make men recosnise what God can give</p>      
 <p>And maul can suffer, and thus live?<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5262_786031">316</a></sup> But since</p>      
 <p>Neither predictions earlier nor facts</p>      
 <p>180 The latest can suede senseless frantic<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5265_786284">317</a></sup> men</p>      
 <p>That God became a man, and (after He</p>      
 <p>Had suffered and been buried) rose; that they</p>      
 <p>May credit those so many witnesses</p>      
 <p>Harmonious,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5270_786490">318</a></sup> who of old did cry aloud</p>      
 <p>185 With heavenly word, let them both<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5272_786590">319</a></sup> learn to trust</p>      
 <p>At least terrestrial reason.</p>      
 <p>When the Lord</p>      
 <p>Christ came to be, as flesh, born into the orb</p>      
 <p>In time of king Augustus' reign at Rome,</p>      
 <p>First, by decree, the nations numbered are</p>      
 <p>190 By census everywhere: this measure, then,</p>      
 <p>This same king chanced to pass, because the Will</p>      
 <p>Supreme, in whose high reigning hand doth lie</p>      
 <p>The king's heart, had impelled him:<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5282_787530">320</a></sup>   he was first</p>      
 <p>To do it, and the enrolment was reduced</p>      
 <p>195 To orderly arrangement. Joseph then</p>      
 <p>Likewise, with his but just delivered wife</p>      
 <p>Mary,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5287_788009">321</a></sup> with her celestial Son alike,</p>      
 <p>Themselves withal are numbered. Let, then, such</p>      
 <p>As trust to instruments of human skill,</p>      
 <p>200 Who may (approving of applying them</p>      
 <p>As attestators of the holy word)</p>      
 <p>Inquire into this census, if it be</p>      
 <p>But found so as we say, then afterwards</p>      
 <p>Repent they and seek pardon while time still</p>      
 <p>205 Is had<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5296_788468">322</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>The Jews, who own<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5298_788642">323</a></sup> to having wrought</p>      
 <p>A grave crime, while in our disparagement</p>      
 <p>They glow, and do resist us, neither call</p>      
 <p>Christ's family unknown, nor can<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm">324</a></sup> affirm</p>      
 <p>They hanged a man, who spake truth, on a tree:<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5304_788955">325</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>210 Ignorant that the Lord's flesh which they bound<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5306_789240">326</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Was not seed-gendered. But, while partially</p>      
 <p>They keep a reticence, so partially</p>      
 <p>They triumph; for they strive to represent</p>      
 <p>God to the peoples commonly as man.</p>      
 <p>215 Behold the error which o'ercomes you both!<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5312_789485">327</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>This error will our cause assist, the while,</p>      
 <p>We prove to you those things which certain are.</p>      
 <p>They do deny Him God; you falsely call</p>      
 <p>Him man, a body bodiless! and ah!</p>      
 <p>220 A various insanity of mind</p>      
 <p>Sinks you; which him who hath presumed to hint</p>      
 <p>You both do, sinking, sprinkle:<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5320_789804">328</a></sup> for His deeds</p>      
 <p>Will then approve Him man alike and God</p>      
 <p>Commingled, and the world<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5323_790251">329</a></sup> will furnish signs</p>      
 <p>225 No few.</p>      
 <p>While then the Son Himself of God</p>      
 <p>Is seeking to regain the flesh's limbs,<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5327_790368">330</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Already robed as King, He doth sustain</p>      
 <p>Blows from rude palms; with spitting covered is</p>      
 <p>His face; a thorn-inwoven crown His head</p>      
 <p>230 Pierces all round; and to the tree<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5332_790671">331</a></sup> Himself</p>      
 <p>Is fixed; wine drugged with myrrh,<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5334_790727">332</a></sup> is drunk, and gall<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5335_790782">333</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Is mixt with vinegar; parted His robe,<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5337_790991">334</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>And in it<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5339_791050">335</a></sup> lots are cast; what for himself</p>      
 <p>Each one hath seized he keeps; in murky gloom,</p>      
 <p>235 As God from fleshly body silently</p>      
 <p>Outbreathes His soul, in darkness trembling day</p>      
 <p>Took refuge with the sun; twice dawned one day;</p>      
 <p>Its centre black night covered: from their base</p>      
 <p>Mounts move in circle, wholly moved was earth,</p>      
 <p>240 Saints'sepulchres stood ope, and all things Joined</p>      
 <p>In fear to see His passion whom they knew!</p>      
 <p>His lifeless side a soldier with bare spear</p>      
 <p>Pierces, and forth flows blood, nor water less</p>      
 <p>Thence followed. These facts they<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5351_791649">336</a></sup> agree to hide,</p>      
 <p>245 And are unwilling the misdeed to own,</p>      
 <p>Willing to blink the crime.</p>      
 <p>Can spirit, then,</p>      
 <p>Without a body wear a robe? or is't</p>      
 <p>Susceptible of penalty? the wound</p>      
 <p>Of violence does it bear? or die? or rise?</p>      
 <p>250 Is blood thence poured? from what flesh. since ye say</p>      
 <p>He had none? or else, rather, feigned He? if</p>      
 <p>'Tis safe for you to say so; though you do</p>      
 <p> (Headlong) so say, by passing over more</p>      
 <p>In silence. Is not, then, faith manifest?</p>      
 <p>255 And are not all things fixed? The day before</p>      
 <p>He then<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5365_792155">337</a></sup> should suffer, keeping Passover,</p>      
 <p>And handing down a memorable rite<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5367_792286">338</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>To His disciples, taking bread alike</p>      
 <p>And the vine's juice, "My body, and My blood</p>      
 <p>260 Which is poured<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5371_792416">339</a></sup> for you, this is," did He say;</p>      
 <p>And bade it ever afterward be done.</p>      
 <p>Of what created elements were made,</p>      
 <p>Think ye, the bread and wine which were (He said)</p>      
 <p>His body with its blood? and what must be</p>      
 <p>265 Confessed? Proved He not Himself the world's<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5377_792698">340</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Maker, through deeds? and that He bore at once</p>      
 <p>A body formed from flesh and blood?</p>      
 <p>This God</p>      
 <p>This true Man, too, the Father's Virtue 'neath</p>      
 <p>An Image,<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5383_792857">341</a></sup> with the Father ever was,</p>      
 <p>270 United both in glory and in age;<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5385_793106">342</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Because alone He ministers the words</p>      
 <p>Of the All-Holder; whom He<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5388_793209">343</a></sup> upon earth</p>      
 <p>Accepts;<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5390_793259">344</a></sup> through whom He all things did create:</p>      
 <p>God's Son, God's dearest Minister, is He!</p>      
 <p>275 Hence hath He generation, hence Name too,</p>      
 <p>Hence, finally, a kingdom; Lord from Lord;</p>      
 <p>Stream from perennial Fount! He, He it was </p>      
 <p>Who to the holy fathers (whosoe'er</p>      
 <p>Among them doth profess to have "seen God"<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5397_793560">345</a></sup> )-</p>      
 <p>200 God is our witness-since the origin</p>      
 <p>Of this our world,<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5400_793697">346</a></sup> appearing, opened up</p>      
 <p>The Father's words of promise and of charge</p>      
 <p>From heaven high: He led the People out;</p>      
 <p>Smote through th'iniquitous nation; was Himself</p>      
 <p>285 The column both of light and of cloud's shade;</p>      
 <p>And dried the sea; and bids the People go</p>      
 <p>Right through the waves, the foe therein involved</p>      
 <p>And covered with the flood and surge: a way</p>      
 <p>Through deserts made He for the followers</p>      
 <p>290 Of His high biddings; sent down bread in showers<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5410_794138">347</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>From heaven for the People; brake the rock;</p>      
 <p>Bedewed with wave the thirsty;<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5413_794432">348</a></sup> and from God</p>      
 <p>The mandate of the Law to Moses spake</p>      
 <p>With thunder, trumpet-sound, and flamey column</p>      
 <p>295 Terrible to the sight, while men's hearts shook.</p>      
 <p>After twice twenty years, with months complete,</p>      
 <p>Jordan was parted; a way oped; the wave</p>      
 <p>Stood in a mass; and the tribes shared the land,</p>      
 <p>Their fathers' promised boons! The Father's word,</p>      
 <p>300 Speaking Himself by prophets' mouth, that He<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5422_794876">349</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Would come to earth and be a man, He did</p>      
 <p>Predict; Christ manifestly to the earth</p>      
 <p>Foretelling.</p>      
 <p>Then, expected for our aid,</p>      
 <p>Life's only Hope, the Cleanser of our flesh,<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5428_795108">350</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>305 Death's Router, from th' Almighty Sire's empire</p>      
 <p>At length He came, and with our human limbs</p>      
 <p>He clothed Him. Adam-virgin-dragon-tree,<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5432_795439">351</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>The cause of ruin, and the way whereby</p>      
 <p>Rash death us all had vanquisht! by the same</p>      
 <p>310 Our Shepherd treading, seeking to regain</p>      
 <p>His sheep-with angel-virgin-His own flesh-</p>      
 <p>And the "tree's" remedy;<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5438_795647">352</a></sup> whence vanquisht man</p>      
 <p>And doomed to perish was aye wont to go</p>      
 <p>To meet his vanquisht peers; hence, inter-posed,</p>      
 <p>315 One in all captives' room, He did sustain</p>      
 <p>In body the unfriendly penalty</p>      
 <p>With patience; by His own death spoiling death;</p>      
 <p>Becomes salvation's cause; and, having paid</p>      
 <p>Throughly our debts by throughly suffering</p>      
 <p>320 On earth, in holy body, everything,</p>      
 <p>Seeks the infern! here souls, bound for their crime,</p>      
 <p>Which shut up all together by Law's weight,</p>      
 <p>Without a guard,<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5450_796197">353</a></sup> were asking for the boons</p>      
 <p>Promised of old, hoped for, and tardy, He</p>      
 <p>325 To the saints'rest admitted, and, with light,</p>      
 <p>Brought back. For on the third day mounting up,<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5454_796420">354</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>A victor, with His body by His Sire's</p>      
 <p>Virtue immense, (salvation's pathway made,)</p>      
 <p>And bearing God and man is form create,</p>      
 <p>330 He clomb the heavens, leading back with Him</p>      
 <p>Captivity's first-fruits (a welcome gift</p>      
 <p>And a dear figure<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5461_796733">355</a></sup> to the Lord), and took</p>      
 <p>His seat beside light's Father, and resumed</p>      
 <p>The virtue and the glory of which, while</p>      
 <p>335 He was engaged in vanquishing the foe</p>      
 <p>He had been stripped;<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5467_796946">356</a></sup> conjoined with Spirit; bound</p>      
 <p>With flesh, on our part. Him, Lord, Christ, King, God,</p>      
 <p>Judgment and kingdom given to His hand,</p>      
 <p>The father is to send unto the orb.</p>      </ul></ul>
