 <p class="c19"><a name="iv.vi.xi-p2"></a>To begin with the real ground of the military crown, I think we must first inquire whether warfare is proper at all for Christians. What sense is there in discussing the merely accidental, when that on which it rests is to be condemned? Do we believe it lawful for a human oath <a name="fr_416"></a><a href="#fn_416"><font size="1">417</font></a>
  to be superadded to one divine, for a man to come under promise to another master after Christ, and to abjure father, mother, and all nearest kinsfolk, whom even the law has commanded us to honour and love next to God Himself, to whom the gospel, too, holding them only of less account than Christ, has in like manner rendered honour? Shall it be held lawful to make an occupation of the sword, when the Lord proclaims that he who uses the sword shall perish by the sword?  And shall the son of peace take part in the battle when it does not become him even to sue at law? And shall he apply the chain, and the prison, and the torture, and the punishment, who is not the avenger even of his own wrongs?  Shall he, forsooth, either keep watch-service for others more than for Christ, or shall he do it on the Lords day, when he does not even do it for Christ Himself? And shall he keep guard <a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 100</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.xi-Page_100"></a>before the temples which he has renounced? And shall he take a meal where the apostle has forbidden him? <a name="fr_417"></a><a href="#fn_417"><font size="1">418</font></a>
  And shall he diligently protect by night those whom in the day-time he has put to flight by his exorcisms, leaning and resting on the spear the while with which Christs side was pierced? Shall he carry a flag, <a name="fr_418"></a><a href="#fn_418"><font size="1">419</font></a>
  too, hostile to Christ? And shall <i>he</i> ask a watchword from the emperor who has already received one from God? Shall <i>he</i> be disturbed in death by the trumpet of the trumpeter, who expects to be aroused by the angels trump? And shall the Christian be burned according to camp rule, when he was not permitted to burn incense to an idol, when to him Christ remitted the punishment of fire?  Then how many other offences there are involved in the performances of camp offices, which we must hold to involve a transgression of Gods law, you may see by a slight survey. The very carrying of the name over from the camp of light to the camp of darkness is a violation of it. Of course, if faith comes later, and finds any preoccupied with military service, their case is different, as in the instance of those whom John used to receive for baptism, and of those most faithful centurions, I mean the centurion whom Christ approves, and the centurion whom Peter instructs; yet, at the same time, when a man has become a believer, and faith has been sealed, there must be either an immediate abandonment of it, which has been the course with many; or all sorts of quibbling will have to be resorted to in order to avoid offending God, and that is not allowed even outside of military service; <a name="fr_419"></a><a href="#fn_419"><font size="1">420</font></a>
  or, last of all, for God the fate must be endured which a citizen-faith has been no less ready to accept. Neither does military service hold out escape from punishment of sins, or exemption from martyrdom. Nowhere does the Christian change his character. There is one gospel, and the same Jesus, who will one day deny every one who denies, and acknowledge every one who acknowledges God,—who will save, too, the life which has been lost for His sake; but, on the other hand, destroy that which for gain has been saved to His dishonour. With Him the faithful citizen is a soldier, just as the faithful soldier is a citizen. <a name="fr_420"></a><a href="#fn_420"><font size="1">421</font></a>
  A state of faith admits no plea of necessity; they are under no necessity to sin, whose one necessity is, that they do not sin. For if one is pressed to the offering of sacrifice and the sheer denial of Christ by the necessity of torture or of punishment, yet discipline does not connive even at that necessity; because there is a higher necessity to dread denying and to undergo martyrdom, than to escape from suffering, and to render the homage required. In fact, an excuse of this sort overturns the entire essence of our sacrament, removing even the obstacle to voluntary sins; for it will be possible also to maintain that inclination is a necessity, as involving in it, forsooth, a sort of compulsion. I have, in fact, disposed of this very allegation of necessity with reference to the pleas by which crowns connected with official position are vindicated, in support of which it is in common use, since for this very reason offices must be either refused, that we may not fall into acts of sin, or martyrdoms endured that we may get quit of offices. Touching this primary aspect of the question, as to the unlawfulness even of a military life itself, I shall not add more, that the secondary question may be restored to its place. Indeed, if, putting my strength to the question, I banish from us the military life, I should now to no purpose issue a challenge on the matter of the military crown. Suppose, then, that the military service is lawful, as far as the plea for the crown is concerned. <a name="fr_421"></a><a href="#fn_421"><font size="1">422</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.vi.xi-p6"></a> “Outside of the military service.” By substituting <i>ex militia</i> for the corresponding words <i>extra militiam</i>, as has been proposed by Rigaltius, the sentence acquires a meaning such that desertion from the army is suggested as one of the methods by which a soldier who has become a Christian may continue faithful to Jesus. But the words <i>extra militiam</i> are a genuine part of the text. There is no good ground, therefore, for the statement of Gibbon:  “Tertullian (<i>de Corona Militis</i>, c. xi.) suggests to them the expedient of deserting; a counsel which, if it had been generally known, was not very proper to conciliate the favour of the emperors toward the Christian sect.”—<span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.xi-p6.2"></a>Tr</span>.</p>
