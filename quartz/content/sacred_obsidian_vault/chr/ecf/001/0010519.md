 <p> <a name="viii.iv.lviii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.lviii-p0.1"></a>Chapter LVIII.—The same is proved from the visions which appeared to Jacob.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.lviii-p1"></a>Then I continued, “I purpose to quote to you Scriptures, not that I am anxious to make merely an artful display of words; for I possess no such faculty, but Gods grace alone has been granted to me to the understanding of His Scriptures, of which grace I exhort all to become partakers freely and bounteously, in order that they may not, through want of it, <a name="fr_2148"></a><a href="#fn_2148"><font size="1">2149</font></a>
  incur condemnation in the judgment which God the Maker of all things shall hold through my Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.lviii-p3"></a>And Trypho said, “What you do is worthy of the worship of God; but you appear to me to feign ignorance when you say that you do not possess a store of artful words.”</p>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.lviii-p4"></a>I again replied, “Be it so, since you think so; yet I am persuaded that I speak the truth. <a name="fr_2149"></a><a href="#fn_2149"><font size="1">2150</font></a>
  But give me your attention, that I may now rather adduce the remaining proofs.”</p>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.lviii-p6"></a>“Proceed,” said he.</p>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.lviii-p7"></a>And I continued: “It is again written by Moses, my brethren, that He who is called God and appeared to the patriarchs is called both Angel and Lord, in order that from this you may understand Him to be minister to the Father of all things, as you have already admitted, and may remain firm, persuaded by additional arguments. <a name="viii.iv.lviii-p7.1"></a>The word of God, therefore, [recorded] by Moses, when referring to Jacob the grandson of Abraham, speaks thus: And it came to pass, when the sheep conceived, that I saw them with my eyes in the dream: And, behold, the he-goats and the rams which leaped upon the sheep and she-goats were spotted  <a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 226</font></a> <a name="viii.iv.lviii-Page_226"></a>  with white, and speckled and sprinkled with a dun colour. And the Angel of God said to me in the dream, Jacob, Jacob. And I said, What is it, Lord? And He said, Lift up thine eyes, and see that the he-goats and rams leaping on the sheep and she-goats are spotted with white, speckled, and sprinkled with a dun colour. For I have seen what Laban doeth unto thee. I am the God who appeared to thee in Bethel, <a name="fr_2150"></a><a href="#fn_2150"><font size="1">2151</font></a>
  where thou anointedst a pillar and vowedst a vow unto Me. Now therefore arise, and get thee out of this land, and depart to the land of thy birth, and I shall be with thee. <a name="fr_2151"></a><a href="#fn_2151"><font size="1">2152</font></a>
  And again, in other words, speaking of the same Jacob, it thus says: And having risen up that night, he took the two wives, and the two women-servants, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford Jabbok; and he took them and went over the brook, and sent over all his belongings. But Jacob was left behind alone, and an Angel <a name="fr_2152"></a><a href="#fn_2152"><font size="1">2153</font></a>
  wrestled with him until morning. And He saw that He is not prevailing against him, and He touched the broad part of his thigh; and the broad part of Jacobs thigh grew stiff while he wrestled with Him. And He said, Let Me go, for the day breaketh. But he said, I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me. And He said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And He said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; for thou hast prevailed with God, and with men shalt be powerful. And Jacob asked Him, and said, Tell me Thy name. But he said, Why dost thou ask after My name? And He blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of that place Peniel, <a name="fr_2153"></a><a href="#fn_2153"><font size="1">2154</font></a>
  for I saw God face to face, and my soul rejoiced. <a name="fr_2154"></a><a href="#fn_2154"><font size="1">2155</font></a>
  And again, in other terms, referring to the same Jacob, it says the following: And Jacob came to Luz, in the land of Canaan, which is Bethel, he and all the people that were with him. And there he built an altar, and called the name of that place Bethel; for there God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother Esau. And Deborah, Rebekahs nurse, died, and was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and Jacob called the name of it The Oak of Sorrow. And God appeared again to Jacob in Luz, when he came out from Mesopotamia in Syria, and He blessed him. And God said to him, Thy name shall be no more called Jacob, but Israel shall he thy name. <a name="fr_2155"></a><a href="#fn_2155"><font size="1">2156</font></a>
  He is called God, and He is and shall be God.” And when all had agreed on these grounds, I continued: “Moreover, I consider it necessary to repeat to you the words which narrate how He who is both Angel and God and Lord, and who appeared as a man to Abraham, and who wrestled in human form with Jacob, was seen by him when he fled from his brother Esau. They are as follows: And Jacob went out from the well of the oath, <a name="fr_2156"></a><a href="#fn_2156"><font size="1">2157</font></a>
  and went toward Charran. <a name="fr_2157"></a><a href="#fn_2157"><font size="1">2158</font></a>
  And he lighted on a spot, and slept there, for the sun was set; and he gathered of the stones of the place, and put them under his head. And he slept in that place; and he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, whose top reached to heaven; and the angels of God ascended and descended upon it. And the Lord stood <a name="fr_2158"></a><a href="#fn_2158"><font size="1">2159</font></a>
  above it, and He said, I am the Lord, the God of Abraham thy father, and of Isaac; be not afraid: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and shall be extended to the west, and south, and north, and east: and in thee, and in thy seed, shall all families of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I am with thee, keeping thee in every way wherein thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done all that I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose up in the morning, and took the stone which he had placed under his head, and he set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it; and Jacob called the name of the place The House of God, and the name of the city formerly was Ulammaus. ” <a name="fr_2159"></a><a href="#fn_2159"><font size="1">2160</font></a>
