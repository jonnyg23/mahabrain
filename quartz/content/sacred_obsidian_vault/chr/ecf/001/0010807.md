 <p> <a name="ix.vi.xiii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ix.vi.xiii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XII.—It clearly appears that there was but one author of both the old and the new law, from the fact that Christ condemned traditions and customs repugnant to the former, while He confirmed its most important precepts, and taught that He was Himself the end of the Mosaic law.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ix.vi.xiii-p1"></a>1. <a name="ix.vi.xiii-p1.1"></a><a name="ix.vi.xiii-p1.2"></a>For the tradition of the elders themselves, which they pretended to observe from the law, was contrary to the law given by Moses. Wherefore also Esaias declares: “Thy dealers mix the wine with water,” <a name="fr_3935"></a><a href="#fn_3935"><font size="1">3936</font></a>
  showing that the elders were in the habit of mingling a watered tradition with the simple command of God; that is, they set up a spurious law, and one contrary to the [true] law; as also the Lord made plain, when He said to them, “Why do ye transgress the commandment of God, for the sake of your tradition?” <a name="fr_3936"></a><a href="#fn_3936"><font size="1">3937</font></a>
  For not only by actual transgression did they set the law of God at nought, mingling the wine with water; but they also set up their own law in opposition to it, which is termed, even to the present day, the pharisaical. In this [law] they suppress certain things, add others, and interpret others, again, as they think proper, which their teachers use, each one in particular; and desiring to uphold these traditions, they were unwilling to be subject to the law of God, which prepares them for the coming of Christ. But they did even blame the Lord for healing on the Sabbath-days, which, as I have already observed, the law did not prohibit. For they did themselves, in one sense, perform acts of healing upon the Sabbath-day, when they circumcised a man [on that day]; but they did not blame themselves for transgressing the command of God through tradition and the aforesaid pharisaical law, and for not keeping the commandment of the law, which is the love of God.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vi.xiii-p4"></a>2. But that this is the first and greatest commandment, and that the next [has respect to love] towards our neighbour, the Lord has taught, when He says that the entire law and the prophets hang upon these two commandments. Moreover, He did not Himself bring down [from heaven] any other commandment greater than this one, but renewed this very same one to His disciples, when He enjoined them to love God with all their heart, and others as themselves. But if He had descended from another Father, He never would have made use of the first and greatest commandment of the law; but He would undoubtedly have endeavoured by all means to bring down a greater one than this from the perfect Father, so as not to make use of that which had been given by the  <a name="page_476"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 476</font></a> <a name="ix.vi.xiii-Page_476"></a>  God of the law. <a name="ix.vi.xiii-p4.1"></a>And Paul in like manner declares, “Love is the fulfilling of the law:” <a name="fr_3937"></a><a href="#fn_3937"><font size="1">3938</font></a>
  and [he declares] that when all other things have been destroyed, there shall remain “faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of all is love;” <a name="fr_3938"></a><a href="#fn_3938"><font size="1">3939</font></a>
  and that apart from the love of God, neither knowledge avails anything, <a name="fr_3939"></a><a href="#fn_3939"><font size="1">3940</font></a>
  nor the understanding of mysteries, nor faith, nor prophecy, but that without love all are hollow and vain; moreover, that love makes man perfect; and that he who loves God is perfect, both in this world and in that which is to come. For we do never cease from loving God; but in proportion as we continue to contemplate Him, so much the more do we love Him.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vi.xiii-p8"></a>3. <a name="ix.vi.xiii-p8.1"></a>As in the law, therefore, and in the Gospel [likewise], the first and greatest commandment is, to love the Lord God with the whole heart, and then there follows a commandment like to it, to love ones neighbour as ones self; the author of the law and the Gospel is shown to be one and the same. For the precepts of an absolutely perfect life, since they are the same in each Testament, have pointed out [to us] the same God, who certainly has promulgated particular laws adapted for each; but the more prominent and the greatest [commandments], without which salvation cannot [be attained], He has exhorted [us to observe] the same in both.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vi.xiii-p9"></a>4. The Lord, too, does not do away with this [God], when He shows that the law was not derived from another God, expressing Himself as follows to those who were being instructed by Him, to the multitude and to His disciples: “The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses seat. All, therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. For they bind heavy burdens, and lay them upon mens shoulders; but they themselves will not so much as move them with a finger.” <a name="fr_3940"></a><a href="#fn_3940"><font size="1">3941</font></a>
  He therefore did not throw blame upon that law which was given by Moses, when He exhorted it to be observed, Jerusalem being as yet in safety; but He <i>did</i> throw blame upon those persons, because they repeated indeed the words of the law, yet were without love. And for this reason were they held as being unrighteous as respects God, and as respects their neighbours. As also Isaiah says: “This people honoureth Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me: howbeit in vain do they worship Me, teaching the doctrines and the commandments of men.” <a name="fr_3941"></a><a href="#fn_3941"><font size="1">3942</font></a>
  He does not call the law given by Moses commandments of men, but the traditions of the elders themselves which they had invented, and in upholding which they made the law of God of none effect, and were on this account also not subject to His Word. <a name="ix.vi.xiii-p11.2"></a>For this is what Paul says concerning these men: “For they, being ignorant of Gods righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.” <a name="fr_3942"></a><a href="#fn_3942"><font size="1">3943</font></a>
  And how is Christ the end of the law, if He be not also the final cause of it? For He who has brought in the end has Himself also wrought the beginning; and it is He who does Himself say to Moses, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have come down to deliver them;” <a name="fr_3943"></a><a href="#fn_3943"><font size="1">3944</font></a>
  it being customary from the beginning with the Word of God to ascend and descend for the purpose of saving those who were in affliction.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vi.xiii-p14"></a>5. Now, that the law did beforehand teach mankind the necessity of following Christ, He does Himself make manifest, when He replied as follows to him who asked Him what he should do that he might inherit eternal life: “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.” <a name="fr_3944"></a><a href="#fn_3944"><font size="1">3945</font></a>
  But upon the other asking “Which?” again the Lord replies: “Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honour father and mother, and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,”—setting as an ascending series (<i>velut gradus</i>) before those who wished to follow Him, the precepts of the law, as the entrance into life; and what He then said to one He said to all. But when the former said, “All these have I done” (and most likely he had not kept them, for in that case the Lord would not have said to him, “Keep the commandments”), the Lord, exposing his covetousness, said to him, “If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor; and come, follow me;” promising to those who would act thus, the portion belonging to the apostles (<i>apostolorum partem</i>). And He did not preach to His followers another God the Father, besides Him who was proclaimed by the law from the beginning; nor another Son; nor the Mother, the enthymesis of the Æon, who existed in suffering and apostasy; nor the Pleroma of the thirty Æons, which has been proved vain, and incapable of being believed in; nor that fable invented by the other heretics. But He taught that they should obey the commandments which God enjoined from the beginning, and do away with their former covetousness by good works, <a name="fr_3945"></a><a href="#fn_3945"><font size="1">3946</font></a>
  and follow after Christ. But that  <a name="page_477"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 477</font></a> <a name="ix.vi.xiii-Page_477"></a>  possessions distributed to the poor do annul former covetousness, Zaccheus made evident, when he said, “Behold, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one, I restore fourfold.” <a name="fr_3946"></a><a href="#fn_3946"><font size="1">3947</font></a>
