 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.viii.i.xi-p1"></a>  <span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.i.xi-p1.1"></a>Chapter X</span>.—<i>The daily wants of the Church supplied by the Emperor, and an account of his other virtues</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.i.xi-p2"></a><span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.i.xi-p2.1"></a>Thus</span> did the emperor write to the absent. To those who attended the council, three hundred and eighteen in number, he manifested great kindness, addressing them with much gentleness, and presenting them with gifts. He ordered numerous couches to be prepared for their accommodation and entertained them all at one banquet. Those who were most worthy he received at his own table, distributing the rest at the others. Observing that some among them had had the right eye torn out, and learning that this mutilation had been undergone for the sake of religion, he placed his lips upon the wounds, believing that he would extract a blessing from the kiss. After the conclusion of the feast, he again presented other gifts to them. He then wrote to the governors of the provinces, directing that provision-money should be given in every city to virgins and widows, and to those who were consecrated to the divine service; and he measured the amount of their annual allowance more by the impulse of his own generosity than by their need. The third part of the sum is distributed to this day. Julian impiously withheld the whole. His successor <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_363"><font size="1">364</font></a>
  conferred the sum which is now dispensed, the famine which then prevailed having lessened the resources of the state. If the pensions were formerly triple in amount to what they are at present, the generosity of the emperor can by this fact be easily seen.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.i.xi-p4"></a>I do not account it right to pass over the following circumstance in silence. Some quarrelsome individuals wrote accusations against <a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a> <a name="iv.viii.i.xi-Page_49"></a>certain bishops, and presented their indictments to the emperor. This occurring before the establishment of concord, he received the lists, formed them into a packet which he sealed with his ring, and ordered them to be kept safely. After the reconciliation had been effected, he brought out these writings, and burnt them in their presence, at the same time declaring upon oath that he had not read a word of them. He said that the crimes of priests ought not to be made known to the multitude, lest they should become an occasion of offence, and lead them to sin without fear. It is reported also that he added that if he were to detect a bishop in the very act of committing adultery, he would throw his imperial robe over the unlawful deed, lest any should witness the scene, and be thereby injured. Thus did he admonish all the priests, as well as confer honours upon them, and then exhorted them to return each to his own flock.</p>
