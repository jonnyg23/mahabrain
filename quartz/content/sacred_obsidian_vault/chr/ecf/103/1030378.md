 </p><p class="c39"><a name="iv.iii.v-p1"></a>  <span class="c2"><a name="iv.iii.v-p1.1"></a>Chapter 4.—That the Great Reason for the Advent of Christ Was the Commendation of Love.</span></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.iii.v-p2"></a>7. Moreover, what greater reason is apparent for the advent of the Lord than that God might show His love in us, commending it powerfully, inasmuch as “while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us”? <a name="fr_1357"></a><a href="#fn_1357"><font size="1">1358</font></a>
  And furthermore, this is with the intent that, inasmuch as charity is “the end of the commandment,” <a name="fr_1358"></a><a href="#fn_1358"><font size="1">1359</font></a>
  and “the fulfilling of the law,” <a name="fr_1359"></a><a href="#fn_1359"><font size="1">1360</font></a>
  we also may love one another and lay down our life for the brethren, even as He laid down His life for us. <a name="fr_1360"></a><a href="#fn_1360"><font size="1">1361</font></a>
  And with regard to God Himself, its object is that, even if it were an irksome task to love Him, it may now at least cease to be irksome for us to return His love, seeing that “He first loved us,” <a name="fr_1361"></a><a href="#fn_1361"><font size="1">1362</font></a>
  and “spared not His own only Son, but delivered Him up for us all.” <a name="fr_1362"></a><a href="#fn_1362"><font size="1">1363</font></a>
  For there is no mightier invitation to love than to anticipate in loving; and that soul is over hard which, supposing it unwilling indeed to give love, is unwilling also to give the return of love. But if, even in the case of criminal and sordid loves, we see how those who desire to be loved in return make it their special and absorbing business, by such proofs as are within their power, to render the strength of the love which they themselves bear plain and patent; if we also perceive how they affect to put forward an appearance of justice in what they thus offer, such as may qualify them in some sort to demand that a response be made in all fairness to them on the part of those souls which they are laboring to beguile; if, further, their own passion burns more vehemently when they observe that the minds which they are eager to possess are also moved now by the same fire: if thus, I say, it happens at once that the soul which before was torpid is excited so soon as it feels itself to be loved, and that <a name="page_287"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 287</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_287"></a>the soul which was enkindled already becomes the more inflamed so soon as it is made cognizant of the return of its own love, it is evident that no greater reason is to be found why love should be either originated or enlarged, than what appears in the occasion when one who as yet loves not at all comes to know himself to be the object of love, or when one who is already a lover either hopes that he may yet be loved in turn, or has by this time the evidence of a response to his affection. And if this holds good even in the case of base loves, how much more <a name="fr_1363"></a><a href="#fn_1363"><font size="1">1364</font></a>
  in (true) friendship? For what else have we carefully to attend to in this question touching the injuring of friendship than to this, namely, not to give our friend cause to suppose either that we do not love him at all, or that we love him less than he loves us? If, indeed, he is led to entertain this belief, he will be cooler in that love in which men enjoy the interchange of intimacies one with another; and if he is not of that weak type of character to which such an offense to affection will serve as a cause of freezing off from love altogether, he yet confines himself to that kind of affection in which he loves, not with the view of enjoyment to himself, but with the idea of studying the good of others. But again it is worth our while to notice how,—although superiors also have the wish to be loved by their inferiors, and are gratified with the zealous attention <a name="fr_1364"></a><a href="#fn_1364"><font size="1">1365</font></a>
  paid to them by such, and themselves cherish greater affection towards these inferiors the more they become cognizant of that,—with what might of love, nevertheless, the inferior kindles so soon as he learns that he is beloved by his superior. For there have we love in its more grateful aspect, where it does not consume itself <a name="fr_1365"></a><a href="#fn_1365"><font size="1">1366</font></a>
  in the drought of want, but flows forth in the plenteousness of beneficence. For the former type of love is of misery, the latter of mercy. <a name="fr_1366"></a><a href="#fn_1366"><font size="1">1367</font></a>
  And furthermore, if the inferior was despairing even of the possibility of his being loved by his superior, he will now be inexpressibly moved to love if the superior has of his own will condescended to show how much he loves this person who could by no means be bold enough to promise himself so great a good. But what is there superior to God in the character of Judge? and what more desperate than man in the character of sinner?—than man, I ask, who had given himself all the more unreservedly up to the wardship and domination of proud powers which are unable to make him blessed, as he had come more absolutely to despair of the possibility of his being an object of interest to that power which wills not to be exalted in wickedness, but is exalted in goodness.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.iii.v-p13"></a>8. If, therefore, it was mainly for this purpose that Christ came, to wit, that man might learn how much God loves him; and that he might learn this, to the intent that he might be kindled to the love of Him by whom he was first loved, and might also love his neighbor at the command and showing of Him who became our neighbor, in that He loved man when, instead of being a neighbor to Him, he was sojourning far apart: if, again, all divine Scripture, which was written aforetime, was written with the view of presignifying the Lords advent; and if whatever has been committed to writing in times subsequent to these, and established by divine authority, is a record of Christ, and admonishes us of love, it is manifest that on those two commandments of love to God and love to our neighbor <a name="fr_1367"></a><a href="#fn_1367"><font size="1">1368</font></a>
  hang not only all the law and the prophets, which at the time when the Lord spoke to that effect were as yet the only Holy Scripture, but also all those books of the divine literature which have been written <a name="fr_1368"></a><a href="#fn_1368"><font size="1">1369</font></a>
  at a later period for our health, and consigned to remembrance. Wherefore, in the Old Testament there is a veiling of the New, and in the New Testament there is a revealing of the Old. According to that veiling, carnal men, understanding things in a carnal fashion, have been under the dominion, both then and now, of a penal fear. According to this revealing, on the other hand, spiritual men,—among whom we reckon at once those then who knocked in piety and found even hidden things opened to them, and others now who seek in no spirit of pride, lest even things uncovered should be closed to them,—understanding in a spiritual fashion, have been made free through the love wherewith they have been gifted. Consequently, inasmuch as there is nothing more adverse to love than envy, and as pride is the mother of envy, the same Lord Jesus Christ, God-man, is both a manifestation of divine love towards us, and an example of human humility with us, to the end that our great swelling might be cured by a greater counteracting remedy. For here is great misery, proud man! But there is greater mercy, a humble God! Take this love, therefore, as the end that is set before <a name="page_288"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 288</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_288"></a>you, to which you are to refer all that you say, and, whatever you narrate, narrate it in such a manner that he to whom you are discoursing on hearing may believe, on believing may hope, on hoping may love.</p>
