 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.ii.ciii-p2"></a>Sometimes, however, a man in the goodness of his will desires something that God does not desire, even though Gods will is also good, nay, much more fully and more surely good (for His will never can be evil): for example, if a good son is anxious that his father should live, when it is Gods good will that he should die. Again, it is possible for a man with evil will to desire what God wills in His goodness: for example, if a bad son wishes his father to die, when this is also the will of God. It is plain that the former wishes what God does not wish, and that the latter wishes what God does wish; and yet the filial love of the former is more in harmony with the good will of God, though its desire is different from Gods, than the want of filial <a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 270</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ciii-Page_270"></a>affection of the latter, though its desire is the same as Gods. So necessary is it, in determining whether a mans desire is one to be approved or disapproved, to consider what it is proper for man, and what it is proper for God, to desire, and what is in each case the real motive of the will. For God accomplishes some of His purposes, which of course are all good, through the evil desires of wicked men: for example, it was through the wicked designs of the Jews, working out the good purpose of the Father, that Christ was slain and this event was so truly good, that when the Apostle Peter expressed his unwillingness that it should take place, he was designated Satan by Him who had come to be slain. <a name="fr_1291"></a><a href="#fn_1291"><font size="1">1292</font></a>
  How good seemed the intentions of the pious believers who were unwilling that Paul should go up to Jerusalem lest the evils which Agabus had foretold should there befall him! <a name="fr_1292"></a><a href="#fn_1292"><font size="1">1293</font></a>
  And yet it was Gods purpose that he should suffer these evils for preaching the faith of Christ, and thereby become a witness for Christ. And this purpose of His, which was good, God did not fulfill through the good counsels of the Christians, but through the evil counsels of the Jews; so that those who opposed His purpose were more truly His servants than those who were the willing instruments of its accomplishment.</p>
