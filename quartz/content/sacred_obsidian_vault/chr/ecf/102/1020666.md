 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XXII.5-p2"></a>But granting that this was once incredible, behold, now, the world has come to the belief that the earthly body of Christ was received up into heaven.  Already both the learned and unlearned have believed in the resurrection of the flesh and its ascension to the heavenly places, while only a very few either of the educated or uneducated are still staggered by it.  If this is a credible thing which is believed, then let those who do not believe see how stolid they are; and if it is incredible, then this also is an incredible thing, that what is incredible should have received such credit.  Here then we have two incredibles,—to wit, the resurrection of our body to eternity, and that the world should believe so incredible a thing; and both these incredibles the same God predicted should come to pass before either had as yet occurred.  We see that already one of the two has come to pass,  <a name="page_482"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 482</font></a> <a name="iv.XXII.5-Page_482"></a>  for the world has believed what was incredible; why should we despair that the remaining one shall also come to pass, and that this which the world believed, though it was incredible, shall itself occur?  For already that which was equally incredible has come to pass, in the worlds believing an incredible thing.  Both were incredible:  the one we see accomplished, the other we believe shall be; for both were predicted in those same Scriptures by means of which the world believed.  And the very manner in which the worlds faith was won is found to be even more incredible if we consider it.  Men uninstructed in any branch of a liberal education, without any of the refinement of heathen learning, unskilled in grammar, not armed with dialectic, not adorned with rhetoric, but plain fishermen, and very few in number,—these were the men whom Christ sent with the nets of faith to the sea of this world, and thus took out of every race so many fishes, and even the philosophers themselves, wonderful as they are rare.  Let us add, if you please, or because you ought to be pleased, this third incredible thing to the two former.  And now we have three incredibles, all of which have yet come to pass.  It is incredible that Jesus Christ should have risen in the flesh and ascended with flesh into heaven; it is incredible that the world should have believed so incredible a thing; it is incredible that a very few men, of mean birth and the lowest rank, and no education, should have been able so effectually to persuade the world, and even its learned men, of so incredible a thing.  Of these three incredibles, the parties with whom we are debating refuse to believe the first; they cannot refuse to see the second, which they are unable to account for if they do not believe the third.  It is indubitable that the resurrection of Christ, and His ascension into heaven with the flesh in which He rose, is already preached and believed in the whole world.  If it is not credible, how is it that it has already received credence in the whole world?  If a number of noble, exalted, and learned men had said that they had witnessed it, and had been at pains to publish what they had witnessed, it were not wonderful that the world should have believed it, but it were very stubborn to refuse credence; but if, as is true, the world has believed a few obscure, inconsiderable, uneducated persons, who state and write that they witnessed it, is it not unreasonable that a handful of wrong-headed men should oppose themselves to the creed of the whole world, and refuse their belief?  And if the world has put faith in a small number of men, of mean birth and the lowest rank, and no education, it is because the divinity of the thing itself appeared all the more manifestly in such contemptible witnesses.  The eloquence, indeed, which lent persuasion to their message, consisted of wonderful works, not words.  For they who had not seen Christ risen in the flesh, nor ascending into heaven with His risen body, believed those who related how they had seen these things, and who testified not only with words but wonderful signs.  For men whom they knew to be acquainted with only one, or at most two languages, they marvelled to hear speaking in the tongues of all nations.  They saw a man, lame from his mothers womb, after forty years stand up sound at their word in the name of Christ; that handkerchiefs taken from their bodies had virtue to heal the sick; that countless persons, sick of various diseases, were laid in a row in the road where they were to pass, that their shadow might fall on them as they walked, and that they forthwith received health; that many other stupendous miracles were wrought by them in the name of Christ; and, finally, that they even raised the dead.  If it be admitted that these things occurred as they are related, then we have a multitude of incredible things to add to those three incredibles.  That the one incredibility of the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ may be believed, we accumulate the testimonies of countless incredible miracles, but even so we do not bend the frightful obstinacy of these sceptics.  But if they do not believe that these miracles were wrought by Christs apostles to gain credence to their preaching of His resurrection and ascension, this one grand miracle suffices for us, that the whole world has believed without any miracles.</p>
