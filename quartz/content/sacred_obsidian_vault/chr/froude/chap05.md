 <h2 align="CENTER"><span style="font-weight: 400">ARREST AND TRIAL. </span> </h2>
 <p>BUNYAN'S preaching enterprise became an extraordinary success. All the Midland 
 Counties heard of his fame, and demanded to hear him. He had been Deacon under Gifford 
 at the Bedford Church; but he was in such request as a preacher, that, in 1657, 
 he was released from his duties there as unable to attend to them. Sects were springing 
 up all over England as weeds in a hot-bed. He was soon in controversy; controversy 
 with Church of England people; controversy with the Ranters, who believed Christ 
 to be a myth; controversy with the Quakers, who, at their outset, disbelieved in 
 his Divinity and in the inspiration of the Scriptures. Envy at his rapidly acquired 
 reputation brought him baser enemies. He was called a witch, a Jesuit, a highwayman. 
 It was reported that he had "his misses," that he had two wives, etc. "My foes have 
 missed their mark in this," he said, with honest warmth: "I am not the man. If all 
 the fornicators and adulterers in England were hanged by the neck, John Bunyan, 
 the object of their envy, would be still alive and well. I know not whether there 
 be such a thing as a woman breathing under the cope of the whole heavens but by 
 their apparel, their children, or common fame, except my wife." </p>
 <p>But a more serious trial was now before him. Cromwell passed away. The Protectorate 
 came to an end. England decided that it had had enough of Puritans and republicans, 
 and would give the Stuarts and the Established Church another trial. A necessary 
 consequence was the revival of the Act of Uniformity. The Independents were not 
 meek like the Baptists, using no weapons to oppose what they disapproved but passive 
 resistance. The same motives which had determined the original constitution of a 
 Church combining the characters of Protestant and Catholic, instead of leaving religion 
 free, were even more powerful at the Eestoration than they had been at the accession 
 of Elizabeth. Before toleration is possible, men must have learnt to tolerate toleration 
 itself; and in times of violent convictions, toleration is looked on as indifference, 
 and indifference as Atheism in disguise. Catholics and Protestants, Churchmen and 
 Dissenters, regarded one another as enemies of God and the State, with whom no peace 
 was possible. Toleration had been tried by the Valois princes in France. Church 
 and chapel had been the rendezvous of armed fanatics. The preachers blew the war-trumpet, 
 and every town and village had been the scene of furious conflicts, which culminated 
 in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. The same result would have followed in England 
 if the same experiment had been ventured. The different communities were forbidden 
 to have their separate places of worship, and services were contrived which moderate 
 men of all sorts could use and interpret after their own convictions. The instrument 
 required to be delicately handled. It succeeded tolerably as long as Elizabeth lived. 
 When Elizabeth died, the balance was no longer fairly kept. The High-Church party 
 obtained the ascendency, and abused their power. Tyranny brought revolution, and 
 the Catholic element in turn disappeared. </p>
 <p>The Bishops were displaced by Presbyterian elders. The Presbyterian elders became 
 in turn "hireling wolves," "old priest" written in new characters. Cromwell had 
 left conscience free to Protestants. But even he had refused equal liberty to Catholics 
 and Episcopalians. He was gone too, and Church and King were back again. How were 
 they to stand? The stern, resolute men, to whom the Commonwealth had been the establishment 
 of God's kingdom upon earth, were as little inclined to keep terms with Antichrist 
 as the Church people had been inclined to keep terms with Cromwell. To have allowed 
 them to meet openly in their conventicles would have been to make over the whole 
 of England to them as a seed-bed in which to plant sedition. It was pardonable, 
 it was even necessary, for Charles II. and his advisers to fall back upon Elizabeth's 
 principles, at least as long as the ashes were still glowing. Indulgence had to 
 be postponed till cooler times. With the Fifth Monarchy men abroad, every chapel, 
 except those of the Baptists, would have been a magazine of explosives. </p>
 <p>Under the 35th of Elizabeth, Nonconformists refusing to attend worship in the 
 parish churches were to be imprisoned till they made their submission. Three months 
 were allowed them to consider. If at the end of that time they were still obstinate, 
 they were to be banished the realm; and if they subsequently returned to England 
 without permission from the Crown, they were liable to execution as felons. This 
 Act had fallen with the Long Parliament, but at the Eestoration it was held to have 
 revived and to be still in force. The parish churches were cleared of their unordained 
 ministers. The Dissenters' chapels were closed. The people were required by proclamation 
 to be present on Sundays in their proper place. </p>
 <p>So the majority of the nation had decided. If they had wished for religious liberty 
 they would not have restored the Stuarts, or they would have insisted on conditions, 
 and would have seen that they were observed. </p>
 <p>Venner's plot showed the reality of the danger and justified the precaution.
 </p>
 <p>The Baptists and Quakers might have been trusted to discourage violence, but 
 it was impossible to distinguish among the various sects, whose tenets were unknown 
 and even unsettled. The great body of Cromwell's spiritual supporters believed that 
 armed resistance to a government which they disapproved was not only lawful, but 
 was enjoined. </p>
 <p>Thus, no sooner was Charles II. on the throne than the Nonconformists found themselves 
 again under bondage. Their separate meetings were prohibited, and they were not 
 only forbidden to worship in their own fashion, but they had to attend church, under 
 penalties. The Bedford Baptists refused to obey. Their meeting-house in the town 
 was shut up, but they continued to assemble in woods and outhouses; Bunyan preaching 
 to them as before, and going to the place in disguise. Informers were soon upon 
 his track. The magistrates had received orders to be vigilant. Bunyan was the most 
 prominent Dissenter in the neighbourhood. He was too sensible to court martyrdom. 
 He had intended to leave the town till more quiet times, and had arranged to meet 
 a few of bis people once more to give them a parting address. It was November 12, 
 1660. The place agreed on was a house in the village of Samsell, near Harlington. 
 Notice of his intention was privately conveyed to Mr. Wingate, a magistrate in the 
 adjoining district. The constables were set to watch the house, and were directed 
 to bring Bunyan before him. </p>
 <p>Some member of the congregation heard of it. Bunyan was warned, and was advised 
 to stay at home that night, or else to conceal himself. His departure had been already 
 arranged; but when he learnt that a warrant was actually out against him, he thought 
 that he was bound to stay and face the danger. He was the first Nonconformist who 
 had been marked for arrest. If he flinched after he had been singled out by name, 
 the whole body of his congregation would be discouraged. Go to church he would not, 
 or promise to go to church; but he was willing to suffer whatever punishment the 
 law might order. Thus, at the time and place which had been agreed on, he was in 
 the room at Samsell, with his Bible in his hand, and was about to begin his address, 
 when the constables entered and arrested him. He made no resistance. He desired 
 only to be allowed to say a few words, which the constables permitted. He then prepared 
 to go with them. He was not treated with any roughness. It was too late to take 
 him that night before the magistrate. His friends undertook for his appearance when 
 he should be required, and he went home with them. The constables came for him again 
 on the following afternoon. </p>
 <p>Mr. Wingate, when the information was first brought to him, supposed that he 
 had fallen on a nest of Fifth Monarchy men. He enquired, when Bunyan was brought 
 in, how many arms had been found at the meeting. When he learnt that there were 
 no arms, and that it had no political character whatever, he evidently thought it 
 was a matter of no consequence. He told Bunyan that he had been breaking the law, 
 and asked him why he could not attend to his business. Bunyan said that his object 
 in teaching was merely to persuade people to give up their sins. He could do that 
 and attend to his business also. </p>
 <p>Wingate answered that the law must be obeyed. He must commit Bunyan for trial 
 at the Quarter Sessions; but he would take bail for him, if his securities would 
 engage that he would not preach again meanwhile. Bunyan refused to be bailed on 
 any such terms. Preach he would and must, and the recognizances would be forfeited. 
 After such an answer, Wingate could only send him to gaol; he could not help himself. 
 The committal was made out, and Bunyan was being taken away, when two of his friends 
 met him, who were acquainted with Wingate, and they begged the constable to wait. 
 They went in to the magistrate. They told him who and what Bunyan was. The magistrate 
 had not the least desire to be hard, and it was agreed that if he would himself 
 give some general promise of a vague kind he might be let go altogether. Bunyan 
 was called back. Another magistrate who knew him had by this time joined Wingate. 
 They both said that they were reluctant to send him to prison. If he would promise 
 them that he would not call the people together any more, he might go home. </p>
 <p>They had purposely chosen a form of words which would mean as little as possible. 
 But Bunyan would not accept an evasion. He said that he would not force the people 
 to come together, but if he was in a place where the people were met, he should 
 certainly speak to them. The magistrate repeated that the meetings were unlawful. 
 They would be satisfied if Bunyan would simply promise that he would not call such 
 meetings. It was as plain as possible that they wished to dismiss the case, and 
 they were thrusting words into his mouth which he could use without a mental reservation; 
 but he persisted that there were many ways in which a meeting might be called; if 
 people came together to hear him, knowing that he would speak, he might be said 
 to have called them together. </p>
 <p>Remonstrances and entreaties were equally useless, and, with extreme unwillingness, 
 they committed him to Bedford gaol to wait for the sessions. </p>
 <p>It is not for us to say that Bunyan was too precise. He was himself the best 
 judge of what his conscience and his situation required. To himself, at any rate, 
 his trial was at the moment most severe. He had been left a widower a year or two 
 before, with four young children, one of them blind. He had lately married a second 
 time. His wife was pregnant. The agitation at her husband's arrest brought on premature 
 labour, and she was lying in his house in great danger. He was an affectionate man, 
 and the separation at such a time was peculiarly distressing. After some weeks the 
 Quarter Sessions came on. Bunyan was indicted under the usual form, that he, "being 
 a person of such and such condition, had, since such a time, devilishly and pertinaciously 
 abstained from coming to church to hear Divine service, and was a common upholder 
 of unlawful meetings and conventicles, to the great disturbance and distraction 
 of the good subjects of this kingdom, contrary to the laws of our Sovereign Lord 
 the King." </p>
 <p>There seems to have been a wish to avoid giving him a formal trial. He was not 
 required to plead, and it may have been thought that he had been punished sufficiently. 
 He was asked why he did not go to church? He said that the Prayer-book was made 
 by man; he was ordered in the Bible to pray with the spirit and the understanding, 
 not with the spirit and the Prayer-book. The magistrates, referring to another Act 
 of Parliament, cautioned Bunyan against finding fault with the Prayer-book, or he 
 would bring himself into further trouble. Justice Keelin, who presided, said (so 
 Bunyan declares, and it has been the standing jest of his biographers ever since) 
 that the Prayer-book had been in use ever since the Apostles' time. Perhaps the 
 words were that parts of it had been then in use (the Apostles' Creed, for instance), 
 and thus they would have been strictly true. However this might be, they told him 
 kindly, as Mr. Wingate had done, that it would be better for him if he would keep 
 to his proper work. The law had prohibited conventicles. He might teach, if he pleased, 
 in his own family and among his friends. He must not call large numbers of people 
 together. He was as impracticable as before, and the magistrates, being but unregen-erate 
 mortals, may be pardoned if they found him provoking. If, he said, it was lawful 
 for him to do good to a few, it must be equally lawful to do good to many. He had 
 a gift, which he was bound to use. If it was sinful for men to meet together to 
 exhort one another to follow Christ, he should sin still. </p>
 <p>He was compelling the Court to punish him, whether they wished it or not. He 
 describes the scene as if the choice had rested with the magistrates to convict 
 him or to let him go. If he was bound to do his duty, they were equally bound to 
 do theirs. They took his answers as a plea of guilty to the indictment, and Justice 
 Keelin, who was chairman, pronounced his sentence in the terms of the Act. He was 
 to go to prison for three months; if, at the end of three months, he still refused 
 to conform, he was to be transported; and if he came back without license he would 
 be hanged. Bunyan merely answered, "If I were out of prison to-day, I would preach 
 the Gospel again to-morrow." More might have followed, but the gaoler led him away."
 </p>
 <p>There were three gaols in Bedford, and no evidence has been found to show in 
 which of the three Bunyan was confined. Two of them, the county gaol and the town 
 gaol, were large, roomy buildings. Tradition has chosen the third, a small lock-up, 
 fourteen feet square, which stood over the river between the central arches of the 
 old bridge; and as it appears from the story that he had at times fifty or sixty 
 fellow-prisoners, and as he admits himself that he was treated at first with exceptional 
 kindness, it may be inferred that tradition, in selecting the prison on the bridge, 
 was merely desiring to exhibit the sufferings of the Nonconformist martyr in a sensational 
 form, and that he was never in this prison at all. When it was pulled down in 1811, 
 a gold ring was found in the rubbish, with the initials "J. B." upon it. This is 
 one of the "trifles light as air" which carry conviction to the "jealous" only, 
 and is too slight a foundation on which to assert a fact so inherently improbable.
 </p>
 <p>When the three months were over, the course of law would have brought him again 
 to the bar, when he would have had to choose between conformity and exile. There 
 was still the same desire to avoid extremities, and as the day approached, the clerk 
 of the peace was sent to persuade him into some kind of compliance. Various insurrections 
 had broken out since his arrest, and must have shown him, if he could have reflected, 
 that there was real reason for the temporary enforcement of the Act. He was not 
 asked to give up preaching. He was asked only to give tip public preaching. It was 
 well known that he had no disposition to rebellion. Even the going to church was 
 not insisted on. The clerk of the peace told him that he might "exhort his neighbours 
 in private discourse," if only he would not bring the people together in numbers, 
 which the magistrates would be bound to notice. In this way he might continue his 
 usefulness, and would not be interfered with. </p>
 <p>Bunyan knew his own freedom from seditious intentions. He would not see that 
 the magistrates could not suspend the law and make an exception in his favour. They 
 were going already to the utmost limit of indulgence. But the more he disapproved 
 of rebellion, the more punctilious he was in carrying out resistance of another 
 kind which he held to be legitimate. He was a representative person, and he thought 
 that in yielding he would hurt the cause of religious liberty. "The law," he said, 
 "had provided two ways of obeying--one to obey actively, and if he could not in conscience 
 obey actively, then to suffer whatever penalty was inflicted on him." </p>
 <p>The clerk of the peace could produce no effect. Bunyan rather looked on him as 
 a false friend trying to entangle him. The three months elapsed, and the magistrates 
 had to determine what was to be done. If Bunyan was brought before them, they must 
 exile him. His case was passed over and he was left in prison, where his wife and 
 children were allowed to visit him daily. He did not understand the law or appreciate 
 their forbearance. He exaggerated his danger. At the worst he could only have been 
 sent to America, where he might have remained as long as he pleased. He feared that 
 he might perhaps be hanged. </p>
 <p>"I saw what was coming," he said, "and had two considerations especially on my 
 heart--how to be able to endure, should my imprisonment be long and tedious, and 
 how to be able to encounter death should that be my portion. I was made to see that 
 if I would suffer rightly, I must pass sentence of death upon everything that can 
 properly be called a thing of this life, even to reckon myself, my wife, my children, 
 my health, my enjoyments all as dead to me, and myself as dead to them. Yet I was 
 a man compassed with infirmities. The parting with my wife and poor children hath 
 often been to me in this place (the prison in which he was writing) as the pulling 
 of my flesh from my bones; and that not only because I am too, too fond of those 
 great mercies, but also because I should have often brought to my mind the hardships, 
 miseries, and wants my poor family was like to meet with should I be taken from 
 them, especially my poor blind child, who lay nearer my heart than all I had besides. 
 Poor child, thought I, what sorrow art thou like to have for thy portion in this 
 world! Thou must be beaten, suffer hunger, cold, nakedness, and a thousand calamities, 
 though I cannot now endure the wind should blow on thee. But yet, thought I, I must 
 venture all with God, though it goeth to the quick to leave you. I was as a man 
 who was pulling down his house upon the head of his wife and children. Yet, thought 
 I, I must do it--I must do it. I had this for consideration, that if I should now 
 venture all for God, I engaged God to take care of my concernments. Also, I had 
 dread of the torments of hell, which I was sure they must partake of that for fear 
 of the cross do shrink from their profession. I had this much upon my spirit, that 
 my imprisonment might end in the gallows for aught I could tell. In the condition 
 I now was in I was not fit to die, nor indeed did I think I could if I should be 
 called to it. I feared I might show a weak heart, and give occasion to the enemy. 
 This lay with great trouble on me, for methought I was ashamed to die with a pale 
 face and tottering knees for such a cause as this. The things of God were kept out 
 of my sight. The tempter followed me with, 'But whither must you go when you die? 
 What will become of you? What evidence have you for heaven and glory, and an inheritance 
 among them that are sanctified?' Thus was I tossed many weeks; but I felt it was 
 for the Word and way of God that I was in this condition. God might give me comfort 
 or not as He pleased. I was bound, but He was free--yea, it was my duty to stand 
 to His Word, whether He would ever look upon me or no, or save me at the last. Wherefore, 
 thought I, the point being thus, I am for going on and venturing my eternal state 
 with Christ, whether I have comfort here or no. If God does not come in, thought 
 I, I will leap off the ladder even blindfold into eternity, sink or swim, come heaven, 
 come hell. Now was my heart full of comfort." </p>
 <p>The ladder was an imaginary ladder, but the resolution was a genuine manly one, 
 such, as lies at the bottom of all brave and honourable action. Others who have 
 thought very differently from Bunyan about such matters have felt the same as he 
 felt. Be true to yourself, whatever comes, even if damnation come. Better hell with 
 an honest heart, than heaven with cowardice and insincerity. It was the more creditable 
 to Bunyan, too, because the spectres and hobgoblins had begun occasionally to revisit 
 him. </p>
 <p>"Of all temptations I ever met with in my life," he says, "to question the being 
 of God and the truth of His Gospel is the worst, and worst to be borne. When this 
 temptation comes, it takes my girdle from me, and removes the foundation from under 
 me. Though God has visited my soul with never so blessed a discovery of Himself, 
 yet afterwards I have been in my spirit so filled with darkness, that I could not 
 so much as once conceive what that God and that comfort was with which I had been 
 refreshed." </p>
