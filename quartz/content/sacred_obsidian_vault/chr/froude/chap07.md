 <h2 align="CENTER"><span style="font-weight: 400">LIFE AND DEATH OF MR. BADMAN.
 </span></h2>
 <p>TO his contemporaries Bunyan was known as the Nonconformist Martyr, and the greatest 
 living Protestant preacher. To us he is mainly interesting through his writings, 
 and especially through <i>The Pilgrim's Progress. </i>Although he possessed in a 
 remarkable degree the gift of expressing himself in written words, he had himself 
 no value for literature. He cared simply for spiritual truth, and literature in 
 his eyes was only useful as a means of teaching it. Every thing with which a reasonable 
 man could concern himself was confined within the limits of Christian faith and 
 practice. Ambition was folly. Amusement was idle trifling in a life so short as 
 man's, and with issues so far-reaching depending upon it. To understand, and to 
 make others understand, what Christ had done, and what Christ required men to do, 
 was the occupation of his whole mind, and no object ever held his attention except 
 in connection with it. With a purpose so strict, and a theory of religion so precise, 
 there is usually little play for imagination or feeling. Though we read Protestant 
 theology as a duty, we find it as dry in the mouth as sawdust. The literature which 
 would please must represent nature, and nature refuses to be bound into our dogmatic 
 systems. No object can be pictured truly, except by a mind which has sympathy with 
 it. Shakspeare no more hates Iago than Iago hates himself. He allows Iago to exhibit 
 himself in his own way, as nature does. Every character, if justice is to be done 
 to it, must be painted at its best, as it appears to itself; and a man impressed 
 deeply with religious convictions is generally incapable of the sympathy which would 
 give him an insight into what he disapproves and denies. And yet Bunyan, intensely 
 religious as he was, and narrow as his theology was, is always human. His genius 
 remains fresh and vigorous under the least promising conditions. All mankind being 
 under sin together, he has no favourites to flatter, no opponents to misrepresent. 
 There is a kindliness in his descriptions even of the Evil One's attacks upon himself.
 </p>
 <i></i>
 <p><i>The Pilgrim's Progress, </i>though professedly an allegoric story of the Protestant 
 plan of salvation, is conceived in the large, wide spirit of humanity itself. Anglo-Catholic 
 and Lutheran, Calvinist and Deist can alike read it with delight, and find their 
 own theories in it. Even the Ro-manist has only to blot out a few paragraphs, and 
 can discover no purer model of a Christian life to place in the hands of his children. 
 The religion of <i>The Pilgrim's Progress </i>is the religion which must be always 
 and everywhere, as long as man believes that he has a soul and is responsible for 
 his actions; and thus it is that, while theological folios once devoured as manna 
 from Heaven now lie on the bookshelves dead as Egyptian mummies, this book is wrought 
 into the mind and memory of every well-conditioned English or American child; while 
 the matured man, furnished with all the knowledge which literature can teach him, 
 still finds the adventures of Christian as charming as the adventures of Ulysses 
 or Æneas. He sees there the reflexion of himself, the familiar features of his own 
 nature, which remain the same from era to era. Time cannot impair its interest, 
 or intellectual progress make it cease to be true to experience. </p>
 <p>But <i>The Pilgrim's Progress, </i>though the best known, is not the only work 
 of imagination which Bunyan produced; he wrote another religious allegory, which 
 Lord Macaulay thought would have been the best of its kind in the world if <i>The 
 Pilgrim's Progress </i>had not existed. The <i>Life of Mr. Badman, </i>though now 
 scarcely read at all, contains a vivid picture of rough English life in the days 
 of Charles II. Bunyan was a poet, too, in the technical sense of the word; and though 
 he disclaimed the name, and though rhyme and metre were to him as Saul's armour 
 to David, the fine quality of his mind still shows itself in the uncongenial accoutrements.
 </p>
 <p>It has been the fashion to call Bunyan's verse doggerel; but no verse is doggerel 
 which has a sincere and rational meaning in it. Goethe, who understood his own trade, 
 says that the test of poetry is the substance which remains when the poetry is reduced 
 to prose. Bunyan had infinite invention. His mind was full of objects which he had 
 gathered at first-hand, from observation and reflection. He had excellent command 
 of the English language, and could express what he wished with sharp, defined outlines, 
 and without the waste of a word. The rhythmical structure of his prose is carefully 
 correct. Scarcely a syllable is ever out of place. His ear for verse, though less 
 true, is seldom wholly at fault, and, whether in prose or verse, he had the superlative 
 merit that he could never v/rite nonsense. If one of the motives of poetical form 
 be to clothe thought and feeling in the dress in which it can be most easily remembered, 
 Bunyan's lines are often as successful as the best lines of Quarles or George Herbert. 
 Who, for instance, could forget these?-- </p>
 <p>        "Sin is the worm of hell, the lasting 
 fire:<br>
         Hell would soon lose its heat should 
 sin expire; <br>
         Better sinless in hell than to be where
 <br>
         Heaven is, and to be found a sinner there."
 </p>
 <p>Or these, on persons whom the world calls men of spirit:-- </p>
 <p>        "Though you dare crack a coward's 
 crown,<br>
         Or quarrel for a pin, <br>
         You dare not on the wicked frown,
 <br>
         Or speak against their sin." </p>
 <p>The <i>Book of Ruth </i>and the <i>History of Joseph, </i>done into blank verse, 
 are really beautiful idylls. The substance with which he worked, indeed, is so good 
 that there would be a difficulty in "spoiling it completely; but the prose of the 
 translation in the English Bible, faultless as it is, loses nothing in Bunyan's 
 hands, and if we found these poems in the collected works of a poet laureate, we 
 should consider that a difficult task had been accomplished successfully. Bunyan 
 felt, like the translators of the preceding century, that the text was sacred, that 
 his duty was to give the exact meaning of it, without epithets or ornaments, and 
 thus the original grace is completely preserved. </p>
 <p>Of a wholly different kind, and more after Quarles's manner, is a collection 
 of thoughts in verse, which he calls a book for boys and girls. All his observations 
 ran naturally in one direction; to minds possessed and governed by religion, nature--be 
 their creed what it may--is always a parable reflecting back their own views.
 </p>
 <p>But how neatly expressed are these <i>Meditations upon an Egg:--</i> </p>
 <p>        "The egg's no chick by faling from 
 a hen, <br>
         Nor man's a Christian till he's born 
 again;<br>
         The egg's at first contained in the shell,
 <br>
         Men afore grace in sin and darkness dwell;
 <br>
         The egg, when laid, by warmth is made 
 a chicken, <br>
         And Christ by grace the dead in sin doth 
 quicken; <br>
         The egg when first a chick the shell's 
 its prison, <br>
         So flesh to soul who yet with Christ 
 is risen." </p>
 <p>Or this, <i>On a Swallow:-- </i></p>
 <i></i>
 <p>        "This pretty bird! Oh, how she flies 
 and sings; <br>
         But could she do so if she had not wings?
 <br>
         Her wings bespeak my faith, her songs 
 my peace; <br>
         When I believe and sing, my doubtings 
 cease. </p>
 <p>Though the Globe Theatre was, in the opinion of Nonconformists, "the heart of 
 Satan's empire," Bunyan must yet have known something of Shakspeare. In the second 
 part of <i>The Pilgrim's Progress </i>we find:-- </p>
 <p>        "Who would true valour see,<br>
         Let him come hither; <br>
         One here will constant be,<br>
         Come wind, come weather." </p>
 <p>The resemblance to the song in <i>As You Like It </i>is too near to be accidental:--
 </p>
 <p>        "Who doth ambition shun, <br>
         And loves to be in the sun; <br>
         Seeking the food he eats, <br>
         And pleased with what he gets, <br>
         Come hither, come hither, come hither.
 <br>
         Here shall be no enemy, <br>
         Save winter and rough weather." </p>
 <p>Bunyan may, perhaps, have heard the lines, and the rhymes may have clung to him 
 without his knowing whence they came. But he would never have been heard of outside 
 his own communion, if his imagination had found no better form of expression for 
 itself than verse.</p>
 <p>His especial gift was for allegory, the single form of imaginative fiction which 
 he would not have considered trivial, and his especial instrument was plain, unaffected 
 Saxon prose. <i>The Holy War </i>is a people's Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained 
 in one. The <i>Life of Mr. Badman </i>is a didactic tale, describing the career 
 of a vulgar, middle-class, unprincipled scoundrel. </p>
 <p>These are properly Bunyan's "works," the results of his life, so far as it affects 
 the present generation of Englishmen; and as they are little known, I shall give 
 an account of each of them. </p>
 <p>The <i>Life of Badman </i>is presented as a dialogue between Mr. Wiseman and 
 Mr. Attentive. Mr. Wiseman tells the story, Mr. Attentive comments upon it. The 
 names recall Bunyan's well-known manner. The figures stand for typical characters; 
 but as the <i>dramatis personœ </i>of many writers of fiction, while professing 
 to be beings of flesh and blood, are no more than shadows, so Bunyan's shadows are 
 solid men, whom we can feel and handle. </p>
 <p>Mr. Badman is, of course, one of the "reprobate." Bunyan considered theoretically 
 that a reprobate may to outward appearance have the graces of a saint, and that 
 there may be little in his conduct to mark his true character. A reprobate may be 
 sorry for his sins, he may repent and lead a good life. He may reverence good men, 
 and may try to resemble them; he may pray, and his prayers may be answered; he may 
 have the spirit of God, and may receive another heart, and yet he may be under the 
 covenant of works, and may be eternally lost. This Bunyan could say while he was 
 writing theology; but art has its rules as well as its more serious sister, and 
 when he had to draw a living specimen, he drew him as he had seen him in his own 
 Bedford neighbourhood. </p>
 <p>Badman showed from childhood a propensity for evil. He was so "addicted to lying 
 that his parents could not distinguish when he was speaking the truth. He would 
 invent, tell, and stand to the lies which he invented, with such an audacious face, 
 that one might read in his very countenance the symptoms of a hard and desperate 
 heart. It was not the fault of his parents; they were much dejected at the beginnings 
 of their son; nor did he want counsel and correction, if that would have made him 
 better; but all availed nothing." </p>
 <p>Lying was not Badman's only fault. He took to pilfering and stealing. He robbed 
 his neighbours' orchards. He picked up money if he found it lying about. Especially, 
 Mr. Wiseman notes that he hated Sundays. "Reading Scriptures, godly conferences, 
 repeating of sermons and prayers, were things that he could not away with." "He 
 was an enemy to that day, because more restraint was laid upon him from his own 
 ways than was possible on any other." Mr. Wiseman never doubts that the Puritan 
 Sunday ought to have been appreciated by little boys. If a child disliked it, the 
 cause could only be his own wickedness. Young Badman "was greatly given also to 
 swearing and cursing." "He made no more of it" than Mr. Wiseman made "of telling 
 his fingers." "He counted it a glory to swear and curse, and it was as natural to 
 him as to eat, drink, or sleep." Bunyan, in this description, is supposed to have 
 taken the picture from himself. But too much may be made of this. He was thinking, 
 perhaps, of what he might have been if God's grace had not preserved him. He himself 
 was saved. Badman is represented as given over from the first. Anecdotes, however, 
 are told of contemporary providential judgments upon swearers, which had much impressed 
 Bunyan. One was of a certain Dorothy Mately, a woman whose business was to wash 
 rubbish at the Derby lead-mines. Dorothy (it was in the year when Bunyan was first 
 imprisoned) had stolen twopence from the coat of a boy who was working near her. 
 When the boy taxed her with having robbed him, she wished the ground might swallow 
 her up if she had ever touched his money. Presently after, some children, who were 
 watching her, saw a movement in the bank on which she was standing. They called 
 to her to take care, but it was too late. The bank fell in, and she was carried 
 down along with it. A man ran to help her, but the sides of the pit were crumbling 
 round her: a large stone fell on her head; the rubbish followed, and she was overwhelmed. 
 When she was dug out afterwards, the pence were found in her pocket. Bunyan was 
 perfectly satisfied that her death was supernatural. To discover miracles is not 
 peculiar to Catholics. They will be found wherever there is an active belief in 
 immediate providential government. </p>
 <p>Those more cautious in forming their conclusions will think, perhaps, that the 
 woman was working above some shaft in the mine, that the crust had suddenly broken, 
 and that it would equally have fallen in, when gravitation required it to fall, 
 if Dorothy Mately had been a saint. They will remember the words about the Tower 
 of Siloam. But to return to Badman. </p>
 <p>His father, being unable to manage so unpromising a child, bound him out as an 
 apprentice. The master to whom he was assigned was as good a man as the father could 
 find: upright, God-fearing, and especially considerate of his servants. He never 
 worked them too hard. He left them time to read and pray. He admitted no light or 
 mischievous books within his doors. He was not one of those whose religion "hung 
 as a cloke in his house, and </p>
 <p>was never seen on him when he went abroad." His household was as well fed and 
 cared for as himself, and he required nothing of others of which he did not set 
 them an example in his own person. </p>
 <p>This man did his best to reclaim young Badman, and was particularly kind to him. 
 But his exertions were thrown away. The good-for-nothing youth read filthy romances 
 on the sly. He fell asleep in church, or made eyes at the pretty girls. He made 
 acquaintance with low companions. He became profligate, got drunk at ale-houses, 
 sold his master's property to get money, or stole it out of the cash-box. Thrice 
 he ran away and was taken back again. The third time he was allowed to go. "The 
 House of Correction would have been the most fit for him, but thither his master 
 was loath to send him, for the love he bore his father." </p>
 <p>He was again apprenticed; this time to a master like himself. Being wicked, he 
 was given over to wickedness. The ways of it were not altogether pleasant. He was 
 fed worse and he was worked harder than he had been before; when he stole, or neglected 
 his business, he was beaten. He liked his new place, however, better than the old. 
 "At least, there was no godliness in the house, which he hated worst of all."
 </p>
 <p>So far, Bunyan's hero was travelling the usual road of the Idle Apprentice, and 
 the gallows would have been the commonplace ending of it. But this would not have 
 answered Bunyan's purpose. He wished to represent the good-for-nothing character, 
 under the more instructive aspect of worldly success, which bad men may arrive at 
 as well as good, if they are prudent and cunning. Bunyan gives his hero every chance. 
 He submits him from the first to the best influences; he creates opportunities for 
 repentance at every stage of a long career--opportunities which the reprobate nature 
 cannot profit by, yet increases its guilt by neglecting. </p>
 <p>Badman's term being out, his father gives him money and sets him up as a tradesman 
 on his own account. Mr. Attentive considers this to have been a mistake. Mr. Wiseman 
 answers that, even in the most desperate cases, kindness in parents is more likely 
 to succeed than severity, and, if it fails, they will have the less to reproach 
 themselves with. The kindness is, of course, thrown away. Badman continues a loose 
 blackguard, extravagant, idle, and dissolute. He comes to the edge of ruin. His 
 situation obliges him to think; and now the interest of the story begins. He must 
 repair his fortune by some means or other. The easiest way is by marriage. There 
 was a young orphan lady in the neighbourhood, who was well off and her own mistress. 
 She was a "professor," eagerly given to religion, and not so wise as she ought to 
 have been. Badman pretends to be converted. He reforms, or seems to reform. He goes 
 to meeting, sings hymns, adopts the most correct form of doctrine, tells the lady 
 that he does not want her money, but that he wants a companion who will go with 
 him along the road to Heaven. He was plausible, good-looking, and, to all appearance, 
 as absorbed as herself in the one thing needful. The congregation warn her, but 
 to no purpose. She marries him, and finds what she has done too late. In her fortune 
 he has all that he wanted. He swears at her, treats her brutally, brings prostitutes 
 into his house, laughs at her religion, and at length orders her to give it up. 
 When she refuses, Bunyan introduces a special feature of the times, and makes Badman 
 threaten to turn informer, and bring her favourite minister to gaol. The informers 
 were the natural but most accursed products of the Conventicle Acts. Popular abhorrence 
 relieved itself by legends of the dreadful judgments which had overtaken these wretches.
 </p>
 <p>In St. Neots an informer was bitten by a dog. The wound gangrened, and the flesh 
 rotted off his bones. In Bedford "there was one W. S." (Bunyan probably knew him 
 too well), "a man of very wicked life, and he, when there seemed to be countenance 
 given it, would needs turn informer. Well, so he did, and was as diligent in his 
 business as most of them could be. He would watch at nights, climb trees, and range 
 the woods of days, if possible to find out the meeters, for then they were forced 
 to meet in the fields. Yea, he would curse them bitterly, and swore most fearfully 
 what he would do to them when he found them. Well, after he had gone on like a Bedlam 
 in his course awhile, and had done some mischief to the people, he was stricken 
 by the hand of God. He was taken with a faltering in his speech, a weakness in the 
 back sinews of his neck, that ofttimes he held up his head by strength of hand. 
 After this his speech went quite away, and he could speak no more than a swine or 
 a bear. Like one of them he would gruntle and make an ugly noise, according as he 
 was offended or pleased, or would have anything done. He walked about till God had 
 made a sufficient spectacle of his judgments for his sin, and then, on a sudden, 
 he was stricken, and died miserably." </p>
 <p>Badman, says Mr. Wiseman, "had malice enough in his heart" to turn informer, 
 bat he was growing prudent and had an eye to the future. As a tradesman he had to 
 live by his neighbours. He knew that they would not forgive him, so "he had that 
 wit in his anger that he did it not." Nothing else was neglected to make the unfortunate 
 wife miserable. She bore him seven children, also typical figures. "One was a very 
 gracious child, that loved its mother dearly. This child Mr. Badman could not abide, 
 and it oftenest felt the weight of its father's fingers. Three were as bad as himself. 
 The others that remained became a kind of mongrel professors, not so bad as their 
 father nor so good as their mother, but betwixt them both. They had their mother's 
 notions and their father's actions. Their father did not like them because they 
 had their mother's tongue. Their mother did not like them because they had their 
 father's heart and life, nor were they fit company for good or bad. They were forced 
 with Esau to join in affinity with Ishmael--to wit, to look out for a people that 
 were hypocrites like themselves, and with them they matched and lived and died."
 </p>
 <p>Badman; meanwhile, with the help of his wife's fortune, grew into an important 
 person, and his character becomes a curious study. "He went," we are told, "to school 
 with the devil, from his childhood to the end of his life." He was shrewd in matters 
 of business, began to extend his operations, and "drove a great trade." He carried 
 a double face. He was evil with the evil. He pretended to be good with the good. 
 In religion he affected to be a freethinker, careless of death and judgment, and 
 ridiculing those who feared them "as frighted with unseen bag-bears." But he wore 
 a mask when it suited him, and admired himself for the ease with which he could 
 assume whatever aspect was convenient. "I can be religious and irreligious," he 
 said; "I can be anything or nothing. I can swear, and speak against swearing. I 
 can lie, and speak against lying. I can drink, wench, be unclean, and defraud, and 
 not be troubled for it. I can enjoy myself, and am master of my own ways, not they 
 of me. This I have attained with much study, care, and pains." "An Atheist Badman 
 was, if such a thing as an Atheist could be. He was not alone in that mystery. There 
 was abundance of men of the same mind and the same principle. He was only an arch 
 or chief one among them." </p>
 <p>Mr. Badman now took to speculation, which Bunyan's knowledge of business enabled 
 him to describe with instructive minuteness. His adventures were on a large scale, 
 and by some mistakes and by personal extravagance he had nearly ruined himself a 
 second time. In this condition he discovered a means, generally supposed to be a 
 more modern invention, of "getting money by hatfuls." </p>
 <p>"He gave a sudden and great rush into several men's debts to the value of four 
 or five thousand pounds, driving at the same time a very great trade by selling 
 many things for less than they cost him, to get him custom and blind his creditors' 
 eyes. When he had well feathered his nest with other men's goods and money, after 
 a little while he breaks; while he had by craft and knavery made so sure of what 
 he had that his creditors could not touch a penny. He sends mournful, sugared letters 
 to them, desiring them not to be severe with him, for he bore towards all men an 
 honest mind, and would pay them as far as he was able. He talked of the greatness 
 of the taxes, the badness of the times, his losses by bad debts, and he brought 
 them to a composition to take five shillings in the pound. His release was signed 
 and sealed, and Mr. Badman could now put his head out-of-doors again, and be a better 
 man than when he shut up shop by several thousands of pounds." </p>
 <p>Twice or three times he repeated the same trick with equal success. It is likely 
 enough that Bunyan was drawing from life, and perhaps from a member of his own congregation; 
 for he says that "he had known a professor do it." He detested nothing so much as 
 sham religion, which was put on as a pretence. "A professor," he exclaims, "and 
 practise such villanies as these! Such an one is not worthy the name. Go, professors, 
 go--leave off profession, unless you will lead your lives according to your profession. 
 Better never profess than make profession a stalking-horse to sin, deceit, the devil, 
 and hell." </p>
 <p>Bankruptcy was not the only art by which Badman piled up his fortune. The seventeenth 
 century was not so far behind us as we sometimes persuade ourselves. "He dealt by 
 deceitful weights and measures. He kept weights to buy by, and weights to sell by; 
 measures to buy by, and measures to sell by. Those he bought by were too big, and 
 those he sold by were too little. If he had to do with other men's weights and measures, 
 he could use a thing called sleight of hand. He had the art, besides, to misreckon 
 men in their accounts, whether by weight or measure or money; and if a question 
 was made of his faithful dealing, he had his servants ready that would vouch and 
 swear to his look or word. He would sell goods that cost him not the best price 
 by far, for as much as he sold his best of all for. He had also a trick to mingle 
 his commodity, that that which was bad might go off with the least mistrust. If 
 any of his customers paid him money, he would call for payment a second time, and 
 if they could not produce good and sufficient ground of the payment, a hundred to 
 one but they paid it again." </p>
 <p>"To buy in the cheapest market, and sell in the dearest," was Mr. Badman's common 
 rule in business. According to modern political economy, it is the cardinal principle 
 of wholesome trade. In Bunyan's opinion it was knavery in disguise, and certain 
 to degrade and demoralise every one who acted upon it. Bunyan had evidently </p>
 <p>thought on the subject. Mr. Attentive is made to object:-- </p>
 <p>"But you know that there is no settled price set by God upon any commodity that 
 is bought or sold under the sun; but all things that we buy and sell do ebb and 
 flow as to price, like the tide. How then shall a man of tender conscience do, neither 
 to wrong the seller, buyer, nor himself in the buying and selling of commodities?"
 </p>
 <p>Mr. Wiseman answers in the spirit of our old Acts of Parliament, before political 
 economy was invented:-- </p>
 <p>"Let a man have conscience towards God, charity to his neighbours, and moderation 
 in dealing. Let the tradesman consider that there is not that in great gettings 
 and in abundance which the most of men do suppose; for all that a man has over and 
 above what serves for his present necessity and supply serves only to feed the lusts 
 of the eye. Be thou confident that God's eyes are upon thy ways; that He marks them, 
 writes them down, and seals them up in a bag against the time to come. Be sure that 
 thou rememberest that thou knowest not the day of thy death. Thou shalt have nothing 
 that thou mayest so much as carry away in thy hand. Guilt shall go with thee if 
 thou hast gotten thy substance dishonestly, and they to whom thou shalt leave it 
 shall receive it to their hurt. These things duly considered, I will shew thee how 
 thou should'st live in the practical part of this art. Art thou to buy or sell? 
 If thou sellest, do not commend. If thou buyest, do not dispraise any otherwise 
 but to give the thing that thou hast to do with its just value and worth. Art thou 
 a seller, and do things grow cheap? set not thy hand to help or hold them up higher. 
 Art thou a buyer, and do things grow dear? use no cunning or deceitful language 
 to pull them down. Leave things to the Providence of God, and do thou with moderation 
 submit to his hand. Hurt not thy neighbour by crying out, Scarcity, scarcity! beyond 
 the truth of things. Especially take heed of doing this by way of a prognostic for 
 time to come. This wicked thing may be done by hoarding up (food) when the hunger 
 and necessity of the poor calls for it. If things rise, do thou be grieved. Be also 
 moderate in all thy sellings, and be sure let the poor have a pennyworth, and sell 
 thy corn to those who are in necessity; which thou wilt do when thou showest mercy 
 to the poor in thy selling to him, and when thou undersellest the market for his 
 sake because he is poor. This is to buy and sell with a good conscience. The buyer 
 thou wrongest not, thy conscience thou wrongest not, thyself thou wrongest not, 
 for God will surely recompense with thee." </p>
 <p>These views of Bunyan's are at issue with modern science, but his principles 
 and ours are each adjusted to the objects of desire which good men in those days, 
 and good men in ours, have respectively set before themselves. If wealth means money, 
 as it is now assumed to do, Bunyan is wrong, and modern science right. If wealth 
 means moral welfare, then those who aim at it will do well to follow Bunyan's advice. 
 It is to be feared that this part of his doctrine is less frequently dwelt upon 
 by those who profess to admire and follow him, than the theory of imputed righteousness 
 or justification by faith. </p>
 <p>Mr. Badman, by his various ingenuities, became a wealthy man. His character as 
 a tradesman could not have been a secret from his neighbours, but money and success 
 coloured it over. The world spoke well of him. He became "proud and haughty," took 
 part in public affairs, "counted himself as wise as the wisest in the country, as 
 good as the best, and as beautiful as he that had the most of it." "He took great 
 delight in praising himself, and as much in the praises that others gave him." "He 
 could not abide that any should think themselves above him, or that their wit and 
 personage should be by others set before his." He had an objection, nevertheless, 
 to being called proud, and when Mr. Attentive asked why, his companion answered 
 with a touch which reminds us of De Foe, that "Badman <i>did not tell him the reason.
 </i>He supposed it to be that which was common to all vile persons. They loved their 
 vice, but cared not to bear its name." Badman said he was unwilling to seem singular 
 and fantastical, and in this way he justified his expensive and luxurious way of 
 living. Singularity of all kinds he affected to dislike, and for that reason his 
 special pleasure was to note the faults of professors. "If he could get anything 
 by the end that had scandal in it--if it did but touch professors, however falsely 
 reported--oh, then he would glory, laugh and be glad, and lay it upon the whole 
 party. Hang these rogues, he would say, there is not a barrel better herring in 
 all the holy brotherhood of them. Like to like, quote the devil to the collier. 
 This is your precise crew, and then he would send them all home with a curse."
 </p>
 <p>Thus Bunyan developed his specimen scoundrel, till he brought him to the high 
 altitudes of worldly prosperity; skilful in every villanous art, skilful equally 
 in keeping out of the law's hands, and feared, admired, and respected by all his 
 neighbours. The reader who desires to see Providence vindicated would now expect 
 to find him detected in some crimes by which justice could lay hold, and poetical 
 retribution fall upon him in the midst of his triumph. An inferior artist would 
 certainly have allowed his story to end in this way. But Bunyan, satisfied though 
 he was that dramatic judgments did overtake offenders in this world with direct 
 and startling appropriateness, was yet aware that it was often otherwise, and that 
 the worst fate which could be inflicted on a completely worthless person was to 
 allow him to work out his career unvisited by any penalties which might have disturbed 
 his conscience and occasioned his amendment. He chose to make his story natural, 
 and to confine himself to natural machinery. The judgment to come Mr. Badman laughed 
 at "as old woman's fable," but his courage lasted only as long as he was well and 
 strong. One night, as he was riding home drunk, his horse fell, and he broke his 
 leg. "You would not think," says Mr. Wiseman, "how he swore at first. Then, coining 
 to himself, and finding he was badly hurt, he cried out, after the manner of such, 
 Lord, help me! Lord, have mercy on me! good God, deliver me! and the like. He was 
 picked up and taken home, where he lay some time. In his pain he called on God; 
 but whether it was that his sin might be pardoned, and his soul saved, or whether 
 to be rid of his pain," Mr. Wiseman "could not determine." This leads to several 
 stories of drunkards which Bunyan clearly believed to be literally true. Such facts 
 or legends were the food on which his mind had been nourished. They were in the 
 air which contemporary England breathed. </p>
 <p>"I have read, in Mr. Clarke's <i>Looking-glass for Sinners, </i>Mr. Wiseman said, 
 "that upon a time a certain drunken fellow boasted in his cups that there was neither 
 heaven nor hell. Also, he said he believed that man had no soul, and that for his 
 own part he would sell his soul to any that would buy it. Then did one of his companions 
 buy it of him for a cup of wine, and presently the devil, in man's shape, bought 
 it of that man again at the same price; and so, in the presence of them all, laid 
 hold of the soul-seller, and carried him away through the air, so that he was no 
 more heard of." </p>
 <p>Again: </p>
 <p>"There was one at Salisbury drinking and carousing at a tavern, and he drank 
 a health to the devil, saying that if the devil would not come and pledge him, he 
 could not believe that there was either God or devil. Whereupon his companions, 
 stricken with fear, hastened out of the room; and presently after, hearing a hideous 
 noise and smelling a stinking savour, the vintner ran into the chamber, and coming 
 in he missed his guest, and found the window broken, the iron bars in it bowed and 
 all bloody, but the man was never heard of afterwards." </p>
 <p>These visitations were answers to a direct challenge of the evil spirit's existence, 
 and were thus easy to be accounted for. But no devil came for Mr. Badman. He clung 
 to his unfortunate, neglected wife. "She became his dear wife, his godly wife, his 
 honest wife, his duck, his dear and all." He thought he was dying, and hell and 
 all its horrors rose up before him. "Fear was in his face, and in his tossings to 
 and fro he would often say, I am undone, I am undone; my vile life hath undone me!" 
 Atheism did not help him. It never helped anyone in such extremities, Mr. Wiseman 
 said, as he had known in another instance: -- </p>
 <p>"There was a man dwelt about twelve miles off from us," he said, "that had so 
 trained up himself in his Atheistical notions, that at last he attempted to write 
 a book against Jesus Christ and the Divine authority of the Scriptures. I think 
 it was not printed. Well, after many days God struck him with sickness, whereof 
 he died. So, being sick, and musing of his former doings, the book that be had written 
 tore his conscience as a lion would tear a kid. Some of my friends went to see him; 
 and as they were in his chamber one day, he hastily called for pen and ink and paper, 
 which, when it was given to him, he took it and writ to this purpose: "I, such an 
 one in such a town, must go to hell-fire for writing a book against Jesus Christ." 
 He would have leaped out of the window to have killed himself, but was by them prevented 
 of that, so he died in his bed by such a death as it was." </p>
 <p>Badman seemed equally miserable. But death-bed repentances, as Bunyan sensibly 
 said, were seldom of more value than "the howling of a dog." The broken leg was 
 set again. The pain of body went, and with it the pain of mind. "He was assisted 
 out of his uneasiness," says Bunyan, with a characteristic hit at the scientific 
 views then coming into fashion, "by his doctor," who told him that his alarms had 
 come "from an affection of the brain, caused by want of sleep;" "they were nothing 
 but vapours and the effects of his distemper." He gathered his spirits together, 
 and became the old man once more. His poor wife, who had believed him penitent, 
 broke her heart, and died of the disappointment. The husband gave himself up to 
 loose connections with abandoned women, one of whom persuaded him one day, when 
 he was drunk, to make her a promise of marriage, and she held him to his word. Then 
 retribution came upon him, with the coarse commonplace, yet rigid justice which 
 fact really deals out. The second bad wife avenged the wrongs of the first innocent 
 wife. He was mated with a companion "who could fit him with cursing and swearing, 
 give him oath for oath, and curse for curse. They would fight, and fly at each other 
 like cat and dog." In this condition-- for Bunyan, before sending his hero to his 
 account, gave him a protracted spell of earthly discomforts--they lived sixteen 
 years together. Fortune, who had so long favoured his speculations, turned her back 
 upon him. Between them they "sinned all his wealth away," and at last parted "as 
 poor as howlets." </p>
 <p>Then came the end. Badman was still in middle life, and had naturally a powerful 
 constitution; but his "cups and his queans" had undermined his strength. Dropsy 
 came, and gout, with worse in his bowels, and "on the top of them all, as the captain 
 of the men of death that came to take him away," consumption. Bunyan was a true 
 artist, though he knew nothing of the rules, and was not aware that he was an artist 
 at all. He was not to be tempted into spoiling a natural story with the melodramatic 
 horrors of a sinner's death-bed. He had let his victim "howl" in the usual way, 
 when he meant him to recover. He had now simply to conduct him to the gate of the 
 place where he was to receive the reward of his iniquities. It was enough to bring 
 him thither still impenitent, with the grave solemnity with which a felon is taken 
 to execution. </p>
 <p>"As his life was full of sin," says Mr. Wiseman, "so his death was without repentance. 
 He had not, in all the time of his sickness, a sight and a sense of his sins; but 
 was as much at quiet as if he had never sinned in his life; he was as secure as 
 if he had been sinless as an angel. When he drew near his end, there was no more 
 alteration in him than what was made by his disease upon his body. He was the self-same 
 Mr. Badman still, not only in name but in condition, and that to the very day of 
 his death and the moment in which he died. There seemed not to be in it to the standers-by 
 so much as a strong struggle of nature. He died like a lamb, or, as men call it, 
 like a chrisom child, quietly and without fear." </p>
 <p>To which end of Mr. Badman Bunyan attaches the following remarks: "If a wicked 
 man, if a man who has lived all his days in notorious sin, dies quietly, his quiet 
 dying is so far from being a sign of his being saved that it is an incontestable 
 proof of his damnation. No man can be saved except he repents; nor can he repent 
 that knows not that he is a sinner: and he that knows himself to be a sinner will, 
 I warrant him, be molested for his knowledge before he can die quietly. I am no 
 admirer of sick-bed repentance; for I think verily it is seldom good for anything. 
 But I see that he that hath lived in sin and pro-faneness all his days, as Badman 
 did, and yet shall die quietly--that is, without repentance steps in between his 
 life and his death--is assuredly gone to hell. When God would show the greatness 
 of his anger against sin and sinners in one word, He saith, Let them alone! Let 
 them alone--that is, disturb them not. Let them go on without control. Let the devil 
 enjoy them peaceably. Let him carry them out of the world, unconverted, quietly. 
 This is the sorest of judgments. I do not say that all wicked men that are molested 
 at their death with a sense of sin and fear of hell do therefore go to heaven; for 
 some are made to see and are left to despair. But I<i> </i>say there is no surer 
 sign of a man's damnation than to die quietly after a sinful life--than to sin and 
 die with a heart that cannot repent. The opinion, therefore, of the common people 
 of this kind of death is frivolous and vain." </p>
 <p>So ends this very remarkable story. It is extremely interesting, merely as a 
 picture of vulgar English life in a provincial town, such as Bedford was when Bunyan 
 lived there. The drawing is so good, the details so minute, the conception so unexaggerated, 
 that we are disposed to believe that we must have a real history before us. But 
 such a supposition is only a compliment to the skill of the composer. Bunyan's inventive 
 faculty was a spring that never ran dry. He had a manner, as I said, like De Foe's, 
 of creating the allusion that we are reading realities, by little touches such as 
 "I do not know;" "He did not tell me this;" or the needless introduction of particulars 
 irrelevant to the general plot such as we always stumble on in life, and writers 
 of fiction usually omit. Bunyan was never prosecuted for libel by Badman's relations, 
 and the character is the corresponding contrast to Christian in <i>The Pilgrim's 
 Progress, </i>the pilgrim's journey being in the opposite direction to the other 
 place. Throughout we are on the solid earth, amidst real experiences. No demand 
 is made on our credulity by Providential interpositions, except in the intercalated 
 anecdotes which do not touch the story itself. The wicked man's career is not brought 
 to the abrupt or sensational issues so much in favour with ordinary didactic tale-writers. 
 Such issues are the exception, not the rule, and the edifying story loses its effect 
 when the reader turns from it to actual life, and perceives that the majority are 
 not punished in any such way. Bunyan conceals nothing, assumes nothing, and exaggerates 
 nothing. He makes his bad man sharp and shrewd. He allows sharpness and shrewdness 
 to bring him the rewards which such qualities in fact command. Badman is successful, 
 he is powerful; he enjoys all the pleasures which money can buy; his bad wife helps 
 him to ruin, but otherwise he is not unhappy, and he dies in peace. Bunyan has made 
 him a brute, because such men do become brutes. It is the real punishment of brutal 
 and selfish habits. There the figure stands: a picture of a man in the rank of English 
 life with which Bunyan was most familiar, travelling along the primrose path to 
 the everlasting bonfire, as the way to Emmanuel's Land was through the Slough of 
 Despond and the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Pleasures are to be found among the 
 primroses, such pleasures as a brute can be gratified by. Yet the reader feels that, 
 even if there was no bonfire, he would still prefer to be with Christian. </p>
