 <p>Inquire not into that which is too difficult for thee;<br> and that which is concealed from thee search not out.<br> Attend to that which is permitted to thee:<br> thou hast no business with hidden things.</p>

 <p align="center"><font size="-1">J. T. Ḥaghigah, ii. (fol. 77<sup>c</sup>).</font></p>  
 <p>That which is too difficult for thee, why shouldest thou know?<br> that which is deeper than Sheol, why shouldest thou search out?<br> Attend to that which is permitted to thee:<br> thou hast no business with hidden things.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>c</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">B. T. Ḥaghigah, fol. 130.</font></p>  
 <p>Inquire not into that which is too great for thee;<br> and that which is too hard for thee, search not out.<br> That which is too difficult for thee do not know;<br> and that which is concealed from thee do not ask.<br> Attend to that which is permitted to thee;<br> thou hast no business with hidden things.</p>  
 <p align="center">II.</p>

 <p>And be not confident of pardon,<br> to add iniquity to iniquity,<br> or say, His mercies are great,<br> he will pardon the multitude of my iniquities;<br> for mercy and wrath are with him,<br> and his might resteth upon the wicked.</p>  
 <p align="center">V.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Sir. 5, 7. B. T. Shabbath, fol. 183<sup>a</sup>.</font></p>

 <p>Let those that are at peace with thee be many,<br> but reveal thy secret to one of a thousand<br> [keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom].</p>  
 <p align="center">VIII.</p>

 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Sir. 6, 13.<br> S<sup>e</sup>adyah, p. 178, 1. 8.</font></p>

 <p>Ben Sira said the proverb: Do not good to the evil, and evil will not befall thee.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">See Schechter, <i>J. Q. R. </i>iii. p. 694, No. 17 and note.</font></p>  
 <p align="center">XI.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Sir. 7, 10.<br> B. T. Erubin, fol. 65<sup>a</sup>.</font></p>  
 <p>Text has ‏יורה‎ 'to teach.' Rashi (Solomon of Troyes) says: I have searched to find this verse in the Hagiographa, but did not succeed. Perhaps it is in Sirach.</p>  
 <p>Rab said: Let not a man pray whose mind is not at rest within him, because it is said: In adversity who shall give thanks?</p>  
 <p><font size="-1">Perhaps a reminiscence of Ps. 6, 6.</font></p>  
 <p align="center">XII.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Sir. 7, 17.<br> Aboth, iv. 7. Cf. No. LVI below.</font></p>

 <p>Rab said: Even the ordinary conversation of the wise requires learning.</p>  
 <p align="center">XV.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Sir. 8, 18.<br> B. T. Pesahim, fol. 49<sup>b</sup>.</font></p>  
 <p>Six things are said of the people of the land (the unlearned) . . .; and they reveal not to him a secret.</p>  
 <p align="center">XVI.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Sir. 9, 8.<br> B. T. Synhedrin, fol. 100<sup>b</sup>; Yebamoth, fol. 63<sup>b</sup>.<br> So Rashi (ap. Schechter, ibid., p. 100, note 36), ed.</font></p>  
 <p>Hide thine eyes from a comely woman,<br> lest thou be caught in her snares;<br> turn not aside to her, to mingle wine and strong drink with her:<br> for through the beauty of a fair woman many have been destroyed,<br> and 'all her slain are a mighty host' (Prov. 7, 26).</p>

 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Sir. 11, 1.<br> So in J. T. Berakhoth, vii. 2, and in Midrashim: the B. T. Berakhoth, fol. 48<sup>a</sup>, quotes Proverbs 4, 8, entire, omitting the last three words of the saying. See Reifmann's essay on Ben Sira in rpm iii. p. 248, 3.</font></p>  
 <p>In the book of Ben Sira it is written:<br> Exalt her and she shall lift thee up (Prov. 4, 8), and set thee among princes.</p>  
 <p align="center">XVIII.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Sir. 11, 8.<br> Aboth, v. 10.</font></p>

 <p align="center">XXII.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Sir. 13, 2.<br> Aboth, ii. 3.</font></p>  
 <p>Be cautious with (those in) authority,<br> for they let not a man approach them but for their own purposes;<br> and they appear like friends when it is to their advantage,<br> and stand not by a man in the hour of his need.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Monatsschrift, 1865, p. 186, note 8.</font></p>

 <p>Every one who needs to receive (alms) and refuses to take them, is (like) a shedder of blood, and it is forbidden to have compassion on him. If he has no pity on himself, how much less will he have pity on others?</p>  
 <p align="center">XXVII.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Sir. 14 11.<br> B. T. Erubin, fol. 54</font></p>  
 <p>Rab said to his son Hamnuna:</p>  
 <p>My son, if thou hast aught, do good unto thyself,<br> for there is no pleasure in Sheol, and death tarries not.<br> And if thou sayest, It is for my sons and for my daughters,<br> who shall declare to thee the law in Sheol?<br> The sons of men are like the herbs of the field,<br> some flourish, and others fade.</p>

 <p>Say not, I am hidden from God,<br> and in the height who shall remember me?<br> Among a numerous people I shall not be known,<br> or what is my soul among the multitude of spirits?</p>

 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Cf. Sir. 18, 16, &amp;c.<br> B. T. Baba Bathra, fol. 95.</font></p>

 <p>By three things a man is known, by his purse, by the wine-cup, and by his vexation. They say to him: By his laughter also.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Compare Aboth N., p. 86<sup>a</sup>:</font></p>  
 <p>By three things do men test a man,<br> by trading (<i>lit</i>. giving and taking), and by much wine, and by much talking.</p>

 <p>Let a man never hasten into the house of his neighbour; for thus it is written in the book of Ben Sira:</p>  
 <p>The foot of a senseless man hastens to (another's) house,<br> but a prudent man will subdue many.</p>  
 <p>Let a man never look in at the door of his neighbour; for thus (it is written) in the book of Ben Sira:</p>  
 <p>A foolish man gazes from the door into (another's) house,<br> but a man's honour is in the house of his own kinsmen.</p>  
 <p align="center">XXXVII.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Sir. 25, 2.<br> B. T. Pesahim, fol. 113b.</font></p>  
 <p>There are four things that the mind cannot bear.<br> They are these:</p>  
 <p>A poor man that is proud, a rich man that is a liar,<br> an old man that is an adulterer,<br> and a ruler that exalts himself above the multitude.</p>

 <p>Be not troubled for the trouble of the morrow,<br> for 'thou knowest not what a day may bring forth' (Prov. 27, 1).<br> Perhaps on the morrow he will be no more,<br> and be found grieving over a world that is not his.</p>

 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Sir. 30 (33), 33.<br> B. T. Baba Metsia, fol. 65<sup>a</sup>.</font></p>

 <p>As it is written in the book of Ben Sira:<br> I have weighed all things in the balance,<br> and have found nothing lighter than bran;<br> but lighter than bran is the bridegroom who dwells in the house of his father-in-law,<br> and lighter than the bridegroom is a guest (<i>lit</i>. traveller) who introduces another guest,<br> and lighter than the guest is 'he that giveth answer before he heareth' (Prov. 18, 13).</p>

 <p>It is written in the book of Ben Sira:<br> Remember the day of thy being gathered (in death);<br> withdraw (<i>lit</i>. gather in) reproach and acquire virtue (lit. merits);<br> for in the day of a man's being gathered, <a name="page_xxviii"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xxviii</font></a><br> neither riches nor great strength accompany him;<br> for his work is prepared, it will go before him,<br> and his righteousness shall lighten his eyes.</p>

 <p>It is explained in the book of Ben Sira, that the Holy One (blessed be he!) is called 'place <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">1</font></a>,' because he is the place of (i.e. contains) the world, and the world is not his place.</p>
