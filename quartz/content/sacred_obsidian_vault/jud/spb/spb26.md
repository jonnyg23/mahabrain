 <p><i>The following Prayer (Hallel) is said on New Moon, on Passover, Pentecost and Tabernacles, and on Chanukah</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>On the Intermediate Days of Festivals the Tephillin are removed before Hallel; on New Moon, before the Additional Service</i>.</p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast commanded us to read the Hallel.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxiii.</p>  
 <p>Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord. Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for evermore. From the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof the Lord's name is to be praised. The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. Who is like unto the Lord our God, that dwelleth so high; that looketh down so low upon the heavens and the earth? He raiseth up the lowly out of the dust, and lifteth up the needy from the dunghill; that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. He maketh the barren woman dwell in her house as a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the Lord.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxiv.</p>  
 <p>When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. The sea saw it, and fled; Jordan turned back. The mountains</p>  
 <p><a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="green">p. 314</font></a></p>  
 <p>skipped like rams, the hills like lambs. What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? thou Jordan, that thou turnest back? Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams? Ye hills, like lambs? At the presence of the Lord tremble, O earth, at the presence of the God of Jacob; who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>On New Moon and the last Six Days of Passover omit the following paragraph:—</i></p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxv.</p>  
 <p>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy lovingkindness and for the truth's sake. Wherefore should the nations say, Where, then, is their God? But our God is in the heavens, he doeth whatsoever he pleaseth. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not. They have ears, but they hear not; noses have they, but they smell not. As for their hands, they touch not; as for their feet, they walk not; they give no sound through their throat. They that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them. O Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their help and their shield. O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield. Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_315"><font size="1" color="green">p. 315</font></a></p>  
 <p>The Lord hath been mindful of us; he will bless, he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. He will bless them that fear the Lord both small and great. May the Lord increase you, you and your children. Blessed are ye of the Lord, why, made heaven and earth. The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; but the earth hath he given to the children of men. The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence; but we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye the Lord.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>On New Moon and the Iasi Sir Days of Passover omit the following paragraph:—</i></p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxvi.</p>  
 <p>I love the Lord, because he heareth my voice and my supplications. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. The cords of death had encompassed me, and the straits of the grave had come upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. Then I called upon the name of the Lord: O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. Gracious is the Lord and righteous: yea, our God is merciful. The Lord guardeth the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me. Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, my feet from falling. I shall walk before the Lord in the land of the living. I kept my faith in God ever when I spake, I am greatly afflicted; even when I said in my haste, All men are liars.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="green">p. 316</font></a></p>  
 <p>What can I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I will lift the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord, yea, in the presence of all his people. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his loving ones. Ah, Lord, truly I am thy servant: I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid; thou hast loosed my bonds. I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord, yea, in the presence of all his people; in the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxvii.</p>  
 <p>O praise the Lord, all ye nations; laud him, all ye peoples. For his lovingkindness is mighty over us; and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever. Praise ye the Lord.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>The following verses are chanted by the Reader, the Congregation at the end of each verse repeating, "O give thanks," etc., to "ever."</i></p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxviii.</p>  
 <p>O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.</p>  
 <p>O let Israel say, that his lovingkindness endureth for ever.</p>  
 <p>O let the house of Aaron say, that his lovingkindness endureth for ever.</p>  
 <p>O let them that fear the Lord say, that his lovingkindness endureth for ever.</p>  
 <p>Out of my straitness I called upon the Lord: the Lord answered me with enlargement. The Lord is for me, I will not fear: what can man do unto me? The Lord is for me among them that help me; therefore shall I see my desire on them that hate me. It is better to trust in the Lord than to confide in man.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="green">p. 317</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> It is better to trust in the Lord than to confide in princes. All nations compassed me about: in the name of the Lord I surely cut them down. They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: in the name of the Lord I surely cut them down. They compassed me about like bees;—they were extinguished as a fire of thorns:—in the name of the Lord I surely cut them down. Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the Lord helped me. The Lord is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation. The voice of exulting and salvation is in the tents of the righteous: the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly. The right hand of the Lord is exalted: the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly. I shall not die, but live, and recount the works of the Lord. The Lord hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto the Lord. This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous may enter into it.</p>  
 <p>I will give thanks unto thee, for thou hast answered me, and art become my salvation.</p>

 <p>The stone which the builders rejected is become the head-stone of the corner.</p>  
 <p>This was the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.</p>  
 <p>This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will be glad and rejoice thereon.</p>

 <p align="center"><i>Repeat this and the next three verses</i>.</p>  
 <p>The Lord is God, he hath given us light: bind the festal offering with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.</p>  
 <p>Thou art my God, and I will give thanks unto thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.</p>  
 <p>O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.</p>  
 <p>All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord our God, and thy pious ones, the just who do thy will, together with all thy people, the house of Israel, shall with exultation thank, bless, praise, glorify, exalt, reverence, sanctify and ascribe sovereignty unto thy name, O our King; for it is good to give thanks unto thee, and becoming to sing praises unto thy name, because from everlasting to everlasting thou art God. Blessed art thou, O Lord, a King extolled with praises.</p>
