 <p align="center"><i>Before reading the Book of Esther the following Blessings are said:—</i></p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast given us command concerning the reading of the Megillah.</p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who wroughtest miracles for our fathers in days of old, at this season.</p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast kept us in life, and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>After reading the Book of Esther say:—</i></p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who dost plead our cause, judge our suit and avenge our wrong, who renderest retribution to all that hate our soul, and on our behalf dealest out punishment to our adversaries. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who on behalf of thy people Israel dealest out punishment to all their adversaries, O God, the Savior.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>The following paragraph is omitted after the Reading of the Book of Esther in the morning:—</i></p>  
 <p>—Who broughtest the counsel of the heathen to nought, and madest the devices of the crafty of none effect, when a wicked man, an arrogant offshoot of the seed of Amalek, rose up against us. Insolent in his riches, he digged himself a pit, and his own greatness laid him a snare. In his mind he thought to entrap, but was himself entrapped, he sought to destroy, but was speedily destroyed. Haman displayed the hatred of his fathers, and stirred up against the children the ancient enmity of the brothers (Esau and Jacob), remembering not the mercy of Saul, through whose compassion for Agag the enemy was born. The wicked plotted to cut off the just, and the unclean was caught in the hands of the pure. (Mordecai's)</p>  
 <p><a name="page_423"><font size="1" color="green">p. 423</font></a></p>  
 <p>lovingkindness (to Esther) prevailed over the father's (Saul's) error, but the wicked (Haman) heaped sin upon the sins of his ancestor. In his heart he hid his cunning devices, and sold himself to do wickedness. He stretched forth his hand against God's saints; he gave his silver to cut off the remembrance of them. When Mordecai saw that wrath had gone forth, and that the decrees of Haman were issued in Shushan, lie put on sackcloth and wrapped himself in mourning, ordained a fast and sat upon ashes. Who will rise up to atone for error, and obtain pardon for the sin rind iniquity of our fathers? A flower blossomed from the palm tree: lo! Hadassah arose to awaken the merit of those that slept in the grave. Her servants hastened to make Haman drink the wine of the poison of snakes. He rose by his riches, but fell in his wickedness; he made him a gallows, and was himself hanged thereon. All the inhabitants of the world opened their mouths, for the lot of Haman was turned to be our lot. When the righteous was delivered out of the hand of the wicked, and the enemy was put in his stead, the Jews ordained for themselves to celebrate Purim, and to rejoice thereon every year. Thou didst regard the prayer of Mordecai and Esther: Haman and his sons thou didst hang upon the gallows.</p>  
 <p>The lily of Jacob rejoiced and was glad when Mordecai was seen in the purple. Thou hast ever been Israel's salvation, and their hope in every generation, to make known that all who hope in thee shall not be ashamed, neither shall any be confounded who put their trust in thee. Accursed be Haman who sought to destroy me; blessed be Mordecai the Jew; accursed be Zeresh, the wife of him that terrified me; blessed be Esther my protectress, and may Harbonah also be remembered for good.</p>
