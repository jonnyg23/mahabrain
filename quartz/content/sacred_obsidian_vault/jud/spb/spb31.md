 <p>O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise.</p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the great, mighty and revered God, the most high God, who bestowest lovingkindnesses and possessest all things who rememberest the pious deeds of the patriarchs, and in love wilt bring a redeemer to their children's children for thy name's sake.</p>  
 <p>O King, Helper, Savior and Shield. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the Shield of Abraham.</p>  
 <p>Thou, O Lord, art mighty for ever, thou quickenest the dead, thou art mighty to save.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>From the Sabbath after the Eighth Day of Solemn Assembly until the First Day of Passover say:—</i></p>  
 <p>Thou causest the wind to blow and the rain to fall.</p>  
 <p>Thou sustainest the living with lovingkindness, quickenest the dead with great mercy, supportest the falling, healest the sick, loosest the bound, and keepest thy faith to them that sleep in the dust. Who is like unto thee, Lord of mighty acts, and who resembleth thee, O King, who killest and quickenest, and causest salvation to spring forth? Yea, faithful art thou to</p>

 <p>Thou art holy, and thy name is holy, and holy beings praise thee daily. (Selah.) Blessed art thou, O Lord, the holy God.</p>

 <p>* <i>Reader</i>.—We will reverence and sanctify thee according to the mystic utterance of the Holy Seraphim, who hallow thy name in the sanctuary, as it is written by the hand of thy prophet, And they called one unto the other and said,</p>  
 <p><i>Cong</i>.—Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</p>  
 <p><i>Reader</i>.—His glory filleth the universe: his ministering angels ask one another, Where is the place of his glory? Those over against them say, Blessed—</p>  
 <p><i>Cong</i>.—Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place.</p>  
 <p><i>Reader</i>.—From his place may he turn in mercy and be gracious unto a people who, evening and morning, twice every day, proclaim with constancy the unity of his name, saying in love, Hear—</p>  
 <p><i>Cong</i>.—Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One.</p>  
 <p><i>Reader</i>.—One is Our God; he is our Father; he is our King, he is our Savior; and he of his mercy will let us hear a second time, in the presence of all living (his promise), "To be to you for a God."</p>

 <p><i>Reader</i>.—Unto all generations we will declare thy greatness, and to all eternity we will proclaim thy holiness, and thy praise, O our God, shall not depart front our mouth for ever, for thou art a great and holy God and King. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the holy God.</p>  
 <p>Thou hast chosen us from all peoples; thou hast, loved us and taken pleasure in us, and hast exalted us above all tongues; thou hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and brought us near unto thy service, O our King, and hast called us by thy great and holy name.</p>

 <p>But on account of our sins we were exiled from our land, and removed far from our country, and we are unable to go up in order to appear and prostrate ourselves before thee, and to fulfil our obligations in thy chosen house, that great and holy temple which was called by thy name, because of the hand that hath been stretched out against thy sanctuary. May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, merciful King, that thou mayest again in thine abundant compassion have mercy upon us and upon thy sanctuary, and mayest speedily rebuild it and magnify its glory. Our Father, our King, do thou speedily make the glory of thy kingdom manifest upon us; shine forth and exalt thyself upon us in the sight of all living; bring our scattered ones among the nations near unto thee, and gather our dispersed from the ends of the earth. Lead us with exultation unto Zion thy city, and unto Jerusalem the place of thy sanctuary with everlasting joy; and there we will prepare before thee the offerings that are obligatory for us, the continual offerings according to their order, and the additional offerings according to their enactment; and the additional offering of [this Sabbath day with the additional offering of] this</p>

 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord, who blessest thy people Israel with peace.</p>  
 <p>O my God! guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile; and to such as curse me let my soul be dumb, yea, let my soul be unto all as the dust. Open my heart to thy Law, and let my soul pursue thy commandments. If any design evil against me, speedily make their counsel of none effect, and frustrate their designs. Do it for the sake of thy name, do it for the sake of thy right hand, do it for the sake of thy holiness, do it for the sake of thy Law.
