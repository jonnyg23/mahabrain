 <p> <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">*</font></a> Thou didst institute the Sabbath, and didst accept its offerings; thou didst command its special obligations with the order of its drink offerings. They that find delight in it shall inherit glory for everlasting; they that taste it are worthy of life; while such as love its teachings have chosen true greatness. Already from Sinai they were commanded concerning it; and thou hast also commanded us, O Lord our God,</p>

 <p><a name="page_231"><font size="1" color="green">p. 231</font></a></p>  
 <p>will, as thou hast prescribed for us in thy Law through the hand of Moses thy servant, by the mouth of thy glory, as it is said:</p>  
 <p>And on the Sabbath day two he-lambs of the first year, without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof: this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering and the drink offering thereof.</p>

 <p>shall be satiated and delighted with thy goodness, seeing that thou didst find pleasure in the seventh day. and didst hallow it; thou didst call it the desirable of days, in remembrance of the creation.</p>  
 <p>Our God and God of our fathers, accept our rest; sanctify us by thy commandments, and grant our portion in thy Law; satisfy us with thy goodness, and gladden us with thy salvation; purify our hearts to serve thee in truth; and in thy love and favor, O Lord our God, let</p>

 <p>Accept, O Lord our God, thy people Israel and their prayer; restore the service to the oracle of thy house; receive in love and favor both the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer; and may the service of thy people Israel be ever acceptable unto thee.</p>  
 <p>And let our eyes behold thy return in mercy to Zion. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who restorest thy divine presence unto Zion.</p>

 <p align="center">Talmud Babli: Treatise Cerithoth 6, a.</p>  
 <p>The compound forming the incense <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">*</font></a> consisted of balm, onycha, galbanum and frankincense, in quantities weighing seventy manehs each; of myrrh, cassia, spikenard and saffron, each sixteen manehs by weight; of costus twelve, of aromatic bark three, and of cinnamon nine manehs; of lye obtained from a species of leek, nine kabs; of Cyprus wine three seahs and three kabs: though, if Cyprus wine was not procurable, old white wine might be used; of salt of Sodom the fourth part of a kab, and of the herb Maaleh Ashan a minute quantity. R. Nathan says, a minute quantity was also required of the odoriferous herb Cippath, that grew on the banks of the Jordan; if, however, one added honey to the mixture, he rendered the incense unfit for sacred use, while he who, in preparing it, omitted one of its necessary ingredients, was liable to the penalty of death. Rabban Simeon, son of Gamaliel, says, the balm is a resin that exudes from the wood of the balsam tree. The lye obtained from a species of leek was rubbed over the onycha to improve it, while the Cyprus wine was used to steep it in, so that its odor might be more pungent.</p>

 <p>R. Eleazer said in the name of R.

Read not here <i>banayich</i>, thy children (or disciples), but <i>bonayich</i>, thy builders.—Great peace have they who love thy Law; and there is no stumbling for them. Peace be within thy rampart, prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions’ sake, I would fain speak peace concerning thee. For the sake of the house of the Lord our God I would seek thy good. The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.</p>  
 <p>It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, to ascribe greatness to him who formed the world in the beginning, since he hath not made us like the nations of other lands, and hath not placed us</p>  
 <p><a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="green">p. 241</font></a></p>  
 <p>like other families of the earth, since he hath not assigned unto us a portion as unto them, nor a lot as unto all their multitude. For we bend the knee and offer worship and thanks before the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, who stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, the seat of whose glory is in the heavens above, and the abode of whose might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God; there is none else: in truth he is our King; there is none besides him; as it is written in his Law, And thou shalt know this day, and lay it to thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.</p>  
 <p>We therefore hope in thee, O Lord our God, that we may speedily behold the glory of thy might, when thou wilt remove the abominations from the earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty, and all the children of flesh will call upon thy name, when thou wilt turn unto thyself all the wicked of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know that unto thee every knee must bow, every tongue must swear. Before thee, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall; and unto thy glorious name let them give honor; let them all accept the yoke of thy kingdom, and do thou reign over them speedily, and for ever and ever. For the kingdom is thine, and to all eternity thou wilt reign in glom; as it is written in thy Law, The Lord shall reign for ever</p>  
 <p><a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="green">p. 242</font></a></p>

 <p align="center">UNITY HYMN FOR THE SABBATH DAY</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>In some Congregations the following is said before "Blessed be he who spake," <a href="spb05.htm#page_19">p. 19</a></i>.</p>  
 <p>Of old thou didst rest on the seventh day; thou didst therefore bless the Sabbath.</p>  
 <p>For every work of thine praise is prepared for thee; thy loving ones bless thee at all times.</p>  
 <p>Blessed be the Lord, the Maker of them all, the living God and everlasting King.</p>  
 <p>For from of old there hath rested upon thy servants the abundance of thy mercies and thy loving kindnesses.</p>  
 <p>But in Egypt thou didst begin to make known that thou art exalted far.</p>  
 <p>Above all gods, when thou didst execute great judgment: upon the Egyptians and upon their gods.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="green">p. 244</font></a></p>  
 <p>When thou didst cleave the Red Sea, thy people saw thy great hand, and they feared.</p>  
 <p>Thou didst guide thy people, so that thou mightest make unto thyself a name of glory to manifest thy greatness.</p>  
 <p>Thou spakest also with them from the heavens, when the clouds dropped water.</p>  
 <p>Thou knewest their wanderings in the wilderness, in a land of drought, where none passed through.</p>  
 <p>Thou gavest to thy people the corn of heaven, flesh abundant as the dust, and water from the rock.</p>  
 <p>Thou didst drive out many nations, and they took possession of their land and of the labor of the peoples;</p>  
 <p>That they might observe thy statutes and laws, the words of the Lord, which are pure words.</p>  
 <p>And they delighted themselves with fat pastures, and with rivers of oil from the flinty rock.</p>  
 <p>When they rested, they built thy holy city, and adorned the house of thy sanctuary.</p>  
 <p>Then thou saidst, Here will I dwell for length of days: I will surely bless her provision.</p>  
 <p>There they shall sacrifice sacrifices of righteousness; thy priests also shall be clothed with righteousness.</p>  
 <p>The house of Levi also shall chant pleasant songs; they shall shout for joy and sing unto thee.</p>  
 <p>The house of Israel and they that fear the Lord shall give glory and thanks unto thy name, O Lord.</p>  
 <p>Thou hast dealt out exceeding kindness to the earliest ages; deal thus kindly also with the latest.</p>  
 <p>O Lord, rejoice over us, even as thou didst rejoice over out fathers,</p>  
 <p>To multiply us and deal kindly with us; and we will for ever give thanks unto thee for thy goodness.</p>  
 <p>O Lord, rebuild thy city speedily, for it is called by thy name.</p>  
 <p>And make the horn of David to flourish therein, and dwell in the midst thereof for ever, O Lord.</p>  
 <p>There we will offer sacrifices of righteousness, and there may our oblation be pleasant as in former days.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="green">p. 245</font></a></p>  
 <p>bless thy people with the light of thy countenance; for they desire to do thy will.</p>  
 <p>And in thy good will fulfil our desire; look, we beseech thee, we are thy people, all of us.</p>  
 <p>Thou hast chosen us to be unto thee a treasured people: let thy blessing be upon thy people for ever.</p>  
 <p>And we will continually declare thy praise, and praise thy glorious name.</p>  
 <p>Of thy blessing let thy people be blessed, for every one whom thou blessest is blessed.</p>  
 <p>As for me, while I have my being, I will praise my Creator, and I will bless him all the days of my appointed time.</p>  
 <p>Let the name of the Lord be blessed for ever, from everlasting even to everlasting.</p>  
 <p>As it is written: Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the Lord. Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his. And it is said: Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said, Stand up and bless the Lord your God from everlasting to everlasting: and let them bless thy glorious name, that is exalted above all blessing and praise. And it is said: Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen: praise ye the Lord. And it is said, And David blessed the Lord in the presence of all the congregation: and David said, blessed art thou, O Lord, the God of Israel our father, from everlasting to everlasting.</p>

But because we sinned against thee, both we and our fathers, our city hath been laid waste, our sanctuary is desolate, our splendor hath gone into exile, and the glory hath been removed from the <a name="page_230"><font size="1" color="green">p. 230</font></a> house of our life, so that we are not able to perform our obligations in thy chosen house, in that great and holy house which was called by thy name, because of the hand that hath been stretched out against thy sanctuary. May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, to lead us up in joy unto our land, and to plant us within our borders, where we will prepare unto thee the offerings that are obligatory for us, the continual offerings according to their order, and the additional offerings according to their enactment; and the additional offerings of this Sabbath day and of this New Moon we will prepare and offer up unto thee in love, according to the precept of thy will, as thou hast <a name="page_231"><font size="1" color="green">p. 231</font></a> prescribed for us in thy Law through the hand of Moses thy servant, by the mouth of thy glory, as it is said: And on the Sabbath day two he-lambs of the first year without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof: this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering and the drink offering thereof.</p>  
 <p>And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the Lord; two young bullocks and one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year without blemish. And their meal offering and their drink offerings as hath been ordained, three tenth parts of an ephah for each bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram, and one tenth part for each lamb, with wine according to the drink offering thereof, and a he-goat wherewith to make atonement, and the two continual offerings according to their enactment. <a name="page_232"><font size="1" color="green">p. 232</font></a></p>  
 <p>They that keep the Sabbath and call it a delight shall rejoice in thy kingdom; the people that hallow the seventh day, even all of them shall be satiated and delighted with thy goodness, seeing that thou didst find pleasure in the seventh day, and didst hallow it; thon didst call it the desirable of days, in remembrance of the creation.</p>  
 <p>Our God and God of our fathers, accept our rest, and on this Sabbath day renew this New Moon unto us for good and for blessing, for joy and for gladness, for salvation and comfort, for sustenance and maintenance, for life and peace, for pardon of sin and forgiveness of iniquity (<i>during Leap Year:—</i><a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="green">p. 233</font></a> and for atonement of transgression); for thou hast chosen thy people Israel from among all nations, and hast made thy holy Sabbath known unto them, and hast appointed unto them statutes for the beginnings of the months. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who sanctifiest the Sabbath, Israel and the beginnings of the months.</p>
