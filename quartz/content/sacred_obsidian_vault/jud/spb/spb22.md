 <p>Happy are they that dwell in thy house: they will be ever praising thee. (Selah.)</p>  
 <p>Happy is the people, that is in such a case: happy the people, whose God is the Lord.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxlv. A Psalm of Praise: of David.</p>  
 <p>I will extol thee, my God, O King; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.</p>  
 <p>Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.</p>  
 <p>Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised: and his greatness is unsearchable.</p>  
 <p>One generation shall laud thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.</p>  
 <p>On the majestic glory of thy grandeur, and on thy marvellous deeds, will I meditate.</p>  
 <p>And men shall speak of the might of thy awful acts; and I will recount thy greatness.</p>  
 <p>They shall pour forth the fame of thy great goodness, and shall exult in thy righteousness.</p>  
 <p>The Lord is gracious and merciful; slow to anger and of great lovingkindness.</p>  
 <p>The Lord is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works.</p>  
 <p>All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O Lord; and thy loving ones shall bless thee.</p>  
 <p>They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power.</p>  
 <p>To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the majestic glory of his kingdom.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="green">p. 251</font></a></p>  
 <p>Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.</p>  
 <p>The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that are bowed down.</p>  
 <p>The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest then. their food in due season.</p>  
 <p>Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest every living thing with favor.</p>  
 <p>The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and loving in all his works.</p>  
 <p>The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.</p>  
 <p>He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; he also will hear their cry, and will save them.</p>  
 <p>The Lord guardeth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.</p>  
 <p>My mouth shall speak of the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.</p>  
 <p>But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye the Lord.</p>  
 <p>And a redeemer shall come to Zion and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord. And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord: my spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</p>

 <p>But thou art holy, O thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.  <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">*</font></a>And they receive sanction the one from the other, and say, Holy in the highest heavens, the place of his divine abode; holy upon earth, the work of his might; holy for ever and to all eternity is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of the radiance of his glory. Then a wind lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing (saying), Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place.  <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">*</font></a>Then a wind lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, of those who uttered praises, and said, Blessed be the glory of the Lord from the region of his divine abode. The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.  <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">*</font></a>The kingdom of the Lord endureth for ever and to all eternity. O Lord, the God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and direct their heart unto thee. Arid he, being merciful, forgiveth iniquity and destroyeth not: yea, many a time he turneth his anger away, and doth not stir up all his wrath. For thou, O Lord, art good and forgiving, and abounding in lovingkindness to all them that call upon thee. Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy Law is truth. Thou wilt show truth to Jacob and loving kindness to Abraham, according as thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. Blessed be the Lord day by day; if one burdeneth us.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> God is our salvation. (Selah.) The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. (Selah.) O Lord of hosts, happy is the man who trusteth in thee. Save, Lord: may the King answer us on the day when we call. Blessed is our God, who hath created us for his glory, and hath separated us from them that go astray, and hath given us the Law of truth and planted everlasting life in our midst. May he open our heart unto his Law, and place his love and fear within our hearts, that we may do his will and serve him with a perfect heart, that we may not labor in vain, nor bring forth for confusion. May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that we may keep thy statutes in this world, and be worthy to live to witness and inherit happiness and blessing in the days of the Messiah and in the life of the world to come. To the end that my glory may sing praise unto thee, and not be silent: O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose trust the Lord is. Trust ye in the Lord for ever; for in Jah the Lord is an everlasting rock. And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou hast not forsaken them that seek thee, Lord. It pleased the Lord, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the Law and to make it honorable.</p>  
 <p><i>Reader</i>.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom during your life and during your days, and during the life of all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.</p>

 <p>And as for me, may my prayer unto thee, O Lord, be in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, answer me in the truth of thy salvation.</p>

 <p>It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, to ascribe greatness to him who formed the world in the beginning, since he hath not made us like the nations of other lands, and hath not placed us like other families of the earth, since he hath not assigned unto us a portion as unto them, nor a lot as unto all their multitude. For we bend the knee and offer worship and thanks before the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, who stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, the seat of whose glory is in the heavens above, and the abode of whose might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God; there is none else: in truth he is our King; there is none besides him; as it is written in his Law, And thou shalt know this day, and lay it to thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.</p>  
 <p>We therefore hope in thee, O Lord our God, that we may speedily behold the glory of thy might, when thou wilt remove the abominations from the earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty, and all the children of flesh will call upon thy name, when thou wilt turn unto thyself all the wicked of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know that unto thee every knee must bow, every tongue must swear. Before thee, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall; and unto thy glorious name let them give honor; let them all accept the yoke of thy kingdom, and do thou reign over them speedily, and for ever</p>  
 <p><a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="green">p. 263</font></a></p>  
 <p>and ever. For the kingdom is thine, and to all eternity thou wilt reign in glory; as it is written in thy Law The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. And it is said, And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall the Lord be One, and his name One.</p>

 <p align="center"><i>From the Sabbath after "the Rejoicing of the Law" until the Sabbath before Passover, the following Psalms are read:—</i></p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm civ.</p>  
 <p>Bless the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art very great; thou hast robed thee in splendor and majesty. He covereth himself with light as with a garment; he stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain: he layeth the beams of his upper chambers in the waters; he maketh the clouds his chariot; he walketh upon the wings of the wind. He maketh winds his messengers; his ministers flaming fire: he founded the earth upon its bases, that it might not be moved for ever. Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a vesture; the waters stood above the mountains. At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. The mountains rose, the valleys sank unto the place which thou hadst founded for them. Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; they run among the mountains. They give drink to every beast of the plain; the wild asses quench their thirst. By them the birds of the heaven have their dwelling, they utter their voice from among the branches. He giveth drink to the mountains from his upper chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. He causeth grass to grow for the cattle, and herbs for the service of man; that he may bring forth bread from the earth; and wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengtheneth man's heart. The trees of the Lord are satisfied; the cedars of Lebanon which he hath planted; where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the conies. He made the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth its going down. Thou makest darkness, and it is night; wherein all the beasts of the forest do move. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God. The sun ariseth, they get them</p>  
 <p><a name="page_265"><font size="1" color="green">p. 265</font></a></p>  
 <p>away, and lay them down in their dens. Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labor until the evening How manifold are thy works, O Lord! In wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy possessions. Yonder is the sea, great and of wide extern therein are moving things innumerable, living creatures both small and great. There the ships make their course; there is leviathan whom thou hast formed to sport therein. These all wait upon thee, that thou mayest give them their food in due season. Thou givest unto them, they gather; thou openest thine hand, they are satisfied with good. Thou hidest thy face, they are confounded; thou gatherest in their breath, they die, and return to their dust. Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the ground. Let the glory of the Lord endure for ever; let the Lord rejoice in his works. He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. May my meditation be sweet unto him: as for me, I will rejoice in the Lord. Sinners shall be consumed out of the earth, and the wicked shall be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul: praise ye the Lord.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxx.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees. In my distress I cried unto the Lord, and he answered me. Deliver my soul, O Lord, from a lying lip, and from a deceitful tongue. What shall he give unto thee, and what shall he add unto thee, thou deceitful tongue? Sharpened arrows of a mighty man with coals of juniper. Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar. My soul hath full long had her dwelling with him that hateth peace. I am all peace; but when I speak, they are for war.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxxi.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees. I lift up mine eyes unto the hills: whence will my help come? My help is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="green">p. 266</font></a></p>  
 <p>from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth. He will not suffer thy foot to slip: he that guardeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that guardeth Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord is thy guardian: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall guard thee from all evil; he shall guard thy soul. The Lord shall guard thy going out and thy coming in, from this time forth and for evermore.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxxii.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees; of David. I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go unto the house of the Lord. Our feet stood within thy gates, O Jerusalem; Jerusalem that art built up as a city that is compact together: whither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord, for a testimony unto Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; may they prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy rampart, prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions’ sakes I would fain speak peace concerning thee. For the sake of the house of the Lord our God I would seek thy good.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxxiii.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees. Unto thee do I lift up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look unto the Lord our God, until he have pity upon us. Have pity upon us, O Lord, have pity upon us: for we are full sated with contempt. Our soul is full sated with the mocking of those that are at ease, with the contempt of the proud.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxxiv.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees; of David. If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, let Israel now say:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="green">p. 267</font></a></p>  
 <p>if it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us, then they had swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us; then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul; then the proud waters had gone over our soul. Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth. Our soul escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare was broken, and we escaped. Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxxv.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees. They that trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever. The mountains are round about Jerusalem, and the Lord is round about his people, from this time forth and for evermore. For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous, that the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity. Dc good, O Lord, unto those that are good, and to them that are upright in their hearts. But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord will destroy them with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxxvi.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees. When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like unto them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with exultation: then said they among the nations, The Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; whereat we rejoiced. Bring back our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south. They that sow, in tears shall reap in joy. Though he goeth on his way weeping, hearing the store of seed, he shall come back with joy, bearing his sheaves.</p>

 <p align="center">Psalm cxxvii.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees; of Solomon. Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except the Lord watch over the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. It is vain for you to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat the bread of toil: such things he giveth unto his beloved in sleep. Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: the fruit of the womb is his reward. As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth. Happy is the man that hath filled his quiver with them: they shall not be ashamed, when they speak with enemies in the gate.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxxviii.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees. Happy is every one that feareth the Lord, that walketh in his ways. When thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands, happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the recesses of thine house: thy children like olive plants, round about thy table. Behold thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord. May the Lord bless thee out of Zion: mayest thou see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. Yea, mayest thou see thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxxix.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees. To the full have they afflicted me from my youth up, let Israel now say; to the full have they afflicted me from my youth up: yet have they not prevailed against me. The plower; plowed upon my back, they made long their furrows. The Lord is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. Let them be ashamed and turned backward, all they that hate Zion. Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth before it shooteth forth: wherewith the mower filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom: neither do</p>  
 <p><a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="green">p. 269</font></a></p>  
 <p>they which go by say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you; we bless you in the name of the Lord.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxxx.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord. Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My soul waiteth for the Lord, more than watchmen wait for the morning; yea, more than watchmen for the morning. O let Israel hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is lovingkindness, and with him is plenteous deliverance. And he shall deliver Israel from all his iniquities.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxxxi.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees; of David. Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty, neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too marvellous for me. Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with his mother; my soul is with me like a weaned child. O Israel, hope in the Lord from this time forth and for evermore.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxxxii.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees. Lord, remember for David all his affliction; how he sware unto the Lord, and vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob: Surely I will not come into the tent of my house, nor go up unto the couch of my rest; I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids; until I find out a place for the Lord, a habitation for the Mighty One of Jacob. Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah: we found it in the fields of Jaar. Let us go into his habitation; let us worship</p>  
 <p><a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="green">p. 270</font></a></p>  
 <p>at his footstool. Arise, O Lord, unto thy resting place; thou, and the ark of thy strength. Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy loving ones exult. For the sake of David thy servant turn not away the face of thine anointed. The Lord hath sworn unto David in truth—he will not turn from it—: of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I shall teach them, their children also shall sit upon thy throne for evermore. For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. This is my resting-place for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her needy with bread. Her priests also will I clothe with salvation; and her loving ones shall exult aloud. There will I make a horn to spring forth unto David: I have prepared a lamp for mine anointed. His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon him his crown shall shine.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxxxiii.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees; of David. Behold, how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the goodly oil upon the head, that runneth down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard; that runneth down upon the skirt of his garments; like the dew of Hermon, that runneth down upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commandment the blessing, even life for evermore.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm cxxxiv.</p>  
 <p>A Song of Degrees. Behold, bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord, who stand in the house of the Lord in the night seasons. Lift up your hands towards the sanctuary, and bless ye the Lord. The Lord bless thee out of Zion; even he that made heaven and earth.</p>
