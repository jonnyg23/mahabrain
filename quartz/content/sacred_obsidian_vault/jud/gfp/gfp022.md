 <p>THE term <i>kam</i> (he rose) is a homonym. In one of its significations it is the opposite of "to sit," as "He did not rise (<i>kam</i>) nor move for him" (Esth. v. 9). It further denotes the confirmation and verification of a thing, e.g.: "The Lord will verify (<i>yakem</i>) His promise" (1 Sam. i. 23); "The field of Ephron was made sure (<i>va-yakom</i>) as the property of Abraham" (Gen. xxiii. 17). "The house that is in the walled city shall be established (<i>ve-kam</i>)" (Lev. xxv. 30); "And the kingdom of Israel shall be firmly established (<i>ve-kamah</i>) in thy hand" (1 Sam. xxiv. 20). It is always in this sense that the verb is employed with reference to the Almighty; as "Now shall I rise (<i>akum</i>), saith the Lord" (Ps. xii. 7), which is the same as saying, "Now shall I verify my word and my dispensation for good or evil." "Thou shalt arise (<i>takum</i>) and have mercy upon Zion" (Ps. cii. 13), which means: Thou wilt establish what thou hast promised, viz., that thou wouldst pity Zion.</p>  
 <p>Generally a person who resolves to set about a matter, accompanies his resolve by rising, hence the verb is employed to express "to resolve" to do a certain thing; as, "That my son hath stirred up my servant against me" (1 Sam. xxii. 8). The word is figuratively used to signify the execution of a divine decree against a people sentenced to extermination, as "And I will rise against the house of Jeroboam" (Amos vii. 9); "but he win arise against the house of the evildoers" (Isa. xxxi. 2). Possibly in Psalm xii. 7 the verb has this latter sense, as also in Psalm cii. 13, namely: Thou wilt rise up against her enemies.</p>  
 <p>There are many passages to be interpreted in this manner, but in no way should it be understood that He rises or sits--far be such a notion! Our Sages expressed this idea in the formula," In the world above there is neither sitting nor standing (<i>‘amidah</i>)"; for the two verbs <i>‘amad</i> and <i>kam</i> are synonyms [and what is said about the former is also applicable to the latter].</p>
