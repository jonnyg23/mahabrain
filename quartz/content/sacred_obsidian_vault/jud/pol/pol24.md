 <p align="center"><i>Meekness</i>.</p>  
 <p>We find in the Bible many instances of the pleasure which meekness and humility in the creature affords the Great Creator. The noblest of our ancestors were those who were free from self-pride.</p>  
 <p>Abraham, the pure in heart, knew well he was but dust of the earth; and when the sons of Heth addressed him as the "prince of God," he bowed down before them.</p>  
 <p>Moses and Aaron, the leaders of Israel, exclaimed, "What are we!" And Moses in place of being jealous on hearing that two of his followers were prophesying in the camp, said humbly, "Would that all the Lord's people were prophets." (Numb. 11: 29.)</p>  
 <p>When David dedicated to God's service the costly material he had gathered for the Temple, he meekly said, "Only of Thine own have we given Thee." (Ps. 37: 11.)</p>  
 <p>From the Great Eternal, Himself, we learn humility. He chose Mount Sinai from which to give His commandments: ’twas not the highest of the mountains. He called to Moses not from a lofty tree but from a lowly bush. When he spoke to Elijah, he allowed the wind to roar, the earth to tremble, and the fire to flash forth; but for His medium He chose "the still small voice,"</p>

 <p>Rabbi Hunnah said, "He who is proud in heart is as sinful as the idolater."</p>  
 <p>Rabbi Abira said, "He who is proud shall be humbled."</p>  
 <p>Heskaiah said, "The prayers of a proud hard-hearted man are never heard."</p>  
 <p>Rabbi Ashi said, "He who hardens his heart with pride, softens his brains with the same."</p>  
 <p>Rabbi Joshua said, "Meekness is better than sacrifice;" for is it not written, "The sacrifices of God are a broken heart--a broken contrite spirit, Thou, oh Lord, will not despise."</p>
