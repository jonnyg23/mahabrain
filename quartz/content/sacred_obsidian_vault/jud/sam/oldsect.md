 <center><b>The Oldest and Smallest
 Sect in the World</b><b></b>

 </p><p>There
 is to be found in the heart of the small city of Nablus, in North Palestine,
 a little religious community-now numbering about one hundred and fifty
 souls-which has defied the ravages of war and poverty and oppression nearly
 three thousand years. Unlike the Vaudois, these Samaritans have had no
 friendly system of mountain buttresses to defend them through the centuries;
 and still more unlike the long-lived Savoyard Protestants, they have been
 right in the pathway along which the devastating armies have marched back
 and forth, from the time of Sargon to Napoleon. But they have lived on,
 and their unity has never broken. They have clung to little Nablus and
 to their sacred Mount Gerizim, as the very cactus roots to the granite
 sides of the somber Ebal that confronts them across their little enchanted
 valley.
 
 </p><p>The
 line of Samaritan History, however, extends to a far earlier period than
 thirty centuries since; indeed, it stretches back to the morning of history.
 When Abraham was called out of Mesopotamia to the land of Canaan he crossed
 the Jordan and proceeded directly to Sichem, or Shechem, the probable site
 of the present Nablus, where he pitched his tent and dwelt for a time,
 receiving during his stay the divine promise of the possession of the whole
 land by his posterity. From Abraham's time, therefore, the Samaritans history
 runs parallel with the Jewish, until the breaking up of the Jewish nationality
 by the Assyrian invasion. Since that catastrophe the line of Samaritan
 religious life has never been interrupted. The Jews have dispersed all
 over the world, and are now divided into numerous shades of faith. But
 the Samaritans still live at the base of the sacred Gerizim, and have never
 differed amongst each other in tradition, fait, or usages. Dean Stanley
 has accordingly ample ground for claiming for claiming for this little
 Samaritan community the distinguished honor of being the "oldest and smallest
 sect in the world."
 
 </p><p>The
 feeling with which the present Samaritans regard the Mohammedans is of
 that intense bitterness which they have always manifested toward the Jews.
 And why not? Does not the Samaritan date his faith from Abraham, or rather
 from Adam<i>?</i> And has he not a right to call that infant religion which
 has been in existence for only the trifle of twelve centuries? Is not the
 Koran one of your new catchpenny romances, while that mysterious copy of
 the Pentateuch, made of sacred lamb-skins, which the Samaritans have been
 reading and kissing through these many ages, is the oldest copy in existence,
 written down by Aaron's own grandson, and the veritable original of all
 the Pentateuchs in the world?
 
 </p><p>As
 the population of Nablus is just about 12,000, the little Samaritan community
 is almost absorbed by the surrounding Mohammedan mass. Save to a careful
 observer, the very existence and presence of the Samaritans as a distinct
 element of citizenship in Nablus would not be noticed. The Samaritans wear
 turban, much like that of their true Moslem neighbors, but between the
 history and theology of the two classes there is not a single point of
 positive resemblance.
 
 </p><p>My
 visit to Nablus was in April, the best of all months for the enjoyment
 of the rare beauty of the region. Having come from the barren and rocky
 hills of Judea, I was hardly prepared for so positive a change as this
 sudden luxuriance of foliage and flowers. At Jacob's Well I turned abruptly
 to the left, and entered the narrow valley of Nablus. What the valley of
 the Engadine, is to the Tyrol, that of Nablus to Syria. There is nothing
 elsewhere that proves it. It is the quiet, half-concealed gem of the whole
 land. While the plain of Esdraelon is fruitful, there is chiefly the charm
 of history to make it attractive. But in the valley of Nablus there is
 a profusion of flowers and fruits that transfers you at once to the tropics.
 
 </p><p>Beyond
 the city of Nablus, as you bear northward toward Sebustieh, the ancient
 city of Samaria, the sound of brooks and fountains-new enough to the tourist
 from the south-is as present and cheering as to the guest who falls asleep
 amid the jasmines and fountains of the court of Demetri's Hotel in Damascus.
 The valley is a perpetual orchard, or rather garden, with a great variety
 of fruits and flowers. Figs, mulberries, grapes, pomegranates, oranges,
 lemons, apricots, almonds, and other fruits vie for mastery in this miniature
 Eden. Van de Valde, for a calm Dutchman, quite lost his self-control when
 he entered the valley. For example, he speaks of a peculiar coloring here
 to all objects-"a lovely bluish haze."
 
 </p><p>My
 dragoman conducted me into Nablus by the western gate-an old rickety affair.
 Through this I rode with something of a dash, lest the sleepy guard should
 take it into his head to detain me without for an hour or two until the
 completion of the customary meaningless formalities. On my way to my lodgings
 I passed an excellent bazaar, which I have since learned is the best in
 Palestine. I found dark but otherwise comfortable quarters in the middle
 of the little city, and divided my few days in Nablus between clambering
 up the sides of Mount Gerizim, examining the marble ruins that crown it,
 conversing with the Samaritan high-priest, and rambling back to Jacob's
 Well and Joseph's Tomb.
 
 </p><p>The
 presence of the little Samaritan community in Nablus, clinging to their
 traditions and religion and first home with a tenacity which has no parallel
 in the annals of the world, suggests a glance at the marvelous history
 of this now dying sect. When Sargon, the successor of Shalmaneser, king
 of Assryia, took Samaria and carried all its strong inhabitants to Assyria,
 B.C. <i>722</i>, he supplied the place of the exiles by colonists from
 Babylon and other parts of his empire. These colonists united with the
 infirm population which had not been regarded worth taking captive, and
 the two elements formed the basis of a new and mixed population. The religion,
 up to a certain time, was semi-idolatrous, having been introduced by the
 new colonists from Babylonia. They country began to be infested with lions
 and other wild beasts, and the people, regarding this as an evidence of
 divine wrath for stripping the land of its native deity, sent a request
 to the King of Assyria to give an order for the return of some Israelitish
 priests from captivity, that the citizens might be instructed in their
 former worship of Jehovah, and thus the wrath of the popular deity be appeased
 for all time to come. The request was granted, and Israelitish priests
 became the religious teachers of Samaria. Shechem, the Sychar of the New
 Testament and Nablus of our times, became the capital. We have then, this
 anomalous combination of facts: a mongrel population, part Assyrian and
 part Isrealitish, living in a country which had belonged to the latter
 element, and now instructed in the religion of Israel by the priests who
 had been voluntarily sent back from exile. When, at the end of seventy
 years' Jewish captivity, Zerubbabel and his Jewish brethren returned to
 Jerusalem and began to rebuild the temple, the Samaritans proposed to unite
 with them. But the Jews would not permit them, on the ground that they
 regarded the Samaritans as semi-pagans. They therefore disclaimed all fellowship
 with them, and would give them no share in the restoration of their worship
 throughout the land. The Samaritans now conceived the idea of religious
 independence; so they proceeded to their sacred Shechem, and erected on
 the top of Mount Gerizim that great temple whose ruins are to-day the wonder
 of the antiquarian. From the day of the refusal of the Jews to permit them
 to share in the rebuilding of the temple, the hostility between the two
 peoples has been singularly intense.
 
 </p><p>There
 is no sadder bit of local history than that of Nablus. In the Roman period
 this city was rebuilt by Vespasian, on or near the site of the ancient
 Shechem, and called Flavia Neapolis (new city). The present title is therefore
 a very perceptible Arabic corruption of the roman name. A Roman colony
 was established there by Vespasian. It appears that the population has
 always been quarrelsome, either with itself or unitedly against its rulers.
 Toward the end of the reign of the Emperor Zeno, A.D. <i>490</i>, the people
 arose against the Christians, and having chosen as a chief a certain Justus,
 they fell on them during the feast of Pentecost, and put to death many
 of them and destroyed their churches. The Emperor sent troops against the
 rebels. Gerizim was given to the Christians, who built a church thereon
 in honor of the virgin. The ruins of this church we find to-day beside
 those of the original Samaritan temple. Under Justinian the Samaritans
 rose again, and destroyed the churches and massacred as many of the Christians
 as fell into their hands. They murdered Ammonas, Archbishop of Shechem.
 These excesses were punished by Justinian, who sent out a general against
 the rebels, and the Samaritans were compelled to build the demolished churches
 at their own cost. This generalrebellious
 spirit of the Samaritans explains the severity of the degrees of the Emperors
 in the Roman code against this sect.*
 
 </p><p>During
 the later Roman Empire the Samaritans, as a sect, began to lose all historical
 importance. The Christians had their churches at Nablus, and were protected
 in their rights, until the Mohammedan conquest of Syria, when both Samaritans
 and Christians shared in the devastations of that time. The Samaritans,
 however, were not exterminated, and were not driven from Nablus. During
 the Crusades they fell under Christian rule, and again reverted to Mohammedan
 control when the Turks became possessors of Syria. The Samaritans have
 therefore never been an independent people, but have been successively
 ruled by the Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, Jews, Romans, and Turks. Yet
 during all these thirty centuries they have never gone beyond the site
 of their pomegranate and almond blossoms, or the sounds of the brooks,
 or the protecting side of their sacred Gerizim. But they have paid a fearful
 penalty in the decrease of their numbers and in their present poverty.
 Only their religion has kept them bound together.
 
 </p><p>I
 spent an entire afternoon on the top of Gerizim, and by the aid of an excellent
 diagram examined the ruins of the church and the ancient temple until an
 approaching storm hastened my departure. The various parts and uses of
 the temple are still traceable. The greatest of the Samaritan festivals,
 the Passover, is still celebrated on the top of Gerizim with the most solemn
 and elaborate festivities.
 
 </p><p>The
 Samaritan synagogue is a small building in the center of Nablus, half obscured
 by the surrounding dwellings. I passed through arched and littered streets
 to a little court, in the middle of which was a little plot of grass, relieved
 by three trees, two of which were lemon. I here found a little Samaritan
 school, and at the sight of a stranger the children sprang from the floor
 where they were sitting, kissed my hand, and begged for backsheesh. The
 teacher was a youth of about fourteen, the son of Amram the high-priest.
 I was greatly disappointed at failing to find Amram himself, but in the
 end this circumstance aided me in my chief object, for the young man was
 willing, for a goof fee, to show me the ancient Pentateuch. His father
 might have been deaf to all entreaties.
 
 </p><p>The
 claim of the Samaritans to have a copy of the Pentateuch older than the
 Jewish is supported by their own unbroken tradition and by the opinion
 of some learned men of the present time in Christian countries. But the
 weight of internal evidence is against it, among which may be mentioned
 grammatical emendations, late glosses in the text, insertions of foreign
 passages, alterations, Samaritanisms, and changes in support of Samaritan
 doctrine.
 
 </p><p>There
 are three codices kept in the little synagogue in Nablus, two being generally
 shown to strangers. It is very rarely that the veritable one can be seen.
 My good fortune in getting a hasty look at it was due to the venturous
 and avaricious spirit of Amram's sons, rather than to any management of
 my own. Having first exhibited the two imitations, the young man, upon
 the offer of an additional fee, then brought out the original scroll from
 a chest. After the removal of the red satin cover I saw that the codex
 was enclosed in a silver cylindrical case, which had two doors opening
 on two sets of hinges. When these doors were thrown back the whole column
 was exposed to the vision. It is about two feet and a half long and nearly
 a foot in diameter, and presents, in exquisite raised work, a good plan
 of the Tabernacle, with every part given with the utmost minuteness and
 rarest skill. The roll consists of dingy skins-prepared before the invention
 of parchment-sewed together with neat stitches, and worn and patched, and
 hear and there entirely illegible. The skins are of equal size, and measure
 each twenty-five inches long and fifteen wide. 
 
 </p><p>Before
 leaving Nablus I had the opportunity of spending an evening with Amram
 at his house. He lived in the greatest simplicity, though in Palestine
 that is the rule rather than the exception. Mrs. El Karey, the wife of
 the missionary in Nablus in the employment of the Church Missionary Society
 of London, was good enough to accompany me and serve as interpreter. The
 venerable high-priest, who was barefooted, and clad in a great turban and
 loose flowing robe, received us with calm and dignified cordiality in his
 room-at once his parlor, dining-room, and bedroom. His very aged mother
 was lying on the floor, covered with bedclothing and asleep.There
 were several children, half asleep, lying about the room. Amram's son-in-law
 was slowly copying a Pentateuch-for the Samaritans have no printing-press.
 It requires a year to make a copy, which is never sold, and is only used
 by the community. The aged mother of Amram arose after we had been present
 a few minutes, the many ornaments on her neck and in her ears making a
 harsh tinkling sound as she moved. I was invited to a seat on the floor,
 and to take coffee and cigarettes. The mother, on seeing guests in her
 presence, took a rude bellows and blew up the coals under the copper kettle.
 Coffee, the Oriental's unfailing proof of hostility, was handed us in little
 cups. 
 
 </p><p>The
 peculiar views of Amram may be said to represent very fairly the theology
 of his dying community. The world, he claimed, is about seven thousand
 years old. For fifty-five years men will go on increasing in wickedness,
 after which there will come a time of great peace and purity. Then there
 will come on a new period of consummate wickedness, which will last three
 hundred years. This time will be consummated by the total destruction of
 the world. After this the
 general judgment will take place, when the righteous
 will go to live with God and the wicked with Satan. There are some people
 who have clean hearts, or at least are accepted as clean, though none are
 absolutely pure. Just here Amram looked off, as if in the distance, and
 said, "God is one!" Here he intended a slight thrust at all Christians,
 because of their emphasis on Christ and His divine character. He spoke
 with interest of the ruins on Mount Gerizim, and of the increase of his
 community within the last thirty years. He closed by expressing his firm
 belief that the time would come when the Samaritans would be the most numerous
 body in the world. 
 
 </p><p>Amram
 has since died, and the sedate son-in-law, being the eldest male relative,
 has succeeded him in the high-priest-hood.
