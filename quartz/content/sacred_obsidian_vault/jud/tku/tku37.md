 <h3 align="CENTER">CONCERNING THE HAIR OF MICROPROSOPUS.</h3>
 <p>570. WE have learned that from the skull of His head (<i>i.e., of Microprosopus</i>) hang one thousand times a thousand myriad myriads of locks of black hair, and they are intertwined together each to the other, and they are mingled together.</p>
 <p>571. But there is no classification made of the locks of hair separately, because pure and impure alike adhere to each other therein, and here (<i>the description above given</i>) mentions both pure and impure together.</p>
 <p>572. In all those sides which are pure, and in all those which are impure, there are intricate and dense locks of hair, some of which are soft, some hard.</p>
 <p>573. And in single locks doth the hair hang down, curls upon curls, which emit flames, and hang down in beautiful and strong array, like those of a brave hero victorious in war.</p>
 <p>574. They are excellent as the great and foliated cedars. This is that which is written, Cant. v. 15: "Excellent as the cedars."</p>

 <p>575. The curling locks are parted on this side and on that above the head.</p>
 <p>576. Also we have learned that they remain in curls because they proceed from many fountains of the three canals of the brain.</p>
 <p>577. For from the fountain of one cavity of the skull proceedeth the hair, and it becomes curls upon curls (formed), from the fountains proceeding from that cavity.</p>
 <p>578. From the second cavity there go forth fifty fountains, and from those fountains the hair issueth, and it becometh curls upon curls, and they are mingled with the other locks.</p>
 <p>579. From the third cavity there go forth a thousand times a thousand conclaves and assemblies, and from them all the hair issueth; and it becometh curls upon curls, and they are mingled with the other locks.</p>
 <p>580. And therefore are those locks so curling, and all the progeny of them is produced from the three cavities of the brain of the skull.</p>
 <p>58t. And all those curls hang down and are spread over the sides of the ears.</p>
 <p>532. And therefore is it written, Dan. ix. 18: "Incline thine ear, O my God, and hear."</p>
 <p>583. And in those curls there are found alike right and left, <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">1</font></a> light and dark, mercy and judgment, and everything (<i>that hath in itself the qualities of</i>) right and left dependeth thence (<i>from Microprosopus</i>), and not from the Ancient One. <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>584. In the parting of the hair appeareth a certain slender path, which hath a certain connection with that path of the Ancient of Days, and from that path are divided six hundred and thirteen paths, <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">3</font></a> which are</p>

 <p><a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 183</font></a></p>
 <p>distributed among the paths of the precepts of the law.</p>
 <p>585. Like as it is written, Ps. xxv. 6: "All the paths of Tetragrammaton are mercy and truth unto such as keep His covenant and His testimony."</p>
 <p>586. We have learned that in the single locks a thousand times a thousand utterances of the speech of Tetragrammaton are found, which depend from the single locks.</p>
 <p>587. Among them some are hard (<i>rigorous</i>) and some soft (<i>merciful</i>), as (<i>belonging unto</i>) the Lord of the equilibrium (or, the Lord of mercy, who is an equilibrium between these); and therefore is He (<i>Microprosopus</i>) said to include right and left.</p>
