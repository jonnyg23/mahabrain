 <p>(<i>d</i>) In several places Abraham warns the reader that this is the most difficult Operation of any, because for it to be brought about, the concurrence of all the Chief Spirits must be obtained. Watch for the moment when the person dies, and then at once place upon his body towards the 4 cardinal points the Symbol required. Similar Symbols are to be sewn into the garments he wears. Abraham moreover adds that by this means, one can however only prolong the life for 7 years, and no more.</p>
