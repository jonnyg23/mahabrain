 <p align="center"><strong>THE PRELIMINARY LECTION</strong></p>
 <p>In the Name of the Initiator, Amen.</p>
 <p>1. In the beginning was Initiation. The flesh profiteth nothing; the mind profiteth 
   nothing; that which is unknown to you and above these, while firmly based upon 
   their equilibrium, giveth life.</p>
 <p>2. In all systems of religion is to be found a system of Initiation, which 
   may be defined as the process by which a man comes to learn that unknown Crown.</p>
 <p>3. Though none can communicate either the knowledge or the power to achieve 
   this, which we may call the Great Work, it is yet possible for initiates to 
   guide others.</p>
 <p>4. Every man must overcome his own obstacles, expose his own illusions. Yet 
   others may assist him to do both, and they may enable him altogether to avoid 
   many of the false paths, leading no whither, which tempt the weary feet of the 
   uninitiated pilgrim. They can further insure that he is duly tried and tested, 
   for there are many who think themselves to be Masters who have not even begun 
   to tread the Way of Service that leads thereto.</p>
 <p>5. Now the Great Work is one, and the Initiation is one, and the Reward is 
   one, however diverse are the symbols wherein the Unutterable is clothed.</p>
 <p>6. Hear then the history of the system which this lection gives you the opportunity 
   of investigating.</p>
 <p>Listen, we pray you, with attention: for once only does the Great Order knock 
   at any one door.</p>
 <p>Whosoever knows any member of that Order as such, can never know another, until 
   he too has attained to mastery.</p>
 <p>Here, therefore, we pause, that you may thoroughly search yourself, and consider 
   if you are yet fitted to take an irrevocable step.</p>
 <p>For the reading of that which follows is Recorded.</p>
 <p align="center"><strong>THE HISTORY LECTION</strong></p>
 <p>7. Some years ago a number of cipher MSS. were discovered and deciphered by 
   certain students. They attracted much attention, as they purported to derive 
   from the Rosicrucians. You will readily understand that the genuineness of the 
   claim matters no whit, such literature being judged by itself, not by its reputed 
   sources.</p>
 <p>8. Among the MSS. was one which gave the address of a certain person in Germany, 
   who is known to us as S.D.A. Those who discovered the ciphers wrote to S.D.A., 
   and in accordance with the instructions received, an Order was founded which 
   worked in a semi-secret manner.</p>
 <p>9. After some time S.D.A. died: further requests for help were met with a prompt 
   refusal from the colleagues of S.D.A. It was written by one of them that S.D.A.'s 
   scheme had always been regarded with disapproval. But since the absolute rule 
   of the adepts is never to interfere with the judgment of any other person whomsoeverhow 
   much more, then, one of themselves, and that one most highly revered!they had 
   refrained from active opposition. The adept who wrote this added that the Order 
   had already quite enough knowledge to enable it or its members to formulate 
   a magical link with the adepts.</p>
 <p>10. Shortly after this, one called S.R.M.D. announced that he had formulated 
   such a link, and that himself and two others were to govern the Order. New and 
   revised rituals were issued, and fresh knowledge poured out in streams.</p>
 <p>11. We must pass over the unhappy juggleries which characterized the next period. 
   It has throughout proved impossible to elucidate the complex facts.</p>
 <p>We content ourselves, then, with observing that the death of one of his two 
   colleagues, and the weakness of the other, secured to S.R.M.D. the sole authority. 
   The rituals were elaborated, though scholarly enough, into verbose and pretentious 
   nonsense: the knowledge proved worthless, even where it was correct: for it 
   is in vain that pearls, be they never so clear and precious, are given to the 
   swine.</p>
 <p>The ordeals were turned into contempt, it being impossible for any one to fail 
   therein. Unsuitable candidates were admitted for no better reason than that 
   of their worldly prosperity.</p>
 <p>In short, the Order failed to initiate.</p>
 <p>12. Scandal arose and with it schism.</p>
 <p>13. In 1900 one P., a brother, instituted a rigorous test of S.R.M.D. on the 
   one side and the Order on the other.</p>
 <p>14. He discovered that S.R.M.D., though a scholar of some ability and a magician 
   of remarkable powers, had never attained complete inititiation: and further 
   had fallen from his original place, he having imprudently attracted to himself 
   forces of evil too great and terrible for him to withstand.</p>
 <p>The claim of the Order that the true adepts were in charge of it was definitely 
   disproved.</p>
 <p>15. In the Order, with two certain exceptions and two doubtful ones, he found 
   no persons prepared for initiation of any sort.</p>
 <p>16. He thereupon by his subtle wisdom destroyed both the Order and its chief.</p>
 <p>17. Being himself no perfect adept, he was driven of the Spirit into the Wilderness, 
   where he abode for six years, studying by the light of reason the sacred books 
   and secret systems of initiation of all countries and ages.</p>
 <p>18. Finally, there was given unto him a certain exalted grade whereby a man 
   becomes master of knowledge and intelligence, and no more their slave. He perceived 
   the inadequacy of science, philosophy, and religion; and exposed the self-contradictory 
   nature of the thinking faculty.</p>
 <p>19. Returning to England, he laid his achievements humbly at the feet of a 
   certain adept D.D.S., who welcomed him brotherly and admitted his title to the 
   grade which he had so hardly won.</p>
 <p>20. Thereupon these two adepts conferred together, saying: May it not be written 
   that the tribulations shall be shortened? Wherefore they resolved to establish 
   a new Order which should be free from the errors and deceits of the former one.</p>
 <p>21. Without Authority they could not do this, exalted as their rank was among 
   adepts. They resolved to prepare all things, great and small, against that day 
   when such Authority should be received by them, since they knew not where to 
   seek for higher adepts than themselves, but knew that the true way to attract 
   the notice of such was to equilibrate the symbols. The temple must be builded 
   before the God can indwell it.</p>
 <p>22. Therefore by the order of D.D.S. did P. prepare all things by his arcane 
   science and wisdom, choosing only those symbols which were common to all systems, 
   and rigorously rejecting all names and words which might be supposed to imply 
   any religious or metaphysical theory. To do this utterly was found impossible, 
   since all language has a history, and the use (for example) of the word &lt;&lt;spirit&gt;&gt; 
   implies the Scholastic Philosophy and the Hindu and Taoist theories concerning 
   the breath of man. So was it difficult to avoid implication of some undesirable 
   bias by using the words &lt;&lt;order,&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; circle,&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;chapter,&gt;&gt; 
   &lt;&lt;society,&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;brotherhood,&gt;&gt; or any other to designate 
   the body of initiates.</p>
 <p>23. Deliberately, therefore, did he take refuge in vagueness. Not to veil the 
   truth to the Neophyte, but to warn him against valuing non- essentials. Should 
   therefore the candidate hear the name of any God, let him not rashly assume 
   that it refers to any known God, save only the God known to himself. Or should 
   the ritual speak in terms (however vague) which seem to imply Egyptian, Taoist, 
   Buddhist, Indian, Persian, Greek, Judaic, Christian, or Moslem philosoÿhy, let 
   him reflect that this is a defect of language; the literary limitation and not 
   the spiritual prejudice of the man P.</p>
 <p>24. Especially let him guard against the finding of definite sectarian symbols 
   in the teaching of his master, and the reasoning from the known to the unknown 
   which assuredly will tempt him.</p>
 <p>We labour earnestly, dear brother, that you may never be led away to perish 
   upon this point; for thereon have many holy and just men been wrecked. By this 
   have all the visible systems lost the essence of wisdom.</p>
 <p>We have sought to reveal the Arcanum; we have only profaned it.</p>
 <p>25. Now when P. had thus with bitter toil prepared all things under the guidance 
   of D.D.S. (even as the hand writes, while the conscious brain, though ignorant 
   of the detailed movements, applauds or disapproves the finished work) there 
   was a certain time of repose, as the earth lieth fallow.</p>
 <p>26. Meanwhile these adepts busied themselves intently with the Great Work.</p>
 <p>27. In the fullness of time, even as a blossoming tree that beareth fruit in 
   its season, all these pains were ended, and these adepts and their companions 
   obtained the reward which they had soughtthey were to be admitted to the Eternal 
   and Invisible Order that hath no name among men.</p>
 <p>28. They therefore who had with smiling faces abandoned their homes, their 
   possessions, their wives, their children, in order to perform the Great Work, 
   could with steady calm and firm correctness abandon the Great Work itself: for 
   this is the last and greatest projection of the alchemist.</p>
 <p>29. Also one V.V.V.V.V. arose, an exalted adept of the rank of Master of the 
   Temple (or this much He disclosed to the Exempt Adepts) and His utterance is 
   enshrined in the Sacred Writings.</p>
 <p>30. Such are Liber Legis, Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente, Liber Liberi vel Lapidis 
   Lazuli and such others whose existence may one day be divulged unto you. Beware 
   lest you interpret them either in the Light or in the darkness, for only in 
   L.V.X. may they be understood.</p>
 <p>31. Also He conferred upon D.D.S., O.M., and another, the Authority of the 
   Triad, who in turn have delegated it unto others, and they yet again, so that 
   the Body of Initiates may be perfect, even from the Crown unto the Kingdom and 
   beyond.</p>
 <p>32. For Perfection abideth not in the Pinnacles, or in the Foundations, but 
   in the ordered Harmony of one with all.</p>
