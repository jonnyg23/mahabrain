 <h2>33 THE THUN HEXAGRAM</h2>
 <p><em>Lingam of Earth</em></p>
 <pre>

 THUN: A retirement. Though thy force be spent.
 Adroit withdrawal masters the event!
 
 
 Peril! Withdraw! Keep still - though tail yet show.
 Hold fast thy purpose subtly, even so.
 Gracious to them that bind thee; hate their ire;
 maugre their will, the great have wit to retire.
 Retreat in order - even the gods admire.
 Retreat with dignity - rekindle fire.

 TA KWANG: Great strength. Be firm and self-reliant;
 But - tyrannous to use it like a giant!
 
 
 Plant firm thy feet, but dare not yet to move!
 Thy firm correctness exercise and prove.
 Fences entangle rams who blindly shove.
 Strength fails to force some gates that yield to love.
 Thine purpose gained, relax - nor tax thine heart so;
 Once tangled, the best chance is - to know thou art so!

 ZIN: To advance - when thou hast won folk ease,
 thy lord shall give thee gifts and dignities.
 
 
 Firm, patient and great hearted, wait thy day!
 Move with regret - the royal mother's way!
 Confidence thus begotten - why delay?
 Advance by stealth; the marmot guide thee yet;
 Woo not success; the games's the game to play.
 Use power with caution or beware regret!

 MING: Intelligence sore hurt; reflect
 on the position rigidly correct.
 
 
 Hurt? Droop thy wings and fast, while critics leaguer.
 A horse may save one wounded in the thigh.
 Thy great foe taken, be thou not over eager!
 Escape from night by mind's propriety.
 Think how the court of Ki met destiny.
 At last earth swallows him that trod the sky.

 KHWEI: All's disunion, mother of distress;
 But in small matters there may be success.
 
 
 Lost steeds return; bad men may yet take thy way;
 Thy lord may chance to meet thee - in the byway.
 Baffled and punished? Bide time's amnesty.
 Alone and disunion? Friends on highway
 Joined with thy minister thy course is free.
 Pigs? Ghosts? Foes? Nay! Go forward on the skyway.

 for the great man to aid thee in the climb.
 
 
 Advance adds trouble; stillness aids thee now.

 Advance not; be with those united thou.
 Struggle! Friends come to prosecute thy plan.
 Advance not! Wait for aid from the great man!

 KIEH: Loosing; if all's won, return and rest.
 If partial gain, quick action will be best.
 
 
 Begin to loosen - Straight and clear the way.
 Rid fields of foxes; fill the golden quiver.
 Beggars on horseback tempt the brigand's play.
 Stand not to oppose the friends come to deliver.
 Remove all wrong; then all men own thy sway.
 The prince the falcon on the wall shall slay.

 SUN: Diminution; be sincere; the price
 is not the measure of the sacrifice.
 
 
 Leave business to help friends, but yet be wary!
 Guard against action; of the cash be chary!
 Three walk, one's gone; one walks, and meets a two.
 By friendship one finds woes becoming few.
 Here's tortoise shells from the chosen few.
 Prudent though kind well served by friends o'dignitary.

 but to move on, even to cross the river.
 
 
 Success excuses boldness; face thy fate!
 Good omens and true virtue joined, essay!
 Ill leads to well, for him who leads the way;
 Even the capital remove he may.
 Let all men share in thine approved estate!
 By soul's disorders realms disintegrate.

 KWAI: Cutting off; displeasure; front thy foe;
 but show reluctance due in acting so.
 
 
 Lay well thy plans before the march begins.
 Seek loyal friends and have no fear of gins.
 Fight on alone; persistant courage wins!
 Defeated, acquiesce - smiles conquer grins.
 Uproot small men like purslane - tan their skins;
 Cut off is he - and evil his end be!

 KAU: Suddenly encountering -- behold
 a woman -- do not wed her? who is bold.
 
 
 Restrain weak folly - or woo melancholy!
 Here's fish - but ask not fishy folk to dine!
 Defeated, yes; but not at meat with swine!
 No fish - because thou hast mixed with thieves, in fine
 conceal thy virtues - cellars ripen wine!
 But hermits lose things human for divine.

 Weep for thy loneliness - but still aim high!

 Ascend the stairs with proper dignity.
 Firm right maintain, though blind the silent sky!

 KHWAN: Straitened and distressed; the great man acts.
 But rhetoric is far removed from facts.
 
 
 Bare buttocks - tree stump - valley - hopes decay.
 Embarrassed king, be quiet and sincere!
 Rocks, thorns - come home, and find thy wife astray.
 Even with friends the course is hard to steer.

 If kept with care, its virtues never cease.
 
 
 Muddy or dried, what use? Beware decay.
 Leaky: for shame! The worker is disgraced.
 Clear, but unused; how senseless is the waste!
 Well laid and lined, how noble the display.
 Come drink the water - cold, pellucid - chaste.
 Here to the brim it bubbles - go thy way!</pre>
