       <blockquote><font size="-1">To plead the organic causation of a religious 
         state of mind, then, in refutation of its claim to possess superior spiritual 
         value, is quite illogical and arbitrary, unless one have already worked 
         out in advance some psycho-physical theory connecting spiritual values 
         in general with determinate sorts of physiological change. Otherwise none 
         of our thoughts and feelings, not even our scientific doctrines, not even 
         our "dis"-beliefs, could retain any value as revelations of the truth, 
         for every one of them without exception flows from the state of their 
         possessor's body at the time. </font>  
         <p><font size="-1">It is needles to say that medical materialism draws in 
           point of fact no such sweeping skeptical conclusion. It is sure, just 
           as every simple man is sure, that some states of mind are inwardly superior 
           to others, and reveal to us more truth, and in this it simply makes 
           use of an ordinary spiritual judgment. It has no physiological theory 
           of the production of these its favourite states, by which it may accredit 
           them; and its attempt to discredit the states which it dislikes, by 
           vaguely associating them with nerves and liver, and connecting them 
           with names connoting bodily affliction, is altogether illogical and 
           inconsistent. </font>

         <strong>THE QUESTION</strong> 
       </center>
       <p><em>AVE!</em>  
       </p><p>There must have been a time in the life of every student of the Mysteries 
         when he has paused whilst reading the work or the life of some well-known 
         Mystic, a moment of perplexity in which, bewildered, he has turned to 
         himself and asked the question: "Is this one telling me the truth?"  
       </p><p>Still more so does this strike us when we turn to any commentative work 
         upon Mysticism, such as Récéjac's "Bases of the Mystic Knowledge," 
         or William James's "Varieties of Religious Experience." In fact, so much 
         so, that unless we are more than commonly sceptical of the wordy theories 
         which attempt to explain these wordy utterances we are bound to clasp 
         hands with the great school of medical-materialism, which is all but paramount 
         at the present hour, and dismiss all such as have had a glimpse of something 
         we do not see as <em>detraques</em>, degenerates, neuropaths, psychopaths, 
         hypochondriacs, and epileptics.  
       </p><p>Well, even if we do, these terms explain very little, and in most cases, 
         especially when applied to mystic states, nothing at all; nevertheless 
         they form an excellent loophole out of which the ignorant may crawl when 
         faced with a difficulty they have not the energy or wit to surmount. {143}  
       </p><p>True, the utter chaos amongst all systems of magic and mysticism that 
         has prevailed in the West during the last two thousand years, partially, 
         if not entirely, accounts for the uncritical manner in which these systems 
         have been handled by otherwise critical minds.  
       </p><p>Even to-day, though many thousand years after they were first written 
         down, we find a greater simplicity and truth in the ancient rituals and 
         hymns of Egypt and Assyria than in the extraordinary entanglement of systems 
         that came to life during the first five hundred years of Christian era. 
         And in the East, from the most remote antiquity to the present day, scientific 
         systems of illuminism have been in daily practice from the highest to 
         the lowest in the land; though, as we consider, much corrupted by an ignorant 
         priestcraft, by absurd superstitions and by a science which fell to a 
         divine revelation in place of rising to a sublime art.  
       </p><p>In the West, for some fifteen hundred years now, Christianity has swayed 
         the minds of men from the Arctic seas to the Mediterranean. At first but 
         one of many small excrescent faiths, which sprang up like fungi amongst 
         the superb <em>débris</em> of the religions of Egypt, Babylonia, 
         and Greece, it was not long before (on account of its warlike tenets and 
         the deeply magical nature of its rites<strong>*</strong>)  
       </p><blockquote><font size="-1"><strong>*</strong> Primitive Christianity had 
         a greater adaptability than any other contemporary religion of assimilating 
         to itself all that was more particularly pagan in polytheism; the result 
         being that it won over the great masses of the people, who then were, 
         as they are now, inherently conservative. </font></blockquote>
       it forced its head and then its arms above the shoulders of its weaker brothers; 
       and when once in a position to strike, so thoroughly bullied all competitors 
       that the few who inwardly stood outside the Church, {144} to save the bruised 
       skins of the faiths they still held dear, were, for self- preservation, 
       bound to clothe them in the tinsel of verbosity, in wild values and extravagant 
       symbols and cyphers; the result being that chaos was heaped upon chaos, 
       till at last all sense became cloaked in a truculent obscurantism. Still, 
       by him who has eyes will it be seen that through all this darkness there 
       shone the glamour of a great and beautiful Truth.  
       <p>Little is it to be wondered then, in these present shallow intellectual 
         days, that almost any one who has studied, or even heard of, the theories 
         of any notorious nobody of the moment at once relegates to the museum 
         or the waste-paper basket these theories and systems, which were once 
         the very blood of the world, and which in truth are so still, though few 
         suspect it.  
       </p><p>Truth is Truth; and the Truth of yesterday is the Truth of to-day, and 
         the Truth of to-day is the Truth of to- morrow. Our quest, then, is to 
         find Truth, and to cut the kernel from the husk, the text from the comment.  
       </p><p>To start from the beginning would appear the proper course to adopt; 
         but if we commence sifting the shingle from the sand with the year 10,000 
         B.C. there is little likelihood of our ever arriving within measurable 
         distance of the present day. Fortunately, however, for us, we need not 
         start with any period anterior to our own, or upon any subject outside 
         of our own true selves. But two things we must learn, if we are ever to 
         make ourselves intelligible to others, and these are, firstly an alphabet, 
         and secondly a language whereby to express our thoughts; for without some 
         definite system of expression our only course is to remain silent, lest 
         further confusion be added to the already bewildering chaos. {145}  
       </p><p>It will be at once said by any one who has read as far as this: "I lay 
         you whatever odds you name that the writer of this book will prove to 
         be the first offender!" And with all humility will we at once plead guilty 
         to this offence. Unfortunately it is so, and must at first be so; yet 
         if in the end we succeed in creating but the first letter of the new Alphabet 
         we shall not consider that we have failed; far from it, for we shall rejoice 
         that, the entangled threshold having been crossed, the goal, though distant, 
         is at last in sight.  
       </p><p>In a hospital a chart is usually kept for each patient, upon which may 
         be seen the exact progress, from its very commencement, of the case in 
         question. By it the doctor can daily judge the growth or decline of the 
         disease he is fighting. On Thursday, let us say, the patient's temperature 
         in 100°; in the evening he is given a cup of beef-tea (the patient 
         up to the present having been kept strictly on milk diet); on the following 
         morning the doctor finds that his temperature has risen to 102°, and 
         at once concludes that the fever has not yet sufficiently abated for a 
         definite change of diet to be adopted, and, "knocking off" the beef-tea, 
         down drops the temperature.  
       </p><p>Thus, if he be a worthy physician, he will study his patient, never overlooking 
         the seemingly most unimportant details which can help him to realise his 
         object, namely, recovery and health.  
       </p><p>Not only does this system of minute tabulation apply to cases of disease 
         and sickness, but to every branch of healthy life as well, under the name 
         of "business"; the best business man being he who reduces his special 
         occupation in life from "muddle" to "science."  
       </p><p>In the West religion alone has never issued from chaos; {146} and the 
         hour, late though it be, has struck when without fear or trembling adepts 
         have arisen to do for Faith what Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton did for 
         what is vulgarly known as "Science." And as Faith, growing old before 
         its day, held back Science with a cruel hand, so let us now, whilst Science 
         is still young, step briskly forward and claim our rights, lest if we 
         halt we too shall find the child of the Morning once again strangled in 
         the maw of a second Night.  
       </p><p>Now, even to such as are still mere students in the mysteries, it must 
         have become apparent that there are moments in the lives of others, if 
         not in their own, which bring with them an enormous sense of inner authority 
         and illumination; moments which created epochs in our lives, and which, 
         when they have gone, stand out as luminous peaks in the moonlight of the 
         past. Sad to say, they come but seldom, so seldom that often they are 
         looked back upon as miraculous visitations of some vastly higher power 
         beyond and outside of ourselves. But when they do come the greatest joys 
         of earth wither before them like dried leaves in the fire, and fade from 
         the firmament of our minds as the stars of night before the rising sun.  
       </p><p>Now, if it were possible to induce these states of ecstasy or hallucination, 
         or whatever we care to call them, at will, so to speak, we should have 
         accomplished what was once called, and what is still known as, the Great 
         Work, and have discovered the Stone of the Wise, that universal dissolvent. 
         Sorrow would cease and give way to joy, and joy to a bliss quite unimaginable 
         to all who have not as yet experienced it.  
       </p><p>St. John of the Cross, writing of the "intuitions" by which God reaches 
         the soul, says: {147}  
       </p><p>"They enrich us marvellously. A single one of them may be sufficient 
         to abolish at a stroke certain imperfections of which the soul during 
         its whole life has vainly tried to rid itself, and to leave it adorned 
         with virtues and loaded with supernatural gifts. A single one of the intoxicating 
         consolations may reward it for all the labours undergone in its life --- 
         even were they numberless. Invested with an invincible courage, filled 
         with an impassioned desire to suffer for its God, the soul then is seized 
         with a strange torment --- that of not being allowed to suffer enough."<strong>*</strong>  
       </p><blockquote><font size="-1"><strong>*</strong> "OEuvres," ii. 320. Prof. William 
         James writes: "The great Spanish mystics, who carried the habit of ecstasy 
         as far as it has often been carried, appear for the most part to have 
         shown indomitable spirit and energy, and all the more so for the trances 
         in which they indulged." </font>  
         <p><font size="-1">Writing of St. Ignatius, he says: "St. Ignatius was a 
           mystic, but his mysticism made him assuredly one of the most powerful 
           practical human engines that ever lived" ("The Varieties of Religious 
           Experience," p. 413). </font>

       In the old days, when but a small portion of the globe was known to civilised 
       man, the explorer and the traveller would return to his home with weird, 
       fantastic stories of long-armed hairy men, of impossible monsters, and countries 
       of fairy-like wonder. But he who travels now and who happens to see a gorilla, 
       or a giraffe, or perchance a volcano, forgets to mention it even in his 
       most casual correspondence! And why? Because he has learnt to understand 
       that such things are. He has named them, and, having done so, to him they 
       cease as objects of interest. In one respect he gives birth to a great truth, 
       which he at once cancels by giving birth to a great falsehood; for his reverence, 
       like his disdain, depends but on the value of a name.  
       <p>Not so, however, the adept; for as a zoologist does not lose {148} his 
         interest in the simian race because he has learnt to call a long-armed 
         hairy man a gorilla; so he, by learning to explain himself with clearness, 
         and to convey the image of his thoughts with accuracy to the brain of 
         another, is winnowing the wheat from the chaff, the Truth from the Symbol 
         of Truth.  
       </p><p>Now when St. John of the Cross tells us that a single vision of God may 
         reward us for all the labours of this life, we are at perfect liberty, 
         in these tolerant days, to cry "Yea!" or "Nay!" We may go further: we 
         may extol St. John to the position of a second George Washington, or we 
         may call him "a damned liar!" or, again, if we do not wish to be considered 
         rude, a "neuropath," or some other equally amiable synonym. But none of 
         these expressions explains to us very much; they are all equally vague 
         --- nay (curious to relate!), even mystical --- and as such appertain 
         to the Kingdom of Zoroaster, that realm of pure faith: <em>i.e.</em>, 
         faith in St. John, or faith in something opposite to St. John.  
       </p><p>But now let us borrow from Pyrrho --- the Sceptic, the keen-sighted man 
         of science --- that word "WHY," and apply it to our "Yea" and our "Nay," 
         just as a doctor questions himself and the patient about the disease; 
         and we shall very soon find that we are being drawn to a logical conclusion, 
         or at least to a point from which such a conclusion becomes possible.<strong>*</strong>

       or the science of learning how not to say "Yes" until you know that it <em>is</em> 
       YES, and how not to say "No" until you know that it <em>is</em> NO. It is 
       the all-important word of our lives, the corner- stone of the Temple, the 
       keystone of the arch, the flail that beats the grain from the chaff, the 
       sieve through which Falsehood passes and in which Truth remains. It is, 
       indeed, the poise of the balance, the gnomon of the sun-dial; which, if 
       we learn to read aright, will tell us at what hour of our lives we have 
       arrived.  
       <p>Through the want of it kingdoms have fallen into decay and by it empires

         a dogmatist, a potential, if not an actual liar. And it is for this reason

         the present- day rationalist<strong>*</strong>

         superficial. It is the part that has the "prestige" undoubtedly, for it 
         has the loquacity, it can challenge you for proofs, and chop logic, and 
         put you down with words. But it will fail to convince or convert you all 
         the same, if your dumb intuitions are opposed to its conclusions. If you 
         have intuitions at all, they come from a deeper level of your nature than 
         the loquacious level which rationalism inhabits." --- "The Varieties of

       when we attack him. For we see he is doing for Darwin, Huxley, and Spencer 
       what the early Christian did for Jesus, Peter, and Paul; and that is, that 
       he, having already idealised them, is now in the act of apotheosising them. 
       Soon, if left unattacked, will <em>their</em> word become THE WORD, and 
       in the place of the "Book of Genesis" shall we have the "Origin of Species," 
       and in the place of the Christian accepting as Truth the word of Jesus shall 
       we have the Rationalist accepting as Truth the word of Darwin.  
       <p>But what of the true man of science? say you; those doubting men who 
         silently work in their laboratories, accepting no theory, however wonderful 
         it may be, until theory has given birth to fact. We agree --- but what 
         of the Magi? answer we; the few fragments of whose wisdom which escaped 
         the Christian flames will stand in the eyes of all men as a wonder. It 
         was the Christians who slew the magic of Christ, and so will it be, if 
         they are allowed to live,  
       </p><p>the Rationalists who will slay the magic of Darwin; so that four hundred 
         years hence perchance will some disciple of Lamarck {151} be torn to pieces 
         in the rooms of the Royal Society by the followers of Haeckel, just as 
         Hypatia, that disciple of Plato, was torn to pieces in the Church of Christ 
         by followers of St. John.  
       </p><p>We have nothing to say against the men of science, we have nothing to 
         say against the great Mystics --- all hail to both! But such of their 
         followers who accepted the doctrines of either the one or the other as 
         a dogma we here openly pronounce to be a bane, a curse, and a pestilence 
         to mankind.  
       </p><p>Why assume that only one system of ideas can be true? And when you have 
         answered this question there will be time enough to assume that all other 
         systems are wrong. Start with a clean sheet, and write neatly and beautifully 
         upon it, so that others can read you aright; do not start with some old 
         palimpsest, and then scribble all over it carelessly, for then indeed 
         others will come who will of a certainty ready you awry.  
       </p><p>If Osiris, Christ, and Mahomet were mad, then indeed is madness the key 
         to the door of the Temple. Yet if they were only called mad for being 
         wise beyond the sane, then ask you why their doctrines brought with them 
         the crimes of bigotry and the horrors of madness? And our answer is, that 
         though they loved Truth and wedded Truth, they could not explain Truth; 
         and their disciples therefore had to accept the symbols of Truth for Truth, 
         without the possibility of asking "Why?" or else reject Truth altogether. 
         Thus it came about that the greater the Master the less was he able to 
         explain himself, and the more obscure his explanations the darker became 
         the minds of his followers. It was the old story of the light that blinded 
         the darkness. You can teach a bushman to add one to one, and he may after 
         some teaching grasp the idea of "two"; but do not try to tech him the 
         {152} differential calculus! The former may be compared to the study of 
         the physical sciences, the latter to that of the mental; therefore all 
         the more should we persevere to work out correctly the seemingly most 
         absurd, infinitesimal differences, and perchance one day, when we have 
         learnt how to add unit to unit, a million and a millionth part of a unit 
         will be ours.  
       </p><p>We will now conclude this part of our preface with two long quotations 
         from Prof. James's excellent book; the first of which, slightly abridged, 
         is as follows:  
       </p><p>"It is the terror and beauty of phenomena, the 'promise' of the dawn 
         and of the rainbow, the 'voice' of the thunder, the 'gentleness' of the 
         summer rain, the 'sublimity' of the stars, and not the physical laws which 
         these things follow, by which the religious mind still continues to be 
         most impressed; and just as of yore the devout man tells you that in the 
         solitude of his room or of the fields he still feels the divine presence, 
         and that sacrifices to this unseen reality fill him with security and 
         peace.  
       </p><p>"Pure anachronism! says the survival-theory; --- anachronism for which 
         deanthropomorphization of the imagination is the remedy required. The 
         less we mix the private with the cosmic, the more we dwell in universal 
         in impersonal terms, the truer heirs of Science we become.  
       </p><p>"In spite of the appeal which this impersonality of the scientific attitude 
         makes to a certain magnanimity of temper, I believe it to be shallow, 
         and I can now state my reason in comparatively few words. That reason 
         is that, so long as we deal with the cosmic and the general, we deal only 
         with the symbols of reality, but <em>as soon as we deal with the private 
         and personal phenomena as such, we deal with realities in the</em> {153} 
         <em>completest sense of the term.</em> I think I can easily make clear 
         what I mean by these words.  
       </p><p>"The world of our experience consists at all times of two parts, an objective 
         and a subjective part, of which the former may be incalculably more extensive 
         than the latter, and yet the latter can never be omitted or suppressed. 
         The objective part is the sum total of whatsoever at any given time we 
         may be thinking of, the subjective part is the inner 'state' in which 
         the thinking comes to pass. What we think of may be enormous -- the cosmic 
         times and spaces, for example --- whereas the inner state may be the most 
         fugitive and paltry activity of mind. Yet the cosmic objects, so far as 
         the experience yields them, are but ideal pictures of something whose 
         existence we do not inwardly possess, but only point at outwardly, while 
         the inner state is our very experience itself; its reality and that of 
         our experience are one. A conscious field <em>plus</em> its object as 
         felt or thought of <em>plus</em> an attitude towards the object <em>plus</em> 
         the sense of a self to whom the attitude belongs --- such a concrete bit 
         of personal experience may be a small bit, but it is a solid bit as long 
         as it lasts; not hollow, not a mere abstract element of experience, such 
         as the 'object' is when taken all alone. It is a <em>full</em> fact, even 
         though it be an insignificant fact; it is of the <em>kind</em> to which 
         all realities whatsoever must belong; the motor currents of the world 
         run through the like of it; it is on the line connecting real events with 
         real events. That unshareable feeling which each one of us has of the 
         pinch of his individual destiny as he privately feels it rolling out on 
         fortune's wheel may be disparaged for its egotism, may be sneered at as 
         unscientific, but it is the one thing that fills up the measure of our 
         concrete actuality, {154} and any would-be existence that should lack 
         such a feeling, or its analogue, would be a piece of reality only half 
         made up.  
       </p><p>"If this be true, it is absurd for science to say that the egotistic 
         elements of experience should be suppressed. The axis of reality runs 
         solely through the egotistic places --- they are strung upon it like so 
         many beads. To describe the world with all the various feelings of the 
         individual pinch of destiny, all the various spiritual attitudes, left 
         out from the description --- they being as describable as anything else 
         --- would be something like offering a printed bill of fare as the equivalent 
         for a solid meal. Religion makes no such blunders. ... A bill of fare 
         with one real raisin on it instead of the word 'raisin' and one real egg 
         instead of the word 'egg' might be an inadequate meal, but it would at 
         least be a commencement of reality. The contention of the survival-theory 
         that we ought to stick to non-personal elements exclusively seems like 
         saying that we ought to be satisfied forever with reading the naked bill 
         of fare. . . . It does not follow, because our ancestors made so many 
         errors of fact and mixed them with their religion, that we should therefore 
         leave off being religious at all. By being religious we establish ourselves 
         in possession of ultimate reality at the only points at which reality 
         is given us to guard. Our responsible concern is with our private destiny 
         after all." <strong>*</strong>

       "We must next pass beyond the point of view of merely subjective utility, 
       and make inquiry into the intellectual content itself.  
       <p>"First, is there, under all the discrepancies of the creeds, {155} a 
         common nucleus to which they bear their testimony unanimously?  
       </p><p>"And second, ought we to consider the testimony true?  
       </p><p>"I will take up the first question first, and answer it immediately in 
         the affirmative. The warring gods and formulas of the various religions 
         do indeed cancel each other, but there is a certain uniform deliverance 
         in which religions all appear to meet. It consists of two parts:  
       </p><p>"(1) An uneasiness; and  
       </p><p>"(2) Its solution.  
       </p><p>"1. The uneasiness, reduced to its simplest terms, is a sense that there 
         is <em>something wrong about us</em> as we naturally stand.  
       </p><p>"2. The solution is a sense that <em>we are saved from the wrongness</em> 
         by making proper connection with the higher powers.  
       </p><p>"In those more developed minds which alone we are studying, the wrongness 
         takes a moral character, and the salvation takes a mystical tinge. I think 
         we shall keep well within the limits of what is common to all such minds 
         if we formulate the essence of their religious experience in terms like 
         these:  
       </p><p>"The individual, so far as he suffers from his wrongness and criticises 
         it, is to that extent consciously beyond it, and in at least possible 
         touch with something higher, if anything higher exist. Along with the 
         wrong part there is thus a better part of him, even though it may be but 
         a most helpless germ. With which part he should identify his real being 
         is by no means obvious at this stage; but when Stage 2 (the stage of solution 
         or salvation) arrives, the man identifies his real being with the germinal 
         higher part of himself; and does {156} so in the following way: <em>He 
         becomes conscious that this higher part is conterminous and continuous 
         with a MORE of the same quality, which is operative in the universe outside 
         of him, and which he can keep in working touch with, and in a fashion 
         get on board of and save himself when all his lower being has gone to 
         pieces in the wreck"</em> <strong>*</strong>

       <p>These last few lines bring us face to face with the subject of this volume, 
         viz.: ---  
       </p><center>
         <h3> FRATER P. </h3>
       </center>
       To enter upon a somewhat irrelevant matter, this is what actually happened 
       to the complier of this book:  
       <p>For ten years he had been a sceptic, in that sense of the word which 
         is generally conveyed by the terms infidel, atheist, and freethinker; 
         then suddenly, in a single moment, he withdrew all the scepticism with 
         which he had assailed religion, and hurled it against freethought itself; 
         and as the former had crumbled into dust, so now the latter vanished in 
         smoke.  
       </p><p>In this crisis there was no sickness of soul, no division of self; for 
         he simply had turned a corner on the road along which he was travelling 
         and suddenly became aware of the fact that the mighty range of snow-capped 
         mountains upon which he had up to now fondly imagined he was gazing was 
         after all but a great bank of clouds. So he passed on smiling to himself 
         at his own childlike illusion.  
       </p><p>Shortly after this he became acquainted with a certain brother of the 
         Order of A.·. A.·.; and himself a little later became an 
         initiate in the first grade of that Order.  
       </p><p>In this Order, at the time of his joining it, was a certain {157} brother 
         of the name of P., who had but just returned from China, and who had been 
         six years before sent out by the Order to journey through all the countries 
         of the world and collect all knowledge possible in the time which touched 
         upon the mystical experiences of mankind. This P. had to the best of his 
         ability done, and though he had only sojourned in Europe, in Egypt, India, 
         Ceylon, China, Burma, Arabia, Siam, Tibet, Japan, Mexico, and the United 
         States of America, so deep had been his study and so exalted had been 
         his understanding that it was considered by the Order that he had collected 
         sufficient material and testimony whereon to compile a book for the instruction 
         of mankind. And as Frater N.S.F. was a writer of some little skill, the 
         diaries and notes of Frater P. were given to him and another, and they 
         were enjoined to set them together in such a manner that they would be 
         an aid to the seeker in the mysteries, and would be as a tavern on a road 
         beset with many dangers and difficulties, wherein the traveller can find 
         good cheer and wine that strengtheneth and refresheth the soul.  
       </p><p>It is therefore earnestly hoped that this book will become as a refuge 
         to all, where a guide may be hired or instructions freely sought; but 
         the seeker is requested --- nay, commanded --- with all due solemnity 
         by the Order of the A.·. A.·. to accept nothing as Truth 
         until he has proved it so to be, to his own satisfaction and to his own 
         honour.  
       </p><p>And it is further hoped that he may, upon closing this book, be somewhat 
         enlightened, and, even if as through a glass darkly, see the great shadow 
         of Truth beyond, and one day enter the Temple.  
       </p><p>So much for the subject; now for the object of this volume: {158}

       "Lytton calls him Adonai in 'Zanoni,' and I often use this name in the note-books.  
       <p>"Abramelin calls him Holy Guardian Angel. I adopt this:  
       </p><p>"1. Because Abramelin's system is so simple and effective.  
       </p><p>"2. Because since <em>all</em> theories of the universe are absurd it 
         is better to talk in the language of one which is patently absurd, so

         crying aloud. Also there is the vision of the fire-flashing Courser of 
         Light, or also a Child, borne aloft on the shoulders of the Celestial 
         Steed, fiery, or clothed with gold, or naked, or shooting with the bow 
         shafts of Light, and standing on the shoulders of the horse; then if thy 
         meditation prolongeth itself, thou shalt unite all these symbols into

       and the Door of the Path of His overshadowing, He is also in Kether (Kether 
       is in Malkuth and Malkuth in Kether --- "as above, so beneath"), and the 
       End of the "Path of the Wise" is identity with Him.

         <h3> THE BOOK </h3>
       </center>
       This Book is divided into four parts: {160}  <br>
         
       <ul>
         I. The Foundations of the Temple.  
         <p>II. The Scaffolding of the Temple.  
         </p><p>III. The Portal of the Temple.  
         </p><p>IV. The Temple of Solomon the King. 
       </p></ul>
       Three methods of expression are used to enlighten and instruct the reader:  
       <br>
         
       <ul>
         (<em>a</em>) Pictorial symbols.  
         <p>(<em>b</em>) Metaphorically expressed word-pictures.  
         </p><p>(<em>c</em>) Scientifically expressed facts. 
       </p></ul>
       The first method is found appended to each of the four Books, balancing, 
       so to speak, Illuminism and Science.  
       <p>The second method is found almost entirely in the first Book and the 
         various pictures are entitled: <strong>*</strong>  
       </p><blockquote><font size="-1"><strong>*</strong> Nine pictures between Darkness 
         and Light, or eleven in all. The union of the Pentagram and the Hexagram 
         is to be noted; also the eleven-lettered name ABRAHADABRA; 418; Achad 
         Osher, or One and Ten; the Eleven Averse Sephiroth; and Adonai. </font></blockquote>
       The Black Watch-tower, or the Dreamer.  
       <p>The Miser, or the Theist.  
       </p><p>The Spendthrift, or the Pantheist.  
       </p><p>The Bankrupt, or the Atheist.  
       </p><p>The Prude, or the Rationalist.  
       </p><p>The Child, or the Mystic.  
       </p><p>The Wanton, or the Sceptic.  
       </p><p>The Slave, or he who stands before the veil of the Outer Court.  
       </p><p>The Warrior, or he who stands before the veil of the Inner Court.  
       </p><p>The King, or he who stands before the veil of the Abyss.  
       </p><p>The White Watch-tower, or the Awakened One. {161}  
       </p><p>The third method is found almost entirely in the second Book.  
       </p><p>The third and fourth Books of this essay consist of purely symbolic pictures. 
         For the Key of the Portal the neophyte must discover for himself; and 
         until he finds the Key the Temple of Solomon the King must remain closed 
         to him.

       WHO has not, at some period during his life, experienced that strange sensation 
       of utter bewilderment on being awakened by the sudden approach of a bright 
       light across the curtained threshold of slumber; that intoxicating sense 
       of wonderment, that hopeless inability to to open wide the blinded eyes 
       before the dazzling flame which has swept night into the corners and crannies 
       of the dark bedchamber of sleep?  
       <p>Who, again, has not stepped from the brilliant sunlight of noon into 
         some shadowy vault, and, groping along its dark walls, has found all there 
         to be but as the corpse of day wrapped in a starless shroud of darkness?  
       </p><p>Yet as the moments speed by the sight grows accustomed to the dazzling 
         intruder; and as the blinding, shimmering web of silver which he has thrown 
         around us melts like a network of snow before the awakening fire of our 
         eyes, we perceive that the white flame of bewilderment which had but a 
         moment ago enwrapped us as a mantle of lightnings, is, but in truth, a 
         flickering rushlight fitfully expiring in an ill-shapen socket of clay. 
         And likewise in the darkness, as we pass along the unlit arches of the 
         vault, or the lampless recesses which, toad-like, squat here and there 
         in the gloom, dimly at first do the mouldings of the roof and the cornices 
         of the {167} walls creep forth; and then, as the twilight becomes more 
         certain, do they twist and writhe into weirdly shapen arabesques, into 
         fanciful figures, and contorted faces; which, as we advance, bat-like 
         flit into the depths of a deeper darkness beyond.  
       </p><p>Stay! --- and but for a moment hurry back, and bring with you that little 
         rushlight we left spluttering on the mantel-shelf of sleep. Now all once 
         again vanishes, and from the floor before us jut up into the shadowland 
         of darkness the stern grey walls of rock, the age-worn architraves, the 
         clustered columns, and all the crumbling capitols of Art, where the years 
         alone sit shrouded slumbering in their dust and mould --- a haunting memory 
         of long-forgotten days.  
       </p><p>O dreamland of wonder and mystery! like a tongue of gold wrapped in a 
         blue flame do we hover for a moment over the Well of Life; and then the 
         night-wind rises, and wafts us into the starless depths of the grave. 
         We are like gnats hovering in the sunbeams, and then the evening falls 
         and we are gone: and who can tell whither, and unto what end? Whether 
         to the City of Eternal Sleep, or to the Mansion of the Music of Rejoicing?  
       </p><p>O my brothers! come with me! follow me! Let us mount the dark stairs 
         of this Tower of Silence, this Watch-tower of Night; upon whose black 
         brow no flickering flame burns to guide the weary wanderer across the 
         mires of life and through the mists of death. Come, follow me! Grope up 
         these age-worn steps, slippery with the tears of the fallen, and bearded 
         with the blood of the vanquished and the salt of the agony of failure. 
         Come, come! Halt not! Abandon all! Let us ascend. Yet bring with ye two 
         things, the flint and the steel {168} --- the slumbering fire of Mystery, 
         and the dark sword of Science; that we may strike a spark, and fire the 
         beacon of Hope which hangs above us in the brasier of Despair; so that 
         a great light may shine forth through the darkness, and guide the toiling 
         footsteps of man to that Temple which is built without hands, fashioned 
         without iron, or gold, or silver, and in which no fire burns; whose pillars 
         are as columns of light, whose dome is as a crown of effulgence set betwixt 
         the wings of Eternity, and upon whose altar flashes the mystic eucharist 
         of God. {169}

         <h2> THE MISER </h2>
       </center>
       "GOD." What a treasure-house of wealth lies buried in that word! what a 
       mine of precious stones! --- Ptah, Father of Beginnings, he who created 
       the Sun and the Moon; Nu, blue, starry lady of Heaven, mistress and mother 
       of the gods; Ea, Lord of the Deep; Istar --- "O Thou who art set in the 
       sky as a jewelled circlet of moonstone"; Brahma the golden, Vishnu the sombre, 
       and Siva the crimson, lapped in seas of blood. Everywhere do we find Thee, 
       O Thou one and awful Eidolon, who as Aormuzd once didst rule the sun-scorched 
       plains of Euphrates, and as Odin the icy waves and the shrieking winds, 
       round the frozen halls of the North.  
       <p>Everywhere! --- everywhere! And yet now Thou art again God, nameless 
         to the elect --- O Thou vast inscrutable Pleroma built in the Nothingness 
         of our imagination! --- and to the little ones, the children who play 
         with the units of existence, but a myriad-named doll a cubit high, a little 
         thing to play with --- or else: an ancient, bearded Father, with hair 
         as white as wool, and eyes like flames of fire; whose voice is as the 
         sound of many waters, in whose right hand tremble the seven stars of Heaven, 
         and out of whose mouth flashes forth a flaming sword of fire. There dost 
         Thou sit counting the orbs of Space, and the souls of men: and we tremble 
         before Thee, {170} worshipping, glorifying, supplicating, beseeching; 
         lest perchance Thou cast us back into the furnace of destruction, and 
         place us not among the gold and silver of Thy treasury.  
       </p><p>True, Thou hast been the great Miser of the worlds, and the Balances 
         of Thy treasure-house have weighed out Heaven and Hell. Thou hast amassed 
         around Thee the spoil of the years, and the plunder of Time and of Space. 
         All is Thine, and we own not even the breath of our nostrils, for it is 
         but given us on the usury of our lives.  
       </p><p>Still from the counting-house of Heaven Thou hast endowed us with a spirit 
         of grandeur, an imagination of the vastness of Being. Thou hast taken 
         us out of ourselves, and we have counted with Thee the starry hosts of 
         night, and unbraided the tangled tresses of the comets in the fields of 
         Space. We have walked with Thee at Mamre, and talked with Thee in Eden, 
         and listened to Thy voice from out the midst of the whirlwind. And at 
         times Thou hast been a Father unto us, a joy, strong as a mighty draught 
         of ancient wine, and we have welcomed Thee!  
       </p><p>But Thy servants --- those self-seeking, priestly usurers --- See! how 
         they have blighted the hearts of men, and massed the treasure of Souls 
         into the hands of the few, and piled up the coffers of the Church. How 
         they racked from us the very emblems of joy, putting out our eyes with 
         the hot irons of extortion, till every pound of human flesh was soaked 
         as a thirsty sponge in a well of blood: and life became a hell, and men 
         and women went singing, robed in the <em>san-benito</em> painted with 
         flames and devils, to the stake; to seek in the fire the God of their 
         forefathers --- that stern Judge who with sworded hand was once wont to 
         read out the names of the living from {171} the Book of Life, and exalt 
         the humble on the golden throne of tyrants.  
       </p><p>Yet in these ages of crucifix, of skull, and of candle; these ages of 
         <em>auto-da-fe</em> and <em>in pace;</em> these ages when the tongue jabbered 
         madness and the brain reeled in delirium, and the bones were split asunder, 
         and the flesh was crushed to pulp, was there still in the darkness a glamour 
         of truth, as a great and scarlet sunset seen through the memory of years. 
         Life was a shroud of horror, yet it was life! Life! life in the awful 
         hideous grandeur of gloom, until death severed the dull red thread with 
         a crooked sword of cruel flame. And Love, a wild, mad ecstasy, broken-winged, 
         fluttering before the eyeless sockets of Evil, as the souls of men were 
         bought and sold and bartered for, till Heaven became a bauble of the rich, 
         and Hell a debtor's dungeon for the poor. Yet amongst those rotting bones 
         in the <em>oubliette</em>, and in those purple palaces of papal lust, 
         hovered that spirit of life, like a golden flame rolled in a cloud of 
         smoke over the dark altar of decay.  
       </p><p>Listen: "Have you got religion? ... Are you saved? ... Do you love Jesus?" 
         ... "Brother, God can save you. ... Jesus is the sinner's friend. ... 
         Rest your head on Jesus ... dear, dear Jesus!" Curse till thunder shake 
         the stars! curse till this blasphemy is cursed from the face of heaven! 
         curse till the hissing name of Jesus, which writhes like a snake in a 
         snare, is driven from the kingdom of faith! Once "Eloi, Eloi, Lamma Sabachthani" 
         echoed through the gloom from the Cross of Agony; now Jerry McAuley, that 
         man of God, ill-clothed in cheap Leeds shoddy, bobbing in a tin Bethel, 
         bellows, "Do you love Jesus?" and talks of that mystic son of Him who 
         set forth the sun and the moon, and {172} all the hosts of Heaven, as 
         if he were first cousin to Mrs. Booth or to Aunt Sally herself.  
       </p><p>Once man in the magic land of mystery sought the elixir and the balsam 
         of life; now he seeks "spiritual milk for American babes, drawn from the 
         breasts of both Testaments." Once man, in his frenzy, drunken on the wine 
         of Iacchus, would cry to the moon from the ruined summit of some temple 
         of Zagraeus, "Evoe ho! Io Evoe!" But now instead, "Although I was quite 
         full of drink, I knew that God's work begun in me was not going to be 
         wasted!"  
       </p><p>Thus is the name of God belched forth in beer and bestial blasphemy. 
         Who would not rather be a St. Besarion who spent forty days and nights 
         in a thorn-bush, or a St. Francis picking lice from his sheepskin and 
         praising God for the honour and glory of wearing such celestial pearls 
         in his habit, than become a smug, well-oiled evangelical Christian genteel-man, 
         walking to church to dear Jesus on a Sabbath morning, with Prayer-book, 
         Bible, and umbrella, and a three- penny-bit in his glove? {173}

         <h2> THE SPENDTHRIFT </h2>
       </center>
       "ARCADIA, night, a cloud, Pan, and the moon." What words to conjure with, 
       what five shouts to slay the five senses, and set a leaping flame of emerald 
       and silver dancing about us as we yell them forth under the oaks and over 
       the rocks and myrtle of the hill-side. "Bruised to the breast of Pan" --- 
       let us flee church, and chapel, and meeting-room; let us abandon this mantle 
       of order, and leap back to the heaths, and the marshes, and the hills; back 
       to the woods, and the glades of night! back to the old gods, and the ruddy 
       lips of Pan!  
       <p>How the torches splutter in the storm, pressing warm kisses of gold on 
         the gnarled and knotted trunks of the beech trees! How the fumigation 
         from musk and myrrh whirls up in an aromatic cloud from the glowing censer! 
         --- how for a time it greedily clings to the branches, and then is wafted 
         to the stars! Look! --- as we invoke them, how they gather round us, these 
         Spirit of Love and of Life, of Passion, of Strength, and of Abandon --- 
         these sinews of the manhood of the World!  
       </p><p>O mystery of mysteries! "For each one of the Gods is in all, and all 
         are in each, being ineffably united to each other and to God; because 
         each, being a super-essential unity, their {174} conjunction with each 
         other is a union of unities." Hence each is all; thus Nature squanders 
         the gold and silver of our understanding, till in panic frenzy we beat 
         our head on the storm-washed boulders and the blasted trunks, and shout 
         forth, "Io ... Io ... Io ... Evoe! Io ... Io!" till the glades thrill 
         as with the music of syrinx an sistrum, and our souls are rent asunder 
         on the flaming horns of Pan.  
       </p><p>Come, O children of the night of Death, awake, arise! See, the sun is 
         nodding in the West, and no day-spring is at hand in this land of withered 
         dreams; for all is dull with the sweat of gloom, and sombre with the industry 
         of Evil! Wake! O wake! Let us hie to the summits of the lonely mountains, 
         for soon a sun will arise in us, and then their white peaks will become 
         golden and crimson and purple as the breasts of a mighty woman swollen 
         with the blood and milk of a new life. There, amongst those far-off hills 
         of amethyst, shall we find the fair mistress of our heart's desire --- 
         that bountiful Mother who will clasp us to her breast.  
       </p><p>Yours are the boundless forests, and the hills, and the far-off purple 
         of the horizon. Call, and they shall answer you; ask, and they shall shower 
         forth on you the hoarded booty of the years, and all the treasure of the 
         ages; so that none shall be in need, and all shall possess all in the 
         longing for all things. Come, let us shatter the vault of Circumstance 
         and the walls of the dungeon of Convention, and back to Pan in the tangled 
         brakes, and to the subtle beauty of the Sorceress, and to the shepherd-lads 
         --- back to the white flocks on the hill-side, back to Pan --- to Pan 
         --- to Pan! Io! to Pan.  
       </p><p>Under the mistletoe and the oak there is no snickering of the chapel-pew, 
         no drawing-room grin of lewd desire, no {175} smacking of wanton lips 
         over the warm flesh and the white skin of life; but a great shout of joyous 
         laughter arises, which sways the winds from their appointed courses, and 
         rattles down the dead branches from the leafy boughs overhead: or, all 
         is solemn and still as a breathless night; for here life is ever manly 
         in turmoil as in repose.  
       </p><p>Here there is no barter, no usury, no counting of the gains and losses 
         of life; and the great Sower leaps over the fields like a madman, casting 
         forth the golden grain amongst the briars, and on the rocks, as well as 
         between the black furrows of the earth; for each must take its chance, 
         and battle to victory in manliness and strength. Here there is neither 
         sect nor faction: live or die, prosper or decay! So the great live, and 
         the little ones go back to the roots of life. Neither is their obedience 
         outside the obedience which is born of Necessity; for here there is no 
         support, no resting on others --- ploughshares are beaten into swords, 
         and spindles are fashioned into the shafts of arrows, and the winds shriek 
         through our armour as we battle for the strength of the World.  
       </p><p>The rain falleth upon the deserts as upon the fertile valleys; and the 
         sun shineth upon the blue waters as upon the verdant fields; and the dew 
         heedeth not where it sleepeth, whether on the dung-hill, or betwixt the 
         petals of the wild rose; for all is lavish in this Temple of the World, 
         where on the throne of inexhaustible wealth sits the King of Life, tearing 
         the jewels from his golden throat, and casting them out to the winds to 
         be carried to the four corners of the Earth. There is no thrift here, 
         no storing up for the morrow; and yet there is no waste, no wantonness, 
         for all who enter {176} this Treasure-house of Life become one with the 
         jewels of the treasury.  
       </p><p>Words! ... words! ... words! They have shackled and chained you, O children 
         of the mists and the mountains; they have imprisoned you, and walled you 
         up in the dungeon of a lightless reason. Fancy has been burnt at the stake 
         of Fact; and the imagination cramped in the irons of tort and quibble. 
         O vanity of vain words! O cozening, deceitful art! Nimbly do the great 
         ones of to-day wrestle with the evil-smelling breath of their mouths, 
         twisting and contorting it into beguilements, bastardising and corrupting 
         the essence of things, sucking as a greedy vampire the blood from your 
         hearts, and breathing into your nostrils the rigid symbols of law and 
         of order, begotten on the death-bed of their understanding.  
       </p><p>O children of Wonder and of Fancy, fly to the wild woods whilst yet there 
         is time! Back to the mysteries of the shadowy oaks, to the revolt of imagination, 
         to the insurrection of souls, to the moonlit festivals of love: back where 
         the werewolf lurks, and the moonrakes prowl. Back, O back to the song 
         of life, back to the great God Pan! And there, wrapped in your goat-skins, 
         drink with the shepherds of Tammuz out of the skin of a suckling yet unborn, 
         and ye shall become as the silver-gleaming waters of Istar --- pure and 
         bright! Speed, for he is the divine king of the fauns and the satyrs, 
         the dryads and the oreads; the Lord of the Crowns; the Decider of Destiny; 
         the God who prospers all above and beneath! And tarry not, lest as ye 
         wander along the shore of the Ionian Sea ye hear a voice of lamentation 
         crying, "Great Pan is dead!" {177}  
       </p><center>
         <h2> THE BANKRUPT </h2>
       </center>
       O WHERE are the terraced gardens of Babylon, with their mighty groves towering 
       up amongst the clouds? O where is the sun-god of Rhodes, whose golden brow 
       was wont to blush with the first fire of dawn, whilst yet the waters at 
       his feet were wrapped in the mists of night? O where is the Temple of Ephesus, 
       and those who cried unto Diana? O where is the gleaming eye of Pharos that 
       shone as a star of hope over the wild waters of the sea? Children of monsters 
       and of gods, how have ye fallen! for a whirlwind hath arisen and swept through 
       the gates of Heaven, and rushed down on the kingdoms of Earth, and as a 
       tongue of consuming flame hath it licked up the handicrafts of man and cloaked 
       all in the dust of decay. A yoke hath been laid on the shoulders of the 
       ancient lands; and where once the white feet of Semiramis gleamed amongst 
       the lilies and roses of Babylon there now the wild goats leap, and browse 
       the sparse rank grass which sprouts in tufts from the red and yellow sand- 
       heaps, those silent memorial mounds which mark the spot where once stood 
       palaces of marble, and of jasper, and of jade. O woe! O woe! for all is 
       dust and ruin; the flood- gates of the years have been opened, and Time 
       has swept away as a mighty wind the embattled castles of kings with the 
       mud-daubed {178} huts of shepherds. Merodach has gone, and so has Ea, and 
       no longer doth Istar flame in the night, or cast down her kisses on the 
       sparkling goblets in the palace of Belshazzar. Isis, dark-veiled, hath departed, 
       and Nu no longer uplifteth the Sun-bark with the breath of dawn. O Amen, 
       bull fair of face, where is thy glory? Thebes is in ruins! O Lord of joy, 
       O mighty one of diadems! The Sekhet crown has fallen from thy brow, and 
       the strength of thy life hath departed, and thine eyes are as the shrouded 
       shadows of night. Olympus is but a barren hill, and Asgard a land of sullen 
       dreams. Alone in the desert of years still crouches the Sphinx, unanswered, 
       unanswerable, inscrutable, age-worn, coeval with the aeons of eld; even 
       facing the east and thirsting for the first rays of the rising sun. She 
       was there when Cheops and Khephren builded the pyramids, and there will 
       she sit when Yahveh has taken his appointed seat in the silent halls of 
       Oblivion.  
       <p>The fool hath said in his heart, "There is no God!" Yet the wise man 
         has sat trembling over the ruins of the past, and has watched with fearful 
         eyes the bankruptcy of Splendour, and all the glory of man fall victim 
         to the usury of Time.  
       </p><p>O God, what art Thou that Thou dost abandon the kingdoms of this world, 
         as a wanton woman her nightly lovers; and that they depart from Thee, 
         and remember and regret Thee not? Yet thou art so vast that I cannot grasp 
         Thee; Time flees before Thee, and Space is as a bauble in thine hands. 
         O monstrous vacancy of vastness! Thou surpassest me, and I am lost in 
         the contemplation of Thy greatness.  
       </p><p>The old gods slew Ymer the giant; and from his blood they poured out 
         the seas; and from his flesh they dug the {179} land; and the rocks were 
         fashioned out of his bones; and Asgard, fair dwelling-house of gods, was 
         builded from the brows of his eyes; and from his skull was wrought the 
         purple vault of Immensity; and from his brains were woven the fleecy clouds 
         of heaven. But thou art more than Ymer; Thy feet are planted deeper than 
         the roots of Igdrasil, and the hair of Thine head sweepeth past the helm 
         of thought. Nay, more, vastly more; for Thou art bloodless, and fleshless, 
         and without bones; Thou (O my God!) art nothing --- nothing that I can 
         grasp can span Thee. Yea! nothing art Thou, beyond the Nothingness of 
         the Nothingness of Eternity!  
       </p><p>Thus men grew to believe in NO-GOD, and to worship NO- GOD, and to be 
         persecuted for NO-GOD, and to suffer and to die for NO-GOD. And now they 
         torture themselves for him, as they had of yore gashed themselves with 
         flints at the footstool of God His Father; and to the honour of His name, 
         and as a proof of His existence, have they not built up great towers of 
         Science, bastions of steam and of flame, and set a-singing the wheels 
         of Progress, and all the crafts and the guiles and the artifices of Knowledge? 
         They have contained the waters with their hands; and the earth they have 
         set in chains; and the fire they have bound up as a wisp of undried straw; 
         even the winds they have ensnared as an eagle in a net; --- yet the Spirit 
         liveth and is free, and they know it not, as they gaze down from their 
         Babel of Words upon the soot-grimed fields, and the felled forests, and 
         the flowerless banks of their rivers of mud, lit by the sun which glows 
         red through the hooded mists of their magic.  
       </p><p>Yet he who gazeth into the heavens, and crieth in a loud voice, "There 
         is NO-GOD," is as a prophet unto mankind; {180} for he is as one drunken 
         on the vastness of Deity. Better to have no opinion of God than such an 
         opinion as is unworthy of Him. Better to be wrapped in the black robe 
         of unbelief than to dance in the stinking rags of blasphemy. So they learnt 
         to cry, "For the children, belief and obedience; for us men, solitude" 
         --- the monarchy of Mind, the pandemoniacal majesty of Matter!  
       </p><p>"A Bible on the centre-table in a cottage pauperises the monarchical 
         imagination of man"; but a naked woman weeping in the wilderness, or singing 
         songs of frenzy unto Istar in the night, from the ruined summit of Nineveh, 
         invoking the elemental powers of the Abyss, and casting the dust of ages 
         about her, and crying unto Bel, and unto Assur, and unto Nisroch, and 
         smiting flames from the sun-scorched bones of Sennacherib with the age-worn 
         sword of Sharezer and Adrammelech, is a vision which intoxicates the brain 
         with the sparkling wine of imagination, and sets the teeth a- rattling 
         in the jaws, and the tongue a-cleaving to the palate of the mouth.  
       </p><p>But the book-men have slain the Great God, and the twitterers of words 
         have twisted their squeaking screws into his coffin. The first Christians 
         were called Atheists; yet they believed in God: the last Christians are 
         called Theists; yet they believe not in God. So the first Freethinkers 
         were called Atheists; yet they believed in NO- GOD: and the last Freethinkers 
         will be called Theists; for they will believe not in NO-GOD. Then indeed 
         in these latter days may we again find the Great God, that God who liveth 
         beyond the twittering of man's lips, and the mumblings of his mouth.  
       </p><p>Filled with the froth of words, have these flatulent fools argued concerning 
         God. Not as the bard sung of Ymer; {181} but as the cat purrs to the strangling 
         mouse: "Since God is First Cause, therefore he possesses existence "a 
         se;" therefore he must be both necessary and absolute, and cannot be determined 
         by anything else." Nevertheless these wise doctors discuss him as if he 
         were a corpse on the tables of their surgeries, and measure his length 
         with their foot- rules, and stretch and lop him to fit the bed of their 
         Procrustean metaphysic. Thus he is absolutely unlimited from without, 
         and unlimited also from within, for limitation is non-being, and God is 
         being itself, and being is all- things, and all-things is no-thing. And 
         so we find Epicurus walking arm in arm, from the temple of windy words, 
         with Athanasius, and enter the market-place of life, and the throng of 
         the living --- that great tongueless witness of God's bounty; and mingle 
         with the laughing boys, showering rose-leaves on Doris and Bacchis, and 
         blowing kisses to Myrtale and Evardis.  
       </p><p>God or No-God --- so let it be! Still the Sun rises and sets, and the 
         night-breeze blows the red flames of our tourches athwart the palm-trees, 
         to the discomfiture of the stars. Look! --- in the distance between the 
         mighty paws of the silent Sphinx rests a cubical temple whose god has 
         been called Ra Harmakhis, the Great God, the Lord of the Heaven, but who 
         in truth is nameless and beyond name, for he is the Eternal Spirit of 
         Life.  
       </p><p>Hush --- the sistrum sounds from across the banks of the dark waters. 
         The moon rises, and all is as silver and mother-of-pearl. A shepherd's 
         pipe shrills in the distance --- a kid has strayed from the fold. ... 
         O stillness ... O mystery of God ... how soft is Thy skin ... how fragrant 
         is Thy breath! Life as a strong wine flames through me. The {182} frenzy 
         of resistance, the rapture of the struggle --- ah! the ecstasy of Victory. 
         ... The very soul of life lies ravished, and the breath has left me. ... 
         A small warm hand touches my lips --- O fragrance of love! O Life! ... 
         Is there a God?

         <h2> THE PRUDE </h2>
       </center>
       A FLY once sat upon the axle-tree of a chariot, and said: "What a dust do 
       I raise!" Now a swarm of flies has come --- the fourth plague of Egypt is 
       upon us, and the land is corrupted by reason of their stench. The mighty 
       ones are dead, the giants are no more, for the sons of God come not in unto 
       the daughters of men, and the world is desolate, and greatness and renown 
       are gone. To-day the blue blow-flies of decay sit buzzing on the slow-rolling 
       wheel of Fortune, intoxicated on the dust of the dead, and sucking putrefaction 
       from the sinews of the fallen, and rottenness from the charnel-house of 
       Might.  
       <p>O Reason! Thou hast become as a vulture feasting off the corpse of a 
         king as it floats down the dark waters of Acheron. Nay! not so grand a 
         sight, but as an old, wizened woman, skaldy and of sagging breast, who 
         in the solitude of her <em>latrina </em>cuddles and licks the oleograph 
         of a naked youth. O Adonis, rest in the arms of Aphrodite, seek not the 
         hell-fouled daughter of Ceres, who hath grown hideous in the lewd embrace 
         of the Serpent-God, betrayer of the knowledge of good and of evil. Behold 
         her bulging belly and her shrivelled breasts, full of scale and scab --- 
         "bald, rotten, abominable!" Her tears no longer blossom into the anemones 
         of Spring; {184} for their purity has left them, and they are become as 
         the bilge which poureth forth from the stern of a ship full of hogs. O! 
         Eros, fly, speed! Await not the awakening oil to scorch Thy cheek, lest 
         Thou discover that Thy darling has grown hideous and wanton, and that 
         in the place of a fair maiden there slimeth a huge slug fed of the cabbage-stalks 
         of decay.  
       </p><p>O Theos! O Pantheos! O Atheos! Triple God of the brotherhood of warriors. 
         Evoe! I adore Thee, O thou Trinity of might and majesty --- Thou silent 
         Unity that rulest the hearts of the great. Alas! that men are dead, their 
         thrones of gold empty, and their palaces of pearl fallen into ruin! Grandeur 
         and Glory have departed, so that now in the Elysian fields the sheep of 
         woolly understanding nibble the green turnip-tops of reason and the stubble 
         in the reaped cornfields of knowledge. Now all is rational, virtuous, 
         smug, and oily. Those who wrestled with the suns and the moons, and trapped 
         the stars of heaven, and sought God on the summits of the mountains, and 
         drove Satan into the bowels of the earth, have swum the black waters of 
         Styx, and are now in the halls of Asgard and the groves of Olympus, amongst 
         the jewels of Havilah and the soft-limbed houris of Paradise. They have 
         left us, and in their stead have come the carrion kites, who have usurped 
         the white thrones of their understanding, and the golden palaces of their 
         wisdom.  
       </p><p>Let us hie back to the cradle of Art and the swaddling bands of Knowledge, 
         and watch the shepherds, among the lonely hills where the myrtle grows 
         and the blue-bells ring out the innocence of Spring, learning from their 
         flocks the mysteries of life. ... A wolf springs from the thicket, and 
         a lamb lies sweltering in its blood; then an oaken cudgel is {185} raised, 
         and Hermas has dashed out the brains from betwixt those green, glittering 
         eyes. There now at his feet lie the dead and the dying; and man wonders 
         at the writhing of the entrails and the bubbling of the blood. See! now 
         he gathers in his flock, and drives them to a dark cavern in the sloping 
         side of the mountain; and when the moon is up he departs, speeding to 
         his sister the Sorceress to seek of her balsams and herbs wherewith to 
         stanch his wound and to soothe the burning scratches of the wolf's claws. 
         There under the stars, whilst the bats circle around the moon, and the 
         toad hops through the thicket, and the frogs splash in the mere, he whispers 
         to her, how green were the eyes of the wild wolf, how sharp were his claws, 
         how white his teeth and then, how the entrails wriggled on the ground, 
         and the pink brains bubbled out their blood. Then both are silent, for 
         a great awe fills them, and they crouch trembling amongst the hemlock 
         and the foxgloves. A little while and she arises, and, pulling her black 
         hood over her head, sets out alone through the trackless forest, here 
         and there lit by the moon; and, guided by the stars, she reaches the city.  
       </p><p>At a small postern by the tower of the castle known as the "lover's gate" 
         she halts and whistles thrice, and then, in shrill, clear notes as of 
         some awakened night-bird, calls: "Brother, brother, brother mine!" Soon 
         a chain clanks against the oaken door, and a bolt rumbles back in its 
         staple, and before her in his red shirt and his leathern hose stands her 
         brother the Hangman. And there under the stars she whispers to him, and 
         for a moment he trembles, looking deep into her eyes; then he turns and 
         leaves her. Presently there is a creaking of chains overhead --- an owl, 
         awakened from the {186} gibbet above, where it had been blinking perched 
         on the shoulder of a corpse, flies shrieking into the night.  
       </p><p>Soon he returns, his footsteps resounding heavily along the stone passage, 
         and in his arms he is carrying the dead body of a young man. "<em>He, 
         </em>my little sister," he pants, and for a moment he props his heavy 
         load up against the door of the postern. Then these two, the Sorceress 
         and the Hangman, silently creep out into the night, back into the gloom 
         of the forest, carrying between them the slumbering Spirit of Science 
         and Art sleeping in the corse of a young man, whose golden hair streams 
         gleaming in the moonlight, and around whose white throat glistens a snake-like 
         bruise of red, of purple, and of black.  
       </p><p>There under the oaks by an age-worn dolmen did they celebrate their midnight 
         mass. ... "Look you! I must needs tell you, I love you well, as you are 
         to-night; you are more desirable than ever you have been before ... you 
         are built as a youth should be. ... Ah! how long, how long have I loved 
         you! ... But to-day I am hungry, hungry for you! ..."  
       </p><p>Thus under the Golden Bough in the moonlight was the host uplifted, and 
         the Shepherd, and the Hangman, and the Sorceress broke the bread of Necromancy, 
         and drank deep of the wine of witchcraft, and swore secrecy over the Eucharist 
         of Art.  
       </p><p>Now in the place of the dolmen stands the hospital, and where the trilithons 
         towered is built the "Hall of Science." Lo! the druid has given place 
         to the doctor; and the physician has slain the priest his father, and 
         with wanton words ravished the heart of his mother the sorceress. Now 
         {187} instead of the mystic circle of the adepts we have the great "Bosh-Rot" 
         school of Folly. Miracles are banned, yet still at the word of man do 
         the halt walk, and the lame rise up and run. The devils have been banished, 
         and demoniacal possession is no more, yet now the most lenient of these 
         sages are calling it "hystero-demonopathy" --- what a jargon of unmusical 
         syllables! Saul, when he met God face to face on the dusty road of Damascus, 
         is dismissed with a discharging lesion of the occipital cortex; and George 
         Fox crying, "Woe to the bloody city of Lichfield!" is suffering from a 
         disordered colon; whilst Carlyle is subject to gastro-duodenal catarrh. 
         Yet this latter one writes: "Witchcraft and all manner of Spectre-work, 
         and Demonology, we have now named Madness, and Diseases of the Nerves; 
         seldom reflecting that still the new question comes upon us: What is Madness, 
         what are Nerves?" --- Indeed, what is Madness, what are Nerves?  
       </p><p>Once, when a child, I was stung by a bee whilst dancing through the heather, 
         and an old shepherd met me, and taking a black roll of tobacco from a 
         metal box, he bit off a quid and, chewing it, spat it on my leg, and the 
         pain vanished. He did not spend an hour racking through the dictionary 
         of his brain to find a suitable "itis" whereby to allay the inflammation, 
         and then, having carefully classified it with another, declared the pain 
         to be imaginary and myself to be an hysterio-monomaniac suffering from 
         apiarian illusions!  
       </p><p>To-day Hercules is a sun-myth, and so are Osiris and Baal; and no may 
         can raise his little finger without some priapic pig shouting: "Phallus 
         ... phallus! I see a phallus! O what a phallus!" Away with this church-spire 
         sexuality, {188} these atavistic obstetrics, these endless survivals and 
         hypnoid states, and all these orchitic superficialities! Back to the fruits 
         of life and the treasure-house of mystery!  
       </p><p>Let us leap beyond the pale of these pedantic dictionary <em>proxenetes 
         </em>and this shuffling of the thumbed cards of Reason. Let us cease gnawing 
         at this philosophic ham-bone, and abandon the thistles of rationalism 
         to the tame asses of the Six-penny Cult, and have done with all this pseudo-scientce, 
         this logic-chopping, this levelling loquacity of loons, louts, lubbers, 
         and lunatics!  
       </p><p>O Thou rationalistic Boreas, how Thou belchest the sheep and with the 
         flatulence of windy words! Away with the ethics and morals of the schoolmen, 
         those prudish pedants whose bellies are swollen with the overboiled spinach 
         of their sploshy virtues; and cease rattling the bread-pills of language 
         in the bladder of medical terminology! The maniac's vision of horror is 
         better than this, even the shambles clotted with blood; for it is the 
         blood of life; and the loneliness of the distant heath is as a cup of 
         everlasting wine compared with the soapsuds of these clyster-mongers, 
         these purge-puffed prudes, who loose forth on us an evil-smelling gas 
         from their cabbage-crammed duodenary canals.  
       </p><p>Yea! it shall pass by, this gastro-epileptic school of neurological maniacs; 
         for in a little time we shall catch up with this moulting ostrich, and 
         shall slay him whilst he buries his occipital cortex under the rubbish-heap 
         of discharging lesions. Then the golden tree of life shall be replanted 
         in Eden, and we little children shall dance round it, and shall banquet 
         under the stars, feasting off the abandon of the wilderness and the freedom 
         of the hills. Artists we shall {189} become, and in the storm shall we 
         see a woman weeping; and in the lightning and the thunder the sworded 
         warrior who crushes her to his shaggy breast. Away with laws and labours. 
         ... Lo! in the groves of Pan the dance catches us up, and whirls us onward! 
         O how we dash aside the goblets and the wine-skins, and how the tangled 
         hair of our heads is blown amongst the purple clusters of the vine that 
         clambers along the branches of the plane-trees in the Garden of Eros!  
       </p><p>But yet for a little while the mystic child of Freedom must sit weeping 
         at the footstool of the old prude Reason, and spell out her windy alphabets 
         whilst she squats like a toad above her, dribbling, filled with lewd thoughts 
         and longings for the oleograph of the naked youth and the stinking secrecy 
         of her <em>latrina! </em>

         <h2> THE CHILD </h2>
       </center>
       UNDER the glittering horns of Capricornus, when the mountains of the North 
       glistened like the teeth of the black wolf in the cold light of the moon, 
       and when the broad lands below the fiery girdle of many-breasted Tellus 
       blushed red in the arms of the summer sun, did Miriam seek the cave below 
       the cavern, in which no light had ever shone, to bring forth the Light of 
       the World. And on the third day she departed from the cave, and, entering 
       the stable of the Sun, she placed her child in the manger of the Moon. Likewise 
       was Mithras born under the tail of the Sea-Goat, and Horus, and Krishna 
       --- all mystic names of the mystic Child of Light.  
       <p>I am the Ancient Child, the Great Disturber, the Great Tranquilliser. 
         I am Yesterday, To-day, and To-morrow. My name is Alpha and Omega --- 
         the Beginning and the End. My dwelling-house is built betwixt the water 
         and the earth; the pillars thereof are of fire, and the walls are of air, 
         and the roof above is the breath of my nostrils, which is the spirit of 
         the life of man.  
       </p><p>I am born as an egg in the East, of silver, and of gold, and opalescent 
         with the colours of precious stones; and with my Glory is the beast of 
         the horizon made purple and scarlet, and orange, and green, many-coloured 
         as a great peacock {191} caught up in the coils of a serpent of fire. 
         Over the pillars of AEthyr do I sail, as a furnace of burnished brass; 
         and blasts of fire pour from my nostrils, and bathe the land of dreams 
         in the radiance of my Glory. And in the west the lid of mine Eye drops 
         --- down smites the Night of reckoning and destruction, that night of 
         the slaughter of the evil, and of the overthrow of the wicked, and the 
         burning of the damned.  
       </p><p>Robed in the flames of my mouth, I compass the heavens, so that none 
         shall behold me, and that the eyes of men shall be spared the torture 
         of unutterable light. "Devourer of Millions of Years" is my name; "Lord 
         of the Flame" is my name; for I am as an eye of Silver set in the heart 
         of the Sun. Thou spreadest the locks of thine hair before thee, for I 
         burn thee; thou shakest them about thy brow, so that thine eyes may not 
         be blinded by the fire of my fury. I am He who was, who is, and who will 
         be; I am the Creator, and the Destroyer, and the Redeemer of mankind. 
         I have come as the Sun from the house of the roaring of lions, and at 
         my coming shall there be laughter, and weeping, and singing, and gnashing 
         of teeth. Ye shall tread upon the serpent and the scorpion, and the hosts 
         of your enemies shall be as chaff before the sickle of your might: yet 
         ye must be born in the cavern of darkness and be laid in the manger of 
         the moon.  
       </p><p>Lo! I am as a babe born in a crib of lilies and roses, and wrapped in 
         the swaddling bands of June. Mine hands are delicate and small, and my 
         feet are shod in flame, so that they touch not the kingdoms of this earth. 
         I arise, and leave the cradle of my birth, and wander through the valleys, 
         and over the hills, across the sun-scorched deserts of day, and {192} 
         through the cool groves of night. Everywhere, everywhere, I find myself, 
         in the deep pools, and in the dancing streams, and in the many-coloured 
         surface of the mere: there I am white and wonderful, a child of loveliness 
         and of beauty, a child to entice songs from the wild rose, and kisses 
         from the zephyrs of dawn.  
       </p><p>Herod would have slain me, and Kansa have torn me with his teeth of fire; 
         but I eluded them, as a flame hidden in a cloud of smoke, and took refuge 
         in the land of Ptah and sought sanctuary in the arms of Seb. There were 
         the glories of Light revealed to me, and I became as a daughter of Ceres 
         playing in the poppied fields of yellow corn: yet still as a sun-limbed 
         bacchanal I trampled forth the foaming must from the purple grapes of 
         Bacchus, and breathing it into the leaven of life, caused it to ferment, 
         and bubble forth as the Wine of Iacchus. Then with the maiden, who was 
         also myself. I partook of the Eucharist of Love --- the corn and the wine, 
         and became one.  
       </p><p>Then there came unto me a woman subtle and beautiful to behold, whose 
         breasts were as alabaster bowls filled with wine, and the purple hair 
         of whose head was as a dark cloud on a stormy night. Dressed in a gauze 
         of scarlet and gold, and jewelled with pearls and emeralds and magic stones, 
         she, like a spider spun in a web of sunbeams and blood, danced before 
         me, casting her jewels to the winds, and naked she sang to me: "O lover 
         of mine heart, thy limbs are as chalcedony, white and round, and tinged 
         with the mingling blush of the sapphire, the ruby, and the sard. Thy lips 
         are as roses in June; and thine eyes as amethysts set in the vault of 
         heaven. O! come kiss me, for I tremble for thee; fill me with love, {193} 
         for I am consumed by the heat of my passion; say me, O slay me with kisses, 
         burn me in the fire of thy kingdom, O slay me with the sword of thy rapture!"  
       </p><p>Then I cried unto her in a loud voice saying: "O Queen of the lusts of 
         flesh! O Queen of the lands haunted by satyrs! O Mistress of Night! O 
         Mother of the mysteries of birth and death! Who art girt in the flames 
         of passion, and jewelled with emerald, and moonstone, and chrysoleth. 
         Lo! on thy brow burns the star-sapphire of heaven, thy girdle is as the 
         serpent of Eden, and round thine ankles chatter the rubies and garnets 
         of hell. Hearken, O Lilith! O Sorceress of the blood of life! My lips 
         are for those who suckle not Good, and my kisses for those who cherish 
         not Evil. And my kingdom is for the children of light who trample under 
         foot the garment of shame, and rend from their loins the sackcloth of 
         modesty. When Two shall be One, then shalt thou be crowned with a crown 
         neither of gold nor of silver, nor yet of precious stones; but as with 
         a crown of fire fashioned in the light of God's glory. Yea! when my sword 
         falleth, then that which is without shall be like unto that which is within; 
         then tears shall be as kisses, and kisses as tears; then all shall be 
         leavened and made whole, and thou shalt find in thine hand a sceptre, 
         neither of lilies nor of gold, but a sceptre of light, yea! a sceptre 
         of the holiness and loveliness of light and of glory!"  
       </p><p>O Children of the land of Dreams! O ye who would cross the bar of sleep, 
         and become as Children of Awakenment and Light. Woe unto you! for ye cleanse 
         outside the cup and the platter; but within they are full of uncleanness. 
         Ye are soaked in the blood of corruption, and choked with {194} the vomit 
         of angry words. Close your eyes, O ye neophytes in the mysteries of God, 
         lest ye be blinded, and cry out like a man whose sight has been smitten 
         black by a burning torch of tar. O Children of Dreams! plough well the 
         fields of night, and prepare them for the Sower of Dawn. Heed lest the 
         golden corn ripen and ye be not ready to pluck the swollen ears, and feast, 
         and become as Bezaleel, filled with a divine spirit of wisdom, and understanding, 
         and knowledge -- a cunning worker in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 
         in scarlet, in purple, and in blue.  
       </p><p>But woe unto ye who tarry by the wayside, for the evening is at hand; 
         to-day is the dawn, tomorrow the night of weeping. Gird up your loins 
         and speed to the hills; and perchance on the way under the cedars and 
         the oaks ye meet God face to face and know. But be not downcast if ye 
         find not God in the froth or the dregs of the first cup: drink and hold 
         fast to the sword of resolution --- onwards, ever onwards, and fear not!  
       </p><p>Devils shall beset the path of the righteous, and demons, and all the 
         elemental spirits of the Abyss. Yet fear not! for they add grandeur and 
         glory to the might of God's power. Pass on, but keep thy foot upon their 
         necks, for in the region whither thou goest, the seraph and the snake 
         dwell side by side.  
       </p><p><em>Sume lege.</em> Open the Book of THYSELF, take and read. Eat, for 
         this is thy body; drink, for this is the blood of thy redemption. The 
         sun thou seest by day, and the moon thou beholdest by night, and all the 
         stars of heaven that burn above thee, are part of thyself --- are thyself. 
         And so is the bowl of Space which contains them, and the wine of Time 
         in {195} which they float; for these two are part of thyself --- are Thyself. 
         And God also who casteth them forth from the coffers of his treasury. 
         He, too, though thou knowest it not, is part of thyself --- is THYSELF. 
         All is in thee, and thou art in all, and separate existence is not, being 
         but a net of dreams wherein the dreamers of night are ensnared. Read, 
         and thou becomest; eat and drink, and thou art.  
       </p><p>Though weak, thou art thine own master; listen not to the babblers of 
         vain words, and thou shalt become strong. There is no revelation except 
         thine own. There is no understanding except thine own. There is no consciousness 
         apart from thee, but that it is held feodal to thee in the kingdom of 
         thy Divinity. When thou knowest thou knowest, and there is none other 
         beside thee, for all becometh as an armour around thee, and thou thyself 
         as an invulnerable, invincible warrior of Light.  
       </p><p>Heed not the pedants who chatter as apes among the treetops; watch rather 
         the masters, who in the cave under the cavern breathe forth the breath 
         of life.  
       </p><p>One saith to thee:  
       </p><p>"Abandon all easy, follow the difficult; eat not of the best, but of 
         the most distasteful; pander not to thy pleasures, but feed well thy disgusts; 
         console not thyself, but seek the waters of desolation; rest not thyself, 
         but labour in the depths of the night; aspire not to things precious, 
         but to things contemptible and low."  
       </p><p>But I say unto thee: heed not this vain man, this blatherer of words! 
         For there is Godliness in ease, in fine dishes, and in pleasures, in consolations, 
         in rest, and in precious things.  
       </p><p>So if in thyself thou findest a jewelled goblet, I say unto {196} thee, 
         drink from it, for it is the cup of thy salvation; seek not therefore 
         a dull bowl of heavy lead!  
       </p><p>Yet another saith unto thee:  
       </p><p>"Will not anything, will nothing; seek not for the best, but for the 
         worst. Despise thyself; slander thyself; speak lightly of thyself."  
       </p><p>And again:  
       </p><p>"To enjoy the taste for all things, then have no taste for anything."  
       </p><p>"To know all things; then resolve to possess nothing."  
       </p><p>"To be all; then, indeed be willing to be naught."  
       </p><p>But I say unto thee: this one is filed like a fool's bladder with wind 
         and a rattling of dried peas; for he who wills everything, is he who seeks 
         of the best; for he who honours himself, he who prides himself most; and 
         he who speaks highly of himself, is he who also shall reign in the City 
         of God.  
       </p><p>"To have no taste for anything, then enjoy the taste of all things.  
       </p><p>"To resolve to possess nothing, then possess all things.  
       </p><p>"To be naught, then indeed be all."  
       </p><p>Open the book of Thyself in the cave under the cavern and read it by 
         the light of thine own understanding, then presently thou shalt be born 
         again, and be placed in the manger of the Moon in the stable of the Sun.  
       </p><p>For, children! when ye halt at one thing, ye cease to open yourselves 
         to all things. For to come to the All, ye must give up the All, and likewise 
         possess the All. Verily ye must destroy all things and out of No-thing 
         found and build the Temple of God as set up by Solomon the King, which 
         is {197} placed between Time and Space; the pillars thereof are Eternity, 
         and the walls Infinity, and the floor Immortality, and the Roof --- but 
         ye shall know of this hereafter! Spoil thyself if so thou readest thyself; 
         but if it is written adorn thyself, then spare not the uttermost farthing, 
         but deck thyself with all the jewels and gems of earth; and from a child 
         playing with the sands on the sea- shore shalt thou become God, whose 
         footstool is the Abyss, and from whose mouth goeth forth the sword of 
         the salvation and destruction of the worlds, and in whose hand rest the 
         seven stars of heaven.

         <h2> THE WANTON </h2>
       </center>
       THERE is a woman, young, and beautiful, and wise, who grows not old as she 
       dances down the centuries: she was in the beginning, and she will be in 
       the end, ever young, ever enticing, and always inscrutable. Her back is 
       to the East and her eyes are towards the night, and in her wake lieth the 
       world. Wherever she danceth, there man casteth the sweat from his brow and 
       followeth her. Kings have fled their thrones for her; priests their temples; 
       warriors their legions; and husbandmen their ploughs. All have sought her; 
       yet ever doth she remain subtle, enticing, virginal. None have known her 
       save those little ones who are born in the cave under the cavern; yet all 
       have felt the power of her sway. Crowns have been sacrificed for her; gods 
       have been blasphemed for her; swords have been sheathed for her; and the 
       fields have lain barren for her; verily! the helm of man's thoughts has 
       been cloven in twain by the magic of her voice. For like some great spider 
       she has enticed all into the silken meshes of her web, wherein she hath 
       spun the fair cities of the world, where sorrow sits tongueless and laughter 
       abideth not; and tilled the fertile plains, where innocence is but as the 
       unopened book of Joy. Yet it is she also who hath led armies into battle; 
       it is she who hath brought frail vessels {199} safely across the greedy 
       ocean; it is she who hath enthroned priests, crowned kings, and set the 
       sword in the hand of the warrior; and it is she who hath helped the weary 
       slave to guide his plough through the heavy soil, and the miner to rob the 
       yellow gold from the bowels of the earth. Everywhere will you find her dancing 
       down empires, and weaving the destiny of nations. She never sleeps, she 
       never slumbers, she never rests; ever wakeful, day and night, her eyes glisten 
       like diamonds as she danceth on, the dust of her feet burying the past, 
       disturbing the present, and clouding the future. She was in Eden, she will 
       be in Paradise!  
       <p>I followed her, I abandoned all for her; and now I lie, as a fevered 
         man, raving in the subtle web of her beauty.  
       </p><p>Lo! there she stands swaying between the gates of Light and Darkness 
         under the shadow of the Three of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, whose 
         fruits are death; yet none that have not tasted thereof can tell whether 
         they be sweet or bitter to the tongue. Therefore all must pluck and eat 
         and dream. But when the time cometh for the mystic child to be born, they 
         shall awake, and with eyes of fire behold that on the summit of the mountain 
         in the centre of the garden there groweth the Tree of Life.  
       </p><p>Now round the trunk of the Tree and the lower branches thereof there 
         twines a woman, wild, wanton, and wise; whose body is as that of a mighty 
         serpent, the back of which is vermilion, and the belly of red-gold; her 
         breasts are purple, and from her neck spring three heads.  
       </p><p>And the first head is as the head of a crown‚d princess, and is of silver, 
         and on her brow is set a crown of pearls, and her eyes are as blue as 
         the sapphire; but upon perceiving {200} man they turn green and yellow 
         as the water of a troubled sea; and her mouth is as a moonstone cleft 
         in twain, in which lurks a tongue born of flame and water.  
       </p><p>And on beholding her, I cried to her in a loud voice, saying: "O Priestess 
         of the Veil who art throned between the Pillars of Knowledge and Ignorance, 
         pluck and give me of the fruit of the Tree of Life that I may eat thereof, 
         so that my eyes shall be opened, and that I become as a god in understanding, 
         and live for ever!"  
       </p><p>Then she laughed subtly, and answered me saying: "Understanding, O fool 
         that art so wise, is Ignorance. Fire licketh up water, and water quencheth 
         fire; and the sword which one man fleeth from, another sheatheth in his 
         breast. Seek the Crown of Truth, and thou shalt be shod with the sandals 
         of Falsehood; unclasp the girdle of Virtue, and thou shalt be wrapped 
         in the shroud of Vice."  
       </p><p>And, when she had finished speaking, she wove from her lips around me 
         a net-work of cloud and of flame; and in a subtle song she sang to me: 
         "In the web of my tongue hast thou been caught; in the breath of my mouth 
         shalt thou be snared. For Time shall be given unto thee wherein to seek 
         all things; and all things shall be thy curse, and thine understanding 
         shall be as the waves of the sea ever rolling onwards to the shore from 
         whence they came; and when at the height of their majesty shall their 
         pride and dominion be dashed against the rocks of Doubt, and all thy glory 
         shall become as the spume and the spray of shattered waters, blown hither 
         and thither by the storm."  
       </p><p>Then she caught me up in the web of her subtleties and breathed into 
         my nostrils the breath of Time; and bore me {201} to the Abyss, where 
         all is as the darkness of Doubt, and there she strangled me with the hemp 
         and the silk of the abominations and arrogance of mine understanding.  
       </p><p>And the second head is as the head of a young woman veiled with a veil 
         as clear as rock crystal, and crowned with a crown fashioned in the shape 
         of a double cube around which is woven a wreath of lilies and ivy. And 
         her countenance is as that of Desolation yet majestic as an Empress of 
         Earth, who possessing all things yet cannot find a helpmeet worthy to 
         possess her; and her eyes are as opals of light; and her tongue as an 
         arrow of flame.  
       </p><p>And on beholding her I cried in a loud voice saying: "O Princess of the 
         Vision of the Unknown, who art throned as a sphinx between the hidden 
         mysteries of Earth and Air, give me of the fruit of the Tree of Life that 
         I may eat thereof, so that mine eyes shall be opened, and I may become 
         as a god in understanding, and live for ever!"  
       </p><p>And when I had finished speaking she wept bitterly and answered me saying: 
         "Verily if the poor man trespass within the palace gate, the king's dogs 
         shall be let loose so that they may tear him in pieces. Also, if the king 
         seek shelter in the hut of the pauper the louse taketh refuge in his hair, 
         and heedeth not his crown nor his cap of ermine and gold. Now, thou, O 
         wise man who art so foolish, askest for Understanding; yet how shall it 
         be given unto him who asketh for it, for in the giving it it ceaseth to 
         be, and he who asketh of me is unworthy to receive. Wouldst thou enter 
         the king's palace in rags and beg crumbs of his bounty? Take heed lest, 
         the king perceiving thee not, his knaves set the hounds upon thee, so 
         that even the rags that thou possessest are torn from thee: or, {202} 
         even should the kind cast his eyes on thee, that he be not overcome with 
         fury at the presumption of thine offence, and order thee to be stripped 
         naked and beaten from his garden with staves back to the hovel whence 
         thou camest. And being a king, if thou seekest knowledge and understanding 
         in a beggar's hut, thou shalt become as an abode of vermin, and a prey 
         to hunger and thirst, and thy limbs shall be bitten by cold and scorched 
         with fire, and all thy wealth will depart from thee and thy people will 
         cast thee out and take away thy crown. Yet there is hope for the beggar 
         and the king, and the balances which sway shall be adjusted, and the sun 
         shall drink up the clouds, and the clouds shall swallow the sun, and there 
         shall be neither darkness nor light. Pledge thy pride and it will become 
         but the habitations of vermin, pledge thy humility and thou shalt be cast 
         out naked to the dogs."  
       </p><p>Then when she had finished speaking she bared her breast to me, and it 
         was as the colour of the vault of heaven at the rising of the sun; and 
         she took me in her arms and did caress me, and her tongue of fire crept 
         around and about me as the hand of a sly maid. Then I drank in the breath 
         of her lips, and it filled me as with the spirit of dreams and of slumber, 
         so that I doubted that the stars shone above me, and that the rivers flowed 
         at my feet. Thus all became as a vast Enigma to me, a riddle set in the 
         Unknowability of Space.  
       </p><p>Then in a subtle voice she sang to me: "I know not who thou art, or whence 
         thou camest; whether from across the snowy hills, or from over the plains 
         of fire. Yet I love thee; for thine eyes are as the blue of still waters, 
         and thy lips ruddy as the sun in the West. Thy voice is as the voice of 
         a {203} shepherd at even, calling together his flock in the twilight. 
         Thy breath is as the wind blown from across a valley of musk; and thy 
         loins are lusty as red coral washed from the depths of the sea. Come, 
         draw nigh unto me, O my love: my sister ensnared thee with her subtle 
         tongue, she gave thee to suck from the breasts of Time: come, I will give 
         thee more than she, for I will give unto thee as an inheritance my body, 
         and thou shalt fondle me as a lover, and as a reward for thy love will 
         I endow thee with all the realms of Space --- the motes in the sunbeam 
         shall be thine, and the starry palaces of night, all shall be thine even 
         unto the uttermost depths of Infinity." So she possessed me, and I her.  
       </p><p>And the third head is as the head of a woman neither young nor old, but 
         beautiful and compasionate; and on her forehead is set a wreath of Cypress 
         and Poppies fastened by a winged cross. And her eyes are as star-sapphires, 
         and her mouth is as a pearl, and on the lips crouches the Spirit of Silence.  
       </p><p>And on beholding her I cried to her in a loud voice, saying: "O Thou 
         Mother of the Hall of Truth! Thou who art both sterile and pregnant, and 
         before whose judgment-seat tremble the clothed and the naked, the righteous 
         and the unjust, give me of the fruit of the Tree of Life, that I may eat 
         thereof so that mine eyes shall be opened, and that I become as a god 
         in understanding, and live forever!"  
       </p><p>Then I stood before her listening for her answer, and a great shaking 
         possessed me, for she answered not a word; and the silence of her lips 
         rolled around me as the clouds of night and overshadowed my soul, so that 
         the Spirit of life left me. Then I fell down and trembled, for I was alone. 
         {204}

         <h2> THE SLAVE </h2>
       </center>
       THE blue vault of heaven is red and torn as the wound of a tongueless mouth; 
       for the West has drawn her sword, and the Sun lies sweltering in his blood. 
       The sea moans as a passionate bridegroom, and with trembling lips touches 
       the swelling breasts of night. Then wave and cloud cling together, and as 
       lovers who are maddened by the fire of their kisses, mingle and become one.  
       <p>Come, prepare the feast in the halls of the Twilight! Come, pour out 
         the dark wine of the night, and bring in the far-sounding harp of the 
         evening! Let us tear from our burning limbs the dusty robes of the morning, 
         and, naked, dance in the silver radiance of the moon. Voices echo from 
         the darkness, and the murmur of many lips lulls the stillness of departing 
         day, as a shower in springtime whispering amongst the leaves of the sprouting 
         beech trees. Now the wolves howl outside, and the jackals call from the 
         thicket; but none heed them, for all inside is as the mossy bank of a 
         sparkling streamlet --- full of softness and the flashing of many jewels.  
       </p><p>O where art thou, my loved one, whose eyes are as the blue of the far-off 
         hills? O where art thou whose voice is as the murmur of distant waters? 
         I stretch forth mine hands and feel {205} the rushes nodding in the wind; 
         I gaze through the shadows, for the night mist is rising from the lake; 
         but thee I cannot find. Ah! there thou art by the willow, standing between 
         the bulrush and the water-lily, and thy form is as a shell of pearl caught 
         up by the waves in the moonlight. Come, let us madden the night with our 
         kisses! Come, let us drink dry the vats of our passion! Stay! Why fleest 
         thou from me, as the awakened mist of the morning before the arrows of 
         day? Now I can see thee no more; thou art gone, and the darkness hath 
         swallowed thee up. O wherefore hast thou left me, me who loved thee, and 
         wove kisses in thine hair? Behold, the Moon hath followed thee! Now I 
         see not the shadows of the woods, and the lilies in the water have become 
         but flecks of light in the darkness. Now they mingle and melt together 
         as snow-flakes before the sun, and are gone; yea! the stars have fled 
         the skies, and I am alone.  
       </p><p>How cold has grown the night, how still! O where art thou! Come, return 
         unto me, that I stray not in vain; call unto me that I lose not my way! 
         Lighten me with the brightness of thine eyes, so that I wander not far 
         from the path and become a prey to the hunger of wild beasts!  
       </p><p>I am lost; I know not where I am; the mossy mountains have become as 
         hills of wind, and have been blown far from their appointed places; and 
         the waving fields of the valleys have become silent as the land of the 
         dead, so that I hear then not, and know not whither to walk. The reeds 
         whisper not along the margin of the lake; all is still; heaven has closed 
         her mouth and there is no breath in her to wake the slumber of desolation. 
         The lilies have been sucked up by the greedy waters, and now night sleeps 
         like some mighty {206} serpent gorged on the white flesh and the warm 
         blood of the trembling maidens of dawn, and the wild youths of the noon-tide.  
       </p><p>O my dove, my loved one! Didst thou but approach as a wanderer in the 
         wilderness, thine hair floating as a raiment of gold about thee, and thy 
         breasts lit with the blush of the dawn! Then would mine eyes fill with 
         tears, and I would leap towards thee in the madness of my joy; but thou 
         comest not. I am alone, and tremble in the darkness like the bleached 
         bones of a giant in the depths of a windy tomb.  
       </p><p>There is a land in which no tree groweth, and where the warbling of the 
         birds is as a forgotten dream. There is a land of dust and desolation, 
         where no river floweth, and where no cloud riseth from the plains to shade 
         men's eyes from the sand and the scorching sun. Many are they who stray 
         therein, for all live upon the threshold of misery who inhabit the House 
         of joy. There wealth taketh wing as a captive bird set free, and fame 
         departeth as a breath from fainting lips; love playeth the wanton, and 
         the innocence of youth is but as a cloak to cover the naked hideousness 
         of vice; health is not known, and joy lies corrupted as a corpse in the 
         grave; and behind all standeth the great slave master called Death, all-encompassing 
         with his lash, all- desolating in the naked hideousness and the blackness 
         wherewith he chastiseth.  
       </p><p>"I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and behold all 
         was vanity and vexation of spirit." Yea! all are of dust, and turn to 
         dust again, and the dead know not anything. Health has left me, wealth 
         has departed from me, those whom I love have been taken from me, and now 
         Thou {207} (O my God!) hast abandoned me, and cast me out, and setting 
         a lock upon Thy lips hast stopped Thine ears with wax and covered Thine 
         eyes with the palms of Thine hands, so that Thou seest me not, nor hearest 
         me, nor answerest unto my bitter cry. Thus I am cast out from Thy presence 
         and sit alone as one lost in a desert of sand, and cry unto Thee, thirsting 
         for Thee, and then deny Thee and curse Thee in my madness, until death 
         stop the blasphemies of my lips with the worm and the dust of corruption, 
         and I am set free from the horror of this slavery of sorrow.  
       </p><p>I am alone, yea! alone, sole habitant of this kingdom of desolation and 
         misery. Hell were as Paradise to this solitude. O would that dragons came 
         from out the deep and devoured me, or that lions tore me asunder for their 
         food; for their fury would be as milk and honey unto the bitterness of 
         this torture. O cast unto me a worm, that I may no longer be alone, and 
         that in its writhings on the sand I read Thine answer to my prayer! Would 
         I were in prison that I might hear the groans of the captives; would I 
         were on the scaffold that I might listen to the lewd jests of bloody men! 
         O would I were in the grave, wound in the roots of the trees, eyeless 
         gazing up into the blackness of death!  
       </p><p>Between the evening and the morning was I born, like a mushroom I sprang 
         up in the night. At the breast of desolation was I fed, and my milk was 
         as whey, and my meat as the bitterness of aloes. Yet I lived, for God 
         was with me; and I feared, for the devil was at hand. I did not understand 
         what I needed, I was afraid, and fear was as a pestilence unto my soul. 
         Yet was I intoxicated and drunken on the cup of life, and joy was mine, 
         and reeling I shrieked blasphemies {208} to the storm. Then I grew sober, 
         and diced with mine understanding, and cheated mine heart, and lost my 
         God, and was sold into slavery, and became as a coffin-worm unto the joy 
         of my life. Thus my days grew dark, and I cried unto myself as my spirit 
         left me: "O what of to-day which is as the darkness of night? O what then 
         of to-morrow which is as the darkness of Eternity? Why live and tempt 
         the master's lash?" So I sought the knife at my girdle to sunder the thread 
         of my sorrow; but courage had taken flight with joy, and my hand shook 
         so that the blade remained in its sheath. Then I cried unto myself: "Verily 
         why should I do aught, for life itself hath become unto me as a swordless 
         scabbard" --- so I sat still and gloomed into the darkness.

         <h2> THE WARRIOR </h2>
       </center>
       THERE is an indifference which overleaps satisfaction; there is a surrender 
       which overthrows victory, there is a resignation which shatters the fetters 
       of anxiety, a relaxation which casts to the winds the manacles of despair. 
       This is the hour of the second birth, when from the womb of the excess of 
       misery is born the child of the nothingness of joy. <em>Solve! </em>For 
       all must be melted in the crucible of affliction, all must be refined in 
       the furnace of woe, and then on the anvil of strength must it be beaten 
       out into a blade of gleaming joy. <em>Coagula! </em>  
       <p>Weep and gnash your teeth, and sorrow sits crowned and exultant; therefore 
         rise and gird on the armour of utter desolation! Slay anger, strangle 
         sorrow, and drown despair; then a joy shall be born which is beyond love 
         or hope, endurable, incorruptible. Come heaven, come hell! Once the Balances 
         are adjusted, then shall the night pass away, and desire and sorrow vanish 
         as a dream with the breath of the morning.  
       </p><p>The war of the Freedom of Souls is not the brawling of slaves in the 
         wine-dens, or the haggling of the shopmen in the market-place; it is the 
         baring of the brand of life, that unsheathing of the Sword of Strength 
         which lays all low before the devastation of its blade. Life must be held 
         in {210} contempt --- the life of self and the life of others. Here there 
         must be no weakness, no sentiment, no reason, no mercy. All must taste 
         of the desolation of war, and partake of the blood of the cup of death. 
         O! warriors, ye cannot be too savage, to barbarous, too strong. On, O 
         storm-blown sons of the fire of life! Success is your password; destruction 
         is your standard; Victory is your reward!  
       </p><p>Heed not the shrieking of women, or the crying of little children; for 
         all must die, and not a stone must be left standing in the city of the 
         World, lest darkness depart not. Haste! bring flint and steel, light the 
         match, fire the thatch of the hovel and the cedar rafters of the palace; 
         for all must be destroyed, and no man must delay, or falter, or turn back, 
         or repent. Then from the ashes of Destruction will rise the King, the 
         birthless and the deathless one, the great monarch who shall shake from 
         his tangled beard the blood of strife, and who shall cast from his weary 
         hand the sword of desolation.  
       </p><p>Yea! from out the night flashes a sword of flame, from out the darkness 
         speeds an arrow of fire!  
       </p><p>I am alone, and stand at the helm of the barque of Death, and laugh at 
         the fury of the waves; for the prow of my laughter smiteth the dark waters 
         of destruction into a myriad jewels of unutterable and uttermost joy!  
       </p><p>I am alone, and stand in the centre of the desert of Sorrow, and laugh 
         at the misery of earth: for the music of my laughter whirleth the sands 
         of desolation into a golden cloud of unutterable and uttermost joy!  
       </p><p>I am alone, and stand on the storm cloud of life, and laugh at the shrieking 
         of the winds; for the wings of my {211} laughter sweep away the web of 
         outer darkness, and reveal the stars of unutterable and uttermost joy!  
       </p><p>I am alone, and stand on the flames of the mountains of pleasure, and 
         laugh at the fire of rapture; for the breath of my laughter bloweth the 
         bright flames into a pillar of unutterable and uttermost joy.  
       </p><p>I am alone, and stand amongst the ghosts of the dead, and laugh at the 
         shivering of the shades, for the heart of my laughter pulseth as a mighty 
         fountain of blood clothing the shadows of night with the spirit of unutterable 
         and uttermost joy!  
       </p><p>I am alone, yea alone, one against all; yet in my sword have I all things; 
         for in it lives the strength of my might, and if joy come not at my beckoning, 
         then joy shall be slain as a disobedient slave, and if sorrow depart not 
         at my command, then shall sorrow speed through the valley of death as 
         a foe that passeth not his neck beneath the yoke.  
       </p><p>In the bastion of mine imagination lie all the munitions of my might; 
         and from the tower of my resolution do I sweep away the stars, and pour 
         forth fire and water on the world of laughter and weeping. I cannot be 
         despoiled, for none can approach me; I cannot be succoured, for I am far 
         beyond the path of man's help. Yet neither would I if I could; for if 
         I could, I would not; and if I would, I could not; for I have become as 
         a giant amongst men, strong as he can only be who has feasted on the agony 
         of life, and drunken of the cup of the sorrow of death, and towered above 
         all things.  
       </p><p>Laugher is mine, not the laughter of bitterness, nor the laughter of 
         jest; but the laughter of strength and of life. I live like a mighty conquering 
         Lord and all things are mine. {212} Fair groves and gardens, palaces of 
         marble and fortresses of red sandstones; and the coffers of my treasury 
         are filled with gold and silver and precious stones; and before my path 
         the daughters of pleasure dance with unbraided tresses, scattering lilies 
         and roses along my way. Life is a joy indeed, a rapture of clinging lips 
         and of red wine, which flows in beads along the bronze and purple tresses, 
         and then like rubies of blood finds refuge between the firm white breasts 
         of maddened maidenhood.  
       </p><p>Hark! ... What is that, the yelping of a dog? No, it is the death-cry 
         of a man! ... Ay! the biting of sharp swords, and the shrieking of many 
         women. Ho! the feast has indeed begun, the rabble have broken in, scythes 
         glisten in the torch-light and tables are overturned; wine is gulped down 
         by filthy mouths, and spilt and mingled with the blood of the slaughtered 
         children of Eros, so that the banquet of love has become the shambles 
         of death. ...  
       </p><p>Now all is still and the rose has given birth to the poppy, and the bronze 
         tresses of the revellers lie motionless as snakes gorged on clotted blood, 
         and shimmer wantonly in the moonlight between discovered limbs and disemboweled 
         entrails. Soon the quivering maggots, which once were the brains of men, 
         will lick up the crumbs of the feast in the temple of love, and the farce 
         will be ended.  
       </p><p>I rise from the corpse of her I kissed, and laugh; for all is beautiful, 
         more beautiful still; for I create from the godless butchery of fiends 
         the overpowering grandeur of death. There she stands before me, rose-limbed, 
         crimson- lipped, with breast of scarlet flame, her tresses floating about 
         her like a cloud of ruby fire, and the tongue which creepeth from {213} 
         her lips is as a carbuncle wet with the strong blood of warriors. I laugh, 
         and in the frenzy of my exultation she is mine; and on that soft bed of 
         bloody corpses do I beget on her the laughter of the scorn of war, the 
         joy of the contempt of sorrow.  
       </p><p>Life is a horror, a writhing of famished serpents, yet I care not, for 
         I laugh. The deserts awe me not, neither do the seas restrain the purpose 
         of my mirth. Life is as prisoner in a dungeon, still I laugh; for I, in 
         my strength, have begotten a might beyond the walls of prisons; for life 
         and death have become one to me --- as little children gambolling on the 
         sands and splashing in the wavelets of the sea. I laugh at their pretty 
         play, and upon the billows of my laughter do I build up the Kingdom of 
         the Great in which all carouse at one table. Here virgins mingle with 
         courtesans, and the youth and the old man know neither wisdom nor folly.  
       </p><p>I have conquered the deserts and the forests, the valleys and the mountains, 
         the seas and the lands. My palace is built of fire and water, of earth 
         and of air, and the secret place within the sanctuary of my temple is 
         as the abode of everlasting mirth. All is love, life, and laugher; death 
         and decay are not: all is joy, purity, and freedom; all is as the fire 
         of mystery; all is all; for my kingdom is known as the City of God.  
       </p><p>The slave weepeth, for he is alone; O be not slaves unto yourselves, 
         lashing your backs with the sorrows of your own begetting. But rather 
         become strong in the widowhood of your joy, and evoke from the horror 
         of your seclusion the morion of the victory of resolution, and from the 
         misery of your loneliness, the sword of the destruction of desire. Then 
         {214} shall ye turn your faces towards the West, and stride after the 
         night of desolation, and on the cup of the sunset shall ye become strong 
         as warriors fed on the blood of bulls, and shall step out past the morning 
         and the night in the manliness of might, to the conquest of thyself, and 
         to the usurpation of the Throne of God!  
       </p><p>{215}  
       </p><center>
         <h2> THE KING </h2>
       </center>
       THE King is the undying One; he is the life and the master of life; he is 
       the great living image of the Sun, the Sun, and the begetter of the Sun. 
       He is the Divine Child, the God-begotten One, and the Begetter of God. He 
       is the potent bull, the jewelled snake, the fierce lion. He is the monarch 
       of the lofty mountains, and the lord of the woods and forests, the indweller 
       of the globes of flame. As a royal eagle he soars through the heavens, and 
       as a great dragon he churns up the waters of the deep. He holds the past 
       between his hands as a casket of precious stones, the future lies before 
       him clear as a mirror of burnished silver, and to-day is as an unsheathed 
       dagger of gold at his girdle.  
       <p>As a slave who is bold becomes a warrior, so a warrior who is fearless 
         becomes a king, changing his battered helm of strength for a glittering 
         crown of light; and as the warrior walks upright with the fearlessness 
         of disdain in his eyes, so does the king walk with bowed head, finding 
         love and beauty wherever he goeth, and whatever he doeth is true and lovely, 
         for having conquered his self, he ruleth over his self by love alone, 
         and not by the laws of good and evil, neither proudly nor disdainfully, 
         neither by justice nor by mercy. Good and Evil is not his, for he hath 
         become as an Higher Intelligence, {216} as an Art enshrined in the mind; 
         and in his kingdom actions no longer defile, and whatever his heart inclineth 
         him to do, that he doeth purely and with joy. And as the countenance of 
         a singer may be ruddy or white, fair or dark, nevertheless, the redness 
         or the whiteness, the fairness or the darkness, affect not the song of 
         his lips, or the rapture of his music; similarly, neither does man-made 
         virtue and vice, goodness and wickedness, strength and weakness, or any 
         of the seeming opposites of life, affect or control the actions of the 
         King; for he is free-born from the delusions and the dream of opposites, 
         and sees things as they are, and not as the five senses reflect them on 
         the mirror of the mind.  
       </p><p>Now he who would become as a king unto himself must not renounce the 
         kingdoms of this world, but must conquer the lands and estates of others 
         and usurp their thrones. Should he be poor he must aim at riches without 
         forfeiting his poverty; should he be rich he must aim at possessing poverty 
         as well, without taking one farthing from the coffers of his treasury. 
         The man of much estate must aim at possessing all the land, until there 
         is no kingdom left for him to conquer. The Unobtainable must be obtained, 
         and in the obtaining of it is to be found the Golden Key of the Kingdom 
         of Light. The virgin must become as the wanton, yet though filled with 
         all the itchings of lust, she must in no wise forfeit the purity of her 
         virginity; for the foundations of the Temple are indeed set between Day 
         and Night, and the Scaffolding thereof is as an arch flung between Heaven 
         and Hell. For if she who is a virgin become but as a common strumpet, 
         then she indeed falls and rises not, becoming in her {217} fall but a 
         clout in the eyes of all men, a foul rag wherewith to sop up the lusts 
         of flesh. So, verily, if she who being a courtesan, becometh as an untouched 
         virgin, she shall be considered as a thing of naught, being both sterile 
         and loveless; for what profit shall she be to this world who is the mother 
         of unfruitfulness? But she who is both crimson and white, a twisted pillar 
         of snow and fire, soothing where she burneth, and comforting where she 
         chilleth, she shall be held as queen amongst women; for in her all things 
         are found, and as an inexhaustible well of water around whose mouth grows 
         the wild apricot, in which the bees set their sweet hives, she shall be 
         both food and drink to the hearts of men: a well of life unto this world, 
         yea! a goodly tavern wherein cool wine is sold, and good cheer is to be 
         had, and where all shall be filled with the joyaunce of love.  
       </p><p>Thus shall men attain to the unity of the crown and become as kings unto 
         themselves. But the way is long and hilly and beset with many pitfalls, 
         and it traverses a foul and a wild country. Indeed we see before us the 
         towers and the turrets, the domes and the spires, the roofs and the gables, 
         glittering beyond the purple of the horizon, like the helmets and spears 
         of an army of warriors in the distance. But on approaching we find that 
         the blue of the sky-line encompasses a dark wood wherein are all things 
         unmindful of the Crown, and where there is darkness and corruption, and 
         where lives the Tyrant of the World clothed in a robe of fantastic desires. 
         Yet it is here that the Golden Key has been lost, where the hog, the wolf, 
         the ape, and the bearded goat hold revel. Here are set the pavilions of 
         dreams and the tented encampments of sleep, in which are spread the tables 
         of demons, and where {218} feast the wantons and the prudes, the youths 
         and the old men, and all the opposites of virtue and of vice. But he who 
         would wear the crown must find the key, else the door of the Palace remains 
         closed, for none other than he can open it for him. And he who would find 
         the Key of Gold must seek it here in the outer court of the World, where 
         the flatterers, and the parasites, and the hypocrites, buzz like flies 
         over the fleshpots of life.  
       </p><p>Now he who enters the outer court sees set before him many tables and 
         couches, at which with swollen veins revel the sons of the gluttony of 
         life. Here men, in their furious love of greed, stuff their jaws with 
         the luxuries of decay, which a little after go to the dunghill; and vomit 
         their sour drink on one another as a certain sign of their good fellowship. 
         Here they carouse together drunkenly as in a brothel filling the world 
         with the noise of cymbal and drum, and the loud-sounding instruments of 
         delusion, and with shouts of audacious shame. Here are their ears and 
         eyes pleasantly titillated by the sound of the hissing of the frying-pans, 
         and the sight of the bubbling of stews; and courting voracity, with necks 
         stretched out, so that they may sniff up the wandering steam of the dishes, 
         they fill their swollen bellies with things perishable, and drink up the 
         gluttonies of life. Yet he who would partake of the Banquet of Light must 
         pass this way and sojourn a while amongst these animals, who are so filled 
         with swinish itchings and unbridled fornications that they perceive not 
         that their manger and their dunghill lie side by side as twins in one 
         bed. For a space he must listen to the hiccuping of those who are loaded 
         with wine, and the snorting of those who are stuffed with food, and must 
         {219} watch these lecherous beasts who insult the name of man rolling 
         in their offal, gambolling, and itching with a filthy prurience after 
         the mischievous delights of lewdness, drunkenly groping amongst the herds 
         of long-haired boys and short-skirted girls, from whom they suck away 
         their beauty, as milk from the udders of a goat. He must dwell for a time 
         with these she-apes, smeared with white paint, mangled, daubed, and plastered 
         with the "excrement of crocodiles" and the "froth of putrid humours," 
         who are known as women. Disreputable hags who keep up old wives' whispering 
         over their cups, and who, as filthy in body as in mind, with unbridled 
         tongues clatter wantonly as they giggle over their sluttish whisperings, 
         shamelessly making with their lips sounds of lewdness and fornication. 
         And wanton young dabs with mincing gait swing their bodies here and there 
         amongst the men, their faces smeared with the ensnaring devices of wily 
         cunning. Winking boldly and babbling nonsense they cackle loudly, and 
         like fowls scratching the dunghill seek the dirt of wealth; and having 
         found it, pass their way to the gutter and the grave loaded with gold 
         like a filthy purse.  
       </p><p>O seeker! All this must thou bear witness to, and become a partaker in, 
         without becoming defiled or disgusted, and without contempt or reverence; 
         then of a certain shalt thou find the Golden Key which turneth the bolt 
         of evil from the staple of Good, and which openeth the door which leadeth 
         unto the Palace of the King, wherein is the Temple. For when thou hast 
         discovered Beauty and Wisdom and Truth in the swollen veins, in the distended 
         bellies, in the bubbling lips, in the lewd gambollings, in the furious 
         greed, the wanton {220} whisperings, the sly winkings, and all the shameless 
         nonsense of the Outer Court, then indeed shalt thou find that the Key 
         of gold is only to be found in the marriage of wantonness and chastity. 
         And taking it thou shalt place it in the lock of cherubic fire which is 
         fashioned in the centre of the door of the King's house, which is built 
         of ivory and ebony and studded with jet and silver; and the door shall 
         open for a time as if a flame had been blown aside, and thou shalt see 
         before thee a table of pearl on which are set the hidden waters and the 
         secret bread of the Banquet of Light. And thou shalt drink and eat and 
         become bright as a stream of molten silver; and, as the light of the body 
         is the eye, so shalt thy true self become as an eye unto thee, and see 
         all things, even the cup of the third birth; and, taking it, thou shalt 
         drink from the cup the eucharist of Freedom, the wine of which is more 
         fragrant than the sweet-scented grapes of Thrace, or the musk- breathing 
         vines of Lesbos, and is sweeter than the vintage of Crete, and all the 
         vineyards of Naxos and Egypt. And thou shalt be anointed with sweet-smelling 
         nards, and unguent made from lilies and cypress, myrtle and amaranth, 
         and of myrrh and cassia well mixed. And in thine hair shall be woven rose-leaves 
         of crimson light, and the mingling loveliness of lilies and violets, twined 
         as the dawn with night. And about thee shall waft a sweeter fragrance 
         than the burning of frankincense, and storax, and lign-aloes; for it is 
         the breath of the Temple of God. Then shalt thou step into the King's 
         Palace, O warrior! and a voice more musical than the flute of ivory and 
         the psaltery of gold, clear as a bell of mingled metals in the night, 
         shall call unto thee, and thou shalt follow it to the throne which is 
         as a perfect cube of {221} flaming gold set in a sea of whiteness; and 
         then shalt thou be unrobed of sleep and crowned with the silence of the 
         King --- the silence of song, of thought, and of reason, that unthinkable 
         silence of the Throne.

         <h2> THE WHITE WATCH-TOWER </h2>
       </center>
       CHAOS and ancient night have engulfed me; I am blind. I crouch on the tower 
       of uttermost silence awaiting the coming of the armies of the dawn.  
       <p>O whence do I come, where am I, O whither do I go? For I sit maddened 
         by the terrors of a great darkness. ... What do I hear? Words of mystery 
         float around me, a music of voices, a sweetness, as of the scent of far 
         burning incense; yea! I see, I hear, I am caught up on the wings of song. 
         Yet I doubt, and doubt that I doubt ... I behold!  
       </p><p>See! the night heaves as a woman great with child, and the surface of 
         the black waters shimmers as the quivering skin of one in the agony of 
         travail. ... The horizon is cleft and glows like a womb of fire, the hosts 
         of the night are scattered, I am born, and the stars melt like flakes 
         of snow before mine eyes. ...  
       </p><p>Lo! there she stands, born in maturity, shaken from out the loins of 
         the darkness, as a rainbow from the purple jars of the thunder. Her hair 
         is as a flood of dancing moon- beams, woven with golden ears of corn, 
         and caught up by flashing serpents of malachite and emerald. On her forehead 
         shines the crescent moon, pearl-like, and softly gleaming with the light 
         of an inner light. Her garment is as a web of translucent {223} silver, 
         glistening white and dew-like, now rippling with all the colours of the 
         rainbow, now rushing into flames crimson and gold, as the petals of the 
         red-rose, woven with poppy, and crocus, and tulips. And around her, as 
         a cloud of irradiant mystery gleaming with darkness, and partly obscuring 
         the softness of her form, sweeps a robe, woven of a network of misty waters, 
         and flashing with a myriad stars of silver; and in its midst, as a great 
         pearl of fire drawn from the depths of the seas, a full moon of silver 
         trembles glowing with beams of opalescent light --- mystic and wonderful. 
         In her right hand she holds a sistrum, and chimes forth the music of the 
         earth, and in her left an asp twisted to the prow of a boat of gold, wherein 
         lie the mysteries of heaven.  
       </p><p>Then clear and sweet as the breath of the hillside, I heard a voice, 
         as of the winds across a silver harp, saying:  
       </p><p>I am the Queen of the heavenly ones, of the Gods, and of the Goddesses, 
         united in one form. I am She who was, who is, and will be; my form is 
         one, my name is manifold; under the palm-trees, and in the deserts, in 
         the valleys, and on the snowy mountains, mankind pays me homage, and thunders 
         forth praises to my name. Yet I am nameless in the deep, as amongst the 
         lightsome mountains of the sky. Some call me Mother of the Gods, some 
         Aphrodite of the seas of pearl, some Diana of the golden nets, some Proserpina 
         Queen of Darkness, some Hecate mistress of enchantments, some Istar of 
         the boat of night, some Miriam of the Cavern, and others yet again Isis, 
         veiled mother of Mystery.  
       </p><p>I am she who cometh in unto all men, and if not here, then shalt thou 
         behold Me amidst the darkness of Acheron, and as Queen in the palaces 
         of Styx. I am the dark night {224} that bringeth forth the bright day; 
         I am the bright day that swalloweth up the dark night; that bright day 
         that hath been begotten by the ages, and conceived in the hearts of men; 
         that dawn in which storms shall cease their roaring, and the billows of 
         the deep shall be smoothed out like a sheet of molten glass.  
       </p><p>Then I was carried away on the wings of rapture, and in the strength 
         of my joy I leapt from the tower of Night; but as I fell, she caught me, 
         and I clung to her and she became as a Daughter of this world, as a Child 
         of God begotten in the heart of man. And her hair swept around and about 
         me, in clouds of gold, and rolled over me, as sunbeams poured out from 
         the cups of the noon. Her cheeks were bright with a soft vermilion of 
         the pomegranate mingling with the whiteness of the lily. Her lips were 
         half open, and her eyes were deep, passionate, and tremulous, as the eyes 
         of the mother of the human race, when she first struggled in the strong 
         arms of man; for I was growing strong in her strength, I was becoming 
         a worthy partner of her glory.  
       </p><p>Then she clung to me, and her breath left her lips like gusts of fire 
         mingled with the odours of myrtle; and in mine arms she sang unto me her 
         bridal song:  
       </p><p>"Come, O my dear one, my darling, let us pass from the land of the plough 
         to the glades and the groves of delight! There let us pluck down the clustered 
         vine of our trembling, and scatter the rose-leaves of our desire, and 
         trample the purple grapes of our passion, and mingle the foaming cups 
         of our joy in the glittering chalice of our love. O! love, what fountains 
         of rapture, what springs of intoxicating bliss well up from the depths 
         of our being, till the foaming wine jets {225} forth hissing through the 
         flames of our passion --- and splashes into immensity, begetting a million 
         suns.  
       </p><p>"I have watched the dawn, golden and crimson; I have watched the night 
         all starry-eyed; I have drunk up the blue depths of the waters, as the 
         purple juice of the grape. Yet, alone in thine eyes, do I find the delights 
         of my joy, and in thy lips the vintage of my love.  
       </p><p>"The flowers of the fields have I gazed on, and the gay plumage of the 
         birds, and the distant blue of the mountains; but they all fade before 
         the blush of thy cheeks; and as the ruby goblet of the Sun is drained 
         by the silver lips of night, so are they all swallowed up in the excess 
         of thy beauty.  
       </p><p>"I have breathed in the odour of roses and the fragrance of myrtle, and 
         the sweet scent of the wild jessamine. I have drunk in the breath of the 
         hillside, and the perfume of the woods and the seas; yet thy breath is 
         more fragrant than they, it is sweeter still, it intoxicateth me and filleth 
         me with joy, as a rich jar of wine found in the depths of a desert of 
         salt --- I have drunk deep and am bewildered with love.  
       </p><p>"I have listened to the lark in the sky, to the curlew, and to the nightingale 
         in the thicket, and to all the warblers of the woods, to the murmur of 
         the waters and to the singing of the winds; yet what are they to the rapture 
         of thy voice? which echoes in the valley of my breast, and trills through 
         the depths of my being.  
       </p><p>"I have tasted the juice of the peach, and the sweetness of honey and 
         milk; but the wine of thy lips is strong as the aromatic vintage of Egypt, 
         and sweet as the juice of the date-palms in the scented plains of Euphrates: 
         Ay! let me drink {226} till I reel bewildered with kisses and pleasure 
         ... O my love! ... my love! ... O my love!"  
       </p><p>Then I caught up her song and cried: "Yea! O Queen of the Night, O arrow 
         of brightness drawn from the quiver of the moon! O Thou who hast ensnared 
         me in the meshes of thine hair, and caught me up on the kisses of thy 
         mouth; O thou who hast laid aside thy divinity to take refuge in mine 
         arms, listen!  
       </p><p>"I have drunk deep of the flagons of passion with the white-veiled virgins 
         of Vesta, and the crimson-girdled daughters of Circe, and the drowsy-eyed 
         maidens of Ind. I have woven love with the lithe girls of Hellas, and 
         the subtle-limbed women of Egypt whose fingers are created to caress; 
         all the virgins of Assyria, and the veiled beauties of Arabia, have been 
         mine; yet amongst them all have I not found one to compare to a lash on 
         the lid of thine eye. O Thou art as the wine of ecstasy, a thousand times 
         more delicious than all these. Ah! but what is this languor which cleaves 
         to me? My strength has left me; my soul has mingled with thine; I am not, 
         and yet I am. Is it Thy weakness that I feel?"  
       </p><p>"Nay, O lover, for it is only at the price of the illusion of my strength 
         that thou hast given me the pleasure of unity which I have tasted in thine 
         arms. Beauty has conquered me and drunk up the strength of my might; I 
         am alone, and all things are mine in the mystery of my loneliness.  
       </p><p>"Evoe!" life burns in the brasier of love as a ruby flame in a sapphire 
         bowl. I am dead, yet I live for ever!"  
       </p><p>Arise, O sleeper, for the night of loneliness hath rolled up the hangings 
         of her couch, and my heart is burning like a sun of molten brass; awake 
         before the Beast riseth and enter the {227} sanctuary of Eden and defile 
         the children of dawn. Thou Child-Man, cast off the cloak of dreams who 
         before thy sleep wast enraptured with the strength of love. Fair and fresh 
         didst thou come from the woods when the world was young, with breast like 
         the snowy hills in the sunlight, and thine hair as a wind-ravished forest 
         of oak, and thine eyes deep and still as the lakes of the mountains. No 
         veil covered thee, and thou didst revel naked in the laughter of the Dawn, 
         and under the kisses of mid-day didst thou leap with the sun, and the 
         caressing hands of night laid thee to rest in the cradle of the moon. 
         Thoughts did not tempt thee, Reason played not the prude with thee, nor 
         imagination the wanton. Radiant child that thou art, thou didst grow in 
         the light that shone from thine eyes, no shadow of darkness fell across 
         thy path: thy love was strong and pure --- bright as the stars of night, 
         and deep as the echoing depths of hills of amber, and emerald, and vermilion.  
       </p><p>Awake! tear from thy limbs the hempen ropes of darkness, arise! --- fire 
         the beacon of the awakenment of the nations, and night shall heave as 
         an harlot great with child, and purity shall be born of corruption, and 
         the light shall quiver through the darkness, an effulgence of opals like 
         the beams of many colours irradiated from the L. V. X.  
       </p><p>Through the night of reckoning hast thou passed,and thy path hath been 
         wound around the land of darkness under the clouds of sleep. Thou hast 
         cleft the horizon as a babe the womb of its mother, and scattered the 
         gloom of night, and shouted in thy joy: "Let there be light!" Now that 
         thou has seized the throne, thou shalt pass the portals of the tomb and 
         enter the Temple beyond. {228}  
       </p><p>There thou shalt stand upon the great watch-tower of Day, where all is 
         awakenment, and gaze forth on the kingdom of the vine and the land of 
         the houses of coolness. Thou shalt conquer the Empire of the Sceptre, 
         and usurp the Kingdom of the Crown, for thou art as a little child, and 
         none shall harm thee, no evil form shall spring up against thee. For Yesterday 
         is in thy right hand, and To-morrow in thy left, and To-day is as the 
         breath of thy lips. ........  
       </p><p>I am the Unveiled One standing between the two horizons, as the sun between 
         the arms of Day and Night. My light shineth upon all men, and none can 
         do me harm, neither can the sway of my rule be broken. I am the Unveiled 
         one and the Unveiler and the Re-veiler; the world lieth below me and before 
         me, and in the brilliance of mine eyes crouch the images of things that 
         be. Space I unroll as a scroll, and Time chimeth from mine hand as the 
         voice of a silver bell. I ring out the birth and the death of nations, 
         and when I rise worlds pass away as feathers of smoke before the hurricane. 
         .....  
       </p><p>Yet, O divine Youth who has created thyself! What art thou? Thou art 
         the birthless and the deathless one, without beginning and without end! 
         Thou paintest the heavens bright with rays of pure emerald light, for 
         thou art Lord of the beams of Light. Thou illuminest the two lands with 
         rays of turquoise and beryl, and sapphire, and amethyst; for Lord of Love, 
         Lord of Life, Lord of Immensity, Lord of Everlastingness is thy name. 
         Thou hast become as a tower of Effulgence, whose foundations are set in 
         the hearts of me, yea! as a mountain of chrysoleth slumbering in the Crown 
         of Glory! whose summit is God!
