           <p>FRA. P.</p>
           <p>{Illustration facing page 145 described:</p>
           <p>This is a figure in the shape of an Ankh, with symbols about and 
             upon the form. The loop is a series of four concentric bands like 
             the Rose cross, about a central circle. The central circle is quartered 
             by a vertical Greek cross. This cross has a dot in the center and 
             is marked "Red on white." The ring just about this circle 
             is divided by radial segments into three chambers, with one centered 
             at top; clockwise from top, the chambers are marked: "Bright 
             pale yellow", "Glowing orange scarlet", "Deep 
             blue". The next ring outward is divided into seven chambers, 
             one to bottom, and marked clockwise from 1 o'clock: "Violet", 
             "Indigo", "Blue", "Emerald Green", "Yellow", 
             "Orange", "Red". The next ring outward is divided 
             into twelve chambers, division at top and bottom with six to either 
             side; clockwise from 1 o'clock: "Crimson", "Violet", 
             "Indigo", "Blue", "Green blue", "Emerald 
             Green", "Green Yellowish", "Yellow Greenish", 
             "Amber", "Orange", "Red Orange", "Scarlet". 
             The outer ring is interrupted at the bottom by a segment to match 
             the continuation of the sloping lower sides of the lower upright, 
             the base of this segment is defined not by the ring but by the upper 
             portion of two diagonals drawn from the inner angles of the cross. 
             This five-sided semi-regular figure is further divided within by two 
             crossed lines emanating from the upper corners and extending across 
             the center to the midpoints of the lower sides. In the four chambers 
             resulting are these color abbreviations, clockwise from top: "Blk" 
             (for black), "Russ" (for russet), "Cit'n" (for 
             citrine), "Olive". To either side of this section, on the 
             band itself, is written "white merging into grey". In the 
             top of this outermost ring are these letters in the "Theban Alphabet": 
             u r h --- signifying the "Angel" or "God of Tarot", 
             HRU.</p>
           <p>The left arm of the Ankh has from left to right: the symbol of Scorpio 
             (the "M" style, not the Eagle as noted in text), a cup, 
             the words "Deep Blue; Symbols in yellow". The right arm 
             of the Ankh has from left to right: "the words "Red; symbols 
             in Green", a lotus wand, the symbol of Leo.</p>
           <p>The basal upright of the Ankh has these in the lower half only, from 
             bottom upward: the symbol of Aquarius, an upright sword in style of 
             the Solomonic Key, the words "Yellow; symbols in Violet.</p>
           <p>There are markings and symbols outside the shape of the Ankh: Upper 
             left corner: "L-I-F-E-" above a large "T". Upper 
             right corner: "V-I-T-A-" above a large "A". To 
             left of base: large "O". To right of base: large "P". 
             Below base: "B-I-O-S-" just above the caption "THE 
             COMPLETE SYMBOL OF THE TAROT". The large letters spell "TARO" 
             in Greek capitals ( GR:Tau-Alpha-Rho-Omicron). In the wedges defined 
             by the lower sides of the cross-arms and the base upright sides: to 
             left an upright pentagram with the dot-in-circle Sun symbol in its 
             pentagonal center. To right the same, but with a crescent moon, horns 
             to right.</p>
           <p>There is a very small semi-italic note at the lower right, below 
             all else: "["To face p." 145" }</p>

           <p>OF THE ACES</p>
           <p>FIRST in order and importance are the Four Aces, representing the 
             Force of the Spirit, acting in, and binding together, the Four Scales 
             of each Element: and answering to the Dominion of the Letters of the 
             Name in the Kether of each. They represent the Radical Forces.</p>
           <p>The Four Aces are said to be placed on the North Pole of the Universe 
             wherein they revolve, governing its revolution; and ruling as the 
             connecting link between Yetzirah and the Material Plane or Universe.</p>

           <p>A WHITE Radiating Angelic Hand, issuing from clouds, and grasping 
             a heavy club, which has three branches in the colours, and with the 
             sigils, of the scales. The Right-and Left-hand branches end respectively 
             in three Flames, and the Centre one in four Flames: thus yielding 
             Ten: the Number of the Sephiroth. Two-and-twenty leaping Flames, or 
             Yodh, surround it, answering to the Paths; of these, three fall below 
             the Right branch for Aleph, Men, and Shin, seven above the Central 
             branch for the double letters; and between it and that of the Right 
             twelve: six above and six below about the Left-hand branch. The whole 
             is a great and flaming Torch. It symbolizes Force --- strength, rush, 
             vigour, energy, and it governs, according to its nature, various works 
             and questions.</p>
           <p>It implies Natural, as opposed to Invoked, Force.</p>

           <p>A WHITE Radiant Angelic Hand, issuing from clouds, and supporting 
             on the palm thereof a cup, resembling that of the Stolistes.</p>
           <p>From it rises a fountain of clear and glistening water: and sprays 
             falling on all sides into clear calm water below, in which grow Lotuses 
             and Water- lilies. The great Letter of the Supernal Mother is traced 
             in the spray of the Fountain.</p>
           <p>It symbolizes Fertility --- productiveness, beauty, pleasure, happiness, 
             etc.</p>

             from which depend, on the right, the olive branch of Peace; and on 
             the left, the palm branch of suffering.</p>
           <p>Six Vaus fall from its point. It symbolizes "Invoked," 
             as contrasted with Natural Force: for it is the Invocation of the 
             Sword. Raised upward, it invokes the Divine crown of Spiritual Brightness, 
             but reversed it is the Invocation of Demonic Force; and becomes a 
             fearfully evil symbol. It represents, therefore, very great power 
             for good or evil, but invoked; and it also represents whirling Force, 
             and strength through trouble. It is the affirmation of Justice upholding 
             Divine Authority; and it may become the Sword of Wrath, Punishment, 
             and Affliction.</p>

           <p>A WHITE Radiant Angelic Hand, holding a branch of a Rose Tree, whereon 
             is a large Pentacle, formed of Five concentric circles. The Innermost 
             Circle is white, charged with a red Greek Cross. From this White Centre,

           <p>It represents materiality in all senses, good and evil: and is, therefore,

           <p align="center"><strong><big>"The Four Kings"</big></strong></p>
           <p>THE Four Kings, or "Figures mounted on steeds," represent 
             the Yodh forces of the Name in each Suit: the Radix, Father and commencement 
             of Material Forces, a force in which all the others are implied, and 
             of which they form the development and completion. A force swift and 
             violent in its action, but whose effect soon passes away, and therefore 
             symbolized by a Figure on a Steed riding swiftly, and clothed in complete 
             Armour.</p>
           <p>Therefore is the knowledge of the scale of the King so necessary 
             for the commencement of all magical working.</p>
           <p>"The Four Queens"</p>
           <p>are seated upon Thrones; representing the Forces of the He of the 
             Name in each suit; the Mother and bringer-forth of Material Forces: 
             a force which develops and realizes that of the King: a force steady 
             and unshaken, but not rapid, though enduring. It is therefore symbolized 
             by a Figure seated upon a Throne: but also clothed in Armour.</p>
           <p>"The Four Princes"</p>
           <p>These Princes are Figures seated in Chariots, and thus borne forward. 
             They represent the Vau Forces of the Name in each suit: the Mighty 
             Son of the King and Queen, who realizes the influence of both scales 
             of Force. A Prince, the son of a King and Queen, yet a Prince of Princes, 
             and a King of Kings: an Emperor whose effect is at once rapid (though 
             not so swift as that of the Queen) and enduring. It is, therefore, 
             symbolized by a Figure borne in a Chariot, and clothed in Armour. 
             Yet is his power vain and illusionary, unless set in Motion by his 
             Father and Mother. "The Four Princesses"</p>
           <p>are the Knaves of the Tarot Pack; The Four Princesses or figures 
             of Amazons, standing firmly of themselves: neither riding upon Horses, 
             nor seated upon Thrones, nor borne in Chariots. They represent the 
             forces of the He final of the Name in each suit, completing the Influences 
             of the other scales: The mighty and potent daughter of a King and 
             Queen: a Princess powerful and terrible: a Queen of Queens --- an 
             Empress --- whose effect combines those of the King, Queen, and Prince, 
             at once violent and permanent; therefore symbolized by a Figure standing 
             firmly by itself, only partially draped, and having but little Armour; 
             yet her power existeth not, save by reason of the others: and then 
             indeed it is mighty and terrible materially, and is the Throne of 
             the Forces of the Spirit.</p>
           <p>Woe unto whomsoever shall make war upon her, when thus established!</p>

             from it. Beneath her feet are white clouds.</p>

           <p>There being thirty-six Decans and seven Planets, it follows that 
             one of the latter must rule over one more Decan than the others. This 
             is the Planet Mars, to which are allotted the last Decan of Pisces, 
             and the first of Aries, because the long cold of the winter requires 
             a great energy to overcome it, and initiate spring.</p>
           <p>And the beginning of the Decanates is from the royal Star of Leo, 
             the great Star Cor Leonis: and therefore is the first Decan that of 
             Saturn in Leo.</p>
           <p>Here follow the general meanings of the small cards of the suits, 
             as classified under the nine Sephiroth below Kether.</p>
           <p>HB:ChKMH The Four Twos symbolize the Powers of the King and Queen 
             just uniting and initiating the Force; but before the Prince and Princess 
             are thoroughly brought into action. Therefore do they generally imply 
             the initiation and fecundation of a thing.</p>
           <p>HB:BYNH Realization of action owing to the Prince being produced. 
             The central symbol on each card. Action definitely commenced for good 
             or evil.</p>
           <p>HB:ChSD Perfection, realization, completion: making a matter settled 
             and fixed.</p>
           <p>HB:GBVRH Opposition, strife and struggle: war; obstacle to the thing 
             in hand. Ultimate success or failure is otherwise shewn.</p>
           <p>HB:ThPARTh Definite accomplishment. Thing carried out.</p>
           <p>HB:NTzCh Generally shew a force transcending the Material Plane: 
             and is like unto a Crown; which, indeed, is powerful, but requireth 
             one capable of wearing it. The Sevens then shew a possible result: 
             which is dependent on the action then taken. They depend much on the 
             symbols that accompany them.</p>
           <p>HB:HVD Solitary success: "i.e." success in the matter for 
             the time being: but not leading to much result apart from the thing

             They are clasped together in the grip of the First Order, "i.e." 
             the four fingers of each right hand crooked into each other, the thumbs 
             meeting above; and they hold, at the same time, by their centres, 
             five wands or torches which are similar unto the wands of a Zelator 
             Adeptus Minor. One wand is upright in the middle; the others cross 
             each other. Flames leap from the point of junction. Above the middle 
             wand is the sign Saturn, and below is that of Leo: thus representing 
             the Decante. Violent strife and boldness, rashness, cruelty, violence, 
             lust, desire, prodigality and generosity; depending on whether the

           <p>A WHITE Radiating Hand, as before, holds a group of lotuses or water-lilies, 
             from which two flowers rise on either side of, and overhanging the 
             top cup; pouring into it the white water. Flowers in the same way 
             pour white water into the lower cups. All the cups overflow; the topmost 
             into the two others, and these upon the lower part of the card. Cups 
             are arranged in an erect equilateral triangle. Mercury and Cancer

           <p align="center"><strong>BRIEF MEANING OF TWENTY-TWO KEYS</strong></p>
           <p>0. IF the question refers to spiritual matters, the Fool means idea, 
             thought, spirituality, that which endeavours to transcend Earth. But 
             if question is material, it means folly, stupidity, eccentricity, 
             or even mania. 1. Skill, wisdom, adaptation, craft, cunning, or occult 
             wisdom or power. 2. Change, alternation, increase and decrease, fluctuation; 
             whether for good or evil depends on the dignity. 3. Beauty, happiness, 
             pleasure, success. But with very bad dignity it means luxury, dissipation. 
             4. War, conquest, victory, strife, ambition. 5. Divine wisdom, manifestation, 
             explanation, teaching, occult force voluntarily invoked. 6. Inspiration 
             (passive, mediumistic), motive power, action. 7. Triumph, victory, 
             health (sometimes unstable). 8. Eternal justice. Strength and force, 
             but arrested as in act of judgment. May mean law, trial, etc. 9. Wisdom 
             from on high. Active divine inspiration. Sometimes "unexpected 
             current." 10. Good fortune, happiness (within bounds). Intoxication 
             of success. 11. Courage, strength, fortitude, power passing on to 
             action. Obstinacy. 12. Enforced sacrifice, punishment, loss, fatal 
             and not voluntary, suffering. 13. Time, age, transformation, change 
             involuntary (as opposed to 18, Pisces). Or death, destruction (only 
             latter with special cards). [Specially, a sudden and quite unexpected 
             change.] 14. Combination of forces, realization, action (material 
             effect, good or evil). 15. Materiality, material force, material temptation, 
             obsession. 16. Ambition, fighting, war, courage, or destruction, danger, 
             fall, ruin. 17. Hope, faith, unexpected help. Or dreaminess, deceived 
             hope, etc. 18. Dissatisfaction, voluntary change. Error, lying, falsity, 
             deception. This card is very sensitive to dignity. 19. Glory, gain, 
             riches. With "very" evil cards it means arrogance, display, 
             vanity. 20. Final decision, judgment, sentence, determination of a 
             matter without appeal, "on its plane." 21. The matter itself. 
             Synthesis, world, kingdom. Usually denotes actual subject of question, 
             and therefore depends entirely on accompanying cards. [This table 
             is very unsatisfactory. Each card must be most carefully meditated, 
             taking all its correspondences, and a clear idea formed.] Princes 
             and Queens shew almost always actual men and women connected with 
             the matter. But the Kings (Knights) sometime represent coming or going 
             of a matter, according as they face.</p>

           <p><strong>OF THE DIGNITIES</strong></p>
           <p>A CARD is strong or weak, well dignified or ill dignified, according 
             to the cards next to it on either side.</p>
           <p>Cards of the same suit on either side strengthen it greatly, for 
             good or evil according to their nature.</p>
           <p>Cards of opposite natures on either side weaken it greatly, for either 
             good or evil.</p>
           <p>Swords are inimical to Pentacles.</p>
           <p>Wands are inimical to Cups.</p>
           <p>Swords are friendly with Cups and Wands.</p>
           <p>Wands are friendly with Swords and Pentacles.</p>
           <p>If a card fall between two other which are mutually contrary, it 
             is not much affected by either.</p>
           <p align="center"><strong>A METHOD OF DIVINATION BY THE TAROT</strong></p>
           <p>[This method is that given to students of the grade Adept Adeptus 
             Minor in the R. R. et A. C. But it has been revised and improved, 
             while certain safeguards have been introduced in order to make its 
             abuse impossible. --- O.M.]</p>
           <p>1. THE Significator. Choose a card to represent the Querent, using 
             your knowledge or judgment of his character rather than dwelling on 
             his physical characteristics. 2. Take the cards in your left hand. 
             In the right hand hold the wand over them, and say: I invoke thee, 
             I A O, that thou wilt send H R U, the great Angel that is set over 
             the operations of this Secret Wisdom, to lay his hand invisibly upon 
             these consecrated cards of art, that thereby we may obtain true knowledge 
             of hidden things, to the glory of thine ineffable Name. Amen. 3. Hand 
             the cards to Querent, and bid him think of the question attentively, 
             and cut. 4. Take the cards as cut, and hold as for dealing. "First 
             Operation"</p>
           <p>This shows the situation of the Querent at the time when he consults 
             you.</p>
           <p>1. The pack being in front of you, cut, and place the top half to 
             the left. 2. Cut each pack again to the left. 3. These four stack 
             represent I H V H, from right to left. 4. Find the Significator. It 
             be in the HB:Y pack, the question refers to work, business, etc.; 
             if in the HB:H pack, to love, marriage, or pleasure; if in the HB:H 
             pack, to money, goods, and such purely material matters. 5. Tell the 
             Querent what he has come for: if wrong, abandon the divination. 6. 
             If right, spread out the pack containing the Significator, face upwards. 
             Count the cards from him, in the direction in which he faces. The 
             counting should include the card from which you count. For Knights, 
             Queens and Princes, count 4. For Princesses, count 7. For Aces, count 
             11. For small cards, count according to the number. For trumps, count 
             3 for the elemental trumps; 9 for the planetary trumps; 12 for the 
             Zodiacal trumps. Make a "story" of these cards. This story 
             is that of the beginning of the affair. 7. Pair the cards on either 
             side of the Significator, then those outside them, and so on. Make 
             another "story," which should fill in the details omitted 
             in the first. 8. If this story is not quite accurate, do not be discouraged. 
             Perhaps the Querent himself does not know everything. But the main 
             lines ought to be laid down firmly, with correctness, or the divination 
             should be abandoned. "Second Operation"</p>
           <p>Development of the Question</p>
           <p>1. Shuffle, invoke suitably, and let Querent cut as before. 2. Deal 
             cards into twelve stacks, for the twelve astrological houses of heaven. 
             3. Make up your mind in which stack you ought to find the Significator, 
             "e.g." in the seventh house if the question concerns marriage, 
             and so on. 4. Examine this chosen stack. If the Significator is not 
             there, try some cognate house. On a second failure, abandon the divination. 
             5. Read the stack counting and pairing as before. "Third Operation"</p>
           <p>Further Development of the Question</p>
           <p>1. Shuffle, etc., as before. 2. Deal cards into twelve stacks for 
             the twelve signs of the Zodiac. 3. Divine the proper stack and proceed 
             as before. "Fourth Operation"</p>
           <p>Penultimate Aspects of the Question</p>
           <p>1. Shuffle, etc., as before. 2. Find the Significator: set him upon 
             the table; let the thirty-six cards following form a ring round him. 
             3. Count and pair as before. [Note that the nature of each Decan is 
             shewn by the small card attributed to it, and by the symbols given 
             in Liber DCCLXXVII, cols. 149-151.] "Fifth Operation"</p>
           <p>Final Result</p>
           <p>1. Shuffle, etc., as before. 2. Deal into ten packs in the form of 
             the Tree of Life. 3. Make up your mind where the Significator should 
             be, as before; but failure does not here necessarily imply that the 
             divination has gone astray. 4. Count and pair as before. [Note that 
             one cannot tell at what part of the divination the present time occurs. 
             Usually Op. 1 seems to indicate the past history of the question; 
             but not always so. Experience will teach. Sometimes a new current 
             of high help may show the moment of consultation. I may add that in 
             material matters this method is extremely valuable. I have been able 
             to work out the most complex problems in minute detail. O.M.] </p>
