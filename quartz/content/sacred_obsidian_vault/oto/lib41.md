 <p>SINCE nobody can have the presumption to doubt the demonstration of St. Thomas 
   Aquinas that this world is the best of all possible worlds, it follows that 
   the imperfect condition of things which I am about to describe can only obtain 
   in some other universe; probably the whole affair is but the figment of my diseased 
   imagination. Yet if this be so, how can we reconcile the disease with perfection?</p>
 <p>Clearly there is something wrong here; the apparent syllogism turns out on 
   examination to be an enthymeme with a suppressed and impossible Major. There 
   is no progression on these lines, and what I foolishly mistook for a nice easy 
   way to glide into my story proves but the blindest of blind alleys.</p>
 <p>We must begin therefore by the simple and austere process of beginning.</p>
 <p>The conditions of Japan was at this time (what time? Here we are in trouble 
   with the historian at once. But let me say that I will have no interference 
   with my story on the part of all these dull sensible people. I am going straight 
   on, and if the reviews are unfavourable, one has always the resource of suicide) 
   dangerously unstable. The warrior aristocracy of the Upper House had been so 
   diluted with successful cheesemongers that adulteration had become a virtue 
   as highly profitable as adultery. In the Lower House brains were still esteemed, 
   but they had been interpreted as the knack of passing examinations.</p>
 <p>The recent extension of the franchise to women had rendered the Yoshiwara the 
   most formidable of the political organizations, while the physique of the nation 
   had been seriously impaired by the results of a law which, by assuring them 
   in case of injury or illness of a life-long competence of idleness which they 
   could never have obtained otherwise by the most laborious toil, encouraged all 
   workers to be utterly careless of their health. The training of servants indeed 
   at this time consisted solely of careful practical instruction in the art of 
   falling down stairs; and the richest man in the country was an ex-butler who, 
   by breaking his leg on no less than thirty-eight occasions, had acquired a pension 
   which put that of a field-marshal altogether into the shade. </p>
 <p>As yet, however, the country was not yet irretrievably doomed. A system of 
   intrigue and blackmail, elaborated by the governing classes to the highest degree 
   of efficiency, acted as a powerful counterpoise. In theory all were equal; in 
   practice the permanent officials, the real rulers of the country, were a distinguished 
   and trustworthy body of men. Their interest was to govern well, for any civil 
   or foreign disturbance would undoubtedly have fanned the sparks of discontent 
   into the roaring flame of revolution.</p>
 <p>And discontent there was. The unsuccessful cheesemongers were very bitter against 
   the Upper House; and those who had failed in examinations wrote appalling diabetes 
   against the folly of the educational system.</p>
 <p>The trouble was that they were right; the government was well enough in fact, 
   but in theory had hardly a leg to stand on. In view of the growing clamour, 
   the official classes were perturbed; for many of their number were intelligent 
   enough to see that a thoroughly irrational system, however well it may work 
   in practice, cannot for ever be maintained against the attacks of those who, 
   though they may be secretly stigmatized as doctrinaires, can bring forward unanswerable 
   arguments. The people had power, but not reason; so were amenable to the fallacies 
   which they mistook for reason and not to the power which they would have imagined 
   to be tyranny. An intelligent plebs is docile; and educated canaille expects 
   everything to be logical. The shallow sophisms of the socialist were intelligible; 
   they could not be refuted by the profounder and therefore unintelligible propositions 
   of the Tory.</p>
 <p>The mob could understand the superficial resemblance of babies; they could 
   not be got to understand that the circumstances of education and environment 
   made but a small portion of the equipment of a conscious being. The brutal and 
   truthful "You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear" had been 
   forgotten for the smooth and plausible fallacies of such writers as Ki Ra Di.</p>
 <p>So serious had the situation become, indeed, that the governing classes had 
   abandoned all dogmas of Divine Right and the like as untenable. The theory of 
   heredity had broken down, and the ennoblement of the cheesemongers made it not 
   only false, but ridiculous.</p>
 <p>We consequently find them engaged in the fatuous task of defending the anomalies 
   which disgusted the nation by a campaign of glaring and venal sophistries. These 
   deceived nobody, and only inspired the contempt, which might have been harmless, 
   with a hate which threatened to engulph the community in an abyss of the most 
   formidable convulsions.</p>
 <p>Such was the razor-edge upon which the unsteady feet of the republic strode 
   when, a few years before the date of my visit, the philosoÃ¿her Kwaw landed at 
   Nagasaki after an exhilarating swim from the mainland.</p>
 <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>II</strong></font></p>
 <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>"STANDING ALONE."</strong></font></p>
 <p>KWAW, when he crossed the Yellow Sea, was of the full age of thirty-two years. 
   The twenty previous equinoxes had passed over his head as he wandered, sole 
   human tenant, among the colossal yet ignoble ruins of Wei Hai Wei. His only 
   companions were the lion and the lizard, who frequented the crumbling remains 
   of the officers' quarters; while in the little cemetery the hoofs of the wild 
   ass beat (uselessly, if he wished to wake them) upon the tombs of the sportsmen 
   that once thronged those desolate halls.</p>
 <p>During this time Kwaw devoted his entire attention to the pursuit of philosophy; 
   for the vast quantities of excellent stores abandoned by the British army left 
   him no anxiety upon the score of hunger.</p>
 <p>In the first year he disciplined and conquered his body and its emotions.</p>
 <p>In the next six years he disciplined and conquered his mind and its thoughts.</p>
 <p>In the next two years he had reduced the Universe to the Yang and the Yin and 
   their permutations in the trigrams of Fo-hi and the hexagrams of King Wu.</p>
 <p>In the last year he abolished the Yang and the Yin, and became united with 
   the great Tao.</p>
 <p>All this was very satisfactory to Kwaw. But even his iron frame had become 
   somewhat impaired by the unvarying diet of tinned provisions; and it was perhaps 
   only by virtue of the talisman that he succeeded in his famous attempt to outdo 
   the feats of Captain Webb. Nor was his reception less than a triumph. So athletic 
   a nation as the Japanese still were could not but honour so superb an achievement, 
   though it cost them dear, inasmuch as the Navy League (by an astute series of 
   political moves) compelled the party in power to treble the Navy, build a continuous 
   line of forts around the sea-coast, and expend many billions of yen upon the 
   scientific breeding of a more voracious species of shark than had hitherto infested 
   their shores.</p>
 <p>So they carried Kwaw shoulder-high to the Yoshiwara, and passed him the glad 
   hand, and called out the Indians, and annexed his personal property for relics, 
   and otherwise followed the customs of the best New York Society, while the German 
   Band accompanied the famous Ka Ru So to the following delightful ballad:</p>

 <p>One need not be intimately familiar with the Japanese character to understand 
   that Kwaw and his feat were forgotten in a very few days; but a wealthy Daimio, 
   with a taste for observation, took it into his head to inquire of Kwaw for what 
   purpose he had entered the country in so strange a manner. It will simplify 
   matters if I reproduce in extenso the correspondence, which was carried on by 
   telegram. </p>
 <ol>
   <li>Who is your honourable self, and why has your excellency paid us cattle 
     the distinguished compliment of a visit?</li>
   <li>This disgusting worm is great Tao. I humbly beg of your sublime radiance 
     to trample his slave.</li>
   <li>Regret great toe unintelligible.</li>
   <li>Great Tao  T.A.O.  Tao.</li>
   <li>What is the great Tao?</li>
   <li>The result of subtracting the universe from itself.</li>
   <li>Good, but this decaying dog cannot grant your honourable excellency's sublime 
     desire, but, on the contrary, would earnestly pray your brilliant serenity 
     to spit upon his grovelling "joro."</li>
   <li>Profound thought assures your beetle-headed suppliant that your glorious 
     nobility must meet him before the controversy can be decided.</li>
   <li>True. Would your sublimity condescend to defile himself by entering this 
     muck-sweeper's miserable hovel?</li>
   <li>Expect leprous dragon with beri beri at your high mightiness's magnificent 
     heavenly palace to-morrow (Thursday) afternoon at three sharp.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>Thus met Kwaw, the poet-philosopher of China; and Juju, the godfather of his 
   country.</p>
 <p>Sublime moment in eternity! To the names of Joshua and Hezekiah add that of 
   Kwaw! For though he was a quarter of an hour late for the appointment, the hands 
   went back on the dial of Juju's chronometer, so that no shadow of distrust or 
   annoyance clouded the rapture of that supreme event.</p>
 <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>III</strong></font></p>
 <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>"THE MANIFESTING OF SIMPLICITY."</strong></font></p>
 <p>"WHAT," said Juju, "O great Tao, do you recommend as a remedy 
   for the ills of my unhappy country?"</p>
 <p>The sage replied as follows: "O mighty and magniloquent Daimio, your aristocracy 
   is not an aristocracy because it is not an aristocracy. In vain you seek to 
   alter this circumstance by paying the noxious vermin of the Dai Li Pai Pur to 
   write fatuous falsehoods maintaining that your aristocracy is an aristocracy 
   because it is an aristocracy.</p>
 <p>"As Heracleitus overcame the antinomy of Xenophanes and Parmenides, Melissus 
   and the Eleatic Zero, and Ens and the Non-Ens by his Becoming, so let me say 
   to you; the aristocracy will be an aristocracy by becoming an aristocracy.</p>
 <p>"Ki Ra Di and his dirty-faced friends wish to level down the good practice 
   to the bad theory; you should oppose them be levelling up the bad theory to 
   the good practice.</p>
 <p>"Your enviers boast that you are no better than they; prove to them that 
   they are as good as you. They speak of a nobility of fools and knaves; show 
   to them wise and honest men, and the socialistic ginger is no longer hot in 
   the individualistic mouth."</p>
 <p>Juju grunted assent. He had gone almost to sleep, but Kwaw, absorbed in his 
   subject, never noticed the fact. He went on with the alacrity of a steam-roller, 
   and the direct and purposeful vigour of a hypnotized butterfly. "Man is 
   perfect by his identity with the great Tao. Subsidiary to this he must have 
   balanced perfectly the Yang and the Yin. Easier still is it to rule the sixfold 
   star of Intellect; while for the base the control of the body and its emotions 
   is the earliest step.</p>
 <p>"Equilibrium is the great law, and perfect equilibrium is crowned by identity 
   with the great Tao."</p>
 <p>He emphasized this sublime assertion by a deliberate blow upon the protruding 
   abdomen of the worthy Juju.</p>
 <p>"Pray continue your honourable discourse!" exclaimed the half-awakened 
   Daimio.</p>
 <p>Kwaw went on, and I think it only fair to say that he went on for a long time, 
   and that because you have been fool enough to read thus far, you have no excuse 
   for being fool enough to read farther.</p>
 <p>"Phenacetin is a useful drug in fever, but woe to that patient who shall 
   imbibe it in collapse. Because calomel is a dangerous remedy in appendicitis, 
   we do not condemn its use in simple indigestions.</p>
 <p>"As above so beneath! said Hermes the thrice greatest. The laws of the 
   physical world are precisely paralleled by those of the moral and intellectual 
   sphere. To the prostitute I prescribe a course of training by which she shall 
   comprehend the holiness of sex. Chastity forms part of that training, and I 
   should hope to see her one day a happy wife and mother. To the prude equally 
   I prescribe a course of training by which she shall comprehend the holiness 
   of sex. Unchastity forms part of that training, and I should hope to see her 
   one day a happy wife and mother.</p>
 <p>"To the bigot I commend a course of Thomas Henry Huxley; to the infidel 
   a practical study of ceremonial magic. Then, when the bigot has knowledge and 
   the infidel faith, each may follow without prejudice his natural inclination; 
   for he will no longer plunge into his former excesses.</p>
 <p>"So also she who was a prostitute from native passion may indulge with 
   safety in the pleasure of love; she who was by nature cold may enjoy a virginity 
   in no wise marred by her disciplinary course of unchastity. But the one will 
   understand and love the other.</p>
 <p>"I have been taxed with assaulting what is commonly known as virtue. True; 
   I hate it, but only in the same degree that I hate what is commonly known as 
   vice.</p>
 <p>"So it must be acknowledged that one who is but slightly unbalanced needs 
   a milder correction than whoso is obsessed by prejudice. There are men who make 
   a fetish of cleanliness; they shall work in a fitter's shop, and learn that 
   dirt is the mark of honourable toil. There are those whose lives are rendered 
   wretched by the fear of infection; they see bacteria of the deadliest sort in 
   all things but the actual solutions of carbolic acid and mercuric chloride with 
   which they hysterically combat their invisible foemen; such would I send to 
   live in the bazaar at Delhi, where they shall haply learn that dirt makes little 
   difference after all.</p>
 <p>"There are slow men who need a few months' experience of the hustle of 
   the stockyards; there are business men in a hurry, and they shall travel in 
   Central Asia to acquire the art of repose.</p>
 <p>"So much for the equilibrium, and for two months in every year each member 
   of your governing classes shall undergo this training under skilled advice.</p>
 <p>"But what of the Great Tao? For one month in every year each of these 
   men shall seek desperately for the Stone of the Philosophers. By solitude and 
   fasting for the social and luxurious, by drunkenness and debauch for the austere, 
   by scourging for those afraid of physical pain, by repose for the restless, 
   and toil for the idle, by bull-fights for the humanitarian, and the care of 
   little children for the callous, by rituals for the rational, and by philosophy 
   for the credulous, shall these men, while yet unbalanced, seek to attain to 
   unity with the great Tao. But for those whose intellect is purified and co-ordinated, 
   for those whose bodies are in health, and whose passions are at once eager and 
   controlled, it shall be lawful to choose their own way to the One Goal; videlicet, 
   identity with that great Tao which is above the antithesis of Yang and Yin."</p>
 <p>Even Kwaw felt tired, and applied himself to sakÃ©-and-soda. Refreshed, he continued: 
   "The men who are willing by this means to become the saviours of their 
   country shall be called the Synagogue of Satan, so as to keep themselves from 
   the friendship of the fools who mistake names for things. There shall be masters 
   of the Synagogue, but they shall never seek to dominate. They shall most carefully 
   abstain from inducing any man to seek the Tao by any other way than that of 
   equilibrium. They shall develop individual genius without considering whether 
   in their opinion its fruition will tend to the good or evil of their country 
   or of the world; for who are they to interfere with a soul whose balance has 
   been crowned by the most holy Tao?</p>
 <p>"The masters shall be great men among men; but among great men they shall 
   be friends.</p>
 <p>"Since equilibrium will have become perfect, a greater than Napoleon shall 
   arise, and the peaceful shall rejoice thereat; a greater than Darwin, and the 
   minister in his pulpit give open thanks to God.</p>
 <p>"The instructed infidel shall no longer sneer at the church-goer, for 
   he will have been compelled to go to church until he saw the good points as 
   well as the bad; and the instructed devotee will no longer detest the blasphemer, 
   because he will have laughed with Ingersoll and Saladin.</p>
 <p>"Give the lion the heart of the lamb, and the lamb the force of the lion; 
   and they will lie down in peace together."</p>
 <p>Kwaw ceased, and the heavy and regular breathing of Juju assured him that his 
   words had not been wasted; at last that restless and harried soul had found 
   supreme repose.</p>
 <p>Kwaw tapped the gong. "I have achieved my task," said he to the obsequious 
   major-domo, "I pray leave to retire from the Presence." "I beg 
   your excellency to follow me," replied the gorgeous functionary, "his 
   lordship has commanded me to see that your holiness is supplied with everything 
   that you desire." Then the sage laughed aloud.</p>
 <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>IV</strong></font></p>
 <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>"THINGS TO BE BELIEVED."</strong></font></p>
 <p>SIX months passed by, and Juju, stirring in his sleep, remembered the duties 
   of politeness, and asked for Kwaw.</p>
 <p>"He is on your lordship's estate at Nikko," the servants hastened 
   to reply, "and he has turned the whole place completely upside down. Millions 
   of yen have been expended monthly; he has even mortgaged this very palace in 
   which your lordship has been asleep; a body of madmen has seized the reins of 
   government"</p>
 <p>"The Synagogue of Satan!" gasped the outraged Daimio.</p>
 <p>"And you are everywhere hailed as the Godfather of your country!"</p>
 <p>"Do not tell me that the British war has ended disastrously for us!" 
   and he called for the elaborate apparatus of hari-kari.</p>
 <p>"On the contrary, my lord, the ridiculous Sa Mon, who would never go to 
   sea because he was afraid of being sick, although his genius for naval strategy 
   had no equal in the Seven Abysses of Water, after a month as stowaway on a fishing 
   boat (by the order of Kwaw) assumed the rank of Admiral of the Fleet, and has 
   inflicted a series of complete and crushing defeats upon the British Admirals, 
   who though they had been on the water all their lives, had incomprehensibly 
   omitted to acquire any truly accurate knowledge of the metaphysical systems 
   of Sho Pi Naour and Ni Tchze.</p>
 <p>"Again, Hu Li, the financial genius, who had hitherto been practically 
   useless to his country on account of that ugliness and deformity which led him 
   to shun the society of his fellows, was compelled by Kwaw to exhibit himself 
   as a freak. A fortnight of this cured him of shyness; and within three months 
   he has nearly doubled the revenue and halved the taxes. Your lordship has spent 
   millions of yen; but is to-day a richer man than when your excellency went to 
   sleep."</p>
 <p>"I will go and see this Kwaw," said the Daimio. The servants then 
   admitted that the Mikado in person had been waiting at the palace door for over 
   three months, for the very purpose of begging permission to conduct him thither, 
   but that he had been unwilling to disturb the sleep of the Godfather of his 
   country.</p>
 <p>Impossible to describe the affecting scene when these two magnanimous beings 
   melted away (as it were) in each other's arms.</p>
 <p>Arrived at the estate of Juju at Nikko, what wonder did these worthies express 
   to see the simple means by which Kwaw had worked his miracles! In a glade of 
   brilliant cherry and hibiscus (and any other beautiful trees you can think of) 
   stood a plain building of stone, which after all had not cost millions of yen, 
   but a very few thousands only. Its height was equal to its breadth, and its 
   length was equal to the sum of these, while the sum of these three meas urements 
   was precisely equal to ten times the age of Kwaw in units of the span of his 
   hand. The walls were tremendously thick and there was only one door and two 
   windows, all in the eye of the sunset. One cannot describe the inside of the 
   building, because to do so would spoil all the fun for other people. It must 
   be seen to be understood, in any case; and there it stands to this day, open 
   to anybody who is strong enough to force in the door.</p>
 <p>But when they asked for Kwaw, he was not to be found. He had left trained men 
   to carry out the discipline and the initiations, these last being the chief 
   purpose of the building, saying that he was homesick for the lions and lizards 
   of Wei-Hai-Wei, and that anyway he hadn't enjoyed a decent swim for far too 
   long.</p>
 <p>There is unfortunately little room for doubt that the new and voracious species 
   of sharks (which Japanese patriotism had spent such enormous sums in breeding) 
   is responsible for the fact that he has never again been heard of.</p>
 <p>The Mikado wept; but, brightening up, exclaimed: "Kwaw found us a confused 
   and angry mob; he left us a diverse, yet harmonious, republic; while let us 
   never forget that not only have we developed men of genius in every branch of 
   practical life, but many among us have had our equilibrium crowned by that supreme 
   glory of humanity, realization of our identity with the great and holy Tao."</p>
 <p>Wherewith he set aside no less than three hundred and sixty-five days in every 
   year, and one extra day every fourth year, as days of special rejoicing.</p>

 <p>Assigned to the Adeptus Major Grade of the A\A\.</p>
 <p>At its original publication, this instruction was assigned neither a Document 
   Class nor a catalogue number. In fact, it has never been published with official 
   A\A\ sanction, outside of individual contemporary lineages. The formulation 
   of the A\A\ was, in 1907, in its early stages, and these details may not have 
   as yet been formalized. Later (in the "Syllabus" in Equinox I:10), 
   it was designated as a Class C Document, and given the number XLI. No explanation 
   was given for the assignment of this number. </p>
