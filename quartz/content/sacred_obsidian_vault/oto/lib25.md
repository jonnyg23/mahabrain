 <h1 align="center" class="title">LIBER XXV<br>
   THE STAR RUBY</h1>
 <p>Facing East, in the centre, draw deep deep deep thy breath closing thy mouth 
   with thy right forefinger prest against thy lower lip. Then dashing down the 
   hand with a great sweep back and out, expelling forcibly thy breath, cry APO 
   PANTOS KAKODAIMONOS. With the same forefinger touch thy forehead, and say SOI, 
   thy member, and say O PHALLE, [The secret sense of these words is to be sought 
   in the numeration thereof.], thy right shoulder, and say ISCHUROS, thy left 
   shoulder, and say EUCHARISTOS; then clasp thine hands, locking the fingers, 
   and cry IAÕ. Advance to the East. Imagine strongly a Pentagram, aright, in thy 
   forehead. Drawing the hands to the eyes, fling it forth, making the sign of 
   Horus and roar THÉRION. Retire thine hand in the sign of Hoor-paar-Kraat.</p>
 <p>Go round to the North and repeat; but say NUIT.</p>
 <p>Go round to the West and repeat; but whisper BABALON.</p>
 <p>Go round to the South and repeat; but bellow HADIT.</p>
 <p>Completing the circle widdershins, retire to the centre and raise thy voice 
   in the Paian, with these words IÕ PAN, with the signs of N.O.X.</p>
 <p>Extend the arms in the form of a Tau and say low but clear:<br>
   PRO MOU IUNGES OPICHÕ MOU TELETARCHAI EPI DEXIA CHUNOCHES EPARISTERA DAIMONOS 
   PHEG EI GAR PERI MOU O ASTÉR TÕN PENTE KAI EN TÉI STÉLÉI Õ ASTÉR TÕN EX ESTÉXE.</p>
 <p>Repeat the Cross Qabalistic, as above, and end as thou didst begin.</p>
