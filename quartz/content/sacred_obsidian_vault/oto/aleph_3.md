   DE MYSTERIO PRUDENTIAE.</h2>
 <p>Behold now nature, how prodigal is She of her Forces! The evident Will of every 
   Acorn is to become an Oak; yet nigh all fail of that Will. Therefore one Secret 
   of Magick is Oeconomy of thy Force; to do no Act unless secure of its Effect. 
   And if every Act has an Effect on every Plane, how canst thou do this unless 
   thou be connected with all Planes? For this Reason must thou know thoroughly 
   not only thy Body and thy Mind, but thy Body of Light and all its subtler Principles 
   soever. But I will have thee consider most especially what powers thou hast 
   within thee which are certainly capable of great Effects, yet which are constantly 
   wasted. Think then whether, if these Powers, frustrate of their End upon one 
   Plane, might not be turned to high Purpose and assured Success upon another. 
   For an hundred Acorns, rightly set in Conditions fit for their true Growth, 
   will become an hundred Oaks, while otherwise they make but one Meal for one 
   Hog, and their subtle Nature is wholly lost to them. Learn then, o my Son, this 
   Mystery of Oeconomy, and apply it faithfully and with Diligence in thy Work.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{beta }<br>
   DE ARTE ALCHEMICA.</h2>
 <p>Here then I must write concerning Talismans for thine Instruction. Know first 
   that there are certain Vehicles proper for the Incarnation of the Will. I instance 
   Paper, whereon by thine Art thou writest a symbolic Representation of thy Will, 
   so that when thou next seest it, thou are reminded of that Will, or it may be 
   that another, seeing it, will obey that Will. Here then is a case of Incarnation 
   and Assumption, which, before it was understood, was rightly considered Gramarye 
   or Magick. Again, thy Will to live causeth thee to plant Corn, which in due 
   Season being eaten is again transmuted into Will. Thus thou mayst in many Ways 
   impress any particular Will upon the proper Substance, so that by due Use thou 
   comest at last to its Accomplishment. So general is this Formula, in Truth, 
   that all conscious Actions may be included within its scope. There is also the 
   Converse, as when external Objects create Appetite, whose Satisfaction again 
   reacteth upon the physical Plane. Praise thou the wonder of the Mystery of Nature, 
   rising and falling with every Breath, so that there is no Part which is not 
   mystically Partaker of the Whole.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{gamma }<br>
   DE ARCANO SUBTILISSIMO.</h2>
 <p>O my Son, there is that within thee of marvellous Puissance which is by its 
   own Nature the Incarnation of thy Will, most ready to receive the Seal thereof. 
   Therein lie hidden all Powers, all Memories, more than thou hast teen thousand 
   fold! Learn then to draw from that great Treasure-House the Jewel of which thou 
   art in any present Need. For all things that are possible to thy Nature are 
   already hidden within thee; and thou hast but to name them, and to bring them 
   back into the Light of thy Consciousness. Then squander not this Gold of thine, 
   but put it to most fruitful Usury. Now then of the Art and Craft of this most 
   Holy Mystery I write not, for a Reason that thou already knowest. Moreover, 
   in this Matter, thou shalt best learn by thine own Experience, and thine Observation 
   in true Science shall guide thee. For this Secret is still of Magick, and Occult, 
   so that I know not certainly if thy Will lieth with my Way or no.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{delta }<br>
   DE MENSTRUO ARTIS.</h2>
 <p>But concerning the Medium by whose sensitive Nature our Magick Force is transmitted 
   to the Object of our Working, doubt not. For already in other Galaxies of Physics 
   have we been compelled to postulate an Aethyr wholly hypothetical in order to 
   explain the Phenomena of Light, Electricity, and the like; nor doeth any Man 
   demand Demonstration of the Existence of that Aethyr other than its Conformity 
   with general Law. Thou therefore, Creator and Transmitter of thine own Energy, 
   needest not to ask whether by this or by some other Means thou performest thy 
   Work. Yet I know not why this Aethyr of the Mathematicians and the Physicians 
   should not be one with the Astral Light, or Plastic Medium or Aub, Aud, Aur 
   (these three being a Trinity) of which our own Sages have spoken. And this Meditation 
   may bring forth much Knowledge physical, which is good, for that which is above 
   is like that which is beneath, and the Study of any Law leadeth to the Understanding 
   of all Law. So mayst thou learn in the End that there is no Law beyond Do what 
   thou wilt.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{epsilon }<br>
   DE NECESSITATE VOLUNTATIS.</h2>
 <p>And how then (mayest thou) shall I reconcile this Art Magick with that Way 
   of the Tao which achieveth all Things by doing nothing? But this have I already 
   declared to thee in Part, showing that thou canst do no Magick save it be thy 
   Nature to do Magick and so the true Nothing for thee. For to do nothing signifieth 
   to interfere with nothing so that for a Magician to do no Magick is to commit 
   Violence on himself. Yet learn also that all Action is in some sense Magick, 
   being an essential Part of that Great Magical Work which we call Nature. Then 
   thou hast no free Will? Verily, thou hast said. Yet nevertheless it is thy necessary 
   Destiny to act with that free Will. Thou canst do nothing save in accordance 
   with that true Nature of thine and of all Things, and every Phenomenon is the 
   Resultant of the Totality of Forces; Amen. Then thou needest take no Thought 
   and make no Effort? Thou sast sooth; yet, art thou not compelled to Thought 
   and Effort in the Way of Nature? Yea, I, thy Father, work for thee solicitously, 
   and also I laugh at thy Perplexities; for so was it fore-ordained that I should 
   do, by Me, from the Beginning.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{digamma }<br>
   DE COMEDIA UNIVERSA, QUAE DICTUR PAN.</h2>
 <p>So, therefore, o my Son, count thyself happy when thou understandest all these 
   Things, being one of those Beings (or By-comings) whom we call Philosophers. 
   All is a never ending Play of Love wherein our Lady Nuit and her Lord Hadit 
   rejoice; and every Part of the Play is Play. All pain is but sharp Sauce to 
   the Dish of Pleasure; for it is the Nature of the Universe that hath devised 
   this everlasting Banquet of Joy. And he that knoweth not this is necessary as 
   an Ingredient even as thou art; wouldst thou change all and spoil the Dish? 
   Art thou the Master-Cook? Yea, for thy Palate is become fine with thy great 
   Dalliance with the Food of Experience; therefore thou art one of them that rejoice. 
   Also it is thy Nature as it is mine, o my Son, to will that all Men share our 
   Mirth and Jollity; wherefore have I proclaimed my Law to Man, and thou continuest 
   in that Work of Joyance.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{zeta }<br>
   DE CAECITIA HOMINUM.</h2>
 <p>Learn also of my wisdom that this Vision of the Cosmos whereof I have written 
   unto thee is not given unto thy Sight at all Times; for in that Vision is all 
   Will fulfilled. Thou seest the Universe as None, and as One, and as many, and 
   the Play thereof; and therewith art thou (who art no longer thou) content. For 
   in one Phase art thou also None, in another One, and in the third an organised 
   and necessary Part of that great Structure, so that there is no more conflict 
   at all in thy whole By-coming. But now will I make Light for thine Eyes in this 
   Matter as thou gropest, asking: but of them that see not this, what sayst thou, 
   o my Father? But in that Vision thou sayst not thus, my Son! Learn then of me 
   the Secret Mystery of Illusion, and how it Worketh, and other Holy Law that 
   is its Nature, and of thine Action therein; for this is an Arcanum of the Wisdom 
   of the Magi, and proper unto thee that dwellest in the Land of Understanding.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{eta }<br>
   ALLEGORIA DE CAISSA.</h2>
 <p>Consider for an Example the Game and Play of the Chess, which is a Pastime 
   of Man, and worthy to exercise him in Thought, yet by no means necessary to 
   his Life, so that he sweepeth away Board and Pieces at the least Summons of 
   that which is truly dear to him. Thus unto him this Game is as it were an Illusion. 
   But insofar as he entereth into the Game he abideth by the Rules thereof, though 
   they be artificial and in no wise proper to his Nature; for in this Restriction 
   is all this Pleasure. Therefore, though he hath All-Oower to move the Pieces 
   at his own Will, he doth it not, enduring Loss, Indignity, and Defeat rather 
   than destroy that Artifice of Illusion. Think then that thou hast thyself created 
   this Shadow-world the Universe, and that it pleasureth thee to watch or to actuate 
   its Play according to the Law that thou hast made, which yet bindeth thee not 
   save only by Virtue of thine own Will to do thine own Pleasure therein.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{theta }<br>
   DE VERITATE FALSI.</h2>
 <p>Moreover this Matter touches the Nature of Truth. For although to thee in thy 
   True Self, absolute and without Conditions, all this Universe, which is relative 
   and conditioned is an Illusion; yet to that Part of Thee by which thou perceivest 
   it, the Law of its Being (or By-coming) is a Law of Truth. Learn then that all 
   Relations are true upon their own Plane, and that it would be a Violation of 
   Nature to adjust them skewwise. Thus, albeit thou hast found thy Self, and knowest 
   Thy Self immortal and immutable beyond Time and Space, free of Causality, so 
   thoroughly that even thy Mind partaketh constantly thereof, thou hast in no 
   wise altered the Relations of thy Body with its Syndromics in the World whereof 
   it is a Part. Wouldst thou lengthen the Life of thy Body? Then accommodate thou 
   the Conditions of thy Body to its Environment by giving it Light, Air, Food, 
   and Exercise as its Nature requireth. So also, mutatis mutandis, do thou cherish 
   the Health of thy Mind.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{iota }<br>
   DE RELATIONE ILLUSIONUM.</h2>
 <p>Of this will I speak further with thee, for here behold a great Rock of Ignorance 
   on the one Hand, and on the other a Whirlpool of Error; in this Strait are many 
   Wrecks of Magick Ships. Knowest thou not that Riddle of old, whether it be lawful 
   to pay Tribute to Caesar or no? Give therefore to the Body the Things of the 
   Body, and to the Mind the Things of the Mind. Yet because of the interior Harmony 
   of all Things that proceedeth from their Original One Nature, there is Action 
   and Reaction of the one upon the other, as I have already set forth in this 
   mine Epistle. But Law is universal, and between these two Kinds of Illusion 
   there is an ordered Proportion, and it is proper to thy Science to delimit and 
   describe this Law of Interaction, for to deny it wholly (as to extend it to 
   Infinity) is Folly, born of Ignorance, Idleness, and Incapacity to observe Fact.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{kappa }<br>
   DE PRUDENTIA.</h2>
 <p>Consider Drunkenness, how by Variation of bodily Conditions thou mayst alter 
   its Effect upon the Mind, and the Contrary, remembering the Discipline of Theophrastus 
   Paracelsus, how, opposing Wine to bodily Exercise, he obtained a certain Purification 
   and Exaltation/ Yet, were he seven times greater, he had not done this with 
   Oil of Vitriol. Learn then that there are certain definite Channels of Action 
   and Reaction between Body and Mind; sound these, and trim thy Sails accordingly, 
   not thinking that thou art in the open Sea. And if so be that thou in thy sounding 
   findest new Channels, rejoice and map them for the Profit of thy Fellows; But 
   remember always that to find a new Way up a Precipice removeth not the Precipice. 
   For where thou, o Angel and yet Man, hast trod delicately albeit without Fear, 
   Fools will rush in to their Destruction.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{lambda }<br>
   DE RATIONE MAGI VITAE.</h2>
 <p>Study Logic, which is the Code of the Laws of Thought. Study the Method of 
   Science, which is the Application of Logic to the Facts of the Universe. Think 
   not that thou canst ever abrogate these Laws, for though they be Limitations, 
   they are the rules of thy Game which thou dost play. For in thy Trances though 
   thou becomest That which is not subject to those Laws, they are still final 
   in respect of these Things which thou hast set them to govern. Nay, o my son, 
   I like not this Word, govern, for a Law is but a Statement of the nature of 
   the Thing to which it applieth. Nor nothing is compelled save only by Nature 
   of its own true Will. So therefore human Law is a Statement of the Will and 
   of the Nature of Man, or else it is a Falsity contrary thereunto, and becometh 
   null and of no Effect.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{mu }<br>
   DE CORDE CANDIDO.</h2>
 <p>Think also, o my Son, of this Image, that if two States be at Peace, a Man 
   goeth between them without Let; but if there be War, all Gateways are forthwith 
   closed, save only for a few, and these are watched and guarded, so that the 
   Obstacles are many. This then is the Case of Magick; for if thou have brought 
   to Harmony all Principles within thee, thou mayst work easily to transmute a 
   Force into its semblable upon another Plane, which is the essential Miracle 
   of our Art; but if thou be at War within thyself, how canst thou work? For our 
   Master Hermes Tresmegistus hat written at the Head of His Tablet of Emerald 
   this Word: That which is above is like that which is below, and that which is 
   below is like that which is above, for the Performance of the Miracle of the 
   One Substance. How then, if these be not alike? If the Substance of Thee be 
   Two, and not One? And herein is the Need of the Confession of a pure Heart, 
   as is written in the Book of the Dead.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{nu }<br>
   DE CONFORMITATE MAGI.</h2>
 <p>See to it therefore, o my Son, that thou in thy Working dost no Violence to 
   the whole Will of the All, or to the Will common to all those Beings (or By-comings) 
   that are of one general Nature with thee, or to thine own particular Will. For 
   first of all thou art necessarily moved toward the One End from thine own Station, 
   but secondly thou art moved toward the End proper to thine own Race, and Caste, 
   and Family, as by Virtue of thy Birth. And these are, I may say it, Conditions 
   or limits, of thine own individual Will. Thou dost laugh? Err not, my Son! The 
   Magus, even as the Poet is the Expression of the true Will of his Fellows, and 
   his Success is his Proof, as it is written in <em>The Book of the Law</em>. 
   For his Work is to free Men from the Fetters of a false or a superannuated Will, 
   revealing unto them, in Measure attuned to their Needs, their true Natures.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{xi }<br>
   DE POETIS.</h2>
 <p>For this Reason is the Poet called an Incarnation of the Zeitgeist, that is, 
   of the Spirit or Will of his Period. So every Poet is also a Prophet, because 
   when that which he sayeth is recognized as the Expression of their own Thought 
   by Men, they translate this into Act, so that, in the Parlance of he Folk vulgar 
   and ignorant, "that which he foretold is come to pass". Now then the 
   Poet is Interpreter of the Hieroglyphs of the Hidden Will of Man in many a matter, 
   some light, some deep, as it may be given unto him to do. Moreover, it is not 
   altogether in the Word of any Poem, but in the quintessential Flavour of the 
   Poet, that thou mayst seek this Prophecy. And this is an Art most necessary 
   to every Statesman. Who but Shelley foretold the Fall of Christianity, and the 
   Organisation of Labour, and the Freedom of Woman; who by Nietzsche declared 
   the Principle at the Root of the World-War? See thou clearly then that in these 
   Men were the Keys of the Dark Gates of the Future; Should not the Kings and 
   their Ministers have taken heed thereto, fulfilling their Word without Conflict.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{omicron }<br>
   DE MAGIS ORDINIS A{.·.} A{.·.}<br>
   QUIBUS CARO FIT VERBUM.</h2>
 <p>Now, o my Son, the Incarnation of a Poet is particular and not Universal; he 
   sayeth indeed true Things but not the Things of All-Truth. And that these may 
   be said it is necessary that One take human Flesh, and become a Magus in our 
   Holy Order. He then is called the <em>Logos</em>, or <em>Logos Aionos</em>, 
   that is to say, he Word of the Aeon or Age, because he is verily that Word. 
   And thus may be be known, because He hath it given unto Him to prepare the Quintessence 
   of the Will of God, that is, of Man, in its Fullness and Wholeness, comprehending 
   all Planes, so that his Law is simple, and radical, penetrating all Space from 
   its single Light. For though His Words be many, yet is His Word One, One and 
   Alone; and by this Word he createth Man anew, in an essential Form of Life, 
   so that he is changed in his inmost Knowledge of himself. And this Change worketh 
   outwards, little by little, unto its visible Effect.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{pi }<br>
   DE MAGIS TEMPORI ANTIQUI:<br>
   IMPRIMIS, DE LAO-TZE.</h2>
 <p>It may be unto thy Profit, o my Son, if I relate unto thee the secret History 
   of those who have gone before me in this Grade of Magus, so far as their Memory 
   hath remained among Mankind. For what would it avail thee should I recount the 
   deeds of those whom I indeed may know, but thou not? Thou knowest well how I 
   keep me from all Taint of Fable, or any Word unproven and undemonstrable. First 
   then I speak of Lao-Tze, whose word was the <strong>TAO</strong>. Hereof have 
   I already written much unto thee, because His Doctrine has been lost or misinterpreted, 
   and it is most needful to restore it. For this Tao is the true Nature of Things, 
   being itself a Way or Going, that is, a kinetic and not a static Conception. 
   Also He taught this Way of Harmony in Will, which I myself have thought to show 
   thee in this little book. So then this Tao is Truth, and the Way of Truth, and 
   therefore was He Logos of His Aeon, and His true Name or Word was Tao.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{koppa }<br>
   DE GAUTAMA.</h2>
 <p>Whom Men call Gotama, or Siddartha, or the Buddha, was a Magus of our Holy 
   Order. And His Word was <strong>ANATTA</strong>; for the Root of His whole Doctrine 
   was that there is no Atman, or Soul, as Men ill translate it, meaning a Substance 
   incapable of Change. Thus, He, like Lao-Tze, based all upon a Movement, instead 
   of a fixed Point. And His Way of Truth was Analysis, made possible by great 
   Intention of the Mind toward itself, and that well fortified by certain tempered 
   Rigour of Life. And He most thoroughly explored and Mapped out the Fastnesses 
   of the Mind, and gave the Keys of its Fortresses into the Hand of Man. But of 
   all this the Quintessence is in this one Word Anatta, because this is not only 
   the foundation and the Result of his whole Doctrine, but the Way of its Work.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{rho }<br>
   DE SRI KRISHNA ET DE DIONYSO.</h2>
 <p>Krishna has Names and Forms innumerable, and I know not His true Human Birth, 
   for His Formula is of the Major Antiquity. But His Word hath spread into many 
   Lands, and we know it to-day as <strong>INRI</strong> with the secret <strong>IAO</strong> 
   concealed therein. And the Meaning of this Word is the Working of Nature in 
   Her Changes; that is, it is the Formula of Magick whereby all Things reproduce 
   and recreate themselves. Yet this Extension and Specialisation was rather the 
   Word of Dionysus; for the true Word of Krishna was <strong>AUM</strong>, importing 
   rather a Statement of the Truth of Nature than a practical Instruction in detailed 
   Operations of Magick. But Dionysus, by the Word INRI, laid the Foundation of 
   all Science, as We say Science to-day in a particular Sense, that is, of causing 
   external Nature to change in Harmony with our Wills.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{sigma }<br>
   DE TAHUTI.</h2>
 <p>Tahuti, or Thot, confirmed the Word of Dionysus by continuing it; for he showed 
   how by the Mind it was possible to direct the Operations of the Will. By Criticism 
   and by recorded Memory Man avoideth Error. But the true Word of Tahuti was <strong>AMOUN</strong>, 
   whereby He made Men to understand their secret Nature, that is, their Unity 
   with their true Selves, or, as they then phrased it, with God. And He discovered 
   unto them the Way of this Attainment, and its Relation with the Formula of INRI. 
   Also by His Mystery of Number He made plain the Path for His Successor to declare 
   the Nature of the whole Universe in its Form and in its Structure, as it were 
   an Analysis thereof, doing for Matter what the Buddha was decreed to do for 
   Mind.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{tau }<br>
   DE QUODAM MAGO AEGYPTIORUM, QUEM APPELUNT JUDAEI MOSHEH.</h2>
 <p>The Follower of Tahuti was an Egyptian whose Name is lost; but the Jews called 
   Him Mosheh, or Moses, and their Fabulists made Him the Leader of their Legendary 
   Exodus. Yet they preserved His Word, and it is <strong>IHVH</strong>, which 
   thou must understand also as that Secret Word which thou hast seen and heard 
   in Thunders and Lightnings in thine Initiation to the Degree thou wottest of. 
   But this Word is itself a Plan of the Fabrick of the Universe, and upon it hath 
   been elaborated the Holy Qabalah, whereby we have Knowledge of the Nature of 
   all Things soever upon every Plane of By-coming, and of their Forces and Tendencies 
   and Operations, with the Keys to their Portals. Nor did He leave any Part of 
   His Work unfinished, unless it be that accomplished three hundred Years ago 
   by Sir Edward Kelly, of whom I also come, as thou knowest.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{upsilon }<br>
   DE MAGO ARABICO MOHAMMED.</h2>
 <p>Behold! In these Chapters have I, thy Father, restricted myself, not speaking 
   of any immediate Echo of a Word in the World, because, there Men being long 
   since withdrawn into their Silence, it is their One Word, and that Alone, that 
   resoundeth undiminished through Time. How Mohammed, who followeth, is darkened 
   and confused by His Nearness to our own Time, so that I say not save with Diffidence 
   that His Word <strong>ALLH</strong> may mean this or that. But I am bold concerning 
   His Doctrine of the Unity of God, for God is Man, and he said therefore: Man 
   is One. And His Will was to unite all Men in One reasonable Faith: to make possible 
   international Co- operation in Science. Yet, because He arose in the Time of 
   the greatest possible Corruption and Darkness, when every Civilisation and Every 
   Religion had fallen into Ruin, by the malice of the great Sorcerer of Nazareth, 
   as some say, He is still hidden in the Dust of the Simoom, and we may not perceive 
   Him in His true Self of Glory.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, behold, o My Son, this Mystery. His true Word was <strong>LA 
   ALLH</strong>, that is to say: (there is) No God, and LA AL is that Mystery 
   of Mysteries which thine own Eye pierced in thine Initiation. And of that Truth 
   have the Illusion and Falsehood enslaved the Souls of Men, as is written in 
   the Book of the Magus.</p>

 <p>O my son! me seemeth in certain Hours that I am myself fallen on a Time even

   the Word of the Aeon, that is <strong>ABRAHADABRA</strong>, wherein is the whole 
   Mystery of the great Work, as thou knowest. And I have <em>The Book of the Law</em>, 
   that was given unto me by Him thou wottest of; and it is the Interpretation 
   of the Secret Will of Man on every Plane of his By-coming; and the Word of the 
   Law is <strong>THELEMA</strong>. 'Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the 
   Law." Now because "Love is the law, love under will." do I write 
   this Epistle for thee, that thou mayst fulfil this inmost Will of Mankind, making 
   them capable of Light, Live, Love and Liberty by the Acceptance of this Law. 
   And the Hindrance thereunto is but as the Shell of its Egg to an Eaglet, a Thing

   MANDATUM AD FILIUM SUUM.</h2>
 <p>Here I reach forth mine Hands against thee in the Sign of the Enterer, o son 
   of my Bowels, for with all my Magical Might I will that thou fight manfully 
   and labour with Diligence (with Sword and Trowel; say I) in this Work. For this 
   is the first and last of all, that thou bid every Man do What he will, in accord 
   with his own true Nature. Therefore also blast thou that Lie that Man is of 
   a fallen and evil Nature. For the Word of Sin is Restriction, the Doubt of his 
   own Godhead, the Suppression of, which is the Blasphemy against, his own Holy 
   Spirit. Saith not "The Book of the Law" that "...It is a lie, 
   this folly against self. ..."? Therefore to every Man, in every Circumstance, 
   say thou: Do what thou wilt; and teach him, if he yet waver, how to discover 
   his true Nature, earnestly and with Ardour, even as I have striven to each thee 
   --- yea, and more also!</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{psi }<br>
   QUARE FILIUM CREAVIT: UT FIAT LIBERTAS.</h2>
 <p>Do what thou wilt! be this our Slogan of Battle in every Act; for every Act 
   is Conflict. There Victory leapeth shining before us; for who may thwart true 
   Will, which is the Order of Nature Herself? "...thou hast no right but 
   to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay." For if that Will 
   be true, its Fulfilment is of a Surety as Daylight following Sunrise. It is 
   as certain as the Operation of any other Law of Nature; it is Destiny. Then, 
   if that Will be obscured, if thou turn from it to Wills diseased or perverse, 
   how canst thou hope? Fool! Even thy Turns and Twists are in the Path to thine 
   appointed End. But thou art not sprung of a Slave's Loins; thou standest firm 
   and straight; thou dost thy Will; and thou are Chosen, nay, for this Work wast 
   thou begotten in a Magick Bed, that thou shouldst make Man free.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Beta }{omega }<br>
   DE SUA DEBILITATE.</h2>
 <p>Listen attentively, my Son, while I with heavy Heart make Confession to thee 
   of mine own Frailty. Thou knowest that I made Renunciation of my Wage, taking 
   this Body immediately after my Death, the Death of Eliphas Levi Zahed, as Men 
   say, that I might attain to this great Work. It is now twenty Years, as Men 
   count years, that I came to my first Understanding of my true Nature, and aspired 
   to that Work. Now then at first I made no Error. I abandoned my chosen Career; 
   I poured out my whole Fortune without one Thought; I gave my Life utterly to 
   the Work, without keeping back the least imaginable Thing. So then I made swift 
   Strides along the Path. But in the Dhyanas that were granted unto me in Kandy, 
   in the Island of Lanka, I used up my whole Charge of Magical Energy; and for
