 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 9th Aethyr,<br>
   Which is Called ZIP</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a><font size="6"> </font></p>
 <p>(The terrible Curse that is the Call of the Thirty Aethyrs sounds like a song 
   of ecstasy and triumph; every phrase in it has a secret meaning of blessing.) 
 </p>
 <p>The Shew-stone is of soft lucent white, on which the Rose-Cross shows a brilliant 
   yet colourless well of light. </p>
 <p>And now the veil of the stone is rent with as clap of thunder, and I am walking 
   upon a razor-edge of light suspended over the Abyss, and before me and above 
   me are ranged the terrible armies of the Most High, like unto those in the 11th 
   Aethyr, but there is one that cometh forth to meet me upon the ridge, holding 
   out his arms to me and saying: </p>
 <p>(v. I.) Who is this that cometh forth from the Abyss from the place of rent 
   garments, the habitation of him that is only a name? Who is this that walketh 
   upon a ray of the bright, evening star? </p>
 <p><em>Refrain</em>. Glory unto him that is concealed, and glory unto her that 
   beareth the cup, and glory unto the one that is the child and the father of 
   their love. Glory unto the star, and glory unto the snake, and glory unto the 
   swordsman of the sun. And worship and blessing throughout the Aeon unto the 
   name of the Beast, four-square, mystic, wonderful! </p>
 <p>(v. II.) Who is this that travelleth between the hosts, that is poised upon 
   the edge of the Aethyr by the wings of Maut? Who is this that seeketh the House 
   of the Virgin? <em>Refrain</em> </p>
 <p>(v. III.) This is he that hath given up his name. This is he whose blood hath 
   been gathered into the cup of BABALON<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>.This 
   is he that sitteth, a little pile of dry dust, in the city of the Pyramids. 
   <em>Refrain</em> </p>
 <p>(v. IV.) Until the light of the Father of all kindle that death. </p>
 <p>Until the breath touch that dry dust. Until the Ibis be revealed unto the Crab, 
   and the sixfold Star become the radiant Triangle<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. 
   <em>Refrain</em> </p>
 <p>(v. V.) Blessed is not I, not thou, not he, Blessed without name or number 
   who hath taken the azure of night, and crystallized it into a pure sapphire-stone, 
   who hath taken the gold of the sun, and beaten it into an infinite ring, and 
   hath set the sapphire therein, and put it upon his finger. <em>Refrain</em> 
 </p>
 <p>(v. VI.) Open wide your gates, O City of God, for I bring No-one with me. Sink 
   your swords and your spears in salutation, for the Mother and the Babe are my 
   companions. Let the banquet be prepared in the palace of the King's daughter. 
   Let the lights be kindled; Are not we the children of the light? <em>Refrain</em> 
 </p>
 <p>(v. VII.) For this is the key-stone of the palace of the King's daughter. This 
   is the Stone of the Philosophers. This is the Stone that is hidden in the walls 
   of the ramparts. Peace, Peace, Peace unto Him that is throned therein! <em>Refrain</em> 
 </p>
 <p>Now then we are passed within the lines of the army, and we are come unto a 
   palace of which every stone is a separate jewel, and is set with millions of 
   moons. </p>
 <p>And this palace is nothing but the body of a woman, proud and delicate, and 
   beyond imagination fair. She is like a child of twelve years old. She has very 
   deep eye-lids, and long lashes. Her eyes are closed, or nearly closed. It is 
   impossible to say anything about her. She is naked; her whole body is covered 
   with fine gold hairs, that are the electric flames that are the spears of mighty 
   and terrible Angels who breast-plates are the scales of her skin. And the hair 
   of her head, that flows down to her feet, is the very light of God himself. 
   Of all the glories beheld by the seer in the Aethyrs, there is not one which 
   is worthy to be compared with her littlest finger-nail. For although he may 
   not partake of the Aethyr, without the ceremonial preparations, even the beholding 
   of this Aethyr from afar is like the partaking of all the former Aethyrs. </p>
 <p>The Seer is lost in wonder, which is peace. </p>
 <p>And the ring of the horizon above her is a company of glorious Archangels with 
   joined hands, that stand and sing: This is the daughter of BABALON the Beautiful, 
   that she hath borne unto the Father of All. And unto all hath she borne her. 
 </p>
 <p>This is the Daughter of the King. This is the Virgin of Eternity. This is she 
   that the Holy One hath wrested from the Giant Time, and the prize of them that 
   have overcome Space. This is she that is set upon the Throne of Understanding. 
   Holy, Holy, Holy is her name, not to be spoken among men. For Kor they have 
   called her, and Malkuth, and Betulah, and Persephone. </p>
 <p>And the poets have feigned songs about her, and the prophets have spoken vain 
   things, and the young men have dreamed vain dreams; but this is she, that immaculate, 
   the name of whose name may not be spoken. Thought cannot pierce the glory that 
   defendeth her, for thought is smitten dead before her presence. Memory is blank, 
   and in the most ancient books of Magick are neither words to conjure her, nor 
   adorations to praise her. Will bends like a reed in the temptests that sweep 
   the borders of her kingdom, and imagination cannot figure so much as one petal 
   of the lilies whereon she standeth in the lake of crystal, in the sea of glass. 
 </p>
 <p>This is she that hath bedecked her hair with seven stars, the seven breaths 
   of God that move and thrill its excellence. And she hath tired her hair with 
   seven combs, whereupon are written the seven secret names of God that are not 
   known even of the Angels, or of the Archangels, or of the Leader of the armies 
   of the Lord. </p>
 <p>Holy, Holy, Holy art thou, and blessed be Thy name for ever, unto whom the 
   Aeons are but the pulsings of thy blood. </p>
 <p>I am blind and deaf. My sight and hearing are exhausted. </p>
 <p>I know only by the sense of touch. And there is a trembling from within me. 
 </p>
 <p>Images keep arising like clouds, or veils, exquisite Chinese ivories, and porcelains, 
   and many other things of great and delicate beauty; for such things are informed 
   by Her spirit, for they are cast off from her into the world of the Qliphoth, 
   or shells of the dead, that is earth. For every world is the shell or excrement 
   of the world above it. </p>
 <p>I cannot bear the Vision. </p>
 <p>A voice comes, I know not whence: Blessed art thou, who hast seen, and yet 
   hast not believed. For therefore is it given unto thee to taste, and smell, 
   and feel, and hear, and know by the inner sense, and by the inmost sense, so 
   that sevenfold is thy rapture. </p>
 <p>(My brain is so exhausted that fatigue-images appear, by pure physical reflex 
   action; they are not astral things at all. </p>
 <p>And now I have conquered the fatigue by will. And by placing the shew- stone 
   upon my forehead, it sends cool electric thrills through my brain, so as to 
   refresh it, and make it capable of more rapture. </p>
 <p>And now again I behold Her.) </p>
 <p>And the Angel cometh forth, and behind him whirls a black swastika, made of 
   fine filaments of light that has been "interfered" with, and he taketh 
   me aside into a little chamber in one of the nine towers. This chamber is furnished 
   with maps of many mystical cities. There is a table, and a strange lamp, that 
   gives light by jetting four columns of vortex rings of luminous smoke<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>. And he points 
   to the map of the Aethyrs, that are arranged as a flaming Sword, so that the 
   thirty Aethyrs go into the ten Sephiroth<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. 
   And the first nine are infinitely holy. And he says, It is written in <em>The 
   Book of the Law</em>, "If thou drink, drink by the eight and ninety rules 
   of art:" And this shall signify unto thee that thou must undergo great 
   discipline; else the Vision were lost or perverted. For these mysteries pertain 
   not unto thy grade. Therefore must thou invoke the Highest before thou unveil 
   the shrines thereof. </p>
 <p>And this shall be thy rule: A thousand and one times shalt thou affirm the 
   unity<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>, and bow thyself 
   a thousand and one times. And thou shalt recite thrice the call of the Aethyr. 
   And all day and all night, awake or asleep, shall thy heart be turned as a lotus-flower 
   unto the light. And thy body shall be the temple of the Rosy Cross. Thus shall 
   thy mind be open unto the higher; and then shalt thou be able to conquer the 
   exhaustion, and it may be find the words -- for who shall look upon His face 
   and live? </p>
 <p>Yea, thou tremblest, but from within; because of the holy spirit that is descended 
   into thy heart, and shaketh thee as an aspen in the wind. </p>
 <p>They also tremble that are without, and they are shaken from without by the 
   earthquakes of his judgement. They have set their affections upon the earth, 
   and they have stamped with their feet upon the earth, and cried: It moveth not. 
 </p>
 <p>Therefore hath earth opened with strong motion, like the sea, and swallowed 
   them. Yea, she hath opened her womb to them that lusted after her, and she hath 
   closed herself upon them. There lie they in torment, until by her quaking the 
   earth is shattered like brittle glass, and dissolved like salt in the waters 
   of his mercy, so that they are cast upon the air to be blown about therein, 
   like seeds that shall take root in the earth; yet turn they their affections 
   upward to the sun.</p>
 <p>But thou, be thou eager and vigilant, performing punctually the rule. Is it 
   not written, "Change not so much as the style of a letter"? </p>
 <p>Depart therefore, for the Vision of the Voice of the ninth Aethyr that is called 
   ZIP is passed. </p>
 <p>Then I threw back myself into my body by my will </p>
 <p>Bou-Sada.<br>

     = 78, the influence from the Most High. It is the Virgin Artemis in the midst 
     of the House of the Sun, in his Northern and Southern declinations both. For 
     her girdle is the Girdle of the World. She is the Woman clothed with the Sun 
     in Atu XIV.</font></li>
   <li><a name="2"></a><font size="2">BABALON = 156 = 12 x 13, which is the formula 
     of the four watchtowers of the universe. These watchtowers are composed of 
     truncated pyramids, each one concealing a sphinx. They contain the symbols 
     of the energies of the four elements. We may thus say that as each watchtower 
     contains 12 x 13 pyramids, Babalon is indicated as Shakti. For the elements 
     are the manifested powers of the All-Father. Again we may consider the watchtowers 
     as the "City of the Pyramids" though in a sense less exalted than 
     that usually implied in these visions.</font></li>

     Between each recitation, the Seer halted and bowed. This practice was performed 
     during the day's march, the 1001 recitals being divived into 13 sections (a 
     further affirmation of the unity, for 13 = AChD = 1) with short rests. </font></li>
