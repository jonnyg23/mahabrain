       <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 15th Aethyr,<br>
         Which is Called OXO</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
       <p>There appears immediately in the Aethyr a tremendous column of scarlet 
         fire, whirling forth, rebounding, crying aloud. And about it are four 
         columns of green and blue and gold and silver, each inscribed with writings 
         in the character of the dagger. And the column of fire is dancing among 
         the pillars. Now it seems that the fire is but the skirt of the dancer, 
         and the dancer is a mighty god. The vision is overpowering. </p>
       <p>As the dancer whirls, she chants in a strange, slow voice, quickening 
         as she goes: Lo! I gather up every spirit that is pure, and weave him 
         into my vesture of flame. I lick up the lives of men, and their souls 
         sparkle from mine eyes. I am the mighty sorceress, the lust of the spirit. 
         And by my dancing I gather for my mother Nuit the heads of all them that 
         are baptized in the waters of life. I am the lust of the spirit that eateth 
         up the soul of man. I have prepared a feast for the adepts, and they that 
         partake thereof shall see God<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. </p>
       <p>Now it is clear what she has woven in her dance; it is the Crimson Rose 
         of 49 Petals, and the Pillars are the Cross with which it is conjoined. 
         And between the pillars shoot out rays of pure green fire; and now all 
         the pillars are golden. She ceases to dance, and dwindles, gathering herself 
         into the centre of the Rose. Now it is seen that the Rose is a vast ampitheatre, 
         with seven tiers, each tier divided into seven partitions. And they that 
         sit in the Amphitheatre are the seven grades of the Order of the Rosy 
         Cross. This Amphitheatre is built of rose-coloured marble, and of its 
         size I can say only that the sun might be used as a ball to be thrown 
         by the players in the arena. But in the arena there is a little altar 
         of emerald<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>, and 
         its top has the heads of the Four Beasts, in turquoise and rock-crystal<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>. 
         And the floor of the arena is ridged like a grating of lapis lazuli<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. 
         And it is full of pure quicksilver<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. </p>
       <p>Above the altar is a veiled Figure, whose name is Pan. Those in the outer 
         tier adore him as a Man; and in the next tier they adore him as a Goat; 
         and in the next tier they adore him as a Ram; and in the next tier they 
         adore him as a Crab; and in the next tier they adore him as an Ibis; and 
         in the next tier they adore him as a Golden Hawk; and in the next tier 
         they adore him not<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. </p>
       <p>And now the light streameth out from the altar, splashed out by the feet 
         of him that is above it. It is the Holy Twelve-fold Table of OIT<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. </p>
       <p>The voice of him that is above the altar is silence, but the echo thereof 
         cometh back from the walls of the circus, and is speech. And this is the 
         speech: Three and four are the days of a quarter of the moon, and on the 
         seventh day is the sabbath, but thrice four is the Sabbath of the Adepts 
         whereof the form is revealed in the Aethyr ZID; that is the eighth of 
         the Aires<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. And the mysteries of the Table 
         shall not be wholly revealed, nor shall they be revealed herein. But thou 
         shalt gather of the sweat of thy brow a pool of clear water wherein this 
         shall be revealed. And of the oil that thou burnest in the midnight shall 
         be gathered together thirteen rivers of blessing; and of the oil and the 
         water I will prepare a wine to intoxicate the young men and the maidens<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. </p>
       <p>And now the Table is become the universe; every star is a letter of the 
         Book of Enoch. And the Book of Enoch is drawn therefrom by an inscrutable 
         Mystery, that is known only to the Angels and the Holy Sevenfold Table<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. While I have 
         been gazing upon this table, an Adept has come forth, one from each tier, 
         except the inmost Tier. </p>
       <p>And the first<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a> 
         drove a dagger into my heart, and tasted the blood, and said: {GRK:chi}{GRK:alpha}{GRK:theta}{GRK:alpha}{GRK:rho} 
         {GRK:omicron}{GRK:sigma} , {GRK:chi}{GRK:alpha}{GRK:theta}{GRK:alpha} 
         {GRK:rho}{GRK:omicron}{GRK:sigma} , {GRK:chi}{GRK:alpha}{GRK:theta} {GRK:alpha} 
         {GRK:rho}{GRK:omicron}{GRK:sigma} , {GRK:chi}{GRK:alpha} {GRK:theta} {GRK:alpha}{GRK:rho}{GRK:omicron} 
         {GRK:sigma} , {GRK:chi} {GRK:alpha}{GRK:theta}{GRK:alpha}{GRK:rho}{GRK:omicron} 
         {GRK:sigma} , {GRK:chi}{GRK:alpha}{GRK:theta}{GRK:alpha}{GRK:rho}{GRK:omicron} 
         {GRK:sigma}<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. 
       </p>
       <p>And the second<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a> 
         Adept has been testing the muscles of my right arm and shoulder, and he 
         says: fortis, fortis, fortis, fortis, fortis <a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. 
       </p>
       <p>And the third<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a> 
         Adept examines the skin and tastes the sweat of my left arm, and says: 
         TAN, TAN, TAN, TAN.<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a> And the fourth<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a> Adept examines 
         my neck, and seems to approve, though he says nothing<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>; 
         and he hath opened the right half of my brain, and he makes some examination, 
         and says: "Samajh, samajh, samajh.<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>" 
       </p>
       <p>And the fifth Adept examines the left half of my brain, and then holds 
         up his hand in protest, and says "PLA . . .<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>" 
         (I cannot get the sentence, but the meaning is: In the thick darkness 
         the seed awaiteth spring.) </p>
       <p>And now am I again rapt in contemplation of that universe of letters 
         which are stars. </p>
       <p>The words ORLO, ILRO, TULE are three most secret names of God. They are 
         Magick names, each having an interpretation of the same kind as the interpretation 
         of I.N.R.I., and the name OIT, RLU, LRL, OOE are other names of God, that 
         contain magical formulae, the first to invoke fire; the second, water; 
         the third, air; and the fourth, earth<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>. 
       </p>
       <p>And if the Table be read diagonally, every letter, and every combination 
         of letters, is the name of a devil. And from these are drawn the formulae 
         of evil magick<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>. But the holy 
         letter I above the triad LLL dominateth the Table, and preserveth the 
         peace of the universe<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>. </p>
       <p>And in the seven talismans about the central Table are contained the 
         Mysteries of drawing forth the letters. And the letters of the circumference 
         declare in glory of Nuit, that beginneth from Aries<a href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. </p>
       <p>All this while the Adepts must have been chanting as it were an oratorio 
         for seven instruments. And this oratorio hath one dominant theme of rapture. 
         Yet it applieth to every detail of the universe as well as to the whole. 
         And herein is Choronzon brought utterly to ruin, that all his work is 
         against his will, not only in the whole, but in every part thereof, even 
         as a fly that walketh upon a beryl-stone. </p>
       <p>And the tablet blazeth ever brighter till it filleth the whole Aire. 
         And behold! there is is one God therein, and the letters of the stars 
         in his crown, Orion, and the Pleiades, and Aldebaran, and Alpha Centauri, 
         and Cor Leonis, and Cor Scorpionis, and Spica, and the pole-star, and 
         Hercules, and Regulus, and Aquila, and the Ram's Eye. </p>
       <p>And upon a map of the stars shalt thou draw the sigil of that name; and 
         because also some of the letters are alike, thou shalt know that the stars 
         also have tribes and nations<a href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>. 
         The letter of a star is but the totem thereof. And the letter representeth 
         not the whole nature of the star, but each star must be known by itself 
         in the wisdom of him that hath the Cynocephalus in leash<a href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>. </p>
       <p>And this pertaineth unto the grade of a Magus --- and that is beyond 
         thine. (All this is communicated not by voice, or by writing; and there 
         is no form in the stone, but only the brilliance of the Table. And now 
         I am withdrawn from all that, but the Rosy Cross of 49 petals is set upright 
         upon the summit of a pyramid, and all is dark, because of the exceeding 
         light behind.) </p>
       <p>And there cometh a voice: The fly cried unto the ox, "Beware! Strengthen 
         thyself. Set thy feet firmly upon the earth, for it is my purpose to alight 
         between thy shoulders, and I would not harm thee." So also are they 
         who wish well unto the Masters of the Pyramid. </p>
       <p>And the bee said unto the flower: "Give me of thine honey," 
         and the flower gave richly thereof; but the bee, though he wit it not, 
         carried the seed of the flower into many fields of sun. So also are they 
         that take unto themselves the Masters of the Pyramid for servants. </p>
       <p>Now the exceeding light that was behind the Pyramid, and the Rosy Cross 
         that is set thereon, hath fulfilled the whole Aire. The black Pyramid 
         is like the back of a black diamond. Also the Rosy Cross is loosened, 
         and the petals of the Rose are the mingled hues of sunset and of dawn; 
         and the Cross is the Golden light of noon, and in the heart of the Rose 
         there is the secret light that men call midnight. </p>
       <p>And a voice: "Glory to God and thanksgiving to God, and there is 
         no God but God. And He is exalted; He is great; and in the Sevenfold Table 
         is His Name writ openly, and in the Twelvefold Table is His Name concealed." 
       </p>
       <p>And the Pyramid casts a shadow of itself into the sky, and the shadow 
         spreads over the whole stone. And an angel clad in blue and scarlet, with 
         golden wings and plumes of purple fire, comes forth and scatters disks 
         of green and gold, filing all the Aire. And they become swiftly-whirling 
         wheels, singing together. </p>
       <p>And the voice of the angel cries: Gather up thy garments about thee<a href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>, 
         O thou that hast entered the circle of the Sabbath; for in thy grave-clothes 
         shouldest thou behold the resurrection. </p>
       <p>The flesh hangeth upon thee like his rags upon a beggar that is a pilgrim 
         to the shrine of the Exalted One. Nevertheless, bear them bravely, and 
         rejoice in the beauty thereof, for the company of the pilgrims is a glad 
         company, and they have no care, and with song and dance and wine and fair 
         women do they make merry. And every hostel is their place, and every maid 
         their queen. </p>
       <p>Gather up thy garments about thee, I say, for the voice of the Aethyr, 
         that is the voice of the Aeon, is ended, and thou art absorbed into the 
         lesser night, and caught in the web of the light of thy mother in the 
         word ARBADAHARBA<a href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a>. 
       </p>
       <p>And now the five and the six are divorced<a href="#30"><font size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>, and I am come again within my 
         body. </p>
