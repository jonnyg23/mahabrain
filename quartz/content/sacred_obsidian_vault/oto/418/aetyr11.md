 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 11th Aethyr,<br>
   Which is Called IKH</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a><font size="6"> </font></p>
 <p>There appears in the stone immediately the Kamea<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a> of the Moon. And 
   it is rolled up; and behind it there appeareth a great Host of Angels. Their 
   backs are turned towards me, but I can see how tremendous are their arms, which 
   are swords and spears. They have wings upon their helmets and their heels: they 
   are clad in complete armour, and the least of their swords is like the breaking 
   forth of a tremendous storm of lightning. The least of their spears is like 
   a great water-spout. On their shields are the eyes of Tetragrammaton, winged 
   with flame, --- white, red, black, yellow and blue. On their flanks are vast 
   squadrons of elephants, and behind them is their meteor-artillery. They that 
   sit upon the elephants are armed with the thunderbolt of Zeus. </p>
 <p>Now in all that host there is no motion. Yet they are not resting upon their 
   arms, but tense and vigilant. And between them and me is the God Shu, whom before 
   I did not see, because his force filleth the whole Aethyr<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. And indeed he 
   is not visible in his form. Nor does he come to the seer through any of the 
   senses; he is understood, rather than expressed. </p>
 <p>I perceive that all this army is defended by fortresses, nine mighty towers<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a> 
   of iron upon the frontier of the Aethyr. Each tower is filled with warriors 
   in silver armour<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. It is impossible to describe the 
   feeling of tension; they are like oarsmen waiting for the gun. </p>
 <p>I perceive that an Angel is standing on either side of me; nay, I am in the 
   midst of a company of armed angels, and their captain is standing in front of 
   me. He too is clad in silver armour; and about him, closely wrapped to his body, 
   is a whirling wind<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>, 
   so swift that any blow struck against him would be broken. </p>
 <p>And he speaketh unto me these words: </p>
 <p>Behold, a mighty guard against the terror of things, the fastness of the Most 
   High, the legions of eternal vigilance; these are they that keep watch and ward 
   day and night throughout the aeons. Set in them is all force of the Mighty One, 
   yet there stirreth not one plume of the wings of their helmets. </p>
 <p>Behold, the foundation of the Holy City, the towers and the bastions thereof! 
   Behold the armies of light that are set against the outermost Abyss, against 
   the horror of emptiness, and the malice of Choronzon. Behold how worshipful 
   is the wisdom of the Master, that he hath set his stability in the all-wandering 
   Air and in the changeful Moon<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. 
   In the purple flashes of lightning hath He written the word Eternity, and in 
   the wings of the swallow hath He appointed rest. </p>
 <p>By three and by three and by three hath He made firm the foundation against 
   the earthquake that is three. For in the number nine is the changefulness of 
   the numbers brought to naught. For with whatsoever number thou wilt cover it, 
   it appeareth unchanged<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>These things are spoken unto him that understandeth, that is a breastplate 
   unto the elephants, or a corselet unto the angels, or a scale upon the towers 
   of iron; yet is this mighty host set only for a defense, and whoso passeth beyond 
   their lines hath no help in them. </p>
 <p>Yet must he that understandeth go forth unto the outermost Abyss, and there 
   must he speak with him that is set above the four-fold terror, the Princes of 
   Evil, even with Choronzon, the mighty devil that inhabiteth the outermost Abyss. 
   And none may speak with him, or understand him, but the servants of Babylon, 
   that understand, and they that are without understanding, his servants. </p>
 <p>Behold! it entereth not into the heart, nor into the mind of man to conceive 
   this matter; for the sickness of the body is death, and the sickness of the 
   heart is despair, and the sickness of the mind is madness. But in the outermost 
   Abyss is sickness of the aspiration, and sickness of the will, and sickness 
   of the essence of all, and there is neither word nor thought wherein the image 
   of its image is reflected. </p>
 <p>And whoso passeth into the outermost Abyss, except he be of them that understand, 
   holdeth out his hands, and boweth his neck, unto the chains of Choronzon. And 
   as a devil he walketh about the earth, immortal, and be blasteth the flowers 
   of the earth, and he corrupteth the fresh air, and he maketh poisonous the water; 
   and the fire that is the friend of man, and the pledge of his aspiration, seeing 
   that it mounteth ever upward as a pyramid, and seeing that man stole it in a 
   hollow tube from Heaven, even that fire he turneth unto ruin, and madness, and 
   fever, and destruction. And thou, that art an heap of dry dust in the city of 
   the pyramids, must understand these things. </p>
 <p>And now a thing happens, which is unfortunately sheer nonsense; for the Aethyr 
   that is the foundation of the universe was attacked by the Outermost Abyss, 
   and the only way that I can express it is by saying that the universe was shaken. 
   But the universe was <em>not</em> shaken. And that is the exact truth; so that 
   the rational mind which is interpreting these spiritual things is offended; 
   but, being trained to obey, it setteth down that which it doth not understand. 
   For the rational mind indeed reasoneth, but never attaineth unto Understanding; 
   but the Seer is of them that understand. </p>
 <p>And the Angel saith: </p>
 <p>Behold, He hath established His mercy and His might, and unto His might is 
   added victory, and unto his Mercy is added splendour<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. 
   And all these things hath He ordered in beauty, and He hath set them firmly 
   upon the Eternal Rock, and therefrom He hath suspended His kingdom as one pearl<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a> that is set in a jewel of threescore 
   pearls and twelve<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. And He hath garnished it with 
   the Four Holy Living Creatures for Guardians, and He hath graven therein the 
   seal of righteousness<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>, 
   and He hath burnished it with the fire of His Angel, and the blush of His loveliness 
   informeth it, and with delight and with wit hath He made it merry at the heart, 
   and the core thereof is the Secret of His being, and therein is His name Generation. 
   And this His stability had the number 80, for that the price thereof is War<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>Beware, therefore, O thou who art appointed to understand the secret of the 
   Outermost Abyss, for in every Abyss thou must assume the mask and form of the 
   Angel thereof. Hadst thou a name, thou wert irrevocably lost. Search, therefore, 
   if there be yet one drop of blood that is not gathered into the cup of Babylon 
   the Beautiful, for in that little pile of dust, if there could be one drop of 
   blood, it should be utterly corrupt; it should breed scorpions and vipers, and 
   the cat of slime<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>.</p>
 <p>And I said unto the Angel: </p>
 <p>Is there not one appointed as a warden? </p>
 <p>And he said: </p>
 <p>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani. </p>
 <p>Such an ecstasy of anguish racks me that I cannot give it voice, yet I know 
   it is but as the anguish of Gethsemane. And that is the last word of the Aethyr. 
   The outposts are passed, and before the seer extends the outermost Abyss. </p>
 <p>I am returned. </p>
 <p>Bou-Sada.<br>
