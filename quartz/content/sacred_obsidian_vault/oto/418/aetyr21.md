 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 21st Aethyr,<br>
   Which is Called ASP</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
 <p>A mighty wind rolls through all the Aethyr; there is a sense of absolute emptiness; 
   no colour, no form, no substance. Only now and then there seem as it were, the 
   shadows of great angels, swept along. No sound; there is something very remorseless 
   about the wind, passionless, that is very terrible. In a way, it is nerve-shaking. 
   It seems as if something kept on trying to open behind the wind, and just as 
   it is about to open, the effort is exhausted. The wind is not cold or hot; there 
   is no sense of any kind connected with it. One does not even feel it, for one 
   is standing in front of it. </p>
 <p>Now, the thing opens behind, just for a second, and I catch a glimpse of an 
   avenue of pillars, and at the end a throne, supported by sphinxes. All this 
   is black marble<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>Now I seem to have gone through the wind, and to be standing before the throne; 
   but he that sitteth thereon is invisible. Yet it is from him that all this desolation 
   proceeds<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>He is trying to make me understand by putting tastes in my mouth, very rapidly 
   one after the other. Salt, honey, sugar<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>, 
   assafoetida, bitumen, honey again, some taste that I don't know at all; garlic, 
   something very bitter like nux vomica, another taste, still more bitter; lemon, 
   cloves, rose-leaves, honey again; the juice of some plant, like a dandelion, 
   I think; honey again, salt, a taste something like phosphorus, honey, laurel, 
   a very unpleasant taste which I don't know, coffee, then a burning taste, then 
   a sour taste that I don't know. All these tastes issue from his eyes; he <em>signals</em> 
   them. </p>
 <p>I can see his eyes now. They are very round, with perfectly black pupils, perfectly 
   white iris, and the cornea pale blue. The sense of desolation is so acute that 
   I keep on trying to get away from the vision<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>I told him that I could not understand his taste-language, so instead he set 
   up a humming very much like a big electric plant with dynamos going. </p>
 <p>Now the atmosphere is deep night-blue; and by the power of that atmosphere, 
   the pillars kindle to a dull glowing crimson, and the throne is a dull, ruddy 
   gold<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. And now, through 
   the humming, come very clear, bell-like notes, and farther still a muttering, 
   like that of a gathering storm. </p>
 <p>And now I hear the meaning of the muttering: I am he who was before the beginning, 
   and in my desolation I cried aloud, saying, let me behold my countenance in 
   the concave of the abyss<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. 
   And I beheld, and lo! in the darkness of the abyss my countenance was black, 
   and empty, and distorted<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>, that was (once) 
   invisible and pure. </p>
 <p>Then I closed mine eye, that I might not behold it, and for this was it fixed. 
   Now it is written that one glance of mine eye shall destroy it<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. And mine eye I dare not open, 
   because of the foulness of the vision. Therefore do I gaze with these two eyes 
   throughout the aeon<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. 
   Is there not one of all my adepts that shall come unto me, and cut off mine 
   eyelids, that I may behold and destroy<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>? 
 </p>
 <p>Now I take a dagger, and, searching out his third eye, seek to cut off the 
   eye-lids, but they are of adamant. And the edge of the dagger<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a> 
   is turned. </p>
 <p>And tears<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a> drop from 
   his eyes, and there is a mournful voice: So it hath been ever: so must it ever 
   be! Though thou hast the strength of five bulls, thou shalt not avail in this<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>And I said to him: Who shall avail? And he answered me: I know not<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. 
   But the dagger of penance<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a><strong> 
   </strong>thou shalt temper seven times, afflicting the seven courses of thy 
   soul. And thou shalt sharpen its edge seven times by the seven ordeals. </p>
 <p>(One keeps on looking round to try to find something else because of the terror 
   of it. But nothing changes<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a> at all. Nothing 
   but the empty throne, and the eyes, and the avenue of pillars!) </p>
 <p>And I said to him: O thou that art the first countenance before time<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>; 
   thou of whom it is written that "He, God, is one; He is the eternal one, 
   without equal, son or companion. Nothing shall stand before His face<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>"; all we have heard of thine 
   infinite glory and holiness, of thy beauty and majesty, and behold! there is 
   nothing but this abomination of desolation. </p>
 <p>He speaks; I cannot hear a word; something about <em>The Book of the Law</em>. 
   The answer is written in <em>The Book of the Law</em>, or something of that 
   sort<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>This is a long speech; all that I can hear is: From me pour down the fires 
   of life and increase continually upon the earth. From me flow down the rivers 
   of water and oil and wine. From me cometh forth the wind that beareth the seed 
   of trees and flowers and fruits and all herbs upon its bosom. From me cometh 
   forth the earth in her unspeakable variety. Yea! all cometh from me, naught 
   cometh to me. Therefore am I lonely and horrible upon this unprofitable throne. 
   Only those who accept nothing from me can bring anything to me. </p>
 <p>(He goes on speaking again: I cannot hear a word. I may have got about a twentieth 
   of what he said.) And I say to him: It was written that his name is Silence, 
   but thou speakest continually. </p>
 <p>And he answers: Nay, the muttering that thou hearest is not my voice. It is 
   the voice of the ape<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>(When I say that he answers, it means that it is the same voice. The being 
   on the throne has not uttered a word.) I say: O thou ape that speakest for Him 
   whose name is Silence, how shall I know that thou speakest truly His thought? 
   And the muttering continues: Nor speaketh He nor thinketh, so that which I say 
   is true, because I lie in speaking His thoughts<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>He goes on, nothing stops him; and the muttering comes so fast that I cannot 
   hear him at all. </p>
 <p>Now the muttering has ceased, or is overwhelmed by the bells, and the bells 
   in their turn are overwhelmed by the whirring, and now the whirring is overwhelmed 
   by the silence. And the blue light is gone, and the throne and the pillars are 
   returned to blackness, and the eyes of him that sitteth upon the throne are 
   no more visible. </p>
 <p>I seek to go up close to the throne, and I am pushed back, because I cannot 
   give the sign. I have given all the signs I know and am entitled to<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>, and I have tried to give the 
   sign that I know and am not entitled to<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>, but have not 
   the necessary appurtenance; and even if I had, it would be useless; for there 
   are two more signs necessary<a href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>I find that I was wrong in suggesting<a href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a> that a Master of the Temple had 
   a right to enter the temple of a Magus or an Ipsissimus. On the contrary, the 
   rule that holds below, holds also above. The higher you go, the greater is the 
   distance from one grade to another<a href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>I am being slowly pushed backwards down the avenue, out into the wind. And 
   this time I am caught up by the wind and whirled away down it like a dead leaf. 
 </p>
 <p>And a great Angel sweeps through the wind, and catches hold of me, and bears 
   me up against it; and he sets me down on the hither side of the wind, and he 
   whispers in my ear: Go thou forth into the world, O thrice and four times blessed 
   who hast gazed upon the horror of the loneliness of The First<a href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>. 
   No man shall look upon his face and live. And thou hast seen his eyes, and understood 
   his heart, for the voice of the ape is the pulse of his heart and the labouring 
   of his breast. Go, therefore, and rejoice, for thou art the prophet of the Aeon 
   arising, wherein He is not<a href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>Give thou praise unto thy lady Nuit, and unto her lord Hadit, that are for 
   thee and thy bride, and the winners of the ordeal X<a href="#30"><font size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And with that we are come to the wall of the Aethyr, and there is a little 
   narrow gate, and he pushes me through it, and I am suddenly in the desert. </p>
 <p>The Desert, near Bou Sada<a href="#31"><font size="1"><strong>31</strong></font></a>.<br>

     He had already chosen this motto, though he had refused to accept the grade 
     when offered to him three years before by the chiefs, after the episode of

   <li><a name="21"></a><font size="2">Kether, of course, does not speak. His Nature 
     is made apparent by Thoth, the Logos, the Creative Word. But this Word must 
     evidently be false, since He is Silence. Thoth, however, is himself accompanied 
     by the Cynocephalos, the dog-headed Ape, who imitates and caricatures all 
     His actions, and misinterprets His speech.</font></li>
   <li><a name="22"></a><font size="2">The idea is that Truth may be stated by 
     denying a falsehood. This lands us in the quagmires of "Zigzagginess",

     Doctrine is that the Ruach (the Mechanism of Thought) is in its essential 
     nature self-contradictory. From now on, the Angels of the Aethyrs begin to 
     speak in the language of Neshamah; they use the logic which pertains above 
     the Abyss. The student will, accordingly, find statements which must be reversed 
     and reversed again and again; both are true and false at once; neither is 
     true or false --- and so on.</font></li>

     there are positive possibilities. More, Kether is not in any case a sole Unity, 
     for each Marriage produces a Twin, {HEB:Heh} + {HEB:Yod} = {HEB:Heh} + {HEB:Vau}. 
     There is a positive "Third Being", a Kether; and there is an Ecstasy,
