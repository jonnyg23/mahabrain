 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 17th Aethyr,<br>
   Which is Called TAN</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
 <p>Into the stone there first cometh the head of a dragon, and then the Angel 
   Madimi<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. She is not the mere elemental 
   that one would suppose from the account of Casaubon. I enquire why her form 
   is different. </p>
 <p>She says: Since all things are God, in all things thou seest just so much of 
   God as thy capacity affordeth thee<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. But behold! Thou 
   must pierce deeply into this Aethyr before true images appear<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>. 
   For TAN is that which transformeth judgment into justice<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. BAL is the sword, 
   and TAN the balances<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>A pair of balances appears in the stone, and on the bar of the balance is written: 
   Motion about a point is iniquity<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And behind the balances is a plume, luminous, azure<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. And somehow connected 
   with the plume, but I cannot divine how, are these words: Breath is iniquity<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. (That is, any wind must stir the 
   feather of truth.) </p>
 <p>And behind the plume is a shining filament of quartz, suspended vertically 
   from the abyss to the abyss<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. And in the midst 
   is a winged disk<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a> of some extremely delicate, translucent 
   substance, on which is written in the "dagger" alphabet: Torsion is 
   iniquity<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. (This means, 
   that the Rashith Ha-Gilgalim is the first appearance of evil.<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>) 
 </p>
 <p>And now an Angel appears, like as he were carven in black diamonds. And he 
   cries: Woe unto the Second, whom all nations of men call the First<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. Woe unto the First, whom all 
   grades of Adepts call the First<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. Woe unto me, 
   for I, even as they, have worshipped him. But she is whose paps are the galaxies<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>, and he that never shall be known<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>, 
   in them is no motion. For the infinite Without filleth all and moveth not<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>, 
   and the infinite Within goeth indeed<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>; but it is no odds, else were 
   the space-marks confounded<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>And now the Angel is but a shining speck of blackness in the midst of a tremendous 
   sphere of liquid and vibrating light, at first gold, then becoming green, and 
   lastly pure blue<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. 
   And I see that the green of Libra is made up of the yellow of air and the blue 
   of water, swords and cups, judgment and mercy<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>. 
   And this word TAN meaneth mercy<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>. And the feather of Maat is blue 
   because the truth of justice is mercy<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>. And a voice 
   cometh, as it were the music of the ripples of the surface of the sphere: Truth 
   is delight <a href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. (This means 
   that the Truth of the universe is delight.) </p>
 <p>Another voice cometh; it is the voice of a mighty Angel, all in silver; the 
   scales of his armour and the plumes of his wings are like mother-of-pearl in 
   a framework of silver<a href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>. 
   And he sayeth: Justice is the equity that ye have made for yourselves between 
   truth and falsehood. But in Truth there is nothing of this, for there is only 
   Truth. Your falsehood is but a little falser than your truth<a href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>. Yet by your 
   truth shall ye come to Truth. Your truth is your troth with Adonai the Beloved 
   one<a href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>. And the Chymical Marriage of 
   the Alchemists beginneth with a Weighing, and he that is not found wanting hath 
   within him one spark of fire, so dense and so intense that it cannot be moved, 
   through all the winds of heaven should clamour against it, and all the waters 
   of the abyss surge against it, and all the multitude of the earths heap themselves 
   upon it to smother it. Nay, it shall not be moved<a href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>And this is the fire of which it is written: "Hear thou the voice of fire!" 
   And the voice of fire is in the second chapter of <em>The Book of the Law</em><a href="#30"><font size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>, that is revealed 
   unto him that is a score and half a score and three that are scores, and six, 
   by Aiwass, that is his guardian, the mighty Angel that extendeth from the first 
   unto the last, and maketh known the mysteries that are beyond. And the method 
   and the form of invocation whereby a man shall attain to the knowledge and conversation 
   of his Holy Guardian Angel shall be given unto thee in the proper place<a href="#31"><font size="1"><strong>31</strong></font></a>, 
   and seeing that the word is deadlier than lightning, do thou meditate straitly 
   thereupon, solitary, in a place where is no living thing visible, but only the 
   light of the sun. And thy head shall be bare<a href="#32"><font size="1"><strong>32</strong></font></a>. Thus mayest thou become fitted 
   to receive this, the holiest of the Mysteries. And it is the holiest of the 
   Mysteries because it is the Next Step. And those Mysteries which lie beyond, 
   though they be holier, are not holy unto thee, but only remote. (The sense of 
   this passage seems to be, that the holiness of a thing implies its personal 
   relation with one, just as one cannot blaspheme an unknown god, because one 
   does not know what to say to annoy him. And this explains the perfect inefficiency 
   of those who try to insult the saints; the most violent attacks are very often 
   merely clumsy compliments.) </p>
 <p>Now the Angel is spread completely over the globe, a dewy film of silver upon 
   that luminous blue. </p>
 <p>And a great voice cries: Behold the Queen of Heaven, how she hath woven her 
   robes from the loom of justice<a href="#33"><font size="1"><strong>33</strong></font></a>. For as that 
   straight path of the Arrow cleaving the Rainbow became righteousness in her 
   that sitteth in the hall of double truth<a href="#34"><font size="1"><strong>34</strong></font></a>, 
   so at last is she exalted unto the throne of the High Priestess, the Priestess 
   of the Silver Star, wherein also is thine Angel made manifest<a href="#35"><font size="1"><strong>35</strong></font></a>. 
   And this is the mystery of the camel that is ten days in the desert, and is 
   not athirst, because he hath within him that water which is the dew distilled 
   from the the night of Nuit<a href="#36"><font size="1"><strong>36</strong></font></a>. 
   Triple is the cord of silver, that it may be not loosed; and three score and 
   half a score and three is the number of the name of my name<a href="#37"><font size="1"><strong>37</strong></font></a>, 
   for that the ineffable wisdom, that also is of the sphere of the stars, informeth 
   me<a href="#38"><font size="1"><strong>38</strong></font></a>. Thus am I crowned 
   with the triangle that is about the eye, and therefore is my number three<a href="#39"><font size="1"><strong>39</strong></font></a>. And in me there is no imperfection, 
   because through me descendeth the influence of TARO<a href="#40"><font size="1"><strong>40</strong></font></a>. 
   And that is also the number of Aiwass the mighty Angel, the Minister of Silence. 
 </p>
 <p>And even as the shew-stone burneth thy forehead with its intolerable flame, 
   so he who hath known me, though but from afar, is marked out and chosen among 
   men, and he shall never turn back or turn aside, for he hath made the link that 
   is not to be broken, nay, not by the malice of the Four Great Princes of evil 
   of the world, nor by Chorozon, that mighty Devil, nor by the wrath of God, nor 
   by the affliction and feebleness of the soul. </p>
 <p>Yet with this assurance be not thou content; for though thou hast the wings 
   of the Eagle, they are vain, except they be joined to the shoulders of the Bull. 
   Now, therefore, I send forth a shaft of my light, even as a ladder let down 
   from the heaven upon the earth, and by this black cross of Themis that I hold 
   before thine eyes, do I swear unto thee that the path shall be open henceforth 
   for evermore. </p>
 <p>There is a clash of a myriad silver cymbals, and silence. And then three times 
   a note is struck upon a bell, which sounds like my holy Tibetan bell, that is 
   made of electrum magicum<a href="#41"><font size="1"><strong>41</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>I am happily returned unto the earth. </p>
 <p>Bou-Sada.<br>

     = 59. This number is a prime, representing the Yoni demanding "justice". 
     This Aethyr instructs the candidate in the formula of justice, of Equilibrium.</font></li>

     To one, Pan means terror and madness, to another, the All-God.</font></li>
   <li><a name="4"></a><font size="2">This is more and more the case as we progress.</font></li>
   <li><a name="5"></a><font size="2">Judgment --- the unmitigated feminine, the 
     severity of sterility. Justice --- she is satisfied by the sword (phallus) 
     and balances (testes) as shown in Atu XIII. The symbolism of the letter Lamed 
     must be very thoroughly studied. It represents the flux of the universe in 
     extension. Contrast this positive equilibrium with the negative, Aleph. The 
     two together form AL (the title of <em>The Book of the Law</em> ) which expresses 
     the universe in its phases, 0 and 2.</font></li>

     constonants L and N). Bal is Hebrew for Lord, i.e. the phallus. See previous 
     note.</font></li>
   <li><a name="7"></a><font size="2">It disturbs the simplicity, introducing a

   <li><a name="8"></a><font size="2">The blue feather is Maat, the Goddess of

     The difference is that the Demiurge creates on his own account; he is not 
     like the Logos, the transmitter of Energy of Kether, and its formulation in 
     a Word.</font></li>
   <li><a name="15"></a><font size="2">Macroposopus himself. For in the ontology 
     of the New Aeon, he is no longer the unique and supreme Point-of-View, to 
     which every ego is subsidiary and must conform.</font></li>

     of the Sun, life itself, is one with Libra, justice; for the letter Lamed 
     signifies the Universe in extension.</font></li>
   <li><a name="23"></a><font size="2">TAN is given in above as meaning the Balances. 
     Thus, as shown in the previous note, the truth of Justice is Mercy. Hence, 
     to aim at Mercy, which is an idea without measure, and therefore incommensurable 
     with Truth, is to invoke Justice. The injunction is: Be strictly just, and 
     you will find that you have accomplished the true Work of Love. </font></li>
   <li><a name="24"></a><font size="2">See previous note. The blue is again that

     is annulled by absorption into the Body of Our Lady of the Stars.</font></li>

     the reflection in positive material nature of the personified idea of Nuit.

   <li><a name="27"></a><font size="2">Human justice is a compromise intended to 
     meet an admittedly false situation. Cf. Lao-tse: Benevolence and righteousness

   <li><a name="28"></a><font size="2">Hence the justice of making the Attainment 
     of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is the next step. 
     The original evil is the separation from Him; so the only approximation to 
     truth is one's oath to Him.</font></li>
   <li><a name="29"></a><font size="2">This spark is Hadit; (hence the reference

   <li><a name="30"></a><font size="2">The Oracle of Zoroaster says: "And 
     when, after all the phantoms are vanished shall appear that holy and formless 
     fire, that fire which darts and flashes throughout the depths of the universe 
     --- hear thou the voice of the fire!" And this is the utterance of Hadit, 
     the deepest expression of one's inmost point of view.</font></li>

   <li><a name="33"></a><font size="2">This blue and silver of Luna, the "queen 
     of heaven" (in King and Queen scales) are said to be derived from the 
     justice in her true nature. This justice refers to her point on the Tree; 
     the troth with Adonai.</font></li>
   <li><a name="34"></a><font size="2">The arrow = Sagittarius = blue. Its ruler 
     = Jupiter = blue (Queen scale) = Righteousness. The plumes of Maat, are blue.</font></li>
   <li><a name="35"></a><font size="2">Here we are asked to note a certain correspondence 
     of ascending vibration. {HEB:Samekh} = {Sagittarius}, {HEB:Lamed} = {Libra}, 
     {HEB:Gemel} = {Moon}. {GRK:Lambda} {GRK:Gamma} {GRK:Sigma} are the consonants 
     of Logos. We shall see later an important doctrine drawn from this special 
     association of these three letters. The Holy Guardian Angel appears as {HEB:Gemel} 
     because of its position on the Tree.</font></li>
   <li><a name="36"></a><font size="2">{HEB:Gemel} means camel. The ten days are

   <li><a name="38"></a><font size="2">Wisdom = {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Mem}{HEB:Koph}{HEB:Chet}

     73 is is here explained as the Eye in the Triangle. So Aiwass is the Eye in 
     the Star of Hermes, the messenger, whose formula is 418 = {HEB:Chet}</font></li>
   <li><a name="40"></a><font size="2">TARO has 78 symbols and 78 = {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Lamed}{HEB:Zain} 
     {HEB:Mem}, the influence that descends from the Most Holy Ancient One, Kether, 
     and therefore referred to {HEB:Gemel}. The equation 78 = Aiwass; at this time, 
     the Seer thought that Aiwass was spelled {HEB:Samekh} {HEB:Aleph} {HEB:Vau}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Aleph} 
     = 78 {WEH Note: TS has "418"}, Whereas, as he found later, {HEB:Zain}{HEB:Vau} 
     {HEB:Yod} {HEB:Ayin} = 93 and {GRK:Alpha} {GRK:iota} {GRK:digamma} {GRK:alpha}{GRK:sigma}{GRK:sigma} 
     = 418. But 78 is actually the number of Aiwass in another way.</font></li>
