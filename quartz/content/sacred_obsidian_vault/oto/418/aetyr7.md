 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 7th Aethyr,<br>
   Which is Called DEO</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
 <p>The stone is divided, the left half dark, the right half light, and at the 
   bottom thereof is a certain blackness, of three divergent columns. And it seems 
   as if the black and white halves are the halves of a door, and in the door is 
   a little key-hole, in the shape of the Astrological symbol of Venus. And from 
   the key-hole issue flames, blue and green and violet, but without any touch 
   of yellow or red in them. It seems as if there were a wind beyond the door, 
   that is blowing the flame out. </p>
 <p>And a voice comes: "Who is he that hath the key to the gate of the evening 
   star?" </p>
 <p>And now an Angel cometh and seeketh to open the door by trying many keys. And 
   they are none of any avail. And the same voice saith: "The five and the 
   six are balanced in the word Abrahadabra, and therein is the mystery disclosed. 
   But the key unto this gate is the balance of the seven and the four; and of 
   this thou hast not even the first letter. Now there is a word of four letters 
   that containeth in itself all the mystery of the Tetragrammaton<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>, 
   and there is a word of seven letters which it concealeth<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>, and that again 
   concealeth the holy word that is the key of the abyss<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>. 
   And this thou shalt find, revolving it in thy mind. </p>
 <p>Hide therefore thine eyes. And I will set my key in the lock, and open it. 
   Yet still let thine eyes be hidden, for thou canst not bear the glory that is 
   within. </p>
 <p>So, therefore, I covered mine eyes with my hands. Yet through my hands could 
   I perceive a little of those bowers of azure flame. </p>
 <p>And a voice said: It is kindled into fire that was the blue breast of ocean; 
   because this is the bar of heaven, and the feet of the Most High are set thereon. 
 </p>
 <p>Now I behold more fully: Each tongue of flame, each leaf of flame, each flower 
   of flame, is one of the great love-stories of the world, with all its retinue 
   of <em>mise-en-sc ne</em>. And now there is a most marvelous rose formed from 
   the flame, and a perpetual rain of lilies and passion-flowers and violets. And 
   there is gathered out of it all, yet identical with it, the form of a woman 
   like the woman in the Apocalypse, but her beauty and her radiance are such that 
   one cannot look thereon, save with sidelong glances. I enter immediately into 
   trance. It seems that it is she of whom it is written, "The fool hath said 
   in his heart 'there is no God.'" But the words are not Ain Elohim, but 
   La (=nay!) and Elohim contracted from 86 to 14, because La is 31, which x 14 
   is 434, Daleth, Lamed, Tau. This fool is the fool of the Path of Aleph, and 
   sayeth, which is Chokmah, in his heart, which is Tiphereth, that she existeth, 
   in order first that the Wisdom may be joined with the Understanding; and he 
   affirmeth her in Tiphereth that she may be fertile. </p>
 <p>It is impossible to describe how this vision changeth from glory unto glory, 
   for at each glance the vision is changed. And this is because she transmitteth 
   the Word to the Understanding, and therefore hath she many forms, and each goddess 
   of love is but a letter of the alphabet of love. </p>
 <p>Now, there is a mystery in the word Logos, that containeth the three letters 
   whose analogy hath been shown in the lower heavens, Samech, and Lamed, and Gimel, 
   that are 93, which is thrice 31, and in them are set the two eyes of Horus<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. 
   (Ayin means an eye.) For, if it were not so, the arrow could not pierce the 
   rainbow, and there could be no poise in the balance, and the Great Book should 
   never be unsealed. But this is she that poureth the Water of Life upon her head, 
   whence it floweth to fructify the earth<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. But now the whole 
   Aethyr is the most brilliant peacock blue. It <em>is</em> the Universal Peacock 
   that I behold. </p>
 <p>And there is a voice: Is not this bird the bird of Juno, that is an hundred, 
   and thirty, and six<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>? And therefore is she the mate 
   of Jupiter<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>And now the peacock's head is again changed into a woman's head sparkling and 
   coruscating with its own light of gems. </p>
 <p>But I look upwards, seeing that she is called the footstool of the Holy One, 
   even as Binah is called His throne. And the whole Aethyr is full of the most 
   wonderful bands of light, --- a thousand different curves and whorls, even as 
   it was before, when I spake mysteries of the Holy Qabalah, and so could not 
   describe it. </p>
 <p>Oh, I see vast plains beneath her feet, enormous deserts studded with great 
   rocks; and I see little lonely souls, running helplessly about, minute black 
   creatures like men<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. 
   And they keep up a very curious howling, that I can compare to nothing that 
   I have ever heard; yet it is strangely human. </p>
 <p>And the voice says: These are they that grasped love and clung thereto, praying 
   ever at the knees of the great goddess. These are they that have shut themselves 
   up in fortresses of Love. </p>
 <p>Each plume of the peacock is full of eyes, that are at the same time 4 x 7. 
   And for this is the number 28 reflected down into Netzach; and that 28 is Kaph 
   Cheth (Kach), power. For she is Sakti, the eternal energy of the Concealed One. 
   And it is her eternal energy that hath made this eternal change. And this explaineth 
   the call of the Aethyrs, the curse that was pronounced in the beginning being 
   but the creation of Sakti. And this mystery is reflected in the legend of the 
   Creation, where Adam represents the Concealed One, for Adam is Temurah of MAD, 
   the Enochian word for God, and Eve, whom he created for love, is tempted by 
   the snake, Nechesh, who is Messiah her child. And the snake is the magical power, 
   which hath destroyed the primordial equilibrium. </p>
 <p>And the garden is the supernal Eden, where is Ayin, 70, the Eye of the Concealed 
   One, and the creative Lingam; and Daleth, love; and Nun the serpent<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. And therefore 
   this constitution was implicitly in the nature of Eden (cf. <em>Liber L</em>., 
   I., 29, 30), so that the call of the Aethyrs could not have been any other call 
   than that which it is. </p>
 <p>But they that are without understanding have interpreted all this askew, because 
   of the Mystery of the Abyss, for there is no Path from Binah unto Chesed; and 
   therefore the course of the Flaming Sword was no more a current, but a spark. 
   And when the Stooping Dragon raised his head unto Dath in the course of that 
   spark, there was, as it were, an explosion, and his head was blasted. And the 
   ashes thereof were dispersed throughout the whole of the 10th Aethyr. And for 
   this, all knowledge is piecemeal, and it is of no value unless it be co-ordinated 
   by Understanding. </p>
 <p>And now the form of the Aethyr is the form of a mighty Eagle of ruddy brass. 
   And the plumes are set alight, and are whirled round and round until the whole 
   heaven is blackness with these flying sparks therein. </p>
 <p>Now it is all branching streams of golden fire tipped with scarlet at the edges<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And now She cometh forth again, riding upon a dolphin. Now again I see those 
   wandering souls, that have sought restricted love, and have not understood that 
   "the word of sin is restriction." </p>
 <p>It is very curious; they seem to be looking for one another or for something, 
   all the time, constantly hurrying about. But they knock up against one another 
   and yet will not see one another, or cannot see one another, because they are 
   so shut up in their cloaks. </p>
 <p>And a voice sounds: It is most terrible for the one that hath shut himself 
   up and made himself fast against the universe. For they that sit encamped upon 
   the sea in the city of the Pyramids are indeed shut up. But they have given 
   their blood, even to the last drop, to fill the cup of BABALON. </p>
 <p>These that thou seest are indeed the Black Brothers, for it is written: "He 
   shall laugh at their calamity and mock them when their fear cometh." And 
   therefore hath he exalted them unto the plane of love. </p>
 <p>And yet again it is written: He desireth not the death of a sinner, but rather 
   that he should turn from his wickedness. Now, if one of these were to cast off 
   his cloak he should behold the brilliance of the lady of the Aethyr; but they 
   will not. </p>
 <p>And yet again there is another cause wherefore He hath permitted them to enter 
   thus far within the frontiers of Eden, so that His thought should never swerve 
   from compassion. But do thou behold the brilliance of Love, that casteth forth 
   seven stars upon thine head from her right hand, and crowneth thee with a crown 
   of seven roses. Behold! She is seated upon the throne of turquoise and lapis 
   lazuli, and she is like a flawless emerald, and upon the pillars that support 
   the canopy of her throne are sculptured the Ram, and the Sparrow, and the Cat, 
   and a strange fish<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. 
   Behold! How she shineth! Behold! How her glances have kindled all these fires 
   that have blown about the heavens! Yet remember that in every one there goeth 
   forth for a witness the justice of the Most High. Is not Libra the House of 
   Venus? And there goeth forth a sickle that shall reap every flower. Is not Saturn 
   exalted in Libra? Daleth, Lamed, Tau<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And therefore was he a fool who uttered her name in his heart, for the root 
   of evil is the root of breath, and the speech in the silence was a lie. </p>
 <p>Thus is it seen from below by them that understand not. But from above he rejoiceth, 
   for the joy of dissolution is ten thousand, and the pang of birth but a little<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And now thou shalt go forth from the Aethyr, for the voice of the Aethyr is 
   hidden and concealed from thee because thou hadst not the key of the door thereof, 
   and thine eyes were not able to bear the splendour of the vision. But thou shalt 
   meditate upon the mysteries thereof, and upon the lady of the Aethyr; and it 
   may be by the wisdom of the Most High that the true voice of the Aethyr, that 
   is continual song, may be heard of thee. </p>
 <p>Return therefore instantly unto the earth, and sleep not for a while; but withdraw 
   thyself from this matter. And it shall be enough. </p>
 <p>Thus then was I obedient unto the voice, and returned into my body. </p>
