 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 24th Aethyr,<br>
   Which is Called NIA</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a><font size="6"><strong> </strong></font></p>
 <p>An angel comes forward into the stone like a warrior clad in chain- armour. 
   Upon his head are plumes of gray<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>, spread out like 
   the fan of a peacock<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. About his feet a great army of 
   scorpions and dogs, lions, elephants, and many other wild beasts. He stretches 
   forth his arms to heaven and cries; In the crackling of the lightning, in the 
   rolling of the thunder, in the clashing of the swords and the hurling of the 
   arrows<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>: be thy name 
   exalted! </p>
 <p>Streams of fire come out of the heavens, a pale brilliant blue<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>, 
   like plumes. And they gather themselves and settle upon his lips. His lips are 
   redder than roses, and the blue plumes gather themselves into a blue rose<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>, and from beneath the petals of 
   the rose come brightly coloured humming-birds<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>, 
   and dew falls from the rose- honey-coloured dew<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. I stand in the 
   shower of it. </p>
 <p>And a voice proceeds from the rose: Come away! Our chariot is drawn by doves<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. 
   Of mother-of-pearl and ivory is our chariot<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a> and the reins thereof are the 
   heart-strings of men. Every moment that we fly shall cover an aeon. And every 
   place on which we rest shall be a young universe rejoicing in its strength; 
   the meadows thereof shall be covered with flowers. There shall we rest but a 
   night, and in the morning we shall flee away, comforted. </p>
 <p>Now, to myself, I have imagined the chariot of which the voice spake, and I 
   looked to see who was with me in the chariot. It was an Angel of golden hair 
   and golden skin, whose eyes were bluer than the sea, whose mouth was redder 
   than the fire, whose breath was ambrosial air. Finer than a spider's web were 
   her robes. And they were of the seven colours<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>All this I saw; and then the hidden voice went on low and sweet: Come away! 
   The price of the journey is little, though its name be death. Thou shalt die 
   to all that thou fearest and hopest and hatest and lovest and thinkest and art. 
   Yea! thou shalt die, even as thou must die. For all that thou hast, thou hast 
   not; all that thou art, thou art not<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>! 
 </p>
 <p>NENNI OFEKUFA ANANAEL LAIADA I MAELPEREJI NONUKA AFAFA ADAREPEHETA PEREGI ALADI 
   NIISA NIISA LAPE OL ZODIR IDOIAN<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>And I said: ODO KIKALE QAA. Why art thou hidden from me, whom I hear? </p>
 <p>And the voice answered and said unto me: Hearing is of the spirit alone<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. 
   Thou art a partaker of the five-fold mystery<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. Thou must roll up the ten divine 
   ones like a scroll, and fashion therefrom a star<a href="#16"><font size="2"><strong>16</strong></font></a>. 
   Yet must thou blot out the star in the heart of Hadit<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>For the blood of my heart is like a warm bath of myrrh and ambergris; bathe 
   thyself therein. The blood of my heart is all gathered upon my lips if I kiss 
   thee, burns in my fingertips if I caress thee, burns in my womb when thou art 
   caught up into my bed. Mighty are the stars; mighty is the sun; mighty is the 
   moon; mighty is the voice of the ever-living one, and the echoes of his whisper 
   are the thunders of the dissolution of the worlds. But my silence is mightier 
   than they. Close up the worlds like unto a weary house; close up the book of 
   the recorder, and let the veil swallow up the shrine, for I am arisen, O my 
   fair one, and there is no more need of all these things. </p>
 <p>If once I put thee apart from me, it was the joy of play. Is not the ebb and 
   flowing of the tide a music of the sea? Come, let us mount unto Nuit our mother 
   and be lost! Let being be emptied in the infinite abyss! For by me only shalt 
   thou mount; thou hast none other wings than mine<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>All this while the Rose has been shooting out blue flames, coruscating like 
   snakes through the whole Aire. And the snakes have taken shapes of sentences. 
   One of them is: <em>Sub umbra alarum tuarum Adonai quies et felicitas</em><a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>. 
   And another: <em>Summum bonum, vera sapientia, magnanima vita, sub noctis nocte 
   sunt</em><a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>. And another is: <em>Vera medicina 
   est vinum mortis</em><a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. And another is: <em>Libertas 
   evangelii per jugum legis ob gloriam dei intactam ad vacuum nequaquam tendit</em><a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>. 
   And another is: <em>Sub aqu lex terrarum</em><a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>. And another 
   is: <em>Mens edax rerum, cor umbra rerum; intelligentia via summa</em><a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>. 
   And another is: <em>Summa via lucis: per Hephaestum</em> <em>undas regas</em><a href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. 
   And another is: <em>Vir introit tumulum regis, invenit oleum lucis</em><a href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And all round the whole of these things are the letters TARO; but the light 
   is so dreadful that I cannot read the words. I am going to try again. All these 
   serpents are collected together very thickly at the edges of the wheel, because 
   there are an innumerable number of sentences. One is: <em>tres annos regimen 
   oraculi</em><a href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>. And another 
   is: <em>terribilis ardet rex</em> {HEB:Nun-final}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Lamed}{HEB:Ayin}<a href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>. And another 
   is: <em>Ter amb</em> (amp?) (can't see it) <em>Rosam oleo</em> (?)<a href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a>. 
   And another is: Tribus annulis regna olisbon<a href="#30"><font size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>. And the marvel is that with those 
   four letters you can get a complete set of rules for doing everything, both 
   for white magic and black. </p>
 <p>And now I see the heart of the rose again. I see the face of him that is the 
   heart of the rose, and in the glory of that face I am ended. My eyes are fixed 
   upon his eyes; my being is sucked up through my eyes into those eyes. And I 
   see through those eyes, and lo! the universe, like whirling sparks of gold, 
   blown like a tempest. I seem to swell out again into him. My consciousness fills 
   the whole Aethyr. I hear the cry NIA, ringing again and again from within me. 
   It sounds like infinite music, and behind the sound is the meaning of the Aethyr. 
   Again there are no words. </p>
 <p>All this time the whirling sparks of gold go on, and they are like blue sky, 
   with a lot of rather thin white clouds in it, outside. And now I see mountains 
   round, far blue mountains, purple mountains. And in the midst is a little green 
   dell of moss, which is all sparkling with dew that drips from the rose. And 
   I am lying on that moss with my face upwards, drinking, drinking, drinking, 
   drinking, drinking of the dew. </p>
 <p>I cannot describe to you the joy and the exhaustion of everything that was, 
   and the energy of everything that is, for it is only a corpse that is lying 
   on the moss. I am the soul of the Aethyr<a href="#31"><font size="1"><strong>31</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>Now it reverberates like the swords of archangels, clashing upon the armour 
   of the damned; and there seem to be the blacksmiths of heaven beating the steel 
   of the worlds upon the anvils of hell, to make a roof to the Aethyr<a href="#32"><font size="1"><strong>32</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>For if the great work were accomplished and all the Aethyrs were caught up 
   into one, then would the vision fail; then would the voice be still. </p>
 <p>Now all is gone from the stone. </p>
 <p>Ain el Hajel. November 26, 1909. 2-3:25 p.m.</p>
