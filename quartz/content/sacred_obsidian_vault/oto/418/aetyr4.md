 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 4th Aethyr,<br>
   Which is Called PAZ</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
 <p>The Stone is translucent and luminous, and no images enter therein. </p>
 <p>A voice says: Behold the brilliance of the Lord, whose feet are set upon him 
   that pardoneth transgression. Behold the six-fold Star that flameth in the Vault, 
   the seal of the marriage of the great White King and his black slave<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>So I looked into the Stone, and beheld the six-fold Star: the whole Aethyr 
   is as tawny clouds, like the flame of a furnace. And there is a mighty host 
   of Angels, blue and golden, that throng it, and they cry: Holy, Holy, Holy art 
   thou, that art not shaken in the earthquakes, and in the thunders! The end of 
   things is come upon us; the day of be-with-us is at hand! For he hath created 
   the universe, and overthrown it, that he might take his pleasure thereupon. 
 </p>
 <p>And now, in the midst of the Aethyr, I beheld that god. </p>
 <p>He hath a thousand arms, and in each hand is a weapon of terrible strength. 
   His face is more terrible than the storm, and from his eyes flash lightnings 
   of intolerable brilliance. From his mouth run seas of blood. Upon his head is 
   a crown of every deadly thing. Upon his forehead is the upright tau, and on 
   either side of it are the signs of blasphemy. And about him clingeth a young 
   girl, like unto the king's daughter that appeareth in the ninth Aethyr. But 
   she is become rosy by reason of his force, and her purity hath tinged his black 
   with blue. </p>
 <p>They are clasped in a furious embrace, so that she is torn asunder by the terror 
   of the god; yet so tightly clingeth she about him, that he is strangled. She 
   hath forced back his head, and his throat is livid with the pressure of her 
   fingers. Their joint cry is an intolerable anguish, yet it is the cry of their 
   rapture, so that every pain, and every curse, and every bereavement, and every 
   death of everything in the whole universe, is but one little gust of wind in 
   that tempest-scream of ecstasy<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>The voice thereof is not articulate. It is in vain to seek comparison. It is 
   absolutely continuous, without breaks or beats. If there seem to be vibration 
   therein, it is because of the imperfection of the ears of the seer. </p>
 <p>And there cometh an interior voice, which sayeth to the seer that he hath trained 
   his eyes well and can see much; and he hath trained his ears a little, and can 
   hear a little; but his other senses hath he trained scarcely at all, and therefore 
   the Aethyrs are almost silent to him on those planes. By the senses are meant 
   the spiritual correlations of the senses, not the physical senses. But this 
   matters little, because the Seer, so far as he is a seer, is the expression 
   of the spirit of humanity<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>. 
   What is true of him is true of humanity, so that even if he had been able to 
   receive the full Aethyrs, he could not have communicated them. </p>
 <p>And an Angel speaks: Behold, this vision is utterly beyond thine understanding. 
   Yet shalt thou endeavour to unite thyself with the dreadful marriage-bed. </p>
 <p>So I am torn asunder, nerve from nerve and vein from vein, and more intimately 
   --- cell from cell, molecule from molecule, and atom from atom, and at the same 
   time all crushed together. Write down that the tearing asunder <em>is</em> a 
   crushing together<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. 
   All the double phenomena are only two ways of looking at a single phenomenon; 
   and the single phenomenon is Peace. There is no sense in my words or in my thoughts. 
   "Faces half- formed arose." This is the meaning of that passage; they 
   are attempts to interpret Chaos, but Chaos is Peace. Cosmos is the War of the 
   Rose and the Cross<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. 
   That was "a half-formed face" that I said then. All images are useless. 
 </p>
 <p>Blackness, blackness intolerable, before the beginning of the light. This is 
   the first verse of Genesis. Holy art thou, Chaos, Chaos, Eternity, all contradictions 
   in terms! </p>
 <p>Oh, blue! blue! blue! whose reflection in the Abyss is called the Great One 
   of the Night of Time; between ye vibrateth the Lord of the Forces of Matter. 
 </p>
 <p>O Nox, Nox qui celas infamiam infandi nefandi, Deo solo sit laus qui dedit 
   signum non scribendum. Laus virgini cuius stuprum tradit salutem. </p>
 <p>O Night, that givest suck from thy paps to sorcery, and theft, and rape, and 
   gluttony, and murder, and tyranny, and to the nameless Horror, cover us, cover 
   us, cover us from the Rod of Destiny; for Cosmos must come, and the balance 
   be set up where there was no need of balance, because there was no injustice, 
   but only truth. But when the balances are equal, scale matched with scale, then 
   will Chaos<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a> return. 
 </p>
 <p>Yea, as in a looking-glass, so in thy mind, that is backed with the false metal 
   of lying, is every symbol read averse. Lo! everything wherein thou hast trusted 
   must confound thee, and that thou didst flee from was thy saviour. So therefore 
   didst thou shriek in the Black Sabbath when thou didst kiss the hairy buttocks 
   of the goat, when the gnarled god tore thee asunder, when the icy cataract of 
   death swept thee away<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>Shriek, therefore, shriek aloud; mingle the roar of the gored lion and the 
   moan of the torn bull, and the cry of the man that is torn by the claws of the 
   Eagle, and the scream of the Eagle that is strangled by the hands of the Man. 
   Mingle all these in the death-shriek of the Sphinx, for the blind man hath profaned 
   her mystery. Who is this, Oedipus, Tiresias, Erinyes? Who is this, that is blind 
   and a seer, a fool above wisdom? Whom do the hounds of heaven follow, and the 
   crocodiles of hell await<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>? Aleph, vau, yod, 
   ayin, resh, tau, is his name<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>Beneath his feet is the kingdom, and upon his head the crown. He is spirit 
   and matter; he is peace and power; in him is Chaos and Night and Pan, and upon 
   BABALON his concubine, that hath made him drunk upon the blood of the saints 
   that she hath gathered in her golden cup, hath he begotten the virgin that now 
   he doth deflower. And this is that which is written: Malkuth shall be uplifted 
   and set upon the throne of Binah<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. 
   And this is the stone of the philosophers that is set as a seal upon the tomb 
   of Tetragrammaton, and the elixir of life that is distilled from the blood of 
   the saints, and the red powder that is the grinding-up of the bones of Choronzon. 
 </p>
 <p>Terrible and wonderful is the Mystery thereof, O thou Titan that hast climbed 
   into the bed of Juno! Surely thou art bound unto, and broken upon, the wheel<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>; yet hast thou uncovered the nakedness 
   of the Holy One, and the Queen of Heaven is in travail of child, and his name 
   shall be called Vir, and Vis, and Virus, and Virtus, and Viridis, in one name 
   that is all these, and above all these<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>Desolate, desolate is the Aethyr, for thou must return unto the habitations 
   of the Owl and the Bat, unto the Scorpions of the sand, and the blanched eyeless 
   beetles that have neither wing nor horn. Return, blot out the vision, wipe from 
   thy mind the memory thereof; stifle the fire with green wood; consume the Sacrament; 
   cover the Altar; veil the Shrine; shut up the Temple and spread booths in the 
   market place; until the appointed time come when the Holly One shall declare 
   unto thee the Mystery of the Third Aethyr. </p>
 <p>Yet be thou wake and ware, for the great Angel Hua is about thee, and overshadoweth 
   thee, and at any moment he may come upon thee unawares. The voice of PAZ is 
   ended. </p>
