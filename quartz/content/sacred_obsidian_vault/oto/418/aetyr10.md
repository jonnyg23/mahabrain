 <p align="center">In nomine BABALON Amen. </p>
 <p align="center">Restriction unto Choronzon<a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a>.</p>
 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Tenth Aethyr</strong></font><a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a><font size="6"><strong> is Called ZAX</strong></font><a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a><font size="6"><strong>.</strong></font></p>
 <p align="center">This Aethyr being accursèd, and the seer forewarned, he taketh 
   these precautions for the scribe. </p>
 <p align="left">First let the scribe be seated in the centre of the circle in 
   the desert sand, and let the circle be fortified by the Holy Names of God --- 
   Tetragrammaton and Shaddai El Chai and Ararita. </p>
 <p>And let the Demon be invoked within a triangle, wherein is inscribed the name 
   of Choronzon, and about it let him write ANAPHAXETON --- ANAPHANETON -- PRIMEUMATON, 
   and in the angles MI-CA-EL<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>: 
   and at each angle the Seer shall slay a pigeon<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>, and having done 
   this, let him retire to a secret place, where is neither sight nor hearing, 
   and sit within his black robe, secretly invoking the Aethyr<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. And let the Scribe perform the 
   Banishing Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>, 
   and let him call upon the Holy Names of God, and say the Exorcism of Honorius<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>, 
   and let him beseech protection and help of the Most High. </p>
 <p>And let him be furnished with the Magick Dagger<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>, and let him strike 
   fearlessly at anything that may seek to break through the circle, were it the 
   appearance of the Seer himself. And if the Demon pass out of the triangle, let 
   him threaten him with the Dagger, and command him to return. And let him beware 
   lest he himself lean beyond the circle. And since he reverenceth the Person 
   of the Seer as his Teacher, let the Seer bind him with a great Oath to do this. 
 </p>
 <p>Now, then, the Seer being entered within the triangle, let him take the Victims 
   and cut their throats, pouring the blood within the Triangle, and being most 
   heedful that not one drop fall without the Triangle; or else Choronzon should 
   be able to manifest in the universe. </p>
 <p>And when the sand hath sucked up the blood of the victims, let him recite the 
   Call of the Aethyr apart secretly as aforesaid. Then will the Vision be revealed, 
   and the Voice heard. </p>
 <p align="center"><em>The Oath</em> </p>
 <p>I, Omnia Vincam, a Probationer of A{.·.} A{.·.}, hereby solemnly promise upon 
   my magical honour, and swear by Adonai the angel that guardeth me, that I will 
   defend this magic circle of Art with thoughts and words and deeds. I promise 
   to threaten with the Dagger and command back into the triangle the spirit incontinent, 
   if he should strive to escape from it; and to strike with a Dagger at anything 
   that may seek to enter this Circle, were it in appearance the body of the Seer 
   himself. And I will be exceeding wary, armed against force and cunning; and 
   I will preserve with my life the inviolability of this Circle, Amen. </p>
 <p>And I summon mine Holy Guardian Angel to witness this mine oath, the which 
   if I break, may I perish, forsaken of Him. Amen and Amen.</p>
 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 10th Aethyr,<br>
   Which is Called ZAX</strong> </font></p>
 <p>There is no being in the outermost Abyss, but constant forms come forth from 
   the nothingness of it<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>Then the Devil of the Aethyr, that mighty devil Choronzon, crieth aloud, Zazaz<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>, Zazas, Nasatanada Zasas. </p>
 <p>I am the Master of Form<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>, 
   and from me all forms proceed.</p>
 <p>I am I. I have shut myself up from the spendthrifts, my gold is safe in my 
   treasure-chamber, and I have made every living thing my concubine, and none 
   shall touch them, save only I. And yet I am scorched, even while I shiver in 
   the wind. He hateth me and tormenteth me. He would have stolen me from myself, 
   but I shut myself up and mock at him, even while he plagueth me. From me come 
   leprosy and pox and plague and cancer and cholera and the falling sickness. 
   Ah! I will reach up to the knees of the Most High, and tear his phallus with 
   my teeth, and I will bray his testicles in a mortar, and make poison thereof, 
   to slay the sons of men<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>(Here the Spirit stimulated the voice of Frater P., which also appeared to 
   come from his station and not from the triangle.) </p>
 <p>I don't think I can get any more; I think that's all there is. </p>
 <p>(The Frater was seated in a secret place covered completely by a black robe<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>, 
   in the position called the "Thunderbolt". He did not move or speak 
   during the ceremony.) </p>
 <p>Next the Scribe was hallucinated, believing that before him was a beautiful 
   courtesan whom previously he had loved in Paris. Now, she wooed him with soft 
   words and glances, but he knew these things for delusions of the devil, and 
   he would not leave the circle. </p>
 <p>The demon then laughed wildly and loud. </p>
 <p>(Upon the Scribe threatening him, the Demon proceeded, after a short delay.) 
 </p>
 <p>They have called me the God of laughter, and I laugh when I will slay. And 
   they have thought that I could not smile, but I smile upon whom I would seduce. 
   O inviolable one, that canst not not be tempted<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. If thou canst command me by the 
   power of the Most High, know that I did indeed tempt thee, and it repenteth 
   me. I bow myself humbly before the great and terrible names whereby thou hast 
   conjured and constrained me. But thy name is mercy, and I cry aloud for pardon. 
   Let me come and put my head beneath thy feet, that I may serve thee. For if 
   thou commandest me to obedience in the Holy names, I cannot swerve therefrom, 
   for their first whispering is greater than the noise of all my temptests. Bid 
   me therefore come unto thee upon my hands and knees that I may adore thee, and 
   partake of thy forgiveness. Is not thy mercy infinite? </p>
 <p>(Here Choronzon attempts to seduce the Scribe by appealing to his pride. </p>
 <p>But the Scribe refused to be tempted, and commanded the demon to continue with 
   the Aethyr. </p>
 <p>There was again a short delay.) </p>
 <p>Choronzon hath no form, because he is the maker of all form; and so rapidly 
   he changeth from one to the other as he may best think fit to seduce those whom 
   he hateth, the servants of the Most High. </p>
 <p>Thus taketh he the form of a beautiful woman, or of a wise and holy man, or 
   of a serpent that writheth upon the earth ready to sting<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And, because he is himself, therefore he is no self; the terror of darkness, 
   and the blindness of night, and the deafness of the adder, and the tastelessness 
   of stale and stagnant water, and the black fire of hatred, and the udders of 
   the Cat of slime; not one thing, but many things. Yet, with all that, his torment 
   is eternal. The sun burns him as he writhes naked upon the sands of hell, and 
   the wind cuts him bitterly to the bone, a harsh dry wind, so that he is sore 
   athirst. Give unto me, I pray thee, one drop of water from the pure springs 
   of Paradise, that I may quench my thirst. </p>
 <p>(The Scribe refused.) </p>
 <p>Sprinkle water upon my head. I can hardly go on<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>(This last was spoken from the triangle in the natural voice of the Frater, 
   which Choronzon again simulated. But he did not succeed in taking the Frater's 
   form --- which was absurd! </p>
 <p>The Scribe resisted the appeal to his pity, and conjured the demon to proceed 
   by the names of the Most High. Choronzon attempted also to seduce the faithfulness 
   of the Scribe. A long colloquy ensued. The Scribe cursed him by the Holy Names 
   of God, and the power of the Pentagram.<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>) 
 </p>
 <p>I feed upon the names of the Most High. I churn them in my jaws, and I void 
   them from my fundament. I fear not the power of the Pentagram, for I am the 
   Master of the Triangle. My name is three hundred and thirty and three, and that 
   is thrice one<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>. Be 
   vigilant, therefore, for I warn thee that I am about to deceive thee. I shall 
   say words that thou wilt take to be the cry of the Aethyr, and thou wilt write 
   them down, thinking them to be great secrets of Magick power, and they will 
   be only my jesting with thee. </p>
 <p>(Here the Scribe invoked the Angels, and the Holy Guardian Angel of the Frater 
   P. . . . The demon replied:) </p>
 <p>I know the name of the Angel of thee and thy brother P. . . ., and all thy 
   dealings with him are but a cloak for thy filthy sorceries. </p>
 <p>(Here the Scribe averred that he knew more than the demon, and so feared him 
   not, and ordered the demon to proceed.) </p>
 <p>Thou canst tell me naught that I know not, for in me is all Knowledge: Knowledge 
   is my name. Is not the head of the great Serpent arisen into Knowledge<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>?</p>
 <p>(Here the Scribe again commanded Choronzon to continue with the call.) </p>
 <p>Know thou that there is no Cry in the tenth Aethyr like unto the other Cries, 
   for Choronzon is Dispersion, and cannot fix his mind upon any one thing for 
   any length of time. Thou canst master him in argument, O talkative one; thou 
   wast commanded, wast thou not, to talk to Choronzon? He sought not to enter 
   the circle, or to leave the triangle, yet thou didst prate of all these things. 
 </p>
 <p>(Here the Scribe threatened the demon with anger and pain and hell. The demon 
   replied:) </p>
 <p>Thinkest thou, O fool, that there is any anger and any pain that I am not, 
   or any hell but this my spirit? Images, images, images, all without control, 
   all without reason. The malice of Choronzon is not the malice of a being; it 
   is the quality of malice, because he that boasteth himself "I am I", 
   hath in truth no self, and these are they that are fallen under my power, the 
   slaves of the Blind One that boasted himself to be the Enlightened One. For 
   there is no centre, nay, nothing but Dispersion. </p>
 <p>Woe, woe, woe, threefold to him that is led away by talk, O talkative One. 
 </p>
 <p>O thou that hast written two-and-thirty books of Wisdom, and art more stupid 
   than an owl, by thine own talk is thy vigilance wearied, and by my talk art 
   thou befooled and tricked, O thou that sayest that thou shalt endure. Knowest 
   thou how nigh thou art to destruction? For thou that art the Scribe hast not 
   the understanding<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a> that alone availeth 
   against Choronzon. And wert thou not protected by the Holy Names of God and 
   the circle, I would rush upon thee and tear thee. For when I made myself like 
   unto a beautiful woman, if thou hadst come to me, I would have rotted thy body 
   with the pox, and thy liver with cancer, and I would have torn off thy testicles 
   with my teeth. And if I had seduced thy pride, and thou hadst bidden me to come 
   into the circle, I would have trampled thee under foot, and for a thousand years 
   shouldst thou have been but one of the tape-worms that is in me. And if I had 
   seduced thy pity, and thou hadst poured one drop of water without the circle, 
   then would I have blasted thee with flame. But I was not able to prevail against 
   thee. </p>
 <p>How beautiful are the shadows of the ripples of the sand! </p>
 <p>Would God that I were dead. </p>
 <p>For know that I am proud and revengeful and lascivious, and I prate even as 
   thou. For even as I walked among the Sons of God, I heard it said that P. . 
   . . could both will and know, and might learn at length to dare, but that to 
   keep silence he should never learn. O thou that art so ready to speak, so slow 
   to watch, thou art delivered over unto my power for this. And now one word was 
   necessary unto me, and I could not speak it. I behold the beauty of the earth 
   in her desolation, and greater far is mine, who sought to be my naked self. 
   Knowest thou that in my soul is utmost fear? And such is my force and my cunning, 
   that a hundred times have I been ready to leap, and for fear have missed. And 
   a thousand times am I baulked by them of the City of the Pyramids, that set 
   snares for my feet. More knowledge have I than the Most High, but my will is 
   broken, and my fierceness is marred by fear, and I must speak, speak, speak, 
   millions of mad voices in my brain. </p>
 <p>With a heart of furious fancies, Whereof I am Commander, With a burning spear 
   And a horse of Air To the wilderness I wander. </p>
 <p>(The idea was to keep the Scribe busy writing, so as to spring upon him. For, 
   while the Scribe talked, Choronzon had thrown sand into the circle, and filled 
   it up. But Choronzon could not think fast and continuously, and so resorted 
   to the device of quotation. </p>
 <p>The Scribe had written two or three words of "Tom o'Bedlam," when 
   Choronzon sprang within the circle (that part of the circumference of which 
   that was nearest to him he had been filling up with sand all this time), and 
   leaped upon the Scribe, throwing him to the earth. The conflict took place within 
   the circle. The Scribe called upon Tetragrammaton, and succeeded in compelling 
   Choronzon to return into his triangle. By dint of anger and of threatening him 
   with the Magick Staff did he accomplish this. He then repaired the circle. The 
   discomfited demon now continued:) </p>
 <p>All is dispersion. These are the qualities of things. </p>
 <p>The tenth Aethyr is the world of adjectives, and there is no substance therein. 
 </p>
 <p>(Now returneth the beautiful woman who had before tempted the Scribe. She prevailed 
   not.) </p>
 <p>I am afraid of sunset, for Tum is more terrible than Ra, and Khephra the Beetle 
   is greater than the Lion Mau. </p>
 <p>I am a-cold. </p>
 <p>(Here Choronzon wanted to leave the triangle to obtain wherewith to cover his 
   nakedness. The Scribe refused the request, threatening the demon. After a while 
   the latter continued:) </p>
 <p>I am commanded, why I know not, by him that speaketh. Were it thou, thou little 
   fool, I would tear thee limb from limb. I would bite off thine ears and nose 
   before I began with thee. I would take thy guts for fiddle- strings at the Black 
   Sabbath. </p>
 <p>Thou didst make a great fight there in the circle; thou art a goodly warrior! 
 </p>
 <p>(Then did the demon laugh loudly. The Scribe said: Thou canst not harm one 
   hair of my head.) </p>
 <p>I will pull out every hair of thy head, every hair of thy body, every hair 
   of thy soul, one by one. (Then said the Scribe: Thou hast no power.)</p>
 <p>Yea, verily I have power over thee, for thou hast taken the Oath, and art bound 
   unto the White Brothers, and therefore have I the power to torture thee so long 
   as thou shalt be. </p>
 <p>(Then said the Scribe unto him: Thou liest.) </p>
 <p>Ask of thy brother P. . . ., and he shall tell thee if I lie! </p>
 <p>(This the Scribe refused to do, saying that it was no concern of the demon's.) 
 </p>
 <p>I have prevailed against the Kingdom of the Father, and befouled his beard; 
   and I have prevailed against the Kingdom of the Son, and torn off his Phallus; 
   but against the Kingdom of the Holy Ghost shall I strive and not prevail. The 
   three slain doves are my threefold blasphemy against him; but their blood shall 
   make fertile the sand<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>, and I writhe 
   in blackness and horror of hate, and prevail not. </p>
 <p>(Then the demon tried to make the Scribe laugh at Magick, and to think that 
   it was all rubbish, that he might deny the names of God that he had invoked 
   to protect him; which, if he had doubted but for an instant, he had leapt upon 
   him, and gnawed through his spine at the neck. </p>
 <p>Choronzon succeed not in his design.) </p>
 <p>In this Aethyr is neither beginning nor end, for it is all hotch- potch, because 
   it is of the wicked on earth and the damned in hell. And so long as it be hotch-potch, 
   it mattereth little what may be written by the sea-green incorruptible Scribe. 
 </p>
 <p>The horror of it will be given in another place and time, and through another 
   Seer, and that Seer shall be slain as a result of his revealing. But the present 
   Seer, who is not P. . . ., seeth not the horror, because he is shut up, and 
   hath no name. </p>
 <p>(Now was there some further parleying betwixt the demon and the Scribe, concerning 
   the departure and the writing of the word, the Scribe not knowing if it were 
   meet that the demon should depart. </p>
 <p>Then the Seer took the Holy Ring, and wrote the name BABALON, that is victory 
   over Choronzon, and he was no more manifest.) </p>
 <p>(This cry was obtained on Dec. 6, 1909, between 2 and 4:15 p.m., in a lonely 
   valley of fine sand, in the desert near Bou-Sada. The Aethyr was edited and 
   revised on the following day.) </p>
 <p>After the conclusion of the Ceremony, a great fire was kindled to purify the 
   place, and the Circle and Triangle were destroyed. </p>
 <p><strong>NOTE BY SCRIBE</strong></p>
 <p>Almost from the beginning of the ceremony was the Scribe overshadowed, and 
   he spoke as it were in spite of himself, remembering afterwards scarcely a word 
   of his speeches, some of which were long and seemingly eloquent. </p>
 <p>All the time he had a sense of being protected from Choronzon, and this sense 
   of security prevented his knowing fear. </p>
 <p>Several times did the Scribe threaten to put a curse upon the demon; but ever, 
   before he uttered the words of the curse, did the demon obey him. For himself, 
   he knoweth not the words of the curse. </p>
 <p>Also is it meet to record in this place that the Scribe several times whistled 
   in a Magical manner, which never before had he attempted, and the demon was 
   apparently much discomforted thereat. </p>
 <p>Now knoweth the Scribe that he was wrong in holding much converse with the 
   demon; for Choronzon, in the confusion and chaos of his thought, is much terrified 
   by silence. And by silence can he be brought to obey. </p>
 <p>For cunningly doth he talk of many things, going from subject to subject, and 
   thus he misleadeth the wary into argument with him. And though Choronzon be 
   easily beaten in argument, yet, by disturbing the attention of him who would 
   command him, doth he gain the victory. </p>
 <p>For Choronzon feareth of all things concentration and silence: he therefore 
   who would command him should will in silence: thus is he brought to obey. </p>
 <p>This the Scribe knoweth; for that since the obtaining of the Accursed Tenth 
   Aethyr, he hath held converse with Choronzon. And unexpectedly did he obtain 
   the information he sought after having long refused to answer the demon's speeches. 
 </p>
 <p>Choronzon is dispersion; and such is his fear of concentration that he will 
   obey rather than be subjected to it, or even behold it in another. </p>
 <p>The account of the further dealings of Choronzon with the Scribe will be found 
   in the Record of Omnia Vincam. </p>

   <li><a name="1"></a><font size="2">Choronzon is described by Sir Edward Kelly 
     as "that mighty devil", as the first and deadliest of all the powers 
     of evil. Rightly so, for although he is not a person, he is the metaphysical 
     contrary of the whole Process of Magick.</font></li>
   <li><a name="2"></a><font size="2">The three Governors of this Aethyr, Lexarp, 
     Comanan, and Tabiton, are drawn from the "little Black Tablet" of 
     Spirit, which united the four watchtowers of the elements. (See <em>Equinox</em> 
     I, No. VII, Plate III; facing p. 234). The one extra letter, L, is the eighth 
     of the reversed letters beneath the bars of the Calvary Crosses in the watch-towers 
     to form trilateral names which designate malignant forces. These letters are 
     thus impurities introduced into the perfection of the Elementary Schema. (That 
     they should be attributed to the element of spirit, which harmonizes and sanctifies 
     the four, is a sublime mystery. The arcanum is declared --- as far as may 
     be --- in this book 418 itself). The other 7 letters form the name PARAOAN, 
     which is the central governor of the 22nd Aire; but here is a correspondence 
     with I, the center letter of LIN; this Aire discloses the glory of the Table 
     7 x 7, which is pure spirit, the rose which is the heart of Babalon.</font></li>
   <li><a name="3"></a><font size="2">ZAX = {Caput Draconis}{Taurus}{Spirit}. Z 
     is the Sun in His southern declination, i.e. at his weakest effect on an hemisphere. 
     Follows the Bull, the type of the "Dying Gods", and the element 
     of Earth. This letter X occurs only in this, the 15th and 30th Aires. In the 
     15th, water is the prima materia which is treated by being placed between 
     the pillars of judgement. In the 30th, it represents the reduction to mere 
     matter of the false structure of the Aeon of the false formula. Here X is 
     the basis, without constructive possibilities, of the universe; thus the whole 
     formula represents the weakening of the energy of the Sun, and the falling 
     into incoherent elements of all that is organized. </font></li>

   <li><a name="12"></a><font size="2">This (and many following assertions) must 
     not be taken as true. Choronzon is in no sense the master of anything. It 
     is the personification of a moral idea in a much more far-fetched way than 
     that in which we say "Venus is the Lady of Love". For one can imagine 
     Venus as a living individual being, while Choronzon is essentially not any 
     sort of person. </font></li>
   <li><a name="13"></a><font size="2">Various elements had been bound up into 
     a "bundle" by the energy of the Call, and thus constituted a momentary

     being, conscious that it is not a true organism, and threatened with immediate 
     dissolution, which in its rudimentary psychology it is bound to dread, is 
     of necessity, fear; and fear breeds pain, malice, and envy. Above all there 
     is an insane hatred for the supposed creator because the supposed blessing 
     of creation has been withheld from the "bundle".</font></li>
