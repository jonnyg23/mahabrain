 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 18th Aethyr,<br>
   Which is Called ZEN</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
 <p>A Voice comes before any vision: Accursed are they who enter herein if they 
   have nails, for they shall be pierced therewith; or if they have thorns, for 
   they shall be crowned withal; or if they have whips, for with whips they shall 
   be scourged: or if they bear wine, for their wine shall be turned to bitterness; 
   or if they have a spear, for with a spear shall they be pierced unto the heart. 
   And the nails are desires, of which there are three; the desire of light, the 
   desire of life, the desire of love<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>(And the thorns are thoughts, and the whips are regrets, and the wine is ease, 
   or perhaps unsteadiness, especially in ecstasy, and the spear is attachment.) 
 </p>
 <p>And now there dawns the scene of the Crucifixion; but the Crucified One is 
   an enormous bat, and for the two thieves are two little children. It is night, 
   and the night is full of hideous things and howlings<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>And an angel cometh forth, and saith: Be wary, for if thou change so much as 
   the style of a letter, the holy word is blasphemed<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>. 
   But enter into the mountain of the Caverns, for that this (how much more then 
   that Calvary which mocks it, as his ape mocks Thoth?) is but the empty shell 
   of the mystery of ZEN. Verily, I say unto thee, many are the adepts that have 
   looked upon the back parts of my father, and cried, "our eyes fail before 
   the glory of thy countenance<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>." </p>
 <p>And with that he gives the sign of the rending of the veil, and tears down 
   the vision. And behold! whirling columns of fiery light, seventy- two<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. Upon them is supported a mountain 
   of pure crystal. The mountain is a cone, the angle of the apex being sixty degrees<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. And within the 
   crystal is a pyramid of ruby<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>, like unto the Great Pyramid of 
   Gizeh. </p>
 <p>I am entered in by the little door thereof, and I am come into the chamber 
   of the king, which is fashioned like unto the vault of the adepts, or rather 
   it is fitting to say that the vault of the adepts is a vile imitation of it. 
   For there are four sides to the chamber, which with the roof and the floor and 
   the chamber itself makes seven<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. 
   So also is the pastos seven<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>, 
   for that which is within is like unto that which is without. And there is no 
   furniture, and there are no symbols. </p>
 <p>Light streams from every side upon the pastos. This light is that blue of Horus 
   which we know, but being refined it is brilliance. For the light of Horus only 
   appears blue because of the imperfection of our eyes<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. But though the 
   light pours from the pastos, yet the pastos remains perfectly dark, so that 
   it is invisible. It hath no form: only, at a certain point in the chamber, the 
   light is beaten back<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>I lie prostate upon the ground before this mystery. Its splendour is impossible 
   to describe. I can only say that its splendour is so great that my heart stops 
   with the terror and the wonder and the rapture of it<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. I am almost 
   mad. A million insane images chase each other through my brain...<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a> 
   A voice comes: (it is my own voice -- I did not know it). "When thou shalt 
   know me, O thou empty God, my little flame shall utterly expire in thy great 
   N.O.X.<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>" There is 
   no answer<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>. ... (20 
   minutes. O.V.) ... </p>
 <p>And now, after so long a while, the Angel<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a> lifts me and takes me from the 
   room<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>, and sets me 
   in a little chamber<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a> where is another Angel like a 
   fair youth in shining garments, who makes me partake of the sacraments; bread, 
   that is labour; and fire, that is wit; and a rose, that is sin; and wine, that 
   is death<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>. And all 
   about us is a great company of angels in many-coloured robes, rose and spring-green, 
   and sky-blue, and pale gold, and silver, and lilac, solemnly chanting without 
   words. It is music wonderful beyond all that can be thought. </p>
 <p>And now we go out of the chamber; on the right is a pylon, and the right figure 
   is Isis, and the left figure Nephthys, and they are folding their wings over, 
   and supporting Ra<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>I wanted to go back to the King's Chamber<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>. The Angel pushed me away, saying: 
   "Thou shalt see these visions from afar off, but thou shalt not partake 
   of them save in the manner prescribed. For if thou change so much as the style 
   of a letter, the holy word is blasphemed.<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>" </p>
 <p>And this is the manner prescribed: </p>
 <p>Let there be a room furnished as for the ritual of passing through Tuat<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>. 
   And let the aspirant be clad in the robes of, and let him bear the insignia 
   of his grade. And at the least he shall be a neophyte<a href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>Three days and three nights shall he have been in the tomb, vigilant and fasting, 
   for he shall sleep no longer than three hours at any one time, and he shall 
   drink pure water, and eat little sweet cakes consecrated unto the moon, and 
   fruits, and the eggs of the duck, or of the goose, or of the plover. And he 
   shall be shut in, so that no man may break in upon his meditation. But in the 
   last twelve hours he shall neither eat nor sleep. </p>
 <p>Then shall he break his fast, eating rich food, and drinking sweet wines, and 
   wines that foam<a href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>; and he shall banish the elements 
   and the planets and the signs and the sephiroth<a href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>; 
   and then shall he take the holy table that he hath made for his altar; and he 
   shall take the call of the Aethyr of which he will partake, which he hath written 
   in the angelic character, or in the character of the holy alphabet that is revealed 
   in Pop, upon a fair sheet of virgin vellum; and therewith shall he conjure the 
   Aethyr, chanting the call. And in the lamp that is hung above the altar shall 
   he burn the call that he hath written<a href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>Then shall he kneel<a href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a> 
   before the holy table, and it shall be given him to partake of the mystery of 
   the Aethyr. </p>
 <p>And concerning the ink with which he shall write; for the first Aethyr let 
   it be gold, for the second scarlet, for the third violet, for the fourth emerald, 
   for the fifth silver, for the sixth sapphire, for the seventh orange, for the 
   eighth indigo, for the ninth gray, for the tenth black, for the eleventh maroon, 
   for the twelfth russet, for the thirteenth green-gray, for the fourteenth amber, 
   for the fifteenth olive, for the sixteenth pale blue, for the seventeenth crimson, 
   for the eighteenth bright yellow, for the nineteenth crimson adorned with silver, 
   for the twentieth mauve, for the twenty-first pale green, for the twenty-second 
   rose-madder, for the twenty-third violet cobalt, for the twenty-fourth beetle-brown, 
   blue-brown colour, for the twenty-fifth a cold dark gray, for the twenty- sixth 
   white flecked with red, blue, and yellow; the edges of the letters shall be 
   green, for the twenty-seventh angry clouds of ruddy brown, for the twenty-eighth 
   indigo, for the twenty-ninth bluish-green, for the thirtieth mixed colours<a href="#30"><font size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>This shall be the form to be used by him who would partake of the mystery of 
   any Aethyr. And let him not change so much as the style of a letter, lest the 
   holy word be blasphemed. </p>
 <p>And let him beware, after he hath been permitted to partake of this mystery, 
   that he await the completion of the 91st hour of his retirement, before he open 
   the door of the place of his retirement; lest he contaminate his glory with 
   uncleanness, and lest they that behold him be smitten by his glory unto death<a href="#31"><font size="1"><strong>31</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>For this is a holy mystery, and he that did first attain to reveal the alphabet 
   thereof<a href="#32"><font size="1"><strong>32</strong></font></a>, perceived not one ten-thousandth 
   part of the fringe that is upon its vesture. </p>
 <p>Come away! for the clouds are gathered together, and the Aire heaveth like 
   the womb of a woman in travail. Come away! lest he loose the lightnings from 
   his hand, and unleash his hounds of thunder. Come away! For the voice of the 
   Aethyr is accomplished. Come away! For the seal of His loving-kindness is made 
   sure. And let there be praise and blessing unspeakable unto him that sitteth 
   upon the Holy Throne, for he casteth down mercies as a spendthrift that scattereth 
   gold. And he hath shut up judgment and hidden it away as a miser that hoardeth 
   coins of little worth<a href="#33"><font size="1"><strong>33</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>All this while the Angel hath been pushing me backwards, and now he is turned 
   into a golden cross with a rose at its heart, and that is the red cross wherein 
   is set the golden shewstone. </p>

     enclosure. This Aethyr describes the Place of the Preliminary Ceremony of 
     the Initiation of the Master of the Temple. The Candidate is fortified for 
     the Ordeal of Intimate Communion with his Holy Guardian Angel, who comes upon 
     him unaware, and prepares him interiorly below any normal sphere of consciousness.</font></li>

   <li><a name="11"></a><font size="2">Compare, in external nature, the appearance 
     of the blue sky.</font></li>
   <li><a name="12"></a><font size="2">This very strange phenomenon is perhaps 
     quite inadequately described. It is a general condition of most Spiritual 
     Experience that the familiar laws of Nature do not obtain in their accustomed 
     forms. It is only when Experience enables one to observe them with detachment 
     that they are seen to be as uniform, simple and exact as those of normal physics.</font></li>
   <li><a name="13"></a><font size="2">Compare with this unlighted, light-radiating 
     Pastos, the Boundless Cube in the Vision of Pure Love: "In the morning 
     I woke early, before 7, in an absolutely renewed physical condition. I had 
     the clean fresh feeling of a healthy boyhood, and was alert and active as 
     a kitten --- post talem mortem! Mentally, I woke into <em>Pure Love</em>. 
     This was symbolized as a cube* of blue-white light like a diamond of the best 
     quality. It was lucid, translucent, self-luminous, and yet not radiating forth. 
     I suppose because there was nothing else in the Cosmos." *. I say "a 
     cube", yet its most salient property was that it was without boundaries. 
     Experience of similar trances is necessary for the understanding of this statement, 
     which is a perfectly proper expression of a a perfectly observed fact, despite 
     its intellectual self-contradiction. This withdrawal from sense of the Pastos, 
     which is the Inmost and most sacred Self of the Aspirant, is the surrender 
     of "all that he has and all that he is" on entering the Abyss. </font></li>
   <li><a name="14"></a><font size="2">There is a fleeting Image of the Horror 
     of the Abyss, as a mountaineer, leaping a Bergschrund, obtains a momentary 
     glimpse of the Terrors beneath his airy Path. Cf. 10th Aire for these images 
     of madness.</font></li>
   <li><a name="15"></a><font size="2">This quotation is from <em>Liber VII</em> 
     I, v. 40. (This Book describes in detail the whole Attainment of the Grade 
     of Magister Templi. It had been given to the Seer, years previously; but he 
     had not understood it, even with his Neshamah, as a coherent entity. Nor does 
     he even yet (An XXI, {Sun} in {Cancer}) understand it with his Rauch. Incidentally 
     the full meaning of this Book 418, as a connected account of his Initiation, 
     is only now becoming clear to him in the process of writing this Commentary 
     upon it. For N.O.X., see Note above, 20th Aire. Observe that although the 
     Exempt Adept, or the Babe of the Abyss, is completely baffled by the circumstances, 
     and in no wise understands the situation, his Chiah, the Magician in him, 
     acts with sublime confidence and correctness.</font></li>
   <li><a name="16"></a><font size="2">The quotation, accepting annihilation, instantly 
     destroys the myriad of insane images which hastened to occupy the vacuum created 
     by the leap of the Exempt Adept into the Abyss. Had he faltered, he would 
     have become --- against his will --- a "Black Brother". But this 
     being involuntary, he would not have attempted to maintain his coherence, 
     as the Black Brothers do. He would therefore, have been destroyed at once; 
     that is, to outward appearance he would have become a demented babbler. Spiritists 
     present this phenomenon, on a much lower plane, and in a diluted form; though, 
     with them as with the average Theosophist, there is usually a certain degree 
     of obsession by pet phantoms --- a "Chinese Guide," or "Koot 
     Hoomi," or what not --- to lend a species of semi-organized structure 
     to the legions of disconnected ideas that throng their disintegrated gray 
     matter.</font></li>
   <li><a name="17"></a><font size="2">(No Angel has been mentioned. The Seer was 
     lost to being.) In this preliminary --- and so to say, symbolic --- crossing 
     of the Abyss, His Holy Guardian Angel comes to the rescue of the Aspirant. 
     Contrast the unspeakable Terror of the actual Crossing, when that Angel Himself 
     abandons the Seer (see 11th Aire, the last paragraph.) Exactly how the Angel 
     dealt with the Seer in this 20 minutes of earthly time is impossible to say; 
     for he has no memory soever --- nor had he even at the time --- of what took 
     place. We may, however, deduce from the fact that the Communion took place 
     in a sphere beyond even Neschamah. It may well have been a Quintessence of 
     Union sufficiently intimate to have identified the Seer with his Angel so 
     perfectly as to have given him the right to make the passage fully, in every 
     sense; and to have ensured his safety on the way. For the Angel cometh forth 
     from above the Abyss, and dwelleth of right in the Bosom of the Great Mother. 
     But the Angel deals not with the little pile of dust in the City of the Pyramids, 
     (see </font><a href="aetyr14.htm"><font size="2">14th Aethyr</font></a><font size="2">) but with the Star that is cast forth to give light 
     to the Earth. </font></li>
   <li><a name="18"></a><font size="2">This pyramid, where is the Pastos, is the 
     Chamber of Annihilation. The Pastos contains the Essence of the Aspirant, 
     and is in a Chamber containing the Essence of the Universe. This is all ready 
     to be burnt up in the Energy of Aspiration to the Creative Annihilation, the 
     Ruby Pyramid of Phallus. Finally, this Pyramid is within a Cone, a figure 
     combining the straight line and the circle (Rose and Cross in their purest 
     form) representing the new Universe into which the Old is to be transmuted. 
     It is established, like all types of Universe, upon the Four Elements (divided 
     into 72) which are the conditions of manifested Existence. (The elements are 
     not only "material"; they include categories like "Time", 
     "Space" and "Causality".)</font></li>
   <li><a name="19"></a><font size="2">This is the Birth-Chamber, where the Magister 
     Templi awakes from the Oblivion of the Abyss.</font></li>
   <li><a name="20"></a><font size="2">These sacraments furnish him with the material 
     of his new Life. Bread ({Spirit}) is labour, the nourishment of his being. 
     Fire is the perception of clear understanding (Neschamah). The Rose ({Air}) 
     is Sin, the restriction which prevents him from being dissolved in pure light 
     (Kether) for his Oath as a Master of the Temple is to deny himself the enjoyment 
     of that privilege, for the sake of the Love that he bears to Mankind; wherefore 
     is that Sin fragrant with the sent of love. Finally, Wine ({Water}) is Death, 
     the Ecstasy of transmuting all things into Joy by the Sacrament of Creative 
     Love.</font></li>
   <li><a name="21"></a><font size="2">Isis, Nature, and Nephthys, Perfection, 
     preside over the Arising of the New Star. The Magister Templi is a little 
     pyramid of dust in the City of the Pyramids (see 14th Aire) awaiting the Fire 
     that shall burn him up to a white Ash (see 6th Aire). But the original combination 
     of Sankharas (tendencies --- the elements of the Character of the Man) is 
     void of the Ego. Ahamkara (the ego-making faculty) has been assimilated. The 
     Sankharas are, however, still linked by the Karma of the Adept; for they had 
     to be most strongly knit by him that he might be able to concentrate their 
     whole Energies upon the Great Work of abandoning in a single gesture "all 
     that he has and all that he is". They accordingly hold together: His 
     Will has been accomplished, and he is free from them; but they depend upon 
     the Elements which compose that true Will, which, <em>since he has succeeded</em>, 
     can only be that Sublime Passion for Mankind, to help it to "Conquer 
     Space, and lastly climb the walls of Time, and by the Golden Path the great 
     have trod, Reach up to God." A phenomenon of this nature thus appears 
     "as a morning star, or as an evening star, to give light to them that 
     sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death". This is then the man himself, 
     save that his separate individuality is no longer present; it is replaced 
     by this single passion to rescue mankind. </font></li>
   <li><a name="22"></a><font size="2">The Seer's first impulse was to proceed 
     with the Work on which he had been engaged when the Dissolution of his Being 
     took place.</font></li>
   <li><a name="23"></a><font size="2">As stated in a previous Aire, these higher 
     visions are not to be obtained by the methods applicable to less exalted spheres.</font></li>
   <li><a name="24"></a><font size="2">See the Book of the Dead, as adopted for 
     modern use by the Authorities of the G{.·.} D{.·.}</font></li>
   <li><a name="25"></a><font size="2">He must be a neophyte to have access to 
     the Ritual of Passing Through the Tuat.</font></li>
   <li><a name="26"></a><font size="2">See <em>Liber AL</em>, I. v. 51. The general 
     idea is to create true appetite in a body purified by fasting and a mind clarified 
     by meditation, so as to make certain of being perfectly intoxicated. It should 
     be needless to say that this state of mind, like all others, should be absolutely 
     willed, criticized and controlled. </font></li>
   <li><a name="27"></a><font size="2">The Aethyrs pertain to an order of nature, 
     <em>sui generis</em>. Though they possess many correspondences with the 32 
     Paths of Wisdom, all of these must be impartially banished; otherwise the 
     Vacuum would be disturbed by an unequilibrated symbol sympathetic with the 
     Aire to be invoked, which would flood the circle, and prevent the Aethyr arising 
     in its perfect plenitude.</font></li>
   <li><a name="28"></a><font size="2">This injunction has several obvious Magical 
     advantages. The symbolic gesture is to consume the matter of the Operation 
     in the Spirit thereof.</font></li>
   <li><a name="29"></a><font size="2">This is by no means a gesture of supplication, 
     the vile attitude of the unmanly devotee of the Slave-Gods. It has as specific 
     and positive practical purpose, which should be easy for the Neophyte to divine 
     if his Zelator have well and wisely so instructed him.</font></li>

   <li><a name="31"></a><font size="2">This injunction is to be taken very seriously. 
     I have known uninitiates made ill by the shock of seeing Adepts of too high 
     "residual charge"; worse, thrown off their moral balance.</font></li>
   <li><a name="32"></a><font size="2">Presumably Sir Edward Kelly. There is certainly 
     no hint of the sublimity and profundity of such visions as the present series 
     in the working of that adept.</font></li>
   <li><a name="33"></a><font size="2">This peroration suggests that early working 
     by its style. It has little definite thought contained in it; the sublimity 
     of the language ill conceals its vagueness. Nevertheless, it is a fitting 
     conclusion to the mystery of this Aire. The ritual, and its lyrical outburst, 
     were doubtless necessary to let the seer down gently from the colossal exaltation 
     of the central event of the Aethyr. </font></li>
