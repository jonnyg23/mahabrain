 <p>AN EPISTLE OF BAPHOMET to the Illustrious Dame Anna Wright, Companion of the 
   Holy Graal, shining like the moon, concerning Death, that she and her sisters 
   may bring comfort to all them that are nigh death, and unto such as love them.</p>
 <p>Beloved Daughter and Sister,</p>
 <p align="center">Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
 <p>Let it be thy will and the will of all them that tend upon the sick, to comfort 
   and to fortify them with these words following.</p>
 <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>I</strong></font></p>
 <p>IT IS WRITTEN in The Book of the Law: Every man and every woman is a Star. 
   It is Our Lady of the Stars that speaketh to thee, O thou that art a star, a 
   member of the Body of Nuith! Listen, for thine ears become dulled to the mean 
   noises of the earth; the infinite silence of the Stars woos thee with subtile 
   musick. Behold her bending down above thee, a flame of blue, all-touching, all-penetrant, 
   her lovely hands upon the black earth, and her lithe body arched for love, and 
   her soft feet not hurting the little flowers, and think that all thy grossness 
   shall presently fall from thee as thou leapest to her embrace, caught up into 
   her love as a dewdrop into the kisses of the sunrise. Is not the ecstasy of 
   Nuit the consciousness of the continuity of existence, the omnipresence of her 
   body? All that hath hurt thee was that thou knewest it not, and as that fadeth 
   from thee thou shalt know as never yet how all is one. Again She saith: I give 
   unimaginable joys upon earth, certainty, not faith, while in life, upon death. 
   This thou hast known. Time that eateth his children hath not power on them that 
   would not be children of Time. To them that think themselves immortal, that 
   dwell alway in eternity, conscious of Nuit, throned upon the chariot of the 
   sun, there is no death that men call death. In all the universe darkness is 
   only to be found in the shadow of a gross and opaque planet, as it were for 
   a moment; the universe itself is a flood of light eternal. So also death is 
   but through accident; thou hast hidden thyself in the shadow of thy gross body, 
   and taking it for reality, thou hast trembled. But the orb revolveth anon; the 
   shadow passeth away from thee. There is the dissolution, and the eternal ecstasy 
   in the kisses of Nu! For inasmuch as thou hast made the Law of Freedom thine, 
   as thou hast lived in Light and Liberty and Love, thou hast become a Free-man 
   of the City of the Stars.</p>
 <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>II</strong></font></p>
 <p>LISTEN AGAIN to thine own voice within thee. Is not Hadit the flame that burns 
   in every heart of man, and in the core of every star? Is not He Life, and the 
   giver of Life? And is not therefore the knowledge of Him the knowledge of Death? 
   For it hath been shown unto thee in many other places how Death and Love be 
   twins. Now art thou the hunter, and Death rideth beside thee with his horse 
   and spear as thou chasest thy Will through the forests of Eternity, whose trees 
   are the hair of Nuit thy mistress! Thrill with the joy of life and death! Know, 
   hunter mighty and swift, the quarry turns to bay! Thou hast but to make one 
   sharp thrust, and thou hast won. The Virgin of Eternity lies supine at thy mercy, 
   and thou art Pan! Thy death shall be the seal of the promise of our agelong 
   love. Hast thou not striven to the inmost in thee? Death is the crown of all. 
   Harden! Hold up thyself! Lift thine head! breathe not so deep--die!</p>
 <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>III</strong></font></p>
 <p>OR ART THOU STILL ENTANGLED with the thorny plaits of wild briar rose that 
   thou hast woven in thy magick dance on earth? Art not thine eyes strong enough 
   to bear the starlight? Must thou linger yet awhile in the valley? Must thou 
   dally with the shadows in the dusk? Then if it be Thy Will, thou hast no right 
   but to do Thy Will! Love still these phantoms of the earth; thou hast made thyself 
   a King; if it please thee to play with toys of matter, were they not made to 
   serve thy pleasure? Then follow in thy mind the wondrous word of the Steele 
   of Revealing itself. Return if thou wilt from the abode of the Stars; dwell 
   with mortality, and feast thereon. For thou art this day Lord of Heaven and 
   of Earth.</p>
 <p>``The dead man Ankh-f-na-Khonsu</p>
 <p>Saith with his voice of truth and calm:</p>
 <p>O thou that hast a single arm!</p>
 <p>O thou that glitterest in the moon!</p>
 <p>I weave thee in the spinning charm</p>
 <p>I lure thee with the billowy tune.</p>
 <p>The dead man Ankh-f-na-Khonsu</p>
 <p>Hath parted from the darkling crowds</p>
 <p>Hath joined the dwellers of the light</p>
 <p>Opening Duant, the star-abodes,</p>
 <p>Their keys receiving.</p>
 <p>The dead man Ankh-f-na-Khonsu</p>
 <p>Hath made his passage into night</p>
 <p>His pleasure on the earth to do</p>
 <p>Among the living.''</p>
 <p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
 <p>The Benediction of the All-Begetter, All-Devourer be upon thee.</p>
 <p>Baphomet X° O.T.O.</p>
 <p>Given under Our hand and seal this day of An XII the Sun our Father being in 
   Leo, and the Moon in Pisces, from the throne of Ireland, Iona and all the Britains 
   that is in the Sanctuary of the Gnosis. </p>
