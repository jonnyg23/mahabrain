   <strong>MMM. "I remember a certain holy day in the dusk of the Year, in 
   the dusk of the Equinox of Osiris, when first I beheld thee visibly; when first 
   the dreadful issue was fought out; when the Ibis-headed One charmed away the 
   strife. I remember thy first kiss, even as a maiden should. Nor in the dark 
   byways was there another: thy kisses abide." --- <cite>LIBER LAPIDIS LAZULI</cite>. 
   VII. 15. 16.</strong></p>
 <ol>
   <li>0. Be seated in thine Asana, wearing the robe of a Neophyte, the hood drawn. 
   </li>
   <li value="1">It is night, heavy and hot, there are no stars. Not one breath 
     of wind stirs the surface of the sea, that is thou. No fish play in thy depths. 
   </li>
   <li>Let a Breath rise and ruffle the waters. This also thou shalt feel playing 
     upon thy skin. It will disturb thy meditation twice or thrice, after which 
     thou shouldst have conquered this distraction. But unless thou first feel 
     it, that Breath hath not arisen. </li>
   <li>Next, the night is riven by the lightning flash. This also shalt thou feel 
     in thy body, which shall shiver and leap with the shock, and that also must 
     both be suffered and overcome. </li>
   <li>After the lightning flash, resteth in the zenith a minute point of light. 
     And that light shall radiate until a right cone be established upon the sea, 
     and it is day.<br>
     With this thy body shall be rigid, automatically; and this shalt thou let 
     endure, withdrawing thyself into thine heart in the form of an upright Egg 
     of blackness; and therein shalt thou abide for a space. </li>
   <li>When all this is perfectly and easily performed at will, let the aspirant 
     figure to himself a struggle with the whole force of the Universe. In this 
     he is only saved by his minuteness. But in the end he is overcome by Death, 
     who covers him with a black cross.<br>
     Let his body fall supine with arms outstretched. </li>
   <li>So lying, let him aspire fervently unto the Holy Guardian Angel. </li>
   <li>Now let him resume his former posture.<br>
     Two and twenty times shall he figure to himself that he is bitten by a serpent, 
     feeling even in his body the poison thereof. And let each bite be healed by 
     an eagle or hawk, spreading its wings above his head, and dropping thereupon 
     a healing dew. But let the last bite be so terrible a pang at the nape of 
     the neck that he seemeth to die, and let the healing dew be of such virtue 
     that he leapeth to his feet. </li>
   <li>Let there be now placed within his egg a red cross, then a green cross, 
     then a golden cross, then a silver cross; or those things which these shadow 
     forth. Herein is silence; for he that hath rightly performed the meditation 
     will understand the inner meaning hereof, and it shall serve as a test of 
     himself and his fellows. </li>
   <li>Let him now remain in the Pyramid or Cone of Light, as an Egg, but no more 
     of blackness. </li>
   <li>Then let his body be in the position of the Hanged Man, and let him aspire 
     with all his force unto the Holy Guardian Angel. </li>
   <li>The grace having been granted unto him, let him partake mystically of the 
     Eucharist of the Five Elements and let him proclaim Light in Extension; yea, 
     let him proclaim Light in Extension. </li>

   <strong>AAA "These loosen the swathings of the corpse; these unbind the 
   feet of Osiris, so that the flaming God may rage through the firmament with 
   his fantastic spear." <cite>Liber Lapidis Lazuli.</cite> VII. 3.</strong></p>
 <ol>
   <li>0. Be seated in thine Asana, or recumbent in Shavasana, or in the position 
     of the dying Buddha. </li>
   <li value="1">Think of thy death; imagine the various diseases that may attack 
     thee, or accidents overtake thee. Picture the process of death, applying always 
     to thyself.<br>
     (A useful preliminary practice is to read textbooks of Pathology, and to visit 
     museums and dissecting-rooms.) </li>
   <li>Continue this practice until death is complete; follow the corpse through 
     the stages of embalming, wrapping and burial. </li>
   <li>Now imagine a divine breath entering thy nostrils. </li>
   <li>Next, imagine a divine light enlightening the eyes. </li>
   <li>Next, imagine the divine voice awakening the ears. </li>
   <li>Next, imagine a divine kiss imprinted on the lips. </li>
   <li>Next, imagine the divine energy informing the nerves and muscles of the 
     body, and concentrate on the phenomenon which will already have been observed 
     in 3, the restoring of the circulation. </li>
   <li>Last, imagine the return of the reproductive power, and employ this to the 
     impregnation of the Egg of light in which man is bathed. </li>
   <li>Now represent to thyself that this Egg is the Disk of the Sun, setting in 
     the west. </li>
   <li>Let it sink into blackness, borne in the bark of heaven, upon the back of 
     the holy cow Hathor. And it may be that thou shalt hear the moaning thereof. 
   </li>
   <li>Let it become blacker than all blackness. And in this meditation thou shalt 
     be utterly without fear, for that the blankness that will appear unto thee 
     is a thing dreadful beyond all thy comprehension.<br>
     And it shall come to pass that if thou hast well and properly performed this 
     meditation that on a sudden thou shalt hear the drone and booming of a Beetle. 
   </li>
   <li>Now then shall the Blackness pass, and with rose and gold shalt thou arise 
     in the East, with the cry of an Hawk resounding in thine ear. Shrill shall 
     it be and harsh. </li>
   <li>At the end shalt thou rise and stand in the mid-heaven, a globe of glory. 
     And therewith shall arise the mighty Sound that holy men have likened unto 
     the roaring of a Lion. </li>
   <li>Then shalt thou withdraw thyself from the Vision, gathering thyself into 
     the divine form of Osiris upon his throne. </li>
   <li>Then shalt thou repeat audibly the cry of triumph of the god re-arisen, 
     as it shall have been given unto thee by thy Superior. </li>
   <li>And this being accomplished, thou mayest enter again into the Vision, that 
     thereby shall be perfected in Thee. </li>
   <li>After this shalt thou return into the Body, and give thanks unto the Most 
     High God IAIDA, yea unto the Most High God IAIDA. </li>
   <li>Mark well that this operation should be performed if it be possible in a 
     place set apart and consecrated to the Works of the Magick of Light. Also 
     that the Temple should be ceremonially open as thou hast knowledge and skill 
     to perform, and that at the end thereof the closing should be most carefully 
     accomplished. But in the preliminary practice it is enough to cleanse thyself 
     by ablution, by robing, and by the rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram.<br>
     0-2 should be practised at first, until some realisation is obtained; and 
     the practice should always be followed by a divine invocation of Apollo or 
     of Isis or of Jupiter or of Serapis.<br>
     Next, after a swift summary of 0-2 practice 3-7.<br>
     This being mastered, add 8.<br>
     Then add 9-13.<br>
     Then being prepared and fortified, well fitted for the work, perform the whole 
     meditation at one time. And let this be continued until perfect success be 
     attained therein. For this is a mighty meditation and holy, having power even 
     upon Death, yea, having power even upon Death.<br>
     (Note by Fra. O.M. At any time during this meditation the concentration may 
     bring about Samadhi. This is to be feared and shunned, more than any other 
     breaking of control, for that it is the most tremendous of the forces which 
     threaten to obsess. There is also some danger of acute delirious melancholia 
     at point 1.) </li>

   <strong>SSS "Thou art a beautiful thing, whiter than a woman in the column 
   of this vibration.<br>
   "I shoot up vertically like an arrow, and become that Above.<br>
   "But it is death, and the flame of the pyre.<br>
   "Ascend in the flame of the pyre, O my Soul!<br>
   "Thy God is like the cold emptiness of the utmost heaven, into which thou 
   radiatest thy little light.<br>
   "When Thou shalt know me, O empty God, my flame shall utterly expire in 
   thy great N.O.X." <cite>Liber Lapidis Lazuli.</cite> I. 36-40.</strong></p>
 <ol>
   <li>0. Be seated in thine Asana, preferably the Thunderbolt.<br>
     It is essential that the spine be vertical. </li>
   <li value="1">In this practice the cavity of the brain is the Yoni; the spinal 
     cord is the Lingam. </li>
   <li>Concentrate thy thought of adoration in the brain. </li>
   <li>Now begin to awaken the spine in this manner. Concentrate thy thought of 
     thyself in the base of the spine, and move it gradually up a little at a time.<br>
     By this means thou wilt become conscious of the spine, feeling each vertebra 
     as a separate entity. This must be achieved most fully and perfectly before 
     the further practice is begun. </li>
   <li>Next, adore the brain as before, but figure to thyself its content as infinite. 
     Deem it to be the womb of Isis, or the body of Nuit. </li>
   <li>Next, identify thyself with the base of the spine as before, but figure 
     to thyself its energy as infinite. Deem it to be the phallus of Osiris or 
     the being of Hadit. </li>
   <li>These two concentrations 4 and 5 may be pushed to the point of Samadhi. 
     Yet lose not control of the will; let not Samadhi be thy master herein. </li>
   <li>Now then, being conscious both of the brain and the spine, and unconscious 
     of all else, do thou imagine the hunger of the one for the other; the emptiness 
     of the brain, the ache of the spine, even as the emptiness of space and the 
     aimlessness of Matter.<br>
     And if thou hast experience of the Eucharist in both kinds, it shall aid thine 
     imagination herein. </li>
   <li>Let this agony grow until it be insupportable, resisting by will every temptation. 
     Not until thine whole body is bathed in sweat, or it may be in sweat of blood, 
     and until a cry of intolerable anguish is forced from thy closed lips, shalt 
     thou proceed. </li>
   <li>Now let a current of light, deep azure flecked with scarlet, pass up and 
     down the spine, striking as it were upon thyself that art coiled at the base 
     as a serpent.<br>
     Let this be exceedingly slow and subtle; and though it be accompanied with 
     pleasure, resist; and though it be accompanied with pain, resist. </li>
   <li>This shalt thou continue until thou art exhausted, never relaxing the control. 
     Until thou canst perform this one section 9 during a whole hour, proceed not. 
     And withdraw from the meditation by an act of will, passing into a gentle 
     Pranayama without Kumbhakham, and meditating on Harpocrates, the silent and 
     virginal God. </li>
   <li>Then at last, being well-fitted in body and mind, fixed in peace, beneath 
     a favourable heaven of stars, at night, in calm and warm weather, mayst thou 
     quicken the movement of the light until it be taken up by the brain and the 
     spine, independently of thy will. </li>
   <li>If in this hour thou shouldst die, is it not written, "Blessed are 
     the dead that die in the Lord"? Yea, Blessed are the dead that die in 
     the Lord! 
 </li></ol>
