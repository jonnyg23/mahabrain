 <h2 class="title" align="center">CHAPTER III<br>
   THE FORMULA OF TETRAGRAMMATON.</h2>
 <blockquote><em>Yod, He, Vau, He, the Ineffable Name (Jehovah) of the Hebrews. 
   The four letters refer respectively to the four "elements", Fire, Water, Air, 
   Earth, in the order named.</em></blockquote>
 This formula is of most universal aspect, as all things are necessarily comprehended 
 in it; but its use in a magical ceremony is little understood.
 <p> The climax of the formula is in one sense before even the formulation of the 
   Yod. For the Yod is the most divine aspect of the Force --- the remaining letters 
   are but a solidification of the same thing. It must be understood that we are 
   here speaking of the whole ceremony considered as a unity, not merely of that 
   formula in which "Yod" is the god invoked, "He" the Archangel, and so on. In 
   order to understand the ceremony under this formula, we must take a more extended 
   view of the functions of the four weapons than we have hitherto done. 
 </p><p> The formation of the "Yod" is the formulation of the first creative force, 
   of that father who is called "self-begotten", and unto whom it is said: "Thou 
   has formulated thy Father, and made fertile thy Mother". The adding of the "He" 
   to the "Yod" is the marriage of that Father to the great co-equal Mother, who 
   is a reflection of Nuit as He is of Hadit. Their union brings forth the son 
   "Vau" who is the heir. Finally the daughter "He" is produced. She is both the 
   twin sister and the daughter of "Vau". 
 </p><blockquote><em>There is a further mystery herein, far deeper, for initiates.</em></blockquote>
 His mission is to redeem her by making her his bride; the result of this is to 
 set her upon the throne of her mother, and it is only she whose youthful embrace 
 can reawaken the eld of the All-Father. In this complex family relationship 
 <blockquote><em>The formula of Tetragrammaton, as ordinarily understood, ending 
   with the appearance of the daughter, is indeed a degradation.</em></blockquote>
 is symbolised the whole course of the Universe. It will be seen that (after all) 
 the Climax is at the end. It is the second half of the formula which symbolises 
 the Great Work which we are pledged to accomplish. The first step of this is the 
 attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, which 
 constitutes the Adept of the Inner Order. The re-entry of these twin spouses into 
 the womb of the mother is that initiation described in Liber 418, which gives 
 admission to the Inmost Order of the A.'. A.'. Of the last step we cannot speak. 
 <p> It will now be recognised that to devise a practical magical ceremony to correspond 
   to Tetragrammaton in this exalted sense might be difficult if not impossible. 
   In such a ceremony the Rituals of purification alone might occupy many incarnations. 
 </p><p> It will be necessary, therefore, to revert to the simpler view of Tetragrammaton, 
   remembering only that the "He" final is the Throne of the Spirit, of the Shin 
   of Pentagrammaton. 
 </p><p> The Yod will represent a swift and violent creative energy; following this 
   will be a calmer and more reflective but even more powerful flow of will, the 
   irresistible force of a mighty river. This state of mind will be followed by 
   an expansion of the consciousness; it will penetrate all space, and this will 
   finally undergo a crystallization resplendent with interior light. Such modifications 
   of the original Will may be observed in the course of the invocations when they 
   are properly performed. 
 </p><p> The peculiar dangers of each are obvious --- that of the first is a flash 
   in the pan --- a misfire; that of the second, a falling into dreaminess or reverie; 
   that of the third, loss of concentration. A mistake in any of these points will 
   prevent, or injure the proper formation of, the fourth. 
 </p><p> In the expression which will be used in Chapter XV: "Enflame thyself", etc., 
   only the first stage is specified; but if that is properly done the other stages 
   will follow as if by necessity. So far is it written concerning the formula 
   of Tetragrammaton.
