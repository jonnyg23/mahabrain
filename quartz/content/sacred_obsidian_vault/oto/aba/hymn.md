 <cite>SOPH. AJ.</cite> 
 <p> <strong>Thrill with lissome lust of the light,<br>
   O man! My man!<br>
   Come careering out of the night<br>
   Of Pan! Io Pan!<br>
   Io Pan! Io Pan! Come over the sea<br>
   From Sicily and from Arcady!<br>
   Roaming as Bacchus, with fauns and pards<br>
   And nymphs and satyrs for thy guards,<br>
   On a milk-white ass, come over the sea<br>
   To me, to me,<br>
   Come with Apollo in bridal dress<br>
   (Shepherdess and pythoness)<br>
   Come with Artemis, silken shod,<br>
   And wash thy white thigh, beautiful God,<br>
   In the moon of the woods, on the marble mount,<br>
   The dimpled dawn of the amber fount!<br>
   Dip the purple of passionate prayer<br>
   In the crimson shrine, the scarlet snare,<br>
   The soul that startles in eyes of blue<br>
   To watch thy wantonness weeping through<br>
   The tangled grove, the gnarled bole<br>
   Of the living tree that is spirit and soul<br>
   And body and brain --- come over the sea,<br>
   (Io Pan! Io Pan!)<br>
   Devil or god, to me, to me,<br>
   My man! my man!<br>
   Come with trumpets sounding shrill<br>
   Over the hill!<br>
   Come with drums low muttering<br>
   From the spring!<br>
   Come with flute and come with pipe!<br>
   Am I not ripe?<br>
   I, who wait and writhe and wrestle<br>
   With air that hath no boughs to nestle<br>
   My body, weary of empty clasp,<br>
   Strong as a lion and sharp as an asp ---<br>
   Come, O come!<br>
   I am numb<br>
   With the lonely lust of devildom.<br>
   Thrust the sword through the galling fetter,<br>
   All-devourer, all-begetter;<br>
   Give me the sign of the Open Eye,<br>
   And the token erect of thorny thigh,<br>
   And the word of madness and mystery,<br>
   O Pan! Io Pan!<br>
   Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! Pan Pan! Pan,<br>
   I am a man:<br>
   Do as thou wilt, as a great god can,<br>
   O Pan! Io Pan!<br>
   Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! I am awake<br>
   In the grip of the snake.<br>
   The eagle slashes with beak and claw;<br>
   The gods withdraw:<br>
   The great beasts come, Io Pan! I am borne<br>
   To death on the horn<br>
   Of the Unicorn.<br>
   I am Pan! Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! Pan!<br>
   I am thy mate, I am thy man,<br>
   Goat of thy flock, I am gold, I am god,<br>
   Flesh to thy bone, flower to thy rod.<br>
   With hoofs of steel I race on the rocks<br>
   Through solstice stubborn to equinox.<br>
   And I rave; and I rape and I rip and I rend<br>
   Everlasting, world without end,<br>
   Mannikin, maiden, Maenad, man,<br>
   In the might of Pan.<br>
   Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! Pan! Io Pan!<br>
