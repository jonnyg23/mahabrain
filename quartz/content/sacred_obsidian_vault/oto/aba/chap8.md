 <h2 class="title" align="center">CHAPTER VIII<br>
   OF EQUILIBRIUM, AND OF THE GENERAL AND PARTICULAR METHOD OF PREPARATION OF THE 
   FURNITURE OF THE TEMPLE AND OF THE INSTRUMENTS OF ART.</h2>
 <h3 align="center">I</h3>
 "Before there was equilibrium, countenance beheld not countenance." 
 <blockquote><em>The full significance of this aphorism is an Arcanum of the grade 
   of Ipsissimus. It may, however, be partially apprehended by study of Liber Aleph, 
   and the Book of the Law and the Commentaries thereon. It explains Existence.</em></blockquote>
 So sayeth the holiest of the Books of the ancient Qabalah. (Siphra Tzeniutha 1. 
 2.) One countenance here spoken of is the Macrocosm, the other the Microcosm. 
 <blockquote><em>This is the case because we happen ourselves to be Microcosms 
   whose Law is "love under will". But it is also Magick for an unit which has 
   attained Perfection (in absolute nothingness, 0 Degree), to become "divided 
   for love's sake, for the chance of union".</em></blockquote>
 As said above, the object of any magick ceremony is to unite the Macrocosm and 
 the Microcosm. 
 <p> It is as in optics; the angles of incidence and reflection are equal. You 
   must get your Macrocosm and Microcosm exactly balanced, vertically and horizontally, 
   or the images will not coincide. 
 </p><p> This equilibrium is affirmed by the magician in arranging the Temple. Nothing 
   must be lop-sided. If you have anything in the North, you must put something 
   equal and opposite to it in the South. The importance of this is so great, and 
   the truth of it so obvious, that no one with the most mediocre capacity for 
   magick can tolerate any unbalanced object for a moment. His instinct instantly 
   revolts. 
 </p><blockquote><em>This is because the essence of his being a Magician is his intuitive 
   apprehension of the fundamental principles of the Universe. His instinct is 
   a subconscious assertion of the structural identity of the Macrocosm and the 
   Microcosm. Equilibrium is the condition of manifested existence.</em></blockquote>
 . For this reason the weapons, altar, circle, and magus are all carefully proportioned 
 one with another. It will not do to have a cup like a thimble and a wand like 
 a weaver's beam. 
 <blockquote><em>See Bagh-i-Muattar, V, par. 2.</em></blockquote>
 Again, the arrangement of the weapons of the altar must be such that they "look" 
 balanced. Nor should the magician have any unbalanced ornament. If he have the 
 wand in his right hand, let him have the Ring 
 <blockquote><em>The Ring has not been described in Part II of this book, for reasons 
   which may be or may not be apparent to the reader. It is the symbol of Nuit, 
   the totality of the possible ways in which he may represent himself and fulfill 
   himself.</em></blockquote>
 on his left, or let him take the Ankh, or the Bell, or the Cup. And however little 
 he move to the right, let him balance it by an equivalent movement to the left; 
 or if forwards, backwards; and let him correct each idea by implying the contradictory 
 contained therein. If he invoke Severity, let him recount that Severity is the 
 instrument of Mercy; 
 <blockquote><em>For example, as when Firmness with one's self or another is the 
   truest kindness; or when amputation saves life.</em></blockquote>
 if Stability, let him show the basis of that Stability to be constant change, 
 just as the stability of a molecule is secured by the momentum of the swift atoms 
 contained in it. 
 <blockquote><em>See Liber 418, 11th Aethyr.</em></blockquote>
 In this way let every idea go forth as a triangle on the base of two opposites, 
 making an apex transcending their contradiction in a higher harmony. 
 <p> It is not safe to use any thought in Magick, unless that thought has been 
   thus equilibrated and destroyed. 
 </p><p> Thus again with the instruments themselves; the Wand must be ready to change 
   into a Serpent, the Pantacle into the whirling Svastika or Disk of Jove, as 
   if to fulfil the functions of the Sword. The Cross is both the death of the 
   "Saviour" 
 </p><blockquote><em>It is the extension in matter of the Individual Self, the Indivisible 
   Point determined by reference to the Four Quarters. This is the formula which 
   enables it to express its Secret Self; its dew falling upon the Rose is developed 
   into an Eidolon of Itself, in due season.</em></blockquote>
 and the Phallic symbol of Resurrection. Will itself must be ready to culminate 
 in the surrender of that Will: 
 <blockquote><em>See Liber LXV and Liber VII.</em></blockquote>
 the aspiration's arrow that is shot against the Holy Dove must transmute itself 
 into the wondering Virgin that receives in her womb the quickening of that same 
 Spirit of God. 
 <p> Any idea that is thus in itself positive and negative, active and passive, 
   male and female, is fit to exist above the Abyss; any idea not so equilibrated 
   is below the Abyss, contains in itself an unmitigated duality or falsehood, 
   and is to that extent qliphotic 
 </p><blockquote><em>See The Qabalah for the use of this word, and study the doctrine 
   concerning the Kings of Edom.</em></blockquote>
 and dangerous. Even an idea like "truth" is unsafe unless it is realized that 
 all Truth is in one sense falsehood. For all Truth is relative; and if it be supposed 
 absolute, will mislead. 
 <blockquote><em>See Poincare for the mathematical proof of this thesis. But Spiritual 
   Experience goes yet deeper, and destroys the Canon of the Law of Contradiction. 
   There is an immense amount of work by the Master Therion on this subject; it 
   pertains especially to His grade of 9 Degree = 2Square. Such profundities are 
   unsuited to the Student, and may unsettle him seriously. It will be best for 
   him to consider (provisionally) Truth in the sense in which it is taken by Physical 
   Science.</em></blockquote>
 "The Book of Lies falsely so called" (Liber 333) is worthy of close and careful 
 study in this respect. The reader should also consult Konx Om Pax, "Introduction", 
 and "Thien Tao" in the same volume. 
 <p> All this is to be expressed in the words of the ritual itself, and symbolised 
   in every act performed. 
 </p><h3 align="center">II</h3>
 It is said in the ancient books of Magick that everything used by the Magician 
 must be "virgin". That is: it must never have been used by any other person or 
 for any other purpose. The greatest importance was attached by the Adepts of old 
 to this, and it made the task of the Magician no easy one. He wanted a wand; and 
 in order to cut and trim it he needed a knife. It was not sufficient merely to 
 buy a new knife; he felt that he had to make it himself. In order to make the 
 knife, he would require a hundred other things, the acquisition of each of which 
 might require a hundred more; and so on. This shows the impossibility of disentangling 
 one's self from one's environment. Even in Magick we cannot get on without the 
 help of others. 
 <blockquote><em>It is, and the fact is still more important, utterly fatal and 
   demoralizing to acquire the habit of reliance on others. The Magician must know 
   every detail of his work, and be able and willing to roll up his shirtsleeves 
   and do it, no matter how trivial or menial it may seem. Abramelin (it is true) 
   forbids the Aspirant to perform any tasks of an humiliating type; but he will 
   never be able to command perfect service unless he has experience of such necessary 
   work, mastered during his early training.</em></blockquote>
 There was, however, a further object in this recommendation. The more trouble 
 and difficulty your weapon costs, the more useful you will find it. "If you want 
 a thing well done, do it yourself." It would be quite useless to take this book 
 to a department store, and instruct them to furnish you a Temple according to 
 specification. It is really worth the while of the Student who requires a sword 
 to go and dig out iron ore from the earth, to smelt it himself with charcoal that 
 he has himself prepared, to forge the weapon with his own hand: and even to take 
 the trouble of synthesizing the oil of virtiol with which it is engraved. He will 
 have learnt a lot of useful things in his attempt to make a really virgin sword; 
 he will understand how one thing depends upon another; he will begin to appreciate 
 the meaning of the words "the harmony of the Universe", so often used so stupidly 
 and superficially by the ordinary apologist for Nature, and he will also perceive 
 the true operation of the law of Karma. 
 <blockquote><em>In this sense especially: any one thing involves, and is involved 
   in, others apparently altogether alien.</em></blockquote>
 Another notable injunction of the ancient Magick was that whatever appertained 
 to the Work should be "single". The Wand was to be cut with a single stroke of 
 the knife. There must be no boggling and hacking at things, no clumsiness and 
 no hesitation. If you strike a blow at all, strike with your strength! "Whatsoever 
 thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might!" If you are going to take up 
 Magick, make no compromise. You cannot make revolutions with rose-water, or wrestle 
 in a silk hat. You will find very soon that you must either lose the hat or stop 
 wrestling. Most people do both. They take up the magical path without sufficient 
 reflection, without that determination of adamant which made the author of this 
 book exclaim, as he took the first oath, "PERDURABO" --- "I will endure unto the 
 end!" 
 <blockquote><em>"For enduring unto the End, at the End was Naught to endure." 
   Liber 333, Cap Zeta.</em></blockquote>
 They start on it at a great pace, and then find that their boots are covered with 
 mud. Instead of persisting, they go back to Piccadilly. Such persons have only 
 themselves to thank if the very street-boys mock at them. 
 <p> Another recommendation was this: buy whatever may be necessary without haggling! 
 </p><p> You must not try to strike a proportion between the values of incommensurable 
   things. 
 </p><blockquote><em>However closely the square of any fraction approximates to 2, 
   no fraction equals the square root of 2. The square root of 2 is not in the 
   series; it is a different kind of number altogether.</em></blockquote>
 The least of the Magical Instruments is worth infinitely more than all that you 
 possess, or if you like, than all that you stupidly suppose yourself to possess. 
 Break this rule, and the usual Nemesis of the half-hearted awaits you. Not only 
 do you get inferior instruments, but you lose in some other way what you thought 
 you were so clever to have saved. Remember Ananias! 
 <blockquote><em>Observe well that there is never any real equivalence or measurable 
   relation between any two things, for each is impregnably Itself. The exchange 
   of property is not a mathematically accurate equation. The Want is merely a 
   conventional expression of the Will, just as a word is of a thought. It can 
   never be anything else; thus, though the process of making it, whether it involves 
   time, money, or labour, is a spiritual and moral synthesis, it is not measurable 
   in terms of its elements.</em></blockquote>
 On the other hand, if you purchase without haggling you will find that along with 
 your purchase the vendor has thrown in the purse of Fortunatus. No matter in what 
 extremity you may seem to be, at the last moment your difficulties will be solved. 
 For there is no power either of the firmament of the ether, or of the earth or 
 under the earth, on dry land or in the water, of whirling air or of rushing fire, 
 or any spell or scourge of God which is not obedient to the necessity of the Magician! 
 That which he has, he has not; but that which he is, he is; and that which he 
 will be, he will be. And neither God nor Man, nor all the malice of Choronzon, 
 can either check him, or cause him to waver for one instant upon the Path. This 
 command and this promise have been given by all the Magi without exception. And 
 where this command has been obeyed, this promise has been most certainly fulfilled. 
 <h3 align="center">III</h3>
 In all actions the same formulae are applicable. To invoke a god, i.e. to raise 
 yourself to that godhead, the process is threefold, PURIFICATION, CONSECRATION 
 and INITIATION. 
 <p> Therefore every magical weapon, and even the furniture of the Temple, must 
   be passed through this threefold regimen. The details only vary on inessential 
   points. E.G. to prepare the magician, he purifies himself by maintaining his 
   chastity 
 </p><blockquote><em>See The Book of the Law and the Commentaries thereon for the true 
   definition of this virtue.</em></blockquote>
 and abstaining from any defilement. But to do the same with, let us say, the Cup, 
 we assure ourselves that the metal has never been employed for any other purpose 
 --- we smelt virgin ore, and we take all possible pains in refining the metal 
 --- it must be chemically pure. 
 <p> To sum up this whole matter in a phrase, every article employed is treated 
   as if it were a candidate for initiation; but in those parts of the ritual in 
   which the candidate is blindfolded, we wrap the weapon in a black cloth 
 </p><blockquote><em>This refers to the "formula of the Neophyte". There are alternatives.</em></blockquote>
 . The oath which he takes is replaced by a "charge" in similar terms. The details 
 of the preparation of each weapon should be thought out carefully by the magician. 
 <p> Further, the attitude of the magician to his weapons should be that of the 
   God to the suppliant who invokes Him. It should be the love of the father for 
   his child, the tenderness and care of the bridegroom for his bride, and that 
   peculiar feeling which the creator of every work of art feels for his masterpiece. 
 </p><p> Where this is clearly understood, the magician will find no difficulty in 
   observing the proper ritual, not only in the actual ceremonial consecration 
   of each weapon, but in the actual preparation, a process which should adumbrate 
   this ceremony; e.g., the magician will cut the wand from the tree, will strip 
   it of leaves and twigs, will remove the bark. He will trim the ends nearly, 
   and smooth down the knots: --- this is the banishing. 
 </p><p> He will then rub it with the consecrated oil until it becomes smooth and glistening 
   and golden. He will then wrap it in silk of the appropriate colour: --- this 
   is the Consecration. 
 </p><p> He will then take it, and imagine that it is that hollow tube in which Prometheus 
   brought down fire from heaven, formulating to himself the passing of the Holy 
   Influence through it. In this and other ways he will perform the initiation; 
   and, this being accomplished, he will repeat the whole process in an elaborate 
   ceremony. 
 </p><blockquote><em>I have omitted to say that the whole subject of Magick is an example 
   of Mythopoeia in that particular form called Disease of Language. Thoth, God 
   of Magick, was merely a man who invented writing, as his monuments declare clearly 
   enough. "Grammarye", Magick, is only the Greek "Gramma". So also the old name 
   of a Magical Ritual, "Grimoire", is merely a Grammar. It appeared marvellous 
   to the vulgar that men should be able to communicate at a distance, and they 
   began to attribute other powers, merely invented, to the people who were able 
   to write. The Wand is then nothing but the pen; the Cup, the Inkpot; the Dagger, 
   the knife for sharpening the pen; and the disk (Pantacle) is either the papyrus 
   roll itself; or the weight which kept it in position, or the sandbox for soaking 
   up the ink. And, of course, the Papyrus of Ani is only the Latin for toilet-paper.</em></blockquote>
 To take an entirely different case, that of the Circle; the magician will synthesize 
 the Vermilion required from Mercury an Sulphur which he has himself sublimated. 
 This pure vermilion he will himself mix with the consecrated oil, and as he uses 
 this paint he will think intently and with devotion of the symbols which he draws. 
 This circle may then be initiated by a circumambulation, during which the magician 
 invokes the names of God that are on it. 
 <p> Any person without sufficient ingenuity to devise proper methods of preparation 
   for the other articles required is unlikely to make much of a magician; and 
   we shall only waste space if we deal in detail with the preparation of each 
   instrument. 
 </p><p> There is a definite instruction in Liber A vel Armorum, in the Equinox, Volume 
   I, Number IV, as to the Lamp and the Four Elemental Weapons.
