   OF CLAIRVOYANCE AND THE BODY OF LIGHT<br>
   ITS POWER AND ITS DEVELOPMENT<br>
   ALSO CONCERNING DIVINATION</h2>
 <h3 align="center">I</h3>
 Within the human body is another body of approximately the same size and shape; 
 <blockquote><em>i.e. as a general rule. It can be altered very greatly in these 
   respects.</em></blockquote>
 <p> but made of a subtler and less illusory material. It is of course not "real"; 
   but then no more is the other body! Before treating of clairvoyance one must 
   discuss briefly this question of reality, for misapprehension on the subject 
   has given rise to endless trouble. 
 </p><p> There is the story of the American in the train who saw another American carrying 
   a basket of unusual shape. His curiosity mastered him, and he leant across and 
   said: "Say, stranger, what you got in that bag?" The other, lantern-jawed and 
   taciturn, replied: "mongoose". The first man was rather baffled, as he had never 
   heard of a mongoose. After a pause he pursued, at the risk of a rebuff: "But 
   say, what is a Mongoose?" "Mongoose eats snakes", replied the other. This was 
   another poser, but he pursued: "What in hell do you want a Mongoose for?" "Well, 
   you see", said the second man (in a confidential whisper) "my brother sees snakes". 
   The first man was more puzzled than ever; but after a long think, he continued 
   rather pathetically: "But say, them ain't real snakes". "Sure", said the man 
   with the basket, "but this Mongoose ain't real either". 
 </p><p> This is a perfect parable of Magick. There is no such thing as truth in the 
   perceptible universe; every idea when analysed is found to contain a contradiction. 
   It is quite useless (except as a temporary expedient) to set up one class of 
   ideas against another as being "more real". The advance of man towards God is 
   not necessarily an advance towards truth. All philosophical systems have crumbled. 
   But each class of ideas possesses true relations within itself. It is possible, 
   with Berkeley, 
 </p><blockquote><em>The real Berkeley did nothing of the sort: the reference here 
   is to an imaginary animal invented by Dr. Johnson out of sturdy British ignorance.</em></blockquote>
 <p> to deny the existence of water and of wood; but, for all that, wood floats 
   on water. The Magician becomes identical with the immortal Osiris, yet the Magician 
   dies. In this dilemma the facts must be restated. One should preferably say 
   that the Magician becomes conscious of that part of himself which he calls the 
   immortal Osiris; and that Part does not "die". 
 </p><p> Now this interior body of the Magician, of which we spoke at the beginning 
   of this chapter, does exist, and can exert certain powers which his natural 
   body cannot do. It can, for example, pass through "matter", and it can move 
   freely in every direction through space. But this is because "matter", in the 
   sense in which we commonly use the word, is on another plane 
 </p><blockquote><em>We do not call electrical resistance, or economic laws, unreal, 
   on the ground that they are not directly perceived by the senses. Our magical 
   doctrine is universally accepted by sceptics --- only they wish to make Magick 
   itself an exception!</em></blockquote>
 <p> . 
 </p><p> Now this fine body perceives a universe which we do not ordinarily perceive. 
   It does not necessarily perceive the universe which we do normally perceive, 
   so although in this body I can pass through the roof, it does not follow that 
   I shall be able to tell what the weather is like. I might do so, or I might 
   not: but if I could not, it would not prove that I was deceiving myself in supposing 
   that I had passed through the roof. This body, which is called by various authors 
   the Astral double, body of Light, body of fire, body of desire, fine body, scin-laeca 
   and numberless other names is naturally fitted to perceive objects of its own 
   class ... in particular, the phantoms of the astral plane. 
 </p><p> There is some sort of vague and indeterminate relation between the Astrals 
   and the Materials; and it is possible, with great experience, to deduce facts 
   about material things from the astral aspect which they present to the eyes 
   of the Body of Light. 
 </p><blockquote><em>This is because there is a certain necessary correspondence between 
   planes; as in the case of an Anglo-Indian's liver and this temper. The relation 
   appears "vague and indeterminate" only in so far as one happens to be ignorant 
   of the laws which state the case. The situation is analogous to that of the 
   chemist before the discovery of the law of "Combining Weights", etc.</em></blockquote>
 <p> This astral plane is so varied and so changeable that several clairvoyants 
   looking at the same thing might give totally different accounts of what they 
   saw; yet they might each make correct deductions. In looking at a man the first 
   clairvoyant might say: "The lines of force are all drooping"; the second: "It 
   seems all dirty and spotty"; a third; "The Aura looks very ragged." Yet all 
   might agree in deducing that the man was in ill-health. In any case all such 
   deductions are rather unreliable. One must be a highly skilled man before one 
   can trust one's vision. A great many people think that they are extremely good 
   at the business, when in fact they have only made some occasional shrewd guesses 
   (which they naturally remember) in the course of hundreds of forgotten failures. 
 </p><p> The only way to test clairvoyance is to keep a careful record of every experiment 
   made. For example, FRATER O. M. once gave a clairvoyant a waistcoat to psychometrize. 
   He made 56 statements about the owner of the waistcoat; of these 4 were notably 
   right; 17, though correct, were of that class of statement which is true of 
   almost everybody. The remainder were wrong. It was concluded from this that 
   he showed no evidence of any special power. In fact, his bodily eyes, --- if 
   he could discern Tailoring --- would have served him better, for he thought 
   the owner of the vest was a corn-chandler, instead of an earl, as he is. 
 </p><p> The Magician can hardly take too much trouble to develop this power in himself. 
   It is extremely useful to him in guarding himself against attack; in obtaining 
   warnings, in judging character, and especially in watching the process of his 
   Ceremonies. 
 </p><p> There are a great many ways of acquiring the power. Gaze into a crystal, or 
   into a pool of ink in the palm of the hand, or into a mirror, or into a teacup. 
   Just as with a microscope the expert operator keeps both eyes open, though seeing 
   only through the one at the eye-piece of the instrument, so the natural eyes, 
   ceasing to give any message to the brain, the attention is withdrawn from them, 
   and the man begins to see through the Astral eyes. 
 </p><p> These methods appear to The MASTER THERION to be unsatisfactory. Very often 
   they do not work at all. It is difficult to teach a person to use these methods; 
   and, worst of all, they are purely passive! You can see only what is shewn you, 
   and you are probably shewn things perfectly pointless and irrelevant. 
 </p><p> The proper method is as follows: --- Develop the body of Light until it is 
   just as real to you as your other body, teach it to travel to any desired symbol, 
   and enable it to perform all necessary Rites and Invocations. In short, educate 
   it. Ultimately, the relation of that body with your own must be exceedingly 
   intimate; but before this harmonizing takes place, you should begin by a careful 
   differentiation. The first thing to do, therefore, is to get the body outside 
   your own. To avoid muddling the two, you begin by imagining a shape resembling 
   yourself standing in front of you. Do not say: "Oh, it's only imagination!" 
   The time to test that is later on, when you have secured a fairly clear mental 
   image of such a body. Try to imagine how your own body would look if you were 
   standing in its place; try to transfer your consciousness to the Body of Light. 
   Your own body has its eyes shut. Use the eyes of the Body of Light to describe 
   the objects in the room behind you. Don't say. "It's only an effort of subconscious 
   memory" ... the time to test that is later on. 
 </p><p> As soon as you feel more or less at home in the fine body, let it rise in 
   the air. Keep on feeling the sense of rising; keep on looking about you as you 
   rise until you see landscapes or beings of the astral plane. Such have a quality 
   all their own. They are not like material things --- they are not like mental 
   pictures --- they seem to lie between the two. 
 </p><p> After some practice has made you adept, so that in the course of any hour's 
   journey you can reckon on having a fairly eventful time, turn your attention 
   to reaching a definite place on the astral plane; invoke Mercury, for example, 
   and examine carefully your record of the resulting vision --- discover whether 
   the symbols which you have seen correspond with the conventional symbols of 
   Mercury. 
 </p><p> This testing of the spirits is the most important branch of the whole tree 
   of Magick. Without it, one is lost in the jungle of delusion. Every spirit, 
   up to God himself, is ready to deceive you if possible, to make himself out 
   more important than he is; in short to lay in wait for your soul in 333 separate 
   ways. Remember that after all the highest of all the Gods is only the Magus, 
 </p><blockquote><em>See Liber 418, 3rd Aethyr.</em></blockquote>
 <p> Mayan, the greatest of all the devils. 
 </p><p> You may also try "rising on the planes". 
 </p><blockquote><em>See Infra and Appendix.</em></blockquote>
 <p> With a little practice, especially if you have a good Guru, you ought to be 
   able to slip in and out of your astral body as easily as you slip in and out 
   of a dressing-gown. It will then no longer be so necessary for your astral body 
   to be sent far off; without moving an inch you will be able to "turn on" its 
   eyes and ears --- as simply as the man with the microscope (mentioned above) 
   can transfer his complete attention from one eye to the other. 
 </p><p> Now, however unsuccessful your getting out the body may apparently have been, 
   it is most necessary to use every effort to bring it properly back. Make the 
   Body of Light coincide in space with the physical body, assume the God-Form, 
   and vibrate the name of Harpocrates with the utmost energy; then recover unity 
   of consciousness. If you fail to do this properly you may find yourself in serious 
   trouble. Your Body of Light may wander away uncontrolled, and be attacked and 
   obsessed. You will become aware of this through the occurrence of headache, 
   bad dreams, or even more serious signs such as hysteria, fainting fits, possibly 
   madness or paralysis. Even the worst of these attacks will probably wear off, 
   but it may leave you permanently damaged to a greater or less extent. 
 </p><p> A great majority of "spiritualists", "occultists", "Toshosophists", are pitiable 
   examples of repeated losses from this cause. 
 </p><p> The emotional type of religionist also suffers in this way. Devotion projects 
   the fine body, which is seized and vampirized by the demon masquerading as "Christ" 
   or "Mary", or whoever may be the object of worship. Complete absence of all 
   power to concentrate thought, to follow an argument, to formulate a Will, to 
   hold fast to an opinion or a course of action, or even to keep a solemn oath, 
   mark indelibly those who have thus lost parts of their souls. They wander from 
   one new cult to another even crazier. Occasionally such persons drift for a 
   moment into the surrounding of The MASTER THERION, and are shot out by the simple 
   process of making them try to do a half-hour's honest work of any kind. 
 </p><p> In projecting the Astral, it is a valuable additional safeguard to perform 
   the whole operation in a properly consecrated circle. 
 </p><p> Proceed with great caution, then, but proceed. In time your Body of Light 
   will be as strong against spirits as your other body against the winds of Heaven. 
   All depends upon the development of that Body of Light. It must be furnished 
   with an organism as ramified and balanced as its shadowy brother, the material 
   body. 
 </p><p> To recapitulate once more, then, the first task is to develop your own Body 
   of light within your own circle without reference to any other inhabitants of 
   the world to which it belongs. 
 </p><p> That which you have accomplished with the subject you may now proceed to do 
   with the object. You will learn to see the astral appearance of material things; 
   and although this does not properly belong to pure clairvoyance, one may here 
   again mention that you should endeavour to the utmost to develop and fortify 
   this Body of Light. The best and simplest way to do this is to use it constantly, 
   to exercise it in every way. In particular it may be employed in ceremonies 
   of initiation or of invocation --- while the physical body remains silent and 
   still. 
 </p><p> In doing this it will often be necessary to create a Temple on the astral 
   plane. It is excellent practice to create symbols. This one precaution is needed: 
   after using them, they should be reabsorbed. 
 </p><p> Having learned to create astral forms, the next step will be at first very 
   difficult. Phantasmal and fleeting as the astral is in general, those forms 
   which are definitely attached to the material possess enormous powers of resistance, 
   and it consequently requires very high potential to influence them. The material 
   analogues seem to serve as a fortress. Even where a temporary effect is produced, 
   the inertia of matter draws it back to the normal; yet the power of the trained 
   and consecrated will in a well-developed astral body is such that it can even 
   produce a permanent change in the material upon whose Body of Light you are 
   working, e.g.; one can heal the sick by restoring a healthy appearance to their 
   astral forms. On the other hand, it is possible so to disintegrate the Body 
   of Light even of a strong man that he will fall dead. 
 </p><p> Such operations demand not only power, but judgment. Nothing can upset the 
   sum total of destiny --- everything must be paid for the uttermost farthing. 
   For this reason a great many operations theoretically possible cannot be performed. 
   Suppose, for example, you see two men of similarly unhealthy astral appearance. 
   In one case the cause may be slight and temporary. Your help suffices to restore 
   him in a few minutes. The other, who looks no worse, is really oppressed by 
   a force incalculably greater than you could control, and you would only damage 
   yourself by attempting to help him. The diagnosis between the two cases could 
   be made by an investigation of the deeper strata of the astral, such as compose 
   the"causal body". 
 </p><p> A body of black magicians under Anna Kingsford 
 </p><blockquote><em>Anna Kingsford, so far as her good work is concerned, was only 
   the rubber stamp of Edward Maitland.</em></blockquote>
 <p> once attempted to kill a vivisector who was not particularly well known; and 
   they succeeded in making him seriously ill. But in attempting the same thing 
   with Pasteur they produced no effect whatever, because Pasteur was a great genius 
   --- an adept in his own line far greater than she in hers --- and because millions 
   of people were daily blessing him. It cannot be too clearly understood that 
   magical force is subject to the same laws of proportion as any other kind of 
   force. It is useless for a mere millionaire to try to bankrupt a man who has 
   the Bank of England behind him. 
 </p><p> To sum up, the first task is to separate the astral form from the physical 
   body, the second to develop the powers of the astral body, in particular those 
   of sight, travel, and interpretation; third, to unify the two bodies without 
   muddling them. 
 </p><p> This being accomplished, the magician is fitted to deal with the invisible. 
 </p><h3 align="center">II</h3>
 It is now useful to contine with considerations of other planes, which have commonly 
 been classed under the Astral. There is some reason for this, as the delimitations 
 are somewhat vague. Just as the vegetable kingdom merges into the animal, and 
 as the material plane has beings which encroach upon the boundaries of the astral, 
 so do we find it in the higher planes. 
 <p> The mental images which appear during meditation are subjective, and pertain 
   not at all to the astral plane. Only very rarely do astral images occur during 
   meditation. It is a bad break in the circle, as a rule, when they do. 
 </p><p> There is also a Magical Plane. This touches the material, and even includes 
   a portion of it. It includes the Astral, chiefly a full-blooded type of the 
   Astral. It reaches to and includes most, if not all, of the spiritual planes. 
 </p><p> The Magical plane is thus the most comprehensive of all. Egyptian Gods are 
   typical inhabitants of this plane, and it is the home of every Adept. 
 </p><p> The spiritual planes are of several types, but are all distinguished by a 
   reality and intensity to be found nowhere else. Their inhabitants are formless, 
   free of space and time, and distinguished by incomparable brilliance. 
 </p><p> There are also a number of sub-planes, as, for example, the Alchemical. This 
   plane will often appear in the practice of "Rising on the Planes"; its images 
   are usually those of gardens curiously kept, mountains furnished with peculiar 
   symbols, hieroglyphic animals, or such figures as that of the "Hermetic Arcanum", 
   and pictures like the "Goldseekers" and the "Massacre of the Innocents" of Basil 
   Valentine. There is a unique quality about the alchemical Plane which renders 
   its images immediately recognizable. 
 </p><p> There are also planes corresponding to various religions past and present, 
   all of which have their peculiar unity. 
 </p><p> It is of the utmost importance to the "Clairvoyant" or "traveler in the fine 
   body" to be able to find his way to any desired plane, and operate therein as 
   its ruler. 
 </p><p> The Neophyte of A.'. A.'. is examined most strictly in this practice before 
   he is passed to the degree of Zelator. 
 </p><p> In "Rising on the Planes" one must usually pass clear through the Astral to 
   the Spiritual. Some will be unable to do this. The "fine body" which is good 
   enough to subsist on lower planes, a shadow among shadows, will fail to penetrate 
   the higher strata. It requires a great development of this body, and an intense 
   infusion of the highest spiritual constituents of man, before he can pierce 
   the veils. The constant practice of Magick is the best preparation possible. 
   Even though the human consciousness fail to reach the goal, the consciousness 
   of the fine body itself may do so, wherefore whoso travels in that body on a 
   subsequent occasion may be found worthy; and its success will react favourably 
   on the human consciousness, and increase its likelihood of success in its next 
   magical operation. 
 </p><p> Similarly, the powers gained in this way will strengthen the magician in his 
   mediation-practices. His Will becomes better able to assist the concentration, 
   to destroy the mental images which disturb it, and to reject the lesser rewards 
   of that practice which tempt, and too often stop the progress of, the mystic. 
 </p><p> Although it is said that the spiritual lies "beyond the astral", this is theoretical; 
 </p><blockquote><em>The Hon. Bertrand Russell's "Principia Mathematica" may be said 
   to "lie beyond" Colenso's "School Arithmetic"; but one can take the former book 
   from one's shelves --- as every one should --- and read it without first going 
   all through the latter again.</em></blockquote>
 <p> the advanced Magician will not find it to be so in practice. He will be able 
   by suitable invocation to travel directly to any place desired. In Liber 418 
   an example of perfection is given. The Adept who explored these Aethyrs did 
   not have to pass through and beyond the Universe, the whole of which yet lies 
   within even the inmost (30th) Aethyr. He was able to summon the Aethyrs he wanted, 
   and His chief difficulty was that sometimes He was at first unable to pierce 
   their veils. In fact, as the Book shows, it was only by virtue of successive 
   and most exalted initiations undergone in the Aethyrs themselves that He was 
   able to penetrate beyond the 15th. The Guardians of such fortresses know how 
   to guard. 
 </p><p> The MASTER THERION has published the most important practical magical secrets 
   in the plainest language. No one, by virtue of being clever or learned, has 
   understood one word; and those unworthy who have profaned the sacrament have 
   but eaten and drunken damnation to themselves. 
 </p><p> One may bring down stolen fire in a hollow tube from Heaven, as The MASTER 
   THERION indeed has done in a way that no other adept dared to do before him. 
   But the thief, the Titan, must foreknow and consent to his doom to be chained 
   upon a lonely rock, the vulture devouring his liver, for a season, until Hercules, 
   the strong man armed by virtue of that very fire, shall come and release him. 
 </p><p> The TEITAN 
 </p><blockquote><em>GR:Tau-Epsilon-Iota-Tau-Alpha-Nu = 300+5+10+300+1+50 = 666.</em></blockquote>
 <p> --- whose number is the number of a man, six hundred and three score and six 
   --- unsubdued, consoled by Asia and Panthea, must send forth constant showers 
   of blessing not only upon Man whose incarnation he is, but upon the tyrant and 
   the persecutor. His infinite pain must thrill his heart with joy, since every 
   pang is but the echo of some new flame that leaps upon the earth lit by his 
   crime. 
 </p><p> For the Gods are the enemies of Man; it is Nature that Man must overcome ere 
   he enter into his kingdom.&lt;<in another sense a higher nature is absolutely right throughout. the position that magician discovers himself imprisoned in distorted of iniquity and his task to disentangle it. this all be studied book wisdom or folly aleph cxi master therion edition teh king rough note from magical diary appended here:> 
 <p> "All elements must at one time have been separate, --- that would be the case 
   with great heat. Now when atoms get to the sun, when we get to the sun, we get 
   that immense, extreme heat, and all the elements are themselves again. Imagine 
   that each atom of each element possesses the memory of all his adventures in 
   combination. By the way, that atom (fortified with that memory) would not be 
   the same atom; yet it is, because it has gained nothing from anywhere except 
   this memory. Therefore, by the lapse of time, and by virtue of memory, a thing 
   could become something more than itself; and thus a real development is possible. 
   One can then see a reason for any element deciding to go through this series 
   of incarnations; because so, and only so, can he go; and he suffers the lapse 
   of memory which he has during these incarnations, because he knows he will come 
   through unchanged. 
 </p><p> "Therefore you can have an infinite number of gods, individual and equal though 
   diverse, each one supreme and utterly indestructible. This is also the only 
   explanation of how a being could create a war {WEH NOTE: SIC, probably should 
   be "world"} in which war, evil, etc. exist. Evil is only an appearance, because, 
   (like "good") it cannot affect the substance itself, but only multiply its combinations. 
   This is something the same as mystic monotheism, but the objection to that theory 
   is that God has to create things which are all parts of himself, so that their 
   interplay is false. If we presuppose many elements, their interplay is natural. 
   It is no objection to this theory to ask who made the elements, --- the elements 
   are at least there, and God, when you look for him, is not there. Theism is 
   "obscurum per obscurius." A male star is built up from the centre outwards; 
   a female from the circumference inwards. This is what is meant when we say that 
   woman has no soul. It explains fully the difference between the sexes.&gt;&gt; The 
   true God is man. In man are all things hidden. Of these the Gods, Nature, Time, 
   all the powers of the universe are rebellious slaves. It is these that men must 
   fight and conquer in the power and in the name of the Beast that hath availed 
   them, the Titan, the Magus, the Man whose number is six hundred and three score 
   and six. 
 </p><h3 align="center">III</h3>
 The practice of Rising on the Planes is of such importance that special attention 
 must be paid to it. It is part of the essential technique of Magick. Instruction 
 in this practice has been given with such conciseness in Liber O, that one cannot 
 do better than quote verbatim (the "previous experiment" referred to in the first 
 sentence is the ordinary astral journey.): 
 <p> "1. The previous experiment has little value, and leads to few results of 
   importance. But it is susceptible of a development which merges into a form 
   of Dharana --- concentration --- and as such may lead to the very highest ends. 
   The principal use of the practice in the last chapter is to familiarise the 
   student with every kind of obstacle and every kind of delusion, so that he may 
   be perfect master of every idea that may arise in his brain, to dismiss it, 
   to transmute it, to cause it instantly to obey his will. 
 </p><p> "2. Let him then begin exactly as before; but with the most intense solemnity 
   and determination. 
 </p><p> "3. Let him be very careful to cause his imaginary body to rise in a line 
   exactly perpendicular to the earth's tangent at the point where his physical 
   body is situated (or, to put it more simply, straight upwards). 
 </p><p> "4. Instead of stopping, let him continue to rise until fatigue almost overcomes 
   him. If he should find that he has stopped without willing to do so, and that 
   figures appear, let him at all costs rise above them. Yea, though his very life 
   tremble on his lips, let him force his way upward and onward! 
 </p><p> "5. Let him continue in this so long as the breath of life is in him. Whatever 
   threatens, whatever allures, though it were Typhon and all his hosts loosed 
   from the pit and leagued against him, though it were from the very Throne of 
   God himself that a voice issues bidding him stay and be content, let him struggle 
   on, ever on. 
 </p><p> "6. At last there must come a moment when his whole being is swallowed up 
   in fatigue, overwhelmed by its own inertia. Let him sink (when no longer can 
   he strive, though his tongue be bitten through with the effort and the blood 
   gush from his nostrils) into the blackness of unconsciousness; and then on coming 
   to himself, let him write down soberly and accurately a record of all that hath 
   occurred: yea, a record of all that hath occurred." 
 </p><p> Of course, the Rising may be done from any starting pint. One can go (for 
   example) into the circle of Jupiter, and the results, especially in the lower 
   planes, will be very different to those obtained from a Saturnian starting point. 
 </p><p> The student should undertake a regular series of such experiments, in order 
   to familiarise himself not only with the nature of the different spheres, but 
   with the inner meaning of each. Of course, it is not necessary in every case 
   to push the practice to exhaustion, as described in the instructions, but this 
   is the proper thing to do whenever definitely practising, in order to acquire 
   the power of Rising. But, having obtained this power, it is, of course, legitimate 
   to rise to any particular plane that may be necessary for the purpose of exploration, 
   as in the case of the visions recorded in Liber 418, where the method may be 
   described as mixed. In such a case, it is not enough to invoke the place you 
   wish to visit, because you may not be able to endure its pressure, or to breathe 
   its atmosphere. Several instances occur in that record where the seer was unable 
   to pass through certain gateways, or to remain in certain contemplations. He 
   had to undergo certain Initiations before he was able to proceed. Thus, it is 
   necessary that the technique of Magick should be perfected. The Body of Light 
   must be rendered capable of going everywhere and doing everything. It is, therefore, 
   always the question of drill which is of importance. You have got to go out 
   Rising on the Planes every day of your life, year after year. You are not to 
   be disheartened by failure, or too much encouraged by success, in any one practice 
   or set of practices. What you are doing is what will be of real value to you 
   in the end; and that is, developing a character, creating a Karma, which will 
   give you the power to do your will. 
 </p><h3 align="center">IV</h3>
 Divination is so important a branch of Magick as almost to demand a separate treatise. 
 <p> Genius is composed of two sides; the active and the passive. The power to 
   execute the Will is but blind force unless the Will be enlightened. At every 
   stage of a Magical Operation it is necessary to know what one is doing, and 
   to be sure that one is acting wisely. Acute sensitiveness is always associated 
   with genius; the power to perceive the universe accurately, to analyse, coordinate, 
   and judge impressions is the foundation of all great Work. An army is but a 
   blundering brute unless its intelligence department works as it should. 
 </p><p> The Magician obtains the transcendental knowledge necessary to an intelligent 
   course of conduct directly in consciousness by clairvoyance and clairaudience; 
   but communication with superior intelligences demands elaborate preparation, 
   even after years of successful performance. 
 </p><p> It is therefore useful to possess an art by which one can obtain at a moment's 
   notice any information that may be necessary. This art is divination. The answers 
   to one's questions in divination are not conveyed directly but through the medium 
   of a suitable series of symbols. These symbols must be interpreted by the diviner 
   in terms of his problem. It is not practicable to construct a lexicon in which 
   the solution of every difficulty is given in so many words. It would be unwieldy; 
   besides, nature does not happen to work on those lines. 
 </p><p> The theory of any process of divination may be stated in a few simple terms. 
 </p><p> 1. We postulate the existence of intelligences, either within or without the 
   diviner, of which he is not immediately conscious. (It does not matter to the 
   theory whether the communicating spirit so-called is an objective entity or 
   a concealed portion of the diviner's mind.) We assume that such intelligences 
   are able to reply correctly --- within limits --- to the questions asked. 
 </p><p> 2. We postulate that it is possible to construct a compendium of hieroglyphs 
   sufficiently elastic in meaning to include every possible idea, and that one 
   or more of these may always be taken to represent any idea. We assume that any 
   of these hieroglyphics will be understood by the intelligences with whom we 
   wish to communicate in the same sense as it is by ourselves. We have therefore 
   a sort of language. One may compare it to a "lingua franca" which is perhaps 
   defective in expressing fine shades of meaning, and so is unsuitable for literature, 
   but which yet serves for the conduct of daily affairs in places where many tongues 
   are spoken. Hindustani is an example of this. But better still is the analogy 
   between the conventional signs and symbols employed by mathematicians, who can 
   thus convey their ideas perfectly 
 </p><blockquote><em>As a matter of fact, they cannot. The best qualified are the most 
   diffident as to having grasped the meaning of their colleagues with exactitude; 
   in criticising their writings they often make a point of apologising for possible 
   misunderstanding.</em></blockquote>
 <p> without speaking a word of each other's languages. 
 </p><p> 3. We postulate that the intelligences whom wish to consul are willing, or 
   may be compelled, to answer us truthfully. 
 </p><p> Let us first consider the question of the compendium of symbols. The alphabet 
   of a language is a more or less arbitrary way of transcribing the sounds employed 
   in speaking it. The letters themselves have not necessarily any meaning as such. 
   But in a system of divination each symbol stands for a definite idea. It would 
   not interfere with the English language to add a few new letters. In fact, some 
   systems of shorthand have done so. But a system of symbols suitable for divination 
   must be a complete representation of the Universe, so that each is absolute, 
   and the whole insusceptible to increase or diminution. It is (in fact) technically 
   a pantacle in the fullest sense of the word. 
 </p><p> Let us consider some prominent examples of such system. We may observe that 
   a common mode of divination is to inquire of books by placing the thumb at random 
   within the leaves. The Books of the Sybil, the works of Vergil, and the Bible 
   have been used very frequently for this purpose. For theoretical justification, 
   one must assume that the book employed is a perfect representation of the Universe. 
   But even if this were the case, it is an inferior form of construction, because 
   the only reasonable conception of the Cosmos is mathematical and hieroglyphic 
   rather than literary. In the case of a book, such as the Book of the Law which 
   is the supreme truth and the perfect rule of life, it is not repugnant to good 
   sense to derive an oracle from its pages. It will of course be remarked that 
   the Book of the Law is not merely a literary compilation but a complex mathematical 
   structure. It therefore fulfils the required conditions. 
 </p><p> The principal means of divination in history are astrology, geomancy, the 
   Tarot, the Holy Qabalah, and the Yi King. There are hundreds of others; from 
   pyromancy, oneiromancy, auguries from sacrifices, and the spinning-top of some 
   ancient oracles to the omens drawn from the flight of birds and the prophesying 
   of tea-leaves. It will be sufficient for our present purpose to discuss only 
   the five systems first enumerated. 
 </p><p> ASTROLOGY is theoretically a perfect method, since the symbols employed actually 
   exist in the macrocosm, and thus possess a natural correspondence with microcosmic 
   affairs. But in practice the calculations involved are overwhelmingly complicated. 
   A horoscope is never complete. It needs to be supplemented by innumerable other 
   horoscopes. For example, to obtain a judgment on the simplest question, one 
   requires not only the nativities of the people involved, some of which are probably 
   inaccessible, but secondary figures for directions and transits, together with 
   progressed horoscopes, to say nothing of prenatal, mundane, and even horary 
   figures. To appreciate the entire mass of data, to balance the elements of so 
   vast a concourse of forces, and to draw a single judgment therefrom, is a task 
   practically beyond human capacity. Besides all this, the actual effects of the 
   planetary positions and aspects are still almost entirely unknown. No two astrologers 
   agree on all points; and most of them are at odds on fundamental principles. 
 </p><blockquote><em>Nearly all professional astrologers are ignorant of their own 
   subject, as of all others.</em></blockquote>
 <p> This science had better be discarded unless the student chances to feel strongly 
   drawn toward it. It is used by the MASTER THERION Himself with fairly satisfactory 
   results, but only in special cases, in a strictly limited sphere, and with particular 
   precautions. Even so, He feels great diffidence in basing His conduct on the 
   result so obtained. 
 </p><p> GEOMANCY has the advantage of being rigorously mathematical. A hand-book of 
   the science is to be found in Equinox I, II. The objection to its use lies in 
   the limited number of the symbols. To represent the Universe by no more than 
   16 combinations throws too much work upon them. There is also a great restriction 
   arising from the fact that although 15 symbols appear in the final figure, there 
   are, in reality, but 4, the remaining 11 being drawn by an ineluctable process 
   from the "Mothers". It may be added that the tables given in the handbook for 
   the interpretation of the figure are exceedingly vague on the one hand, and 
   insufficiently comprehensive on the other. Some Adepts, however, appear to find 
   this system admirable, and obtain great satisfaction from its use. Once more, 
   the personal equation must be allowed full weight. At one time the MASTER THERION 
   employed it extensively; but He was never wholly at ease with it; He found the 
   interpretation very difficult. Moreover, it seemed to Him that the geomantic 
   intelligences themselves were of a low order, the scope of which was confined 
   to a small section of the things which interested Him; also, they possessed 
   a point of view of their own which was far from sympathetic with His, so that 
   misunderstanding constantly interfered with the Work. 
 </p><p> THE TAROT and THE HOLY QABALAH may be discussed together. The theoretical 
   basis of both is identical: The Tree of Life. 
 </p><blockquote><em>Both these subjects may be studied in the Equinox in several articles 
   appearing in several numbers.</em></blockquote>
 <p> The 78 symbols of the Tarot are admirably balanced and combined. They are 
   adequate to all demands made upon them; each symbol is not only mathematically 
   precise, but possesses an artistic significance which helps the diviner to understand 
   them by stimulating his aesthetic perceptions. The MASTER THERION finds that 
   the Tarot is infallible in material questions. The successive operations describe 
   the course of events with astonishing wealth of detail, and the judgments are 
   reliable in all respects. But a proper divination means at least two hours' 
   hard work, even by the improved method developed by Him from the traditions 
   of initiates. Any attempt to shorten the proceedings leads to disappointment; 
   furthermore, the symbols do not lend themselves readily to the solution of spiritual 
   questions. 
 </p><p> The Holy Qabalah, based as it is on pure number, evidently possesses an infinite 
   number of symbols. Its scope is conterminous with existence itself; and it lacks 
   nothing in precision, purity, or indeed in any other perfection. But it cannot 
   be taught; 
 </p><blockquote><em>It is easy to teach the General Principles of exegesis, and the 
   main doctrines. There is a vast body of knowledge common to all cases; but this 
   is no more than the basis on which the student must erect his original Research.</em></blockquote>
 <p> each man must select for himself the materials for the main structure of his 
   system. It requires years of work to erect a worthy building. Such a building 
   is never finished; every day spent on it adds new ornaments. The Qabalah is 
   therefore a living Temple of the Holy Ghost. It is the man himself and his universe 
   expressed in terms of thought whose language is so rich that even the letters 
   of its alphabet have no limit. This system is so sublime that it is unsuited 
   to the solution of the petty puzzles of our earthly existence. In the light 
   of the Qabalah, the shadows of transitory things are instantly banished. 
 </p><p> The YI KING is the most satisfactory system for general work. The MASTER THERION 
   is engaged in the preparation of a treatise on the subject, but the labour involved 
   is so great that He cannot pledge Himself to have it ready at any definite time. 
   The student must therefore make his own investigations into the meaning of the 
   64 hexagrams as best he can. 
 </p><p> The Yi King is mathematical and philosophical in form. Its structure is cognate 
   with that of the Qabalah; the identity is so intimate that the existence of 
   two such superficially different systems is transcendent testimony to the truth 
   of both. It is in some ways the most perfect hieroglyph ever constructed. It 
   is austere and sublime, yet withal so adaptable to every possible emergency 
   that its figures may be interpreted to suit all classes of questions. One may 
   resolve the most obscure spiritual difficulties no less than the most mundane 
   dilemmas; and the symbol which opens the gates of the most exalted palaces of 
   initiation is equally effective when employed to advise one in the ordinary 
   business of life. The MASTER THERION has found the Yi King entirely satisfactory 
   in every respect. The intelligences which direct it show no inclination to evade 
   the question or to mislead the querent. A further advantage is that the actual 
   apparatus is simple. Also the system is easy to manipulate, and five minutes 
   is sufficient to obtain a fairly detailed answer to any but the most obscure 
   questions. 
 </p><p> With regard to the intelligences whose business it is to give information 
   to the diviner, their natures differ widely, and correspond more or less to 
   the character of the medium of divination. Thus, the geomantic intelligences 
   are gnomes, spirits of an earthy nature, distinguished from each other by the 
   modifications due to the various planetary and zodiacal influences which pertain 
   to the several symbols. The intelligence governing Puella is not to be confused 
   with that of Venus or of Libra. It is simply a particular terrestrial daemon 
   which partakes of those natures. 
 </p><p> The Tarot, on the other hand, being a book, is under Mercury, and the intelligence 
   of each card is fundamentally Mercurial. Such symbols are therefore peculiarly 
   proper to communicate thought. They are not gross, like the geomantic daemons; 
   but, as against this, they are unscrupulous in deceiving the diviner. 
 </p><blockquote><em>This does not mean that they are malignant. They have a proper 
   pride in their office as Oracles of Truth; and they refuse to be profaned by 
   the contamination of inferior and impure intelligences. A Magician whose research 
   is fully adapted to his Neschamah will find them lucid and reliable.</em></blockquote>
 <p> The Yi King is served by beings free from these defects. The intense purity 
   of the symbols prevent them from being usurped by intelligences with an axe 
   of their own to grind. 
 </p><blockquote><em>Malicious or pranksome elementals instinctively avoid the austere 
   sincerity of the Figures of Fu and King Wan.</em></blockquote>
 <p> It is always essential for the diviner to obtain absolute magical control 
   over the intelligences of the system which he adopts. He must not leave the 
   smallest loop-hole for being tricked, befogged, or mocked. He must not allow 
   them to use casuistry in the interpretation of his questions. It is a common 
   knavery, especially in geomancy, to render an answer which is literally true, 
   and yet deceives. For instance, one might ask whether some business transaction 
   would be profitable, and find, after getting an affirmative answer, that it 
   really referred to the other party to the affair! 
 </p><p> There is, on the surface, no difficulty at all in getting replies. In fact, 
   the process is mechanical; success is therefore assured, bar a stroke of apoplexy. 
   But, even suppose we are safe from deceit, how can we know that the question 
   has really been put to another mind, understood rightly, and answered from knowledge? 
   It is obviously possible to check one's operations by clairvoyance, but this 
   is rather like buying a safe to keep a brick in. Experience is the only teacher. 
   One acquires what one may almost call a new sense. One feels in one's self whether 
   one is right or not. The diviner must develop this sense. It resembles the exquisite 
   sensibility of touch which is found in the great billiard player whose fingers 
   can estimate infinitesimal degrees of force, or the similar phenomenon in the 
   professional taster of tea or wine who can distinguish fantastically subtle 
   differences of flavour. 
 </p><p> It is a hard saying; but in the order to divine without error, one ought to 
   be a Master of the Temple. Divination affords excellent practice for those who 
   aspire to that exalted eminence, for the faintest breath of personal preference 
   will deflect the needle from the pole of truth in the answer. Unless the diviner 
   have banished utterly from his mind the minutest atom of interest in the answer 
   to his question, he is almost certain to influence that answer in favour of 
   his personal inclinations. 
 </p><p> The psycho-analyst will recall the fact that dreams are phantasmal representations 
   of the unconscious Will of the sleeper, and that not only are they images of 
   that Will instead of representations of objective truth, but the image itself 
   is confused by a thousand cross-currents set in motion by the various complexes 
   and inhibitions of his character. If therefore one consults the oracle, one 
   must take sure that one is not consciously or unconsciously bringing pressure 
   to bear upon it. It is just as when an Englishman cross-examines a Hindu, the 
   ultimate answer will be what the Hindu imagines will best please the inquirer. 
 </p><p> The same difficulty appears in a grosser form when one receives a perfectly 
   true reply, but insists on interpreting it so as to suit one's desires. The 
   vast majority of people who go to "fortunetellers" have nothing else in mind 
   but the wish to obtain supernatural sanction for their follies. Apart from Occultism 
   altogether, every one knows that when people ask for advice, they only want 
   to be told how wise they are. Hardly any one acts on the most obviously commonsense 
   counsel if it happens to clash with his previous intentions. Indeed, who would 
   take counsel unless he were warned by some little whisper in his heart that 
   he was about to make a fool of himself, which he is determined to do, and only 
   wants to be able to blame his best friend, or the oracle, when he is overtaken 
   by the disaster which his own interior mentor foresees? 
 </p><p> Those who embark on divination will be wise to consider the foregoing remarks 
   very deeply. They will know when they are getting deep enough by the fact of 
   the thought beginning to hurt them. It is essential to explore oneself to the 
   utmost, to analyse one's mind until one can be positive, beyond the possibility 
   of error, that one is able to detach oneself entirely from the question. The 
   oracle is a judge; it must be beyond bribery and prejudice. 
 </p><p> It is impossible in practice to lay down rules for the interpretation of symbols. 
   Their nature must be investigated by intellectual methods such as the Qabalah, 
   but the precise shape of meaning in any one case, and the sphere and tendency 
   of its application, must be acquired by experience, that is, but induction, 
   by recording and classifying one's experiments over a long period; and --- this 
   is the better part --- by refining one's ratiocination to the point where it 
   becomes instinct or intuition, whichever one likes to call it. 
 </p><p> It is proper in cases where the sphere of the question is well marked to begin 
   the divination by invocations of the forces thereto appropriate. An error of 
   judgment as to the true character of the question would entail penalties proportionate 
   to the extent of that error; and the delusions resulting from a divination fortified 
   by invocation would be more serious than if one had not employed such heavy 
   artillery. 
 </p><blockquote><em>The apparent high sanction for the error would fortify the obstinacy 
   of the mule.</em></blockquote>
 <p> There can, however, be no objection to preparing oneself by a general purification 
   and consecration devised with the object of detaching oneself from one's personality 
   and increasing the sensitiveness of one's faculties. 
 </p><p> All divination comes under the general type of the element Air. The peculiar 
   properties of air are in consequence its uniform characteristics. Divination 
   is subtle and intangible. It moves with mysterious ease, expanding, contracting, 
   flowing, responsive to the slightest stress. It receives and transmits every 
   vibration without retaining any. It becomes poisonous when its oxygen is defiled 
   by passing through human lungs. 
 </p><p> There is a peculiar frame of mind necessary to successful divination. The 
   conditions of the problem are difficult. It is obviously necessary for the mind 
   of the diviner to be concentrated absolutely upon his question. Any intrusive 
   thought will confuse the oracle as certainly as the reader of a newspaper is 
   confused when he reads a paragraph into which a few lines have strayed from 
   another column. It is equally necessary that the muscles with which he manipulates 
   the apparatus of divination must be entirely independent of any volition of 
   his. He must lend them for the moment to the intelligence whom he is consulting, 
   to be guided in their movement to make the necessary mechanical actions which 
   determine the physical factor of the operation. It will be obvious that this 
   is somewhat awkward for the diviner who is also a magician, for as a magician 
   he has been constantly at work to keep all his forces under his own control, 
   and to prevent the slightest interference with them by any alien Will. It is, 
   in fact, commonly the case, or so says the experience of The MASTER THERION, 
   that the most promising Magicians are the most deplorable diviners, and vice 
   versa. It is only when the aspirant approaches perfection that he becomes able 
   to reconcile these two apparently opposing faculties. Indeed, there is no surer 
   sign of all-round success than this ability to put the whole of one's powers 
   at the service of any type of task. 
 </p><p> With regard to the mind, again, it would seem that concentration on the question 
   makes more difficult the necessary detachment from it. Once again, the diviner 
   stands in need of a considerable degree of attainment in the practices of meditation. 
   He must have succeeded in destroying the tendency of the ego to interfere with 
   the object of thought. He must be able to conceive of a thing out of all relation 
   with anything else. The regular practice of concentration leads to this result; 
   in fact, it destroys the thing itself as we have hitherto conceived it; for 
   the nature of things is always veiled from us by our habit of regarding them 
   as in essential relation without ourselves and our reactions toward them. 
 </p><p> One can hardly expect the diviner to make Samadhi with his question --- that 
   would be going too far, and destroy the character of the operation by removing 
   the question from the class of concatenated ideas. It would mean interpreting 
   the question in terms of "without limit", and this imply an equally formless 
   answer. But he should approximate to this extreme sufficiently to allow the 
   question entire freedom to make for itself its own proper links with the intelligence 
   directing the answer, preserving its position on its own plane, and evoking 
   the necessary counterpoise to its own deviation from the norm of nothingness. 
 </p><p> We may recapitulate the above reflections in a practical form. We will suppose 
   that one wishes to divine by geomancy whether or no one should marry, it being 
   assumed that one's emotional impulses suggest so rash a course. The man takes 
   his wand and his sand; the traces the question, makes the appropriate pentagram, 
   and the sigil of the spirit. Before tracing the dashes which are to determine 
   the four "Mothers", he must strictly examine himself. He must banish from his 
   mind every thought which can possibly act as an attachment to his proposed partner. 
   He must banish all thoughts which concern himself, those of apprehension no 
   less than those of ardour. He must carry his introspection as far as possible. 
   He must observe with all the subtlety at his command whether it pains him to 
   abandon any of these thoughts. So long as his mind is stirred, however slightly, 
   by one single aspect of the subject, he is not fit to begin to form the figure. 
   He must sink his personality in that of the intelligence hearing the question 
   propounded by a stranger to whom he is indifferent, but whom it is his business 
   to serve faithfully. He must now run over the whole affair in his mind, making 
   sure of this utter aloofness therefrom. He must also make sure that his muscles 
   are perfectly free to respond to the touch of the Will of that intelligence. 
   (It is of course understood that he has not become so familiar with geomancy 
   by dint of practice as to be able to calculate subconsciously what figures he 
   will form; for this would vitiate the experiment entirely. It is, in fact, one 
   of the objections to geomancy that sooner or later one does become aware at 
   the time of tracing them whether the dots are going to be even or odd. This 
   needs a special training to correct). 
 </p><p> Physio-psychological theory will probably maintain that the "automatic" action 
   of the hand is controlled by the brain no less than in the case of conscious 
   volition; but this is an additional argument for identifying the brain with 
   the intelligence invoked. 
 </p><p> Having thus identified himself as closely as possible with that intelligence, 
   and concentrated on the question as if the "prophesying spirit" were giving 
   its whole attention thereto, he must await the impulse to trace the marks on 
   the sand; and, as soon as it comes let it race to the finish. Here arises another 
   technical difficulty. One has to make 16 rows of dots; and, especially for the 
   beginner, the mind has to grapple with the apprehension lest the hand fail to 
   execute the required number. It is also troubled by fearing to exceed; but excess 
   does not matter. Extra lines are simply null and void, so that the best plan 
   is to banish that thought, and make sure only of not stopping too soon. 
 </p><blockquote><em>Practice soon teaches one to count subconsciously ... yes, and 
   that is the other difficulty again!</em></blockquote>
 <p> The lines being traced, the operation is over as far as spiritual qualities 
   are required, for a time. The process of setting up the figure for judgment 
   is purely mechanical. 
 </p><p> But, in the judgment, the diviner stands once more in need of his inmost and 
   utmost attainments. He should exhaust the intellectual sources of information 
   at his disposal, and form from them his judgment. But having done this, he should 
   detach his mind from what it has just formulated, and proceed to concentrate 
   it on the figure as a whole, almost as if it were the object of his meditation. 
   One need hardly repeat that in both these operations detachment from one's personal 
   partialities is as necessary as it was in the first part of the work. In setting 
   up the figure, bias would beget a Freudian phantasm to replace the image of 
   truth which the figure ought to be; and it is not too much to say that the entire 
   subconscious machinery of the body and mind lends itself with horrid willingness 
   to this ape-like antic of treason. But now that the figure stands for judgment, 
   the same bias would tend to form its phantasm of wish-fulfilment in a different 
   manner. It would act through the mind to bewray sound judgment. It might, for 
   example, induce one to emphasize the Venereal element in Puella at the expense 
   of the Saturnian. It might lead one to underrate the influence of a hostile 
   figure, or to neglect altogether some element of importance. The MASTER THERION 
   has known cases where the diver was so afraid of an unfavourable answer that 
   he made actual mistakes in the simple mechanical construction of the figure! 
   Finally, in the summing up; it is fatally easy to slur over unpleasantness, 
   and to breathe on the tiniest spark that promises to kindle the tinder --- the 
   rotten rags! --- of hope. 
 </p><p> The concluding operation is therefore to obtain a judgment of the figure, 
   independent of all intellectual or moral restraint. One must endeavour to apprehend 
   it as a thing absolute in itself. One must treat it, in short, very much the 
   same as one did the question; as a mystical entity, till now unrelated with 
   other phenomena. One must, so to speak, adore it as a god, uncritically: "Speak, 
   Lord, for thy servant heareth." It must be allowed to impose its intrinsic individuality 
   on the mind, to put its fingers independently on whatever notes it pleases. 
 </p><p> In this way one obtains an impression of the true purport of the answer; and 
   one obtains it armed with a sanction superior to any sensible suggestions. It 
   comes from and to a part of the individual which is independent of the influence 
   of environment; is adjusted to that environment by true necessity, and not by 
   the artifices of such adaptations as our purblind conception of convenience 
   induces us to fabricate. 
 </p><p> The student will observe from the above that divination is in one sense an 
   art entirely separate from that of Magick; yet it interpenetrates Magick at 
   every point. The fundamental laws of both are identical. The right use of divination 
   has already been explained; but it must be added that proficiency therein, tremendous 
   as is its importance in furnishing the Magician with the information necessary 
   to his strategical and tactical plans, in no wise enables him to accomplish 
   the impossible. It is not within the scope of divination to predict the future 
   (for example) with the certainty of an astronomer in calculating the return 
   of a comet. 
 </p><blockquote><em>The astronomer himself has to enter a caveat. He can only calculate 
   the probability on the observed facts. Some force might interfere with the anticipated 
   movement.</em></blockquote>
 <p> There is always much virtue in divination; for (Shakespeare assures us!) there 
   is "much virtue in IF"! 
 </p><p> In estimating the ultimate value of a divinatory judgment, one must allow 
   for more than the numerous sources of error inherent in the process itself. 
   The judgment can do no more than the facts presented to it warrant. It is naturally 
   impossible in most cases to make sure that some important factor has not been 
   omitted. In asking, "shall I be wise to marry?" one leaves it open for wisdom 
   to be defined in divers ways. One can only expect an answer in the sense of 
   the question. The connotation of "wise" would then imply the limitations "in 
   your private definition of wisdom", "in reference to your present circumstances." 
   It would not involve guarantee against subsequent disaster, or pronounce a philosophical 
   dictum as to wisdom in the abstract sense. One must not assume that the oracle 
   is omniscient. By the nature of the case, on the contrary, it is the utterance 
   of a being whose powers are partial and limited, though not to such an extent, 
   or in the same directions, as one's own. But a man who is advised to purchase 
   a certain stock should not complain if a general panic knocks the bottom out 
   of it a few weeks later. The advice only referred to the prospects of the stock 
   in itself. The divination must not be blamed any more than one would blame a 
   man for buying a house at Ypres there years before the World-War. 
 </p><p> As against this, one must insist that it is obviously to the advantage of 
   the diviner to obtain this information from beings of the most exalted essence 
   available. An old witch who has a familiar spirit of merely local celebrity 
   such as the toad in her tree, can hardly expect him to tell her much more of 
   private matters than her parish magazine does of public. It depends entirely 
   on the Magician how he is served. The greater the man, the greater must be his 
   teacher. It follows that the highest forms of communicating daemons, those who 
   know, so to speak, the court secrets, disdain to concern themselves with matters 
   which they regard as beneath them. One must not make the mistake of calling 
   in a famous physician to one's sick Pekinese. One must also beware of asking 
   even the cleverest angel a question outside his ambit. A heart specialist should 
   not prescribe for throat trouble. 
 </p><p> The Magician ought therefore to make himself master of several methods of 
   divination; using one or the other as the purpose of the moment dictates. He 
   should make a point of organizing a staff of such spirits to suit various occasions. 
   These should be "familiar"spirits, in the strict sense; members of his family. 
   He should deal with them constantly, avoiding whimsical or capricious changes. 
   He should choose them so that their capacities cover the whole ground of his 
   work; but he should not multiply them unnecessarily, for he makes himself responsible 
   for each one that he employs. Such spirits should be ceremonially evoked to 
   visible or semi-visible appearance. A strict arrangement should be made and 
   sworn. This must be kept punctiliously by the Magician, and its infringement 
   by the spirit severely punished. Relations with these spirits should be confirmed 
   and encouraged by frequent intercourse. They should be treated with courtesy, 
   consideration, and even affection. They should be taught to love and respect 
   their master, and to take pride in being trusted by him. 
 </p><p> It is sometimes better to act on the advice of a spirit even when one knows 
   it to be wrong, though in such a case one must take the proper precautions against 
   an undesirable result. The reason for this is that spirits of this type are 
   very sensitive. They suffer agonies of remorse on realising that they have injured 
   their Master; for he is their God; they know themselves to be part of him, their 
   aim is to attain to absorption in him. They understand therefore that his interests 
   are theirs. Care must be taken to employ none but spirits who are fit for the 
   purpose, not only by reason of their capacity to supply information, but for 
   their sympathy with the personality of the Magician. Any attempt to coerce unwilling 
   spirits is dangerous. They obey from fear; their fear makes them flatter, and 
   tell amiable falsehoods. It also creates phantasmal projections of themselves 
   to personate them; and these phantasms, besides being worthless, become the 
   prey of malicious daemons who use them to attack the Magician in various ways 
   whose prospect of success is enhanced by the fact that he has himself created 
   a link with them. 
 </p><p> One more observation seems desirable while on this subject. Divination of 
   any kind is improper in matters directly concerning the Great Work itself. In 
   the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel, the adept is possessed 
   of all he can possibly need. To consult any other is to insult one's Angel. 
   Moreover, it is to abandon the only person who really knows, and really cares, 
   in favour of one who by the nature of the case, must be ignorant 
 </p><blockquote><em>No intelligence of the type that operates divination is a complete 
   Microcosm as Man is. He knows in perfection what lies within his own Sphere, 
   and little or nothing beyond it. Graphiel knows all that is knowable about Marital 
   matters, as no Man can possibly do. For even the most Marital man is limited 
   as to Madim by the fact that Mars is only one element in his molecule; the other 
   elements both inhibit concentration on their colleague, and veil him by insisting 
   on his being interpreted in reference to themselves. No entity whose structure 
   does not include the entire Tree of Life is capable of the Formulae of Initiation. 
   Graphiel, consulted by the Aspirants to Adeptship, would be bound to regard 
   the Great Work as purely a question of combat, and ignore all other considerations. 
   His advice would be absolute on technical points of this kind; but its very 
   perfection would persuade the Aspirant to an unbalance course of action which 
   would entail failure and destruction. It is pertinent to mention in this connection 
   that one must not expect absolute information as to what is going to happen. 
   "Fortune-telling" is an abuse of divination. At the utmost one can only ascertain 
   what may reasonably be expected. The proper function of the process is to guide 
   one's judgment. Diagnosis is fairly reliable; advice may be trusted, generally 
   speaking; but prognosis should always be cautious. The essence of the business 
   is the consultation of specialists.</em></blockquote>
 <p> of the essence of the matter --- one whose interest in it is no more (at the 
   best) than that of a well-meaning stranger. It should go without saying that 
   until the Magician has attained to the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy 
   Guardian Angel he is liable to endless deceptions. He does not know Himself; 
   how can he explain his business to others? How can those others, though they 
   do their best for him, aid in anything but trifles? One must therefore be prepared 
   for disappointment at every stage until one attains to adeptship. 
 </p><p> This is especially true of divination, because the essence of the horror of 
   not knowing one's Angel is the utter bewilderment and anguish of the mind, complicated 
   by the persecution of the body, and envenomed by the ache of the soul. One puts 
   the wrong questions, and puts them wrong; gets the wrong answers, judges them 
   wrong, and acts wrongly upon them. One must nevertheless persist, aspiring with 
   ardour towards one's Angel, and comforted by the assurance that He is guiding 
   one secretly towards Himself, and that all one's mistakes are necessary preparations 
   for the appointed hour of meeting Him. Each mistake is the combing-out of some 
   tangle in the hair of the bride as she is being coiffed for marriage. 
 </p><p> On the other hand, although the adept is in daily communication with his Angel, 
   he ought to be careful to consult Him only on questions proper to the dignity 
   of the relation. One should not consult one's Angel on too many details, or 
   indeed on any matters which come within the office of one's familiar spirits. 
   One does not go the the King about petty personal trifles. The romance and rapture 
   of the ineffable union which constitutes Adeptship must not be profaned by the 
   introduction of commonplace cares. One must not appear with one's hair in curl-papers, 
   or complain of the cook's impertinence, if one wants to make the most of the 
   honeymoon. 
 </p><blockquote><em>As the poet puts it; "Psyche, beware how thou disclose Thy tricks 
   of toilet to Eros, Or let him learn that those love-breathing Lyrical lips that 
   whisper, wreathing His brows with sense-bewitching gold, Are equally expert 
   to scold; That those caressing hands will maybe Yet box his ears and slap the 
   baby!"</em></blockquote>
 <p> To the Adept divination becomes therefore a secondary consideration, although 
   he can now employ it with absolute confidence, and probably use it with far 
   greater frequency than before his attainment. Indeed, this is likely in proportion 
   as he learns that resort to divination (on every occasion when his Will does 
   not instantly instruct him) with implicit obedience to its counsels careless 
   as to whether or no they may land him in disaster, is a means admirably efficacious 
   of keeping his mind untroubled by external impressions, and therefore in the 
   proper condition to receive the reiterant strokes of rapture with which the 
   love of his Angel ravishes him. 
 </p><p> We have now mapped out the boundaries of possibility and propriety which define 
   the physical and political geography of divination. The student must guard himself 
   constantly against supposing that this art affords any absolute means of discovering 
   "truth", or indeed, of using that word as if it meant more than the relation 
   of two ideas each of which is itself as subject to "change without notice" as 
   a musical programme. 
 </p><p> Divination, in the nature of things, can do no more than put the mind of the 
   querent into conscious connection with another mind whose knowledge of the subject 
   at issue is to his own as that of an expert to a layman. The expert is not infallible. 
   The client may put his question in a misleading manner, or even base it on a 
   completely erroneous conception of the facts. He may misunderstand the expert's 
   answer, and he may misinterpret its purport. Apart from all this, excluding 
   all error, both question and answer are limited in validity by their own conditions; 
   and these conditions are such that truth may cease to be true, either as time 
   goes on, or if it be flawed by the defect of failure to consider some circumstances 
   whose concealed operation cancels the contract. 
 </p><p> In a word, divination, like any other science, is justified of its children. 
   It would be extraordinary should so fertile a mother be immune from still-births, 
   monstrosities, and abortions. 
 </p><p> We none of us dismiss our servant science with a kick and a curse every time 
   the telephone gets out of order. The telephone people make no claim that it 
   always works and always works right. 
 </p><blockquote><em>Except in New York City.</em></blockquote>
 <p> Divination, with equal modesty, admits that "it often goes wrong; but it works 
   well enough, all things considered. The science is in its infancy. All we can 
   do is our best. We no more pretend to infallibility than the mining expert who 
   considers himself in luck if he hits the bull's eye four times in ten." 
 </p><p> The error of all dogmatists (from the oldest prophet with his "literally-inspired 
   word of God" to the newest German professor with his single-track explanation 
   of the Universe) lies in trying to prove too much, in defending themselves against 
   critics by stretching a probably excellent theory to include all the facts and 
   the fables, until it bursts like the overblown bladder it is. 
 </p><p> Divination is no more than a rough and ready practical method which we understand 
   hardly at all, and operate only as empirics. Success for the best diviner alive 
   is no more certain in any particular instance than a long putt by a champion 
   golfer. Its calculations are infinitely more complex than Chess, a Chess played 
   on an infinite board with men whose moves are indeterminate, and made still 
   more difficult by the interference of imponderable forces and unformulated laws; 
   while its conduct demands not only the virtues, themselves rare enough, of intellectual 
   and moral integrity, but intuition combining delicacy with strength in such 
   perfection and to such extremes as to make its existence appear monstrous and 
   miraculous against Nature. 
 </p><p> To admit this is not to discredit oracles. On the contrary, the oracles fell 
   into disrepute just because they pretended to do more than they could. To divine 
   concerning a matter is little more than to calculate probabilities. We obtain 
   the use of minds who have access to knowledge beyond ours, but not to omniscience. 
   HRU, the great angel set over the Tarot, is beyond us as we are beyond the ant; 
   but, for all we know, the knowledge of HRU is excelled by some mightier mind 
   in the same proportion. Nor have we any warrant for accusing HRU of ignorance 
   or error if we read the Tarot to our own delusion. He may have known, he may 
   have spoken truly; the fault may lie with our own insight. 
 </p><blockquote><em>The question of the sense in which an answer is true arises. One 
   {WEH NOTE: sic, interpolate "should"} not mix up the planes. Yet as Mr. Russell 
   shows, "Op Cit. p". 61, the worlds which lie behind phenomena must possess the 
   same structure as our own. "Every proposition having a communicable significance 
   must lie in just that essence of individuality which, for that very reason, 
   is irrelevant to science". Just so: but this is to confess the impotence of 
   science to attain truth, and to admit the urgency of developing a mental instrument 
   of superior capacity.</em></blockquote>
 <p> The MASTER THERION has observed on innumerable occasions that divinations, 
   made by him and dismissed as giving untrue answers, have justified themselves 
   months or years later when he was able to revise his judgment in perspective, 
   untroubled by his personal passion. 
 </p><p> It is indeed surprising how often the most careless divinations give accurate 
   answers. When things go wrong, it is almost always possible to trace the error 
   to one's own self-willed and insolent presumption in insisting that events shall 
   accommodate themselves to our egoism and vanity. It is comically unscientific 
   to adduce examples of the mistakes of the diviners as evidence that their art 
   is fatuous. Every one knows that the simplest chemical experiments often go 
   wrong. Every one knows the eccentricities of fountain pens; but nobody outside 
   Evangelical circles makes fun of the Cavendish experiment, or asserts that, 
   if fountain pens undoubtedly work now and then, their doing so is merely coincidence. 
 </p><p> The fact of the case is that the laws of nature are incomparably more subtle 
   than even science suspects. The phenomena of every plane are intimately interwoven. 
   The arguments of Aristotle were dependent on the atmospheric pressure which 
   prevented his blood from boiling away. There is nothing in the universe which 
   does not influence every other thing in one way or another. There is no reason 
   in Nature why the apparently chance combination of half-a dozen sticks of tortoise-shell 
   should not be so linked both with the human mind and with the entire structure 
   of the Universe that the observation of their fall should not enable us to measure 
   all things in heaven and earth. 
 </p><p> With one piece of curved glass we have discovered uncounted galaxies of suns; 
   with another, endless orders of existence in the infinitesimal. With the prism 
   we have analysed light so that matter and force have become intelligible only 
   as forms of light. With a rod we have summoned the invisible energies of electricity 
   to be our familiar spirit serving us to do our Will, whether it be to outsoar 
   the condor, or to dive deeper into the demon world of disease than any of our 
   dreamers dared to dream. 
 </p><p> Since with four bits of common glass mankind has learnt to know so much, achieved 
   so much, who dare deny that the Book of Thoth, the quintessentialized wisdom 
   of our ancestors whose civilizations, perished though they be, have left monuments 
   which dwarf ours until we wonder whether we are degenerate from them, or evolved 
   from Simians, who dare deny that such a book may be possessed of unimaginable 
   powers? 
 </p><p> It is not so long since the methods of modern science were scoffed at by the 
   whole cultured world. In the sacred halls themselves the roofs rang loud with 
   the scornful laughter of the high priests as each new postulant approached with 
   his unorthodox offering. There is hardly a scientific discovery in history which 
   was not decried as quackery by the very men whose own achievements were scarce 
   yet recognized by the world at large. 
 </p><p> Within the memory of the present generation, the possibility of aeroplanes 
   was derisively denied by those very engineers accounted most expert to give 
   their opinions. 
 </p><p> The method of divination, the "ratio" of it, is as obscure to-day as was that 
   of spectrum analysis a generation ago. That the chemical composition of the 
   fixed stars should become known to man seemed an insane imagining too ridiculous 
   to discuss. To-day it seems equally irrational to enquire of the desert sand 
   concerning the fate of empires. Yet surely it, if any one knows, should know! 
 </p><p> To-day it may sound impossible for inanimate objects to reveal the inmost 
   secrets of mankind and nature. We cannot say why divination is valid. We cannot 
   trace the process by which it performs it marvels. 
 </p><blockquote><em>The main difference between a Science and an Art is that the former 
   admits mensuration. Its processes must be susceptible of the application of 
   quantitative standards. Its laws reject imponderable variables. Science despises 
   Art for its refusal to conform with calculable conditions. But even to-day, 
   in the boasted Age of Science, man is still dependent on Art as to most matters 
   of practical importance to him; the arts of Government, of War, of Literature, 
   etc. are supremely influential, and Science does little more than facilitate 
   them by making their materials mechanically docile. The utmost extension of 
   Science can merely organize the household of Art. Art thus progresses in perception 
   and power by increased control or automatic accuracy of its details. The MASTER 
   THERION has made an Epoch in the Art of Magick by applying the Method of Science 
   to its problems. His Work is a contribution of unique value, comparable only 
   to that of those men of genius who revolutionized the empirical guesswork of 
   "natural philosophers". The Magicians of to-morrow will be armed with mathematical 
   theory, organized observation, and experimentally-verified practice. But their 
   Art will remain inscrutable as ever in essence; talent will never supplant genius. 
   Education is impotent to produce a poet greater than Robert Burns; the perfection 
   of laboratory apparatus prepares indeed the path of a Pasteur, but cannot make 
   masters of mediocrities.</em></blockquote>
 <p> But the same objections apply equally well to the telephone. No man knows 
   what electricity is, or the nature of the forces which determine its action. 
   We know only that by doing certain things we get certain results, and that the 
   least error on our part will bring our work to naught. The same is exactly true 
   of divination. The difference between the two sciences is not more than this: 
   that, more minds having been at work on the former we have learnt to master 
   its tricks with greater success than in the case of the latter.</p></in></p></body>
