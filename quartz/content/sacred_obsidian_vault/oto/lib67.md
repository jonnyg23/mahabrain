 <blockquote> 
   <blockquote> 
     <p>I flung out of chapel and church<br>
       Temple and hall an meeting-room <br>
       Venus' Bower and Osiris' Tomb, <br>
       and left the devil in the lurch, <br>
       While God got lost in the crowd of gods, <br>
       And soul went down in the turbid tide <br>
       Of the metaphysical Lotus-eyed, <br>
       And I was -- anyhow, what's the odds? <br>
       [...] <br>
       Yet by-and-by I hope to weave <br>
       A song of Anti-Christmas Eve <br>
       And First- and Second-Beast-er Day. <br>
       There's one who loves me dearly (vrai!) <br>
       Who yet believes me sprung from Tophet, <br>
       Either the Beast or the False Prophet; <br>
       And by all sorts of monkey tricks <br>
       Adds up my name to Six Six Six. <br>
       Retire, good Gallup! In such strife her <br>
       Superior skill makes <em>you</em> a cipher! <br>
       Ho! I adopt the number. Look <br>
       At the quaint wrapper of this book! <br>
       I will deserve it if I can: It is the number of a Man. </p>

 <blockquote> 
   <blockquote> 
     <p>I find some folks think me (for one) <br>
       So great a fool that I disclaim <br>
       Indeed Jehovah's hate for shame <br>
       That man to-day should not be weaned <br>
       Of worshipping so foul a fiend <br>
       In presence of the living Sun, <br>
       And yet replace him oiled and clean <br>
       By the Egyptian Pantheon, <br>
       The same thing by another name. <br>
       Thus when of late Egyptian Gods <br>
       Evoked ecstatic periods <br>
       In verse of mine, you thought I praised <br>
       Or worshipped them -- I stand amazed. <br>
       I merely wished to chant in verse <br>
       Some aspects of the Universe, <br>
       Summed up these subtle forces finely, <br>
       And sang of them (I think divinely) <br>
       In name and form; a fault perhaps -- <br>
       Reviewers are such funny chaps! <br>
       I think that ordinary folk, <br>
       Though, understood the things I spoke. <br>
       For Gods, and devils too, I find <br>
       Are merely modes of my own mind! </p>
