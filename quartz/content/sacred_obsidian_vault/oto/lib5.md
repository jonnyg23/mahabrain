 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The title is Latin and means Book 5 or Book of the Prince. 
     Regulus is also the name of the star which marks the beginning or 0 degree 
     of the constellation Leo.] </em></font></p>

 <h2 align="center"><font size="4">THE FIRST GESTURE. </font></h2>
 <h3><font size="3">The Oath of the Enchantment, which is called The Elevenfold 
   Seal.</font></h3>
 <h4><em>The Animadversion towards the Aeon.</em></h4>
 <p>1. Let the Magician, robed and armed as he may deem to be fit, turn his face 
   towards Boleskine, that is the House of The Beast 666. {Note 1: Boleskine House 
   is on Loch Ness, 17 miles from Inverness, Latitude 57.14 N. Longitude 4.28 W.}</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[Note that this implies that the direction of Boleskine 
     should be taken as "East" in the temple, as is specified in Liber 
     XV, the Gnostic Mass. However it does not </em><em><em>necessarily</em></em><em> 
     have to be so. <br>
     Since later the text specifies that the Magician must grasp his Wand, the 
     "robed and armed as he may deem to be fit" is not as wide-ranging 
     as it may sound.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>2. Let him strike the battery 1-3-3-3-1.</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[Eleven knocks, eleven being the number of magical energy 
     - see Liber AL I, 60. Note that there are four sets of eleven knocks during 
     the complete ritual, making 44 in total, representing the materialisation 
     of magical energy, and also being a number of Ra-Hoor-Khuit. See Liber XLIV, 
     The Mass of the Phoenix.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>3. Let him put the Thumb of his right hand between its index and medius, and 
   make the gestures hereafter following.</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The thumb being the finger attributed to Spirit, and 
     also containing an important centre of cakkric energy. Again see also Liber 
     XV.]</em> </font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <h4><em>The Vertical Component of the Enchantment.</em></h4>
 <p>1. Let him describe a circle about his head, crying <strong>NUIT</strong>!</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The Sahashara Cakkra, above the head, attributed to Ain 
     Soph on the Tree of Life.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>2. Let him draw the Thumb vertically downward and touch the Muladhara Cakkra, 
   crying, <strong>HADIT</strong>!</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The Muladhara (Earth centre, attributed to Malkuth on 
     the Tree of Life) is found at the base of the spine, or at the perineum just 
     behind the genital region, opinions differ. I'd suggest the latter in practice, 
     since touching the base of the spine during the rite is somewhat awkward.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>3. Let him, retracing the line, touch the centre of his breast and cry <strong>RA-HOOR-KHUIT</strong>!</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The Anahata Cakkra - the solar centre, attributed to 
     Tiphareth, or perhaps more accurately to the triangle Chesed, Geburah, Tiphareth. 
     This will especially make sense to initiates of the Second Degree of OTO. 
     Note that the symbol of Ra-Hoor-Khuit is a downward pointing red triangle 
     of fire.]</em> </font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <h4><em>The Horizontal Components of the Enchantment.</em></h4>
 <p>1. Let him touch the Centre of his Forehead, his mouth, and his larynx, crying 
   <strong>AIWAZ</strong>!</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The centre of the forehead is the location of the Ajna 
     Cakkra, the larynx the location of the Vishuddha Cakkra, attributed to Saturn 
     and Da'ath. The mouth is the only one of these which is not a primary Cakkra 
     - perhaps because Aiwaz is the voice of the Gods - see Liber AL. Interestingly 
     the mouth is a minor Cakkra - the Kala Cakkra.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>2. Let him draw his thumb from right to left across his face at the level of 
   the nostrils.</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[This forms the cross-path on the Tree of Life from Binah 
     to Chokmah , the path of The Empress]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>3. Let him touch the centre of his breast, and his solar plexus, crying, <strong>THERION</strong>!</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The Anahata again and the Manipura. Both of these together 
     are attributed to the Chesed, Geburah, Tiphareth triangle; I know this is 
     odd, but that's just one of the problems of trying to relate two widely varying 
     systems. The Tree of Life has only five Sephiroth on the Middle Pillar, whereas 
     the yoga system used here has seven primary Cakkras.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>4. Let him draw his thumb from left to right across his breast, at the level 
   of the sternum.</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The cross-path linking Chesed to Geburah, the path of 
     Lust]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>5. Let him touch the Svadistthana, and the Muladhara Cakkra, crying, <strong>BABALON</strong>!</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The Svadistthana is located in the genital region, attributed 
     to Yesod and the Moon.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>6. Let him draw his thumb from right to left across his abdomen, at the level 
   of the hips.</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The cross-path linking Hod and Netzach on the Tree, the 
     path of The Tower. Note that the numerological value of the three cross-paths 
     added together is 93. I don't know why the crossbars go in these directions. 
     They do </em><em><em>not</em></em><em> follow the path of the Lightning Flash 
     as it shoots downward from Kether to Malkuth - perhaps there may be a reference 
     to the direction of spin of the cakkras.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>(Thus shall he formulate the Sigil of the Grand Hierophant, but dependent from 
   the Circle.)</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The Sigil of the Grand Hierophant being the triple cross.]</em> 
     </font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <h4><em>The Asseveration of the Spells.</em></h4>
 <p>1. Let the Magician clasp his hands upon his Wand, his fingers and thumbs interlaced, 
   crying <strong>LAShTAL</strong>! <strong>THELEMA</strong>! <strong>FIAOF</strong>! 
   <strong>AGAPE</strong>! <strong>AUMGN</strong>! <br>
   (Thus shall be declared the Words of Power whereby the Energies of the Aeon 
   of Horus work his will in the World.)</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[Each of these Words has the numerical value of 93. Since 
     there are five of them and they are repeated once, plus an extra THELEMA in 
     the middle, there are a total of 11 "93" Words in the rite. Note 
     that the F's in FIAOF are silent, as is the GN in AUMGN. For more on these 
     words see Book 4 Part III, Magick in Theory &amp; Practice.<br>
     Furthermore, in this First Gesture there are six god names mentioned: Nuit, 
     Hadit, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, Aiwaz, Therion, Babalon; and five "93" words. 
     Eleven invocations in total, thus is it named The Elevenfold Seal. The combination 
     of the six and five is a very important facet of the rite - see section 23, 
     lines h &amp; i.] </em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <h4><font size="2">The Proclamation of the Accomplishment.</font></h4>
 <p>1. Let the Magician strike the Battery: 3-5-3, crying <strong>ABRAHADABRA</strong>.</p>
 <h2 align="center"><font size="4">The SECOND GESTURE. </font></h2>
 <h4><em>The Enchantment.</em></h4>
 <p>1. Let the Magician, still facing Boleskine, advance to the circumference of 
   his circle.<br>
   2. Let him turn himself towards the left, and pace with the stealth and swiftness 
   of a tiger the precincts of his circle, until he complete one revolution thereof.<br>
   3. Let him give the Sign of Horus (or The Enterer) as he passeth, so to project 
   the force that radiateth from Boleskine before him.</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[This sign is made by leaning forward, advancing the left 
     foot and throwing the arms out horizontally before you, pointing with the 
     index fingers as if to fire energy out of them.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>4. Let him pace his path until he comes to the North; there let him halt, and 
   turn his face to the North.</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[That is you go round one and a quarter times]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>5. Let him trace with his wand the Averse Pentagram proper to invoke Air (Aquarius).</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[An averse pentagram is one with the single point down, 
     two points up. The Averse Air pentagram is drawn by starting at the bottom 
     left point and going horizontally across to the right, then up left, down 
     middle, up right, down left. i.e. go widdershins (anti-clockwise). In other 
     words it is like an upright Air Pentagram rotated through 180 degrees.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>6. Let him bring the wand to the centre of the Pentagram and call upon <strong>NUIT</strong>!</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[You should visualise the particular God or Goddess called 
     in each quarter. If in doubt use the Tarot imagery. For Nuit, see Atu XVII, 
     The Star; Atu XX, The Aeon; or Atu XXI, The Universe.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>7. Let him make the sign called Puella, standing with his feet together, head 
   bowed, his left hand shielding the Muladhara Cakkra, and his right hand shielding 
   his breast (attitude of the Venus de Medici).</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[And where do you hold the wand while you're doing this? 
     One solution is to grip it between your knees when you're making these signs. 
     Yes, I know it doesn't sound too elegant, but it works.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>8. Let him turn again to the left, and pursue his Path as before, projecting 
   the force from Boleskine as he passeth; let him halt when he next cometh to 
   the South and face outward.</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[i.e. go round one half circle]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>9. Let him trace the Averse Pentagram that invoketh Fire (Leo).</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[Start bottom middle and go deosil (clockwise) i.e. go 
     up left and then round until you've completed the entire pentagram.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>10. Let him point his wand to the centre of the Pentagram, and cry, <strong>HADIT</strong>!</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[See Atu XX, The Aeon - Hadit is the winged disk.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>11. Let him give the sign Puer, standing with feet together, and head erect. 
   Let his right hand (the thumb extended at right angles to the fingers) be raised, 
   the forearm vertical at a right angle with the upper arm, which is horizontally 
   extended in the line joining the shoulders. Let his left hand, the thumb extended 
   forwards and the fingers clenched, rest at the junction of the thighs (Attitude 
   of the gods Mentu, Khem, etc.).</p>
 <p>12. Let him proceed as before; then in the East, let him make the Averse Pentagram 
   that invoketh Earth (Taurus).</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[This time go round a quarter circle. The pentagram is 
     drawn from bottom middle widdershins towards the upper right point and so 
     on.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>13. Let him point his wand to the centre of the pentagram, and cry, <strong>THERION</strong>!</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[See Atu XI, Lust - Therion is the Beast pictured.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>14. Let him give the sign called Vir, the feet being together. The hands, with 
   clenched finger and thumbs thrust out forwards, are held to the temples; the 
   head is then bowed and pushed out, as if to symbolize the butting of an horned 
   beast (attitude of Pan, Bacchus, etc.). (Frontispiece, Equinox I, III).</p>
 <p>15. Proceeding as before, let him make in the West the Averse Pentagram whereby 
   Water is invoked.</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The Averse pentagram of Water: start at the bottom right 
     and go across to the bottom left and thus round deosil. Note that the pentagrams 
     change direction each time - first widdershins, then deosil, then widdershins 
     again, then deosil.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>16. Pointing the wand to the centre of the Pentagram, let him call upon <strong>BABALON</strong>!</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[See Atu XI again - Babalon is the Goddess riding on the 
     Beast. Note that you "call upon" Nuit &amp; Babalon but "cry" 
     the other names. This may be significant in that the LA (feminine) forces 
     are perceived as lying outside the direct sphere of your influence, and are 
     requested in a softer manner than the masculine forces.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>17. Let him give the sign Mulier. The feet are widely separated, and the arms 
   raised so as to suggest a crescent. The head is thrown back (attitude of Baphomet, 
   Isis in Welcome, the Microcosm of Vitruvius). (See Book 4, Part II).</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[You can't grip your wand between your knees here! So 
     hold it in your hand...]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>18. Let him break into the dance, tracing a centripetal spiral widdershins, 
   enriched by revolutions upon his axis as he passeth each quarter, until he come 
   to the centre of the circle. There let him halt, facing Boleskine.</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[You go round the circle one complete revolution here. 
     You've now done three and a half circles, the number of coils of the Kundalini, 
     amongst other things. Compare the Priestess's dance in Liber XV, the Gnostic 
     Mass, and note that 15 is 3x5. Also note that you have gone from Earth through 
     Air, Water, and Fire, and thus to Spirit in the centre. You have raised yourself 
     from the realm of the material to the world beyond.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>19. Let him raise the wand, trace the Mark of the Beast, and cry <strong>AIWAZ</strong>!</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The Mark of the Beast is a sign in the form of a solar 
     circle with a dot in the middle, and below it a lunar crescent with two small 
     crescents below that. You can draw it in one motion by going round the circle 
     once, then making a wider arc to draw the crescent, then going back in two 
     loops under the crescent. Yes, I know this still sounds pretty vague, but 
     it's the best I can think of right now. As the pentagrams are symbols of the 
     four material elements, so is the Mark of the Beast the symbol of Spirit. 
     Aiwaz should be visualised as "a tall dark man in his thirties, well-knit, 
     active and strong, with the face of a savage king, and eyes veiled lest their 
     gaze destroy what they saw."]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>20. Let him trace the invoking Hexagram of The Beast.</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[This is the Unicursal Hexagram, drawn from the top middle 
     point deosil towards the bottom right, top left, bottom middle, top right, 
     bottom left, top middle.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>21. Let him lower the wand, striking the Earth therewith.</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The conception here is that you are bringing the Thelemic 
     current from above down to the Earth. You are standing in both worlds and 
     can act as a bridge between them.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>22. Let him give the sign of Mater Triumphans (The feet are together; the left 
   arm is curved as if it supported a child; the thumb and index finger of the 
   right hand pinch the nipple of the left breast, as if offering it to that child). 
   Let him utter the word <strong>THELEMA</strong>!</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[The child being the Thelemic magical current that you 
     have set in motion, that you have birthed upon the Earth.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>23. Perform the spiral dance, moving deosil and whirling widdershins.</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[As you have moved widdershins before to banish, so now 
     you move deosil to invoke.]</em></font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>Each time on passing the West extend the wand to the Quarter in question, and 
   bow:</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[Note that you extend the wand to the quarter, not bow 
     to the quarter. Each time you bow to the West I assume, since bowing upwards, 
     for example, is rather difficult.]</em> </font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote> 
   <blockquote> 
     <p>a. <strong>"Before me the powers of LA!"</strong> (to West.)<br>
       b. <strong>"Behind me the powers of AL!"</strong> (to East.)<br>
       c. <strong>"On my right hand the powers of LA!"</strong> (to North.)<br>
       d. <strong>"On my left hand the powers of AL!"</strong> (to South.)<br>
       e. <strong>"Above me the powers of ShT!"</strong> (leaping in 
       the air.)<br>
       f. <strong>"Beneath me the powers of ShT!"</strong> (striking 
       the ground.) </p>
   </blockquote>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[LA means Nothing, and is directed to the West &amp; North, 
     since these are the negative, feminine quarters. AL means God, and is directed 
     to the positive, masculine quarters. Note that we do not assume that positive 
     is "better" then negative - it is simply a different polarity, as 
     in an electrical current. ShT is the child of negative and positive energies, 
     and the force that reconciles them. LA= 31, AL=31, ShT=31; thus 3x31=93]</em> 
     </font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote> 
   <blockquote> 
     <p>g. <strong>"Within me the Powers!"</strong> (in the attitude 
       of Phthah erect, the feet together, the hands clasped upon the vertical 
       wand.) </p>
   </blockquote>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[Phthah is the Creator God of Egypt. The conception is 
     that you have built your own universe. I always find that this rite increases 
     my creative powers greatly. For this reason it is to be particularly recommended 
     to all those engaged in artistic pursuits.<br>
     Note that you've now done seven more circles, which is twice three and a half. 
     So altogether in the rite you've gone round three and a half widdershins, 
     then twice three and a half deosil, making a total of three times three and 
     a half; or only once, depending on whether you count the widdershins circumnambulations 
     as a positive or negative amount.]</em> </font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote> 
   <blockquote> 
     <p>h. <strong>"About me flames my Father's face, the Star of Force and 
       Fire."</strong> </p>
   </blockquote>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[My Father is this case is Baphomet, the All-Father of 
     the Knights Templars. The Averse pentagram is occasionally drawn with Baphomet's 
     face within its points, the two upward points being the horns, the lowest 
     point his beard. See the well-known logo of the Church of Satan.]</em> </font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote> 
   <blockquote> 
     <p>i. <strong>"And in the Column stands His six-rayed Splendour!"</strong> 
     </p>

 </blockquote>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><font size="2"><em>[Note: flames, father's, face, force, fire. Five F's. 
     Qabalistically, F is Vau = 6, thus we have the 5 and 6 combined. 5x6=30.<br>
     Stands, six-rayed, splendour. Three S's. Qabalistically, S is Samekh = 60. 
     3x60=180. Plus the 30 from the previous line gives us a total of 210 = NOX.]</em></font></p>

 <p>(This dance may be omitted, and the whole utterance chanted in the attitude 
   of Phthah.)</p>
