 <p>Let the Adept be armed with his Magick Rood [and provided with his mystic rose]. 
 </p>
 <p>In the centre, let him give the L.V.X. signs; or if he know them, if he will 
   and dare do them, and can keep silent about them, the signs of N.O.X. being 
   the signs of Puer, Vir, Puella, Mulier. Omit the sign. I.R. </p>
 <p>Then let him advance to the East and make the Holy Hexagram, saying: Pater 
   et Mater unus deus Ararita. </p>
 <p>Let him go round to the South, make the Holy Hexagram and say: Mater et Filius 
   unus deus Ararita. </p>
 <p>Let him go round to the North, make the Holy Hexagram and then say: Filia et 
   Pater unus deus Ararita. </p>
 <p>Let him then return to the Centre, and so to The Centre of All (making the 
   Rosy Cross as he may know how) saying Ararita Ararita Ararita (In this the Signs 
   shall be those of Set Triumphant and of Baphomet. Also shall Set appear in the 
   Circle. Let him drink of the Sacrament and let him communicate the same.) Then 
   let him say: Omnia in Duos: Duo in Unum: Unus in Nihil: Haec nec Quatuor nec 
   Omnia nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt. </p>
 <p>Gloria Patri et Matri et Filio et Filiae et Spiritui Sancto externo et Spiritui 
   Sancto interno ut erat est erit in saecula Saeculorum sex in uno per nomen Septem 
   in uno Ararita. </p>
 <p>Let him then repeat the signs of L.V.X. but not the signs of N.O.X.: for it 
   is not he that shall arise in the Sign of Isis Rejoicing.</p>
