 <p>AT last the matter comes back into my mind.</p>
 <p>It is now five years since I discovered my stele at Bulak, but now until I 
   obtained certain initiation in the city of Benares last year did the memory 
   of my life in the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty when I was prince and priest in Thebai 
   begin to return. even now much is obscure; but I am commanded to write, so that 
   in writing the full memory may be recovered. For without the perfect knowledge 
   and understanding of that strange life by Nilus I cannot fully know and understand 
   this later life, or find that Tomb which I am appointed to find, and do that 
   therein which must be done.</p>
 <p>There fore with faith and confidence do I who was -- in a certain mystical 
   sense -- the Priest of the Princes, Ankh-f-na-khonsu, child of Ta-nech, the 
   holy and mighty one, and of Bes-na-Maut, priestess of the Starry One, set myself 
   to tell myself the strange things that befell me in that life.</p>
 <p>Thus.</p>
 <p>At my birth Aphruimis in the sign of the Lion was ascending, and in it that 
   strange hidden planet that presides over darkness and magic and forbidden love. 
   The sun was united with the planet of Amoun, but in the Abyss, as showing that 
   my power and glory should be secret, and in Aterechinis the second decanate 
   of the House of Mast, so that my passion and pleasure should likewise be unprofance. 
   In the House of Travel in the Sign of the Ram was the Moon my sweet lady. And 
   the wise men interpreted this as a token that I should travel afar; it might 
   be to the great temple at the source of mother Nile; it might be ...</p>
 <p>Foolishness! I have scarce stirred from Thebai.</p>
 <p>Yet Have I explored strange countries that they knew not of: and of this also 
   will I tell in due course.</p>
 <p>I remember -- as I never could while I lived in Khemi-land -- all the minute 
   care of my birth. For my mother was of the oldest house in Thebes, her blood 
   not only royal, but mixed with the divine. Fifty virgins in their silver tissue 
   stood about her shaking their sistrons, as if the laughter of the Gods echoed 
   the cries of the woman. By the bed stood the Priest of Horus with his heavy 
   staff, the Phoenix for its head, the prong for its foot. Watchful he stood lest 
   Sebek should rise from the abyss.</p>
 <p>On the roof of the palace watched the three chief astrologers of Pharaoh with 
   their instruments, and four armed men from the corners of the tower announced 
   each god as it rose. So these three men ached and sweated at their task; for 
   they had become most anxious. All day my birth had been expected; but as Toum 
   drew to His setting their faces grew paler than the sky; for there was one dread 
   moment in the night which all their art had failed to judge. The gods that watched 
   over it were veiled.</p>
 <p>But it seemed unlikely that Fate would so decide; yet so they feared that they 
   sent down to the priest of Thoth to say that he must at all costs avoid the 
   threatening moment, even if the lives of mother and child should pay for it; 
   and still the watchmen cried the hour. Now, now! cried the oldest of the astrologers 
   as the moment grew near -- now! Below in answer the priest of Thoth summoned 
   all his skill.</p>
 <p>When lo! a rumbling of the abyss. The palace reeled and fell; Typhon rose mighty 
   in destruction, striding across the skies. The world rocked with earthquake; 
   every star broke from its fastening and trembled.</p>
 <p>And in the midst lo! Bes-na-Maut my mother; and in her arms myself, laughing 
   in the midst of all that ruin. Yet not one living creature took the slightest 
   hurt! But the astrologers rent their robes and beat their faces on the ground; 
   for the dread moment, the Unknown Terror, had gone by; and with it I had come 
   to light.</p>
 <p>In their terror, indeed, as I learnt long after, they sent messengers to the 
   oldest and wisest of the priests; the High-priest of Nuit, who lived at the 
   bottom of a very deep well, so that his eyes, even by day, should remain fixed 
   upon the stars.</p>
 <p>But he answered them that since they had done all that they could, and Fate 
   had reversed their design, it was evident that the matter saw in the hands of 
   Fate, and that the less they meddled the better it would be for them. For he 
   was a brusque old man -- how afterwards I met him shall be written in its place.</p>
 <p>So then I was to be brought up as befitted one in my station, half-prince, 
   half-priest. I was to follow my father, hold his wand and ankh, assume his throne.</p>
 <p>And now I begin to recall some details of my preparation for that high and 
   holy task. </p>
 <p>Memory is strangely fragmentary and strangely vivid. I remember how, when I 
   had completed my fourth month, the priests took me and wrapped me in a panther's 
   skin, whose flaming gold and jet-black spots were like the sun. They carried 
   me to the river bank where the holy crocodiles were basking; and there they 
   laid me. But when they left me they refrained from the usual enchauntment against 
   the evil spirit of the crocodile; and so for three days I lay without protection. 
   Only at certain hours did my mother descend to feed me; and she too was silent, 
   being dressed as a princess only, without the sacred badges of her office.</p>
 <p>Also in the sixth month they exposed me to the Sun in the desert where was 
   no shade or clothing; and in the seventh month they laid me in a bed with a 
   sorceress, that fed on the blood of young children, and, having been in prison 
   for a long time, was bitterly an-hungered; and in the eighth month they gave 
   me the aspic of Nile, and the royal Uraeus serpent, and the deadly snake of 
   the south country, for playmates; but I passed scatheless through all these 
   trials.</p>
 <p>And in the ninth month I was weaned, and my mother bade me farewell, for never 
   again might she look upon my face, save in the secret rites of the Gods, when 
   we should meet otherwise than as babe and mother, in the garment of that Second 
   Birth which we of Khemi knew.</p>
 <p>The next six years of my life have utterly faded. All that I can recall is 
   the vision of the greatness of our city of Thebai, and the severity of my life. 
   For I lived on the back of a horse, even eating and drinking as I rode; for 
   so it becometh a prince. Also I was trained to lay about me with a sword, and 
   in the use of the bow and the spear. For it was said that Horus -- or Men Tu, 
   as we called him in Thebai -- was my Father and my God. I shall speak late of 
   that strange story of my begetting.</p>
 <p>At the end of seven years, however, so great and strong had I waxen that my 
   father took me to the old astrologer that dwelt in the well to consult him. 
   This I remember as if it were but yesterday. The journey down the great river 
   with its slow days! The creaking benches and the sweat of the slaves are still 
   in my ears and my nostrils. Then swift moments of flying foam in some rapid 
   or cataract. The great temples that we passed; the solitary Ibis of Thoth that 
   meditated on the shore; the crimson flights of birds; -- but nothing that we 
   saw upon the journey was like unto the end thereof. For in a desolate place 
   was the Well, with but a small temple beside it, where the servants -- they 
   too most holy! of that holy ancient man might dwell.</p>
 <p>And my father brought me to the mouth of the well and called thrice upon the 
   name of Nuit. Then came a voice climbing and coiling up the walls like a serpent, 
   "Let this child become priestess of the Veiled One!"</p>
 <p>Now my father was wise enough to know that the old man never made a mis- take; 
   it was only a question of a right interpretation of the oracle. Yet he was sorely 
   puzzled and distressed, for that I was a boy child. so at the risk of his life 
   -- for the old man was brusque! -- he called again and said "Behold my 
   son!"</p>
 <p>But as he spoke a shaft of sunlight smote him on the nape of the neck as he 
   bend over the well; and his face blackened, and his blood gushed forth from 
   his mouth. And the old man lapped up the blood of my father with his tongue, 
   and cried gleefully to his servants to carry me to a house of the Veiled One, 
   there to be trained in my new life.</p>
 <p>so there came forth from the little house an eunuch and a young woman exceeding 
   fair; and the eunuch saddled two horses, and we rode into the desert alone.</p>
 <p>Now though I could ride like a man, they suffered me not; but the young priestess 
   bore me in her arms. And though I ate meat like a warrior, they suffered me 
   not, but the young priestess fed me at her breast.</p>
 <p>And they took from me the armour of gilded bronze that my father had made for 
   me, scales like a crocodile's sewn upon crocodile skin that cunning men had 
   cured with salt and spices; but they wrapped me in soft green silk.</p>
 <p>So strangely we came to a little house in the desert, and that which befell 
   me there is not given me of the gods at this time to tell; but I will sleep; 
   and in the morning by their favour the memory thereof shall arise in me, even 
   in me across these thousands of years of the whirling of the earth in her course.</p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="2">CHAPTER II</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>SO for many years I grew sleek and subtle in my womans attire. And the old 
   eunuch (who was very wise) instructed me in the Art of Magic and in the worship 
   of the Veiled One, whose priestess was I destined.</p>
 <p>I remember now many things concerning those strange rituals, things too sacred 
   to write. But I will tell of an adventure that I had when I was nine years of 
   age.</p>
 <p>In one of the sacred books it is written that the secret of that subtle draught 
   which giveth vision of the star-abodes of Duant, whose sight is life eternal 
   in freedom and pleasure among the living, lieth in the use of a certain little 
   secret bone that is in the Bear of Syria. Yet how should I a child slay such 
   an one? For they had taken all weapons from me.</p>
 <p>But in a garden of the city (for we had now returned unto a house in the suburbs 
   of Thebai) was a colony of bears kept by a great lord for his pleasure. And 
   I by my cunning enticed a young bear-cub from its dam, and slew it with a great 
   stone. Then I tore off its skin and hid myself therein, taking also its jaw 
   and sharpening the same upon my stone. Then at last the old she-bear came searching 
   me, and as she put down her nose to smell at me, taking me for her cub, I drove 
   my sharpened bone into her throat.</p>
 <p>I struck with great fortune; for she coughed once, and died. </p>
 <p>Then I took her skin with great labour; and (for it was now night) began to 
   return to my house. But I was utterly weary and I could no longer climb the 
   wall. Yet I stayed awake all that night, sharpening again upon my stone the 
   jaw-bone of that bear-cub; and this time I bound it to a bough that I tore off 
   from a certain tree that grew in the garden.</p>
 <p>Now towards the morning I fell asleep, wrapped in the skin of the old she- 
   bear. And the great bear himself, the lord of the garden, saw me, and took me 
   for his mate, and came to take his pleasure of me. Then I being roused out of 
   sleep struck at his heart with all my strength as he rose over me, and quitting 
   my shelter ran among the trees. For I struck not home, or struck aslant. And 
   the old bear, sore wounded, tore up the skin of his mate; and then, discovering 
   the cheat, came after me.</p>
 <p>But by good fortune I found and wedged myself into a narrow pylon, too deep 
   for him to reach me, though I could not go through, for the door was closed 
   upon me. And in the angle of the door was an old sword disused. This was too 
   heavy for me to wield with ease; yet I lifted it, an struck feebly at the claws 
   of he bear. So much I wounded him that in his pain he dropped and withdrew and 
   began to lick his paws. Thus he forgot about me; and I, growing bolder, ran 
   out upon him. He opened his mouth; but before he could rise, I thrust the sword 
   down it. He tossed his head; and I, clinging to the sword- hilt, was thrown 
   into the air, and fell heavily upon my shoulder. My head too struck the ground; 
   and I lay stunned.</p>
 <p>When I came to myself it was that a party of men and women had thrown water 
   in my face and uttered the spells that revive from swoon. Beside me, close beside 
   me, lay mine enemy dead; and I, not forgetful of my quest, took the blade of 
   the sword (for it was snapt) and cut off the secret parts of the bear and took 
   the little bone thereof; and would have gone forth with my prize. but the great 
   lord of the house spake with me; and all his friends made as if to mock at me. 
   But the women would not have it; they came round me and petted and caressed 
   me; so that angry words were spoken.</p>
 <p>But even as they quarrelled among themselves, my guardian, the old eunuch, 
   appeared among them; for he had traced me to the garden.</p>
 <p>And when they beheld the ring of the holy ancient man the astrologer they trembled; 
   and the lord of the house threw a chain of gold around my neck, while his lady 
   gave me her own silken scarf, broidered with the loves of Isis and Nephthys, 
   and of Apis and Hathor. Nor did any dare to take from me the little bone that 
   I had won so dearly; and with it I made the spell of the Elixir, and beheld 
   the starry abodes ofDuant, even as it was written in the old wise book.</p>
 <p>But my guardians were ashamed and perplexed; for though I was so sleek and 
   subtle, yet my manhood already glowed in such deeds as this -- how should I 
   truly become the priestess of the Veiled One?</p>
 <p>Therefore they kept me closer and nursed me with luxury and flattery. I had 
   two negro slave-boys that fanned me and that fed me; I had an harp-player from 
   the great city of Memphis, that played languorous tunes. But in my mischief 
   I would constantly excite him to thoughts of war and of love; and his music 
   would grow violent and loud, so that the old eunuch, rushing in, would belabour 
   him with his staff.</p>
 <p>How well I recall that room! Large was it and lofty; and there were sculptured 
   pillars of malachite and lapis-lazuli and of porphyry and yellow marble. The 
   floor was of black granite; the roof of white marble. On the Southern side was 
   my couch, a softness of exotic furs. To roll in them was to gasp for pleasure. 
   in the centre was a tiny fountain of pure gold. The sunlight came through the 
   space between the walls and the roof, while on the other sides I could look 
   through and up into the infinite blue.</p>
 <p>There was a great python that inhabited the hall; but he was very old, and 
   too wise to stir. But -- so I then believed -- he watched me and conveyed intelligence 
   to the old magus of the well.</p>
 <p>Now then the folly of my guardians appeared in this; that while all day I slept 
   and languished and played idly, at night while they supposed I slept, I slept 
   not. But I rose and gave myself to the most violent exercises. First, I would 
   go into my bathing-pool and hold my breath beneath the water while I invoked 
   the goddess Auramoth one hundred times. Next, I would walk on my hands around 
   the room; I even succeeded in hopping on one hand. Next, I would climb each 
   of the twenty-four smooth pillars. next, I would practise the seventy-two athletic 
   postures. Also in many other ways I would strive to make my strength exceeding 
   great; and all this I kept most secret from my guardians.</p>
 <p>At last on one night I resolved to try my strength; so, pushing aside the curtain, 
   I passed into the corridor. Springing upon the soldier that guarded me, I brought 
   him to the ground; and with my right hand under his chin, my left on his right 
   shoulder, and my knee at the nape of his neck, I tore his head from his body 
   before he could utter a cry.</p>
 <p>I was now in my fifteenth year; but the deed was marvelous. None suspected 
   me; it was thought a miracle.</p>
 <p>The old eunuch, distressed, went to consult the magus of the well; whose answer 
   was; "Let the vows of the priestess be taken!"</p>
 <p>Now I thought this old man most foolish-obstinate; for I myself was obstinate 
   and foolish. Not yet did I at all understand his wisdom or his purpose.</p>
 <p>It often happens thus. Of old., men sent their priests to rebuke Nile for rising 
   -- until it was known that his rising was the cause of the fertility of their 
   fields.</p>
 <p>Now of the vows which I took upon me and of my service as priestess of the 
   Veiled One it shall next be related.</p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="3">CHAPTER III</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>IT was the Equinox of Spring, and all my life stirred in me. They led me down 
   cool colonnades of mighty stone clad in robes of white broidered with silver, 
   and veiled with a veil of fine gold web fastened with rubies. They gave me not 
   the Uraeus crown, nor any nemyss, nor the Ateph crown, but bound my forehead 
   with a simple fillet of green leaves -- vervain and mandrake and certain deadly 
   herbs of which it is not fitting to speak.</p>
 <p>Now the priests of the Veiled One were sore perplexed, for that never before 
   had any boy been chosen priestess. For before the vows may be administered, 
   the proofs of virginity are sought; and, as it seemed, this part of the ritual 
   must be suppressed or glossed over. Then said the High Priest: "Let it 
   be that we examine the first woman that he shall touch with his hand, and she 
   shall suffice." Now when I heard this, I thought to test the God; and, 
   spying in the crowd, I beheld in loose robes with flushed face and wanton eyes, 
   a certain courtesan well-known in the city, and I touched her. Then those of 
   the priests that hated me were glad, for they wished to reject me; and taking 
   aside into the hall of trial that woman, made the enquiry. Then with robes rent 
   they came running forth, crying out against the Veiled One; for they found her 
   perfect in virginity, and so was she even unto her death, as latter appeared.</p>
 <p>But the Veiled One was wroth with them because of this, and appeared in her 
   glittering veil upon the steps of her temple. There she stood, and called them 
   one by one; and she lifted but the eye-piece of her veil and looked into their 
   eyes; and dead they fell before her as if smitten of the lightning.</p>
 <p>But those priests who were friendly to me and loyal to the goddess took that 
   virgin courtesan, and led her in triumph through the city, veiled and crowned 
   as is befitting. Now after some days he that guarded the sacred goat of Khem 
   died, and they appointed her in his place. And she was the first woman that 
   was thus honoured since the days of the Evil Queen in the Eighteenth Dynasty, 
   of her that wearied of men at an age when other women have not known them, that 
   gave herself to gods and beasts.</p>
 <p>But now they took me to the pool of liquid silver -- or so they called it; 
   I suppose it was quicksilver; for I remember that it was very difficult to immerse 
   me -- which is beneath the feet of the Veiled One. For this is the secret of 
   the Oracle. Standing afar off the priest beholds the reflection of her in the 
   mirror, seeing her lips that move under the veil; and this he interprets to 
   the seeker after truth.</p>
 <p>Thus the priest reads wrongly the silence of the Goddess, and the seeker understands 
   ill the speech of the priest. Then come forth fools, saying "The Goddess 
   hath lied" -- and in their folly they die.</p>
 <p>While, therefore, they held me beneath the surface of the pool, the High Priestess 
   took the vows on my behalf saying:</p>
 <p>I swear by the orb of the Moon;<br>
   I swear by the circuit of the Stars;<br>
   I swear but the Veil, and by the Face behind the Veil;<br>
   I swear by the Light Invisible, and by the Visible Darkness; On behalf of this 
   Virgin that is buried in thy water;<br>
   To live in purity and service;<br>
   To love in beauty and truth;<br>
   To guard the Veil from the profane;<br>
   To die before the Veil; ...</p>
 <p>-- and then came the awful penalty of failure.</p>
 <p>I dare not recall half of it; yet in it were these words: Let her be torn by 
   the Phallus of Set, and let her bowels be devoured by Apep; let her be prostituted 
   to the lust of Besz, and let her face be eaten by the god ----.</p>
 <p>It is not good to write His name.</p>
 <p>Then they loosed me, and I lay smiling in the pool. They lifted me up and brought 
   me to the feet of the goddess, so that I might kiss them. And as I kissed them 
   such a thrill ran through me that I thought myself rapt away into the heaven 
   of Amoun, or even as Asi when Hoor and Hoor-pa-kraat, cleaving her womb, sprang 
   armed to life. Then they stripped me of my robes, and lashed me with fine twigs 
   of virgin hazel, until my blood ran from me into the pool;. But the surface 
   of the silver swallowed up the blood by some mysterious energy; and they took 
   this to be a sign of acceptance. So then they clothed me in the right robes 
   of a priestess of the Veiled One; and they put a silver sistron in my hand, 
   and bade me perform the ceremony of adoration. This I did, and the veil of the 
   goddess glittered in the darkness -- for night had fallen by this -- with a 
   strange starry light.</p>
 <p>Thereby it was known that I was indeed chosen aright. so last of all they took 
   me to the banqueting-house and set me on the high throne. One by one the priests 
   came by and kissed my lips: one by one the priestesses came by, and gave me 
   the secret clasp of hands that hath hidden virtue. And the banquet waxed merry; 
   for all the food was magically prepared. Every beast that they slew was virgin; 
   every plant that they plucked had been grown and tended by virgins in the gardens 
   of the temple. also the wine was spring water only, but so consecrated by the 
   holy priestesses that one glass was more intoxicating that a whole skin of common 
   wine. Yet this intoxication was a pure delight, an enthusiasm wholly divine; 
   and it gave strength, and did away with sleep, and left no sorrow.</p>
 <p>Last, as the first gray glow of Hormakhu paled the deep indigo of the night, 
   they crowned and clothed me with white lotus flowers, and took me joyously back 
   into the temple, there to celebrate the matin ritual of awakening the Veiled 
   One.</p>
 <p>Thus, and not otherwise, I became priestess of that holy goddess, and for a 
   little while my life passed calm as the unruffled mirror itself.</p>
 <p>It was from the Veiled One herself that came the Breath of Change.</p>
 <p>On this wise.</p>
 <p>In the Seventh Equinox after my initiation into her mystery the High Priestess 
   was found to fail; at her invocation the Veil no longer glittered as was its 
   wont. For this they deemed her impure, and resorted to many ceremonies, but 
   without avail. At last in despair she went to the temple of Set, and gave herself 
   as a victim to that dreadful god. Now all men were much disturbed at this, and 
   it was not known at all of them what they should do. Now it must be remembered 
   that the ceremonies are always performed by a single priestess alone before 
   the goddess, save only at the Initiations. the others also had found themselves 
   rejected of her; and when they learnt of the terrible end of the High Priestess, 
   they became fearful. some few, indeed, concealed their failure from the priests; 
   but always within a day and a night they were found torn asunder in the outer 
   courts; so that it seemed the lesser evil to speak truth.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the affair had become a public scandal; for the goddess plagued the 
   people with famine and with a terrible and foul disease.</p>
 <p>But as for me, I wot not what to do; for to me always the Veil glittered, and 
   that brighter than the ordinary. Yet I said nothing, but went about drooping 
   and sorrowful, as if I were as unfortunate as they. For I would not seem to 
   boast of the favour of the goddess.</p>
 <p>Then they sent to he old Magus in the well; and he laughed outright at their 
   beards, and would say no word. Also they sent to the sacred goat of Khem, and 
   his priestess would but answer, "I, and such as I, may be favoured of Her," 
   which they took for ribaldry and mocking. A third time they sent to the temple 
   of Thoth the Ibis god of wisdom. And Thoth answered them by this riddle: "On 
   how many legs doth mine Ibis sand?"</p>
 <p>And they understood him not.</p>
 <p>But the old High priest determined to solve the mystery, though he paid forfeit 
   with his life. so concealing himself in the temple, he watched in the pool for 
   the reflection of the glittering of the Veil, while one by one we performed 
   the adorations. And behind him and without stood the priests, watching for him 
   to make a sing. This we knew not; but when it fell to me (the last) to adore 
   that Veiled One, behold! the Veil glittered, and the old Priest threw up his 
   arms to signal that which had occurred. And the flash of the eye pierced the 
   Veil, and he fell from his place dead upon the priests without.</p>
 <p>They buried him with much honour, for that he had given his life for the people 
   and for the temple, to bring back the favour of the Veiled One. Then came they 
   all very humbly unto me the child, and besought me to interpret the will of 
   the Goddess. And her will was that I alone should serve her day and night.</p>
 <p>Then they gave me to drink of the Cup of the torment; and this is its virtue, 
   that if one should speak falsely, invoking the name of the goddess, he shall 
   burn in hell visibly before all men for a thousand years; and that flame shall 
   never be put out. There is such an one in her temple in Memphis, for I saw it 
   with these eyes. There he burns and writhes and shrieks on the cold marble floor; 
   and there he shall burn till his time expire, and he sink to that more dreadful 
   hell below the West. But I drank thereof, and the celestial dew stood shining 
   on my skin, and a coolness ineffable thrilled through me; whereat they all rejoiced, 
   and obeyed the voice of the Goddess that I had declared unto them.</p>
 <p>Now then was I alway alone with that Veiled One, and I must enter most fully 
   into that secret period of my life. For, despite its ending, which hath put 
   many wise men to shame, it was to me even as an eternity of rapture, of striving 
   and of attainment beyond that which most mortals -- and they initiates even! 
   -- call divine. </p>
 <p>Now first let it be understood what is the ritual of adoration of our Lady 
   the Veiled One.</p>
 <p>First, the priestess performs a mystical dance, by which all beings whatso- 
   ever, be they dogs or demons, are banished, so that the place may be pure. Next, 
   in another dance, even more secret and sublime, the presence of the goddess 
   is invoked into her Image. Next, the priestess goes a certain journey, passing 
   the shrines of many great and terrible of the Lords of Khem, and saluting them. 
   Last, she assumes the very self of the Goddess; and if this be duly done, the 
   Veil glittereth responsive.</p>
 <p>Therefore, if the Veil glittereth not, one may know that in some way the priestess 
   hath failed to identify herself with Her. Thus an impurity in the thought of 
   the priestess must cause her to fail; for the goddess is utterly pure.</p>
 <p>Yet the task is alway difficult; for with the other gods one knoweth the appearance 
   of their images; and steadily contemplating these one can easily attain to their 
   imitation, and so to their comprehension, and to unity of consciousness with 
   them. But with Our Veiled One, none who hath seen her face hath lived long enough 
   to say one word, or call one cry.</p>
 <p>So then it was of vital urgency to me to keep in perfect sympathy with that 
   pure soul, so calm, so strong. With what terror then did I regard myself when, 
   looking into my own soul, I saw no longer that perfect stillness. Strange was 
   it, even as if one should see a lake stirred by a wind that one did not feel 
   upon the cheeks and brow!</p>
 <p>Trembling and ashamed, I went to the vesper adoration. I knew myself troubled, 
   irritated, by I knew not what. And in spite of all my efforts, this persisted 
   even to the supreme moment of my assumption of her godhead.</p>
 <p>And the? Oh but the Veil glittered as never yet; yea more! it shot out sparks 
   of scintillant fire, silvery rose, a shower of flame and of perfume.</p>
 <p>Then was I exceedingly amazed because of this, and made a Vigil before her 
   all the night, seeking a Word. And that word came not.</p>
 <p>Now of what further befell I will write anon.</p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="4">CHAPTER IV</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>SO it came to pass that I no longer went out at all from the presence of the 
   goddess, save only to eat and to sleep. And the favour of her was restored to 
   the people, so that all men were glad thereof.</p>
 <p>For if any man murmured, he was slain incontinent, the people being mindful 
   of the famine and the disease, and being minded to have no more of such, if 
   it could by any means be avoided. They were therefore exceeding punctual with 
   their gifts.</p>
 <p>But I was daily more afraid, being in a great sweat of passion, of which I 
   dared to speak to no man. Nor did I dare to speak even privily in mine own heart 
   thereof, lest I should discover its nature. But I sent my favourite, the virgin 
   Istarah (slim, pallid, and trembling as a young lotus in the West Wind), with 
   my ring of office, to enquire of the old Magus of the well.</p>
 <p>And he answered her by pointing upward to the sky and then downward to the 
   earth. And I read this Oracle as if ti were spoken "As above, so beneath." 
   This came to me as I had flung myself in despair at the feet of my Lady, covering 
   them with my tears; for by a certain manifest token I now knew that I had done 
   a thing that was so dreadful that even now -- these many thousand years hence 
   -- I dare hardly write it.</p>
 <p>I loved the Veiled One. </p>
 <p>Yea, wit the fierce passion of a beast, of a man, of a god, with my whole soul 
   I loved her.</p>
 <p>Even as I knew this by the manifest token the Veil burst into a devouring flame; 
   it ate up the robes of my office, lapping them with its tongues of fire like 
   a tigress lapping blood; yet withal it burnt me not, nor singed one hair.</p>
 <p>Thus naked I fled away in fear, and in my madness slipped and fell into the 
   pool of liquid silver, splashing it all over the hall; and even as I fled that 
   rosy cataract of flame that wrapt me (from the Veil as it jetted) went out -- 
   went out ----</p>
 <p>The Veil was a dull web of gold, no more.</p>
 <p>Then I crept fearfully to the feet of the goddess, and with my tears and kisses 
   sought to wake her into life once more. But the Veil flamed not again; only 
   a mist gathered about it and filled the temple, and hid all things from my eyes.</p>
 <p>Now then came Istarah my favourite back with the ring and the message; and 
   thinking that she brought bad news, I slit her lamb's-throat with the magic 
   sickle, and her asp's-tongue I tore out with my hands, and threw it to the dogs 
   and jackals.</p>
 <p>Herein I erred sorely, for her news was good. Having reflected thereon, I perceived 
   its import.</p>
 <p>For since the Veil flamed always at my assumption, it was sure that I was in 
   sympathy with that holy Veiled One.</p>
 <p>If I were troubled, and knew not why; if my long peace were stirred -- why 
   then, so She!</p>
 <p>"As above, so beneath!" For even as I, being man, sought to grasp 
   godhead and crush it in my arms, so She, the pure essence, sought to manifest 
   in form by love.</p>
 <p>Yet I dared not repeat the ceremony at midnight.</p>
 <p>Instead I lay prone, my arms outstretched in shame and pain, on the steps at 
   her feet.</p>
 <p>And lo! the Veil flamed. Then I knew that She too blamed Herself alike for 
   her ardour and for her abstinence. Thus seven days I lay, never stirring; and 
   all that time the Veil flamed subtly and softly, a steady bluish glow changing 
   to green as my thought changed from melancholy to desire.</p>
 <p>Then on the eight day I rose and left the shrine and clad myself in new robes, 
   in robes of scarlet and gold, with a crown of vine and bay and laurel and cypress. 
   Also I purified myself and proclaimed a banquet. And I made the priests and 
   the citizens, exceeding drunken. Then I called the guard, and purged thoroughly 
   the whole temple of all of them, charging the captain on his life to let no 
   man pass within. So that I should be absolutely alone in the whole precincts 
   of the temple.</p>
 <p>Then like an old gray wolf I wandered round the outer court, lifting up my 
   voice in a mournful howl. And an ululation as of one hundred thousand wolves 
   answered me, yet deep and muffled, as though it came from the very bowels of 
   the earth.</p>
 <p>Then at the hour of midnight I entered again the shrine and performed the ritual.</p>
 <p>As I went on I became inflamed with an infinite lust for the Infinite; and 
   now I let it leap unchecked, a very lion. Even so the Veil glowed red as with 
   some infernal fire. Now then I am come to the moment of the Assumption; but 
   instead of sitting calm and cold, remote, aloof, I gather myself together, and 
   spring madly at the Veil, catching it in my two hands. Now the Veil was of woven 
   gold, three thousand twisted wires; a span thick! Yet I put out my whole force 
   to tear it across; and (for she also put out her force) it rent with a roar 
   as of earthquake. Blinded I was with the glory of her face; I should have fallen; 
   but she caught me to her, and fixed her divine mouth on mine, eating me up wit 
   the light of her eyes. her mouth moaned, her throat sobbed with love; her tongue 
   thrust itself into me as a shaft of sunlight smites into the palm-groves; my 
   robes fell shrivelled, and flesh to flesh we clung. Then in some strange way 
   she gripped me body and soul, twining herself about me and within me even as 
   Death that devoureth mortal man.</p>
 <p>Still, still my being increased; my consciousness expanded until I was all 
   Nature seen as one, felt as one, apprehended as one, formed by me, part of me, 
   apart from me -- all these things at one moment -- and at the same time the 
   ecstasy of love grew colossal, a tower to scale the stars, a sea to drown the 
   sun ...</p>
 <p>I cannot write of this ... but in the streets people gathered apples of gold 
   that dropped from invisible boughs, and invisible porters poured out wine for 
   all, strange wine that healed disease and old age, wine that, poured between 
   the teeth of the dead (so long as the embalmer had not begun his work), brought 
   them back from the dark kingdom to perfect health and youth.</p>
 <p>As for me, I lay as one dead in the arms of the holy Veiled One -- Veiled no 
   more! -- while she took her pleasure of me ten times, a thousand times. In that 
   whirlwind of passion all my strength was as a straw in the simoom.</p>
 <p>Yet I grew not weaker but stronger. Though my ribs cracked, I held firm. Presently 
   indeed I stirred; it seemed as if her strength had come to me. Thus I forced 
   back her head and thrust myself upon and into her even as a comet that impales 
   the sun upon its horn! And my breath came fast between my lips and hers; her 
   moan now faint, like a dying child, no more like a wild beast in torment.</p>
 <p>Even so, wild with the lust of conquest, I urged myself upon her and fought 
   against her. I stretched out her arms and forced them to the ground; then I 
   crossed them on her breast, so that she was powerless. And I became like a mighty 
   serpent of flame, and wrapt her, crushed her in my coils.</p>
 <p>I was the master! ...</p>
 <p>Then grew a vast sound about me as of shouting: I grew conscious of the petty 
   universe, the thing that seems apart from oneself, so long as one is oneself 
   apart from it.</p>
 <p>Men cried "The temple is on fire! The temple of Asi the Veiled One is 
   burning! The mighty temple that gave its glory to Thebai is aflame!</p>
 <p>Then I loosed my coils and gathered myself together into the form of a mighty 
   hawk of gold and spake on last word to her, a word to raise her from the dead!</p>
 <p>But lo! not Asi, but Asar!</p>
 <p>White was his garment, starred with red and blue and yellow. Green was his 
   Countenance, and in his hands he bore the crook and scourge. Thus he rose, even 
   as the temple fell about us in ruins, and we were left standing there.</p>
 <p>And I wist not what to say.</p>
 <p>Now then the people of the city crowded in upon us, and for the most part would 
   have slain me.</p>
 <p>But Thoth the mighty God, the wise one, with his Ibis-head, and his nemyss 
   of indigo, with his Ateph crown and his Phoenix wand and with his Ankh of emerald, 
   with his magic apron in the Three colours; yea, Thoth, the God of Wisdom, whose 
   skin is of tawny orange as though it burned in a furnace, appeared visibly to 
   all of us. And the old Magus of the Well, whom no man had seen outside his well 
   for night threescore years, was found in the midst: and he cried with a loud 
   voice, saying:</p>
 <p>"The Equinox of the Gods!"</p>
 <p>And he went on to explain how it was that Nature should no longer be the centre 
   of man's worship, but Man himself, man in his suffering and death, man in his 
   purification and perfection. And he recited the Formula of the Osiris as follows, 
   even as it hath been transmitted unto us by the Brethren of the Cross and Rose 
   unto this day:</p>
 <p>"For Asar Un-nefer hath said:<br>
   He that is found perfect before the Gods hath said:<br>
   These are the elements of my body, perfected through suffering, glorified through 
   trial.</p>
 <p>For the Scent of the dying rose is the repressed sigh of my suffering; The 
   Flame-Red fire is the energy of my undaunted Will; The Cup of Wine is the outpouring 
   of the blood of my heart, sacrificed to regeneration;</p>
 <p>And the Bread and Salt are the Foundations of my Body<br>
   Which I destroy in order that they may be renewed.<br>
   For I am Asar triumphant, even Asar Un-nefer the Justified One!<br>
   I am Her who is clothed with the body of flesh,<br>
   Yet in Whom is the Spirit of the mighty Gods.<br>
   I am he Lord of Life, triumphant over death; he who partaketh with me shall 
   arise with me.<br>
   I am the manifestor in Matter of those whose abode is in the Invisible. I am 
   purified: I stand upon the Universe: I am its Reconciler with the eternal Gods: 
   I am the Perfector of Matter; and without me the Universe is not!"</p>
 <p>All this he said, and displayed the sacraments of Osiris before them all; and 
   in a certain mystical manner did we all symbolically partake of them. But for 
   me! in the Scent of the dying Rose I beheld rather the perfection of the love 
   of my lady the Veiled One, whom I had won, and slain in the winning!</p>
 <p>Now, however, the old Magus clad me (for I was yet naked) in the dress of a 
   Priest of Osiris. He gave me the robes of white Linen, and the leopard's skin, 
   and the wand and ankh. Also he gave me the crook and scourge, and girt me with 
   the royal girdle. On my head he set the holy Uraeus serpent for a crown; and 
   then, turning to the people, cried aloud: "Behold the Priest of Asar in 
   Thebai!</p>
 <p>"He shall proclaim unto ye the worship of Asar; see that ye follow him!"</p>
 <p>Then, ere one could cry "Hold!" he had vanished from our sight.</p>
 <p>I dismissed the people; I was alone with the dead God; with Osiris, the Lord 
   of Amennti, the slain of Typhon, the devoured of Apophis ... Yea, verily, I 
   was alone!</p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="5">CHAPTER V</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>NOW then the great exhaustion took hold upon me, and I fell at the feet of 
   the Osiris as one dead. All knowledge of terrestrial things was gone from me; 
   I entered the kingdom of the dead by the gate of the West. For the worship of 
   Osiris is to join the earth to the West; it is the cultus of the Setting Sun. 
   Through Isis man obtains strength of nature; through Osiris he obtains the strength 
   of suffering and ordeal, and as the trained athlete is superior to the savage, 
   so is the magic of Osiris stronger than the magic of Isis. So by my secret practices 
   at night, while my guardians strove to smooth my spirit to a girl's, had I found 
   the power to bring about that tremendous event, an Equinox of the Gods.</p>
 <p>Just as thousands of years later was my secret revolt against Osiris -- for 
   the world had suffered long enough! -- destined to bring about another Equinox 
   in which Horus was to replace the Slain One with his youth and vigour and victory.</p>
 <p>I passed therefore into these glowing abodes of Amennti, clad in thick darkness, 
   while my body lay entranced at the feet of the Osiris in the ruined temple.</p>
 <p>Now the god Osiris sent forth his strange gloom to cover us, lest the people 
   should perceive or disturb; Therefore I lay peacefully entranced, and abode 
   in Amennti. There I confronted the devouring god, and there was my heart weighed 
   and found perfect; there the two-and-forty Judges bade me pass through the pylons 
   they guarded; there I spoke with the Seven, and with the Nine, and with the 
   Thirty-Three; and at the end I came out into the abode of the Holy Hathor, unto 
   her mystical mountain, and being there crowned and garlanded I rejoiced exceedingly, 
   coming out through the gate of the East, the Beautiful gate, unto the Land of 
   Khemi, and the city of Thebai, and the temple that had been the temple of the 
   Veiled One. There I rejoined my body, making the magical links in the prescribed 
   manner, and rose up and did adoration to the Osiris by the fourfold sign. Therefore 
   the Light of Osiris began to dawn; it went about the city whirling forth, abounding, 
   crying aloud; whereat the people worshipped, being abased with exceeding fear. 
   Moreover, they hearkened unto their wise men and brought gifts of gold, so that 
   the temple floor was heaped high; and gifts of oxen, so that the courts of the 
   temple could not contain them: and gifts of slaves, as it were a mighty army.</p>
 <p>Then I withdrew myself; and taking counsel with the wisest of the priests and 
   of the architects and of the sculptors, I gave out my orders so that the temple 
   might duly be builded. By the favour of the god all things went smoothly enough; 
   yet was I conscious of some error in the working; or if you will, some weakness 
   in myself and my desire. Look you, I could not forget the Veiled One, my days 
   of silence and solitude with Her, the slow dawn of our splendid passion, the 
   climax of all that wonder in her ruin!</p>
 <p>So as the day approached for the consecration of the temple I began to dread 
   some great catastrophe. Yet all went well -- perhaps too well. </p>
 <p>The priests and the people knew nothing of this, however. For the god manifested 
   exceptional favour; as a new god must do, or how shall he establish his position? 
   The harvest were fourfold, the cattle eightfold; the women were all fertile 
   -- yea! barren women of sixty years bore twins! -- there was no disease or sorrow 
   in the city.</p>
 <p>Mighty was the concourse of the citizens on the great day of the consecra- 
   tion.</p>
 <p>Splendid rose the temple, a fortress of black granite. The columns were carved 
   with wonderful images of all the gods adoring Osiris; marvels of painting glittered 
   on the walls; they told the story of Osiris, of his birth, his life, his death 
   at the hands of Typhon, the search after his scattered members, the birth of 
   Horus and Harpocrates, the vengeance upon Typhon Seth, the resurrection of Osiris.</p>
 <p>The god himself was seated in a throne set back unto the wall. It was of lapis-lazuli 
   and amber, it was inlaid with emerald and ruby. Mirrors of polished gold, of 
   gold burnished with dried poison of asps, so that the slaves who worked upon 
   it might die. For, it being unlawful for those mirrors to have ever reflected 
   any mortal countenance, the slaves were both blinded and veiled; yet even so, 
   it were best that they should die.</p>
 <p>At last the ceremony began. With splendid words, with words that shone lime 
   flames, did I consecrate all that were there present, even the whole city of 
   Thebai.</p>
 <p>And I made the salutation unto the attendant gods, very forcibly, so that they 
   responded with echoes of my adoration. And Osiris accepted mine adoration with 
   gladness as I journeyed about at the four quarters of the temple. </p>
 <p>Now cometh the mysterious ceremony of Assumption. I took upon myself the form 
   of the god: I strove to put my heart in harmony with his.</p>
 <p>Alas! alas! I was in tune with the dead soul of Isis; my heart was as a flame 
   of elemental lust and beauty; I could not -- I could not. Then the heavens lowered 
   and black clouds gathered upon the Firmament of Nu. Dark flames of lightning 
   rent the clouds, giving no light. The thunder roared; the people were afraid. 
   In his dark shrine the Osiris gloomed, displeasure on his forehead, insulted 
   majesty in his eyes. Then a pillar of dust whirled down from the vault of heaven, 
   even unto me as I stood alone, half-defiant, in the midst of the temple while 
   the priests and the people cowered and wailed afar off. It rent the massy roof 
   as it had been a thatch of straw, whirling the blocks of granite far away into 
   the Nile. It descended, roaring and twisting, like a wounded serpent demon-king 
   in his death-agony; it struck me and lifted me from the temple; it bore me through 
   leagues of air into the desert; then it dissolved and flung me contemptuously 
   on a hill of sand. Breathless and dazed I lay, anger and anguish tearing at 
   my heart.</p>
 <p>I rose to swear a mighty curse; exhaustion took me, and I fell in a swoon to 
   the earth.</p>
 <p>When I came to myself it was nigh dawn. I went to the top of the hillock and 
   looked about me. Nothing but sand, sand all ways. Just so was it within my heart!</p>
 <p>The only guide for my steps (as the sun rose) was a greener glimpse in the 
   East, which I thought might be the valley of the Nile reflected. Thither I bent 
   my steps: all day I struggled with the scorching heat, the shifting sand. At 
   night I tried to sleep, for sheer fatigue impelled me. But as often as I lay 
   down, so often restlessness impelled me forward. I would stagger on awhile, 
   then stumble and fall. Only at dawn I slept perhaps for an hour, and woke chilled 
   to death by me own sweat. I was so weak that I could hardly raise a hand; my 
   tongue was swollen, so that I could not greet the sun-disk with the accustomed 
   adoration. My brain had slipped control; I could not longer even think of the 
   proper spells that might have brought me aid. Instead, dreadful shapes drew 
   near; one, a hideous camel-demon, an obscene brute of filth; another, a black 
   ape with a blue muzzle and crimson buttocks, all his skin hairless and scabby, 
   with his mass of mane oiled and trimmed like a beautiful courtesans. This fellow 
   mocked me with the alluring gestures of such an one, and anon voided his excrement 
   upon me. Moreover there were others, menacing and terrible, vast cloudy demon-shapes. 
   ...</p>
 <p>I could not think of the words of power that control them.</p>
 <p>Now the sun that warmed my chill bones yet scorched me further. My tongue so 
   swelled that I could hardly breathe; my face blackened; my eyes bulged out. 
   The fiends came closer; drew strength from my weakness, made themselves material 
   bodies, twitched me and spiked me and bit me. I turned on them and struck feebly 
   again and again; but they evaded me easily and their yelling laughter rang like 
   bells in my ears. Howbeit I saw that they attacked me only on one side, as if 
   to force me to one path. But I was wise enough to keep my shadow steadily behind 
   me: and they, seeing this, were all the more enraged: I therefore the more obstinate 
   in my course. Then they changed their tactics; and made as if to keep me in 
   the course I had chosen; and seeing this, I was confirmed therein.</p>
 <p>Truly with the gods I went! For in a little while I came to a pool of water 
   and a tall palm standing by.</p>
 <p>I plunder in that cool wave; my strength came back, albeit slowly; yet with 
   one wave of my hand in the due gesture the fiends all vanished; and in an hour 
   I was sufficiently restored to call forth my friends from the pool -- the little 
   fishes my playmates -- and the nymph of the pool came forth and bowed herself 
   before me and cooked me the fishes with that fire that renders water luminous 
   and sparkling. Also she plucked me dates from the tree, and I ate thereof. Thus 
   was I much comforted; and when I had eaten, she took my head upon her lap, and 
   sang me to sleep; for her voice was like the ripple of the lakes under the wind 
   of spring and like the bubbling of a well and like the tinkling of a fountain 
   through a bed of moss. Also she had deep notes like the sea that booms upon 
   a rocky shore.</p>
 <p>So long, long, long I slept.</p>
 <p>Now when I awoke the nymph had gone; but I took form my bosom a little casket 
   of certain sacred herbs; and casting a few grains into the pool, repaid her 
   for her courtesy. And I blessed her in the name of our dead lady Isis, and went 
   on in the strength of that delicious meal for a great way. Yet I wist not what 
   to do; for I was as it were a dead man, although my age was barely two and twenty 
   years.</p>
 <p>What indeed should befall me?</p>
 <p>Yet I went on; and, climbing a ridge, beheld at last the broad Nile, and a 
   shining city that I knew not.</p>
 <p>There on the ridge I stood and gave thanks to the great gods of Heaven, the 
   Aeons of infinite years, that I had come thus far. For at the sight of Nilus 
   new life began to dawn in me. </p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="6">CHAPTER VI</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>WITHOUT any long delay I descended the slopes and entered the city. Not knowing 
   what might have taken place in Thebai and what news might have come thither, 
   I did not dare declare myself; but seeking out the High Priest of Horus I showed 
   him a certain sign, telling him that I was come from Memphis on a journey, and 
   intended to visit Thebai to pay homage at the shrine of Isis. But he, full of 
   the news, told me that the ancient priestess of Isis, who had become priest 
   of Osiris, had been taken up to heaven as a sign of the signal favour of the 
   God. Where at I could hardly hold myself from laughter; yet I controlled myself 
   and answered that I was not prepared to return to Memphis, for that I was vowed 
   to Isis, and Osiris could not serve my turn.</p>
 <p>At this he begged me to stay as his guest, and to go worship at the temple 
   of Isis in this city. I agreed thereto, and the good man gave me new robes and 
   jewels from the treasury of his own temple. There too I rested sweetly on soft 
   cushions fanned by young boys with broad leaves of palm. Also he sent me the 
   dancing girl of Sleep. It was the art of this girl to weave such subtle movements 
   that the sense, watching her, swooned; and as she swayed she sang, ever lower 
   and lower as she moved slower and slower, until the looker-listener was dissolved 
   in bliss of sleep and delicate dream. </p>
 <p>Then as he slept she would bend over him even as Nuit the Lady of the Stars 
   that bendeth over the black earth, and in his ears she would whisper strange 
   rhythms, secret utterances, whereby his spirit would be rapt into the realms 
   of Hathor or some other golden goddess, there in one night to reap an harvest 
   of refreshment such as the fields of mortal sleep yield never.</p>
 <p>So then I woke at dawn, to find her still watching, still looking into my eyes 
   with a tender smile on her mouth that cooed whispers infinitely soothing. Indeed 
   with a soft kiss she waked me, for in this Art there is aright moment to sleep, 
   and another to waken: which she was well skilled to divine.</p>
 <p>I rose then -- she flitted away like a bird -- an robed myself; and, seeking 
   my host, went forth with him to the Temple of Isis.</p>
 <p>Now their ritual (it appeared) differed in one point from that to which I was 
   accustomed. Thus, it was not death to intrude upon the ceremony save only for 
   the profane. Priests of a certain rank of initiation might if they pleased behold 
   it. I, therefore, wishing to see again that marvellous glowing of the Veil, 
   disclosed a sufficient sign to the High Priest. Thereat was he mightily amazed; 
   and, from the foot judging Hercules, began to think that I might be some sacred 
   envoy to inspector from the Gods themselves. This I allowed him to think; meanwhile 
   we went forward into the shrines and stood behind the pillars, unseen, in the 
   prescribed position.</p>
 <p>Now it chanced that the High Priestess herself had this day chosen to perform 
   the rite.</p>
 <p>This was a woman tall and black, most majestic, with limbs strong as a man's. 
   Her gaze was hawk-keen, and her brow commanding. But at the Assumption of the 
   God-form she went close and whispered into the Veil, so low that we could not 
   hear it; but as it seemed with fierce intensity, with some passion that knotted 
   up her muscles, so that her arms writhed like wounded snakes. Also the veins 
   of her forehead swelled, and foam came to her lips. We thought that she had 
   died; her body swelled and shuddered; last of all a terrible cry burst from 
   her throat, inarticulate, awful.</p>
 <p>Yet all this while the Veil glittered, though something sombrely. Also the 
   air was filled with a wild sweeping music, which rent our very ears with its 
   uncouth magic. For it was like no music that I had ever heard before. At last 
   the Priestess tore herself away from the Veil and reeled -- as one drunken -- 
   down the temple. Sighs and sobs tore her breast; and her nails made bloody grooves 
   in her wet flanks.</p>
 <p>On a sudden she espied me and my companion; with one buffet she smote him to 
   earth -- it is unlawful to resist the Priestess when she is in the Ecstasy of 
   Union -- and falling upon me, like a wild beast she buried her teeth in my neck, 
   bearing me to the ground. Then, loosing me, while the blood streamed from me, 
   she fixed her glittering eyes upon it with strange joy, and with her hands she 
   shook me as a lion shakes a buck. Sinewy were her hands, with big knuckles, 
   and the strength of her was as cords of iron. Yet her might was but a mortal's; 
   in a little she gave one gasp like a drowning man's; beer body slackened, and 
   fell with its dead weight on mine, her mouth glued to mine in one dreadful kiss. 
   Dreadful; for as my mouth returned it, almost mechanically, the blood gushed 
   from her nostrils and blinded me. I too, then, more dead that alive, swooned 
   into bliss, into trance. I was awakened by the High Priest of Horus. "Come," 
   he said; "she is dead." I disengaged myself from all that weight of 
   madness -- and the body writhed convulsively as I turned it over -- I kissed 
   those frothy lips, for in death she was beautiful beyond belief, joyous beyond 
   description -- thence I staggered to the Veil, and saluted with all my strength, 
   so that it glittered under the force of my sheer will. Then I turned me again, 
   and with the High Priest sought his house.</p>
 <p>Strange indeed was I as I went through the city, my new robes dark with blood 
   of that most holy sorceress.</p>
 <p>But no one of the people dared so much as lift his eyes; nor spoke we together 
   at all. But when we were come into the house of the High Priest, sternly did 
   he confront me.</p>
 <p>"What is this, my son?"</p>
 <p>And I weary of the folly of the world and of the uselessness of things answered 
   him:</p>
 <p>"Father, I go back to Memphis. I am the Magus of the Well."</p>
 <p>Now he knew the Magus, and answered me:</p>
 <p>"Why liest thou?"</p>
 <p>And I said "I am come into the world where all speech is false, and all 
   speech is true."</p>
 <p>Then he did me reverence, abasing himself unto the ground even unto nine- and-ninety 
   times.</p>
 <p>And I spurned him and said, "Bring forth the dancing girl of Sleep; for 
   in the morning I will away to Memphis."</p>
 <p>And she came forth, and I cursed her and cried: "Be thou the dancing girl 
   of Love!"</p>
 <p>And it was so. And I went in unto her, and knew her; and in the morning I girded 
   myself, and boarded the state barge of the High Priest, and pillowed myself 
   upon gold and purple, and disported myself with lutes and with lyres and with 
   parrots, and with black salves,and with wine and with delicious fruits, until 
   I came even unto the holy city of Memphis.</p>
 <p>And there I called soldiers of Pharaoh, and put cruelly to death all them that 
   had accompanied me; and I burnt the barge, adrift upon the Nile at sunset, so 
   that the flames alarmed the foolish citizens. All this I did, and danced naked 
   in my madness through the city, until I came to the Old Magus of the Well.</p>
 <p>And laughing, I threw a stone upon him, crying: "Ree me the riddle of 
   my life!"</p>
 <p>And he answered naught.</p>
 <p>Then I threw a great rock upon him, and I heard his bones crunch, and I cried 
   in mockery: "Ree me the riddle of thy life!"</p>
 <p>But he answered naught.</p>
 <p>Then I threw down the wall of the well; and I burned the house with fire that 
   stood thereby, with the men-servants and the maid-servants.</p>
 <p>And none dared stay me; for I laughed and exulted in my madness. Yea, verily, 
   I laughed, and laughed -- and laughed -- </p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="7">CHAPTER VII</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>THEN being healed of my madness I took all the treasure of that old Magus which 
   he had laid up for many years -- and none gainsaid me. Great and splendid was 
   it of gold more than twelve bullocks could draw, of balassius rubies, and sardonyx, 
   and beryl, and chrysoprase; of diamond and starry sapphire, of emerald much, 
   very much, of topaz and of amethyst great and wonderful gems. Also he had a 
   figure of Nuit greater than a woman, which was made of lapis lazuli specked 
   with gold, carved with marvellous excellence. And he had the secret gem of Hadit 
   that is not found on earth, for that it is invisible save when all else is no 
   more seen.</p>
 <p>Then went I into the market and bought slaves. I bought me in particular a 
   giant, a Nubian blacker than polished granite seen by starlight, tall as a young 
   palm and straight, yet more hideous than the Ape of Thoth. Also I bought a young 
   pale stripling from the North, a silly boy with idle languishing ways. But his 
   mouth burned like sunset when the dust-storms blow. So pale an weak was he that 
   all despised him and mocked him for a girl. Then he took a white-hot iron from 
   the fire and wrote with it my name in hieroglyphics on his breast; nor did his 
   smile once alter while the flesh hissed and smoked.</p>
 <p>Thus we went out a great caravan to a rocky islet in the Nile, difficult of 
   access for that the waters foamed and swirled dangerously about it. There we 
   builded a little temple shaped like a beehive; but there was no altar and no 
   shrine therein; for in that temple should the god be sacrificed unto himself.</p>
 <p>Myself I made the god thereof; I powdered my hair with gold, and inwound it 
   with flowers. I gilded my eyelids, and I stained my lips with vermilion. I gilded 
   my breasts and my nails, and as God and Victim in one was I daily sacrificed 
   unto that strange thing that was none other than myself. I made my giant Nubian 
   high priest; and I endowed his wand with magic power, so that he might properly 
   perform my rites. This he did to such purpose that many men from Memphis and 
   even from more distant towns, leaving their gods, came thither, and did sacrifice. 
   Then I appointed also the pale boy warder of the Sanctuary: and he swore unto 
   me to be faithful unto death.</p>
 <p>Now there arose a great strife in Memphis, and many foolish and lewd women 
   cried out against us. So fierce was the uproar that a great company of women 
   issued forth from the city and came into the island They slew my pale boy at 
   the gate, though sword in hand he fought against them. Then they frothed on, 
   and I confronted them in my glory. They hesitated, and in that moment I smote 
   them with a deadly itching, so that running forth they tore off their clothes 
   and set themselves to scratching, while my people laughed until they ached.</p>
 <p>At the term, indeed, with exhaustion and with loss of blood they died all; 
   four hundred and two women perished in that great day's slaughter. So that the 
   people of Memphis had peace for awhile. </p>
 <p>But as for me, I mourned the loss of that young slave. I had his body embalmed 
   as is not fitting for other than a king. And at the door of the temple I placed 
   his sarcophagus beneath a hedge of knives and spears, so that there was no other 
   access to my glory.</p>
 <p>Like honour hath no slave had ever.</p>
 <p>Thus then I abode three cycles of the season; and at the end of that time the 
   high Priest died.</p>
 <p>For mine was a strange and dreadful rite to do; none other, and none unfortified 
   by magic power, could have done this thing.</p>
 <p>Yet I too sickened of that everlasting sacrifice. I was become worn and wan; 
   there was no blood but ice in my veins. I had indeed become all but a god ...</p>
 <p>Therefore I took the body of my Nubian, and slew four young girls, and filled 
   all the hollow spaces of his body with their blood. Then too I sealed up his 
   body with eight seals; and the ninth seal was mine own, the centre of my godhead.</p>
 <p>Then he rose slowly and staggeringly as I uttered the dreadful words:</p>
 <p>A ka dua<br>
   Tuf ur biu<br>
   Bi aa chefu<br>
   Dudu ner af an nuteru!</p>
 <p>Then I touched him with my wand and he rose into full power of his being; and 
   we entered in, and for the last time did he perform (though silent) the ceremony. 
   At whose end he lay shrivelled and collapsed, shrunken like an old wineskin; 
   yet his blood availed me nothing. I was icier than before. Yet now indeed was 
   I Osiris, for I sent out flames of cold gray glory from my skin, and mine eyes 
   were rigid with ecstasy.</p>
 <p>Yea, by Osiris himself, I swear it! Even as the eyes of all living men revolve 
   ceaselessly, so were mine fixed!</p>
 <p>Then I shook myself and went forth into the city of Memphis, my face being 
   veiled and my steps led by slaves.</p>
 <p>And there I went into the temples one by one; and I twitched aside my veil, 
   whereat all men fell dead on the instant, and the gods tumbled from their places, 
   and broke in pieces upon the floor.</p>
 <p>And I veiled myself, and went into the market-place and lifted up my voice 
   in a chant and cried:</p>
 <p>Death, and desolation, and despair!<br>
   I lift up my voice, and all the gods are dumb.<br>
   I unveil my face, and all that liveth is no more,<br>
   I sniff up life, and breathe forth destruction.<br>
   I hear the music of the world, and its echo is Silence.</p>
 <p>Death, and desolation, and despair!<br>
   The parting of the ways is come: the Equinox of the Gods is past.<br>
   Another day: another way.<br>
   Let them that hear me be abased before me!<br>
   Death, and desolation, and despair!</p>
 <p>Then I pulled away my veil, and the cold lightnings of death shot forth, and 
   the people of the city fell dead where they stood.</p>
 <p>Save only one, a young boy, a flute-player, that was blind, and, seeing not 
   those eyes of mine, died not.</p>
 <p>Then to him I spake, saying:</p>
 <p>"Arise, summon the priests and the people, all that remain. And let them 
   build a temple unto Osiris the God of the dead, and let the dead be worshipped 
   for ever and ever." </p>
 <p>This I said, and went out from the city with the two slaves that I had left 
   in the gate, and we went unto Nile, unto a cave by the bank of the river; and 
   there I abode for many months, weeping for Isis my Lady. For though I had avenged 
   her in many dreadful deeds, yet I brought her not back unto life. Moreover the 
   lover of her was as it were dead in me, so that my heart stirred not at the 
   thought of her. Say that my love wandered like a ghost unburied, frozen, adrift 
   upon the winds!</p>
 <p>Now of my deeds at this period it is almost too horrible to tell. For I performed 
   great penance, in the hope of vitalizing that dead principle in me which men 
   call the soul.</p>
 <p>I starved myself shamefully, in this manner. First surrounding myself with 
   all possible luxuries of food, brought in steaming and savoury from hour to 
   hour, I yet condemned myself to subsist upon a little garlic and a little salt, 
   with a little water in which oats had been bruised.</p>
 <p>Then if any wish arose in me to eat of the dainties around me I gashed my- 
   self with a sharp stone.</p>
 <p>Moreover I kindled a great fire in the cave so that the slaves tumbled and 
   fainted as they approached. And the smoke choked me so that I constantly vomited 
   a black and ill-smelling mucus from my lungs, stained here and there with frothing 
   blood.</p>
 <p>Again, I suffered my hair to grow exceeding long, and therein I harboured vermin. 
   Also, when I lay down to sleep, though this I did not till with swollen tongue 
   and blackened throat I could no longer howl the name of my dead Lady, then (I 
   say) did I smear my limbs with honey, that the rats of the cave might gnaw them 
   as I slept. Moreover, I pillowed mine head upon a corpse dead of leprosy, and 
   whenever that dead soul of mine stirred at all with love toward my Lady, then 
   I caressed and kissed that corpse, and sang soft songs to it, playing with gracious 
   words and gestures. All this spoke loudly to my soul, rebuking it for its weakness 
   and corruption. So too the bitterness and foulness of my life would often overleap 
   the limit of sensibility; and then for hours together would I be lost in a raging 
   whirlwind of laughter. At this time my slaves would be afraid to come anight 
   me, and then darting out of the cave I would catch one by the hair and dragging 
   him within put him to exquisite torture. This indeed was of great use to me; 
   for I would devise atrocious things, and if they served to excite his utmost 
   anguish I would then try them on myself. Thus I would run needles steeped in 
   Nile mud beneath my finger-nails, so that the sores festering might produce 
   a sickening agony. Or again I would cut strips of skin and tear them off; but 
   this filed, though it acted well enough upon the slave, for my own skin had 
   become too brittle. Then I would take a piece of hard wood, and hammer it with 
   a stone against the bones, hurting the membrane that covers them, and causing 
   it to swell. This too I had to abandon, but the limb of the slave died, and 
   he swelled up and rotted and turned green, and in shocking agony he died.</p>
 <p>So then I was compelled to cure myself magically, and this was a great loss 
   of force.</p>
 <p>Yet was I "Far form the Happy Ones," although my lips hung on my 
   fleshless face like bean-pods withered and blackened, and although there was 
   not one inch of skin upon all my body that was not scarred. </p>
 <p>Yet my trial was night its end. For the people of Memphis, wondering at the 
   frequent purchases of dead lepers made always by the same slave, began, as is 
   the wont of the ignorant, to spread foolish rumours. At last they said openly 
   "there is an holy hermit in the old cave by Nile." The the barren 
   women of the city came out stealthily to me in the hope that by my sanctity 
   their dry sticks might blossom.</p>
 <p>But I showed them my dead leper, and said "Let me first beget children 
   upon this,and after I will do your business." This liked them not; yet 
   they left me not alone, for they went home and cried out that I was an horror, 
   a ghoul, a vampire. ... And at that all the young and beautiful women of the 
   city, leaving their lovers and their husbands, flocked to me, bringing gifts. 
   But I took them to the dead leper and said, "When you are beautiful as 
   that is beautiful, and when I am weary of its beauty and its delight, then will 
   I do your pleasure."</p>
 <p>Then they all raged vehemently against me, and stirred up the men of the city 
   to destroy me. And I, not being minded to display my magic force, went by night 
   (so soon as I heard of this) and took sanctuary in the shrine of Osiris that 
   I had caused them to build. And there I attained felicity; for uniting my consciousness 
   with the gods, I obtained the expansion of that consciousness. Is not the kingdom 
   of the dead a mighty kingdom?</p>
 <p>So I perceived the universe as it were a single point of infinite nothing- 
   ness yet of infinite extension; and becoming this universe, I became dissolved 
   utterly therein. Moreover, my body lifted itself up and rose in the air to a 
   great height beyond the shadow of the earth, and the earth rolled beneath me; 
   yet of all this I knew nothing, for that I was all these things and none of 
   them. Moreover I was united with Isis the Mother of Osiris, being yet her brother 
   and her lord.</p>
 <p>Woe, woe to me! for all this was but partial and imperfect; nor did I truly 
   understand that which occurred.</p>
 <p>Only this I knew, that I should return to my city of Thebai, and rule therein 
   as High Priest of Osiris, no longer striving to some end unheard-of or impossible, 
   but quietly and patiently living in the enjoyment of my dignities and wealth, 
   even as a man.</p>
 <p>Yet one thing I saw also, that as Isis is the Lady of all Nature, the living; 
   and as Osiris is the Lord of the Dead, so should Horus come, the Hawk- headed 
   Lord, as a young child, the image of all Nature and all Man raised above Life 
   and Death, under the supreme rule of Hadit that is Force and of Nuit that is 
   Matter -- though they are a Matter an a Force that transcend all our human conceptions 
   of these things.</p>
 <p>But of this more anon, in its due place. </p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>BEHOLD me then returned to Thebai! So scarred and altered was I, though not 
   yet thirty years of age, that they knew me not. so I offered myself as a serving-man 
   in the temple of Osiris, and I pleased the priests mightily, for by my magic 
   power -- though they thought it to be natural -- I sang songs unto the god, 
   and made hymns. Therefore in less than a year they began to speak of initiating 
   me into the priesthood. Now the High Priest at this time was a young and vigorous 
   man, black-bearded in the fashion of Osiris, with a single square tuft beneath 
   the chin. Him had they chosen after my departure in the whirlwind. And the High 
   Priestess was a woman of forty and two years old, both dark and beautiful, with 
   flashing eyes and stern lips. Yet her body was slim and lithe like that of a 
   young girl. Now, as it chanced, it was my turn to serve her with the funeral 
   offerings; flesh of oxen and of geese, bread, and wine. And as she ate she spake 
   with me; for she could see by her art that I was not a common serving-man. Then 
   I took out the consecrated Wand of Khem that I had from my father; and I placed 
   it in her hand. At that she wondered, for that Wand is the sign of a great and 
   holy initiation: so rare that (as they say) no woman but one has ever attained 
   unto it. Then she blessed herself that she had been permitted to look upon it, 
   and prayed me to keep silence for a little while, for she had somewhat in her 
   mind to do. And I lifted up the wand upon her in the nine-and-forty-fold benediction, 
   and she received illumination thereof, and rejoiced. Then I fell at her feet 
   -- for she was the High Priestess -- and kissed them reverently, and withdrew.</p>
 <p>Then three days afterwards, as I learnt, she sent for a priestess who was skilled 
   in certain deadly crafts and asked of her a poison. And she gave it, saying: 
   "Let the High Priest of the God of the dead go down to the dead!" 
   Then that wicked High Priestess conveyed unto him subtly the poison in the sacraments 
   themselves, and he died thereof. Then by her subtlety she caused a certain youth 
   to be made high priest who was slovenly and stupid, thinking in herself "Surely 
   the god will reject him." But at his word the Image of the god glowed as 
   was its wont. And at that she knew -- and we all knew -- that the glory was 
   departed; for that the priests had supplanted the right ceremony by some trick 
   of deceit and craft.</p>
 <p>Thereat was she mightily cast down, for though wicked and ambitious, she had 
   yet much power and knowledge.</p>
 <p>But instead of using that power and that knowledge she sought to oppose craft 
   with craft. And suspecting (aright) whose cunning had done this thing she bribed 
   him to reverse the machinery, so that the High Priest might be shamed. But shamed 
   he was not; for he lied, saying that the God glowed brighter than the Sun; and 
   he lied securely, for Maat the Lady of Truth had no place in that temple. To 
   such foulness was all fallen by my first failure to assume the god-form, and 
   their priestly falsehood that my sanctity had rapt me into heaven. Nor had the 
   wealth they lied to obtain availed them aught; for Pharaoh had descended upon 
   Thebai, and laid heavy hand upon the coffers of the temple, so that they were 
   poor. Even, they sold good auguries for gold; and these were a very destruction 
   to them that bought. Then they sold curses, and sowed discord in the city. Wherefore 
   the people grew poorer still, and their gifts to the temple waxed even less.</p>
 <p>For there is no foolishness like the hunger after gain.</p>
 <p>Of old the gods had given blessing, and the people offered freely of their 
   plenty.</p>
 <p>Now the priests sowed chaff, and reaped but barrenness.</p>
 <p>So I waited patiently in silence to see what might befall. And this foolish 
   priestess could think of no better expedient than formerly. But this young stupid 
   man had guessed how his predecessor was dead, and he touched not the sacraments; 
   but feigned.</p>
 <p>Then she called for me -- and I was now ordained priest -- to take counsel 
   of me; for she was minded to put me in his place.</p>
 <p>Thus she made a great banquet for me; and when we were well drunken she laid 
   her head upon my breast and said marvellous things to me of love, to me, who 
   had loved the Veiled One! But I feigned all the madness of passion and made 
   her drunk thereon, so that she talked great words, frothing forth like dead 
   fishes swollen in the sun, of how we should rule Thebai and (it might be) displace 
   Pharaoh and take his throne and sceptre. Yet, foolish woman! she could not think 
   now she might remove this stupid high priest, her own nominee! So I answered 
   her "Assume the Form of Osiris, and all will be well in the Temple of Osiris." 
   Mocking her, for I knew that she could not. Yet so drunken was she upon love 
   and wine that there and then she performed the ritual of Adoration and Assumption.</p>
 <p>Then I in merry mood put out my power, and caused her in truth to become Osiris, 
   so that she went icy stark,and her eyes fixed. ...</p>
 <p>Then she tried to shriek with fear, and could no; for I had put upon her the 
   silence of the tomb.</p>
 <p>But all the while I feigned wonder and applause, so that she was utterly deceived. 
   And being tired of mocking her, I bade her return. This she did, and knew not 
   what to say. At first she pretended to have received a great secret; then, knowing 
   how much higher was my grade initiation, dared not. Then, at last, being frightened, 
   she flung herself at my feet and confessed all, pleading that at least her love 
   for me was true. This may well have been; in any case I would have had compassion 
   upon her, for in sooth her body was like a flower, white and pure, though her 
   mouth was heavy and strong, her eyes wrinkled with lust, and her cheeks flaccid 
   with deceit.</p>
 <p>So I comforted her, pressing her soft body in mine arms, drinking the wine 
   of her eyes, feeding upon the honey of her mouth.</p>
 <p>Then at last I counselled her that she should bid him to a secret banquet, 
   and that I should serve them, disguised in my old dress as a serving-man.</p>
 <p>On the next night after this he came, and I served them, and she made open 
   Love (though feigned) to him. Yet subtly, so that he thought her the deer and 
   himself the lion. Then at last he went clean mad, and said: "I will give 
   thee what thou wilt for one kiss of that thy marvellous mouth." Then she 
   made him swear the oath by Pharaoh -- the which if he broke Pharaoh would have 
   his head -- and she kissed him once, as if her passion were like the passion 
   of Nile in flood for the sandy bars that it devoureth, and then leaping up, 
   answered him, "give me thine office of High Priest for this my lover!" 
   With that she took and fondled me. He gaped, aghast; then he took off the ring 
   of office and flung it at her feet; he spat one word in her face; he slunk away. 
   But I, picking up the ring of office, cried after him: "What shall be done 
   to who insulteth the High Priestess?"</p>
 <p>And he turned and answered sullenly: "I was the High Priest." "Thou 
   hadst no longer the ring!" she raged at him, her face white with fury, 
   her mouth dripping the foam of her anger -- for the word was a vile word! ...</p>
 <p>Then she smote upon the bell, and the guard appeared. At her order they brought 
   the instruments of death, and summoned the executioner, and left us there. Then 
   the executioner bound him to the wheel of iron by his ankles and his waist and 
   his throat; and he cut off his eyelids, that he might look upon his death. Then 
   with his shears he cut off the lips from him, saying, "With these lips 
   didst thou blaspheme the Holy One, the Bride of Osiris." Then one by one 
   he wrenched out the teeth of him, saying every time: "With this tooth didst 
   thou frame a blasphemy against the Holy One, the Bride of Osiris." Then 
   he pulled out the tongue with his pincers, saying: "With this tongue didst 
   thou speak blasphemy against the holy One, the Bride of Osiris." Then took 
   he a strong corrosive acid and blistered his throat therewith, saying: "From 
   this throat didst thou blaspheme the Holy One, the Bride of Osiris." Then 
   he took a rod of steel, white-hot, and burnt away his secret parts, saying: 
   "Be thou put to shame, who hast blasphemed the Holy One, the Bride of Osiris." 
   After that, he took a young jackal and gave it to eat at his liver, saying: 
   "Let the beasts that devour carrion devour the liver that lifted itself 
   up toe blaspheme the Holy One, the Bride of Osiris!" With that the wretch 
   died,and they exposed his body in the ditch of the city, and the dogs devoured 
   it.</p>
 <p>Now all this while had my lady dallied amorously with me, making such sweet 
   moan of love as never was, yet her face fixed upon his eyes who loved her, and 
   there glared in hell's torment, the body ever striving against the soul which 
   should exceed.</p>
 <p>And, as I judge, but the favour of Set the soul gat mastery therein.</p>
 <p>Also, though I write it now, coldly, these many thousand years afterward, never 
   had I such joy of love of any woman as with her, and at that hour, so that as 
   I write it I remember well across the mist of time every honey word she spoke, 
   every witching kiss (our mouths strained sideways) that she sucked from my fainting 
   lips, every shudder of her soft strong body. I remember the jewelled coils of 
   hair, how they stung like adders as they touched me; the sharp rapture of her 
   pointed nails pressing me, now velvet-soft, now capricious-cruel, now (love-maddened) 
   thrust deep to draw blood, as they played up and down my spine. But I saw nothing; 
   by Osiris I swear it! I saw nothing, save only the glare in the eyes of that 
   lost soul that writhed upon the wheel.</p>
 <p>Indeed, as the hangman took out the corpse, we fell back and lay there among 
   the waste of the banquet, the flagons overturned, the napery awry, the lamps 
   extinct or spilt, the golden cups, chased with obscene images, thrown here and 
   there, the meats hanging over the edge of their bejewelled dishes, their juice 
   staining the white luxury of the linen; and in the midst ourselves, our limbs 
   as careless as the wind, motionless.</p>
 <p>One would have said: the end of the world is come. But through all that fiery 
   abyss of sleep wherein I was plunged so deep, still stirred the cool delight 
   of the knowledge that I had won the hand for which I played, that I was High 
   Priest of Osiris in thebai.</p>
 <p>But in the morning we rose and loathed each other, our mouths awry, our tongues 
   hanging loose from their corners like thirsty dogs, our eyes blinking in agony 
   from the torture of daylight, our limbs sticky with stale sweat. Therefore we 
   rose and saluted each other in the dignity of our high offices; and we departed 
   one from the other, and purified ourselves.</p>
 <p>Then I went unto the Ceremony of Osiris, and for the last time the shameful 
   farce was played.</p>
 <p>But in my heart I vowed secretly to cleanse the temple of its chicanery and 
   folly. Therefore at the end of the ceremony did I perform a mighty banishing, 
   a banishing of all things mortal and immortal, even from Nuit that circleth 
   infinite Space unto Hadit the Core of Things; from Amoun that ruleth before 
   all the Gods unto Python the terrible Serpent that abideth at the end of things, 
   from Ptah the god of the pure soul of aethyr unto besz the brute force of that 
   which is grosser than earth, which hath no name, which is denser than lead and 
   more rigid than steel; which is blacker than the thick darkness of the abyss, 
   yet is within all and about all.</p>
 <p>Amen!</p>
 <p>Then during the day I took counsel with myself, and devised a cunning to match 
   the cunning of them that had blasphemed Osiris, who had at last become my God.</p>
 <p>Yea! bitterly would I avenge him on the morrow.</p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="9">CHAPTER IX</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>NOW this was the manner of my working, that I inspired the High Priestess to 
   an Oracle, so that she prophesied, saying that Osiris should never be content 
   with his servants unless they had passed the four ordeals of the elements. Now 
   of old these rituals had been reserved for a special grade of initiation. The 
   chapter was therefore not a little alarmed, until they remembered how shamefully 
   all the true magic was imitated, so that the rumour went that this was but a 
   device of the High Priestess to increase the reputation of the temple fore sanctity. 
   And, their folly confirming them in this, they agreed cheerfully and boasted 
   themselves. Now then did I swathe them one by one in the grave-clothes of Osiris, 
   binding upon the breast and image, truly consecrated, of the god, with a talisman 
   against the four elements.</p>
 <p>Then I set them one by one upon a narrow and lofty tower, balanced, so that 
   the least breath of wind would blow them off into destruction.</p>
 <p>Those whom the air spared I next threw into Nile where most it foams and races. 
   Only a few the water gave back again. These, however, did I bury for three days 
   in the earth without sepulchre or coffin, so that the element of earth might 
   combat them. And the rare ones whom earth spared I cast upon a fire of charcoal. 
 </p>
 <p>Now who is prepared for these ordeals (being firstly attuned to the elements) 
   findeth them easy. He remains still, though the tempest rage upon the tower; 
   in the water he floats easily and lightly; buried, he but throws himself into 
   trance; and, lastly, his wrappings protect him against the fire, though all 
   Thebai went to feed the blaze.</p>
 <p>But it was not so with this bastard priesthood of Osiris. For of the three 
   hundred only nine were found worthy. The High Priestess, however, I brought 
   through by my magic, for she had amused me mightily, and I took great pleasure 
   in her love, that was wilder than the rage of all the elements in one.</p>
 <p>So I called together the nine who had survived, all being men, and gave them 
   instruction and counsel, that they should form a secret brotherhood to learn 
   and to teach the formula of the Osiris in its supreme function of initiating 
   the human soul. That they should keep discipline in the temple only for the 
   sake of the people, permitting every corruption yet withdrawing themselves from 
   it. Is not the body perishable, and the skin most pure? So also he ancient practice 
   of embalming should fall into desuetude, and that soon; for the world was past 
   under the rule of Osiris, who loveth the charnel and the tomb.</p>
 <p>All being sworn duly into this secret brotherhood I appointed them, one to 
   preside over each grade, and him of the lowest grade to select the candidates 
   and to govern the temple.</p>
 <p>Then did I perform the invoking Ceremony of Osiris, having destroyed the blasphemous 
   machinery; and now at last did the God answer me, glittering with infinite brilliance. 
   Then I disclosed myself to the Priests, and they rejoiced exceedingly that after 
   all those years the old lie was abolished, and the master come back to his own.</p>
 <p>But the god uttered an Oracle, saying: "This last time shall I glitter 
   with brilliance in My temple; for I am the god of Life in Death, concealed. 
   Therefore shall your magic henceforth be a magic most secret in the heart; and 
   whoso shall perform openly any miracle, him shall ye know for a liar and a pretender 
   to the sacred wisdom.</p>
 <p>"For this cause am I wrapped ever in a shroud of white starred with the 
   three active colours; these things conceal Me, so that he who knoweth Me hath 
   passed beyond them."</p>
 <p>Then did the god call us each separately to him, and in each ear did he whisper 
   a secret formula and a word of power, pertaining to the grade to which I had 
   appointed him.</p>
 <p>But to me he gave the supreme formula and the supreme word, the word that hath 
   eight-and-seventy letters, the formula that hath five-and-sixty limbs.</p>
 <p>So then I devoted myself there and then to a completer understanding of Osiris 
   my God, so that I might discover his function in the whole course of the Cosmos.</p>
 <p>For he that is born in the years of the power of a God thinketh that God to 
   be eternal, one, alone. But he that is born in the hour of the weakness of the 
   God, at the death of one and the birth of the other, seeith something (though 
   it be little) of the course of things. And for him it is necessary to understand 
   fully that change of office (for the gods neither die nor are re- born, but 
   now one initiates and the other guards, and now one heralds and the other sanctifies) 
   its purpose and meaning in the whole scheme of things.</p>
 <p>So I, in this year V of the Equinox of the Gods (1908) wherein Horus took the 
   place of Osiris, will by the light of this my magical memory seek to understand 
   fully the formula of Horus -- Ra Hoor Khuit -- my god, that ruleth the world 
   under Nuit and Hadit. Then as Ankh-f-na-khonsu left unto me the stelé 666 with 
   the keys to that knowledge, so also may I write down in hieroglyph the formula 
   of the Lady of the Forked Wand and of the Feather, that shall assume his throne 
   and place when the strength of Horus is exhausted. So now the service of the 
   Gods was to be secret and their magic concealed from men. They were to fall 
   before the eyes of men from their place, and little sewer-rats were to come 
   and mock at them, no man avenging them, and they utterly careless, not striking 
   for themselves. Yet was there knowledge of them which an initiate might gain, 
   though so much more difficult, immeasurably higher and more intimate.</p>
 <p>My life from this moment became highly concentrated upon itself. I had no time 
   either for ascetic practices or for any pleasures; nor would I take any active 
   part in the service of the temple which, purified and regenerated, had become 
   both subtly perfect and perfectly subtle.</p>
 <p>It was not all of the people who did at all comprehend the change that had 
   occurred; but the others obeyed and made believe to understand, lest their fellows 
   should despise them. So it happened that the more ignorant and stupid any person 
   was the more he feigned understanding; so that the least devout appeared the 
   most devout -- as it is unto this day.</p>
 <p>But for me all these things were as nothing; for I studied ever the nature 
   of Osiris, concentrating myself into mysterious pure symbols. I understood why 
   it was said that Isis had failed to discover the Phallus of Osiris, and thus 
   perceived the necessity of Horus to follow him in the great succession of the 
   Equinoxes. Moreover I fashioned talismans of pure light concerning Osiris, and 
   I performed in light all the ceremonies of initiation into his mysteries.</p>
 <p>These were interpreted by wise men and translated into the language of the 
   twilight and graven on stone and in the memories of men.</p>
 <p>Yet was I even more intrigued in that great struggle to apprehend the course 
   of things, as it is seen from the standpoint of Destiny. Sop that I might leave 
   true and intelligible images to enlighten the mind of him (whether myself or 
   another) that should come after me to celebrate the Equinox of the Gods at the 
   end of the period of Osiris.</p>
 <p>As now hath come to pass.</p>
 <p>Thus then three-and-thirty years I lived in the temple of Osiris a High Priest; 
   and I subdued all men under me. Also I abolished the office of priestess, for 
   had not Isis failed to find that venerable Phallus without which Osiris must 
   be so melancholy a god? Therefore Therefore was Khemi to fall, and the world 
   to be dark and sorrowful for many years.</p>
 <p>Therefore I made mine High Priestess into a serving-maid, and with veiled face 
   she served me all those many years, never speaking.</p>
 <p>Yet they being accomplished, I thought fit to reward her. So magically I renewed 
   about her the body of a young girl, and for a year she served me, unveiled and 
   speaking at her pleasure.</p>
 <p>And her time being come, she died.</p>
 <p>Then I looked again into my destiny, and perceived that all my work was duly 
   accomplished. nor could any use or worth be found in my body.</p>
 <p>so therefore I determined to accept my great reward, that was granted unto 
   me as the faithful minister of the god F.I.A.T. that is behind all manifestation 
   of Will and of Intelligence, of whom Isis and Osiris and Horus are but the ministers.</p>
 <p>Of this, and of my death, I will speak on another occasion.</p>
 <p>But first I will discourse of the inhabitants of the kingdom that encircleth 
   the world, so that they who fear may be comforted.</p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="10">CHAPTER X</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>BUT of these matters I am warned that I shall not now become aware, for that 
   there be great mysteries therein contained, pertaining to a degree of initiation 
   of which I am as yet unworthy.</p>
 <p>(Thus the record comes abruptly to an end.) </p>
