   THE LOST CONTINENT 
 </p><h2 class="heading" align="center">by Aleister Crowley</h2>
 <h3 class="heading" align="center">FORWARD</h3>
 <p>"In particular there is a sort of novel, "The Lost Continent", 
   purporting to give an account of the civilization of Atlantis. I sometimes feel 
   that this lacks artistic unity. At times it is a fantastic rhapsody describing 
   my ideals of Utopian society; but some passages are a satire on the conditions 
   of our existing civilization, while others convey hints of certain profound 
   magical secrets, or anticipations of discoveries in science."<br>
   --- Crowley, writing of the Summer of 1913 e.v. from Confessions, p. 730.</p>
 <h3 class="heading" align="center">PREFACE</h3>
 <p>Last year I was chosen to succeed the venerable K-Z --- who had it in his mind 
   to die, that is, to join Them in Venus, as one of the Seven Heirs of Atlantis, 
   and I have been appointed to declare, so far as may found possible, the truth 
   about that mysterious lost land. Of course, no more than one seventh of the 
   wisdom is ever confided to one of the Seven, and the Seven meet in council but 
   once in every thirty-three years. But its preservation is guaranteed by the 
   interlocked systems of "dreaming true" and of "preparation of 
   the antinomy." The former almost explains itself; the latter is almost 
   inconceivable to normal man. Its essence is to train a man to be anything by 
   training him to be its opposite. At the end of anything, think they, it turns 
   out to be its opposite, and that opposite is thus mastered without having been 
   soiled by the labours of the student, and without the false impressions of early 
   learning being left upon the mind.</p>
 <p>I myself, for example, had unknowingly been trained to record these observations 
   by the life of a butterfly. All my impressions came clear on the soft wax of 
   my brain; I had never worried because the scratch on the wax in no way resembled 
   the sound it represented. In other words, I observed perfectly because I never 
   knew that I was observing. So, if you pay sufficient attention to your heart, 
   you will make it palpitate.</p>
 <p>I accordingly proceed to a description of the country.</p>

 <h3 class="heading" align="center">OF THE PLAINS BENEATH ATLAS, AND ITS SERVILE 
   RACE.</h3>
 <p>Atlas is the true name of this archipelago --- continent is an altogether false 
   term, for every "house" or mountain peak was cut from its fellows 
   by natural, though often very narrow waterways. The African Atlas is a mere 
   offshoot of the range. It was the true Atlas that supported the ancient world 
   by its moral and magical strength, and hence the name of the fabled globe-bearer. 
   The root is the Lemurian "Tla" or "Tlas", black, for reasons 
   which will appear in due course. "A" is the feminine prefix, derived 
   from the shape of the mouth when uttering the sound. "Black woman" 
   is therefore as near a translation as one can give in English; the Latin has 
   aendered of the Virgin ("L") and the Serpent ("S"). "THEOS" 
   (root "O," first written "0") means the Sun in his strength 
   and also the Lingam-Yoni conjoined. "CHRISTOS" is "The love of 
   passion of the Rising Sun ("R") and the Serpent" ("S"). 
   The "I" and "T" indicate certain details which are foreign 
   to the present discussion. "NEUMA" (Atlantean "NM") is the 
   "Arch of the Woman," "MARIA," the Woman of the Sun.[23] 
   The words "MEITHRAS" and "ABRAXAS" are again derived from 
   Atlas. "The woman entered, Lingam being conjoined with Yoni, bears the 
   Sun from her serpent womb" and "From the womb's mouth the Sun (cometh 
   seeking) a womb for his desire, even the womb of a serpent," the course 
   of the year being signified in this manner, as usualy with the ancients. This 
   plain of an idea corresponding to each letter was carried out very strictly: 
   thus "TLA," black, means the stigma or mark of the virgin's womb, 
   "IA" (Hail! Greeting!) "Face to Face," from the other peculiarity 
   described above. These few examples will suffice to indicate the singular character 
   of the language,[24] and the way in which its essential dogmatic symbols have 
   been incorporated by the heirs of Atlas in the inmost sanctuaries of races which 
   they deemed worthy of such assistance.</p>
 <p>I must not pass over in silence the question of sacrifice to the gods, to which 
   a passing reference has already been made. Such sacrifices were not very frequent; 
   the victims were the "failures," those who were useless to the social 
   economy.<strong>[25]</strong> As they represented capital expenditure, the object 
   was to recover this, at least, since no interest could be expected. The victim 
   was therefore handed over to a High Priest or Priestess, who extracted the life 
   by an instrument devised for and excellently adapted to the purpose, so that 
   it died of exhaustion. The life thus regained was given to "the gods" 
   in a manner too complex to be described in this brief account.</p>
 <p>The early age at which puberty occurred was due to design. The normal period 
   of gestation had also been shortened to four months. This was all part of the 
   scheme to economize time. Old age had been almost done away with by the great 
   readiness of the Atlanteans to "go and see" at the first sign of failing 
   power. No doubt, further improvements would have been made but for the loss 
   of interest in the matter, all generation being regarded as "the old experiment," 
   not likely to repay the trouble of further research. In the 200 or 300 years 
   of a man's full vigour, only 8 years on the average was the wastage of childhood, 
   and even this was not all waste, since some time at least must be necessary 
   for the experts to discover and direct the tendencies of the mind. The body 
   ought therefore to be regarded as an engine, the theoretical limit of whose 
   efficiency had been reached.</p>
 <p>So much I mention of the customs of the Atlanteans with regard to marriage, 
   education and religious sacrifices.</p>

 <h3 class="heading" align="center">VIII</h3>
 <h3 class="heading" align="center">OF THE HISTORY OF ATLAS, FROM<br>
   ITS EARLIEST ORIGINS TO THE<br>
   PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING<br>
   THE CATASTROPHE.</h3>
 <p>The origin of Atlas is lost in the obscurity of antiquity. The official religious 
   explanation is this: "We came across the waters on the living Atla," 
   which is pious but improbable. A mystic meaning is to be suspected. The lay 
   historian says "We came, escaping from destruction, eight persons in a 
   ship, bearing the living Zro." This reminds me one of later legends of 
   presumably equal value. Poets frankly claim "We descended from heaven," 
   and it has been seriously urged that seafarers would have preferred the plains 
   to the rocks. The law of contrariety to Nature explains this away. Others maintain 
   that the earliest settlers came "by air," or "through air." 
   This must mean balloons or airplanes, as flying was not known until centuries 
   after. What is definitely known is that the earliest settlers were of a purely 
   fighting race.</p>
 <p>An Atlantean Homer, Ylo, has described the first battle in such detail as to 
   leave no doubt that he is retelling facts --- a marked contradiction to his 
   earlier books. There appear to have been but few Atlanteans, unless the names 
   given are those of chiefs, which internal evidence contraverts. The natives 
   were armed with every possible instrument of precision, having cavalry and artillery 
   in abundance, as well as weapons that must have been as superior to the modern 
   rifle (unless Ylo exaggerates) as that is to the arquebus. In spite of this 
   the men of Atlas "smote them with rods" or "fell upon them with 
   their cones," and routed them utterly. This mention of rods and cones has 
   absurdly suggested to commentators that the Atlanteans used their eyes, and 
   hypnotized the enemy. To state such an opinion is sufficient to expose its author 
   to the contempt of the thoughtful. Altogether 86 battles were fought, extending 
   over five years, before the natives were reduced to sue for peace. This was 
   granted on generous terms, which the colonists broke, as soon as they dared 
   to do so, in accordance with the invariable rule of colonists, then as much 
   as today. However, it was nigh on an hundred years before the first college 
   of Magic was established. Previously the Atla had been carried about as occasion 
   demanded. It was now enshrined with some decency of ceremonial upon a mountain. 
   About three hundred years later we find ourselves face to face with the first 
   great Mystery of Atlas. This is a translation of the record of that most strange 
   event.</p>
 <p>"Now it came to pass that all men turned black and died, and that the 
   living Atla abode alone, bearing Mercury, whereof the Sun knoweth. Thus came 
   again the true men of Atlas, and their women, bearing gods and goddesses. And 
   the void suffered nothing, and the earth was at peace. Now then indeed arose 
   Art, and men builded, being blind. And there was light, and some of the light 
   wrought mischief. Wherefore the wise men destroyed them with their Magic, and 
   there is no record because it is written in that which is." A sort of "Si" 
   "monumentum quaeris, circumspice" seems here implied. In any case 
   there were clearly two gaps unbridgeable between the early struggles of the 
   settlers, the period of great buildings, and the modern period, which proved 
   stable of "houses." The "houses" were only made possible 
   by the perfecting of Zro, and this helps considerably to fix the date. The next 
   2500 years were years of peaceable progress; the labour-mills were run without 
   a hitch, and the next event was the discovery of black phophorus. It had been 
   the custom to worship the Atla with lights, and these lights had been candles 
   of yellow phosphorus in golden sheathes. At that time the Atla was veiled. At 
   one festival of Spring the veils were burnt up, the lights extinguished, and 
   the yellow phosphorus was found to have been turned into the black powder. The 
   Magicians examined this, and brought Zro to its ninth stage. This revolutionized 
   the condition of things: old age and disease were no more, and death voluntary. 
   Strangely enough this led directly to the Great Conspiracy.</p>
 <p>At the end of this period of 2500 years the system of "houses" was 
   well established. There were over 400 such "houses," each of perhaps 
   1000 souls on an average. These were governed by 4 "houses of houses" 
   whose rulers took orders from the High House, at the head of which was the living 
   Atla. The plain principle of Atla was revolution; and like all revolutionary 
   bodies, was obliged to adopt the strictest form of autocracy. A democracy is 
   always soddenly conservative. The only hope is to catch it in one of its moments 
   of crazy enthusiasm, and crush it before it has time to recover. Caesar and 
   Napoleon both did this as far as they could: Cromwell and Porfirio Diaz did 
   the same within narrower limits.</p>
 <p>Now a certain sophist --- for philosopher one cannot call him --- tried to 
   enunciate a magical law to the effect that the present standard of life was 
   all that could be desired; that further progress would be harmful, that Venus 
   was not worth attaining, and that the sole endeavour of the Magicians should 
   be to preserve things as they were. That such a proposition could be supposed 
   a "law" reflects no credit on its author or its supporters. Yet of 
   these it found many. The ninth stage of Zro was a leap calculated to unsettle 
   the calmest mind. Its reality had begared the optimist's daydream. Poets had 
   thrown down their stilettos.<strong>[26]</strong> High Priests who had spent 
   decades in hopeful experiment saw their results attained by an entirely different 
   method. In short, two thirds of the people were infected with the heresy, and 
   hoped to hear it promulgated as a Law of Magic.</p>
 <p>It should here be explained that every Law of Magic had its turn as the principal 
   law of practical working, and the school supporting any law, or insisting on 
   it, became prominent with it. Every dominant law in all history had always been 
   made insignificant by a new discovery about Zro, or other matter of practical 
   importance, just as the "Peace with Honour" battle-cry of Disraeli 
   was drowned by the calculation of the cost of warships, soldiers and patriotism. 
   Each step in Zro had consequently implied the rise to power of a new school; 
   and the sophist was ambitious, and yet the law he wished to establish was the 
   ruling law of the servile races.</p>
 <p>The "law" was accordingly sent to the High House for approval. Some 
   opposition may have been forseen, but no one was prepared for the blackness 
   of disapproval which actually radiated, striking hearts cold. A course without 
   precedent, no answer was vouchsafed. On the contrary, even normal communication 
   was suspended. The houses which favoured the innovation --- 333 in numbers --- 
   took counsel, came to the decision that it was useless to oppose the High House, 
   and were about to acquiesce, when a woman who had once been in the presence 
   of "To Her" rose and thought vehemently "The Living Atla is the 
   head of our conspiracy." In other words, they were the loyalists, the Magicians 
   of the High House the rebels. This was why they had cut themselves off, because 
   their own head was against them. It was instantly resolved to go to the High 
   House, and demand the custody of "To Her." Nearing the goal, however, 
   a remnant of the ancient reverence half cowed even the ringleaders --- I may 
   mention that five of every six of the heretics were women --- when they saw 
   a stern phalanx of Magicians, its point threatening their centre. As they wavered, 
   a woman cried "They are only men such as we are." The ranks stiffened; 
   on all sides the army closed upon the tiny phalanx, which only numbered 66 all 
   told. It was then that the truth was known. Ere a blow could be struck, the 
   attacking party vanished;</p>

 </blockquote>
 <p>*************</p>
 <p>it was instantaneous and complete annihilation. From that moment it was certain 
   that the ruling power in Atlas was Something<strong>[27]</strong> infinitely 
   more awful than the Living Atla. In order to avoid any possible repetition of 
   such a disaster --- for the Magicians of the High House knew that any manifestation 
   of the Supreme must undo the work of centuries --- they gave out that they had 
   become too terrible to look upon, and for the future they always appeared with 
   heavy veils, or rather masks, since for the most part they were carven fantastically 
   by the wearers in their leisure hours. A further alteration was made in the 
   system of government. The head of one of the "houses of houses" was 
   made supreme: the High House took no part in affairs of state. Thus the Atla 
   was to all intents and purposes deposed, although the same reverence and sacrifice 
   were paid to it as formerly. It became a "constitutional monarch," 
   in our modern jargon.</p>
 <p>The next thousand years were years of serious trial in other ways. The toil 
   of repopulation was excessive, and there was a revolt or rather strike of the 
   servile races, which was ended by the substitution of "bread from heaven" 
   for those products of the earth on which they had formerly been fed, a diet 
   which proved so adapted to their natures that no labour troubles ever recurred.</p>
 <p>The Greek legends of the wars between Gods, giants, Titans are traditional 
   of a real war or series of wars which continued with intervals over 200 years. 
   The enemy had developed naval armament to an extreme. Their tactics were these:</p>
 <p>1. To wipe out the servile races and so to interfere with the production of 
   Zro.</p>
 <p>2. To rush and destroy the High House.</p>
 <p>The first of these met with a great deal of success, the floating rock being 
   struck with projectiles and sunk. This occurred chiefly on the outlaying islands, 
   where they were not too much afraid to make raids in force. They also sent epidemic 
   disease of many kinds. Atlas was reduced to such extremity in these ways that 
   at one time the waterways were forced and the assault on the High House was 
   actually carried out, bombardment continuing day and night for months together. 
   Through a misunderstanding of well known magical law, Atlanteans at that time 
   considered themselves prohibited from employing any other defence than the rods 
   and the cones of their forefathers; and these, it appears, were useless against 
   machinery, or against men protected by fortification in such a way that they 
   could not be got at from any quarter. Thus the sharklike submarines of the enemy 
   were unassailable. The war was therefore at first entirely one-sided. A certain 
   youthful Magician, however, resolving to die for his country if need were, decided 
   to retaliate. He had found that Zro in its nascent state ("i.e." between 
   the globes) had the power of bringing about endothermic reaction, seawater for 
   example, becoming caustic soda and hydrochloric acid; and further that this 
   acid thus produced was many thousand times more active than in its normal state. 
   For example, the rock basins in which he conducted his first experiment dissolved 
   as rapidly as butter under boiling oil. He then prepared a number of pairs of 
   receiver-globes, and dropped them in the vicinity of the enemy's submarines 
   by night. In this manner he destroyed the hulls of almost the whole fleet in 
   a single night; and the remainder fled in panic at dawn. They returned the following 
   year, carrying out daylight raids only and devoting themselves chiefly to destroying 
   the labour-mills. The young magician had been rewarded for his services by being 
   presented to the Atla, and this example encouraged others to find means of attacking 
   the invaders. Artificial darkness was therefore invented, and combined with 
   the former method; but this was only partially successful, the tremendous pace 
   of the "sharks" enabling them to evade any threatening clouds. They 
   did enormous</p>

   <p><font size="2">[#27] This matter is not for open discussion. Even at this 
     distant date it would be dangerous to do so much even as indulge in speculation.</font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>*************</p>
 <p>damage, and the supplies of Zro were seriously curtailed. Things now went from 
   bad to worse, and culminated in the attack on the High House, the besiergers 
   keeping their battleships surrounded by rafts of fire, so that attack was impossible 
   even by night. It was then that the High House called on the heorism of its 
   sons. Armed with long swords of Zro, they plunged into the sea, to perish under 
   the tooth of the "Zhee-Zhou," but not before they had time to hack 
   the invading battleships to shreds. Their floating torch-rafts only assisted 
   the attack by directing the swimmers to their quarry. The attack on the High 
   House had aroused Atlas at last. A counter invasion was plotted and carried 
   out with immediate and complete success, the enemy being exterminated, and their 
   country not merely ravaged but destroyed by arousing the forces of earthquake. 
   All activity of this kind however was deprecable, a recurrence was guarded against 
   by removing the High House to the lofty mountain previously described, and a 
   "house" was chosen to cultivate the art of war, and entrusted with 
   the duty of destroying any living thing that might approach within a hundred 
   miles of Atlas.</p>
 <p>Only one other adventure of historical importance remains to be recorded. It 
   is the attempt of some foolish Atlanteans to found an "Empire," and 
   so to be entirely distinguished from the missionary effort referred to previously. 
   The original settlement of Atlas, as has been the case with all flourishing 
   colonies, was made by a few hardy pioneers, who strengthened themselves gradually 
   by growth. But Atlas in her momentary madness poured out blood and treasure 
   in the fatuous attempt to impose alien domination on lands utterly unsuited 
   to the genius of the people. The idea, of course, was to increase the supply 
   of labour and consequently of crude Zro. In the first place the adventure was 
   expensive. It was uneconomical (in the scientific sense) to send ships with 
   less than 1000 fighting men. The Zro required for these meant the employment 
   of at least 7000 serviles, and the naval construction was therefore of a colossal 
   order. But although little difficulty was found in conquering the country in 
   the military sense, the natives had to be almost exterminated, and the labour 
   of the survivors proved difficult to enforce. It was even then not a tenth as 
   efficient as that of the serviles at home. The imported serviles moreover caught 
   native diseases, and died in hundreds; and though by prodigious sacrifices the 
   West African Empire was kept going for nearly 200 years, it had to end at last 
   no less ingloriously than the French adventure in Mexico, or the English in 
   India, and South Africa.<strong>[28]</strong></p>
 <p>The main causes were the impossibility of breeding children in a climate so 
   unsuitable, even of maintaining their own women, and above all the fact that 
   the crude Zro was not of a quality equal to that obtained in Atlas, and that 
   the Zro generated by the Atlanteans themselves was not to be made at all outside 
   their own country. The lesson was learnt. Until the end no further attempt was 
   made to advance in any but the true direction. The great majority of the colonists 
   returned to Atlas; but many, degenerating as is the fashion with colonists of 
   this conquering kind, abandoned Zro for gross food, intermarried with the natives, 
   and have generally degenerated yet further to races inferior even to the present 
   descendants of those who were in those days the equivalents of the serviles 
   of Atlas.</p>

     To illustrate the theory here advanced I will ask the reader to compare the

 <h3 class="heading" align="center">IX</h3>
 <h3 class="heading" align="center">OF THE CATASTROPHE,<br>
   ITS ANTECEDENTS AND<br>
   PRESUMED CAUSES.</h3>
 <p>In my remarks on Zro I have a necessarily somewhat diffuse account of the properties 
   of this remarkable substance. It must now be made clearer that the crude Zro 
   in its nine stages produced by the serviles, and consumed in the "houses" 
   was in each stage of inferior quality to that of the same degree produced by 
   the Atlanteans, and consumed by the High House. For example, the crude Zro was 
   made in a labour-mill with all sorts of insulations. The first stage of the 
   priest's Zro could be made anywhere and at any time, and naturally directed 
   itself to the receptable for it without any precautions. It must, I think, be 
   presumed that the Zro generated in the High House was again of far greater purity 
   and potency. Very little of it can have been used in the experiments of the 
   Magicians, and it is therefore necessary to account for enormous quantities, 
   produced during many centuries of uninterrupted labour. I have, however, no 
   data of any kind for this investigation; the mysteries of the High House have 
   ever been inscrutable, and were not wholly delivered to the Heirs of Atlas. 
   They must be rediscovered by the Magicians of the new race. It may be that in 
   some form or other the Zro had been made stable, and used to impregnate the 
   column which is alleged to have been driven "through the Earth"; perhaps, 
   and less improbably, only to the depth of a few hundred miles. This column, 
   however long it may have been, had certainly its top immediately beneath the 
   reservoir of the High House. It had been completed about 70 years before the 
   "catastrophe" but apparently no effort was made to utilize it in any 
   way. To me it appears probable that in some one mind the whole "catastrophe" 
   was brooding, that the column was part of the device, and that the event which 
   I shall now describe was the other part.</p>
 <p>This event was the birth of a child in the High House, a child without the 
   distinguishing mark of the daughters of Atlas. That any child at all should 
   have been born there is so incredible that I am inclined to suspect an improper 
   use of the word "born." I think rather that a Magician brought Zro 
   to its eleventh stage, when it takes human form, and lives! The alternative 
   theory is that of the "Angel of Venus" described in the chapter on 
   the Underground Gardens of Atlas. The supporters of this theory hold that the 
   child was not born of a Priestess, but of the Living Atla.</p>
 <p>In any case, the whole country gave itself up to unbridled rejoicing. Work 
   was carried on at a greater speed than ever before: one might say a delirium 
   of labour. For eleven years this continued without cessation, and then without 
   warning came the order to repair to the High House --- every man, woman and 
   child of Atlas. What was then done, I know not, and dare not guess; that same 
   day seven volunteers, heroic exiles from the reward of so many centuries of 
   toil, voluntary maroons on the discarded planet, the Heirs of Atlas, turned 
   their faces from the High House, and severally sought distant mountains, there 
   each to guard his share of the Secrets of the Holy Race, and in due time to 
   discover and train up fit children of other races of the Earth so that one day 
   another people might be founded to undertake another such task as that now ended.</p>
 <p>Hardly had the pinnacle of Atlas melted into the sea behind them, than the 
   "catastrophe" occurred. The High House and the column beneath it, 
   with all the inhabitants of Atlas, shot from the Earth with the vehemence of 
   a million lightnings, bound for that green blaze of glory that scintillated 
   in the West above the sunset.</p>
 <p>Instantly the Earth, its god departed, gave itself up to anguish. The sea rushed 
   unto the void of the column and in a thousand earthquakes Atlas, "houses" 
   and plains together were overwhelmed forever in the ocean. Tidal waves rolled 
   round the world; everywhere great floods carried away villages and towns; earthquakes 
   roocked and tempest roared; tumult was triumphant. For years after the catastrophe 
   the dying tremors of the Event still shook mankind with fear.<strong>[29]</strong> 
   And the eternal waves of the great mother rolled over Atlas, save where Earth 
   in her agony thrust up gaunt pinnacles, bare masts of wreckage to mark the vanished 
   continent. Save for its heirs, of whose successors it is my highest honour to 
   be the youngest and the least worthy, oblivion fell, like one last night in 
   which the Sun should be forever extinct, upon the land of Atlas and its people.<br>
   Shall such high purpose fail of emulation, such achievement and example not 
   excite us to like striving? Then let Earth fall indeed from her high place in 
   heaven, and mankind be outcast forever from the Sun! Men of Earth! Seek out 
   the heirs of Atlas; let them order you into a phalanx, let them build you into 
   a pyramid; that may pierce that appointed which awaits you, to establish a new 
   dynasty of Atlanteans to be the mainstay and mainspring of the Earth, the pioneers 
   of their own path to heaven, and to our lord and Father, the Sun! And he put 
   his hand upon his thigh, and swore it.</p>
 <p>By the ineffable " ," "Tla," and the holy Zro, did he swear 
   it, and entered into the body of the new Atla that is alive upon the Earth.</p>
