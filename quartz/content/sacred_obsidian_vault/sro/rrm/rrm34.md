 <p>IN the following part of our book we supply, in a series of figures, the succession of changes to which the most ancient head-covering--in itself a significant hieroglyph--the Phrygian cap, the classic Mithraic cap, the sacrificial cap, or <i>bonnet conique</i>, all deducing from a common symbolical ancestor, became subject, The Mithraic or Phrygian cap is the origin of the priestly mitre in all faiths. It was worn by the priest in sacrifice. When worn by a male, it had its crest, comb, or point, set jutting forward; when worn by a female, it bore the same prominent part of the cap in reverse, or on the nape of the neck, as in the instance of the Amazon's helmet, displayed in all old sculptures, or that of Pallas-Athene, as exhibited in the figures of Minerva. The peak, <i>pic</i>, or point, of caps or hats (the term 'cocked hat' is a case .in point) all refer to the same idea. This point had a sanctifying meaning afterwards attributed to it, when it was called the <i>christa</i>, <i>crista</i>, or crest, which signifies a triumphal top, or tuft. The 'Grenadier Cap', and the loose black Hussar Cap, derive remotely from the same sacred, Mithraic, or emblematical bonnet, or high pyramidal-cap. It, in this instance, changes to black, because it is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_281"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 281</font></a></p>  
 <p>devoted to the illustration of the 'fire-workers' (grenadiers), who, among modern military, succeed the Vulcanists, <i>Cyclopes</i>, classic 'smiths', or servants of Vulcan, or Mulciber, the artful worker among the metals in the fire, or amidst the forces of nature. This idea will be found by a reference to the high cap among the Persians, or Fire-Worshippers; and to the black cap among the Bohemians and in the East. All travellers in Eastern lands will remember that the tops of the minarets reminded them of the high-pointed black caps of the Persians.</p>  
 <p>The Phrygian Cap is a most recondite antiquarian form; the symbol comes from the highest antiquity. It is displayed on the head of the figure sacrificing in the celebrated sculpture, called the 'Mithraic Sacrifice' (or the Mythical Sacrifice), in the British Museum. This loose cap, with the point protruded, gives the original form from which all helmets or defensive headpieces, whether Greek or Barbarian, deduce. As a Phrygian Cap, or Symbolizing Cap, it is always <i>sanguine</i> in its colour. It then stands as the 'Cap of Liberty', a revolutionary form; also, in another way, it is even a civic or <i>incorporated</i> badge. It is always masculine in its meaning. It marks the 'needle' of the obelisk, the crown or tip of the <i>phallus</i>, whether 'human' or representative. It has its origin in the rite of circumcision--unaccountable as are both the symbol and the rite.</p>  
 <p>The real meaning of the <i>bonnet rouge</i>, or 'cap of liberty', has been involved from time immemorial in deep obscurity, notwithstanding that it has always been regarded as a most important hieroglyph or figure. It signifies the supernatural simultaneous 'sacrifice' and 'triumph'. It has descended from the time of Abraham, and it is supposed to emblem the strange mythic rite of the '<i>circumcisio preputii</i>'. The loose</p>  
 <p><a name="page_282"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 282</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Phrygian bonnet, <i>bonnet conique</i>, or 'cap of liberty' may be accepted as figuring, or standing for, that detached integument or husk, separated from a certain point or knob, which has various names in different languages, and which supplies the central idea of this 'sacrificial rite--the spoil or refuse of which (absurd and unpleasant as it may seem) is borne aloft at once as a 'trophy' and as the 'cap of liberty'. It is now a magic sign, and becomes a talisman of supposedly inexpressible power--from what particular dark reason it would be difficult to say. The whole is a sign of 'initiation', and of baptism of a peculiar kind. The Phrygian cap, ever after this first inauguration, has stood as the sign of the 'Enlightened'. The heroic figures in most Gnostic Gems, which we give in our illustrations, have caps of this kind. The sacrificer in the sculptured group of the 'Mithraic Sacrifice', among the marbles in the British Museum, has a Phrygian cap on his head, whilst in the act of striking the Bull with the poniard--meaning the office of the immolating priest. The <i>bonnet conique</i> is the mitre of the Doge of Venice.</p>  
 <p>Besides the <i>bonnet rouge</i>, the Pope's mitre--nay, all mitres or conical head-coverings--have their name from the terms 'Mithradic', or 'Mithraic'. The origin of this whole class of names is Mittra, or Mithra. The cap of the grenadier, the shape of which is alike all over Europe, is related to the Tartar lambskin caps, which are dyed black; and it is black also from its association with Vulcan and the 'Fire-Worshippers' (Smiths). The Scotch Glengarry cap will prove on examination to be only a 'cocked' Phrygian. All the black conical caps, and the meaning of this strange symbol, came from the East. The loose black fur caps derive from the Tartars.</p>

 <p>Few would suspect the uniform of the Hussars to have had a religious origin; both the flaps which depend from their bushy fur caps, and the loose jacket or <i>dolman</i> which hangs from their left shoulder, are mythic.

The Hussars wear the original fur cap of Tubal-Cain, or the Smiths, or 'Artful Workers in Nature'. The name Hussar is borrowed from the Oriental exclamation to (or invocation of) 'Al <i>huza</i>', 'Al-husa', or Venus, or Aphrodite--the original patroness of these Ishmaelitish irregular light troops. The <i>dolman</i> or pelisse, properly worn on the left shoulder of the Hussar, has its signification and origin in the following act related in Scripture, which refers to a certain Rosicrucian myth: 'Shem and Japheth took a garment'</p>

It is astonishing how successfully this mythic act, with its original strange Rosicrucian meaning, should have been hidden away in this apparently little corresponding, trivial fact, of the wearing of the Hussar loose cloak or pelisse (<i>pallium</i> or pall) on the left or sinister shoulder; which is the shoulder nearest to the <i>woman:</i> because the <i>Talmudists say that Man was Made from the left hand</i>.</p>  
 <p>Regarding the Templar <i>insignia</i>, we may make the following remarks. The famous flag, or 'Beauséant', was their distinguishing symbol. Beauséant--that is to say, in the Gallic tongue, <i>Bien-séant</i>; because they are fair and honourable to the friends of Christ, but black and terrible to His enemies: 'Vexillum bipartitum, ex Albo et Nigro, quod nominant "Beau-séant", id est; Gallica lingua, "<i>Bien-séant</i>", eo quod Christi amices candidi sunt et benigni, inimices vero terribiles atque nigri' (Jac. de Vitr. <i>Hist. Hierosol</i>. apud <i>Gesta Dei</i>, cap. lxv).</p>  
 <p><a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 286</font></a></p>  
 <p>The Cardinal de Vitry is totally uninformed as to the meaning and purpose indicated in this mysterious banner. Its black and white was originally derived from the Egyptian sacred 'black and white', and it conveys the same significant meanings.</p>  
 <p>Now, in the heraldic sense--as we shall soon see--there is no colour <i>white</i>. <i>Argent</i> is the silver of the moon's light, the light of the 'woman'; or it is light generally, in opposition to darkness, which is the absence of all colour. White is the synthesis and identity of <i>all</i> the colours--in other words, it is light. Thus white is blazoned, in the correct heraldic sense, as also in reference to its humid, feminine origin (for, as the old heralds say, 'light was begotten of darkness', and its 'type, product, and representative, woman, also'), as the melancholy or silver light of the moon, 'Argent'; also, in the higher heraldic grade, 'Pearl', as signifying tears; lastly, 'Luna', whose figure or mark is the crescent <a name="img_28600"></a>
 <img src="img/28600.jpg">, or <a name="img_28601"></a>
 <img src="img/28601.jpg">; which is either the new moon (or the moon of hope), or the moon of the Moslem (or 'horned moon resting on her back'). Black (or <i>sable</i>, <i>sab</i>., <i>sabbat</i>, <i>Sat</i>., Saturn) is the absence of light, and is blazoned 'sable', diamond (carbon, or the densest of matter), 'without form and void', but cradle of possibilities, 'end' being taken as synonymous with 'beginning'. It is <i>sab</i>., or Saturn, whose mark is ♄, and who is both masculine and feminine--sex being indifferent to this 'Divine Abstraction, whose face is masked in Darkness.'</p>  
 <p><i>Lykos</i>--'wolf', <i>lykê</i>--'light'; whence comes <i>Lux</i> (Volney, 1st English edition, 1792, p. 378). 'Je' and 'V' are of Tartar origin. It is probable that St. John's College at Cambridge is the <i>Domus Templi</i> of the Round Church of the Templars there. The present St. John's is only of modern foundation. There is annexed to, or connected with, this church</p>

 <p>an almshouse called 'Bede's House', the name of which has puzzled all the antiquaries. There is little doubt that this was the original <i>Domus Templi</i>, the house of Buddha, corrupted into Bede, and meaning 'wisdom'.</p>

By Giles Fletcher, Doctor of Both Laws, and sometime Ambassador from Elizabeth, Queen of England, to the Emperor of Russia</i>. This was found in Sir Francis Nethersole's study after his death (<i>Memoirs of the Life of William Whiston</i>, 1749)</p>  
 <p>Mr. Cavendish, an eminent chemist, 'had reason to be persuaded that the <i>very water itself</i> consisted solely of inflammable air united to dephlogisticated air.' This last conclusion has since been strengthened very much by some subsequent experiments of Dr. Priestley’s (see p. 299 of <i>Morsels of Criticism, tending to illustrate some few passages in the Holy Scriptures upon Philosophical Principles</i>. 2d. edition, 2 vols. 8vo. London: J Davis, Chancery Lane, 1800).</p>  
 <p>The jewel of the Rossi-crucians (Rosicrucians) is formed of a transparent red stone, with a red <i>cross</i> on one side, and a red <i>rose</i> on the other--thus, it is a <i>crucified rose</i>. The Rossi--or Rosy--crucians' ideas concerning this emblematical red cross and red rose probably came from the fable of Adonis--who was the sun whom we have seen so often crucified--being changed into a red rose by Venus (see Drummond's <i>Origines</i>, vol. iii. p. 121). <i>Rus</i> (which is <i>Ras</i> in Chaldee) in Irish signifies 'tree', 'knowledge', 'science', magic', 'power'. This is the Hebrew <i>R--as</i>. Hence the Persian <i>Rustan</i> (<i>Val. Col. Hib.</i> vol. iv: pt. i. p. 84).

 <p>Buda, or Buddha. These were, I believe, old names restored' (<i>vide</i> D’Anville's <i>Atlas</i>). The society bearing the name of the Rosicrucians (or Rosicruxians) is closely allied with the Templars. Their emblem is a monogram or jewel; or, as malicious And bigoted adversaries would say, their 'object of adoration' is a 'red rose on a cross'. Thus:</p>

 <p>When it can be done, it is surrounded with a glory, and placed on a Calvary. This is the Naurutz, Natsir, or Rose of Isuren, of Tamul, or Sharon, or the Water-Rose, the Lily Padma, Pema, Lotus 'crucified' for the salvation of man--crucified in the heavens at the Vernal Equinox. It is celebrated at that time by the Persians in what they call their Nou-Rose, i.e. Neros, or Naurutz (Malcolm's <i>History of Persia</i>, vol. ii. p. 406). The Tudor Rose, or <i>Rose-en-Soleil</i> (the Rose of the Order of the Garter), is the Rosicrucian 'Red Rose', crucified, with its rays of glory, or golden sunbeams, or mythical thorns, <i>issuant</i> from its white, immaculate 'centre-point', or 'lily-point'--all which have further occult meanings lying hidden in theurgic mysticism. All these are spoken in the famous 'Round Table' of the Prince (and Origin) of Christian knighthood, King Arthur. His table is now hanging on the wall, dusty and neglected, over the. 'King’s Seat or Bench' in the Court-House on the Castle Hill of our ancient Winchester. But upon this abstruse subject of</p>

 <p>the Round Table we have spoken more fully in another place. See Elias Ashmole.</p>  
 <p>Pope John XIV, about the year 970, issued a Bull for the baptizing of bells 'To cleanse the air of devils'; with which it was imagined to be full in the time of storms or of public commotion. To this end, the kettledrums of the Lacedæmonians were also supposed to be used on all extraordinarily harmful occasions. Pagodas are uprights and obelisks, with the same meaning as other steeples, and their angles are set about with bells, which are agitated in the wind, and are supposed to exercise the same power of driving off evil spirits. Vesper bells secure spiritual serenity. The bells of the churches are tolled in thunderstorms still, in some parishes in England, supposedly to disperse the clouds, and to open their rifts for the returning sunshine.</p>  
 <p>Edward the First of England was in every way an extraordinary man. There are certain reasons for supposing that he was really initiated in Eastern occult ideas. It is to be remembered that he made the Crusade to Palestine. He invited to England, Guido dalla Colonna, the author of the Troy-book <i>Tale of Troy</i>; and he also invited Raymond Lully into his kingdom. Raymond Lully is affirmed to have supplied to Edward six millions of money, to enable him to carry on war against the Turks. The origin of the rose-nobles is from the Rosicrucians.</p>

The sections into which the Order of the Knights of Malta were divided were eight, answering to the eight points of the cross, which was their emblem. The Order was composed of eight nations, whereof the English, which was one, disappeared at the Reformation.</p>
