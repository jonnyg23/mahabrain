 <p align="center"><small><i>Precepts to His Disciples, Washes their Feet. Trouble of Mind and Prayer</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>NOW the first <i>day</i> of the <i>feast of</i> unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</p>  
 <p>2 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</p>  
 <p>3 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</p>  
 <p>4 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</p>  
 <p>5 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</p>  
 <p>6 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercised lordship over them; and they that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="green">p. 146</font></a></p>  
 <p>exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.</p>  
 <p>7 But ye <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i> so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that Both serve.</p>  
 <p>8 For whether <i>is</i> greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? <i>is</i> not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.</p>  
 <p>9 And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's <i>son</i>, to betray him;</p>  
 <p>10 He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</p>  
 <p>11 After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe <i>them</i> with the towel wherewith he was girded.</p>  
 <p>12 Then cometh he to Simon Peter; and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</p>  
 <p>13 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</p>  
 <p>14 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="green">p. 147</font></a></p>  
 <p>15 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also <i>my</i> hands and <i>my</i> head.</p>  
 <p>16 Jesus saith to Him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash <i>his</i> feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.</p>  
 <p>17 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.</p>  
 <p>18 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?</p>  
 <p>19 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for <i>so</i> I am.</p>  
 <p>20 If I then, <i>your</i> Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</p>  
 <p>21 For I have given you an example, that ye should do; as I have done to you.</p>  
 <p>22 Verily, verily, I shy unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</p>  
 <p>23 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</p>  
 <p>24 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="green">p. 148</font></a></p>  
 <p>25 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</p>  
 <p>26 Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus loved.</p>  
 <p>27 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.</p>  
 <p>28 He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?</p>  
 <p>29 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped <i>it</i>. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, <i>the son</i> of Simon.</p>  
 <p>30 ¶ Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</p>  
 <p>31 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</p>  
 <p>32 By this shall all <i>men</i> know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</p>  
 <p>33 Then said Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="green">p. 149</font></a></p>  
 <p>I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</p>  
 <p>34 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all <i>men</i> shall be offended because of thee, <i>yet</i> will I never be offended.</p>  
 <p>35 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.</p>  
 <p>36 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</p>  
 <p>37 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</p>  
 <p>38 ¶ Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and said unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</p>  
 <p>39 And he took with him Peter and the two. sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</p>  
 <p>40 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</p>  
 <p>41 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></a></p>  
 <p>let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou <i>wilt</i>.</p>  
 <p>42 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</p>  
 <p>43 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed <i>is</i> willing, but the flesh <i>is</i> weak.</p>  
 <p>44 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</p>  
 <p>45 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</p>  
 <p>46 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</p>  
 <p>47 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take <i>your</i> rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
