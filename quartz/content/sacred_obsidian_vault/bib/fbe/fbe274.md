 </i><p align="CENTER">Levi has visions and shows what rewards are in store for the righteous.</p> 
 <p>AND when I was going to my father, I found a brazen shield; wherefore also the name of the mountain is Aspis, which is near Gebal, to the south of Abila.</p> 
 <p>2 And I kept these words in my heart. And after this I counselled my father, and Reuben my brother, to bid the sons of Hamor not to be circumcised; for I was zealous because of the abomination which they had wrought on my sister.</p> 
 <p>3 And I slew Shechem first, and Simeon slew Hamor. And after this my brothers came and smote that city with the edge of the sword.</p> 
 <p>4 And my father heard these things and was wroth, and he was grieved in that they had received the circumcision, and after that had been put to death, and in his blessings he looked amiss upon us.</p> 
 <p>5 For we sinned because we had done this thing against his will, and he was sick on that day.</p> 
 <p>6 But I saw that the sentence of God was for evil upon Shechem; for they sought to do to Sarah and Rebecca as they had done to Dinah our sister, but the Lord prevented them.</p> 
 <p>7 And they persecuted Abraham our father when he was a stranger, and they vexed his flocks when they were big with young; and Eblaen, who was born in his house, they most shamefully handled.</p> 
 <p>8 And thus they did to all strangers, taking away their wives by force, and they banished them.</p> 
 <p>9 But the wrath of the Lord came upon them to the uttermost.</p> 
 <p><a name="page_229"><font size="1" color="green">p. 229</font></a></p> 
 <p>10 And I said to my father Jacob: By thee will the Lord despoil the Canaanites, and will give their land to thee and to thy seed after thee.</p> 
 <p>11 For from this day forward shall Shechem be called a city of imbeciles; for as a man mocketh a fool, so did we mock them.</p> 
 <p>12 Because also they had wrought folly in Israel by defiling my sister. And we departed and came to Bethel.</p> 
 <p>13 And there again I saw a vision as the former, after we had spent there seventy days.</p> 
 <p>14 And I saw seven men in white raiment saying unto me: Arise, put on the robe of the priesthood, and the crown of righteousness, and the breastplate of understanding, and the garment of truth, and the late of faith, and the turban of the head, and the ephod of prophecy.</p> 
 <p>15 And they severally carried these things and put them on me, and said unto me: From henceforth become a priest of the Lord, thou and thy seed for ever.</p> 
 <p>16 And the first anointed me with holy oil, and gave to me the staff of judgement.</p> 
 <p>17 The second washed me with pure. water, and fed me with bread and wine even the most holy things, and clad me with a holy and glorious robe.</p> 
 <p>18 The third clothed me with a linen vestment like an ephod.</p> 
 <p>19 The fourth put round me a girdle like unto purple.</p> 
 <p>20 The fifth gave me a branch of rich olive.</p> 
 <p>21 The sixth placed a crown on my head.</p> 
 <p>22 The seventh placed on my head a diadem of priesthood, and filled my hands with incense, that I might serve as priest to the Lord God.</p> 
 <p>23 And they said to me: Levi, thy seed shall be divided into three offices, for a sign of the glory of the Lord who is to come.</p> 
 <p>24 And the first portion shall be great; yea, greater than it shall none be.</p> 
 <p>25 The second shall be in the priesthood.</p> 
 <p>26 And the third shall be called by a new name, because a king shall arise in Judah, and shall establish a new priesthood, after the fashion of the Gentiles.</p> 
 <p>27 And His presence is beloved, as a prophet of the Most High, of the seed of Abraham our father.</p> 
 <p>28 Therefore, every desirable thing in Israel shall be for thee and for thy seed, and ye shall eat everything fair to look upon, and the table of the Lord shall thy seed apportion.</p> 
 <p>29 And some of them shall be high priests, and judges, and scribes; for by their mouth shall the holy place be guarded.</p> 
 <p>30 And when I awoke, I understood that this dream was like the first dream. And I hid this also in my heart, and told it not to any man upon the earth.</p> 
 <p>31 And after two days I and Judah went up with our father Jacob to Isaac our father's father.</p> 
 <p>32 And my father's father blessed me according to all the words of the visions which I had seen. And he would not come with us to Bethel.</p> 
 <p>33 And when we came to Bethel, my father saw a vision concerning me, that I should be their priest unto God.</p> 
 <p>34 And he rose up early in the morning, and paid tithes of all to the Lord through me. And so we came to Hebron to dwell there.</p> 
 <p>35 And Isaac called me continually to put me in remembrance of the law of the Lord, even as the angel of the Lord showed unto me.</p> 
 <p>36 And he taught me the law of the priesthood of sacrifices,</p> 
 <p><a name="page_230"><font size="1" color="green">p. 230</font></a></p> 
 <p>whole burnt-offerings, first-fruits, freewill-offerings, peace-offerings.</p> 
 <p>37 And each day he was instructing me, and was busied on my behalf before the Lord, and said to me: Beware of the spirit of fornication; for this shall continue and shall by thy seed pollute the holy place.</p> 
 <p>38 Take, therefore, to thyself a wife without blemish or pollution, while yet thou are young, and not of the race of strange nations.</p> 
 <p>39 And before entering into the holy place, bathe; and when thou offerest the sacrifice, wash; and again, when thou finishest the sacrifice, wash.</p> 
 <p>40 Of twelve trees having leaves offer to the Lord, as Abraham taught me also.</p> 
 <p>41 And of every clean beast and bird offer a sacrifice to the Lord.</p> 
 <p>42 And of all thy first-fruits and of wine offer the first, as a sacrifice to the Lord God; and every sacrifice thou shalt salt with salt.</p> 
 <p>43 Now, therefore, observe whatsoever I command you, children; for whatsoever things I have heard from my fathers I have declared unto you.</p> 
 <p>44 And behold I am clear from your ungodliness and transgression, which ye shall commit in the end of the ages against the Saviour of the world, Christ, acting godlessly, deceiving Israel, and stirring up against it great evils from the Lord.</p> 
 <p>45 And ye shall deal lawlessly together with Israel, so He shall not bear with Jerusalem because of your wickedness; but the veil of the temple shall be rent, so as not to cover your shame.</p> 
 <p>46 And ye shall be scattered as captives among the Gentiles, and shall be for a reproach and for a curse there.</p> 
 <p>47 For the house which the Lord shall choose shall be called Jerusalem, as is contained in the book of Enoch the righteous.</p> 
 <p>48 Therefore when I took a wife I was twenty-eight years old, and her name was Melcha.</p> 
 <p>49 And she conceived and bare a son, and I called his name Gersam, for we were sojourners in our land.</p> 
 <p>50 And I saw concerning him, that he would not be in the first rank.</p> 
 <p>51 And Kohath was born in the thirty-fifth year of my life, towards sunrise.</p> 
 <p>52 And I saw in a vision that he was standing on high in the midst of all the congregation.</p> 
 <p>53 Therefore I called his name Kohath which is, beginning of majesty and instruction.</p> 
 <p>54 And she bare me a third son, in the fortieth year of my life; and since his mother bare him with difficulty, I called him Merari, that is, 'my bitterness,' because he also was like to die.</p> 
 <p>55 And Jochebed was born. in Egypt, in my sixty-fourth year, for I was renowned then in the midst of my brethren.</p> 
 <p>56 And Gersam took a wife, and she bare to him Lomni and Semei. And the sons of Kohath, Ambram, Issachar, Hebron, and Ozeel. And the sons of Merari, Mooli, and Mouses.</p> 
 <p>57 And in the ninety-fourth year Ambram took Jochebed my daughter to him to wife, for they were born in one day, he and my daughter.</p> 
 <p>58 Eight years old was I when I went into the land of Canaan, and eighteen years when I slew Shechem, and at nineteen years I became priest, and at twenty-eight years I took a wife, and at forty-eight I went into Egypt.</p> 
 <p>59 And behold, my children, ye are a third generation. In my hundred and eighteenth year Joseph died.</p>
