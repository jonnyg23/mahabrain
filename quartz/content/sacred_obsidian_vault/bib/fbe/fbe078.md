 <p>THEN God looked upon the words of Adam that they were true, and that he could long await His order, respecting the counsel of Satan.</p> 
 <p>2 And God approved Adam in what he had thought concerning this, and in the prayer he had offered in His presence; and the Word of God came unto Adam and said to him, "O Adam, if only thou hadst had this caution at first, ere thou earnest out of the garden into this land!"</p>

 <p>7 Then both Adam and Eve received the words of the angels; and the angels departed from them.</p> 
 <p>8 Then Adam and Eve began to fast and to pray, until the end of the forty days; and then they came together, as the angels had told them. And from the time Adam left the garden until he wedded Eve, were two hundred and twenty-three days, that is seven months and thirteen days.</p> 
 <p>9 Thus was Satan's war with Adam defeated.</p>
