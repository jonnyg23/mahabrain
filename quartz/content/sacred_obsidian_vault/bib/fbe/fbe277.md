 </i><p align="CENTER">The Fourth Son of Jacob and Leah.</p> <h3 align="CENTER">CHAP. I.</h3> <i>
 </i><p align="CENTER">Judah, the fourth son of Jacob and Leah. He is the giant, athlete, warrior; he recounts heroic deeds. He runs so fast that he can outstrip a hind.</p> 
 <p>THE copy of the words of Judah, what things he spake to his sons before he died.</p> 
 <p>2 They gathered themselves together, therefore, and came to him, and he said to them: Hearken, my children, to Judah your father.</p> 
 <p>3 I was the fourth son born to my father Jacob; and Leah my mother named me Judah, saying, I give thanks to the Lord,</p> 
 <p><a name="page_234"><font size="1" color="green">p. 234</font></a></p> 
 <p>because He hath given me a fourth son also.</p> 
 <p>4 I was swift in my youth, and obedient to my father in everything.</p> 
 <p>5 And I honoured my mother and my mother's sister.</p> 
 <p>6 And it came to pass, when I became a man, that my father blessed me, saying, Thou shalt be a king, prospering in all things.</p> 
 <p>7 And the Lord showed me favour in all my works both in the field and in the house.</p> 
 <p>8 I know that I raced a hind, and caught it, and prepared the meat for my father, and he did eat.</p> 
 <p>9 And the roes I used to master in the chase, and overtake all that was in the plains.</p> 
 <p>10 A wild mare I overtook, and caught it and tamed it.</p> 
 <p>11 I slew a lion and plucked a kid out of its mouth.</p> 
 <p>12 I took a bear by its paw and hurled it down the cliff, and it was crushed.</p> 
 <p>13 I outran the wild boar, and seizing it as I ran, I tore it in sunder.</p> 
 <p>14 A leopard in Hebron leaped upon my dog, and I caught it by the tail, and hurled it on the rocks, and it was broken in twain</p> 
 <p>15 I found a wild ox feeding in the fields, and seizing it by the horns, and whirling it round and stunning it, I cast it from me and slew it.</p> 
 <p>16 And when the two kings of the Canaanites came sheathed, in armour against our flocks, and much people with them, single handed I rushed upon the king of Hazor, and smote him on the greives and dragged him down, and so I slew him.</p> 
 <p>17 And the other, the king of Tappuah, as he sat upon his horse, I slew, and so I scattered all his people.</p> 
 <p>18 Achor, the king, a man of giant stature, I found, hurling javelins before and behind as he sat on horseback, and I took up a stone of sixty pounds weight, and hurled it and smote his horse, and killed it.</p> 
 <p>19 And I fought with this other for two hours; and I clave his shield in twain, and I chopped off his feet, and killed him.</p> 
 <p>20 And as I was stripping off his breastplate, behold nine men his companions began to fight with me,</p> 
 <p>21 And I wound my garment on my hand; and I slung stones at them, and killed four of them, and the rest fled.</p> 
 <p>22 And Jacob my father slew Beelesath, king of all the kings, a giant in strength, twelve cubits high.</p> 
 <p>23 And fear fell upon them, and they ceased warring against us.</p> 
 <p>24 Therefore my father was free from anxiety in the wars when I was with my brethren.</p> 
 <p>25 For he saw in a vision concerning me that an angel of might followed me everywhere, that I should not be overcome.</p> 
 <p>26 And in the south there came upon us a greater war than that in Shechem; and I joined in battle array with my brethren, and pursued a thousand men, and slew of them two hundred men and four kings.</p> 
 <p>27 And I went up upon the wall, and I slew four mighty men.</p> 
 <p>28 And so we captured Hazor, and took all the spoil.</p> 
 <p>29 And the next day we departed to Aretan, a city strong and walled and inaccessible, threatening us with death.</p> 
 <p>30 But I and Gad approached on the east side of the city, and Reuben and Levi on the west.</p> 
 <p>31 And they that were upon the wall, thinking that we were alone, were drawn down against us.</p> 
 <p>32 And so my brothers secretly climbed up the wall on</p> 
 <p><a name="page_235"><font size="1" color="green">p. 235</font></a></p> 
 <p>both sides by stakes, and entered the city, while the men knew it not.</p> 
 <p>33 And we took it with the edge of the sword.</p> 
 <p>34 And as for those who had taken refuge in the tower, we set fire to the tower and took both it and, them.</p> 
 <p>35 And as we were departing the men of Tappuah seized our spoil, and seeing this we fought with them.</p> 
 <p>36 And we slew them. all and recovered our spoil.</p> 
 <p>37 And when I was at the waters of Kozeba, the men of Jobel came against us to battle.</p> 
 <p>38 And we fought with them and routed them; and their allies from Shiloh we slew, and we did not leave them power to come in against us.</p> 
 <p>39 And the men of Makir came upon us the fifth day, to seize our spoil; and we attacked them and overcame them in fierce battle: for there was a host of mighty men amongst them, and we slew them before they had gone up the ascent.</p> 
 <p>40 And when we came to their city their women rolled upon us stones from the brow of the hill on which the city stood.</p> 
 <p>41 And I and Simeon had ourselves behind the town, and seized upon the heights, and destroyed this city also.</p> 
 <p>42 And the next day it was told us that the king of the city of Gaash with. a mighty host was coming against us.</p> 
 <p>43 I, therefore, and Dan feigned ourselves to be Amorites, and as allies went into their city.</p> 
 <p>44 And in the depth of night our brethren came and we opened to them the gates; and we destroyed all the men and their substance, and we took for a prey all that was theirs, and their three walls we cast down.</p> 
 <p>45 And we drew near to Thamna, where was all the substance of the hostile kings.</p> 
 <p>46 Then being insulted by them, I was therefore wroth, and rushed against them to the summit; and they kept slinging against me stones and darts.</p> 
 <p>47 And had not Dan my brother aided me, they would have slain me.</p> 
 <p>48 We came upon them, therefore, with wrath, and they all fled; and passing by another way, they fought my father, and he made peace with them.</p> 
 <p>49 And we did to them no hurt, and they became tributary to us, and we restored to them their spoil.</p> 
 <p>50 And I built Thamna, and my father built Pabael.</p> 
 <p>51 I was twenty years old when this war befell. And the Canaanites feared me and my brethren.</p> 
 <p>52 And I had much cattle, and I had for chief herdsman Iram the Adullamite.</p> 
 <p>53 And when I went to him I saw Parsaba, king of Adullam; and he spake unto us, and he made us a feast; and when I was heated he gave me his daughter Bathshua to wife.</p> 
 <p>54 She bare me Er, and Onan and Shelah; and two of them the Lord smote: for Shelah lived, and his children are ye.</p>
