  <h3 align="center">American Standard Version: 2 Timothy</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> That good thing which was committed unto [thee] guard through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> (the Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Suffer hardship with [me], as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of [this] life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowded, except he have contended lawfully.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> The husbandmen that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Of these things put them in remembrance, charging [them] in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: or whom is Hymenaeus an Philetus;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master's use, prepared unto every good work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> after righteousness, faith, love, pace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> And the Lord's servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power therefore. From these also turn away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> But they shall proceed no further. For their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> persecutions, sufferings. What things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Every scripture inspired of God [is] also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> That the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> I charge [thee] in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> Give diligence to come shortly unto me:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might me fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom [be] the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> Give diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. </p>
