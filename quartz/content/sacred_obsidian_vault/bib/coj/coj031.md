The children of Tisai were, Maqôl, Luon, Ṣilagtaba; the children of Dodanim, Iteb, Bēath, and Faneg. And of these the inhabitants of the land of Persia, Media, and those of the isles of the sea were divided. (3) And Faneg, son of Dodanim, was the first to ride the ships of the sea. At that time a third part of the land of Romidath was flooded. And his sons subdued Yedid; and the sons of Magog subdued Dēgel, and the sons of Madai subdued Biṭṭo; the sons of Yavan, Ṣēel; the sons of Tubal, Paḥath; the sons of Meshek, Nephṭī; the sons of Tiras, Rôô; the sons of Dinim, Gudah.

Then did men begin to till the ground, and when the land was parched, they cried to God, and He caused a fructifying rain to descend. And it came to pass, when the rain descended, the bow was seen in the clouds. When the inhabitants perceived the sign of the covenant, they blessed the Lord. (4) The children of Ham were Cush, Misraim, Put, and Canaan; and these are the children of Cush, Sheba, Tudan, Vabni (?), Māipôn, Tinôs, Siliô, Ṭiluf, Gilug, Lipukh. The children of Canaan were Ṣidon, Andaïm, Reṣin, Simim, Ôrôin, Nimigim, Ḥamatim, Nipim, Ṭilas, Ilag, and Cushim. Cush begat Nimrod, who was the first giant in pride before God. Misraim begat Ludim, ‘Anamim, Lehabim, Naftuḥim, Pathrosim, Kasluḥim, and Kaftorim. These began to build the following cities: Sidon and its villages, Risôn, Kiūza, Mazāger, Ashqalon, Debir, Qamo, Tilôn, Lakhish, Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Ṣebôim. (5) The children of Shem were Elam, Ashur, Arpakhshad, Lud, and Aran. The sons of Ashur were Gezrôn, Ishai; and Arpakhshad begat Shelaḥ, and Shelaḥ begat ‘Eber.

 <p>days the earth was divided, and the name of his brother, Yoqtan, who begat Almodad, Shalaphtra, Muzam, Riadura, ‘Uzim, Diqalbel, Mimôel, Shabethfin, Havilah, Yobab. And the children of Peleg were Re‘u, Rifud, Shafra, Aqôlôn, Zakar, Zifd, Gebi, Shuri, Shzēūr, Palabus, Rafa, Palṭia, Shafdifal, Shayish, Harṭman, Elifaz. These are the children of Peleg, and these are their names. They took to them wives of the daughters of Yoqtan, by whom were born sons and daughters, so that the whole earth was filled with them. (6) And Re‘u took to him Malkah, the daughter of Ruth, to wife, and begat Serug. When the days of her pregnancy were drawing to an end, Re‘u said, 'From this one will issue a child, in the fourth generation, whose throne will be established on high; he will be called a perfect righteous man, the father of a multitude of nations. His testimonies will not be forsaken, and his seed shall fill the world.' And Re‘u begat after Serug seven sons, Abiel, Obed, Shalma, Dedazal, Qīniza, ‘Akur, Nefesh, and five daughters, Qadima, Derifa, Sheifa, Firiṭa, and Tehilah. (7) After Naḥor, Serug begat four sons, Ṣillah, Diga, Sôba, and Pôra, and three daughters, Gizla, Hôglah, and Shelifa. And after Teraḥ, Naḥor begat six sons, viz., Rekab, Deriab, Berikhab, Shibalshaf, Nidab, and Qemuel, and eight (?) daughters, Yiskah, Tipa, Berona, Qaniṭa. He took to wife Amtalai, the daughter of Karnabo. (8) And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Naḥor, and Haran, and Haran begat Loṭ. (9) Then the inhabitants of the land began to prognosticate by the planets and to become astrologers and to practise divination. They also passed their sons and daughters through fire, but Serug and his sons did not walk in their ways.</p>
