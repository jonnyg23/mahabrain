  <h3 align="center">World English Bible: Exodus</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> All the souls who came out of Jacob's body were seventy souls, and Joseph was in Egypt already.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn't know Joseph.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> He said to his people, "Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and escape out of the land."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They were grieved because of the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all kinds of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> and he said, "When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool; if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> But the midwives feared God, and didn't do what the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, "Why have you done this thing, and have saved the boys alive?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women aren't like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and give birth before the midwife comes to them."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> It happened, because the midwives feared God, that he gave them families.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> The woman conceived, and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river's bank.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Pharaoh's daughter came down to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket among the reeds, and sent her handmaid to get it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on him, and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go." The maiden went and called the child's mother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages." The woman took the child, and nursed it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, and said, "Because I drew him out of the water."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> It happened in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brothers, and looked at their burdens. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. He said to him who did the wrong, "Why do you strike your fellow?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> He said, "Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?" Moses was afraid, and said, "Surely this thing is known."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, "How is it that you have returned so early today?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> They said, "An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> He said to his daughters, "Where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> Moses was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> She bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, "I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> It happened in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> God saw the children of Israel, and God was concerned about them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to God's mountain, to Horeb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> The angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> Moses said, "I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> When Yahweh saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, "Moses! Moses!" He said, "Here I am."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> He said, "Don't come close. Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place you are standing on is holy ground."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> Moreover he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Yahweh said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> He said, "Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Moses said to God, "Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you;' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' What should I tell them?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM," and he said, "You shall tell the children of Israel this: 'I AM has sent me to you.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> God said moreover to Moses, "You shall tell the children of Israel this, 'Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and tell them, 'Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, "I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey."'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> They will listen to your voice, and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall tell him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh, our God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> I know that the king of Egypt won't give you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> I will put forth my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst, and after that he will let you go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and it will happen that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters. You shall plunder the Egyptians."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> Moses answered, "But, behold, they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice; for they will say, 'Yahweh has not appeared to you.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> Yahweh said to him, "What is that in your hand?" He said, "A rod."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> He said, "Throw it on the ground." He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses ran away from it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Put forth your hand, and take it by the tail." He put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> "That they may believe that Yahweh, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> Yahweh said furthermore to him, "Now put your hand inside your cloak." He put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> He said, "Put your hand inside your cloak again." He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out of his cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> "It will happen, if they will neither believe you nor listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> It will happen, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither listen to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> Moses said to Yahweh, "O Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before now, nor since you have spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> Yahweh said to him, "Who made man's mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Isn't it I, Yahweh?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> He said, "Oh, Lord, please send someone else."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Moses, and he said, "What about Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Also, behold, he comes forth to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> You shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> He will be your spokesman to the people; and it will happen, that he will be to you a mouth, and you will be to him as God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> You shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, "Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive." Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, "Go, return into Egypt; for all the men who sought your life are dead."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took God's rod in his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "When you go back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> You shall tell Pharaoh, 'Thus says Yahweh, Israel is my son, my firstborn,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> and I have said to you, "Let my son go, that he may serve me;" and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> It happened on the way at a lodging place, that Yahweh met Moses and wanted to kill him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> So he let him alone. Then she said, "You are a bridegroom of blood," because of the circumcision.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> Yahweh said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses." He went, and met him on God's mountain, and kissed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:28">4:28</a> Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had instructed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:29">4:29</a> Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:30">4:30</a> Aaron spoke all the words which Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:31">4:31</a> The people believed, and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, "This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, 'Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> Pharaoh said, "Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don't know Yahweh, and moreover I will not let Israel go."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> They said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh, our God, lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> The king of Egypt said to them, "Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> "You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> The number of the bricks, which they made before, you require from them. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor therein; and don't let them pay any attention to lying words."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> The taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, "This is what Pharaoh says: 'I will not give you straw.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> The taskmasters were urgent saying, "Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, "Why haven't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, 'Make brick!' and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> But he said, "You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> Go therefore now, and work, for no straw shall be given to you, yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble, when it was said, "You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> They met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> and they said to them, "May Yahweh look at you, and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, "Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people; neither have you delivered your people at all."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> God spoke to Moses, and said to him, "I am Yahweh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived as aliens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> Therefore tell the children of Israel, 'I am Yahweh, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am Yahweh.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they didn't listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> "Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, "Behold, the children of Israel haven't listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, who am of uncircumcised lips?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a command to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> These are the heads of their fathers' houses. The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.</p>

 <p><a name="an_6:28">6:28</a> It happened on the day when Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:29">6:29</a> that Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "I am Yahweh. Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:30">6:30</a> Moses said before Yahweh, "Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh listen to me?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Behold, I have made you as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> You shall speak all that I command you; and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh, when I stretch forth my hand on Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> Moses and Aaron did so. As Yahweh commanded them, so they did.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> "When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Perform a miracle!' then you shall tell Aaron, 'Take your rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, as Yahweh had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers. They also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same thing with their enchantments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> For they each cast down their rods, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is stubborn. He refuses to let the people go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Behold, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river's bank to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> You shall tell him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, "Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness:" and behold, until now you haven't listened.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> Thus says Yahweh, "In this you shall know that I am Yahweh. Behold, I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your rod, and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> Moses and Aaron did so, as Yahweh commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and struck the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> The fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians couldn't drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> The magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchantments; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> All the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink; for they couldn't drink of the water of the river.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> Seven days were fulfilled, after Yahweh had struck the river.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, "This is what Yahweh says, 'Let my people go, that they may serve me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> If you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your borders with frogs:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedroom, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> and the frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch forth your hand with your rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> The magicians did the same thing with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, "Entreat Yahweh, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Yahweh."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> Moses said to Pharaoh, "I give you the honor of setting the time that I should pray for you, and for your servants, and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, and remain in the river only."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> He said, "Tomorrow." He said, "Be it according to your word, that you may know that there is none like Yahweh our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> The frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to Yahweh concerning the frogs which he had brought on Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and didn't listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice on man, and on animal; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> The magicians tried with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they couldn't. There were lice on man, and on animal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God:" and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; behold, he comes forth to the water; and tell him, 'This is what Yahweh says, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am Yahweh in the midst of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:23">8:23</a> I will put a division between my people and your people: by tomorrow shall this sign be."'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:24">8:24</a> Yahweh did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:25">8:25</a> Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God in the land!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:26">8:26</a> Moses said, "It isn't appropriate to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Yahweh our God. Behold, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and won't they stone us?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:27">8:27</a> We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh our God, as he shall command us."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:28">8:28</a> Pharaoh said, "I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the wilderness, only you shall not go very far away. Pray for me."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:29">8:29</a> Moses said, "Behold, I go out from you, and I will pray to Yahweh that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only don't let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Yahweh."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:30">8:30</a> Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:31">8:31</a> Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. There remained not one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:32">8:32</a> Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he didn't let the people go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, 'This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, that they may serve me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> For if you refuse to let them go, and hold them still,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> behold, the hand of Yahweh is on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel."'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> Yahweh appointed a set time, saying, "Tomorrow Yahweh shall do this thing in the land."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> Yahweh did that thing on the next day; and all the livestock of Egypt died, but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not one died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he didn't let the people go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, "Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with boils on man and on animal, throughout all the land of Egypt."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky; and it became a boil breaking forth with boils on man and on animal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> The magicians couldn't stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he didn't listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, 'This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, that they may serve me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart, against your officials, and against your people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> For now I would have put forth my hand, and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> but indeed for this cause I have made you stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> as you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won't let them go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> Now therefore command that all of your livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter. Every man and animal that is found in the field, and isn't brought home, the hail shall come down on them, and they shall die."'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> Those who feared the word of Yahweh among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> Whoever didn't respect the word of Yahweh left his servants and his livestock in the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch forth your hand toward the sky, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man, and on animal, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> Moses stretched forth his rod toward the heavens, and Yahweh sent thunder, hail, and lightning flashed down to the earth. Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> So there was very severe hail, and lightning mixed with the hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and animal; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "I have sinned this time. Yahweh is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:28">9:28</a> Pray to Yahweh; for there has been enough of mighty thunderings and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:29">9:29</a> Moses said to him, "As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to Yahweh. The thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that you may know that the earth is Yahweh's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:30">9:30</a> But as for you and your servants, I know that you don't yet fear Yahweh God."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:31">9:31</a> The flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:32">9:32</a> But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they had not grown up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:33">9:33</a> Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to Yahweh; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:34">9:34</a> When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:35">9:35</a> The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he didn't let the children of Israel go, just as Yahweh had spoken through Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your son's son, what things I have done to Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know that I am Yahweh."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, "This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> Or else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> and they shall cover the surface of the earth, so that one won't be able to see the earth. They shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.'" He turned, and went out from Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve Yahweh, their God. Don't you yet know that Egypt is destroyed?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, "Go, serve Yahweh your God; but who are those who will go?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> Moses said, "We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> He said to them, "Yahweh be with you if I will let you go with your little ones! See, evil is clearly before your faces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> Not so! Go now you who are men, and serve Yahweh; for that is what you desire!" They were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. They were very grievous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> For they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, "I have sinned against Yahweh your God, and against you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> Now therefore please forgive my sin again, and pray to Yahweh your God, that he may also take away from me this death."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> He went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> Yahweh turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't let the children of Israel go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> Moses stretched forth his hand toward the sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> They didn't see one another, neither did anyone rise from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, "Go, serve Yahweh. Only let your flocks and your herds stay behind. Let your little ones also go with you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> Moses said, "You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:26">10:26</a> Our livestock also shall go with us. Not a hoof shall be left behind, for of it we must take to serve Yahweh our God; and we don't know with what we must serve Yahweh, until we come there."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:27">10:27</a> But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he wouldn't let them go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:28">10:28</a> Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me! Be careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:29">10:29</a> Moses said, "You have spoken well. I will see your face again no more."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Yet one plague more will I bring on Pharaoh, and on Egypt; afterwards he will let you go. When he lets you go, he will surely thrust you out altogether.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> Moses said, "This is what Yahweh says: 'About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of livestock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor shall be any more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> But against any of the children of Israel a dog won't even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal; that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> All these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, "Get out, with all the people who follow you;" and after that I will go out.'" He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Pharaoh won't listen to you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't let the children of Israel go out of his land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> "This month shall be to you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth day of this month, they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> and if the household is too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls; according to what everyone can eat you shall make your count for the lamb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old. You shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> They shall take some of the blood, and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel, on the houses in which they shall eat it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> They shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and unleavened bread. They shall eat it with bitter herbs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> Don't eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; with its head, its legs and its inner parts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> This is how you shall eat it: with your belt on your waist, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is Yahweh's Passover.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and animal. Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> The blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be on you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> This day shall be to you for a memorial, and you shall keep it a feast to Yahweh: throughout your generations you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> "'Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> In the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no kind of work shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:18">12:18</a> In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty first day of the month at evening.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:19">12:19</a> Seven days shall there be no yeast found in your houses, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a foreigner, or one who is born in the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:20">12:20</a> You shall eat nothing leavened. In all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:21">12:21</a> Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, "Draw out, and take lambs according to your families, and kill the Passover.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:22">12:22</a> You shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:23">12:23</a> For Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two doorposts, Yahweh will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:24">12:24</a> You shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:25">12:25</a> It shall happen when you have come to the land which Yahweh will give you, according as he has promised, that you shall keep this service.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:26">12:26</a> It will happen, when your children ask you, 'What do you mean by this service?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:27">12:27</a> that you shall say, 'It is the sacrifice of Yahweh's Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians, and spared our houses.'" The people bowed their heads and worshiped.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:28">12:28</a> The children of Israel went and did so; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:29">12:29</a> It happened at midnight, that Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of livestock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:30">12:30</a> Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:31">12:31</a> He called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, "Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve Yahweh, as you have said!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:32">12:32</a> Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:33">12:33</a> The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, "We are all dead men."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:34">12:34</a> The people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:35">12:35</a> The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:36">12:36</a> Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. They despoiled the Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:37">12:37</a> The children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:38">12:38</a> A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much livestock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:39">12:39</a> They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it wasn't leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn't wait, neither had they prepared for themselves any food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:40">12:40</a> Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:41">12:41</a> It happened at the end of four hundred thirty years, even the same day it happened, that all the armies of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:42">12:42</a> It is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of Yahweh, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:43">12:43</a> Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the ordinance of the Passover. No foreigner shall eat of it,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:44">12:44</a> but every man's servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:45">12:45</a> A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:46">12:46</a> In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth anything of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall you break a bone of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:47">12:47</a> All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:48">12:48</a> When a stranger shall live as a foreigner with you, and will keep the Passover to Yahweh, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one who is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:49">12:49</a> One law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:50">12:50</a> All the children of Israel did so. As Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:51">12:51</a> It happened the same day, that Yahweh brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> "Sanctify to me all of the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of animal. It is mine."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> Moses said to the people, "Remember this day, in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> This day you go forth in the month Abib.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you, neither shall there be yeast seen with you, in all your borders.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> You shall tell your son in that day, saying, 'It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> It shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> "It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and shall give it you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb, and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal. The males shall be Yahweh's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> It shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What is this?' that you shall tell him, 'By strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> and it happened, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that Yahweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of animal. Therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all that opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between your eyes: for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us forth out of Egypt."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> It happened, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God didn't lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, "Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt;"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the children of Israel swear, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> They took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them on their way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, didn't depart from before the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> "Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon. You shall encamp opposite it by the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, 'They are entangled in the land. The wilderness has shut them in.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will follow after them; and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh." They did so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> It was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, "What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> He prepared his chariot, and took his army with him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> The Egyptians pursued after them: all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army; and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> When Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were very afraid. The children of Israel cried out to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> They said to Moses, "Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us forth out of Egypt?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> Isn't this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?' For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh, which he will work for you today: for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall never see them again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> Yahweh will fight for you, and you shall be still."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Why do you cry to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them: and I will get myself honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies, over his chariots, and over his horsemen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh, over his chariots, and over his horsemen."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one didn't come near the other all the night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:22">14:22</a> The children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:23">14:23</a> The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea: all of Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:24">14:24</a> It happened in the morning watch, that Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and confused the Egyptian army.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:25">14:25</a> He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, "Let's flee from the face of Israel, for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:26">14:26</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:27">14:27</a> Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it. Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:28">14:28</a> The waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh's army that went in after them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:29">14:29</a> But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:30">14:30</a> Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:31">14:31</a> Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did to the Egyptians, and the people feared Yahweh; and they believed in Yahweh, and in his servant Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh, and said, "I will sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> Yah is my strength and song. He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise him; my father's God, and I will exalt him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> Yahweh is a man of war. Yahweh is his name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> He has cast Pharaoh's chariots and his army into the sea. His chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> The deeps cover them. They went down into the depths like a stone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power. Your right hand, Yahweh, dashes the enemy in pieces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you. You send forth your wrath. It consumes them as stubble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up. The floods stood upright as a heap. The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:9">15:9</a> The enemy said, 'I will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide the spoil. My desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:10">15:10</a> You blew with your wind. The sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:11">15:11</a> Who is like you, Yahweh, among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:12">15:12</a> You stretched out your right hand. The earth swallowed them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:13">15:13</a> "You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you have redeemed. You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:14">15:14</a> The peoples have heard. They tremble. Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:15">15:15</a> Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed. Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab. All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:16">15:16</a> Terror and dread falls on them. By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone-- until your people pass over, Yahweh, until the people pass over who you have purchased.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:17">15:17</a> You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, the place, Yahweh, which you have made for yourself to dwell in; the sanctuary, Lord, which your hands have established.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:18">15:18</a> Yahweh shall reign forever and ever."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:19">15:19</a> For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:20">15:20</a> Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:21">15:21</a> Miriam answered them, "Sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:22">15:22</a> Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:23">15:23</a> When they came to Marah, they couldn't drink from the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore its name was called Marah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:24">15:24</a> The people murmured against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:25">15:25</a> Then he cried to Yahweh. Yahweh showed him a tree, and he threw it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there he tested them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:26">15:26</a> and he said, "If you will diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will pay attention to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you, which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh who heals you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:27">15:27</a> They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> They took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> The whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> and the children of Israel said to them, "We wish that we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots, when we ate our fill of bread, for you have brought us out into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from the sky for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> It shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, "At evening, then you shall know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> and in the morning, then you shall see the glory of Yahweh; because he hears your murmurings against Yahweh. Who are we, that you murmur against us?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> Moses said, "Now Yahweh shall give you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to satisfy you; because Yahweh hears your murmurings which you murmur against him. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Yahweh."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> Moses said to Aaron, "Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, 'Come near before Yahweh, for he has heard your murmurings.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> It happened, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> "I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, 'At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread: and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> It happened at evening that quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> When the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, "What is it?" For they didn't know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded: "Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, you shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> The children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They gathered every man according to his eating.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> Moses said to them, "Let no one leave of it until the morning."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:20">16:20</a> Notwithstanding they didn't listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was angry with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:21">16:21</a> They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:22">16:22</a> It happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one, and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:23">16:23</a> He said to them, "This is that which Yahweh has spoken, 'Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:24">16:24</a> They laid it up until the morning, as Moses asked, and it didn't become foul, neither was there any worm in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:25">16:25</a> Moses said, "Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh. Today you shall not find it in the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:26">16:26</a> Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:27">16:27</a> It happened on the seventh day, that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:28">16:28</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:29">16:29</a> Behold, because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:30">16:30</a> So the people rested on the seventh day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:31">16:31</a> The house of Israel called its name Manna, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:32">16:32</a> Moses said, "This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, 'Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:33">16:33</a> Moses said to Aaron, "Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before Yahweh, to be kept throughout your generations."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:34">16:34</a> As Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:35">16:35</a> The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:36">16:36</a> Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to Yahweh's commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:2">17:2</a> Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, "Give us water to drink." Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> The people were thirsty for water there; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, "What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel with you, and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink." Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> He called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because the children of Israel quarreled, and because they tested Yahweh, saying, "Is Yahweh among us, or not?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> Moses said to Joshua, "Choose men for us, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God's rod in my hand."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> So Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> It happened, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> Moses built an altar, and called its name Yahweh our Banner.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:16">17:16</a> He said, "Yah has sworn: 'Yahweh will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> and her two sons. The name of one son was Gershom, for Moses said, "I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land".</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> The name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, "My father's God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh's sword."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the Mountain of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> He said to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come to you with your wife, and her two sons with her."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him. They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> Moses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardships that had come on them on the way, and how Yahweh delivered them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> Jethro said, "Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods because of the thing in which they dealt arrogantly against them."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> It happened on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, "What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> Moses' father-in-law said to him, "The thing that you do is not good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before God, and bring the causes to God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> Let them judge the people at all times. It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all of these people also will go to their place in peace."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:24">18:24</a> So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:25">18:25</a> Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:26">18:26</a> They judged the people at all times. They brought the hard causes to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:27">18:27</a> Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> In the third month after the children of Israel had gone forth out of the land of Egypt, on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> Moses went up to God, and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain, saying, "This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> 'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice, and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.' These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Yahweh commanded him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> All the people answered together, and said, "All that Yahweh has spoken we will do." Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever." Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> and be ready against the third day; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> You shall set bounds to the people all around, saying, 'Be careful that you don't go up onto the mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.' When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> He said to the people, "Be ready by the third day. Don't have sexual relations with a woman."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:16">19:16</a> It happened on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:17">19:17</a> Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:18">19:18</a> Mount Sinai, all it, smoked, because Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:19">19:19</a> When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:20">19:20</a> Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:21">19:21</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them perish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:22">19:22</a> Let the priests also, who come near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves, lest Yahweh break forth on them."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:23">19:23</a> Moses said to Yahweh, "The people can't come up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying, 'Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:24">19:24</a> Yahweh said to him, "Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you, but don't let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh, lest he break forth on them."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:25">19:25</a> So Moses went down to the people, and told them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> God spoke all these words, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> "I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> "You shall have no other gods before me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> "You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> "You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain, for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> You shall labor six days, and do all your work,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God. You shall not do any work in it, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day, and made it holy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> "You shall not murder.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> "You shall not commit adultery.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a> "You shall not steal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a> "You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> "You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> All the people perceived the thunderings, the lightnings, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled, and stayed at a distance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:19">20:19</a> They said to Moses, "Speak with us yourself, and we will listen; but don't let God speak with us, lest we die."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:20">20:20</a> Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid, for God has come to test you, and that his fear may be before you, that you won't sin."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:21">20:21</a> The people stayed at a distance, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:22">20:22</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "This is what you shall tell the children of Israel: 'You yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:23">20:23</a> You shall most certainly not make alongside of me gods of silver, or gods of gold for yourselves.</p>

 <p><a name="an_30:18">30:18</a> "You shall also make a basin of brass, and its base of brass, in which to wash. You shall put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.</p>

 <p><a name="an_30:34">30:34</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Take to yourself sweet spices, gum resin, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be an equal weight;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:35">30:35</a> and you shall make incense of it, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:36">30:36</a> and you shall beat some of it very small, and put some of it before the testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be to you most holy.</p>

 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:2">31:2</a> "Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:3">31:3</a> and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:4">31:4</a> to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of workmanship.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:6">31:6</a> I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:7">31:7</a> the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat that is on it, all the furniture of the Tent,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:8">31:8</a> the table and its vessels, the pure lampstand with all its vessels, the altar of incense,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:9">31:9</a> the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, the basin and its base,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:10">31:10</a> the finely worked garments--the holy garments for Aaron the priest--the garments of his sons to minister in the priest's office,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:11">31:11</a> the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you they shall do."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:12">31:12</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:13">31:13</a> "Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, 'Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:14">31:14</a> You shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:15">31:15</a> Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Yahweh. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:16">31:16</a> Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:17">31:17</a> It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:18">31:18</a> He gave to Moses, when he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets, written with God's finger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:1">32:1</a> When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, "Come, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:2">32:2</a> Aaron said to them, "Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:3">32:3</a> All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:4">32:4</a> He received what they handed him, and fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said, "These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:5">32:5</a> When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:6">32:6</a> They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:7">32:7</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Go, get down; for your people, who you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:8">32:8</a> They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, 'These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:9">32:9</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:10">32:10</a> Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:11">32:11</a> Moses begged Yahweh his God, and said, "Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, 'He brought them forth for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?' Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, 'I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your seed, and they shall inherit it forever.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:14">32:14</a> Yahweh repented of the evil which he said he would do to his people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:15">32:15</a> Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other they were written.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tables.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:17">32:17</a> When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is the noise of war in the camp."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> He said, "It isn't the voice of those who shout for victory, neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> It happened, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses' anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> He took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> Moses said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> Aaron said, "Don't let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:23">32:23</a> For they said to me, 'Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:24">32:24</a> I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let them take it off:' so they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> When Moses saw that the people had broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:26">32:26</a> then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is on Yahweh's side, come to me!" All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:27">32:27</a> He said to them, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:29">32:29</a> Moses said, "Consecrate yourselves today to Yahweh, yes, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:30">32:30</a> It happened on the next day, that Moses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin. Now I will go up to Yahweh. Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, "Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:32">32:32</a> Yet now, if you will, forgive their sin--and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have written."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:33">32:33</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:34">32:34</a> Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:35">32:35</a> Yahweh struck the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Depart, go up from here, you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your seed.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> to a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of you, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you in the way."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> When the people heard this evil news, they mourned: and no one put on his jewelry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:5">33:5</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell the children of Israel, 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go up into your midst for one moment, I would consume you. Therefore now take off your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:6">33:6</a> The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:7">33:7</a> Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it "The Tent of Meeting." It happened that everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:8">33:8</a> It happened that when Moses went out to the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses, until he had gone into the Tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a> It happened, when Moses entered into the Tent, that the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent, and spoke with Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:10">33:10</a> All the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshiped, everyone at their tent door.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:11">33:11</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. He turned again into the camp, but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, didn't depart out of the Tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:12">33:12</a> Moses said to Yahweh, "Behold, you tell me, 'Bring up this people:' and you haven't let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:13">33:13</a> Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:14">33:14</a> He said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:15">33:15</a> He said to him, "If your presence doesn't go with me, don't carry us up from here.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a> For how would people know that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Isn't it in that you go with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people who are on the surface of the earth?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:17">33:17</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "I will do this thing also that you have spoken; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:18">33:18</a> He said, "Please show me your glory."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:19">33:19</a> He said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:20">33:20</a> He said, "You cannot see my face, for man may not see me and live."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:21">33:21</a> Yahweh also said, "Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on the rock.</p>

 <p><a name="an_34:1">34:1</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Chisel two stone tablets like the first: and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.</p>

 <p><a name="an_34:4">34:4</a> He chiseled two tablets of stone like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him, and took in his hand two stone tablets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:5">34:5</a> Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:6">34:6</a> Yahweh passed by before him, and proclaimed, "Yahweh! Yahweh, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth,</p>

 <p><a name="an_34:8">34:8</a> Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.</p>

 <p><a name="an_40:7">40:7</a> You shall set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and shall put water therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:8">40:8</a> You shall set up the court around it, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:9">40:9</a> "You shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and shall make it holy, and all its furniture: and it will be holy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:10">40:10</a> You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar will be most holy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:11">40:11</a> You shall anoint the basin and its base, and sanctify it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:12">40:12</a> "You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shall wash them with water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:13">40:13</a> You shall put on Aaron the holy garments; and you shall anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister to me in the priest's office.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:14">40:14</a> You shall bring his sons, and put coats on them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:15">40:15</a> You shall anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office. Their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:16">40:16</a> Moses did so. According to all that Yahweh commanded him, so he did.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:17">40:17</a> It happened in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was raised up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:18">40:18</a> Moses raised up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and raised up its pillars.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:19">40:19</a> He spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof of the tabernacle above on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:20">40:20</a> He took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:21">40:21</a> He brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony, as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:22">40:22</a> He put the table in the Tent of Meeting, on the side of the tabernacle northward, outside of the veil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:23">40:23</a> He set the bread in order on it before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:24">40:24</a> He put the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting, opposite the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:25">40:25</a> He lit the lamps before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:26">40:26</a> He put the golden altar in the Tent of Meeting before the veil;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:27">40:27</a> and he burnt incense of sweet spices on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:28">40:28</a> He put up the screen of the door to the tabernacle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:29">40:29</a> He set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:30">40:30</a> He set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water therein, with which to wash.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:31">40:31</a> Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:32">40:32</a> When they went into the Tent of Meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed, as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:33">40:33</a> He raised up the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:34">40:34</a> Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of Yahweh filled the tabernacle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:35">40:35</a> Moses wasn't able to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and Yahweh's glory filled the tabernacle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:36">40:36</a> When the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:37">40:37</a> but if the cloud wasn't taken up, then they didn't travel until the day that it was taken up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:38">40:38</a> For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.</p>
