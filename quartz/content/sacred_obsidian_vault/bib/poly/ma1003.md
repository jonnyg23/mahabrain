 <p align="center"><a href="../apo/ma1003.htm">Apo</a></p><p>1 Then his son Judas, called Maccabeus, rose up in his stead. </p>
 <p>2 And all his brethren helped him, and so did all they that held with his father, and they fought with cheerfulness the battle of Israel. </p>
 <p>3 So he gat his people great honour, and put on a breastplate as a giant, and girt his warlike harness about him, and he made battles, protecting the host with his sword. </p>
 <p>4 In his acts he was like a lion, and like a lion's whelp roaring for his prey. </p>
 <p>5 For He pursued the wicked, and sought them out, and burnt up those that vexed his people. </p>
 <p>6 Wherefore the wicked shrunk for fear of him, and all the workers of iniquity were troubled, because salvation prospered in his hand. </p>
 <p>7 He grieved also many kings, and made Jacob glad with his acts, and his memorial is blessed for ever. </p>
 <p>8 Moreover he went through the cities of Juda, destroying the ungodly out of them, and turning away wrath from Israel: </p>
 <p>9 So that he was renowned unto the utmost part of the earth, and he received unto him such as were ready to perish. </p>
 <p>10 Then Apollonius gathered the Gentiles together, and a great host out of Samaria, to fight against Israel. </p>
 <p>11 Which thing when Judas perceived, he went forth to meet him, and so he smote him, and slew him: many also fell down slain, but the rest fled. </p>
 <p>12 Wherefore Judas took their spoils, and Apollonius' sword also, and therewith he fought all his life long. </p>
 <p>13 Now when Seron, a prince of the army of Syria, heard say that Judas had gathered unto him a multitude and company of the faithful to go out with him to war; </p>
 <p>14 He said, I will get me a name and honour in the kingdom; for I will go fight with Judas and them that are with him, who despise the king's commandment. </p>
 <p>15 So he made him ready to go up, and there went with him a mighty host of the ungodly to help him, and to be avenged of the children of Israel. </p>
 <p>16 And when he came near to the going up of Bethhoron, Judas went forth to meet him with a small company: </p>
 <p>17 Who, when they saw the host coming to meet them, said unto Judas, How shall we be able, being so few, to fight against so great a multitude and so strong, seeing we are ready to faint with fasting all this day? </p>
 <p>18 Unto whom Judas answered, It is no hard matter for many to be shut up in the hands of a few; and with the God of heaven it is all one, to deliver with a great multitude, or a small company: </p>
 <p>19 For the victory of battle standeth not in the multitude of an host; but strength cometh from heaven. </p>
 <p>20 They come against us in much pride and iniquity to destroy us, and our wives and children, and to spoil us: </p>
 <p>21 But we fight for our lives and our laws. </p>
 <p>22 Wherefore the Lord himself will overthrow them before our face: and as for you, be ye not afraid of them. </p>
 <p>23 Now as soon as he had left off speaking, he leapt suddenly upon them, and so Seron and his host was overthrown before him. </p>
 <p>24 And they pursued them from the going down of Bethhoron unto the plain, where were slain about eight hundred men of them; and the residue fled into the land of the Philistines. </p>
 <p>25 Then began the fear of Judas and his brethren, and an exceeding great dread, to fall upon the nations round about them: </p>
 <p>26 Insomuch as his fame came unto the king, and all nations talked of the battles of Judas. </p>
 <p>27 Now when king Antiochus heard these things, he was full of indignation: wherefore he sent and gathered together all the forces of his realm, even a very strong army. </p>
 <p>28 He opened also his treasure, and gave his soldiers pay for a year, commanding them to be ready whensoever he should need them. </p>
 <p>29 Nevertheless, when he saw that the money of his treasures failed and that the tributes in the country were small, because of the dissension and plague, which he had brought upon the land in taking away the laws which had been of old time; </p>
 <p>30 He feared that he should not be able to bear the charges any longer, nor to have such gifts to give so liberally as he did before: for he had abounded above the kings that were before him. </p>
 <p>31 Wherefore, being greatly perplexed in his mind, he determined to go into Persia, there to take the tributes of the countries, and to gather much money. </p>
 <p>32 So he left Lysias, a nobleman, and one of the blood royal, to oversee the affairs of the king from the river Euphrates unto the borders of Egypt: </p>
 <p>33 And to bring up his son Antiochus, until he came again. </p>
 <p>34 Moreover he delivered unto him the half of his forces, and the elephants, and gave him charge of all things that he would have done, as also concerning them that dwelt in Juda and Jerusalem: </p>
 <p>35 To wit, that he should send an army against them, to destroy and root out the strength of Israel, and the remnant of Jerusalem, and to take away their memorial from that place; </p>
 <p>36 And that he should place strangers in all their quarters, and divide their land by lot. </p>
 <p>37 So the king took the half of the forces that remained, and departed from Antioch, his royal city, the hundred forty and seventh year; and having passed the river Euphrates, he went through the high countries. </p>
 <p>38 Then Lysias chose Ptolemee the son of Dorymenes, Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty men of the king's friends: </p>
 <p>39 And with them he sent forty thousand footmen, and seven thousand horsemen, to go into the land of Juda, and to destroy it, as the king commanded. </p>
 <p>40 So they went forth with all their power, and came and pitched by Emmaus in the plain country. </p>
 <p>41 And the merchants of the country, hearing the fame of them, took silver and gold very much, with servants, and came into the camp to buy the children of Israel for slaves: a power also of Syria and of the land of the Philistines joined themselves unto them. </p>
 <p>42 Now when Judas and his brethren saw that miseries were multiplied, and that the forces did encamp themselves in their borders: for they knew how the king had given commandment to destroy the people, and utterly abolish them; </p>
 <p>43 They said one to another, Let us restore the decayed fortune of our people, and let us fight for our people and the sanctuary. </p>
 <p>44 Then was the congregation gathered together, that they might be ready for battle, and that they might pray, and ask mercy and compassion. </p>
 <p>45 Now Jerusalem lay void as a wilderness, there was none of her children that went in or out: the sanctuary also was trodden down, and aliens kept the strong hold; the heathen had their habitation in that place; and joy was taken from Jacob, and the pipe with the harp ceased. </p>
 <p>46 Wherefore the Israelites assembled themselves together, and came to Maspha, over against Jerusalem; for in Maspha was the place where they prayed aforetime in Israel. </p>
 <p>47 Then they fasted that day, and put on sackcloth, and cast ashes upon their heads, and rent their clothes, </p>
 <p>48 And laid open the book of the law, wherein the heathen had sought to paint the likeness of their images. </p>
 <p>49 They brought also the priests' garments, and the firstfruits, and the tithes: and the Nazarites they stirred up, who had accomplished their days. </p>
 <p>50 Then cried they with a loud voice toward heaven, saying, What shall we do with these, and whither shall we carry them away? </p>
 <p>51 For thy sanctuary is trodden down and profaned, and thy priests are in heaviness, and brought low. </p>
 <p>52 And lo, the heathen are assembled together against us to destroy us: what things they imagine against us, thou knowest. </p>
 <p>53 How shall we be able to stand against them, except thou, O God, be our help? </p>
 <p>54 Then sounded they with trumpets, and cried with a loud voice. </p>
 <p>55 And after this Judas ordained captains over the people, even captains over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens. </p>
 <p>56 But as for such as were building houses, or had betrothed wives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, those he commanded that they should return, every man to his own house, according to the law. </p>
 <p>57 So the camp removed, and pitched upon the south side of Emmaus. </p>
 <p>58 And Judas said, arm yourselves, and be valiant men, and see that ye be in readiness against the morning, that ye may fight with these nations, that are assembled together against us to destroy us and our sanctuary: </p>
 <p>59 For it is better for us to die in battle, than to behold the calamities of our people and our sanctuary. </p>
 <p>60 Nevertheless, as the will of God is in heaven, so let him do. </p>

 <p>51 καὶ τὰ ἅγιά σου καταπεπάτηνται καὶ βεβήλωνται καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς σου ἐν πένθει καὶ ταπεινώσει </p>

 <p>54 καὶ ἐσάλπισαν ταῖς σάλπιγξιν καὶ ἐβόησαν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ </p>
 <p>55 καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο κατέστησεν Ιουδας ἡγουμένους τοῦ λαοῦ χιλιάρχους καὶ ἑκατοντάρχους καὶ πεντηκοντάρχους καὶ δεκαδάρχους </p>
 <p>56 καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς οἰκοδομοῦσιν οἰκίας καὶ μνηστευομένοις γυναῖκας καὶ φυτεύουσιν ἀμπελῶνας καὶ δειλοῖς ἀποστρέφειν ἕκαστον εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ κατὰ τὸν νόμον </p>
 <p>57 καὶ ἀπῆρεν ἡ παρεμβολή καὶ παρενέβαλον κατὰ νότον Αμμαους </p>
 <p>58 καὶ εἶπεν Ιουδας περιζώσασθε καὶ γίνεσθε εἰς υἱοὺς δυνατοὺς καὶ γίνεσθε ἕτοιμοι εἰς πρωὶ τοῦ πολεμῆσαι ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν τούτοις τοῖς ἐπισυνηγμένοις ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς ἐξᾶραι ἡμᾶς καὶ τὰ ἅγια ἡμῶν </p>
 <p>59 ὅτι κρεῖσσον ἡμᾶς ἀποθανεῖν ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ ἢ ἐπιδεῖν ἐπὶ τὰ κακὰ τοῦ ἔθνους ἡμῶν καὶ τῶν ἁγίων </p>

 <p>27 Ut audivit autem rex Antiochus sermones istos, iratus est animo: et misit, et congregavit exercitum universi regni sui, castra fortia valde:</p>
 <p>28 et aperuit ærarium suum, et dedit stipendia exercitui in annum: et mandavit illis ut essent parati ad omnia.</p>
 <p>29 Et vidit quod defecit pecunia de thesauris suis, et tributa regionis modica propter dissensionem et plagam quam fecit in terra, ut tolleret legitima, quæ erant a primis diebus:</p>
 <p>30 et timuit ne non haberet ut semel et bis, in sumptus et donaria, quæ dederat ante larga manu: et abundaverat super reges qui ante eum fuerant.</p>
 <p>31 Et consternatus erat animo valde, et cogitavit ire in Persidem, et accipere tributa regionum, et congregare argentum multum.</p>
 <p>32 Et reliquit Lysiam hominem nobilem de genere regali, super negotia regia, a flumine Euphrate usque ad flumen Ægypti,</p>
 <p>33 et ut nutriret Antiochum filium suum, donec rediret.</p>
 <p>34 Et tradidit ei medium exercitum, et elephantos: et mandavit ei de omnibus quæ volebat, et de inhabitantibus Judæam, et Jerusalem:</p>
 <p>35 et ut mitteret ad eos exercitum ad conterendam et extirpandam virtutem Israël, et reliquias Jerusalem, et auferendam memoriam eorum de loco:</p>
 <p>36 et ut constitueret habitatores filios alienigenas in omnibus finibus eorum, et sorte distribueret terram eorum.</p>
 <p>37 Et rex assumpsit partem exercitus residui, et exivit ab Antiochia civitate regni sui anno centesimo et quadragesimo septimo: et transfretavit Euphraten flumen, et perambulabat superiores regiones.<br>
 </p>
 <p>38 Et elegit Lysias Ptolemæum filium Dorymini, et Nicanorem, et Gorgiam, viros potentes ex amicis regis:</p>
 <p>39 et misit cum eis quadraginta millia virorum, et septem millia equitum, ut venirent in terram Juda, et disperderent eam secundum verbum regis.</p>
 <p>40 Et processerunt cum universa virtute sua, et venerunt, et applicuerunt Emmaum in terra campestri.</p>
 <p>41 Et audierunt mercatores regionum nomen eorum: et acceperunt argentum, et aurum multum valde, et pueros, et venerunt in castra ut acciperent filios Israël in servos, et additi sunt ad eos exercitus Syriæ, et terræ alienigenarum.</p>
 <p>42 Et vidit Judas et fratres ejus, quia multiplicata sunt mala, et exercitus applicabant ad fines eorum: et cognoverunt verba regis, quæ mandavit populo facere in interitum et consummationem:</p>
 <p>43 et dixerunt unusquisque ad proximum suum: Erigamus dejectionem populi nostri, et pugnemus pro populo nostro, et sanctis nostris.</p>
 <p>44 Et congregatus est conventus ut essent parati in prælium, et ut orarent et peterent misericordiam et miserationes.</p>
 <p>45 Et Jerusalem non habitabatur, sed erat sicut desertum: non erat qui ingrederetur et egrederetur de natis ejus. Et sanctum conculcabatur: et filii alienigenarum erant in arce; ibi erat habitatio gentium: et ablata est voluptas a Jacob, et defecit ibi tibia et cithara.<br>
 </p>
 <p>46 Et congregati sunt, et venerunt in Maspha contra Jerusalem, quia locus orationis erat in Maspha ante in Israël.</p>
 <p>47 Et jejunaverunt illa die, et induerunt se ciliciis, et cinerem imposuerunt capiti suo, et disciderunt vestimenta sua:</p>
 <p>48 et expanderunt libros legis, de quibus scrutabantur gentes similitudinem simulacrorum suorum:</p>
 <p>49 et attulerunt ornamenta sacerdotalia, et primitias, et decimas: et suscitaverunt Nazaræos, qui impleverant dies,</p>
 <p>50 et clamaverunt voce magna in cælum, dicentes: Quid faciemus istis, et quo eos ducemus?</p>
 <p>51 et sancta tua conculcata sunt, et contaminata sunt, et sacerdotes tui facti sunt in luctum, et in humilitatem:</p>
 <p>52 et ecce nationes convenerunt adversum nos ut nos disperdant: tu scis quæ cogitant in nos.</p>
 <p>53 Quomodo poterimus subsistere ante faciem eorum, nisi tu, Deus, adjuves nos?</p>
 <p>54 Et tubis exclamaverunt voce magna.</p>
 <p>55 Et post hæc constituit Judas duces populi, tribunos, et centuriones, et pentacontarchos, et decuriones.</p>
 <p>56 Et dixit his, qui ædificabant domos, et sponsabant uxores, et plantabant vineas, et formidolosis, ut redirent unusquisque in domum suam secundum legem.</p>
 <p>57 Et moverunt castra, et collocaverunt ad austrum Emmaum.</p>
 <p>58 Et ait Judas: Accingimini, et estote filii potentes, et estote parati in mane, ut pugnetis adversus nationes has quæ convenerunt adversus nos disperdere nos, et sancta nostra:</p>
 <p>59 quoniam melius est nos mori in bello, quam videre mala gentis nostræ, et sanctorum.</p>
 <p>60 Sicut autem fuerit voluntas in cælo, sic fiat.</p>
