  <h3 align="center">Douay-Rheims Bible: Sirach</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_0:1">0:1</a> THE knowledge of many and great things hath been shewn us by the law, and the prophets, and others that have followed them: for which things Israel is to be commended for doctrine and wisdom, because not only they that speak must needs be skilful, but strangers also, both speaking and writing, may by their means become most learned.  </p> 
 <p><a name="an_0:2">0:2</a> My grandfather Jesus, after he had much given himself to a diligent reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books, that were delivered to us from our fathers, had a mind also to write something himself, pertaining to doctrine and wisdom: that such as are desirous to learn, and are made knowing in these things, may be more and more attentive in mind, and be strengthened to live according to the law.  </p> 
 <p><a name="an_0:3">0:3</a> I entreat you therefore to come with benevolence, and to read with attention, and to pardon us for those things wherein we may seem, while we follow the image of wisdom, to come short in the composition of words; for the Hebrew words have not the same force in them when translated into another tongue. And not only these, but the law also itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language.  </p> 
 <p><a name="an_0:4">0:4</a> For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Ptolemy Evergetes was king, and continuing there a long time, I found there books left, of no small nor contemptible learning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_0:5">0:5</a> Therefore I thought it good, and necessary for me to bestow some diligence and labour to interpret this book; and with much watching and study in some space of time, I brought the book to an end, and set it forth for the service of them that are willing to apply their mind, and to learn how they ought to conduct themselves, who purpose to lead their life according to the law of the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> ALL wisdom is from the Lord God, and hath been always with him, and is before all time. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Who hath numbered the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of the world? Who hath measured the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the depth of the abyss? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Who hath searched out the wisdom of God that goeth before all things? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from everlasting. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> The word of God on high is the fountain of wisdom, and her ways are everlasting commandments. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed, and who hath known her wise counsels? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> To whom hath the discipline of wisdom been revealed and made manifest? and who hath understood the multiplicity of her steps? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> There is one most high Creator Almighty, and a powerful king, and greatly to be feared, who sitteth upon his throne, and is the God of dominion. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> He created her in the Holy Ghost, and saw her, and numbered her, and measured her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And he poured her out upon all his works, and upon all flesh according to his gift, and hath given her to them that love him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladness, and a crown of joy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> The fear of the Lord shall delight the heart, and shall give joy, and gladness, and length of days. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> With him that feareth the Lord, it shall go well in the latter end, and in the day of his death he shall be blessed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> The love of God is honourable wisdom. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And they to whom she shall shew herself love her by the sight, and by the knowledge of her great works. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> The fear of the Lord Is the beginning of wisdom, and was created with the faithful in the womb, it walketh with chosen women, and is known with the just and faithful. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> The fear of the Lord is the religiousness of knowledge. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> Religiousness shall keep and justify the heart, it shall give joy and gladness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> It shall go well with him that feareth the Lord, and in the days of his end he shall be blessed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> To fear God is the fulness of wisdom, and fulness is from the fruits thereof. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> She shall fill all her house with her increase, and the storehouses with her treasures. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, filling up peace and the fruit of salvation: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> And it hath seen, and numbered her: but both are the gifts of God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> Wisdom shall distribute knowledge, and understanding of prudence: and exalteth the glory of them that hold her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord: and the branches thereof are longlived. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> In the treasures of wisdom is understanding, and religiousness of knowledge: but to sinners wisdom is an abomination. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> The fear of the Lord driveth out sin: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> For he that is without fear, cannot be justified: for the wrath of his high spirits is his ruin. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> A patient man shall bear for a time, and afterwards joy shall be restored to him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> A good understanding will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shall declare his wisdom. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:31">1:31</a> In the treasures of wisdom is the signification of discipline: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:32">1:32</a> But the worship of God is an abomination to a sinner. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:33">1:33</a> Son, if thou desire wisdom, keep justice, and God will give her to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:34">1:34</a> For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and discipline: and that which is agreeable to him, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:35">1:35</a> Is faith, and meekness: and he will fill up his treasures. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:36">1:36</a> Be not incredulous to the fear of the Lord: and come not to him with a double heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:37">1:37</a> Be not a hypocrite in the sight of men, and let not thy lips be a stumblingblock to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:38">1:38</a> Watch over them, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon thy soul, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:39">1:39</a> And God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in the midst of the congregation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:40">1:40</a> Because thou camest to the Lord wickedly, and thy heart is full of guile and deceit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> SON, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> Humble thy heart, and endure: incline thy ear, and receive the words of understanding: and make not haste in the time of clouds. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Wait on God with patience: join thyself to God, and endure, that thy life may be increased in the latter end. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> Take all that shall be brought upon thee: and in thy sorrow endure, and in thy humiliation keep patience. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> For gold and silver are tried in the fire, but acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> Believe God, and he will recover thee: and direct thy way, and trust in him. Keep his fear, and grow old therein. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy: and go not aside from him, lest ye fall. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> Ye that fear the Lord, believe him: and your reward shall not be made void. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Ye that fear the Lord, hope in him: and mercy shall come to you for your delight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Ye that fear the Lord, love him, and your hearts shall be enlightened. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> My children behold the generations of men: and know ye that no one hath hoped in the Lord, and hath been confounded. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> For who hath continued in his commandment, and hath been forsaken? or who hath called upon him, and he despised him? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> For God is compassionate and merciful, and will forgive sins in the day of tribulation: and he is a protector to all that seek him in truth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Woe to them that are of a double heart and to wicked lips, and to the hands that do evil, and to the sinner that goeth on the earth two ways. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> Woe to them that are fainthearted, who believe not God: and therefore they shall not be protected by him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> Woe to them that have lost patience, and that have forsaken the right ways, and have gone aside into crooked ways. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And what will they do, when the Lord shall begin to examine? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> They that fear the Lord, will not be incredulous to his word: and they that love him, will keep his way. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> They that fear the Lord, will seek after the things that are well pleasing to him: and they that love him, shall be filled with his law. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> They that fear the Lord, will prepare their hearts, and in his sight will sanctify their souls. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> They that fear the Lord, keep his Commandments, and will have patience even until his visitation, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> Saying: If we do not penance, we shall fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> For according to his greatness, so also is his mercy with him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> THE sons of wisdom are the church of the just: and their generation, obedience and love. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> Children, hear the judgment of your father, and so do that you may be saved. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> For God hath made the father honourable to the children: and seeking the judgment of the mothers, hath confirmed it upon the children. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> He that loveth God, shall obtain pardon for his sine by prayer, and shall refrain himself from them, and shall be heard in the prayer of days. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up a treasure. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> He that honoureth his father shall have joy in his own children, and in the day of his prayer he shall be heard. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> He that honoureth his father shall enjoy a long life: and he that obeyeth the father, shall be a comfort to his mother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> He that feareth the Lord, honoureth his parents, and will serve them as his masters that brought him into the world. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Honour thy father, in work and word, and all patience, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> That a blessing may come upon thee from him, and his blessing may remain in the latter end. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> The father's blessing establisheth the houses of the children: but the mother's curse rooteth up the foundation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Glory not in the dishonour of thy father: for his shame is no glory to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father, and a father without honour is the disgrace of the son. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> Son, support the old age of thy father, and grieve him not in his life; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And if his understanding fail, have patience with him, and despise him not when thou art in thy strength: for the relieving of the father shall not be for- gotten. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> For good shall be repaid to thee for the sin of thy mother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> And in justice thou shalt be built up, and in the day of affliction thou shalt be remembered: and thy sine shall melt away as the ice in the fair warm weather. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> Of what an evil fame is he that forsaketh his father: and he is cursed of God that angereth his mother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> My son, do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be beloved above the glory of men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all things, and thou shalt find grace before God: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> For great is the power of God alone, and he is honoured by the humble. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> Seek not the things that are too high for thee, and search not into things above thy ability: but the things that God hath commanded thee, think on them always, and in many of his works be not curious. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> For it is not necessary for thee to see with thy eyes those things that are hid. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> In unnecessary matters be not over curious, and in many of his works thou shalt not be inquisitive. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> For many things are shewn to thee above the understanding of men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> And the suspicion of them hath deceived many, and hath detained their minds in vanity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> A hard heart shall fear evil at the last: and he that loveth danger shall perish in it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:28">3:28</a> A heart that goeth two ways shall not have success, and the perverse of heart shall be scandalized therein. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:29">3:29</a> A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows, and the sinner will add sin to sin. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:30">3:30</a> The congregation of the proud shall not be healed: for the plant of wickedness shall take root in them, and it shall not be perceived. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:31">3:31</a> The heart of the wise is understood in wisdom, and a good ear will hear wisdom with all desire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:32">3:32</a> A wise heart, and which hath under- standing, will abstain from sine, and in the works of justice shall have success. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:33">3:33</a> Water quencheth a flaming fire, and alms resisteth sins: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:34">3:34</a> And God provideth for him that sheweth favour: he remembereth him afterwards, and in the time of his fall he shall find a sure stay. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> SON, defraud not the poor of alms, and turn not away thy eyes from the poor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> Despise not the hungry soul: and provoke not the Boor in his want. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> Afflict not the heart of the needy, and defer not to give to him that is in distress. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Reject not the petition of the afflicted: and turn not away thy face from the needy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Turn not away thy eyes from the poor for fear of anger: and leave not to them that ask of thee to curse thee behind thy back. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> For the prayer of him that curseth thee in the bitterness of his soul, shall be heard, for he that made him will hear him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Make thyself affable to the congregation of the poor, and humble thy soul to the ancient, and bow thy head to a great man. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> Bow down thy ear cheerfully to the poor, and pay what thou owest, and answer him peaceable words with mildness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> Deliver him that suffereth wrong out of the hand of the proud: and be not fainthearted in thy soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> In judging be merciful to the fatherless as a father, and as a husband to their mother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And thou shalt be as the obedient son of the most High, and he will have mercy on thee more than a mother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> Wisdom inspireth life into her children, and protecteth them that seek after her, and will go before them in the way of justice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> And he that loveth her, loveth life: and they that watch for her, shall embrace her sweetness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> They that hold her fast, shall inherit life: and whithersoever she entereth, God will give a blessing. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> They that serve her, shall be servants to the holy one: and God loveth them that love her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> He that hearkeneth to her, shall judge nations: and he that looketh upon her, shall remain secure. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> If he trust to her, he shall inherit her, and his generation shall be in assurance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> For she walketh with him in temptation, and at the first she chooseth him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> She will bring upon him fear and dread and trial: and she will scourge him with the affliction of her discipline, till she try him by her laws, and trust his soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> Then she will strengthen him, and make a straight way to him, and give him joy, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> And will disclose her secrets to him, and will heap upon him treasures of knowledge and understanding of justice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> But if he go astray, she will forsake him, and deliver him into the hands of his enemy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> Son, observe the time, and fly from evil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> For thy soul be not ashamed to say the truth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> For there is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that bringeth glory and grace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> Accept no person against thy own person, nor against thy soul a lie. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> Reverence not thy neighbour in his fall: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:28">4:28</a> And refrain not to speak in the time of salvation. Hide not thy wisdom in her beauty. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:29">4:29</a> For by the tongue wisdom is discerned: and understanding, and knowledge, and learning by the word of the wise, and steadfastness in the works of justice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:30">4:30</a> In nowise speak against the truth, but be ashamed of the lie of thy ignorance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:31">4:31</a> Be not ashamed to confess thy sins, but submit not thyself to every man for sin. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:32">4:32</a> Resist not against the face of the mighty, and do not strive against the stream of the river. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:33">4:33</a> Strive for justice for thy soul, and even unto death fight for justice, and God will overthrow thy enemies for thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:34">4:34</a> Be not hasty in thy tongue: and slack and remiss in thy works. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:35">4:35</a> Be not as a lion in thy house, terrifying them of thy household, and oppressing them that are under thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:36">4:36</a> Let not thy hand be stretched out to receive, and shut when thou shouldst give. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> SET not thy heart upon unjust possessions, and say not: I have enough to live on: for it shall be of no service in the time of vengeance and darkness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> Follow not in thy strength the desires of thy heart: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And say not: How mighty am I? and who shall bring me under for my deeds? for God will surely take revenge. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> Say not: I have sinned, and whet harm hath befallen me? for the most High is a patient rewarder. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> Be not without fear about sin forgiven, and add not sin upon sin: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And say not: The mercy of the Lord is great, he will have mercy on the multitude of my sins. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> For mercy and wrath quickly come from him, and his wrath looketh upon sinners. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Delay not to be converted to the Lord, and defer it not from day to day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> For his wrath shall come on a sudden, and in the time of vengeance he will destroy thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> Be not anxious for goods unjustly gotten: for they shall not profit thee in the day of calamity and revenge. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way: for so is every sinner proved by a double tongue. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> Be steadfast in the way of the Lord, and in the truth of thy judgment, and in knowledge, and let the word of peace and justice keep with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> Be meek to hear the word, that thou mayst understand: and return a true answer with wisdom. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> If thou have understanding, answer thy neighbour: but if not, let thy hand be upon thy mouth, lest thou be surprised in an unskilful word, and be confounded. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> Honour and glory is in the word of the wise, but the tongue of the fool is his ruin. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> Be not called a whisperer, and be not taken in thy tongue, and confounded. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> For confusion and repentance is upon a thief, and an evil mark of disgrace upon the double tongued, but to the whisperer hatred, and enmity, and reproach. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> Justify alike the small and the great. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> INSTEAD of a friend become not an enemy to thy neighbour: for an evil man shall inherit reproach and shame, so shall every sinner that is envious and double tongued. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> Extol not thyself in the thoughts of thy soul like a bull: lest thy strength be quashed by folly, </p>

 <p><a name="an_44:24">44:24</a> And he did in like manner with Isaac for the sake of Abraham his father. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:25">44:25</a> The Lord gave him the blessing of all nations, and confirmed his covenant upon the head of Jacob. </p>

 <p><a name="an_45:4">45:4</a> He sanctified him in his faith, and meekness, and chose him out of all flesh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:5">45:5</a> For he heard him, and his voice, and brought him into a cloud. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:6">45:6</a> And he gave him commandments before his face, and a law of life and instruction, that he might teach Jacob his covenant, and Israel his judgments. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:7">45:7</a> He exalted Aaron his brother, and like to himself of the tribe of Levi: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:8">45:8</a> He made an everlasting covenant with him, and gave him the priesthood of the nation, and made him blessed in glory, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:9">45:9</a> And he girded him about with a glorious girdle, and clothed him with a robe of glory, and crowned him with majestic attire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:10">45:10</a> He put upon him a garment to the feet, and breeches, and as ephod, and he compassed him with many little bells of gold all round about, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:11">45:11</a> That as he went there might be a sound, and a noise made that might be heard in the temple, for a memorial to the children of his people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:12">45:12</a> He gave him a holy robe of gold, and blue, and purple, a woven work of a wise man, endued with judgment and truth: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:13">45:13</a> Of twisted scarlet the work of an artist, with precious stones cut and set in gold, and graven by the work of a lapidary for a memorial, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:14">45:14</a> And a crown of gold upon his mitre wherein was engraved Holiness, an ornament of honour: a work of power, and delightful to the eyes for its beauty. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:15">45:15</a> Before him there were none so beautiful, even from the beginning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:16">45:16</a> No stranger was ever clothed with them, but only his children alone, and his grandchildren for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:17">45:17</a> His sacrifices were consumed with fire every day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:18">45:18</a> Moses filled his hands and anointed him with holy oil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:19">45:19</a> This was made to him for an everlasting testament, and to his seed as the days of heaven, to execute the office of the priesthood, and to have praise, and to glorify his people in his name. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:20">45:20</a> He chose him out of all men living, to offer sacrifice to God, incense, and a good savour, for a memorial to make reconciliation for his people: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:21">45:21</a> And he gave him power in his commandments, in the covenants of his judgments, that he should teach Jacob his testimonies, and give light to Israel in his law. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:22">45:22</a> And strangers stood up against him, and through envy the men that were with Dathan and Abiron, compassed him about in the wilderness, and the congregation of Core in their wrath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:23">45:23</a> The Lord God saw and it pleased him not, and they were consumed in his wrathful indignation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:24">45:24</a> He wrought wonders upon them, and consumed them with a flame of fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:25">45:25</a> And he added glory to Aaron, and gave him an inheritance, and divided unto him the firstfruits of the increase of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:26">45:26</a> He prepared them bread in the first place unto fulness: for the sacrifices also of the Lord they shall eat, which he gave to him, and to his seed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:27">45:27</a> But he shall not inherit among the people in the land, and he hath no portion among the people: for he himself is his portion and inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:28">45:28</a> Phinees the son of Eleazar is the third in glory, by imitating him in the fear of the Lord: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:29">45:29</a> And he stood up in the shameful fall of the people: in the goodness and readiness of his soul he appeased God for Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:30">45:30</a> Therefore he made to him a covenant of peace, to be the prince of the sanctuary, and of his people, that the dignity of priesthood should be to him and to his seed for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:31">45:31</a> And a covenant to David the king, the son of Jesse of the tribe of Juda, an inheritance to him and to his seed, that he might give wisdom into our heart to judge his people in justice, that their good things might not be abolished, and he made their glory in their nation everlasting. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:1">46:1</a> VALIANT in war was Jesus the son of Nave, who was successor of Moses among the prophets, who was great according to his name, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:2">46:2</a> Very great for the saving the elect of God, to overthrow the enemies that rose up against them, that he might get the inheritance for Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:3">46:3</a> How great glory did he gain when he lifted up his hands, and stretched out swords against the cities? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:4">46:4</a> Who before him hath so resisted? for the Lord himself brought the enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:5">46:5</a> Was not the sun stopped in his anger, and one day made as two? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:6">46:6</a> He called upon the most high Sovereign when the enemies assaulted him on every side, and the great and holy God heard him by hailstones of exceeding great force. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:7">46:7</a> He made a violent assault against the nation of his enemies, and in the descent he destroyed the adversaries. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:8">46:8</a> That the nations might know his power, that it is not easy to fight against God. And he followed the mighty one: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:9">46:9</a> And in the days of Moses he did a work of mercy, he and Caleb the son of Jephone, in standing against the enemy, and withholding the people from sins, and appeasing the wicked murmuring. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:10">46:10</a> And they two being appointed, were delivered out of the danger from among the number of six hundred thousand men on foot, to bring them into their inheritance, into the land that floweth with milk and honey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:11">46:11</a> And the Lord gave strength also to Caleb, and his strength continued even to his old age, so that he went up to the high places of the land, and his seed obtained it for an inheritance: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:12">46:12</a> That all the children of Israel might see, that it is good to obey the holy God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:13">46:13</a> Then all the judges, every one by name, whose heart was not corrupted: who turned not away from the Lord, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:14">46:14</a> That their memory might be blessed, and their bones spring up out of their place, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:15">46:15</a> And their name continue for ever, the glory of the holy men remaining unto their children. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:16">46:16</a> Samuel the prophet of the Lord, the beloved of the Lord his God, established a new government, and anointed princes over his people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:17">46:17</a> By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, and the God of Jacob beheld, and by his fidelity he was proved a prophet. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:18">46:18</a> And he was known to be faithful in his words, because he saw the God of light: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:19">46:19</a> And called upon the name of the Lord Almighty, in fighting against the enemies who beset him on every side, when he offered a lamb without blemish. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:20">46:20</a> And the Lord thundered from heaven, and with a great noise made his voice to be heard. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:21">46:21</a> And he crushed the princes of the Tyrians, and all the lords of the Philistines: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:22">46:22</a> And before the time of the end of his life in the world, he protested before the Lord, and his anointed: money, or any thing else, even to a shoe, he had not taken of any man, and no mall did accuse him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:23">46:23</a> And after this he slept, and he made known to the king, and shewed him the end of his life, and he lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy to blot out the wickedness of the nation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:1">47:1</a> THEN Nathan the prophet arose in the days of David. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:2">47:2</a> And as the fat taken away from the flesh, so was David chosen from among the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:3">47:3</a> He played with lions as with lambs: and with bears he did in like manner as with the lambs of the flock, in his youth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:4">47:4</a> Did not he kill the giant, and take away reproach from his people? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:5">47:5</a> In lifting up his hand, with the stone in the sling he beat down the boasting of Goliath: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:6">47:6</a> For he called upoI </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:1">47:1</a> the Lord the Almighty, and he gave strength in his right hand, to take away the mighty warrior, and to set up the horn of his nation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:7">47:7</a> So in ten thousand did he glorify him, and praised him in the blessings of the Lord, in offering to him a crown of glory: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:8">47:8</a> For he destroyed the enemies on every side, and extirpated the Philistines the adversaries unto this day: he broke their horn for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:9">47:9</a> In all his works he gave thanks to the holy one, and to the most High, with words of glory. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:10">47:10</a> With his whole heart he praised the Lord, and loved God that made him: and he gave him power against his enemies: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:11">47:11</a> And he set singers before the altar, and by their voices he made sweet melody. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:12">47:12</a> And to the festivals he added beauty, and set in order the solemn times even to the end of his life, that they should praise the holy name of the Lord, and magnify the holiness of God in the morning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:13">47:13</a> The Lord took away his sine, and exalted his horn for ever: and he gave him a covenant of the kingdom, and a throne of glory in Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:14">47:14</a> After him arose up a wise son, and for his sake he cast down all the power of the enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:15">47:15</a> Solomon reigned in days of peace, and God brought all his enemies under him, that he might build a house in his name, and prepare a sanctuary for ever: O how wise wast thou in thy youth! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:16">47:16</a> And thou wast filled as a river with wisdom, and thy soul covered the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:17">47:17</a> And thou didst multiply riddles in parables: thy name went abroad to the islands far off, and thou wast beloved in thy peace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:18">47:18</a> The countries wondered at thee for thy canticles, and proverbs, and parables, and interpretations, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:19">47:19</a> And at the name of the Lord God, whose surname is, God of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:20">47:20</a> Thou didst gather gold as copper, and didst multiply silver as lead, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:21">47:21</a> And thou didst bow thyself to women: and by thy body thou wast brought under subjection. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:22">47:22</a> Thou hast stained thy glory, and defiled thy seed so as to bring wrath upon thy children, and to have thy folly kindled, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:23">47:23</a> That thou shouldst make the kingdom to be divided, and out of Ephraim a rebellious kingdom to rule. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:24">47:24</a> But God will not leave off his mercy, and he will not destroy, nor abolish his own works, neither will he out up by the roots the offspring of his elect: and he will not utterly take away the seed of him that loveth the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:25">47:25</a> Wherefore he gave a remnant to Jacob, and to David of the same stock. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:26">47:26</a> And Solomon had an end with his fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:27">47:27</a> And he left behind him of his seed, the folly of the nation, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:28">47:28</a> Even Roboam that had little wisdom, who turned away the people through his counsel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:29">47:29</a> And Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who caused Israel to sin, and shewed Ephraim the way of sin, and their sins were multiplied exceedingly. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:30">47:30</a> They removed them far away from their land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:31">47:31</a> And they sought out all iniquities, till vengeance came upon them, and put an end to all their sine. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:1">48:1</a> AND Elias the prophet stood up, as a fire, and his word burnt like a torch. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:2">48:2</a> He brought a famine upon them, and they that provoked him in their envy, were reduced to a small number, for they could not endure the commandments of the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:3">48:3</a> By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven, and he brought down fire from heaven thrice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:4">48:4</a> Thus was Elias magnified in his wondrous works. And who can glory like to thee? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:5">48:5</a> Who raisedst up a dead man from below, from the lot of death, by the word of the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:6">48:6</a> Who broughtest down kings to destruction, and brokest easily their power in pieces, and the glorious from their bed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:7">48:7</a> Who heardest judgment in Sina, and in Horeb the judgments of vengeance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:8">48:8</a> Who anointedst kings to penance, and madest prophets successors after thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:9">48:9</a> Who wast taken up in a whirlwind of fire, in a chariot of fiery horses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:10">48:10</a> Who art registered in the judgments of times to appease the wrath of the Lord, to reconcile the heart of the father to the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:11">48:11</a> Blessed are they that saw thee, and were honoured with thy friendship. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:12">48:12</a> For we live only in our life, but after death our name shall not be such. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:13">48:13</a> Elias was indeed covered with the whirlwind, and his spirit was filled up in Eliseus: in his days he feared not the prince, and no man was more powerful than he. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:14">48:14</a> No word could overcome him, and after death his body prophesied. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:15">48:15</a> In his life he did great wonders, and is death he wrought miracles. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:16">48:16</a> For all this the people repented not, neither did they depart from their sins till they were cast out of their land, and were scattered through all the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:17">48:17</a> And there was left but a small people, and a prince in the house of David. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:18">48:18</a> Some of these did that which pleased God: but others committed many sine. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:19">48:19</a> Ezechias fortified his city, and brought in water into the midst thereof, and he digged a rock with iron, and made a well for water. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:20">48:20</a> In his days Sennacherib came up, and sent Rabsaces, and lifted up his hand against them, and he stretched out his hand against Sion, and became proud through his power. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:21">48:21</a> Then their hearts and hands trembled, and they were in pain as women in travail. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:22">48:22</a> And they called upon the Lord who is merciful, and spreading their hands, they lifted them up to heaven: and the holy Lord God quickly heard their voice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:23">48:23</a> He was not mindful of their sins, neither did he deliver them up to their enemies, but he purified them by the hand of Isaias, the holy prophet. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:24">48:24</a> He overthrew the army of the Assyrians, and the angel of the Lord destroyed them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:25">48:25</a> For Ezechias did that which pleased God, and walked valiantly in the way of David his father, which Isaias, the great prophet, and faithful in the sight of God, had commanded him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:26">48:26</a> In his days the sun went backward, and he lengthened the king's life. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:27">48:27</a> With a great spirit he saw the things that are to come to pass at last, and comforted the mourners in Sion. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:28">48:28</a> He shewed what should come to pass for ever, and secret things before they came. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:1">49:1</a> THE memory of Josias is like the composition of a sweet smell made by the art of a perfumer: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:2">49:2</a> His remembrance shall be sweet as honey in every mouth, and as music at a banquet of wine. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:3">49:3</a> He was directed by God unto the repentance of the nation, and he took away the abominations of wickedness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:4">49:4</a> And he directed his heart towards the Lord, and in the days of sinners he strengthened godliness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:5">49:5</a> Except David, and Ezechias, and Josias, all committed sin. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:6">49:6</a> For the kings of Juda forsook the law of the most High, and despised the fear of God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:7">49:7</a> So they gave their kingdom to others, and their glory to a strange nation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:8">49:8</a> They burnt the chosen city of holiness, and made the streets thereof desolate according to the prediction of Jeremias. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:9">49:9</a> For they treated him evil, who was consecrated a prophet from his mother's womb, to overthrow, and pluck up, and destroy, and to build again, and renew. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:10">49:10</a> It was Ezechiel that saw the glorious vision, which was shewn him upon the chariot of cherubims. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:11">49:11</a> For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of rain, and of doing good to them that shewed right ways. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:12">49:12</a> And may the bones of the twelve prophets spring up out of their place: for they strengthened Jacob, and re- deemed themselves by strong faith. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:13">49:13</a> How shall we magnify Zorobabel? for he was as a signet on the right hand; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:14">49:14</a> In like manner Jesus the son of Josedec? who in their days built the house, and set up a holy temple to the Lord, prepared for everlasting glory. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:15">49:15</a> And let Nehemias be a long time remembered, who raised up for us our walls that were cast down, and set up the gates and the bars, who rebuilt our houses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:16">49:16</a> No man was born upon earth like Henoch: for he also was taken up from the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:17">49:17</a> Nor as Joseph, who was a man born prince of his brethren, the support of his family, the ruler of his brethren, the stay of the people: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:18">49:18</a> And his bones were visited, and after death they prophesied. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:19">49:19</a> Seth and Sem obtained glory among men: and above every soul Adam in the beginning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:1">50:1</a> SIMON the high priest, the son of Onias, who in his life propped up the house, and in his days fortified the temple. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:2">50:2</a> By him also the height of the temple was founded, the double building and the high walls of the temple. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:3">50:3</a> In his days the wells of water flowed out, and they were filled as the sea above measure. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:4">50:4</a> He took care of his nation, and delivered it from destruction. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:5">50:5</a> He prevailed to enlarge the city, and obtained glory in his conversation with the people: and enlarged the entrance of the house and the court. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:6">50:6</a> He shone in his days as the morning star in the midst of a cloud, and as the moon at the full. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:7">50:7</a> And as the sun when it shineth, so did he shine in the temple of God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:8">50:8</a> And as the rainbow giving light in the bright clouds, and as the flower of roses in the days of the spring, and as the lilies that are on the brink of the water, and as the sweet smelling frankincense in the time of summer. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:9">50:9</a> As a bright Are, and frankincense burning in the fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:10">50:10</a> As a massy vessel of gold, adorned with every precious stone. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:11">50:11</a> As an olive tree budding forth, and a cypress tree rearing itself on high, when he put on the robe of glory, and was clothed with the perfection of power. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:12">50:12</a> When he went up to the holy altar, he honoured the vesture of holiness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:13">50:13</a> And when he took the portions out of the hands of the priests, he himself stood by the altar. And about him was the ring of his brethren: and as the cedar planted in mount Libanus, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:14">50:14</a> And as branches of palm trees, they stood round about him, and all the sons of Aaron in their glory. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:15">50:15</a> And the oblation of the Lord was in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel: and finishing his service, on the altar, to honour the offering of the most high Ring, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:16">50:16</a> He stretched forth his hand to make a libation, and offered of the blood of the grape. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:17">50:17</a> He poured out at the foot of the altar a divine odour to the most high Prince. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:18">50:18</a> Then the sons of Aaron shouted, they sounded with beaten trumpets, and made a great noise to be heard for a remembrance before God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:19">50:19</a> Then all the people together made haste, and fell down to the earth upon their faces, to adore the Lord their God, and to pray to the Almighty God the most High. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:20">50:20</a> And the singers lifted up their voices. and in the great house the sound of sweet melody was increased. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:21">50:21</a> And the people in prayer besought the Lord the most High, until the worship of the Lord was perfected, and they had finished their office. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:22">50:22</a> Then coming down, he lifted up his hands over all the congregation of the children of Israel, to give glory to God with his lips, and to glory in his name: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:23">50:23</a> And he repeated his prayer, willing to shew the power of God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:24">50:24</a> And now pray ye to the God of all, who hath done great things in all the earth, who hath increased our days from our mother's womb, and hath done with us according to his mercy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:25">50:25</a> May he grant us joyfulness of heart, and that there be peace in our days in Israel for ever: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:26">50:26</a> That Israel may believe that the mercy of God is with us, to deliver us in his days. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:27">50:27</a> There are two nations which my soul abhorreth: and the third is no nation, which I hate: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:28">50:28</a> They that sit on mount Seir, and the Philistines, and the foolish people that dwell in Sichem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:29">50:29</a> Jesus the son of Sirach, of Jerusalem, hath written in this book the doctrine of wisdom and instruction, who renewed wisdom from his heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:30">50:30</a> Blessed is he that is conversant in these good things: and he that layeth them up in his heart, shall be wise always. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:31">50:31</a> For if he do them, he shall be strong to do all things: because the light of God guideth his steps. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:1">51:1</a> A PRAYER of Jesus the son of Sirach. I will give glory to thee, O Lord, O King, and I will praise thee, O God my Saviour. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:2">51:2</a> I will give glory to thy name: for thou best been a helper and protector to me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:3">51:3</a> And hast preserved my body from destruction, from the snare of an unjust tongue, and from the lips of them that forge lies, and in the sight of them that stood by, thou hast been my helper. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:4">51:4</a> And thou hast delivered me, according to the multitude of the mercy of thy name, from them that did roar, prepared to devour. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:5">51:5</a> Out of the hands of them that sought my life, and from the gates of afflictions, which compassed me about: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:6">51:6</a> From the oppression of the flame which surrounded me, and in the midst of the fire I was not burnt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:7">51:7</a> From the depth of the belly of hell, and from an unclean tongue, and from lying words, from an unjust king, and from a slanderous tongue: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:8">51:8</a> My soul shall praise the Lord even to death. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:9">51:9</a> And my life was drawing near to hell beneath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:10">51:10</a> They compassed me on every side, and there was no one that would help me. I looked for the succour of men, and there was none. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:11">51:11</a> I remembered thy mercy, O Lord, and thy works, which are from the beginning of the world. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:12">51:12</a> How thou deliverest them that wait for thee, O Lord, and savest them out of the hands of the nations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:13">51:13</a> Thou hast exalted my dwelling place upon the earth and I have prayed for death to pass away. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:14">51:14</a> I called upon the Lord, the father of my Lord, that he would not leave me in the day of my trouble, and in the time of the proud without help. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:15">51:15</a> I will praise thy name continually, and will praise it with thanksgiving, and my prayer was heard. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:16">51:16</a> And thou hast saved me from destruction, and hast delivered me from the evil time. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:17">51:17</a> Therefore I will give thanks, and praise thee, and bless the name of the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:18">51:18</a> When I was yet young, before I wandered about, I sought for wisdom openly in my prayer. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:19">51:19</a> I prayed for her before the temple, and unto the very end I will seek after her, and she flourished as a grape soon ripe. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:20">51:20</a> My heart delighted in her, my foot walked in the right way, from my youth up I sought after her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:21">51:21</a> I bowed down my ear a little, and received her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:22">51:22</a> I found much wisdom in myself, and I profited much therein. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:23">51:23</a> To him that giveth me wisdom, will I give glory. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:24">51:24</a> For I have determined to follow her: I have had a zeal for good, and shall not be confounded. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:25">51:25</a> My soul hath wrestled for her, and in doing it I have been confirmed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:26">51:26</a> I stretched forth my hands on high, and I bewailed my ignorance of her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:27">51:27</a> I directed my soul to her, and in knowledge I found her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:28">51:28</a> I possessed my heart with her from the beginning: therefore I shall not be forsaken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:29">51:29</a> My entrails were troubled in seeking her: therefore shall I possess a good possession. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:30">51:30</a> The Lord hath given me a tongue for my reward: and with it I will praise him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:31">51:31</a> Draw near to me, ye unlearned, and gather yourselves together into the house of discipline. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:32">51:32</a> Why are ye slow? and what do you say of these things? your souls are exceeding thirsty. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:33">51:33</a> I have opened my mouth, and have spoken: buy her for yourselves without silver, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:34">51:34</a> And submit your neck to the yoke, and let your soul receive discipline: for she is near at hand to be found. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:35">51:35</a> Behold with your eyes how I have laboured a little, and have found much rest to myself. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:36">51:36</a> Receive ye discipline as a great sum of money, and possess abundance of gold by her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:37">51:37</a> Let your soul rejoice in his mercy, and you shall not be confounded in his praise. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:38">51:38</a> Work your work before the time, and he will give you your reward in his time.</p>
