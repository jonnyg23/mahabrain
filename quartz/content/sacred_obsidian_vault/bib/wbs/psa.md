  <h3 align="center">Webster's Bible: Psalms</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in season; its leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he doeth shall prosper. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Then shall he speak to them in his wrath, and trouble them in his sore displeasure. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said to me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thy inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. LORD, how are they multiplied that trouble me? many are they that rise up against me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> Many there are who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> I cried to the LORD with my voice, and he heard me from his holy hill. Selah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me on all sides. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all my enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Salvation belongeth to the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call to him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> There are many that say, Who will show us any good? LORD, lift thou upon us the light of thy countenance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time when their corn and their wine increased. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep; for thou only, LORD, makest me dwell in safety. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> Hearken to the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for to thee will I pray. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer to thee, and will look up. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> Thou shalt destroy them that speak falsehood: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship towards thy holy temple. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness, because of my enemies; make thy way straight before my face. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favor wilt thou compass him as with a shield. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are agitated. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> My soul is also greatly disquieted: but thou, O LORD, how long? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: Oh save me for thy mercies sake. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who will give thee thanks? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> I am weary with my groaning; all the night I make my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> My eye is consumed because of grief; it groweth old because of all my enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly disquieted: let them return and be suddenly ashamed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjaminite. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there is iniquity in my hands; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me; (yes, I have delivered him that without cause is my enemy:) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yes, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay my honor in the dust. Selah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> Arise, O LORD, in thy anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of my enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> So shall the congregation of the people encompass thee: for their sakes therefore return thou on high. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity that is in me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> My defense is from God, who saveth the upright in heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> He made a pit, and digged it, and hath fallen into the ditch which he made. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David. O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thy enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> All sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatever passeth through the paths of the seas. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David. I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy wonderful works. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> When my enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou sattest on the throne judging right. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial hath perished with them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> Sing praises to the LORD, who dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer from them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> That I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> For the needy shall not always be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thy hand: forget not the humble. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> Why doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself to thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou shalt find none. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen have perished out of his land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thy ear to hear: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. In the LORD I put my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> For lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try the children of men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and a horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance beholdeth the upright. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> To the chief Musician upon Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> They speak vanity every one with his neighbor: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over me? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> Lest my enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> I will sing to the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoreth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> O my soul, thou hast said to the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take their names into my lips. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. </p>

 <p><a name="an_54:4">54:4</a> Behold, God is my helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:5">54:5</a> He will reward evil to my enemies; cut them off in thy truth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:6">54:6</a> I will freely sacrifice to thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:7">54:7</a> For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and my eye hath seen its desire upon my enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:1">55:1</a> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A Psalm of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:2">55:2</a> Attend to me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:3">55:3</a> Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:4">55:4</a> My heart is severely pained within me: and the terrors of death have fallen upon me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:5">55:5</a> Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:6">55:6</a> And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! for then I would fly away, and be at rest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:7">55:7</a> Lo, then I would wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:8">55:8</a> I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:9">55:9</a> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:10">55:10</a> Day and night they go about it upon its walls: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:11">55:11</a> Wickedness is in the midst of it: deceit and guile depart not from her streets. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:12">55:12</a> For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that magnified himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:13">55:13</a> But it was thou, a man my equal, my guide, and my acquaintance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:14">55:14</a> We took sweet counsel together, and walked to the house of God in company. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:15">55:15</a> Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:16">55:16</a> As for me, I will call upon God: and the LORD will save me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:17">55:17</a> Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he will hear my voice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:18">55:18</a> He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:19">55:19</a> God will hear and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:20">55:20</a> He hath put forth his hands against such as are at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:21">55:21</a> The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:22">55:22</a> Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he will sustain thee: he will never suffer the righteous to be moved. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:23">55:23</a> But thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:1">56:1</a> To the chief Musician upon Jonathelem-rechokim, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath. Be merciful to me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:2">56:2</a> My enemies would daily swallow me up: for they are many that fight against me, O thou Most High. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:3">56:3</a> In the time when I am afraid, I will trust in thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:4">56:4</a> In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:5">56:5</a> Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:6">56:6</a> They assemble themselves, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:7">56:7</a> Shall they escape by iniquity; in thy anger cast down the people, O God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:8">56:8</a> Thou numberest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:9">56:9</a> When I cry to thee, then shall my enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:10">56:10</a> In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:11">56:11</a> In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do to me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:12">56:12</a> Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:13">56:13</a> For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt thou not deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:1">57:1</a> To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yes, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities are overpast. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:2">57:2</a> I will cry to God most high; to God that performeth all things for me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:3">57:3</a> He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:4">57:4</a> My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. </p>

 <p><a name="an_57:6">57:6</a> They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst of which they have fallen themselves. Selah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:7">57:7</a> My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:8">57:8</a> Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:9">57:9</a> I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing to thee among the nations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:10">57:10</a> For thy mercy is great to the heavens, and thy truth to the clouds. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:11">57:11</a> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:1">58:1</a> To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David. Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:2">58:2</a> Yes, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:3">58:3</a> The wicked are estranged from their birth: they go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:4">58:4</a> Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:5">58:5</a> Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:6">58:6</a> Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:7">58:7</a> Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:8">58:8</a> As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:9">58:9</a> Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:10">58:10</a> The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:11">58:11</a> So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:1">59:1</a> To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me. </p>

 <p><a name="an_59:3">59:3</a> For lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:4">59:4</a> They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:5">59:5</a> Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah. </p>

 <p><a name="an_59:7">59:7</a> Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:8">59:8</a> But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:9">59:9</a> Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defense. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:10">59:10</a> The God of my mercy will succor me: God will let me see my desire upon my enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:11">59:11</a> Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:12">59:12</a> For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak. </p>

 <p><a name="an_59:14">59:14</a> And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go about the city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:15">59:15</a> Let them wander up and down for food, and grudge if they are not satisfied. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:16">59:16</a> But I will sing of thy power; yes, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defense and refuge in the day of my trouble. </p>

 <p><a name="an_60:1">60:1</a> To the chief Musician upon Shushan-eduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand.

 <p><a name="an_60:2">60:2</a> Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal its breaches; for it shaketh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:3">60:3</a> Thou hast shown thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:4">60:4</a> Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. </p>

 <p><a name="an_60:10">60:10</a> Wilt thou not, O God, who hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, who didst not go out with our armies? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:11">60:11</a> Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:12">60:12</a> Through God we shall do valiantly: for he will tread down our enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:1">61:1</a> To the chief Musician upon Neginah, A Psalm of David. Hear my cry, O God; attend to my prayer. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:2">61:2</a> From the end of the earth will I cry to thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. </p>

 <p><a name="an_61:4">61:4</a> I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:5">61:5</a> For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name. </p>

 <p><a name="an_62:1">62:1</a> To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David. Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. </p>

 <p><a name="an_64:5">64:5</a> They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who will see them? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:6">64:6</a> They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep. </p>

 <p><a name="an_73:24">73:24</a> Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:25">73:25</a> Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee. </p>

 <p><a name="an_73:28">73:28</a> But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:1">74:1</a> Maschil of Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thy anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:2">74:2</a> Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old: the rod of thy inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, in which thou hast dwelt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:3">74:3</a> Lift up thy feet to the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:4">74:4</a> Thy enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:5">74:5</a> A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:6">74:6</a> But now they break down the carved work of it at once with axes and hammers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:7">74:7</a> They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling-place of thy name to the ground. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:8">74:8</a> They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. </p>

 <p><a name="an_74:12">74:12</a> For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:13">74:13</a> Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou didst break the heads of the dragons in the waters. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:14">74:14</a> Thou didst break the head of leviathan in pieces, and didst give him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:15">74:15</a> Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou didst dry up mighty rivers. </p>

 <p><a name="an_74:18">74:18</a> Remember this, the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. </p>

 <p><a name="an_75:1">75:1</a> To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, A Psalm or Song of Asaph. To thee, O God, do we give thanks, to thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near, thy wondrous works declare. </p>

 <p><a name="an_75:4">75:4</a> I said to the fools, Deal not foolishly; and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:5">75:5</a> Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:6">75:6</a> For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. </p>

 <p><a name="an_75:8">75:8</a> For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs of it all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:9">75:9</a> But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. </p>

 <p><a name="an_76:8">76:8</a> Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, </p>

 <p><a name="an_76:10">76:10</a> Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath wilt thou restrain. </p>

 <p><a name="an_76:12">76:12</a> He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:1">77:1</a> To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph. I cried to God with my voice, even to God with my voice; and he gave ear to me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:2">77:2</a> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:3">77:3</a> I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:4">77:4</a> Thou holdest my eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:5">77:5</a> I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:6">77:6</a> I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with my own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:7">77:7</a> Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favorable no more? </p>

 <p><a name="an_77:10">77:10</a> And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:11">77:11</a> I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:12">77:12</a> I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:13">77:13</a> Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:14">77:14</a> Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:15">77:15</a> Thou hast with thy arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:16">77:16</a> The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were disturbed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:17">77:17</a> The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thy arrows also went abroad. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:18">77:18</a> The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:19">77:19</a> Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:20">77:20</a> Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:1">78:1</a> Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:2">78:2</a> I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:3">78:3</a> Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:4">78:4</a> We will not hide them from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:5">78:5</a> For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:6">78:6</a> That the generation to come might know them, even the children who should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:7">78:7</a> That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:8">78:8</a> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:9">78:9</a> The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:10">78:10</a> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:11">78:11</a> And forgot his works, and his wonders that he had shown them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:12">78:12</a> Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:13">78:13</a> He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as a heap. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:14">78:14</a> In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:15">78:15</a> He cleaved the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:16">78:16</a> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:17">78:17</a> And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the Most High in the wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:18">78:18</a> And they tempted God in their heart by asking food for their desire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:19">78:19</a> Yes, they spoke against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:20">78:20</a> Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:21">78:21</a> Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:22">78:22</a> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:23">78:23</a> Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:24">78:24</a> And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:25">78:25</a> Man ate angels' food: he sent them food to the full. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:26">78:26</a> He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:27">78:27</a> He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:28">78:28</a> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:29">78:29</a> So they ate, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:30">78:30</a> They were not estranged from their desire: but while their meat was yet in their mouths, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:31">78:31</a> The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:32">78:32</a> For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:33">78:33</a> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:34">78:34</a> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:35">78:35</a> And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:36">78:36</a> Nevertheless they flattered him with their mouth, and they lied to him with their tongues. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:37">78:37</a> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:38">78:38</a> But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yes, many a time he turned his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:39">78:39</a> For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:40">78:40</a> How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:41">78:41</a> Yes, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:42">78:42</a> They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:43">78:43</a> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:44">78:44</a> And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:45">78:45</a> He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:46">78:46</a> He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:47">78:47</a> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:48">78:48</a> He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:49">78:49</a> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:50">78:50</a> He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:51">78:51</a> And smote all the first-born in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:52">78:52</a> But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:53">78:53</a> And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:54">78:54</a> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:55">78:55</a> He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:56">78:56</a> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:57">78:57</a> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:58">78:58</a> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:59">78:59</a> When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:60">78:60</a> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:61">78:61</a> And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:62">78:62</a> He gave over his people also to the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:63">78:63</a> The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:64">78:64</a> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:65">78:65</a> Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:66">78:66</a> And he smote his enemies in the hinder part: he put them to a perpetual reproach. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:67">78:67</a> Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:68">78:68</a> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:69">78:69</a> And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:70">78:70</a> He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheep-folds: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:71">78:71</a> From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:72">78:72</a> So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:1">79:1</a> A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the heathen have come into thy inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:2">79:2</a> The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be food to the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints, to the beasts of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:3">79:3</a> Their blood have they shed like water around Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:4">79:4</a> We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to them that are around us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:5">79:5</a> How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:6">79:6</a> Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:7">79:7</a> For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling-place. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:8">79:8</a> O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily succor us: for we are brought very low. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:9">79:9</a> Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:10">79:10</a> Why should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by avenging the blood of thy servants which is shed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:11">79:11</a> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die; </p>

 <p><a name="an_79:13">79:13</a> So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will show forth thy praise to all generations. </p>

 <p><a name="an_105:38">105:38</a> Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:39">105:39</a> He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:40">105:40</a> The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:41">105:41</a> He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:42">105:42</a> For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:43">105:43</a> And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:44">105:44</a> And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labor of the people; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:45">105:45</a> That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:1">106:1</a> Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks to the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. </p>

 <p><a name="an_106:4">106:4</a> Remember me, O LORD, with the favor that thou bearest to thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:5">106:5</a> That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thy inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:6">106:6</a> We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:7">106:7</a> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:8">106:8</a> Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:9">106:9</a> He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:10">106:10</a> And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:11">106:11</a> And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:12">106:12</a> Then they believed his words; they sang his praise. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:13">106:13</a> They soon forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:14">106:14</a> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:15">106:15</a> And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:16">106:16</a> They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:17">106:17</a> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:18">106:18</a> And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:19">106:19</a> They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped the molten image. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:20">106:20</a> Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:21">106:21</a> They forgot God their savior, who had done great things in Egypt; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:22">106:22</a> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:23">106:23</a> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:24">106:24</a> Yes, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:25">106:25</a> But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not to the voice of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:26">106:26</a> Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:27">106:27</a> To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:28">106:28</a> They joined themselves also to Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:29">106:29</a> Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague broke in upon them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:30">106:30</a> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:31">106:31</a> And that was counted to him for righteousness to all generations for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:32">106:32</a> They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:33">106:33</a> Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:34">106:34</a> They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:35">106:35</a> But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:36">106:36</a> And they served their idols: which were a snare to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:37">106:37</a> Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:38">106:38</a> And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:39">106:39</a> Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went astray with their own inventions. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:40">106:40</a> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:41">106:41</a> And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:42">106:42</a> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:43">106:43</a> Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel; and were brought low for their iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:44">106:44</a> Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: </p>
