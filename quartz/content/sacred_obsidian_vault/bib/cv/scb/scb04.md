 <p align="center">CHRIST IS EQUAL WITH GOD.</p>  
 <p>I and my Father are <i>one</i>. (John 10:30.)</p>  
 <p>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be <i>equal with God</i>. (Phil. 2:5.)</p>  
 <p align="center">CHRIST IS <b>NOT</b> EQUAL WITH GOD.</p>  
 <p>My father is <i>greater</i> than I. (John 14:28.)</p>  
 <p>Of that day and hour knoweth no man, not the angels of heaven, but my <i>Father only</i>. (Matt. 24:36.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_109">109</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">JESUS WAS ALL-POWERFUL</p>  
 <p><i>All power</i> is given unto me in heaven and in earth. (Matt. 28:18.)</p>  
 <p>The Father loveth the Son and hath given <i>all things</i> into his hand. (John 3:35.)</p>  
 <p align="center">JESUS WAS <b>NOT</b> ALL-POWERFUL.</p>  
 <p>And <i>he could there do no mighty work</i>, save that he laid his hands on a few sick folk and healed them. (Mark 6:5.)</p>

 <p align="center"><a name="an_110">110</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">THE LAW WAS SUPERSEDED BY THE CHRISTIAN DISPENSATION.</p>  
 <p>The law and the prophets were <i>until</i> John; since that time the <i>kingdom of God</i> is preached. (Luke 16:16.)</p>  
 <p>Having <i>abolished</i> in the flesh the enmity, even the <i>law of commandments</i> contained in <i>ordinances</i>. (Eph. 2:15.)</p>  
 <p>But now we are <i>delivered from the law</i>. (Rom. 7:6.)</p>  
 <p align="center">THE LAW WAS <b>NOT</b> SUPERSEDED BY THE CHRISTIAN DISPENSATION.</p>  
 <p>I am come <i>not to destroy the law</i> but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one <i>jot</i> or one <i>tittle</i> shall in <i>no wise pass from the law</i> till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of the <i>least commandments</i> and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. (Matt. 5:17, 18, 19.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_111">111</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHRIST'S MISSION WAS PEACE.</p>  
 <p>And suddenly there was with the angels a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and <i>on earth</i> peace. (Luke 2:13, 14.)</p>  
 <p align="center">CHRIST'S MISSION WAS <b>NOT</b> PEACE.</p>  
 <p><i>Think not</i> that I am come to send <i>peace on earth;</i> I <i>came not to send peace</i>, but a sword. (Matt. 10:34.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_112">112</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHRIST RECEIVED NOT TESTIMONY FROM MAN.</p>  
 <p>Ye sent unto John and he bare witness unto the truth. But I receive not <i>testimony from man</i>. (John 5:33, 34.)</p>  
 <p align="center">CHRIST <b>DID</b> RECEIVE TESTIMONY FROM MAN.</p>  
 <p>And ye shall also <i>bear witness</i>, because ye have been <i>with me</i> from the beginning. (John 15:27.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_113">113</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHRIST'S WITNESS OF HIMSELF IS TRUE.</p>  
 <p>I am one that bear witness of myself. . . . Though I bear record of myself, yet <i>my record is true</i>. (John 8:18, 14.)</p>  
 <p align="center">CHRIST'S WITNESS OF HIMSELF IS <b>NOT</b> TRUE.</p>  
 <p>If I bear witness of myself, <i>my witness is not true</i>. (John 5:31.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_114">114</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHRIST LAID DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS FRIENDS.</p>  
 <p>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man <i>lay down his life for his friends</i>. (John 15:13.)</p>  
 <p>The good <i>shepherd</i> giveth his life for the <i>sheep</i>. (John 10:11.)</p>  
 <p align="center">CHRIST LAID DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS <b>ENEMIES</b>.</p>  
 <p>When we were <i>enemies</i>, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son. (Rom. 5:10.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_115">115</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">IT WAS LAWFUL FOR THE JEWS TO PUT CHRIST TO DEATH.</p>  
 <p>The Jews answered him, We have a <i>law</i>, and by our law he <i>ought to die</i>. (John 19:7.)</p>  
 <p align="center">IT WAS <b>NOT</b> LAWFUL FOR THE JEWS TO PUT HIM TO DEATH.</p>  
 <p>The Jews therefore said unto him, It is <i>not lawful</i> for us to put <i>any man to death</i>. (John 18:31.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_116">116</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHILDREN ARE PUNISHED FOR THE SINS OF THEIR PARENTS.</p>  
 <p>I am a jealous God, <i>visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children</i>. (Ex. 20:5.)</p>  
 <p align="center">CHILDREN ARE <b>NOT</b> PUNISHED FOR THE SINS OF THEIR PARENTS.</p>  
 <p>The <i>son</i> shall <i>not</i> bear the iniquities of the <i>father</i>. (Ezek. 18:20.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_117">117</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">MAN IS JUSTIFIED BY FAITH ALONE.</p>  
 <p>By the deeds of the <i>law</i> there shall <i>no flesh be justified</i>. (Rom. 3:20.)</p>  
 <p>Knowing that a man is <i>not justified by the works of the law</i>, but by the faith of Jesus Christ. (Gal. 2:16.)</p>  
 <p>The <i>just</i> shall live by faith. And the <i>law</i> is <i>not</i> of faith. (Gal. 3:11, 12.)</p>  
 <p>For <i>if</i> Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory. (Rom. 4:2.)</p>  
 <p align="center">MAN IS <b>NOT</b> JUSTIFIED BY FAITH ALONE.</p>  
 <p>Was not Abraham our father <i>justified by works?</i> . . . Ye see then how that <i>by works a man is justified, and not by faith only</i>. (James 2:21, 24.)</p>  
 <p>The doers of the <i>law</i> shall be justified. (Rom. 2:13.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_118">118</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FALL FROM GRACE.</p>  
 <p>And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall <i>never perish</i>, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand. (John 10:28.)</p>  
 <p>Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other creature, shall <i>be able to separate us</i> from the love of God which is in Christ our Lord. (Rom. 8:38, 39.)</p>  
 <p align="center">IT <b>IS</b> POSSIBLE TO FALL FROM GRACE.</p>  
 <p>But when the <i>righteous</i> man <i>turneth</i><i> away</i> from his righteousness, and <i>committeth</i><i> iniquity</i>, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he <i>live?</i> All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned; in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die. (Ezek. 18:24.)</p>  
 <p>For it is possible for those who were <i>once enlightened</i>, and have <i>tasted</i> of the <i>heavenly gift</i>, and are made <i>partakers</i> of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, and have tasted the good <i>word of God</i>, and the powers of the world to come, if they <i>shall fall away</i>, to <i>renew</i> them <i>again</i> unto repentance. (Heb. 6:4, 5, 6.)</p>  
 <p>For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are <i>again entangled therein and overcome</i>, the latter end is worse than the beginning. For it had been better for them <i>not to have known</i> the way of righteousness, than after they had known it, to <i>turn from the holy commandment</i> delivered unto them. (2 Pet. 2:20, 21.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_119">119</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">NO MAN IS WITHOUT SIN.</p>  
 <p>For there is <i>no</i> man that <i>sinneth</i><i> not</i>. (1 Kings 8:46.)</p>  
 <p>Who can say, I have made my heart <i>clean;</i> I am <i>pure</i> from my <i>sin?</i> (Prov. 20:9.)</p>  
 <p>For there is <i>not a just man</i> upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not. (Eccl. 7:20.)</p>  
 <p>There is <i>none</i> righteous, no, not one. (Rom. 3:10.)</p>  
 <p align="center">CHRISTIANS ARE <b>SINLESS</b>.</p>  
 <p>Whosoever is born of God <i>doth not commit sin;</i> . . . he <i>cannot sin</i>, because he is born of God. . . . Whosoever abideth in him <i>sinneth</i><i> not</i>. He that committeth sin is of the devil. (1 John 3:9, 6, 8.)</p>

 <p align="center"><a name="an_120">120</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">THERE IS TO BE A RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD.</p>  
 <p>The trumpet shall sound and the <i>dead</i> shall be <i>raised</i>. (1 Cor. 15:52.)</p>  
 <p>And I saw the <i>dead</i>, small and great, stand before God; . . . and they were judged, every man according to their works. (Rev. 20:12, 13.)</p>  
 <p>Now that the <i>dead are raised</i> even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. (Luke 20:37.)</p>  
 <p>For if the dead <i>rise</i> not, then is not Christ raised. (1 Cor. 15:16.)</p>  
 <p align="center">THERE IS TO BE <b>NO</b> RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD.</p>  
 <p>As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, so he that goeth down to the grave shall <i>come up no more</i>. (Job 7:9.)</p>  
 <p>The dead <i>know not anything</i>, neither have they any more a reward. (Eccl. 9:5.)</p>  
 <p>They are dead, they <i>shall not live;</i> they are deceased they <i>shall not rise</i>. (Is. 26:14.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_121">121</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">REWARD AND PUNISHMENT TO BE BESTOWED IN THIS WORLD.</p>  
 <p>Behold the righteous shall be <i>recompensed</i> in the earth, much more the <i>wicked</i> and the <i>sinner</i>. (Prov. 11:31.)</p>  
 <p align="center">REWARD AND PUNISHMENT TO BE BESTOWED IN THE <b>NEXT</b> WORLD.</p>  
 <p>And the <i>dead were judged</i> out of those things which were written in the books, <i>according</i> to their <i>works</i>. (Rev. 20:12.)</p>  
 <p><i>Then</i> he shall <i>reward</i> every man according to his works. (Matt. 16:27.)</p>  
 <p><i>According</i> to that he hath <i>done</i>, whether it be <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i>. (2 Cor. 5:10.)</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_122">122</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">ANNIHILATION THE PORTION OF ALL MANKIND.</p>  
 <p>Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? . . . For now should I have <i>lain still</i> and <i>been quiet;</i> I should have <i>slept;</i> then had I been at <i>rest</i>, with kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves; or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver; or as a <i>hidden, untimely birth</i> I had not been; as <i>infants</i> which <i>never saw light</i>. THERE the wicked <i>cease from troubling</i>, and there the weary be <i>at rest</i>. . . . The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master. Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and <i>life</i> unto the bitter in soul, which long for <i>death</i> and it cometh not, . . . which rejoice exceedingly when they have found the <i>grave?</i> (Job 3:11, 13-17, 19, 20, 21, 22.)</p>  
 <p><i>The dead know not anything</i>. . . . For there is no work, nor device, nor <i>knowledge</i>, nor <i>wisdom</i> in the grave whither thou goest. (Eccl. 9:5, 10.)</p>  
 <p>For that which befalleth the sons of <i>men</i> befalleth the <i>beasts</i>, even <i>one thing</i> befalleth them; as the <i>one</i> dieth, so dieth the <i>other;</i> yea, they have <i>all one breath;</i> so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast. . . . All go unto <i>one place</i>. (Eccl. 3:19, 20.)</p>  
 <p align="center"><b>ENDLESS MISERY</b> THE PORTION OF A <b>PART</b> OF MANKIND.</p>  
 <p>These shall go away unto <i>everlasting punishment</i>. (Matt. 25:46.)</p>  
 <p>And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be <i>tormented day and night for ever and ever</i>. . . . And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. (Rev. 20:10, 15.)</p>  
 <p>And the smoke of their <i>torment</i> ascendeth up <i>forever</i> and ever. (Rev. 14:11.)</p>  
 <p>And many of them that sleep in the dust shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and <i>everlasting contempt</i>. (Dan. 12:2.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_123">123</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">THE EARTH IS TO BE DESTROYED.</p>  
 <p>The earth also and the works that are therein shall be <i>burned up</i>. (2 Pet. 3:10.)</p>  
 <p><i>They shall perish</i>, but thou remainest. (Heb. 1:11.)</p>  
 <p>And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the <i>earth</i> and the heaven <i>fled away</i>, and there was <i>no place</i> found for them. (Rev. 20:11.)</p>  
 <p align="center">THE EARTH IS <b>NEVER</b> TO BE DESTROYED.</p>  
 <p>Who laid the foundations of the <i>earth</i> that it <i>should not be removed forever</i>. (Ps. 104:5.)</p>  
 <p>But the <i>earth abideth forever</i>. (Eccl. 1:4.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_124">124</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">NO EVIL SHALL HAPPEN TO THE GODLY.</p>  
 <p>There shall no evil happen to the just. (Prov. 12:21.) Who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? (1 Pet. 3:13.)</p>  
 <p align="center">EVIL <b>DOES</b> HAPPEN TO THE GODLY.</p>  
 <p>Whom the Lord loveth he <i>chasteneth</i>, and <i>scourgeth</i> every <i>son</i> whom he receiveth. (Heb. 12:6.)</p>  
 <p>And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him, a <i>perfect</i> and an <i>upright</i> man? . . . So went Satan forth . . . and <i>smote</i> Job with <i>sore boils</i> from the sole of his foot unto the crown of his head. (Job 2:3, 7.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_125">125</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">WORLDLY GOOD AND PROSPERITY ARE THE LOT OF THE GODLY.</p>  
 <p>There shall <i>no evil</i> happen to the <i>just</i>. (Prov. 12:21.)</p>  
 <p>For the Lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his <i>saints;</i> they are <i>preserved forever</i>. . . . The wicked watcheth for the righteous and seeketh to slay him. The Lord <i>will not leave him</i> in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. . . . Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the <i>end</i> of that man is peace. (Ps. 37:28, 32, 33, 37.)</p>  
 <p>Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly. . . . <i>Whatsoever he doeth shall prosper</i>. (Ps. 1:1, 3.)</p>  
 <p>And the Lord was with <i>Joseph</i>, and he was a <i>prosperous</i> man. (Gen. 39:2.)</p>  
 <p>So the Lord <i>blessed the latter end of Job</i> more than the beginning. (Job. 42:12.)</p>  
 <p align="center">WORLDLY <b>MISERY AND DESTITUTION</b> THE LOT OF THE GODLY.</p>  
 <p>They were <i>stoned</i>, they were <i>sawn asunder</i>, were <i>tempted</i>, were <i>slain</i> with the <i>sword;</i> they wandered about in sheepskins and goat-skins; being <i>destitute</i>, <i>afflicted</i>, <i>tormented;</i> . . . they wandered in <i>deserts</i>, and in <i>mountains</i>, and in <i>dens</i> and <i>caves</i> of the earth. (Heb. 11:37, 38.)</p>  
 <p>These are they which came out of <i>great tribulation</i>. (Rev. 7:14.)</p>  
 <p>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall <i>suffer persecution</i>. (2 Tim. 3:12.)</p>  
 <p>And ye shall be <i>hated of all men</i> for my name's sake. (Luke 21:17.)</p>

 <p align="center">WORLDLY PROSPERITY A REWARD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND A BLESSING.</p>  
 <p>There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake and the gospel's, but he shall receive a <i>hundred fold now in this time, houses</i>, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and <i>lands</i>. (Mark 10:29, 30.)</p>  
 <p>I have been young, and now am old; yet have I <i>not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread</i>. (Ps. 37:25.)</p>  
 <p>Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord. . . . <i>Wealth</i> and <i>riches</i> shall be in his <i>house</i>. (Ps. 112:1, 3.)</p>  
 <p>If thou return unto the Almighty, thou shalt be built up. . . . Then shalt thou <i>lay up gold as dust</i>. (Job. 22:23, 24.)</p>  
 <p>In the house of the righteous is <i>much treasure</i>. (Prov. 15:6.)</p>  
 <p align="center">WORLDLY PROSPERITY A <b>CURSE</b> AND A <b>BAR TO FUTURE REWARD</b>.</p>  
 <p>Blessed be ye <i>poor</i>. (Luke 6:20.)</p>  
 <p><i>Lay not up</i> for yourselves treasures upon earth. . . . For where your treasure is there will your heart be also. (Matt. 6:19, 21.)</p>  
 <p>And it came to pass that the <i>beggar died</i>, and was carried by the angels into <i>Abraham's bosom</i>. (Luke 16:22.)</p>  
 <p>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a <i>rich</i> man to <i>enter into the kingdom of God</i>. (Matt. 19:24.)</p>  
 <p><i>Woe</i> unto you that are <i>rich!</i> for ye have received your consolation. (Luke 6:24.)</p>

 <p align="center">THE CHRISTIAN YOKE IS <b>NOT</b> EASY.</p>  
 <p>In the world ye <i>shall have tribulation</i>. (John 16:33.)</p>  
 <p>Yea, and ALL that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer <i>persecution</i>. (2 Tim. 3:12.)</p>  
 <p>Whom the Lord loveth he <i>chasteneth</i>, and <i>scourgeth</i> every son whom he receiveth . . . . For if ye be <i>without</i> chastisement then are ye <i>bastards</i> and not sons. (Heb. 12:6, 8.)</p>

 <p align="center">THE FRUIT OF GOD'S SPIRIT IS LOVE AND GENTLENESS.</p>  
 <p>The fruit of the spirit is <i>love</i>, <i>peace</i>, <i>joy</i>, <i>gentleness</i>, and <i>goodness</i>. (Gal. 5:22.)</p>  
 <p align="center">THE FRUIT OF GOD'S SPIRIT IS <b>VENGEANCE</b> AND <b>FURY</b>.</p>  
 <p>And the spirit of the Lord came upon him and he <i>slew a thousand men</i>. (Judg. 15:14.)</p>  
 <p>And it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit <i>from God</i> came upon Saul. . . and there was a javelin in Saul's hand. And Saul <i>cast the javelin;</i> for he said, I will <i>smite David</i> even to the wall with it. (1 Sam. 18:10, 11.)</p>

 <p align="center">LONGEVITY ENJOYED BY THE WICKED.</p>  
 <p>Wherefore do the wicked live, <i>become old</i>, yea, are mighty in power? Their <i>seed</i> is established <i>in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes</i>. (Job 21:7, 8.)</p>  
 <p>They [men of the world] are <i>full of children</i> and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. (Ps. 17:14.)</p>

 <p align="center"><b>RICHES</b> A BLESSING.</p>  
 <p>The rich man's <i>wealth</i> is his <i>strong tower</i>, but the destruction of the poor is their poverty. (Prov. 10:15.)</p>

 <p>And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than the beginning, for he had 14,000 sheep, and 6,000 camels, and a <i>thousand</i> yoke of oxen, and a <i>thousand</i> she asses. (Job 42:12.)</p>  
 <p align="center"><b>NEITHER</b> POVERTY <b>NOR</b> RICHES A BLESSING.</p>

 <p align="center">WISDOM A SOURCE OF <b>VEXATION,</b> <b>GRIEF,</b> AND <b>SORROW</b>.</p>
