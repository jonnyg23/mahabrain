 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 33</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> If when he seeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> come, and take him away, his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall be upon his own head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But if the watchman see the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> will I require at the watchman's hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> will I require at thine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> in the day that he sinneth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, and do that which is lawful and right;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> If the wicked restore the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a>, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> When the righteous turneth from his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, I will <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> you every one after his ways.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> speak, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>: and shall ye possess the land?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Ye stand upon your <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, ye work <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a>, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> hath been among them.<br>
