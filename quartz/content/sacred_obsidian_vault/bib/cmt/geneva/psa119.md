 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_053">psa 119:53</a></font></span></p>(d) Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, a vehement zeal to your glory and indignation against the wicked.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#054">Psalms 119:54</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_054">psa 119:54</a></font></span></p>Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my (e) pilgrimage. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) In the course of this life and sorrowful exit.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#055">Psalms 119:55</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_055">psa 119:55</a></font></span></p>I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the (f) night, and have kept thy law. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Even when others sleep.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#056">Psalms 119:56</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_056">psa 119:56</a></font></span></p>(g) This I had, because I kept thy precepts. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) That is, all these benefits.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#057">Psalms 119:57</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_057">psa 119:57</a></font></span></p>CHETH. [Thou art] my (a) portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) I am persuaded that to keep your law is a heritage and great gain for me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#059">Psalms 119:59</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_059">psa 119:59</a></font></span></p>I thought on my (b) ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) He shows that no one can embrace the word of God, unless he considers his own imperfections and ways.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#061">Psalms 119:61</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_061">psa 119:61</a></font></span></p>The bands of the wicked have (c) robbed me: [but] I have not forgotten thy law. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) They have gone about to draw me into their company.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#063">Psalms 119:63</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_063">psa 119:63</a></font></span></p>I [am] a (d) companion of all [them] that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Not only in mutual consent, but also with aid and help.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#064">Psalms 119:64</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_064">psa 119:64</a></font></span></p>The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: (e) teach me thy statutes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) For the knowledge of God's word is a singular token of his favour.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#065">Psalms 119:65</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_065">psa 119:65</a></font></span></p>TETH. Thou hast dealt (a) well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Having proved by experience that God was true in his promise, he desires that he would increase in him knowledge and judgment.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#067">Psalms 119:67</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_067">psa 119:67</a></font></span></p>Before I was (b) afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) So Jeremiah says, that before the Lord touched him, he was like a calf untamed so that the use of God's rod is to call us home to God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#070">Psalms 119:70</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_070">psa 119:70</a></font></span></p>(c) Their heart is as fat as grease; [but] I delight in thy law. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Their heart is indurate and hardened, puffed up with prosperity and vain estimation of themselves.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#071">Psalms 119:71</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_071">psa 119:71</a></font></span></p>[It is] (d) good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He confesses that before he was chastened he was rebellious as man by nature is.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#073">Psalms 119:73</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_073">psa 119:73</a></font></span></p>JOD. Thy hands have (a) made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Because God does not leave his work that he has begun, he desires a new grace: that is, that he would continue his mercies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#074">Psalms 119:74</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_074">psa 119:74</a></font></span></p>They that (b) fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) When God shows his grace toward any, he testifies to others that he does not fail them who trust in him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#077">Psalms 119:77</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_077">psa 119:77</a></font></span></p>Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may (c) live: for thy law [is] my delight. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He declares that when he did not feel God's mercies, he was as dead.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#079">Psalms 119:79</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_079">psa 119:79</a></font></span></p>Let those that fear thee (d) turn unto me, and those that have (e) known thy testimonies. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, be comforted by my example. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) He shows that there can be no true fear of God without the knowledge of his word.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#081">Psalms 119:81</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_081">psa 119:81</a></font></span></p>CAPH. My soul (a) fainteth for thy salvation: [but] I hope in thy word. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Though my strength fails me, yet my soul groans and sighs, resting still in your word.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#083">Psalms 119:83</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_083">psa 119:83</a></font></span></p>For I am become like a (b) bottle in the smoke; [yet] do I not forget thy statutes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Like a skin bottle or bladder that is parched in the smoke.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#084">Psalms 119:84</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_084">psa 119:84</a></font></span></p>How many [are] the (c) days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) How long will you afflict your servant.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#085">Psalms 119:85</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_085">psa 119:85</a></font></span></p>The proud have (d) digged pits for me, which [are] not after thy law. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) They have not only oppressed me violently but also craftily conspired against me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#086">Psalms 119:86</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_086">psa 119:86</a></font></span></p>All thy commandments [are] faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; (e) help thou me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He assures himself that God will deliver his and destroy such as unjustly persecute them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#087">Psalms 119:87</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_087">psa 119:87</a></font></span></p>They had almost consumed (f) me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Finding no help on earth, he lifts up his eyes to heaven.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#089">Psalms 119:89</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_089">psa 119:89</a></font></span></p>LAMED. For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in (a) heaven. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Because no one should esteem God's word according to the changes of things in this world, he shows that it abides in heaven, and therefore is immutable.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#091">Psalms 119:91</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_091">psa 119:91</a></font></span></p>They (b) continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all [are] thy servants. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Seeing the earth and all creatures remain in that estate in which you have created them, much more your truth remains constant and unchangeable.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#094">Psalms 119:94</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_094">psa 119:94</a></font></span></p>I [am] (c) thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He proves by effect that he is God's child, because he seeks to understand his word.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#096">Psalms 119:96</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_096">psa 119:96</a></font></span></p>I (d) have seen an end of all perfection: [but] thy commandment [is] exceeding broad. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) There is nothing so perfect in earth, but it has an end, only God's word lasts forever.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#097">Psalms 119:97</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_097">psa 119:97</a></font></span></p>MEM. O how love I thy law! it [is] my meditation (a) all the day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He shows that we cannot love God's word unless we exercise ourselves in it and practise it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#099">Psalms 119:99</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_099">psa 119:99</a></font></span></p>I have more (b) understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies [are] my meditation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Whoever submits himself only to God's word will not only be safe against the practises of his enemies, but also learn more wisdom than they who profess it, and are men of experience.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#102">Psalms 119:102</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_102">psa 119:102</a></font></span></p>I have not departed from thy judgments: for (c) thou hast taught me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) So then of ourselves we can do nothing, but when God inwardly instructs us with his spirit, we feel his graces sweeter than honey.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105">Psalms 119:105</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_105">psa 119:105</a></font></span></p>NUN. Thy word [is] a (a) lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Of ourselves we are but darkness and cannot see unless we are lightened with God's Word.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#106">Psalms 119:106</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_106">psa 119:106</a></font></span></p>I have (b) sworn, and I will perform [it], that I will keep thy righteous judgments. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) So all the faithful ought to bind themselves to God by a solemn oath and promises to stir up their zeal to embrace God's word.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#108">Psalms 119:108</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, my prayer and thanksgiving which Hosea calls the calves of the lips, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002">Hos 14:2</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#109">Psalms 119:109</a></p>
