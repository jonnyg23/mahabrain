 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001">Ezekiel 1:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">eze 1:1</a></font></span></p>Now it came to pass in the (a) thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I [was] among the captives by the river of (b) Chebar, [that] the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of (c) God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>The Argument - After Jehoiachin by the counsel of Jeremiah and Ezekiel had yielded himself to Nebuchadnezzar, and so went into captivity with his mother and various of his princes and of the people, some began to repent and murmur that they had obeyed the prophet's counsel, as though the things which they had prophesied would not come to pass, and therefore their estate would still be miserable under the Chaldeans. By reason of which he confirms his former prophecies, declaring by new visions and revelations shown to him, that the city would most certainly be destroyed, and the people grievously tormented by God's plagues, in so much that they who remained would be brought into cruel bondage. Lest the godly despair in these great troubles, he assures them that God will deliver his church at his appointed time and also destroy their enemies, who either afflicted them, or rejoiced in their miseries. The effect of the one and the other would be chiefly performed under Christ, of whom in this book are many notable promises, and in whom the glory of the new temple would perfectly be restored. He prophesied these things in Chaldea, at the same time that Jeremiah prophesied in Judah, and there began in the fifth year of Jehoiachin's captivity. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) After that the book of the Law as found, which was the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah, so that twenty-five years after this book was found, Jeconiah was led away captive with Ezekiel and many of the people, who the first year later saw these visions. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Which was a part of Euphrates so called. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, notable and excellent visions, so that it might be known, it was no natural dream but came from God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003">Ezekiel 1:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">eze 1:3</a></font></span></p>The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the (d) hand of the LORD was there upon him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, the spirit of prophecy, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022">Eze 3:22</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001">Eze 37:1</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">eze 1:4</a></font></span></p>And I looked, and, behold, a (e) whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness [was] about it, and from the midst of it as the colour of amber, from the midst of the fire. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) By this diversity of words he signifies the fearful judgment of God and the great afflictions that would come on Jerusalem.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005">Ezekiel 1:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">eze 1:5</a></font></span></p>Also from the midst of it [came] the likeness of (f) four living beings. And this [was] their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Which were the four Cherubims that represented the glory of God, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#022">Eze 11:22</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">eze 1:10</a></font></span></p>As for the likeness of their faces, they four had (h) the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Every cherubim had four faces, the face of a man, and of a lion on the right side, and the face of a bullock and of an eagle on the left side.

 <p>
 </p><p>(i) That is, when they had executed God's will: for before they returned not till God had changed the state of things.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#016">Ezekiel 1:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">eze 1:16</a></font></span></p>The appearance of the wheels and their work [was] like the colour of a (k) beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work [was] as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) The Hebrew word is tarshish meaning that the colour was like the Cilician Sea, or a precious stone so called.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#024">Ezekiel 1:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">eze 1:24</a></font></span></p>And when they went, I heard the noise of their (l) wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they (m) let down their wings. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Which declared the swiftness and the fearfulness of God's judgments. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(m) Which signified that they had no power of themselves, but only waited to execute God's commandment.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#027">Ezekiel 1:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">eze 1:27</a></font></span></p>And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire (n) around within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness on all sides. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) By which was signified a terrible judgment toward the earth.

 <p>
 </p><p>(o) Considering the majesty of God, and the weakness of flesh.
