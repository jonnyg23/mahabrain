 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Geneva Bible Translation Notes</i>, [1599], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001">Matthew Chapter 17</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001">Matthew 17:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mat 17:1</a></font></span></p>And (1) (a) after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) Christ in his present company is humble in the gospel, but all the while he is Lord both of heaven and earth. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) Luke counts eight days, containing in that number the first and last, and Matthew speaks but of the days between them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002">Matthew 17:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">mat 17:2</a></font></span></p>And was (b) transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Changed into another colour.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005">Matthew 17:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">mat 17:5</a></font></span></p>While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is (c) my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) The word "my" distinguishes Christ from other children. For he is God's natural son, we by adoption; therefore he is called the first begotten among the brethren, because although he is by right the only son, yet he is chief among many, in that he is the source and head of the adoption.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#006">Matthew 17:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">mat 17:6</a></font></span></p>And when the disciples heard [it], they (d) fell on their face, and were sore afraid. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Fell down flat on their faces and worshipped him, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#011">Mat 2:11</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#009">Matthew 17:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">mat 17:9</a></font></span></p>And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the (e) vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Which they saw, otherwise the word used in this place is usually used in referring to that which is seen in a dream.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#014">Matthew 17:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">mat 17:14</a></font></span></p>(2) And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a [certain] man, (f) kneeling down to him, and saying, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) Men are unworthy of Christ's goodness, yet nonetheless he pays attention to them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) As men used to do when making supplication.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#015">Matthew 17:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">mat 17:15</a></font></span></p>Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is (g) lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) They that at certain times of the moon are troubled with the falling sickness, or any other kind of disease: but in this case, we must so understand it, that besides the natural disease he had a demonic derangement.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#019">Matthew 17:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">mat 17:19</a></font></span></p>(3) Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) Incredulity and distrust hinder and break the direction of God's benefits.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#021">Matthew 17:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">mat 17:21</a></font></span></p>(4) Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by (h) prayer and fasting. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) The remedy against distrust. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(h) To help us to understand the watchfulness and diligence of earnest prayer, which cannot be without sobriety.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022">Matthew 17:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">mat 17:22</a></font></span></p>(5) And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(5) Our minds must be prepared more and more for the offence of the cross.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#024">Matthew 17:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">mat 17:24</a></font></span></p>(6) And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute [money] came to Peter, and said, Doth (i) not your master (k) pay (l) tribute? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(6) In that Christ willingly obeys Caesar's edicts, he shows that civil policy is not taken away by the Gospel. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) He does not deny, but he asks. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) Should he not pay? 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(l) They that were from twenty years of age to fifty, paid half a shekel to the Sanctuary, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013">Exo 30:13</a>). This was an Attic didrachma which the Roman exacted after they had subdued Judea.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#025">Matthew 17:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">mat 17:25</a></font></span></p>He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own (m) children, or of strangers? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) By children we must not understand subjects who pay tribute, but natural children.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#027">Matthew 17:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">mat 17:27</a></font></span></p>Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a (n) piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) The word used here is "stater", which is in value four didrachmas; every drachma is about five pence.
