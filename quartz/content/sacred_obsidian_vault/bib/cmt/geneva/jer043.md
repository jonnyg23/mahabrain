 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#002">Jeremiah 43:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jer 43:2</a></font></span></p>Then spoke (a) Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the (b) proud men, saying to Jeremiah, (c) Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath (d) not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Who was also called Jezaniah, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001">Jer 42:1</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) This declares that pride is the cause of rebellion and contempt of God's ministers. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) When the hypocrisy of the wicked is discovered, they burst forth into open rage: for they can abide nothing but flattery, read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010">Isa 30:10</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) He shows what is the nature of the hypocrites: that is, to pretend that they would obey God and embrace his word, if they were assured that his messenger spoke the truth: though indeed they are most far from all obedience.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#003">Jeremiah 43:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jer 43:3</a></font></span></p>But Baruch the son of Neriah (e) setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Thus the wicked not only contemn and hurt the messengers of God, but slander and speak wickedly of all them that support or favour the godly.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#005">Jeremiah 43:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jer 43:5</a></font></span></p>But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that had returned from all (f) nations, where they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) As from the Moabites, Ammonites and Edomites, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#011">Jer 40:11</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#006">Jeremiah 43:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jer 43:6</a></font></span></p>[Even] men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the (g) prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) When these wicked lead away by force.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007">Jeremiah 43:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jer 43:7</a></font></span></p>So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus they came [even] to (h) Tahpanhes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) A city in Egypt near to Nilus.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#009">Jeremiah 43:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jer 43:9</a></font></span></p>Take great stones in thy hand, and (i) hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which [is] at the entrance of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Which signified that Nebuchadnezzar would come even to the gates of Pharaoh, where his brick kilns for his buildings were.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010">Jeremiah 43:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jer 43:10</a></font></span></p>And say to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, (k) my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009">Jer 25:9</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#011">Jeremiah 43:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jer 43:11</a></font></span></p>And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, [and deliver] (l) such [as are] for death to death; and such [as are] for captivity to captivity; and such [as are] for the sword to the sword. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Everyone will be slain by the means that God has appointed, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002">Jer 15:2</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#012">Jeremiah 43:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jer 43:12</a></font></span></p>And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a (m) shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from there in peace. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Meaning most easily and suddenly will he carry the Egyptians away.
