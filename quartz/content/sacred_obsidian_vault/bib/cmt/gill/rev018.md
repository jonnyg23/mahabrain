 <p>
 </p><p>This chapter gives an account of the fall of Babylon, and of the lamentation of many, and of the joy of others, by reason of it; which account is published by several angels: the first that declares her fall is described by his original, descending from heaven; by the great power he had; by his resplendent glory, and by his mighty cry in publishing her destruction; which is illustrated by the desolate condition she will be in upon her fall; the reasons of which are given, became the nations and kings of the earth had committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth were enriched by her luxury, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#001">Rev 18:1</a>. Another voice is heard from heaven, calling upon the people of God, first to come out of her, lest partaking of her sins they should share in her plagues, seeing her iniquities had reached to heaven, and were remembered before God; and next to take full vengeance on her, because she had glorified herself, lived deliciously, and in great security, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004">Rev 18:4</a>. And then follows a continuation of the account of her destruction, what her plagues would be, death, mourning, famine, and fire; and which would be sudden, in one hour, and certain, from the power and justice of God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008">Rev 18:8</a>. Next follow the lamentations of the kings, merchants, and masters of ships, because of her greatness, riches, and merchandise, which are all come to nothing, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009">Rev 18:9</a>. And then the church; the saints, apostles, and prophets, are called upon to rejoice at the vengeance taken on her, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020">Rev 18:20</a> upon which a mighty angel appears, who by an action signifies the manner of her destruction, and the irrecoverableness of her state and condition, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021">Rev 18:21</a> and declares her utter ruin, by affirming that nothing that was either delightful or profitable, or necessary or comfortable, should any more be found in her; giving the reasons of it, because of her luxury, idolatry, and bloodshed, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#022">Rev 18:22</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#001">Revelation 18:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">rev 18:1</a></font></span></p>And after these things,.... The vision of the woman on the scarlet coloured beast, and the interpretation of both by the angel: 
 <p>
 </p><p>I saw another angel; not the Lord Jesus Christ, though the several things said of this angel agree with him; nor one of the ministering spirits, though the characters of him will also suit with one of them, but rather a minister of the Gospel, or a set of Gospel ministers, who will arise a little before the downfall of Babylon, in the spiritual reign of Christ; though not the same with the angel of fire, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#018">Rev 14:18</a> as some have thought, because of his illustrious appearance, and the loudness of his voice; but the same with the angel, or third thundering voice in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006">Rev 14:6</a> for not only the times of both agree, but the selfsame words are expressed by one as by the other; and this angel is distinct from him that showed John the preceding vision, and gave him the interpretation of it, and from all the seven angels that had the vials, and is described as follows: and first by the place from whence he came, John saw him 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>come down from heaven; denoting the suddenness of his appearance and cry; he came down at once, and cried out immediately; the subject of his cry, the destruction of Babylon, being what will be at an unawares; and also the commission and authority of the ministers signified by him, who will have their warrant from heaven to say what they will deliver; so that this likewise expresses the truth of their message, since both that and they come from heaven: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>having great power; to do great work, to declare the fall of Babylon the great: or "having great authority"; being sent from the King of kings, in his name, as his ambassador, to proclaim what shortly will come to pass; an event of the greatest importance to the glory of God, the interest of Christ, and the comfort of his people: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the earth was lightened with his glory; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002">Eze 43:2</a> by which is meant the glorious Gospel of Christ, the light of which will at this then be very great: these ministers will run to and fro the earth, and knowledge will be increased, and the earth will be filled with it: the Arabic version reads, "with the splendour of his countenance"; and the Ethiopic version, "with the splendour of his countenance, and his glory"; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001">Isa 60:1</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002">Revelation 18:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">rev 18:2</a></font></span></p>And he cried mightily with a strong voice,.... Which shows not only the vehemence and affection of the ministers of the word, who will publish what follows, but the greatness and importance of it; and this loud voice may be, as for the sake of the whole church in general, that all may bear, so for the sake of those of the Lord's people in particular, that will be in Babylon at this time; and it may have regard to that deep sleep and spirit of slumber that Babylon itself will be in, which, notwithstanding this loud cry, will remain insensible of its ruin till it comes upon her, as was the case of old Babylon, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039">Jer 51:39</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen: the whole world is not designed by Babylon, for it is distinguished from all nations in the following verse; nor Babylon in Chaldea, which was fallen long before John saw this vision, but Rome Papal; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008">Rev 14:8</a> so the woman is called in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005">Rev 17:5</a> who sits on seven mountains, and is that great city, the city of Rome, that reigns over the kings of the earth, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009">Rev 18:9</a> this is said to be fallen, because, in a very little time after this declaration, it will fall; for as yet it was not destroyed, since after this the Lord's people are called upon to come out of her, and are bid to reward her double; and it is declared, that her plagues, should come in one day, and she should be burnt with fire; and an angel after this throws a millstone into the sea, saying, that so should Babylon be thrown down, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004">Rev 18:4</a> and it is repeated to denote the certainty and utter destruction of her: and which is more fully expressed by what follows, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and is become the habitation of devils; as old Babylon was of satyrs, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021">Isa 13:21</a> demons, which appeared in a hairy form, like goats, and the word is rendered devils in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007">Lev 17:7</a> and the inhabitants of Rome now are no other; the pope and his cardinals, the priests, Jesuits, monks, and friars, are the spirits of devils, and their doctrines the doctrines of devils; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014">Rev 16:14</a>
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the hold of every foul spirit: devils are frequently called unclean spirits, and these appear in desert and desolate places, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#043">Mat 12:43</a> where they are either of choice, or rather are obliged to it; and so the word translated "hold" signifies a prison, or place of confinement; and such as are comparable to unclean spirits now haunt and abound in Rome, and its territories; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#013">Rev 16:13</a>
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird; such, as vultures, kites, owls, &amp;c. which generally reside in desolate and uninhabited places; the Alexandrian copy, the Syriac and Ethiopic versions, add, "and the hold", or "seat of every unclean and hateful beast"; and so the desolation of old Babylon is described by wild beasts and doleful creatures dwelling in it, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021">Isa 13:21</a>. Some consider all this as a reason of the destruction of Babylon or Rome, because it now is the residence of persons comparable to devils, foul spirits, hateful birds, and beasts of prey; but this account rather describes its state and case in which it will be after its ruin, being never more to be inhabited by men, in allusion to old Babylon, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019">Isa 13:19</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003">Revelation 18:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">rev 18:3</a></font></span></p>For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,.... That is, all the nations of the Roman empire, the European nations, otherwise the Pagan and Mahometan nations have not; but these have, being made to drink by her, and made drunk therewith, that is, with her idolatries; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008">Rev 14:8</a>. 
 <p>
 </p><p>And the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her; joined with her in her idolatrous worship and practices, and encouraged the same, and obliged their subjects to them in their dominions; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#002">Rev 17:2</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>And the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies; or "luxury"; which is not to be understood in a literal sense; though it is true that many merchants, in all ages, have enriched themselves by sending their commodities to Rome, where, through the vast consumption and luxuriousness of the place, they have bore a good price; but this is to be interpreted of spiritual merchants; these are such who do not merchandise by sea, but are land merchants, the merchants of the earth, and are said to be the great men of the earth, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#023">Rev 18:23</a> such as are equal to princes, lords, and nobles; such are the cardinals, archbishops, and bishops; though the inferior clergy of the Romish church, who are under these, may be included: to which may be added, that one part of their wares is said to be the souls of men, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#013">Rev 18:13</a> which plainly shows what sort of merchants these are; they are such who make merchandise of men, and pretend to sell them heaven, and the salvation of their souls; these are they that deal in pardons and indulgences, which they sell to ignorant people, and for a sum of money say Mass to fetch souls out of purgatory: all things have been saleable at Rome, crucifixes, priests, altars, temples, prayers, heaven, Christ, yea, God himself, as the poet Mantuan expresses it; and because of these idolatries, and wicked practices, Rome will be at last destroyed. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004">Revelation 18:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">rev 18:4</a></font></span></p>And I heard another voice from heaven,.... Either of another, or of the same angel, or rather of God, or Christ himself, since the persons addressed are called his people: 
 <p>
 </p><p>saying, come out of her, my people; meaning either his elect ones, till now uncalled, being such whom God had chosen for his people, and were so by virtue of the covenant of grace, were given to Christ as his people, and were redeemed by him, though, till this call, in an unconverted state; or else such who had been secretly called by the grace of God, but had not made a public profession of the Gospel, nor bore an open testimony against the Romish idolatry; for as the Lord had a righteous Lot in Sodom, and saints where Satan's seat was, Rome Pagan, so he will have a people in Rome Papal, at the time when its destruction draws near; and these wilt be called out, not only in a spiritual sense, to quit the communion of the church, to forsake its idolatries, and not touch the unclean thing, separate themselves from her, and bear a testimony against her doctrines and worship, but in a literal sense, locally; they shall be bid to come out of her, as Lot was ordered to go out of Sodom before its burning, and the people of the Jews out of Babylon before the taking of it, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#008">Jer 50:8</a> to which reference is here had: and as the Christians were called out of Jerusalem before the destruction of it: this shows the particular knowledge the Lord has of his people, be they where they will, and the gracious care he takes of them, that they perish not with others; and that it is his will they should be a separate people from the rest of the world; and this call of his sufficiently justifies the Protestants in their separation from the church of Rome, and every separation from any apostate church; 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that ye be not partakers of her sins: by conniving at them, or committing the same; and all such are partakers of them, and have fellowship with these unfruitful works of darkness, that are in the communion of that church; and those that dwell at Rome are in great danger of being so, and cannot well avoid it: yea, even those that only go to see it, and stay but for a time in it, and that not only through the strength and influence of example, but through the force of power and authority: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and that ye receive not of her plagues; or punishments; the seven last plagues, which belong to her, the vials of which will be poured out upon one or other of the antichristian states, and the fifth particularly will fall upon Rome, the seat of the beast, and is what is here referred to. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#005">Revelation 18:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">rev 18:5</a></font></span></p>For her sins have reached unto heaven,.... Or "have followed unto heaven"; one after another, in one age after another, until they have been as it were heaped up together, and have reached the heavens; the phrase denotes the multitude of them, God's knowledge and notice of them, and the cry of them to him; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#020">Gen 18:20</a> the Alexandrian copy and Complutensian edition read, "have cleaved", or "glued", and so the Syriac and Arabic versions seem to have read; her sins were as it were soldered together, and stuck fast to her, and being joined and linked together, made a long chain, and reached to heaven, and cleaved to that, and cried for vengeance: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and God hath remembered her iniquities; and is about to punish her for them; for as forgiveness of sin is signified by a non-remembrance of it, so punishment of sin by a remembrance of it, and of the persons that commit it; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019">Rev 16:19</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#006">Revelation 18:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">rev 18:6</a></font></span></p>Reward her even as she rewarded you,.... This is spoken to the people of God, who are before called out of Babylon; and the chief of them are the seven angels with the seven last plagues of the wrath of God, and the same with the ten kings that will burn the whore with fire; these are called upon to take vengeance, by way of retaliation, for what she had done to them, in allusion to what is said of old Babylon, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#015">Jer 1:15</a> and must be understood not of what she will have done to them personally, but to their predecessors in the faith of Christ in former ages; that as she had hated them, and made war with them, so now they should hate her, and make war with her; and as she had stripped them naked of their clothes, and spoiled them of their worldly goods and substance, so now they should strip her naked of her harlot's attire, of her gold, silver, and precious stones, and make her and her territories desolate; and as she has burnt many of the precious saints in the flames, as here in England, and elsewhere, so now they shall utterly burn her with fire; and as she has shed the blood of the righteous, and drank it, and been drunk with it, they shall give her blood to drink; and as she hath killed multitudes with the sword, so now shall they kill her and her children; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#012">Rev 13:12</a> nor is this contrary to the doctrine of Christ and his apostles, and the spirit of Christianity, which will not admit of revenge, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#038">Mat 5:38</a> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017">Rom 12:17</a> since this will not be private, but public revenge, inflicted by Christian princes and magistrates, who are ministers of God, and revengers to execute wrath on them that do evil: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and double unto her double according to her works: the meaning is not to inflict upon her a punishment doubly greater than her sins, for this would be contrary to the justice of God; nor does ever God punish men in this life more, but less, than their iniquities deserve; nor can any temporal punishment be doubly greater than sin, which deserves eternal death; and with this she will be punished hereafter, and therefore will not have her full punishment now, and much less a greater than her sins required; to which may be added, that this will be according to her works, her wicked works, and therefore will not exceed the demerit of her sins: but the sense is, that if it was possible to be done, they should use her with double severity to that she had used them with; seeing her sins deserved a severer treatment than even they had had from her; the phrase signifies an abundant and utter destruction, a punishment which was suitable and sufficient; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002">Isa 40:2</a> and it suggests that they should not spare her, nor pity her, but use her with the greatest severity imaginable, it being not possible to exceed her due deserts, or what her works required: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in the cup which he hath filled, fill to her double: not in the cup of her abominations, her errors, idolatries, and wickedness; but in the cup of afflictions and trouble, which she wrung out to the people of God, in that give her double portion: the sense is the same as before. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007">Revelation 18:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">rev 18:7</a></font></span></p>How much she hath glorified herself,.... And acted the proud and haughty part in exalting herself above all emperors, kings, and princes, above all kingdoms and states, and also above all churches, assuming arrogant titles, and even blasphemous names; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001">Rev 13:1</a>
 <p>
 </p><p>and lived deliciously: in a very luxuriant manner, as the popes, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, monks, and friars have done; some being clothed in purple and scarlet, and in gold and silver, and all living upon the fat of the land, and in rioting and drunkenness, in chambering and wantonness: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>so much torment and sorrow give her: by pulling down her pride, which goes before a fall, than which nothing could more torment and afflict her; by stripping her of her fine clothes and rich apparel; and by taking away her fat benefices from her, which will cut her to the heart; and by burning her with fire, which will be very excruciating: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen; a lady of kingdoms, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#005">Isa 47:5</a> to which the reference is; having a temporal power and authority over the kings of the earth, and a spiritual jurisdiction over all churches, apostate ones, being the mother of harlots; and her "sitting" as such, as it well agrees with the whore on many waters, and the woman on the scarlet coloured beast and seven mountains, who are all the same, and is very suitable to antichrist, who pretends to sit in Peter's chair, and does sit in the temple of God, as if he was God; so it is expressive of her empire and government over nations and churches, and of the continuance of it, as she imagines, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#007">Isa 46:7</a> and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "I shall reign always": to which she adds, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and am no widow; nor never shall be, as she flatters herself, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008">Isa 47:8</a>. Were she the true spouse of Christ, as she boasts herself, she indeed would be no widow, for Christ is an everlasting and never dying husband; but she is the whore of the kings of the earth, and though she fancies she shall be no widow, that is, bereft of people and power, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001">Lam 1:1</a> because she now sits on many waters, people, multitudes, and nations and tongues; yet ere long, like old Babylon, she will have no men in her, but will be inhabited by devils, foul spirits, and hateful birds: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and shall see no sorrow; through loss of children, power, and authority; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008">Isa 47:8</a> but in this also she will be mistaken; her children will be killed with death, as is threatened to Jezebel, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#023">Rev 2:23</a> and her plagues shall come upon her at once: now these words may be considered either as spoken by her when in the height of her power and glory, as she was about three or four hundred years ago; or just before her destruction, which seems to be the case, and looks as if she would regain her power, and be in her former state before her utter ruin; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002">Rev 11:2</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008">Revelation 18:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">rev 18:8</a></font></span></p>Therefore shall her plagues come in one day,.... The seven last plagues, which will be in a very little time executed upon her, very speedily and very quickly, one after another, if not all together; and particularly the fifth vial may be respected, as well as the plagues that follow; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#009">Isa 47:9</a>
 <p>
 </p><p>death; not the second death, which will not be till after the decisive battle at Armageddon, when the beast will be taken, and cast alive into the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death; but either the pestilence, which is called so, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#008">Rev 6:8</a> or rather death by the sword, war, which will be brought upon her, and in which she and her children will be slain with the sword: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>mourning; for the loss of her children, the destruction of the city of Rome itself, the seat of the beast, and for the darkness of his kingdom, the inhabitants of which shall be in such pain, as to gnaw their tongues for it: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>famine; which generally attends war, at least sieges; and it looks as if Rome would be besieged awhile before it is destroyed, which will produce a grievous famine in it; this is opposed to her living deliciously, as well as the two former are to her notion of sitting a queen for ever, and knowing no sorrow: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and she shall be utterly burnt with fire; the burning of Rome has been attempted several times, by different persons, and has been burnt in part, but not wholly; see Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016">Rev 17:16</a> but now it will be entirely destroyed by fire; either by fire from heaven, as Sodom and Gomorrah were; or by fire breaking out of the earth, it being very manifest that there are volcanos, burning mountains, and subterraneous fires in those parts, which seem to be so many preparations in nature for the burning of that city; or rather by the ten kings, who will set fire to it; and it may be by all these ways. The Jews have a notion, that, at the coming of the Messiah, Rome will be burnt (a), as Sodom has been; you will find, say they (b), that of Sodom and of that kingdom (Rome, of which they are speaking, and which they afterwards call the fourth kingdom), it is decreed concerning them both, that they "should be burnt with fire"; of Sodom, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024">Gen 19:24</a> and of the fourth kingdom (Rome), <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009">Isa 34:9</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for strong is the Lord God that judgeth her; the Alexandrian copy reads, "that has judged": and so the Syriac and Arabic versions; that is, has purposed and determined her destruction, and therefore it is unavoidable; he that has resolved upon it, and foretold it, and has condemned her to it, is the Lord God Almighty; and he is able to execute the sentence determined and pronounced, and it is impossible she should escape: it may be understood of Christ the mighty God, the Judge of quick and dead; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#034">Jer 50:34</a>. 
 </p><p>

 </p><p>
 </p><p>shall bewail her, and lament for her: shall mourn inwardly, and by various gestures outwardly express their sorrow at her desolation; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#030">Eze 27:30</a> these will not be the ten kings who will burn the whore with fire, and then repent of what they have done, and weep over her, as Titus did at the destruction of Jerusalem, as some Popish writers have fancied, for they will hate the whore, and eat her flesh; but earthly and idolatrous kings, who will be in the communion of the church of Rome: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>when they shall see the smoke of her burning: as Abraham saw the smoke of Sodom and Gomorrah go up like the smoke of a furnace; by which they will perceive that her judgment is come, and her ruin begun.

Lest they themselves should share in it, who have partook of her sins; either they will not be in a capacity to help her, or they will be dispirited, and will be in awe and dread of God's righteous judgments: 
 <p>
 </p><p>saying, alas! alas! that great city Babylon! that mighty city! it will aggravate their sorrow, when they reflect upon the former grandeur, magnificence, power, and authority, of the city and see of Rome, so often called in this book the great city; and so it is by other writers; the Jews call it so: they say (c), when the Messiah comes, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>"the kings of the world shall be gathered to , "the great city" of Rome; and the holy blessed God will cast upon them fire and hail, and great hail stones, (with which compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021">Rev 16:21</a>), and they shall perish from the world, except those kings that do not come there.''

 </p><p>It is common with the Jewish writers to call the Roman empire Edom; and Magdiel, one of the dukes of Edom, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#043">Gen 36:43</a> who has his name from "greatness", is interpreted by one of their commentators (d) of Rome; the reason of which, another of them says (e), is because Rome is become great above all kingdoms: the mount of Esau in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#021">Oba 1:21</a> is interpreted  , "that great city" of Esau, which is Rome (f), and the same epithet it has in the Talmud (g); and Porphyry calls it  , "that great city", without making mention of its name, as here; so among the Latins (h), "Magnoe spes altera" Romae: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for in one hour is thy judgment come: the Ethiopic version reads, "the hour of her judgment"; the time of her punishment fixed by God; but the sense is, that her vengeance was suddenly come upon her; this is the judgment of the great whore, which the angel proposed to show to John, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001">Rev 17:1</a>.

Things for treasure and ornament, and with which the great whore is said to be decked, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004">Rev 17:4</a> and, literally understood, may denote the vast riches which these spiritual merchants, or factors for Rome, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, monks, and friars, bring into their own coffers and the pope's, by the trade they drive in her wares with the souls of men; and may have also a regard to what their images, chalices, crowns, mitres, &amp;c. are made of, and what some of them are adorned with; and as Tyre, to whom the reference is in the several particulars of this account, had her merchants for these things, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#012">Eze 27:12</a> so Mr. Brightman thinks that in these, and in some following ones, Spain is Rome's merchant, which fetches them from the Indies for her: but these things, mystically taken, sometimes design the doctrines of the Gospel, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012">Co1 3:12</a> and which are to be preferred to, and more to be esteemed than thousands of gold and silver; and these Rome's merchants pretended to deliver out; but instead of them, they put off wood, hay, and stubble, yea, doctrines of devils, and lies in hypocrisy; and sometimes the grace of God is meant, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018">Rev 3:18</a> which is more precious than gold that perisheth; and this they pretend to convey to men "ex opere operato", in the ordinances, as baptism, &amp;c. and to communicate the Spirit, with his gifts and graces, for money, which is direct simony; yea, they pretend to sell eternal life, nay, Christ, and God himself: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet: things which belong to apparel and dress; and, literally taken, the "fine linen" is for their copes, wore by bishops and by chanters, and sub-chanters, and for surplices wore by their priests, in imitation of the Jewish priests, and for Mass clothes, &amp;c. the "purple, silk", and "scarlet", were for the popes, cardinals, archbishops, and bishops; so the woman on the scarlet coloured beast is said to be arrayed in purple and scarlet, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004">Rev 17:4</a>, Tyre had its merchants for these, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#007">Eze 27:7</a> the fine linen and silk may mystically denote the holy lives, good works, and merits of the saints, those of them called works of supererogation, which become the church's stock, and they sell out for others that want; which is a monstrous kind of ware, and a dreadful imposition upon men, since men cannot be saved and justified by works; and the best of men are so far from having a redundancy of works, that in everything they sin and offend, and are greatly deficient: and they are so far from helping others, that they are unprofitable servants themselves: the purple and scarlet may signify the blood of Christ, which they pretend to sell in the Mass; nay, they have pretended to have had the very liquid blood of Christ, which they have carried in a crystal glass, thick on one side, and transparent on the other; and so could not be seen by persons in a mortal sin, until they had given a good deal of money, and then the clear side was by sleight of hand turned to them; and which was no other than the blood of a duck, renewed weekly by the priest; which trick for a long time brought in vast sums of money, and was detected at Hales in Gloucestershire, in Henry the Eighth's time; or these may intend the sufferings of the saints, which likewise come into the treasure of the church, and are at its dispose for money, the virtue of which being very great for the salvation of men's souls: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble: things for utensils and furniture, not so much for their houses, as for their churches; Tyre had its merchants for these, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#005">Eze 27:5</a>. "Thyine wood", Pliny says (i), was very durable, and of it the rafters of ancient temples were made; and may design such like lasting and odoriferous wood as cypress, cedar, &amp;c. used in the Popish churches, for the embellishing of them, and for images in them; it may be the same with the wood of the Almug, or Algum trees, since these are rendered thyine wood in the Vulgate Latin version in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011">Kg1 10:11</a> vessels of ivory may be boxes made thereof, in which the host is put, and the relics of saints are preserved: and "vessels of most precious wood", or "stone", as the Alexandrian copy, Vulgate Latin, and Ethiopic versions read, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and of brass, iron, and marble, may intend various vessels used in their churches; as vessels for holy water, fonts of marble, and other valuable stones, for baptism, censers of iron and brass to burn incense in. Cocceius thinks that by these vessels of different materials are meant good men; who are like sweet smelling wood for the fragrancy of their doctrines and lives; and like iron, brass, and marble, for their courage, constancy, and patience; and who have been canonized for saints, which has brought in much money into the pope's coffers: this is a practice in imitation of the Heathens, who deified men, and set them over particular days and affairs; and the privileges of such canonization among the Papists are, that such a saint has his name set in the calendar in red letters, may have churches and altars dedicated to him, and his image set up in them, and a holiday be kept for him, and may be prayed to, and worshipped; a practice dreadfully derogatory to the glory of Christ's person and office, but is that in which these merchants have found their account; for through references, commissions, and reports, for proof of the saint's character and miracles, his friends are at very great expense before the affair is issued, especially if rich; our King Henry the Seventh was very desirous of having his kinsman Henry the Sixth canonized, and solicited the pope for it, but he would not do it under fifteen hundred ducats of gold, which the king thought was too much, and so declined it.

Things for delight and pleasure, for the gratifying of the senses; cinnamon, and odours were used for perfuming, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#017">Pro 7:17</a> anointing with oil was used at feasts, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005">Psa 23:5</a> and "frankincense", or censings, at banquets, and for the regaling of persons after food (k): these customs obtained among the eastern people. Tyre had its merchants for these things, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#019">Eze 27:19</a> and Mr. Brightman thinks Italy is Rome's merchant in these, which it fetches from Greece, Arabia, and Egypt; it may be these rather respect the ecclesiastical use of them; "cinnamon, odours", and "frankincense", may signify the perfumings and censings used in churches, or the burning incense in imitation of the sweet incense under the law; and "ointments" may denote their chrism, or anointing with oil at baptism, imagining that Christ was anointed with material oil at his baptism, whereas it was with the Holy Ghost: moreover, these things may be mystically understood, "cinnamon" being used by harlots in perfuming their bed, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#017">Pro 7:17</a> may intend the stews and brothel houses erected at Rome, and licensed by authority, each whore paying so much per week; the revenues of which would sometimes yearly amount to twenty thousand ducats: "ointments" may be understood of chrism in baptism, and extreme unction at death: "odours" and "frankincense" may mean their prayers and pater nosters, their prayers for the dead, which were never made without the pence; hence that proverbial expression, no pence, no pater noster.

Tyre had her merchants for these, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#017">Eze 27:17</a> and Mr. Brightman will have Italy to be Rome's merchant for wine and oil; Sardinia and Sicily her merchants for fine flour and wheat; Germany for beasts, and England for sheep: and with respect to the ecclesiastical use of these things, wine is for the chalice, used in daily Masses, and drank only by the priests; "oil" for chrism at baptism, and for the extreme unction: "fine flour" for the Mass, or to make their breaden god of; and "wheat, beasts, and sheep" for tithes for the clergy: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and horses, and chariots, and slaves; things for splendour, equipage, and attendance; horses and chariots for the popes, cardinals, archbishops, and bishops, to ride in state and grandeur, and slaves to wait upon them. Tyre had her merchants for these <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#014">Eze 27:14</a> and Mr. Brightman's opinion is, that the French are Rome's merchants for horses and chariots, and the Swiss for slaves, or "bodies", as the word may be rendered, who live by exercising their bodies, and hiring them out in war; and who are many of them the guards of the person of the pope of Rome: and last of all it is added, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and souls of men; still in allusion to the merchandise of Tyre, some of whose merchants are said to trade in the persons of men, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#013">Eze 27:13</a> which the Targum and Septuagint render, in the souls of men; the popes have some of them sold their own souls to the devil, to get into the chair, and, when in, have been the means of destroying of thousands of others; they assume a power over the souls of men, of binding and loosing the consciences of men, imposing new laws upon them, and freeing them from obligation to the laws of God and men, to the ruin of their souls; and it has been said by their sycophants, that if the pope should send thousands of men to hell, no one should say to him, what dost thou? The Romish priests pretend to redeem souls out of purgatory for such a sum of money, and sell pardons and indulgences, say Mass, and promise heaven itself for money; and this they get at the expense of men's souls, by their false doctrine and superstitious worship, and so make merchandise of them, as is said of the false teachers, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003">Pe2 2:3</a> moreover, as by "slaves", or bodies, in the preceding clause, are meant such who serve with their bodies, either by way of attendance, or in unnatural lust; so by "souls" of men may be meant men of soul, of great natural wit and understanding, of great parts, abilities, and learning, with which they serve the man of sin, and his interest, such as Bellarmine, and others.

 </p><p>and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be shall be, found any more in thee; which are very useful and necessary in cities and societies; it is threatened to Judah, that the cunning artificer should be taken from her, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#003">Isa 3:3</a> and it is reckoned as a considerable part of the distress of the captivity that the carpenters and smiths were away from Jerusalem, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001">Jer 24:1</a> and this judgment may fall on Rome for her worshipping idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, the works of men's hands, artificers and craftsmen, and who are employed in making other trinkets and wares for antichrist: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee; to grind corn with, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010">Jer 25:10</a> there will be a famine at the time that Rome is besieged, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008">Rev 18:8</a> and after it is destroyed, there will be no corn to grind, nor inhabitants to eat it, and so no use of the millstone; this is said in opposition to her luxurious and delicious living, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003">Rev 18:3</a> and this may also refer to feasts and rich entertainments, for which spices were ground and prepared by an hand mill (m) in the house; and so may signify here that there would be no more of such entertainments and rich living; with which sense agrees what follows. This clause is wanting in the Syriac and Ethiopic versions.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">rev 18:23</a></font></span></p>And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee,.... Either for common use, or at feasts, or at marriages, which being kept at night, required candies, lamps, or torches; this shows that Babylon, or Rome, shall be deprived of everything, even of the least thing that is comfortable in life; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010">Jer 25:10</a> this will be a just punishment upon her for her abuse of this blessing of life; so where wax candles in great numbers have been burning in the daytime, there will not be so much as a single candle to give light in the night; and where candles have been lighted up for the dead, there will not be one for the use of the living: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: there will be no marrying, nor giving in marriage; no procreation of children, or propagation of posterity, in this place; which denotes the utter extirpation of the inhabitants of it; the phrases are taken from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034">Jer 7:34</a> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010">Jer 25:10</a> and this will be in righteous retaliation for the prohibition of marriage; which God has instituted, and is honourable, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#002">Ti1 4:2</a> the reasons of Babylon's destruction follow: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for thy merchants were the great men of the earth: in allusion to the merchants of Tyre, said to be princes, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008">Isa 23:8</a> for by trading and dealing in the wares and merchandise of Rome, persons of mean extract, and of very low circumstances of life, have grown exceeding rich, and have equalled the princes of the earth; as for instance, Cardinal Wolsey here in England, a butcher's son at Ipswich; and on the other hand, the princes and great men of the earth have become Rome's merchants, and have thought it an high honour to get a cardinal's hat, as the Cardinals Albertus duke of Austria, Bourbon, Pool, and others, mentioned by Brightman: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived; meaning her false doctrines, traditions, idolatry, superstition, and will worship, with which, as another Jezebel, she has bewitched, allured, and deceived the nations of the empire, and the kings thereof, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003">Rev 18:3</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#024">Revelation 18:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">rev 18:24</a></font></span></p>And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints,.... Such as before mentioned, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020">Rev 18:20</a> this is another reason of her destruction, besides her luxury and idolatry, namely, her shedding the blood of the saints, with which she is said to be drunk, and therefore blood is now given her to drink, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#006">Rev 17:6</a> for she will now be found guilty of slaying the witnesses, who are meant by the prophets and saints, that have been from the beginning of the apostasy: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and of all that were slain upon the earth: not only of those that have been slain in the city of Rome, but of all those that have been slain throughout the empire; they being slain by her order, or with her consent, and she conniving at it, encouraging it, and therefore will be justly chargeable with it all; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#031">Mat 23:31</a> the Ethiopic version adds, "for the name of Christ".
