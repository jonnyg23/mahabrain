 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_000">deu 28:0</a></font></span></p>INTRODUCTION TO DEUTERONOMY 28 
 <p>
 </p><p>In this chapter Moses enlarges on the blessings and the curses which belong, the one to the doers, the other to the transgressors of the law; the blessings, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001">Deu 28:1</a>; the curses, some of which concern individual persons, others the whole nation and body of people, and that both under the former and present dispensations, and which had their fulfilment in their former captivities, and more especially in their present dispersion, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015">Deu 28:15</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001">Deuteronomy 28:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">deu 28:1</a></font></span></p>And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God,.... In his law, and by his prophets: 
 <p>
 </p><p>to observe and to do all his commandments, which I command thee this day; for without observing them to do them, hearing them would be to little purpose, and they were all of them to be observed and done, the lesser and weightier matters of the law as they were commanded by Moses in the name of the Lord, and as they would be taught, explained, and enforced by the prophets: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth: as they were in the times of David and Solomon; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#019">Deu 26:19</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#002">Deuteronomy 28:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">deu 28:2</a></font></span></p>And all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee,.... After mentioned, which should come upon them from God from heaven, by the direction of his providence, and that freely and plentifully, and beyond their expectations and deserts, and continue with them: 
 <p>
 </p><p>if thou shall hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God; obedience to the law being the condition of their coming and continuance; for only temporal blessings in the land of Canaan are here intended, as follow. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#003">Deuteronomy 28:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">deu 28:3</a></font></span></p>Blessed shalt thou be in the city,.... Not only in the city of Jerusalem, where the temple would be built, and there be blessed with the service, worship, and ordinances of God, but in all other cities of the land; where they should dwell in title, large, and spacious houses, and their cities should be walled and fenced, and be very populous; yet should enjoy health, and have plenty of all sorts of provisions brought unto them, as well as prosper in all kinds of merchandise there, as Aben Ezra notes: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and blessed shalt thou be in the field; in the country villages, and in all rural employments, in sowing and planting, as the same writer observes; in all kinds of husbandry, in the culture of the fields for corn, and of vineyards and oliveyards; all should prosper and succeed, and bring forth fruit abundantly. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#004">Deuteronomy 28:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">deu 28:4</a></font></span></p>Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body,.... Their children, of which they should have many, and these live; be healthful, thrive, and arrive to manhood, and increase and perpetuate their families. Grotius thinks this was eminently fulfilled in Mary, the mother of our Lord; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#042">Luk 1:42</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>and the fruit of thy ground; of their gardens, orchards, and fields; grass for the cattle, and the wheat, barley, vines, figs, pomegranates, olives, and dates for the use of men: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the fruit of thy cattle; which being distinguished from oxen and sheep in the following clause, must be understood of camels and asses, which were used for the carriage both of persons and burdens, and were very serviceable, and were a considerable part of their substance in those countries; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003">Job 1:3</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep; of their cows and oxen, and of their sheep and goats, which were very increasing creatures, and in the increase of which much of their outward happiness lay; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#013">Psa 144:13</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#005">Deuteronomy 28:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">deu 28:5</a></font></span></p>Blessed shall be thy basket,.... Which the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem restrain to the basket of firstfruits, and the cake of the first of their dough; but it intends any and every vessel in which they put their provisions for present use, and that that should never be empty of them, and that they should always have a sufficiency: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and thy store; what remained, and was laid up in their barns, cellars, and storehouses, for future use, or in proper places for seed. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#006">Deuteronomy 28:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">deu 28:6</a></font></span></p>Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out. In all their business and employments of life whether within doors or without; in the administration of every office, whether more public or private; and in all their journeys going out and coming home; and particularly when they went out to war, and returned, all should be attended with success. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#007">Deuteronomy 28:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">deu 28:7</a></font></span></p>The Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face,.... As the Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, Edomites, and Ammonites were, especially in the times of David: 
 <p>
 </p><p>they shall come out against thee one way: in a body, all together, in large numbers, marching in great order, to give them battle: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and flee before thee seven ways; be entirely routed, and flee some one way, and some another, even every way they could take to make their escape. The phrase is expressive of an entire victory, and of a complete rout and dispersion of an enemy. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#008">Deuteronomy 28:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">deu 28:8</a></font></span></p>The Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses,.... Barns, granaries, and cellar, where their corn, wine, and oil, were laid up; by preserving the corn from being devoured by vermin, and the casks of wine and oil from bursting and running out: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and in all thou settest thine hand unto; in all their manufactures, occupations, and trades, in which they were employed, and in the culture of their vines, olives, and other fruit trees: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and he shall bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee; with health and long life in it, and with an abundance of all good things, it being a land flowing with milk and honey. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#009">Deuteronomy 28:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">deu 28:9</a></font></span></p>And the Lord shall establish thee an holy people unto himself,.... Having separated them from all others, for his service, honour, and glory, should continue them as such, and settle them in the land, and confirm all their privileges, natural, civil, and religious. The Targum of Jonathan is,"the Word of the Lord shall establish thee, &amp;c.''he that brought them out of Egypt, through the Red sea and wilderness, to the land of Canaan: 
 <p>
 </p><p>as he hath sworn unto thee: and to their fathers; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#012">Deu 7:12</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>if thou shall keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways; by which tenure they held the land of Canaan, and their settlement and continuance in it, and enjoyment of all the good things thereof; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#019">Isa 1:19</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#010">Deuteronomy 28:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">deu 28:10</a></font></span></p>And all the people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord,.... Called his children, his people, his portion, and his inheritance; and that they are his, and he is theirs, by the care he takes of them, the provision he makes for them, and the protection they have from him: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and they shall be afraid of thee; as not only the Canaanites were, but all other nations; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#025">Deu 11:25</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#011">Deuteronomy 28:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">deu 28:11</a></font></span></p>And the Lord shall make thee plenteous in goods,.... In all temporal good things, give them an affluence of them, even all things richly to enjoy; the Targum of Jonathan is,"the Word of the Lord shall, &amp;c." 
 <p>
 </p><p>in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground: increase their children, cattle, and substance, as before, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#004">Deu 28:4</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in the land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers to give thee; the land of Canaan, often thus described. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#012">Deuteronomy 28:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">deu 28:12</a></font></span></p>The Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure,.... The Lord has his treasures of snow and of hail, and of wind, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#022">Job 38:22</a>; but here his good treasure, as appears by what follows, is his treasure of rain. In the Targum of Jonathan it is said, 
 <p>
 </p><p>"there are four keys in the hand of the Lord of the whole world, which he does not deliver into the hands of any prince; the keys of life, and of the grave, and of food, and of rain:" 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the heaven, to give the rain unto thy land in its season; that is, he will open the heaven, where his good treasure of rain is laid up, and bring it forth or, the land of Canaan for the enriching of it; or will open the windows thereof, and pour down the blessing; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010">Mal 3:10</a>; and that at the proper time, both in autumn and spring, the one is called the former, and the other the latter rain; the one was in Marchesvan, or October, and the other in Nisan, or March, as the Targum of Jonathan; the former rain for the fitting the earth for seed, or for watering it when sown, and the latter for the plumping of it before harvest: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and to bless all the work of thine hand; in agriculture, for without the blessing of rain, all the labour of the husbandman would be to little purpose: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and thou shall lend unto many nations, and thou shall not borrow; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#016">Deu 15:16</a>. The connection of these words with what goes before may lead to observe this sense of them, that they should furnish other countries with corn, and not need any of theirs; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#017">Eze 27:17</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#013">Deuteronomy 28:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">deu 28:13</a></font></span></p>And the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail,.... Give them dominion over others, and not make them subject to them; the head signifies rulers and governors, and the tail the common people that are subjects; or the one such that are honourable and in high esteem, and the other such that are mean and base; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#014">Isa 9:14</a>; the Targum of Jonathan is,"the Word of the Lord shall make thee, &amp;c." 
 <p>
 </p><p>and thou shalt be above only, and thou shall not be beneath; which explains what is meant by head and tail, being uppermost and lowermost, as the head is the upper part, and the tail the lower part of a creature; the one is more honourable, the other vile: the sense is, that they should be superior to other people in honour and dignity, and not below them, or vassals to them: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>if that thou hearken to the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day to observe and to do them; which is the condition on which all this happiness depended. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#014">Deuteronomy 28:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">deu 28:14</a></font></span></p>And thou shall not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day,.... Depart from them as a rule to walk by, turn out from them as a path to walk in, neglect and disobey them, and go into practices contrary to them: turning 
 <p>
 </p><p>to the right hand or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them; which to do was to break the first and principal table of the law, than which nothing was more abominable and provoking to God. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015">Deuteronomy 28:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">deu 28:15</a></font></span></p>But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God,.... As directed, exhorted, and encouraged to, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001">Deu 28:1</a>, &amp;c. 
 <p>
 </p><p>to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day; both moral and ceremonial: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that all these curses shall come upon thee; from the hand of God, certainly, suddenly, and unawares: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and overtake thee; pursuing after thee, will come up to thee, and seize upon thee, though they may seem to move slowly; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003">Zac 5:3</a>; namely, the curses which follow. Manasseh Ben Israel (f) divides them into two parts, the first from hence to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#045">Deu 28:45</a>; which respects the destruction of the first temple, and the things that went before or related to that; and the second from thence to the end of the chapter, which he thinks refers to the destruction of the second temple, and their present case and circumstances; and it must be owned that for the most part the distinction may seem to hold good; what is prophesied of that should befall the Jews for their disobedience being more remarkably and distinctly fulfilled in the one than in the other; yet there are things in the whole which respect both, or that were fulfilled, some under one dispensation, and some under another, and some that were fulfilled in both; but chiefly and more manifestly at and since their dispersion by the Romans.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">deu 28:16</a></font></span></p>Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#016">Deu 28:16</a> the curses are delivered out in form, as the reverse of the blessings in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#003">Deu 28:3</a>; and by observing what the blessings mean, the sense of the curses may easily be understood, the one being directly opposite to the other. See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#003">Deu 28:3</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">deu 28:20</a></font></span></p>The Lord shall send upon thee cursing,.... Which is either a general word for all that follows, or rather, since that had been expressed before in various instances, this may denote some particular judgment. Jarchi interprets it of penury, of want of all good things, extreme poverty, so as to be reduced to the utmost necessity, and as to stand in need of the common comforts and supports of life, and even to have their blessings and mercies turned into curses; the consequence of which must needs be 
 <p>
 </p><p>vexation; trouble, distress, and anguish of spirit: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and rebuke; this may well be considered as a rebuke and correction in Providence for sins committed, to awaken to a sense and acknowledgment of them, and to repentance for them: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in all that thou settest thine hand to do; nothing done should prosper, to relieve them under their pressing wants, a curse attending all their efforts, and so sad disappointment follows; and all as a just rebuke for their many sins: and this would be their case more or less: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; through famine, and want of the common necessaries of life; as at the sieges of Samaria and Jerusalem, by the kings of Syria, Assyria, and Babylon: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>because of the wickedness of thy doings, because thou hast forsaken me; their several immoralities and impieties, and particularly their idolatry, which was a forsaking the worship of the true God, and following idols; an iniquity to be punished by the judge, and of all things the most provoking to the Lord. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#021">Deuteronomy 28:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">deu 28:21</a></font></span></p>The Lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee,.... Not only to come upon them; but to continue with them: 
 <p>
 </p><p>until he have consumed thee from off the land whither thou goest to possess it; which shows that this respects not some particular seasons, when the pestilence came and continued awhile, and then ceased, as in the times of David; but when it became more general, and issued with other judgments in the utter consumption of them, as at the destruction of Jerusalem, both by the Babylonians and the Romans; at what times the pestilence raged and remained, until by that and other sore judgments the land was wholly depopulated. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#022">Deuteronomy 28:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">deu 28:22</a></font></span></p>The Lord shall smite thee with a consumption,.... An emaciation of their bodies, either through famine or wasting diseases, whereby the fluids are washed off, and men are reduced to skin and bones: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and with a fever; a hot burning disease, which dries up the radical moisture, consumes it, and so threatens with death; of which there are various sorts, and some very pestilential and mortal Jarchi and Aben Ezra interpret it of a fire in the face, by which they seem to mean what is called St. Anthony's fire: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning; either in the inward parts, as an inflammation of the lungs; or in the outward parts, as carbuncles, burning ulcers, and the like: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and with the sword; in the margin it is, "with drought"; so Aben Ezra interprets the word, which seems better to suit with what it is in company with; and designs either drought in human bodies, occasioned by fevers, inflammations, and extreme burnings; or in the earth, through the force of the sun, and want of rain, which render the earth barren and unfruitful, and so cause a famine: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and with blasting and with mildew; whereby the corn that is sown, and springs up, comes to nothing, being blasted by east winds, or turns pale and yellow by the mildew, and so withers away; the consequence of which is want of food, and so destruction and ruin; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#009">Amo 4:9</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and they shall pursue thee until thou perish; follow hard after them, and come so close one after another upon them, until they are utterly destroyed. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#023">Deuteronomy 28:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">deu 28:23</a></font></span></p>And the heaven that is over thy head shall be brass,.... Or like brass, not for its clearness, brightness, and splendour, or for its being spread out like a molten looking glass which was of brass, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#018">Job 37:18</a>; but for its dryness and hardness, no moisture being in it, or passing through it; no showers of rain nor dew being let down from it: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and the earth that is under thee shall be iron; or like iron, hard and impenetrable, into which the plough and spade will not enter; nor anything spring out of it, for want of rain and dew to moisten and soften it. The same is said in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019">Lev 26:19</a>; only there is an inversion of the figures; there the heaven is said to be as iron, and the earth like brass, but signify the same thing.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">deu 28:24</a></font></span></p>The Lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust,.... That is, instead of showers of rain in their season, to water, refresh, and enrich the earth, and make it fruitful; and for want of them, and through the heat of the sun, being dried and parched, and its clods crumbled into dust, this should be raised up into the air by the force of winds, and let down again in showers of dust; whereby the few herbs, plants, or green trees on it would be utterly destroyed: and so the Targum of Jonathan interprets it of the Lord's sending a wind that should raise the dust and earth upon the herbs of their fields. Such ploughing winds, that cast up the earth and sand, and dust, into the air, whereby men and cattle are sometimes covered, are frequent in the eastern countries; of which See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#008">Jon 4:8</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>from heaven shall it come down upon thee until thou be destroyed; that is, from the air, up to which the dust is carried by the wind, and then let fall in vast quantities, like showers, which are very destructive.

And by them, as they sometimes were by the Philistines and others, before their utter destruction, when they sinned against the Lord; and by the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Romans: 
 <p>

And yet it must be owned that Strabo (g), who wrote before the last destruction of them, affirms, that it was not easy to find any place in the world which had not received them, and was not occupied by them.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore; continually, every day, all the days of their lives, oppressed with taxes and tributes, with mulcts and fines, and spoiled of their goods and substance under one pretence or another; which has been generally their case in Popish countries; for this seems not to refer to the Babylonish captivity, where they built houses, and dwelt in them, and planted gardens, and ate the fruit of them; and in the peace of cities had peace themselves, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#005">Jer 29:5</a>,

 <p>
 </p><p>and thine eyes shall look and fail; with longing: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for them all the day long; expecting every day their children would be returned to them, at least wishing and hoping they would; their hearts yearning after them, but all in vain: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and there shall be no might in thy hand; to recover them out of the hands of those who had the possession of them, or fetch them back from distant countries, whither they were carried. By an edict of the Portuguese, the children of the Jews were ordered to be carried to the uninhabited islands; and when, by the king's command, they were had to the ships in which they were to be transported, it is incredible, the Jewish historian says (l), what howlings and lamentations were made by the women; and there wore none pitied them and comforted them, or could help them.

In Germany, in their rage and madness, they burnt a city and themselves in it; and, in the same country, being summoned by an edict to change their religion, or to be burnt, they agreed to meet together in a certain house, and destroy one another; and first parents killed their children, and husbands their wives, and then killed themselves; leaving only one person to be their doorkeeper, who finished the tragedy by destroying himself, as their own historian relates (m).

Since they would not serve the Lord their God, who was so good a master to them, and supplied them with all good things, and with plenty of them, they should serve other lords, their enemies, whom God would raise up and send against them; not only, the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Babylonians, but the Romans, after described, whom they should find hard masters, and from whom they; should have very severe usage, and should be 
 <p>
 </p><p>in hunger and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all good things; being destitute of food, and drink and raiment, and the common necessaries of life, and so in famishing and starving circumstances: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck; bring them into a state of subjection to their enemies, which would be intolerable to them, and from which they would not be able to free themselves, any more than to break an iron yoke; which, as it agrees with the Babylonish captivity, and their subjection in that state, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#013">Jer 28:13</a>; so more especially with their bondage under the Romans, who are the legs of iron in Nebuchadnezzar's image, and the fourth beast with great iron teeth in Daniel's vision, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#033">Dan 2:33</a>, and this yoke was to continue 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>until he have destroyed thee; the Jews were under the Roman yoke, Roman governors being set over them, and Judea made a Roman province many years before the destruction of their nation, city, and temple, by them.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_049">deu 28:49</a></font></span></p>The Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth,.... Now though Babylon is represented as a country distant from Judea, and said to be a nation "from far", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015">Jer 5:15</a>; yet not "from the end of the earth"; as here; and though the Roman nation, strictly speaking, was not at so great a distance from Jerusalem, yet the Roman emperors, and great part of their armies brought against it, were fetched from our island of Great Britain, which in former times was reckoned the end of the earth, and the uttermost parts of the world (s); and so Manasseh Ben Israel (t) interprets this nation of Rome, and observes, that Vespasian brought for his assistance many nations (or soldiers) out of England, France, Spain, and other parts of the world: and not only Vespasian was sent for from Britain to make war with the Jews, but when they rebelled, in the times of Adrian, Julius Severus, a very eminent general, was sent for from thence to quell them. And it appears to be a very ancient opinion of the Jews, that this passage is to be understood of the Romans, from what is related in one of their Talmuds (u): they say, that"Trajan, being sent for by his wife to subdue the Jews, determined to come in ten days, and came in five; he came and found them (the Jews) busy in the law on that verse, "the Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far", &amp;c. he said unto them, what are ye busy in? they answered him, so and so; he replied to them, this is the man (meaning himself) who thought to come in ten days, and came in five; and he surrounded them with his legions, and slew them:" 
 <p>
 </p><p>as swift as the eagle flieth; which may respect not so much the swiftness of this creature, the words which convey the idea being a supplement of the text, as the force with which it flies when in sight of its prey, and hastes unto it and falls upon it, which is irresistible; and this is the sense of the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions, and is what is ascribed to the eagle by other writers (w). Now though this figure is used of the Chaldeans and Babylonians, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013">Jer 4:13</a>; it agrees full as well or better with the Romans, because of their swiftness in coming from distant parts, and because of the force and impetus with which they invaded Judea, besieged Jerusalem, and attacked the Jews everywhere; and besides, the eagle was borne on the standard in the Roman army (x): 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand; which, though it is also said of the language of the Chaldean nation, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015">Jer 5:15</a>; yet as the Chaldee and Hebrew languages were only dialects of one and the same language, common to the eastern nations, the Chaldee language, though on account of termination of words, pronunciation, and other things, might be difficult, and hard to be understood by the Jews, yet must be much more easy to understand than the Roman language, so widely different from theirs.

This was fulfilled in the siege of Samaria, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#025">Kg2 6:25</a>; and in the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010">Lam 2:10</a> and again in the Apocrypha:"Moreover he hath delivered them to be in subjection to all the kingdoms that are round about us, to be as a reproach and desolation among all the people round about, where the Lord hath scattered them.''

Though the particular instance in which his eye would be evil to them follows, yet no doubt there are other instances in which his eye would be evil towards them, as there were at the siege of Jerusalem, and have been since. Josephus (b) says,"that in every house where there was any appearance of food (or anything that looked like it, that had the shadow of it) there was a battle; and the dearest friends fought with one another, snatching away from each other, the miserable supports of life;''as the husband from his wife and children, and the wife from her husband and children; see more in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#056">Deu 28:56</a>; and, in later times, we told by the Jewish historian (c), that wrote an account of their sufferings and distresses since their dispersion, that at Fez the Jews sold their children for slaves for bread.

Or her secundine, "her afterbirth", as in the margin of our Bibles; so the Targum of Jonathan and Aben Ezra interpret it. The latter describes it,"the place of the fetus, while it abides in the womb of its mother;''the membrane in which the child is wrapped; and it is suggested that, as nauseous as that is, the delicate woman should eat it, and then the newborn child that was wrapped in it; so Jarchi interprets it, little children; though it seems to be distinguished from the children she bears or brings forth in the next clause: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and towards her children which she shall bear; that is, have an evil eye towards them, to eat them as follows: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates; that is, eat her children, being reduced to the utmost extremity, being in want of all things, having nothing at all to abate her sharp hunger; which, and nothing else, could incline her, and prevail upon her to do an action so monstrously horrid: and which she would do in the most private and secret manner; both lest others should partake with her, as well as being conscious of the foulness and blackness of the crime, that would not by any means bear the light; and all this owing to the closeness of the siege, and the unspeakable distress they should be in through it. For the illustration of this, take the following story as related by Josephus (f);"a woman, whose name was Mary, that lived beyond Jordan, illustrious for her descent and riches fled with the multitude to Jerusalem when besieged carrying with her her substance, and what food she could get that were left to her by the spoilers; where being pressed with famine, she took her sucking child, killed it boiled it, and ate half of it, and then laid up the rest, and covered it; and when the seditious party entered the house, they smelt it, and demanded her food, threatening to kill her if she did not deliver it; which when she brought forth, declaring what she had done, they were struck with horror; to whom she said, this is my son, and this my own deed; eat, for I have eaten; be not more tender or softer than a woman, and more sympathizing or more pitiful than a mother.''All the ideas that this prophecy of Moses conveys are to be met with in this account; as of a woman well bred and delicate, reduced to the utmost distress, and wanting all the necessaries of life, killing her tender infant, a sucking babe, eating it secretly, and laying up the rest covered for another time. If Moses had lived to have known the fact committed, as Josephus did, he could not have expressed it well in stronger and clearer terms than he has done. This is a most amazing instance of a prophecy delivered out two thousand years or more before the fact was done, and of the exact accomplishment of it; and if the observation of a learned critic (g) can be established, that the first word of this verse should be  and so be rendered, "and she shall boil that which cometh out from between her feet, even her children which she shall bear", the fulfilment of the prophecy will appear still more exact, both at the siege of Samaria, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#020">Kg2 6:20</a>; and of Jerusalem, as in the above relation of Josephus.

 </p><p>and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it; in a violent manner, by their enemies, and against their wills, they being loath to leave it. The Emperor Adrian, to prevent their insurrections and rebellions, which had given him a great deal of trouble, ordered by an edict that no Jew should come into Jerusalem, nor into the land of Judea, or be seen in it, which is observed by several writers (m); by which means the country was cleared of them. In later times some of them did get thither again, but they were but few. Benjamin of Tudela, a Jew of the twelfth century, travelled into several parts of the world in quest of his countrymen, and particularly into Judea, and his view was to magnify his people; and yet owns he found at Jerusalem only two hundred persons, whose employment was dyeing wool, and dwelt in a corner of the town under the tower of David; and but twelve at Bethlehem, three at Maresha, at Shunem indeed three hundred, none at Gilead, two at Nob, who were dyers, three at Ramah, one at Joppa, none at Jafne, where had been a famous academy, none at Ashdod, and at Tiberias about fifty (n). And our countryman Sandys (o), who travelled into Judea in the seventeenth century, says,"here be some Jews, yet inherit they no part of the land, but in their own country do live as aliens.''

Which refers to their present dispersion, being now, more or fewer, in all parts of the world, east, west, north, and south: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone: it may be observed, that the phrase, "which either thou nor fathers have known", is fitly added here, which is not used of them, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#036">Deu 28:36</a>; and well agrees with the idols of the Papists, their images of the Virgin Mary, and saints departed, made of wood and stone, which were such the fathers of the Jews never knew; just as it is said of the host, the consecrated wafer, the breaden god honoured by antichrist, that it is "a god who his fathers knew not", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#038">Dan 11:38</a>; the apostles and ancient fathers of the church. Now in Popish countries the Jews have often been prevailed upon to change, or at least dissemble their religion, and embrace Popery: and have worshipped images of wood and stone. The author of the history of their calamities and sufferings owns this;"multitudes (he says (p)) in Spain and Portugal forsook the law of Moses, and joined the Papists, pretending at least to be of their religion.'' 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>He makes mention of sixteen thousand at one time (q), and some, he say (r),"that were driven out of Spain, came into Italy, where the young men pressed with famine could not bear it, and changed their religion, and began to worship images that they might have to satisfy their hunger; and the Papists used to go about with a crucifix in one hand, and a piece of bread in the other, promising the bread to those that would worship the crucifix; and so many famishing persons forsook the law of Moses, and mixed with them:''and to this day the convents of monks and nuns in Spain are full of them; and most of their canons, inquisitors, and bishops, are Jews (s). The Targum of Jonathan indeed, to clear them from idolatry itself, gives another sense of these words, paraphrasing them,"ye shall pay tribute to the worshippers of idols.''

No quiet settlement, nor certain dwelling, being obliged to move from place to place through cruel edicts, heavy fines and mulcts, exorbitant taxes and impositions, and diligent search made after them by the courts of the inquisition, especially where any substance was to be gotten. The Jews themselves (t) own that this passage is now fulfilled in them: 
 <p>
 </p><p>but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart; being always in fear lest their persons should be seized on, their children taken from them, and their goods confiscated; hence the poet (u) gives them the epithet of "trembling": 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and failing of eyes: in looking for a vainly expected Messiah, to deliver them from all their fears and troubles: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and sorrow of mind; under their present afflictions and calamities.

 <p>
 </p><p>and at even thou shall say, would God it were morning; dreading what would happen to them in the night, that some messenger of death would be sent to dispatch them, or they should be haled out of bed to a court of inquisition, and cast into a dungeon: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which, thou shalt see; often beholding such dreadful sights, as their countrymen put upon the rack, and cruelly tortured, and then burnt alive; and so their hearts would fear and tremble, lest they should be the next that would be taken up and used in this manner; besides other severities and hard usages, with which their brethren were treated, and they in continual fear of.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_068">deu 28:68</a></font></span></p>And the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships,.... Either into a state of hard bondage and slavery, like that their fathers were in, in Egypt; or rather, strictly and literally, should be brought into Egypt again, since it is said to be "with" or "in ships". This does not respect the going of those Jews into Egypt who were left in the land of Judea, after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar; for that was against the express command of God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#013">Jer 42:13</a>. There were several movings of them into Egypt after that time; an Heathen historian (w) tells us, that not a few thousands of Jews went into Egypt and Phoenicia, because of the sedition in Syria after the death of Alexander; and where, it seems, in process of time, they became slaves: for we are told by Josephus (x), that 120,000 slaves were set free by Ptolemy Philadelphus; but what is chiefly respected here is their case in the times of the Romans, and by their means. Now when Jerusalem was taken by Titus, those above seventeen years of age were sent by him to the works, or mines, in Egypt, as the same historian relates (y); and after their last overthrow by Adrian many thousands were sold, and what could not be sold were transported into Egypt, and perished by "shipwreck", or famine, or were slaughtered by the people (z) whereby this prophecy was literally and exactly fulfilled, and which is owned by the Jews themselves. Manasseh Ben Israel (a) observes, that though Vespasian banished the Jews into various countries, Egypt is only mentioned by way of reproach, as if it had been said, ye shall go captives into the land from which ye went out triumphant: 
 <p>
 </p><p>by the way whereof I spake unto thee, thou shall see it no more again; the Targum of Jonathan is,"the Word of the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again in ships;''even the same divine Word, the Son of God, that brought them out of it, and went before them in a pillar of cloud and fire, now provoked by their rejection of him, would lead them back again thither; the paraphrast adds,"through the midst of the Red sea, in the path in which ye passed;''as if they were carried over into Egypt in ships, just in that part of the sea in which they had passed before; but that was an unknown and unseen path, after the waters were closed up, and never to be seen more, and which is here meant; for not Egypt, but the way in which they passed, was to be seen no more: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and for bondwomen, and no man shall buy you; that is, there in Egypt they would be offered to sale, and so many would be sold until the market was glutted with them, and there would be no buyers. The Targum of Jonathan is,"ye shall be sold there at first to your enemies, at a dear price, as artificers, and afterwards at a mean price as servants and handmaids, until ye become despised, and be brought to serve for nothing, and there be none to take you in.''Jarchi interprets it of they themselves being desirous, and seeking to be sold, to avoid cruelties and death; which agrees with the sense of the word, which may be rendered, "ye shall offer yourselves for sale"; but there will be no buyer, because their enemies will determine upon the slaughter and consumption of them; and to the same purpose Aben Ezra. There were such numbers of them to be sold both at Egypt and at Rome, that the sellers of them had but a poor market for them; and it seems not only because of their number, but the ill opinion had of them as servants. Hegesippus (b) says,"there were many to be sold, but there were few buyers; for the Romans despised the Jews for service, nor were there Jews left to redeem their own.''It is said (c), that thirty were sold for a penny; a just retaliation to them, who had sold their Messiah for thirty pieces of silver.
