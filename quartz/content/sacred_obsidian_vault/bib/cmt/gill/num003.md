 <p>
 </p><p>In this chapter an account is given of the genealogy of the priests and Levites, and of the gift of the Levites to the priests, of the numbering of them, and the service they were to perform; and first of the priests, the sons of Aaron, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001">Num 3:1</a>; and then of the Levites, as given unto them, to wait upon them, and assist them, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#005">Num 3:5</a>; and these were taken instead of the firstborn, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#011">Num 3:11</a>; and ordered to be numbered, which was done accordingly by their families, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#014">Num 3:14</a>; and the sum of each is given, and the particular work assigned to them; of the Gershonites, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#021">Num 3:21</a>; of the Kohathites, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027">Num 3:27</a>; of the Merarites, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#033">Num 3:33</a>; the sum total of them is given, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#039">Num 3:39</a>; then the firstborn of the children of Israel, from a month old are ordered to be numbered, and were, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#040">Num 3:40</a>; and these appearing to be more in number than the Levites, by two hundred seventy three a direction is given that the two hundred seventy three should be redeemed at the rate of five, shekels apiece, and the money paid to Aaron and his sons, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#044">Num 3:44</a>; which was accordingly done, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#049">Num 3:49</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001">Numbers 3:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">num 3:1</a></font></span></p>These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses,.... The descendants of them, those of the former, who is named first, because the eldest, were priests, and those of the latter Levites, and who are not very plainly pointed at, but are included among the Amramites, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027">Num 3:27</a>; the posterity of Moses being very obscure, only Levites, and these not particularly named but swallowed up among the Kohathites: find the following account was as it stood: 
 <p>
 </p><p>in the day that the Lord spoke with Moses in mount Sinai; and not, altogether as it then, was when he spoke to him in the wilderness, of Sinai, for then Aaron had four sons, but now two of them were dead as is after observed; and it seems to be for the sake of this circumstance chiefly that this clause is so put. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#002">Numbers 3:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">num 3:2</a></font></span></p>And these are the names of the sons of Aaron,.... The Targum of Jonathan adds, disciples of Moses, the master of the Israelites; none of the posterity of Moses being expressly, named; Jarchi observes, that the sons of Aaron are called the generations of Moses, because he taught them the law; for whoever, he says, teaches his neighbour's son, the law, the Scripture accounts of him as if he begat him, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015">Co1 4:15</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar; as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023">Exo 6:23</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#003">Numbers 3:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">num 3:3</a></font></span></p>These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests that were anointed,.... With the holy, anointing oil, with which they were anointed when, Aaron was and they only, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#030">Exo 30:30</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office; that is, whom Moses consecrated, by anointing them, putting the priest's garments on them, offering sacrifice for them, and filling their hands with sacrifices which is the phrase here used for consecration: see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#015">Exo 29:15</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#004">Numbers 3:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">num 3:4</a></font></span></p>And Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord,...., By flaming fire, as the Targum of Jonathan adds, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002">Lev 10:2</a>; and so were not alive at this time when the account of the priests and Levites was taken: 
 <p>
 </p><p>when they offered strange fire before the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai; after the tabernacle was set up, and the service of it begun, and quickly after their unction and consecration: of this strange fire; see Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001">Num 10:1</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and they had no children; which is observed, partly to show the punishment of them, and the reproach upon their names, that they died childless, and had none to succeed them in the priesthood; for as the Jewish writers (n) observe if they had left any behind them, those would have come into the office before Eleazar and Ithamar; and partly to show that all the priests in succeeding ages sprung from those next mentioned: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office, in the sight of Aaron their father; in his presence, under his inspection, and by his direction, he seeing and observing that they did everything according to the laws delivered by Moses, relating to, the office of the priesthood; or while he was yet alive, as Aben Ezra, they were concerned with him, and acted under him in the priestly office; and so the Septuagint version renders it, "with Aaron their father" (o); but a Jewish writer (p) interprets it in a different manner, "in the room of Aaron their father"; as if it respected not any conjunction with him in the then present exercise of their office in his lifetime, but their succession in it after his death; but the former seems most correct.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">num 3:5</a></font></span></p>And the Lord spake unto Moses,.... After he had given him the order for the numbering the children of Israel, and for the manner of their encampment and journeying: 
 <p>
 </p><p>saying; as follows. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#006">Numbers 3:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">num 3:6</a></font></span></p>Bring the tribe of Levi near,.... Separate them from the rest, set them apart for special service about, the sanctuary, let them have a place nearer to it than the other tribes, or offer them, that is, to the Lord, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#011">Num 8:11</a>; as well as bring them near to Aaron; so it follows: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and present them before Aaron the priest; that he may receive them as a gift unto him, as servants to wait upon him; and! that he may appoint and declare unto them their work, and set them about it: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that they may minister unto him; in guarding the tabernacle taking care of the vessels of it, taking it down, carrying it, from place to place, and setting it up as there was occasion for it. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#007">Numbers 3:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">num 3:7</a></font></span></p>And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation,.... The charge of Aaron and of all the people of Israel, which was to secure the sanctuary from being polluted or plundered: this the Levites were to be employed about, and thereby ease the high priest and the other priests, and the people, of what otherwise would have been incumbent on them: 
 <p>
 </p><p>before the tabernacle of the congregation; not within it, neither in the holy place, nor in the most holy place, where they might not enter, to do any service peculiar thereunto, but at the door of the tabernacle, and in the court of it, and in the rooms and chambers in it: and do the service of the tabernacle; not to offer sacrifices on the altar of the burnt offering, which stood in the court, and much less to burn incense on the altar of incense, and to him the lamps, and set on the shewbread in the holy place; and still less to enter into the most holy place, and do there what was to be done on the day of atonement; but to do all that is before observed, and to bring the people's offerings to the priest, and to assist in slaying them; and to keep all profane and polluted persons out of it, the tabernacle, as we find in later times; they were porters at it, and some of them were singers in it, and had the care of various things belonging to it: see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#014">Ch1 9:14</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#008">Numbers 3:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">num 3:8</a></font></span></p>And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation,.... Take care of them that none be lost or come to any damage, especially while it was moving, and carried from place to place; then the several parts of it, as well as the vessels in it, were committed to their care and charge, the particulars of which see in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#025">Num 3:25</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#007">Num 3:7</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#009">Numbers 3:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">num 3:9</a></font></span></p>And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons,.... To be their ministers and servants: 
 <p>
 </p><p>they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel: even all of them entirely, none excepted; the whole tribe which were not in the priestly office; those were separated from the rest of the tribes of Israel, and appointed for the service of the priests: or they were "given, given" (q); which is repeated not only to show that they were wholly given, as we render it, but to denote the certainty of it, that they were really given; and especially to declare the freeness of the gift; the priests had them as free gifts, nor did they pay them any thing for, their service; they were maintained another way, namely, by the tithes of the people; and indeed the priests received a tithe out of the tithe of the Levites; so far were they from contributing any thing to their support, or in consideration of the service they did them.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#010">Numbers 3:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">num 3:10</a></font></span></p>And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons,.... To the priestly office; this was done before, but is renewed for the confirmation of it, and repeated to put them in mind of it, that they be careful to execute it, as follows: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and they shall wait on their priest's office, to do what was peculiar to it, both in the holy and in the most holy place, at the altar, and within, the vail, where the Levites had nothing to do; and this is observed that the priests might take notice, that by the gift of the Levites to them, they were not excused from doing any part of service which was proper to them as priests; for they were given them that they might more readily attend their office, and be wholly employed in it; just as, under the Gospel dispensation, deacons were appointed to take care of the secular affairs of the church, that the apostles might give up themselves to the word of God and prayer, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002">Act 6:2</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death; that comes nigh to perform any part of the priest's office peculiar to him as to offer sacrifice, burn incense, &amp;c. whether he be a common Israelite, or even a Levite, as Korah was; any that was not a priest was reckoned a stranger, and so to be put to death for intruding into the office, as the above mentioned person was: so Aben Ezra interprets it of anyone that came nigh to a priest, to be with him or join with him in the execution of his office, whether an Israelite or a Levite, he shall die: the Targum of Jonathan adds, by flaming fire before the Lord. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#011">Numbers 3:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">num 3:11</a></font></span></p>And the Lord spake unto Moses,.... Continued to speak unto him, and give him the reason of his appointing the Levites to minister to the priests and serve the tabernacle: 
 <p>
 </p><p>saying: as follows. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#012">Numbers 3:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">num 3:12</a></font></span></p>And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel,.... Separated them from others, and set them apart for the service of the sanctuary; this was his own act and deed, and which he did of his own will and pleasure, who is a sovereign Being, and might and would do whatsoever he pleased, nor should any object unto him, or contradict him: and this he did: 
 <p>
 </p><p>instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel; he made an exchange of those for the Levites; upon the destruction of the firstborn of Egypt, and saving the firstborn of Israel, he claimed the latter as his own in a special sense, and now he gave up his right to them, and instead thereof took the Levites; nor could the people of Israel reasonably object to this, nor be uneasy at it, but rather be pleased with it; since hereby they were not only freed from the charge of redeeming their firstborn, but since they were the Lord's, he might have appointed them to be servants to the priests; and every Israelite would choose rather, no doubt, to part with a tribe for this service than to have their firstborn sons employed in it; and there were none so fit as the tribe of Levi, not only because it was a small tribe, but because the priests were of this tribe, to whom they were to minister; and therefore as there was a connection between them, the Levites would readily serve them: it is a notion that has obtained both among Jews and Christians, that the firstborn before this time were priests in the family, but now the Levites were taken in their room; and Jarchi particularly observes, that when the firstborn sinned in the business of the calf, they were rejected, and the Levites, who did not commit idolatry, were chosen in their room; but it does not appear, before the fixing the priesthood in Aaron's family, that the firstborn in a family were priests, and officiated as such, but rather the father and head of the family for the whole, or everyone for himself, as in Adam's family, he and his two sons; and moreover, it was a recent thing, and only among the Hebrews, that the firstborn were in a peculiar manner the Lord's, not as priests, only to be redeemed, and now the Levites were redeemed in their room; it was not to be priests, but the servants of the priests (r): 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>therefore the Levites shall be mine; whom he gave to the priests to assist them in their work, which was for him and his glory. 
 </p><p>

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#013">Numbers 3:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">num 3:13</a></font></span></p>Because all the firstborn are mine,.... Not merely in a general way, as all creatures are his, but in a special manner as his own, and that for the following reason: 
 <p>
 </p><p>for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,  
 </p><p>
 </p><p>I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast; that is, sanctified or set them apart as his own special property, or ordered the people of Israel so to do, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002">Exo 13:2</a>; for as when he destroyed the firstborn of the Egyptians, he saved the firstborn of Israel, he had a special claim upon them as his; and though it was in the night when he destroyed the firstborn of Egypt, yet it was the night which preceded that day, and was a part of that day, even the fifteenth of Nisan, when the instructions were given to sanctify all the firstborn; though, as Aben Ezra observes, "day" signifies "time", so that it was at or about the same time that the one and the other were done: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>mine they shall be; this was declared when they were ordered to be sanctified to him, but now they were to be exchanged for the Levites: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>I am the Lord; who have sovereign power to do as he would in claiming the firstborn, and then in exchanging them for the Levites, and appointing the Levites to minister to the priests, and serve in the tabernacle. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#014">Numbers 3:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">num 3:14</a></font></span></p>And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai,.... At the same time he gave the order, and made the declaration before mentioned, and in the place where now the children of Israel were, and from whence they shortly removed: 
 <p>
 </p><p>saying; as follows. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#015">Numbers 3:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">num 3:15</a></font></span></p>Number the children of Levi,.... Who were left out of the general muster of the children of Israel, but now were to be numbered alone, and in a different manner, and for, a different purpose, the Lord having a special regard auto, them, and special service for them: 
 <p>
 </p><p>after the house of their fathers, by their families; into which the tribe was divided; house seems to be put for "houses", which were principal ones; and these were divided into families, which branched from them, and according to these, denominated from their fathers, and not their, mothers, were they to be numbered; for as the Jewish writers often say, a mother's family is no family; wherefore, if a Levite woman married into any other tribe, as she might, her, descendants were not taken into this accounts only such whose fathers were Levites, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#002">Num 1:2</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>every male from a month old and upwards shalt thou number them; the reason of this was, because the firstborn, for whom they were to be exchanged, were at a month old claimed by the Lord as his, and to be redeemed; and as this numbering was on, another account than, that of the children of Israel, who were numbered from twenty years of age and upwards, that they might on occasion be called out to war, from which the Levites were exempted, and the numbering of them was for the service of the sanctuary; so from their youth they were to be brought up and trained for this, that they might be fit for it, and enter upon it at a proper age. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#016">Numbers 3:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">num 3:16</a></font></span></p>And Moses numbered them according to the word of the Lord,.... Took the account of all of a month old in the several houses and families of the tribe of Levi; though Moses is only here mentioned, yet it seems from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#039">Num 3:39</a>; that Aaron was concerned with him in it; yea, in an after numbering of the Levites who were fit for business from thirty to fifty years of age, the chief of the children of Israel were assisting to him and Aaron, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#046">Num 4:46</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>as he commanded; he was obedient to the divine will in all things, and so in this, though it was his own tribe and his own posterity, which in all successive ages were to be no other than ministering servants to the priests, and to have no inheritance in the land of Israel. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#017">Numbers 3:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">num 3:17</a></font></span></p>And these were the sons of Levi, by their names,.... The immediate offspring and descendants of that patriarch: 
 <p>
 </p><p>Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; these went down with him into Egypt, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#011">Gen 46:11</a>.

 <p>
 </p><p>Libni and Shimei; and who are elsewhere mentioned as his sons, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#017">Exo 6:17</a>; and from hence were the families of the Libnites and Shimites, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#021">Num 3:21</a>.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the cords of it; which seem to be the cords of the court, which fastened the hangings and curtains to brass pins, or stakes fixed in the ground to keep them tight, that the wind might not move them to and fro; but Jarchi says, these were the cords of the tabernacle and tent, and not of the court; and indeed the tabernacle had its cords as well as the court, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#018">Exo 38:18</a>; the cords of the court were in the charge of the Merarites, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#037">Num 3:37</a>,

 </p><p>
 </p><p>keeping the charge of the sanctuary, for the charge of the children of Israel; either in their room and stead, which otherwise they must have kept; or rather for their safety and security, keeping out all persons from entering into the sanctuary, who had no business there, that they died not, as it follows: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death; that is, whoever came nigh to enter into the holy place, and did, who was no priest, though an Israelite, and even a Levite, or into the most holy place, excepting the high priest, it was death unto him, either by the civil magistrate, or by the hand of heaven; so the Targum of Jonathan.

 <p>
 </p><p>numbered at the commandment of the Lord, throughout their families,.... Whence it appears, that Moses was not alone, but Aaron with him, in numbering the Levites, and that by the appointment of the Lord. The word "Aaron", in the Hebrew text, has a dot on every letter, for what reason it is not certain; the word itself is left out in the Samaritan and Syriac versions: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>all the males, from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand; 22,000 men; but by putting the sums together they amount to three hundred more; for of the Gershonites there were 7,500, and of the Kohathites 8,600, and of the Merarites 6,200, in all 22,300; which difficulty some endeavour to remove by saying, as Aben Ezra observes, that the Scripture takes a short way, mentioning the thousands, and leaving out the hundreds but this, he says, is not right, nor is it the way of the Scripture in this chapter: and in an after account of the firstborn of the Israelites, not only the hundreds are mentioned, but the broken number of seventy three. Others think there is a corruption crept into the text somewhere in the particular numbers, through the inadvertency of some copyist; and suppose it to be in the number of the Kohathites, where they fancy  six, is put instead of  three: but there is no occasion to suppose either of these, for which there is no foundation, since the reason why three hundred are left out in the sum total may be, because there were so many firstborn among the Levites, and these could not be exchanged for the firstborn of the other tribes; they, as such, being the Lord's, and one firstborn could not redeem another; and so it is said in the Talmud (t), these three hundred were firstborn, and there is no firstborn redeems a firstborn, or frees from the redemption price of five shekels.

Or "for the firstborn", as the Vulgate Latin version renders it, and so the Hebrew particle is sometimes used (u); for children of a month old or little more could not pay the money, but their parents for them, which was paid by them, and Moses received it for the superfluous number of two hundred seventy three; but it is a matter of doubt of whom this was exacted, and by whom paid, and who could be reckoned as this superfluous number, unless they were the last two hundred seventy three that were numbered: some have thought this was paid out of the public stock, which was a ready way of doing it, but whether reasonable is not so manifest, since these firstborn were the properties of particular persons; the more commonly received method of doing it with the Jewish writers was, according to Jarchi and Abarbinel, and so in the Talmud (w) by lot; the former of which describes the manner of doing it thus, 22,000 pieces (of paper or parchment) were brought, and on them written, "a son of Levi", or "a Levite", and two hundred seventy three other pieces, and on them were written, "five shekels"; these were mixed together and put into an urn or box, and then they were bid to come and take out the pieces, and according as the lot was, they were allowed as redeemed by the Levites, or paid the redemption money: and as this was a method much in use with the Hebrews, it is not improbable: 
 <p>
 </p><p>a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; 1,365 shekels, which is exactly the number of shekels that two hundred seventy three should pay, reckoning five shekels per head; which Jarchi counts thus, for two hundred firstborn, a thousand shekels; for seventy firstborn, three hundred fifty; and for three firstborn fifteen, shekels, which in all amounted to about an hundred seventy pounds of our money.

That were redeemed this way, and not by Levites, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#049">Num 3:49</a>, but by money, paying five shekels a head: 
 <p>
 </p><p>unto Aaron and his sons; to whom the Levites were given; and this money, as a recompence for the deficiency of the number of them, to answer to the firstborn exchanged for them: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>according to the word of the Lord; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#048">Num 3:48</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>as the Lord commanded Moses; so did he, being a faithful servant in all things in the house of God; he did not convert it to his own use, or to any other use than to what God had appointed it.
