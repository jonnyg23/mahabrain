 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001">Isaiah Chapter 32</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001">Isaiah 32:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 32:1</a></font></span></p>Behold - This seems to be a distinct prophecy from the former, and delivered before that which is related in the former chapters. The prophecies are not always set down in that order, in which the prophets delivered them. The foregoing prophecy was delivered, not in the time of Ahaz for he sent to the Assyrian, not the Egyptian, for help; it was Hezekiah, who rebelled against the king of Assyria, and was too prone to trust upon the staff of Egypt. But this seems to have been delivered in the time of Ahaz. A king - Hezekiah, a type of Christ, and Christ typified by him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002">Isaiah 32:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 32:2</a></font></span></p>A man - Each of his princes. A hiding place - Unto the people under their government. The wind - From the rage and violence of evil men. As rivers - No less refreshing. As the shadow - In a dry and scorched country, which is called weary, because it makes travellers weary; as death is called pale in other authors, because it makes mens faces pale. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#003">Isaiah 32:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 32:3</a></font></span></p>The eyes - The people, they shall not shut their eyes and ears against the good counsels and examples of their religious king and rulers, as they have done formerly: both princes and people shall be reformed. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#004">Isaiah 32:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 32:4</a></font></span></p>The rash - Who were hasty in judging of things; which is an argument of ignorance and folly. The tongue - That used to speak of the things of God, darkly, and doubtfully; which though it was in part fulfilled in Hezekiah, yet was truly and fully accomplished only by Christ, who wrought this wonderful change in an innumerable company both of Jews and Gentiles. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#005">Isaiah 32:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 32:5</a></font></span></p>The vile - Base and worthless men. Liberal - Shall no longer be reputed honourable, because of their high and honourable places, but wickedness shall be discovered where ever it is, and virtue manifested and rewarded. The churl - The sordid and covetous man; but under this one vice, all vices are understood, as under the opposite virtue of bountifulness; all virtues are comprehended. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#006">Isaiah 32:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">isa 32:6</a></font></span></p>Villainy - Men shall no longer be miscalled; for every one will discover what he is by his words and actions. Will work - He will, from time to time, be advising wickedness, that he may execute it when he hath opportunity. To practise - To do bad things, tho' with a pretence of religion and justice. To utter - To pass unjust sentence, directly contrary to the command of God. Cause the drink - Whereby they take away the bread and the drink of the poor. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#007">Isaiah 32:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">isa 32:7</a></font></span></p>Lying words - With false and unrighteous decrees. Even - When their cause is just and good. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#009">Isaiah 32:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">isa 32:9</a></font></span></p>Ye - That indulge yourselves in idleness and luxury. Careless - Who are insensible of your sin and danger. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010">Isaiah 32:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">isa 32:10</a></font></span></p>The vintage shall fail - During the time of the Assyrian invasion. The gathering - Of the other fruits of the earth. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#011">Isaiah 32:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">isa 32:11</a></font></span></p>Strip - Put off your ornaments. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#012">Isaiah 32:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">isa 32:12</a></font></span></p>The teats - For the pleasant and fruitful fields, which like teats yielded you plentiful and excellent nourishment. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013">Isaiah 32:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">isa 32:13</a></font></span></p>Yea - Upon that ground, where now your houses stand, in which you take your fill of mirth and pleasure. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#014">Isaiah 32:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">isa 32:14</a></font></span></p>Forsaken - Of God, and given up into their enemies hands. A joy - Desolate places, in which wild asses delight to be. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015">Isaiah 32:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">isa 32:15</a></font></span></p>Until - Until the time come, in which God will pour, or, as the Hebrew word properly signifies, reveal, evidently and plentifully pour out his spirit from heaven upon his people, which was fully accomplished in the days of the Messiah. The fruitful field - God's people who were desolate, shall be revived and flourish, and their flourishing enemies shall be brought to destruction. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#016">Isaiah 32:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">isa 32:16</a></font></span></p>Judgment - Just judgment. Righteousness - Justice shall be executed in all the parts of the land. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017">Isaiah 32:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">isa 32:17</a></font></span></p>The work - The effect of this shall be prosperity. Quietness - Tranquility, both of mind and outward estate. Assurance - Of God's mercy, and the fulfilling of his promises. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#019">Isaiah 32:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">isa 32:19</a></font></span></p>It shall hail - As my blessings shall be poured down upon my people, who, from a wilderness, are turned into a fruitful field, so my judgments (which are signified by hail, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#002">Isa 28:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017">Isa 28:17</a>, and elsewhere) shall fall upon them, who were a fruitful field, but are turned into a forest, upon the unbelieving and rebellious Jews. The city - Jerusalem, which, though now it was the seat of God's worship and people, yet he foresaw, would be the great enemy of the Messiah. Low - Heb. shall be humbled with humiliation: shall be greatly humbled, or brought very low. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#020">Isaiah 32:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">isa 32:20</a></font></span></p>Blessed - As the barren forest shall be destroyed, so the fruitful field shall be improved, and bring forth much fruit; which is signified by a declaration of the blessedness of them that sow in it. Waters - In all moist grounds, which are like to yield good fruit. But this also is to be understood of the times of the gospel, and of the great and happy success of the ministers of it. The ox - Which they employed in plowing and sowing the ground.
