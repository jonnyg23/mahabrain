 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jdg 19:12</a></font></span></p>A stranger - That is, of a strange nation: which the Canaanites possess; for though the city Jerusalem had been taken by Caleb, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008">Jdg 1:8</a>, yet the strong fort of Zion was still in their hands, whence it is likely they did much molest, and afterwards by God's permission, drive out the Israelites who dwelt there. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#015">Judges 19:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">jdg 19:15</a></font></span></p>To lodge - Though they were soft and effeminate in other respects, yet they were hard - hearted to strangers, and at that time there were no public - houses in that country.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">jdg 19:16</a></font></span></p>Ephraim - Whence also the Levite was, which enclined him to shew the more kindness to his country - man.

Thither he went, either because he lived there, for that was in the tribe of Ephraim; or, rather, because he would there offer prayers and praises, and sacrifices to God, for his mercy in reconciling him and his wife. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#020">Judges 19:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">jdg 19:20</a></font></span></p>Let all, &amp;c. - It matters not whether thou wantest nothing or everything, I will take care to supply all thy wants. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#021">Judges 19:21</a></p>

Thus the sin she formerly chose, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#002">Jdg 19:2</a>, is now her destruction; and though her husband pardoned her, God would punish her, at least as to this life. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#029">Judges 19:29</a></p>
