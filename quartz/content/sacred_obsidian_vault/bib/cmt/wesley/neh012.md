 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001">Nehemiah Chapter 12</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001">Nehemiah 12:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">neh 12:1</a></font></span></p>Priests - The chief of the priests, the heads of those twenty four courses which David appointed by divine direction, 1Ch. 24:1-19. And whereas there were twenty four, and here but twenty - two, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012">Neh 12:12</a>, &amp;c. only twenty, the reason of this difference may be, because two of the twenty four courses were extinct in Babylon, and two of the persons here named, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#002">Neh 12:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#005">Neh 12:5</a>, Hattush, and Maadiah, may be omitted in the account of the posterity of these, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012">Neh 12:12</a>, &amp;c. because they had no posterity. Ezra - Either this was another Ezra, or if it were the same mentioned <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001">Ezr 7:1</a>, he lived to a great age; which may well be supposed, considering his great sobriety, and his great piety to which God promised long life, and withal the special providence of God continuing him so long in such a season, wherein the church of God did greatly need his help and counsel. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#008">Nehemiah 12:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">neh 12:8</a></font></span></p>Moreover, &amp;c. - He was to see, that the psalms of thanksgiving were continually sung in the temple, in due time and manner. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#010">Nehemiah 12:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">neh 12:10</a></font></span></p>Jeshua - Here follows a catalogue of the Jewish high - priests; which was the more necessary, because their times were now to be measured, not by the years of their kings as formerly, but by their high - priests. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012">Nehemiah 12:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">neh 12:12</a></font></span></p>Priests - As their fathers were priests in the days of Joshua, so in the days of Joiakim the son of Joshua, the sons of those persons executed the priesthood in their father's steads, some of their fathers probably being yet living, and many of them dead. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022">Nehemiah 12:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">neh 12:22</a></font></span></p>Darius - Darius Noehus; and so this Jaddua might be father to him who was in the days of Darius Codomanus, and of Alexander the Great. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#027">Nehemiah 12:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">neh 12:27</a></font></span></p>The wall - Of the city itself, which is here dedicated to God, and to his honour and service, not only upon a general account, by which we ought to devote ourselves, and all that is ours, to God; but upon a more special ground, because this was a place which God himself had chosen, and sanctified by his temple and gracious presence, and therefore did of right belong to him; whence it is often called the holy city. And they restored it to God by this dedication, withal imploring the presence, and favour, and blessing of to this city by solemn prayers, and praises, and sacrifices, wherewith this dedication was accompanied. Places - To which they were now retired after that great and general assembly, chap. 8, 9, &amp; 10. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001">Neh 8:1</a> &amp;c. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#030">Nehemiah 12:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">neh 12:30</a></font></span></p>Purified themselves - They that would be instrumental to sanctify others, must sanctify themselves, and set themselves apart for God, with purity of mind and sincerity of intention. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#031">Nehemiah 12:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">neh 12:31</a></font></span></p>Princes - And half of the people with them. The wall - For the wall was broad and strong, and so ordered that men might conveniently walk upon it. Right hand - Towards the south and east. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#039">Nehemiah 12:39</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_039">neh 12:39</a></font></span></p>Stood still - Waiting, as also their brethren did, that they might go together in due order into God's house, there to perfect the solemnity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#043">Nehemiah 12:43</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_043">neh 12:43</a></font></span></p>The children rejoiced - And their hosanna's were not despised, but are recorded to their praise. All that share in public mercies, ought to join in public thanksgivings. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044">Nehemiah 12:44</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_044">neh 12:44</a></font></span></p>Rejoiced - For the eminent gifts and graces which they observed in many of them: for the great benefit which they had now received by their ministry: and for the competent provision which hereby was made for them, that so they might wholly wait upon their office. The sure way for ministers to gain an interest, in the affections of their people, is to wait on their ministry, to spend their whole time, and thought, and strength therein. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#045">Nehemiah 12:45</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_045">neh 12:45</a></font></span></p>The ward - That ward, or charge, which God had prescribed to them. And in particular the charge of purification, of taking care that no unclean person or thing should enter into the house or courts of the Lord. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#047">Nehemiah 12:47</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_047">neh 12:47</a></font></span></p>Sanctified - They set apart the first - fruits and tithes from their own share, and devoted them to the use of the Levites. And so did the Levites by the tithe of the tithes. Thus they all conscientiously paid their dues, and did not profane those things which God had sanctified, nor take them into their own common use. When what is contributed for the support of religion, is given with an eye to God, it is sanctified, and will cause the blessing to rest upon the house, and all that is therein.
