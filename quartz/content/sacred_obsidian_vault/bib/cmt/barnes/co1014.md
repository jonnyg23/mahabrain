 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_000">co1 14:0</a></font></span></p>
 <p>This chapter is a continuation of the subject commenced in 1 Cor. 12 and pursued through <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001">Co1 13:1-13</a>. In 1 Cor. 12 Paul had entered on the discussion of the various endowments which the Holy Spirit confers on Christians, and had shown that these endowments were bestowed in a different degree on different individuals, and yet so as to promote in the best way the edification of the church. It was proper, he said <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031">Co1 12:31</a>, to desire the more eminent of these endowments, and yet there was one gift of the Spirit of more value than all others, which might be obtained by all, and which should be an object of desire to all. That was love; and to show the nature, power, and value of this, was the design of the thirteenth chapter, certainly one of the most tender and beautiful portions of the Bible. In this chapter the subject is continued with special reference to the subject of "prophecy," as being the most valuable of the miraculous endowments, or the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit.
 </p><p>In doing this, it was necessary to correct an erroneous estimate which they had placed on the power of speaking foreign languages. They had prized this, perhaps, because it gave them importance in the eyes of the pagan. And in proportion as they valued this, they undervalued the gift of being able to edify the church by speaking in a known and intelligible language. To correct this misapprehension; to show the relative value of these endowments, and especially to recommend the gift of "prophecy" as the more useful and desirable of the gifts of the Spirit, was the leading design of this chapter. In doing this, Paul first directs them to seek for charity. He also recommends to them, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031">Co1 12:31</a>, to desire spiritual endowments, and of these endowments especially to desire prophecy; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001">Co1 14:1</a>. He then proceeds to set forth the advantage of speaking in intelligible language, or of speaking so that the church may be edified, by the following considerations, which comprise the chapter:
 </p><p>1. The advantage of being understood, and of speaking for the edification of the church; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002">Co1 14:2-5</a>.
 </p><p>2. No man could be useful to the church except he delivered that which was understood, any more than the sound of a trumpet in times of war would be useful, unless it were so sounded as to be understood by the army; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006">Co1 14:6-11</a>.
 </p><p>3. It was the duty of all to seek to edify the church; and if a man could speak in an unknown tongue, it was his duty also to seek to be able to interpret what he said; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#012">Co1 14:12-15</a>.
 </p><p>4. The use of tongues would produce embarrassment and confusion, since those who heard them speak would be ignorant of what was said, and be unable to join in the devotions; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016">Co1 14:16-17</a>.
 </p><p>5. Though Paul himself was more signally endowed than any of them, yet he prized far more highly the power of promoting the edification of the church, though he uttered but five words, if they were understood, than all the power which he possessed of speaking foreign languages; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#018">Co1 14:18-19</a>.
 </p><p>6. This sentiment illustrated from the Old Testament; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020">Co1 14:20-21</a>.
 </p><p>7. The real use of the power of speaking foreign languages was to be a sign to unbelievers, an evidence that the religion was from God, and not to be used among those who were already Christians; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022">Co1 14:22</a>.
 </p><p>8. The effect of their all speaking with tongues would be to produce confusion and disorder, and disgust among observers, and the conviction that they were deranged; but the effect of order, and of speaking intelligibly, would be to convince and convert them; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#023">Co1 14:23-25</a>.
 </p><p>9. The apostle then gives rules in regard to the proper conduct of those who were able to speak foreign languages; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026">Co1 14:26-32</a>.
 </p><p>10. The great rule was, that order was to be observed, and that God was the author of peace; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033">Co1 14:33</a>.
 </p><p>11. The apostle then gives a positive direction that on no pretence are women to be allowed to speak in the church, even though they should claim to be inspired; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034">Co1 14:34-35</a>.
 </p><p>12. He then required all to submit to his authority, and to admit that what he had spoken was from the Lord; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#036">Co1 14:36-37</a>. And then,
 </p><p>13. Concludes with directing them to desire to prophesy, and not to forbid speaking with tongues on proper occasions, but to do all things in decency and order; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#038">Co1 14:38-40</a>, 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001">1 Corinthians 14:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">co1 14:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Follow after charity - Pursue love <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001">Co1 13:1</a>; that is, earnestly desire it; strive to possess it; make it the object of your anxious and constant solicitude to obtain it, and to be influenced by it always. Cultivate it in your own hearts, as the richest and best endowment of the Holy Spirit, and endeavor to diffuse its happy influence on all around you.
 </p><p>And desire spiritual gifts - I do not forbid you, while you make the possession of love your great object, and while you do not make the desire of spiritual gifts the occasion of envy or strife, to desire the miraculous endowments of the Spirit and to seek to excel in those endowments which he imparts; see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031">Co1 12:31</a>. The main thing was to cultivate a spirit of love. Yet it was not improper also to desire to be so endowed as to promote their highest usefulness in the church. On the phrase "spiritual gifts," see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001">Co1 12:1</a>.
 </p><p>But rather that ye may prophesy - But especially, or particularly desire to be qualified for the office of prophesying. The apostle does not mean to say that prophecy is to be preferred to love or charity; but that, of the spiritual gifts which it was proper for them to desire and seek, prophecy was the most valuable. That is, they were not most earnestly and especially to desire to be able to speak foreign languages or to work miracles; but they were to desire to be qualified to speak in a manner that would be edifying to the church. They would naturally, perhaps, most highly prize the power of working miracles and of speaking foreign languages. The object of this chapter is to show them that the ability to speak in a plain, clear, instructive manner, so as to edify the church and convince sinners, was a more valuable endowment than the power of working miracles, or the power of speaking foreign languages.
 </p><p>On the meaning of the word "prophesy," see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#006">Rom 11:6</a>. To what is said there on the nature of this office, it seems necessary only to add an idea suggested by Prof. Robinson (Greek and English Lexicon, under the article, Προφήτης  Prophētēs), that the prophets were distinguished from the teachers (διδάσκαλοι  didaskaloi), "in that, while the latter spoke in a calm, connected, didactic discourse adapted to instruct and enlighten the hearers, the prophet spoke more from the impulse of sudden inspiration, from the light of a sudden revelation at the moment (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#030">Co1 14:30</a>, ἀποκάλυφθη  apokalupthē), and his discourse was probably more adapted, by means of powerful exhortation, to awaken the feelings and conscience of the hearers." The idea of speaking from "revelation," he adds, seems to be fundamental to the correct idea of the nature of the prophecy here referred to. Yet the communications of the prophets were always in the vernacular tongue, and were always in intelligible language, and in this respect different from the endowments of those who spoke foreign languages.
 </p><p>The same truth might be spoken by both; the influence of the Spirit was equally necessary in both; both were inspired; and both answered important ends in the establishment and edification of the church. The gift of tongues, however, as it was the most striking and remarkable, and probably the most rare, was most highly prized and coveted. The object of Paul here is, to show that it was really an endowment of less value, and should be less desired by Christians than the gift of prophetic instruction, or the ability to edify the church in language intelligible and understood by all, under the immediate influences of the Holy Spirit. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002">1 Corinthians 14:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">co1 14:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue - This verse is designed to show that the faculty of speaking intelligibly, and to the edification of the church, is of more value than the power of speaking a foreign language. The reason is, that however valuable may be the endowment in itself, and however important the truth which he may utter, yet it is as if he spoke to God only. No one could understand him.
 </p><p>Speaketh not unto men - Does not speak so that people can understand him. His address is really not made to people, that is, to the church. He might have this faculty without being able to speak to the edification of the church. It is possible that the power of speaking foreign languages and of prophesying were sometimes united in the same person; but it is evident that the apostle speaks of them as different endowments, and they probably were found usually in different individuals.
 </p><p>But unto God - It is as if he spoke to God. No one could understand him but God. This must evidently refer to the addresses "in the church," when Christians only were present, or when those only were present who spoke the same language, and who were unacquainted with foreign tongues. Paul says that "there" that faculty would be valueless compared with the power of speaking in a manner that should edify the church. He did not undervalue the power of speaking foreign languages when foreigners were present, or when they went to preach to foreigners; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022">Co1 14:22</a>. It was only when it was needless, when all present spoke one language, that he speaks of it as of comparatively little value.
 </p><p>For no man understandeth him - That is, no man in the church, since they all spoke the same language, and that language was different from what was spoken by him who was endowed with the gift of tongues. As God only could know the import of what he said, it would be lost upon the church, and would be useless.
 </p><p>Howbeit in the Spirit - Although, by the aid of the Spirit, he should, in fact, deliver the most important and sublime truths. This would doubtless be the case, that those who were thus endowed would deliver most important truths, but they would be "lost" upon those who heard them, because they could not understand them. The phrase "in the Spirit," evidently means "by the Holy Spirit," that is, by his aid and influence. Though he should be "really" under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and though the important truth which he delivers should be imparted by his aid, yet all would be valueless unless it were understood by the church.
 </p><p>He speaketh mysteries - For the meaning of the word "mystery," see Note, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007">Co1 2:7</a>. The word here seems to be synonymous with sublime and elevated truth; truth that was not before known, and that might be of the utmost importance. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003">1 Corinthians 14:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">co1 14:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>But he that prophesieth - See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001">Co1 14:1</a>. He that speaks under the influence of inspiration in the common language of his hearers. This seems to be the difference between those who spoke in foreign languages and those who prophesied. Both were under the influence of the Holy Spirit; both might speak the same truths; both might occupy an equally important and necessary place in the church; but the language of the one was intelligible to the church, the other not; the one was designed to edify the church, the other to address those who spoke foreign tongues, or to give demonstration, by the power of speaking foreign languages, that the religion was from God.
 </p><p>Speaketh unto men - So as to be understood by those who were present.
 </p><p>To edification - See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008">Co1 10:8</a>, note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#023">Co1 10:23</a>. Speaks so as to enlighten and strengthen the church.
 </p><p>And exhortation - See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008">Rom 12:8</a>. He applies and enforces the practical duties of religion, and urges motives for a holy life.
 </p><p>And comfort - Encouragement. That is, he presents the promises and the "hopes" of the gospel; the various considerations adapted to administer comfort in the time of trial. The other might do this, but it would be in a foreign language, and would be useless to the church. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#004">1 Corinthians 14:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">co1 14:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Edifieth himself - That is, the truths which are communicated to him by the Spirit, and which he utters in an unknown language, may be valuable, and may be the means of strengthening his faith, and building him up in the hopes of the gospel, but they can he of no use to others. His own holy affections might be excited by the truths which he would deliver, and the consciousness of possessing miraculous powers might excite his gratitude. And yet, as Doddridge has well remarked, there might be danger that a man might be injured by this gift when exercised in this ostentatious manner. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#005">1 Corinthians 14:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">co1 14:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>I would that ye all spake with tongues - "It is an important endowment, and is not, in its place, to be undervalued. It maybe of great service in the cause of truth, and if properly regulated, and not abused, I would rejoice if these extraordinary endowments were conferred on all. I have no envy against anyone who possesses it; no opposition to the endowment; but I wish that it should not be overvalued; and would wish to exalt into proper estimation the more useful but humble gift of speaking for the edification of the church."
 </p><p>Greater is he that prophesieth - This gift is of more value, and he really occupies a more elevated rank in the church. He is more "useful." The idea here is, that talents are not to he estimated by their "brilliancy," but by their "usefulness." The power of speaking in an unknown tongue was certainly a more striking endowment than that of speaking so as simply to be "useful," and yet the apostle tells us that the latter is the more valuable. So it is always. A man who is useful, however humble and unknown he may be, really occupies a more elevated and venerable rank than the man of most splendid talents and dazzling eloquence, who accomplishes nothing in saving the souls of people.
 </p><p>Except he interpret - However important and valuable the truth might he which he uttered, it would be useless to the church, unless he should explain it in language which they could understand. In that case, the apostle does not deny that the power of speaking foreign languages was a higher endowment and more valuable than the gift of prophecy. That the man who spoke foreign languages had the power of interpreting, is evident from this verse. From <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027">Co1 14:27</a>, it appears that the office of interpreting was sometimes performed by others. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006">1 Corinthians 14:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">co1 14:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Now, brethren, if I come unto you ... - The truth which the apostle had been illustrating in an abstract manner, he proceeds to illustrate by applying it to himself. If he should come among them speaking foreign languages, it could be of no use unless it were interpreted to them.
 </p><p>Speaking with tongues - Speaking foreign languages; that is, speaking them "only," without any interpreter. Paul had the power of speaking foreign languages <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#018">Co1 14:18</a>; but he did not use this power for ostentation or display, but merely to communicate the gospel to those who did not understand his native tongue.
 </p><p>Either by revelation - Macknight renders this, "speak intelligibly;" that is, as he explains it, "by the revelation peculiar to an apostle." Doddridge, "by the revelation of some gospel doctrine and mystery." Locke interprets it, that you might understand the revelation, or knowledge," etc.; but says in a note, that we cannot now certainly understand the difference between the meaning of the four words here used. "It is sufficient," says he, "to know that these reruns stand for some intelligible discourse tending to the edification of the church." Rosenmuller supposes the word "revelation" stands for some "clear and open knowledge of any truth arising from meditation." It is probable that the word here does not refer to divine inspiration, as it usually does, but that it stands opposed to that which is unknown and unintelligible, as that which is "revealed" ἀποκαλύψις  apokalupsis stands opposed to what is unknown, concealed, "hidden," obscure. Here, therefore, it is synonymous, perhaps, with "explained." "What shall it profit, unless that which I speak be brought out of the obscurity and darkness of a foreign language, and uncovered or explained!" The original sense of the word "revelation" here is, I suppose, intended ἀποκαλύψις  apokalupsis, from ἀποκαλύπτω  apokaluptō, "to uncover"), and means that the sense should be uncovered, that is, explained or what was spoken could not be of value.
 </p><p>Or by knowledge - By making it intelligible. By so explaining it as to make it understood. Knowledge here stands opposed to the "ignorance" and "obscurity" which would attend a communication in a foreign language.
 </p><p>Or by prophesying - See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001">Co1 14:1</a>. That is, unless it be communicated, through interpretation, in the manner in which the prophetic teachers spoke; that is, made intelligible, and explained, and actually brought down to the usual characteristics of communications made in their own language.
 </p><p>Or by doctrine - By teaching (διδαχῇ  didachē). By instruction; in the usual mode of plain and familiar instruction. The sense of this passage, therefore, is clear. Though Paul should utter among them, as he had abundant ability to do, the most weighty and important truths, yet, unless he interpreted what he said in a manner clear from obscurity, like "revelation;" or intelligibly, and so as to constitute "knowledge;" or in the manner that the prophets spoke, in a plain and intelligible manner; or in the manner usual in simple and plain "instruction," it would be useless to them. The perplexities of commentators may be seen stated in Locke, Bloomfield, and Doddridge. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#007">1 Corinthians 14:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">co1 14:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Things without life - Instruments of music.
 </p><p>Whether pipe - This instrument (αὐλὸς  aulos) was usually made of reeds, and probably had a resemblance to a flageolet.
 </p><p>Or harp - This instrument (κιθάρα  kithara) was a stringed instrument, and was made in the same way as a modern harp. It usually had ten strings, and was struck with the plectrum, or with a key. It was commonly employed in praise.
 </p><p>Except they give a distinction in the sounds - Unless they give a difference in the "tones," such as are indicated in the gamut for music.
 </p><p>How shall it be known ... - That is, there would be no time, no music. Nothing would be indicated by it. It would not be suited to excite the emotions of sorrow or of joy. All music is designed to excite emotions; but if there be no difference in the tones, no emotion would be produced. So it would be in words uttered. Unless there was something that was suited to excite thought or emotion; unless what was spoken was made "intelligible," no matter how important in itself it might be, yet it would be useless. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#008">1 Corinthians 14:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">co1 14:8</a></font></span></p>
 <p>For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound - The trumpet was used commonly in war. It is a well-known wind instrument, and was made of brass, silver, etc. It was used for various purposes in war - to summon the soldiers; to animate them in their march; to call them forth to battle; to sound a retreat; and to signify to them what they were to do in battle, whether to charge, advance, or retreat, etc. It therefore employed a "language" which was intelligible to an army. An uncertain sound was one in which none of these things were indicated, or in which it could not be determined what was required.
 </p><p>Who shall prepare himself ... - The apostle selects a single instance of what was indicated by the trumpet, as an illustration of what he meant. The idea is, that foreign tongues spoken in their assembly would be just as useless in regard to their duty, their comfort, and edification, as would be the sound of a trumpet when it gave one of the usual and intelligible sounds by which it was known what the soldiers were required to do. Just as we would say, that the mere beating on a drum would he useless, unless some tune was played by which it was known that the soldiers were summoned to the parade, to advance, or to retreat. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#009">1 Corinthians 14:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">co1 14:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>So likewise ye ... - To apply the case. If you use a foreign language, how shall it be known what is said, or of what use will it be, unless it is made intelligible by interpretation?
 </p><p>Utter by the tongue - Unless you speak.
 </p><p>Words easy to be understood - Significant words (margin), words to which your auditors are accustomed.
 </p><p>For ye shall speak into the air - You will not speak so as to be understood; and it will be just the same as if no one was present, and you spoke to the air. We have a proverb that resembles this: "You may as well speak to the winds:" that is, you speak where it would not be understood, or where the words would have no effect. It may he observed here, that the practice of the papists accords with what the apostle here condemns, where worship is conducted in a language not understood by the people; and that there is much of this same kind of speaking now, where unintelligible terms are used, or words are employed that are above the comprehension of the people; or where doctrines are discussed which are unintelligible, and which are regarded by them without interest. All preaching should be plain, simple, perspicuous, and adapted to the capacity of the hearers. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#010">1 Corinthians 14:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">co1 14:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>There are it may be ... - There has been considerable variety in the interpertation of this expression. Rosenmuller renders it, "for the sake of example." Grotius supposes that Paul meant to indicate that there were, perhaps, or might be, as many languages as the Jews supposed, to wit, seventy. Beza and others suppose it means, that there may he as many languages as there are nations of people. Bloomfield renders it, "Let there he as many kinds of languages as you choose." Macknight, "There are, no doubt, as many kinds of languages in the world as ye speak." Robinson (Lexicon) renders it, "If so happen, it may be; perchance, perhaps;" and says the phrase is equivalent to "for example," The sense is, "There are perhaps, or for example, very many kinds of voices in the world; and all are significant. None are used by those who speak them without meaning; none speak them without designing to convey some intelligible idea to their hearers." The "argument" is, that as "all" the languages that are in the world, however numerous they are, are for "utility," and as none are used for the sake of mere display, so it should be with those who had the power of speaking them in the Christian church. They should speak them only when and where they would be understood.
 </p><p>Voices - Languages. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#011">1 Corinthians 14:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">co1 14:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The meaning of the voice - Of the language that is uttered, or the sounds that are made.
 </p><p>I shall be unto him ... - What I say will be unintelligible to him, and what he says will be unintelligible to me. We cannot understand one another any more than people can who speak different languages.
 </p><p>A barbarian - See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014">Rom 1:14</a>. The word means one who speaks a different, or a foreign language. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#012">1 Corinthians 14:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">co1 14:12</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Even so ye - Since you desire spiritual gifts, I may urge it upon you to seek to he able to speak in a clear and intelligible manner, that you may edify the church. This is one of the most valuable endowments of the Spirit; and this should be earnestly desired.
 </p><p>Forasmuch as ye are zealous - Since you earnestly desire; See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031">Co1 12:31</a>.
 </p><p>Spiritual gifts - The endowments conferred by the Holy Spirit; See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001">Co1 12:1</a>.
 </p><p>Seek that ye may excel ... - Seek that you may be able to convey truth in a clear and plain manner; seek to be distinguished for that. It is one of the most rare and valuable endowments of the Holy Spirit. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#013">1 Corinthians 14:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">co1 14:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Pray that he may interpret - Let him ask of God ability that he may explain it clearly to the church. It would seem probable that the power of speaking foreign languages, and the power of conveying truth in a clear and distinct manner, were not always found in the same person, and that the one did not of necessity imply the other. The truth seems to have been, that these extraordinary endowments of the Holy Spirit were bestowed upon people in some such way as "ordinary" talents and mental powers are now conferred; and that they became in a similar sense the "characteristic mental endowments of the individual," and of course were subject to the same laws, and liable to the same kinds of abuse, as mental endowments are now. And as it now happens that one man may have a special faculty for acquiring and expressing himself in a foreign language who may not be by any means distinguished for clear enunciation, or capable of conveying his ideas in an interesting manner to a congregation, so it was then.
 </p><p>The apostle, therefore, directs such, if any there were, instead of priding themselves on their endowments, and instead of always speaking in an unknown tongue, which would he useless to the church, to "pray" for the more useful gift of being able to convey their thoughts in a clear and intelligible manner in their vernacular tongue. This would be useful. The truths, therefore, that they had the power of speaking with eminent ability in a foreign language, they ought to desire to be able to "interpret" so that they would be intelligible to the people whom they addressed in the church. This seems to me to be the plain meaning of this passage, which has given so much perplexity to commentators. Macknight renders it, however, "Let him who prayeth in a foreign language, pray so as some one may interpret;" meaning that he who prayed in a foreign language was to do it by two or three sentences at a time, so that he might be followed by an interpreter. But this is evidently forced. In order to this, it is needful to suppose that the phrase ὁ λαλῶν  ho lalōn   , "that speaketh," should be rendered, contrary to its obvious and usual meaning, "who prays," and to supply τις  tis, "someone," in the close of the verse. The obvious interpretation is that which is given above; and this proceeds only on the supposition that the power of speaking foreign languages and the power of interpreting were not always united in the same person - a supposition that is evidently true, as appears from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010">Co1 12:10</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">co1 14:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>For if I pray ... - The reference to prayer here, and to singing in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015">Co1 14:15</a>, is designed to illustrate the propriety of the general sentiment which he is defending, that public worship should be conducted in a language that would be intelligible to the people. However well meant it might be, or however the "heart" might be engaged in it, yet unless it was intelligible, and the understanding could join in it, it would be vain and profitless.
 </p><p>My spirit prayeth - The word spirit here (πνεῦμα  pneuma) has been variously understood. Some have understood it of the Holy Spirit - the Spirit by which Paul says he was actuated. Others of the "spiritual gift," or that spiritual influence by which he was endowed. Others of the mind itself. But it is probable that the word "spirit" refers to the "will;" or to the mind, as the seat of the affections and emotions; that is, to the heart, desires, or intentions. The word "spirit" is often used in the Scriptures as the seat of the affections, and emotions, and passions of various kinds; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003">Mat 5:3</a>, "Blessed are the poor in spirit;" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021">Luk 10:21</a>, "Jesus rejoiced in spirit." So it is the seat of ardor or fervor <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017">Luk 1:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025">Act 18:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#011">Rom 12:11</a>; of grief or indignation; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#012">Mar 3:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#033">Joh 11:33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#021">Joh 13:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#016">Act 17:16</a>. It refers also to feelings, disposition, or temper of mind, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055">Luk 9:55</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015">Rom 8:15</a>. Here it refers, it seems to me. to the heart, the will, the disposition, the feelings, as contradistinguished from the understanding; and the sense is, "My feelings find utterance in prayer; my heart is engaged in devotion; my prayer will be acceptable to God, who looks upon the feelings of the heart, and I may have true enjoyment; but my understanding will be unfruitful, that is, will not profit others. What I say will not he understood by them; and of course, however much benefit I might derive from my devotions, yet they would be useless to others."
 </p><p>But my understanding - (ὁ δὲ νοῦς μου  ho de nous mou). My intellect, my mind; my mental efforts and operations.
 </p><p>Is unfruitful - Produces nothing that will be of advantage to them. It is like a barren tree; a tree that bears nothing that can be of benefit to others. They cannot understand what I say, and of course, they cannot be profited by what I utter. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015">1 Corinthians 14:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">co1 14:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>What is it then? - What shall I do? What is the proper course for me to pursue? What is my practice and my desire; see the same form of expression in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009">Rom 3:9</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#015">Rom 6:15</a>. It indicates the "conclusion" to which the reasoning had conducted him, or the course which he would pursue in view of all the circumstances of the case.
 </p><p>I will pray with the spirit ... - I will endeavor to "blend" all the advantages which can be derived from prayer; I will "unite" all the benefits which "can" result to myself and to others. I deem it of vast importance to pray with the spirit in such a way that the "heart" and the "affections" may be engaged, so that I may myself derive benefit from it; but I will also unite with that, utility to others; I will use such language that they may understand it, and be profited.
 </p><p>And I will pray with the understanding also - So that others may understand me. I will make the appropriate use of the intellect, so that it may convey ideas, and make suitable impressions on the minds of others.
 </p><p>I will sing with the spirit - It is evident that the same thing might take place in singing which occurred in prayer. It might be in a foreign language, and might be unintelligible to others. The affections of the man himself might be excited, and his heart engaged in the duty, but it would be profitless to others. Paul, therefore, says that he would so celebrate the praises of God as to excite the proper affections in his own mind, and so as to be intelligible and profitable to others. This passage proves:
 </p><p>(1) That the praises of God are to be celebrated among Christians, and that it is an important part of worship;
 </p><p>(2) That the heart should be engaged in it, and that it should be so performed as to excite proper affections in the hearts of those who are engaged in it; and,
 </p><p>(3) That it should be so done as to be "intelligible" and edifying to others.
 </p><p>The words should be so uttered as to be distinct and understood. There should be clear enunciation as well as in prayer and preaching, since the design of sacred music in the worship of God is not only to utter praise, but it is to impress the sentiments which are sung on the heart by the aid of musical sounds and expression more deeply than could otherwise be done. If this is not done, the singing might as well be in a foreign language. Perhaps there is no part of public worship in which there is greater imperfection than in the mode of its psalmody. At the same time, there is scarcely any part of the devotions of the sanctuary that may be made more edifying or impressive. It has the "advantage" - an advantage which preaching and praying have not - of using the sweet tones of melody and harmony to "impress" sentiment on the heart and it should be done.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">co1 14:16</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Else - (Ἐπεί  Epei). Since; if this is not done; if what is said is not intelligible, how shall the unlearned be able appropriately to express his assent, and join in your devotions?
 </p><p>When thou shalt bless - When thou shalt bless God, or give thanks to him. If thou shalt lead the devotions of the people in expressing thanksgiving for mercies and favors. This may refer to a part of public worship, or to the thanks which should be expressed at table, and the invocation of the divine blessing to attend the bounties of his providence. Paul had illustrated his subject by prayer and by singing; be now does it by a reference to the important part of public worship expressed in giving thanks.
 </p><p>With the spirit - In the manner referred to above; that is, in an unknown tongue, in such a way that your own "heart" may be engaged in it, but which would be unintelligible to others.
 </p><p>He that occupieth the room - Is in the place, or the seat of the unlearned; that is, he who is unlearned. On the meaning of the word "room," see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#008">Luk 14:8</a>. To "fill" a place means to occupy a station, or to be found in a slate or condition.
 </p><p>Of the unlearned - (τοῦ ἰδιώτου  tou idiōtou. On the meaning of this word, see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013">Act 4:13</a>. Here it means one who was unacquainted with the foreign language spoken by him who gave thanks. It properly denotes a man in "private," in contradistinction from a man in "public" life; and hence, a man who is ignorant and unlettered, as such people generally were.
 </p><p>Say Amen - This word means "truly, verily;" and is an expression of affirmation <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005">Joh 3:5</a> or of assent. Here it means assent. How can he pronounce "the" Amen; how can he express his assent; how can he join in the act of devotion? This "might" have been, and probably "was," expressed aloud; and there is no impropriety in it. It "may," however, be "mental" - a silent assent to what is said, and a silent uniting in the act of thanksgiving. In one way or the other, or in both, the assent should always be expressed by those who join in acts of public worship.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">co1 14:17</a></font></span></p>
 <p>For thou verily givest thanks well - That is, even if you use a foreign language. You do it with the heart; and it is accepted by God as your offering; but the other, who cannot understand it, cannot be benefited by it. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#018">1 Corinthians 14:18</a></p>

 <p>I thank my God - Paul here shows that he did not undervalue or despise the power of speaking foreign languages. It was with him a subject of thanksgiving that he could speak so many; but he felt that there were more valuable endowments than this; see the next verse.
 </p><p>With tongues more than ye all - I am able to speak more foreign languages than all of you. "How many" languages Paul could speak, he has no where told us. It is reasonable, however, to presume that he was able to speak the language of any people to whom God in his providence, and by his Spirit, called him to preach. He had been commissioned to preach to the "Gentiles," and it is probable that he was able to speak the languages of all the nations among whom he ever traveled. There is no account of his being under a necessity of employing an interpreter wherever he preached.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">co1 14:19</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Yet in the church - In the Christian assembly. The word "church" does not refer to the "edifice" where Christians worshipped, but to the organized body of Christians.
 </p><p>I had rather ... - It is probable that in the Christian assembly, usually, there were few who understood foreign languages. Paul, therefore, would not speak in a foreign language when its only use would be mere display.
 </p><p>With my understanding - So as to be intelligible to others; so that I might understand it, and so that at the same time others might be benefitted.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">co1 14:20</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Brethren, be not children in understanding - Be not childish; do not behave like little children. They admire, and are astonished at what is striking, novel, and what may be of no real utility. They are pleased with anything that will amuse them, and at little things that afford them play and pastime. So your admiration of a foreign language and of the ability to speak it, is of as little solid value as the common sports and plays of boys. This, says Doddridge, is an admirable stroke of oratory, and adapted to bring down their pride by showing them that those things on which they were disposed to value themselves were "childish." It is sometimes well to appeal to Christians in this manner, and to show them that what they are engaged in is "unworthy" the dignity of the understanding - unfit to occupy the time and attention of an immortal mind. Much, alas! very much of that which engages the attention of Christians is just as unworthy of the dignity of the mind, and of their immortal nature, as were the aims and desires which the apostle rebuked among the Christians at Corinth. Much that pertains to dress, to accomplishment, to living, to employment, to amusement, to conversation, will appear, when we come to die, to have been like the playthings of "children;" and we shall feel that the immortal mind has been employed, and the time wasted, and the strength exhausted in that which was foolish and puerile.
 </p><p>Howbeit in malice be ye children - This is one of Paul's most happy turns of expression and of sentiment. He had just told them that in one respect they ought not to be children. Yet, as if this would appear to be speaking lightly of children - and Paul would not speak lightly of anyone, even of a child - he adds, that in "another" respect it would be well to be like them - nay, not only like children, but like "infants." The phrase "be ye children," here, does not express the force of the original νηπιάζετε  nēpiazete. It means, "be infants," and is emphatic, and was used, evidently, by the apostle of design. The meaning may be thus expressed. "Your admiration of foreign languages is like the sports and plays of "childhood." In this respect be not children (παιδίᾳ paidia); be men! Lay aside such childish things. Act worthy of the "understanding" which God has given you. I have mentioned children. Yet I would not speak unkindly or with contempt even of them. "In one respect" you may imitate them. Nay, you should not only be like "children," that are somewhat advanced in years, but like "infants." Be as free from malice, from any ill-will toward others, from envy, and every improper passion, as they are." This passage, therefore, accords with the repeated declaration of the Saviour, that in order to enter into heaven, it was needful that we should become as little children; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#003">Mat 18:3</a>.
 </p><p>Be men - Margin, "Perfect, or of a riper age" (τέλειοι  teleioi). The word means full-grown men. Act like them whose understandings are mature and ripe. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#021">1 Corinthians 14:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">co1 14:21</a></font></span></p>
 <p>In the law it is written - This passage is found in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#011">Isa 38:11-12</a>. The word "law" here seems to mean the same as revelation; or is used to denote the Old Testament in general. A similar use occurs in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#034">Joh 10:34</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025">Joh 15:25</a>.
 </p><p>With men of other tongues ... - This passage, where it occurs in Isaiah, means, that God would teach the rebellious and refractory Jews submission to himself, by punishing them amidst a people of another language, by removing them to a land - the land of Chaldea - where they would hear only a language that to them would be unintelligible and barbarous. Yet, notwithstanding this discipline, they would be still, to some extent, a rebellious people. The passage in Isaiah has no reference to the miraculous gift of tongues. and cannot have been used by the apostle as containing any intimation that such miraculous gifts would be imparted. It seems to have been used by Paul, because the "words" which occurred in Isaiah would "appropriately express" the idea which he wished to convey (see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023">Mat 1:23</a>), that God would make use of foreign languages for some "valuable purpose." But he by no means intimates that Isaiah had any such reference; nor does he quote this as a fulfillment of the prophecy; nor does he mean to say, that God would accomplish "the same purpose" by the use of foreign languages, which was contemplated in the passage in Isaiah. The sense is, as God accomplished an important purpose by the use of a foreign language in regard to his ancient people, as recorded in Isaiah, so he will make use of foreign languages to accomplish important purposes still. They shall be used in the Christian church to effect important objects, though not in the same manner, nor for the same end, as in the time of the captivity. What the design of making use of foreign languages was, in the Christian church, the apostle immediately states; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022">Co1 14:22-23</a>.
 </p><p>Yet for all that ... - Notwithstanding all this chastisement that shall be inflicted on the Jews in a distant land, and among a people of a different language, they will still be a rebellious people. This is the sense of the passage, as it is used by Isaiah; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012">Isa 28:12</a>. It is not quoted literally by the apostle, but the main idea is retained. He does not appear to design to apply this to the Corinthians, unless it may be to intimate that the power of speaking foreign languages did not of necessity secure obedience. It might he that this power might be possessed, and yet they be a sinful people; just as the Jews were admonished by the judgments of God, inflicted by means of a people speaking a foreign language, and yet were not reformed or made holy.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">co1 14:22</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Wherefore - Thus, (Ὥστε  Hōste), or wherefore. The apostle does not mean to say that what he was about to state was a direct conclusion from the passage of Scripture which he had quoted, but that it followed from all that he had said, and from the whole view of the subject. "The true statement or doctrine is, that tongues are for a sign," etc.
 </p><p>Tongues - The power of speaking foreign languages.
 </p><p>Are for a sign - An "indication," an evidence, or a proof that God has imparted this power, and that he attends the preaching of the gospel with his approbation. It is a "sign," or a "miracle," which, like all other miracles, may be designed to convince the unbelieving world that the religion is from God.
 </p><p>Not to them that believe - Not to Christians. They are already convinced of the truth of religion, and they would not be benefited by that which was spoken in a language which they could not understand,
 </p><p>But to them that believe not - It is a miracle designed to convince them of the truth of the Christian religion. God alone could confer the power of thus speaking; and as it was conferred expressly to aid in the propagation of the gospel, it proved that it was from God; see the note on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001">Act 2:1-15</a>.
 </p><p>But prophesying - Speaking in a calm, connected, didactic manner, in language intelligible to all under the influence of inspiration; see notes on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001">Co1 14:1</a>.
 </p><p>For them that believe not - Is not particularly intended for them; but is intended mainly for the edifying of the church. It is not so striking, so replete with proofs of the divine presence and power as the gift of tongues. Though it may be really under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and may be really by inspiration, yet it is not so evidently such as is the power of speaking foreign languages. It was, therefore, better adapted to edify the church than to convince gainsayers. At the same time the "truths" conveyed by it, and the consolations administered by it, might be as clear evidence to the church of the attending power, and presence, and goodness of God, as the power of speaking foreign languages might be to infidels.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">co1 14:23</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Be come together into one place - For public worship.
 </p><p>And all speak with tongues - All speak with a variety of unknown tongues; all speak foreign languages. The idea is, that the church would usually speak the same language with the people among whom they dwelt; and if they made use of foreign languages which were unintelligible to their visitors, it would leave the impression that the church was a bedlam.
 </p><p>And there come in - those that are "unlearned." Those that are unacquainted with foreign languages, and to whom, therefore, what was said would be unintelligible.
 </p><p>Or unbelievers - Heathen, or Jews, who did not believe in Christ. It is evident from this that such persons often attended on the worship of Christians. Curiosity might have led them to it; or the fact that they had relatives among Christians might have caused it.
 </p><p>That ye are mad - They will not understand what is said; it will be a confused jargon; and they will infer that it is the effect of insanity. Even though it might not, therefore, be in itself improper, yet a regard to the honor of Christianity should have led them to abstain from the use of such languages in their worship when it was needless. The apostles were charged, from a similar cause, with being intoxicated; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013">Act 2:13</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024">1 Corinthians 14:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">co1 14:24</a></font></span></p>
 <p>But if all prophesy - See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001">Co1 14:1</a>. If all, in proper order and time, shall utter the truths of religion in a language intelligible to all.
 </p><p>Or one unlearned - One unacquainted with the nature of Christianity, or the truths of the gospel.
 </p><p>He is convinced of all - He will be convinced by all that speak. He will understand what is said; he will see its truth and force, and be will be satisfied of the truth of Christianity. The word here rendered "convinced" (ἐλέγχετἀι  elengchetai) is rendered "reprove" in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008">Joh 16:8</a>, "And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin," etc. Its proper meaning is to "convict," to show one to be wrong; and then to rebuke, reprove, admonish, etc. Here it means, evidently, that the man would be convicted, or convinced of his error and of his sin; he would see that his former opinions and practice had been wrong; he would see and acknowledge the force and truth of the Christian sentiments which should be uttered, and would acknowledge the error of his former opinions and life. The following verse shows that the apostle means something more than a mere convincing of the understanding, or a mere conviction that his opinions had been erroneous. He evidently refers to what is now known also as "conviction" for sin; that is, a deep sense of the depravity of the heart, of the errors and follies of the past life, accompanied with mental anxiety, distress, and alarm. The force of truth, and the appeals which should be made, and the observation of the happy effects of religion, would convince him that he was a sinner, and show him also his need of a Saviour.
 </p><p>He is judged by all - By all that speak; by all that they say. The "effect" of what they say shall be, as it were, to pass a "judgment" on his former life; or to condemn him. What is said will be approved by his own conscience, and will have the effect to condemn him in his own view as a lost sinner. This is now the effect of faithful preaching, to produce deep self-condemnation in the minds of sinners. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025">1 Corinthians 14:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">co1 14:25</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest - Made manifest to himself in a surprising and remarkable manner. He shall be led to see the "real" designs and motives of his heart. His conscience would be awakened; he would recall his former course of life; he would see that it was evil; and the present state of his heart would be made known to himself. It is possible that he would "suppose that the speaker was aiming directly at him, and "revealing" his feelings to others; for such an effect is often produced. The convicted sinner often supposes that the preacher particularly intends "him," and wonders that he has such an acquaintance with his feelings and his life; and often supposes that he is designing to disclose his feelings to the congregation. It is possible that Paul here may mean that the prophets, by inspiration, would be able to reveal some secret facts in regard to the stranger; or to state the ill design which he might have had in coming into the assembly; or to state some things in regard to him which could be known only to himself; as was the case with Ananias and Sapphira (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001">Act 5:1</a>, seq.); but perhaps it is better to understand this in a more general sense, as describing the proper and more common effect of truth, when it is applied by a man's own conscience. Such effects are often witnessed now; and such effects show the truth of religion; its adaptedness to people; the omniscience and the power of God; the design of the conscience, and its use in the conversion of sinners.
 </p><p>And so falling down on his face - The usual posture of worship or reverence in eastern countries. It was performed by sinking on the knees and hands, and then placing the face on the ground. This might be done publicly; or the apostle may mean to say that it would lead him to do it in private.
 </p><p>He will worship God - He will be converted, and become a Christian.
 </p><p>And report that God ... - Will become your friend, and an advocate for the Christian religion. An enemy will be turned to a friend. Doubtless this was often done. It is now often done. Paul's argument is, that they should so conduct their public devotions as that they should be adapted to produce this result. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026">1 Corinthians 14:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">co1 14:26</a></font></span></p>
 <p>How is it then, brethren? - See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015">Co1 14:15</a>. What is the fact? What actually occurs among you? Does that state of things exist which I have described? Is there that order in your public worship which is demanded and proper? It is implied in his asking this question that there might be some things among them which were improper, and which deserved reproof.
 </p><p>When ye come together - For worship.
 </p><p>Everyone of you ... - That is, all the things which are specified would be found among them. It is, evidently, not meant that all these things would be found in the same person, but would all exist at the same time; and thus confusion and disorder would be inevitable. Instead of waiting for an intimation from the presiding officer in the assembly, or speaking in succession and in order, each one probably regarded himself as under the influence of the Holy Spirit; as having an important message to communicate, or as being called on to celebrate the praises of God; and thus confusion and disorder would prevail. Many would be speaking at the same time, and a most unfavorable impression would be made on the minds of the strangers who should be present, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#023">Co1 14:23</a>. This implied reproof of the Corinthians is certainly a reproof of those public assemblies where many speak at the same time; or where a portion are engaged in praying, and others in exhortation. Nor can it be urged that in such cases those who engage in these exercises are under the influence of the Holy Spirit; for, however true that may be, yet it is no more true than it was in Corinth, and yet the apostle reproved the practice there. The Holy Spirit is the author of order, and not of confusion <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033">Co1 14:33</a>; and true religion prompts to peace and regularity, and not to discord and tumult.
 </p><p>Hath a psalm - Is disposed to sing; is inclined to praise; and, however irregular or improper, expresses his thanks in a public manner, see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015">Co1 14:15</a>.
 </p><p>Hath a doctrine - Has some religious truth on his mind which be deems it of special importance to inculcate, see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006">Co1 14:6</a>.
 </p><p>Hath a tongue - Has something made known to him in a foreign language, or has a power of speaking a foreign language, and exercises it, though it produces great confusion.
 </p><p>Hath a revelation - Some truth which has been particularly revealed to him; perhaps an explanation of some mystery (Doddridge); or a revelation ot some future event (Macknight); or a prophecy (Bloomfield); or a power of explaining some of the truths couched in the types and figures of the Old Testament. Grotius.
 </p><p>Hath an interpretation - An explanation of something that has been uttered by another in a foreign language; See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010">Co1 12:10</a>.
 </p><p>Let all things ... - Let this be the great principle, to promote the edification of the church; See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#012">Co1 14:12</a>. If this rule were followed, it would prevent confusion and disorder.

 <p>Let it be by two, or at the most by three - That is, two, or at most three in one day, or in one meeting. So Grotius, Rosenmuller, Doddridge, Bloomfield, and Locke, understand it. It is probable that many were endowed with the gift of tongues; and it is certain that they were disposed to exercise the gift even when it could be of no real advantage, and when it was done only for ostentation. Paul had shown to them <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022">Co1 14:22</a>, that the main design of the gift of tongues was to convince unbelievers; he here shows them that if that gift was exercised in the church, it should be in such a way as to promote edification. They should not speak at the same time; nor should they regard it as necessary that all should speak at the same meeting. It should not be so as to produce disorder and confusion nor should it be so as to detain the people beyond a reasonable time. The speakers, therefore, in any one assembly should not exceed two or three.
 </p><p>And that by course - Separately; one after another. They should not all speak at the same time.
 </p><p>And let one interpret - One who has the gift of interpreting foreign languages, (Note, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010">Co1 12:10</a>), so that they may be understood, and the church be edified.

 <p>But if there be no interpreter - If there be no one present who has the gift of interpretation.
 </p><p>And let him speak to himself and to God - See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002">Co1 14:2</a>, note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#004">Co1 14:4</a>. Let him commune with himself, and with God; let him meditate on the truths which are revealed to him, and let him in secret express his desires to God.

 <p>Let the prophets - See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001">Co1 14:1</a>.
 </p><p>Speak two or three - On the same days, or at the same meeting; see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027">Co1 14:27</a>.
 </p><p>And let the other judge - The word "other" (οἱ ἄλλοι  hoi alloi, "the others"), Bloomfield supposes refers to the other prophets; and that the meaning is, that they should decide whether what was said was dictated by the Holy Spirit, or not. But the more probable sense, I think, is that which refers it to the rest of the congregation, and which supposes that they were to compare one doctrine with another, and deliberate on what was spoken, and determine whether it had evidence of being in accordance with the truth. It may be that the apostle here refers to those who had the gift of discerning spirits, and that he meant to say that they were to determine by what spirit the prophets who spoke were actuated. It was possible that those who claimed to be prophets might err, and it was the duty of all to examine whether that which was uttered was in accordance with truth. And if this was a duty then, it is a duty now; if it was proper even when the teachers claimed to be under divine inspiration, it is much more the duty of the people now. No minister of religion has a right to demand that all that he speaks shall be regarded as truth, unless he can give good reasons for it: no man is to be debarred from the right of canvassing freely, and comparing with the Bible, and with sound reason, all that the minister of the gospel advances. No minister who has just views of his office, and a proper acquaintance with the truth, and confidence in it, would desire to prohibit the people from the most full and free examination of all that he utters. It may be added, that the Scripture everywhere encourages the most full and free examination of all doctrines that are advanced; and that true religion advances just in proportion as this spirit of candid, and earnest, and prayerful examination prevails among a people; see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011">Act 17:11</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021">Th1 5:21</a>.

 <p>If anything be revealed to another - If, while one is speaking, an important truth is revealed to another, or is suggested to his mind by the Holy Spirit, which he feels it to be important to communicate.
 </p><p>Let the first hold his peace - That is, let him that was speaking conclude his discourse, and let there not be the confusion arising from two persons speaking. at the same time. Doddridge understands this as meaning, that he to whom the revelation was made should sit still, until the other was done speaking, and not rise and rudely interrupt him. But this is to do violence to the language. So Macknight understands it, that the one who was speaking was first to finish his discourse, and be silent. before the other began to speak. But this is evidently a forced construction. Locke understands it as meaning, that if, while one was speaking, the meaning of what he said was revealed to another, the first was to cease speaking until the other had interpreted or explained it. But the obvious meaning of the passage is, that the man that was speaking was to close his discourse and be silent. It does not follow, however, that he was to be rudely interrupted. He might close his discourse deliberately, or perhaps by an intimation from the person to whom the revelation was made. At any rate, two were not to speak at the same time, but the one who was speaking was to conclude before the other addressed the assembly.

 <p>For ye may all prophecy ... - There is time enough for all; there is no need of speaking in confusion and disorder. Every person may have an opportunity of expressing his sentiments at the proper time.
 </p><p>That all may learn - In such a manner that there may be edification. This might be done if they would speak one at a time in their proper order.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">co1 14:32</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And the spirits of the prophets - See in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001">Co1 14:1</a> for the meaning of the word prophets. The evident meaning of this is, that they were able to control their inclination to speak; they were not under a necessity of speaking, even though they might be inspired. There was no need of disorder. This verse gives confirmation to the supposition, that the extraordinary endowments of the Holy Spirit were subjected to substantially the same laws as a man's natural endowments. They were conferred by the Holy Spirit; but they were conferred on free agents, and did not interfere with their free agency. And as a man, though of the most splendid talents and commanding eloquence, has "control" over his own mind, and is not "compelled" to speak, so it was with those who are here called prophets. The immediate reference of the passage is to those who are called "prophets" in the New Testament: and the interpretation should be confined to them.
 </p><p>It is not improbable, however, that the same thing was true of the prophets of the Old Testament; and that it is really true as a general declaration of all the prophets whom God has inspired, that they had control over their own minds, and could speak or be silent at pleasure. In this the spirit of true inspiration differed essentially from the views of the pagan, who regarded themselves as driven on by a wild, controlling influence, that compelled them to speak even when they were unconscious of what they said. Universally, in the pagan world, the priests and priestesses supposed or feigned that they were under an influence which was incontrollable; which took away their powers of self-command, and which made them the mere organs or unconscious instruments of communicating the will of the gods. The Scripture account of inspiration is, however, a very different thing. In whatever way the mind was influenced, or whatever was the mode in which the truth was conveyed, yet it was not such as to destroy the conscious powers of free agency, nor such as to destroy the individuality of the inspired person, or to annihilate what was special in his mode of thinking, his style, or his customary manner of expression.

 <p>God is not the author of confusion - Margin, "Tumult," or "unquietness." His religion cannot tend to produce disorder. He is the God of peace; and his religion will tend to promote order. It is calm, peaceful, thoughtful. It is not boisterous and disorderly.
 </p><p>As in all churches of the saints - As was everywhere apparent in the churches. Paul here appeals to them, and says that this was the fact wherever the true religion was spread, that it tended to produce peace and order. This is as true now as it was then. And we may learn, therefore:
 </p><p>(1) That where there is disorder, there is little religion. Religion does not produce it; and the tendency of tumult and confusion is to drive religion away.
 </p><p>(2) true religion will not lead to tumult, to outcries, or to irregularity. It will not prompt many to speak or pray at once; nor will it justify tumultuous and noisy assemblages.
 </p><p>(3) Christians should regard God as the author of peace. They should always in the sanctuary demean themselves in a reverent manner, and with such decorum as becomes people when they are in the presence of a holy and pure God, and engaged in his worship.
 </p><p>(4) all those pretended conversions, however sudden and striking they may be, which are attended with disorder, and confusion, and public outcries, are to be suspected. Such excitement may be connected with genuine piety, but it is no part of pure religion. That is calm, serious, orderly, heavenly. No person who is under its influence is disposed to engage in scenes of confusion and disorder. Grateful he may be, and he may and will express his gratitude; prayerful he will be, and he will pray; anxious for others he will be, and he will express that anxiety; but it will be with seriousness, tenderness, love; with a desire for the order of God's house, and not with a desire to break in upon and disturb all the solemnities of public worship.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">co1 14:34</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Let your women keep silence ... - This rule is positive, explicit, and universal. There is no ambiguity in the expressions; and there can be no difference of opinion, one would suppose, in regard to their meaning. The sense evidently is, that in all those things which he had specified, the women were to keep silence; they were to take no part. He had discoursed of speaking foreign languages, and of prophecy; and the evident sense is, that in regard to all these they were to keep silence, or were not to engage in them. These pertained solely to the male portion of the congregation. These things constituted the business of the public teaching; and in this the female part of the congregation were to be silent. "They were not to teach the people, nor were they to interrupt those who were speaking" - Rosenmuller. It is probable that, on pretence of being inspired, the women had assumed the office of public teachers.
 </p><p>In 1 Cor. 11, Paul had argued against their doing this in a certain manner - without their veils <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#004">Co1 11:4</a>, and he had shown, that "on that account," and "in that manner," it was improper for them to assume the office of public teachers, and to conduct the devotions of the church. The force of the argument in 1 Cor. 11: is, that what he there states would be a sufficient reason against the practice, even if there were no other. It was contrary to all decency and propriety that they should appear "in that manner" in public. He here argues against the practice on every ground; forbids it altogether; and shows that on every consideration it was to be regarded as improper for them even so much as "to ask a question" in time of public service. There is, therefore, no inconsistency between the argument in 1 Cor. 11: and the statement here; and the force of the whole is, that "on every consideration" it was improper, and to be expressly prohibited, for women to conduct the devotions of the church. It does not refer to those only who claimed to be inspired, but to all; it does not refer merely to acts of public preaching, but to all acts of speaking, or even asking questions, when the church is assembled for public worship. No rule in the New Testament is more positive than this; and however plausible may be the reasons which may be urged for disregarding it, and for suffering women to take part in conducting public worship, yet the authority of the apostle Paul is positive, and his meaning cannot be mistaken; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011">Ti1 2:11-12</a>.
 </p><p>To be under obedience - To be subject to their husbands; to acknowledge the superior authority of the man; see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003">Co1 11:3</a>.
 </p><p>As also saith the law - <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016">Gen 3:16</a>, "And thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#035">1 Corinthians 14:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">co1 14:35</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And if they will learn anything - If anything has been spoken which they do not understand; or if on any particular subject they desire more full information, let them inquire of their husbands in their own dwelling. They may there converse freely; and their inquiries will not be attended with the irregularity and disorder which would occur should they interrupt the order and solemnity of public worship.
 </p><p>For it is a shame - It is disreputable and shameful; it is a breach of propriety. Their station in life demands modesty, humility, and they should be free from the ostentation of appearing so much in public as to take part in the public services of teaching and praying. It does not become their rank in life; it is not fulfilling the object which God evidently intended them to fill. He has appointed people to rule; to hold offices; to instruct and govern the church; and it is improper that women should assume that office upon themselves. This evidently and obviously refers to the church assembled for public worship, in the ordinary and regular acts of devotion. There the assembly is made up of males and females, of old and young, and there it is improper for them to take part in conducting the exercises. But this cannot be interpreted as meaning that it is improper for females to speak or to pray in meetings of their own sex, assembled for prayer or for benevolence; nor that it is improper for a female to speak or to pray in a Sunday School. Neither of these come under the apostle's idea of a church. And in such meetings, no rule of propriety or of the Scriptures is violated in their speaking for the edification of each other, or in leading in social prayer. It may be added here, that on this subject the Jews were very strenuous, and their laws were very strict. The Rabbis taught that a woman should know nothing but the use of the distaff, and they were specially prohibited from asking questions in the synagogue, or even from reading. See Lightfoot. The same rule is still observed by the Jews in the synagogues.

 <p>What! came the word of God out from you? - The meaning of this is, "Is the church at Corinth the "mother church?" Was it first established; or has it been alone in sending forth the Word of God? You have adopted customs which are unusual. You have permitted women to speak in a manner unknown to other churches; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#016">Co1 11:16</a>. You have admitted irregularity and confusion unknown in all the others. You have allowed many to speak at the same time, and have tolerated confusion and disorder. Have you any "right" thus to differ from others? Have you any authority, as it were, to dictate to them, to teach them, contrary to their uniform custom, to allow these disorders? Should you not rather be conformed to them, and observe the rules of the churches which are older than yours?" The "argument" here is, that the church at Corinth was "not" the first that was established; that it was one of the "last" that had been founded; and that it could, therefore, claim no right to differ from others, or to prescribe to them. The same argument is employed in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#016">Co1 11:16</a>; see Note.
 </p><p>Or came it unto you only? - As you are not the first of those who believed, neither are you the only ones. God has sent the same gospel to others, and it is traveling over the world. Others, therefore, have the same right as you to originate customs and special habits; and as this would be attended with confusion and disorder, you should all follow the same rule, and the customs which do not prevail in other churches should not be allowed in yours.

 <p>If any man think himself to be a prophet - See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001">Co1 14:1</a>. If any man claim to be divinely endowed. Macknight renders it, "be really a prophet." But the more correct meaning here is, doubtless, "If any man "profess" to be a prophet; or is "reputed" to be a prophet." Bloomfield. The proper meaning of the word δοκέω  dokeō is to seem to oneself; to be of opinion, to suppose, believe, etc.; and the reference here is to one who should "regard himself," or who should believe and profess to be thus endowed.
 </p><p>Or spiritual - Regarding himself as under the extraordinary influence of the Spirit.
 </p><p>Let him acknowledge ... - He will show that he is truly under the influence of the Holy Spirit, by acknowledging my authority, and by yielding obedience to the commands which I utter in the name and by the authority of the Lord. All would probably be disposed to acknowledge the right of Paul to speak to them; all would regard him as an apostle; and all would show that God had influenced their hearts, if they listened to his commands, and obeyed his injunctions. I do not speak by my own authority, or in my own name, says Paul. I speak in the name of the Lord; and to obey the commands of the Lord is a proof of being influenced by his Spirit. True religion everywhere, and the most ardent and enthusiastic zeal that is prompted by true religion, will show their genuineness and purity by a sacred and constant regard for the commands of the Lord. And that zeal which disregards those commands, and which tramples down the authority of the Scriptures and the peace and order of the church, gives demonstration that it is not genuine. It is false zeal, and, however ardent, will not ultimately do good to the cause.

 </p><p>Let him be ignorant - At his own peril, let him remain so, and abide the consequences. I shall not take any further trouble to debate with him. I have stated my authority. I have delivered the commands of God. And now, if he disregards them, and still doubts whether all this is said by divine authority, let him abide the consequences of rejecting the law of God. I have given full proof of my divine commission. I have nothing more to say on that head. And now, if he chooses to remain in ignorance or incredulity, the fault is his own, and he must answer for it to God.

 <p>Covet to prophesy - See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001">Co1 14:1</a>. This is the "summing up" of all that he had said. It was "desirable" that a man should wish to be able to speak, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, in such a manner as to edify the church.
 </p><p>And forbid not ... - Do not suppose that the power of speaking foreign languages is useless, or is to be despised, or that it is to be prohibited. "In its own place" it is a valuable endowment; and on proper occasions the talent should be exercised; see in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022">Co1 14:22</a>.

 <p>Let all things be done decently and in order - Let all things be done in an "appropriate" and "becoming" manner; "decorously," as becomes the worship of God. Let all be done in "order, regularly;" without confusion, discord, tumult. The word used here (κατὰ τάξιν  kata taxin) is properly a military term, and denotes the order and regularity with which an army is drawn up. This is a general rule, which was to guide them. It was simple, and easily applied. There might be a thousand questions started about the modes and forms of worship, and the customs in the churches, and much difficulty might occur in many of these questions; but here was a simple and plain rule, which might be easily applied. Their good sense would tell them what became the worship of God; and their pious feelings would restrain them from excesses and disorders. This rule is still applicable, and is safe in guiding us in many things in regard to the worship of God. There are many things which cannot be subjected to "rule," or exactly prescribed; there are many things which may and must be left to pious feeling, to good sense, and to the views of Christians themselves, about what will promote their edification and the conversion of sinners. The rule in such questions is plain. Let all be done "decorously," as becomes the worship of the great and holy God; let all be without confusion, noise, and disorder.
 </p><p>In view of this chapter, we may remark:
 </p><p>(1) That public worship should be in a language understood by the people; the language which they commonly employ. Nothing can be clearer than the sentiments of Paul on this. The whole strain of the chapter is to demonstrate this, in opposition to making use of a foreign and unintelligible language in any part of public worship. Paul specifics in the course of the discussion every part of public worship; "public preaching" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002">Co1 14:2-3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#005">Co1 14:5</a>,<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#013">Co1 14:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#019">Co1 14:19</a>; "prayer" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014">Co1 14:14-15</a>; "singing" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015">Co1 14:15</a>; and insists that all should be in a language that should be understood by the people. It would almost seem that he had anticipated the sentiments and practice of the Roman Catholic denomination. It is remarkable that a practice should have grown up, and have been defended, in a church professedly Christian, so directly in opposition to the explicit meaning of the New Testament. Perhaps there is not even in the Roman Catholic denomination, a more striking instance of a custom or doctrine in direct contradiction to the Bible. If anything is plain and obvious, it is that worship, in order to be edifying, should be in a language that is understood by the people.
 </p><p>Nor can that service be accepable to God which is not understood by those who offer it; which conveys no idea to their minds, and which cannot, therefore, be the homage of the heart. Assuredly, God does not require the offering of unmeaningful words. Yet, this has been a grand device of the great enemy of man. It has contributed to keep the people in ignorance and superstition; it has prevented the mass of the people from seeing how utterly unlike the New Testament are the sentiments of the papists; and it has, in connection with the kindred doctrine that the Scripture should be withheld from the people, contributed to perpetuate that dark system, and to bind the human mind in chains. Well do the Roman Catholics know, that if the Bible were given to the people, and public worship conducted in a language which they could understand, the system would soon fall. It could not live in the midst of light. It is a system which lives and thrives only in darkness.
 </p><p>(2) preaching should be simple and intelligible. There is a great deal of preaching which might as well be in a foreign tongue as in the language which is actually employed. It is dry, abstruse, metaphysical, remote from the common manner of expression, and the common habits of thought among people. It may be suited to schools of philosophy, but it cannot be suited to the pulpit. The preaching of the Lord Jesus was simple, and intelligible even to a child. And nothing can be a greater error, than for the ministers of the gospel to adopt a dry and metaphysical manner of preaching. The most successful preachers have been those who have been most remarkable for their simplicity and clearness. Nor is simplicity and intelligibleness of manner inconsistent with bright thought and profound sentiments. A diamond is the most pure of all minerals; a river may be deep, and yet its water so pure that the bottom may be seen at a great depth; and glass in the window is most valuable the clearer and purer it is, when it is itself least seen, and when it gives no obstruction to the light. If the purpose is that the glass may be itself an ornament, it may be well to stain it; if to give light, it should be pure. A very shallow stream may be very muddy; and because the bottom cannot be seen, it is no evidence that it is deep. So it is with style. If the purpose is to convey thought, to enlighten and save the soul, the style should be plain, simple, pure. If it be to bewilder and confound, or to be admired as unintelligible, or perhaps as profound, then an abstruse and metaphysical, or a flowery manner may be adopted in the pulpit.
 </p><p>(3) we should learn to value "useful" talent more than that which is splendid and showy; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003">Co1 14:3</a>. The whole scope of this chapter goes to demonstrate that we should more highly prize and desire that talent which may be "useful" to the church, or which may be useful in convincing unbelievers <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024">Co1 14:24-25</a>, than that which merely dazzles, or excites admiration. Ministers of the gospel who preach as they should do, engage in their work to win souls to Christ, not to induce them to admire eloquence; they come to teach people to adore the great and dreadful God, not to be loud in their praises of a mortal man.
 </p><p>(4) ministers of the gospel should not aim to be admired. They should seek to be useful. Their aim should not be to excite admiration of their acute and profound talent for reasoning; of their clear and striking power of observation; of their graceful manner; of their glowing and fervid eloquence; of the beauty of their words, or the eloquence of their well-turned periods. They should seek to build up the people of God in holy faith, and so to present truth as that it shall make a deep impression on mankind. No work is so important, and so serious in its nature and results, as the ministry of the gospel; and in no work on earth should there be more seriousness, simplicity, exactness, and correctness of statement, and invincible and unvarying adherence to simple and unvarnished truth. Of all places, the pulpit is the last, in which to seek to excite admiration, or where to display profound learning, or the powers of an abstract and subtle argumentation, "for the sake" of securing a reputation. Cowper has drawn the character of what a minister of the gospel should be. in the wellknown and most beautiful passage in the "Task."
 </p><p>Would I describe a preacher, such as Paul.
 </p><p>Were he on earth, would hear, approve, and own,
 </p><p>Paul should himself direct me. I would trace.
 </p><p>His master-strokes, and draw from his design.
 </p><p>I would express him simple, grave, sincere;
 </p><p>In doctrine uncorrupt; in language plain;
 </p><p>And plain in manner; decent, solemn, chaste,
 </p><p>And natural in gesture; much impress'd.
 </p><p>Himself, as conscious of his awful charge,
 </p><p>And anxious mainly that the flock he feeds.
 </p><p>May feel it too; affectionate in look,
 </p><p>And tender in address, as well becomes.
 </p><p>A messenger of grace to guilty men.
 </p><p>He stablishes the strong, restores the weak,
 </p><p>Reclaims the wanderer, binds the broken heart,
 </p><p>And, arm'd himself in panoply complete.
 </p><p>Of heavenly temper, furnishes with arms,
 </p><p>Bright as his own, and trains, by every rule.
 </p><p>Of holy discipline, to glorious war,
 </p><p>The sacramental host of God's elect.
