 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</i>, by John Nelson Darby, [1857-62], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001">Matthew Chapter 5</a></h3> 
 <p>He then gathers around Him those who were definitively to follow Him in His ministry and His temptations; and, at His call, to link their portion and their lot with His, forsaking all beside.
 </p><p>The strong man was bound, so that Jesus could spoil his goods, and proclaim the kingdom with proofs of that power which were able to establish it.
 </p><p>Two things are then brought forward in the Gospel narrative. First, the power which accompanies the proclamation of the kingdom. In two or three verses, [See Note #16] without other detail, this fact is announced. The proclamation of the kingdom is attended with acts of power that excite the attention of the whole country, the whole extent of the ancient territory of Israel. Jesus appears before them invested with this power. Secondly (chapters 5-7), the character of the kingdom is announced in the sermon on the Mount, as well as that of the persons who should have part in it (the Father's name withal being revealed). That is, the Lord had announced the coming kingdom, and with the present power of goodness, having overcome the adversary; and then shews what were the true characters according to which it would be set up, and who could enter, and how. Redemption is not spoken of in it; but the character and nature of the kingdom, and who could enter. This clearly shews the moral position which this sermon holds in the Lord's teaching.
 </p><p>It is evident that, in all this part of the Gospel, it is the Lord's position which is the subject of the teaching of the Spirit, and not the details of His life. Details come after, in order fully to exhibit what He was in the midst of Israel, His relations with that people, and His path in the power of the Spirit which led to the rupture between the Son of David and the people who ought to have received Him. The attention of the whole country being thus engaged by His mighty acts, the Lord sets before His disciples  but in the hearing of the people  the principles of His kingdom.
 </p><p>This discourse may be divided into the following parts:  [See Note #17] The character and the portion of those who should be in the kingdom (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001">Mat 5:1-12</a>). Their position in the world (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013">Mat 5:13-16</a>). The connection between the principles of the kingdom and the law (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017">Mat 5:17-48</a>). [See Note #18] The spirit in which His disciples should perform good works (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001">Mat 6:1-18</a>). Separation from the spirit of the world and from its anxieties (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019">Mat 6:19-34</a>). The spirit of their relation with others (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#001">Mat 7:1-6</a>). The confidence in God which became them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007">Mat 7:7-12</a>). The energy that should characterise them, in order that they might enter into the kingdom; not however merely enter, many would seek to do that, but according to those principles which made it difficult for man, according to God  the strait gate; and then, the means of discerning those who would seek to deceive them, as well as the watchfulness needed that they might not be deceived (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#013">Mat 7:13-23</a>).
 </p><p>Real and practical obedience to His sayings, the true wisdom of those that hear His words (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#024">Mat 7:24-29</a>).
 </p><p>There is another principle that characterises this discourse, and that is the introduction of the Father's name. Jesus puts His disciples in connection with His Father, as their Father. He reveals to them the Father's name, in order that they may be in relation with Him, and that they may act in accordance with that which He is.
 </p><p>Note #16
 </p><p>It is striking that the whole ministry of the Lord is recounted in one Verse (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#023">Mat 5:23</a>). All the subsequent statements are facts, having a special moral import, shewing what was passing amongst the people in grace onward to His rejection, not a proper consecutive history. It stamps the character of Matthew very clearly.
 </p><p>Note #17
 </p><p>In the text I have given a division which may assist in a practical application of the sermon on the Mount. With respect to the subjects contained in it, it might perhaps, though the difference is not very great, be still better divided thus:  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001">Mat 5:1-16</a> contains the complete picture of the character and position of the remnant who received His instructions  their position, as it should be, according to the mind of God. This is complete in itself.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017">Mat 5:17-48</a> establish the authority of the law, which should have regulated the conduct of the faithful until the introduction of the kingdom; the law which they ought to have fulfilled, as well as the words of the prophets, in order that they (the remnant) should be placed on this new ground; and the despisal of which would exclude whoever was guilty of it from the kingdom; for Christ is speaking, not as in the kingdom, but as announcing it as near to come. But, while thus establishing the authority of the law, He takes up the two great elements of evil, treated of only in outward acts in the law, violence and corruption, and judges the evil in the heart (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022">Mat 5:22-28</a>), and at all cost to get rid of it and every occasion of it, thus shewing what was to be the conduct of His disciples, and their state of soul  that which was to characterise them as such. The Lord then takes up certain things borne with by God in Israel, and ordered according to what they could bear. Thus was now brought into the light of a true moral estimate, divorce  marriage being the divinely given basis of all human relationships  and swearing or vowing, the action of man's will in relationship to God; then patience of evil, and fulness of grace, His own blessed character, and carrying with it the moral title to what was His living place  sons of their Father who was in heaven. Instead of weakening that which God required under the law, He would not only have it observed until its fulfilment, but that His disciples should be perfect even as their Father in heaven was perfect. This adds the revelation of the Father, to the moral walk and state which suited the character of sons as it was revealed in Christ.
 </p><p>Chapter 6. We have the motives, the object, which should govern the heart in doing good deeds, in living a religious life. Their eye should be on their Father. This is individual.
 </p><p>Chapter 7. This chapter is essentially occupied with the intercourse that would be suitable between His own people and others  not to judge their brethren and to beware of the profane. He then exhorts them to confidence in asking their Father for what they needed, and instructs them to act towards others with the same grace that they would wish shewn to themselves. This is founded on the knowledge of the goodness of the Father. Finally, He exhorts them to the energy that will enter in at the strait gate, and choose the way of God, cost what it may (for many would like to enter into the kingdom, but not by that gate); and He warns them with respect to those who would seek to deceive them by pretending to have the word of God. It is not only our own hearts that we have to fear, and positive evil, when we would follow the Lord, but also the devices of the enemy and his agents. But their fruits will betray them.
 </p><p>Note #18
 </p><p>It is important however to remark that there is no general spiritualisation of the law, as is often stated. The two great principles of immorality amongst men are treated of (violence and corrupt lust), to which are added voluntary oaths. In these the exigencies of the law and what Christ required are contrasted.
