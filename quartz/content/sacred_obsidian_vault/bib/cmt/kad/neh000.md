 <p>The Book of Nehemiah
 </p><p>Introduction
 </p><p>1. Contents, Division, and Object of the Book of Nehemia
 </p><p>This book, according to its title, contains נחמיה דּברי, and in it Nehemiah relates, almost always in the first person, his journey to Jerusalem, and the work which he there effected. נחמיה דּברי, used as the title of a work, signifies not narratives, but deeds and experiences, and consequently here the history of Nehemiah. Apart from the contents of the book, this title might, in conformity with the twofold meaning of דברים, verba and res, designate both the words or discourses and the acts or undertakings of Nehemiah. But דּברי means words, discourses, only in the titles of prophetical or didactic books, i.e., writings of men whose vocation was the announcement of the word: comp. e.g., <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001">Jer 1:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001">Hos 1:1</a>, and others. In historical writings, on the contrary, the דּברי of the men whose lives and acts are described, are their deeds and experiences: thus דויד דּברי,   <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#029">Ch1 29:29</a>; שׁלמה דּברי, written שׁלמה דּברי ספר על   <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#041">Kg1 11:41</a>, comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#029">Ch2 9:29</a>, - the history of David, of Solomon; ירבעם דּברי,   <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#019">Kg1 14:19</a>, the acts of Jeroboam, which are more exactly defined by the addition אשׁר נלחם ועשׁר מלך. So, too, in the case of the other kings, when reference is made to historical works concerning their reigns. It is in this sense that the title of the present book must be understood; and hence both Luther and de Wette have correctly translated it: the history of Nehemiah. Hence the title only testifies to the fact, that the work at the head of which it stands treats of the things, i.e., of the acts, of Nehemiah, and the events that happened to him, without stating anything concerning its author. That Nehemiah was himself the historian of his own deeds, appears only from the circumstance that the narrative is written in the first person.
 </p><p>The contents of the book are as follows: Nehemiah, the son of Hachaliah, a Jew, of whom nothing further is known, and cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes Longimanus, is plunged into deep affliction by the account he receives from his brother Hanani, and certain other men from Judah, of the sad condition of those who had returned from Babylon, and especially of the state of the ruined walls and gates of Jerusalem. He entreats with fervent supplications the mercy of God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001">Neh 1:1-11</a>), and shortly after seizes a favourable opportunity to request the king to send him to Judah to build the city of his fathers' sepulchres, and to give him letters to the governors on the other side of Euphrates, that they may provide him with wood for building from the royal forests. This petition being graciously acceded to by the monarch, he travels, accompanied by captains of forces and horsemen, to Jerusalem, and soon after his arrival rides by night round the city, accompanied by some few companions, to ascertain the state of the walls. He then communicates to the rulers of the people his resolution to build and restore the walls, and invites them to undertake this work with him (Neh 2). Then follows in Neh 3 a list of the individuals and families who built the several portions of the wall with their gates; and in Neh 4:1-6:19, an account of the difficulties Nehemiah had to overcome in the prosecution of the work, viz.: (1) the attempts of the enemies of the Jews forcibly to oppose and hinder the building, by reason of which the builders were obliged to work with weapons in their hands (4:1-4:17); (2) the oppression of the poorer members of the community by wealthy usurers, which Nehemiah put a stop to by seriously reproving their injustice, and by his own great unselfishness (Neh 5); and (3) the plots made against his life by his enemies, which he frustrated by the courageous faith with which he encountered them. Thus the building of the wall was, notwithstanding all these difficulties, brought to a successful termination (Neh 6). - This work accomplished, Nehemiah directed his efforts towards securing the city against hostile attacks by appointing watches at the gates (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#001">Neh 7:1-3</a>, and increasing the numbers of the dwellers in Jerusalem; in pursuance of which design, he assembled the nobles and people for the purpose of enrolling their names according to their genealogy (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#004">Neh 7:4-5</a>). While occupied with this matter, he found a list of those houses of Judah that had returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel and Joshua; and this he gives, Neh 7:6-73. Then, on the approach of the seventh month of the year, the people assembled at Jerusalem to hear the public reading of the law by Ezra, to keep the new moon and the feast of this month, and, after the celebration of the feast of tabernacles, to observe a day of prayer and fasting, on which occasion the Levites making confession of sin in the name of the congregation, they renewed their covenant with God by entering into an oath to keep the law. This covenant being committed to writing, was sealed by Nehemiah as governor, by the chiefs of the priests, of the Levites, and of the houses of the people, and the contributions for the support of the worship of God and its ministers arranged (Neh 8-10). The decision arrived at concerning the increase of the inhabitants of Jerusalem was next carried into execution, one of every ten dwellers in the provinces being chosen by lot to go to Jerusalem and dwell there (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001">Neh 11:1-2</a>). Then follow lists, (1) of the houses and races who dwelt in Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah and Benjamin (11:3-36); (2) of the priestly and Levitical families who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel and Joshua, and of the heads of priestly and Levitical families in the days of Joiakim the high priest, Nehemiah, and Ezra (Neh 12:1-26). These are succeeded by an account of the solemn dedication of the walls (Neh 12:27-43). Then, finally, after some general remarks on certain institutions of divine worship, and an account of a public reading of the law (Neh 12:44-13:3), the book concludes with a brief narration of what Nehemiah effected during his second sojourn there, after his journey to the court in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, and his return for the purpose of putting a stop to certain illegal acts which had prevailed during his absence, such as marriages with heathen women, non-payment of tithes and dues to Levites, desecration of the Sabbath by field-labour, and by buying and selling (Neh 13:4-31).
 </p><p>According to what has been stated, this book may be divided into three sections. The first, chs. 1-6, treats of the building of the walls and gates of Jerusalem through the instrumentality of Nehemiah; the narrative concerning the occasion of his journey, and the account of the journey itself (Neh 1:1-2:10), forming the introduction. The second, chs. 7-12:43, furnishes a description of the further efforts of Nehemiah to increase and ensure the prosperity of the community in Judah and Jerusalem, first, by securing Jerusalem from hostile attacks; then, by seeking to increase the population of the city; and, lastly, by endeavouring to bring the domestic and civil life of the people into conformity with the precepts of the law, and thus to furnish the necessary moral and religious basis for the due development of the covenant people. The third, Neh 12:44-13:31, states how Nehemiah, during his second sojourn at Jerusalem, continued these efforts for the purpose of ensuring the permanence of the reform which had been undertaken.
 </p><p>The aim of Nehemiah's proceedings was to place the civil prosperity of the Israelites, now returned from exile to the land of their fathers, on a firm basis. Briefly to describe what he effected, at one time by direct personal effort, at another in conjunction with his contemporary Ezra the priest and scribe, is the object of his record. As Nehemiah's efforts for the civil welfare of his people as the congregation of the Lord were but a continuation of those by which Zerubbabel the prince, Joshua the high priest, and Ezra the scribe had effected the foundation of the community of returned exiles, so too does his book form the continuation and completion of that of Ezra, and may in this respect be regarded as its second part. It is, moreover, not merely similar in kind, to the book of Ezra, especially with regard to the insertion of historical and statistical lists and genealogical registries, but has also the same historical object, viz., to show how the people of Israel, after their return from the Babylonian captivity, were by the instrumentality of Nehemiah fully re-established in the land of promise as the congregation of the Lord.
 </p><p>2. Integrity of the Book of Nehemiah, and Date of Its Composition
 </p><p>Nehemiah gives his account of the greater part of his labours for the good of his fellow-countrymen in the first person; and this form of narrative is not only uniformly maintained throughout the first six chapters (from Neh 1:1-7:5), but also recurs in Neh 12:27-43, and from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006">Neh 13:6</a> to the end. The formula too: Think upon me, my God, etc., peculiar to Nehemiah, is repeated <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#019">Neh 5:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#014">Neh 6:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#014">Neh 13:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#022">Neh 13:22</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#029">Neh 13:29</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#031">Neh 13:31</a>. Hence not only has the composition of the larger portion of this book been universally admitted to be the work of Nehemiah, but the integrity of its first section (Neh 1-6) has been generally acknowledged. On the composition and authorship of the second section, 7:73b-12:26, on the contrary, the verdict of modern criticism is almost unanimous in pronouncing it not to have been the work of Nehemiah, but composed from various older documents and records by the compiler of the books of 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah - the so-called chronicler who lived a hundred years later - and by him interpolated in "the record of Nehemiah." This view has been chiefly based upon the facts, that in chs. 8-10 the style is different; that Nehemiah himself is not the prominent person, Ezra occupying the foreground, and Nehemiah being merely the subject of a passing remark (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009">Neh 8:9</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#002">Neh 10:2</a>); that there is in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#014">Neh 8:14</a> no reference to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004">Ezr 3:4</a> with respect to the feast of tabernacles; and that <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001">Ezr 3:1</a> is in verbal accordance with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001">Neh 8:1</a> (Bertheau, Comm. p. 11, and de Wette-Schrader, Einl. in das A. T. 236). Of these reasons, the first (the dissimilarity of style) is an assertion arising from a superficial examination of these chapters, and in support of which nothing further is adduced than that, instead of Elohim, and especially the God of heaven, elsewhere current with Nehemiah when speaking of God, the names Jehovah, Adonai, and Elohim are in this section used promiscuously. In fact, however, the name Elohim is chiefly used even in these chapters, and Jahve but seldom; while in the prayer Neh 9 especially, such other appellations of God occur as Nehemiah, with the solemnity befitting the language of supplication, uses also in the prayer in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001">Neh 1:1-11</a>.
 </p><p>(Note: Compare the exact statement of the case in my Lehrbuch, 149, note 4, which opponents have ignored, because nothing in the way of facts can be brought against it.)
 </p><p>The other three reasons are indeed correct, in so far as they are actual facts, but they prove nothing. It is true that in Neh 8-10 Nehemiah personally occupies a less prominent position than Ezra, but this is because the actions therein related, viz., the public reading of the law, and the direction of the sacred festivals, belonged not to the office of Nehemiah the Tirshatha and royal governor, but to that, of Ezra the scribe, and to the priests and Levites. Even here, however, Nehemiah, as the royal Tirshatha, stands at the head of the assembled people, encourages them in conjunction with Ezra and the priests, and is the first, as praecipuum membrum ecclesiae (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#002">Neh 10:2</a>), to seal the document of the covenant just concluded. Again, though it is certain that in the description of the feast of tabernacles, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#014">Ezr 8:14</a>., there is no express allusion to its former celebration under Zerubbabel and Joshua, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004">Ezr 3:4</a>, yet such allusions are unusual with biblical writers in general. This is shown, e.g., by a comparison of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#001">Ch2 35:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#018">Ch2 35:18</a> with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001">Ch2 30:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#013">Ch2 30:13-26</a>; and yet it has never struck any critic that an argument against the single authorship of 2 Chr. might be found in the fact that no allusion to the earlier passover held under Hezekiah, 2 Chron 30, is made in the description of the passover under Josiah, 2 Chron 35. Finally, the verbal coincidence of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001">Neh 8:1</a> (properly <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#073">Neh 7:73</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001">Neh 8:1</a>) with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001">Ezr 3:1</a> amounts to the statement that "when the seventh month was come, all Israel gathered out of their cities as one man to Jerusalem." All else is totally different; the assembly in Neh 8 pursues entirely different objects and undertakes entirely different matters from that in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001">Ezr 3:1-13</a>. The peculiarities, moreover, of Nehemiah's style could as little appear in what is narrated, chs. 8-10, as in his description of the building of the wall, Neh 3, or in the list of the families who returned from captivity with Zerubbabel and Joshua, Neh 7 - portions which no one has yet seriously objected to as integral parts of the book of Nehemiah. The same remark applies to the list of the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the province, 11:3-36, which even Bertheau and Schrader admit to have originated from the record of Nehemiah, or to have been composed by Nehemiah. If, however, Nehemiah composed these lists, or incorporated them in his record, why should it not also be himself, and not the "subsequent chronicler," who inserted in his work the lists of priests and Levites, 12:1-26, when the description of the dedication of the wall which immediately follows them is evidently his own composition?
 </p><p>One reason for maintaining that these lists of priests and Levites are of later origin than the times of Nehemiah is said to be, that they extend to Jaddua the high priest, who was contemporary with Alexander the Great. If this assertion were as certain as it is confidently brought forward, then indeed these lists might well be regarded as a subsequent interpolation in the book of Nehemiah. For Nehemiah, who was at least thirty years of age when he first came to Jerusalem, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, i.e., b.c. 445, could hardly have lived to witness the overthrow of the Persian monarchy by Alexander, b.c. 330; or, even if he did attain the age of 145, would not have postponed the writing of his book to the last years of his life. When, however, we consider somewhat more closely the priests and Levites in question, we shall perceive that <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001">Neh 12:1-9</a> contains a list of the chiefs of the priests and Levites who returned from captivity with Zerubbabel and Joshua, which consequently descends from the times before Nehemiah; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012">Neh 12:12-21</a>, a list of the heads of the priestly houses in the days of the high priest Joiakim, the son of Joshua; and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#024">Neh 12:24</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#025">Neh 12:25</a>, a list of the heads of chiefs of Levi (of the Levites), with the closing remark, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#026">Neh 12:26</a> : "These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Joshua, and in the days of Nehemiah and Ezra," Now the high priest Joiakim, the son of Joshua, the contemporary of Zerubbabel, was the predecessor and father of the high priest Eliashib, the contemporary of Nehemiah. Consequently both these lists descend from the time previous to Nehemiah's arrival at Jerusalem; and the mention of Ezra and Nehemiah along with Joiakim proves nothing more than that the chiefs of the Levites mentioned in the last list were still living in the days of Nehemiah. Thus these three lists contain absolutely nothing which reaches to a period subsequent to Nehemiah. Between the first and second, however, there stands (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#010">Neh 12:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011">Neh 12:11</a>) the genealogical notice: Joshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim begat Eliashib, Eliashib begat Jonathan (correct reading, Johanan), and Jonathan begat Jaddua; and between the second and third it is said, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022">Neh 12:22</a> : With respect to the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, the heads of houses are recorded, and the priests under the reign of Darius the Persian; and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#023">Neh 12:23</a> : With respect to the sons of Levi, the heads of houses are recorded in the book of the Chronicles even to the days of Johanan. From these verses (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#010">Neh 12:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011">Neh 12:11</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022">Neh 12:22</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#023">Neh 12:23</a>) it is inferred that the lists descend to the time of the high-priesthood of Jaddua, the contemporary of Alexander the Great. To this we reply, that viewing the circumstance that Eliashib was high priest in the time of Nehemiah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001">Neh 3:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004">Neh 13:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#007">Neh 13:7</a>), it cannot be an absolute objection that Jaddua was still living in the days of Alexander the Great, since from the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes Longimanus, i.e., from b.c. 433, to the destruction of the Persian empire b.c. 330, there are only 103 years, a period for which three high priests, each exercising his office thirty-five years, would suffice. But on the other hand, it is very questionable whether in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011">Neh 12:11</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012">Neh 12:12</a> Jaddua is mentioned as the officiating high priest, or only as the son of Johanan, and grandson of Joiada the high priest. The former of these views receives no corroboration from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011">Neh 12:11</a>, for there nothing else is given but the genealogy of the high-priestly line. Nor can it any more be proved from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022">Neh 12:22</a> that the words, "in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, were the Levites recorded or enrolled," are to be understood of four different lists made under four successive high priests. The most natural sense of the words, on the contrary, is that one enrollment took place in the days of these four individuals of the high-priestly house. If Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua were all alive at the same time, this, the most natural view, must also be the correct one, because in each of the other lists of the same chapter, the times of only one high priest are mentioned, and at the close of the list, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#026">Neh 12:26</a>, it is expressly stated that the (previously enrolled) Levites were chiefs in the days of Joiakim, Ezra, and Nehemiah. It is not, moreover, difficult to prove that Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua were living contemporaneously. For Eliashib, whom Nehemiah found high priest at his arrival at Jerusalem (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001">Neh 3:1</a>), being the grandson of Joshua, who returned from Babylon in the year 536 with Zerubbabel, would in 445 be anything but a young man. Indeed, he must then have been about seventy-five years old. Moreover, it appears from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004">Jos 13:4</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#007">Jos 13:7</a>, that in 433, when Nehemiah returned to Artaxerxes, he was still in office, though on Nehemiah's return he was no longer alive, and that he therefore died soon after 433, at the age of about ninety. If, however, this was his age when he died, his son Joiada might then be already sixty-three, his grandson Johanan thirty-six, his great-grandson Jaddua nine, if each were respectively born in the twenty-seventh year of his father's lifetime.
 </p><p>(Note: If Jaddua were on the death of his great-great-grandfather (between 433 and 430 b.c.) about ten years old, he might also live to witness the appearance of Alexander the Great before Jerusalem, 330 b.c. (mentioned by Josephus, Ant. xi. 8. 4), since he would then have attained the age of 110, which does not seem incredible, when it is considered that Jehoiada, the high priest in the reign of Joash, was 130 when he died (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#015">Ch2 24:15</a>).)
 </p><p>The view (of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011">Neh 12:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012">Neh 12:12</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022">Neh 12:22</a>) just stated, is confirmed both by <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022">Neh 12:22</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#023">Neh 12:23</a>, and by <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#028">Neh 13:28</a>. According to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#022">Neh 13:22</a>, the chiefs or heads of the priestly houses were enrolled under the government of Darius the Persian. Now there is no doubt that this Darius is Darius Nothus, the successor of Artaxerxes Longimanus, who reigned from 424 to 404. The notion that Darius Codomanus is intended, rests upon the mistaken view that in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#011">Neh 13:11</a> Jaddua is mentioned as the high priest already in office. According to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023">Neh 13:23</a>, the heads of the houses of the Levites were enrolled in the book of the Chronicles even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. The days of Johanan - that is, the period of his high-priesthood - are here named as the latest date to which the author of this book extends the genealogical lists of the Levites. And this well agrees with the information, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#018">Neh 13:18</a>, that during Nehemiah's absence at Jerusalem, one of the sons of Joiada the high priest allied himself by marriage with Sanballat the Horonite, i.e., married one of his daughters, and was driven away by Nehemiah. If Joiada had even in the days of Nehemiah a married son, Johanan the first-born son of Joiada, the presumptive successor to the high-priesthood, might well have been at that time so long a married man as to have already witnessed the birth of his son Jaddua.
 </p><p>To complete our proof that the contents of Neh 12 do not extend to a period subsequent to Nehemiah, we have still to discuss the question, how long he held office in Judaea, and when he wrote the book in which he relates what he there effected. Both these questions can be answered with sufficient accuracy for our purpose, though the exact year cannot be named. Concerning the time he held office in Jerusalem, he only remarks in his book that he was governor from the twentieth to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, and that in the thirty-second year of that monarch he again returned to the court, and afterwards, ימים לקץ, came back to Jerusalem (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014">Neh 5:14</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006">Neh 13:6</a>). The term ימים לקץ is very indefinite; but the interpretation, "at the end of the year," is incorrect and unsupported. It is quite evident, from the irregularities and transgressions of the law which occurred in the community during his absence from Jerusalem, that Nehemiah must have remained longer than a year at the court, and, indeed, that he did not return for some years. Besides the withholding of the dues to the Levites (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010">Neh 13:10</a>.) and the desecration of the Sabbath (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015">Neh 13:15</a>.), - transgressions of the law which might have occurred soon after Nehemiah's departure, - Eliashib had not only the priest fitted up a chamber in the fore-court of the temple as a dwelling for his connection Tobiah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004">Neh 13:4</a>), but Jews had also married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab, and had children by them who spake not the Jews' language, but only that of Ashdod, in the interval (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023">Neh 13:23</a>). These facts presuppose an absence of several years on the part of Nehemiah, even if many of these unlawful marriages had been previously contracted, and only came to his knowledge after his return. - Neither are there adequate grounds for the notion that Nehemiah lived but a short time after his return to Jerusalem. The suppression of these infringements of the law, which is narrated Neh 13:7-31, might, indeed, have been accomplished in a few months; but we are by no means justified in inferring that this was the last of his labours for the welfare of his fellow-countrymen, and that his own life terminated soon after, because he relates nothing more than his procedure against these transgressions. After the removal of these irregularities, and the re-establishment of legal order in divine worship and social life, he might have lived for a long period at Jerusalem without effecting anything, the record of which it might be important to hand down to posterity. If we suppose him to have been from thirty-five to forty years of age when, being cupbearer to Artaxerxes, he was sent at his own request, in the twentieth year of that monarch's reign (445 b.c.), as governor to Judah, he might well have exercised his office in Judah and Jerusalem from thirty-five to forty years, including his journey back to the court in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, i.e., till 405 b.c. This would make him live till the nineteenth year of Darius Nothus, and not die till he was from seventy-five to eighty years of age. If we further suppose that he composed this book some ten years before his death, i.e., thirty years after his first arrival at Jerusalem, when he had, as far as lay in his power, arranged the affairs of Judah, it would then be possible for him to relate and describe all that is contained in the canonical book of Nehemiah. For in the year 415 b.c., i.e., in the ninth year of Darius Nothus, genealogical lists of priests and Levites of the time of Joiakim the high priest, reaching down to the days of Johanan the son (grandson) of Eliashib, and of the time of the reign of Darius Nothus, might already be written in the book of the Chronicles, as mentioned <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#023">Neh 12:23</a>, compared with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022">Neh 12:22</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#026">Neh 12:26</a>. Then, too, the high priest Joiada might already have been dead, his son Johanan have succeeded to the office, and Jaddua, the son of the latter, have already attained the age of twenty-five. - This book would consequently contain no historical information and no single remark which Nehemiah might not himself have written. Hence the contents of the book itself furnish not the slightest opposition to the view that the whole was the work of Nehemiah.
 </p><p>When, however, we turn our attention to its form, that unity of character to which modern criticism attaches so much importance seems to be wanting in the second half. We have, however, already remarked that neither the lack of prominence given to the person of Nehemiah, nor the circumstance that he is in these chapters spoken of in the third person, furnish incontestable arguments against the integrity of this book. For in the section concerning the dedication of the wall, Neh 12:27-43, Nehemiah's authorship of which no critic has as yet impugned, he only brings himself forward (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#031">Neh 12:31</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#038">Neh 12:38</a>) when mentioning what he had himself appointed and done, while the rest of the narrative is not in the communicative form of speech: we sought the Levites, we offered, etc., which he employs in the account of the making of a covenant, but in the objective form: they sought the Levites, they offered, etc. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#027">Neh 12:27</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#043">Neh 12:43</a>). The want of connection between the several sections seems to us far more striking. Chs. 8-10 form, indeed, a connected section, the commencement of which (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#073">Neh 7:73</a>) by the circumstantial clause, "when the children of Israel dwelt in their cities," combines it, even by a repetition of the very form of words, which the preceding list; but the commencement of Neh 11 is somewhat abrupt, while between <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011">Neh 12:11</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012">Neh 12:12</a> and between <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#026">Neh 12:26</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#027">Neh 12:27</a> of Neh 12 there is nothing to mark the connection. This gives the sections, chs. 8-10 and 12:1-26, the appearance of being subsequent interpolations or insertions in Nehemiah's record; and there is thus much of real foundation for this appearance, that this book is not a continuous narrative or description of Nehemiah's proceedings in Judah, - historical, topographical, and genealogical lists, which interrupt the thread of the history, being inserted in it. But it by no means follows, that because such is the nature of the book, the inserted portions must therefore have been the subsequent interpolations of another hand, in the record composed by Nehemiah. This inference of modern criticism is based upon an erroneous conception of the nature and intention of this book, which is first of all regarded, if not as a biography or diary of Nehemiah, yet as a "record," in which is noted down only the most important facts concerning his journey to Jerusalem and his proceedings there. For this preconception, neither the canonical book of Nehemiah, nor a comparison of those sections which are universally admitted to be his, furnish any adequate support. For with regard, first, to these sections, it is obvious from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014">Neh 5:14</a>, where Nehemiah during the building of the wall reproaches the usurers, saying, "From the time that I was appointed to be governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth to the two-and-thirtieth year of Artaxerxes, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor," that Nehemiah wrote the account of his labours in Judah from memory after the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes. When we compare with this the manner in which he speaks quite incidentally (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006">Neh 13:6</a>.) of his absence from Jerusalem and his journey to the court, in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, and connects the account of the chamber vacated for Tobiah in the fore-court of the temple (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004">Neh 13:4</a>) with the previous narrative of the public reading of the law and the severance of the strangers from Israel by the formula מזּה ולפני, "and before this," making it appear as though this public reading of the law and severance of strangers had followed his return from the court; and further, consider that the public reading of the law mentioned, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001">Neh 13:1</a>, is combined with the section, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044">Neh 12:44</a>, and this section again (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044">Neh 12:44</a>) with the account of the dedication of the wall by the formula, "at that time;" it is undoubtedly obvious that Nehemiah did not write his whole work till the evening of his days, and after he had accomplished all that was most important in the labours he undertook for Jerusalem and his fellow-countrymen, and that he makes no decided distinction between his labours during his second sojourn at Jerusalem and those of his former stay of twelve years.
 </p><p>If, then, these circumstances indisputably show that the work composed by Nehemiah himself did not bear the form of a diary, the admission into it of the list of those who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel and Joshua (Neh 7:6-73) makes it manifest that it was not his intention to give an unbroken narrative, of his efforts and their results in Jerusalem. This list, moreover, which he found when occupied with his plan for increasing the population of Jerusalem, is shown by the words, "I found therein written," to have been admitted by himself into his work, and inserted in his account of what God had put it into his heart to do with respect to the peopling of Jerusalem (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005">Neh 7:5</a>), and of the manner in which he had carried out his resolution (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001">Neh 11:1-2</a>), as a valuable document with respect to the history of the community, although the continuous thread of the narrative was broken by the interpolation. From his admission of this list, we may infer that he also incorporated other not less important documents, such as the lists of the priests and Levites, Neh 12:1-26, in his book, without troubling himself about the continuous progress of the historical narrative, because it was his purpose not merely to portray his own labours in Jerusalem, but to describe the development and circumstances of the reinstated community under his own and Ezra's leadership.

 </p><p>This being the case, there can be no reason whatever for denying Nehemiah's authorship of the account of the religious solemnities in chs. 8-10, especially as the communicative form in which the narrative is written, bears witness that one of the leaders of that assembly of the people composed this account of it, and the expression, "we will not forsake the house of our God," with which it closes (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#039">Neh 10:39</a>), is a form of speech peculiar to Nehemiah, and repeated by him <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#011">Neh 13:11</a>. Such considerations seem to us to do away with any doubts which may have been raised as to the integrity of the whole book, and the authorship of Nehemiah.
