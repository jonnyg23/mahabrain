HIS INTENTION TO SEND TIMOTHY: HIS SENDING EPAPHRODITUS MEANTIME. (Phi. 2:1-30)
 <p>
 </p><p>The "therefore" implies that he is here expanding on the exhortation (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027">Phi 1:27</a>), "In one Spirit, with one mind (soul)." He urges four influencing motives in this verse, to inculcate the four Christian duties corresponding respectively to them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002">Phi 2:2</a>). "That ye be like-minded, having the same love, of one accord, of one mind"; (1) "If there be (with you) any consolation in Christ," that is, any consolation of which Christ is the source, leading you to wish to console me in my afflictions borne for Christ's sake, ye owe it to me to grant my request "that ye be like-minded" [CHRYSOSTOM and ESTIUS]: (2) "If there be any comfort of (that is, flowing from) love," the adjunct of "consolation in Christ"; (3) "If any fellowship of (communion together as Christians, flowing from joint participation in) the Spirit" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014">Co2 13:14</a>). As Pagans meant literally those who were of one village, and drank of one fountain, how much greater is the union which conjoins those who drink of the same Spirit! (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004">Co1 12:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013">Co1 12:13</a>) [GROTIUS]: (4) "If any bowels (tender emotions) and mercies (compassions)," the adjuncts of "fellowship of the Spirit." The opposites of the two pairs, into which the four fall, are reprobated, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003">Phi 2:3-4</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">phi 2:2</a></font></span></p>Fulfil--that is, Make full. I have joy in you, complete it by that which is still wanting, namely, unity (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#009">Phi 1:9</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>likeminded--literally, "that ye be of the same mind"; more general than the following "of one mind." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>having the same love--equally disposed to love and be loved. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>being of one accord--literally, "with united souls." This pairs with the following clause, thus, "With united souls, being of one mind"; as the former two also pair together, "That ye be likeminded, having the same love."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003">Philippians 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">phi 2:3</a></font></span></p>Let nothing be done--The italicized words are not in the Greek. Perhaps the ellipsis had better be supplied from the Greek (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002">Phi 2:2</a>), "Thinking nothing in the way of strife" (or rather, "factious intrigue," "self-seeking," see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016">Phi 1:16</a>). It is the thought which characterizes the action as good or bad before God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>lowliness of mind--The direct relation of this grace is to God alone; it is the sense of dependence of the creature on the Creator as such, and it places all created beings in this respect on a level. The man "lowly of mind" as to his spiritual life is independent of men, and free from all slavish feeling, while sensible of his continual dependence on God. Still it INDIRECTLY affects his behavior toward his fellow men; for, conscious of his entire dependence on God for all his abilities, even as they are dependent on God for theirs, he will not pride himself on his abilities, or exalt self in his conduct toward others (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002">Eph 4:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012">Col 3:12</a>) [NEANDER]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>let each esteem--Translate as Greek, "esteeming each other superior to yourselves." Instead of fixing your eyes on those points in which you excel, fix them on those in which your neighbor excels you: this is true "humility."

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">phi 2:4</a></font></span></p>The oldest manuscripts read, "Not looking each of you (plural, Greek) on his own things (that is, not having regard solely to them), but each of you on the things of others" also. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#021">Phi 2:21</a>; also Paul's own example (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024">Phi 1:24</a>).

He does not put forward himself (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004">Phi 2:4</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024">Phi 1:24</a>) as an example, but Christ, THE ONE pre-eminently who sought not His own, but "humbled Himself" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008">Phi 2:8</a>), first in taking on Him our nature, secondly, in humbling Himself further in that nature (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003">Rom 15:3</a>).

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006">Philippians 2:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">phi 2:6</a></font></span></p>Translate, "Who subsisting (or existing, namely, originally: the Greek is not the simple substantive verb, 'to be') in the form of God (the divine essence is not meant: but the external self-manifesting characteristics of God, the form shining forth from His glorious essence). The divine nature had infinite BEAUTY in itself, even without any creature contemplating that beauty: that beauty was 'the form of God'; as 'the form of a servant' (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007">Phi 2:7</a>), which is in contrasted opposition to it, takes for granted the existence of His human nature, so 'the form of God' takes for granted His divine nature [BENGEL], Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#037">Joh 5:37</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005">Joh 17:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15</a>, 'Who is the IMAGE of the invisible God' at a time before 'every creature,' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004">Co2 4:4</a>, esteemed (the same Greek verb as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003">Phi 2:3</a>) His being on an equality with God no (act of) robbery" or self-arrogation; claiming to one's self what does not belong to him. ELLICOTT, WAHL, and others have translated, "A thing to be grasped at," which would require the Greek to be harpagma, whereas harpagmos means the act of seizing. So harpagmos means in the only other passage where it occurs, PLUTARCH [On the Education of Children, 120]. The same insuperable objection lies against ALFORD'S translation, "He regarded not as self-enrichment (that is, an opportunity for self-exaltation) His equality with God." His argument is that the antithesis (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007">Phi 2:7</a>) requires it, "He used His equality with God as an opportunity, not for self-exaltation, but for self-abasement, or emptying Himself." But the antithesis is not between His being on an equality with God, and His emptying Himself; for He never emptied Himself of the fulness of His Godhead, or His "BEING on an equality with God"; but between His being "in the FORM (that is, the outward glorious self-manifestation) of God," and His "taking on Him the form of a servant," whereby He in a great measure emptied Himself of His precedent "form," or outward self-manifesting glory as God. Not "looking on His own things" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004">Phi 2:4</a>), He, though existing in the form of God, He esteemed it no robbery to be on an equality with God, yet made Himself of no reputation. "Being on an equality with God, is not identical with subsisting in the form of God"; the latter expresses the external characteristics, majesty, and beauty of the Deity, which "He emptied Himself of," to assume "the form of a servant"; the former, "HIS BEING," or NATURE, His already existing STATE OF EQUALITY with God, both the Father and the Son having the same ESSENCE. A glimpse of Him "in the form of God," previous to His incarnation, was given to Moses (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010">Exo 24:10-11</a>), Aaron, &amp;c.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">phi 2:7</a></font></span></p>made himself of no reputation, and . . . and--rather as the Greek, "emptied Himself, taking upon him the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men." The two latter clauses (there being no conjunctions, "and . . . and," in the Greek) expresses in what Christ's "emptying of Himself" consists, namely, in "taking the form of a servant" (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005">Heb 10:5</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#005">Exo 21:5-6</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Psa 40:6</a>, proving that it was at the time when He assumed a body, He took "the form of a servant"), and in order to explain how He took "the form of a servant," there is added, by "being made in the likeness of men." His subjection to the law (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#021">Luk 2:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004">Gal 4:4</a>) and to His parents (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#051">Luk 2:51</a>), His low state as a carpenter, and carpenter's reputed son (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055">Mat 13:55</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003">Mar 6:3</a>), His betrayal for the price of a bond-servant (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032">Exo 21:32</a>), and slave-like death to relieve us from the slavery of sin and death, finally and chiefly, His servant-like dependence as man on God, while His divinity was not outwardly manifested (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003">Isa 49:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007">Isa 49:7</a>), are all marks of His "form as a servant." This proves: (1) He was in the form of a servant as soon as He was made man. (2) He was "in the form of God" before He was "in the form of a servant." (3) He did as really subsist in the divine nature, as in the form of a servant, or in the nature of man. For He was as much "in the form of God" as "in the form of a servant"; and was so in the form of God as "to be on an equality with God"; He therefore could have been none other than God; for God saith, "To whom will ye liken Me and make Me equal?" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#005">Isa 46:5</a>), [BISHOP PEARSON]. His emptying Himself presupposes His previous plenitude of Godhead (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019">Col 1:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009">Col 2:9</a>). He remained full of this; yet He bore Himself as if He were empty.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">phi 2:8</a></font></span></p>being found in fashion as a man--being already, by His "emptying Himself," in the form of a servant, or likeness of man (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003">Rom 8:3</a>), "He humbled Himself (still further by) becoming obedient even unto death (not as English Version, 'He humbled Himself and became,'&amp;c.; the Greek has no 'and,' and has the participle, not the verb), and that the death of the cross." "Fashion" expresses that He had the outward guise, speech, and look. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007">Phi 2:7</a>, in the Greek, the emphasis is on Himself (which stands before the Greek verb), "He emptied Himself," His divine self, viewed in respect to what He had heretofore been; in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008">Phi 2:8</a> the emphasis is on "humbled" (which stands before the Greek "Himself"); He not only "emptied Himself" of His previous "form of God," but submitted to positive HUMILIATION. He "became obedient," namely, to God, as His "servant" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019">Rom 5:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008">Heb 5:8</a>). Therefore "God" is said to "exalt" Him (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009">Phi 2:9</a>), even as it was God to whom He became voluntarily "obedient." "Even unto death" expresses the climax of His obedience (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018">Joh 10:18</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>as ye have . . . obeyed--"even as ye have been obedient," namely, to God, as Jesus was "obedient" unto God (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008">Phi 2:8</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>not as, &amp;c.--"not as if" it were a matter to be done "in my presence only, but now (as things are) much more (with more earnestness) in my absence (because my help is withdrawn from you)" [ALFORD]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>work out--carry out to its full perfection. "Salvation" is "worked in" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013">Phi 2:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011">Eph 1:11</a>) believers by the Spirit, who enables them through faith to be justified once for all; but it needs, as a progressive work, to be "worked out" by obedience, through the help of the same Spirit, unto perfection (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005">Pe2 1:5-8</a>). The sound Christian neither, like the formalist, rests in the means, without looking to the end, and to the Holy Spirit who alone can make the means effectual; nor, like the fanatic, hopes to attain the end without the means. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>your own--The emphasis is on this. Now that I am not present to further the work of your salvation, "work out your own salvation" yourselves the more carefully. Do not think this work cannot go on because I am absent; "for (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013">Phi 2:13</a>) it is God that worketh in you," &amp;c. In this case adopt a rule different from the former (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004">Phi 2:4</a>), but resting on the same principle of "lowliness of mind" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003">Phi 2:3</a>), namely, "look each on his own things," instead of "disputings" with others (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014">Phi 2:14</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>salvation--which is in "Jesus" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010">Phi 2:10</a>), as His name (meaning God-Saviour) implies.

 </p><p>with fear and trembling--the very feeling enjoined on "servants," as to what ought to accompany their "obedience" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005">Eph 6:5</a>). So here: See that, as "servants" to God, after the example of Christ, ye be so "with the fear and trembling" which becomes servants; not slavish fear, but trembling anxiety not to fall short of the goal (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026">Co1 9:26-27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001">Heb 4:1</a>, "Let us fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into His rest, any should come short of it"), resulting from a sense of our human insufficiency, and from the consciousness that all depends on the power of God, "who worketh both to will and to do" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020">Rom 11:20</a>). "Paul, though joyous, writes seriously" [J. J. WOLF].

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">phi 2:13</a></font></span></p>For--encouragement to work: "For it is God who worketh in you," always present with you, though I be absent. It is not said, "Work out your own salvation, though it is God," &amp;c., but, "because it is God who," &amp;c. The will, and the power to work, being first instalments of His grace, encourage us to make full proof of, and carry out to the end, the "salvation" which He has first "worked," and is still "working in" us, enabling us to "work it out." "Our will does nothing thereunto without grace; but grace is inactive without our will" [ST. BERNARD]. Man is, in different senses, entirely active, and entirely passive: God producing all, and we acting all. What He produced is our own acts. It is not that God does some, and we the rest. God does all, and we do all. God is the only proper author, we the only proper actors. Thus the same things in Scripture are represented as from God, and from us. God makes a new heart, and we are commanded to make us a new heart; not merely because we must use the means in order to the effect, but the effect itself is our act and our duty (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019">Eze 11:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#031">Eze 18:31</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026">Eze 36:26</a>) [EDWARDS]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>worketh--rather as Greek, "worketh effectually." We cannot of ourselves embrace the Gospel of grace: "the will" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003">Psa 110:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005">Co2 3:5</a>) comes solely of God's gift to whom He will (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044">Joh 6:44</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#065">Joh 6:65</a>); so also the power "to do" (rather, "to work effectually," as the Greek is the same as that for "worketh in"), that is, effectual perseverance to the end, is wholly of God's gift (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006">Phi 1:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021">Heb 13:21</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>of his good pleasure--rather as Greek, "FOR His good pleasure"; in order to carry out His sovereign gracious purpose towards you (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005">Eph 1:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009">Eph 1:9</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">phi 2:14</a></font></span></p>murmurings--secret murmurings and complaints against your fellow men arising from selfishness: opposed to the example of Jesus just mentioned (compare the use of the word, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#012">Joh 7:12-13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001">Act 6:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#009">Pe1 4:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#016">Jde 1:16</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>disputings--The Greek is translated "doubting" in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008">Ti1 2:8</a>. But here referring to profitless "disputings" with our fellow men, in relation to whom we are called on to be "blameless and harmless" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015">Phi 2:15</a>): so the Greek is translated, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#033">Mar 9:33-34</a>. These disputings flow from "vain glory" reprobated (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003">Phi 2:3</a>); and abounded among the Aristotelian philosophers in Macedon, where Philippi was.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015">Philippians 2:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">phi 2:15</a></font></span></p>blameless and harmless--without either the repute of mischief, or the inclination to do it [ALFORD]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>sons--rather as Greek, "the children of God" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014">Rom 8:14-16</a>). Imitation of our heavenly Father is the instinctive guide to our duty as His children, more than any external law (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044">Mat 5:44-45</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048">Mat 5:48</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>without rebuke--"without (giving handle for) reproach." The whole verse tacitly refers by contrast to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005">Deu 32:5</a>, "Their spot . . . not . . . of His children . . . a perverse and crooked generation" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012">Pe1 2:12</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>ye shine--literally, "appear" [TRENCH]. "Show yourselves" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014">Mat 5:14-16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008">Eph 5:8-13</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>as lights in the world--The Greek expresses "as luminaries in the world," as the sun and moon, "the lights," or "great lights," in the material world or in the firmament. The Septuagint uses the very same Greek word in the passage, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014">Gen 1:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#016">Gen 1:16</a>; compare Note,, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#011">Rev 21:11</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">phi 2:16</a></font></span></p>Holding forth--to them, and so applying it (the common meaning of the Greek; perhaps here including also the other meaning, "holding fast"). The image of light-bearers or luminaries is carried on from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015">Phi 2:15</a>. As the heavenly luminaries' light is closely connected with the life of animals, so ye hold forth the light of Christ's "word" (received from me) which is the "life" of the Gentiles (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004">Joh 1:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001">Jo1 1:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005">Jo1 1:5-7</a>). Christ is "the Light of the world" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012">Joh 8:12</a>); believers are only "light-bearers" reflecting His light. 
 <p>
 </p><p>that I may rejoice in--literally, "with a view to (your being) a subject of rejoicing to me against the day of Christ" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001">Phi 4:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014">Co2 1:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019">Th1 2:19</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that I have not run in vain--that it was not in vain that I labored for your spiritual good.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017">Philippians 2:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">phi 2:17</a></font></span></p>Yea, and if--rather as Greek, "Yea, if even"; implying that he regarded the contingency as not unlikely: He had assumed the possibility of his being found alive at Christ's coming (for in every age Christ designed Christians to stand in preparedness for His coming as at hand): he here puts a supposition which he regards as more likely, namely, his own death before Christ's coming. 
 <p>
 </p><p>I be offered--rather as Greek, "I am poured out." "I am made a libation." Present, not future, as the danger is threatening him now. As in sacrifices libations of wine were "poured upon" the offerings, so he represents his Philippian converts, offered through faith (or else their faith itself), as the sacrifice, and his blood as the libation "poured upon" it (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016">Rom 15:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006">Ti2 4:6</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>service--Greek, "priest's ministration"; carrying out the image of a sacrifice. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>I joy--for myself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021">Phi 1:21</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023">Phi 1:23</a>). His expectation of release from prison is much fainter, than in the Epistles to Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon, written somewhat earlier from Rome. The appointment of Tigellinus to be PrÃ&amp;brvbr;torian Prefect was probably the cause of this change. See Introduction. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>rejoice with you all--ALFORD translates, "I congratulate you all," namely on the honor occurring to you by my blood being poured out on the sacrifice of your faith. If they rejoiced already (as English Version represents), what need of his urging them, "Do ye also joy."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#018">Philippians 2:18</a></p>

From <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019">Phi 2:19-30</a>, it appears Epaphroditus was to set out at once to allay the anxiety of the Philippians on his account, and at the same time bearing the Epistle; Timothy was to follow after the apostle's liberation was decided, when they could arrange their plans more definitely as to where Timothy should, on his return with tidings from Philippi, meet Paul, who was designing by a wider circuit, and slower progress, to reach that city. Paul's reason for sending Timothy so soon after having heard of the Philippians from Epaphroditus was that they were now suffering persecutions (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028">Phi 1:28-30</a>); and besides, Epaphroditus' delay through sickness on his journey to Rome from Philippi, made the tidings he brought to be of less recent date than Paul desired. Paul himself also hoped to visit them shortly. 
 <p>
 </p><p>But I trust--Yet my death is by no means certain; yea, "I hope (Greek) in the Lord (that is, by the Lord's help)" 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>unto you--literally, "for you," that is, to your satisfaction, not merely motion, to you. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>I also--that not only you "may be of good courage" (so Greek) on hearing of me (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#023">Phi 2:23</a>), but "I also, when I know your state."

 <p>
 </p><p>naturally--Greek, "genuinely"; "with sincere solicitude." A case wherein the Spirit of God so changed man's nature, that to be natural was with him to be spiritual: the great point to be aimed at.

This is spoken, by comparison with Timothy; for <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016">Phi 1:16-17</a> implies that some of those with Paul at Rome were genuine Christians, though not so self-sacrificing as Timothy. Few come to the help of the Lord's cause, where ease, fame, and gain have to be sacrificed. Most help only when Christ's gain is compatible with their own (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#017">Jdg 5:17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#023">Jdg 5:23</a>).
