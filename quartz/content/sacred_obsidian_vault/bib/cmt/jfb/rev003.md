 <p>
 </p><p>Sardis--the ancient capital of Lydia, the kingdom of wealthy Croesus, on the river Pactolus. The address to this Church is full of rebuke. It does not seem to have been in vain; for MELITO, bishop of Sardis in the second century, was eminent for piety and learning. He visited Palestine to assure himself and his flock as to the Old Testament canon and wrote an epistle on the subject [EUSEBIUS Ecclesiastical History, 4.26]; he also wrote a commentary on the Apocalypse [EUSEBIUS, Ecclesiastical History, 4.26; JEROME, On Illustrious Men, 24]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>he that hath the seven Spirits of God--that is, He who hath all the fulness of the Spirit (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004">Rev 1:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005">Rev 4:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006">Rev 5:6</a>, with which compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009">Zac 3:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010">Zac 4:10</a>, proving His Godhead). This attribute implies His infinite power by the Spirit to convict of sin and of a hollow profession. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the seven stars-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016">Rev 1:16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020">Rev 1:20</a>). His having the seven stars, or presiding ministers, flows, as a consequence, from His having the seven Spirits, or the fulness of the Holy Spirit. The human ministry is the fruit of Christ's sending down the gifts of the Spirit. Stars imply brilliancy and glory; the fulness of the Spirit, and the fulness of brilliant light in Him, form a designed contrast to the formality which He reproves. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>name . . . livest . . . dead-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006">Ti1 5:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#005">Ti2 3:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016">Tit 1:16</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001">Eph 2:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005">Eph 2:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014">Eph 5:14</a>). "A name," that is, a reputation. Sardis was famed among the churches for spiritual vitality; yet the Heart-searcher, who seeth not as man seeth, pronounces her dead; how great searchings of heart should her case create among even the best of us! Laodicea deceived herself as to her true state (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017">Rev 3:17</a>), but it is not written that she had a high name among the other churches, as Sardis had.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#002">Revelation 3:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">rev 3:2</a></font></span></p>Be--Greek. "Become," what thou art not, "watchful," or "wakeful," literally, "waking." 
 <p>
 </p><p>the things which remain--Strengthen those thy remaining few graces, which, in thy spiritual deadly slumber, are not yet quite extinct [ALFORD]. "The things that remain" can hardly mean "the PERSONS that are not yet dead, but are ready to die"; for <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#004">Rev 3:4</a> implies that the "few" faithful ones at Sardis were not "ready to die," but were full of life. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>are--The two oldest manuscripts read, "were ready," literally, "were about to die," namely, at the time when you "strengthen" them. This implies that "thou art dead," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001">Rev 3:1</a>, is to be taken with limitation; for those must have some life who are told to strengthen the things that remain. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>perfect--literally, "filled up in full complement"; Translate, "complete." Weighed in the balance of Him who requires living faith as the motive of works, and found wanting. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>before God--Greek, "in the sight of God." The three oldest manuscripts, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic, read, "before (in the sight of) MY God"; Christ's judgment is God the Father's judgment. In the sight of men, Sardis had "a name of living": "so many and so great are the obligations of pastors, that he who would in reality fulfil even a third of them, would be esteemed holy by men, whereas, if content with that alone, he would be sure not to escape hell" [JUAN D'AVILA]. Note: in Sardis and Laodicea alone of the seven we read of no conflict with foes within or without the Church. Not that either had renounced the appearance of opposition to the world; but neither had the faithfulness to witness for God by word and example, so as to "torment them that dwelt on the earth" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#010">Rev 11:10</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#003">Revelation 3:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">rev 3:3</a></font></span></p>how thou hast received-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#006">Col 2:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001">Th1 4:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020">Ti1 6:20</a>). What Sardis is to "remember" is, not how joyfully she had received originally the Gospel message, but how the precious deposit was committed to her originally, so that she could not say, she had not "received and heard" it. The Greek is not aorist (as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#004">Rev 2:4</a>, as to Ephesus, "Thou didst leave thy first love"), but "thou hast received" (perfect), and still hast the permanent deposit of doctrine committed to thee. The word "keep" (so the Greek is for English Version, "hold fast") which follows, accords with this sense. "Keep" or observe the commandment which thou hast received and didst hear. 
 <p>
 </p><p>heard--Greek aorist, "didst hear," namely, when the Gospel doctrine was committed to thee. TRENCH explains "how," with what demonstration of the Spirit and power from Christ's ambassadors the truth came to you, and how heartily and zealously you at first received it. Similarly BENGEL, "Regard to her former character (how it once stood) ought to guard Sardis against the future hour, whatsoever it shall be, proving fatal to her." But it is not likely that the Spirit repeats the same exhortation virtually to Sardis as to Ephesus. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>If therefore--seeing thou art so warned, if, nevertheless, &amp;c. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>come on thee as a thief--in special judgment on thee as a Church, with the same stealthiness and as unexpectedly as shall be My visible second coming. As the thief gives no notice of his approach. Christ applies the language which in its fullest sense describes His second coming, to describe His coming in special judgments on churches and states (as Jerusalem, Mat. 24:4-28) these special judgments being anticipatory earnests of that great last coming. "The last day is hidden from us, that every day may be observed by us" [AUGUSTINE]. Twice Christ in the days of His flesh spake the same words (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#042">Mat 24:42-43</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#039">Luk 12:39-40</a>); and so deeply had His words been engraven on the minds of the apostles that they are often repeated in their writings (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015">Rev 16:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002">Th1 5:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004">Th1 5:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006">Th1 5:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010">Pe2 3:10</a>). The Greek proverb was that "the feet of the avenging deities are shod with wool," expressing the noiseless approach of the divine judgments, and their possible nearness at the moment when they were supposed the farthest off [TRENCH].
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#004">Revelation 3:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">rev 3:4</a></font></span></p>The three oldest manuscripts prefix "but," or "nevertheless" (notwithstanding thy spiritual deadness), and omit "even." 
 <p>
 </p><p>names--persons named in the book of life (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005">Rev 3:5</a>) known by name by the Lord as His own. These had the reality corresponding to their name; not a mere name among men as living, while really dead (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001">Rev 3:1</a>). The gracious Lord does not overlook any exceptional cases of real saints in the midst of unreal professors. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>not defiled their garments--namely, the garments of their Christian profession, of which baptism is the initiatory seal, whence the candidates for baptism used in the ancient Church to be arrayed in white. Compare also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027">Eph 5:27</a>, as to the spotlessness of the Church when she shall be presented to Christ; and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008">Rev 19:8</a>, as to the "fine linen, clean and white, the righteousness of the saints," in which it shall be granted to her to be arrayed; and "the wedding garment." Meanwhile she is not to sully her Christian profession with any defilement of flesh or spirit, but to "keep her garments." For no defilement shall enter the heavenly city. Not that any keep themselves here wholly free from defilement; but, as compared with hollow professors, the godly keep themselves unspotted from the world; and when they do contract it, they wash it away, so as to have their "robes white in the blood of the Lamb" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014">Rev 7:14</a>). The Greek is not "to stain" (Greek, "miainein"), but to "defile," or besmear (Greek, "molunein"), <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#003">Sol 5:3</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>they shall walk with me in white--The promised reward accords with the character of those to be rewarded: keeping their garments undefiled and white through the blood of the Lamb now, they shall walk with Him in while hereafter. On "with me," compare the very same words, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043">Luk 23:43</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024">Joh 17:24</a>. "Walk" implies spiritual life, for only the living walk; also liberty, for it is only the free who walk at large. The grace and dignity of flowing long garments is seen to best advantage when the person "walks": so the graces of the saint's manifested character shall appear fully when he shall serve the Lord perfectly hereafter (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003">Rev 22:3</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>they are worthy--with the worthiness (not their own, but that) which Christ has put on them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014">Rev 7:14</a>). <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#014">Eze 16:14</a>, "perfect through MY comeliness which I had put upon thee." Grace is glory in the bud. "The worthiness here denotes a congruity between the saint's state of grace on earth, and that of glory, which the Lord has appointed for them, about to be estimated by the law itself of grace" [VITRINGA]. Contrast <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046">Act 13:46</a>.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005">Revelation 3:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">rev 3:5</a></font></span></p>white--not a dull white, but glittering, dazzling white [GROTIUS]. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043">Mat 13:43</a>. The body transfigured into the likeness of Christ's body, and emitting beams of light reflected from Him, is probably the "white raiment" promised here. 
 <p>
 </p><p>the same--Greek, "THIS man"; he and he alone. So one oldest manuscript reads. But two oldest manuscripts, and most of the ancient versions, "shall THUS be clothed," &amp;c. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>raiment--Greek, "garments." "He that overcometh" shall receive the same reward as they who "have not defiled their garments" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#004">Rev 3:4</a>); therefore the two are identical. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>I will not--Greek, "I will not by any means." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>blot out . . . name out of . . . book of life--of the heavenly city. A register was kept in ancient cities of their citizens: the names of the dead were of course erased. So those who have a name that they live and are dead (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001">Rev 3:1</a>), are blotted out of God's roll of the heavenly citizens and heirs of eternal life; not that in God's electing decree they ever were in His book of life. But, according to human conceptions, those who had a high name for piety would be supposed to be in it, and were, in respect to privileges, actually among those in the way of salvation; but these privileges, and the fact that they once might have been saved, shall be of no avail to them. As to the book of life, compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008">Rev 13:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008">Rev 17:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012">Rev 20:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015">Rev 20:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027">Rev 21:27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032">Exo 32:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028">Psa 69:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001">Dan 12:1</a>. In the sense of the "call," many are enrolled among the called to salvation, who shall not be found among the chosen at last. The pale of salvation is wider than that of election. Election is fixed. Salvation is open to all and is pending (humanly speaking) in the case of those mentioned here. But <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015">Rev 20:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027">Rev 21:27</a>, exhibit the book of the elect alone in the narrower sense, after the erasure of the others. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>before . . . before--Greek, "in the presence of." Compare the same promise of Christ's confessing before His Father those who confessed Him, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032">Mat 10:32-33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#008">Luk 12:8-9</a>. He omits "in heaven" after "My Father," because there is, now that He is in heaven, no contrast between the Father in heaven and the Son on earth. He now sets His seal from heaven upon many of His words uttered on earth [TRENCH]. An undesigned coincidence, proving that these epistles are, as they profess, in their words, as well as substance, Christ's own addresses; not even tinged with the color of John's style, such as it appears in his Gospel and Epistles. The coincidence is mainly with the three other Gospels, and not with John's, which makes the coincidence more markedly undesigned. So also the clause, "He that hath an ear, let him hear," is not repeated from John's Gospel, but from the Lord's own words in the three synoptic Gospels (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#015">Mat 11:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#009">Mat 13:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#009">Mar 4:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#023">Mar 4:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#016">Mar 7:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#008">Luk 8:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#035">Luk 14:35</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#006">Revelation 3:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">rev 3:6</a></font></span></p>(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007">Rev 2:7</a>.)
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007">Revelation 3:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">rev 3:7</a></font></span></p>Philadelphia--in Lydia, twenty-eight miles southeast of Sardis, built by Attalus Philadelphus, king of Pergamos, who died A.D. 138. It was nearly destroyed by an earthquake in the reign of Tiberius [TACITUS, Annals, 2.47]. The connection of this Church with Jews there causes the address to it to have an Old Testament coloring in the images employed. It and Smyrna alone of the seven receive unmixed praise. 
 <p>
 </p><p>he that is holy--as in the Old Testament, "the Holy One of Israel." Thus Jesus and the God of the Old Testament are one. None but God is absolutely holy (Greek, "hagios," separate from evil and perfectly hating it). In contrast to "the synagogue of Satan" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009">Rev 3:9</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>true--Greek, "alethinos": "VERY God," as distinguished from the false gods and from all those who say that they are what they are not (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009">Rev 3:9</a>): real, genuine. Furthermore, He perfectly realizes all that is involved in the names, GOD, Light (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009">Joh 1:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008">Jo1 2:8</a>), Bread (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032">Joh 6:32</a>), the Vine (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001">Joh 15:1</a>); as distinguished from all typical, partial, and imperfect realizations of the idea. His nature answers to His name (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003">Joh 17:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009">Th1 1:9</a>). The Greek, "alethes," on the other hand, is "truth-speaking," "truth-loving" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033">Joh 3:33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002">Tit 1:2</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>he that hath the key of David--the antitype of Eliakim, to whom the "key," the emblem of authority "over the house of David," was transferred from Shebna, who was removed from the office of chamberlain or treasurer, as unworthy of it. Christ, the Heir of the throne of David, shall supplant all the less worthy stewards who have abused their trust in God's spiritual house, and "shall reign over the house of Jacob," literal and spiritual (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032">Luk 1:32-33</a>), "for ever," "as a Son over His own house" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002">Heb 3:2-6</a>). It rests with Christ to open or shut the heavenly palace, deciding who is, and who is not, to be admitted: as He also opens, or shuts, the prison, having the keys of hell (the grave) and death (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018">Rev 1:18</a>). The power of the keys was given to Peter and the other apostles, only when, and in so far as, Christ made him and them infallible. Whatever degrees of this power may have been committed to ministers, the supreme power belongs to Christ alone. Thus Peter rightly opened the Gospel door to the Gentiles (Acts 10:1-48; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#017">Act 11:17-18</a>; especially <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027">Act 14:27</a>, end). But he wrongly tried to shut the door in part again (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011">Gal 2:11-18</a>). Eliakim had "the key of the house of David laid upon his shoulder": Christ, as the antitypical David, Himself has the key of the supreme "government upon His shoulder." His attribute here, as in the former addresses, accords with His promise. Though "the synagogue of Satan," false "Jews" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009">Rev 3:9</a>) try to "shut" the "door" which I "set open before thee"; "no man can shut it" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008">Rev 3:8</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>shutteth--So Vulgate and Syriac Versions read. But the four oldest manuscripts read, "shall shut"; so Coptic Version and ORIGEN. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and no man openeth--Two oldest manuscripts, B, Aleph, Coptic Version, and ORIGEN read, "shall open." Two oldest manuscripts, A, C, and Vulgate Version support English Version reading.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008">Revelation 3:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">rev 3:8</a></font></span></p>I have set--Greek, "given": it is My gracious gift to thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>open door--for evangelization; a door of spiritual usefulness. The opening of a door by Him to the Philadelphian Church accords with the previous assignation to Him of "the key of David." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and--The three oldest manuscripts, A, B, C, and ORIGEN read, "which no man can shut." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for--"because." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>a little--This gives the idea that Christ says, He sets before Philadelphia an open door because she has some little strength; whereas the sense rather is, He does so because she has "but little strength": being consciously weak herself, she is the fitter object for God's power to rest on [so AQUINAS], that so the Lord Christ may have all the glory. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and hast kept--and so, the littleness of thy strength becoming the source of Almighty power to thee, as leading thee to rest wholly on My great power, thou hast kept My word. GROTIUS makes "little strength" to mean that she had a Church small in numbers and external resources: "a little flock poor in worldly goods, and of small account in the eyes of men" [TRENCH]. So ALFORD. I prefer the view given above. The Greek verbs are in the aorist tense: "Thou didst keep . . . didst not deny My name": alluding to some particular occasion when her faithfulness was put to the test.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009">Revelation 3:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">rev 3:9</a></font></span></p>I will make--Greek present, "I make," literally, "I give" (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008">Rev 3:8</a>). The promise to Philadelphia is larger than that to Smyrna. To Smyrna the promise was that "the synagogue of Satan" should not prevail against the faithful in her: to Philadelphia, that she should even win over some of "the synagogue of Satan" to fall on their faces and confess God is in her of a truth. Translate, "(some) of the synagogue." For until Christ shall come, and all Israel then be saved, there is but "a remnant" being gathered out of the Jews "according to the election of grace." This is an instance of how Christ set before her an "open door," some of her greatest adversaries, the Jews, being brought to the obedience of the faith. Their worshipping before her feet expresses the convert's willingness to take the very lowest place in the Church, doing servile honor to those whom once they persecuted, rather than dwell with the ungodly. So the Philippian jailer before Paul.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010">Revelation 3:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">rev 3:10</a></font></span></p>patience--"endurance." "The word of My endurance" is My Gospel word, which teaches patient endurance in expectation of my coming (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009">Rev 1:9</a>). My endurance is the endurance which I require, and which I practice. Christ Himself now endures, patiently waiting until the usurper be cast out, and all "His enemies be made His footstool." So, too, His Church, for the joy before her of sharing His coming kingdom, endures patiently. Hence, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#011">Rev 3:11</a>, follows, "Behold, I come quickly." 
 <p>
 </p><p>I also--The reward is in kind: "because thou didst keep," &amp;c. "I also (on My side) will keep thee," &amp;c. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>from--Greek, "(so as to deliver thee) out of," not to exempt from temptation. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the hour of temptation--the appointed season of affliction and temptation (so in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034">Deu 4:34</a> the plagues are called "the temptations of Egypt"), literally, "the temptation": the sore temptation which is coming on: the time of great tribulation before Christ's second coming. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>to try them that dwell upon the earth--those who are of earth, earthy (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#013">Rev 8:13</a>). "Dwell" implies that their home is earth, not heaven. All mankind, except the elect (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008">Rev 13:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014">Rev 13:14</a>). The temptation brings out the fidelity of those kept by Christ and hardens the unbelieving reprobates (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#020">Rev 9:20-21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#011">Rev 16:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021">Rev 16:21</a>). The particular persecutions which befell Philadelphia shortly after, were the earnest of the great last tribulation before Christ's coming, to which the Church's attention in all ages is directed.

 <p>
 </p><p>I come quickly--the great incentive to persevering faithfulness, and the consolation under present trials. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that . . . which thou hast--"The word of my patience," or "endurance" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010">Rev 3:10</a>), which He had just commended them for keeping, and which involved with it the attaining of the kingdom; this they would lose if they yielded to the temptation of exchanging consistency and suffering for compromise and ease. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that no man take thy crown--which otherwise thou wouldst receive: that no tempter cause thee to lose it: not that the tempter would thus secure it for himself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018">Col 2:18</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">rev 3:12</a></font></span></p>pillar in the temple--In one sense there shall be "no temple" in the heavenly city because there shall be no distinction of things into sacred and secular, for all things and persons shall be holy to the Lord. The city shall be all one great temple, in which the saints shall be not merely stones, as m the spiritual temple now on earth, but all eminent as pillars: immovably firm (unlike Philadelphia, the city which was so often shaken by earthquakes, STRABO [12 and 13]), like the colossal pillars before Solomon's temple, Boaz (that is, "In it is strength") and Jachin ("It shall be established"): only that those pillars were outside, these shall be within the temple. 
 <p>
 </p><p>my God--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007">Rev 2:7</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>go no more out--The Greek is stronger, never more at all. As the elect angels are beyond the possibility of falling, being now under (as the Schoolmen say) "the blessed necessity of goodness," so shall the saints be. The door shall be once for all shut, as well to shut safely in for ever the elect, as to shut out the lost (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#010">Mat 25:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#035">Joh 8:35</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#023">Isa 22:23</a>, the type, Eliakim). They shall be priests for ever unto God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006">Rev 1:6</a>). "Who would not yearn for that city out of which no friend departs, and into which no enemy enters?" [AUGUSTINE in TRENCH]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>write upon him the name of my God--as belonging to God in a peculiar sense (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003">Rev 7:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#004">Rev 9:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001">Rev 14:1</a>; and especially <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004">Rev 22:4</a>), therefore secure. As the name of Jehovah ("Holiness to the Lord") was on the golden plate on the high priest's forehead (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036">Exo 28:36-38</a>); so the saints in their heavenly royal priesthood shall bear His name openly, as consecrated to Him. Compare the caricature of this in the brand on the forehead of the beast's followers (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#016">Rev 13:16-17</a>), and on the harlot (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005">Rev 17:5</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004">Rev 20:4</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>name of the city of my God--as one of its citizens (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002">Rev 21:2-3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010">Rev 21:10</a>, which is briefly alluded to by anticipation here). The full description of the city forms the appropriate close of the book. The saint's citizenship is now hidden, but then it shall be manifested: he shall have the right to enter in through the gates into the city (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014">Rev 22:14</a>). This was the city which Abraham looked for. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>new--Greek, "kaine." Not the old Jerusalem, once called "the holy city," but having forfeited the name. Greek, "nea," would express that it had recently come into existence; but Greek, "kaine," that which is new and different, superseding the worn-out old Jerusalem and its polity. "John, in the Gospel, applies to the old city the Greek name Hierosolyma. But in the Apocalypse, always, to the heavenly city the Hebrew name, Hierousalem. The Hebrew name is the original and holier one: the Greek, the recent and more secular and political one" [BENGEL]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>my new name--at present incommunicable and only known to God: to be hereafter revealed and made the believer's own in union with God in Christ. Christ's name written on him denotes he shall be wholly Christ's. New also relates to Christ, who shall assume a new character (answering to His "new name") entering with His saints on a kingdom--not that which He had with the Father before the worlds, but that earned by His humiliation as Son of man. GIBBON, the infidel [Decline and Fall, ch. 64], gives an unwilling testimony to the fulfilment of the prophecy as to Philadelphia from a temporal point of view, Among the Greek colonies and churches of Asia, Philadelphia is still erect,--a column in a scene of ruins--a pleasing example that the paths of honor and safety may sometimes be the same."

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">rev 3:14</a></font></span></p>Laodiceans--The city was in the southwest of Phrygia, on the river Lycus, not far from Colosse, and lying between it and Philadelphia. It was destroyed by an earthquake, A.D. 62, and rebuilt by its wealthy citizens without the help of the state [TACITUS, Annals, 14.27]. This wealth (arising from the excellence of its wools) led to a self-satisfied, lukewarm state in spiritual things, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017">Rev 3:17</a> describes. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016">Col 4:16</a>, on the Epistle which is thought to have been written to the Laodicean Church by Paul. The Church in latter times was apparently flourishing; for one of the councils at which the canon of Scripture was determined was held in Laodicea in A.D. 361. Hardly a Christian is now to be found on or near its site. 
 <p>
 </p><p>the Amen-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016">Isa 65:16</a>, Hebrew, "Bless Himself in the God of Amen . . . swear by the God of Amen," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020">Co2 1:20</a>). He who not only says, but is, the Truth. The saints used Amen at the end of prayer, or in assenting to the word of God; but none, save the Son of God, ever said, "Amen, I say unto you," for it is the language peculiar to God, who avers by Himself. The New Testament formula, "Amen. I say unto you," is equivalent to the Old Testament formula, "as I live, saith Jehovah." In John's Gospel alone He uses (in the Greek) the double "Amen," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051">Joh 1:51</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003">Joh 3:3</a>, &amp;c.; in English Version," Verily, verily." The title happily harmonizes with the address. His unchanging faithfulness as "the Amen" contrasts with Laodicea's wavering of purpose, "neither hot nor cold" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#016">Rev 3:16</a>). The angel of Laodicea has with some probability been conjectured to be Archippus, to whom, thirty years previously, Paul had already given a monition, as needing to be stirred up to diligence in his ministry. So the Apostolic Constitutions, [8.46], name him as the first bishop of Laodicea: supposed to be the son of Philemon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002">Plm 1:2</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>faithful and true witness--As "the Amen" expresses the unchangeable truth of His promises; so "the faithful the true witness," the truth of His revelations as to the heavenly things which He has seen and testifies. "Faithful," that is, trustworthy (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011">Ti2 2:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013">Ti2 2:13</a>). "True" is here (Greek, "alethinos") not truth-speaking (Greek, "alethes"), but "perfectly realizing all that is comprehended in the name Witness" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013">Ti1 6:13</a>). Three things are necessary for this: (1) to have seen with His own eyes what He attests; (2) to be competent to relate it for others; (3) to be willing truthfully to do so. In Christ all these conditions meet [TRENCH]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>beginning of the creation of God--not he whom God created first, but as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15-18</a> (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15-18</a>), the Beginner of all creation, its originating instrument. All creation would not be represented adoring Him, if He were but one of themselves. His being the Creator is a strong guarantee for His faithfulness as "the Witness and Amen."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#015">Revelation 3:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">rev 3:15</a></font></span></p>neither cold--The antithesis to "hot," literally, "boiling" ("fervent," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025">Act 18:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#011">Rom 12:11</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006">Sol 8:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#032">Luk 24:32</a>), requires that "cold" should here mean more than negatively cold; it is rather, positively icy cold: having never yet been warmed. The Laodiceans were in spiritual things cold comparatively, but not cold as the world outside, and as those who had never belonged to the Church. The lukewarm state, if it be the transitional stage to a warmer, is a desirable state (for a little religion, if real, is better than none); but most fatal when, as here, an abiding condition, for it is mistaken for a safe state (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017">Rev 3:17</a>). This accounts for Christ's desiring that they were cold rather than lukewarm. For then there would not be the same "danger of mixed motive and disregarded principle" [ALFORD]. Also, there is more hope of the "cold," that is, those who are of the world, and not yet warmed by the Gospel call; for, when called, they may become hot and fervent Christians: such did the once-cold publicans, Zaccheus and Matthew, become. But the lukewarm has been brought within reach of the holy fire, without being heated by it into fervor: having religion enough to lull the conscience in false security, but not religion enough to save the soul: as Demas, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010">Ti2 4:10</a>. Such were the halters between two opinions in Israel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021">Kg1 18:21</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#041">Kg2 17:41</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024">Mat 6:24</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">rev 3:16</a></font></span></p>neither cold nor hot--So one oldest manuscript, B, and Vulgate read. But two oldest manuscripts, Syriac, and Coptic transpose thus, "hot nor cold." It is remarkable that the Greek adjectives are in the masculine, agreeing with the angel, not feminine, agreeing with the Church. The Lord addresses the angel as the embodiment and representative of the Church. The chief minister is answerable for his flock if he have not faithfully warned the members of it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>I will--Greek, "I am about to," "I am ready to": I have it in my mind: implying graciously the possibility of the threat not being executed, if only they repent at once. His dealings towards them will depend on theirs towards Him. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>spue thee out of my month--reject with righteous loathing, as Canaan spued out its inhabitants for their abominations. Physicians used lukewarm water to cause vomiting. Cold and hot drinks were common at feasts, but never lukewarm. There were hot and cold springs near Laodicea.

 <p>
 </p><p>thou sayest--virtually and mentally, if not in so many words. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>increased with goods--Greek, "have become enriched," implying self-praise in self-acquired riches. The Lord alludes to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008">Hos 12:8</a>. The riches on which they prided themselves were spiritual riches; though, doubtless, their spiritual self-sufficiency ("I have need of nothing") was much fostered by their worldly wealth; as, on the other hand, poverty of spirit is fostered by poverty in respect to worldly riches. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>knowest not that thou--in particular above all others. The "THOU" in the Greek is emphatic. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>art wretched--Greek, "art the wretched one." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>miserable--So one oldest manuscripts reads. But two oldest manuscripts prefix "the." Translate, "the pitiable"; "the one especially to be pitied." How different Christ's estimate of men, from their own estimate of themselves, "I have need of nothing!" 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>blind--whereas Laodicea boasted of a deeper than common insight into divine things. They were not absolutely blind, else eye-salve would have been of no avail to them; but short-sighted.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018">Revelation 3:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">rev 3:18</a></font></span></p>Gentle and loving irony. Take My advice, thou who fanciest thyself in need of nothing. Not only art thou not in need of nothing, but art in need of the commonest necessaries of existence. He graciously stoops to their modes of thought and speech: Thou art a people ready to listen to any counsel as to how to buy to advantage; then, listen to My counsel (for I am "Counsellor," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa 9:6</a>), buy of ME" (in whom, according to Paul's Epistle written to the neighboring Colosse and intended for the Laodicean Church also, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001">Col 2:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003">Col 2:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016">Col 4:16</a>, are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge). "Buy" does not imply that we can, by any work or merit of ours, purchase God's free gift; nay the very purchase money consists in the renunciation of all self-righteousness, such as Laodicea had (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017">Rev 3:17</a>). "Buy" at the cost of thine own self-sufficiency (so Paul, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#007">Phi 3:7-8</a>); and the giving up of all things, however dear to us, that would prevent our receiving Christ's salvation as a free gift, for example, self and worldly desires. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001">Isa 55:1</a>, "Buy . . . without money and price." 
 <p>
 </p><p>of me--the source of "unsearchable riches" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008">Eph 3:8</a>). Laodicea was a city of extensive money transactions [CICERO]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>gold tried in, &amp;c.--literally, "fired (and fresh) from the fire," that is, just fresh from the furnace which has proved its purity, and retaining its bright gloss. Sterling spiritual wealth, as contrasted with its counterfeit, in which Laodicea boasted itself. Having bought this gold she will be no longer poor (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017">Rev 3:17</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>mayest be rich--Greek, "mayest be enriched." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>white raiment--"garments." Laodicea's wools were famous. Christ offers infinitely whiter raiment. As "gold tried in the fire" expresses faith tested by fiery trials: so "white raiment," Christ's righteousness imputed to the believer in justification and imparted in sanctification. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>appear--Greek, "be manifested," namely, at the last day, when everyone without the wedding garment shall be discovered. To strip one, is in the East the image of putting to open shame. So also to clothe one with fine apparel is the image of doing him honor. Man can discover his shame, God alone can cover it, so that his nakedness shall not be manifested at last (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010">Col 3:10-14</a>). Blessed is he whose sin is so covered. The hypocrite's shame may be manifested now; it must be so at last. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>anoint . . . with eye-salve--The oldest manuscripts read, "(buy of Me) eye-salve (collyrium, a roll of ointment), to anoint thine eyes." Christ has for Laodicea an ointment far more precious than all the costly unguents of the East. The eye is here the conscience or inner light of the mind. According as it is sound and "single" (Greek, "haplous," "simple"), or otherwise, the man sees aright spiritually, or does not. The Holy Spirit's unction, like the ancient eye-salve's, first smarts with conviction of sin, then heals. He opens our eyes first to ourselves in our wretchedness, then to the Saviour in His preciousness. TRENCH notices that the most sunken churches of the seven, namely, Sardis and Laodicea, are the ones in which alone are specified no opponents from without, nor heresies from within. The Church owes much to God's overruling Providence which has made so often internal and external foes, in spite of themselves, to promote His cause by calling forth her energies in contending for the faith once delivered to the saints. Peace is dearly bought at the cost of spiritual stagnation, where there is not interest enough felt in religion to contend about it at all.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#019">Revelation 3:19</a></p>

So in the case of Manasseh (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011">Ch2 33:11-13</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>As many--All. "He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth. And shalt thou be an exception? If excepted from suffering the scourge, thou art excepted from the number of the sons" [AUGUSTINE]. This is an encouragement to Laodicea not to despair, but to regard the rebuke as a token for good, if she profit by it. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>I love--Greek, "philo," the love of gratuitous affection, independent of any grounds for esteem in the object loved. But in the case of Philadelphia (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009">Rev 3:9</a>), "I have loved thee" (Greek, "egapesa") with the love of esteem, founded on the judgment. Compare the note in my English Gnomon of BENGEL, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015">Joh 21:15-17</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>I rebuke--The "I" in the Greek stands first in the sentence emphatically. I in My dealings, so altogether unlike man's, in the case of all whom I love, rebuke. The Greek, "elencho," is the same verb as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008">Joh 16:8</a>, "(the Holy Ghost) will convince (rebuke unto conviction) the world of sin." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>chasten--"chastise." The Greek, "paideu," which in classical Greek means to instruct, in the New Testament means to instruct by chastisement (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005">Heb 12:5-6</a>). David was rebuked unto conviction, when he cried, "I have sinned against the Lord"; the chastening followed when his child was taken from him (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#013">Sa2 12:13-14</a>). In the divine chastening, the sinner at one and the same time winces under the rod and learns righteousness. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>be zealous--habitually. Present tense in the Greek, of a lifelong course of zeal. The opposite of "lukewarm." The Greek by alliteration marks this: Laodicea had not been "hot" (Greek, "zestos"), she is therefore urged to "be zealous" (Greek, "zeleue"): both are derived from the same verb, Greek, "zeo," "to boil." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>repent--Greek aorist: of an act to be once for all done, and done at once.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020">Revelation 3:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">rev 3:20</a></font></span></p>stand--waiting in wonderful condescension and long-suffering. 
 <p>
 </p><p>knock-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002">Sol 5:2</a>). This is a further manifestation of His loving desire for the sinner's salvation. He who is Himself "the Door," and who bids us "knock" that it may be "opened unto" us, is first Himself to knock at the door of our hearts. If He did not knock first, we should never come to knock at His door. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#004">Sol 5:4-6</a>, which is plainly alluded to here; the Spirit thus in Revelation sealing the canonicity of that mystical book. The spiritual state of the bride there, between waking and sleeping, slow to open the door to her divine lover, answers to that of the lukewarm Laodicea here. "Love in regard to men emptied (humbled) God; for He does not remain in His place and call to Himself the servant whom He loved, but He comes down Himself to seek him, and He who is all-rich arrives at the lodging of the pauper, and with His own voice intimates His yearning love, and seeks a similar return, and withdraws not when disowned, and is not impatient at insult, and when persecuted still waits at the doors" [NICOLAUS CABASILAS in TRENCH]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>my voice--He appeals to the sinner not only with His hand (His providences) knocking, but with His voice (His word read or heard; or rather, His Spirit inwardly applying to man's spirit the lessons to be drawn from His providence and His word). If we refuse to answer to His knocking at our door now, He will refuse to hear our knocking at His door hereafter. In respect to His second coming also, He is even now at the door, and we know not how soon He may knock: therefore we should always be ready to open to Him immediately. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>if any man hear--for man is not compelled by irresistible force: Christ knocks, but does not break open the door, though the violent take heaven by the force of prayer (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012">Mat 11:12</a>): whosoever does hear, does so not of himself, but by the drawings of God's grace (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044">Joh 6:44</a>): repentance is Christ's gift (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031">Act 5:31</a>). He draws, not drags. The Sun of righteousness, like the natural sun, the moment that the door is opened, pours in His light, which could not previously find an entrance. Compare HILARY on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019">Psa 118:19</a>.

 </p><p>sup with him, and he with me--Delightful reciprocity! Compare "dwelleth in me, and I in Him," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#056">Joh 6:56</a>. Whereas, ordinarily, the admitted guest sups with the admitter, here the divine guest becomes Himself the host, for He is the bread of life, and the Giver of the marriage feast. Here again He alludes to the imagery of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016">Sol 4:16</a>, where the Bride invites Him to eat pleasant fruits, even as He had first prepared a feast for her, "His fruit was sweet to my taste." Compare the same interchange, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#009">Joh 21:9-13</a>, the feast being made up of the viands that Jesus brought, and those which the disciples brought. The consummation of this blessed intercommunion shall be at the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, of which the Lord's Supper is the earnest and foretaste.

The same whom Christ had just before threatened to spue out of His mouth, is now offered a seat with Him on His throne! "The highest place is within reach of the lowest; the faintest spark of grace may be fanned into the mightiest flame of love" [TRENCH]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>even as I also--Two thrones are here mentioned: (1) His Father's, upon which He now sits, and has sat since His ascension, after His victory over death, sin, the world; upon this none can sit save God, and the God-man Christ Jesus, for it is the incommunicable prerogative of God alone; (2) the throne which shall be peculiarly His as the once humbled and then glorified Son of man, to be set up over the whole earth (heretofore usurped by Satan) at His coming again; in this the victorious saints shall share (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002">Co1 6:2</a>). The transfigured elect Church shall with Christ judge and reign over the nations in the flesh, and Israel the foremost of them; ministering blessings to them as angels were the Lord's mediators of blessing and administrators of His government in setting up His throne in Israel at Sinai. This privilege of our high calling belongs exclusively to the present time while Satan reigns, when alone there is scope for conflict and for victory (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011">Ti2 2:11-12</a>). When Satan shall be bound (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004">Rev 20:4</a>), there shall be no longer scope for it, for all on earth shall know the Lord from the least to the greatest. This, the grandest and crowning promise, is placed at the end of all the seven addresses, to gather all in one. It also forms the link to the next part of the book, where the Lamb is introduced seated on His Father's throne (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#002">Rev 4:2-3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005">Rev 5:5-6</a>). The Eastern throne is broad, admitting others besides him who, as chief, occupies the center. TRENCH notices; The order of the promises in the seven epistles corresponds to that of the unfolding of the kingdom of God its first beginnings on earth to its consummation in heaven. To the faithful at Ephesus: (1) The tree of life in the Paradise of God is promised (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007">Rev 2:7</a>), answering to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#009">Gen 2:9</a>. (2) Sin entered the world and death by sin; but to the faithful at Smyrna it is promised, they shall not be hurt by the second death (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#011">Rev 2:11</a>). (3) The promise of the hidden manna (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017">Rev 2:17</a>) to Pergamos brings us to the Mosaic period, the Church in the wilderness. (4) That to Thyatira, namely, triumph over the nations (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026">Rev 2:26-27</a>), forms the consummation of the kingdom in prophetic type, the period of David and Solomon characterized by this power of the nations. Here there is a division, the seven falling into two groups, four and three, as often, for example, the Lord's Prayer, three and four. The scenery of the last three passes from earth to heaven, the Church contemplated as triumphant, with its steps from glory to glory. (5) Christ promises to the believer of Sardis not to blot his name out of the book of life but to confess him before His Father and the angels at the judgment-day, and clothe him with a glorified body of dazzling whiteness (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#004">Rev 3:4-5</a>). (6) To the faithful at Philadelphia Christ promises they shall be citizens of the new Jerusalem, fixed as immovable pillars there, where city and temple are one (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012">Rev 3:12</a>); here not only individual salvation is promised to the believer, as in the case of Sardis, but also privileges in the blessed communion of the Church triumphant. (7) Lastly, to the faithful of Laodicea is given the crowning promise, not only the two former blessings, but a seat with Christ on His throne, even as He has sat with His Father on His Father's throne (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021">Rev 3:21</a>).
