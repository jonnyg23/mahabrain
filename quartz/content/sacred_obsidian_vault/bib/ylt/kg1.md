 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And king David [is] old, entering into days, and they cover  him with garments, and he hath no heat,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> and his servants say to him, `Let them seek for my lord the  king a young woman, a virgin, and she hath stood before the  king, and is to him a companion, and hath lain in thy bosom,  and my lord the king hath heat.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And they seek a fair young woman in all the border of  Israel, and find Abishag the Shunammite, and bring her in to  the king,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> and the young woman [is] very very fair, and she is to the  king a companion, and serveth him, and the king hath not known  her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And Adonijah son of Haggith is lifting himself up, saying,  `I do reign;' and he prepareth for himself a chariot and  horsemen, and fifty men running before him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> and his father hath not grieved him [all] his days, saying,  `Wherefore thus hast thou done?' and he also [is] of a very  good form, and [his mother] bare him after Absalom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> And his words are with Joab son of Zeruiah, and with  Abiathar the priest, and they help after Adonijah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and  Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty ones  whom David hath, have not been with Adonijah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And Adonijah sacrificeth sheep and oxen and fatlings near  the stone of Zoheleth, that [is] by En-Rogel, and calleth all  his brethren, sons of the king, and for all the men of Judah,  servants of the king;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty ones,  and Solomon his brother, he hath not called.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And Nathan speaketh unto Bath-Sheba, mother of Solomon,  saying, `Hast thou not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith hath  reigned, and our lord David hath not known?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> and now, come, let me counsel thee, I pray thee, and  deliver thy life, and the life of thy son Solomon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> go and enter in unto king David, and thou hast said unto  him, Hast thou not, my lord, O king, sworn to thy handmaid,  saying, Surely Solomon thy son doth reign after me, and he doth  sit on my throne? and wherefore hath Adonijah reigned?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> Lo, thou are yet speaking there with the king, and I come  in after thee, and have completed thy words.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And Bath-Sheba cometh in unto the king, to the inner  chamber, and the king [is] very aged, and Abishag the  Shunammite is serving the king:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> and Bath-Sheba boweth and doth obeisance to the king, and  the king saith, `What -- to thee?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And she saith to him, `My lord, thou hast sworn by Jehovah  thy God to thy handmaid: Surely Solomon thy son doth reign  after me, and he doth sit on my throne;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> and now, lo, Adonijah hath reigned, and now, my lord, O  king, thou hast not known;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> and he sacrificeth ox, and fatling, and sheep in abundance,  and calleth for all the sons of the king, and for Abiathar the  priest, and for Joab head of the host -- and for Solomon thy  servant he hath not called.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel [are] on  thee, to declare to them who doth sit on the throne of my lord  the king after him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> and it hath been, when my lord the king lieth with his  fathers, that I have been, I and my son Solomon -- [reckoned]  sinners.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> And lo, she is yet speaking with the king, and Nathan the  prophet hath come in;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> and they declare to the king, saying, `Lo, Nathan the  prophet;' and he cometh in before the king, and boweth himself  to the king, on his face to the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> And Nathan saith, `My lord, O king, thou hast said,  Adonijah doth reign after me, and he doth sit on my throne;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> for he hath gone down to-day, and doth sacrifice ox, and  fatling, and sheep, in abundance, and calleth for all the sons  of the king, and for the heads of the host, and for Abiathar  the priest, and lo, they are eating and drinking before him,  and they say, Let king Adonijah live!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> `And for me -- me, thy servant, and for Zadok the priest,  and for Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, and for Solomon thy servant,  he hath not called;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> if from my lord the king this thing hath been, then thou  hast not caused thy servant to know who doth sit on the throne  of my lord the king after him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> And king David answereth and saith, `Call for me for  Bath-Sheba;' and she cometh in before the king, and standeth  before the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> And the king sweareth and saith, `Jehovah liveth, who hath  redeemed my soul out of all adversity;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> surely as I sware to thee by Jehovah, God of Israel,  saying, Surely Solomon thy son doth reign after me, and he doth  sit on my throne in my stead; surely so I do this day.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:31">1:31</a> And Bath-Sheba boweth -- face to the earth -- and doth  obeisance to the king, and saith, `Let my lord, king David,  live to the age.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:32">1:32</a> And king David saith, `Call for me for Zadok the priest,  and for Nathan the prophet, and for Benaiah son of Jehoiada;'  and they come in before the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:33">1:33</a> And the king saith to them, `Take with you the servants of  your lord, and ye have caused Solomon my son to ride on mine  own mule, and caused him to go down unto Gihon,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:34">1:34</a> and anointed him there hath Zadok the priest -- and Nathan  the prophet -- for king over Israel, and ye have blown with a  trumpet, and said, Let king Solomon live;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:35">1:35</a> and ye have come up after him, and he hath come in and hath  sat on my throne, and he doth reign in my stead, and him I have  appointed to be leader over Israel, and over Judah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:36">1:36</a> And Benaiah son of Jehoiada answereth the king, and saith,  `Amen! so doth Jehovah, God of my lord the king, say;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:37">1:37</a> as Jehovah hath been with my lord the king, so is He with  Solomon, and doth make his throne greater than the throne of my  lord king David.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:38">1:38</a> And Zadok the priest goeth down, and Nathan the prophet,  and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethite, and the  Pelethite, and they cause Solomon to ride on the mule of king  David, and cause him to go unto Gihon,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:39">1:39</a> and Zadok the priest taketh the horn of oil out of the  tent, and anointeth Solomon, and they blow with a trumpet, and  all the people say, `Let king Solomon live.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:40">1:40</a> And all the people come up after him, and the people are  piping with pipes, and rejoicing -- great joy, and the earth  rendeth with their voice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:41">1:41</a> And Adonijah heareth, and all those called, who [are] with  him, and they have finished to eat, and Joab heareth the noise  of the trumpet, and saith, `Wherefore [is] the noise of the  city roaring?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:42">1:42</a> He is yet speaking, and lo, Jonathan son of Abiathar the  priest hath come in, and Adonijah saith, `Come in, for a man of  valour thou [art], and thou bearest good tidings.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:43">1:43</a> And Jonathan answereth and saith to Adonijah, `Verily our  lord king David hath caused Solomon to reign,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:44">1:44</a> and the king sendeth with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan  the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethite,  and the Pelethite, and they cause him to ride on the king's  mule,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:45">1:45</a> and they anoint him -- Zadok the priest and Nathan the  prophet -- for king in Gihon, and are come up thence rejoicing,  and the city is moved; it [is] the noise that ye have heard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:46">1:46</a> `And also Solomon hath sat on the throne of the kingdom,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:47">1:47</a> and also the servants of the king have come into bless our  lord king David, saying, Thy God doth make the name of Solomon  better than thy name, and his throne greater than thy throne;  and the king boweth himself on the bed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:48">1:48</a> and also thus hath the king said, Blessed [is] Jehovah, God  of Israel, who hath given to-day [one] sitting on my throne,  and mine eyes seeing.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:49">1:49</a> And they tremble, and rise -- all those called who [are]  for Adonijah -- and go, each on his way;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:50">1:50</a> and Adonijah feareth because of Solomon, and riseth, and  goeth, and layeth hold on the horns of the altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:51">1:51</a> And it is declared to Solomon, saying, `Lo, Adonijah  feareth king Solomon, and lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of  the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me as to-day -- he  doth not put to death his servant by the sword.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:52">1:52</a> And Solomon saith, `If he becometh a virtuous man -- there  doth not fall of his hair to the earth, and if evil is found in  him -- then he hath died.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:53">1:53</a> And king Solomon sendeth, and they bring him down from off  the altar, and he cometh in and boweth himself to king Solomon,  and Solomon saith to him, `Go to thy house.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And draw near do the days of David to die, and he chargeth  Solomon his son, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> `I am going in the way of all the earth, and thou hast been  strong, and become a man,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> and kept the charge of Jehovah thy God, to walk in His ways,  to keep His statutes, His commands, and His judgments, and His  testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, so that thou  dost wisely all that thou dost, and whithersoever thou turnest,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> so that Jehovah doth establish His word which He spake unto  me, saying, If thy sons observe their way to walk before Me in  truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul; saying,  There is not cut off a man of thine from the throne of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> `And also, thou hast known that which he did to me -- Joab  son of Zeruiah -- that which he did to two heads of the hosts  of Israel, to Abner son of Ner, and to Amasa son of Jether --  that he slayeth them, and maketh the blood of war in peace, and  putteth the blood of war in his girdle, that [is] on his loins,  and in his sandals that [are] on his feet;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> and thou hast done according to thy wisdom, and dost not let  his old age go down in peace to Sheol.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> `And to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite thou dost do  kindness, and they have been among those eating at thy table,  for so they drew near unto me in my fleeing from the face of  Absalom thy brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> `And lo, with thee [is] Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite of  Bahurim, and he reviled me -- a grievous reviling -- in the day  of my going to Mahanaim; and he hath come down to meet me at  the Jordan, and I swear to him by Jehovah, saying, I do not put  thee to death by the sword;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> and now, acquit him not, for a wise man thou [art], and thou  hast known that which thou dost to him, and hast brought down  his old age with blood to Sheol.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> And David lieth down with his fathers, and is buried in the  city of David,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> and the days that David hath reigned over Israel [are]  forty years, in Hebron he hath reigned seven years, and in  Jerusalem he hath reigned thirty and three years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And Solomon hath sat on the throne of David his father, and  his kingdom is established greatly,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> and Adonijah son of Haggith cometh in unto Bath-Sheba,  mother of Solomon, and she saith, `Is thy coming peace?' and he  saith, `Peace.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And he saith, `I have a word unto thee,' and she saith,  `Speak.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And he saith, `Thou hast known that the kingdom was mine,  and towards me set their faces had all Israel for reigning, and  the kingdom is turned round about, and is my brother's, for  from Jehovah it was his;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> and now, one petition I am asking of thee -- turn not back  my face;' and she saith unto him, `Speak.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And he saith, `Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king, for  he doth not turn back thy face, and he doth give to me Abishag  the Shunammite for a wife.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And Bath-Sheba saith, `Good; I do speak for thee unto the  king.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And Bath-Sheba cometh in unto king Solomon to speak to him  for Adonijah, and the king riseth to meet her, and boweth  himself to her, and sitteth on his throne, and placeth a throne  for the mother of the king, and she sitteth at his right hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> And she saith, `One small petition I ask of thee, turn not  back my face;' and the king saith to her, `Ask, my mother, for  I do not turn back thy face.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And she saith, `Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to  Adonijah thy brother for a wife.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> And king Solomon answereth and saith to his mother, `And  why art thou asking Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? also  ask for him the kingdom -- for he [is] mine elder brother --  even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab son of  Zeruiah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> And king Solomon sweareth by Jehovah, saying, `Thus doth  God to me, and thus He doth add -- surely against his soul hath  Adonijah spoken this word;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> and now, Jehovah liveth, who hath established me, and  causeth me to sit on the throne of David my father, and who  hath made for me an house as He spake -- surely to-day is  Adonijah put to death.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> And king Solomon sendeth by the hand of Benaiah son of  Jehoiada, and he falleth upon him, and he dieth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> And to Abiathar the priest said the king, `To Anathoth go,  unto thy fields; for a man of death thou [art], but in this day  I do not put thee to death, because thou hast borne the ark of  the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou wast  afflicted in all that my father was afflicted in.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> And Solomon casteth out Abiathar from being priest to  Jehovah, to fulfil the word of Jehovah which He spake  concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> And the report hath come unto Joab -- for Joab hath turned  aside after Adonijah, though after Absalom he did not turn  aside -- and Joab fleeth unto the tent of Jehovah, and layeth  hold on the horns of the altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> And it is declared to king Solomon that Joab hath fled unto  the tent of Jehovah, and lo, near the altar; and Solomon  sendeth Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, `Go, fall upon him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:30">2:30</a> And Benaiah cometh in unto the tent of Jehovah, and saith  unto him, `Thus said the king, Come out;' and he saith, `Nay,  but here I die.' And Benaiah bringeth back the king word,  saying, `Thus spake Joab, yea, thus he answered me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:31">2:31</a> And the king saith to him, `Do as he hath spoken, and fall  upon him, and thou hast buried him, and turned aside the  causeless blood which Joab shed, from off me, and from off the  house of my father;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:32">2:32</a> and Jehovah hath turned back his blood on his own head, who  hath fallen on two men more righteous and better than he, and  slayeth them with the sword, -- and my father David knew not --  Abner son of Ner, head of the host of Israel, and Amasa son of  Jether, head of the host of Judah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:33">2:33</a> yea, turned back hath their blood on the head of Joab, and  on the head of his seed to the age; and for David, and for his  seed, and for his house, and for his throne, there is peace  unto the age, from Jehovah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:34">2:34</a> And Benaiah son of Jehoiada goeth up and falleth upon him,  and putteth him to death, and he is buried in his own house in  the wilderness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:35">2:35</a> and the king putteth Benaiah son of Jehoiada in his stead  over the host, and Zadok the priest hath the king put in the  stead of Abiathar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:36">2:36</a> And the king sendeth and calleth for Shimei, and saith to  him, `Build for thee a house in Jerusalem, and thou hast dwelt  there, and dost not go out thence any where;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:37">2:37</a> and it hath been, in the day of thy going out, and thou  hast passed over the brook Kidron, thou dost certainly know  that thou dost surely die -- thy blood is on thy head.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:38">2:38</a> And Shimei saith to the king, `The word [is] good; as my  lord the king hath spoken so doth thy servant do;' and Shimei  dwelleth in Jerusalem many days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:39">2:39</a> And it cometh to pass, at the end of three years, that flee  do two of the servants of Shimei unto Achish son of Maachah,  king of Gath, and they declare to Shimei, saying, `Lo, thy  servants [are] in Gath;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:40">2:40</a> and Shimei riseth, and saddleth his ass, and goeth to Gath,  unto Achish, to seek his servants, and Shimei goeth and  bringeth his servants from Gath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:41">2:41</a> And it is declared to Solomon that Shimei hath gone from  Jerusalem to Gath, and doth return,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:42">2:42</a> and the king sendeth and calleth for Shimei, and saith unto  him, `Have I not caused thee to swear by Jehovah -- and I  testify against thee, saying, In the day of thy going out, and  thou hast gone anywhere, thou dost certainly know that thou  dost surely die; and thou sayest unto me, The word I have heard  [is] good?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:43">2:43</a> and wherefore hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and  the charge that I charged upon thee?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:44">2:44</a> And the king saith unto Shimei, `Thou hast known all the  evil that thy heart hath known, which thou didest to David my  father, and Jehovah hath turned back thine evil on thy head,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:45">2:45</a> and king Solomon [is] blessed, and the throne of David is  established before Jehovah unto the age.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:46">2:46</a> And the king chargeth Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he goeth  out and falleth on him, and he dieth, and the kingdom is  established in the hand of Solomon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And Solomon joineth in marriage with Pharaoh king of Egypt,  and taketh the daughter of Pharaoh, and bringeth her in unto  the city of David, till he completeth to build his own house,  and the house of Jehovah, and the wall of Jerusalem round  about.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> Only, the people are sacrificing in high places, for there  hath not been built a house for the name of Jehovah till those  days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And Solomon loveth Jehovah, to walk in the statutes of David  his father -- only, in high places he is sacrificing and making  perfume --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> and the king goeth to Gibeon, to sacrifice there, for it  [is] the great high place; a thousand burnt-offerings cause to  ascend doth Solomon on that altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> In Gibeon hath Jehovah appeared unto Solomon, in a dream of  the night, and God saith, `Ask -- what do I give to thee?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And Solomon saith, `Thou hast done with Thy servant David my  father great kindness, as he walked before Thee in truth and in  righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with Thee, and Thou  dost keep for him this great kindness, and dost give to him a  son sitting on his throne, as [at] this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And now, O Jehovah my God, Thou hast caused thy servant to  reign instead of David my father; and I [am] a little child, I  do not know to go out and to come in;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> and Thy servant [is] in the midst of thy people, whom Thou  hast chosen, a people numerous, that is not numbered nor  counted for multitude,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> and Thou hast given to Thy servant an understanding heart,  to judge Thy people, to discern between good and evil; for who  is able to judge this Thy great people?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> And the thing is good in the eyes of the Lord, that Solomon  hath asked this thing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> and God saith unto him, `Because that thou hast asked this  thing, and hast not asked for thee many days, nor asked for  thee riches, nor asked the life of thine enemies, and hast  asked for thee discernment to understand judgment,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> lo, I have done according to thy words; lo, I have given to  thee a heart, wise and understanding, that like thee there hath  not been before thee, and after thee there doth not arise like  thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> and also, that which thou hast not asked I have given to  thee, both riches and honour, that there hath not been like  thee a man among the kings all thy days;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> and if thou dost walk in My ways to keep My statutes, and  My commands, as David thy father walked, then I have prolonged  thy days.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And Solomon awaketh, and lo, a dream; and he cometh in to  Jerusalem, and standeth before the ark of the covenant of  Jehovah, and causeth to ascend burnt-offerings, and maketh  peace-offerings. And he maketh a banquet for all his servants,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> then come in do two women, harlots, unto the king, and  stand before him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> and the one woman saith, `O, my lord, I and this woman are  dwelling in one house, and I bring forth with her, in the  house;</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> and the king hearkened not unto the people, for the  revolution was from Jehovah, in order to establish His word  that Jehovah spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite unto  Jeroboam son of Nebat.</p>

 <p><a name="an_20:22">20:22</a> And the prophet cometh nigh unto the king of Israel, and  saith to him, `Go, strengthen thyself, and know and see that  which thou dost, for at the turn of the year the king of Aram  is coming up against thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:23">20:23</a> And the servants of the king of Aram said unto him, `Gods  of hills [are] their gods, therefore they were stronger than  we; and yet, we fight with them in the plain -- are we not  stronger than they?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:24">20:24</a> `And this thing do thou: turn aside the kings each out of  his place, and set captains in their stead;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:25">20:25</a> and thou, number to thee a force as the force that is  fallen from thee, and horse for horse, and chariot for chariot,  and we fight with them in the plain; are we not stronger than  they?' and he hearkeneth to their voice, and doth so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:26">20:26</a> And it cometh to pass at the turn of the year, that  Ben-Hadad inspecteth the Aramaeans, and goeth up to Aphek, to  battle with Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:27">20:27</a> and the sons of Israel have been inspected, and supported,  and go to meet them, and the sons of Israel encamp before them,  like two flocks of goats, and the Aramaeans have filled the  land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:28">20:28</a> And there cometh nigh a man of God, and speaketh unto the  king of Israel, and saith, `Thus said Jehovah, Because that the  Aramaeans have said, God of hills [is] Jehovah, and He [is] not  God of valleys -- I have given the whole of this great  multitude into thy hand, and ye have known that I [am]  Jehovah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:29">20:29</a> And they encamp one over-against another seven days, and  it cometh to pass on the seventh day, that the battle draweth  near, and the sons of Israel smite Aram -- a hundred thousand  footmen in one day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:30">20:30</a> And those left flee to Aphek, unto the city, and the wall  falleth on twenty and seven chief men who are left, and  Ben-Hadad hath fled, and cometh in unto the city, into the  innermost part.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:31">20:31</a> And his servants say unto him, `Lo, we pray thee, we have  heard that the kings of the house of Israel -- that they are  kind kings; let us put, we pray thee, sackcloth on our loins,  and ropes on our heads, and we go out unto the king of Israel;  it may be he doth keep thee alive.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:32">20:32</a> And they gird sackcloth on their loins, and ropes [are] on  their heads, and they come in unto the king of Israel, and say,  `Thy servant Ben-Hadad hath said, Let me live, I pray thee;'  and he saith, `Is he yet alive? he [is] my brother.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:33">20:33</a> And the men observe diligently, and hasten, and catch it  from him, and say, `Thy brother Ben-Hadad;' and he saith, `Go  ye in, bring him;' and Ben-Hadad cometh out unto him, and he  causeth him to come up on the chariot.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:34">20:34</a> And he saith unto him, `The cities that my father took  from thy father, I give back, and streets thou dost make for  thee in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria;' -- `and I, with  a covenant, send thee away;' and he maketh with him a covenant,  and sendeth him away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:35">20:35</a> And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto  his neighbour by the word of Jehovah, `Smite me, I pray thee;'  and the man refuseth to smite him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:36">20:36</a> and he saith to him, `Because that thou hast not hearkened  to the voice of Jehovah, lo, thou art going from me, and the  lion hath smitten thee;' and he goeth from him, and the lion  findeth him, and smiteth him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:37">20:37</a> And he findeth another man, and saith, `Smite me, I pray  thee;' and the man smiteth him, smiting and wounding,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:38">20:38</a> and the prophet goeth and standeth for the king on the  way, and disguiseth himself with ashes on his eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:39">20:39</a> And it cometh to pass -- the king is passing by -- that he  hath cried unto the king, and saith, `Thy servant went out into  the midst of the battle, and lo, a man hath turned aside and  bringeth in unto me a man, and saith, Keep this man; if he be  at all missing, then hath thy life been for his life, or a  talent of silver thou dost weigh out;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:40">20:40</a> and it cometh to pass, thy servant is working hither and  thither, and he is not!' and the king of Israel saith unto him,  Right [is] thy judgment; thou hast determined [it].'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:41">20:41</a> And he hasteth and turneth aside the ashes from off his  eyes, and the king of Israel discerneth him, that he [is] of  the prophets,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:42">20:42</a> and he saith unto him, `Thus said Jehovah, Because thou  hast sent away the man I devoted, out of [thy] hand, even thy  life hath been for his life, and thy people for his people;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:43">20:43</a> and the king of Israel goeth unto his house, sulky and  wroth, and cometh in to Samaria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> And it cometh to pass, after these things, a vineyard hath  been to Naboth the Jezreelite, that [is] in Jezreel, near the  palace of Ahab king of Samaria,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> and Ahab speaketh unto Naboth, saying, `Give to me thy  vineyard, and it is to me for a garden of green herbs, for it  [is] near by my house, and I give to thee in its stead a better  vineyard than it; if good in thine eyes, I give to thee silver  -- its price.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> And Naboth saith unto Ahab, `Far be it from me, by Jehovah,  my giving the inheritance of my fathers to thee;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> and Ahab cometh in unto his house, sulky and wroth, because  of the word that Naboth the Jezreelite hath spoken unto him  when he saith, `I do not give to thee the inheritance of my  fathers,' and he lieth down on his bed, and turneth round his  face, and hath not eaten bread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> And Jezebel his wife cometh in unto him, and speaketh unto  him, `What [is] this? -- thy spirit sulky, and thou art not  eating bread!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> And he saith unto her, `Because I speak unto Naboth the  Jezreelite, and say to him, Give to me thy vineyard for money,  or if thou desire, I give to thee a vineyard in its stead; and  he saith, I do not give to thee my vineyard.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> And Jezebel his wife saith unto him, `Thou now dost execute  rule over Israel! rise, eat bread, and let thy heart be glad,  -- I do give to thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> And she writeth letters in the name of Ahab, and sealeth  with his seal, and sendeth the letters unto the elders, and  unto the freemen, who are in his city, those dwelling with  Naboth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> and she writeth in the letters, saying, `Proclaim a fast,  and cause Naboth to sit at the head of the people,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> and cause two men -- sons of worthlessness -- to sit  over-against him, and they testify of him, saying, Thou hast  blessed God and Melech; and they have brought him out, and  stoned him, and he dieth.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> And the men of his city, the elders and the freemen who  are dwelling in his city, do as Jezebel hath sent unto them, as  written in the letters that she sent unto them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> they have proclaimed a fast, and caused Naboth to sit at  the head of the people,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> and two men -- sons of worthlessness -- come in, and sit  over-against him, and the men of worthlessness testify of him,  even Naboth, before the people, saying, `Naboth blessed God and  Melech;' and they take him out to the outside of the city, and  stone him with stones, and he dieth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> and they send unto Jezebel, saying, `Naboth was stoned,  and is dead.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> And it cometh to pass, at Jezebel's hearing that Naboth  hath been stoned, and is dead, that Jezebel saith unto Ahab,  `Rise, possess the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, that he  refused to give to thee for money, for Naboth is not alive but  dead.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> And it cometh to pass, at Ahab's hearing that Naboth is  dead, that Ahab riseth to go down unto the vineyard of Naboth  the Jezreelite, to possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> And the word of Jehovah is unto Elijah the Tishbite,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> `Rise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who [is] in  Samaria, -- lo, in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he hath gone  down to possess it,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> and thou hast spoken unto him, saying, Thus said Jehovah,  Hast thou murdered, and also possessed? and thou hast spoken  unto him, saying, Thus said Jehovah, In the place where the  dogs licked the blood of Naboth, do the dogs lick thy blood,  even thine.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> And Ahab saith unto Elijah, `Hast thou found me, O mine  enemy?' and he saith, `I have found -- because of thy selling  thyself to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:21">21:21</a> lo, I am bringing in unto thee evil, and have taken away  thy posterity, and cut off to Ahab those sitting on the wall,  and restrained, and left, in Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:22">21:22</a> and given up thy house like the house of Jeroboam son of  Nebat, and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah, for the  provocation with which thou hast provoked [Me], and dost cause  Israel to sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:23">21:23</a> `And also of Jezebel hath Jehovah spoken, saying, The dogs  do eat Jezebel in the bulwark of Jezreel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:24">21:24</a> him who dieth of Ahab in a city do the dogs eat, and him  who dieth in a field do fowl of the heavens eat;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:25">21:25</a> surely there hath none been like Ahab, who sold himself to  do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, whom Jezebel his wife  hath moved,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:26">21:26</a> and he doth very abominably to go after the idols,  according to all that the Amorite did whom Jehovah dispossessed  from the presence of the sons of Israel.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:27">21:27</a> And it cometh to pass, at Ahab's hearing these words, that  he rendeth his garments, and putteth sackcloth on his flesh,  and fasteth, and lieth in sackcloth, and goeth gently.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:28">21:28</a> And the word of Jehovah is unto Elijah the Tishbite,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:29">21:29</a> `Hast thou seen that Ahab hath been humbled before Me?  because that he hath been humbled before Me, I bring not in the  evil in his days; in the days of his son I bring in the evil on  his house.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> And they sit still three years, there is no war between  Aram and Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> and it cometh to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat  king of Judah cometh down unto the king of Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> and the king of Israel saith unto his servants, `Have ye  not known that ours [is] Ramoth-Gilead? and we are keeping  silent from taking it out of the hand of the king of Aram!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> And he saith unto Jehoshaphat, `Dost thou go with me to  battle [to] Ramoth-Gilead?' and Jehoshaphat saith unto the king  of Israel, `As I am, so thou; as my people, so thy people; as  my horses, so thy horses.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> And Jehoshaphat saith unto the king of Israel, `Seek, I  pray thee, to-day, the word of Jehovah;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> and the king of Israel gathereth the prophets, about four  hundred men, and saith unto them, `Do I go against  Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or do I forbear?' and they say, `Go  up, and the Lord doth give [it] into the hand of the king.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> And Jehoshaphat saith, `Is there not here a prophet of  Jehovah besides, and we seek by him?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> And the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat, `Yet -- one  man to seek Jehovah by him, and I have hated him, for he doth  not prophesy concerning me good, but evil -- Micaiah son of  Imlah;' and Jehoshaphat saith, `Let not the king say so.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> And the king of Israel calleth unto a certain eunuch, and  saith, `Hasten Micaiah son of Imlah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah are  sitting, each on his throne, clothed with garments, in a  threshing-floor, at the opening of the gate of Samaria, and all  the prophets are prophesying before them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah maketh for himself horns of  iron, and saith, `Thus said Jehovah, By these thou dost push  the Aramaeans till they are consumed;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> and all the prophets are prophesying so, saying, `Go up to  Ramoth-Gilead, and prosper, and Jehovah hath given [it] into  the hand of the king.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> And the messenger who hath gone to call Micaiah hath  spoken unto him, saying, `Lo, I pray thee, the words of the  prophets, with one mouth, [are] good towards the king; let it  be, I pray thee, thy word as the word of one of them -- and  thou hast spoken good.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> And Micaiah saith, `Jehovah liveth; surely that which  Jehovah saith unto me -- it I speak.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> And he cometh in unto the king, and the king saith unto  him, `Micaiah, do we go unto Ramoth-Gilead, to battle, or do we  forbear?' and he saith unto him, `Go up, and prosper, and  Jehovah hath given [it] into the hand of the king.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> And the king saith unto him, `How many times am I adjuring  thee that thou speak nothing unto me but truth in the name of  Jehovah?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> And he saith, `I have seen all Israel scattered on the  hills as sheep that have no shepherd, and Jehovah saith, These  have no master; they turn back each to his house in peace.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> And the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat, `Have I not  said unto thee, He doth not prophesy of me good, but evil?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> And he saith, `Therefore, hear a word of Jehovah; I have  seen Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all the host of the  heavens standing by Him, on His right and on His left;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> and Jehovah saith, Who doth entice Ahab, and he doth go up  and fall in Ramoth-Gilead? and this one saith thus, and that  one is saying thus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:21">22:21</a> `And the spirit goeth out, and standeth before Jehovah,  and saith, I -- I do entice him; and Jehovah saith unto him, By  what?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> and he saith, I go out, and have been a spirit of  falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets; and He saith, Thou  dost entice, and also thou art able; go out and do so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:23">22:23</a> And now, lo, Jehovah hath put a spirit of falsehood in the  mouth of all these thy prophets, and Jehovah hath spoken  concerning thee -- evil.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:24">22:24</a> And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah draweth nigh, and smiteth  Micaiah on the cheek, and saith, `Where [is] this -- he hath  passed over -- the Spirit of Jehovah -- from me to speak with  thee?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:25">22:25</a> And Micaiah saith, `Lo, thou art seeing on that day, when  thou goest in to the innermost chamber to be hidden.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:26">22:26</a> And the king of Israel saith, `Take Micaiah, and turn him  back unto Amon head of the city, and unto Joash son of the  king,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:27">22:27</a> and thou hast said, Thus said the king, Place ye this one  in the house of restraint, and cause him to eat bread of  oppression, and water of oppression, till my coming in peace.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:28">22:28</a> And Micaiah saith, `If thou at all return in peace --  Jehovah hath not spoken by me;' and he saith, `Hear, O peoples,  all of them.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:29">22:29</a> And the king of Israel goeth up, and Jehoshaphat king of  Judah, to Ramoth-Gilead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:30">22:30</a> And the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat to disguise  himself, and to go into battle, `And thou, put on thy  garments.' And the king of Israel disguiseth himself, and goeth  into battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:31">22:31</a> And the king of Aram commanded the heads of the  charioteers whom he hath -- thirty and two -- saying, `Ye do  not fight with small or with great, but with the king of Israel  by himself.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:32">22:32</a> And it cometh to pass, at the heads of the charioteers  seeing Jehoshaphat, that they said, `He [is] only the king of  Israel;' and they turn aside to him to fight, and Jehoshaphat  crieth out,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:33">22:33</a> and it cometh to pass, at the heads of the charioteers  seeing that he [is] not the king of Israel, that they turn back  from after him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:34">22:34</a> And a man hath drawn with a bow, in his simplicity, and  smiteth the king of Israel between the joinings and the coat of  mail, and he saith to his charioteer, `Turn thy hand, and take  me out from the camp, for I have become sick.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:35">22:35</a> And the battle increaseth on that day, and the king hath  been caused to stand in the chariot, over-against Aram, and he  dieth in the evening, and the blood of the wound runneth out  unto the midst of the chariot,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:36">22:36</a> and he causeth the cry to pass over through the camp, at  the going in of the sun, saying, `Each unto his city, and each  unto his land.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:37">22:37</a> And the king dieth, and cometh into Samaria, and they bury  the king in Samaria;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:38">22:38</a> and [one] rinseth the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and  the dogs lick his blood -- when the armour they had washed --  according to the word of Jehovah that He spake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:39">22:39</a> And the rest of the matters of Ahab, and all that he did,  and the house of ivory that he built, and all the cities that  he built, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of  the kings of Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:40">22:40</a> And Ahab lieth with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son  reigneth in his stead.</p>

 <p><a name="an_22:44">22:44</a> And Jehoshaphat maketh peace with the king of Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:45">22:45</a> and the rest of the matters of Jehoshaphat, and his might  that he got, and with which he fought, are they not written on  the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
