  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: Colossians</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God,  and Timotheus the brother,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> to the saints in Colossae, and to the faithful brethren in  Christ: Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the  Lord Jesus Christ!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus  Christ, always praying for you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love  that [is] to all the saints,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> because of the hope that is laid up for you in the heavens,  which ye heard of before in the word of the truth of the good  news,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> which is present to you, as also in all the world, and is  bearing fruit, as also in you, from the day in which ye heard,  and knew the grace of God in truth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> as ye also learned from Epaphras, our beloved  fellow-servant, who is for you a faithful ministrant of the  Christ,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> who also did declare to us your love in the Spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Because of this, we also, from the day in which we heard, do  not cease praying for you, and asking that ye may be filled  with the full knowledge of His will in all wisdom and  spiritual understanding,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> to your walking worthily of the Lord to all pleasing, in  every good work being fruitful, and increasing to the  knowledge of God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> in all might being made mighty according to the power of  His glory, to all endurance and long-suffering with joy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Giving thanks to the Father who did make us meet for the  participation of the inheritance of the saints in the light,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> who did rescue us out of the authority of the darkness, and  did translate [us] into the reign of the Son of His love,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> in whom we have the redemption through his blood, the  forgiveness of the sins,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> who is the image of the invisible God, first-born of all  creation,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> because in him were the all things created, those in the  heavens, and those upon the earth, those visible, and those  invisible, whether thrones, whether lordships, whether  principalities, whether authorities; all things through him,  and for him, have been created,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> and himself is before all, and the all things in him have  consisted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And himself is the head of the body -- the assembly -- who  is a beginning, a first-born out of the dead, that he might  become in all [things] -- himself -- first,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> because in him it did please all the fulness to tabernacle,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> and through him to reconcile the all things to himself --  having made peace through the blood of his cross -- through  him, whether the things upon the earth, whether the things in  the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> And you -- once being alienated, and enemies in the mind,  in the evil works, yet now did he reconcile,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> in the body of his flesh through the death, to present you  holy, and unblemished, and unblameable before himself,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> if also ye remain in the faith, being founded and settled,  and not moved away from the hope of the good news, which ye  heard, which was preached in all the creation that [is] under  the heaven, of which I became -- I Paul -- a ministrant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and do fill up the  things lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh  for his body, which is the assembly,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> of which I -- I did become a ministrant according to the  dispensation of God, that was given to me for you, to fulfil  the word of God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> the secret that hath been hid from the ages and from the  generations, but now was manifested to his saints,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> to whom God did will to make known what [is] the riches of  the glory of this secret among the nations -- which is Christ  in you, the hope of the glory,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> whom we proclaim, warning every man, and teaching every  man, in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in  Christ Jesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> for which also I labour, striving according to his working  that is working in me in power.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> For I wish you to know how great a conflict I have for you  and those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in  the flesh,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> that their hearts may be comforted, being united in love,  and to all riches of the full assurance of the understanding,  to the full knowledge of the secret of the God and Father, and  of the Christ,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> in whom are all the treasures of the wisdom and the  knowledge hid,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> and this I say, that no one may beguile you in enticing  words,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> for if even in the flesh I am absent -- yet in the spirit I  am with you, joying and beholding your order, and the  stedfastness of your faith in regard to Christ;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> as, then, ye did receive Christ Jesus the Lord, in him walk  ye,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> being rooted and built up in him, and confirmed in the  faith, as ye were taught -- abounding in it in thanksgiving.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> See that no one shall be carrying you away as spoil through  the philosophy and vain deceit, according to the deliverance  of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not  according to Christ,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> because in him doth tabernacle all the fulness of the  Godhead bodily,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> and ye are in him made full, who is the head of all  principality and authority,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> in whom also ye were circumcised with a circumcision not  made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of  the flesh in the circumcision of the Christ,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> being buried with him in the baptism, in which also ye rose  with [him] through the faith of the working of God, who did  raise him out of the dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And you -- being dead in the trespasses and the  uncircumcision of your flesh -- He made alive together with  him, having forgiven you all the trespasses,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> having blotted out the handwriting in the ordinances that  is against us, that was contrary to us, and he hath taken it  out of the way, having nailed it to the cross;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> having stripped the principalities and the authorities, he  made a shew of them openly -- having triumphed over them in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> Let no one, then, judge you in eating or in drinking, or in  respect of a feast, or of a new moon, or of sabbaths,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> which are a shadow of the coming things, and the body [is]  of the Christ;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> let no one beguile you of your prize, delighting in  humble-mindedness and [in] worship of the messengers, intruding  into the things he hath not seen, being vainly puffed up by the  mind of his flesh,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> and not holding the head, from which all the body --  through the joints and bands gathering supply, and being knit  together -- may increase with the increase of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> If, then, ye did die with the Christ from the rudiments of  the world, why, as living in the world, are ye subject to  ordinances?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> -- thou mayest not touch, nor taste, nor handle --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> which are all for destruction with the using, after the  commands and teachings of men,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> which are, indeed, having a matter of wisdom in  will-worship, and humble-mindedness, and neglecting of body --  not in any honour, unto a satisfying of the flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> If, then, ye were raised with the Christ, the things above  seek ye, where the Christ is, on the right hand of God seated,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> the things above mind ye, not the things upon the earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> for ye did die, and your life hath been hid with the Christ  in God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> when the Christ -- our life -- may be manifested, then also  we with him shall be manifested in glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> Put to death, then, your members that [are] upon the earth  -- whoredom, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and the  covetousness, which is idolatry --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> because of which things cometh the anger of God upon the  sons of the disobedience,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> in which also ye -- ye did walk once, when ye lived in them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> but now put off, even ye, the whole -- anger, wrath, malice,  evil-speaking, filthy talking -- out of your mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Lie not one to another, having put off the old man with his  practices,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> and having put on the new, which is renewed in regard to  knowledge, after the image of Him who did create him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> where there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and  uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, servant, freeman -- but  the all and in all -- Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Put on, therefore, as choice ones of God, holy and beloved,  bowels of mercies, kindness, humble-mindedness, meekness,  long-suffering,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any  one with any one may have a quarrel, as also the Christ did  forgive you -- so also ye;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> and above all these things, [have] love, which is a bond of  the perfection,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> and let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also  ye were called in one body, and become thankful.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom,  teaching and admonishing each other, in psalms, and hymns, and  spiritual songs, in grace singing in your hearts to the Lord;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> and all, whatever ye may do in word or in work, [do] all  things in the name of the Lord Jesus -- giving thanks to the  God and Father, through him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> The wives! be subject to your own husbands, as is fit in  the Lord;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> the husbands! love your wives, and be not bitter with them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> the children! obey the parents in all things, for this is  well-pleasing to the Lord;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> the fathers! vex not your children, lest they be  discouraged.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> The servants! obey in all things those who are masters  according to the flesh, not in eye-service as men-pleasers, but  in simplicity of heart, fearing God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> and all, whatever ye may do -- out of soul work -- as to  the Lord, and not to men,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> having known that from the Lord ye shall receive the  recompense of the inheritance -- for the Lord Christ ye serve;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> and he who is doing unrighteously shall receive what he did  unrighteously, and there is no acceptance of persons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> The masters! that which is righteous and equal to the  servants give ye, having known that ye also have a Master in  the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> In the prayer continue ye, watching in it in thanksgiving;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> praying at the same time also for us, that God may open to  us a door for the word, to speak the secret of the Christ,  because of which also I have been bound,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> that I may manifest it, as it behoveth me to speak;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> in wisdom walk ye toward those without, the time  forestalling;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> your word always in grace -- with salt being seasoned -- to  know how it behoveth you to answer each one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> All the things concerning me make known to you shall  Tychicus -- the beloved brother, and faithful ministrant, and  fellow-servant in the Lord --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> whom I did send unto you for this very thing, that he might  know the things concerning you, and might comfort your hearts,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> with Onesimus the faithful and beloved brother, who is of  you; all things to you shall they make known that [are] here.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> Salute you doth Aristarchus, my fellow-captive, and Marcus,  the nephew of Barnabas, (concerning whom ye did receive  commands -- if he may come unto you receive him,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of the  circumcision: these only [are] fellow-workers for the reign of  God who did become a comfort to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> Salute you doth Epaphras, who [is] of you, a servant of  Christ, always striving for you in the prayers, that ye may  stand perfect and made full in all the will of God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> for I do testify to him, that he hath much zeal for you,  and those in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> Salute you doth Lukas, the beloved physician, and Demas;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> salute ye those in Laodicea -- brethren, and Nymphas, and  the assembly in his house;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> and when the epistle may be read with you, cause that also  in the assembly of the Laodiceans it may be read, and the  [epistle] from Laodicea that ye also may read;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> and say to Archippus, `See to the ministration that thou  didst receive in the Lord, that thou mayest fulfil it.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> The salutation by the hand of me, Paul; remember my bonds;  the grace [is] with you. Amen. </p>
