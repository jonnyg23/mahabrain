 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> And David taketh the shields of gold that have been on the  servants of Hadarezer, and bringeth them in to Jerusalem;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> and from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, hath  David taken very much brass; with it hath Solomon made the  brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And Tou king of Hamath heareth that David hath smitten the  whole force of Hadarezer king of Zobah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> and he sendeth Hadoram his son unto king David, to ask of  him of peace, and to bless him (because that he hath fought  against Hadarezer, and smiteth him, for a man of wars with Tou  had Hadarezer been,) and all kinds of vessels, of gold, and  silver, and brass;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> also them hath king David sanctified to Jehovah with the  silver and the gold that he hath taken from all the nations,  from Edom, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, and from  the Philistines, and from Amalek.</p>

 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> and the heads of the sons of Ammon say to Hanun, `Is David  honouring thy father, in thine eyes, because he hath sent to  thee comforters? in order to search, and to overthrow, and to  spy out, the land, have not his servants come in unto thee?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> And Hanun taketh the servants of David, and shaveth them,  and cutteth their long robes in the midst, unto the buttocks,  and sendeth them away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> And [some] go, and declare to David concerning the men, and  he sendeth to meet them -- for the men have been greatly  ashamed -- and the king saith, `Dwell in Jericho till that your  beard is grown, then ye have returned.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> And the sons of Ammon see that they have made themselves  abhorred by David, and Hanun and the sons of Ammon send a  thousand talents of silver, to hire to them, from Aram-Naharaim,  and from Aram-Maachah, and from Zobah, chariots and horsemen;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> and they hire to them two and thirty thousand chariots, and  the king of Maachah and his people, and they come in and encamp  before Medeba, and the sons of Ammon have been gathered out of  their cities, and come in to the battle.</p>

 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> And Joab seeth that the front of the battle hath been unto  him, before and behind, and he chooseth out of all the choice  in Israel, and setteth in array to meet Aram,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> and the remnant of the people he hath given into the hand  of Abishai his brother, and they set in array to meet the sons  of Ammon.</p>

 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> and the sons of Ammon have seen that Aram hath fled, and  they flee -- they also -- from the face of Abishai his brother,  and go in to the city. And Joab cometh in to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:16">19:16</a> And Aram seeth that they have been smitten before Israel,  and send messengers, and bring out Aram that [is] beyond the  River, and Shophach head of the host of Hadarezer [is] before  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:17">19:17</a> And it is declared to David, and he gathereth all Israel,  and passeth over the Jordan, and cometh in unto them, and  setteth in array against them; yea, David setteth in array the  battle to meet Aram, and they fight with him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:18">19:18</a> and Aram fleeth from the face of Israel, and David slayeth  of Aram seven thousand charioteers, and forty thousand  footmen, and Shophach head of the host he hath put to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:19">19:19</a> And the servants of Hadarezer see that they have been  smitten before Israel, and they make peace with David and serve  him, and Aram hath not been willing to help the sons of Ammon  any more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> And it cometh to pass, at the time of the turn of the year  -- at the time of the going out of the messengers -- that Joab  leadeth out the force of the host, and destroyeth the land of  the sons of Ammon, and cometh in and beseigeth Rabbah -- David  is abiding in Jerusalem -- and Joab smiteth Rabbah, and  breaketh it down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> And David taketh the crown of their king from off his head,  and findeth it [in] weight a talent of gold, and in it a  precious stone, and it is on the head of David: and spoil of  the city he hath brought out very much,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> and the people who [are] in it he hath brought out, and  setteth to the saw, and to cutting instruments of iron, and to  axes; and thus doth David to all cities of the sons of Ammon,  and David turneth back, and all the people, to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> And it cometh to pass, after this, that there remaineth war  in Gezer with the Philistines, then hath Sibbechai the  Hushathite smitten Sippai, of the children of the giant, and  they are humbled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> And there is again war with the Philistines, and Elhanan  son of Jair smiteth Lahmi, brother of Goliath the Gittite, the  wood of whose spear [is] like a beam of weavers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> And there is again war in Gath, and there is a man of  measure, and his fingers and his toes [are] six and six, twenty  and four, and also, he hath been born to the giant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> And he reproacheth Israel, and smite him doth Jonathan son  of Shimea, brother of David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fall by the  hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> And there standeth up an adversary against Israel, and  persuadeth David to number Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> And David saith unto Joab, and unto the heads of the  people, `Go, number Israel from Beer-Sheba even unto Dan, and  bring unto me, and I know their number.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> And Joab saith, `Jehovah doth add to His people as they are  a hundred times; are they not, my lord, O king, all of them to  my lord for servants? why doth my lord seek this? why is he for  a cause of guilt to Israel?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> And the word of the king [is] severe against Joab, and Joab  goeth out, and goeth up and down in all Israel, and cometh in  to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> And Joab giveth the account of the numbering of the people  unto David, and all Israel is a thousand thousand and a hundred  thousand, each drawing sword, and Judah [is] four hundred and  seventy thousand, each drawing sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> And Levi and Benjamin he hath not numbered in their midst,  for the word of the king was abominable with Joab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> And it is evil in the eyes of God concerning this thing,  and He smiteth Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> and David saith unto God, `I have sinned exceedingly, in  that I have done this thing; and now, cause to pass away, I  pray Thee, the iniquity of Thy servant, for I have acted very  foolishly.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> And Jehovah speaketh unto Gad, seer of David, saying:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> `Go, and thou hast spoken unto David, saying, Thus said  Jehovah, Three -- I am stretching out unto thee; choose for  thee one of these, and I do [it] to thee.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> And David saith unto Gad, `I am greatly distressed, let me  fall, I pray thee, into the hand of Jehovah, for very many  [are] His mercies, and into the hand of man let me not fall.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> And Jehovah giveth a pestilence in Israel, and there fall  of Israel seventy thousand men,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> and God sendeth a messenger to Jerusalem to destroy it,  and as he is destroying Jehovah hath seen, and is comforted  concerning the evil, and saith to the messenger who [is]  destroying, `Enough, now, cease thy hand.' And the messenger of  Jehovah is standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the  Jebusite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> and David lifteth up his eyes, and seeth the messenger of  Jehovah standing between the earth and the heavens, and his  sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem, and  David falleth, and the elders, covered with sackcloth, on their  faces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> And David saith unto God, `Did not I -- I say to number  the people? Yea, I it [is] who have sinned, and done great  evil: and these, the flock, what did they? O Jehovah, my God,  let, I pray Thee, Thy hand be on me, and on the house of my  father, and not on Thy people -- to be plagued.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> And the messenger of Jehovah spake unto Gad, saying for  David, `Surely David doth go up to raise an altar to Jehovah in  the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> And David goeth up by the word of Gad, that he spake in  the name of Jehovah.</p>
