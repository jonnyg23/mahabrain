  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: 2 Samuel</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And it cometh to pass, after the death of Saul, that David  hath returned from smiting the Amalekite, and David dwelleth in  Ziklag two days,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> and it cometh to pass, on the third day, that lo, a man hath  come in out of the camp from Saul, and his garments [are] rent,  and earth on his head; and it cometh to pass, in his coming in  unto David, that he falleth to the earth, and doth obeisance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And David saith to him, `Whence comest thou?' and he saith  unto him, `Out of the camp of Israel I have escaped.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And David saith unto him, `What hath been the matter? declare,  I pray thee, to me.' And he saith, that `The people hath fled  from the battle, and also a multitude hath fallen of the  people, and they die; and also Saul and Jonathan his son have  died.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And David saith unto the youth who is declaring [it] to him,  `How hast thou known that Saul and Jonathan his son [are]  dead?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And the youth who is declaring [it] to him saith, I  happened to meet in mount Gilboa, and lo, Saul is leaning on  his spear; and lo, the chariots and those possessing horses  have followed him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> and he turneth behind him, and seeth me, and calleth unto  me, and I say, Here [am] I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And he saith to me, Who [art] thou? and I say unto him, An  Amalekite I [am].'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> `And he saith unto me, Stand, I pray thee, over me, and put  me to death, for seized me hath the arrow, for all my soul [is]  still in me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And I stand over him, and put him to death, for I knew that  he doth not live after his falling, and I take the crown which  [is] on his head, and the bracelet which [is] on his arm, and  bring them in unto my lord hither.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And David taketh hold on his garments, and rendeth them, and  also all the men who [are] with him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> and they mourn, and weep, and fast till the evening, for  Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah,  and for the house of Israel, because they have fallen by the  sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And David saith unto the youth who is declaring [it] to  him, `Whence [art] thou?' and he saith, `Son of a sojourner, an  Amalekite, I [am].'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And David saith unto him, `How wast thou not afraid to put  forth thy hand to destroy the anointed of Jehovah?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And David calleth to one of the youths, and saith, `Draw  nigh -- fall upon him;' and he smiteth him, and he dieth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> and David saith unto him, `Thy blood [is] on thine own  head, for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I -- I  put to death the anointed of Jehovah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And David lamenteth with this lamentation over Saul, and  over Jonathan his son;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> and he saith to teach the sons of Judah `The Bow;' lo, it  is written on the book of the Upright: --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> `The Roebuck, O Israel, On thy high places [is] wounded;  How have the mighty fallen!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> Declare [it] not in Gath, Proclaim not the tidings in the  streets of Ashkelon, Lest they rejoice -- The daughters of the  Philistines, Lest they exult -- The daughters of the  Uncircumcised!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> Mountains of Gilboa! No dew nor rain be on you, And fields  of heave-offerings! For there hath become loathsome The shield  of the mighty, The shield of Saul -- without the anointed with  oil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> From the blood of the wounded, From the fat of the mighty,  The bow of Jonathan Hath not turned backward; And the sword of  Saul doth not return empty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> Saul and Jonathan! They are loved and pleasant in their  lives, And in their death they have not been parted. Than  eagles they have been lighter, Than lions they have been  mightier!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> Daughters of Israel! for Saul weep ye, Who is clothing you  [in] scarlet with delights. Who is lifting up ornaments of gold  on your clothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> How have the mighty fallen In the midst of the battle!  Jonathan! on thy high places wounded!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> I am in distress for thee, my brother Jonathan, Very  pleasant wast thou to me; Wonderful was thy love to me, Above  the love of women!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> How have the mighty fallen, Yea, the weapons of war  perish!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And it cometh to pass afterwards, that David asketh at  Jehovah, saying, `Do I go up into one of the cities of Judah?'  and Jehovah saith unto him, `Go up.' And David saith, `Whither  do I go up?' and He saith, `To Hebron.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And David goeth up thither, and also his two wives, Ahinoam  the Jezreelitess, and Abigail wife of Nabal the Carmelite;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> and his men who [are] with him hath David brought up -- a man  and his household -- and they dwell in the cities of Hebron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And the men of Judah come, and anoint there David for king  over the house of Judah; and they declare to David, saying,  `The men of Jabesh-Gilead [are] they who buried Saul.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And David sendeth messengers unto the men of Jabesh-Gilead,  and saith unto them, `Blessed [are] ye of Jehovah, in that ye  have done this kindness with your lord, with Saul, that ye bury  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> `And, now, Jehovah doth with you kindness and truth, and  also, I do with you this good because ye have done this thing;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> and now, are your hands strong, and be ye for sons of  valour, for your lord Saul. [is] dead, and also -- me have the  house of Judah anointed for king over them.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And Abner, son of Ner, head of the host which Saul hath,  hath taken Ish-Bosheth, son of Saul, and causeth him to pass  over to Mahanaim,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> and causeth him to reign over Gilead, and over the Ashurite,  and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over  Israel -- all of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> A son of forty years, [is] Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, in his  reigning over Israel, and two years he hath reigned, only the  house of Judah have been after David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And the number of the days that David hath been king in  Hebron, over the house of Judah, is seven years and six months.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And Abner son of Ner goeth out, and servants of Ish-Bosheth  son of Saul, from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And Joab son of Zeruiah, and servants of David, have gone  out, and they meet by the pool of Gibeon together, and sit  down, these by the pool on this [side], and these by the pool on  that.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And Abner saith unto Joab, `Let the youths rise, I pray  thee, and they play before us;' and Joab saith, `Let them  rise.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And they rise and pass over, in number twelve of Benjamin,  even of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of  David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And they lay hold, each on the head of his companion, and  his sword [is] in the side of his companion, and they fall  together, and [one] calleth that place Helkath-Hazzurim, which  [is] in Gibeon,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> and the battle is very hard on that day, and Abner is  smitten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And there are there three sons of Zeruiah, Joab, and  Abishai, and Asahel, and Asahel [is] light on his feet, as one  of the roes which [are] in the field,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And Asahel pursueth after Abner, and hath not turned aside  to go to the right or to the left, from after Abner.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> And Abner looketh behind him, and saith, `Art thou  he -- Asahel?' and he saith, `I [am].'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And Abner saith to him, `Turn thee aside to thy right hand  or to thy left, and seize for thee one of the youths, and take  to thee his armour;' and Asahel hath not been willing to turn  aside from after him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> And Abner addeth again, saying unto Asahel, `Turn thee  aside from after me, why do I smite thee to the earth? and how  do I lift up my face unto Joab thy brother?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> And he refuseth to turn aside, and Abner smiteth him with  the hinder part of the spear unto the fifth [rib], and the  spear cometh out from behind him, and he falleth there, and  dieth under it; and it cometh to pass, every one who hath come  unto the place where Asahel hath fallen and dieth -- they stand  still.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> And Joab and Abishai pursue after Abner, and the sun hath  gone in, and they have come in unto the height of Ammah, which  [is] on the front of Giah, the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> And the sons of Benjamin gather themselves together after  Abner, and become one troop, and stand on the top of a certain  height,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> and Abner calleth unto Joab, and saith, `For ever doth the  sword consume? hast thou not known that it is bitterness in the  latter end? and till when dost thou not say to the people to  turn back from after their brethren?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> And Joab saith, `God liveth! for unless thou hadst spoken,  surely then from the morning had the people gone up each from  after his brother.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> And Joab bloweth with a trumpet, and all the people stand  still, and pursue no more after Israel, nor have they added any  more to fight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> And Abner and his men have gone through the plain all that  night, and pass over the Jordan, and go on [through] all  Bithron, and come in to Mahanaim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:30">2:30</a> And Joab hath turned back from after Abner, and gathereth  all the people, and there are lacking of the servants of David  nineteen men, and Asahel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:31">2:31</a> and the servants of David have smitten of Benjamin, even  among the men of Abner, three hundred and sixty men -- they died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:32">2:32</a> And they lift up Asahel, and bury him in the burying-place  of his father, which [is] in Beth-Lehem, and they go all the  night -- Joab and his men -- and it is light to them in Hebron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And the war is long between the house of Saul and the house  of David, and David is going on and [is] strong, and the house  of Saul are going on and [are] weak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And there are born to David sons in Hebron, and his  first-born is Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> and his second [is] Chileab, of Abigail wife of Nabal the  Carmelite, and the third [is] Absalom son of Maacah daughter of  Talmai king of Geshur,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> and the fourth [is] Adonijah son of Haggith, and the fifth  [is] Shephatiah son of Abital,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> and the sixth [is] Ithream, of Eglah wife of David; these  have been born to David in Hebron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And it cometh to pass, in the war being between the house of  Saul and the house of David, that Abner hath been strengthening  himself in the house of Saul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> and Saul hath a concubine, and her name [is] Rizpah daughter  of Aiah, and [Ish-Bosheth] saith unto Abner, `Wherefore hast  thou gone in unto the concubine of my father?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And it is displeasing to Abner exceedingly, because of the  words of Ish-Bosheth, and he saith, `The head of a dog [am]  I -- that in reference to Judah to-day I do kindness with the  house of Saul thy father, unto his brethren, and unto his  friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of  David -- that thou chargest against me iniquity concerning the  woman to-day?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> thus doth God to Abner, and thus He doth add to him, surely  as Jehovah hath sworn to David -- surely so I do to him:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> to cause the kingdom to pass over from the house of Saul,  and to raise up the throne of David over Israel, and over  Judah, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And he is not able any more to turn back Abner a word,  because of his fearing him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And Abner sendeth messengers unto David for himself, saying,  `Whose [is] the land?' saying, `Make thy covenant with me, and  lo, my hand [is] with thee, to bring round unto thee all  Israel.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> And he saith, `Good -- I make with thee a covenant; only, one  thing I am asking of thee, that is, Thou dost not see my face,  except thou dost first bring in Michal, daughter of Saul in thy  coming into see my face.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And David sendeth messengers unto Ish-Bosheth son of Saul,  saying, `Give up my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself  with a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And Ish-Bosheth sendeth, and taketh her from a man, from  Phaltiel son of Laish,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> and her husband goeth with her, going on and weeping behind  her, unto Bahurim, and Abner saith unto him, `Go, turn back;'  and he turneth back.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> And the word of Abner was with the elders of Israel,  saying, `Heretofore ye have been seeking David for king over  you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> and now, do [it], for Jehovah hath spoken of David saying,  By the hand of David my servant -- to save My people Israel out  of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all  their enemies.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> And Abner speaketh also in the ears of Benjamin, and Abner  goeth also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that  [is] good in the eyes of Israel, and in the eyes of all the  house of Benjamin,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> and Abner cometh in unto David, to Hebron, and with him  twenty men, and David maketh for Abner, and for the men who  [are] with him, a banquet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> And Abner saith unto David, `I arise, and go, and gather  unto my lord the king the whole of Israel, and they make with  thee a covenant, and thou hast reigned over all that thy soul  desireth;' and David sendeth away Abner, and he goeth in peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> And lo, the servants of David, and Joab, have come from the  troop, and much spoil have brought with them, and Abner is not  with David in Hebron, for he hath sent him away, and he goeth  in peace;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> and Joab and all the host that [is] with him have come, and  they declare to Joab, saying, `Abner son of Ner hath come unto  the king, and he sendeth him away, and he goeth in peace.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> And Joab cometh unto the king, and saith, `What hast thou  done? lo, Abner hath come unto thee! why [is] this -- thou hast  sent him away, and he is really gone?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> Thou hast known Abner son of Ner, that to deceive thee he  came, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all  that thou art doing.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> And Joab goeth out from David, and sendeth messengers after  Abner, and they bring him back from the well of Sirah, and  David knew not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> And Abner turneth back to Hebron, and Joab turneth him  aside unto the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and  smiteth him there in the fifth [rib] -- and he dieth -- for the  blood of Asahel his brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:28">3:28</a> And David heareth afterwards and saith, `Acquitted [am] I,  and my kingdom, by Jehovah, unto the age, from the blood of  Abner son of Ner;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:29">3:29</a> it doth stay on the head of Joab, and on all the house of  his father, and there is not cut off from the house of Joab one  having an issue, and leprous, and laying hold on a staff, and  falling by a sword, and lacking bread.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:30">3:30</a> And Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner because that he  put to death Asahel their brother, in Gibeon, in battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:31">3:31</a> And David saith unto Joab, and unto all the people who  [are] with him, `Rend your garments, and gird on sackcloth, and  mourn before Abner;' and king David is going after the bier.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:32">3:32</a> And they bury Abner in Hebron, and the king lifteth up his  voice, and weepeth at the grave of Abner, and all the people  weep;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:33">3:33</a> and the king lamenteth for Abner, and saith: -- `As the  death of a fool doth Abner die?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:34">3:34</a> Thy hands not bound, And thy feet to fetters not brought  nigh! As one falling before sons of evil -- Thou hast fallen!'  and all the people add to weep over him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:35">3:35</a> And all the people come to cause David to eat bread while  yet day, and David sweareth, saying, `Thus doth God to me, and  thus He doth add, for -- before the going in of the sun, I  taste no bread or any other thing.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:36">3:36</a> And all the people have discerned [it], and it is good in  their eyes, as all that the king hath done is good in the eyes  of all the people;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:37">3:37</a> and all the people know, even all Israel, in that day, that  it hath not been from the king -- to put to death Abner son of  Ner.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:38">3:38</a> And the king saith unto his servants, `Do ye not know that  a prince and a great one hath fallen this day in Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:39">3:39</a> and I to-day [am] tender, and an anointed king: and these  men, sons of Zeruiah, [are] too hard for me; Jehovah doth  recompense to the doer of the evil according to his evil.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And the son of Saul heareth that Abner [is] dead in Hebron,  and his hands are feeble, and all Israel have been troubled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And two men, heads of troops, have been [to] the son of  Saul, the name of the one [is] Baanah, and the name of the  second Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of  Benjamin, for also Beeroth is reckoned to Benjamin,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> and the Beerothites flee to Gittaim, and are there  sojourners unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And to Jonathan son of Saul [is] a son -- lame; he was a son  of five years at the coming in of the rumour of [the death of]  Saul and Jonathan, out of Jezreel, and his nurse lifteth him  up, and fleeth, and it cometh to pass in her hasting to flee,  that he falleth, and becometh lame, and his name [is]  Mephibosheth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah,  go, and come in at the heat of the day unto the house of  Ish-Bosheth, and he is lying down -- the lying down of noon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> and thither they have come, unto the midst of the house,  taking wheat, and they smite him unto the fifth [rib], and  Rechab and Baanah his brother have escaped;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> yea, they come in to the house, and he is lying on his bed,  in the inner part of his bed-chamber, and they smite him, and  put him to death, and turn aside his head, and they take his  head, and go the way of the plain all the night,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> and bring in the head of Ish-Bosheth unto David in Hebron,  and say unto the king, `Lo, the head of Ish-Bosheth, son of  Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life; and Jehovah doth give to  my lord the king vengeance this day, of Saul and of his  seed.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And David answereth Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of  Rimmon the Beerothite, and saith to them, `Jehovah liveth, who  hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> when one is declaring to me, saying, Lo, Saul is dead, and  he was as a bearer of tidings in his own eyes, then I take hold  on him, and slay him in Ziklag, instead of my giving to him  [for] the tidings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> Also -- when wicked men have slain the righteous man in his  own house, on his bed; and now, do not I require his blood of  your hand, and have taken you away from the earth?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And David commandeth the young men, and they slay them, and  cut off their hands and their feet, and hang [them] over the  pool in Hebron, and the head of Ish-Bosheth they have taken,  and bury [it] in the burying-place of Abner in Hebron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And all the tribes of Israel come unto David, to Hebron, and  speak, saying, `Lo, we [are] thy bone and thy flesh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> also heretofore, in Saul's being king over us, thou hast  been he who is bringing out and bringing in Israel, and Jehovah  saith to thee, Thou dost feed My people Israel, and thou art  for leader over Israel.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And all the elders of Israel come unto the king, to Hebron,  and king David maketh with them a covenant in Hebron before  Jehovah, and they anoint David for king over Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> A son of thirty years [is] David in his being king; forty  years he hath reigned;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> in Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months,  and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years, over all  Israel and Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And the king goeth, and his men, to Jerusalem, unto the  Jebusite, the inhabitant of the land, and they speak to David,  saying, `Thou dost not come in hither, except thou turn aside  the blind and the lame;' saying, `David doth not come in  hither.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> And David captureth the fortress of Zion, it [is] the city  of David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And David saith on that day, `Any one smiting the Jebusite,  (let him go up by the watercourse), and the lame and the  blind -- the hated of David's soul,' -- because the blind and lame  say, `He doth not come into the house.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> And David dwelleth in the fortress, and calleth it -- City of  David, and David buildeth round about, from Millo and inward,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> and David goeth, going on and becoming great, and Jehovah,  God of Hosts, [is] with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And Hiram king of Tyre sendeth messengers unto David, and  cedar-trees, and artificers of wood, and artificers of stone,  for walls, and they build a house for David,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> and David knoweth that Jehovah hath established him for  king over Israel, and that He hath lifted up his kingdom,  because of His people Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> And David taketh again concubines and wives out of  Jerusalem, after his coming from Hebron, and there are born  again to David sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> And these [are] the names of those born to him in  Jerusalem: Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</p>

 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> And David asketh of Jehovah, saying, `Do I go up unto the  Philistines? dost Thou give them into my hand?' And Jehovah  saith unto David, `Go up, for I certainly give the Philistines  into thy hand.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> And David cometh in to Baal-Perazim, and David smiteth them  there, and saith, `Jehovah hath broken forth [on] mine enemies  before me, as the breaking forth of waters;' therefore he hath  called the name of that place Baal-Perazim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> And they forsake there their idols, and David and his men  lift them up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> And the Philistines add again to come up, and are spread  out in the valley of Rephaim,</p>

 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> and it cometh to pass, in thy hearing the sound of a  stepping in the tops of the mulberries, then thou dost move  sharply, for then hath Jehovah gone out before thee to smite in  the camp of the Philistines.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> And David doth so, as Jehovah commanded him, and smiteth  the Philistines from Geba unto thy coming to Gazer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> And David gathered again every chosen one in Israel, thirty  thousand,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> and David riseth and goeth, and all the people who [are]  with him, from Baale-Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God,  whose name hath been called -- the name of Jehovah of Hosts,  inhabiting the cherubs -- upon it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And they cause the ark of God to ride on a new cart, and  lift it up from the house of Abinadab, which [is] in the  height, and Uzzah and Ahio sons of Abinadab are leading the new  cart;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> and they lift it up from the house of Abinadab, which [is]  in the height, with the ark of God, and Ahio is going before  the ark,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> and David and all the house of Israel are playing before  Jehovah, with all kinds of [instruments] of fir-wood, even with  harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with  cornets, and with cymbals.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> And they come unto the threshing-floor of Nachon, and Uzzah  putteth forth [his hand] unto the ark of God, and layeth hold  on it, for they released the oxen;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> and the anger of Jehovah burneth against Uzzah, and God  smiteth him there for the error, and he dieth there by the ark  of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And it is displeasing to David, because that Jehovah hath  broken forth a breach upon Uzzah, and [one] calleth that place  Perez-Uzzah, unto this day;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> and David feareth Jehovah on that day, and saith, `How doth  the ark of Jehovah come in unto me?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And David hath not been willing to turn aside unto himself  the ark of Jehovah, to the city of David, and David turneth it  aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> and the ark of Jehovah doth inhabit the house of Obed-Edom  the Gittite three months, and Jehovah blesseth Obed-Edom and  all his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And it is declared to king David, saying, `Jehovah hath  blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he hath, because  of the ark of God;' and David goeth and bringeth up the ark of  God from the house of Obed-Edom to the city of David with joy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> And it cometh to pass, when those bearing the ark of  Jehovah have stepped six steps, that he sacrificeth an ox and a  fatling.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> And David is dancing with all strength before Jehovah, and  David is girded with a linen ephod,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> and David and all the house of Israel are bringing up the  ark of Jehovah with shouting, and with the voice of a trumpet,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> and it hath come to pass, the ark of Jehovah hath come in  to the city of David, and Michal daughter of Saul, hath looked  through the window, and seeth king David moving and dancing  before Jehovah, and despiseth him in her heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> And they bring in the ark of Jehovah, and set it up in its  place, in the midst of the tent which David hath spread out for  it, and David causeth to ascend burnt-offerings before Jehovah,  and peace-offerings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> And David finisheth from causing to ascend the  burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, and blesseth the  people in the name of Jehovah of Hosts,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> and he apportioneth to all the people, to all the multitude  of Israel, from man even unto woman, to each, one cake of  bread, and one eshpar, and one ashisha, and all the people go,  each to his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> And David turneth back to bless his house, and Michal  daughter of Saul goeth out to meet David, and saith, `How  honourable to-day was the king of Israel, who was uncovered  to-day before the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one  of the vain ones is openly uncovered!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> And David saith unto Michal, `-- Before Jehovah, who fixed  on me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me  leader over the people of Jehovah, and over Israel, -- yea, I  played before Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> and I have been more vile than this, and have been low in  mine eyes, and with the handmaids whom thou hast spoken of,  with them I am honoured.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> As to Michal daughter of Saul, she had no child till the  day of her death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And it cometh to pass, when the king sat in his house, and  Jehovah hath given rest to him round about, from all his  enemies,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> that the king saith unto Nathan the prophet, `See, I pray  thee, I am dwelling in a house of cedars, and the ark of God is  dwelling in the midst of the curtain.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> And Nathan saith unto the king, `All that [is] in thine  heart -- go, do, for Jehovah [is] with thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> And it cometh to pass in that night, that the word of  Jehovah is unto Nathan, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> `Go, and thou hast said unto My servant, unto David, Thus  said Jehovah, Dost thou build for Me a house for My dwelling  in?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> for I have not dwelt in a house even from the day of My  bringing up the sons of Israel out of Egypt, even unto this  day, and am walking up and down in a tent and in a tabernacle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> During all [the time] that I have walked up and down among  all the sons of Israel, a word have I spoken with one of the  tribes of Israel which I commanded to feed my people Israel,  saying, `Why have ye not built to Me a house of cedars?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> and now, thus dost thou say to My servant, to David: `Thus  said Jehovah of Hosts, I have taken thee from the comely place,  from after the flock, to be leader over My people, over Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> and I am with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and I cut  off all thine enemies from thy presence, and have made for thee  a great name, as the name of the great ones who [are] in the  earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> and I have appointed a place for My people, for Israel, and  have planted it, and it hath tabernacled in its place, and it  is not troubled any more, and the sons of perverseness do not  add to afflict it any more, as in the beginning,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> even from the day that I appointed judges over My people  Israel; and I have given rest to thee from all thine enemies,  and Jehovah hath declared to thee that Jehovah doth make for  thee a house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> `When thy days are full, and thou hast lain with thy  fathers, then I have raised up thy seed after thee which goeth  out from thy bowels, and have established his kingdom;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> He doth build a house for My Name, and I have established  the throne of his kingdom unto the age.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> I am to him for a father, and he is to Me for a son; whom  in his dealings perversely I have even reproved with a rod of  men, and with strokes of the sons of Adam,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> and My kindness doth not turn aside from him, as I turned  it aside from Saul, whom I turned aside from before thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> and stedfast [is] thy house and thy kingdom unto the age  before thee, thy throne is established unto the age.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> According to all these words, and according to all this  vision, so spake Nathan unto David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> And king David cometh in and sitteth before Jehovah, and  saith, `Who [am] I, Lord Jehovah? and what my house, that Thou  hast brought me hitherto?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> And yet this [is] little in Thine eyes, Lord Jehovah, and  Thou dost speak also concerning the house of Thy servant afar  off; and this [is] the law of the Man, Lord Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> And what doth David add more to speak unto Thee? and Thou,  Thou hast known Thy servant, Lord Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> Because of Thy word, and according to Thy heart, Thou hast  done all this greatness, to cause Thy servant to know [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> Therefore Thou hast been great, Jehovah God, for there is  none like Thee, and there is no God save Thee, according to all  that we have heard with our ears.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> `And who [is] as Thy people, as Israel -- one nation in the  earth, whom God hath gone to redeem to Him for a people, and to  make for Him a name -- and to do for you the greatness -- even  fearful things for Thy land, at the presence of Thy people, whom  Thou hast redeemed to Thee out of Egypt -- [among the] nations  and their gods?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> Yea, Thou dost establish to Thee Thy people Israel, to Thee  for a people unto the age, and Thou, Jehovah, hast been to them  for God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> `And now, Jehovah God, the word which Thou hast spoken  concerning Thy servant, and concerning his house, establish unto  the age, and do as Thou hast spoken;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:26">7:26</a> And Thy Name is great unto the age, saying, Jehovah of Hosts  [is] God over Israel, and the house of Thy servant David is  established before Thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:27">7:27</a> For Thou, Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Thou hast  uncovered the ear of Thy servant, saying, A house I build for  thee, therefore hath Thy servant found his heart to pray unto  Thee this prayer;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:28">7:28</a> And now, Lord Jehovah, Thou [art] God Himself, and Thy  words are truth, and Thou speakest unto Thy servant this  goodness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:29">7:29</a> And now, begin and bless the house of Thy servant, to be  unto the age before Thee, for Thou, Lord Jehovah, hast spoken,  and by Thy blessing is the house of Thy servant blessed -- to the  age.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And it cometh to pass afterwards that David smiteth the  Philistines, and humbleth them, and David taketh the bridle of  the metropolis out of the hand of the Philistines.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And he smiteth Moab, and measureth them with a line, causing  them to lie down on the earth, and he measureth two lines to  put to death, and the fulness of the line to keep alive, and  the Moabites are to David for servants, bearers of a present.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And David smiteth Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, in  his going to bring back his power by the River [Euphrates;]</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> and David captureth from him a thousand and seven hundred  horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and David destroyeth  utterly the whole of the charioteers, only he leaveth of them a  hundred charioteers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And Aram of Damascus cometh to give help to Hadadezer king  of Zobah, and David smiteth of Aram twenty and two thousand  men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> and David putteth garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and Aram is  to David for a servant, bearing a present; and Jehovah saveth  David whithersoever he hath gone;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> and David taketh the shields of gold which were on the  servants of Hadadezer, and bringeth them to Jerusalem;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> and from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, hath  king David taken very much brass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> And Toi king of Hamath heareth that David hath smitten all  the force of Hadadezer,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> and Toi sendeth Joram his son unto king David to ask of him  of welfare, and to bless him, (because that he hath fought  against Hadadezer, and smiteth him, for a man of wars [with]  Toi had Hadadezer been), and in his hand have been vessels of  silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> also them did king David sanctify to Jehovah, with the  silver and the gold which he sanctified of all the nations  which he subdued:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> of Aram, and of Moab, and of the Bene-Ammon, and of the  Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer son  of Rehob king of Zobah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And David maketh a name in his turning back from his  smiting Aram in the valley of Salt -- eighteen thousand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> and he putteth in Edom garrisons -- in all Edom he hath put  garrisons, and all Edom are servants to David; and Jehovah  saveth David whithersoever he hath gone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And David reigneth over all Israel, and David is doing  judgment and righteousness to all his people,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> and Joab son of Zeruiah [is] over the host, and Jehoshaphat  son of Ahilud [is] remembrancer,</p>

 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And David saith, `Is there yet any left to the house of  Saul, and I do with him kindness because of Jonathan?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> And the house of Saul hath a servant, and his name [is]  Ziba, and they call for him unto David; and the king saith unto  him, `Art thou Ziba?' and he saith, `Thy servant.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And the king saith, `Is there not yet a man to the house of  Saul, and I do with him the kindness of God?' And Ziba saith  unto the king, `Jonathan hath yet a son -- lame.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> And the king saith to him, `Where [is] he?' and Ziba saith  unto the king, `Lo, he [is] in the house of Machir, son of  Ammiel, in Lo-Debar.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> and Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, son of Saul, cometh unto  David, and falleth on his face, and doth obeisance, and David  saith, `Mephibosheth;' and he saith, `Lo, thy servant.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> And David saith to him, `Be not afraid; for I certainly do  with thee kindness because of Jonathan thy father, and have  given back to thee all the field of Saul thy father, and thou  dost eat bread at my table continually.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And he boweth himself, and saith, `What [is] thy servant,  that thou hast turned unto the dead dog -- such as I?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And the king calleth unto Ziba servant of Saul, and saith  unto him, `All that was to Saul and to all his house, I have  given to the son of thy lord,</p>

 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> and David saith, `I do kindness with Hanun son of Nahash,  as his father did with me kindness;' and David sendeth to  comfort him by the hand of his servants concerning his father,  and the servants of David come in to the land of the  Bene-Ammon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> And the heads of the Bene-Ammon say unto Hanun their lord,  `Is David honouring thy father in thine eyes because he hath  sent to thee comforters? for to search the city, and to spy it,  and to overthrow it, hath not David sent his servants unto  thee?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> And Hanun taketh the servants of David, and shaveth off the  half of their beard, and cutteth off their long robes in the  midst -- unto their buttocks, and sendeth them away;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> and they declare [it] to David, and he sendeth to meet  them, for the men have been greatly ashamed, and the king  saith, `Abide in Jericho till your beard doth spring up -- then  ye have returned.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And the Bene-Ammon see that they have been abhorred by  David, and the Bene-Ammon send and hire Aram of Beth-Rehob, and  Aram of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah  [with] a thousand men, and Ish-Tob [with] twelve thousand men;</p>

 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> And the Bene-Ammon come out, and set battle in array, at  the opening of the gate, and Aram of Zoba, and Rehob, and  Ish-Tob, and Maacah, [are] by themselves in the field;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> and Joab seeth that the front of the battle hath been unto  him before and behind, and he chooseth of all the chosen in  Israel, and setteth in array to meet Aram,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> and the rest of the people he hath given into the hand of  Abishai his brother, and setteth in array to meet the  Bene-Ammon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> And he saith, `If Aram be stronger than I, then thou hast  been to me for salvation, and if the Bene-Ammon be stronger  than thou, then I have come to give salvation to thee;</p>

 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> And Joab draweth nigh, and the people who [are] with him,  to battle against Aram, and they flee from his presence;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> and the Bene-Ammon have seen that Aram hath fled, and they  flee from the presence of Abishai, and go in to the city; and  Joab turneth back from the Bene-Ammon, and cometh in to  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> And Aram seeth that it is smitten before Israel, and they  are gathered together;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> and Hadadezer sendeth, and bringeth out Aram which [is]  beyond the River, and they come in to Helam, and Shobach head  of the host of Hadadezer [is] before them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> And it is declared to David, and he gathereth all Israel,  and passeth over the Jordan, and cometh in to Helam, and Aram  setteth itself in array to meet David, and they fight with him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> and Aram fleeth from the presence of Israel, and David  slayeth of Aram seven hundred charioteers, and forty thousand  horsemen, and Shobach head of its host he hath smitten, and he  dieth there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> And all the kings -- servants of Hadadezer -- see that they  have been smitten before Israel, and make peace with Israel,  and serve them; and Aram is afraid to help any more the  Bene-Ammon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And it cometh to pass, at the revolution of the year -- at  the time of the going out of the messengers -- that David sendeth  Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel, and they  destroy the Bene-Ammon, and lay siege against Rabbah. And David  is dwelling in Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> and it cometh to pass, at evening-time, that David riseth  from off his couch, and walketh up and down on the roof of the  king's house, and seeth from the roof a woman bathing, and the  woman [is] of very good appearance,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> and David sendeth and inquireth about the woman, and saith,  `Is not this Bath-Sheba, daughter of Eliam, wife of Uriah the  Hittite?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> And David sendeth messengers, and taketh her, and she  cometh unto him, and he lieth with her -- and she is purifying  herself from her uncleanness -- and she turneth back unto her  house;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> and the woman conceiveth, and sendeth, and declareth to  David, and saith, `I [am] conceiving.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> And David saith to Uriah, `Go down to thy house, and wash  thy feet;' and Uriah goeth out of the king's house, and there  goeth out after him a gift from the king,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> and Uriah lieth down at the opening of the king's house,  with all the servants of his lord, and hath not gone down unto  his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> And they declare to David, saying, `Uriah hath not gone  down unto his house;' and David saith unto Uriah, `Hast thou  not come from a journey? wherefore hast thou not gone down unto  thy house?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> And Uriah saith unto David, `The ark, and Israel, and  Judah, are abiding in booths, and my lord Joab, and the  servants of my lord, on the face of the field are encamping;  and I -- I go in unto my house to eat and to drink, and to lie  with my wife! -- thy life, and the life of thy soul -- if I do this  thing.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> And David saith unto Uriah, `Abide in this [place] also  to-day, and to-morrow I send thee away;' and Uriah abideth in  Jerusalem, on that day, and on the morrow,</p>

 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> And it cometh to pass in Joab's watching of the city, that  he appointeth Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant  men [are];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> and the men of the city go out and fight with Joab, and  there fall [some] of the people, of the servants of David; and  there dieth also Uriah the Hittite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> And Joab sendeth and declareth to David all the matters of  the war,</p>

 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> then, it hath been, if the king's fury ascend, and he hath  said to thee, Wherefore did ye draw nigh unto the city to  fight? did ye not know that they shoot from off the wall?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> Who smote Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman  cast on him a piece of a rider from the wall, and he dieth in  Thebez? why drew ye nigh unto the wall? that thou hast said,  Also thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> And the messenger goeth, and cometh in, and declareth to  David all that with which Joab sent him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> and the messenger saith unto David, `Surely the men have  been mighty against us, and come out unto us into the field,  and we are upon them unto the opening of the gate,</p>

 <p><a name="an_11:25">11:25</a> And David saith unto the messenger, `Thus dost thou say  unto Joab, Let not this thing be evil in thine eyes; for thus  and thus doth the sword devour; strengthen thy warfare against  the city, and throw it down -- and strengthen thou him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:26">11:26</a> And the wife of Uriah heareth that Uriah her husband [is]  dead, and lamenteth for her lord;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:27">11:27</a> and the mourning passeth by, and David sendeth and  gathereth her unto his house, and she is to him for a wife, and  beareth to him a son; and the thing which David hath done is  evil in the eyes of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> And Jehovah sendeth Nathan unto David, and he cometh unto  him, and saith to him: `Two men have been in one city; One rich  and one poor;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> The rich hath flocks and herds very many;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> And the poor one hath nothing, Except one little ewe-lamb,  Which he hath bought, and keepeth alive, And it groweth up  with him, And with his sons together; Of his morsel it eateth,  And from his cup it drinketh, And in his bosom it lieth, And it  is to him as a daughter;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> And there cometh a traveller to the rich man, And he  spareth to take Of his own flock, and of his own herd, To  prepare for the traveller Who hath come to him, And he taketh  the ewe-lamb of the poor man, And prepareth it for the man Who  hath come unto him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> And the anger of David burneth against the man exceedingly,  and he saith unto Nathan, `Jehovah liveth, surely a son of  death [is] the man who is doing this,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> and the ewe-lamb he doth repay fourfold, because that he  hath done this thing, and because that he had no pity.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> And Nathan saith unto David, `Thou [art] the man! Thus said  Jehovah, God of Israel, I anointed thee for king over Israel,  and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> and I give to thee the house of thy lord, and the wives of  thy lord, into thy bosom, and I give to thee the house of  Israel and of Judah; and if little, then I add to thee such and  such [things].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> `Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do  the evil thing in His eyes? Uriah the Hittite thou hast smitten  by the sword, and his wife thou hast taken to thee for a wife,  and him thou hast slain by the sword of the Bene-Ammon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> `And now, the sword doth not turn aside from thy house  unto the age, because thou hast despised Me, and dost take the  wife of Uriah the Hittite to be to thee for a wife;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> thus said Jehovah, Lo, I am raising up against thee evil,  out of thy house, and have taken thy wives before thine eyes,  and given to thy neighbour, and he hath lain with thy wives  before the eyes of this sun;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> for thou hast done [it] in secret, and I do this thing  before all Israel, and before the sun.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> And David saith unto Nathan, `I have sinned against  Jehovah.' And Nathan saith unto David, `Also -- Jehovah hath  caused thy sin to pass away; thou dost not die;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> only, because thou hast caused the enemies of Jehovah  greatly to despise by this thing, also the son who is born to  thee doth surely die.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> And Nathan goeth unto his house, and Jehovah smiteth the  lad, whom the wife of Uriah hath born to David, and it is  incurable;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> and David seeketh God for the youth, and David keepeth a  fast, and hath gone in and lodged, and lain on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> And the elders of his house rise against him, to raise him  up from the earth, and he hath not been willing, nor hath he  eaten with them bread;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:18">12:18</a> and it cometh to pass on the seventh day, that the lad  dieth, and the servants of David fear to declare to him that  the lad is dead, for they said, `Lo, in the lad being alive we  spake unto him, and he did not hearken to our voice; and how do  we say unto him, The lad is dead? -- then he hath done evil.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:19">12:19</a> And David seeth that his servants are whispering, and  David understandeth that the lad is dead, and David saith unto  his servants, `Is the lad dead?' and they say, `Dead.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:20">12:20</a> And David riseth from the earth, and doth bathe and anoint  [himself], and changeth his raiment, and cometh in to the house  of Jehovah, and boweth himself, and cometh unto his house, and  asketh and they place for him bread, and he eateth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:21">12:21</a> And his servants say unto him, `What [is] this thing thou  hast done? because of the living lad thou hast fasted and dost  weep, and when the lad is dead thou hast risen and dost eat  bread.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:22">12:22</a> And he saith, `While the lad is alive I have fasted, and  weep, for I said, Who knoweth? -- Jehovah doth pity me, and the  lad hath lived;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:23">12:23</a> and now, he hath died, why [is] this -- I fast? am I able to  bring him back again? I am going unto him, and he doth not turn  back unto me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:24">12:24</a> And David comforteth Bath-Sheba his wife, and goeth in  unto her, and lieth with her, and she beareth a son, and he  calleth his name Solomon; and Jehovah hath loved him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:25">12:25</a> and sendeth by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and calleth  his name Jedidiah, because of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:26">12:26</a> And Joab fighteth against Rabbah of the Bene-Ammon, and  captureth the royal city,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:27">12:27</a> and Joab sendeth messengers unto David, and saith, `I have  fought against Rabbah -- also I have captured the city of waters;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:28">12:28</a> and now, gather the rest of the people, and encamp against  the city, and capture it, lest I capture the city, and my name  hath been called upon it.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:29">12:29</a> And David gathereth all the people, and goeth to Rabbah,  and fighteth against it, and captureth it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:30">12:30</a> and he taketh the crown of their king from off his head,  and its weight [is] a talent of gold, and precious stones, and  it is on the head of David; and the spoil of the city he hath  brought out, very much;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:31">12:31</a> and the people who [are] in it he hath brought out, and  setteth to the saw, and to cutting instruments of iron, and to  axes of iron, and hath caused them to pass over into the  brick-kiln; and so he doth to all the cities of the Bene-Ammon;  and David turneth back, and all the people, to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> And it cometh to pass afterwards that Absalom son of David  hath a fair sister, and her name [is] Tamar, and Amnon son of  David loveth her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> And Amnon hath distress -- even to become sick, because of  Tamar his sister, for she [is] a virgin, and it is hard in the  eyes of Amnon to do anything to her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> And Amnon hath a friend, and his name [is] Jonadab, son of  Shimeah, David's brother, and Jonadab [is] a very wise man,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> and saith to him, `Wherefore [art] thou thus lean, O king's  son, morning by morning? dost thou not declare to me?' And Amnon  saith to him, `Tamar -- sister of Absalom my brother -- I am  loving.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> And Jonadab saith to him, `Lie down on thy couch, and feign  thyself sick, and thy father hath come in to see thee, and thou  hast said unto him, `Let, I pray thee, Tamar my sister come in  and give me bread to eat; and she hath made the food before  mine eyes so that I see [it], and have eaten from her hand.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> And Amnon lieth down, and feigneth himself sick, and the  king cometh in to see him, and Amnon saith unto the king, `Let,  I pray thee, Tamar my sister come, and she maketh before mine  eyes two cakes, and I eat from her hand.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> And David sendeth unto Tamar, to the house, saying, `Go, I  pray thee, to the house of Amnon thy brother, and make for him  food.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> And Tamar goeth to the house of Amnon her brother, and he  is lying down, and she taketh the dough, and kneadeth, and  maketh cakes before his eyes, and cooketh the cakes,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> and taketh the frying-pan, and poureth out before him, and  he refuseth to eat, and Amnon saith, `Take ye out every one  from me;' and they go out every one from him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> And Amnon saith unto Tamar, `Bring the food into the inner  chamber, and I eat from thy hand;' and Tamar taketh the cakes  that she hath made, and bringeth in to Amnon her brother, into  the inner chamber,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> and she bringeth nigh unto him to eat, and he layeth hold  on her, and saith to her, `Come, lie with me, my sister.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> And she saith to him, `Nay, my brother, do not humble me,  for it is not done so in Israel; do not this folly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> And I -- whither do I cause my reproach to go? and  thou -- thou art as one of the fools in Israel; and now, speak, I  pray thee, unto the king; for he doth not withhold me from  thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> And he hath not been willing to hearken to her voice, and  is stronger than she, and humbleth her, and lieth with her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> And Amnon hateth her -- a very great hatred -- that greater  [is] the hatred with which he hath hated her than the love with  which he loved her, and Amnon saith to her, `Rise, go.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> And she saith to him, `Because of the circumstances this  evil is greater than the other that thou hast done with me -- to  send me away;' and he hath not been willing to hearken to her,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> and calleth his young man, his servant, and saith, `Send  away, I pray thee, this one from me without, and bolt the door  after her;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> -- and upon her [is] a long coat, for such upper robes do  daughters of the king who [are] virgins put on, -- and his  servant taketh her out without, and hath bolted the door after  her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> And Tamar taketh ashes for her head, and the long coat  that [is] on her she hath rent, and putteth her hand on her  head, and goeth, going on and crying;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> and Absalom her brother saith unto her, `Hath Amnon thy  brother been with thee? and now, my sister, keep silent, he  [is] thy brother; set not thy heart to this thing;' and Tamar  dwelleth -- but desolate -- in the house of Absalom her brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> And king David hath heard all these things, and it is very  displeasing to him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> and Absalom hath not spoken with Amnon either evil or  good, for Absalom is hating Amnon, because that he humbled  Tamar his sister.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> And it cometh to pass, after two years of days, that  Absalom hath shearers in Baal-Hazor, which [is] with Ephraim,  and Absalom calleth for all the sons of the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:24">13:24</a> And Absalom cometh unto the king, and saith, `Lo, I pray  thee, thy servant hath shearers, let the king go, I pray thee,  and his servants, with thy servant.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:25">13:25</a> And the king saith unto Absalom, `Nay, my son, let us not  all go, I pray thee, and we are not too heavy on thee;' and he  presseth on him, and he hath not been willing to go, and he  blesseth him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:26">13:26</a> And Absalom saith, `If not -- let, I pray thee, Amnon my  brother go with us;' and the king saith to him, `Why doth he go  with thee?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:27">13:27</a> and Absalom urgeth on him, and he sendeth with him Amnon,  and all the sons of the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:28">13:28</a> And Absalom commandeth his young men, saying, `See, I pray  thee, when the heart of Amnon [is] glad with wine, and I have  said unto you, Smite Amnon, that ye have put him to death; fear  not; is it not because I have commanded you? be strong, yea,  become sons of valour.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:29">13:29</a> And the young men of Absalom do to Amnon as Absalom  commanded, and rise do all the sons of the king, and they ride,  each on his mule, and flee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:30">13:30</a> And it cometh to pass -- they [are] in the way -- and the  report hath come unto David, saying, `Absalom hath smitten all  the sons of the king, and there is not left of them one;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:31">13:31</a> and the king riseth, and rendeth his garments, and lieth  on the earth, and all his servants are standing by [with] rent  garments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:32">13:32</a> And Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, answereth and  saith, `Let not my lord say, The whole of the young men, the  sons of the king, they have put to death; for Amnon alone [is]  dead, for by the command of Absalom it hath been appointed from  the day of his humbling Tamar his sister;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:33">13:33</a> and now, let not my lord the king lay unto his heart the  word, saying, All the sons of the king have died, for Amnon  alone [is] dead.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:34">13:34</a> And Absalom fleeth, and the young man who is watching  lifteth up his eyes and looketh, and lo, much people are coming  by the way behind him, on the side of the hill.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:35">13:35</a> And Jonadab saith unto the king, `Lo, the sons of the king  have come; as the word of thy servant, so it hath been.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:36">13:36</a> And it cometh to pass at his finishing to speak, that lo,  the sons of the king have come, and they lift up their voice,  and weep, and also the king and all his servants have wept -- a  very great weeping.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:37">13:37</a> And Absalom hath fled, and goeth unto Talmai, son of  Ammihud, king of Geshur, and [David] mourneth for his son all  the days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:38">13:38</a> And Absalom hath fled, and goeth to Geshur, and is there  three years;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:39">13:39</a> and [the soul of] king David determineth to go out unto  Absalom, for he hath been comforted for Amnon, for [he is]  dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And Joab son of Zeruial knoweth that the heart of the king  [is] on Absalom,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> and Joab sendeth to Tekoah, and taketh thence a wise woman,  and saith unto her, `Feign thyself a mourner, I pray thee, and  put on, I pray thee, garments of mourning, and anoint not  thyself with oil, and thou hast been as a woman these many days  mourning for the dead,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> and thou hast gone unto the king, and spoken unto him,  according to this word;' and Joab putteth the words into her  mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> And the woman of Tekoah speaketh unto the king, and falleth  on her face to the earth, and doth obeisance, and saith, `Save,  O king.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> And the king saith to her, `What -- to thee?' and she saith,  `Truly a widow woman [am] I, and my husband dieth,</p>

 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> lo, now, he is hidden in one of the pits, or in one of the  places, and it hath been, at the falling among them at the  commencement, that the hearer hath heard, and said, There hath  been a slaughter among the people who [are] after Absalom;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> and he also, the son of valour, whose heart [is] as the  heart of the lion, doth utterly melt, for all Israel doth know  that thy father is a hero, and sons of valour [are] those with  him.</p>

 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> And if unto a city he is gathered, then they have caused  all Israel to bear unto that city ropes, and we have drawn it  unto the brook till that there hath not been found there even a  stone.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> And Absalom saith -- and all the men of Israel -- `Better [is]  the counsel of Hushai the Archite than the counsel of  Ahithophel;' and Jehovah willed to make void the good counsel  of Ahithophel for the sake of Jehovah's bringing unto Absalom  the evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> And Hushai saith unto Zadok and unto Abiathar the priests,  `Thus and thus hath Ahithophel counselled Absalom and the  elders of Israel, and thus and thus I have counselled;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:16">17:16</a> and now, send hastily, and declare to David, saying, Lodge  not to-night in the plains of the wilderness, and also,  certainly pass over, lest there be a swallowing up of the king  and of all the people who are with him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:17">17:17</a> And Jonathan and Ahimaaz are standing at En-Rogel, and the  maid-servant hath gone and declared to them -- and they go and  have declared [it] to king David -- for they are not able to be  seen to go in to the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:18">17:18</a> And a youth seeth them, and declareth to Absalom; and they  go on both of them hastily, and come in unto the house of a man  in Bahurim, and he hath a well in his court, and they go down  there,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:19">17:19</a> and the woman taketh and spreadeth the covering over the  face of the well, and spreadeth on it the ground corn, and the  thing hath not been known.</p>

 <p><a name="an_17:21">17:21</a> And it cometh to pass, after their going on, that they  come up out of the well, and go and declare to king David, and  say unto David, `Rise ye, and pass over hastily the waters, for  thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:22">17:22</a> And David riseth, and all the people who [are] with him,  and they pass over the Jordan, till the light of the morning,  till one hath not been lacking who hath not passed over the  Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:23">17:23</a> And Ahithophel hath seen that his counsel was not done,  and he saddleth the ass, and riseth and goeth unto his house,  unto his city, and giveth charge unto his household, and  strangleth himself, and dieth, and he is buried in the  burying-place of his father.</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> And the king saith unto them, `That which is good in your  eyes I do;' and the king standeth at the side of the gate, and  all the people have gone out by hundreds and by thousands,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> and the king chargeth Joab, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying,  `Gently -- for me, for the youth, for Absalom;' and all the  people heard in the king's charging all the heads concerning  Absalom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> And the people goeth out into the field to meet Israel, and  the battle is in a forest of Ephraim;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> and smitten there are the people of Israel before the  servants of David, and the smiting there is great on that  day -- twenty thousand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> and the battle is there scattered over the face of all the  land, and the forest multiplieth to devour among the people  more than those whom the sword hath devoured in that day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And Absalom meeteth before the servants of David, and  Absalom is riding on the mule, and the mule cometh in under an  entangled bough of the great oak, and his head taketh hold on  the oak, and he is placed between the heavens and the earth,  and the mule that [is] under him hath passed on.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> And one man seeth, and declareth to Joab, and saith, `Lo,  I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> And the man saith unto Joab, `Yea, though I am weighing on  my hand a thousand silverlings, I do not put forth my hand unto  the son of the king; for in our ears hath the king charged  thee, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Observe ye who [is]  against the youth -- against Absalom;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> or I had done against my soul a vain thing, and no matter  is hid from the king, and thou -- thou dost station thyself  over-against.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> and they take Absalom and cast him in the forest unto the  great pit, and set up over him a very great heap of stones, and  all Israel have fled -- each to his tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> And Absalom hath taken, and setteth up for himself in his  life, the standing-pillar that [is] in the king's valley, for  he said, `I have no son to cause my name to be remembered;' and  he calleth the standing-pillar by his own name, and it is  called `The monument of Absalom' unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> And Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, `Let me run, I pray thee,  and I bear the king tidings, for Jehovah hath delivered him out  of the hand of his enemies;'</p>

 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> And the king riseth, and sitteth in the gate, and to all  the people they have declared, saying, `Lo, the king is sitting  in the gate;' and all the people come in before the king, and  Israel hath fled, each to his tents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> And it cometh to pass, all the people are contending  through all the tribes of Israel, saying, `The king delivered  us out of the hand of our enemies, yea, he himself delivered us  out of the hand of the Philistines, and now he hath fled out of  the land because of Absalom,</p>

 <p><a name="an_19:18">19:18</a> And passed over hath the ferry-boat to carry over the  household of the king, and to do that which [is] good in his  eyes, and Shimei son of Gera hath fallen before the king in his  passing over into Jordan,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:19">19:19</a> and saith unto the king, `Let not my lord impute to me  iniquity; neither do thou remember that which thy servant did  perversely in the day that my lord the king went out from  Jerusalem, -- for the king to set [it] unto his heart;</p>

 <p><a name="an_19:36">19:36</a> As a little thing, thy servant doth pass over the Jordan  with the king, and why doth the king recompense me this  recompense?</p>

 <p><a name="an_19:38">19:38</a> And the king saith, `With me doth Chimham go over, and I  do to him that which [is] good in thine eyes, yea, all that  thou dost fix on me I do to thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:39">19:39</a> And all the people pass over the Jordan, and the king hath  passed over, and the king giveth a kiss to Barzillai, and  blesseth him, and he turneth back to his place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:40">19:40</a> And the king passeth over to Gilgal, and Chimham hath  passed over with him, and all the people of Judah, and they  bring over the king, and also the half of the people of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:41">19:41</a> And, lo, all the men of Israel are coming unto the king,  and they say unto the king, `Wherefore have they stolen  thee -- our brethren, the men of Judah?' (and they bring the king  and his household over the Jordan, and all the men of David  with him).</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:42">19:42</a> And all the men of Judah answer against the men of Israel,  `Because the king [is] near unto us, and why [is] this -- ye are  displeased about this matter? have we at all eaten of the  king's [substance?] a gift hath he lifted up to us?'</p>

And the word of  the men of Judah is sharper than the word of the men of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> And there hath been called there a man of worthlessness,  and his name [is] Sheba, son of Bichri, a Benjamite, and he  bloweth with a trumpet, and saith, `We have no portion in  David, and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse; each to  his tents, O Israel.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> And every man of Israel goeth up from after David, after  Sheba son of Bichri, and the men of Judah have cleaved to their  king, from the Jordan even unto Jerusalem.</p>

 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> And Joab saith to Amasa, `Art thou [in] peace, my brother?'  and the right hand of Joab layeth hold on the beard of Amasa to  give a kiss to him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> and Amasa hath not been watchful of the sword that [is] in  the hand of Joab, and he smiteth him with it unto the fifth  [rib], and sheddeth out his bowels to the earth, and he hath  not repeated [it] to him, and he dieth; and Joab and Abishai  his brother have pursued after Sheba son of Bichri.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> And a man hath stood by him, of the young men of Joab, and  saith, `He who hath delight in Joab, and he who [is] for  David -- after Joab!'</p>

 <p><a name="an_20:21">20:21</a> The matter [is] not so; for a man of the hill-country of  Ephraim -- Sheba son of Bichri his name -- hath lifted up his hand  against the king, against David; give ye up him by himself, and  I go away from the city.' And the woman saith unto Joab, `Lo,  his head is cast unto thee over the wall.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:22">20:22</a> And the woman cometh unto all the people in her wisdom,  and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bichri, and cast [it]  unto Joab, and he bloweth with a trumpet, and they are  scattered from the city, each to his tents, and Joab hath  turned back to Jerusalem unto the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:23">20:23</a> And Joab [is] over all the host of Israel, and Benaiah son  of Jehoiada [is] over the Cherethite, and over the Pelethite,</p>
