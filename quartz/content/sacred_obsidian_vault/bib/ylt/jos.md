  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: Joshua</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And it cometh to pass after the death of Moses, servant of  Jehovah, that Jehovah speaketh unto Joshua son of Nun, minister  of Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> `Moses my servant is dead, and now, rise, pass over this  Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I am  giving to them, to the sons of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> `Every place on which the sole of your foot treadeth, to you  I have given it, as I have spoken unto Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> From this wilderness and Lebanon, and unto the great river,  the river Phrath, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the  great Sea -- the going in of the sun -- is your border.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> `No man doth station himself before thee all days of thy  life; as I have been with Moses, I am with thee, I do not fail  thee, nor forsake thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> be strong and courageous, for thou -- thou dost cause this  people to inherit the land which I have sworn to their fathers  to give to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> `Only, be strong and very courageous, to observe to do  according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded thee;  thou dost not turn aside from it right or left, so that thou  dost act wisely in every [place] whither thou goest;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> the book of this law doth not depart out of thy mouth, and  thou hast meditated in it by day and by night, so that thou  dost observe to do according to all that is written in it, for  then thou dost cause thy way to prosper, and then thou dost act  wisely.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> `Have not I commanded thee? be strong and courageous; be not  terrified nor affrighted, for with thee [is] Jehovah thy God in  every [place] whither thou goest.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And Joshua commandeth the authorities of the people,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> `Pass over into the midst of the camp, and command the  people, saying, Prepare for yourselves provision, for within  three days ye are passing over this Jordan, to go in to possess  the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you to possess  it.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And to the Reubenite, and to the Gadite, and to the half of  the tribe of Manasseh, hath Joshua spoken, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> `Remember the word which Moses, servant of Jehovah,  commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God is giving rest to you,  and He hath given to you this land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> your wives, your infants, and your substance, abide in the  land which Moses hath given to you beyond the Jordan, and ye --  ye pass over by fifties, before your brethren, all the mighty  ones of valour, and have helped them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> till that Jehovah giveth rest to your brethren as to  yourselves, and they have possessed, even they, the land which  Jehovah your God is giving to them; then ye have turned back to  the land of your possession, and have possessed it, which  Moses, servant of Jehovah, hath given to you beyond the Jordan,  [at] the sun-rising.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And they answer Joshua, saying, `All that thou hast  commanded us we do; and unto every [place] whither thou dost  send us, we go;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> according to all that we hearkened unto Moses [in], so we  hearken unto thee; surely Jehovah thy God is with thee as He  hath been with Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> Any man who doth provoke thy mouth, and doth not hear thy  words, in all that thou dost command him, is put to death;  only, be strong and courageous.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And Joshua son of Nun sendeth from Shittim, two men, spies,  silently, saying, `Go, see the land -- and Jericho;' and they  go and come into the house of a woman, a harlot, and her name  [is] Rahab, and they lie down there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And it is told to the king of Jericho, saying, `Lo, men have  come in hither to-night, from the sons of Israel, to search the  land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And the king of Jericho sendeth unto Rahab, saying, `Bring  out the men who are coming in unto thee, who have come into thy  house, for to search the whole of the land they have come in.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And the woman taketh the two men, and hideth them, and saith  thus: `The men came in unto me, and I have not known whence  they [are];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> and it cometh to pass -- the gate is to [be] shut -- in the  dark, and the men have gone out; I have not known whither the  men have gone; pursue ye, hasten after them, for ye overtake  them;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> and she hath caused them to go up on the roof, and hideth  them with the flax wood, which is arranged for her on the roof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And the men have pursued after them the way of the Jordan,  by the fords, and the gate they have shut afterwards, when the  pursuers have gone out after them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And -- before they lie down -- she hath gone up unto them on  the roof,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> and she saith unto the men, `I have known that Jehovah hath  given to you the land, and that your terror hath fallen upon  us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted at  your presence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> `For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the  Red Sea at your presence, in your going out of Egypt, and that  which ye have done to the two kings of the Amorite who [are]  beyond the Jordan; to Sihon and to Og whom ye devoted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And we hear, and melt doth our heart, and there hath not  stood any more spirit in [any] man, from your presence, for  Jehovah your God, He [is] God in the heavens above, and on the  earth beneath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> `And now, swear ye, I pray you, to me by Jehovah -- because  I have done with you kindness -- that ye have done, even ye,  kindness with the house of my father, and have given to me a  true token,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> and have kept alive my father, and my mother, and my  brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and have  delivered our souls from death.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And the men say to her, `Our soul for yours -- to die; if  ye declare not this our matter, then it hath been, in Jehovah's  giving to us this land, that we have done with thee kindness  and truth.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And she causeth them to go down by a rope through the  window, for her house [is] in the side of the wall, and in the  wall she [is] dwelling;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> and she saith to them, `To the mountain go, lest the  pursuers come upon you; and ye have been hidden there three  days till the turning back of the pursuers, and afterwards ye  go on your way.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And the men say unto her, `We are acquitted of this thine  oath which thou hast caused us to swear:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> lo, we are coming into the land, this line of scarlet  thread thou dost bind to the window by which thou hast caused  us to go down, and thy father, and thy mother, and thy  brethren, and all the house of thy father thou dost gather unto  thee, to the house;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> and it hath been, any one who goeth out from the doors of  thy house without, his blood [is] on his head, and we are  innocent; and any one who is with thee in the house, his blood  [is] on our head, if a hand is on him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> and if thou declare this our matter, then we have been  acquitted from thine oath which thou hast caused us to swear.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And she saith, `According unto your words, so it [is];' and  she sendeth them away, and they go; and she bindeth the scarlet  line to the window.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> And they go, and come in to the mountain, and abide there  three days until the pursuers have turned back; and the  pursuers seek in all the way, and have not found.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> And the two men turn back, and come down from the hill, and  pass over, and come in unto Joshua son of Nun, and recount to  him all that hath come upon them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> and they say unto Joshua, `Surely Jehovah hath given into  our hand all the land; and also, all the inhabitants of the  land have melted at our presence.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and they journey  from Shittim, and come in unto the Jordan, he and all the sons  of Israel, and they lodge there before they pass over.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And it cometh to pass, at the end of three days, that the  authorities pass over into the midst of the camp,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> and command the people, saying, `When ye see the ark of the  covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests, the Levites,  bearing it, then ye journey from your place, and have gone  after it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> only, a distance is between you and it, about two thousand  cubits by measure; ye do not come near unto it, so that ye know  the way in which ye go, for ye have not passed over in the way  heretofore.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And Joshua saith unto the people, `Sanctify yourselves, for  to-morrow doth Jehovah do in your midst wonders.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And Joshua speaketh unto the priests, saying, `Take up the  ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people;' and they  take up the ark of the covenant, and go before the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `This day I begin to make  thee great in the eyes of all Israel, so that they know that as  I was with Moses I am with thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> and thou, thou dost command the priests bearing the ark of  the covenant, saying, When ye come unto the extremity of the  waters of the Jordan -- in the Jordan ye stand.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And Joshua saith unto the sons of Israel, `Come nigh hither,  and hear the words of Jehovah your God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> and Joshua saith, `By this ye know that the living God [is]  in your midst, and He doth certainly dispossess from before you  the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the  Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the  Jebusite:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> lo, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is  passing over before you into Jordan;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> and now, take for you twelve men out of the tribes of  Israel, one man -- one man for a tribe;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> and it hath been, at the resting of the soles of the feet  of the priests bearing the ark of Jehovah, Lord of all the  earth, in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan  are cut off -- the waters which are coming down from above --  and they stand -- one heap.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And it cometh to pass, in the journeying of the people from  their tents to pass over the Jordan, and of the priests bearing  the ark of the covenant before the people,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> and at those bearing the ark coming in unto the Jordan, and  the feet of the priests bearing the ark have been dipped in the  extremity of the waters (and the Jordan is full over all its  banks all the days of harvest) --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> that the waters stand; those coming down from above have  risen -- one heap, very far above Adam the city, which [is] at  the side of Zaretan; and those going down by the sea of the  plain, the Salt Sea, have been completely cut off; and the  people have passed through over-against Jericho;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah  stand on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan -- established,  and all Israel are passing over on dry ground till that all the  nation hath completed to pass over the Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And it cometh to pass, when all the nation hath completed to  pass over the Jordan, that Jehovah speaketh unto Joshua,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> `Take for you out of the people twelve men, one man -- one  man out of a tribe;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> and command ye them, saying, Take up for you from this  [place], from the midst of the Jordan, from the established  standing-place of the feet of the priests, twelve stones, and  ye have removed them over with you, and placed them in the  lodging-place in which ye lodge to-night.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And Joshua calleth unto the twelve men whom he prepared out  of the sons of Israel, one man -- one man out of a tribe;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> and Joshua saith to them, `Pass over before the ark of  Jehovah your God unto the midst of the Jordan and lift up for  you each, one stone on his shoulder, according to the number of  the tribes of the sons of Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> so that this is a sign in your midst, when your children ask  hereafter, saying, What [are] these stones to you?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> that ye have said to them, Because the waters of the Jordan  were cut off, at the presence of the ark of the covenant of  Jehovah; in its passing over into the Jordan were the waters  of the Jordan cut off; and these stones have been for a  memorial to the sons of Israel -- to the age.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And the sons of Israel do so as Joshua commanded, and take  up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah  hath spoken unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes  of the sons of Israel, and remove them over with them unto the  lodging-place, and place them there,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> even the twelve stones hath Joshua raised up out of the  midst of the Jordan, the place of the standing of the feet of  the priests bearing the ark of the covenant, and they are there  unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And the priests bearing the ark are standing in the midst  of the Jordan till the completion of the whole thing which  Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to  all that Moses commanded Joshua, and the people haste and pass  over.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And it cometh to pass when all the people have completed to  pass over, that the ark of Jehovah passeth over, and the  priests, in the presence of the people;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> and the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half  of the tribe of Manasseh, pass over, by fifties, before the  sons of Israel, as Moses had spoken unto them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> about forty thousand, armed ones of the host, passed over  before Jehovah for battle, unto the plains of Jericho.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> On that day hath Jehovah made Joshua great in the eyes of  all Israel, and they reverence him, as they reverenced Moses,  all days of his life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And Jehovah speaketh unto Joshua, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> `Command the priests bearing the ark of the testimony, and  they come up out of the Jordan.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> And Joshua commandeth the priests, saying, `Come ye up out  of the Jordan.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And it cometh to pass, in the coming up of the priests  bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the midst of  the Jordan -- the soles of the feet of the priests have been  drawn up into the dry ground -- and the waters of the Jordan  turn back to their place, and go as heretofore over all its  banks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And the people have come up out of the Jordan on the tenth  of the first month, and encamp in Gilgal, in the extremity east  of Jericho;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> and these twelve stones, which they have taken out of the  Jordan, hath Joshua raised up in Gilgal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> And he speaketh unto the sons of Israel, saying, `When your  sons ask their fathers hereafter, saying, What [are] these  stones?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> then ye have caused your sons to know, saying, On dry land  Israel passed over this Jordan;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> because Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan  at your presence, till your passing over, as Jehovah your God  did to the Red Sea which He dried up at our presence till our  passing over;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> so that all the people of the land do know the hand of  Jehovah that it [is] strong, so that ye have reverenced Jehovah  your God all the days.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And it cometh to pass when all the kings of the Amorite  which [are] beyond the Jordan, towards the sea, and all the  kings of the Canaanite which [are] by the sea, hear how that  Jehovah hath dried up the waters of the Jordan at the presence  of the sons of Israel till their passing over, that their heart  is melted, and there hath not been in them any more spirit  because of the presence of the sons of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> At that time said Jehovah unto Joshua, `Make for thee knives  of flint, and turn back, circumcise the sons of Israel a second  time;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> and Joshua maketh for him knives of flint, and circumciseth  the sons of Israel at the height of the foreskins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And this [is] the thing [for] which Joshua circumciseth  [them]: all the people who are coming out of Egypt, who are males,  all the men of war have died in the wilderness, in the way, in  their coming out of Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> for all the people who are coming out were circumcised, and  all the people who [are] born in the wilderness, in the way, in  their coming out from Egypt, they have not circumcised;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> for forty years have the sons of Israel gone in the  wilderness, till all the nation of the men of war who are  coming out of Egypt, who hearkened not to the voice of Jehovah,  to whom Jehovah hath sworn not to show them the land which  Jehovah sware to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing  with milk and honey, are consumed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> and their sons He raised up in their stead, them hath Joshua  circumcised, for they have been uncircumcised, for they have  not circumcised them in the way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And it cometh to pass when all the nation have completed to  be circumcised, that they abide in their places in the camp  till their recovering;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> and Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `To-day I have rolled the  reproach of Egypt from off you;' and [one] calleth the name of  that place Gilgal unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And the sons of Israel encamp in Gilgal, and make the  passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the  plains of Jericho;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> and they eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow of  the passover, unleavened things and roasted [corn], in this  self-same day;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> and the manna doth cease on the morrow in their eating of  the old corn of the land, and there hath been no more manna to  the sons of Israel, and they eat of the increase of the land of  Canaan in that year.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> And it cometh to pass in Joshua's being by Jericho, that he  lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and lo, one standing  over-against him, and his drawn sword in his hand, and Joshua  goeth unto him, and saith to him, `Art thou for us or for our  adversaries?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> And He saith, `No, for I [am] Prince of Jehovah's host; now  I have come;' and Joshua falleth on his face to the earth, and  doth obeisance, and saith to Him, `What is my Lord speaking  unto His servant?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> And the Prince of Jehovah's host saith unto Joshua, `Cast  off thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place on which thou art  standing is holy;' and Joshua doth so;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> (And Jericho shutteth itself up, and is shut up, because of  the presence of the sons of Israel -- none going out, and none  coming in;)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `See, I have given into thy  hand Jericho and its king -- mighty ones of valour,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> and ye have compassed the city -- all the men of battle --  going round the city once; thus thou dost six days;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> and seven priests do bear seven trumpets of the jubilee  before the ark, and on the seventh day ye compass the city  seven times, and the priests blow with the trumpets,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> and it hath been, in the prolongation of the horn of the  jubilee, in your hearing the voice of the trumpet,  all the people shout -- a great shout, and the wall of the  city hath fallen under it, and the people have gone up, each  over-against him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> And Joshua son of Nun calleth unto the priests, and saith  unto them, `Bear ye the ark of the covenant, and seven priests  do bear seven trumpets of the jubilee before the ark of  Jehovah;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> and He said unto the people, `Pass over, and compass the  city, and he who is armed doth pass over before the ark of  Jehovah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And it cometh to pass, when Joshua speaketh unto the people,  that the seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the jubilee  before Jehovah have passed over and blown with the trumpets,  and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is going after them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> and he who is armed is going before the priests blowing the  trumpets, and he who is gathering up is going after the ark,  going on and blowing with the trumpets;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> and the people hath Joshua commanded, saying, `Ye do not  shout, nor cause your voice to be heard, nor doth there go out  from your mouth a word, till the day of my saying unto you,  Shout ye -- then ye have shouted.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> And the ark of Jehovah doth compass the city, going round  once, and they come into the camp, and lodge in the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and the priests  bear the ark of Jehovah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the jubilee  before the ark of Jehovah are walking, going on, and they have  blown with the trumpets -- and he who is armed is going before  them, and he who is gathering up is going behind  the ark of Jehovah -- going on and blowing with the trumpets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> And they compass the city on the second day once, and turn  back to the camp; thus they have done six days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> And it cometh to pass, on the seventh day, that they rise  early, at the ascending of the dawn, and compass the city,  according to this manner, seven times; (only, on that day they  have compassed the city seven times);</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> and it cometh to pass, at the seventh time, the priests  have blown with the trumpets, and Joshua saith unto the people,  `Shout ye, for Jehovah hath given to you the city;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> and the city hath been devoted, it and all that [is] in it,  to Jehovah; only Rahab the harlot doth live, she and all who  [are] with her in the house, for she hid the messengers whom we  sent;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> and surely ye have kept from the devoted thing, lest ye  devote [yourselves], and have taken from the devoted thing, and  have made the camp of Israel become a devoted thing, and have  troubled it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> and all the silver and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,  holy they [are] to Jehovah; into the treasury of Jehovah they  come.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> And the people shout, and blow with the trumpets, and it  cometh to pass when the people hear the voice of the trumpet,  that the people shout -- a great shout, and the wall falleth  under it, and the people goeth up into the city, each  over-against him, and they capture the city;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> and they devote all that [is] in the city, from man even  unto woman, from young even unto aged, even unto ox, and sheep,  and ass, by the mouth of the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> And to the two men who are spying the land Joshua said, `Go  into the house of the woman, the harlot, and bring out thence  the woman, and all whom she hath, as ye have sworn to her.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> And the young man, the spies, go in and bring out Rahab,  and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all whom  she hath; yea, all her families they have brought out, and  place them at the outside of the camp of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> And the city they have burnt with fire, and all that [is]  in it; only, the silver and the gold, and the vessels of brass,  and of iron, they have given [to] the treasury of the house of  Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> and Rahab the harlot, and the house of her father, and all  whom she hath, hath Joshua kept alive; and she dwelleth in the  midst of Israel unto this day, for she hid the messengers whom  Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:26">6:26</a> And Joshua adjureth [them] at that time, saying, `Cursed  [is] the man before Jehovah who raiseth up and hath built this  city, [even] Jericho; in his first-born he doth lay its  foundation, and in his youngest he doth set up its doors;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:27">6:27</a> and Jehovah is with Joshua, and his fame is in all the  land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And the sons of Israel commit a trespass in the devoted  thing, and Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of  the tribe of Judah, taketh of the devoted thing, and the anger  of Jehovah burneth against the sons of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> And Joshua sendeth men from Jericho to Ai, which [is] near  Beth-Aven, on the east of Bethel, and speaketh unto them,  saying, `Go up and spy the land;' and the men go up and spy  Ai,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> and they turn back unto Joshua, and say unto him, `Let not  all the people go up; let about two thousand men, or about  three thousand men, go up, and they smite Ai; cause not all  the people to labour thither; for they [are] few.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> And there go up of the people thither about three thousand  men, and they flee before the men of Ai,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> and the men of Ai smite of them about thirty and six men,  and pursue them before the gate unto Shebarim, and they smite  them in Morad; and the heart of the people is melted, and becometh  water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> And Joshua rendeth his garments, and falleth on his face to  the earth before the ark of Jehovah till the evening, he and  the elders of Israel, and they cause dust to go up on their  head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> And Joshua saith, `Ah, Lord Jehovah, why hast Thou at all  caused this people to pass over the Jordan, to give us into the  hand of the Amorite to destroy us? -- and oh that we had been  willing -- and we dwell beyond the Jordan!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> Oh, Lord, what do I say, after that Israel hath turned the  neck before its enemies?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> and the Canaanite and all the inhabitants of the land do  hear, and have come round against us, and cut off our name out  of the earth; and what dost Thou do for Thy great name?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `Rise for thee, why [is]  this? -- thou [art] falling on thy face?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> Israel hath sinned, and also they have transgressed My  covenant which I commanded them, and also taken of the devoted  thing, and also stolen, and also deceived, and also put [it]  among their vessels,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> and the sons of Israel have not been able to stand before  their enemies; the neck they turn before their enemies, for  they have become a devoted thing; I add not to be with you --  if ye destroy not the devoted thing out of your midst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> `Rise, sanctify the people, and thou hast said, Sanctify  yourselves for to-morrow; for thus said Jehovah, God of  Israel, A devoted thing [is] in thy midst, O Israel, thou art  not able to stand before thine enemies till your turning aside  of the devoted thing out of your midst;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> and ye have been brought near in the morning by your  tribes, and it hath been, the tribe which Jehovah doth capture  doth draw near by families, and the family which Jehovah doth  capture doth draw near by households, and the household which  Jehovah doth capture doth draw near by men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> and it hath been, he who is captured with the devoted thing  is burnt with fire, he and all that he hath, because he hath  transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he hath done  folly in Israel.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and bringeth Israel  near by its tribes, and the tribe of Judah is captured;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> and he bringeth near the family of Judah, and he captureth  the family of the Zarhite; and he bringeth near the family of  the Zarhite by men, and Zabdi is captured;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> and he bringeth near his household by men, and Achan -- son  of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah --  is captured.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> And Joshua saith unto Achan, `My son, put, I pray thee,  honour on Jehovah, God of Israel, and give to Him thanks, and  declare, I pray thee, to me, what thou hast done -- hide not  from me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> And Achan answereth Joshua, and saith, `Truly I have sinned  against Jehovah, God of Israel, and thus and thus I have done;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> and I see among the spoil a goodly robe of Shinar, and two  hundred shekels of silver, and one wedge of gold, whose weight  [is] fifty shekels, and I desire them, and take them; and lo,  they [are] hid in the earth, in the midst of my tent, and the  silver under it.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> And Joshua sendeth messengers, and they run unto the tent,  and lo, it is hidden in his tent, and the silver under it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> and they take them out of the midst of the tent, and bring  them in unto Joshua, and unto all the sons of Israel, and pour  them out before Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> And Joshua taketh Achan son of Zerah, and the silver, and  the robe, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his  daughters, and his ox, and his ass, and his flock, and his  tent, and all that he hath, and all Israel with him, and they  cause them to go up the valley of Achor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> And Joshua saith, `What! thou hast troubled us! -- Jehovah  doth trouble thee this day;' and all Israel cast stones at  him, and they burn them with fire, and they stone them with  stones,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:26">7:26</a> and they raise up over him a great heap of stones unto this  day, and Jehovah turneth back from the heat of His anger,  therefore hath [one] called the name of that place `Valley of  Achor' till this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `Fear not, nor be affrighted,  take with thee all the people of war, and rise, go up to Ai;  see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people,  and his city, and his land,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> and thou hast done to Ai and to her king as thou hast done  to Jericho and to her king; only, its spoil and its cattle ye  spoil for yourselves; set for thee an ambush for the city at  its rear.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And Joshua riseth, and all the people of war, to go up to  Ai, and Joshua chooseth thirty thousand men, mighty ones of  valour, and sendeth them away by night,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> and commandeth them, saying, `See, ye are liers in wait  against the city, at the rear of the city, ye go not very far  off from the city, and all of you have been prepared,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> and I and all the people who [are] with me draw near unto  the city, and it hath come to pass when they come out to meet  us as at the first, and we have fled before them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> and they have come out after us till we have drawn them out  of the city, for they say, They are fleeing before us as at the  first, and we have fled before them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> and ye rise from the ambush, and have occupied the city, and  Jehovah your God hath given it into your hand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> and it hath been, when ye capture the city, ye burn the city  with fire, according to the word of Jehovah ye do, see, I have  commanded you.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> And Joshua sendeth them away, and they go unto the ambush,  and abide between Bethel and Ai, on the west of Ai; and Joshua  lodgeth on that night in the midst of the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and inspecteth the  people, and goeth up, he and the elders of Israel, before the  people to Ai;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> and all the people of war who [are] with him have gone up,  and draw nigh and come in over-against the city, and encamp on  the north of Ai; and the valley [is] between him and Ai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> And he taketh about five thousand men, and setteth them an  ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west of the city;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> and they set the people, all the camp which [is] on the  north of the city, and its rear on the west of the city, and  Joshua goeth on that night into the midst of the valley.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And it cometh to pass, when the king of Ai seeth [it], that  hasten, and rise early, and go out do the men of the city to  meet Israel for battle, he and all his people, at the appointed  season, at the front of the plain, and he hath not known that  an ambush [is] against him, on the rear of the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And Joshua and all Israel [seem] stricken before them, and  flee the way of the wilderness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> and all the people who [are] in the city are called to  pursue after them, and they pursue after Joshua, and are drawn  away out of the city,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> and there hath not been left a man in Ai and Bethel who  hath not gone out after Israel, and they leave the city open,  and pursue after Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `Stretch out with the  javelin which [is] in thy hand towards Ai, for into thy hand I  give it;' and Joshua stretcheth out with the javelin which [is]  in his hand toward the city,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> and the ambush hath risen [with] haste, out of its place,  and they run at the stretching out of his hand, and go into the  city, and capture it, and hasten, and burn the city with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> And the men of Ai look behind them, and see, and lo, the  smoke of the city hath gone up unto the heavens, and there hath  not been in them power to flee hither and thither -- and the  people who are fleeing to the wilderness have turned against  the pursuer, --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> and Joshua and all Israel have seen that the ambush hath  captured the city, and that the smoke of the city hath gone up,  and they turn back and smite the men of Ai;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> and these have come out from the city to meet them, and  they are in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on  that, and they smite them till he hath not left to them a  remnant and escaped one;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:23">8:23</a> and the king of Ai they caught alive, and bring him near  unto Joshua.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:24">8:24</a> And it cometh to pass, at Israel's finishing to slay all  the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which  they pursued them (and they fall all of them by the mouth of  the sword till their consumption), that all Israel turn back to  Ai, and smite it by the mouth of the sword;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:25">8:25</a> and all who fall during the day, of men and of women, are  twelve thousand -- all men of Ai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:26">8:26</a> And Joshua hath not brought back his hand which he  stretched out with the javelin till that he hath devoted all  the inhabitants of Ai;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:27">8:27</a> only, the cattle and the spoil of that city have Israel  spoiled for themselves, according to the word of Jehovah which  He commanded Joshua.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:28">8:28</a> And Joshua burneth Ai, and maketh it a heap age-during -- a  desolation unto this day;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:29">8:29</a> and the king of Ai he hath hanged on the tree till  even-time, and at the going in of the sun hath Joshua  commanded, and they take down his carcase from the tree, and  cast it unto the opening of the gate of the city, and raise  over it a great heap of stones till this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:30">8:30</a> Then doth Joshua build an altar to Jehovah, God of Israel,  in mount Ebal,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:31">8:31</a> as Moses, servant of Jehovah, commanded the sons of Israel,  as it is written in the book of the law of Moses -- an altar of  whole stones, over which he hath not waved iron -- and they  cause to go up upon it burnt-offerings to Jehovah, and  sacrifice peace-offerings;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:32">8:32</a> and he writeth there on the stones the copy of the law of  Moses, which he hath written in the presence of the sons of  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:33">8:33</a> And all Israel, and its elders, and authorities, and its  judges, are standing on this side and on that of the ark,  over-against the priests, the Levites, bearing the ark of the  covenant of Jehovah, as well the sojourner as the native, half  of them over-against mount Gerizim, and the half of them  over-against mount Ebal, as Moses servant of Jehovah commanded  to bless the people of Israel at the first.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:34">8:34</a> And afterwards he hath proclaimed all the words of the law,  the blessing and the reviling, according to all that is written  in the book of the law;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:35">8:35</a> there hath not been a thing of all that Moses commanded  which Joshua hath not proclaimed before all the assembly of  Israel, and the women, and the infants, and the sojourner who  is going in their midst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And it cometh to pass, when all the kings who [are] beyond  the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the low-country, and in  every haven of the great sea, over-against Lebanon, the  Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the  Hivite, and the Jebusite, hear --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> that they gather themselves together to fight with Joshua,  and with Israel -- one mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And the inhabitants of Gibeon have heard that which Joshua  hath done to Jericho and to Ai,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> and they work, even they, with subtilty, and go, and feign  to be ambassadors, and take old sacks for their asses, and  wine-bottles, old, and rent, and bound up,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> and sandals, old and patched, on their feet, and old  garments upon them, and all the bread of their provision is dry  -- it was crumbs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> And they go unto Joshua, unto the camp at Gilgal, and say  unto him, and unto the men of Israel, `From a land far off we  have come, and now, make with us a covenant;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> and the men of Israel say unto the Hivite, `It may be in our  midst ye are dwelling, and how do we make with thee a  covenant?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> and they say unto Joshua, `Thy servants we [are].' And  Joshua saith unto them, `Who [are] ye? and whence come ye?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And they say unto him, `From a land very far off have thy  servants come, for the name of Jehovah thy God, for we have  heard His fame, and all that He hath done in Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> and all that He hath done to the two kings of the Amorite  who [are] beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to  Og king of Bashan, who [is] in Ashtaroth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> `And our elders, and all the inhabitants of our land speak  unto us, saying, Take in your hand provision for the way, and  go to meet them, and ye have said unto them, Your servants we  [are], and now, make with us a covenant;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> this our bread -- hot we provided ourselves with it out of  our houses, on the day of our coming out to go unto you, and  now, lo, it is dry, and hath been crumbs;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> and these [are] the wine-bottles which we filled, new, and  lo, they have rent; and these, our garments and our sandals,  have become old, from the exceeding greatness of the way.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> And the men take of their provision, and the mouth of  Jehovah have not asked;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> and Joshua maketh with them peace, and maketh with them a  covenant, to keep them alive; and swear to them do the princes  of the company.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> And it cometh to pass, at the end of three days after that  they have made with them a covenant, that they hear that they  [are] their neighbours -- that in their midst they are  dwelling.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> And the sons of Israel journey and come in unto their  cities on the third day -- and their cities [are] Gibeon, and  Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-Jearim --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> and the sons of Israel have not smitten them, for sworn to  them have the princes of the company by Jehovah God of Israel,  and all the company murmur against the princes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> And all the princes say unto all the company, `We -- we  have sworn to them by Jehovah, God of Israel; and now, we are  not able to come against them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> this we do to them, and have kept them alive, and wrath is  not upon us, because of the oath which we have sworn to them.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> And the princes say unto them, `They live, and are hewers  of wood and drawers of water for all the company, as the  princes spake to them.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> And Joshua calleth for them, and speaketh unto them,  saying, `Why have ye deceived us, saying, We are very far from  you, and ye in our midst dwelling?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> and now, cursed are ye, and none of you is cut off [from  being] a servant, even hewers of wood and drawers of water, for  the house of my God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> And they answer Joshua and say, `Because it was certainly  declared to thy servants, that Jehovah thy God commanded Moses  His servant to give to you all the land, and to destroy all the  inhabitants of the land from before you; and we fear greatly  for ourselves because of you, and we do this thing;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> and now, lo, we [are] in thy hand, as [it is] good, and as  [it is] right in thine eyes to do to us -- do.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> And he doth to them so, and delivereth them from the hand  of the sons of Israel, and they have not slain them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> and Joshua maketh them on that day hewers of wood and  drawers of water for the company, and for the altar of Jehovah,  unto this day, at the place which He doth choose.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> And it cometh to pass, when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem  heareth that Joshua hath captured Ai, and doth devote it (as he  had done to Jericho and to her king so he hath done to Ai and  to her king), and that the inhabitants of Gibeon have made  peace with Israel, and are in their midst, --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> that they are greatly afraid, because Gibeon [is] a great  city, as one of the royal cities, and because it [is] greater  than Ai, and all its men -- heroes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> And Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sendeth unto Hoham king  of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king  of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> `Come up unto me, and help me, and we smite Gibeon, for it  hath made peace with Joshua, and with the sons of Israel.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> And five kings of the Amorite (the king of Jerusalem, the  king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the  king of Eglon) are gathered together, and go up, they and all  their camps, and encamp against Gibeon, and fight against it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And the men of Gibeon send unto Joshua, unto the camp at  Gilgal, saying, `Let not thy hand cease from thy servants; come  up unto us [with] haste, and give safety to us, and help us;  for all the kings of the Amorite, dwelling in the hill-country,  have been assembled against us.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> And Joshua goeth up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of  war with him, even all the mighty men of valour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `Be not afraid of them, for  into thy hand I have given them, there doth not stand a man of  them in thy presence.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> And Joshua cometh in unto them suddenly (all the night he  hath gone up from Gilgal),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> and Jehovah doth crush them before Israel, and it smiteth  them -- a great smiting -- at Gibeon, and pursueth them the way  of the ascent of Beth-Horon, and smiteth them unto Azekah, and  unto Makkedah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> And it cometh to pass, in their fleeing from the face of  Israel -- they [are] in the descent of Beth-Horon -- and  Jehovah hath cast upon them great stones out of the heavens,  unto Azekah, and they die; more are they who have died by the  hailstones than they whom the sons of Israel have slain by the  sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> Then speaketh Joshua to Jehovah in the day of Jehovah's  giving up the Amorites before the sons of Israel, and he saith,  before the eyes of Israel, `Sun -- in Gibeon stand still; and  moon -- in the valley of Ajalon;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> and the sun standeth still, and the moon hath stood -- till  the nation taketh vengeance [on] its enemies; is it not written  on the Book of the Upright, `and the sun standeth in the midst  of the heavens, and hath not hasted to go in -- as a perfect  day?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> And there hath not been like that day before it or after  it, for Jehovah's hearkening to the voice of a man; for Jehovah  is fighting for Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> And Joshua turneth back, and all Israel with him, unto the  camp at Gilgal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> And these five kings flee, and are hidden in a cave at  Makkedah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> and it is declared to Joshua, saying, `The five kings have  been found hidden in a cave at Makkedah.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_22:31">22:31</a> And Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest saith unto the sons  of Reuben, and unto the sons of Gad, and unto the sons of  Manasseh, `To-day we have known that Jehovah [is] in our midst,  because ye have not committed against Jehovah this trespass --  then ye have delivered the sons of Israel out of the hand of  Jehovah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:32">22:32</a> And Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,  turn back from the sons of Reuben, and from the sons of Gad,  out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, unto the  sons of Israel, and bring them back word;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:33">22:33</a> and the thing is good in the eyes of the sons of Israel,  and the sons of Israel bless God, and have not said to go up  against them to war, to destroy the land which the sons of  Reuben, and the sons of Gad, are dwelling in.</p>

 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> see, I have caused to fall to you these nations who are  left for an inheritance to your tribes, from the Jordan, (and  all the nations which I cut off), and the great sea, the going  in of the sun.</p>

 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> `And it hath been, as there hath come upon you all the  good thing which Jehovah your God hath spoken unto you, so doth  Jehovah bring upon you the whole of the evil thing, till His  destroying you from off this good ground which Jehovah your God  hath given to you;</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> And Joshua gathereth all the tribes of Israel to Shechem,  and calleth for the elders of Israel, and for its heads, and for  its judges, and for its authorities, and they station themselves  before God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> And Joshua saith unto all the people, `Thus said Jehovah,  God of Israel, Beyond the River have your fathers dwelt of old  -- Terah father of Abraham and father of Nachor -- and they  serve other gods;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> and I take your father Abraham from beyond the River, and  cause him to go through all the land of Canaan, and multiply  his seed, and give to him Isaac.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> And I give to Isaac, Jacob and Esau; and I give to Esau  mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his sons have gone  down to Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> And I send Moses and Aaron, and plague Egypt, as I have  done in its midst, and afterwards I have brought you out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> And I bring out your fathers from Egypt, and ye go into the  sea, and the Egyptians pursue after your fathers, with chariot  and with horsemen, to the Red Sea;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> and they cry unto Jehovah, and He setteth thick darkness  between you and the Egyptians, and bringeth on them the sea,  and covereth them, and your eyes see that which I have done in  Egypt; and ye dwell in a wilderness many days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:8">24:8</a> `And I bring you in unto the land of the Amorite who is  dwelling beyond the Jordan, and they fight with you, and I give  them into your hand, and ye possess their land, and I destroy  them out of your presence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:9">24:9</a> `And Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, riseth and fighteth  against Israel, and sendeth and calleth for Balaam son of Beor,  to revile you,</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:11">24:11</a> `And ye pass over the Jordan, and come in unto Jericho,  and fight against you do the possessors of Jericho -- the  Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite,  and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite -- and I give  them into your hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:12">24:12</a> And I send before you the hornet, and it casteth them out  from your presence -- two kings of the Amorite -- not by thy  sword, nor by thy bow.</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:18">24:18</a> and Jehovah casteth out the whole of the peoples, even the  Amorite inhabiting the land, from our presence; we also do  serve Jehovah, for He [is] our God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:19">24:19</a> And Joshua saith unto the people, `Ye are not able to  serve Jehovah, for a God most holy He [is]; a zealous God He  [is]; He doth not bear with your transgression and with your  sins.</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:21">24:21</a> And the people saith unto Joshua, `No, but Jehovah we do  serve.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:22">24:22</a> And Joshua saith unto the people, `Witnesses ye are  against yourselves, that ye have chosen for you Jehovah to  serve Him (and they say, `Witnesses!')</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:23">24:23</a> and, now, turn aside the gods of the stranger which [are]  in your midst, and incline your heart unto Jehovah, God of  Israel.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:25">24:25</a> And Joshua maketh a covenant with the people on that day,  and layeth on it a statute and an ordinance, in Shechem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:26">24:26</a> And Joshua writeth these words in the Book of the Law of  God, and taketh a great stone, and raiseth it up there under  the oak which [is] in the sanctuary of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:27">24:27</a> And Joshua saith unto all the people, `Lo, this stone is  against us for a witness, for it hath heard all the sayings of  Jehovah which He hath spoken with us, and it hath been against  you for a witness, lest ye lie against your God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:28">24:28</a> And Joshua sendeth the people away, each to his  inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:29">24:29</a> And it cometh to pass, after these things, that Joshua son  of Nun, servant of Jehovah, dieth, a son of a hundred and ten  years,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:30">24:30</a> and they bury him in the border of his inheritance, in  Timnath-Serah, which [is] in the hill-country of Ephraim, on  the north of the hill of Gaash.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:31">24:31</a> And Israel serveth Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all  the days of the elders who prolonged days after Joshua, and who  knew all the work of Jehovah which He did to Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:32">24:32</a> And the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought  up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in the portion of the  field which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor father of  Shechem, with a hundred kesitah; and they are to the sons of  Joseph for an inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:33">24:33</a> And Eleazar son of Aaron died, and they bury him in the  hill of Phinehas his son, which was given to him in the  hill-country of Ephraim. </p>
