 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> In the beginning of God's preparing the heavens and the  earth --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> the earth hath existed waste and void, and darkness [is] on  the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God fluttering on the  face of the waters,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> and God saith, `Let light be;' and light is.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And God seeth the light that [it is] good, and God  separateth between the light and the darkness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> and God calleth to the light `Day,' and to the darkness He  hath called `Night;' and there is an evening, and there is a  morning -- day one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And God saith, `Let an expanse be in the midst of the  waters, and let it be separating between waters and waters.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> And God maketh the expanse, and it separateth between the  waters which [are] under the expanse, and the waters which  [are] above the expanse: and it is so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And God calleth to the expanse `Heavens;' and there is an  evening, and there is a morning -- day second.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And God saith, `Let the waters under the heavens be  collected unto one place, and let the dry land be seen:' and it  is so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And God calleth to the dry land `Earth,' and to the  collection of the waters He hath called `Seas;' and God seeth  that [it is] good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And God saith, `Let the earth yield tender grass, herb  sowing seed, fruit-tree (whose seed [is] in itself) making  fruit after its kind, on the earth:' and it is so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And the earth bringeth forth tender grass, herb sowing seed  after its kind, and tree making fruit (whose seed [is] in  itself) after its kind; and God seeth that [it is] good;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> and there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day  third.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And God saith, `Let luminaries be in the expanse of the  heavens, to make a separation between the day and the night,  then they have been for signs, and for seasons, and for days  and years,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> and they have been for luminaries in the expanse of the  heavens to give light upon the earth:' and it is so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And God maketh the two great luminaries, the great luminary  for the rule of the day, and the small luminary -- and the  stars -- for the rule of the night;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> and God giveth them in the expanse of the heavens to give  light upon the earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> and to rule over day and over night, and to make a  separation between the light and the darkness; and God seeth  that [it is] good;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> and there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day  fourth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> And God saith, `Let the waters teem with the teeming living  creature, and fowl let fly on the earth on the face of the  expanse of the heavens.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> And God prepareth the great monsters, and every living  creature that is creeping, which the waters have teemed with,  after their kind, and every fowl with wing, after its kind, and  God seeth that [it is] good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> And God blesseth them, saying, `Be fruitful, and multiply,  and fill the waters in the seas, and the fowl let multiply in  the earth:'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> and there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day  fifth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> And God saith, `Let the earth bring forth the living  creature after its kind, cattle and creeping thing, and beast  of the earth after its kind:' and it is so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> And God maketh the beast of the earth after its kind, and  the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing of the  ground after its kind, and God seeth that [it is] good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> And God saith, `Let Us make man in Our image, according to  Our likeness, and let them rule over fish of the sea, and over  fowl of the heavens, and over cattle, and over all the earth,  and over every creeping thing that is creeping on the earth.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> And God prepareth the man in His image; in the image of God  He prepared him, a male and a female He prepared them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> And God blesseth them, and God saith to them, `Be fruitful,  and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over  fish of the sea, and over fowl of the heavens, and over every  living thing that is creeping upon the earth.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> And God saith, `Lo, I have given to you every herb sowing  seed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree  in which [is] the fruit of a tree sowing seed, to you it is for  food;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the  heavens, and to every creeping thing on the earth, in which  [is] breath of life, every green herb [is] for food:' and it is  so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:31">1:31</a> And God seeth all that He hath done, and lo, very good; and  there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day the sixth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And the heavens and the earth are completed, and all their  host;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> and God completeth by the seventh day His work which He hath  made, and ceaseth by the seventh day from all His work which He  hath made.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And God blesseth the seventh day, and sanctifieth it, for in  it He hath ceased from all His work which God had prepared for  making.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> These [are] births of the heavens and of the earth in their  being prepared, in the day of Jehovah God's making earth and  heavens;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> and no shrub of the field is yet in the earth, and no herb  of the field yet sprouteth, for Jehovah God hath not rained  upon the earth, and a man there is not to serve the ground,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> and a mist goeth up from the earth, and hath watered the  whole face of the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And Jehovah God formeth the man -- dust from the ground, and  breatheth into his nostrils breath of life, and the man  becometh a living creature.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And Jehovah God planteth a garden in Eden, at the east, and  He setteth there the man whom He hath formed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> and Jehovah God causeth to sprout from the ground every tree  desirable for appearance, and good for food, and the tree of  life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of  good and evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> And a river is going out from Eden to water the garden, and  from thence it is parted, and hath become four chief [rivers];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> the name of the one [is] Pison, it [is] that which is  surrounding the whole land of the Havilah where the gold [is],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> and the gold of that land [is] good, there [is] the bdolach  and the shoham stone;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> and the name of the second river [is] Gibon, it [is] that  which is surrounding the whole land of Cush;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> and the name of the third river [is] Hiddekel, it [is] that  which is going east of Asshur; and the fourth river is Phrat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And Jehovah God taketh the man, and causeth him to rest in  the garden of Eden, to serve it, and to keep it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And Jehovah God layeth a charge on the man, saying, `Of  every tree of the garden eating thou dost eat;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> and of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou dost  not eat of it, for in the day of thine eating of it -- dying  thou dost die.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And Jehovah God saith, `Not good for the man to be alone, I  do make to him an helper -- as his counterpart.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And Jehovah God formeth from the ground every beast of the  field, and every fowl of the heavens, and bringeth in unto the  man, to see what he doth call it; and whatever the man calleth  a living creature, that [is] its name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> And the man calleth names to all the cattle, and to fowl of  the heavens, and to every beast of the field; and to man hath  not been found an helper -- as his counterpart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And Jehovah God causeth a deep sleep to fall upon the man,  and he sleepeth, and He taketh one of his ribs, and closeth up  flesh in its stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> And Jehovah God buildeth up the rib which He hath taken out  of the man into a woman, and bringeth her in unto the man;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> and the man saith, `This [is] the [proper] step! bone of my  bone, and flesh of my flesh!' for this it is called Woman, for  from a man hath this been taken;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> therefore doth a man leave his father and his mother, and  hath cleaved unto his wife, and they have become one flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> And they are both of them naked, the man and his wife, and  they are not ashamed of themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And the serpent hath been subtile above every beast of the  field which Jehovah God hath made, and he saith unto the woman,  `Is it true that God hath said, Ye do not eat of every tree of  the garden?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And the woman saith unto the serpent, `Of the fruit of the  trees of the garden we do eat,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> and of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the  garden God hath said, Ye do not eat of it, nor touch it, lest  ye die.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And the serpent saith unto the woman, `Dying, ye do not die,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> for God doth know that in the day of your eating of it --  your eyes have been opened, and ye have been as God, knowing  good and evil.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And the woman seeth that the tree [is] good for food, and  that it [is] pleasant to the eyes, and the tree is desirable to  make [one] wise, and she taketh of its fruit and eateth, and  giveth also to her husband with her, and he doth eat;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> and the eyes of them both are opened, and they know that  they [are] naked, and they sew fig-leaves, and make to  themselves girdles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And they hear the sound of Jehovah God walking up and down  in the garden at the breeze of the day, and the man and his  wife hide themselves from the face of Jehovah God in the midst  of the trees of the garden.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And Jehovah God calleth unto the man, and saith to him,  `Where [art] thou?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> and he saith, `Thy sound I have heard in the garden, and I  am afraid, for I am naked, and I hide myself.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And He saith, `Who hath declared to thee that thou [art]  naked? of the tree of which I have commanded thee not to eat,  hast thou eaten?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> and the man saith, `The woman whom Thou didst place with me  -- she hath given to me of the tree -- and I do eat.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> And Jehovah God saith to the woman, `What [is] this thou  hast done?' and the woman saith, `The serpent hath caused me to  forget -- and I do eat.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And Jehovah God saith unto the serpent, `Because thou hast  done this, cursed [art] thou above all the cattle, and above  every beast of the field: on thy belly dost thou go, and dust  thou dost eat, all days of thy life;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> and enmity I put between thee and the woman, and between  thy seed and her seed; he doth bruise thee -- the head, and  thou dost bruise him -- the heel.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Unto the woman He said, `Multiplying I multiply thy sorrow  and thy conception, in sorrow dost thou bear children, and  toward thy husband [is] thy desire, and he doth rule over  thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> And to the man He said, `Because thou hast hearkened to the  voice of thy wife, and dost eat of the tree concerning which I  have charged thee, saying, Thou dost not eat of it, cursed [is]  the ground on thine account; in sorrow thou dost eat of it all  days of thy life,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> and thorn and bramble it doth bring forth to thee, and thou  hast eaten the herb of the field;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> by the sweat of thy face thou dost eat bread till thy  return unto the ground, for out of it hast thou been taken, for  dust thou [art], and unto dust thou turnest back.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> And the man calleth his wife's name Eve: for she hath been  mother of all living.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> And Jehovah God doth make to the man and to his wife coats  of skin, and doth clothe them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> And Jehovah God saith, `Lo, the man was as one of Us, as to  the knowledge of good and evil; and now, lest he send forth his  hand, and have taken also of the tree of life, and eaten, and  lived to the age,' --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> Jehovah God sendeth him forth from the garden of Eden to  serve the ground from which he hath been taken;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> yea, he casteth out the man, and causeth to dwell at the  east of the garden of Eden the cherubs and the flame of the  sword which is turning itself round to guard the way of the  tree of life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceiveth and  beareth Cain, and saith, `I have gotten a man by Jehovah;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> and she addeth to bear his brother, even Abel. And Abel is  feeding a flock, and Cain hath been servant of the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And it cometh to pass at the end of days that Cain bringeth  from the fruit of the ground a present to Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> and Abel, he hath brought, he also, from the female  firstlings of his flock, even from their fat ones; and Jehovah  looketh unto Abel and unto his present,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> and unto Cain and unto his present He hath not looked; and  it is very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance is fallen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And Jehovah saith unto Cain, `Why hast thou displeasure? and  why hath thy countenance fallen?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Is there not, if thou dost well, acceptance? and if thou  dost not well, at the opening a sin-offering is crouching, and  unto thee its desire, and thou rulest over it.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And Cain saith unto Abel his brother, [`Let us go into the  field;'] and it cometh to pass in their being in the field,  that Cain riseth up against Abel his brother, and slayeth him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And Jehovah saith unto Cain, `Where [is] Abel thy brother?'  and he saith, `I have not known; my brother's keeper -- I?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And He saith, `What hast thou done? the voice of thy  brother's blood is crying unto Me from the ground;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> and now, cursed [art] thou from the ground, which hath  opened her mouth to receive the blood of thy brother from thy  hand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> when thou tillest the ground, it doth not add to give its  strength to thee -- a wanderer, even a trembling one, thou art  in the earth.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> And Cain saith unto Jehovah, `Greater is my punishment than  to be borne;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> lo, Thou hast driven me to-day from off the face of the  ground, and from Thy face I am hid; and I have been a wanderer,  even a trembling one, in the earth, and it hath been -- every  one finding me doth slay me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And Jehovah saith to him, `Therefore -- of any slayer of  Cain sevenfold it is required;' and Jehovah setteth to Cain a  token that none finding him doth slay him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> And Cain goeth out from before Jehovah, and dwelleth in the  land, moving about east of Eden;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> and Cain knoweth his wife, and she conceiveth, and beareth  Enoch; and he is building a city, and he calleth the name of  the city, according to the name of his son -- Enoch.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And born to Enoch is Irad; and Irad hath begotten Mehujael;  and Mehujael hath begotten Methusael; and Methusael hath  begotten Lamech.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And Lamech taketh to himself two wives, the name of the  one Adah, and the name of the second Zillah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> And Adah beareth Jabal, he hath been father of those  inhabiting tents and purchased possessions;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> and the name of his brother [is] Jubal, he hath been father  of every one handling harp and organ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> And Zillah she also bare Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every  artificer in brass and iron; and a sister of Tubal-Cain [is]  Naamah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> And Lamech saith to his wives: -- `Adah and Zillah, hear my  voice; Wives of Lamech, give ear [to] my saying: For a man I  have slain for my wound, Even a young man for my hurt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> For sevenfold is required for Cain, And for Lamech seventy  and sevenfold.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> And Adam again knoweth his wife, and she beareth a son, and  calleth his name Seth, `for God hath appointed for me another  seed instead of Abel:' for Cain had slain him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> And to Seth, to him also a son hath been born, and he  calleth his name Enos; then a beginning was made of preaching  in the name of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> This [is] an account of the births of Adam: In the day of  God's preparing man, in the likeness of God He hath made him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> a male and a female He hath prepared them, and He blesseth  them, and calleth their name Man, in the day of their being  prepared.</p>

 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> And he presseth on them greatly, and they turn aside unto  him, and come in unto his house; and he maketh for them a  banquet, and hath baked unleavened things; and they do eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> Before they lie down, the men of the city -- men of Sodom  -- have come round about against the house, from young even  unto aged, all the people from the extremity;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> and they call unto Lot and say to him, `Where [are] the men  who have come in unto thee to-night? bring them out unto us,  and we know them.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> And Lot goeth out unto them, to the opening, and the door  hath shut behind him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> and saith, `Do not, I pray you, my brethren, do evil;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> lo, I pray you, I have two daughters, who have not known  any one; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do to  them as [is] good in your eyes; only to these men do not  anything, for therefore have they come in within the shadow of  my roof.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> And they say, `Come nigh hither;' they say also, `This one  hath come in to sojourn, and he certainly judgeth! now, we do  evil to thee more than [to] them;' and they press against the  man, against Lot greatly, and come nigh to break the door.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> And the men put forth their hand, and bring in Lot unto  them, into the house, and have shut the door;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> and the men who [are] at the opening of the house they  have smitten with blindness, from small even unto great, and  they weary themselves to find the opening.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> And the men say unto Lot, `Whom hast thou here still?  son-in-law, thy sons also, and thy daughters, and all whom thou  hast in the city, bring out from this place;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> for we are destroying this place, for their cry hath been  great [before] the face of Jehovah, and Jehovah doth send us to  destroy it.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> And Lot goeth out, and speaketh unto his sons-in-law,  those taking his daughters, and saith, `Rise, go out from this  place, for Jehovah is destroying the city;' and he is as [one]  mocking in the eyes of his sons-in-law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> And when the dawn hath ascended, then the messengers press  upon Lot, saying, `Rise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters  who are found present, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of  the city.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:16">19:16</a> And he lingereth, and the men lay hold on his hand, and on  the hand of his wife, and on the hand of his two daughters,  through the mercy of Jehovah unto him, and they bring him out,  and cause him to rest without the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:17">19:17</a> And it cometh to pass when he hath brought them out  without, that he saith, `Escape for thy life; look not  expectingly behind thee, nor stand thou in all the circuit; to  the mountain escape, lest thou be consumed.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:18">19:18</a> And Lot saith unto them, `Not [so], I pray thee, my lord;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:19">19:19</a> lo, I pray thee, thy servant hath found grace in thine  eyes, and thou dost make great thy kindness which thou hast  done with me by saving my life, and I am unable to escape to  the mountain, lest the evil cleave [to] me, and I have died;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:20">19:20</a> lo, I pray thee, this city [is] near to flee thither, and  it [is] little; let me escape, I pray thee, thither, (is it not  little?) and my soul doth live.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:21">19:21</a> And he saith unto him, `Lo, I have accepted thy face also  for this thing, without overthrowing the city [for] which thou  hast spoken;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:22">19:22</a> haste, escape thither, for I am not able to do anything  till thine entering thither;' therefore hath he calleth the  name of the city Zoar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:23">19:23</a> The sun hath gone out on the earth, and Lot hath entered  into Zoar,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:24">19:24</a> and Jehovah hath rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah  brimstone and fire from Jehovah, from the heavens;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:25">19:25</a> and He overthroweth these cities, and all the circuit, and  all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which is shooting  up from the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:26">19:26</a> And his wife looketh expectingly from behind him, and she  is -- a pillar of salt!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:27">19:27</a> And Abraham riseth early in the morning, unto the place  where he hath stood [before] the face of Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:28">19:28</a> and he looketh on the face of Sodom and Gomorrah, and on  all the face of the land of the circuit, and seeth, and lo, the  smoke of the land went up as smoke of the furnace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:29">19:29</a> And it cometh to pass, in God's destroying the cities of  the circuit, that God remembereth Abraham, and sendeth Lot out  of the midst of the overthrow in the overthrowing of the cities  in which Lot dwelt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:30">19:30</a> And Lot goeth up out of Zoar, and dwelleth in the  mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he hath been  afraid of dwelling in Zoar, and he dwelleth in a cave, he and  his two daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:31">19:31</a> And the first-born saith unto the younger, `Our father  [is] old, and a man there is not in the earth to come in unto  us, as [is] the way of all the earth;</p>

 <p><a name="an_19:33">19:33</a> And they cause their father to drink wine on that night;  and the first-born goeth in, and lieth with her father, and he  hath not known in her lying down, or in her rising up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:34">19:34</a> And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that the first-born  saith unto the younger, `Lo, I have lain yesterday-night with  my father: we cause him to drink wine also to-night, and go  thou in, lie with him, and we preserve from our father -- a  seed.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:35">19:35</a> And they cause their father to drink wine on that night  also, and the younger riseth and lieth with him, and he hath  not known in her lying down, or in her rising up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:36">19:36</a> And the two daughters of Lot conceive from their father,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:37">19:37</a> and the first-born beareth a son, and calleth his name  Moab; he [is] father of Moab unto this day;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:38">19:38</a> as to the younger, she also hath born a son, and calleth  his name Ben-Ammi: he [is] father of the Beni-Ammon unto this  day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> And Abraham journeyeth from thence toward the land of the  south, and dwelleth between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourneth in  Gerar;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> and Abraham saith concerning Sarah his wife, `She is my  sister;' and Abimelech king of Gerar sendeth and taketh Sarah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> And God cometh in unto Abimelech in a dream of the night,  and saith to him, `Lo, thou [art] a dead man, because of the  woman whom thou hast taken -- and she married to a husband.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> And Abimelech hath not drawn near unto her, and he saith,  `Lord, also a righteous nation dost thou slay?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> hath not he himself said to me, She [is] my sister! and  she, even she herself, said, He [is] my brother; in the  integrity of my heart, and in the innocency of my hands, I have  done this.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> And God saith unto him in the dream, `Yea, I -- I have  known that in the integrity of thy heart thou hast done this,  and I withhold thee, even I, from sinning against Me, therefore  I have not suffered thee to come against her;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> and now send back the man's wife, for he [is] inspired, and  he doth pray for thee, and live thou; and if thou do not send  back, know that dying thou dost die, thou, and all that thou  hast.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> And Abimelech riseth early in the morning, and calleth for  all his servants, and speaketh all these words in their ears;  and the men fear exceedingly;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> and Abimelech calleth for Abraham, and saith to him, `What  hast thou done to us? and what have I sinned against thee, that  thou hast brought upon me, and upon my kingdom, a great sin?  works which are not done thou hast done with me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> Abimelech also saith unto Abraham, `What hast thou seen  that thou hast done this thing?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> And Abraham saith, `Because I said, `Surely the fear of  God is not in this place, and they have slain me for the sake  of my wife;</p>

 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> and it cometh to pass, when God hath caused me to wander  from my father's house, that I say to her, This [is] thy  kindness which thou dost with me: at every place whither we  come, say of me, He [is] my brother.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> And Abimelech taketh sheep and oxen, and servants and  handmaids, and giveth to Abraham, and sendeth back to him Sarah  his wife;</p>

 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> And Abraham prayeth unto God, and God healeth Abimelech  and his wife, and his handmaids, and they bear:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> for Jehovah restraining had restrained every womb of the  house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> And Jehovah hath looked after Sarah as He hath said, and  Jehovah doth to Sarah as He hath spoken;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> and Sarah conceiveth, and beareth a son to Abraham, to his  old age, at the appointed time that God hath spoken of with  him;</p>

 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> She saith also, `Who hath said to Abraham, Sarah hath  suckled sons, that I have born a son for his old age?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> And the lad groweth, and is weaned, and Abraham maketh a  great banquet in the day of Isaac's being weaned;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> and Sarah seeth the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she  hath borne to Abraham, mocking,</p>

 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> and the water is consumed from the bottle, and she placeth  the lad under one of the shrubs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> And she goeth and sitteth by herself over-against, afar  off, about a bow-shot, for she said, `Let me not look on the  death of the lad;' and she sitteth over-against, and lifteth up  her voice, and weepeth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> And God heareth the voice of the youth; and the messenger  of God calleth unto Hagar from the heavens, and saith to her,  `What to thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath hearkened unto the  voice of the youth where he [is];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> rise, lift up the youth, and lay hold on him with thy  hand, for for a great nation I set him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> And God openeth her eyes, and she seeth a well of water,  and she goeth and filleth the bottle [with] water, and causeth  the youth to drink;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> and God is with the youth, and he groweth, and dwelleth in  the wilderness, and is an archer;</p>

 <p><a name="an_30:14">30:14</a> And Reuben goeth in the days of wheat-harvest, and findeth  love-apples in the field, and bringeth them in unto Leah, his  mother, and Rachel saith unto Leah, `Give to me, I pray thee,  of the love-apples of thy son.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:15">30:15</a> And she saith to her, `Is thy taking my husband a little  thing, that thou hast taken also the love-apples of my son?'  and Rachel saith, `Therefore doth he lie with thee to-night,  for thy son's love-apples.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:16">30:16</a> And Jacob cometh in from the field at evening; and Leah  goeth to meet him, and saith, `Unto me dost thou come in, for  hiring I have hired thee with my son's love-apples;' and he  lieth with her during that night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:17">30:17</a> And God hearkeneth unto Leah, and she conceiveth, and  beareth to Jacob a son, a fifth,</p>

 <p><a name="an_30:31">30:31</a> And he saith, `What do I give to thee?' And Jacob saith,  `Thou dost not give me anything; if thou do for me this thing,  I turn back; I have delight; thy flock I watch;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:32">30:32</a> I pass through all thy flock to-day to turn aside from  thence every sheep speckled and spotted, and every brown sheep  among the lambs, and speckled and spotted among the goats --  and it hath been my hire;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:33">30:33</a> and my righteousness hath answered for me in the day to  come, when it cometh in for my hire before thy face; -- every  one which is not speckled and spotted among [my] goats, and  brown among [my] lambs -- it is stolen with me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:34">30:34</a> And Laban saith, `Lo, O that it were according to thy  word;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:35">30:35</a> and he turneth aside during that day the ring-straked and  the spotted he-goats, and all the speckled and the spotted  she-goats, every one that [hath] white in it, and every brown  one among the lambs, and he giveth into the hand of his sons,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:36">30:36</a> and setteth a journey of three days between himself and  Jacob; and Jacob is feeding the rest of the flock of Laban.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:37">30:37</a> And Jacob taketh to himself a rod of fresh poplar, and of  the hazel and chesnut, and doth peel in them white peelings,  making bare the white that [is] on the rods,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:38">30:38</a> and setteth up the rods which he hath peeled in the  gutters in the watering troughs (when the flock cometh in to  drink), over-against the flock, that they may conceive in their  coming in to drink;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:39">30:39</a> and the flocks conceive at the rods, and the flock beareth  ring-straked, speckled, and spotted ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:40">30:40</a> And the lambs hath Jacob parted, and he putteth the face  of the flock towards the ring-straked, also all the brown in  the flock of Laban, and he setteth his own droves by  themselves, and hath not set them near Laban's flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:41">30:41</a> And it hath come to pass whenever the strong ones of the  flock conceive, that Jacob set the rods before the eyes of the  flock in the gutters, to cause them to conceive by the rods,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:42">30:42</a> and when the flock is feeble, he doth not set [them]; and  the feeble ones have been Laban's, and the strong ones Jacob's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:43">30:43</a> And the man increaseth very exceedingly, and hath many  flocks, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and  asses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> And he heareth the words of Laban's sons, saying, `Jacob  hath taken all that our father hath; yea, from that which our  father hath, he hath made all this honour;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:2">31:2</a> and Jacob seeth the face of Laban, and lo, it is not with  him as heretofore.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:3">31:3</a> And Jehovah saith unto Jacob, `Turn back unto the land of  thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I am with thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:4">31:4</a> And Jacob sendeth and calleth for Rachel and for Leah to  the field unto his flock;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> and saith to them, `I am beholding your father's face --  that it is not towards me as heretofore, and the God of my  father hath been with me,</p>

 <p><a name="an_31:10">31:10</a> `And it cometh to pass at the time of the flock  conceiving, that I lift up mine eyes and see in a dream, and  lo, the he-goats, which are going up on the flock, [are]  ring-straked, speckled, and grisled;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:11">31:11</a> and the messenger of God saith unto me in the dream,  Jacob, and I say, Here [am] I.</p>

 <p><a name="an_31:17">31:17</a> And Jacob riseth, and lifteth up his sons and his wives on  the camels,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:18">31:18</a> and leadeth all his cattle, and all his substance which he  hath acquired, the cattle of his getting, which he hath  acquired in Padan-Aram, to go unto Isaac his father, to the  land of Canaan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:19">31:19</a> And Laban hath gone to shear his flock, and Rachel  stealeth the teraphim which her father hath;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:20">31:20</a> and Jacob deceiveth the heart of Laban the Aramaean,  because he hath not declared to him that he is fleeing;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:21">31:21</a> and he fleeth, he and all that he hath, and riseth, and  passeth over the River, and setteth his face [toward] the mount  of Gilead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:22">31:22</a> And it is told to Laban on the third day that Jacob hath  fled,</p>

 <p><a name="an_33:5">33:5</a> and he lifteth up his eyes, and seeth the women and the  children, and saith, `What [are] these to thee?' And he saith,  `The children with whom God hath favoured thy servant.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:6">33:6</a> And the maid-servants draw nigh, they and their children,  and bow themselves;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:7">33:7</a> and Leah also draweth nigh, and her children, and they bow  themselves; and afterwards Joseph hath drawn nigh with Rachel,  and they bow themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:8">33:8</a> And he saith, `What to thee [is] all this camp which I have  met?' and he saith, `To find grace in the eyes of my lord.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a> And Esau saith, `I have abundance, my brother, let it be to  thyself that which thou hast.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:10">33:10</a> And Jacob saith, `Nay, I pray thee, if, I pray thee, I  have found grace in thine eyes, then thou hast received my  present from my hand, because that I have seen thy face, as the  seeing of the face of God, and thou art pleased with me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:11">33:11</a> receive, I pray thee, my blessing, which is brought to  thee, because God hath favoured me, and because I have all  [things];' and he presseth on him, and he receiveth,</p>

 <p><a name="an_33:13">33:13</a> And he saith unto him, `My lord knoweth that the children  [are] tender, and the suckling flock and the herd [are] with  me; when they have beaten them one day, then hath all the flock  died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:14">33:14</a> Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant,  and I -- I lead on gently, according to the foot of the work  which [is] before me, and to the foot of the children, until  that I come unto my lord, to Seir.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:15">33:15</a> And Esau saith, `Let me, I pray thee, place with thee some  of the people who [are] with me;' and he said, `Why [is] this?  I find grace in the eyes of my lord.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a> And turn back on that day doth Esau on his way to Seir;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:17">33:17</a> and Jacob hath journeyed to Succoth, and buildeth to  himself a house, and for his cattle hath made booths, therefore  hath he called the name of the place Succoth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:18">33:18</a> And Jacob cometh in to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which  [is] in the land of Canaan, in his coming from Padan-Aram, and  encampeth before the city,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:19">33:19</a> and he buyeth the portion of the field where he hath  stretched out his tent, from the hand of the sons of Hamor,  father of Shechem, for a hundred kesitah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:20">33:20</a> and he setteth up there an altar, and proclaimeth at it  God -- the God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:1">34:1</a> And Dinah, daughter of Leah, whom she hath borne to Jacob,  goeth out to look on the daughters of the land,</p>

 <p><a name="an_34:7">34:7</a> and the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they  heard, and the men grieve themselves, and it [is] very  displeasing to them, for folly he hath done against Israel, to  lie with the daughter of Jacob -- and so it is not done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:8">34:8</a> And Hamor speaketh with them, saying, `Shechem, my son, his  soul hath cleaved to your daughter; give her, I pray you, to  him for a wife,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:9">34:9</a> and join ye in marriage with us; your daughters ye give to  us, and our daughters ye take to yourselves,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:10">34:10</a> and with us ye dwell, and the land is before you; dwell ye  and trade [in] it, and have possessions in it.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:11">34:11</a> And Shechem saith unto her father, and unto her brethren,  `Let me find grace in your eyes, and that which ye say unto me,  I give;</p>

 <p><a name="an_34:13">34:13</a> And the sons of Jacob answer Shechem and Hamor his father  deceitfully, and they speak (because he defiled Dinah their  sister),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:14">34:14</a> and say unto them, `We are not able to do this thing, to  give our sister to one who hath a foreskin: for it [is] a  reproach to us.</p>

 <p><a name="an_34:17">34:17</a> and if ye hearken not unto us to be circumcised, then we  have taken our daughter, and have gone.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:18">34:18</a> And their words are good in the eyes of Hamor, and in the  eyes of Shechem, Hamor's son;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:19">34:19</a> and the young man delayed not to do the thing, for he had  delight in Jacob's daughter, and he is honourable above all the  house of his father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:20">34:20</a> And Hamor cometh -- Shechem his son also -- unto the gate  of their city, and they speak unto the men of their city,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:21">34:21</a> `These men are peaceable with us; then let them dwell in  the land, and trade [in] it; and the land, lo, [is] wide before  them; their daughters let us take to ourselves for wives, and  our daughters give to them.</p>

 <p><a name="an_35:2">35:2</a> And Jacob saith unto his household, and unto all who [are]  with him, `Turn aside the gods of the stranger which [are] in  your midst, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:3">35:3</a> and we rise, and go up to Bethel, and I make there an altar  to God, who is answering me in the day of my distress, and is  with me in the way that I have gone.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:4">35:4</a> And they give unto Jacob all the gods of the stranger that  [are] in their hand, and the rings that [are] in their ears,  and Jacob hideth them under the oak which [is] by Shechem;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:5">35:5</a> and they journey, and the terror of God is on the cities  which [are] round about them, and they have not pursued after  the sons of Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:6">35:6</a> And Jacob cometh in to Luz which [is] in the land of Canaan  (it [is] Bethel), he and all the people who [are] with him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:7">35:7</a> and he buildeth there an altar, and proclaimeth at the  place the God of Bethel: for there had God been revealed unto  him, in his fleeing from the face of his brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:8">35:8</a> And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, dieth, and she is buried at  the lower part of Bethel, under the oak, and he calleth its  name `Oak of weeping.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:9">35:9</a> And God appeareth unto Jacob again, in his coming from  Padan-Aram, and blesseth him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:10">35:10</a> and God saith to him, `Thy name [is] Jacob: thy name is no  more called Jacob, but Israel is thy name;' and He calleth his  name Israel.</p>

 <p><a name="an_37:33">37:33</a> And he discerneth it, and saith, `My son's coat! an evil  beast hath devoured him; torn -- torn is Joseph!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:34">37:34</a> And Jacob rendeth his raiment, and putteth sackcloth on  his loins, and becometh a mourner for his son many days,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:35">37:35</a> and all his sons and all his daughters rise to comfort  him, and he refuseth to comfort himself, and saith, `For -- I  go down mourning unto my son, to Sheol,' and his father weepeth  for him.</p>

 <p><a name="an_38:7">38:7</a> and Er, Judah's first-born, is evil in the eyes of Jehovah,  and Jehovah doth put him to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:8">38:8</a> And Judah saith to Onan, `Go in unto the wife of thy  brother, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:9">38:9</a> and Onan knoweth that the seed is not [reckoned] his; and  it hath come to pass, if he hath gone in unto his brother's  wife, that he hath destroyed [it] to the earth, so as not to  give seed to his brother;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:10">38:10</a> and that which he hath done is evil in the eyes of  Jehovah, and He putteth him also to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:11">38:11</a> And Judah saith to Tamar his daughter-in-law, `Abide a  widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son groweth up;'  for he said, `Lest he die -- even he -- like his brethren;' and  Tamar goeth and dwelleth at her father's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:12">38:12</a> And the days are multiplied, and the daughter of Shuah,  Judah's wife, dieth; and Judah is comforted, and goeth up unto  his sheep-shearers, he and Hirah his friend the Adullamite, to  Timnath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:13">38:13</a> And it is declared to Tamar, saying, `Lo, thy husband's  father is going up to Timnath to shear his flock;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:14">38:14</a> and she turneth aside the garments of her widowhood from  off her, and covereth herself with a vail, and wrappeth herself  up, and sitteth in the opening of Enayim, which [is] by the way  to Timnath, for she hath seen that Shelah hath grown up, and  she hath not been given to him for a wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:15">38:15</a> And Judah seeth her, and reckoneth her for a harlot, for  she hath covered her face,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:16">38:16</a> and he turneth aside unto her by the way, and saith,  `Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee,' (for he hath not  known that she [is] his daughter-in-law); and she saith, `What  dost thou give to me, that thou mayest come in unto me?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:17">38:17</a> and he saith, `I -- I send a kid of the goats from the  flock.' And she saith, `Dost thou give a pledge till thou send  [it]?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:18">38:18</a> and he saith, `What [is] the pledge that I give to thee?'  and she saith, `Thy seal, and thy ribbon, and thy staff which  [is] in thy hand;' and he giveth to her, and goeth in unto her,  and she conceiveth to him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:19">38:19</a> and she riseth, and goeth, and turneth aside her vail from  off her, and putteth on the garments of her widowhood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:20">38:20</a> And Judah sendeth the kid of the goats by the hand of his  friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the hand of  the woman, and he hath not found her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:21">38:21</a> And he asketh the men of her place, saying, `Where [is]  the separated one -- she in Enayim, by the way?' and they say,  `There hath not been in this [place] a separated one.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:22">38:22</a> And he turneth back unto Judah, and saith, `I have not  found her; and the men of the place also have said, There hath  not been in this [place] a separated one,'</p>

 <p><a name="an_38:26">38:26</a> And Judah discerneth and saith, `She hath been more  righteous than I, because that I did not give her to Shelah my  son;' and he hath not added to know her again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:27">38:27</a> And it cometh to pass in the time of her bearing, that lo,  twins [are] in her womb;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:28">38:28</a> and it cometh to pass in her bearing, that [one] giveth  out a hand, and the midwife taketh and bindeth on his hand a  scarlet thread, saying, `This hath come out first.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:29">38:29</a> And it cometh to pass as he draweth back his hand, that  lo, his brother hath come out, and she saith, `What! thou hast  broken forth -- on thee [is] the breach;' and he calleth his  name Pharez;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:30">38:30</a> and afterwards hath his brother come out, on whose hand  [is] the scarlet thread, and he calleth his name Zarah.</p>

 <p><a name="an_39:4">39:4</a> and Joseph findeth grace in his eyes and serveth him, and  he appointeth him over his house, and all that he hath he hath  given into his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:5">39:5</a> And it cometh to pass from the time that he hath appointed  him over his house, and over all that he hath, that Jehovah  blesseth the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake, and the  blessing of Jehovah is on all that he hath, in the house, and  in the field;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:6">39:6</a> and he leaveth all that he hath in the hand of Joseph, and  he hath not known anything that he hath, except the bread which  he is eating. And Joseph is of a fair form, and of a fair  appearance.</p>

 <p><a name="an_39:16">39:16</a> And she placeth his garment near her, until the coming in  of his lord unto his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:17">39:17</a> And she speaketh unto him according to these words,  saying, `The Hebrew servant whom thou hast brought unto us,  hath come in unto me to play with me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:18">39:18</a> and it cometh to pass, when I lift my voice and call, that  he leaveth his garment near me, and fleeth without.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:19">39:19</a> And it cometh to pass when his lord heareth the words of  his wife, which she hath spoken unto him, saying, `According to  these things hath thy servant done to me,' that his anger  burneth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:20">39:20</a> and Joseph's lord taketh him, and putteth him unto the  round-house, a place where the king's prisoners [are] bound;  and he is there in the round-house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:21">39:21</a> And Jehovah is with Joseph, and stretcheth out kindness  unto him, and putteth his grace in the eyes of the chief of the  round-house;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:22">39:22</a> and the chief of the round-house giveth into the hand of  Joseph all the prisoners who [are] in the round-house, and of  all that they are doing there, he hath been doer;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:23">39:23</a> the chief of the round-house seeth not anything under his  hand, because Jehovah [is] with him, and that which he is doing  Jehovah is causing to prosper.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:1">40:1</a> And it cometh to pass, after these things -- the butler of  the king of Egypt and the baker have sinned against their lord,  against the king of Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:2">40:2</a> and Pharaoh is wroth against his two eunuchs, against the  chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:3">40:3</a> and giveth them in charge in the house of the chief of the  executioners, unto the round-house, the place where Joseph [is]  a prisoner,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:4">40:4</a> and the chief of the executioners chargeth Joseph with  them, and he serveth them; and they are days in charge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:5">40:5</a> And they dream a dream both of them, each his dream in one  night, each according to the interpretation of his dream, the  butler and the baker whom the king of Egypt hath, who [are]  prisoners in the round-house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:6">40:6</a> And Joseph cometh in unto them in the morning, and seeth  them, and lo, they [are] morose;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:7">40:7</a> and he asketh Pharaoh's eunuchs who [are] with him in  charge in the house of his lord, saying, `Wherefore [are] your  faces sad to-day?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:8">40:8</a> And they say unto him, `A dream we have dreamed, and there  is no interpreter of it;' and Joseph saith unto them, `Are not  interpretations with God? recount, I pray you, to me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:9">40:9</a> And the chief of the butlers recounteth his dream to  Joseph, and saith to him, `In my dream, then lo, a vine [is]  before me!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:10">40:10</a> and in the vine [are] three branches, and it [is] as it  were flourishing; gone up hath its blossom, its clusters have  ripened grapes;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:11">40:11</a> and Pharaoh's cup [is] in my hand, and I take the grapes  and press them into the cup of Pharaoh, and I give the cup into  the hand of Pharaoh.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:12">40:12</a> And Joseph saith to him, `This [is] its interpretation:  the three branches are three days;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:13">40:13</a> yet, within three days doth Pharaoh lift up thy head, and  hath put thee back on thy station, and thou hast given the cup  of Pharaoh into his hand, according to the former custom when  thou wast his butler.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:14">40:14</a> `Surely if thou hast remembered me with thee, when it is  well with thee, and hast done (I pray thee) kindness with me,  and hast made mention of me unto Pharaoh, then hast thou  brought me out from this house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:15">40:15</a> for I was really stolen from the land of the Hebrews; and  here also have I done nothing that they have put me in the  pit.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:16">40:16</a> And the chief of the bakers seeth that he hath interpreted  good, and he saith unto Joseph, `I also [am] in a dream, and  lo, three baskets of white bread [are] on my head,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:17">40:17</a> and in the uppermost basket [are] of all [kinds] of  Pharaoh's food, work of a baker; and the birds are eating them  out of the basket, from off my head.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:18">40:18</a> And Joseph answereth and saith, `This [is] its  interpretation: the three baskets are three days;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:19">40:19</a> yet, within three days doth Pharaoh lift up thy head from  off thee, and hath hanged thee on a tree, and the birds have  eaten thy flesh from off thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:20">40:20</a> And it cometh to pass, on the third day, Pharaoh's  birthday, that he maketh a banquet to all his servants, and  lifteth up the head of the chief of the butlers, and the head  of the chief of the bakers among his servants,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:21">40:21</a> and he putteth back the chief of the butlers to his  butlership, and he giveth the cup into the hand of Pharaoh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:22">40:22</a> and the chief of the bakers he hath hanged, as Joseph hath  interpreted to them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:23">40:23</a> and the chief of the butlers hath not remembered Joseph,  but forgetteth him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:1">41:1</a> And it cometh to pass, at the end of two years of days that  Pharaoh is dreaming, and lo, he is standing by the River,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:2">41:2</a> and lo, from the River coming up are seven kine, of fair  appearance, and fat [in] flesh, and they feed among the reeds;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:3">41:3</a> and lo, seven other kine are coming up after them out of  the River, of bad appearance, and lean [in] flesh, and they  stand near the kine on the edge of the River,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:4">41:4</a> and the kine of bad appearance and lean [in] flesh eat up  the seven kine of fair appearance, and fat -- and Pharaoh  awaketh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:5">41:5</a> And he sleepeth, and dreameth a second time, and lo, seven  ears are coming up on one stalk, fat and good,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:6">41:6</a> and lo, seven ears, thin, and blasted with an east wind,  are springing up after them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:7">41:7</a> and the thin ears swallow the seven fat and full ears --  and Pharaoh awaketh, and lo, a dream.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:8">41:8</a> And it cometh to pass in the morning, that his spirit is  moved, and he sendeth and calleth all the scribes of Egypt, and  all its wise men, and Pharaoh recounteth to them his dream, and  there is no interpreter of them to Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:9">41:9</a> And the chief of the butlers speaketh with Pharaoh, saying,  `My sin I mention this day:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:10">41:10</a> Pharaoh hath been wroth against his servants, and giveth  me into charge in the house of the chief of the executioners,  me and the chief of the bakers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:11">41:11</a> and we dream a dream in one night, I and he, each  according to the interpretation of his dream we have dreamed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:12">41:12</a> And there [is] with us a youth, a Hebrew, servant to the  chief of the executioners, and we recount to him, and he  interpreteth to us our dreams, [to] each according to his dream  hath he interpreted,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:13">41:13</a> and it cometh to pass, as he hath interpreted to us so it  hath been, me he put back on my station, and him he hanged.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:14">41:14</a> And Pharaoh sendeth and calleth Joseph, and they cause him  to run out of the pit, and he shaveth, and changeth his  garments, and cometh in unto Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:15">41:15</a> And Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `A dream I have dreamed,  and there is no interpreter of it, and I -- I have heard  concerning thee, saying, Thou understandest a dream to  interpret it,'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:16">41:16</a> and Joseph answereth Pharaoh, saying, `Without me -- God  doth answer Pharaoh with peace.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:17">41:17</a> And Pharaoh speaketh unto Joseph: `In my dream, lo, I am  standing by the edge of the River,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:18">41:18</a> and lo, out of the River coming up are seven kine, fat  [in] flesh, and of fair form, and they feed among the reeds;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:19">41:19</a> and lo, seven other kine are coming up after them, thin,  and of very bad form, and lean [in] flesh; I have not seen like  these in all the land of Egypt for badness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:20">41:20</a> `And the lean and the bad kine eat up the first seven fat  kine,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:21">41:21</a> and they come in unto their midst, and it hath not been  known that they have come in unto their midst, and their  appearance [is] bad as at the commencement; and I awake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:22">41:22</a> `And I see in my dream, and lo, seven ears are coming up  on one stalk, full and good;</p>

 <p><a name="an_41:24">41:24</a> and the thin ears swallow the seven good ears; and I tell  unto the scribes, and there is none declaring to me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:25">41:25</a> And Joseph saith unto Pharaoh, `The dream of Pharaoh is  one: that which God is doing he hath declared to Pharaoh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:26">41:26</a> the seven good kine are seven years, and the seven good  ears are seven years, the dream is one;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:27">41:27</a> and the seven thin and bad kine which are coming up after  them are seven years, and the seven empty ears, blasted with an  east wind, are seven years of famine;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:28">41:28</a> this [is] the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: That  which God is doing, he hath shewn Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:29">41:29</a> `Lo, seven years are coming of great abundance in all the  land of Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:30">41:30</a> and seven years of famine have arisen after them, and all  the plenty is forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine  hath finished the land,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:31">41:31</a> and the plenty is not known in the land because of that  famine afterwards, for it [is] very grievous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:32">41:32</a> `And because of the repeating of the dream unto Pharaoh  twice, surely the thing is established by God, and God is  hastening to do it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:33">41:33</a> `And now, let Pharaoh provide a man, intelligent and wise,  and set him over the land of Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:34">41:34</a> let Pharaoh make and appoint overseers over the land, and  receive a fifth of the land of Egypt in the seven years of  plenty,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:35">41:35</a> and they gather all the food of these good years that are  coming, and heap up corn under the hand of Pharaoh -- food in  the cities; and they have kept [it],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:36">41:36</a> and the food hath been for a store for the land, for the  seven years of famine which are in the land of Egypt; and the  land is cut off by the famine.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:37">41:37</a> And the thing is good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the  eyes of all his servants,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:38">41:38</a> and Pharaoh saith unto his servants, `Do we find like  this, a man in whom the spirit of God [is]?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:39">41:39</a> and Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `After God's causing thee  to know all this, there is none intelligent and wise as thou;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:40">41:40</a> thou -- thou art over my house, and at thy mouth do all my  people kiss; only in the throne I am greater than thou.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:41">41:41</a> And Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `See, I have put thee over  all the land of Egypt.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:42">41:42</a> And Pharaoh turneth aside his seal-ring from off his hand,  and putteth it on the hand of Joseph, and clotheth him [with]  garments of fine linen, and placeth a chain of gold on his  neck,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:43">41:43</a> and causeth him to ride in the second chariot which he  hath, and they proclaim before him, `Bow the knee!' and -- to  put him over all the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:44">41:44</a> And Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `I [am] Pharaoh, and  without thee a man doth not lift up his hand and his foot in  all the land of Egypt;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:45">41:45</a> and Pharaoh calleth Joseph's name Zaphnath-Paaneah, and he  giveth to him Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On,  for a wife, and Joseph goeth out over the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:46">41:46</a> And Joseph [is] a son of thirty years in his standing  before Pharaoh king of Egypt, and Joseph goeth out from the  presence of Pharaoh, and passeth over through all the land of  Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:47">41:47</a> and the land maketh in the seven years of plenty by  handfuls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:48">41:48</a> And he gathereth all the food of the seven years which  have been in the land of Egypt, and putteth food in the cities;  the food of the field which [is] round about [each] city hath  he put in its midst;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:49">41:49</a> and Joseph gathereth corn as sand of the sea, multiplying  exceedingly, until that he hath ceased to number, for there is  no number.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:50">41:50</a> And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine  cometh, whom Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On,  hath borne to him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:51">41:51</a> and Joseph calleth the name of the first-born Manasseh:  `for, God hath made me to forget all my labour, and all the  house of my father;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:52">41:52</a> and the name of the second he hath called Ephraim: `for,  God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of mine  affliction.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:53">41:53</a> And the seven years of plenty are completed which have  been in the land of Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:54">41:54</a> and the seven years of famine begin to come, as Joseph  said, and famine is in all the lands, but in all the land of  Egypt hath been bread;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:55">41:55</a> and all the land of Egypt is famished, and the people  crieth unto Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh saith to all the  Egyptians, `Go unto Joseph; that which he saith to you -- do.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:56">41:56</a> And the famine has been over all the face of the land, and  Joseph openeth all [places] which have [corn] in them, and  selleth to the Egyptians; and the famine is severe in the land  of Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:57">41:57</a> and all the earth hath come to Egypt, to buy, unto Joseph,  for the famine was severe in all the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:1">42:1</a> And Jacob seeth that there is corn in Egypt, and Jacob  saith to his sons, `Why do you look at each other?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:2">42:2</a> he saith also, `Lo, I have heard that there is corn in  Egypt, go down thither, and buy for us from thence, and we live  and do not die;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:3">42:3</a> and the ten brethren of Joseph go down to buy corn in  Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:4">42:4</a> and Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob hath not sent with  his brethren, for he said, `Lest mischief meet him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:5">42:5</a> And the sons of Israel come to buy in the midst of those  coming, for the famine hath been in the land of Canaan,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:6">42:6</a> and Joseph is the ruler over the land, he who is selling to  all the people of the land, and Joseph's brethren come and bow  themselves to him -- face to the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:7">42:7</a> And Joseph seeth his brethren, and discerneth them, and  maketh himself strange unto them, and speaketh with them sharp  things, and saith unto them, `From whence have ye come?' and  they say, `From the land of Canaan -- to buy food.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:8">42:8</a> And Joseph discerneth his brethren, but they have not  discerned him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:9">42:9</a> and Joseph remembereth the dreams which he dreamed of them,  and saith unto them, `Ye [are] spies; to see the nakedness of  the land ye have come.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:10">42:10</a> And they say unto him, `No, my lord, but thy servants have  come to buy food;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:11">42:11</a> we [are] all of us sons of one man, we [are] right men;  thy servants have not been spies;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:12">42:12</a> and he saith unto them, `No, but the nakedness of the land  ye have come to see;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:13">42:13</a> and they say, `Thy servants [are] twelve brethren; we  [are] sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and lo, the young  one [is] with our father to-day, and the one is not.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:14">42:14</a> And Joseph saith unto them, `This [is] that which I have  spoken unto you, saying, Ye [are] spies,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:15">42:15</a> by this ye are proved: Pharaoh liveth! if ye go out from  this -- except by your young brother coming hither;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:16">42:16</a> send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and ye,  remain ye bound, and let your words be proved, whether truth be  with you: and if not -- Pharaoh liveth! surely ye [are] spies;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:17">42:17</a> and he removeth them unto charge three days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:18">42:18</a> And Joseph saith unto them on the third day, `This do and  live; God I fear!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:19">42:19</a> if ye [are] right men, let one of your brethren be bound  in the house of your ward, and ye, go, carry in corn [for] the  famine of your houses,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:20">42:20</a> and your young brother ye bring unto me, and your words  are established, and ye die not;' and they do so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:21">42:21</a> And they say one unto another, `Verily we [are] guilty  concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his  soul, in his making supplication unto us, and we did not  hearken: therefore hath this distress come upon us.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:22">42:22</a> And Reuben answereth them, saying, `Spake I not unto you,  saying, Sin not against the lad? and ye hearkened not; and his  blood also, lo, it is required.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:23">42:23</a> And they have not known that Joseph understandeth, for the  interpreter [is] between them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:24">42:24</a> and he turneth round from them, and weepeth, and turneth  back unto them, and speaketh unto them, and taketh from them  Simeon, and bindeth him before their eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:25">42:25</a> And Joseph commandeth, and they fill their vessels [with]  corn, also to put back the money of each unto his sack, and to  give to them provision for the way; and one doth to them so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:26">42:26</a> And they lift up their corn upon their asses, and go from  thence,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:27">42:27</a> and the one openeth his sack to give provender to his ass  at a lodging-place, and he seeth his money, and lo, it [is] in  the mouth of his bag,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:28">42:28</a> and he saith unto his brethren, `My money hath been put  back, and also, lo, in my bag:' and their heart goeth out, and  they tremble, one to another saying, `What [is] this God hath  done to us!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:29">42:29</a> And they come in unto Jacob their father, to the land of  Canaan, and they declare to him all the things meeting them,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:30">42:30</a> `The man, the lord of the land, hath spoken with us sharp  things, and maketh us as spies of the land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:31">42:31</a> and we say unto him, We [are] right men, we have not been  spies,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:32">42:32</a> we [are] twelve brethren, sons of our father, the one is  not, and the young one [is] to-day with our father in the land  of Canaan.</p>

 <p><a name="an_42:35">42:35</a> And it cometh to pass, they are emptying their sacks, and  lo, the bundle of each man's silver [is] in his sack, and they  see their bundles of silver, they and their father, and are  afraid;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:36">42:36</a> and Jacob their father saith unto them, `Me ye have  bereaved; Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and Benjamin ye  take -- against me have been all these.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:37">42:37</a> And Reuben speaketh unto his father, saying, `My two sons  thou dost put to death, if I bring him not in unto thee; give  him into my hand, and I -- I bring him back unto thee;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:38">42:38</a> and he saith, `My son doth not go down with you, for his  brother [is] dead, and he by himself is left; when mischief  hath met him in the way in which ye go, then ye have brought  down my grey hairs in sorrow to sheol.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:1">43:1</a> And the famine [is] severe in the land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:2">43:2</a> and it cometh to pass, when they have finished eating the  corn which they brought from Egypt, that their father saith  unto them, `Turn back, buy for us a little food.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:3">43:3</a> And Judah speaketh unto him, saying, `The man protesting  protested to us, saying, Ye do not see my face without your  brother [being] with you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:4">43:4</a> if thou art sending our brother with us, we go down, and  buy for thee food,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:5">43:5</a> and if thou art not sending -- we do not go down, for the  man said unto us, Ye do not see my face without your brother  [being] with you.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:6">43:6</a> And Israel saith, `Why did ye evil to me, by declaring to  the man that ye had yet a brother?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:7">43:7</a> and they say, `The man asked diligently concerning us, and  concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have  ye a brother? and we declare to him according to the tenor of  these things; do we certainly know that he will say, Bring down  your brother?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:8">43:8</a> And Judah saith unto Israel his father, `Send the youth  with me, and we arise, and go, and live, and do not die, both  we, and thou, and our infants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:9">43:9</a> I -- I am surety [for] him, from my hand thou dost require  him; if I have not brought him in unto thee, and set him before  thee -- then I have sinned against thee all the days;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:10">43:10</a> for if we had not lingered, surely now we had returned  these two times.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:11">43:11</a> And Israel their father saith unto them, `If so, now, this  do: take of the praised thing of the land in your vessels, and  take down to the man a present, a little balm, and a little  honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:12">43:12</a> and double money take in your hand, even the money which  is brought back in the mouth of your bags, ye take back in your  hand, it may be it [is] an oversight.</p>

 <p><a name="an_43:15">43:15</a> And the men take this present, double money also they have  taken in their hand, and Benjamin; and they rise, and go down  to Egypt, and stand before Joseph;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:16">43:16</a> and Joseph seeth Benjamin with them, and saith to him who  [is] over his house, `Bring the men into the house, and  slaughter an animal, and make ready, for with me do the men eat  at noon.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:17">43:17</a> And the man doth as Joseph hath said, and the man bringeth  in the men into the house of Joseph,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:18">43:18</a> and the men are afraid because they have been brought into  the house of Joseph, and they say, `For the matter of the money  which was put back in our bags at the commencement are we  brought in -- to roll himself upon us, and to throw himself on  us, and to take us for servants -- our asses also.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:19">43:19</a> And they come nigh unto the man who [is] over the house of  Joseph, and speak unto him at the opening of the house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:20">43:20</a> and say, `O, my lord, we really come down at the  commencement to buy food;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:21">43:21</a> and it cometh to pass, when we have come in unto the  lodging-place, and open our bags, that lo, each one's money  [is] in the mouth of his bag, our money in its weight, and we  bring it back in our hand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:22">43:22</a> and other money have we brought down in our hand to buy  food; we have not known who put our money in our bags.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:23">43:23</a> And he saith, `Peace to you, fear not: your God and the  God of your father hath given to you hidden treasure in your  bags, your money came unto me;' and he bringeth out Simeon unto  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:24">43:24</a> And the man bringeth in the men into Joseph's house, and  giveth water, and they wash their feet; and he giveth provender  for their asses,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:25">43:25</a> and they prepare the present until the coming of Joseph at  noon, for they have heard that there they do eat bread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:26">43:26</a> And Joseph cometh into the house, and they bring to him  the present which [is] in their hand, into the house, and bow  themselves to him, to the earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:27">43:27</a> and he asketh of them of peace, and saith, `Is your father  well? the aged man of whom ye have spoken, is he yet alive?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:28">43:28</a> and they say, `Thy servant our father [is] well, he is yet  alive;' and they bow, and do obeisance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:29">43:29</a> And he lifteth up his eyes, and seeth Benjamin his  brother, his mother's son, and saith, `Is this your young  brother, of whom ye have spoken unto me?' and he saith, `God  favour thee, my son.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:30">43:30</a> And Joseph hasteth, for his bowels have been moved for his  brother, and he seeketh to weep, and entereth the inner  chamber, and weepeth there;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:31">43:31</a> and he washeth his face, and goeth out, and refraineth  himself, and saith, `Place bread.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:32">43:32</a> And they place for him by himself, and for them by  themselves, and for the Egyptians who are eating with him by  themselves: for the Egyptians are unable to eat bread with the  Hebrews, for it [is] an abomination to the Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:33">43:33</a> And they sit before him, the first-born according to his  birthright, and the young one according to his youth, and the  men wonder one at another;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:34">43:34</a> and he lifteth up gifts from before him unto them, and the  gift of Benjamin is five hands more than the gifts of all of  them; and they drink, yea, they drink abundantly with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:1">44:1</a> And he commandeth him who [is] over his house, saying,  `Fill the bags of the men [with] food, as they are able to  bear, and put the money of each in the mouth of his bag;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:2">44:2</a> and my cup, the silver cup, thou dost put in the mouth of  the bag of the young one, and his corn-money;' and he doth  according to the word of Joseph which he hath spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:3">44:3</a> The morning is bright, and the men have been sent away,  they and their asses --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:4">44:4</a> they have gone out of the city -- they have not gone far  off -- and Joseph hath said to him who [is] over his house,  `Rise, pursue after the men; and thou hast overtaken them, and  thou hast said unto them, Why have ye recompensed evil for  good?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:5">44:5</a> Is not this that with which my lord drinketh? and he  observeth diligently with it; ye have done evil [in] that which  ye have done.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:6">44:6</a> And he overtaketh them, and speaketh unto them these words,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:7">44:7</a> and they say unto him, `Why doth my lord speak according to  these words? far be it from thy servants to do according to  this word;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:8">44:8</a> lo, the money which we found in the mouth of our bags we  brought back unto thee from the land of Canaan, and how do we  steal from the house of thy lord silver or gold?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:9">44:9</a> with whomsoever of thy servants it is found, he hath died,  and we also are to my lord for servants.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:10">44:10</a> And he saith, `Now, also, according to your words, so it  [is]; he with whom it is found becometh my servant, and ye are  acquitted;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:11">44:11</a> and they hasten and take down each his bag to the earth,  and each openeth his bag;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:12">44:12</a> and he searcheth -- at the eldest he hath begun, and at  the youngest he hath completed -- and the cup is found in the  bag of Benjamin;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:13">44:13</a> and they rend their garments, and each ladeth his ass, and  they turn back to the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:14">44:14</a> And Judah -- his brethren also -- cometh in unto the house  of Joseph, and he is yet there, and they fall before him to the  earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:15">44:15</a> and Joseph saith to them, `What [is] this deed that ye  have done? have ye not known that a man like me doth diligently  observe?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:16">44:16</a> And Judah saith, `What do we say to my lord? what do we  speak? and what -- do we justify ourselves? God hath found out  the iniquity of thy servants; lo, we [are] servants to my lord,  both we, and he in whose hand the cup hath been found;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:17">44:17</a> and he saith, `Far be it from me to do this; the man in  whose hand the cup hath been found, he becometh my servant; and  ye, go ye up in peace unto your father.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:18">44:18</a> And Judah cometh nigh unto him, and saith, `O, my lord,  let thy servant speak, I pray thee, a word in the ears of my  lord, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant -- for  thou art as Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:19">44:19</a> My lord hath asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father  or brother?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:20">44:20</a> and we say unto my lord, We have a father, an aged one,  and a child of old age, a little one; and his brother died, and  he is left alone of his mother, and his father hath loved him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:21">44:21</a> `And thou sayest unto thy servants, Bring him down unto  me, and I set mine eye upon him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:22">44:22</a> and we say unto my lord, The youth is not able to leave  his father, when he hath left his father, then he hath died;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:23">44:23</a> and thou sayest unto thy servants, If your young brother  come not down with you, ye add not to see my face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:24">44:24</a> `And it cometh to pass, that we have come up unto thy  servant my father, that we declare to him the words of my lord;</p>

 <p><a name="an_44:26">44:26</a> and we say, We are not able to go down; if our young  brother is with us, then we have gone down; for we are not able  to see the man's face, and our young brother not with us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:27">44:27</a> `And thy servant my father saith unto us, Ye -- ye have  known that two did my wife bare to me,</p>

 <p><a name="an_44:29">44:29</a> when ye have taken also this from my presence, and  mischief hath met him, then ye have brought down my grey hairs  with evil to sheol.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:30">44:30</a> `And now, at my coming in unto thy servant my father, and  the youth not with us (and his soul is bound up in his soul),</p>

 <p><a name="an_44:32">44:32</a> for thy servant obtained the youth by surety from my  father, saying, If I bring him not in unto thee -- then I have  sinned against my father all the days.</p>

 <p><a name="an_45:1">45:1</a> And Joseph hath not been able to refrain himself before all  those standing by him, and he calleth, `Put out every man from  me;' and no man hath stood with him when Joseph maketh himself  known unto his brethren,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:2">45:2</a> and he giveth forth his voice in weeping, and the Egyptians  hear, and the house of Pharaoh heareth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:3">45:3</a> And Joseph saith unto his brethren, `I [am] Joseph, is my  father yet alive?' and his brethren have not been able to  answer him, for they have been troubled at his presence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:4">45:4</a> And Joseph saith unto his brethren, `Come nigh unto me, I  pray you,' and they come nigh; and he saith, `I [am] Joseph,  your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:5">45:5</a> and now, be not grieved, nor let it be displeasing in your  eyes that ye sold me hither, for to preserve life hath God sent  me before you.</p>

 <p><a name="an_45:16">45:16</a> And the sound hath been heard in the house of Pharaoh,  saying, `Come have the brethren of Joseph;' and it is good in  the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:17">45:17</a> and Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `Say unto thy brethren,  This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, enter ye the land of  Canaan,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:18">45:18</a> and take your father, and your households, and come unto  me, and I give to you the good of the land of Egypt, and eat ye  the fat of the land.</p>

 <p><a name="an_45:21">45:21</a> And the sons of Israel do so, and Joseph giveth waggons to  them by the command of Pharaoh, and he giveth to them provision  for the way;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:22">45:22</a> to all of them hath he given -- to each changes of  garments, and to Benjamin he hath given three hundred  silverlings, and five changes of garments;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:23">45:23</a> and to his father he hath sent thus: ten asses bearing of  the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses bearing corn and  bread, even food for his father for the way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:24">45:24</a> And he sendeth his brethren away, and they go; and he  saith unto them, `Be not angry in the way.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_45:26">45:26</a> and they declare to him, saying, `Joseph [is] yet alive,'  and that he [is] ruler over all the land of Egypt; and his  heart ceaseth, for he hath not given credence to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:27">45:27</a> And they speak unto him all the words of Joseph, which he  hath spoken unto them, and he seeth the waggons which Joseph  hath sent to bear him away, and live doth the spirit of Jacob  their father;</p>

 <p><a name="an_47:4">47:4</a> and they say unto Pharaoh, `To sojourn in the land we have  come, for there is no pasture for the flock which thy servants  have, for grievous [is] the famine in the land of Canaan; and  now, let thy servants, we pray thee, dwell in the land of  Goshen.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:5">47:5</a> And Pharaoh speaketh unto Joseph, saying, `Thy father and  thy brethren have come unto thee:</p>

 <p><a name="an_47:13">47:13</a> And there is no bread in all the land, for the famine [is]  very grievous, and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan are  feeble because of the famine;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:14">47:14</a> and Joseph gathereth all the silver that is found in the  land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn that  they are buying, and Joseph bringeth the silver into the house  of Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:15">47:15</a> And the silver is consumed out of the land of Egypt, and  out of the land of Canaan, and all the Egyptians come in unto  Joseph, saying, `Give to us bread -- why do we die before thee,  though the money hath ceased?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:16">47:16</a> and Joseph saith, `Give your cattle; and I give to you for  your cattle, if the money hath ceased.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_47:20">47:20</a> And Joseph buyeth all the ground of Egypt for Pharaoh, for  the Egyptians have sold each his field, for the famine hath been  severe upon them, and the land becometh Pharaoh's;</p>

 <p><a name="an_47:25">47:25</a> And they say, `Thou hast revived us; we find grace in the  eyes of my lord, and have been servants to Pharaoh;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:26">47:26</a> and Joseph setteth it for a statute unto this day,  concerning the ground of Egypt, [that] Pharaoh hath a fifth;  only the ground of the priests alone hath not become Pharaoh's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:27">47:27</a> And Israel dwelleth in the land of Egypt, in the land of  Goshen, and they have possession in it, and are fruitful, and  multiply exceedingly;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:28">47:28</a> and Jacob liveth in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and  the days of Jacob, the years of his life, are an hundred and  forty and seven years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:29">47:29</a> And the days of Israel are near to die, and he calleth for  his son, for Joseph, and saith to him, `If, I pray thee, I have  found grace in thine eyes, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my  thigh, and thou hast done with me kindness and truth; bury me  not, I pray thee, in Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:30">47:30</a> and I have lain with my fathers, and thou hast borne me  out of Egypt, and buried me in their burying-place.' And he  saith, `I -- I do according to thy word;'</p>

 <p><a name="an_48:8">48:8</a> And Israel seeth the sons of Joseph, and saith, `Who [are]  these?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:9">48:9</a> and Joseph saith unto his father, `They [are] my sons, whom  God hath given to me in this [place];' and he saith, `Bring  them, I pray thee, unto me, and I bless them.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:10">48:10</a> And the eyes of Israel have been heavy from age, he is  unable to see; and he bringeth them nigh unto him, and he  kisseth them, and cleaveth to them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:11">48:11</a> and Israel saith unto Joseph, `To see thy face I had not  thought, and lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_48:14">48:14</a> And Israel putteth out his right hand, and placeth [it]  upon the head of Ephraim, who [is] the younger, and his left  hand upon the head of Manasseh; he hath guided his hands  wisely, for Manasseh [is] the first-born.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:15">48:15</a> And he blesseth Joseph, and saith, `God, before whom my  fathers Abraham and Isaac walked habitually: God who is feeding  me from my being unto this day:</p>

 <p><a name="an_48:17">48:17</a> And Joseph seeth that his father setteth his right hand on  the head of Ephraim, and it is wrong in his eyes, and he  supporteth the hand of his father to turn it aside from off the  head of Ephraim to the head of Manasseh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:18">48:18</a> and Joseph saith unto his father, `Not so, my father, for  this [is] the first-born; set thy right hand on his head.'</p>
