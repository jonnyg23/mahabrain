  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: 1 Samuel</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And there is a certain man of Ramathaim-Zophim, of the  hill-country of Ephraim, and his name [is] Elkanah, son of  Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, and  Ephrathite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> and he hath two wives, the name of the one [is] Hannah, and  the name of the second Peninnah, and Peninnah hath children,  and Hannah hath no children.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And that man hath gone up out of his city from time to time,  to bow himself, and to sacrifice, before Jehovah of Hosts, in  Shiloh, and there [are] two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas,  priests to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And the day cometh, and Elkanah sacrificeth, and he hath  given to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her  daughters, portions,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> and to Hannah he giveth a certain portion -- double, for he  hath loved Hannah, and Jehovah hath shut her womb;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> and her adversity hath also provoked her greatly, so as to  make her tremble, for Jehovah hath shut up her womb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> And so he doth year by year, from the time of her going up  into the house of Jehovah, so it provoketh her, and she  weepeth, and doth not eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And Elkanah her husband saith to her, `Hannah, why weepest  thou? and why dost thou not eat? and why is thy heart  afflicted? am I not better to thee than ten sons?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And Hannah riseth after eating in Shiloh, and after  drinking, and Eli the priest is sitting on the throne by the  side-post of the temple of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And she is bitter in soul, and prayeth unto Jehovah, and  weepeth greatly,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> and voweth a vow, and saith, `Jehovah of Hosts, if Thou  dost certainly look on the affliction of Thy handmaid, and hast  remembered me, and dost not forget Thy handmaid, and hast given  to Thy handmaid seed of men -- then I have given him to Jehovah  all days of his life, and a razor doth not go up upon his  head.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And it hath been, when she multiplied praying before  Jehovah, that Eli is watching her mouth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> and Hannah, she is speaking to her heart, only her lips are  moving, and her voice is not heard, and Eli reckoneth her to be  drunken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And Eli saith unto her, `Until when are thou drunken? turn  aside thy wine from thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And Hannah answereth and saith, `No, my lord, A woman  sharply pained in spirit I [am], and wine and strong drink I  have not drunk, and I pour out my soul before Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> put not thy handmaid before a daughter of worthlessness,  for from the abundance of my meditation, and of my provocation,  I have spoken hitherto.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And Eli answereth and saith, `Go in peace, and the God of  Israel doth give thy petition which thou hast asked of Him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And she saith, `Let thy handmaid find grace in thine eyes;'  and the woman goeth on her way, and eateth, and her countenance  hath not been [sad] for it any more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And they rise early in the morning, and bow themselves  before Jehovah, and turn back, and come in unto their house in  Ramah, and Elkanah knoweth Hannah his wife, and Jehovah  remembereth her;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> and it cometh to pass, at the revolution of the days, that  Hannah conceiveth, and beareth a son, and calleth his name  Samuel, `for, from Jehovah I have asked him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> And the man Elkanah goeth up, and all his house, to  sacrifice to Jehovah the sacrifice of the days, and his vow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> And Hannah hath not gone up, for she said to her husband,  `Till the youth is weaned -- then I have brought him in, and he  hath appeared before the face of Jehovah, and dwelt there -- unto  the age.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> And Elkanah her husband saith to her, `Do that which is  good in thine eyes; abide till thy weaning him; only, Jehovah  establish His word;' and the woman abideth and suckleth her son  till she hath weaned him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> and she causeth him to go up with her when she hath weaned  him, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle  of wine, and she bringeth him into the house of Jehovah at  Shiloh, and the youth [is but] a youth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> And they slaughter the bullock, and bring in the youth unto  Eli,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> and she saith, `O, my lord, thy soul liveth! my lord, I  [am] the woman who stood with thee in this [place], to pray  unto Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> for this youth I prayed, and Jehovah doth give to me my  petition which I asked of Him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> and also I have caused him to be asked for Jehovah, all the  days that he hath lived -- he is asked for Jehovah;' and he  boweth himself there before Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And Hannah prayeth, and saith: `My heart hath exulted in  Jehovah, My horn hath been high in Jehovah, My mouth hath been  large over mine enemies, For I have rejoiced in Thy salvation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> There is none holy like Jehovah, For there is none save  Thee, And there is no rock like our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Ye multiply not -- ye speak haughtily -- The old saying goeth  out from your mouth, For a God of knowledge [is] Jehovah, And  by Him actions are weighed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> Bows of the mighty are broken, And the stumbling have girded  on strength.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> The satiated for bread hired themselves, And the hungry have  ceased. While the barren hath borne seven, And she abounding  with sons hath languished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> Jehovah putteth to death, and keepeth alive, He bringeth  down to Sheol, and bringeth up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> Jehovah dispossesseth, and He maketh rich, He maketh low,  yea, He maketh high.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> He raiseth from the dust the poor, From a dunghill He lifteth  up the needy, To cause [them] to sit with nobles, Yea, a throne  of honour He doth cause them to inherit, For to Jehovah [are]  the fixtures of earth, And He setteth on them the habitable  world.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> The feet of His saints He keepeth, And the wicked in  darkness are silent, For not by power doth man become mighty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Jehovah -- broken down are His adversaries, Against them in  the heavens He thundereth: Jehovah judgeth the ends of earth,  And giveth strength to His king, And exalteth the horn of His  anointed.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And Elkanah goeth to Ramath, unto his house, and the youth  hath been serving Jehovah, [in] the presence of Eli the priest;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> and the sons of Eli [are] sons of worthlessness, they have  not known Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And the custom of the priests with the people [is]: any man  sacrificing a sacrifice -- then hath the servant of the priest  come in when the flesh is boiling, and the hook of three teeth  in his hand,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> and hath struck [it] into the pan, or kettle, or caldron,  or pot; all that the hook bringeth up doth the priest take for  himself; thus they do to all Israel who are coming in, there,  in Shiloh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> Also before they make perfume with the fat -- then hath the  priest's servant come in, and said to the man who is  sacrificing, `Give flesh to roast for the priest, and he doth  not take of thee flesh boiled, but raw;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> and the man saith unto him, `Let them surely make a perfume  (as to-day) with the fat, then take to thee as thy soul  desireth;' and he hath said to him, `Surely now thou dost give;  and if not -- I have taken by strength.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And the sin of the young men is very great [in] the  presence of Jehovah, for the men have despised the offering of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And Samuel is ministering [in] the presence of Jehovah, a  youth girt [with] an ephod of linen;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> and a small upper coat doth his mother make to him, and she  hath brought it up to him from time to time, in her coming up  with her husband to sacrifice the sacrifice of the time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> And Eli blessed Elkanah, and his wife, and said, `Jehovah  doth appoint for thee seed of this woman, for the petition  which she asked for Jehovah;' and they have gone to their  place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> When Jehovah hath looked after Hannah, then she conceiveth  and beareth three sons and two daughters; and the youth Samuel  groweth up with Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> And Eli [is] very old, and hath heard all that his sons do  to all Israel, and how that they lie with the women who are  assembling [at] the opening of the tent of meeting,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> and he saith to them, `Why do ye things like these? for I  am hearing of your evil words from all the people -- these!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> Nay, my sons; for the report which I am hearing is not good  causing the people of Jehovah to transgress. --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> If a man sin against a man, then hath God judged him; but  if against Jehovah a man sin, who doth pray for him?' and they  hearken not to the voice of their father, though Jehovah hath  delighted to put them to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> And the youth Samuel is going on and growing up, and [is]  good both with Jehovah, and also with men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> And there cometh a man of God unto Eli, and saith unto him,  `Thus said Jehovah, Was I really revealed unto the house of thy  father in their being in Egypt, before Pharaoh's house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> even to choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to Me  for a priest, to go up on Mine altar, to make a perfume, to  bear an ephod before Me, and I give to the house of thy father  all the fire-offerings of the sons of Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> Why do ye kick at My sacrifice, and at Mine offering which  I commanded [in] My habitation, and dost honour thy sons above  Me, to make yourselves fat from the first part of every  offering of Israel, of My people?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:30">2:30</a> `Therefore -- the affirmation of Jehovah, God of Israel -- I  certainly said, Thy house and the house of thy father, do walk  up and down before Me to the age; and now -- the affirmation of  Jehovah -- Far be it from Me! for he who is honouring Me, I  honour, and those despising Me, are lightly esteemed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:31">2:31</a> `Lo, days [are] coming, and I have cut off thine arm, and  the arm of the house of thy father, that an old man is not in  thy house;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:32">2:32</a> and thou hast beheld an adversary [in My] habitation, in  all that He doth good with Israel, and there is not an old man  in thy house all the days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:33">2:33</a> `And the man I cut not off of thine from Mine altar, [is]  to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy soul; and all the  increase of thy house do die men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:34">2:34</a> and this [is] to thee the sign that cometh unto thy two  sons, unto Hophni and Phinehas -- in one day they die both of  them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:35">2:35</a> and I have raised up for Me a stedfast priest; as in My  heart and in My soul he doth do; and I have built for him a  stedfast house, and he hath walked up and down before Mine  anointed all the days;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:36">2:36</a> and it hath been, every one who is left in thy house doth  come in to bow himself to him, for a wage of silver, and a cake  of bread, and hath said, Admit me, I pray thee, unto one of the  priest's offices, to eat a morsel of bread.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And the youth Samuel is serving Jehovah before Eli, and the  word of Jehovah hath been precious in those days -- there is no  vision broken forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And it cometh to pass, at that time, that Eli is lying down  in his place, and his eyes have begun to be dim -- he is not able  to see.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And the lamp of God is not yet extinguished, and Samuel is  lying down in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God [is],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> and Jehovah calleth unto Samuel, and he saith, `Here [am]  I.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And he runneth unto Eli, and saith, `Here [am] I, for thou  hast called for me;' and he saith, `I called not; turn back,  lie down;' and he goeth and lieth down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And Jehovah addeth to call again Samuel, and Samuel riseth  and goeth unto Eli, and saith, `Here [am] I, for thou hast  called for me;' and he saith, `I have not called, my son, turn  back, lie down.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And Samuel hath not yet known Jehovah, and the word of  Jehovah is not yet revealed unto him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And Jehovah addeth to call Samuel the third time, and he  riseth and goeth unto Eli, and saith, `Here [am] I, for thou  hast called for me;' and Eli understandeth that Jehovah is  calling to the youth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And Eli saith to Samuel, `Go, lie down, and it hath been, if  He doth call unto thee, that thou hast said, Speak, Jehovah,  for Thy servant is hearing;' and Samuel goeth and lieth down in  his place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> And Jehovah cometh, and stationeth Himself, and calleth as  time by time, `Samuel, Samuel;' and Samuel saith, `Speak, for  Thy servant if hearing.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And Jehovah saith unto Samuel, `Lo, I am doing a thing in  Israel, at which the two ears of every one hearing it do  tingle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> In that day I establish unto Eli all that I have spoken  unto his house, beginning and completing;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> and I have declared to him that I am judging his house -- to  the age, for the iniquity which he hath known, for his sons are  making themselves vile, and he hath not restrained them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> and therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli: the  iniquity of the house of Eli is not atoned for, by sacrifice,  and by offering -- unto the age.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And Samuel lieth till the morning, and openeth the doors of  the house of Jehovah, and Samuel is afraid of declaring the  vision unto Eli.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> And Eli calleth Samuel, and saith, `Samuel, my son;' and he  saith, `Here [am] I.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> And he saith, `What [is] the word which He hath spoken unto  thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me; so doth God do to  thee, and so doth He add, if thou hidest from me a word of all  the words that He hath spoken unto thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> And Samuel declareth to him the whole of the words, and  hath not hid from him; and he saith, `It [is] Jehovah; that  which is good in His eyes He doth.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> And Samuel groweth up, and Jehovah hath been with him, and  hath not let fall any of his words to the earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> and all Israel know, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba, that  Samuel is established for a prophet to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> And Jehovah addeth to appear in Shiloh, for Jehovah hath  been revealed unto Samuel, in Shiloh, by the word of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And the word of Samuel is to all Israel, and Israel goeth  out to meet the Philistines for battle, and they encamp by  Eben-Ezer, and the Philistines have encamped in Aphek,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> and the Philistines set themselves in array to meet Israel,  and the battle spreadeth itself, and Israel is smitten before  the Philistines, and they smite among the ranks in the field  about four thousand men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And the people cometh in unto the camp, and the elders of  Israel say, `Why hath Jehovah smitten us to-day before the  Philistines? we take unto us from Shiloh the ark of the  covenant of Jehovah, and it cometh into our midst, and He doth  save us out of the hand of our enemies.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And the people sendeth to Shiloh, and they take up thence  the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of Hosts, inhabiting the  cherubs, and there [are] two sons of Eli, with the ark of the  covenant of God, Hophni and Phinehas.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And it cometh to pass, at the coming in of the ark of the  covenant of Jehovah unto the camp, that all Israel shout -- a  great shout -- and the earth is moved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And the Philistines hear the noise of the shouting, and say,  `What [is] the noise of this great shout in the camp of the  Hebrews?' and they perceive that the ark of Jehovah hath come  in unto the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> And the Philistines are afraid, for they said, `God hath  come in unto the camp;' and they say, `Wo to us, for there hath  not been like this heretofore.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> Wo to us, who doth deliver us out of the hand of these  honourable gods? these [are] the gods who are smiting the  Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> Strengthen yourselves, and become men, O Philistines, lest  ye do service to Hebrews, as they have done to you -- then ye  have become men, and have fought.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And the Philistines fight, and Israel is smitten, and they  flee each to his tents, and the blow is very great, and there  fall of Israel thirty thousand footmen;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> and the ark of God hath been taken, and the two sons of Eli  have died, Hophni and Phinehas.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And a man of Benjamin runneth out of the ranks, and cometh  into Shiloh, on that day, and his long robes [are] rent, and  earth on his head;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> and he cometh in, and lo, Eli is sitting on the throne by  the side of the way, watching, for his heart hath been  trembling for the ark of God, and the man hath come in to  declare [it] in the city, and all the city crieth out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And Eli heareth the noise of the cry, and saith,  `What -- the noise of this tumult!' And the man hasted, and  cometh in, and declareth to Eli.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And Eli is a son of ninety and eight years, and his eyes  have stood, and he hath not been able to see.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> And the man saith unto Eli, `I [am] he who hath come out of  the ranks, and I out of the ranks have fled to-day;' and he  saith, `What hath been the matter, my son?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> And he who is bearing tidings answereth and saith, `Israel  hath fled before the Philistines, and also a great slaughter  hath been among the people, and also thy two sons have  died -- Hophni and Phinehas -- and the ark of God hath been  captured.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And it cometh to pass, at his mentioning the ark of God,  that he falleth from off the throne backward, by the side of  the gate, and his neck is broken, and he dieth, for the man  [is] old and heavy, and he hath judged Israel forty years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And his daughter-in-law, wife of Phinehas, [is] pregnant,  about to bear, and she heareth the report of the taking of the  ark of God, that her father-in-law and her husband have died,  and she boweth, and beareth, for her pains have turned upon  her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> And at the time of her death, when the women who are  standing by her say, `Fear not, for a son thou hast borne,' she  hath not answered, nor set her heart [to it];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> and she calleth the youth I-Chabod, saying, `Honour hath  removed from Israel,' because of the taking of the ark of God,  and because of her father-in-law and her husband.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> And she saith, `Honour hath removed from Israel, for the  ark of God hath been taken.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And the Philistines have taken the ark of God, and bring it  in from Eben-Ezer to Ashdod,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> and the Philistines take the ark of God and bring it into  the house of Dagon, and set it near Dagon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And the Ashdodites rise early on the morrow, and lo, Dagon  is fallen on its face to the earth, before the ark of Jehovah;  and they take Dagon, and put it back to its place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And they rise early in the morning on the morrow, and lo,  Dagon is fallen on its face to the earth, before the ark of  Jehovah, and the head of Dagon, and the two palms of its hands  are cut off at the threshold, only the fishy part hath been  left to him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> therefore the priests of Dagon, and all those coming into  the house of Dagon, tread not on the threshold of Dagon, in  Ashdod, till this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And the hand of Jehovah is heavy on the Ashdodites, and He  maketh them desolate, and smiteth them with emerods, Ashdod and  its borders.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> And the men of Ashdod see that [it is] so, and have said,  `The ark of the God of Israel doth not abide with us, for hard  hath been His hand upon us, and upon Dagon our god.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And they send and gather all the princes of the Philistines  unto them, and say, `What do we do to the ark of the God of  Israel?' and they say, `To Gath let the ark of the God of  Israel be brought round;' and they bring round the ark of the  God of Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> and it cometh to pass after they have brought it round, that  the hand of Jehovah is against the city -- a very great  destruction; and He smiteth the men of the city, from small  even unto great; and break forth on them do emerods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And they send the ark of God to Ekron, and it cometh to  pass, at the coming in of the ark of God to Ekron, that the  Ekronites cry out, saying, `They have brought round unto us the  ark of the God of Israel, to put us to death -- and our people.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And they send and gather all the princes of the  Philistines, and say, `Send away the ark of the God of Israel,  and it turneth back to its place, and it doth not put us to  death -- and our people;' for there hath been a deadly  destruction throughout all the city, very heavy hath the hand  of God been there,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> and the men who have not died have been smitten with  emerods, and the cry of the city goeth up into the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> And the ark of Jehovah is in the field of the Philistines  seven months,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> and the Philistines call for priests and for diviners,  saying, `What do we do to the ark of Jehovah? let us know  wherewith we send it to its place?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And they say, `If ye are sending away the ark of the God of  Israel, ye do not send it away empty; for ye do certainly send  back to Him a guilt-offering; then ye are healed, and it hath  been known to you why His hand doth not turn aside from you.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And they say, `What [is] the guilt-offering which we send  back to Him?' and they say, `The number of the princes of the  Philistines -- five golden emerods, and five golden mice -- for one  plague [is] to you all, and to your princes,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> and ye have made images of your emerods, and images of your  mice that are corrupting the land, and have given honour to the  God of Israel; it may be He doth lighten His hand from off you,  and from off your gods, and from off your land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> and why do ye harden your heart as the Egyptians and Pharaoh  hardened their heart? do they not -- when He hath rolled Himself  upon them -- send them away, and they go?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> `And now, take and make one new cart, and two suckling kine,  on which a yoke hath not gone up, and ye have bound the kine in  the cart, and caused their young ones to turn back from after  them to the house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> and ye have taken the ark of Jehovah, and put it on the  cart, and the vessels of gold which ye have returned to Him -- a  guilt-offering -- ye put in a coffer on its side, and have sent  it away, and it hath gone;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> and ye have seen, if the way of its own border it goeth up  to Beth-Shemesh -- He hath done to us this great evil; and if  not, then we have known that His hand hath not come against us;  an accident it hath been to us.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And the men do so, and take two suckling kine, and bind  them in the cart, and their young ones they have shut up in the  house;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> and they place the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the  coffer, and the golden mice, and the images of their emerods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And the kine go straight in the way, on the way to  Beth-Shemesh, in one highway they have gone, going and lowing,  and have not turned aside right or left; and the princes of the  Philistines are going after them unto the border of  Beth-Shemesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> And the Beth-Shemeshites are reaping their wheat-harvest in  the valley, and they lift up their eyes, and see the ark, and  rejoice to see [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> And the cart hath come in unto the field of Joshua the  Beth-Shemeshite, and standeth there, and there [is] a great  stone, and they cleave the wood of the cart, and the kine they  have caused to ascend -- a burnt-offering to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> And the Levites have taken down the ark of Jehovah, and the  coffer which [is] with it, in which [are] the vessels of gold,  and place [them] on the great stone; and the men of  Beth-Shemesh have caused to ascend burnt-offerings and  sacrifice sacrifices in that day to Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> and the five princes of the Philistines have seen [it], and  turn back [to] Ekron, on that day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> And these [are] the golden emerods which the Philistines  have sent back -- a guilt-offering to Jehovah: for Ashdod one,  for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> and the golden mice -- the number of all the cities of the  Philistines -- for the five princes, from the fenced city even  unto the hamlet of the villages, even unto the great meadow on  which they placed the ark of Jehovah -- [are] unto this day in  the field of Joshua the Beth-Shemeshite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> And He smiteth among the men of Beth-Shemesh, for they  looked into the ark of Jehovah, yea, He smiteth among the  people seventy men -- fifty chief men; and the people mourn,  because Jehovah smote among the people -- a great smiting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> And the men of Beth-Shemesh say, `Who is able to stand  before Jehovah, this holy God? and unto whom doth He go up from  us?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> And they send messengers unto the inhabitants of  Kirjath-Jearim, saying, `The Philistines have sent back the  ark of Jehovah; come down, take it up unto you.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And the men of Kirjath-Jearim come and bring up the ark of  Jehovah, and bring it in unto the house of Abinadab, in the  height, and Eleazar his son they have sanctified to keep the  ark of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> And it cometh to pass, from the day of the dwelling of the  ark in Kirjath-Jearim, that the days are multiplied -- yea, they  are twenty years -- and wail do all the house of Israel after  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> And Samuel speaketh unto all the house of Israel, saying,  `If with all your heart ye are turning back unto Jehovah -- turn  aside the gods of the stranger from your midst, and Ashtaroth;  and prepare your heart unto Jehovah, and serve Him only, and He  doth deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> And the sons of Israel turn aside the Baalim and Ashtaroth,  and serve Jehovah alone;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> and Samuel saith, `Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I pray  for you unto Jehovah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> And they are gathered to Mizpeh, and draw water, and pour  out before Jehovah, and fast on that day, and say there, `We  have sinned against Jehovah;' and Samuel judgeth the sons of  Israel in Mizpeh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> And the Philistines hear that the sons of Israel have  gathered themselves to Mizpeh; and the princes of the  Philistines go up against Israel, and the sons of Israel hear,  and are afraid of the presence of the Philistines.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> And the sons of Israel say unto Samuel, `Keep not silent for  us from crying unto Jehovah our God, and He doth save us out of  the hand of the Philistines.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> And Samuel taketh a fat lamb, and causeth it to go up -- a  burnt-offering whole to Jehovah; and Samuel crieth unto Jehovah  for Israel, and Jehovah answereth him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> and Samuel is causing the burnt-offering to go up -- and the  Philistines have drawn nigh to battle against Israel -- and  Jehovah doth thunder with a great noise, on that day, upon the  Philistines, and troubleth them, and they are smitten before  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> And the men of Israel go out from Mizpeh, and pursue the  Philistines, and smite them unto the place of Beth-Car.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> And Samuel taketh a stone, and setteth [it] between Mizpeh  and Shen, and calleth its name Eben-Ezer, saying, `Hitherto  hath Jehovah helped us.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> And the Philistines are humbled, and have not added any  more to come into the border of Israel, and the hand of Jehovah  is on the Philistines all the days of Samuel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> And the cities which the Philistines have taken from Israel  are restored to Israel -- from Ekron even unto Gath -- and their  border hath Israel delivered out of the hand of the  Philistines; and there is peace between Israel and the Amorite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> And Samuel judgeth Israel all the days of his life,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> and he hath gone from year to year, and gone round Beth-El,  and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel [in] all these  places;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> and his returning [is] to Ramath, for there [is] his  house, and there he hath judged Israel, and he buildeth there  an altar to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And it cometh to pass, when Samuel [is] aged, that he maketh  his sons judges over Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And the name of his first-born son is Joel, and the name of  his second Abiah, judges in Beer-Sheba:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> and his sons have not walked in his ways, and turn aside  after the dishonest gain, and take a bribe, and turn aside  judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> And all the elders of Israel gather themselves together, and  come in unto Samuel to Ramath,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> and say unto him, `Lo, thou hast become aged, and thy sons  have not walked in thy ways; now, appoint to us a king, to  judge us, like all the nations.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> And the thing is evil in the eyes of Samuel, when they have  said, `Give to us a king to judge us;' and Samuel prayeth unto  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> And Jehovah saith unto Samuel, `Hearken to the voice of the  people, to all that they say unto thee, for thee they have not  rejected, but Me they have rejected, from reigning over them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> According to all the works that they have done from the day  of My bringing them up out of Egypt, even unto this day, when  they forsake Me, and serve other gods -- so they are doing also  to thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> And now, hearken to their voice; only, surely thou dost  certainly protest to them, and hast declared to them the custom  of the king who doth reign over them.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> And Samuel speaketh all the words of Jehovah unto the  people who are asking from him a king,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> and saith, `This is the custom of the king who doth reign  over you: Your sons he doth take, and hath appointed for  himself among his chariots, and among his horsemen, and they  have run before his chariots;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> also to appoint for himself heads of thousands, and heads  of fifties; also to plow his plowing, and to reap his reaping;  and to make instruments of his war, and instruments of his  charioteer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> `And your daughters he doth take for perfumers, and for  cooks, and for bakers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> and your fields, and your vineyards, and your  olive-yards -- the best -- he doth take, and hath given to his  servants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And your seed and your vineyards he doth tithe, and hath  given to his eunuchs, and to his servants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> And your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your  young men -- the best, and your asses, he doth take, and hath  prepared for his own work;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> your flock he doth tithe, and ye are to him for servants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> And ye have cried out in that day because of the king whom  ye have chosen for yourselves, and Jehovah doth not answer you  in that day.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> And the people refuse to hearken to the voice of Samuel,  and say, `Nay, but a king is over us,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> and we have been, even we, like all the nations; and our  king hath judged us, and gone out before us, and fought our  battles.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> And Samuel heareth all the words of the people, and  speaketh them in the ears of Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> and Jehovah saith unto Samuel, `Hearken to their voice,  and thou hast caused to reign over them a king.' And Samuel  saith unto the men of Israel, `Go ye each to his city.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And there is a man of Benjamin, and his name [is] Kish, son  of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Bechorath, son of Aphiah, a  Benjamite, mighty of valour,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> and he hath a son, and his name [is] Saul, a choice youth  and goodly, and there is not a man among the sons of Israel  goodlier than he -- from his shoulder and upward, higher than any  of the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And the asses of Kish, father of Saul, are lost, and Kish  saith unto Saul his son, `Take, I pray thee, with thee, one of  the young men, and rise, go, seek the asses.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> And he passeth over through the hill-country of Ephraim, and  passeth over through the land of Shalisha, and they have not  found; and they pass over through the land of Shaalim, and they  are not; and he passeth over through the land of Benjamin, and  they have not found.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> They have come in unto the land of Zuph, and Saul hath said  to his young man who [is] with him, `Come, and we turn back,  lest my father leave off from the asses, and hath been  sorrowful for us.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> And he saith to him, `Lo, I pray thee, a man of God [is] in  this city, and the man is honoured; all that he speaketh doth  certainly come; now, we go there, it may be he doth declare to  us our way on which we have gone.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> And Saul saith to his young man, `And lo, we go, and what do  we bring in to the man? for the bread hath gone from our  vessels, and a present there is not to bring in to the man of  God -- what [is] with us?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And the young man addeth to answer Saul, and saith, `Lo,  there is found with me a fourth of a shekel of silver: and I  have given to the man of God, and he hath declared to us our  way.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> Formerly in Israel, thus said the man in his going to seek  God, `Come and we go unto the seer,' for the `prophet' of  to-day is called formerly `the seer.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And Saul saith to his young man, `Thy word [is] good; come,  we go;' and they go unto the city where the man of God [is].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> They are going up in the ascent of the city, and have found  young women going out to draw water, and say to them, `Is the  seer in this [place]?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> And they answer them and say, `He is; lo, before thee!  haste, now, for to-day he hath come in to the city, for the  people hath a stated sacrifice in a high place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> At your going in to the city so ye do find him, before he  doth go up in to the high place to eat; for the people do not  eat till his coming, for he doth bless the sacrifice;  afterwards they eat, who are called, and now, go up, for at  this time ye find him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> And they go up in to the city; they are coming in to the  midst of the city, and lo, Samuel is coming out to meet them,  to go up to the high place;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> and Jehovah had uncovered the ear of Samuel one day before  the coming of Saul, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> `At this time tomorrow, I send unto thee a man out of the  land of Benjamin -- and thou hast anointed him for leader over My  people Israel, and he hath saved My people out of the hand of  the Philistines; for I have seen My people, for its cry hath  come in unto Me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> When Samuel hath seen Saul, then hath Jehovah answered him,  `Lo, the man of whom I have spoken unto thee; this [one] doth  restrain My people.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> And Saul draweth nigh to Samuel in the midst of the gate,  and saith, `Declare, I pray thee, to me, where [is] this -- the  seer's house?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> And Samuel answereth Saul and saith, `I [am] the seer; go  up before me into the high place, and ye have eaten with me  to-day, and I have sent thee away in the morning, and all that  [is] in thy heart I declare to thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> As to the asses which are lost to thee this day three days,  set not thy heart to them, for they have been found; and to  whom [is] all the desire of Israel?' is it not to thee and to  all thy father's house?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> And Saul answereth and saith, `Am not I a Benjamite -- of the  smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of  all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? and why hast thou  spoken unto me according to this word?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> And Samuel taketh Saul, and his young man, and bringeth  them in to the chamber, and giveth to them a place at the head  of those called; and they [are] about thirty men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> And Samuel saith to the cook, `Give the portion which I  gave to thee, of which I said unto thee, `Set it by thee?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> (and the cook lifteth up the leg, and that which [is] on  it, and setteth before Saul), and he saith, `Lo, that which is  left; set [it] before thee -- eat, for to this appointed season  it is kept for thee, saying, The people I have called;' and  Saul eateth with Samuel on that day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> And they come down from the high place to the city, and he  speaketh with Saul on the roof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> And they rise early, and it cometh to pass, at the  ascending of the dawn, that Samuel calleth unto Saul, on the  roof, saying, `Rise, and I send thee away;' and Saul riseth,  and they go out, both of them -- he and Samuel, without.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> They are going down in the extremity of the city, and  Samuel hath said unto Saul, `Say to the young man that he pass  on before us (and he passeth on), and thou, stand at this time,  and I cause thee to hear the word of God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> And Samuel taketh the vial of the oil, and poureth on his  head, and kisseth him, and saith, `Is it not because Jehovah  hath appointed thee over His inheritance for leader?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> In thy going to-day from me -- then thou hast found two men  by the grave of Rachel, in the border of Benjamin, at Zelzah,  and they have said unto thee, The asses have been found which  thou hast gone to seek; and lo, thy father hath left the matter  of the asses, and hath sorrowed for you, saying, What do I do  for my son?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> `And thou hast passed on thence, and beyond, and hast come  in unto the oak of Tabor, and found thee there have three men  going up unto God to Beth-El, one bearing three kids, and one  bearing three cakes of bread, and one bearing a bottle of wine,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> and they have asked of thee of welfare, and given to thee  two loaves, and thou hast received from their hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> `Afterwards thou dost come unto the hill of God, where the  garrison of the Philistines [is], and it cometh to pass, at thy  coming in thither to the city, that thou hast met a band of  prophets coming down from the high place, and before them  psaltery, and tabret, and pipe, and harp, and they are  prophesying;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> and prospered over thee hath the Spirit of Jehovah, and  thou hast prophesied with them, and hast been turned to another  man;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> and it hath been, when these signs come to thee -- do for  thyself as thy hand findeth, for God [is] with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> `And thou hast gone down before me to Gilgal, and lo, I am  going down unto thee, to cause to ascend burnt-offerings, to  sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings; seven days thou dost  wait till my coming in unto thee, and I have made known to thee  that which thou dost do.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> And it hath been, at his turning his shoulder to go from  Samuel, that God turneth to him another heart, and all these  signs come on that day,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> and they come in thither to the height, and lo, a band of  prophets -- to meet him, and prosper over him doth the Spirit of  God, and he prophesieth in their midst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> And it cometh to pass, all his acquaintance heretofore,  see, and lo, with prophets he hath prophesied, and the people  say one unto another, `What [is] this hath happened to the son  of Kish? is Saul also among the prophets?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> And a man thence answereth and saith, `And who [is] their  father?' therefore it hath been for a simile, `Is Saul also  among the prophets?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> And he ceaseth from prophesying, and cometh in to the high  place,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> and the uncle of Saul saith unto him, and unto his young  man, `Whither went ye?' and he saith, `To seek the asses; and  we see that they are not, and we come in unto Samuel.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> And the uncle of Saul saith, `Declare, I pray thee, to me,  what Samuel said to you?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> And Saul saith unto his uncle, `He certainly declared to  us that the asses were found;' and of the matter of the kingdom  he hath not declared to him that which Samuel said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> And Samuel calleth the people unto Jehovah to Mizpeh,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> and saith unto the sons of Israel, `Thus said Jehovah, God  of Israel, I have brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I deliver  you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of  all the kingdoms who are oppressing you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> and ye to-day have rejected your God, who [is] Himself  your saviour out of all your evils and your distresses, and ye  say, `Nay, but -- a king thou dost set over us; and now, station  yourselves before Jehovah, by your tribes, and by your  thousands.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> And Samuel bringeth near the whole tribes of Israel, and  the tribe of Benjamin is captured,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> and he bringeth near the tribe of Benjamin by its  families, and the family of Matri is captured, and Saul son of  Kish is captured, and they seek him, and he hath not been  found.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> And they ask again at Jehovah, `Hath the man yet come  hither?' and Jehovah saith, `Lo, he hath been hidden near the  vessels.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> And they run and bring him thence, and he stationed  himself in the midst of the people, and he is higher than any  of the people from his shoulder and upward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> And Samuel saith unto all the people, `Have ye seen him on  whom Jehovah hath fixed, for there is none like him among all  the people?' And all the people shout, and say, `Let the king  live!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> And Samuel speaketh unto the people the right of the  kingdom, and writeth in a book, and placeth before Jehovah; and  Samuel sendeth all the people away, each to his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:26">10:26</a> And also Saul hath gone to his house, to Gibeah, and the  force go with him whose heart God hath touched;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:27">10:27</a> and the sons of worthlessness have said, `What! this one  doth save us!' and they despise him, and have not brought to  him a present; and he is as one deaf.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And Nahash the Ammonite cometh up, and encampeth against  Jabesh-Gilead, and all the men of Jabesh say unto Nahash, `Make  with us a covenant, and we serve thee.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> And the messengers come to Gibeah of Saul, and speak the  words in the ears of the people, and all the people lift up  their voice and weep;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> and lo, Saul hath come after the herd out of the field, and  Saul saith, `What -- to the people, that they weep?' and they  recount to him the words of the men of Jabesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> And the Spirit of God doth prosper over Saul, in his  hearing these words, and his anger burneth greatly,</p>

 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> And Saul saith to Ahiah, `Bring nigh the ark of God;' for  the ark of God hath been on that day with the sons of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> And it cometh to pass, while Saul spake unto the priest,  that the noise which [is] in the camp of the Philistines goeth  on, going on and becoming great, and Saul saith unto the  priest, `Remove thy hand.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> And Saul is called, and all the people who [are] with him,  and they come in unto the battle, and, lo, the sword of each  hath been against his neighbour -- a very great destruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> And the Hebrews [who] have been for the Philistines as  heretofore, who had gone up with them into the camp, have  turned round, even they, to be with Israel who [are] with Saul  and Jonathan,</p>

 <p><a name="an_14:24">14:24</a> And the men of Israel have been distressed on that day,  and Saul adjureth the people, saying, `Cursed [is] the man who  eateth food till the evening, and I have been avenged of mine  enemies;' and none of the people hath tasted food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:25">14:25</a> And all [they of] the land have come into a forest, and  there is honey on the face of the field;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:26">14:26</a> and the people come in unto the forest, and lo, the honey  dropped, and none is moving his hand unto his mouth, for the  people feared the oath.</p>

 <p><a name="an_14:32">14:32</a> and the people make unto the spoil, and take sheep, and  oxen, and sons of the herd, and slaughter on the earth, and the  people eat with the blood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:33">14:33</a> And they declare to Saul, saying, `Lo, the people are  sinning against Jehovah, to eat with the blood.' And he saith,  `Ye have dealt treacherously, roll unto me to-day a great  stone.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:34">14:34</a> And Saul saith, `Be ye scattered among the people, and ye  have said to them, Bring ye nigh unto me each his ox, and each  his sheep; and ye have slain [them] in this place, and eaten,  and ye do not sin against Jehovah to eat with the blood.' And  all the people bring nigh each his ox, in his hand, that night,  and slaughter [them] there.</p>

 <p><a name="an_14:37">14:37</a> And Saul asketh of God, `Do I go down after the  Philistines? dost Thou give them into the hand of Israel?'  and He hath not answered him on that day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:38">14:38</a> And Saul saith, `Draw ye nigh hither all, the chiefs of  the people, and know and see in what this sin hath been to-day;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:39">14:39</a> for, Jehovah liveth, who is saving Israel: surely if it  be in Jonathan my son, surely he doth certainly die;' and none  is answering him out of all the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:40">14:40</a> And he saith unto all Israel, `Ye -- ye are on one side,  and I and Jonathan my son are on another side;' and the people  say unto Saul, `That which is good in thine eyes do.'</p>

Jehovah liveth, if there falleth from the hair of his head to  the earth, for with God he hath wrought this day;' and the  people rescue Jonathan, and he hath not died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:46">14:46</a> And Saul goeth up from after the Philistines, and the  Philistines have gone to their place;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:47">14:47</a> and Saul captured the kingdom over Israel, and he fighteth  round about against all his enemies, against Moab, and against  the Bene-Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of  Zobah, and against the Philistines, and whithersoever he  turneth he doth vex [them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:48">14:48</a> And he maketh a force, and smiteth Amalek, and delivereth  Israel out of the hand of its spoiler.</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> And it cometh to pass, in their coming in, in David's  returning from smiting the Philistine, that the women come out  from all the cities of Israel to sing -- also the dancers -- to  meet Saul the king, with tabrets, with joy, and with  three-stringed instruments;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> and the women answer -- those playing, and say, `Saul hath  smitten among his thousands, And David among his myriads.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> And it is displeasing to Saul exceedingly, and this thing  is evil in his eyes, and he saith, `They have given to David  myriads, and to me they have given the thousands, and more to  him [is] only the kingdom;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> and Saul is eyeing David from that day and thenceforth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that the spirit of  sadness [from] God prospereth over Saul, and he prophesieth in  the midst of the house, and David is playing with his hand, as  day by day, and the javelin [is] in the hand of Saul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> and Saul casteth the javelin, and saith, `I smite through  David, even through the wall;' and David turneth round out of  his presence twice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> And Saul is afraid of the presence of David, for Jehovah  hath been with him, and from Saul He hath turned aside;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> and Saul turneth him aside from him, and appointeth him to  himself head of a thousand, and he goeth out an cometh in,  before the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> And David is in all his ways acting wisely, and Jehovah  [is] with him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> and Saul seeth that he is acting very wisely, and is  afraid of him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> and all Israel and Judah love David when he is going out  and coming in before them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> And Saul saith unto David, `Lo, my elder daughter  Merab -- her I give to thee for a wife; only, be to me for a son  of valour, and fight the battles of Jehovah;' and Saul said,  `Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines  be upon him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> And David saith unto Saul, `Who [am] I? and what my  life -- the family of my father in Israel -- that I am son-in-law  to the king?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> And it cometh to pass, at the time of the giving of Merab  daughter of Saul to David, that she hath been given to Adriel  the Meholathite for a wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> And Michal daughter of Saul loveth David, and they declare  to Saul, and the thing is right in his eyes,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> and Saul saith, `I give her to him, and she is to him for  a snare, and the hand of the Philistines is on him;' and Saul  saith unto David, `By the second -- thou dost become my  son-in-law to-day.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> And Saul commandeth his servants, `Speak unto David  gently, saying, Lo, the king hath delighted in thee, and all  his servants have loved thee, and now, be son-in-law to the  king.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> And the servants of Saul speak in the ears of David these  words, and David saith, `Is it a light thing in your eyes to  be son-in-law to the king -- and I a poor man, and lightly  esteemed?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:24">18:24</a> And the servants of Saul declare to him, saying,  `According to these words hath David spoken.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:25">18:25</a> And Saul saith, `Thus do ye say to David, There is no  delight to the king in dowry, but in a hundred foreskins of the  Philistines -- to be avenged on the enemies of the king;' and  Saul thought to cause David to fall by the hand of the  Philistines.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:26">18:26</a> And his servants declare to David these words, and the  thing is right in the eyes of David, to be son-in-law to the  king; and the days have not been full,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:27">18:27</a> and David riseth and goeth, he and his men, and smiteth  among the Philistines two hundred men, and David bringeth in  their foreskins, and they set them before the king, to be  son-in-law to the king; and Saul giveth to him Michal his  daughter for a wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:28">18:28</a> And Saul seeth and knoweth that Jehovah [is] with David,  and Michal daughter of Saul hath loved him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:29">18:29</a> and Saul addeth to be afraid of the presence of David yet;  and Saul is an enemy with David all the days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:30">18:30</a> And the princes of the Philistines come out, and it cometh  to pass from the time of their coming out, David hath acted  more wisely than any of the servants of Saul, and his name is  very precious.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> And Saul speaketh unto Jonathan his son, and unto all his  servants, to put David to death,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> and Jonathan son of Saul delighted exceedingly in David,  and Jonathan declareth to David, saying, `Saul my father is  seeking to put thee to death, and, now, take heed, I pray thee,  in the morning, and thou hast abode in a secret place, and been  hidden,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> and I -- I go out, and have stood by the side of my father in  the field where thou [art], and I speak of thee unto my father,  and have seen what [is coming], and have declared to thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> And Jonathan speaketh good of David unto Saul his father,  and saith unto him, `Let not the king sin against his servant,  against David, because he hath not sinned against thee, and  because his works for thee [are] very good;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> yea, he putteth his life in his hand, and smiteth the  Philistine, and Jehovah worketh a great salvation for all  Israel; thou hast seen, and dost rejoice, and why dost thou sin  against innocent blood, to put David to death for nought?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> And Saul hearkeneth to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul  sweareth, `Jehovah liveth -- he doth not die.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> And Jonathan calleth for David, and Jonathan declareth to  him all these words, and Jonathan bringeth in David unto Saul,  and he is before him as heretofore.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> And there addeth to be war, and David goeth out and  fighteth against the Philistines, and smiteth among them -- a  great smiting, and they flee from his face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> And a spirit of sadness [from] Jehovah is unto Saul, and he  is sitting in his house, and his javelin in his hand, and David  is playing with the hand,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> and Saul seeketh to smite with the javelin through David,  and through the wall, and he freeth himself from the presence  of Saul, and he smiteth the javelin through the wall; and David  hath fled and escapeth during that night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> And Saul sendeth messengers unto the house of David to  watch him, and to put him to death in the morning; and Michal  his wife declareth to David, saying, `If thou art not  delivering thy life to-night -- tomorrow thou art put to death.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> And Michal causeth David to go down through the window,  and he goeth on, and fleeth, and escapeth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> and Michal taketh the teraphim, and layeth on the bed, and  the mattress of goats' [hair] she hath put [for] his pillows,  and covereth with a garment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> And Saul sendeth messengers to take David, and she saith,  `He [is] sick.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> And Saul sendeth the messengers to see David, saying,  `Bring him up in the bed unto me,' -- to put him to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:16">19:16</a> And the messengers come in, and lo, the teraphim [are] on  the bed, and the mattress of goats' [hair], [for] his pillows.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:17">19:17</a> And Saul saith unto Michal, `Why thus hast thou deceived  me -- that thou dost send away mine enemy, and he is escaped?'  and Michal saith unto Saul, `He said unto me, Send me away:  why do I put thee to death?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:18">19:18</a> And David hath fled, and is escaped, and cometh in unto  Samuel to Ramath, and declareth to him all that Saul hath done  to him, and he goeth, he and Samuel, and they dwell in Naioth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:19">19:19</a> And it is declared to Saul, saying, `Lo, David [is] in  Naioth in Ramah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:20">19:20</a> And Saul sendeth messengers to take David, and they see  the assembly of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing,  set over them, and the Spirit of God is on Saul's messengers,  and they prophesy -- they also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:21">19:21</a> And they declare [it] to Saul, and he sendeth other  messengers, and they prophesy -- they also; and Saul addeth and  sendeth messengers a third time, and they prophesy -- they also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:22">19:22</a> And he goeth -- he also -- to Ramath, and cometh in unto the  great well which [is] in Sechu, and asketh, and saith, `Where  [are] Samuel and David?' and [one] saith, `Lo, in Naioth in  Ramah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:23">19:23</a> And he goeth thither -- unto Naioth in Ramah, and the Spirit  of God is upon him -- him also; and he goeth, going on, and he  prophesyeth till his coming in to Naioth in Ramah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:24">19:24</a> and he strippeth off -- he also -- his garments, and  prophesieth -- he also -- before Samuel, and falleth down naked all  that day and all the night; therefore they say, `Is Saul also  among the prophets?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> And David fleeth from Naioth in Ramah, and cometh, and  saith before Jonathan, `What have I done? what [is] mine  iniquity? and what my sin before thy father, that he is  seeking my life?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> And he saith to him, `Far be it! thou dost not die; lo,  my father doth not do anything great or small and doth not  uncover mine ear; and wherefore doth my father hide from me  this thing? this [thing] is not.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> And David sweareth again, and saith, `Thy father hath  certainly known that I have found grace in thine eyes, and he  saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved; and yet,  Jehovah liveth, and thy soul liveth, but -- as a step between me  and death.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> And Jonathan saith to David, `What doth thy soul say? -- and  I do it for thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> And David saith unto Jonathan, `Lo, the new moon [is]  to-morrow; and I do certainly sit with the king to eat; and  thou hast sent me away, and I have been hidden in a field till  the third evening;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> if thy father at all look after me, and thou hast said,  David asked earnestly of me to run to Beth-Lehem his city, for  a sacrifice of the days [is] there for all the family.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> If thus he say: Good; peace [is] for thy servant; and if it  be very displeasing to him -- know that the evil hath been  determined by him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> and thou hast done kindness, to thy servant, for into a  covenant of Jehovah thou hast brought thy servant with  thee; -- and if there is in me iniquity, put thou me to death;  and unto thy father, why is this -- thou dost bring me in?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> And Jonathan saith, `Far be it from thee! for I certainly  do not know that the evil hath been determined by my father to  come upon thee, and I do not declare it to thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> And David saith unto Jonathan, `Who doth declare to me?  or what [if] thy father doth answer thee sharply?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> And Jonathan saith unto David, `Come, and we go out into  the field;' and they go out both of them into the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> And Jonathan saith unto David, `Jehovah, God of  Israel -- when I search my father, about [this] time to-morrow  [or] the third [day], and lo, good [is] towards David, and I  do not then send unto thee, and have uncovered thine ear --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> thus doth Jehovah do to Jonathan, and thus doth He add;  when the evil concerning thee is good to my father, then I have  uncovered thine ear, and sent thee away, and thou hast gone in  peace, and Jehovah is with thee, as he was with my father;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> and not only while I am alive dost thou do with me the  kindness of Jehovah, and I die not,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a> but thou dost not cut off thy kindness from my house unto  the age, nor in Jehovah's cutting off the enemies of David,  each one from off the face of the ground.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a> And Jonathan covenanteth with the house of David, and  Jehovah hath sought [it] from the hand of the enemies of David;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> and Jonathan addeth to cause David to swear, because he  loveth him, for with the love of his own soul he hath loved  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> And Jonathan saith to him, `To-morrow [is] new moon, and  thou hast been looked after, for thy seat is looked after;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:19">20:19</a> and on the third day thou dost certainly come down, and  hast come in unto the place where thou wast hidden in the day  of the work, and hast remained near the stone Ezel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:20">20:20</a> `And I shoot three of the arrows at the side, sending out  for myself at a mark;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:21">20:21</a> and lo, I send the youth: Go, find the arrows. If I at  all say to the youth, Lo, the arrows [are] on this side of  thee -- take them, -- then come thou, for peace [is] for thee,  and there is nothing; Jehovah liveth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:22">20:22</a> And if thus I say to the young man, Lo, the arrows [are]  beyond thee, -- go, for Jehovah hath sent thee away;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:23">20:23</a> as to the thing which we have spoken, I and thou, lo,  Jehovah [is] between me and thee -- unto the age.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:24">20:24</a> And David is hidden in the field, and it is the new moon,  and the king sitteth down by the food to eat,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:25">20:25</a> and the king sitteth on his seat, as time by time, on a  seat by the wall, and Jonathan riseth, and Abner sitteth at the  side of Saul, and David's place is looked after.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:26">20:26</a> And Saul hath not spoken anything on that day, for he  said, `It [is] an accident; he is not clean -- surely not clean.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:27">20:27</a> And it cometh to pass on the second morrow of the new  moon, that David's place is looked after, and Saul saith unto  Jonathan his son, `Wherefore hath the son of Jesse not come in,  either yesterday or to-day, unto the food?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:28">20:28</a> And Jonathan answereth Saul, `David hath been earnestly  asked of me unto Beth-Lehem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:29">20:29</a> and he saith, Send me away, I pray thee, for a family  sacrifice we have in the city, and my brother himself hath  given command to me, and now, if I have found grace in thine  eyes, let me go away, I pray thee, and see my brethren;  therefore he hath not come unto the table of the king.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:30">20:30</a> And the anger of Saul burneth against Jonathan, and he  saith to him, `Son of a perverse rebellious woman! have I not  known that thou art fixing on the son of Jesse to thy shame,  and to the shame of the nakedness of thy mother?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:31">20:31</a> for all the days that the son of Jesse liveth on the  ground thou art not established, thou and thy kingdom; and now,  send and bring him unto me, for he [is] a son of death.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:32">20:32</a> And Jonathan answereth Saul his father, and saith unto  him, `Why is he put to death? what hath he done?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:33">20:33</a> And Saul casteth the javelin at him to smite him, and  Jonathan knoweth that it hath been determined by his father to  put David to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:34">20:34</a> And Jonathan riseth from the table in the heat of anger,  and hath not eaten food on the second day of the new moon, for he  hath been grieved for David, for his father put him to shame.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:35">20:35</a> And it cometh to pass in the morning, that Jonathan goeth  out into the field for the appointment with David, and a little  youth [is] with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:36">20:36</a> And he saith to his youth, `Run, find, I pray thee, the  arrows which I am shooting;' the youth is running, and he hath  shot the arrow, causing [it] to pass over him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:37">20:37</a> And the youth cometh unto the place of the arrow which  Jonathan hath shot, and Jonathan calleth after the youth, and  saith, `Is not the arrow beyond thee?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:38">20:38</a> and Jonathan calleth after the youth, `Speed, haste, stand  not;' and Jonathan's youth gathereth the arrows, and cometh  unto his lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:39">20:39</a> And the youth hath not known anything, only Jonathan and  David knew the word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:40">20:40</a> And Jonathan giveth his weapons unto the youth whom he  hath, and saith to him, `Go, carry into the city.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:41">20:41</a> The youth hath gone, and David hath risen from Ezel, at  the south, and falleth on his face to the earth, and boweth  himself three times, and they kiss one another, and they weep  one with another, till David exerted himself;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:42">20:42</a> and Jonathan saith to David, `Go in peace, in that we  have sworn -- we two -- in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah is  between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed -- unto the  age;' and he riseth and goeth; and Jonathan hath gone in to  the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> And David cometh in to Nob, unto Ahimelech the priest, and  Ahimelech trembleth at meeting David, and saith to him,  `Wherefore [art] thou thyself alone, and no man with thee?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> And David saith to Ahimelech the priest, `The king hath  commanded me a matter, and he saith unto me, Let no man know  anything of the matter about which I am sending thee, and which  I have commanded thee; and the young men I have caused to know  at such and such a place;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> and now, what is there under thy hand? five loaves give  into my hand, or that which is found.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> And the priest answereth David, and saith, `There is no  common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if the  youths have been kept only from women.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> And David answereth the priest, and saith to him, `Surely,  if women have been restrained from us as heretofore in my going  out, then the vessels of the young men are holy, and it [is] a  common way: and also, surely to-day it is sanctified in the  vessel.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> And the priest giveth to him the holy thing, for there was  no bread there except the bread of the Presence which is turned  aside from the presence of Jehovah to put hot bread in the day  of its being taken away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> And there [is] a man of the servants of Saul on that day  detained before Jehovah, and his name [is] Doeg the Edomite,  chief of the shepherds whom Saul hath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> And David saith to Ahimelech, `And is there not here under  thy hand spear or sword? for neither my sword nor my vessels  have I taken in my hand, for the matter of the king was  urgent.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> And the priest saith, `The sword of Goliath the Philistine,  whom thou didst smite in the valley of Elah, lo, it is wrapt in  a garment behind the ephod, if it thou dost take to thyself,  take; for there is none other save it in this [place].' And  David saith, `There is none like it -- give it to me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> And David riseth and fleeth on that day from the face of  Saul, and cometh in unto Achish king of Gath;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> and the servants of Achish say unto him, `Is not this  David king of the land? is it not of this one they sing in  dances, saying, `Saul smote among his thousands, and David  among his myriads?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> And David layeth these words in his heart, and is  exceedingly afraid of the face of Achish king of Gath,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> and changeth his behaviour before their eyes, and feigneth  himself mad in their hand, and scribbleth on the doors of the  gate, and letteth down his spittle unto his beard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> And Achish saith unto his servants, `Lo, ye see a man  acting as a madman; why do ye bring him in unto me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> A lack of madmen [have] I, that ye have brought in this  one to act as a madman by me! doth this one come in unto my  house?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> And David goeth thence, and is escaped unto the cave of  Adullam, and his brethren hear, and all the house of his  father, and go down unto him thither;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> and gather themselves unto him do every man in distress,  and every man who hath an exactor, and every man bitter in  soul, and he is over them for head, and there are with him  about four hundred men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> And David goeth thence to Mizpeh of Moab, and saith unto  the king of Moab, `Let, I pray thee, my father and my mother  go out with you, till that I know what God doth for me;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> and he leadeth them before the king of Moab, and they dwell  with him all the days of David's being in the fortress.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> And Gad the prophet saith unto David, `Thou dost not abide  in a fortress, go, and thou hast entered for thee the land of  Judah;' and David goeth and entereth the forest of Hareth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> And Saul heareth that David hath become known, and the men  who [are] with him, and Saul is abiding in Gibeah, under the  grove in Ramah, and his spear [is] in his hand, and all his  servants standing by him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> And Saul saith to his servants who are standing by him,  `Hear, I pray you, ye Benjamites; also to all of you doth the  son of Jesse give fields and vineyards! all of you he doth  appoint heads of thousands and heads of hundreds!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> for ye have conspired all of you against me, and there is  none uncovering mine ear about my son's covenanting with the  son of Jesse, and there is none of you grieving for me, and  uncovering mine ear, that my son hath raised up my servant  against me, to lie in wait as [at] this day.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> And answer doth Doeg the Edomite, who is set over the  servants of Saul, and saith, `I have seen the son of Jesse  coming in to Nob, unto Ahimelech son of Ahitub,</p>

 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> And the king sendeth to call Ahimelech son of Ahitub, the  priest, and all the house of his father, the priests, who [are]  in Nob, and they come all of them unto the king;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> and Saul saith, `Hear, I pray thee, son of Ahitub;' and  he saith, `Here [am] I, my lord.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> And Saul saith unto him, `Why have ye conspired against  me, thou and the son of Jesse, by thy giving to him bread and a  sword, and to ask for him at God, to rise against me, to lie in  wait, as [at] this day?'</p>

 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> To-day have I begun to ask for him at God? far be it from  me! let not the king lay anything against his servant, against  any of the house of my father, for thy servant hath known  nothing of all this, less or more.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> And the king saith, `Thou dost surely die, Ahimelech,  thou, and all the house of thy father.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> And the king saith to runners, those standing by him,  `Turn round, and put to death the priests of Jehovah, because  their hand also [is] with David, and because they have known  that he is fleeing, and have not uncovered mine ear;' and the  servants of the king have not been willing to put forth their  hand to come against the priests of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> And the king saith to Doeg, `Turn round thou, and come  against the priests;' and Doeg the Edomite turneth round, and  cometh himself against the priests, and putteth to death in  that day eighty and five men bearing a linen ephod,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> and Nob, the city of the priests, he hath smitten by the  mouth of the sword, from man even unto woman, from infant even  unto suckling, and ox, and ass, and sheep, by the mouth of the  sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> And there escapeth one son of Ahimelech, son of Ahitub,  and his name [is] Abiathar, and he fleeth after David,</p>

 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> And David saith to Abiathar, `I have known on that day  when Doeg the Edomite [is] there, that he doth certainly  declare [it] to Saul; I have brought [it] round to every  person of the house of thy father;</p>

 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> And David's men say unto him, `Lo, we here in Judah are  afraid; and how much more when we go to Keilah, unto the ranks  of the Philistines?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> And David addeth again to ask at Jehovah, and Jehovah  answereth him, and saith, `Rise, go down to Keilah, for I am  giving the Philistines into thy hand.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> And David goeth, and his men, to Keilah, and fighteth with  the Philistines, and leadeth away their cattle, and smiteth  among them -- a great smiting, and David saveth the inhabitants  of Keilah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> And it cometh to pass, in the fleeing of Abiathar son of  Ahimelech unto David, to Keilah, an ephod came down in his  hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> And it is declared to Saul that David hath come in to  Keilah, and Saul saith, `God hath made him known for my hand,  for he hath been shut in, to enter into a city of doors and  bar.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> And Saul summoneth the whole of the people to battle, to go  down to Keilah, to lay siege unto David and unto his men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:9">23:9</a> And David knoweth that against him Saul is devising the  evil, and saith unto Abiathar the priest, `Bring nigh the  ephod.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> And David saith, `Jehovah, God of Israel, Thy servant  hath certainly heard that Saul is seeking to come in unto  Keilah, to destroy the city on mine account.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> Do the possessors of Keilah shut me up into his hand?  doth Saul come down as Thy servant hath heard? Jehovah, God of  Israel, declare, I pray Thee, to Thy servant.' And Jehovah  saith, `He doth come down.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> And David saith, `Do the possessors of Keilah shut me up,  and my men, into the hand of Saul?' And Jehovah saith, `They  shut [thee] up.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:13">23:13</a> And David riseth -- and his men -- about six hundred men, and  they go out from Keilah, and go up and down where they go up  and down; and to Saul it hath been declared that David hath  escaped from Keilah, and he ceaseth to go out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> And David abideth in the wilderness, in fortresses, and  abideth in the hill-country, in the wilderness of Ziph; and  Saul seeketh him all the days, and God hath not given him into  his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> And David seeth that Saul hath come out to seek his life,  and David [is] in the wilderness of Ziph, in a forest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:16">23:16</a> And Jonathan son of Saul riseth, and goeth unto David to  the forest, and strengtheneth his hand in God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:17">23:17</a> and saith unto him, `Fear not, for the hand of Saul my  father doth not find thee, and thou dost reign over Israel, and  I am to thee for second, and also so knoweth Saul my father.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:18">23:18</a> And they make a covenant both of them before Jehovah; and  David abideth in the forest, and Jonathan hath gone to his  house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:19">23:19</a> And the Ziphites go up unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, `Is  not David hiding himself with us in fortresses, in the forest,  in the height of Hachilah, which [is] on the south of the  desolate place?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:20">23:20</a> And, now, by all the desire of thy soul, O king, to come  down, come down, and ours [is] to shut him up into the hand of  the king.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:21">23:21</a> And Saul saith, `Blessed [are] ye of Jehovah, for ye have  pity on me;</p>

 <p><a name="an_23:24">23:24</a> And they rise and go to Ziph before Saul, and David and  his men [are] in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain, at the  south of the desolate place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:25">23:25</a> And Saul and his men go to seek, and they declare to  David, and he goeth down the rock, and abideth in the  wilderness of Maon; and Saul heareth, and pursueth after David  [to] the wilderness of Maon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:26">23:26</a> And Saul goeth on this side of the mountain, and David and  his men on that side of the mountain, and David is hastened to  go from the face of Saul, and Saul and his men are compassing  David and his men, to catch them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:27">23:27</a> And a messenger hath come in unto Saul, saying, `Haste,  and come, for the Philistines have pushed against the land.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:28">23:28</a> And Saul turneth back from pursuing after David, and goeth  to meet the Philistines, therefore they have called that place  `The Rock of Divisions.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:29">23:29</a> And David goeth up thence, and abideth in fortresses [at]  En-gedi.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> And it cometh to pass when Saul hath turned back from after  the Philistines, that they declare to him, saying, `Lo, David  [is] in the wilderness of En-gedi.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> And Saul taketh three thousand chosen men out of all  Israel, and goeth to seek David and his men, on the front of  the rocks of the wild goats,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> and he cometh in unto folds of the flock, on the way, and  there [is] a cave, and Saul goeth in to cover his feet; and  David and his men in the sides of the cave are abiding.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> And the men of David say unto him, `Lo, the day of which  Jehovah said unto thee, Lo, I am giving thine enemy into thy  hand, and thou hast done to him as it is good in thine eyes;'  and David riseth and cutteth off the skirt of the upper robe  which [is] on Saul -- gently.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> And it cometh to pass afterwards that the heart of David  smiteth him, because that he hath cut off the skirt which [is]  on Saul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> and he saith to his men, `Far be it from me, by Jehovah;  I do not do this thing to my lord -- to the anointed of  Jehovah -- to put forth my hand against him, for the anointed of  Jehovah he [is].'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> And David subdueth his men by words, and hath not permitted  them to rise against Saul; and Saul hath risen from the cave,  and goeth on the way;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:8">24:8</a> and David riseth afterwards, and goeth out from the cave,  and calleth after Saul, saying, `My lord, O king!' And Saul  looketh attentively behind him, and David boweth -- face to the  earth -- and doth obeisance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:9">24:9</a> And David saith to Saul, `Why dost thou hear the words of  man, saying, Lo, David is seeking thine evil?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> Lo, this day have thine eyes seen how that Jehovah hath  given thee to-day into my hand in the cave; and [one] said to  slay thee, and [mine eye] hath pity on thee, and I say, I do  not put forth my hand against my lord, for the anointed of  Jehovah he [is].</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:16">24:16</a> And it cometh to pass, when David completeth to speak  these words unto Saul, that Saul saith, `Is this thy voice, my  son David?' and Saul lifteth up his voice, and weepeth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:17">24:17</a> And he saith unto David, `More righteous thou [art] than  I; for thou hast done me good, and I have done thee evil;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:18">24:18</a> and thou hast declared to-day how that thou hast done good  with me, how that Jehovah shut me up into thy hand, and thou  didst not slay me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:19">24:19</a> and that a man doth find his enemy, and hath sent him away  in a good manner; and Jehovah doth repay thee good for that  which thou didst to me this day.</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:22">24:22</a> And David sweareth to Saul, and Saul goeth unto his  house, and David and his men have gone up unto the fortress.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:1">25:1</a> And Samuel dieth, and all Israel are gathered, and mourn  for him, and bury him in his house, in Ramah; and David riseth  and goeth down unto the wilderness of Paran.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:2">25:2</a> And [there is] a man in Maon, and his work [is] in Carmel;  and the man [is] very great, and he hath three thousand sheep,  and a thousand goats; and he is shearing his flock in Carmel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:3">25:3</a> And the name of the man [is] Nabal, and the name of his  wife Abigail, and the woman [is] of good understanding, and of  fair form, and the man [is] hard and evil [in] doings; and he  [is] a Calebite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:4">25:4</a> And David heareth in the wilderness that Nabal is shearing  his flock,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:5">25:5</a> and David sendeth ten young men, and David saith to the  young men, `Go ye up to Carmel, and ye have come in unto  Nabal, and asked of him in my name of welfare,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:6">25:6</a> and said thus: To life! and thou, peace; and thy house,  peace; and all that thou hast -- peace!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:7">25:7</a> and, now, I have heard that thou hast shearers; now, the  shepherds whom thou hast have been with us, we have not put  them to shame, nor hath anything been looked after by them, all  the days of their being in Carmel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:8">25:8</a> `Ask thy young men, and they declare to thee, and the young  men find grace in thine eyes, for on a good day we have come;  give, I pray thee, that which thy hand findeth, to thy  servants, and to thy son, to David.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:9">25:9</a> And the young men of David come in, and speak unto Nabal  according to all these words, in the name of David -- and rest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:10">25:10</a> And Nabal answereth the servants of David and saith, `Who  [is] David, and who the son of Jesse? to-day have servants  been multiplied who are breaking away each from his master;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:11">25:11</a> and I have taken my bread, and my water, and my flesh,  which I slaughtered for my shearers, and have given [it] to men  whom I have not known whence they [are]!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:12">25:12</a> And the young men of David turn on their way, and turn  back, and come in, and declare to him according to all these  words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:13">25:13</a> And David saith to his men, `Gird ye on each his sword;'  and they gird on each his sword, and David also girdeth on his  sword, and there go up after David about four hundred men, and  two hundred have remained by the vessels.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:14">25:14</a> And to Abigail wife of Nabal hath one young man of the  youths declared, saying, `Lo, David hath sent messengers out  of the wilderness to bless our lord, and he flieth upon them;</p>

 <p><a name="an_25:19">25:19</a> And she saith to her young men, `Pass over before me;  lo, after you I am coming;' and to her husband Nabal she hath  not declared [it];</p>

 <p><a name="an_25:21">25:21</a> And David said, `Only, in vain I have kept all that this  [one] hath in the wilderness, and nothing hath been looked  after of all that he hath, and he turneth back to me evil for  good;</p>

 <p><a name="an_25:23">25:23</a> And Abigail seeth David, and hasteth and cometh down from  off the ass, and falleth before David on her face, and boweth  herself to the earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:24">25:24</a> and falleth at his feet and saith, `On me, my lord, the  iniquity; and let, I pray thee, thy handmaid speak in thine  ear, and hear the words of thy handmaid.</p>

 <p><a name="an_25:26">25:26</a> and now, my lord, Jehovah liveth, and thy soul liveth, in  that Jehovah hath withheld thee from coming in with blood, and  to save thy hand to thee -- now let thine enemies be as Nabal,  even those seeking evil unto my lord.</p>

 <p><a name="an_25:32">25:32</a> And David saith to Abigail, `Blessed [is] Jehovah, God of  Israel, who hath sent thee this day to meet me,</p>

 <p><a name="an_25:35">25:35</a> And David receiveth from her hand that which she hath  brought to him, and to her he hath said, `Go up in peace to  thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and accept thy  face.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:36">25:36</a> And Abigail cometh in unto Nabal, and lo, he hath a  banquet in his house, like a banquet of the king, and the heart  of Nabal [is] glad within him, and he [is] drunk unto excess,  and she hath not declared to him anything, less or more, till  the light of the morning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:37">25:37</a> And it cometh to pass in the morning, when the wine is  gone out from Nabal, that his wife declareth to him these  things, and his heart dieth within him, and he hath been as a  stone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:38">25:38</a> And it cometh to pass, [in] about ten days, that Jehovah  smiteth Nabal, and he dieth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:39">25:39</a> and David heareth that Nabal [is] dead, and saith,  `Blessed [is] Jehovah who hath pleaded the cause of my reproach  from the hand of Nabal, and His servant hath kept back from  evil, and the wickedness of Nabal hath Jehovah turned back on  his own head;' and David sendeth and speaketh with Abigail, to  take her to him for a wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:40">25:40</a> And the servants of David come in unto Abigail at Carmel,  and speak unto her, saying, `David hath sent us unto thee to  take thee to him for a wife.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_26:3">26:3</a> And Saul encampeth in the height of Hachilah, which [is] on  the front of the desert, by the way, and David is abiding in  the wilderness, and he seeth that Saul hath come after him in  to the wilderness;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:4">26:4</a> and David sendeth spies, and knoweth that Saul hath come  unto Nachon,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:5">26:5</a> and David riseth, and cometh in unto the place where Saul  hath encamped, and David seeth the place where Saul hath lain,  and Abner son of Ner, head of his host, and Saul is lying in  the path, and the people are encamping round about him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:6">26:6</a> And David answereth and saith unto Ahimelech the Hittite,  and unto Abishai son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, `Who  doth go down with me unto Saul, unto the camp?' and Abishai  saith, `I -- I go down with thee.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_28:9">28:9</a> And the woman saith unto him, `Lo, thou hast known that  which Saul hath done, that he hath cut off those having  familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land; and why  art thou laying a snare for my soul -- to put me to death?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:10">28:10</a> And Saul sweareth to her by Jehovah, saying, `Jehovah  liveth, punishment doth not meet thee for this thing.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_28:13">28:13</a> And the king saith to her, `Do not fear; for what hast  thou seen?' and the woman saith unto Saul, `Gods I have seen  coming up out of the earth.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:14">28:14</a> And he saith to her, `What [is] his form?' and she  saith, `An aged man is coming up, and he [is] covered with an  upper robe;' and Saul knoweth that he [is] Samuel, and  boweth -- face to thee earth -- and doth obeisance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:15">28:15</a> And Samuel saith unto Saul, `Why hast thou troubled me,  to bring me up?' And Saul saith, `I have great distress, and  the Philistines are fighting against me, God hath turned aside  from me, and hath not answered me any more, either by the hand  of the prophets, or by dreams; and I call for thee to let me  know what I do.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_29:4">29:4</a> And the heads of the Philistines are wroth against him, and  the heads of the Philistines say to him, `Send back the man,  and he doth turn back unto his place whither thou hast  appointed him, and doth not go down with us into battle, and is  not to us for an adversary in battle; and wherewith doth this  one reconcile himself unto his lord -- is it not with the heads  of those men?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:5">29:5</a> Is not this David, of whom they answer in choruses, saying,  Saul hath smitten among his thousands, and David among his  myriads?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:6">29:6</a> And Achish calleth unto David, and saith unto him,  `Jehovah liveth, surely thou [art] upright, and good in mine  eyes is thy going out, and thy coming in, with me in the camp,  for I have not found in thee evil from the day of thy coming in  unto me till this day; and in the eyes of the princes thou art  not good;</p>

 <p><a name="an_30:12">30:12</a> and give to him a piece of a bunch of dried figs, and two  bunches of raisins, and he eateth, and his spirit returneth unto  him, for he hath not eaten bread nor drunk water three days and  three nights.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:13">30:13</a> And David saith to him, `Whose [art] thou? and whence  [art] thou?' And he saith, `An Egyptian youth I [am], servant  to a man, an Amalekite, and my lord forsaketh me, for I have  been sick three days,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:14">30:14</a> we pushed [to] the south of the Cherethite, and against  that which [is] to Judah, and against the south of Caleb, and  Ziklag we burned with fire.'</p>
