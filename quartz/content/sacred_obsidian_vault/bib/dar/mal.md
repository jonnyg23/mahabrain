  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Malachi</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel by Malachi.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> I have loved you, saith Jehovah; but ye say, Wherein hast  thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith Jehovah, and  I loved Jacob,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> and I hated Esau; and made his mountains a desolation, and  [gave] his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> If Edom say, We are broken down, but we will build again the  ruined places, -- thus saith Jehovah of hosts: They shall  build, but I will throw down; and [men] shall call them the  territory of wickedness, and the people against whom Jehovah  hath indignation for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And your eyes shall see [it], and ye shall say, Jehovah is  magnified beyond the border of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> A son honoureth [his] father, and a servant his master: if  then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master,  where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, priests,  that despise my name. But ye say, Wherein have we despised thy  name?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein  have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is  contemptible.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And  if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? Present it now  unto thy governor: will he be pleased with thee? or will he  accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And now, I pray you, beseech ùGod that he will be gracious  unto us. This hath been of your hand: will he accept any of  your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Who is there among you that would even shut the doors? and  ye would not kindle [fire] on mine altar for nothing. I have no  delight in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept  an oblation at your hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> For from the rising of the sun even unto its setting my  name shall be great among the nations; and in every place  incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure oblation: for  my name shall be great among the nations, saith Jehovah of  hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of the Lord is  polluted; and the fruit thereof, his food, is contemptible.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And ye say, Behold, what a weariness! And ye have puffed at  it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and ye bring [that which was] torn,  and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the oblation: should  I accept this of your hand? saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> Yea, cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male,  and voweth and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing; for I  am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is  terrible among the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And now, ye priests, this commandment is for you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> If ye do not hear, and if ye do not lay [it] to heart, to  give glory unto my name, saith Jehovah of hosts, I will even  send the curse among you, and I will curse your blessings: yea,  I have already cursed them, because ye do not lay [it] to  heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and spread dung upon your  faces, the dung of your feasts; and they shall take you away  with it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto  you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith Jehovah of  hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> My covenant with him was of life and peace, and I gave them  to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and trembled  before my name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was  not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and  uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his  mouth they seek the law; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of  hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to  stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi,  saith Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And I also have made you contemptible and base before all  the people, because ye have not kept my ways, but have respect  of persons in [administering] the law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Have we not all one father? Hath not one ùGod created us?  Why do we deal unfaithfully every man against his brother, by  profaning the covenant of our fathers?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Judah hath dealt unfaithfully, and an abomination is  committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned  the sanctuary of Jehovah which he loved, and hath married the  daughter of a strange ùgod.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> Jehovah will cut off from the tents of Jacob the man that  doeth this, him that calleth and him that answereth; and him  that offereth an oblation unto Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And further ye do this: ye cover the altar of Jehovah with  tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he  regardeth not the oblation any more, nor receiveth [it] with  satisfaction at your hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because Jehovah hath been a witness  between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast  dealt unfaithfully: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of  thy covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And did not one make [them]? and the remnant of the Spirit  was his. And wherefore the one? He sought a seed of God. Take  heed then to your spirit, and let none deal unfaithfully  against the wife of his youth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> (for I hate putting away, saith Jehovah the God of Israel;)  and he covereth with violence his garment, saith Jehovah of  hosts: take heed then to your spirit, that ye deal not  unfaithfully.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words, and ye say,  Wherein have we wearied [him]? In that ye say, Every one that  doeth evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and he delighteth  in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way  before me; and the Lord whom ye seek will suddenly come to his  temple, and the Angel of the covenant, whom ye delight in:  behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> But who shall endure the day of his coming? and who shall  stand when he appeareth? For he will be like a refiner's fire,  and like fullers' lye.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And he shall sit [as] a refiner and purifier of silver; and  he will purify the children of Levi, and purge them as gold and  silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah an oblation in  righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> Then shall the oblation of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant  unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a  swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the  adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those  that oppress the hired servant in [his] wages, the widow and  the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger [from his  right], and fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> For I Jehovah change not, and ye, sons of Jacob, are not  consumed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Since the days of your fathers have ye departed from my  statutes, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will  return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein  shall we return?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Will a man rob God? But ye rob me. And ye say, Wherein do we  rob thee? [In] tithes and heave-offerings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Ye are cursed with a curse; and me ye rob, [even] this whole  nation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house, that there  may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith  Jehovah of hosts, if I open not to you the windows of the  heavens, and pour you out a blessing, till there be no place  for it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall  not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine  cast its fruit before the time in the field, saith Jehovah of  hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And all nations shall call you blessed; for ye shall be a  delightsome land, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah; but  ye say, What have we been speaking against thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> Ye say, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that  we keep his charge, and that we walk mournfully before Jehovah  of hosts?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And now we hold the proud for happy; yea, they that work  wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and they escape.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another;  and Jehovah observed [it], and heard, and a book of remembrance  was written before him for them that feared Jehovah, and that  thought upon his name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> And they shall be unto me a peculiar treasure, saith  Jehovah of hosts, in the day that I prepare; and I will spare  them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> And ye shall return and discern between the righteous and  the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth  him not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> For behold, the day cometh, burning as a furnace; and all  the proud and all that work wickedness shall be stubble; and  the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith Jehovah of hosts,  so that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of  righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go  forth and leap like fatted calves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes  under the soles of your feet in the day that I prepare, saith  Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto  him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and ordinances.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Behold, I send unto you Elijah the prophet, before the  coming of the great and terrible day of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,  and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and  smite the earth with a curse.</p>
