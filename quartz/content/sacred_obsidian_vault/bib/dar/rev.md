  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Revelation</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew  to his bondmen what must shortly take place; and he signified  [it], sending by his angel, to his bondman John,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus  Christ, all things that he saw.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Blessed [is] he that reads, and they that hear the words of  the prophecy, and keep the things written in it; for the time  [is] near.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> John to the seven assemblies which [are] in Asia: Grace to  you and peace from [him] who is, and who was, and who is to  come; and from the seven Spirits which [are] before his throne;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn  from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To him  who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him  [be] the glory and the might to the ages of ages. Amen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Behold, he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see  him, and they which have pierced him, and all the tribes of the  land shall wail because of him. Yea. Amen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith [the] Lord God, he who  is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation  and kingdom and patience, in Jesus, was in the island called  Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> I became in [the] Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard  behind me a great voice as of a trumpet,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> saying, What thou seest write in a book, and send to the  seven assemblies: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos,  and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to  Laodicea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And I turned back to see the voice which spoke with me; and  having turned, I saw seven golden lamps,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> and in the midst of the [seven] lamps [one] like [the] Son  of man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girt  about at the breasts with a golden girdle:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> his head and hair white like white wool, as snow; and his  eyes as a flame of fire;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> and his feet like fine brass, as burning in a furnace; and  his voice as the voice of many waters;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> and having in his right hand seven stars; and out of his  mouth a sharp two-edged sword going forth; and his countenance  as the sun shines in its power.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid  his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; *I* am the first and  the last,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am  living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of  hades.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> Write therefore what thou hast seen, and the things that  are, and the things that are about to be after these.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> The mystery of the seven stars which thou hast seen on my  right hand, and the seven golden lamps. -- The seven stars are  angels of the seven assemblies; and the seven lamps are seven  assemblies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write: These things  says he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks  in the midst of the seven golden lamps:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> I know thy works and [thy] labour, and thine endurance, and  that thou canst not bear evil [men]; and thou hast tried them  who say that themselves [are] apostles and are not, and hast  found them liars;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> and endurest, and hast borne for my name's sake, and hast  not wearied:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> but I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent, and  do the first works: but if not, I am coming to thee, and I will  remove thy lamp out of its place, except thou shalt repent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the  Nicolaitanes, which *I* also hate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the  assemblies. To him that overcomes, I will give to him to eat of  the tree of life which is in the paradise of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And to the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write: These  things says the first and the last, who became dead, and lived:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> I know thy tribulation and thy poverty; but thou art rich;  and the railing of those who say that they themselves are Jews,  and are not, but a synagogue of Satan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Fear nothing [of] what thou art about to suffer. Behold,  the devil is about to cast of you into prison, that ye may be  tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful  unto death, and I will give to thee the crown of life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to  the assemblies. He that overcomes shall in no wise be injured  of the second death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And to the angel of the assembly in Pergamos write: These  things says he that has the sharp two-edged sword:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> I know where thou dwellest, where the throne of Satan [is];  and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith,  even in the days in which Antipas my faithful witness [was],  who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> But I have a few things against thee: that thou hast there  those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast  a snare before the sons of Israel, to eat [of] idol sacrifices  and commit fornication.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> So thou also hast those who hold the doctrine of  Nicolaitanes in like manner.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> Repent therefore: but if not, I come to thee quickly, and I  will make war with them with the sword of my mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to  the assemblies. To him that overcomes, to him will I give of  the hidden manna; and I will give to him a white stone, and on  the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he that  receives [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And to the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write: These  things says the Son of God, he that has his eyes as a flame of  fire, and his feet [are] like fine brass:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> I know thy works, and love, and faith, and service, and  thine endurance, and thy last works [to be] more than the  first.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> But I have against thee that thou permittest the woman  Jezebel, she who calls herself prophetess, and she teaches and  leads astray my servants to commit fornication and eat of idol  sacrifices.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And I gave her time that she should repent, and she will  not repent of her fornication.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those that commit  adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of  her works,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> and her children will I kill with death; and all the  assemblies shall know that *I* am he that searches [the] reins  and [the] hearts; and I will give to you each according to your  works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> But to you I say, the rest who [are] in Thyatira, as many  as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of  Satan, as they say, I do not cast upon you any other burden;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> but what ye have hold fast till I shall come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> And he that overcomes, and he that keeps unto the end my  works, to him will I give authority over the nations,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> and he shall shepherd them with an iron rod; as vessels of  pottery are they broken in pieces, as I also have received from  my Father;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> and I will give to him the morning star.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to  the assemblies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And to the angel of the assembly in Sardis write: These  things saith he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the  seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou  livest, and art dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> Be watchful, and strengthen the things that remain, which  are about to die, for I have not found thy works complete  before my God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and  keep [it] and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will  come [upon thee] as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what  hour I shall come upon thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> But thou hast a few names in Sardis which have not defiled  their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, because  they are worthy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> He that overcomes, *he* shall be clothed in white garments,  and I will not blot his name out of the book of life, and will  confess his name before my Father and before his angels.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the  assemblies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And to the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write:  These things saith the holy, the true; he that has the key of  David, he who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one  shall open:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an opened  door, which no one can shut, because thou hast a little power,  and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that  they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that  they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall  know that *I* have loved thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, *I* also  will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come  upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the  earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> I come quickly: hold fast what thou hast, that no one take  thy crown.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> He that overcomes, him will I make a pillar in the temple  of my God, and he shall go no more at all out; and I will write  upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my  God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my  God, and my new name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to  the assemblies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And to the angel of the assembly in Laodicea write: These  things says the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the  beginning of the creation of God:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I  would thou wert cold or hot.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Thus because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I  am about to spue thee out of my mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> Because thou sayest, I am rich, and am grown rich, and have  need of nothing, and knowest not that *thou* art the wretched  and the miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified by fire, that  thou mayest be rich; and white garments, that thou mayest be  clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not be made  manifest; and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest  see.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> I rebuke and discipline as many as I love; be zealous  therefore and repent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking; if any one  hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him and  sup with him, and he with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> He that overcomes, to him will I give to sit with me in my  throne; as *I* also have overcome, and have sat down with my  Father in his throne.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to  the assemblies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in  heaven, and the first voice which I heard as of a trumpet  speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will shew thee  the things which must take place after these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> Immediately I became in [the] Spirit; and behold, a throne  stood in the heaven, and upon the throne one sitting,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> and he [that was] sitting like in appearance to a stone [of]  jasper and a sardius, and a rainbow round the throne like in  appearance to an emerald.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And round the throne twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones  twenty-four elders sitting, clothed with white garments; and on  their heads golden crowns.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And out of the throne go forth lightnings, and voices, and  thunders; and seven lamps of fire, burning before the throne,  which are the seven Spirits of God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> and before the throne, as a glass sea, like crystal. And in  the midst of the throne, and around the throne, four living  creatures, full of eyes, before and behind;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> and the first living creature like a lion, and the second  living creature like a calf, and the third living creature  having the face as of a man, and the fourth living creature  like a flying eagle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And the four living creatures, each one of them having  respectively six wings; round and within they are full of eyes;  and they cease not day and night saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord  God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And when the living creatures shall give glory and honour  and thanksgiving to him that sits upon the throne, who lives to  the ages of ages,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> the twenty-four elders shall fall before him that sits upon  the throne, and do homage to him that lives to the ages of  ages; and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> Thou art worthy, O our Lord and [our] God, to receive glory  and honour and power; for *thou* hast created all things, and  for thy will they were, and they have been created.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And I saw on the right hand of him that sat upon the throne  a book, written within and on the back, sealed with seven  seals.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who  [is] worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And no one was able in the heaven, or upon the earth, or  underneath the earth, to open the book, or to regard it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And *I* wept much because no one had been found worthy to  open the book nor to regard it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> And one of the elders says to me, Do not weep. Behold, the  lion which [is] of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, has  overcome [so as] to open the book, and its seven seals.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living  creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as  slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven  Spirits of God [which are] sent into all the earth:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> and it came and took [it] out of the right hand of him that  sat upon the throne.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And when it took the book, the four living creatures and the  twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, having each a harp and  golden bowls full of incenses, which are the prayers of the  saints.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> And they sing a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take  the book, and to open its seals; because thou hast been slain,  and hast redeemed to God, by thy blood, out of every tribe, and  tongue, and people, and nation,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> and made them to our God kings and priests; and they shall  reign over the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And I saw, and I heard [the] voice of many angels around  the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and their  number was ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of  thousands;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that has been  slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength,  and honour, and glory, and blessing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> And every creature which is in the heaven and upon the  earth and under the earth, and [those that are] upon the sea,  and all things in them, heard I saying, To him that sits upon  the throne, and to the Lamb, blessing, and honour, and glory,  and might, to the ages of ages.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> And the four living creatures said, Amen; and the elders  fell down and did homage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I  heard one of the four living creatures saying, as a voice of  thunder, Come [and see].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> And I saw: and behold, a white horse, and he that sat upon  it having a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went  forth conquering and that he might conquer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And when it opened the second seal, I heard the second  living creature saying, Come [and see].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And another, a red horse, went forth; and to him that sat  upon it, to him it was given to take peace from the earth, and  that they should slay one another; and there was given to him a  great sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And when it opened the third seal, I heard the third living  creature saying, Come [and see]. And I saw: and behold, a black  horse, and he that sat upon it having a balance in his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> And I heard as a voice in the midst of the four living  creatures saying, A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three  choenixes of barley for a denarius: and do not injure the oil  and the wine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And when it opened the fourth seal, I heard [the voice of]  the fourth living creature saying, Come [and see].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And I saw: and behold, a pale horse, and he that sat upon  it, his name [was] Death, and hades followed with him; and  authority was given to him over the fourth of the earth to slay  with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and by the beasts  of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And when it opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the  altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of  God, and for the testimony which they held;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O  sovereign Ruler, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge  our blood on them that dwell upon the earth?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> And there was given to them, to each one a white robe; and  it was said to them that they should rest yet a little while,  until both their fellow-bondmen and their brethren, who were  about to be killed as they, should be fulfilled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And I saw when it opened the sixth seal, and there was a  great earthquake; and the sun became black as hair sackcloth,  and the whole moon became as blood,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> and the stars of heaven fell upon the earth, as a fig tree,  shaken by a great wind, casts its unseasonable figs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> And the heaven was removed as a book rolled up, and every  mountain and island were removed out of their places.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> And the kings of the earth, and the great, and the  chiliarchs, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman and  freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the  mountains;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us,  and have us hidden from [the] face of him that sits upon the  throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> because the great day of his wrath is come, and who is able  to stand?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And after this I saw four angels standing upon the four  corners of the earth, holding fast the four winds of the earth,  that no wind might blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor  upon any tree.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> And I saw another angel ascending from [the] sunrising,  having [the] seal of [the] living God; and he cried with a loud  voice to the four angels to whom it had been given to hurt the  earth and the sea,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees,  until we shall have sealed the bondmen of our God upon their  foreheads.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> And I heard the number of the sealed, a hundred [and]  forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of [the] sons of  Israel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> out of [the] tribe of Juda, twelve thousand sealed; out of  [the] tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand; out of [the] tribe of  Gad, twelve thousand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> out of [the] tribe of Aser, twelve thousand; out of [the]  tribe of Nepthalim, twelve thousand; out of [the] tribe of  Manasseh, twelve thousand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> out of [the] tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand; out of [the]  tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; out of [the] tribe of Issachar,  twelve thousand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> out of [the] tribe of Zabulun, twelve thousand; out of [the]  tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; out of [the] tribe of  Benjamin, twelve thousand sealed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> After these things I saw, and lo, a great crowd, which no  one could number, out of every nation and tribes and peoples  and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb,  clothed with white robes, and palm branches in their hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And they cry with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our  God who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> And all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders,  and the four living creatures, and fell before the throne upon  their faces, and worshipped God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and  thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and strength, to our God,  to the ages of ages. Amen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> And one of the elders answered, saying to me, These who are  clothed with white robes, who are they, and whence came they?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> And I said to him, My lord, *thou* knowest. And he said to  me, These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and  have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood  of the Lamb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him  day and night in his temple, and he that sits upon the throne  shall spread his tabernacle over them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> They shall not hunger any more, neither shall they thirst  any more, nor shall the sun at all fall on them, nor any  burning heat;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> because the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall  shepherd them, and shall lead them to fountains of waters of  life, and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And when it opened the seventh seal, there was silence in  the heaven about half an hour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven  trumpets were given to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a  golden censer; and much incense was given to him, that he might  give [efficacy] to the prayers of all saints at the golden  altar which [was] before the throne.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the  saints, out of the hand of the angel before God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And the angel took the censer, and filled it from the fire  of the altar, and cast [it] on the earth: and there were  voices, and thunders and lightnings, and an earthquake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared  themselves that they might sound with [their] trumpets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> And the first sounded [his] trumpet: and there was hail and  fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth;  and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third  part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt  up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> And the second angel sounded [his] trumpet: and as a great  mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea, and the third  part of the sea became blood;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea  which had life died; and the third part of the ships were  destroyed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> And the third angel sounded [his] trumpet: and there fell  out of the heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell  upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of  waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third  part of the waters became wormwood, and many of the men died of  the waters because they were made bitter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> And the fourth angel sounded [his] trumpet: and the third  part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon,  and the third part of the stars; so that the third part of them  should be darkened, and that the day should not appear [for]  the third part of it, and the night the same.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven,  saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to them that dwell  upon the earth, for the remaining voices of the trumpet of the  three angels who are about to sound.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And the fifth angel sounded [his] trumpet: and I saw a star  out of the heaven fallen to the earth; and there was given to  it the key of the pit of the abyss.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> And it opened the pit of the abyss; and there went up smoke  out of the pit as [the] smoke of a great furnace; and the sun  and the air were darkened with the smoke of the pit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth, and  power was given to them as the scorpions of the earth have  power;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> and it was said to them, that they should not injure the  grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but the  men who have not the seal of God on their foreheads:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> and it was given to them that they should not kill them, but  that they should be tormented five months; and their torment  [was] as [the] torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> And in those days shall men seek death, and shall in no way  find it; and shall desire to die, and death flees from them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> And the likenesses of the locusts [were] like to horses  prepared for war; and upon their heads as crowns like gold, and  their faces as faces of men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> and they had hair as women's hair, and their teeth were as  of lions,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron, and the  sound of their wings [was] as the sound of chariots of many  horses running to war;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> and they have tails like scorpions, and stings; and their  power [was] in their tails to hurt men five months.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> They have a king over them, the angel of the abyss: his  name in Hebrew, Abaddon, and in Greek he has [for] name  Apollyon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> The first woe has passed. Behold, there come yet two woes  after these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And the sixth angel sounded [his] trumpet: and I heard a  voice from the four horns of the golden altar which [is] before  God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> saying to the sixth angel that had the trumpet, Loose the  four angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> And the four angels were loosed, who are prepared for the  hour and day and month and year, that they might slay the third  part of men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> and the number of the hosts of horse [was] twice ten  thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those that sat  upon them, having breastplates of fire and jacinth and  brimstone; and the heads of the horses [were] as heads of  lions, and out of their mouths goes out fire and smoke and  brimstone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> By these three plagues were the third part of men killed,  by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which goes out of  their mouths.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their  tails: for their tails [are] like serpents, having heads, and  with them they injure.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> And the rest of men who were not killed with these plagues  repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not  worship demons, and the golden and silver and brazen and stone  and wooden idols, which can neither see nor hear nor walk.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> And they repented not of their murders, nor of their  witchcrafts, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> And I saw another strong angel coming down out of the  heaven, clothed with a cloud, and the rainbow upon his head,  and his countenance as the sun, and his feet as pillars of  fire,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> and having in his hand a little opened book. And he set his  right foot on the sea, and the left upon the earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> and cried with a loud voice as a lion roars. And when he  cried, the seven thunders uttered their own voices.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write:  and I heard a voice out of the heaven saying, Seal the things  which the seven thunders have spoken, and write them not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> And the angel whom I saw stand on the sea and on the earth  lifted up his right hand to the heaven,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> and swore by him that lives to the ages of ages, who  created the heaven and the things that are in it, and the earth  and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that  are in it, that there should be no longer delay;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he  is about to sound the trumpet, the mystery of God also shall be  completed, as he has made known the glad tidings to his own  bondmen the prophets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> And the voice which I heard out of the heaven [was] again  speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the little book which is  opened in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and  on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> And I went to the angel, saying to him to give me the  little book. And he says to me, Take and eat it up: and it  shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet  as honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> And I took the little book out of the hand of the angel,  and ate it up; and it was in my mouth as honey, sweet; and when  I had eaten it my belly was made bitter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> And it was said to me, Thou must prophesy again as to  peoples and nations and tongues and many kings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And there was given to me a reed like a staff, saying,  Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them  that worship in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> And the court which [is] without the temple cast out, and  measure it not; because it has been given [up] to the nations,  and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty-two months.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> And I will give [power] to my two witnesses, and they shall  prophesy a thousand two hundred [and] sixty days, clothed in  sackcloth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> These are the two olive trees and the two lamps which stand  before the Lord of the earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> and if any one wills to injure them, fire goes out of their  mouth, and devours their enemies. And if any one wills to  injure them, thus must he be killed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> These have power to shut the heaven that no rain may fall  during the days of their prophecy; and they have power over the  waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth as often  as they will with every plague.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> And when they shall have completed their testimony, the  beast who comes up out of the abyss shall make war with them,  and shall conquer them, and shall kill them:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> and their body [shall be] on the street of the great city,  which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also their  Lord was crucified.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And [men] of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations  see their body three days and a half, and they do not suffer  their bodies to be put into a sepulchre.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> And they that dwell upon the earth rejoice over them, and  are full of delight, and shall send gifts one to another,  because these, the two prophets, tormented them that dwell upon  the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> And after the three days and a half [the] spirit of life  from God came into them, and they stood upon their feet; and  great fear fell upon those beholding them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> And I heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to  them, Come up here; and they went up to the heaven in the  cloud, and their enemies beheld them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the  tenth of the city fell, and seven thousand names of men were  slain in the earthquake. And the remnant were filled with fear,  and gave glory to the God of the heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe comes  quickly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> And the seventh angel sounded [his] trumpet: and there  were great voices in the heaven, saying, The kingdom of the  world of our Lord and of his Christ is come, and he shall reign  to the ages of ages.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones  before God, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> saying, We give thee thanks, Lord God Almighty, [He] who  is, and who was, that thou hast taken thy great power and hast  reigned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> And the nations have been full of wrath, and thy wrath is  come, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give the  recompense to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and  to those who fear thy name, small and great; and to destroy  those that destroy the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> And the temple of God in the heaven was opened, and the  ark of his covenant was seen in his temple: and there were  lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and  great hail.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> And a great sign was seen in the heaven: a woman clothed  with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a  crown of twelve stars;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> and being with child she cried, [being] in travail, and in  pain to bring forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> And another sign was seen in the heaven: and behold, a  great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his  heads seven diadems;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> and his tail draws the third part of the stars of the  heaven; and he cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood  before the woman who was about to bring forth, in order that  when she brought forth he might devour her child.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> And she brought forth a male son, who shall shepherd all  the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to  God and to his throne.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has there  a place prepared of God, that they should nourish her there a  thousand two hundred [and] sixty days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> And there was war in the heaven: Michael and his angels  went to war with the dragon. And the dragon fought, and his  angels;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> and he prevailed not, nor was their place found any more in  the heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> And the great dragon was cast out, the ancient serpent, he  who is called Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole  habitable world, he was cast out into the earth, and his angels  were cast out with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> And I heard a great voice in the heaven saying, Now is  come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God,  and the authority of his Christ; for the accuser of our  brethren has been cast out, who accused them before our God day  and night:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> and *they* have overcome him by reason of the blood of the  Lamb, and by reason of the word of their testimony, and have  not loved their life even unto death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> Therefore be full of delight, ye heavens, and ye that  dwell in them. Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the  devil has come down to you, having great rage, knowing he has a  short time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> And when the dragon saw that he had been cast out into the  earth, he persecuted the woman which bore the male [child].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> And there were given to the woman the two wings of the  great eagle, that she might fly into the desert into her place,  where she is nourished there a time, and times, and half a  time, from [the] face of the serpent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> And the serpent cast out of his mouth behind the woman  water as a river, that he might make her be [as] one carried  away by a river.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its  mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon cast out of his  mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> And the dragon was angry with the woman, and went to make  war with the remnant of her seed, who keep the commandments of  God, and have the testimony of Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> And I stood upon the sand of the sea; and I saw a beast  rising out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and  upon its horns ten diadems, and upon its heads names of  blasphemy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> And the beast which I saw was like to a leopardess, and its  feet as of a bear, and its mouth as a lion's mouth; and the  dragon gave to it his power, and his throne, and great  authority;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> and one of his heads [was] as slain to death, and his wound  of death had been healed: and the whole earth wondered after  the beast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> And they did homage to the dragon, because he gave the  authority to the beast; and they did homage to the beast,  saying, Who [is] like to the beast? and who can make war with  it?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> And there was given to it a mouth, speaking great things  and blasphemies; and there was given to it authority to pursue  its career forty-two months.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> And it opened its mouth for blasphemies against God, to  blaspheme his name and his tabernacle, and those who have their  tabernacle in the heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> And there was given to it to make war with the saints, and  to overcome them; and there was given to it authority over  every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> and all that dwell on the earth shall do it homage, [every  one] whose name had not been written from [the] founding of  [the] world in the book of life of the slain Lamb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> If any one has an ear, let him hear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> If any one [leads] into captivity, he goes into captivity.  If any one shall kill with [the] sword, he must with [the]  sword be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the  saints.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> And I saw another beast rising out of the earth; and it  had two horns like to a lamb, and spake as a dragon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> and it exercises all the authority of the first beast  before it, and causes the earth and those that dwell in it to  do homage to the first beast, whose wound of death was healed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> And it works great signs, that it should cause even fire  to come down from heaven to the earth before men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> And it deceives those that dwell upon the earth by reason  of the signs which it was given to it to work before the beast,  saying to those that dwell upon the earth to make an image to  the beast, which has the wound of the sword, and lived.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> And it was given to it to give breath to the image of the  beast, that the image of the beast should also speak, and  should cause that as many as should not do homage to the image  of the beast should be killed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> And it causes all, the small and the great, and the rich  and the poor, and the free and the bondmen, that they should  give them a mark upon their right hand or upon their forehead;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> and that no one should be able to buy or sell save he that  had the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of its name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> Here is wisdom. He that has understanding let him count  the number of the beast: for it is a man's number; and its  number [is] six hundred [and] sixty-six.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing upon mount Zion,  and with him a hundred [and] forty-four thousand, having his  name and the name of his Father written upon their foreheads.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> And I heard a voice out of the heaven as a voice of many  waters, and as a voice of great thunder. And the voice which I  heard [was] as of harp-singers harping with their harps;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> and they sing a new song before the throne, and before the  four living creatures and the elders. And no one could learn  that song save the hundred [and] forty-four thousand who were  bought from the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> These are they who have not been defiled with women, for  they are virgins: these are they who follow the Lamb  wheresoever it goes. These have been bought from men [as]  first-fruits to God and to the Lamb:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> and in their mouths was no lie found; [for] they are  blameless.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having [the]  everlasting glad tidings to announce to those settled on the  earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give him glory, for  the hour of his judgment has come; and do homage to him who has  made the heaven and the earth and the sea and fountains of  waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> And another, a second, angel followed, saying, Great  Babylon has fallen, has fallen, which of the wine of the fury  of her fornication has made all nations drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> And another, a third, angel followed them, saying with a  loud voice, If any one do homage to the beast and its image,  and receive a mark upon his forehead or upon his hand,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> he also shall drink of the wine of the fury of God  prepared unmixed in the cup of his wrath, and he shall be  tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy angels and  before the Lamb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> And the smoke of their torment goes up to ages of ages,  and they have no respite day and night who do homage to the  beast and to its image, and if any one receive the mark of its  name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> Here is the endurance of the saints, who keep the  commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And I heard a voice out of the heaven saying, Write,  Blessed the dead who die in [the] Lord from henceforth. Yea,  saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; for  their works follow with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> And I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud one  sitting like [the] Son of man, having upon his head a golden  crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a  loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send thy sickle and  reap; for the hour of reaping is come, for the harvest of the  earth is dried.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> And he that sat on the cloud put his sickle on the earth,  and the earth was reaped.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> And another angel came out of the temple which [is] in the  heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> And another angel came out of the altar, having power over  fire, and called with a loud cry to him that had the sharp  sickle, saying, Send thy sharp sickle, and gather the bunches  of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripened.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> And the angel put his sickle to the earth, and gathered  the vine of the earth, and cast [the bunches] into the great  wine-press of the fury of God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> and the wine-press was trodden without the city, and blood  went out of the wine-press to the bits of the horses for a  thousand six hundred stadia.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> And I saw another sign in the heaven, great and wonderful:  seven angels having seven plagues, the last; for in them the  fury of God is completed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> And I saw as a glass sea, mingled with fire, and those that  had gained the victory over the beast, and over its image, and  over the number of its name, standing upon the glass sea,  having harps of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> And they sing the song of Moses bondman of God, and the  song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful [are] thy works,  Lord God Almighty; righteous and true [are] thy ways, O King of  nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> Who shall not fear [thee], O Lord, and glorify thy name?  for [thou] only [art] holy; for all nations shall come and do  homage before thee; for thy righteousnesses have been made  manifest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> And after these things I saw, and the temple of the  tabernacle of witness in the heaven was opened;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of  the temple, clothed in pure bright linen, and girded about the  breasts with golden girdles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven  angels seven golden bowls, full of the fury of God, who lives  to the ages of ages.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God  and from his power: and no one could enter into the temple  until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the  seven angels, Go and pour out the seven bowls of the fury of  God upon the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> And the first went and poured out his bowl on the earth;  and there came an evil and grievous sore upon the men that had  the mark of the beast, and those who worshipped its image.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> And the second poured out his bowl on the sea; and it  became blood, as of a dead man; and every living soul died in  the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> And the third poured out his bowl on the rivers, and [on]  the fountains of waters; and they became blood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Thou art  righteous, who art and wast, the holy one, that thou hast  judged so;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> for they have poured out the blood of saints and prophets,  and thou hast given them blood to drink; they are worthy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> And I heard the altar saying, Yea, Lord God Almighty, true  and righteous [are] thy judgments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> And the fourth poured out his bowl on the sun; and it was  given to it to burn men with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> And the men were burnt with great heat, and blasphemed the  name of God, who had authority over these plagues, and did not  repent to give him glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> And the fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the  beast; and its kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their  tongues with distress,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> and blasphemed the God of the heaven for their distresses  and their sores, and did not repent of their works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> And the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river  Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that the way of the  kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the  mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet,  three unclean spirits, as frogs;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> for they are [the] spirits of demons, doing signs; which  go out to the kings of the whole habitable world to gather them  together to the war of [that] great day of God the Almighty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> (Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed [is] he that watches  and keeps his garments, that he may not walk naked, and that  they [may not] see his shame.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> And he gathered them together to the place called in  Hebrew, Armagedon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> And the seventh poured out his bowl on the air; and there  came out a great voice from the temple of the heaven, from the  throne, saying, It is done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and  there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were  upon the earth, such an earthquake, so great.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> And the great city was [divided] into three parts; and the  cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon was remembered  before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his  wrath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:20">16:20</a> And every island fled, and mountains were not found;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:21">16:21</a> and a great hail, as of a talent weight, comes down out of  the heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God because of the  plague of hail, for the plague of it is exceeding great.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> And one of the seven angels, which had the seven bowls,  came and spoke with me, saying, Come here, I will shew thee the  sentence of the great harlot who sits upon the many waters;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:2">17:2</a> with whom the kings of the earth have committed  fornication; and they that dwell on the earth have been made  drunk with the wine of her fornication.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> And he carried me away in spirit to a desert; and I saw a  woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy,  having seven heads and ten horns.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and had  ornaments of gold and precious stones and pearls, having a  golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the unclean  things of her fornication;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> and upon her forehead a name written, Mystery, great  Babylon, the mother of the harlots, and of the abominations of  the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and  with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And I wondered,  seeing her, with great wonder.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> And the angel said to me, Why hast thou wondered? *I* will  tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast which  carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> The beast which thou sawest was, and is not, and is about  to come up out of the abyss and go into destruction: and they  who dwell on the earth, whose names are not written from the  founding of the world in the book of life, shall wonder, seeing  the beast, that it was, and is not, and shall be present.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> Here is the mind that has wisdom: The seven heads are seven  mountains, whereon the woman sits.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> And there are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the  other has not yet come; and when he comes he must remain [only]  a little while.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> And the beast that was and is not, he also is an eighth,  and is of the seven, and goes into destruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which  have not yet received a kingdom, but receive authority as kings  one hour with the beast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> These have one mind, and give their power and authority to  the beast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall  overcome them; for he is Lord of lords and King of kings: and  they [that are] with him called, and chosen, and faithful.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> And he says to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the  harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and  tongues.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:16">17:16</a> And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these  shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked,  and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her with fire;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:17">17:17</a> for God has given to their hearts to do his mind, and to  act with one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast until  the words of God shall be fulfilled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:18">17:18</a> And the woman which thou sawest is the great city, which  has kingship over the kings of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> After these things I saw another angel descending out of  the heaven, having great authority: and the earth was lightened  with his glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> And he cried with a strong voice, saying, Great Babylon has  fallen, has fallen, and has become the habitation of demons,  and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean  and hated bird;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> because all the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury  of her fornication; and the kings of the earth have committed  fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have been  enriched through the might of her luxury.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> And I heard another voice out of the heaven saying, Come  out of her, my people, that ye have not fellowship in her sins,  and that ye do not receive of her plagues:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> for her sins have been heaped on one another up to the  heaven, and God has remembered her unrighteousnesses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> Recompense her even as she has recompensed; and double [to  her] double, according to her works. In the cup which she has  mixed, mix to her double.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> So much as she has glorified herself and lived luxuriously,  so much torment and grief give to her. Because she says in her  heart, I sit a queen, and I am not a widow; and I shall in no  wise see grief:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> for this reason in one day shall her plagues come, death  and grief and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire; for  strong [is the] Lord God who has judged her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication,  and lived luxuriously with her, shall weep and wail over her,  when they see the smoke of her burning,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> standing afar off, through fear of her torment, saying,  Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! for in one  hour thy judgment is come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> And the merchants of the earth weep and grieve over her,  because no one buys their lading any more;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> lading of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and  pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet dye,  and all thyine wood, and every article in ivory, and every  article in most precious wood, and in brass, and in iron, and  in marble,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> and cinnamon, and amomum, and incense, and unguent, and  frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and  cattle, and sheep, and of horses, and of chariots, and of  bodies, and souls of men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> And the ripe fruits which were the lust of thy soul have  departed from thee, and all fair and splendid things have  perished from thee, and they shall not find them any more at  all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> The merchants of these things, who had been enriched  through her, shall stand afar off through fear of her torment,  weeping and grieving,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> saying, Woe, woe, the great city, which [was] clothed with  fine linen and purple and scarlet, and had ornaments of gold  and precious stones and pearls!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> for in one hour so great riches has been made desolate.  And every steersman, and every one who sailed to any place, and  sailors, and all who exercise their calling on the sea, stood  afar off,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> and cried, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What  [city] is like to the great city?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> and cast dust upon their heads, and cried, weeping and  grieving, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, in which all that  had ships in the sea were enriched through her costliness! for  in one hour she has been made desolate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> Rejoice over her, heaven, and [ye] saints and apostles and  prophets; for God has judged your judgment upon her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> And a strong angel took up a stone, as a great millstone,  and cast [it] into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall  Babylon the great city be cast down, and shall be found no more  at all;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> and voice of harp-singers and musicians and flute-players  and trumpeters shall not be heard any more at all in thee, and  no artificer of any art shall be found any more at all in thee,  and voice of millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> and light of lamp shall shine no more at all in thee, and  voice of bridegroom and bride shall be heard no more at all in  thee; for thy merchants were the great ones of the earth; for  by thy sorcery have all the nations been deceived.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:24">18:24</a> And in her was found [the] blood of prophets and saints,  and of all the slain upon the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> After these things I heard as a loud voice of a great  multitude in the heaven, saying, Hallelujah: the salvation and  the glory and the power of our God:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> for true and righteous [are] his judgments; for he has  judged the great harlot which corrupted the earth with her  fornication, and has avenged the blood of his bondmen at her  hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> And a second time they said, Hallelujah. And her smoke goes  up to the ages of ages.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures  fell down and did homage to God who sits upon the throne,  saying, Amen, Hallelujah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God,  all ye his bondmen, [and] ye that fear him, small and great.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> And I heard as a voice of a great crowd, and as a voice of  many waters, and as a voice of strong thunders, saying,  Hallelujah, for [the] Lord our God the Almighty has taken to  himself kingly power.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> Let us rejoice and exult, and give him glory; for the  marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself  ready.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine  linen, bright [and] pure; for the fine linen is the  righteousnesses of the saints.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> And he says to me, Write, Blessed [are] they who are called  to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb. And he says to me,  These are the true words of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> And I fell before his feet to do him homage. And he says  to me, See [thou do it] not. I am thy fellow-bondman, and [the  fellow-bondman] of thy brethren who have the testimony of  Jesus. Do homage to God. For the spirit of prophecy is the  testimony of Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> And I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse,  and one sitting on it, [called] Faithful and True, and he  judges and makes war in righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head many  diadems, having a name written which no one knows but himself;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> and [he is] clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and  his name is called The Word of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> And the armies which [are] in the heaven followed him upon  white horses, clad in white, pure, fine linen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> And out of his mouth goes a sharp [two-edged] sword, that  with it he might smite the nations; and he shall shepherd them  with an iron rod; and he treads the wine-press of the fury of  the wrath of God the Almighty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:16">19:16</a> And he has upon his garment, and upon his thigh, a name  written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:17">19:17</a> And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with  a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven,  Come, gather yourselves to the great supper of God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:18">19:18</a> that ye may eat flesh of kings, and flesh of chiliarchs,  and flesh of strong men, and flesh of horses and of those that  sit upon them, and flesh of all, both free and bond, and small  and great.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:19">19:19</a> And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their  armies gathered together to make war against him that sat upon  the horse, and against his army.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:20">19:20</a> And the beast was taken, and the false prophet that [was]  with him, who wrought the signs before him by which he deceived  them that received the mark of the beast, and those that  worship his image. Alive were both cast into the lake of fire  which burns with brimstone;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:21">19:21</a> and the rest were slain with the sword of him that sat  upon the horse, which goes out of his mouth; and all the birds  were filled with their flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> And I saw an angel descending from the heaven, having the  key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> And he laid hold of the dragon, the ancient serpent who is  [the] devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> and cast him into the abyss, and shut [it] and sealed [it]  over him, that he should not any more deceive the nations until  the thousand years were completed; after these things he must  be loosed for a little time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> And I saw thrones; and they sat upon them, and judgment was  given to them; and the souls of those beheaded on account of  the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God; and  those who had not done homage to the beast nor to his image,  and had not received the mark on their forehead and hand; and  they lived and reigned with the Christ a thousand years:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> the rest of the dead did not live till the thousand years  had been completed. This [is] the first resurrection.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> Blessed and holy he who has part in the first resurrection:  over these the second death has no power; but they shall be  priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a  thousand years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> And when the thousand years have been completed, Satan  shall be loosed from his prison,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> and shall go out to deceive the nations which [are] in the  four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them  together to the war, whose number [is] as the sand of the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and  surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city: and  fire came down [from God] out of the heaven and devoured them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> And the devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of  fire and brimstone, where [are] both the beast and the false  prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for the ages  of ages.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it,  from whose face the earth and the heaven fled, and place was  not found for them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the  throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened,  which is [that] of life. And the dead were judged out of the  things written in the books according to their works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> And the sea gave up the dead which [were] in it, and death  and hades gave up the dead which [were] in them; and they were  judged each according to their works:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> and death and hades were cast into the lake of fire. This  is the second death, [even] the lake of fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a> And if any one was not found written in the book of life,  he was cast into the lake of fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first  heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea exists  no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of  the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her  husband.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> And I heard a loud voice out of the heaven, saying, Behold,  the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and he shall tabernacle  with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall  be with them, their God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> And he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and  death shall not exist any more, nor grief, nor cry, nor  distress shall exist any more, for the former things have  passed away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> And he that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all  things new. And he says [to me], Write, for these words are  true and faithful.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> And he said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and the  Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that  thirsts of the fountain of the water of life freely.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> He that overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be  to him God, and he shall be to me son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> But to the fearful and unbelieving, [and sinners], and  those who make themselves abominable, and murderers, and  fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their  part [is] in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone;  which is the second death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> And there came one of the seven angels which had had the  seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke with me,  saying, Come here, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> And he carried me away in [the] Spirit, [and set me] on a  great and high mountain, and shewed me the holy city,  Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> having the glory of God. Her shining [was] like a most  precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at  the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are those  of the twelve tribes of [the] sons of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> On [the] east three gates; and on [the] north three gates;  and on [the] south three gates; and on [the] west three gates.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on  them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> And he that spoke with me had a golden reed [as] a  measure, that he might measure the city, and its gates, and its  wall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> And the city lies four-square, and its length [is] as much  as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed --  twelve thousand stadia: the length and the breadth and height  of it are equal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> And he measured its wall, a hundred [and] forty-four  cubits, [a] man's measure, that is, [the] angel's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> And the building of its wall [was] jasper; and the city  pure gold, like pure glass:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> the foundations of the wall of the city [were] adorned  with every precious stone: the first foundation, jasper; the  second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;</p>
