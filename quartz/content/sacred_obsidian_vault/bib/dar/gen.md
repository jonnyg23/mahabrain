 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> And the earth was waste and empty, and darkness was on the  face of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the  face of the waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And God said, Let there be light. And there was light.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided  between the light and the darkness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called  Night. And there was evening, and there was morning -- the  first day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the  waters, and let it be a division between waters and waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> And God made the expanse, and divided between the waters  that are under the expanse and the waters that are above the  expanse; and it was so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And God called the expanse Heavens. And there was evening,  and there was morning -- a second day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered  together to one place, and let the dry [land] appear. And it  was so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And God called the dry [land] Earth, and the gathering  together of the waters he called Seas. And God saw that it was  good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And God said, Let the earth cause grass to spring up, herb  producing seed, fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind,  the seed of which is in them, on the earth. And it was so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And the earth brought forth grass, herb producing seed  after its kind, and trees yielding fruit, the seed of which is  in them, after their kind. And God saw that it was good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And there was evening, and there was morning -- a third  day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the  heavens, to divide between the day and the night; and let them  be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens,  to give light on the earth. And it was so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And God made the two great lights, the great light to rule  the day, and the small light to rule the night, -- and the  stars.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And God set them in the expanse of the heavens, to give  light on the earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> and to rule during the day and during the night, and to  divide between the light and the darkness. And God saw that it  was good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And there was evening, and there was morning -- a fourth  day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living  souls, and let fowl fly above the earth in the expanse of the  heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> And God created the great sea monsters, and every living  soul that moves with which the waters swarm, after their kind,  and every winged fowl after its kind. And God saw that it was  good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and  fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply on the  earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> And there was evening, and there was morning -- a fifth  day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> And God said, Let the earth bring forth living souls after  their kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth,  after their kind. And it was so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the  cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing of the ground  after its kind. And God saw that it was good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our  likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,  and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over  the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth on  the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> And God created Man in his image, in the image of God  created he him; male and female created he them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and  multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion  over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and  over every animal that moveth on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb producing  seed that is on the whole earth, and every tree in which is the  fruit of a tree producing seed: it shall be food for you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> and to every animal of the earth, and to every fowl of the  heavens, and to everything that creepeth on the earth, in which  is a living soul, every green herb for food. And it was so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:31">1:31</a> And God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was  very good. And there was evening, and there was morning -- the  sixth day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And the heavens and the earth and all their host were  finished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And God had finished on the seventh day his work which he  had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work  which he had made.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it, because  that on it he rested from all his work which God had created in  making it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> These are the histories of the heavens and the earth, when  they were created, in the day that Jehovah Elohim made earth  and heavens,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> and every shrub of the field before it was in the earth, and  every herb of the field before it grew; for Jehovah Elohim had  not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to  till the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> But a mist went up from the earth, and moistened the whole  surface of the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And Jehovah Elohim formed Man, dust of the ground, and  breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a  living soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And Jehovah Elohim planted a garden in Eden eastward, and  there put Man whom he had formed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim made every tree grow  that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; and the tree  of life, in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the  knowledge of good and evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> And a river went out of Eden, to water the garden; and from  thence it was parted, and became four main streams.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> The name of the one is Pison: that is it which surrounds  the whole land of Havilah, where the gold is.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and the onyx  stone are there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And the name of the second river is Gihon: that is it which  surrounds the whole land of Cush.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it  which flows forward toward Asshur. And the fourth river, that  is Euphrates.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And Jehovah Elohim took Man, and put him into the garden of  Eden, to till it and to guard it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And Jehovah Elohim commanded Man, saying, Of every tree of  the garden thou shalt freely eat;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou  shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest of it thou  shalt certainly die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And Jehovah Elohim said, It is not good that Man should be  alone; I will make him a helpmate, his like.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim had formed every  animal of the field and all fowl of the heavens, and brought  [them] to Man, to see what he would call them; and whatever Man  called each living soul, that was its name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> And Man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the  heavens, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, he  found no helpmate, his like.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And Jehovah Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon Man;  and he slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up flesh  in its stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> And Jehovah Elohim built the rib that he had taken from Man  into a woman; and brought her to Man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> And Man said, This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of  my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken  out of a man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and  cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> And they were both naked, Man and his wife, and were not  ashamed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And the serpent was more crafty than any animal of the field  which Jehovah Elohim had made. And it said to the woman, Is it  even so, that God has said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of  the garden?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit  of the trees of the garden;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> but of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the  garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it, and ye shall not  touch it, lest ye die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And the serpent said to the woman, Ye will not certainly  die;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> but God knows that in the day ye eat of it, your eyes will  be opened, and ye will be as God, knowing good and evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that  it was a pleasure for the eyes, and the tree was to be desired  to give intelligence; and she took of its fruit, and ate, and  gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that  they were naked. And they sewed fig-leaves together, and made  themselves aprons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And they heard the voice of Jehovah Elohim, walking in the  garden in the cool of the day. And Man and his wife hid  themselves from the presence of Jehovah Elohim, in the midst of  the trees of the garden.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And Jehovah Elohim called to Man, and said to him, Where art  thou?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I feared,  because I am naked; and I hid myself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And he said, Who told thee that thou art naked? Hast thou  eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee not to eat?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And Man said, The woman, whom thou hast given [to be] with  me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> And Jehovah Elohim said to the woman, What is this thou  hast done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I  ate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And Jehovah Elohim said to the serpent, Because thou hast  done this, be thou cursed above all cattle, and above every  beast of the field. On thy belly shalt thou go, and eat dust  all the days of thy life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and  between thy seed and her seed; he shall crush thy head, and  thou shalt crush his heel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> To the woman he said, I will greatly increase thy travail  and thy pregnancy; with pain thou shalt bear children; and to  thy husband shall be thy desire, and he shall rule over thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the  voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree of which I commanded  thee saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed be the ground on  thy account; with toil shalt thou eat [of] it all the days of  thy life;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> and thorns and thistles shall it yield thee; and thou shalt  eat the herb of the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, until thou  return to the ground: for out of it wast thou taken. For dust  thou art; and unto dust shalt thou return.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> And Man called his wife's name Eve; because she is the  mother of all living.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> And Jehovah Elohim made Adam and his wife coats of skin,  and clothed them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> And Jehovah Elohim said, Behold, Man is become as one of  us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he stretch out his  hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for  ever ...!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> Therefore Jehovah Elohim sent him forth from the garden of  Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> And he drove out Man; and he set the Cherubim, and the  flame of the flashing sword, toward the east of the garden of  Eden, to guard the way to the tree of life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And Man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain,  and said, I have acquired a man with Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And she further bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a  shepherd, but Cain was a husbandman.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of  the fruit of the ground an offering to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock,  and of their fat. And Jehovah looked upon Abel, and on his  offering;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> and upon Cain, and on his offering, he did not look. And  Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And Jehovah said to Cain, Why art thou angry, and why is thy  countenance fallen?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> If thou doest well, will not [thy countenance] look up [with  confidence]? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door;  and unto thee [shall be] his desire, and thou shalt rule over  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And Cain spoke to Abel his brother, and it came to pass when  they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his  brother, and slew him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he  said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy  brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And now be thou cursed from the ground, which hath opened  its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield  thee its strength; a wanderer and fugitive shalt thou be on the  earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is too great to be  borne.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the  ground, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a  wanderer and fugitive on the earth; and it will come to pass,  [that] every one who finds me will slay me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And Jehovah said to him, Therefore, whoever slayeth Cain,  it shall be revenged sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark on Cain,  lest any finding him should smite him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt  in the land of Nod, toward the east of Eden.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch.  And he built a city; and he called the name of the city after  the name of his son Enoch.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And to Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael; and  Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lemech.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And Lemech took two wives: the name of the one was Adah,  and the name of the second, Zillah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of those who dwell  in tents, and [breed] cattle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of  those who handle the harp and pipe.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, the forger of every  kind of tool of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain  was Naamah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> And Lemech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my  voice, Ye wives of Lemech, listen to my speech. For I have  slain a man for my wound, and a youth for my bruise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold; Lemech seventy and  seven fold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and  called his name Seth: ... For God has appointed me another seed  instead of Abel, because Cain has slain him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> And to Seth, to him also was born a son; and he called his  name Enosh. Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> This is the book of Adam's generations. In the day that God  created man, in the likeness of God made he him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and  called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot [a son]  in his likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight  hundred years; and he begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> And all the days of Adam that he lived were nine hundred and  thirty years; and he died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enosh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> And Seth lived after he had begotten Enosh eight hundred and  seven years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years;  and he died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> And Enosh lived ninety years, and begot Cainan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And Enosh lived after he had begotten Cainan eight hundred  and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years;  and he died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Mahalaleel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> And Cainan lived after he had begotten Mahalaleel eight  hundred and forty years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years;  and he died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> And Mahalaleel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> And Mahalaleel lived after he had begotten Jared eight  hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred and  ninety-five years; and he died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two years, and begot  Enoch.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> And Jared lived after he had begotten Enoch eight hundred  years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two  years; and he died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> And Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Methushelah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> And Enoch walked with God after he had begotten Methushelah  three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> And all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five  years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> And Methushelah lived a hundred and eighty-seven years, and  begot Lemech.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:26">5:26</a> And Methushelah lived after he had begotten Lemech seven  hundred and eighty-two years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:27">5:27</a> And all the days of Methushelah were nine hundred and  sixty-nine years; and he died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:28">5:28</a> And Lemech lived a hundred and eighty-two years, and begot  a son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:29">5:29</a> And he called his name Noah, saying, This [one] shall  comfort us concerning our work and concerning the toil of our  hands, because of the ground which Jehovah has cursed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:30">5:30</a> And Lemech lived after he had begotten Noah five hundred  and ninety-five years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:31">5:31</a> And all the days of Lemech were seven hundred and  seventy-seven years; and he died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:32">5:32</a> And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah begot Shem,  Ham, and Japheth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> And it came to pass when mankind began to multiply on the  earth, and daughters were born to them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were  fair, and took themselves wives of all that they chose.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not always plead with Man;  for he indeed is flesh; but his days shall be a hundred and  twenty years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> In those days were the giants on the earth, and also  afterwards, when the sons of God had come in to the daughters  of men, and they had borne [children] to them; these were the  heroes, who of old were men of renown.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of Man was great on the  earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart only  evil continually.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> And Jehovah repented that he had made Man on the earth, and  it grieved him in his heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And Jehovah said, I will destroy Man, whom I have created,  from the earth -- from man to cattle, to creeping things, and  to fowl of the heavens; for I repent that I have made them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> But Noah found favour in the eyes of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> This is the history of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect  amongst his generations: Noah walked with God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was  full of violence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt;  for all flesh had corrupted its way on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh is come before  me, for the earth is full of violence through them; and behold,  I will destroy them with the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> Make thyself an ark of gopher wood: [with] cells shalt thou  make the ark; and pitch it inside and outside with pitch.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> And thus shalt thou make it: let the length of the ark be  three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the  height of it thirty cubits.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> A light shalt thou make to the ark; and to a cubit high  shalt thou finish it above. And the door of the ark shalt thou  set in its side: [with] a lower, second, and third [story]  shalt thou make it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> For I, behold, I bring a flood of waters on the earth, to  destroy all flesh under the heavens in which is the breath of  life: everything that is on the earth shall expire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt  go into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy  sons' wives with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every [sort]  shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep [them] alive with thee:  they shall be male and female.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> Of fowl after their kind, and of the cattle after their  kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two  of each shall go in to thee, to keep [them] alive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> And take thou of all food that is eaten, and gather [it] to  thee, that it may be for food for thee and for them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> And Noah did it; according to all that God had commanded  him, so did he.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And Jehovah said to Noah, Go into the ark, thou and all thy  house; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this  generation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> Of all clean beasts thou shalt take to thee by sevens, a  male and its female; but of the beasts that are not clean two,  a male and its female.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> Also of the fowl of the heavens by sevens, male and female;  to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> For in yet seven days I will cause it to rain on the earth  forty days and forty nights; and every living being which I  have made will I destroy from the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> And Noah did according to all that Jehovah had commanded  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters  was on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'  wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the  flood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of  fowl, and of everything that creeps on the ground,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> there came two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and  female, as God had commanded Noah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the  flood were on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second  month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that same day  all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the  windows of heaven were opened.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> And the pour of rain was on the earth forty days and forty  nights.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> On the same day went Noah, and Shem and Ham and Japheth,  the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his  sons with them, into the ark;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle  after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the  earth after its kind, and all fowl after its kind -- every bird  of every wing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> And they went to Noah, into the ark, two and two of all  flesh, in which was the breath of life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> And they that came, came male and female of all flesh, as  God had commanded him. And Jehovah shut him in.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> And the flood was forty days on the earth. And the waters  increased, and bore up the ark; and it was lifted up above the  earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> And the waters prevailed and increased greatly on the  earth; and the ark went on the face of the waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> And the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth; and all  the high mountains that are under all the heavens were covered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> Fifteen cubits upward the waters prevailed; and the  mountains were covered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> And all flesh that moved on the earth expired, fowl as well  as cattle, and beasts, and all crawling things which crawl on  the earth, and all mankind:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> everything which had in its nostrils the breath of life, of  all that was on the dry [land], died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> And every living being was destroyed that was on the  ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and fowl of  the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth. And Noah  alone remained, and what was with him in the ark.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> And the waters prevailed on the earth a hundred and fifty  days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And God remembered Noah, and all the animals, and all the  cattle that were with him in the ark; and God made a wind to  pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were  closed, and the pour of rain from heaven was stopped.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And the waters retired from the earth, continually retiring;  and in the course of a hundred and fifty days the waters  abated.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth  day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And the waters abated continually until the tenth month: in  the tenth [month], on the first of the month, the tops of the  mountains were seen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> And it came to pass at the end of forty days that Noah  opened the window of the ark which he had made.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> And he sent out the raven, which went forth going to and  fro, until the waters were dried from the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> And he sent out the dove from him, to see if the waters had  become low on the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> But the dove found no resting-place for the sole of her  foot, and returned to him into the ark; for the waters were on  the whole earth; and he put forth his hand, and took her, and  brought her to him into the ark.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> And he waited yet other seven days, and again he sent forth  the dove out of the ark.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> And the dove came to him at eventide; and behold, in her  beak was an olive-leaf plucked off; and Noah knew that the  waters had become low on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> And he waited yet other seven days, and sent forth the  dove; but she returned no more to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in  the first [month], on the first of the month, that the waters  were dried up from the earth. And Noah removed the covering of  the ark, and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground was  dried.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the  month, the earth was dry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And God spoke to Noah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> Go out of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and  thy sons' wives with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> Bring forth with thee every animal which is with thee, of  all flesh, fowl as well as cattle, and all the creeping things  which creep on the earth, that they may swarm on the earth, and  may be fruitful and multiply on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> And Noah went out, and his sons, and his wife, and his  sons' wives with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> All the animals, all the creeping things, and all the fowl  -- everything that moves on the earth, after their kinds, went  out of the ark.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> And Noah built an altar to Jehovah; and took of every clean  animal, and of all clean fowl, and offered up burnt-offerings  on the altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> And Jehovah smelled the sweet odour. And Jehovah said in  his heart, I will no more henceforth curse the ground on  account of Man, for the thought of Man's heart is evil from his  youth; and I will no more smite every living thing, as I have  done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed [time] and  harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and  night, shall not cease.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be  fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> And let the fear of you and the dread of you be upon every  animal of the earth, and upon all fowl of the heavens: upon all  that moveth [on] the ground; and upon all the fishes of the  sea: into your hand are they delivered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you: as the  green herb I give you everything.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> Only, the flesh with its life, its blood, ye shall not eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> And indeed your blood, [the blood] of your lives, will I  require: at the hand of every animal will I require it, and at  the hand of Man, at the hand of each [the blood] of his  brother, will I require the life of Man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> Whoso sheddeth Man's blood, by Man shall his blood be shed;  for in the image of God he hath made Man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> And ye, be fruitful and multiply: swarm on the earth, and  multiply on it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with  your seed after you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> and with every living soul which is with you, fowl as well  as cattle, and all the animals of the earth with you, of all  that has gone out of the ark -- every animal of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And I establish my covenant with you, neither shall all  flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood, and  henceforth there shall be no flood to destroy the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> And God said, This is the sign of the covenant that I set  between me and you and every living soul that is with you, for  everlasting generations:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> I set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be for a sign of  the covenant between me and the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> And it shall come to pass when I bring clouds over the  earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> and I will remember my covenant which is between me and you  and every living soul of all flesh; and the waters shall not  henceforth become a flood to destroy all flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it,  that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and  every living soul of all flesh that is upon the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant  which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon  the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> And the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, and  Ham, and Japheth. And Ham is the father of Canaan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> These three are the sons of Noah; and from these was [the  population of] the whole earth spread abroad.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> And Noah began [to be] a husbandman, and planted a  vineyard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> And he drank of the wine, and was drunken, and he uncovered  himself in his tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> And Ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his  father, and told his two brethren outside.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> And Shem and Japheth took the upper garment and both laid  [it] upon their shoulders, and went backwards, and covered the  nakedness of their father. And their faces were turned away,  that they saw not their father's nakedness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> And Noah awoke from his wine, and learned what his youngest  son had done to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> And he said, Cursed be Canaan; Let him be a bondman of  bondmen to his brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem, And let  Canaan be his bondman.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> Let God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of  Shem, And let Canaan be his bondman.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:28">9:28</a> And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty  years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:29">9:29</a> And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years;  and he died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> And these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem,  Ham, and Japheth; and to them were sons born after the flood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and  Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and  Dodanim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> From these came the distribution of the isles of the  nations, according to their lands, every one after his tongue,  after their families, in their nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and  Canaan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and  Raamah, and Sabtecha. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> And Cush begot Nimrod: he began to be mighty on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah; therefore it is  said, As Nimrod, the mighty hunter before Jehovah!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and  Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> From that land went out Asshur, and built Nineveh, and  Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah: this is the great  city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> -- And Mizraim begot the Ludim, and the Anamim, and the  Lehabim, and the Naphtuhim,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> and the Pathrusim, and the Casluhim, out of whom came the  Philistines, and the Caphtorim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> -- And Canaan begot Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. And  afterwards the families of the Canaanites spread themselves  abroad.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as one  goes to Gerar, up to Gazah; as one goes to Sodom, and Gomorrah,  and Admah, and Zeboim, up to Lesha.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after  their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> And to Shem -- to him also were [sons] born; he is the  father of all the sons of Eber, the brother of Japheth the  elder.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,  and Aram.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> -- And Arphaxad begot Shelah; and Shelah begot Eber.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> And to Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was  Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's  name was Joktan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:26">10:26</a> And Joktan begot Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth,  and Jerah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:27">10:27</a> and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:28">10:28</a> and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:29">10:29</a> and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were sons of  Joktan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:30">10:30</a> And their dwelling was from Mesha, as one goes to Sephar,  the eastern mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:31">10:31</a> These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after  their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:32">10:32</a> These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their  generations, in their nations. And from these came the  distribution of the nations on the earth after the flood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And the whole earth had one language, and the same words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that  they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and dwelt there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> And they said one to another, Come on, let us make bricks,  and burn [them] thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and  they had asphalt for mortar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> And they said, Come on, let us build ourselves a city and a  tower, the top of which [may reach] to the heavens; and let us  make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of  the whole earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower which  the children of men built.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> And Jehovah said, Behold, the people is one, and have all  one language; and this have they begun to do. And now will they  be hindered in nothing that they meditate doing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> Come, let us go down, and there confound their language,  that they may not understand one another's speech.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> And Jehovah scattered them thence over the face of the  whole earth. And they left off building the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> Therefore was its name called Babel; because Jehovah there  confounded the language of the whole earth. And Jehovah  scattered them thence over the face of the whole earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred  years old, and begot Arphaxad two years after the flood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> And Shem lived after he had begotten Arphaxad five hundred  years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> And Arphaxad lived thirty-five years, and begot Shelah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> And Arphaxad lived after he had begotten Shelah four  hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> And Shelah lived thirty years, and begot Eber.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> And Shelah lived after he had begotten Eber four hundred  and three years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> And Eber lived thirty-four years, and begot Peleg.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> And Eber lived after he had begotten Peleg four hundred  and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> And Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> And Peleg lived after he had begotten Reu two hundred and  nine years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> And Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot Serug.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> And Reu lived after he had begotten Serug two hundred and  seven years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> And Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> And Serug lived after he had begotten Nahor two hundred  years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:24">11:24</a> And Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and begot Terah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:25">11:25</a> And Nahor lived after he had begotten Terah a hundred and  nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:26">11:26</a> And Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and  Haran.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:27">11:27</a> And these are the generations of Terah: Terah begot Abram,  Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begot Lot.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:28">11:28</a> And Haran died before the face of his father Terah in the  land of his nativity at Ur of the Chaldeans.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:29">11:29</a> And Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram's wife  was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, a daughter of  Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:30">11:30</a> And Sarai was barren: she had no child.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:31">11:31</a> And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his  son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife;  and they went forth together out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to go  into the land of Canaan, and came as far as Haran, and dwelt  there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:32">11:32</a> And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and  Terah died in Haran.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> And Jehovah had said to Abram, Go out of thy land, and from  thy kindred, and from thy father's house, to the land that I  will shew thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> And I will make of thee a great nation, and bless thee, and  make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that  curseth thee; and in thee shall all families of the earth be  blessed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> And Abram departed as Jehovah had said to him. And Lot went  with him. And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed  out of Haran.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son,  and all their possessions that they had acquired, and the souls  that they had obtained in Haran, and they went out to go into  the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem,  to the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> And Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will  I give this land. And there he built an altar to Jehovah who  had appeared to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> And he removed thence towards the mountain on the east of  Bethel, and pitched his tent, [having] Bethel toward the west,  and Ai toward the east; and there he built an altar to Jehovah,  and called on the name of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> And Abram moved onward, going on still toward the south.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> And there was a famine in the land. And Abram went down to  Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was grievous in the  land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> And it came to pass when he was come near to enter into  Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that  thou art a woman fair to look upon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> And it will come to pass when the Egyptians see thee, that  they will say, She is his wife; and they will slay me, and save  thee alive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister, that it may be well  with me on thy account, and my soul may live because of thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> And it came to pass when Abram came into Egypt, that the  Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to  Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> And he treated Abram well on her account; and he had  sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and bondmen, and bondwomen, and  she-asses, and camels.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great  plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:18">12:18</a> And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this thou hast  done to me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:19">12:19</a> Why didst thou say, She is my sister, so that I took her  as my wife. And now, behold, there is thy wife: take [her], and  go away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:20">12:20</a> And Pharaoh commanded [his] men concerning him, and they  sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all  that he had, and Lot with him, towards the south.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> And he went on his journeys from the south as far as  Bethel; as far as the place where his tent had been at the  beginning, between Bethel and Ai;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> to the place of the altar that he had made there at the  first. And there Abram called on the name of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> And Lot also who went with Abram had flocks, and herds, and  tents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> And the land could not support them, that they might dwell  together, for their property was great; and they could not  dwell together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle  and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. And the Canaanite and the  Perizzite were dwelling then in the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> And Abram said to Lot, I pray thee let there be no  contention between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy  herdsmen, for we are brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray  thee, from me: if to the left, then I will take the right; and  if to the right, then I will take the left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of  the Jordan that it was thoroughly watered, before Jehovah had  destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah; as the garden of Jehovah, like  the land of Egypt, as one goes to Zoar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> And Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan; and  Lot went toward the east. And they separated the one from the  other:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan; and Lot dwelt in the  cities of the plain, and pitched tents as far as Sodom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> And the people of Sodom were wicked, and great sinners  before Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> And Jehovah said to Abram, after that Lot had separated  himself from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the  place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and  westward;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> for all the land that thou seest will I give to thee, and  to thy seed for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that  if any one can number the dust of the earth, thy seed also will  be numbered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> Arise, walk through the land according to the length of it  and according to the breadth of it; for I will give it to thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> Then Abram moved [his] tents, and came and dwelt by the  oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron. And he built there an altar  to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel the king of  Shinar, Arioch the king of El-lasar, Chedorlaomer the king of  Elam, and Tidal the king of nations,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> [that] they made war with Bera the king of Sodom, and with  Birsha the king of Gomorrah, Shinab the king of Admah, and  Shemeber the king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela, which is  Zoar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> All these were joined in the vale of Siddim, which is the  salt sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> Twelve years had they served Chedorlaomer; and in the  thirteenth year they rebelled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings  that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim,  and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-Kirjathaim,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> and the Horites on their mount Seir, to El-Paran, which is  by the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh,  and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the  Amorites that dwelt at Hazazon-Tamar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> And the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah, and the  king of Admah, and the king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela,  which is Zoar, went out, and they joined battle with them in  the vale of Siddim,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> with Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and Tidal the king of  nations, and Amraphel the king of Shinar, and Arioch the king  of Ellasar -- four kings with the five.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> And the vale of Siddim was full of pits of asphalt. And  the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there: and they  that remained fled to the mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> And they took all the property of Sodom and Gomorrah, and  all their victuals, and departed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> And they took Lot and his property, Abram's brother's son,  and departed. For he dwelt in Sodom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew.  And he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, the brother of  Eshcol, and the brother of Aner. And these were Abram's allies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> And Abram heard that his brother was taken captive; and he  led out his trained [servants], born in his house, three  hundred and eighteen, and pursued [them] as far as Dan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> And he divided himself against them by night, he and his  servants, and smote them, and pursued them as far as Hobah,  which is to the left of Damascus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> And he brought back all the property, and brought again  his brother Lot and his property, and the women also, and the  people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after he had  returned from smiting Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were  with him, into the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's  valley.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> And Melchisedec king of Salem brought out bread and wine.  And he was priest of the Most High ùGod.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the Most  High ùGod, possessor of heavens and earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> And blessed be the Most High ùGod, who has delivered thine  enemies into thy hand. And he gave him the tenth of all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the souls,  and take the property for thyself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:22">14:22</a> And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my  hand to Jehovah, the Most High ùGod, possessor of heavens and  earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:23">14:23</a> if from a thread even to a sandal-thong, yes, if of all  that is thine, I take [anything] ...; that thou mayest not say,  I have made Abram rich;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:24">14:24</a> save only that which the young men have eaten, and the  portion of the men that went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre,  let them take their portion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> After these things the word of Jehovah came to Abram in a  vision, saying, Fear not, Abram; I am thy shield, thy exceeding  great reward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> And Abram said, Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me?  seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this  Eliezer of Damascus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> And Abram said, Lo, to me thou hast given no seed, and  behold, a son of my house will be mine heir.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> And behold, the word of Jehovah [came] to him, saying, This  shall not be thine heir, but he that will come forth out of thy  body shall be thine heir.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> And he led him out, and said, Look now toward the heavens,  and number the stars, if thou be able to number them. And he  said to him, So shall thy seed be!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> And he believed Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him [as]  righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> And he said to him, I am Jehovah who brought thee out of Ur  of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> And he said, Lord Jehovah, how shall I know that I shall  possess it?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:9">15:9</a> And he said to him, Take me a heifer of three years old,  and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years  old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:10">15:10</a> And he took all these, and divided them in the midst, and  laid the half of each opposite its fellow; but the birds he did  not divide.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:11">15:11</a> And the birds of prey came down on the carcases; and Abram  scared them away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:12">15:12</a> And as the sun was just going down, a deep sleep fell upon  Abram; and behold, a horror, a great darkness, fell upon him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:13">15:13</a> And he said to Abram, Know assuredly that thy seed will be  a sojourner in a land [that is] not theirs, and they shall  serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:14">15:14</a> But also that nation which they shall serve I will judge;  and afterwards they shall come out with great property.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:15">15:15</a> And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be  buried in a good old age.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:16">15:16</a> And [in the] fourth generation they shall come hither  again; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:17">15:17</a> And it came to pass when the sun had gone down, and it was  dark, that behold, there was a smoking furnace, and a flame of  fire which passed between those pieces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:18">15:18</a> On the same day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram,  saying, Unto thy seed I give this land, from the river of Egypt  to the great river, the river Euphrates;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:19">15:19</a> the Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:20">15:20</a> and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaim,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:21">15:21</a> and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites,  and the Jebusites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> And Sarai Abram's wife did not bear him [children]. And she  had an Egyptian maidservant; and her name was Hagar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> And Sarai said to Abram, Behold now, Jehovah has shut me  up, that I do not bear. Go in, I pray thee, to my maidservant:  it may be that I shall be built up by her. And Abram hearkened  to the voice of Sarai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar, the Egyptian, her  maidservant, at the end of ten years that Abram had dwelt in  the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram, as his  wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she  saw that she had conceived, her mistress was lightly esteemed  in her eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> And Sarai said to Abram, My wrong be on thee! I have given  my maidservant into thy bosom; and now she sees that she has  conceived, I am lightly esteemed in her eyes. Jehovah judge  between me and thee!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> And Abram said to Sarai, Behold, thy maidservant is in thy  hand: do to her what is good in thine eyes. And Sarai oppressed  her; and she fled from her face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> And the Angel of Jehovah found her by a spring of water in  the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maidservant, whence comest  thou? and whither art thou going? And she said, I am fleeing  from the face of my mistress Sarai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> And the Angel of Jehovah said to her, Return to thy  mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> And the Angel of Jehovah said to her, I will multiply thy  seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> And the Angel of Jehovah said to her, Behold, thou art  with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name  Ishmael, because Jehovah hath hearkened to thy affliction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> And he will be a wild-ass of a man, his hand against every  man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell  before the face of all his brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> And she called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her, Thou  art the ùGod who reveals himself, for she said, Also here have  I seen after he has revealed himself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> Therefore the well was named Beer-lahai-roi: behold, it is  between Kadesh and Bered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of  his son whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.</p>

 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> And Abram fell on his face; and God talked with him,  saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> And thy name shall no more be called Abram, but thy name  shall be Abraham; for a father of a multitude of nations have I  made thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make  nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and  thy seed after thee in their generations, for an everlasting  covenant, to be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> And I give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of  thy sojourning, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting  possession; and I will be a God to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> And God said to Abraham, And [as for] thee, thou shalt keep  my covenant, thou and thy seed after thee in their generations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> This is my covenant which ye shall keep, between me and  you and thy seed after thee -- that every male among you be  circumcised.</p>

 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> And the uncircumcised male who hath not been circumcised  in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from  his peoples: he hath broken my covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> And God said to Abraham, [As to] Sarai thy wife, thou  shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:16">17:16</a> And I will bless her, and I will give thee a son also of  her; and I will bless her, and she shall become nations: kings  of peoples shall be of her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:17">17:17</a> And Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his  heart, Shall [a child] be born to him that is a hundred years  old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, three men  standing near him. And when he saw [them], he ran to meet them  from the tent-door, and bowed himself to the earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> and said, Lord, if now I have found favour in thine eyes,  pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> Let now a little water be fetched, that ye may wash your  feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> And I will fetch a morsel of bread; and refresh yourselves;  after that ye shall pass on; for therefore have ye passed on  towards your servant. And they said, So do as thou hast said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said,  Knead quickly three seahs of wheaten flour, and make cakes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> And Abraham ran to the herd, and took a calf tender and  good, and gave [it] to the attendant; and he hasted to dress  it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> And he took thick and sweet milk, and the calf that he had  dressed, and set [it] before them; and he stood before them  under the tree, and they ate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And they said to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,  Behold, in the tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> And he said, I will certainly return to thee at [this]  time of the year, and behold, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.  And Sarah was listening at the tent-door, which was behind him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> Now Abraham and Sarah were old [and] advanced in age: it  had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am  become old, shall I have pleasure, and my lord old?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> And Jehovah said to Abraham, Why is this, that Sarah  laughs, saying, Shall I indeed bear, when I am become old?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> Is [any] matter too wonderful for Jehovah? At the time  appointed I will return to thee, at [this] time of the year,  and Sarah shall have a son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> And Sarah denied, saying, I did not laugh; for she was  afraid. And he said, No; but thou didst laugh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> And the men rose up thence, and looked toward Sodom; and  Abraham went with them to conduct them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am  doing?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> Since Abraham shall indeed become a great and mighty  nation; and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> For I know him that he will command his children and his  household after him, and they shall keep the way of Jehovah, to  do righteousness and justice, in order that Jehovah may bring  upon Abraham what he hath spoken of him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is  great and their sin is very grievous,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> I will go down now, and see whether they have done  altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and  if not, I will know [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> And the men turned thence, and went towards Sodom; and  Abraham remained yet standing before Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also cause the  righteous to perish with the wicked?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:24">18:24</a> There are perhaps fifty righteous within the city: wilt  thou also destroy and not forgive the place for the sake of the  fifty righteous that are therein?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:25">18:25</a> Far be it from thee to do so, to slay the righteous with  the wicked, that the righteous should be as the wicked -- far  be it from thee! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:26">18:26</a> And Jehovah said, If I find at Sodom fifty righteous  within the city, then I will forgive all the place for their  sakes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:27">18:27</a> And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have ventured  to speak unto the Lord; I, who am dust and ashes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:28">18:28</a> Perhaps there may want five of the fifty righteous: wilt  thou destroy all the city on account of the five? And he said,  If I shall find forty-five there, I will not destroy [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:29">18:29</a> And he continued yet to speak with him, and said, Perhaps  there may be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it  for the forty's sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:30">18:30</a> And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry that I speak!  Perhaps there may be thirty found there. And he said, I will  not do it if I find thirty there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:31">18:31</a> And he said, Behold now, I have ventured to speak with the  Lord. Perhaps there may be twenty found there. And he said, I  will not destroy [it] for the twenty's sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:32">18:32</a> And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, that I speak  yet but this time! Perhaps there may be ten found there. And he  said, I will not destroy [it] for the ten's sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:33">18:33</a> And Jehovah went away when he had ended speaking to  Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> And the two angels came to Sodom at even. And Lot was  sitting in the gate of Sodom. And Lot saw them, and rose up to  meet them; and he bowed down, the face toward the ground,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you,  into your servant's house, and lodge, and wash your feet; and  ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, No;  but we will pass the night in the open place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and  entered into his house. And he made them a repast, and baked  unleavened cakes; and they ate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of  Sodom, surrounded the house, from the youngest to the oldest --  all the people from every quarter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men  that have come in to thee to-night? bring them out to us that  we may know them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> And Lot went out to them to the entrance, and shut the door  after him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> and said, I pray you, my brethren, do not wickedly!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known a man:  let me now bring them out to you; and do to them as is good in  your sight: only, to these men do nothing; for therefore have  they come under the shadow of my roof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> And they said, Back there! And they said [again], This one  came to sojourn, and he must be a judge? Now we will deal worse  with thee than with them. And they pressed hard on the man --  on Lot; and drew near to break the door.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> And the men stretched out their hand, and brought Lot into  the house to them, and shut the door.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> And they smote the men that were at the entrance of the  house with blindness, from the smallest to the greatest; and  they wearied themselves to find the entrance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> And the men said to Lot, Whom hast thou here besides? a  son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and all whom thou  hast in the city -- bring [them] out of the place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> For we are going to destroy this place, because the cry of  them is great before Jehovah, and Jehovah has sent us to  destroy it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who had  married his daughters, and said, Up, go out of this place, for  Jehovah will destroy the city. But he was as if he jested, in  the sight of his sons-in-law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> And as the dawn arose, the angels urged Lot, saying, Up,  take thy wife and thy two daughters who are present, lest thou  perish in the iniquity of the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:16">19:16</a> And as he lingered, the men laid hold on his hand, and on  the hand of his wife, and on the hand of his two daughters,  Jehovah being merciful to him; and they led him out, and set  him without the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:17">19:17</a> And it came to pass when they had brought them outside,  that he said, Escape for thy life: look not behind thee,  neither stay thou in all the plain: escape to the mountain,  lest thou perish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:18">19:18</a> And Lot said to them, Not [so], I pray thee, Lord;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:19">19:19</a> behold now, thy servant has found favour in thine eyes,  and thou hast magnified thy goodness, which thou hast shewn to  me in preserving my soul alive; but I cannot escape to the  mountain, lest calamity lay hold on me, that I die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:20">19:20</a> Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is small:  I pray thee, let me escape thither -- is it not small? -- and  my soul shall live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:21">19:21</a> And he said to him, Behold, I have accepted thee  concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city  of which thou hast spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:22">19:22</a> Haste, escape thither; for I cannot do anything until thou  art come there. Therefore the name of the city is called Zoar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:23">19:23</a> The sun rose upon the earth when Lot came to Zoar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:24">19:24</a> And Jehovah rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and  fire from Jehovah out of heaven,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:25">19:25</a> and overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the  inhabitants of the cities, and what grew upon the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:26">19:26</a> And his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a  pillar of salt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:27">19:27</a> And Abraham rose early in the morning [and went] to the  place where he had stood before Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:28">19:28</a> and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all  the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, a smoke went up from  the land as the smoke of a furnace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:29">19:29</a> And it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the  plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the  midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which  Lot dwelt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:30">19:30</a> And Lot went up from Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and  his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar. And  he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:31">19:31</a> And the first-born said to the younger, Our father is old,  and there is not a man in the land to come in to us after the  manner of all the earth:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:32">19:32</a> come, let us give our father wine to drink, and let us lie  with him, that we may preserve seed alive of our father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:33">19:33</a> And they gave their father wine to drink that night. And  the first-born went in, and lay with her father, and he did not  know of her lying down, nor of her rising.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:34">19:34</a> And it came to pass on the next day that the first-born  said to the younger, Lo, I lay last night with my father: let  us give him wine to drink to-night also, and go thou in, lie  with him, that we may preserve seed alive of our father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:35">19:35</a> And they gave their father wine to drink that night also.  And the younger arose, and lay with him; and he did not know of  her lying down, nor of her rising.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:36">19:36</a> And both the daughters of Lot were with child by their  father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:37">19:37</a> And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab:  the same is the father of the Moabites to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:38">19:38</a> And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name  Ben-ammi; the same is the father of the children of Ammon to  this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> And Abraham departed thence towards the south country, and  dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned at Gerar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And  Abimelech the king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to  him, Behold, thou art [but] a dead man, because of the woman  that thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> But Abimelech had not come near her. And he said, Lord,  wilt thou also kill a righteous nation?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> Did he not say to me, She is my sister? and she, even she  said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and in the  innocency of my hands have I done this.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> And God said to him in a dream, I also knew that thou didst  this in the integrity of thy heart, and I, too, have withheld  thee from sinning against me: therefore have I not suffered  thee to touch her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> And now, restore the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and  will pray for thee, that thou mayest live. And if thou do not  restore [her], know that thou shalt certainly die, thou and all  that is thine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his  servants, and spoke all these words in their ears; and the men  were greatly afraid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> And Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, What hast  thou done to us? And in what have I sinned against thee, that  thou hast brought on me, and on my kingdom, a great sin? Thou  hast done to me deeds that ought not to be done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> And Abimelech said to Abraham, What hast thou seen that  thou hast done this?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> And Abraham said, Because I said, Surely the fear of God  is not in this place, and they will kill me for my wife's sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> But she is also truly my sister, the daughter of my  father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my  wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> And it came to pass when God caused me to wander from my  father's house, that I said to her, Let this be thy kindness  which thou shalt shew to me: at every place whither we shall  come, say of me, He is my brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and bondmen and  bondwomen, and gave [them] to Abraham, and restored him Sarah  his wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a> And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell  where it is good in thine eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a> And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a  thousand [pieces] of silver; behold, let that be to thee a  covering of the eyes, in respect of all that are with thee, and  with all; and she was reproved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> And Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and  his wife and his handmaids, and they bore [children].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> For Jehovah had fast closed up all the wombs of the house  of Abimelech because of Sarah Abraham's wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did  to Sarah as he had spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age,  at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him,  whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days  old, as God had commanded him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was  born to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> And Sarah said, God has made me laugh: all that hear will  laugh with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, Sarah will  suckle children? For I have borne [him] a son in his old age.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a  great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had  borne to Abraham, mocking.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> And she said to Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her  son; for the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son  -- with Isaac.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because  of his son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy  sight because of the lad and because of thy handmaid: [in] all  that Sarah hath said to thee hearken to her voice, for in Isaac  shall a seed be called to thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> But also the son of the handmaid will I make a nation,  because he is thy seed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread,  and a flask of water, and gave [it] to Hagar, putting [it] on  her shoulder -- and the child, and sent her away. And she  departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> And the water was exhausted from the flask; and she cast  the child under one of the shrubs,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> and she went and sat down over against [him], a bow-shot  off; for she said, Let me not behold the death of the child.  And she sat over against [him], and lifted up her voice and  wept.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> And God heard the voice of the lad. And the Angel of God  called to Hagar from the heavens, and said to her, What  [aileth] thee, Hagar? Fear not; for God hath heard the voice of  the lad there, where he is.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> Arise, take the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for I will  make of him a great nation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and  she went and filled the flask with water, and gave the lad  drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the  wilderness, and became an archer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:21">21:21</a> And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother  took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:22">21:22</a> And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech, and  Phichol the captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God  is with thee in all that thou doest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:23">21:23</a> And now swear to me here by God that thou wilt not deal  deceitfully with me, nor with my son, nor with my grandson.  According to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt  do to me, and to the land in which thou sojournest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:24">21:24</a> And Abraham said, I will swear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:25">21:25</a> And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water  that Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:26">21:26</a> And Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this,  neither hast thou told me [of it], neither have I heard [of it]  but to-day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:27">21:27</a> And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to  Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:28">21:28</a> And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by  themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:29">21:29</a> And Abimelech said to Abraham, What [mean] these seven  ewe-lambs, these which thou hast set by themselves?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:30">21:30</a> And he said, That thou take the seven ewe-lambs of my  hand, that they may be a witness to me that I have dug this  well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:31">21:31</a> Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba, because there  they had sworn, both of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:32">21:32</a> And they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose  up, and Phichol the captain of his host, and returned into the  land of the Philistines.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:33">21:33</a> And [Abraham] planted a tamarisk in Beer-sheba, and called  there on the name of Jehovah, the Eternal ùGod.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:34">21:34</a> And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> And it came to pass after these things, that God tried  Abraham, and said to him, Abraham! and he said, Here am I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> And he said, Take now thy son, thine only [son], whom thou  lovest, Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and there  offer him up for a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which  I will tell thee of.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass,  and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and  he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up and went  to the place that God had told him of.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the  place from afar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> And Abraham said to his young men, Abide ye here with the  ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come  again to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid  it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and the  knife, and they went both of them together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father!  And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire  and the wood; but where is the sheep for a burnt-offering?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself with the  sheep for a burnt-offering. And they went both of them  together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> And they came to the place of which God had told him. And  Abraham built the altar there, and piled the wood; and he bound  Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> And Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to  slaughter his son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens,  and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, Here am I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> And he said, Stretch not out thy hand against the lad,  neither do anything to him; for now I know that thou fearest  God, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son], from me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold,  behind was a ram caught in the thicket by its horns; and  Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a  burnt-offering instead of his son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh;  as it is said at the present day, On the mount of Jehovah will  be provided.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> And the Angel of Jehovah called to Abraham from the  heavens a second time,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> and said, By myself I swear, saith Jehovah, that, because  thou hast done this, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only  [son],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> I will richly bless thee, and greatly multiply thy seed,  as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is on the  sea-shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless  themselves, because thou hast hearkened to my voice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> And Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up  and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham dwelt at  Beer-sheba.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> And it came to pass after these things, that it was told  Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also has borne sons to thy  brother Nahor:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:21">22:21</a> Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the  father of Aram,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and  Bethuel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:23">22:23</a> (And Bethuel begot Rebecca.) These eight Milcah bore to  Nahor, Abraham's brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:24">22:24</a> And his concubine, named Reumah, she also bore Tebah, and  Gaham, and Thahash, and Maacah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> And the life of Sarah was a hundred and twenty-seven years:  [these were] the years of the life of Sarah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:2">23:2</a> And Sarah died in Kirjath-Arba: that is Hebron, in the land  of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for  her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the  sons of Heth, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> I am a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me a  possession of a sepulchre with you, that I may bury my dead  from before me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> Hear us, my lord: thou art a prince of God among us: in the  choicest of our sepulchres bury thy dead: none of us shall  withhold from thee his sepulchre for burying thy dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> And Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the people of the  land, to the sons of Heth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> and spoke to them, saying, If it be your will that I should  bury my dead from before me, hear me, and entreat for me Ephron  the son of Zohar,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:9">23:9</a> that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which is his,  which is at the end of his field; for the full money let him  give it to me amongst you for a possession of a sepulchre.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> And Ephron was dwelling among the sons of Heth. And Ephron  the Hittite answered Abraham, in the ears of the sons of Heth,  [even] of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> No, my lord: hear me. The field give I thee; and the cave  that is in it, to thee I give it; before the eyes of the sons  of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> And Abraham bowed down before the people of the land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:13">23:13</a> and he spoke to Ephron, in the ears of the people of the  land, saying, But if only thou wouldst listen to me, I give the  money for the field: take [it] of me, and I will bury my dead  there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> My lord, hearken to me. A field of four hundred shekels of  silver, what is that between me and thee? bury therefore thy  dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:16">23:16</a> And Abraham hearkened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to  Ephron the money that he had named in the ears of the sons of  Heth -- four hundred shekels of silver, current with the  merchant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:17">23:17</a> So the field of Ephron, which was at Machpelah, which was  before Mamre, the field, and the cave that was in it, and all  the trees that were in the field, that were in all its borders  round about,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:18">23:18</a> were assured to Abraham for a possession before the eyes  of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his  city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:19">23:19</a> And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave  of the field at Machpelah, opposite to Mamre: that is Hebron,  in the land of Canaan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:20">23:20</a> And the field and the cave that was in it were assured to  Abraham for a possession of a sepulchre by the sons of Heth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> And Abraham was old, [and] advanced in age; and Jehovah had  blessed Abraham in all things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> And Abraham said to his servant, the eldest of his house,  who ruled over all that he had, Put thy hand, I pray thee,  under my thigh,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> and I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of the  heavens and the God of the earth, that thou take not a wife for  my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am  dwelling;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> but thou shalt go to my land and to my kindred, and take a  wife for my son Isaac.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> And the servant said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be  willing to follow me to this land: must I, then, bring thy son  again in any case to the land from which thou hast removed?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> And Abraham said to him, Beware that thou bring not my son  thither again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> Jehovah the God of the heavens, who took me out of my  father's house, and out of the land of my nativity, and who has  spoken to me, and who has sworn to me, saying, Unto thy seed  will I give this land -- he will send his angel before thee,  that thou mayest take a wife for my son thence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:8">24:8</a> And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou  shalt be quit of this my oath: only, bring not my son thither  again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:9">24:9</a> And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his  master, and swore unto him concerning that matter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his  master, and departed; now all the treasure of his master was  under his hand; and he arose and went to Aram-naharaim, to the  city of Nahor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:11">24:11</a> And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by a  well of water, at the time of the evening, when the women came  out to draw [water].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:12">24:12</a> And he said, Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, meet me, I  pray thee, [with thy blessing] this day, and deal kindly with  my master Abraham.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:13">24:13</a> Behold, I stand [here] by the well of water, and the  daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:14">24:14</a> And let it come to pass, [that] the maiden to whom I shall  say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink, and  who will say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also, be  she whom thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and hereby  I shall know that thou hast dealt kindly with my master.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:15">24:15</a> And it came to pass before he had ended speaking, that  behold, Rebecca came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of  Milcah the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother; and [she had] her  pitcher upon her shoulder.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:16">24:16</a> And the maiden was very fair in countenance; a virgin, and  no man had known her. And she went down to the well, and filled  her pitcher, and came up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:17">24:17</a> And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray  thee, sip a little water out of thy pitcher.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:18">24:18</a> And she said, Drink, my lord! And she hasted and let down  her pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:19">24:19</a> And when she had given him enough to drink, she said, I  will draw [water] for thy camels also, until they have drunk  enough.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:20">24:20</a> And she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough,  and ran again to the well to draw [water]; and she drew for all  his camels.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:21">24:21</a> And the man was astonished at her, remaining silent, to  know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:22">24:22</a> And it came to pass when the camels had drunk enough, that  the man took a gold ring, of half a shekel weight, and two  bracelets for her hands, ten [shekels] weight of gold,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:23">24:23</a> and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee.  Is there room [in] thy father's house for us to lodge?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:24">24:24</a> And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son  of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:25">24:25</a> And she said to him, There is straw, and also much  provender with us; also room to lodge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:26">24:26</a> And the man stooped, and bowed down before Jehovah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:27">24:27</a> and said, Blessed be Jehovah, God of my master Abraham,  who has not withdrawn his loving-kindness and his faithfulness  from my master; I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the  house of my master's brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:28">24:28</a> And the maiden ran and told these things to her mother's  house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:29">24:29</a> And Rebecca had a brother, named Laban; and Laban ran out  to the man, to the well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:30">24:30</a> And it came to pass when he saw the ring and the bracelets  on his sister's hand, and when he heard the words of Rebecca  his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me -- that he came to  the man, and behold, he was standing by the camels, by the  well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:31">24:31</a> And he said, Come in, blessed of Jehovah! why standest  thou outside? for I have prepared the house, and room for the  camels.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:32">24:32</a> And the man came into the house; and he ungirded the  camels, and gave the camels straw and provender, and water to  wash his feet, and the feet of the men who were with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:33">24:33</a> And there was set [meat] before him to eat; but he said, I  will not eat until I have made known my business. And he said,  Speak on.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:34">24:34</a> And he said, I am Abraham's servant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:35">24:35</a> And Jehovah has blessed my master greatly, and he is  become great; and he has given him sheep and cattle, and silver  and gold, and bondmen and bondwomen, and camels and asses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:36">24:36</a> And Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master after  she had grown old; and unto him has he given all that he has.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:37">24:37</a> And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a  wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanite, in whose  land I am dwelling;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:38">24:38</a> but thou shalt by all means go to my father's house and to  my family, and take a wife for my son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:39">24:39</a> And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow  me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:40">24:40</a> And he said to me, Jehovah, before whom I have walked,  will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way, that thou  mayest take a wife for my son of my family, and out of my  father's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:41">24:41</a> Then shalt thou be quit of my oath, when thou shalt have  come to my family. And if they give thee not [one], thou shalt  be quit of my oath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:42">24:42</a> And I came this day to the well, and said, Jehovah, God of  my master Abraham, if now thou wilt prosper my way on which I  go,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:43">24:43</a> behold, I stand by the well of water, and let it come to  pass that the damsel who cometh forth to draw [water], and to  whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water out of  thy pitcher to drink,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:44">24:44</a> and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also  draw for thy camels -- that she should be the woman whom  Jehovah hath appointed for my master's son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:45">24:45</a> Before I ended speaking in my heart, behold, Rebecca came  forth with her pitcher on her shoulder, and went down to the  well, and drew [water]; and I said to her, Give me, I pray  thee, to drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:46">24:46</a> And she hasted and let down her pitcher from her  [shoulder], and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink  also. And I drank; and she gave the camels drink also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:47">24:47</a> And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And  she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah  bore to him. And I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets  on her hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:48">24:48</a> And I stooped, and bowed down before Jehovah; and I  blessed Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, who has led me the  right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:49">24:49</a> And now, if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master,  tell me; and if not, tell me; and I will turn to the right hand  or to the left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:50">24:50</a> And Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing  proceeds from Jehovah: we cannot speak to thee bad or good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:51">24:51</a> Behold, Rebecca is before thee: take [her], and go away;  and let her be wife of thy master's son, as Jehovah has said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:52">24:52</a> And it came to pass, when Abraham's servant heard their  words, that he bowed down to the earth before Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:53">24:53</a> And the servant brought forth silver articles, and gold  articles, and clothing, and he gave [them] to Rebecca; and he  gave to her brother, and to her mother, precious things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:54">24:54</a> And they ate and drank, he and the men that were with him,  and lodged. And they rose up in the morning; and he said, Send  me away to my master.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:55">24:55</a> And her brother and her mother said, Let the maiden abide  with us [some] days, or [say] ten; after that she shall go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:56">24:56</a> And he said to them, Do not hinder me, seeing Jehovah has  prospered my way: send me away, and I will go to my master.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:57">24:57</a> And they said, Let us call the maiden and inquire at her  mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:58">24:58</a> And they called Rebecca and said to her, Wilt thou go with  this man? And she said, I will go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:59">24:59</a> And they sent away Rebecca their sister, and her nurse,  and Abraham's servant, and his men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:60">24:60</a> And they blessed Rebecca, and said to her, Thou art our  sister; mayest thou become thousands of tens of thousands; and  may thy seed possess the gate of their enemies!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:61">24:61</a> And Rebecca arose, and her maids, and they rode upon the  camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebecca, and  went away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:62">24:62</a> And Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi; for he  was dwelling in the south country.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:63">24:63</a> And Isaac had gone out to meditate in the fields toward  the beginning of evening. And he lifted up his eyes and saw,  and behold, camels were coming.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:64">24:64</a> And Rebecca lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac, and she  sprang off the camel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:65">24:65</a> And she had said to the servant, Who is the man that is  walking in the fields to meet us? And the servant said, That is  my master! Then she took the veil, and covered herself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:66">24:66</a> And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:67">24:67</a> And Isaac led her into his mother Sarah's tent; and he  took Rebecca, and she became his wife, and he loved her. And  Isaac was comforted after [the death of] his mother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:1">25:1</a> And Abraham took another wife named Keturah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:2">25:2</a> And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and  Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:3">25:3</a> And Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan; and the sons of Dedan  were the Asshurim, and the Letushim, and the Leummim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:4">25:4</a> And the sons of Midian were Ephah, and Epher, and Enoch,  and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were sons of Keturah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:5">25:5</a> And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:6">25:6</a> And to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham  gave gifts, and, while he yet lived, sent them away from Isaac  his son, eastward to the east country.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:7">25:7</a> And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which  he lived: a hundred and seventy-five years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:8">25:8</a> And Abraham expired and died in a good old age, old and  full [of days]; and was gathered to his peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:9">25:9</a> And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of  Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite,  which was opposite to Mamre --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:10">25:10</a> the field that Abraham had purchased of the sons of Heth:  there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:11">25:11</a> And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God  blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt at Beer-lahai-roi.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:12">25:12</a> And these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son,  whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's bondwoman, bore to Abraham.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:13">25:13</a> And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their  names according to their generations: Nebaioth, the firstborn  of Ishmael; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:14">25:14</a> and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:15">25:15</a> Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedmah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:16">25:16</a> These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names,  in their hamlets and their encampments -- twelve princes of  their peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:17">25:17</a> And these are the years of the life of Ishmael: a hundred  and thirty-seven years; and he expired and died, and was  gathered to his peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:18">25:18</a> And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite to  Egypt, as one goes towards Assyria. He settled before the face  of all his brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:19">25:19</a> And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son.  Abraham begot Isaac.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:20">25:20</a> And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebecca as  wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-Aram, the  sister of Laban the Syrian.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:21">25:21</a> And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was  barren; and Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebecca his wife  conceived.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:22">25:22</a> And the children struggled together within her; and she  said, If [it be] so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:23">25:23</a> And Jehovah said to her, Two nations are in thy womb, And  two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels; And one people  shall be stronger than the other people, And the elder shall  serve the younger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:24">25:24</a> And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,  there were twins in her womb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:25">25:25</a> And the first came out red -- all over like a hairy  garment; and they called his name Esau.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:26">25:26</a> And after that came his brother out; and his hand took  hold of Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac  was sixty years old when they were born.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:27">25:27</a> And the boys grew, and Esau became a man skilled in  hunting, a man of the field; and Jacob was a homely man,  dwelling in tents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:28">25:28</a> And Isaac loved Esau, because venison was to his taste;  and Rebecca loved Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:29">25:29</a> And Jacob had cooked a dish; and Esau came from the field,  and he was faint.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:30">25:30</a> And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with the red  -- the red thing there, for I am faint. Therefore was his name  called Edom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:31">25:31</a> And Jacob said, Sell me now thy birthright.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:32">25:32</a> And Esau said, Behold, I am going to die, and of what use  can the birthright be to me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:33">25:33</a> And Jacob said, Swear unto me now. And he swore unto him,  and sold his birthright to Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:34">25:34</a> And Jacob gave Esau bread and the dish of lentils; and he  ate and drank, and rose up and went away. Thus Esau despised  the birthright.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:1">26:1</a> And there was a famine in the land, besides the former  famine which had been in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to  Abimelech the king of the Philistines, to Gerar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:2">26:2</a> And Jehovah appeared to him and said, Go not down to Egypt:  dwell in the land that I shall tell thee of.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:3">26:3</a> Sojourn in this land; and I will be with thee and bless  thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these  countries; and I will perform the oath which I swore unto  Abraham thy father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:4">26:4</a> And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and  unto thy seed will I give all these countries; and in thy seed  shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:5">26:5</a> because that Abraham hearkened to my voice, and kept my  charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:6">26:6</a> And Isaac dwelt at Gerar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:7">26:7</a> And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said,  She is my sister; for he feared to say, my wife, [saying to  himself,] Lest the men of the place slay me on account of  Rebecca -- because she was fair in countenance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:8">26:8</a> And it came to pass when he had been there some time, that  Abimelech the king of the Philistines looked out of the window,  and saw, and behold, Isaac was dallying with Rebecca his wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:9">26:9</a> Then Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, she is  certainly thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? and  Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I die on account of  her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:10">26:10</a> And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done to us? But  a little and one of the people might have lain with thy wife,  and thou wouldest have brought a trespass on us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:11">26:11</a> And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that  touches this man or his wife shall certainly be put to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:12">26:12</a> And Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same  year a hundredfold; and Jehovah blessed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:13">26:13</a> And the man became great, and he became continually  greater, until he was very great.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:14">26:14</a> And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of  herds, and a great number of servants; and the Philistines  envied him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:15">26:15</a> And all the wells that his father's servants had dug in  the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped them  and filled them with earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:16">26:16</a> And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us; for thou art  become much mightier than we.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:17">26:17</a> And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his camp in the  valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:18">26:18</a> And Isaac dug again the wells of water that they had dug  in the days of Abraham his father, and that the Philistines had  stopped after the death of Abraham; and he called their names  after the names by which his father had called them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:19">26:19</a> And Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a  well of springing water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:20">26:20</a> But the shepherds of Gerar strove with Isaac's shepherds,  saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well  Esek, because they had quarrelled with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:21">26:21</a> And they dug another well, and they strove for that also;  and he called the name of it Sitnah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:22">26:22</a> And he removed thence and dug another well; and they did  not strive for that. And he called the name of it Rehoboth, and  said, For now Jehovah has made room for us, and we shall be  fruitful in the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:23">26:23</a> And he went up thence to Beer-sheba.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:24">26:24</a> And Jehovah appeared to him the same night, and said, I am  the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee,  and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant  Abraham's sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:25">26:25</a> And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of  Jehovah. And he pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's  servants dug a well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:26">26:26</a> And Abimelech, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phichol the  captain of his host, went to him from Gerar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:27">26:27</a> And Isaac said to them, Why are ye come to me, seeing ye  hate me, and have driven me away from you?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:28">26:28</a> And they said, We saw certainly that Jehovah is with thee;  and we said, Let there be then an oath between us -- between us  and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:29">26:29</a> that thou wilt do us no wrong, as we have not touched  thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have  let thee go in peace; thou art now blessed of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:30">26:30</a> And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:31">26:31</a> And they rose early in the morning, and swore one to  another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him  in peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:32">26:32</a> And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants  came, and told him concerning the well that they had dug, and  said to him, We have found water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:33">26:33</a> And he called it Shebah; therefore the name of the city is  Beer-sheba to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:34">26:34</a> And Esau was forty years old, when he took as wives Judith  the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basmath the daughter of  Elon the Hittite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:35">26:35</a> And they were a grief of mind to Isaac and to Rebecca.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:1">27:1</a> And it came to pass when Isaac had become old, and his eyes  were dim so that he could not see, that he called Esau his  elder son, and said to him, My son! And he said to him, Here am  I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:2">27:2</a> And he said, Behold now, I am become old; I know not the  day of my death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:3">27:3</a> And now, I pray thee, take thy weapons, thy quiver and thy  bow, and go out to the field and hunt me venison,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:4">27:4</a> and prepare me a savoury dish such as I love, and bring it  to me that I may eat, in order that my soul may bless thee  before I die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:5">27:5</a> And Rebecca heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And  Esau went to the field to hunt venison, to bring it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:6">27:6</a> And Rebecca spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard  thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:7">27:7</a> Bring me venison, and prepare me a savoury dish, that I may  eat, and bless thee before Jehovah, before my death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:8">27:8</a> And now, my son, hearken to my voice in that which I  command thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:9">27:9</a> Go, I pray thee, to the flock, and fetch me thence two good  kids of the goats. And I will make of them a savoury dish for  thy father, such as he loves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:10">27:10</a> And thou shalt bring [it] to thy father, that he may eat,  in order that he may bless thee before his death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:11">27:11</a> And Jacob said to Rebecca his mother, Behold, Esau my  brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:12">27:12</a> My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall be in his  sight as one who mocks [him], and I shall bring a curse on me,  and not a blessing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:13">27:13</a> And his mother said to him, On me [be] thy curse, my son!  Only hearken to my voice, and go, fetch [them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:14">27:14</a> And he went, and fetched and brought [them] to his mother.  And his mother prepared a savoury dish such as his father  loved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:15">27:15</a> And Rebecca took the clothes of her elder son Esau, the  costly ones which were with her in the house, and put them on  Jacob her younger son;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:16">27:16</a> and she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his  hands, and on the smooth of his neck;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:17">27:17</a> and she gave the savoury dishes and the bread that she had  prepared into the hand of her son Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:18">27:18</a> And he came to his father, and said, My father! And he  said, Here am I: who art thou, my son?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:19">27:19</a> And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau, thy firstborn. I  have done according as thou didst say to me. Arise, I pray  thee, sit and eat of my venison, in order that thy soul may  bless me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:20">27:20</a> And Isaac said to his son, How is it that thou hast found  [it] so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God  put [it] in my way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:21">27:21</a> And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I  may feel thee, my son, whether thou be really my son Esau or  not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:22">27:22</a> And Jacob drew near to Isaac his father; and he felt him,  and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the  hands of Esau.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:23">27:23</a> And he did not discern him, because his hands were hairy,  as his brother Esau's hands; and he blessed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:24">27:24</a> And he said, Art thou really my son Esau? And he said, It  is I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:25">27:25</a> And he said, Bring [it] near to me, that I may eat of my  son's venison, in order that my soul may bless thee. And he  brought [it] near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine,  and he drank.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:26">27:26</a> And his father Isaac said to him, Come near, now, and kiss  me, my son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:27">27:27</a> And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelt the smell  of his clothes, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my  son is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:28">27:28</a> And God give thee of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness  of the earth, And plenty of corn and new wine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:29">27:29</a> Let peoples serve thee, And races bow down to thee. Be  lord over thy brethren, And let thy mother's sons bow down to  thee. Cursed be they that curse thee, And blessed be they that  bless thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:30">27:30</a> And it came to pass when Isaac had ended blessing Jacob,  and when Jacob was only just gone out from Isaac his father,  that Esau his brother came from his hunting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:31">27:31</a> And he also had prepared savoury dishes, and he brought  [them] in to his father, and said to his father, Let my father  arise and eat of his son's venison, in order that thy soul may  bless me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:32">27:32</a> And Isaac his father said to him, Who art thou? And he  said, I am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:33">27:33</a> Then Isaac trembled with exceeding great trembling, and  said, Who was he, then, that hunted venison and brought [it] to  me? And I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have  blessed him; also blessed he shall be.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:34">27:34</a> When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a  great and exceeding bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless  me -- me also, my father!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:35">27:35</a> And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and has taken  away thy blessing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:36">27:36</a> And he said, Is it not therefore he was named Jacob, for  he has supplanted me now twice? He took away my birthright, and  behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast  thou not reserved a blessing for me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:37">27:37</a> And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made  him lord over thee, and all his brethren have I given to him  for servants, and with corn and new wine have I supplied him --  and what can I do now for thee, my son?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:38">27:38</a> And Esau said to his father, Hast thou then but one  blessing, my father? bless me -- me also, my father! And Esau  lifted up his voice and wept.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:39">27:39</a> And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, thy  dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, And of the dew  of heaven from above;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:40">27:40</a> And by thy sword shalt thou live; And thou shalt serve thy  brother; And it shall come to pass when thou rovest about, That  thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:41">27:41</a> And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which  his father had blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, The  days of mourning for my father are at hand, and I will slay my  brother Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:42">27:42</a> And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebecca.  And she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him,  Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, comforts himself  that he will kill thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:43">27:43</a> And now, my son, hearken to my voice, and arise, flee to  Laban my brother, to Haran;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:44">27:44</a> and abide with him some days, until thy brother's fury  turn away --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:45">27:45</a> until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he  forget what thou hast done to him; then I will send and fetch  thee thence. Why should I be bereaved even of you both in one  day?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:46">27:46</a> And Rebecca said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because  of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters  of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good  should my life do me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:1">28:1</a> And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him,  and said to him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of  Canaan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:2">28:2</a> Arise, go to Padan-Aram, to the house of Bethuel thy  mother's father, and take a wife thence of the daughters of  Laban thy mother's brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:3">28:3</a> And the Almighty ùGod bless thee, and make thee fruitful  and multiply thee, that thou mayest become a company of  peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:4">28:4</a> And may he give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee and  to thy seed with thee, in order that thou mayest possess the  land of thy sojourning, which God gave to Abraham!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:5">28:5</a> And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to Padan-Aram, to  Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebecca,  Jacob's and Esau's mother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:6">28:6</a> And Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him  away to Padan-Aram, to take a wife thence, blessing him, and  giving him a charge saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the  daughters of Canaan;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:7">28:7</a> and [that] Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother, and  was gone to Padan-Aram.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:8">28:8</a> And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the  sight of Isaac his father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:9">28:9</a> And Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that  he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the  sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:10">28:10</a> And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went towards  Haran.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:11">28:11</a> And he lighted on a certain place, and lodged there,  because the sun had set. And he took [one] of the stones of the  place, and made [it] his pillow, and lay down in that place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:12">28:12</a> And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the  earth, and the top of it reached to the heavens. And behold,  angels of God ascended and descended upon it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:13">28:13</a> And behold, Jehovah stood above it. And he said, I am  Jehovah, the God of Abraham, thy father, and the God of Isaac:  the land on which thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to  thy seed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:14">28:14</a> And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou  shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the  north, and to the south; and in thee and in thy seed shall all  the families of the earth be blessed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:15">28:15</a> And behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all  [places] to which thou goest, and will bring thee again into  this land; for I will not leave thee until I have done what I  have spoken to thee of.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:16">28:16</a> And Jacob awoke from his sleep, and said, Surely Jehovah  is in this place, and I knew [it] not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:17">28:17</a> And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place!  this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate  of heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:18">28:18</a> And Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone  that he had made his pillow, and set it up [for] a pillar, and  poured oil on the top of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:19">28:19</a> And he called the name of that place Beth-el; but the name  of that city was Luz at the first.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:20">28:20</a> And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and  keep me on this road that I go, and will give me bread to eat,  and a garment to put on,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:21">28:21</a> and I come again to my father's house in peace -- then  shall Jehovah be my God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:22">28:22</a> And this stone, which I have set up [for] a pillar, shall  be God's house; and of all that thou wilt give me I will  without fail give the tenth to thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:1">29:1</a> And Jacob continued his journey, and went into the land of  the children of the east.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:2">29:2</a> And he looked, and behold, there was a well in the fields,  and behold there, three flocks of sheep were lying by it; for  out of that well they watered the flocks, and a great stone was  at the mouth of the well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:3">29:3</a> And when all the flocks were gathered there, they rolled  the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep,  and put the stone again on the mouth of the well in its place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:4">29:4</a> And Jacob said to them, My brethren, whence are ye? And  they said, Of Haran are we.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:5">29:5</a> And he said to them, Do ye know Laban the son of Nahor? And  they said, We do know [him].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:6">29:6</a> And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, [He is]  well; and behold, there comes Rachel his daughter with the  sheep.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:7">29:7</a> And he said, Behold, it is yet high day; it is not time  that the cattle should be gathered together; water the sheep,  and go, feed [them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:8">29:8</a> And they said, We cannot until all the flocks are gathered  together, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well,  and we water the sheep.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:9">29:9</a> While he was still speaking to them, Rachel came with her  father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:10">29:10</a> And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of  Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's  brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the  mouth of the well, and watered the sheep of Laban his mother's  brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:11">29:11</a> And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:12">29:12</a> And Jacob told Rachel that he was a brother of her father,  and that he was Rebecca's son; and she ran and told her father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:13">29:13</a> And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob  his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him,  and kissed him, and brought him to his house; and he told Laban  all these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:14">29:14</a> And Laban said to him, Thou art indeed my bone and my  flesh. And he abode with him a month's time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:15">29:15</a> And Laban said to Jacob, Because thou art my brother,  shouldest thou serve me for nothing? tell me, what shall be thy  wages?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:16">29:16</a> And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was  Leah, and the name of the younger, Rachel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:17">29:17</a> And the eyes of Leah were tender; but Rachel was of  beautiful form and beautiful countenance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:18">29:18</a> And Jacob loved Rachel, and said, I will serve thee seven  years for Rachel thy younger daughter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:19">29:19</a> And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee than  that I should give her to another man: abide with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:20">29:20</a> And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they were in  his eyes as single days, because he loved her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:21">29:21</a> And Jacob said to Laban, Give [me] my wife, for my days  are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:22">29:22</a> And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and  made a feast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:23">29:23</a> And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his  daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in to her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:24">29:24</a> And Laban gave to her Zilpah, his maidservant, to be  maidservant to Leah his daughter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:25">29:25</a> And it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it was  Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done to me?  Have I not served thee for Rachel? Why then hast thou deceived  me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:26">29:26</a> And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give  the younger before the firstborn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:27">29:27</a> Fulfil the week [with] this one: then we will give thee  the other one also, for the service that thou shalt serve me  yet seven other years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:28">29:28</a> And Jacob did so, and fulfilled the week [with] this one,  and he gave him Rachel his daughter to be his wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:29">29:29</a> And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, Bilhah, his  maidservant, to be her maidservant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:30">29:30</a> And he went in also to Rachel; and he loved also Rachel  more than Leah. And he served with him yet seven other years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:31">29:31</a> And when Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, he opened her  womb; but Rachel was barren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:32">29:32</a> And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and called his name  Reuben; for she said, Because Jehovah has looked upon my  affliction; for now my husband will love me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:33">29:33</a> And she again conceived, and bore a son, and said, Because  Jehovah has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me  this one also; and she called his name Simeon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:34">29:34</a> And she again conceived, and bore a son, and said, Now  this time will my husband be united to me, for I have borne him  three sons; therefore was his name called Levi.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:35">29:35</a> And she again conceived, and bore a son, and said, This  time will I praise Jehovah; therefore she called his name  Judah. And she ceased to bear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:1">30:1</a> And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel  envied her sister, and said to Jacob, Give me children, or else  I die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:2">30:2</a> And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said,  Am I in God's stead, who has withheld from thee the fruit of  the womb?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:3">30:3</a> And she said, Behold, there is my maid, Bilhah: go in to  her, in order that she may bear on my knees, and I may also be  built up by her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:4">30:4</a> And she gave him Bilhah her maidservant as wife, and Jacob  went in to her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:5">30:5</a> And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:6">30:6</a> And Rachel said, God has done me justice, and has also  heard my voice, and given me a son; therefore she called his  name Dan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:7">30:7</a> And Bilhah Rachel's maidservant again conceived, and bore  Jacob a second son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:8">30:8</a> And Rachel said, Wrestlings of God have I wrestled with my  sister, and have prevailed; and she called his name Naphtali.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:9">30:9</a> And when Leah saw that she had ceased to bear, she took  Zilpah her maidservant and gave her to Jacob as wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:10">30:10</a> And Zilpah Leah's maidservant bore Jacob a son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:11">30:11</a> And Leah said, Fortunately! and she called his name Gad.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:12">30:12</a> And Zilpah Leah's maidservant bore Jacob a second son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:13">30:13</a> And Leah said, Happy am I; for the daughters will call me  blessed! and she called his name Asher.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:14">30:14</a> And Reuben went out in the days of wheat-harvest, and  found mandrakes in the fields; and he brought them to his  mother Leah. And Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of  thy son's mandrakes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:15">30:15</a> And she said to her, Is it [too] little that thou hast  taken my husband, that thou wilt take my son's mandrakes also?  And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for  thy son's mandrakes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:16">30:16</a> And when Jacob came from the fields in the evening, Leah  went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me, for  indeed I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay  with her that night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:17">30:17</a> And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore  Jacob a fifth son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:18">30:18</a> And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I have  given my maidservant to my husband; and she called his name  Issachar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:19">30:19</a> And Leah again conceived, and bore Jacob a sixth son;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:20">30:20</a> and Leah said, God has endowed me with a good dowry; this  time will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him  six sons. And she called his name Zebulun.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:21">30:21</a> And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name  Dinah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:22">30:22</a> And God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and  opened her womb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:23">30:23</a> And she conceived, and bore a son, and said, God has taken  away my reproach.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:24">30:24</a> And she called his name Joseph; and said, Jehovah will add  to me another son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:25">30:25</a> And it came to pass when Rachel had borne Joseph, that  Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my place  and to my country.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:26">30:26</a> Give [me] my wives for whom I have served thee, and my  children; that I may go away, for thou knowest my service which  I have served thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:27">30:27</a> And Laban said to him, I pray thee, if I have found favour  in thine eyes -- I have discovered that Jehovah has blessed me  for thy sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:28">30:28</a> And he said, Appoint to me thy wages, and I will give it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:29">30:29</a> And he said to him, Thou knowest how I have served thee,  and what thy cattle has become with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:30">30:30</a> For it was little that thou hadst before me, and it is  increased to a multitude, and Jehovah has blessed thee from the  time I came; and now, when shall I also provide for my house?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:31">30:31</a> And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou  shalt not give me anything. If thou doest this for me, I will  again feed [and] keep thy flock:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:32">30:32</a> I will pass through all thy flock to-day, to remove thence  all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown lambs,  and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and [that] shall  be my hire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:33">30:33</a> And my righteousness shall answer for me hereafter, when  thou comest about my hire, before thy face: all that is not  speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the  lambs, let that be stolen with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:34">30:34</a> And Laban said, Well, let it be according to thy word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:35">30:35</a> And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstraked  and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and  spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the brown  among the lambs, and gave [them] into the hand of his sons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:36">30:36</a> And he put three days' journey between himself and Jacob.  And Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:37">30:37</a> And Jacob took fresh rods of white poplar, almond-tree,  and maple; and peeled off white stripes in them, uncovering the  white which was on the rods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:38">30:38</a> And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flock,  in the troughs at the watering-places where the flock came to  drink, and they were ardent when they came to drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:39">30:39</a> And the flock was ardent before the rods; and the flock  brought forth ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:40">30:40</a> And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the  flock toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of  Laban; and he made himself separate flocks, and did not put  them with Laban's flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:41">30:41</a> And it came to pass whensoever the strong cattle were  ardent, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock  in the gutters, that they might become ardent among the rods;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:42">30:42</a> but when the sheep were feeble, he put [them] not in; so  the feeble were Laban's, and the strong Jacob's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:43">30:43</a> And the man increased very, very much, and had much  cattle, and bondwomen, and bondmen, and camels, and asses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has  taken away all that was our father's, and of what was our  father's he has acquired all this glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:2">31:2</a> And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and behold, it was  not toward him as previously.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:3">31:3</a> And Jehovah said to Jacob, Return into the land of thy  fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:4">31:4</a> And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the fields to  his flock,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> and said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it  is not toward me as previously; but the God of my father has  been with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:6">31:6</a> And you know that with all my power I have served your  father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:7">31:7</a> And your father has mocked me, and has changed my wages ten  times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:8">31:8</a> If he said thus; The speckled shall be thy hire, then all  the flocks bore speckled; and if he said thus: The ringstraked  shall be thy hire, then all the flocks bore ringstraked.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:9">31:9</a> And God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given  [them] to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:10">31:10</a> And it came to pass at the time of the ardour of the  flocks, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and  behold, the rams that leaped upon the flocks were ringstraked,  speckled, and spotted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:11">31:11</a> And the Angel of God said to me in a dream, Jacob! And I  said, Here am I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:12">31:12</a> And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see: all the rams  that leap upon the flock are ringstraked, speckled, and  spotted; for I have seen all that Laban does to thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:13">31:13</a> I am the ùGod of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar,  where thou vowedst a vow to me. Now arise, depart out of this  land, and return to the land of thy kindred.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:14">31:14</a> And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet  any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:15">31:15</a> Are we not reckoned of him strangers? for he has sold us,  and has even constantly devoured our money.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:16">31:16</a> For all the wealth that God has taken from our father is  ours and our children's; and now whatever God has said to thee  do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:17">31:17</a> And Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon  camels,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:18">31:18</a> and carried away all his cattle, and all his property that  he had acquired -- the cattle of his possessions that he had  acquired in Padan-Aram, to go to Isaac his father, into the  land of Canaan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:19">31:19</a> And Laban had gone to shear his sheep. And Rachel stole  the teraphim that [belonged] to her father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:20">31:20</a> And Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he did not  tell him that he fled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:21">31:21</a> And he fled with all that he had; and he rose up and  passed over the river, and set his face [toward] mount Gilead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:22">31:22</a> And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had  fled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:23">31:23</a> And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him  seven days' journey, and overtook him on mount Gilead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:24">31:24</a> And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and  said to him, Take care thou speak not to Jacob either good or  bad.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:25">31:25</a> And Laban came up with Jacob; and Jacob had pitched his  tent on the mountain; Laban also with his brethren pitched on  mount Gilead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:26">31:26</a> And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou  hast deceived me, and hast carried away my daughters as  captives of war?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:27">31:27</a> Why didst thou flee away covertly, and steal away from me,  and didst not tell me, that I might have conducted thee with  mirth and with songs, with tambour and with harp;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:28">31:28</a> and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?  Now thou hast acted foolishly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:29">31:29</a> It would be in the power of my hand to do you hurt; but  the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Take  care that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:30">31:30</a> And now that thou must needs be gone, because thou greatly  longedst after thy father's house, why hast thou stolen my  gods?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:31">31:31</a> And Jacob answered and said to Laban, I was afraid; for I  said, Lest thou shouldest take by force thy daughters from me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:32">31:32</a> With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live.  Before our brethren discern what is thine with me, and take  [it] to thee. But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:33">31:33</a> And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent,  and into the two handmaids' tents, and found nothing; and he  went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:34">31:34</a> Now Rachel had taken the teraphim and put them under the  camel's saddle; and she sat upon them. And Laban explored all  the tent, but found nothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:35">31:35</a> And she said to her father, Let it not be an occasion of  anger in the eyes of my lord that I cannot rise up before thee,  for it is with me after the manner of women. And he searched  carefully, but did not find the teraphim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:36">31:36</a> And Jacob was angry, and he disputed with Laban. And Jacob  answered and said to Laban, What is my fault, what my sin, that  thou hast so hotly pursued after me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:37">31:37</a> Whereas thou hast explored all my baggage, what hast thou  found of all thy household stuff? Set [it] here before my  brethren and thy brethren, and let them decide between us both.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:38">31:38</a> These twenty years have I been with thee: thy ewes and thy  she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock  I have not eaten.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:39">31:39</a> What was torn I have not brought to thee; I had to bear  the loss of it: of my hand hast thou required it, [whether]  stolen by day or stolen by night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:40">31:40</a> Thus it was with me: in the day the heat consumed me, and  the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:41">31:41</a> I have been these twenty years in thy house: I have served  thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for  thy flock; and thou hast changed my wages ten times.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:42">31:42</a> Had not the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the  fear of Isaac, been with me, it is certain thou wouldest have  sent me away now empty. God has looked upon my affliction and  the labour of my hands, and has judged last night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:43">31:43</a> And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my  daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flock is my flock,  and all that thou seest is mine; but as for my daughters, what  can I do this day to them, or to their sons whom they have  brought forth?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:44">31:44</a> And now, come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let  it be a witness between me and thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:45">31:45</a> And Jacob took a stone, and set it up [for] a pillar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:46">31:46</a> And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones. And they  took stones, and made a heap, and ate there upon the heap.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:47">31:47</a> And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, and Jacob called it  Galeed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:48">31:48</a> And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee  this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:49">31:49</a> -- and Mizpah; for he said, Let Jehovah watch between me  and thee, when we shall be hidden one from another:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:50">31:50</a> if thou shouldest afflict my daughters, or if thou  shouldest take wives besides my daughters, -- no man is with  us; see, God is witness between me and thee!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:51">31:51</a> And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the  pillar which I have set up between me and thee:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:52">31:52</a> [let] this heap be witness, and the pillar a witness, that  neither I pass this heap [to go] to thee, nor thou pass this  heap and this pillar [to come] to me, for harm.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:53">31:53</a> The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their  father, judge between us! And Jacob swore by the fear of his  father Isaac.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:54">31:54</a> And Jacob offered a sacrifice upon the mountain, and  invited his brethren to eat bread: and they ate bread, and  lodged on the mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:55">31:55</a> And Laban rose early in the morning, and kissed his sons  and his daughters, and blessed them; and Laban went and  returned to his place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:1">32:1</a> And Jacob went on his way; and the angels of God met him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:2">32:2</a> And when Jacob saw them he said, This is the camp of God.  And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:3">32:3</a> And Jacob sent messengers before his face to Esau his  brother, into the land of Seir, the fields of Edom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:4">32:4</a> And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak to my  lord, to Esau: Thy servant Jacob speaks thus -- With Laban have  I sojourned and tarried until now;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:5">32:5</a> and I have oxen, and asses, sheep, and bondmen, and  bondwomen; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find  favour in thine eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:6">32:6</a> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to  thy brother, to Esau; and he also is coming to meet thee, and  four hundred men with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:7">32:7</a> Then Jacob was greatly afraid, and was distressed; and he  divided the people that were with him, and the sheep and the  cattle and the camels, into two troops.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:8">32:8</a> And he said, If Esau come to the one troop and smite it,  then the other troop which is left shall escape.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:9">32:9</a> And Jacob said, God of my father Abraham, and God of my  father Isaac, Jehovah, who saidst unto me: Return into thy  country and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:10">32:10</a> -- I am too small for all the loving-kindness and all the  faithfulness that thou hast shewn unto thy servant; for with my  staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two  troops.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:11">32:11</a> Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from  the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me,  [and] the mother with the children.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> And thou saidst, I will certainly deal well with thee, and  make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered  for multitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> And he lodged there that night; and took of what came to  his hand a gift for Esau his brother --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:14">32:14</a> two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats; two hundred  ewes, and twenty rams;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:15">32:15</a> thirty milch camels with their colts; forty kine, and ten  bulls; twenty she-asses, and ten young asses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> And he delivered [them] into the hand of his servants,  every drove by itself; and he said to his servants, Go on  before me, and put a space between drove and drove.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:17">32:17</a> And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my  brother meets thee, and asks thee, saying, Whose art thou, and  where goest thou, and whose are these before thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> -- then thou shalt say, Thy servant Jacob's: it is a gift  sent to my lord, to Esau. And behold, he also is behind us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all  that followed the droves, saying, According to this word shall  ye speak to Esau when ye find him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> And, moreover, ye shall say, Behold, thy servant Jacob is  behind us. For he said, I will propitiate him with the gift  that goes before me, and afterwards I will see his face:  perhaps he will accept me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> And the gift went over before him; and he himself lodged  that night in the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his  two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford  of the Jabbok;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:23">32:23</a> and he took them and led them over the river, and led over  what he had.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:24">32:24</a> And Jacob remained alone; and a man wrestled with him  until the rising of the dawn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> And when he saw that he did not prevail against him, he  touched the joint of his thigh; and the joint of Jacob's thigh  was dislocated as he wrestled with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:26">32:26</a> And he said, Let me go, for the dawn ariseth. And he said,  I will not let thee go except thou bless me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:27">32:27</a> And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> And he said, Thy name shall not henceforth be called  Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast wrestled with God, and with  men, and hast prevailed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:29">32:29</a> And Jacob asked and said, Tell [me], I pray thee, thy  name. And he said, How is it that thou askest after my name?  And he blessed him there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:30">32:30</a> And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel -- For I  have seen God face to face, and my life has been preserved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> And as he passed over Peniel, the sun rose upon him; and  he limped upon his hip.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:32">32:32</a> Therefore the children of Israel do not eat of the sinew  that is over the joint of the thigh, to this day; because he  touched the joint of Jacob's thigh -- the sinew.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau  was coming, and with him four hundred men. And he distributed  the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two  maidservants:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> and he put the maidservants and their children foremost,  and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph  hindmost.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> And he passed on before them, and bowed to the earth seven  times, until he came near to his brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his  neck, and kissed him; and they wept.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:5">33:5</a> And he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the  children, and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The  children that God has graciously given thy servant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:6">33:6</a> And the maidservants drew near, they and their children,  and they bowed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:7">33:7</a> And Leah also, with her children, drew near, and they  bowed. And lastly Joseph drew near, and Rachel, and they bowed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:8">33:8</a> And he said, What [meanest] thou by all the drove which I  met? And he said, To find favour in the eyes of my lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a> And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let what thou  hast be thine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:10">33:10</a> And Jacob said, No, I pray thee; if now I have found  favour in thine eyes, then receive my gift from my hand; for  therefore have I seen thy face, as though I had seen the face  of God, and thou hast received me with pleasure.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:11">33:11</a> Take, I pray thee, my blessing which has been brought to  thee; because God has been gracious to me, and because I have  everything. And he urged him, and he took [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:12">33:12</a> And he said, Let us take our journey, and go on, and I  will go before thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:13">33:13</a> And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are  tender, and the suckling sheep and kine are with me; and if  they should overdrive them only one day, all the flock would  die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:14">33:14</a> Let my lord, I pray thee, pass on before his servant, and  I will drive on at my ease according to the pace of the cattle  that is before me, and according to the pace of the children,  until I come to my lord, to Seir.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:15">33:15</a> And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee [some] of the  people that are with me. And he said, What need? Let me find  favour in the eyes of my lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a> And Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:17">33:17</a> And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house,  and for his cattle he made booths. Therefore the name of the  place was called Succoth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:18">33:18</a> And Jacob came safely [to the] city Shechem, which is in  the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-Aram; and he  encamped before the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:19">33:19</a> And he bought the portion of the field where he had spread  his tent, of the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father,  for a hundred kesitahs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:20">33:20</a> And there he set up an altar, and called it  El-Elohe-Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:1">34:1</a> And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to  Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:2">34:2</a> And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince  of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and  humbled her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:3">34:3</a> And his soul fastened on Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and  he loved the maiden, and spoke consolingly to the maiden.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:4">34:4</a> And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Take me this  girl as wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:5">34:5</a> And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; but  his sons were with his cattle in the fields, and Jacob said  nothing until they came.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:6">34:6</a> And Hamor the father of Shechem came out to Jacob, to speak  to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:7">34:7</a> And the sons of Jacob came from the fields when they heard  [it]; and the men were grieved, and they were very angry,  because he had wrought what was disgraceful in Israel, in lying  with Jacob's daughter, which thing ought not to be done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:8">34:8</a> And Hamor spoke to them, saying, My son Shechem's soul  cleaves to your daughter: I pray you, give her to him as wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:9">34:9</a> And make marriages with us: give your daughters to us, and  take our daughters to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:10">34:10</a> And dwell with us, and the land shall be before you: dwell  and trade in it, and get yourselves possessions in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:11">34:11</a> And Shechem said to her father and to her brethren, Let me  find favour in your eyes; and what ye shall say to me I will  give.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:12">34:12</a> Impose on me very much as dowry and gift, and I will give  according as ye shall say to me; but give me the maiden as  wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:13">34:13</a> And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his  father deceitfully, and spoke -- because he had defiled Dinah  their sister --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:14">34:14</a> and said to them, We cannot do this, to give our sister to  one that is uncircumcised; for that [were] a reproach to us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:15">34:15</a> But only in this will we consent to you, if ye will be as  we, that every male of you be circumcised;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:16">34:16</a> then will we give our daughters to you, and take your  daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and be one people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:17">34:17</a> But if ye do not hearken to us, to be circumcised, then  will we take our daughter and go away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:18">34:18</a> And their words were good in the eyes of Hamor and  Shechem, Hamor's son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:19">34:19</a> And the youth did not delay to do this, because he had  delight in Jacob's daughter. And he was honourable above all in  the house of his father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:20">34:20</a> And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their  city, and spoke to the men of their city, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:21">34:21</a> These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell  in the land, and trade in it. And the land -- behold, it is of  wide extent before them. We will take their daughters as wives,  and give them our daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:22">34:22</a> But only in this will the men consent to us to dwell with  us, to be one people -- if every male among us be circumcised,  just as they are circumcised.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:23">34:23</a> Their cattle, and their possessions, and every beast of  theirs, shall they not be ours? only let us consent to them,  and they will dwell with us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:24">34:24</a> And all that went out at the gate of his city hearkened to  Hamor and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised --  all that went out at the gate of his city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:25">34:25</a> And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,  that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's  brethren, took each his sword, and came upon the city boldly,  and slew all the males.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:26">34:26</a> And Hamor and Shechem his son they slew with the edge of  the sword; and took Dinah out of Shechem's house; and went out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:27">34:27</a> The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the  city, because they had defiled their sister.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:28">34:28</a> Their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and what  [was] in the city, and what [was] in the field they took;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:29">34:29</a> and all their goods, and all their little ones, and their  wives took they captive, and plundered them, and all that was  in the houses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:30">34:30</a> And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, in  that ye make me odious among the inhabitants of the land --  among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and I am few men in  number, and they will gather themselves against me and smite  me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:31">34:31</a> And they said, Should people deal with our sister as with  a harlot?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:1">35:1</a> And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell  there, and make there an altar unto the ùGod that appeared unto  thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:2">35:2</a> And Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with  him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and cleanse  yourselves, and change your garments;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:3">35:3</a> and we will arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make  there an altar to the ùGod that answered me in the day of my  distress, and was with me in the way that I went.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:4">35:4</a> And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods that were in  their hand, and the rings that were in their ears, and Jacob  hid them under the terebinth that [is] by Shechem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:5">35:5</a> And they journeyed; and the terror of God was upon the  cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue  after the sons of Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:6">35:6</a> And Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that  is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:7">35:7</a> And he built there an altar, and called the place  El-beth-el; because there God had appeared to him when he fled  from the face of his brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:8">35:8</a> And Deborah, Rebecca's nurse, died; and she was buried  beneath Bethel, under the oak; and the name of it was called  Allon-bachuth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:9">35:9</a> And God appeared to Jacob again after he had come from  Padan-Aram, and blessed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:10">35:10</a> And God said to him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not  henceforth be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name. And  he called his name Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:11">35:11</a> And God said to him, I am the Almighty ùGod: be fruitful  and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of  thee; and kings shall come out of thy loins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:12">35:12</a> And the land that I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee will I  give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:13">35:13</a> And God went up from him in the place where he had talked  with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:14">35:14</a> And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had talked  with him, a pillar of stone, and poured on it a drink-offering,  and poured oil on it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:15">35:15</a> And Jacob called the name of the place where God had  talked with him, Beth-el.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:16">35:16</a> And they journeyed from Bethel. And there was yet a  certain distance to come to Ephrath, when Rachel travailed in  childbirth; and it went hard with her in her childbearing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:17">35:17</a> And it came to pass when it went hard with her in her  childbearing, that the midwife said to her, Fear not; for this  also is a son for thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:18">35:18</a> And it came to pass as her soul was departing -- for she  died -- that she called his name Benoni; but his father called  him Benjamin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:19">35:19</a> And Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath,  which [is] Bethlehem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:20">35:20</a> And Jacob erected a pillar upon her grave: that is the  pillar of Rachel's grave to [this] day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:21">35:21</a> And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent on the other  side of Migdal-Eder.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:22">35:22</a> And it came to pass when Israel dwelt in that land, that  Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine; and  Israel heard of it. And the sons of Jacob were twelve.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:23">35:23</a> The sons of Leah: Reuben -- Jacob's firstborn -- and  Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:24">35:24</a> The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.</p>

 <p><a name="an_35:26">35:26</a> And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's maidservant: Gad and Asher.  These are the sons of Jacob that were born to him in  Padan-Aram.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:27">35:27</a> And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre -- to  Kirjath-Arba, which is Hebron; where Abraham had sojourned, and  Isaac.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:28">35:28</a> And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:29">35:29</a> And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his  peoples, old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob  buried him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:1">36:1</a> And these are the generations of Esau, that is Edom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:2">36:2</a> Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the  daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of  Anah, daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,</p>

 <p><a name="an_36:7">36:7</a> For their property was too great for them to dwell  together, and the land where they were sojourners could not  bear them, because of their cattle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:8">36:8</a> Thus Esau dwelt in mount Seir; Esau is Edom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:9">36:9</a> And these are the generations of Esau, the father of Edom,  in mount Seir.</p>

 <p><a name="an_37:8">37:8</a> And his brethren said to him, Wilt thou indeed be a king  over us? wilt thou indeed rule over us? And they hated him yet  the more for his dreams and for his words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:9">37:9</a> And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his  brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamt another dream, and  behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:10">37:10</a> And he told [it] to his father and to his brethren. And  his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream  which thou hast dreamt? Shall we indeed come, I and thy mother  and thy brethren, to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:11">37:11</a> And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the  saying.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:12">37:12</a> And his brethren went to feed their father's flock at  Shechem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:13">37:13</a> And Israel said to Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed [the  flock] at Shechem? Come, that I may send thee to them. And he  said to him, Here am I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:14">37:14</a> And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see after the welfare  of thy brethren, and after the welfare of the flock; and bring  me word again. And he sent him out of the vale of Hebron; and  he came towards Shechem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:15">37:15</a> And a man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the  country; and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:16">37:16</a> And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray  thee, where they feed [their flocks].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:17">37:17</a> And the man said, They have removed from this; for I heard  them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his  brethren, and found them at Dothan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:18">37:18</a> And when they saw him from afar, and before he came near  to them, they conspired against him to put him to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:19">37:19</a> And they said one to another, Behold, there comes that  dreamer!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:20">37:20</a> And now come and let us kill him, and cast him into one of  the pits, and we will say, An evil beast has devoured him; and  we will see what becomes of his dreams.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:21">37:21</a> And Reuben heard [it], and delivered him out of their  hand, and said, Let us not take his life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:22">37:22</a> And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood: cast him into this  pit which is in the wilderness; but lay no hand upon him -- in  order that he might deliver him out of their hand, to bring him  to his father again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:23">37:23</a> And it came to pass when Joseph came to his brethren, that  they stripped Joseph of his vest, the vest of many colours,  which he had on;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:24">37:24</a> and they took him and cast him into the pit; now the pit  was empty -- there was no water in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:25">37:25</a> And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their  eyes and looked, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites came from  Gilead; and their camels bore tragacanth, and balsam, and  ladanum -- going to carry [it] down to Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:26">37:26</a> And Judah said to his brethren, What profit is it that we  kill our brother and secrete his blood?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:27">37:27</a> Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites; but let not  our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his  brethren hearkened [to him].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:28">37:28</a> And Midianitish men, merchants, passed by; and they drew  and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the  Ishmaelites for twenty silver-pieces; and they brought Joseph  to Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:29">37:29</a> And Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph [was]  not in the pit; and he rent his garments,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:30">37:30</a> and returned to his brethren, and said, The child is not;  and I, where shall I go?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:31">37:31</a> And they took Joseph's vest, and slaughtered a buck of the  goats, and dipped the vest in the blood;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:32">37:32</a> and they sent the vest of many colours and had it carried  to their father, and said, This have we found: discern now  whether it is thy son's vest or not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:33">37:33</a> And he discerned it, and said, [It is] my son's vest! an  evil beast has devoured him: Joseph is without doubt rent in  pieces!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:34">37:34</a> And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his  loins, and mourned for his son many days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:35">37:35</a> And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort  him, but he refused to be comforted, and said, For I will go  down to my son into Sheol mourning. Thus his father wept for  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:36">37:36</a> And the Midianites sold him into Egypt, to Potiphar, a  chamberlain of Pharaoh, the captain of the life-guard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:1">38:1</a> And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from  his brethren, and turned in to a man of Adullam whose name was  Hirah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:2">38:2</a> And Judah saw there the daughter of a Canaanitish man whose  name was Shua; and he took her, and went in to her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:3">38:3</a> And she conceived and bore a son; and he called his name  Er.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:4">38:4</a> And she again conceived and bore a son, and she called his  name Onan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:5">38:5</a> And again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah;  and he was at Chezib when she bore him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:6">38:6</a> And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name  was Tamar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:7">38:7</a> And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of  Jehovah, and Jehovah slew him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:8">38:8</a> Then Judah said to Onan, Go in to thy brother's wife, and  fulfil to her the brother-in-law's duty, and raise up seed to  thy brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:9">38:9</a> But when Onan knew that the seed should not be his own, it  came to pass when he went in to his brother's wife, that he  spilled [it] on the ground, in order to give no seed to his  brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:10">38:10</a> And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of  Jehovah, and he slew him also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:11">38:11</a> And Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a  widow in thy father's house, until Shelah my son is grown; for  he said, Lest he die also, as his brethren. And Tamar went and  remained in her father's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:12">38:12</a> And as the days were multiplied, Judah's wife, the  daughter of Shua, died. And Judah was comforted, and he went up  to his sheep-shearers, to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the  Adullamite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:13">38:13</a> And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father-in-law is  going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:14">38:14</a> And she put the garments of her widowhood off from her,  and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat  in the entry of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she  saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as  wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:15">38:15</a> And Judah saw her, and took her for a harlot; because she  had covered her face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:16">38:16</a> And he turned aside to her by the way, and said, Come, I  pray thee, let me go in to thee; for he did not know that she  was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me,  that thou mayest come in to me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:17">38:17</a> And he said, I will send [thee] a kid of the goats from  the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give [me] a pledge, until  thou send it?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:18">38:18</a> And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said,  Thy signet, and thy lace, and thy staff which is in thy hand.  And he gave [it] her, and went in to her; and she conceived by  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:19">38:19</a> And she arose and went away; and she laid by her veil from  her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:20">38:20</a> And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his  friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's  hand; but he found her not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:21">38:21</a> And he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the  prostitute that was at Enaim, by the way-side? And they said,  There was no prostitute here.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:22">38:22</a> And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her;  and also the men of the place said, No prostitute has been  here.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:23">38:23</a> Then Judah said, Let her take [it] for herself, lest we be  put to shame. Behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found  her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:24">38:24</a> And it came to pass about three months after, that it was  told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law has committed  fornication, and behold, she is also with child by fornication.  And Judah said, Bring her forth, that she may be burned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:25">38:25</a> When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law,  saying, By the man to whom these [belong] am I with child; and  she said, Acknowledge, I pray thee, whose are this signet, and  this lace, and this staff.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:26">38:26</a> And Judah acknowledged [them], and said, She is more  righteous than I, because I have not given her to Shelah my  son. And he knew her again no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:27">38:27</a> And it came to pass at the time of her delivery, that  behold, twins were in her womb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:28">38:28</a> And it came to pass when she brought forth, that one  stretched out [his] hand, and the midwife took it and bound  round his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:29">38:29</a> And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold,  his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth!  on thee be the breach! And they called his name Pherez.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:30">38:30</a> And afterwards came out his brother, round whose hand was  the scarlet thread; and they called his name Zerah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:1">39:1</a> And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, a  chamberlain of Pharaoh, the captain of the life-guard, an  Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites who had  brought him down thither.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:2">39:2</a> And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man;  and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:3">39:3</a> And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that  Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:4">39:4</a> And Joseph found favour in his eyes, and attended on him;  and he set him over his house, and all that he had he gave into  his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:5">39:5</a> And it came to pass from the time he had set him over his  house and all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's  house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was on all  that he had in the house and in the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:6">39:6</a> And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and took  cognizance of nothing with him, save the bread that he ate. And  Joseph was of a beautiful form and of a beautiful countenance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:7">39:7</a> And it came to pass after these things, that his master's  wife cast her eyes on Joseph, and said, Lie with me!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:8">39:8</a> But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my  master takes cognizance of nothing with me: what is in the  house, and all that he has, he has given into my hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:9">39:9</a> There is none greater in this house than I; neither has he  withheld anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife;  and how should I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:10">39:10</a> And it came to pass as she spoke to Joseph day by day and  he hearkened not to her, to lie with her [and] to be with her,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:11">39:11</a> that on a certain day he went into the house to do his  business, and there was none of the men of the house there in  the house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:12">39:12</a> Then she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me!  But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and ran out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:13">39:13</a> And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his  garment in her hand and had fled forth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:14">39:14</a> that she called to the men of her house, and spoke to  them, saying, See, he has brought in a Hebrew man to us, to  mock us: he came in to me, to lie with me; and I cried with a  loud voice;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:15">39:15</a> and it came to pass when he heard that I lifted up my  voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled and  went out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:16">39:16</a> And she laid his garment by her until his lord came home.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:17">39:17</a> And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The  Hebrew bondman that thou hast brought to us came in to me to  mock me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:18">39:18</a> and it came to pass as I lifted up my voice and cried,  that he left his garment with me, and fled forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:19">39:19</a> And it came to pass when his lord heard the words of his  wife which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did thy  bondman to me, that his wrath was kindled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:20">39:20</a> And Joseph's lord took him and put him into the  tower-house, [the] place where the king's prisoners were  confined; and he was there in the tower-house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:21">39:21</a> And Jehovah was with Joseph, and extended mercy to him,  and gave him favour in the eyes of the chief of the  tower-house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:22">39:22</a> And the chief of the tower-house committed to Joseph's  hand all the prisoners that were in the tower-house; and  whatever they had to do there he did.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:23">39:23</a> The chief of the tower-house looked not to anything under  his hand, because Jehovah was with him; and what he did,  Jehovah made it prosper.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:1">40:1</a> And it came to pass after these things, [that] the  cup-bearer of the king of Egypt and the baker offended their  lord the king of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:2">40:2</a> And Pharaoh was wroth with his two chamberlains -- with the  chief of the cup-bearers and with the chief of the bakers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:3">40:3</a> and he put them in custody into the house of the captain of  the life-guard, into the tower-house, into the place where  Joseph was imprisoned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:4">40:4</a> And the captain of the life-guard appointed Joseph to them,  that he should attend on them. And they were [several] days in  custody.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:5">40:5</a> And they dreamed a dream, both of them in one night, each  his dream, each according to the interpretation of his dream,  the cup-bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were  imprisoned in the tower-house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:6">40:6</a> And Joseph came in to them in the morning, and looked on  them, and behold, they were sad.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:7">40:7</a> And he asked Pharaoh's chamberlains that were with him in  custody in his lord's house, saying, Why are your faces [so]  sad to-day?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:8">40:8</a> And they said to him, We have dreamt a dream, and there is  no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, [Do] not  interpretations [belong] to God? tell me [your dreams], I pray  you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:9">40:9</a> Then the chief of the cup-bearers told his dream to Joseph,  and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:10">40:10</a> and in the vine were three branches; and it was as though  it budded: its blossoms shot forth, its clusters ripened into  grapes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:11">40:11</a> And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes,  and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and gave the cup into  Pharaoh's hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:12">40:12</a> And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it:  the three branches are three days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:13">40:13</a> In yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head and  restore thee to thy place, and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup  into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his  cup-bearer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:14">40:14</a> Only bear a remembrance with thee of me when it goes well  with thee, and deal kindly, I pray thee, with me, and make  mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:15">40:15</a> for indeed I was stolen out of the land of the Hebrews,  and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into  the dungeon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:16">40:16</a> And when the chief of the bakers saw that the  interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my  dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my  head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:17">40:17</a> And in the uppermost basket there were all manner of  victuals for Pharaoh that the baker makes, and the birds ate  them out of the basket upon my head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:18">40:18</a> And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation  of it: the three baskets are three days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:19">40:19</a> In yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head from off  thee, and hang thee on a tree; and the birds will eat thy flesh  from off thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:20">40:20</a> And it came to pass the third day -- Pharaoh's birthday --  that he made a feast to all his bondmen. And he lifted up the  head of the chief of the cup-bearers, and the head of the chief  of the bakers among his bondmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:21">40:21</a> And he restored the chief of the cup-bearers to his office  of cup-bearer again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:22">40:22</a> And he hanged the chief of the bakers, as Joseph had  interpreted to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:23">40:23</a> But the chief of the cup-bearers did not remember Joseph,  and forgot him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:1">41:1</a> And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that  Pharaoh dreamed, and behold, he stood by the river.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:2">41:2</a> And behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,  fine-looking and fat-fleshed, and they fed in the reed-grass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:3">41:3</a> And behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the  river, bad-looking and lean-fleshed, and stood by the kine on  the bank of the river.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:4">41:4</a> And the kine that were bad-looking and lean-fleshed ate up  the seven kine that were fine-looking and fat. And Pharaoh  awoke.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:5">41:5</a> And he slept and dreamed the second time; and behold, seven  ears of corn grew up on one stalk, fat and good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:6">41:6</a> And behold, seven ears, thin and parched with the east  wind, sprung up after them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:7">41:7</a> And the thin ears devoured the seven fat and full ears. And  Pharaoh awoke; and behold, it was a dream.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:8">41:8</a> And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was  troubled; and he sent and called for all the scribes of Egypt,  and all the sages who were therein, and Pharaoh told them his  dream; but [there was] none to interpret them to Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:9">41:9</a> Then spoke the chief of the cup-bearers to Pharaoh, saying,  I remember mine offences this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:10">41:10</a> Pharaoh was wroth with his bondmen, and put me in custody  into the captain of the life-guard's house, me and the chief of  the bakers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:11">41:11</a> And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed  each according to the interpretation of his dream.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:12">41:12</a> And there was there with us a Hebrew youth, a bondman of  the captain of the life-guard, to whom we told [them], and he  interpreted to us our dreams; to each he interpreted according  to his dream.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:13">41:13</a> And it came to pass, just as he interpreted to us, so it  came about: me has he restored to my office, and him he hanged.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:14">41:14</a> Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph; and they brought him  hastily out of the dungeon. And he shaved [himself], and  changed his clothes, and came in to Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:15">41:15</a> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamt a dream, and  there is none to interpret it. And I have heard say of thee,  thou understandest a dream to interpret it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:16">41:16</a> And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God  will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:17">41:17</a> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood  on the bank of the river.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:18">41:18</a> And behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,  fat-fleshed and of fine form, and they fed in the reed-grass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:19">41:19</a> And behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor, and  very ill-formed, and lean-fleshed -- such as I never saw in all  the land of Egypt for badness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:20">41:20</a> And the lean and bad kine ate up the seven first fat kine;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:21">41:21</a> and they came into their belly, and it could not be known  that they had come into their belly; and their look was bad, as  at the beginning. And I awoke.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:22">41:22</a> And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears came up on  one stalk, full and good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:23">41:23</a> And behold, seven ears, withered, thin, parched with the  east wind, sprung up after them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:24">41:24</a> and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears. And I told  it to the scribes; but there was none to make it known to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:25">41:25</a> And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one.  What God will do he has made known to Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:26">41:26</a> The seven fine kine are seven years; and the seven good  ears are seven years: the dream is one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:27">41:27</a> And the seven lean and bad kine that came up after them  are seven years; and the seven empty ears, parched with the  east wind, will be seven years of famine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:28">41:28</a> This is the word which I have spoken to Pharaoh: what God  is about to do he has let Pharaoh see.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:29">41:29</a> Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout  the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:30">41:30</a> And there will arise after them seven years of famine; and  all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the  famine will waste away the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:31">41:31</a> And the plenty will not be known afterwards in the land by  reason of that famine; for it will be very grievous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:32">41:32</a> And as regards the double repetition of the dream to  Pharaoh, it is that the thing is established by God, and God  will hasten to do it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:33">41:33</a> And now let Pharaoh look himself out a man discreet and  wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:34">41:34</a> Let Pharaoh do [this]: let him appoint overseers over the  land, and take the fifth part of the land of Egypt during the  seven years of plenty,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:35">41:35</a> and let them gather all the food of these coming good  years, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, for food in  the cities, and keep [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:36">41:36</a> And let the food be as store for the land for the seven  years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt, that the  land perish not through the famine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:37">41:37</a> And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the  eyes of all his bondmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:38">41:38</a> And Pharaoh said to his bondmen, Shall we find [one] as  this, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:39">41:39</a> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Since God has made all this  known to thee, there is none [so] discreet and wise as thou.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:40">41:40</a> Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy  commandment shall all my people regulate themselves; only  concerning the throne will I be greater than thou.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:41">41:41</a> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all  the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:42">41:42</a> And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it on  Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in clothes of byssus, and put a  gold chain on his neck.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:43">41:43</a> And he caused him to ride in the second chariot that he  had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee! and he set him  over all the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:44">41:44</a> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh; and without thee  shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of  Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:45">41:45</a> And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah, and  gave him as wife Asnath the daughter of Potipherah the priest  in On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:46">41:46</a> And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before  Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh, and  passed through the whole land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:47">41:47</a> And in the seven years of plenty the land brought forth by  handfuls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:48">41:48</a> And he gathered up all the food of the seven years that  was in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities; the  food of the fields of the city, which were round about it, he  laid up in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:49">41:49</a> And Joseph laid up corn as sand of the sea exceeding much,  until they left off numbering; for it was without number.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:50">41:50</a> And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine  came, whom Asnath the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On  bore to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:51">41:51</a> And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh --  For God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's  house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:52">41:52</a> And the name of the second he called Ephraim -- For God  has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:53">41:53</a> And the seven years of plenty that were in the land of  Egypt were ended;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:54">41:54</a> and the seven years of the dearth began to come, according  as Joseph had said. And there was dearth in all lands; but in  all the land of Egypt there was bread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:55">41:55</a> And all the land of Egypt suffered from the dearth. And  the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all  the Egyptians, Go to Joseph: what he says to you, that do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:56">41:56</a> And the famine was on all the earth. And Joseph opened  every place in which there was [provision], and sold grain to  the Egyptians; and the famine was grievous in the land of  Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:57">41:57</a> And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph, to buy  [grain], because the famine was grievous on the whole earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:1">42:1</a> And Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said  to his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:2">42:2</a> And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in  Egypt; go down thither and buy [grain] for us from thence, in  order that we may live, and not die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:3">42:3</a> And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy [grain] out of  Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:4">42:4</a> But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his  brethren; for he said, Lest mischief may befall him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:5">42:5</a> So the sons of Israel came to buy [grain] among those that  came; for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:6">42:6</a> And Joseph, he was the governor over the land -- he it was  that sold [the corn] to all the people of the land. And  Joseph's brethren came and bowed down to him, the face to the  earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:7">42:7</a> And Joseph saw his brethren, and knew them; but he made  himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them, and said to  them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan,  to buy food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:8">42:8</a> And Joseph knew his brethren, but they did not know him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:9">42:9</a> And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamt of  them; and he said to them, Ye are spies: to see the exposed  places of the land ye are come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:10">42:10</a> And they said to him, No, my lord; but to buy food are thy  servants come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:11">42:11</a> We are all one man's sons; we are honest: thy servants are  not spies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:12">42:12</a> And he said to them, No; but to see the exposed places of  the land are ye come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:13">42:13</a> And they said, Thy servants were twelve brethren, sons of  one man, in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is  this day with our father, and one is not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:14">42:14</a> And Joseph said to them, That is it that I have spoken to  you, saying, Ye are spies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:15">42:15</a> By this ye shall be put to the proof: as Pharaoh lives, ye  shall not go forth hence, unless your youngest brother come  hither!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:16">42:16</a> Send one of you, that he may fetch your brother, but ye  shall be imprisoned, and your words shall be put to the proof,  whether the truth is in you; and if not, as Pharaoh lives, ye  are spies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:17">42:17</a> And he put them in custody three days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:18">42:18</a> And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, that ye  may live: I fear God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:19">42:19</a> If ye are honest, let one of your brethren remain bound in  the house of your prison, but go ye, carry grain for the hunger  of your households;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:20">42:20</a> and bring your youngest brother to me, in order that your  words be verified, and that ye may not die. And they did so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:21">42:21</a> Then they said one to another, We are indeed guilty  concerning our brother, whose anguish of soul we saw when he  besought us, and we did not hearken; therefore this distress is  come upon us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:22">42:22</a> And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you,  saying, Do not sin against the lad? But ye did not hearken; and  now behold, his blood also is required.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:23">42:23</a> And they did not know that Joseph understood, for the  interpreter was between them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:24">42:24</a> And he turned away from them, and wept. And he returned to  them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and  bound him before their eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:25">42:25</a> And Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with corn,  and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give  them provision for the way. And thus did they to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:26">42:26</a> And they loaded their asses with their grain, and departed  thence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:27">42:27</a> And one of them opened his sack to give his ass food in  the inn, and saw his money, and behold, it was in the mouth of  his sack.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:28">42:28</a> And he said to his brethren, My money is returned [to me],  and behold, it is even in my sack. And their heart failed  [them], and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is  this [that] God has done to us?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:29">42:29</a> And they came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their  father, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:30">42:30</a> The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and  treated us as spies of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:31">42:31</a> And we said to him, We are honest; we are not spies:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:32">42:32</a> we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not,  and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of  Canaan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:33">42:33</a> And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, Hereby  shall I know that ye are honest: leave one of your brethren  with me, and take [for] the hunger of your households, and go,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:34">42:34</a> and bring your youngest brother to me, and I shall know  that ye are not spies, but are honest. Your brother will I give  up to you; and ye may trade in the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:35">42:35</a> And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that  behold, every man had his bundle of money in his sack; and they  saw their bundles of money, they and their father, and were  afraid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:36">42:36</a> And Jacob their father said to them, Ye have bereaved me  of children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take  Benjamin! All these things are against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:37">42:37</a> And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons  if I bring him not back to thee: give him into my hand, and I  will bring him to thee again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:38">42:38</a> But he said, My son shall not go down with you, for his  brother is dead, and he alone is left; and if mischief should  befall him by the way in which ye go, then would ye bring down  my grey hairs with sorrow to Sheol.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:1">43:1</a> And the famine was grievous in the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:2">43:2</a> And it came to pass, when they had finished eating the  grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said  to them, Go again, buy us a little food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:3">43:3</a> And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man did positively  testify to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, unless your  brother be with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:4">43:4</a> If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and  buy thee food;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:5">43:5</a> but if thou do not send [him], we will not go down, for the  man said to us, Ye shall not see my face, unless your brother  be with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:6">43:6</a> And Israel said, Why did ye deal [so] ill with me [as] to  tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:7">43:7</a> And they said, The man asked very closely after us, and  after our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye a  brother? And we told him according to the tenor of these words.  Could we at all know that he would say, Bring your brother  down?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:8">43:8</a> And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the lad with me,  and we will arise and go, that we may live, and not die, both  we and thou and our little ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:9">43:9</a> I will be surety for him: of my hand shalt thou require  him; if I bring him not to thee, and set him before thy face,  then shall I be guilty toward thee for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:10">43:10</a> For had we not lingered, we should now certainly have  returned already twice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:11">43:11</a> And their father Israel said to them, If it is then so, do  this: take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and  carry down the man a gift: a little balsam and a little honey,  tragacanth and ladanum, pistacia-nuts and almonds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:12">43:12</a> And take other money in your hand, and the money that was  returned to you in the mouth of your sacks, carry back in your  hand: perhaps it is an oversight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:13">43:13</a> And take your brother, and arise, go again to the man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:14">43:14</a> And the Almighty ùGod give you mercy before the man, that  he may send away your other brother and Benjamin! And I, if I  be bereaved of children, am bereaved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:15">43:15</a> And the men took that gift, and took double money in their  hand, and Benjamin, and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and  came before Joseph.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:16">43:16</a> And Joseph saw Benjamin with them, and said to the [man]  who was over his house, Bring the men into the house, and  slaughter cattle, and make ready; for the men shall eat with me  at noon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:17">43:17</a> And the man did as Joseph had said; and the man brought  the men into Joseph's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:18">43:18</a> And the men were afraid because they were brought into  Joseph's house, and said, Because of the money that was  returned to us in our sacks at the beginning are we brought in,  that he may turn against us, and fall upon us and take us for  bondmen, and our asses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:19">43:19</a> And they came up to the man that was over Joseph's house,  and they spoke to him at the door of the house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:20">43:20</a> and said, Ah! my lord, we came indeed down at the first to  buy food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:21">43:21</a> And it came to pass when we came to the inn, that we  opened our sacks, and behold, [every] man's money was in the  mouth of his sack, our money according to its weight; and we  have brought it again in our hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:22">43:22</a> And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy  food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:23">43:23</a> And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the  God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; your  money came to me. And he brought Simeon out to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:24">43:24</a> And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave  water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses  food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:25">43:25</a> And they made ready the gift for Joseph's coming at noon;  for they had heard that they should eat bread there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:26">43:26</a> When Joseph came home, they brought him the gift that was  in their hand, into the house, and bowed themselves to him to  the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:27">43:27</a> And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your  father well -- the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:28">43:28</a> And they said, Thy servant our father is well; he is yet  alive. And they bowed, and made obeisance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:29">43:29</a> And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin,  his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother of  whom ye spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to thee, my  son!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:30">43:30</a> And Joseph made haste, for his bowels burned for his  brother; and he sought [a place] to weep, and he went into the  chamber, and wept there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:31">43:31</a> And he washed his face, and came out, and controlled  himself, and said, Set on bread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:32">43:32</a> And they set on for him by himself, and for them by  themselves, and for the Egyptians who ate with him by  themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the  Hebrews, for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:33">43:33</a> And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his  birthright, and the youngest according to his youth; and the  men marvelled one at another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:34">43:34</a> And he had portions carried to them from before him. And  Benjamin's portion was five times greater than the portions of  them all. And they drank, and made merry with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:1">44:1</a> And he commanded him who was over his house, saying, Fill  the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry; and put  every man's money in the mouth of his sack.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:2">44:2</a> And put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of  the youngest, and his grain-money. And he did according to the  word of Joseph which he had spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:3">44:3</a> In the morning, when it was light, the men were sent away,  they and their asses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:4">44:4</a> They were gone out of the city, [and] not [yet] far off,  when Joseph said to him who was over his house, Up! follow  after the men; and when thou overtakest them, thou shalt say to  them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:5">44:5</a> Is not this [it] in which my lord drinks, and in which  indeed he divines? Ye have done evil [in] what ye have done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:6">44:6</a> And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:7">44:7</a> And they said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as  these? Far be it from thy servants to do such a thing!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:8">44:8</a> Behold, the money that we found in our sacks' mouths we  have brought again to thee from the land of Canaan; and how  should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:9">44:9</a> With whomsoever of thy servants it is found, let him die;  and we also will be my lord's bondmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:10">44:10</a> And he said, Now also [let] it [be] according to your  words: let him with whom it is found be my bondman, but ye  shall be blameless.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:11">44:11</a> And they hasted and laid down every man his sack on the  ground, and opened every man his sack.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:12">44:12</a> And he searched carefully: he began at the eldest, and  ended at the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin's  sack.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:13">44:13</a> Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his  ass, and they returned to the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:14">44:14</a> And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he  was still there; and they fell down before him to the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:15">44:15</a> And Joseph said to them, What deed is this which ye have  done? Did ye not know that such a man as I can certainly  divine?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:16">44:16</a> And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall  we speak, and how justify ourselves? God has found out the  iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are my lord's bondmen,  both we, and he in whose hand the cup has been found.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:17">44:17</a> And he said, Far be it from me to do so! The man in whose  hand the cup has been found, he shall be my bondman; but as for  you, go up in peace to your father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:18">44:18</a> Then Judah came near to him, and said, Ah! my lord, let  thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and  let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even  as Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:19">44:19</a> My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a  brother?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:20">44:20</a> And we said to my lord, We have an aged father, and a  child born to him in his old age, [yet] young; and his brother  is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father  loves him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:21">44:21</a> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down to me,  that I may set mine eye on him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:22">44:22</a> And we said to my lord, The youth cannot leave his father:  if he should leave his father, [his father] would die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:23">44:23</a> And thou saidst to thy servants, Unless your youngest  brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:24">44:24</a> And it came to pass when we came up to thy servant my  father, we told him the words of my lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:25">44:25</a> And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:26">44:26</a> But we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be  with us, then will we go down; for we cannot see the man's face  unless our youngest brother is with us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:27">44:27</a> And thy servant my father said to us, Ye know that my wife  bore me two [sons];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:28">44:28</a> and the one went out from me, and I said, He must  certainly have been torn in pieces; and I have not seen him  [again] hitherto.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:29">44:29</a> And if ye take this one also from me, and mischief should  befall him, ye will bring down my grey hairs with misery to  Sheol.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:30">44:30</a> And now, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad  is not with us, -- seeing that his life is bound up with his  life,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:31">44:31</a> it will come to pass when he sees that the lad is not  [there], that he will die; and thy servants will bring down the  grey hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:32">44:32</a> For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father,  saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I shall be guilty  toward my father all my days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:33">44:33</a> And now, let thy servant stay, I pray thee, instead of the  lad a bondman to my lord, and let the lad go up with his  brethren;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:34">44:34</a> for how should I go up to my father if the lad were not  with me? -- lest I see the evil that would come on my father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:1">45:1</a> And Joseph could not control himself before all them that  stood by him, and he cried, Put every man out from me! And no  man stood with him when Joseph made himself known to his  brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:2">45:2</a> And he raised his voice in weeping; and the Egyptians  heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:3">45:3</a> And Joseph said to his brethren, I am Joseph. Does my  father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him, for  they were troubled at his presence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:4">45:4</a> And Joseph said to his brethren, Come near to me, I pray  you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother,  whom ye sold into Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:5">45:5</a> And now, be not grieved, and be not angry with yourselves,  that ye sold me hither, for God sent me before you to preserve  life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:6">45:6</a> For the famine has been these two years in the land; and  yet there are five years in which there will be neither  ploughing nor harvest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:7">45:7</a> So God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the  earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:8">45:8</a> And now it was not you [that] sent me here, but God; and he  has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and  governor over all the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:9">45:9</a> Haste and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus says thy  son Joseph: God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me,  tarry not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:10">45:10</a> And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt  be near to me, thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, and thy  sheep, and thy cattle, and all that thou hast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:11">45:11</a> And there will I maintain thee; for yet there are five  years of famine; in order that thou be not impoverished, thou,  and thy household, and all that thou hast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:12">45:12</a> And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother  Benjamin, that it is my mouth which speaks to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:13">45:13</a> And tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all  that ye have seen, and haste and bring down my father hither.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:14">45:14</a> And he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and  Benjamin wept on his neck.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:15">45:15</a> And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them; and  after that his brethren talked with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:16">45:16</a> And the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,  Joseph's brethren are come. And it was good in the eyes of  Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his bondmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:17">45:17</a> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to thy brethren, Do this:  load your beasts and depart, go into the land of Canaan,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:18">45:18</a> and take your father and your households, and come to me;  and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall  eat the fat of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:19">45:19</a> And thou art commanded -- this do: take waggons out of the  land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and take  up your father, and come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:20">45:20</a> And let not your eye regret your stuff; for the good of  all the land of Egypt shall be yours.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:21">45:21</a> And the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them  waggons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them  provision for the way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:22">45:22</a> To each one of them all he gave changes of clothing; but  to Benjamin he gave three hundred [pieces] of silver and five  changes of clothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:23">45:23</a> And to his father he sent this: ten asses laden with the  good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and  bread, and food for his father by the way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:24">45:24</a> And he sent his brethren away, and they departed. And he  said to them, Do not quarrel on the way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:25">45:25</a> And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of  Canaan to Jacob their father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:26">45:26</a> And they told him, saying, Joseph is still alive, and he  is governor over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted,  for he did not believe them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:27">45:27</a> And they spoke to him all the words of Joseph, which he  had spoken to them. And he saw the waggons that Joseph had sent  to carry him. And the spirit of Jacob their father revived.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:28">45:28</a> And Israel said, It is enough: Joseph my son is yet alive;  I will go and see him before I die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:1">46:1</a> And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came  to Beer-sheba; and he offered sacrifices to the God of his  father Isaac.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:2">46:2</a> And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night and  said, Jacob, Jacob! And he said, Here am I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:3">46:3</a> And he said, I am ùGod, the God of thy father: fear not to  go down to Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:4">46:4</a> I will go down with thee to Egypt, and I will also  certainly bring thee up; and Joseph shall put his hand on thine  eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:5">46:5</a> And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Israel  carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their  wives, on the waggons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:6">46:6</a> And they took their cattle, and their goods which they had  acquired in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, Jacob and  all his seed with him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:7">46:7</a> his sons and his sons' sons with him, his daughters and his  sons' daughters and all his seed he brought with him to Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:8">46:8</a> And these are the names of the sons of Israel who came into  Egypt: Jacob and his sons. Jacob's firstborn, Reuben.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:9">46:9</a> And the sons of Reuben: Enoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and  Carmi.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:10">46:10</a> -- And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad,  and Jachin, and Zohar, and Saul the son of a Canaanitish woman.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:11">46:11</a> -- And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:12">46:12</a> -- And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and  Pherez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.  And the sons of Pherez were Hezron and Hamul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:13">46:13</a> -- And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puah, and Job, and  Shimron.</p>

 <p><a name="an_46:15">46:15</a> -- These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in  Padan-Aram; and his daughter, Dinah. All the souls of his sons  and his daughters were thirty-three.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:16">46:16</a> And the sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon,  Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:17">46:17</a> -- And the sons of Asher: Jimnah, and Jishvah, and Jishvi,  and Beriah; and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah:  Heber and Malchiel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:18">46:18</a> -- These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah  his daughter; and she bore these to Jacob: sixteen souls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:19">46:19</a> The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:20">46:20</a> And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and  Ephraim, whom Asnath bore to him, the daughter of Potipherah  the priest in On.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:21">46:21</a> -- And the sons of Benjamin: Belah, and Becher, and  Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and  Ard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:22">46:22</a> -- These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob:  all the souls were fourteen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:23">46:23</a> And the sons of Dan: Hushim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:24">46:24</a> -- And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer,  and Shillem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:25">46:25</a> -- These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel  his daughter; and she bore these to Jacob: all the souls were  seven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:26">46:26</a> All the souls that came with Jacob to Egypt, that had come  out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives: all the souls  were sixty-six.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:27">46:27</a> And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt, were  two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob that came to  Egypt were seventy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:28">46:28</a> And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to give notice  before he came to Goshen. And they came into the land of  Goshen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:29">46:29</a> Then Joseph yoked his chariot, and went up to meet Israel  his father, to Goshen, and he presented himself to him; and he  fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:30">46:30</a> And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, after I have  seen thy face, since thou still livest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:31">46:31</a> And Joseph said to his brethren and to his father's house,  I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and say to him, My brethren and  my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come to  me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:32">46:32</a> and the men are shepherds, for they have been occupied  with cattle; and they have brought their sheep, and their  cattle, and all that they have.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:33">46:33</a> And it shall come to pass that when Pharaoh shall call you  and say, What is your occupation?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:34">46:34</a> then ye shall say, Thy servants are men that have been  occupied with cattle from our youth even until now, both we and  our fathers; in order that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen;  for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:1">47:1</a> And Joseph came and told Pharaoh and said, My father and my  brethren, and their sheep and their cattle, and all that they  have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are  in the land of Goshen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:2">47:2</a> And he took from the whole number of his brethren, five  men, and set them before Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:3">47:3</a> And Pharaoh said to his brethren, What is your occupation?  And they said to Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we  and our fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:4">47:4</a> And they said to Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we  come; for there is no pasture for the sheep that thy servants  have, for the famine is grievous in the land of Canaan; and  now, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of  Goshen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:5">47:5</a> And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy  brethren are come to thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:6">47:6</a> The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land  settle thy father and thy brethren: let them dwell in the land  of Goshen. And if thou knowest men of activity among them, then  set them as overseers of cattle over what I have.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:7">47:7</a> And Joseph brought Jacob his father, and set him before  Pharaoh. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:8">47:8</a> And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the  years of thy life?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:9">47:9</a> And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my  sojourning are a hundred and thirty years. Few and evil have  been the days of the years of my life, and they do not attain  to the days of the years of the life of my fathers, in the days  of their sojourning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:10">47:10</a> And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:11">47:11</a> And Joseph settled his father and his brethren, and gave  them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the  land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:12">47:12</a> And Joseph maintained his father, and his brethren, and  all his father's household, with bread, according to the number  of the little ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:13">47:13</a> And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was  very grievous; and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan  were exhausted through the famine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:14">47:14</a> And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the  land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which  they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:15">47:15</a> And when money came to an end in the land of Egypt and in  the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, saying,  Give us bread! for why should we die before thee? for [our]  money is all gone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:16">47:16</a> And Joseph said, Give your cattle, and I will give you for  your cattle, if [your] money be all gone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:17">47:17</a> And they brought their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave  them bread for horses, and for flocks of sheep, and for herds  of cattle, and for asses; and he fed them with bread for all  their cattle that year.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:18">47:18</a> And that year ended; and they came to him the second year,  and said to him, We will not hide [it] from my lord that since  [our] money is come to an end, and the herds of cattle are in  the possession of my lord, nothing is left before my lord but  our bodies and our land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:19">47:19</a> Why should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?  Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be  bondmen to Pharaoh; and give seed, that we may live, and not  die, and that the land be not desolate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:20">47:20</a> And Joseph bought all the soil of Egypt for Pharaoh; for  the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine  prevailed over them; and the land became Pharaoh's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:21">47:21</a> And as for the people, he removed them into the cities,  from [one] end of the borders of Egypt even to the [other] end  of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:22">47:22</a> Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the  priests had an assigned portion from Pharaoh, and ate their  assigned portion which Pharaoh had given them; so they did not  sell their land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:23">47:23</a> And Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you  this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you,  and sow the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:24">47:24</a> And it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall  give the fifth to Pharaoh, and the four parts shall be your  own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of  your households, and for food for your little ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:25">47:25</a> And they said, Thou hast saved us alive. Let us find  favour in the eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's  bondmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:26">47:26</a> And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this  day, [that] the fifth should be for Pharaoh, except the land of  the priests: theirs alone did not become Pharaoh's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:27">47:27</a> And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of  Goshen; and they had possessions in it, and were fruitful and  multiplied exceedingly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:28">47:28</a> And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; and  the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred and  forty-seven years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:29">47:29</a> And the days of Israel approached that he should die. And  he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found  favour in thine eyes, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my  thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray  thee, in Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:30">47:30</a> but when I shall lie with my fathers, thou shalt carry me  out of Egypt, and bury me in their sepulchre. And he said, I  will do according to thy word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:31">47:31</a> And he said, Swear to me; and he swore to him. And Israel  worshipped on the bed's head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:1">48:1</a> And it came to pass after these things, that one told  Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick. And he took with him his  two sons Manasseh and Ephraim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:2">48:2</a> And one told Jacob and said, Behold, thy son Joseph is  coming to thee. And Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon  the bed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:3">48:3</a> And Jacob said to Joseph, The Almighty ùGod appeared to me  at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:4">48:4</a> and he said to me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful and  multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples;  and will give this land to thy seed after thee [for] an  everlasting possession.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:5">48:5</a> And now thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of  Egypt before I came to thee into Egypt, shall be mine: Ephraim  and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:6">48:6</a> And thy family which thou hast begotten after them shall be  thine: they shall be called after the name of their brethren in  their inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:7">48:7</a> And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in  the land of Canaan on the way, when there was yet a certain  distance to come to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way  to Ephrath, that is, Bethlehem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:8">48:8</a> And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:9">48:9</a> And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God  has given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, to me,  that I may bless them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:10">48:10</a> But the eyes of Israel were heavy from age: he could not  see. And he brought them nearer to him; and he kissed them, and  embraced them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:11">48:11</a> And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy  face; and behold, God has let me see also thy seed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:12">48:12</a> And Joseph brought them out from his knees, and bowed down  with his face to the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:13">48:13</a> And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand  toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward  Israel's right hand, and brought [them] near to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:14">48:14</a> But Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid [it] on  Ephraim's head -- now he was the younger -- and his left hand  on Manasseh's head; guiding his hands intelligently, for  Manasseh was the firstborn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:15">48:15</a> And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my  fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God that shepherded me  all my life long to this day,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:16">48:16</a> the Angel that redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads;  and let my name be named upon them, and the name of my fathers  Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the  midst of the land!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:17">48:17</a> When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the  head of Ephraim, it was evil in his eyes; and he took hold of  his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to  Manasseh's head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:18">48:18</a> And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this  is the firstborn: put thy right hand on his head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:19">48:19</a> But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know:  he also will become a people, and he also will be great; but  truly his younger brother will be greater than he; and his seed  will become the fulness of nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:20">48:20</a> And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel  bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and Manasseh! And he  set Ephraim before Manasseh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:21">48:21</a> And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; and God will be  with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:22">48:22</a> And *I* have given to thee one tract [of land] above thy  brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my  sword and with my bow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:1">49:1</a> And Jacob called his sons, and said, Gather yourselves  together, and I will tell you what will befall you at the end  of days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:2">49:2</a> Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob, And listen  to Israel your father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:3">49:3</a> Reuben, thou art my firstborn, My might, and the  firstfruits of my vigour: Excellency of dignity, and excellency  of strength.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:4">49:4</a> Impetuous as the waters, thou shalt have no pre-eminence;  Because thou wentest up to thy father's couch: Then defiledst  thou [it]: he went up to my bed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:5">49:5</a> Simeon and Levi are brethren: Instruments of violence their  swords.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:6">49:6</a> My soul, come not into their council; Mine honour, be not  united with their assembly; For in their anger they slew men,  And in their wantonness houghed oxen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:7">49:7</a> Cursed be their anger, for it [was] violent; And their  rage, for it [was] cruel! I will divide them in Jacob, And  scatter them in Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:8">49:8</a> Judah -- [as to] thee, thy brethren will praise thee; Thy  hand will be upon the neck of thine enemies; Thy father's  children will bow down to thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:9">49:9</a> Judah is a young lion; From the prey, my son, thou art gone  up. He stoopeth, he layeth himself down as a lion, And as a  lioness: who will rouse him up?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:10">49:10</a> The scepter will not depart from Judah, Nor the lawgiver  from between his feet, Until Shiloh come, And to him will be  the obedience of peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:11">49:11</a> He bindeth his foal to the vine, And his ass's colt to the  choice vine; He washeth his dress in wine, And his garment in  the blood of grapes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:12">49:12</a> The eyes are red with wine, And the teeth [are] white with  milk.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:13">49:13</a> Zebulun will dwell at the shore of the seas; Yea, he will  be at the shore of the ships, And his side [toucheth] upon  Sidon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:14">49:14</a> Issachar is a bony ass, Crouching down between two  hurdles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:15">49:15</a> And he saw the rest that it was good, And the land that it  was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And was a  tributary servant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:16">49:16</a> Dan will judge his people, As another of the tribes of  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:17">49:17</a> Dan will be a serpent on the way, A horned snake on the  path, Which biteth the horse's heels, So that the rider falleth  backwards.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:18">49:18</a> I wait for thy salvation, O Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:19">49:19</a> Gad -- troops will rush upon him; But he will rush upon  the heel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:20">49:20</a> Out of Asher, his bread shall be fat, And he will give  royal dainties.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:21">49:21</a> Naphtali is a hind let loose; He giveth goodly words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:22">49:22</a> Joseph is a fruitful bough; A fruitful bough by a well;  [His] branches shoot over the wall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:23">49:23</a> The archers have provoked him, And shot at, and hated him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:24">49:24</a> But his bow abideth firm, And the arms of his hands are  supple By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob. From thence is  the shepherd, the stone of Israel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:25">49:25</a> From the ùGod of thy father, and he will help thee; And  from the Almighty, and he will bless thee -- With blessings of  heaven from above, With blessings of the deep that lieth under,  With blessings of the breast and of the womb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:26">49:26</a> The blessings of thy father surpass the blessings of my  ancestors, Unto the bounds of the everlasting hills: They shall  be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him  that was separated from his brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:27">49:27</a> Benjamin -- [as] a wolf will he tear to pieces; In the  morning he will devour the prey, And in the evening he will  divide the booty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:28">49:28</a> All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is  what their father spoke to them; and he blessed them: every one  according to his blessing he blessed them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:29">49:29</a> And he charged them, and said to them, I am gathered to my  people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the  field of Ephron the Hittite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:30">49:30</a> in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is  opposite to Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought  of Ephron the Hittite along with the field for a possession of  a sepulchre.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:31">49:31</a> There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they  buried Isaac and Rebecca his wife; and there I buried Leah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:32">49:32</a> The purchase of the field, and of the cave that is in it,  was from the children of Heth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:33">49:33</a> And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he  gathered his feet into the bed, and expired, and was gathered  to his peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:1">50:1</a> And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him,  and kissed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:2">50:2</a> And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm  his father. And the physicians embalmed Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:3">50:3</a> And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled  the days of those who are embalmed. And the Egyptians mourned  for him seventy days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:4">50:4</a> And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke  to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favour in  your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:5">50:5</a> My father made me swear, saying, Behold, I die; in my grave  which I have dug myself in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou  bury me. And now, let me go up, I pray thee, that I may bury my  father; and I will come again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:6">50:6</a> And Pharaoh said, Go up and bury thy father, according as  he made thee swear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:7">50:7</a> And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up  all the bondmen of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all  the elders of the land of Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:8">50:8</a> and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his  father's house; only their little ones, and their flocks, and  their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:9">50:9</a> And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and  the camp was very great.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:10">50:10</a> And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is  beyond the Jordan; and there they lamented with a great and  very grievous lamentation; and he made a mourning for his  father of seven days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:11">50:11</a> And the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the  mourning at the threshing-floor of Atad, and they said, This is  a grievous mourning of the Egyptians. Therefore the name of it  was called Abel-Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:12">50:12</a> And his sons did to him according as he had commanded  them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:13">50:13</a> and his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and  buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah which Abraham  had bought along with the field, for a possession of a  sepulchre, of Ephron the Hittite, opposite to Mamre.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:14">50:14</a> And, after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to  Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that had gone up with him  to bury his father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:15">50:15</a> And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,  they said, If now Joseph should be hostile to us, and should  indeed requite us all the evil that we did to him!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:16">50:16</a> And they sent a messenger to Joseph, saying, Thy father  commanded before he died, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:17">50:17</a> Thus shall ye speak to Joseph: Oh forgive, I pray thee,  the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin! for they did  evil to thee. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression  of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when  they spoke to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:18">50:18</a> And his brethren also went and fell down before his face,  and said, Behold, we are thy bondmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:19">50:19</a> And Joseph said to them, Fear not: am I then in the place  of God?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:20">50:20</a> Ye indeed meant evil against me: God meant it for good, in  order that he might do as [it is] this day, to save a great  people alive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:21">50:21</a> And now, fear not: I will maintain you and your little  ones. And he comforted them, and spoke consolingly to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:22">50:22</a> And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house; and  Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:23">50:23</a> And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third  [generation]; the sons also of Machir the son of Manasseh were  born on Joseph's knees.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:24">50:24</a> And Joseph said to his brethren, I die; and God will  certainly visit you, and bring you up out of this land, into  the land that he swore unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:25">50:25</a> And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying,  God will certainly visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones  hence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:26">50:26</a> And Joseph died, a hundred and ten years old; and they  embalmed him; and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</p>
