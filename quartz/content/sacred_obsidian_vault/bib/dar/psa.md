  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Psalms</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the  wicked, and standeth not in the way of sinners, and sitteth not  in the seat of scorners;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> But his delight is in Jehovah's law, and in his law doth he  meditate day and night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And he [is] as a tree planted by brooks of water, which  giveth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf fadeth not; and  all that he doeth prospereth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> The wicked are not so; but are as the chaff which the wind  driveth away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor  sinners in the assembly of the righteous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of  the wicked shall perish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> Why are the nations in tumultuous agitation, and [why] do  the peoples meditate a vain thing?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the princes plot  together, against Jehovah and against his anointed:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away their cords  from us!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh, the Lord shall  have them in derision.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Then will he speak to them in his anger, and in his fierce  displeasure will he terrify them:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> And *I* have anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my  holiness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> I will declare the decree: Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou  art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> Ask of me, and I will give thee nations for an inheritance,  and for thy possession the ends of the earth:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Thou shalt break them with a sceptre of iron, as a potter's  vessel thou shalt dash them in pieces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> And now, O kings, be ye wise, be admonished, ye judges of  the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way,  though his anger burn but a little. Blessed are all who have  their trust in him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> {A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.}  Jehovah, how many are they that trouble me, many they that rise  up against me!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> Many say of my soul, There is no salvation for him in God.  Selah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> But thou, Jehovah, art a shield about me; my glory, and the  lifter up of my head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> With my voice will I call to Jehovah, and he will answer me  from the hill of his holiness. Selah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> I laid me down and slept; I awaked, for Jehovah sustaineth  me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> I will not fear for myriads of the people that have set  themselves against me round about.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Arise, Jehovah; save me, my God! For thou hast smitten all  mine enemies upon the cheekbone, thou hast broken the teeth of  the wicked.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Salvation is of Jehovah; thy blessing is upon thy people.  Selah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> {To the chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A Psalm of  David.} When I call, answer me, O God of my righteousness: in  pressure thou hast enlarged me; be gracious unto me, and hear  my prayer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> Ye sons of men, till when is my glory [to be put] to shame?  [How long] will ye love vanity, will ye seek after a lie?  Selah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> But know that Jehovah hath set apart the pious [man] for  himself: Jehovah will hear when I call unto him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Be moved with anger, and sin not; meditate in your own  hearts upon your bed, and be still. Selah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Offer sacrifices of righteousness, and confide in Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> Many say, Who shall cause us to see good? Lift up upon us  the light of thy countenance, O Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Thou hast put joy in my heart, more than in the time that  their corn and their new wine was in abundance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; for thou,  Jehovah, alone makest me to dwell in safety.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> {To the chief Musician. Upon Nehiloth. A Psalm of David.}  Give ear to my words, O Jehovah; consider my meditation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> Hearken unto the voice of my crying, my king and my God; for  to thee will I pray.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; in the  morning will I address myself to thee, and will look up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> For thou art not a ùGod that hath pleasure in wickedness;  evil shall not sojourn with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> Insolent fools shall not stand before thine eyes; thou  hatest all workers of iniquity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: Jehovah abhorreth a  man of blood and deceit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> But as for me, in the greatness of thy loving-kindness will  I enter thy house; I will bow down toward the temple of thy  holiness in thy fear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Lead me, Jehovah, in thy righteousness, because of my foes;  make thy way plain before me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> For there is no certainty in their mouth; their inward part  is perversion, their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter  with their tongue.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> Bring guilt upon them, O God; let them fall by their own  counsels: drive them out in the multitude of their  transgressions, for they have rebelled against thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And all that trust in thee shall rejoice: for ever shall  they shout joyously, and thou wilt protect them; and they that  love thy name shall exult in thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> For thou, Jehovah, wilt bless the righteous [man]; with  favour wilt thou surround him as [with] a shield.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> {To the chief Musician. On stringed instruments, upon  Sheminith. A Psalm of David.} Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine  anger, and chasten me not in thy hot displeasure.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> Be gracious unto me, Jehovah, for I am withered; Jehovah,  heal me, for my bones tremble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And my soul trembleth exceedingly: and thou, Jehovah, till  how long?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> Return, Jehovah, free my soul; save me for thy  loving-kindness' sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> For in death there is no remembrance of thee; in Sheol who  shall give thanks unto thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> I am wearied with my groaning; all the night make I my bed  to swim; I dissolve my couch with my tears.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> Mine eye wasteth away through grief; it hath grown old  because of all mine oppressors.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for Jehovah hath  heard the voice of my weeping.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> Jehovah hath heard my supplication; Jehovah receiveth my  prayer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> All mine enemies shall be ashamed and tremble exceedingly;  they will turn, they will be ashamed suddenly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> {Shiggaion of David, which he sang to Jehovah, concerning  the words of Cush the Benjaminite.} Jehovah my God, in thee  have I trusted: save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, crushing it while there is  no deliverer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> Jehovah my God, if I have done this, if there be iniquity in  my hands;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me;  (indeed I have freed him that without cause oppressed me;)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> Let the enemy pursue after my soul, and take [it], and let  him tread down my life to the earth, and lay my glory in the  dust. Selah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> Arise, Jehovah, in thine anger; lift thyself up against the  raging of mine oppressors, and awake for me: thou hast  commanded judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> And the assembly of the peoples shall encompass thee; and  for their sakes return thou on high.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> Jehovah shall minister judgment to the peoples. Judge me,  Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and according to mine  integrity which is in me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> Oh let the wrong of the wicked come to an end, and establish  thou the righteous [man]; even thou that triest the hearts and  reins, the righteous God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> My shield is with God, who saveth the upright in heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> God is a righteous judge, and a ùGod who is indignant all  the day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> If one turn not, he will sharpen his sword; he hath bent  his bow and made it ready,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> And he hath prepared for him instruments of death; his  arrows hath he made burning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, yea, he hath conceived  mischief, and brought forth falsehood:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> He digged a pit, and hollowed it out, and is fallen into  the hole that he made.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his  violence shall come down upon his own pate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> I will praise Jehovah according to his righteousness, and  will sing forth the name of Jehovah the Most High.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> {To the chief Musician. Upon the Gittith. A Psalm of David.}  Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!  who hast set thy majesty above the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou  established praise because of thine adversaries, to still the  enemy and the avenger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> When I see thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon  and stars, which thou hast established;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of  man, that thou visitest him?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast  crowned him with glory and splendour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> Thou hast made him to rule over the works of thy hands; thou  hast put everything under his feet:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> Sheep and oxen, all of them, and also the beasts of the  field;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> The fowl of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea,  [whatever] passeth through the paths of the seas.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the  earth!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> {To the chief Musician. Upon Muthlabben. A Psalm of David.}  I will praise Jehovah with my whole heart; I will recount all  thy marvellous works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> I will be glad and rejoice in thee; I will sing forth thy  name, O Most High.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> When mine enemies turned back, they stumbled and perished at  thy presence:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> For thou hast maintained my right and my cause. Thou sittest  on the throne, judging righteously.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the  wicked; thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> O enemy! destructions are ended for ever. -- Thou hast also  destroyed cities, even the remembrance of them hath perished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> But Jehovah sitteth for ever; he hath ordained his throne  for judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And it is he that will judge the world with righteousness;  he shall execute judgment upon the peoples with equity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And Jehovah will be a refuge to the oppressed one, a refuge  in times of distress.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And they that know thy name will confide in thee; for thou,  Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> Sing psalms to Jehovah who dwelleth in Zion; tell among the  peoples his doings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth  them; the cry of the afflicted ones hath he not forgotten.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> Be gracious unto me, O Jehovah; consider mine affliction  from them that hate me, lifting me up from the gates of death:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> That I may declare all thy praise in the gates of the  daughter of Zion. I will be joyful in thy salvation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> The nations are sunk down in the pit [that] they made; in  the net that they hid is their own foot taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> Jehovah is known [by] the judgment he hath executed: the  wicked is ensnared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion.  Selah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> The wicked shall be turned into Sheol, all the nations that  forget God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> For the needy one shall not be forgotten alway; the hope of  the meek shall not perish for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> Arise, Jehovah; let not man prevail: let the nations be  judged in thy sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> Put them in fear, Jehovah: that the nations may know  themselves to be but men. Selah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Why, Jehovah, standest thou afar off? [Why] hidest thou  thyself in times of distress?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> The wicked, in his pride, doth hotly pursue the afflicted.  They shall be taken in the devices that they have imagined.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> For the wicked boasteth of his soul's desire, and he  blesseth the covetous; he contemneth Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> The wicked [saith], in the haughtiness of his countenance,  He doth not search out: all his thoughts are, There is no God!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> His ways always succeed; thy judgments are far above out of  his sight; [as for] all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved; from  generation to generation I shall be in no adversity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> His mouth is full of cursing, and deceit, and oppression;  under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; in the  secret places doth he slay the innocent: his eyes watch for the  wretched.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> He lieth in wait secretly, like a lion in his thicket; he  lieth in wait to catch the afflicted: he doth catch the  afflicted, drawing him into his net.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> He croucheth, he boweth down, that the wretched may fall  by his strong ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> He saith in his heart, ùGod hath forgotten, he hideth his  face, he will never see [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> Arise, Jehovah; O ùGod, lift up thy hand: forget not the  afflicted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? He hath said in his  heart, Thou wilt not require [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> Thou hast seen [it], for thou thyself beholdest trouble  and vexation, to requite by thy hand. The wretched committeth  himself unto thee; thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> Break thou the arm of the wicked, and as for the evil man,  seek out his wickedness [till] thou find none.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> Jehovah is King for ever and ever: the nations have  perished out of his land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> Jehovah, thou hast heard the desire of the meek, thou hast  established their heart: thou causest thine ear to hear,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> To do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed one,  that the man of the earth may terrify no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> {To the chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David.} In Jehovah  have I put my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee [as] a bird to  your mountain?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> For behold, the wicked bend the bow, they make ready their  arrow upon the string, that they may in darkness shoot at the  upright in heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> If the foundations be destroyed, what shall the righteous  do?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> Jehovah [is] in the temple of his holiness; Jehovah, -- his  throne is in the heavens: his eyes behold, his eyelids try the  children of men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> Jehovah trieth the righteous one; but the wicked, and him  that loveth violence, his soul hateth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone;  and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> For righteous is Jehovah; he loveth righteousness, his  countenance doth behold the upright.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> {To the chief Musician. Upon Sheminith. A Psalm of David.}  Save, Jehovah, for the godly man is gone; for the faithful have  failed from among the children of men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> They speak falsehood every one with his neighbour: [with]  flattering lip, with a double heart, do they speak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that  speaketh proud things,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail, our lips  are our own: who [is] lord over us?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> Because of the oppression of the afflicted, because of the  sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith Jehovah, I will  set [him] in safety, at whom they puff.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> The words of Jehovah are pure words, silver tried in the  furnace of earth, purified seven times.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> Thou, Jehovah, wilt keep them, thou wilt preserve them from  this generation for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> The wicked walk about on every side, when vileness is  exalted among the children of men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> {To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David.} How long,  Jehovah, wilt thou forget me for ever? how long wilt thou hide  thy face from me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> How long shall I take counsel in my soul, with sorrow in my  heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> Consider, answer me, O Jehovah my God! lighten mine eyes,  lest I sleep the [sleep of] death;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him! [lest]  mine adversaries be joyful when I am moved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> As for me, I have confided in thy loving-kindness; my heart  shall be joyful in thy salvation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> I will sing unto Jehovah, for he hath dealt bountifully  with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> {To the chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David.} The fool hath  said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted  themselves, they have done abominable works: there is none that  doeth good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> Jehovah looked down from the heavens upon the children of  men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did  seek God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> They have all gone aside, they are together become corrupt:  there is none that doeth good, not even one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, eating up my  people [as] they eat bread? They call not upon Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> There were they in great fear; for God is in the generation  of the righteous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> Ye have shamed the counsel of the afflicted, because  Jehovah [was] his refuge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When  Jehovah turneth again the captivity of his people, Jacob shall  be glad, Israel shall rejoice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> {A Psalm of David.} Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tent?  who shall dwell in the hill of thy holiness?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and  speaketh the truth from his heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> [He that] slandereth not with his tongue, doeth not evil to  his companion, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> In whose eyes the depraved person is contemned, and who  honoureth them that fear Jehovah; who, if he have sworn to his  own hurt, changeth it not;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> [He that] putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh  reward against the innocent. He that doeth these [things] shall  never be moved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> {Michtam of David.} Preserve me, O ùGod: for I trust in  thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> Thou [my soul] hast said to Jehovah, Thou art the Lord: my  goodness [extendeth] not to thee; --</p>

 <p><a name="an_78:31">78:31</a> When the anger of God went up against them; and he slew  the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:32">78:32</a> For all this, they sinned still, and believed not in his  marvellous works;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:33">78:33</a> And he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in  terror.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:34">78:34</a> When he slew them, then they sought him, and returned and  sought early after ùGod;</p>

 <p><a name="an_78:36">78:36</a> But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied unto him  with their tongue;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:37">78:37</a> For their heart was not firm toward him, neither were they  stedfast in his covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:38">78:38</a> But he was merciful: he forgave the iniquity, and  destroyed [them] not; but many a time turned he his anger away,  and did not stir up all his fury:</p>

 <p><a name="an_78:42">78:42</a> They remembered not his hand, the day when he delivered  them from the oppressor,</p>

 <p><a name="an_78:49">78:49</a> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and  indignation, and distress, -- a mission of angels of woes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:50">78:50</a> He made a way for his anger; he spared not their soul from  death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:51">78:51</a> And he smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the first-fruits  of their vigour in the tents of Ham.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:52">78:52</a> And he made his own people to go forth like sheep, and  guided them in the wilderness like a flock;</p>

 <p><a name="an_78:55">78:55</a> And he drove out the nations before them, and allotted  them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel  to dwell in their tents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:56">78:56</a> But they tempted and provoked God, the Most High, and kept  not his testimonies,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:57">78:57</a> And they drew back and dealt treacherously like their  fathers: they turned like a deceitful bow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:58">78:58</a> And they provoked him to anger with their high places, and  moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:59">78:59</a> God heard, and was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:60">78:60</a> And he forsook the tabernacle at Shiloh, the tent where he  had dwelt among men,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:61">78:61</a> And gave his strength into captivity, and his glory into  the hand of the oppressor;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:62">78:62</a> And delivered up his people unto the sword, and was very  wroth with his inheritance:</p>

 <p><a name="an_78:69">78:69</a> And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the  earth which he hath founded for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:70">78:70</a> And he chose David his servant, and took him from the  sheepfolds:</p>
