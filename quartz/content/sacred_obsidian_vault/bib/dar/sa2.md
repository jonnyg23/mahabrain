  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: 2 Samuel</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David had  returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, that David abode  two days in Ziklag.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> And it came to pass on the third day, that behold, a man  came out of the camp from Saul with his garments rent, and  earth upon his head; and as soon as he came to David, he fell  to the earth and did obeisance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And David said to him, Whence comest thou? And he said to  him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And David said to him, What has taken place? I pray thee,  tell me. And he said that the people had fled from the battle,  and many of the people also had fallen and died, and that Saul  and Jonathan his son were dead also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And David said to the young man that told him, How knowest  thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And the young man that told him said, I happened by chance  to be upon mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul leaned on his spear;  and behold, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> And he looked behind him, and saw me, and called to me. And  I said, Here am I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And he said to me, Who art thou? And I said to him, I am an  Amalekite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> He said to me again, Stand, I pray thee, over me, and slay  me; for anguish has seized me; for my life is yet whole in me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> So I stood over him, and put him to death, for I knew that  he would not live after his fall; and I took the crown that was  upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have  brought them hither to my lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Then David took hold of his garments and rent them; and all  the men that were with him [did] likewise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even for Saul,  and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and  for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And David said to the young man that told him, Whence art  thou? And he said, I am the son of an Amalekite stranger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And David said to him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch  forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah's anointed?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> Then David called one of the young men and said, Draw near,  [and] fall on him. And he smote him that he died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And David said to him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy  mouth has testified against thee, saying, I have slain  Jehovah's anointed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over  Jonathan his son;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> and he bade them teach the children of Judah [the song of]  the bow. Behold, it is written in the book of Jasher: --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are  the mighty fallen!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> Tell [it] not in Gath, carry not the tidings in the streets  of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,  Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, no rain upon  you, nor fields of heave-offerings! For there the shield of the  mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, [as] not  anointed with oil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,  The bow of Jonathan turned not back, And the sword of Saul  returned not empty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in their lives,  Even in their death were not divided; They were swifter than  eagles, they were stronger than lions.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in  scarlet with splendour, Who put ornaments of gold upon your  apparel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!  Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very  pleasant wast thou unto me; Thy love to me was wonderful,  passing women's love.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> How are the mighty fallen, and the instruments of war  perished!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And it came to pass after this that David inquired of  Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah?  And Jehovah said to him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I  go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam  the Jizreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man  with his household; and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David  king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, It  is the men of Jabesh-Gilead that have buried Saul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead, and  said to them, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, that ye have shewn this  kindness to your lord, to Saul, and have buried him!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> And now Jehovah shew kindness and faithfulness to you; and I  also will requite you this good, because ye have done this  thing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And now let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for  your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have  anointed me king over them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took  Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> and made him king over Gilead, and over the Asshurites, and  over Jizreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to  reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. However, the house  of Judah followed David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house  of Judah was seven years and six months.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth  the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David,  went out. And they met together by the pool of Gibeon; and they  sat down, these on the one side of the pool, and those on the  other side of the pool.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise and  make sport before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And they arose and went over by number, twelve for  Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the  servants of David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and  [thrust] his sword in his fellow's side, and they fell down  together. And that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is  by Gibeon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And the battle that day was very severe; and Abner and the  men of Israel were routed before the servants of David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and  Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was swift of foot, as one of  the gazelles that are in the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not  to the right hand nor to the left from behind Abner.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel?  And he said, I am.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside, to thy right hand  or to thy left, and lay hold of one of the young men, and take  for thyself his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from  following him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from  following me: why should I smite thee to the ground? how then  should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> But he refused to turn aside; therefore Abner with the  hinder end of the spear smote him in the belly, so that the  spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in  the same place. And it came to pass, that as many as came to  the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> And Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner; and the sun went  down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah  on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together  after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of a  hill.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> And Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour  for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the  latter end? and how long shall it be ere thou bid the people  return from following their brethren?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> And Joab said, [As] God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken,  surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one  from following his brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> And Joab blew the trumpet, and all the people stood still,  and pursued after Israel no more, neither did they fight any  more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> And Abner and his men walked all that night through the  plain, and passed over the Jordan, and went through all  Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:30">2:30</a> And Joab returned from following Abner, and gathered all  the people together; and there lacked of David's servants  nineteen men, and Asahel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:31">2:31</a> And the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of  Abner's men, three hundred and sixty men, who had died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:32">2:32</a> And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of  his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went  all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And the war was long between the house of Saul and the house  of David; but David became continually stronger, and the house  of Saul became continually weaker.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And to David were sons born in Hebron: his firstborn was  Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jizreelitess;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the  Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maachah, daughter  of Talmai king of Geshur;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,  Shephatiah the son of Abital;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah David's wife. These were  born to David in Hebron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And it came to pass while there was war between the house of  Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for  the house of Saul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter  of Aiah. And [Ishbosheth] said to Abner, Why hast thou gone in  to my father's concubine?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and  said, Am I a dog's head, I who against Judah do shew kindness  this day to the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and  to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of  David, that thou reproachest me this day with the fault of this  woman?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> So do God to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah has sworn  to David, I do not so to him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> to translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set  up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan  even to Beer-sheba!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he  feared him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying,  Whose is the land? saying [also], Make thy covenant with me,  and behold, my hand shall be with thee, to turn all Israel to  thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> And he said, Well, I will make a covenant with thee; only I  require one thing of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face,  except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou  comest to see my face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying,  Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I espoused to me for a hundred  foreskins of the Philistines.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from [her] husband, from  Phaltiel the son of Laish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to  Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return. And he returned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel,  saying, Ye sought for David aforetime to be king over you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> and now do [it], for Jehovah has spoken of David, saying,  By my servant David will I save my people Israel out of the  hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their  enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner  went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that  seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house  of Benjamin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him.  And David made Abner and the men that were with him a repast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will  gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a  covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that  thy heart desires. And David sent Abner away; and he went in  peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from an  expedition, and brought in a great spoil with them; but Abner  was no longer with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away,  and he had gone in peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> And Joab and all the host that was with him came; and they  told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and  he has sent him away; and he is gone in peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?  behold, Abner came to thee; why is it [that] thou hast sent him  away, and he is gone?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive  thee, to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all  that thou doest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers  after Abner, who brought him again from the well of Sirah; but  David did not know it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside  in the gate to speak with him secretly, and smote him there in  the belly, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:28">3:28</a> And afterwards David heard [it], and he said, I and my  kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever from the blood of  Abner the son of Ner:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:29">3:29</a> let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's  house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that  has an issue, or that is a leper, or that leans on a staff, or  that falls by the sword, or that lacks bread!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:30">3:30</a> So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he  had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:31">3:31</a> And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were  with him, Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with  sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the  bier.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:32">3:32</a> And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his  voice and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:33">3:33</a> And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Should Abner  die as a fool dieth?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:34">3:34</a> Thy hands were not bound, Nor thy feet put into fetters; As  a man falleth before wicked men, Fellest thou! And all the  people wept again over him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:35">3:35</a> And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while  it was yet day; but David swore, saying, So do God to me, and  more also, if I taste bread or aught else till the sun be down!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:36">3:36</a> And all the people remarked it, and it pleased them; as  whatever the king did pleased all the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:37">3:37</a> And all the people and all Israel understood that day that  it was not of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:38">3:38</a> And the king said to his servants, Know ye not that there  is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:39">3:39</a> And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these  men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too hard for me: Jehovah reward  the doer of evil according to his wickedness!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his  hands were enfeebled, and all Israel was troubled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And Saul's son had two men, captains of bands: the name of  the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons  of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin; for  Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And the Beerothites had fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners  there until this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And Jonathan Saul's son had a son that was lame of [his]  feet. He was five years old when the news came of Saul and  Jonathan out of Jizreel; and his nurse took him up and fled.  And it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell,  and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah,  went and came in about the heat of the day into the house of  Ishbosheth, who was taking his noonday rest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And they came thither into the midst of the house, [as  though] they would fetch wheat; and they smote him in the  belly; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> They came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his  bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him;  and they took his head, and went by the way of the plain all  night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David in Hebron,  and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of  Saul, thine enemy who sought thy life; and Jehovah has given to  my lord the king to be avenged this day of Saul and of his  seed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> Then David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons  of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, [As] Jehovah  liveth, who has redeemed my soul out of all distress,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead! and he was  in his own sight a messenger of good, I took hold of him, and  slew him in Ziklag -- to whom forsooth I should give a reward  for his good tidings:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> how much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous  person in his own house upon his bed? and should I not now  demand his blood of your hand, and take you away from the  earth?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and  cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged [them] up over  the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and  buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and  spoke, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> Even aforetime, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he  that leddest out and broughtest in Israel; and Jehovah said to  thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be  prince over Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and  king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah;  and they anointed David king over Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> David was thirty years old when he began to reign; he  reigned forty years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months;  and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel  and Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the  Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land; and they spoke to  David, saying, Thou shalt not come in hither, but the blind and  the lame will drive thee back; as much as to say, David will  not come in hither.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> But David took the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of  David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And David said on that day, Whoever smites the Jebusites and  gets up to the watercourse, and the lame and the blind hated of  David's soul ...! Therefore they say, The blind and the lame  shall not come into the house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> So David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of  David. And David built round about from the Millo and inward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And David became continually greater; and Jehovah the God  of hosts was with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber  of cedars, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a  house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king  over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom because of his  people Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> And David took him more concubines and wives out of  Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron; and there were yet  sons and daughters born to David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> And these are the names of those that were born to him in  Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> And the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king  over Israel, and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and  David heard [of it], and went down to the stronghold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the  valley of Rephaim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up  against the Philistines? wilt thou give them into my hand? And  Jehovah said to David, Go up; for I will certainly give the  Philistines into thy hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there;  and he said, Jehovah has broken in upon mine enemies before me,  as the breaking forth of waters. Therefore he called the name  of that place Baal-perazim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> And they left their images there, and David and his men  took them away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread  themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> And David inquired of Jehovah; and he said, Thou shalt not  go up; turn round behind them and come upon them opposite the  mulberry-trees.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> And it shall be, when thou hearest a sound of marching in  the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir  thyself; for then will Jehovah have gone forth before thee, to  smite the army of the Philistines.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> And David did so, as Jehovah had commanded him; and smote  the Philistines from Geba until thou comest to Gezer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> And David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel,  thirty thousand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> And David arose and went with all the people that were with  him from Baale-Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God  which is called by the name, the name of Jehovah of hosts who  sitteth between the cherubim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it  out of the house of Abinadab, which was upon the hill; and  Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And they brought it with the ark of God out of the house of  Abinadab which was upon the hill; and Ahio went before the ark.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And David and all the house of Israel played before Jehovah  on all manner of [instruments made of] cypress wood, with  harps, and with lutes, and with tambours, and with sistra, and  with cymbals.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> And when they came to Nachon's threshing-floor, Uzzah  reached after the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen  had stumbled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah; and God  smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And David was indignant, because Jehovah had made a breach  upon Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-Uzzah to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And David was afraid of Jehovah that day, and said, How  shall the ark of Jehovah come to me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> So David would not bring the ark of Jehovah home unto  himself into the city of David; but David carried it aside into  the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-Edom  the Gittite three months; and Jehovah blessed Obed-Edom and all  his household.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And it was told king David, saying, Jehovah has blessed the  house of Obed-Edom, and all that is his, because of the ark of  God. And David went and brought up the ark of God from the  house of Obed-Edom into the city of David with joy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of Jehovah  had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatted beast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> And David danced before Jehovah with all his might; and  David was girded with a linen ephod.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> And David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of  Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> And as the ark of Jehovah came into the city of David,  Michal the daughter of Saul looked through a window, and saw  king David leaping and dancing before Jehovah; and she despised  him in her heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> And they brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its  place, in the midst of the tent that David had spread for it.  And David offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> And when David had ended offering up the burnt-offerings  and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of  Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> And he dealt to all the people, to the whole multitude of  Israel, both men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a  measure [of wine], and a raisin-cake. And all the people  departed every one to his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> And David returned to bless his household. And Michal the  daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How  honourable did the king of Israel make himself to-day, who  uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his  servants, as one of the lewd fellows shamelessly uncovers  himself!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> And David said to Michal, It was before Jehovah, who chose  me rather than thy father, and than all his house, to appoint  me ruler over the people of Jehovah, over Israel; and I played  before Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> And I will make myself yet more vile than thus, and will be  base in mine own sight; and of the handmaids that thou hast  spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of  her death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And it came to pass when the king dwelt in his house, and  Jehovah had given him rest round about from all his enemies,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> that the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell  in a house of cedars, and the ark of God dwells under curtains.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy  heart; for Jehovah is with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> And it came to pass that night that the word of Jehovah came  to Nathan, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> Go and say to my servant, to David, Thus saith Jehovah: Wilt  thou build me a house for me to dwell in?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought  up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but I  went about in a tent and in a tabernacle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> In all my going about with all the children of Israel, did I  speak a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded  to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye me not a house  of cedars?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> And now, thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus  saith Jehovah of hosts: I took thee from the pasture-grounds,  from following the sheep, to be prince over my people, over  Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and  have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made  thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are  on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And I will appoint a place for my people, for Israel, and  will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own,  and be disturbed no more; neither shall the sons of wickedness  afflict them any more, as formerly,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> and since the time that I commanded judges to be over my  people Israel. And I have given thee rest from all thine  enemies; and Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a  house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy  fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed  out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> It is he who shall build a house for my name, and I will  establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit  iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the  stripes of the sons of men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> but my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it  from Saul, whom I put away from before thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made firm for ever  before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> According to all these words, and according to all this  vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> And king David went in and sat before Jehovah, and said,  Who am I, Lord Jehovah, and what is my house, that thou hast  brought me hitherto?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> And yet this hath been a small thing in thy sight, Lord  Jehovah; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a  great while to come. And is this the manner of man, Lord  Jehovah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> And what can David say more to thee? for thou, Lord  Jehovah, knowest thy servant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast  thou done all this greatness, to make thy servant know [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> Wherefore thou art great, Jehovah Elohim; for there is none  like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to  all that we have heard with our ears.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> And who is like thy people, like Israel, the one nation in  the earth that God went to redeem to be a people to himself,  and to make himself a name, and to do for them great things and  terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou  redeemedst to thyself from Egypt, from the nations and their  gods?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> And thou hast established to thyself thy people Israel to  be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, Jehovah, art become  their God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> And now, Jehovah Elohim, the word that thou hast spoken  concerning thy servant and concerning his house, fulfil it for  ever, and do as thou hast said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:26">7:26</a> And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of  hosts is God over Israel; and let the house of thy servant  David be established before thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:27">7:27</a> For thou, Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, hast  revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house;  therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this  prayer unto thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:28">7:28</a> And now, Lord Jehovah, thou art that God, and thy words are  true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:29">7:29</a> and now let it please thee to bless the house of thy  servant, that it may be before thee for ever; for thou, Lord  Jehovah, hast spoken it; and with thy blessing shall the house  of thy servant be blessed for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And after this it came to pass that David smote the  Philistines, and subdued them; and David took the power of the  capital out of the hand of the Philistines.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And he smote the Moabites, and measured them with a line,  making them lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines  to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. And the  Moabites became David's servants, [and] brought gifts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And David smote Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,  as he went to recover his dominion by the river Euphrates.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> And David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen,  and twenty thousand footmen; and David houghed all the chariot  [horses], but reserved of them [for] a hundred chariots.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of  Zobah, and David smote of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> And David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the  Syrians became servants to David, [and] brought gifts. And  Jehovah preserved David whithersoever he went.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants  of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king  David took exceeding much bronze.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> And Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the  forces of Hadadezer;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> and Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to inquire of his  welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against  Hadadezer and smitten him; for Hadadezer was continually at war  with Toi. And he brought with him vessels of silver, and  vessels of gold, and vessels of bronze.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> Them also king David dedicated to Jehovah, with the silver  and the gold that he had dedicated of all the nations that he  had subdued:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> of the Syrians, and of the Moabites, and of the children of  Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of the Amalekites, and of  the spoil of Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And David made him a name when he returned, after he had  smitten the Syrians in the valley of salt, eighteen thousand  [men].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And he put garrisons in Edom: throughout Edom did he put  garrisons; and all they of Edom became servants to David. And  Jehovah preserved David whithersoever he went.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed  judgment and justice to all his people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and  Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was chronicler;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of  Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was scribe;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites  and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house  of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was  Ziba; and they called him to David. And the king said to him,  Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of  Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God to him? And Ziba said  to the king, Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame on [his] feet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the  king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel,  in Lodebar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> And king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of  Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came  to David, and fell on his face and did obeisance. And David  said, Mephibosheth. And he said, Behold thy servant!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> And David said to him, Fear not; for I will certainly shew  thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore  thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread  at my table continually.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that  thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> Then the king called Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him,  I have given to thy master's son all that belonged to Saul and  to all his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And thou, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the  land for him, and thou shalt bring in [the fruits], that thy  master's son may have food to eat. And Mephibosheth thy  master's son shall eat bread at my table continually. Now Ziba  had fifteen sons and twenty servants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And Ziba said to the king, According to all that my lord  the king has commanded his servant, so will thy servant do. And  Mephibosheth [said David] shall eat at my table, as one of the  king's sons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And  all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants to  Mephibosheth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he did eat  continually at the king's table. And he was lame on both his  feet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> And it came to pass after this that the king of the  children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> And David said, I will shew kindness to Hanun the son of  Nahash, as his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent to  comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And  David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun  their lord, Is it, in thine eyes, to honour thy father that  David has sent comforters to thee? Is it not to search the city  and to spy it out, and to overthrow it, that David has sent his  servants to thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> And Hanun took David's servants, and had the one half of  their beards shaved off, and their raiment cut off in the  midst, as far as their buttocks, and sent them away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> And they told [it] to David; and he sent to meet them, for  the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Abide at  Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves  odious to David; and the children of Ammon sent and hired the  Syrians of Beth-Rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand  footmen, and the king of Maacah [with] a thousand men, and the  men of Tob twelve thousand men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> And David heard [of it], and he sent Joab, and all the  host, the mighty men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in  array at the entrance of the gate; and the Syrians of Zoba and  of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in  the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> And Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him  before and behind; and he chose out of all the choice men of  Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> and the rest of the people he gave into the hand of  Abishai his brother that he might array them against the  children of Ammon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then  thou shalt help me; and if the children of Ammon be too strong  for thee, then I will come and help thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> Be strong, and let us shew ourselves valiant for our  people and for the cities of our God; and Jehovah do what is  good in his sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> And Joab drew near, and the people that were with him,  unto the battle against the Syrians; and they fled before him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians fled,  they fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. And Joab  returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> And when the Syrians saw that they were routed before  Israel, they gathered themselves together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> And Hadarezer sent, and drew forth the Syrians that were  beyond the river; and they came to Helam; and Shobach the  captain of the host of Hadarezer [went] before them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and  passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set  themselves in array against David, and fought with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the  Syrians seven hundred [in] chariots, and forty thousand  horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died  there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> And all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that  they were routed before Israel, and they made peace with  Israel, and served them. And the Syrians feared to help the  children of Ammon any more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time  when kings go forth, that David sent Joab, and his servants  with him, and all Israel; and they laid waste the [land of the]  children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David abode at  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> And it came to pass at evening time that David arose from  off his couch, and walked upon the roof of the king's house;  and from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was  very beautiful;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> and David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said,  Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of  Urijah the Hittite?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to  him, and he lay with her; and she had purified herself from her  uncleanness; and she returned to her house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said,  I am with child.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> And David sent to Joab [saying], Send me Urijah the  Hittite. And Joab sent Urijah to David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> And when Urijah had come to him, David asked how Joab  prospered, and how the people prospered, and how the war  prospered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> And David said to Urijah, Go down to thy house and wash thy  feet. And Urijah departed out of the king's house, and there  followed him presents from the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And Urijah slept at the entrance of the king's house with  all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> And they had told David saying, Urijah did not go down to  his house; and David said to Urijah, Art thou not come from a  journey? why didst thou not go down to thy house?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> And Urijah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah  abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,  are encamped in the open fields: shall I then go into my house,  to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? [As] thou livest,  and [as] thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> And David said to Urijah, Abide here to-day also, and  to-morrow I will let thee depart. And Urijah abode in Jerusalem  that day and the morrow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> And David invited him, and he ate and drank before him;  and he made him drunk. And in the evening he went out to lie on  his couch with the servants of his lord, but did not go down to  his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a  letter to Joab, and sent it by Urijah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> And he wrote in the letter saying, Set Urijah in the front  of the thickest fight, and withdraw from him, that he may be  smitten and die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> And it came to pass as Joab watched the city, that he  assigned Urijah to a place where he knew that the valiant men  were.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> And the men of the city went out and fought with Joab; and  there fell some of the people, of the servants of David; and  Urijah the Hittite died also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> Then Joab sent and told David all the matters of the war;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> and charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast ended  telling the matters of the war to the king,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> and if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say to  thee, Why did ye go so near to the city to fight? did ye not  know that they would shoot from the wall?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a  woman cast the upper stone of a handmill from the wall, that he  died in Thebez? why did ye go near the wall? -- then say thou,  Thy servant Urijah the Hittite is dead also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> And the messenger went; and he came and told David all  that Joab had sent him for.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against  us, and came out against us into the field, and we were upon  them as far as the entrance of the gate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:24">11:24</a> And the shooters shot from upon the wall against thy  servants; and some of the king's servants are dead, and thy  servant Urijah the Hittite is dead also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:25">11:25</a> Then David said to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to  Joab: Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devours  one as well as another: make thy battle strong against the  city, and overthrow it; -- and encourage him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:26">11:26</a> And the wife of Urijah heard that Urijah her husband was  dead, and she mourned for her husband.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:27">11:27</a> And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her  to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But  the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> And Jehovah sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and  said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and  the other poor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> The rich had very many flocks and herds;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> but the poor man had nothing at all, but one little ewe  lamb which he had bought, and was nourishing; and it grew up  with him, and together with his children: it ate of his morsel,  and drank of his own cup, and slept in his bosom, and was to  him as a daughter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> And there came a traveller to the rich man, and he spared  to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the  wayfaring man that had come to him; and he took the poor man's  lamb, and dressed it for the man that had come to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and  he said to Nathan, As Jehovah liveth, the man that hath done  this thing is worthy of death;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this  thing, and because he had no pity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man! Thus saith  Jehovah the God of Israel: I anointed thee king over Israel,  and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> and I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives  into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah;  and if [that] had been too little, I would moreover have given  unto thee such and such things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah to do evil  in his sight? thou hast smitten Urijah the Hittite with the  sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain  him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house;  because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of  Urijah the Hittite to be thy wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up evil against  thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before  thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie  with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> For thou didst [it] secretly; but I will do this thing  before all Israel and before the sun.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah.  And Nathan said to David, Jehovah has also put away thy sin:  thou shalt not die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great  occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, even the child  that is born to thee shall certainly die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> And Nathan departed to his house. And Jehovah smote the  child that Urijah's wife bore to David, and it became very  sick.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> And David besought God for the child; and David fasted,  and went in, and lay all night on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> And the elders of his house arose, [and went] to him, to  raise him up from the earth; but he would not, and he ate no  bread with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:18">12:18</a> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child  died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the  child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet  alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice;  and how shall we say to him, The child is dead? he may do some  harm.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:19">12:19</a> But David saw that his servants whispered, and David  perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his  servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:20">12:20</a> Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed  himself, and changed his clothing, and entered into the house  of Jehovah and worshipped; then he came to his own house and  required them to set bread before him, and he ate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:21">12:21</a> And his servants said to him, What thing is this which  thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child alive;  but as soon as the child is dead, thou dost rise and eat bread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:22">12:22</a> And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and  wept; for I thought, Who knows? [perhaps] Jehovah will be  gracious to me, that the child may live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:23">12:23</a> But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him  back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:24">12:24</a> And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her  and lay with her; and she bore a son, and he called his name  Solomon; and Jehovah loved him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:25">12:25</a> And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he  called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah's sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:26">12:26</a> And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon,  and took the royal city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:27">12:27</a> And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought  against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:28">12:28</a> And now gather the rest of the people, and encamp against  the city and take it: lest I take the city and it be called by  my name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:29">12:29</a> And David gathered all the people, and went to Rabbah, and  fought against it and took it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:30">12:30</a> And he took the crown of their king from off his head, the  weight of which was a talent of gold with [the] precious  stones; and it was [set] on David's head; and he brought forth  the spoil of the city in great abundance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:31">12:31</a> And he brought out the people that were in it, and put  them under the saw, and under harrows of iron, and under axes  of iron, and made them pass through the brickkilns. And so did  he to all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and  all the people returned to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of  David having a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar, Amnon  the son of David loved her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister  Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed difficult for Amnon  to do the least thing to her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> And Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of  Shimeah David's brother; and Jonadab was a very shrewd man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> And he said to him, Why dost thou, the king's son, get  thinner from morning to morning? Wilt thou not tell me? And  Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> And Jonadab said to him, Lay thee down on thy bed and feign  thyself sick; and when thy father comes to see thee, say to  him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food,  and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it  from her hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> So Amnon lay down and feigned himself sick; and the king  came to see him, and Amnon said to the king, I pray thee, let  Tamar my sister come, and make a couple of cakes in my sight,  that I may eat from her hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> And David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go, I pray thee, to  thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> And Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he had  lain down. And she took flour and kneaded it, and made cakes in  his sight, and baked the cakes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but  he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Put every man out from me.  And they went out every man from him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the dish into the chamber,  that I may eat of thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes that she  had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her  brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> And she presented them to him to eat; and he took hold of  her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> And she said to him, No, my brother, do not humble me; for  no such thing is done in Israel: do not this infamy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> And I, whither shall I carry my reproach? and thou  wouldest be as one of the infamous in Israel. And now, I pray  thee, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> But he would not hearken to her voice, and was stronger  than she, and humbled her and lay with her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> And Amnon hated her with an exceeding great hatred, for  the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love  with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be  gone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> And she said to him, There is no cause for this evil in  sending me away, [which] is greater than the other that thou  didst to me. But he would not hearken to her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> Then he called his young man that attended upon him, and  said, Put now this [woman] out from me, and bolt the door after  her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> Now she had a vest of many colours upon her; for so were  the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. And his  attendant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her vest of many  colours which was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and  went away, crying out as she went.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon thy brother  been with thee? and now, my sister, be still: he is thy  brother; take not this thing to heart. And Tamar remained, and  [that] desolate, in her brother Absalom's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> And king David heard of all these things, and he was very  angry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> And Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for  Absalom hated Amnon, because he had humbled his sister Tamar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had  sheepshearers in Baal-Hazor, which is beside Ephraim; and  Absalom invited all the king's sons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:24">13:24</a> And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold, now, thy  servant has sheepshearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his  servants go with thy servant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:25">13:25</a> And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all  go, lest we be burdensome to thee. And he urged him, but he  would not go; and he blessed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:26">13:26</a> And Absalom said, If not, I pray thee, let my brother  Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go  with thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:27">13:27</a> But Absalom pressed him; and he let Amnon and all the  king's sons go with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:28">13:28</a> And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now  when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you,  Smite Amnon; then slay him, fear not: have not I commanded you?  be courageous, and be valiant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:29">13:29</a> And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had  commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and they rode each  upon his mule and fled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:30">13:30</a> And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that  tidings came to David, saying, Absalom has smitten all the  king's sons, and there is not one of them left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:31">13:31</a> Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the  earth; and all his servants stood by with their garments rent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:32">13:32</a> And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered  and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the  young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the  appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day  that he humbled his sister Tamar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:33">13:33</a> And now let not my lord the king take the thing to heart,  to say, All the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:34">13:34</a> And Absalom fled. And the young man that watched lifted up  his eyes and looked, and behold, there came much people from  the way behind him, from the hill-side.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:35">13:35</a> And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons  come: as thy servant said, so it is.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:36">13:36</a> And as soon as he had ended speaking, behold, the king's  sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept; and the king  also and all his servants wept very bitterly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:37">13:37</a> And Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud,  king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:38">13:38</a> Now Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three  years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:39">13:39</a> And king David longed to go forth to Absalom; for he was  comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart  was toward Absalom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman,  and said to her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner,  and put on mourning garments, I pray, and anoint not thyself  with oil, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for  the dead;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> and come to the king, and speak after this manner to him.  And Joab put the words into her mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> And the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king, and she fell on  her face to the ground and did obeisance, and said, Save, O  king!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> And the king said to her, What aileth thee? And she said, I  am indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> And thy bondmaid had two sons, and they two strove together  in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one  smote the other and slew him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> And behold, the whole family is risen against thy bondmaid,  and they say, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may  put him to death, for the life of his brother whom he killed;  and we will destroy the heir also: so they will quench my coal  which is left, and will not leave to my husband a name or  remnant on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> And the king said to the woman, Go to thy house, and I will  give charge concerning thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> And the woman of Tekoah said to the king, Upon me, my lord,  O king, be the iniquity, and upon my father's house; and the  king and his throne be guiltless.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> And the king said, Whoever speaks to thee, bring him to  me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> Then she said, I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah  thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood  to destroy any more, lest they cut off my son. And he said,  [As] Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall  to the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> And the woman said, Let thy bondmaid, I pray thee, speak a  word to my lord the king. And he said, Speak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And the woman said, Why then hast thou thought such a  thing against God's people? and the king in saying this thing,  is as one guilty, in that the king does not bring back his  banished one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the  ground, which cannot be gathered up again; and God has not  taken away his life, but devises means that the banished one be  not expelled from him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> And now that I am come to speak of this thing to my lord  the king, it is because the people have made me afraid; and thy  bondmaid said, I will now speak to the king; perhaps the king  will perform the request of his handmaid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the  hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out  of the inheritance of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> And thy bondmaid said, Let the word of my lord the king  now be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the  king to discern good and bad; and Jehovah thy God will be with  thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> And the king answered and said to the woman, Hide not from  me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman  said, Let my lord the king now speak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all  this? And the woman answered and said, [As] thy soul liveth, my  lord, O king, there is no turning to the right hand or to the  left from aught that my lord the king has spoken; for thy  servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words into the  mouth of thy bondmaid:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> in order to turn the appearance of the thing has thy  servant Joab done this thing; but my lord is wise, according to  the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all that is in the  earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this  thing: so go, bring back the young man Absalom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:22">14:22</a> And Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself,  and blessed the king; and Joab said, To-day thy servant knows  that I have found favour in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that  the king has fulfilled the request of his servant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:23">14:23</a> And Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:24">14:24</a> And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let  him not see my face. And Absalom withdrew to his own house, and  saw not the king's face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:25">14:25</a> But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as  Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the  crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:26">14:26</a> And when he shaved his head (for it was at every year's  end that he shaved it, because it was heavy on him, therefore  he shaved it), he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred  shekels after the king's weight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:27">14:27</a> And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one  daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a beautiful  countenance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:28">14:28</a> So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and did not  see the king's face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:29">14:29</a> Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but  he would not come to him; and he sent again the second time,  but he would not come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:30">14:30</a> Then he said to his servants, See, Joab's allotment is  near mine and he has barley there: go and set it on fire. And  Absalom's servants set the allotment on fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:31">14:31</a> Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to [his] house, and  said to him, Why have thy servants set my allotment on fire?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:32">14:32</a> And Absalom said to Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying,  Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Why am I  come from Geshur? it would have been better for me to be there  still. And now let me see the king's face; and if there be  iniquity in me, let him slay me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:33">14:33</a> And Joab came to the king, and told him. And he called  Absalom, and he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face  to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared for  himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> And Absalom rose early, and stood beside the way of the  gate; and it was so, that when any man who had a controversy  had to come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called him,  and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of  one of the tribes of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> And Absalom said to him, See, thy matters are good and  right; but there is no man to hear thee [appointed] by the  king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> And Absalom said, Oh that I were made judge in the land,  that every man who has any controversy and cause might come to  me, and I would do him justice!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> And it was so, that when any man came near to do him  obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> And in this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to  the king for judgment; and Absalom stole the hearts of the men  of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom  said to the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay in Hebron my  vow which I have vowed to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode in Geshur in  Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall bring me again indeed to  Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:9">15:9</a> And the king said to him, Go in peace. And he rose up and  went to Hebron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:10">15:10</a> And Absalom sent emissaries into all the tribes of Israel,  saying, When ye hear the sound of the trumpet, ye shall say,  Absalom reigns in Hebron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:11">15:11</a> And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem,  that were invited; and they went in their simplicity, and they  knew nothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:12">15:12</a> And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's  counsellor, from his city, from Giloh, while he offered the  sacrifices. And the conspiracy gathered strength; and the  people increased continually with Absalom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:13">15:13</a> And there came one to David who reported saying, The  hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:14">15:14</a> And David said to all his servants that were with him at  Jerusalem, Rise up and let us flee; for we shall not [else]  escape from Absalom. Be quick to depart, lest he overtake us  quickly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the  edge of the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:15">15:15</a> And the king's servants said to the king, Behold, thy  servants [will do] whatever my lord the king shall choose.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:16">15:16</a> And the king went forth, and all his household after him,  and the king left ten women, concubines, to keep the house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:17">15:17</a> And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and  stayed at the remote house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:18">15:18</a> And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the  Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six  hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed over before  the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:19">15:19</a> And the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why dost thou also  go with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king; for  thou art a foreigner, and besides, thou hast emigrated to the  place where thou [dwellest].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:20">15:20</a> Thou didst come yesterday, and should I this day make thee  go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I can? Return and  take back thy brethren. Mercy and truth be with thee!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:21">15:21</a> And Ittai answered the king and said, [As] Jehovah liveth,  and [as] my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord  the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also  will thy servant be.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:22">15:22</a> And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the  Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones  that were with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:23">15:23</a> And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the  people passed over; the king also himself passed over the  torrent Kidron, and all the people passed over, towards the way  of the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:24">15:24</a> And behold, Zadok also, and all the Levites with him,  bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the  ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had  passed completely out of the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:25">15:25</a> And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into  the city. If I shall find favour in the eyes of Jehovah, he  will bring me again, and shew me it, and its habitation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:26">15:26</a> But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold,  [here am] I, let him do to me as seemeth good to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:27">15:27</a> And the king said to Zadok the priest, Thou art the seer:  return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you,  Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:28">15:28</a> See, I will stop in the plains of the desert, until there  come word from you to inform me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:29">15:29</a> And Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to  Jerusalem; and they abode there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:30">15:30</a> But David went up by the ascent of the Olives, and wept as  he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot; and  all the people that was with him covered every man his head,  and they went up, weeping as they went up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:31">15:31</a> And one told David saying, Ahithophel is among the  conspirators with Absalom. Then said David, Jehovah, I pray  thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:32">15:32</a> And it came to pass, when David had come to the summit,  where he worshipped God, that behold, Hushai the Archite came  to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:33">15:33</a> And David said to him, If thou passest on with me, thou  wilt be a burden to me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:34">15:34</a> but if thou return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will  be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant  hitherto, so now will I be thy servant; then mayest thou for me  defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:35">15:35</a> And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the  priests? and it shall be, [that] whatsoever thing thou shalt  hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and  Abiathar the priests.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:36">15:36</a> Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz  Zadok's [son], and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye  shall send to me everything that ye shall hear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:37">15:37</a> And Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom  came into Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> And when David was a little past the summit, behold, Ziba,  Mephibosheth's servant, met him, with a couple of asses  saddled, and upon them two hundred [loaves] of bread, and a  hundred raisin-cakes, and a hundred cakes of summer fruits, and  a flask of wine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> And the king said to Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And  Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on;  and the bread and summer fruits for the young men to eat; and  the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba  said to the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem; for he said,  To-day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my  father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> And the king said to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that  pertained to Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly bow myself:  may I find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out  from thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose  name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> and cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king  David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his  right hand and on his left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> And thus said Shimei as he cursed: Away, away, thou man of  blood and man of Belial!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> Jehovah has returned upon thee all the blood of the house  of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah has  given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and behold,  thou art [taken] in thine own evil, for thou art a man of  blood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> And Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, Why should  this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray  thee, and take off his head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of  Zeruiah? so let him curse, for Jehovah has said to him, Curse  David! Who shall then say, Why dost thou so?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants,  Behold, my son, who came forth of my bowels, seeks my life: how  much more now a Benjaminite? let him alone and let him curse;  for Jehovah has bidden him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> It may be that Jehovah will look on mine affliction, and  that Jehovah will requite me good for my being cursed this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> And David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went  along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he  went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> And the king, and all the people that were with him, came  weary, and refreshed themselves there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> Now Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came  to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's  friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, Long live  the king! Long live the king!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy  friend? why didst thou not go with thy friend?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> And Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Jehovah, and this  people, and all the men of Israel choose, his will I be, and  with him will I abide.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> And again, whom should I serve? should it not be in the  presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence,  so will I be in thy presence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:20">16:20</a> And Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you  what we shall do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:21">16:21</a> And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to thy father's  concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel  shall hear that thou art become odious with thy father; and the  hands of all that are with thee shall be strong.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:22">16:22</a> So they spread a tent for Absalom upon the roof; and  Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:23">16:23</a> And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in  those days, was as if a man had inquired of the word of God: so  was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with  Absalom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me, I pray, choose out  twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David  to-night;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:2">17:2</a> and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed,  and will make him afraid; and all the people that are with him  shall flee; and I will smite the king only;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> and I will bring back all the people to thee. The man whom  thou seekest is as if all returned: all the people shall be in  peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> And the saying was right in the eyes of Absalom, and in the  eyes of all the elders of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> And Absalom said, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and we  will hear also what he says.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> And Hushai came to Absalom, and Absalom spoke to him  saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner: shall we carry  out his word? If not, speak thou.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has  given this time is not good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> And Hushai said, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that  they are mighty men, and they are of exasperated spirit, as a  bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man  of war, and will not lodge with the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or some such place; and  it will come to pass, when some of them fall at the first,  whoever heareth it will say, There has been slaughter among the  people that follow Absalom,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> and even the valiant man whose heart is as the heart of a  lion shall utterly melt; for all Israel knows that thy father  is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> But I counsel that all Israel be speedily gathered to  thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the  sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own  person.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> And we shall come upon him in some place where he shall be  found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the  ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him there  shall not be left so much as one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> And if he withdraw into a city, then shall all Israel  bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the torrent,  until there be not one small stone found there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of  Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.  And Jehovah had appointed to defeat the good counsel of  Ahithophel, in order that Jehovah might bring evil upon  Absalom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> And Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus  and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of  Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:16">17:16</a> And now send quickly, and tell David saying, Lodge not  this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass  over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that  are with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:17">17:17</a> And Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; and the maid  went and told them; and they went and told king David, for they  might not be seen to come into the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:18">17:18</a> But a lad saw them, and told Absalom. Then they went both  of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man at  Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:19">17:19</a> And the woman took and spread the covering over the well's  mouth, and spread ground corn on it; and the thing was not  known.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:20">17:20</a> And Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, and  said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to  them, They have gone over the brook of water. And they sought  and could not find [them], and returned to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:21">17:21</a> And it came to pass after they had departed, that they  came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they  said to David, Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus  has Ahithophel counselled against you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:22">17:22</a> Then David arose, and all the people that were with him,  and they passed over the Jordan; by the morning light there was  not one of them missing that had not gone over the Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:23">17:23</a> And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed,  he saddled his ass, and arose and went to his house, to his  city, and gave charge to his household, and hanged himself, and  he died; and he was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:24">17:24</a> And David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the  Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:25">17:25</a> And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab; which  Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Jithra the Israelite,  that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to  Zeruiah, Joab's mother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:26">17:26</a> And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:27">17:27</a> And as soon as David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of  Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son  of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:28">17:28</a> brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat,  and barley, and flour, and parched [corn], and beans, and  lentils, and parched [pulse],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:29">17:29</a> and honey, and cream, and sheep, and cheese of kine to  David, and to the people that were with him, to eat; for they  said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty in the  wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> And David marshalled the people that were with him, and set  captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> And David sent forth the people, a third part under the  hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the  son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand  of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I will  surely go forth with you myself also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth, for if we  should in any case flee, they will not care for us; neither if  half of us die, will they care for us; for *thou* art worth ten  thousand of us; and now it is better that thou succour us out  of the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> And the king said to them, I will do what is good in your  sight. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people  came out by hundreds and by thousands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,  [Deal] gently for my sake with the young man Absalom. And all  the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge  concerning Absalom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> And the people went out into the field against Israel; and  the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> And the people of Israel were routed before the servants of  David, and there was a great slaughter there that day: twenty  thousand men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> And the battle was there scattered over the face of all the  country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the  sword devoured.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And Absalom found himself in the presence of David's  servants. And Absalom was riding upon a mule, and the mule went  under the thick boughs of the great terebinth, and his head  caught in the terebinth, and he was taken up between the heaven  and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> And a man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw  Absalom hanging in a terebinth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> And Joab said to the man that told him, And behold, thou  sawest [him], and why didst thou not smite him there to the  ground? and I would have given thee ten silver pieces and a  girdle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a  thousand silver pieces in my hand, yet would I not put forth my  hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king  charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take care, whoever  it be [of you], of the young man Absalom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> Or I should have acted falsely against mine own life, for  there is no matter concealed from the king, and thou wouldest  have set thyself against [me].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he  took three spears in his hand, and thrust them into Absalom's  body, while he was yet alive in the midst of the terebinth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> And ten young men that bore Joab's armour surrounded and  smote Absalom, and killed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from  pursuing after Israel; for Joab kept back the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in  the wood, and raised a very great heap of stones upon him. And  all Israel fled every one to his tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for  himself a monument, which is in the king's dale; for he said, I  have no son to keep my name in remembrance; and he called the  monument after his own name; and it is called unto this day,  Absalom's memorial.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, Let me run, I pray, and  carry the king the news that Jehovah has avenged him of his  enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> And Joab said to him, Thou shalt not be a bearer of news  to-day, but thou shalt carry the news another day; but to-day  thou shalt carry no news, because the king's son is dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what thou  hast seen. And the Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, Come  what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And  Joab said, Why wilt thou run, my son, seeing that there is no  news suited [to thee]?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> -- But, come what may, let me run. And he said to him,  Run. And Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outstripped  the Cushite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:24">18:24</a> And David sat between the two gates; and the watchman went  up to the roof of the gate, on to the wall, and lifted up his  eyes and looked, and behold, a man running alone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:25">18:25</a> And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king  said, If he be alone, there is news in his mouth. And he came  on and drew near.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:26">18:26</a> And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman  called to the porter and said, Behold a man running alone. And  the king said, He also is a bearer of news.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:27">18:27</a> And the watchman said, I see the running of the foremost  like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king  said, He is a good man; and comes with good news.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:28">18:28</a> And Ahimaaz called and said to the king, Peace! And he  fell down to the earth on his face before the king, and said,  Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who has delivered up the men that  lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:29">18:29</a> And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom?  And Ahimaaz said, I saw a great tumult when Joab sent the  king's servant, and me thy servant; but I knew not what it was.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:30">18:30</a> And the king said, Turn aside [and] stand here. And he  turned aside and stood still.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:31">18:31</a> And behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, Let my  lord the king receive good tidings, for Jehovah has avenged  thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:32">18:32</a> And the king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the  young man Absalom? And the Cushite said, The enemies of my lord  the king, and all that rise against thee for evil, be as that  young man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:33">18:33</a> And the king was much moved, and went up to the upper  chamber of the gate, and wept; and as he went, he said thus: O  my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died in  thy stead, O Absalom, my son, my son!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for  Absalom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> And the victory that day was [turned] into mourning for all  the people; for the people heard say that day, The king is  grieved for his son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> And the people stole away that day into the city, as people  steal away when ashamed of fleeing in battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a  loud voice, My son Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou  hast put to shame this day the faces of all thy servants who  have this day saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of  thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy  concubines;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest those  that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that neither  princes nor servants are anything to thee: for to-day I  perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died  to-day, then it would have been right in thine eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> But now arise, go forth, and speak consolingly to thy  servants; for I swear by Jehovah, if thou go not forth, there  will not tarry one with thee this night; and that would be  worse to thee than all the evil that has befallen thee from thy  youth until now.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told all  the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.  And all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled  every man to his tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> And all the people were at strife throughout the tribes of  Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our  enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines;  and now he is fled out of the land because of Absalom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle;  and now why are ye silent as to bringing the king back?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,  saying, Speak to the elders of Judah saying, Why are ye the  last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of  all Israel is come to the king, to his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh; and why  will ye be the last to bring back the king?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> And say to Amasa, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? God  do so to me and more also, if thou be not captain of the host  before me continually instead of Joab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah as of one  man; and they sent to the king, Return, thou and all thy  servants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> And the king returned and came as far as the Jordan. And  Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the  king over the Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:16">19:16</a> And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, who was of  Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet  king David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:17">19:17</a> And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and  Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and  his twenty servants with him; and they forded the Jordan before  the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:18">19:18</a> And a ferry boat passed to and fro to carry over the  king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei  the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was [just]  crossing over the Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:19">19:19</a> And he said to the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity  to me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did  perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem,  that the king should take it to heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:20">19:20</a> For thy servant knows that I have sinned; and behold, I am  come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down  to meet my lord the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:21">19:21</a> And Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Should  not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed  Jehovah's anointed?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:22">19:22</a> And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of  Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries to me? Should  there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I  know that I am this day king over Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:23">19:23</a> And the king said to Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the  king swore to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:24">19:24</a> And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the  king. Now he had neither washed his feet, nor trimmed his  beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed  until the day he came [again] in peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:25">19:25</a> And as soon as Jerusalem came to meet the king, the king  said to him, Why didst thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:26">19:26</a> And he said, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for  thy servant said, I will saddle me the ass, and ride thereon,  and go with the king; for thy servant is lame.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:27">19:27</a> And he has slandered thy servant to my lord the king; but  my lord the king is as an angel of God; do therefore what is  good in thy sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:28">19:28</a> For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord  the king; and thou didst set thy servant among them that eat at  thine own table. What further right therefore have I? and for  what should I cry any more to the king?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:29">19:29</a> And the king said to him, Why speakest thou any more of  thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:30">19:30</a> And Mephibosheth said to the king, Let him even take all,  since my lord the king is come again in peace to his own house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:31">19:31</a> And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and  went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the  Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:32">19:32</a> And Barzillai was very aged, eighty years old; and it was  he that had maintained the king while he abode at Mahanaim; for  he was a very great man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:33">19:33</a> And the king said to Barzillai, Pass thou over with me,  and I will maintain thee with me in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:34">19:34</a> And Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of  the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to  Jerusalem?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:35">19:35</a> I am this day eighty years old: can I discern between good  and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat and what I drink? can  I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? and  why should thy servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:36">19:36</a> Thy servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the  king; and why should the king recompense it to me with this  reward?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:37">19:37</a> Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may  die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and of my  mother. But behold thy servant Chimham: let him go over with my  lord the king; and do to him what seems good to thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:38">19:38</a> And the king said, Chimham shall go over with me, and I  will do to him that which seems good to thee; and whatsoever  thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:39">19:39</a> And all the people went over the Jordan; and the king went  over; and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he  returned to his own place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:40">19:40</a> And the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with  him; and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also  half the people of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:41">19:41</a> And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and  said to the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen  thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and  all David's men with him, over the Jordan?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:42">19:42</a> And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel,  Because the king is near of kin to me; and why then are ye  angry for this matter? have we eaten anything which came from  the king, or has he given us any present?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:43">19:43</a> And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said,  I have ten parts in the king and I have also more right in  David than thou; and why didst thou slight me? and was not my  advice the first, to bring back my king? And the words of the  men of Judah were harsher than the words of the men of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name  was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite; and he blew a  trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we  inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents,  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> Then all the men of Israel went up from after David,  following Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah clave  to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took  the ten women, concubines, whom he had left to keep the house,  and put them in a house of confinement and maintained them, but  did not go in to them. So they were shut up unto the day of  their death, living in widowhood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> And the king said to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah  together within three days, and do thou attend here.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> So Amasa went to call together [the men of] Judah; but he  delayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of  Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom. Take thou thy lord's  servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified  cities and escape our sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> And there went out after him Joab's men, and the  Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and  they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of  Bichri.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa  came before them. And Joab was girded with his coat, his dress,  and upon it was the girdle of the sword which was fastened on  his loins in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou well, my brother? And Joab  took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> And Amasa had taken no notice of the sword that was in  Joab's hand: so he smote him with it in the belly and shed out  his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he  died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the  son of Bichri.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> And one of Joab's young men stood by [Amasa] and said, He  that favours Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow  Joab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> Now Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway.  And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he  removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a  cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by stood  still.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> When he was removed out of the highway, all the people  went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> who went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to  Beth-Maacah, and all the Berim; and they gathered together, and  went also after him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a> And they came and besieged him in Abel-Beth-Maacah, and  they cast up a bank against the city, and it was raised in the  trench; and all the people that were with Joab sapped the wall,  to throw it down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a> And a wise woman cried out of the city, Hear, hear: say, I  pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with  thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> And he came near to her; and the woman said, Art thou  Joab? And he said, I [am he]. And she said to him, Listen to  the words of thy handmaid. And he said, I am listening.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> And she spoke saying, They were wont to speak in old time  saying, Just inquire in Abel; and so they ended.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:19">20:19</a> I am peaceable [and] faithful in Israel: thou seekest to  destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why wilt thou swallow up  the inheritance of Jehovah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:20">20:20</a> And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me,  that I should swallow up or destroy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:21">20:21</a> The matter is not so; but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba  the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the  king, against David: give up him only, and I will depart from  the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be  thrown to thee over the wall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:22">20:22</a> Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And  they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it  to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they dispersed from the  city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to  the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:23">20:23</a> And Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the  son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the  Pelethites;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:24">20:24</a> and Adoram was over the levy; and Jehoshaphat the son of  Ahilud was recorder;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:25">20:25</a> and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:26">20:26</a> and Ira also, the Jairite, was David's chief ruler.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> And there was a famine in the days of David three years,  year after year; and David inquired of Jehovah. And Jehovah  said, It is for Saul, and for [his] house of blood, because he  slew the Gibeonites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> And the king called the Gibeonites, and spoke to them. (Now  the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the  remainder of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn  to them; and Saul sought to smite them in his zeal for the  children of Israel and Judah.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> And David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?  and with what shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the  inheritance of Jehovah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> And the Gibeonites said to him, As to Saul and his house,  it is with us no question of receiving silver or gold, neither  is it for us to have any man put to death in Israel. And he  said, What ye say will I do for you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> And they said to the king, The man that consumed us, and  that devised against us that we should be destroyed from  remaining in all the borders of Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> let seven men of his sons be given up to us, and we will  hang them up to Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of  Jehovah. And the king said, I will give [them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the  son of Saul, because of Jehovah's oath that was between them,  between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> And the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of  Aiah, whom she had borne to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and  the five sons of [the sister of] Michal the daughter of Saul,  whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the  Meholathite;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> and he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they  hanged them on the hill before Jehovah. And they fell all seven  together, and were put to death in the first days of the  harvest, in the beginning of barley harvest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> Then Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and  spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest  until water poured on them out of the heavens, and suffered  neither the fowl of the heavens to rest on them by day, nor the  beasts of the field by night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,  the concubine of Saul, had done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of  Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-Gilead, who had stolen  them from the open place of Beth-shan, where the Philistines  had hanged them, the day the Philistines had smitten Saul in  Gilboa;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the  bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them  that were hanged.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> And they buried [them] with the bones of Saul and Jonathan  his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of  Kish his father; and they did all that the king had commanded.  And afterwards God was propitious to the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> And the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and  David went down, and his servants with him, and fought with the  Philistines. And David was exhausted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> And Ishbibenob, who was of the children of Raphah -- the  weight of his lance was three hundred shekels of bronze, and he  was girded with new [armour] -- thought to smite David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> And Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote  the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to  him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that  thou quench not the lamp of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> And it came to pass after this, that there was again a  battle with the Philistines, at Gob; then Sibbechai the  Hushathite smote Saph, who was of the children of Raphah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> And there was again a battle at Gob with the Philistines;  and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, smote  Goliath the Gittite; now the shaft of his spear was like a  weaver's beam.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> And there was again a battle, at Gath; and there was a man  [there] of great stature, that had on each hand six fingers,  and on each foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he  also was born to Raphah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:21">21:21</a> And he defied Israel; but Jonathan the son of Shimea  David's brother smote him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:22">21:22</a> These four were born to Raphah, in Gath; and they fell by  the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> And David spoke to Jehovah the words of this song in the  day that Jehovah had delivered him out of the hand of all his  enemies, and out of the hand of Saul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> And he said, Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my  deliverer;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> God is my rock, in him will I trust -- My shield, and the  horn of my salvation, My high tower, and my refuge, My saviour:  thou wilt save me from violence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> I will call upon Jehovah, who is to be praised; So shall I  be saved from mine enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> For the waves of death encompassed me, Torrents of Belial  made me afraid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> The bands of Sheol surrounded me; The cords of death  encountered me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> In my distress I called upon Jehovah, And I cried to my  God; And he heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry [came]  into his ears.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> Then the earth shook, and quaked; The foundations of the  heavens trembled And shook because he was wroth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of  his mouth devoured: Coals burned forth from it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> And he bowed the heavens, and came down; And darkness was  under his feet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; And he was seen  upon the wings of the wind.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> And he made darkness round about him a tent, Gatherings of  waters, thick clouds of the skies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> From the brightness before him Burned forth coals of fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> Jehovah thundered from the heavens, And the Most High  uttered his voice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> And he sent arrows, and scattered [mine enemies];  Lightning, and discomfited them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> And the beds of the sea were seen, The foundations of the  world were uncovered At the rebuke of Jehovah, At the blast of  the breath of his nostrils.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> He reached forth from above, he took me, He drew me out of  great waters;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> He delivered me from my strong enemy, From them that hated  me; For they were mightier than I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> They encountered me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah  was my stay.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> And he brought me forth into a large place; He delivered  me, because he delighted in me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:21">22:21</a> Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness,  According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly  departed from my God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:23">22:23</a> For all his ordinances were before me, And his statutes, I  did not depart from them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:24">22:24</a> And I was upright before him, And kept myself from mine  iniquity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:25">22:25</a> And Jehovah hath recompensed me according to my  righteousness, According to my cleanness in his sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:26">22:26</a> With the gracious thou dost shew thyself gracious; With  the upright man thou dost shew thyself upright;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:27">22:27</a> With the pure thou dost shew thyself pure; And with the  perverse thou dost shew thyself contrary.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:28">22:28</a> And the afflicted people thou dost save; And thine eyes  are upon the haughty, [whom] thou bringest down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:29">22:29</a> For thou art my lamp, Jehovah; And Jehovah enlighteneth my  darkness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:30">22:30</a> For by thee I have run through a troop; By my God have I  leaped over a wall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:31">22:31</a> As for ùGod, his way is perfect; The word of Jehovah is  tried: He is a shield to all that trust in him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:32">22:32</a> For who is ùGod, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, save our  God?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:33">22:33</a> ùGod is my strong fortress, And he maketh my way perfectly  smooth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:34">22:34</a> He maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], And setteth me upon  my high places.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:35">22:35</a> He teacheth my hands to war, And mine arms bend a bow of  brass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:36">22:36</a> And thou didst give me the shield of thy salvation, And  thy condescending gentleness hath made me great.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:37">22:37</a> Thou enlargedst my steps under me; And mine ankles did not  slip.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:38">22:38</a> I pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them, And I turned  not again till they were consumed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:39">22:39</a> And I have consumed them and have crushed them, and they  rose not again; Yea, they fell under my feet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:40">22:40</a> And thou girdedst me with strength to battle: Thou didst  subdue under me those that rose up against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:41">22:41</a> And mine enemies didst thou make to turn their backs unto  me, And those that hated me I destroyed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:42">22:42</a> They looked, and there was none to save -- Unto Jehovah,  and he answered them not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:43">22:43</a> And I did beat them small as the dust of the earth, I trod  them as the mire of the streets; I stamped upon them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:44">22:44</a> And thou hast delivered me from the strivings of my  people, Thou hast kept me to be head of the nations: A people I  knew not doth serve me:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:45">22:45</a> Strangers come cringing unto me: At the hearing of the  ear, they obey me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:46">22:46</a> Strangers have faded away, And they come trembling forth  from their close places.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:47">22:47</a> Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the  God, the rock of my salvation,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:48">22:48</a> The ùGod who hath avenged me, And hath brought the peoples  under me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:49">22:49</a> He brought me forth from mine enemies: Yea, thou hast  lifted me up above them that rose up against me; From the man  of violence hast thou delivered me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:50">22:50</a> Therefore will I give thanks to thee, Jehovah, among the  nations, And will sing psalms to thy name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:51">22:51</a> [It is he] who giveth great deliverances to his king, And  sheweth loving-kindness to his anointed, To David, and to his  seed for evermore.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> Now these are the last words of David: David the son of  Jesse saith, And the man who was raised up on high, The  anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet psalmist of Israel  saith,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:2">23:2</a> The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by me, And his word was on my  tongue.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me, The  ruler among men shall be just, Ruling in the fear of God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> And [he shall be] as the light or the morning, [like] the  rising of the sun, A morning without clouds; [When] from the  sunshine, after rain, The green grass springeth from the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> Although my house be not so before ùGod, Yet he hath made  with me an everlasting covenant, Ordered in every way and sure;  For [this is] all my salvation, and every desire, Although he  make [it] not to grow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> But [the sons] of Belial [are] all of them as thorns thrust  away, Because they cannot be taken with hands;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> And the man that will touch them provideth himself with  iron and the staff of a spear; And they shall be utterly burned  with fire in [their] place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> These are the names of the mighty men whom David had:  Joseb-Bassebeth, Tachkemonite the chief of the captains: he was  Adino the Eznite; he [fought] against eight hundred, slain [by  him] at one time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:9">23:9</a> And after him, Eleazar the son of Dodo the son of an  Ahohite: he was one of the three mighty men with David, when  they had defied the Philistines that were there gathered  together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> He arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was  weary, and his hand clave to the sword; and Jehovah wrought a  great deliverance that day; and the people returned after him  only to spoil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> And after him, Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite: the  Philistines were gathered into a troop, and there was there a  plot of ground full of lentils, and the people had fled before  the Philistines;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> and he stood in the midst of the plot and delivered it,  and smote the Philistines, and Jehovah wrought a great  deliverance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:13">23:13</a> And three of the thirty chiefs went down, and came to  David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam, when the  troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> And David was then in the stronghold; and the Philistines'  garrison was then at Bethlehem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me to  drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the  gate!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:16">23:16</a> And the three mighty men broke through the camp of the  Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, which  is in the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; however  he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:17">23:17</a> And he said, Be it far from me, Jehovah, that I should do  this thing! is it not the blood of the men that went at the  risk of their lives? Therefore he would not drink it. These  things did the three mighty men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:18">23:18</a> And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was  the chief of three; and he brandished his spear against three  hundred and slew them; and he had a name among the three.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:19">23:19</a> Was he not most honourable of three? and he was their  captain; but he did not attain to the [first] three.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:20">23:20</a> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, son of a valiant man,  great in exploits, of Kabzeel: he it was that smote two lions  of Moab; and he went down and smote a lion in the midst of a  pit on a snowy day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:21">23:21</a> He also smote the Egyptian, an imposing man: and the  Egyptian had a spear in his hand; and he went down to him with  a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and  slew him with his own spear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:22">23:22</a> These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he had a  name among the three mighty men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:23">23:23</a> He was honoured above the thirty, but he did not attain to  the [first] three. And David set him in his council.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:24">23:24</a> Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan  the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:25">23:25</a> Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:26">23:26</a> Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:27">23:27</a> Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:28">23:28</a> Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:29">23:29</a> Heleb the son of Baanah, the Netophathite, Ittai the son  of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:30">23:30</a> Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:31">23:31</a> Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:32">23:32</a> Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:33">23:33</a> Shammah the Ararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:34">23:34</a> Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite,  Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:35">23:35</a> Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:36">23:36</a> Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:37">23:37</a> Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the  armour-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:38">23:38</a> Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:39">23:39</a> Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> And again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel,  and he moved David against them saying, Go, number Israel and  Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> And the king said to Joab the captain of the host, who was  with him, Go, I pray thee, through all the tribes of Israel,  from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and count the people, that I may  know the number of the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> And Joab said to the king, May Jehovah thy God even add to  the people, how many soever they be, a hundredfold, and that  the eyes of my lord the king may see [it]; but why does my lord  the king delight in this thing?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> But the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the  captains of the army. And Joab and the captains of the army  went out from the presence of the king to count the people of  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on  the right side of the city that is in the midst of the ravine  of Gad, and toward Jaazer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> And they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi;  and came to Dan-jaan, and to the environs of Sidon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> and they came to the fortified city of Tyre, and to all the  cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites; and went out to  the south of Judah, to Beer-sheba.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:8">24:8</a> And they went through all the land, and came to Jerusalem  at the end of nine months and twenty days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:9">24:9</a> And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the  king; and there were of Israel eight hundred thousand valiant  men that drew sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred  thousand men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> And David's heart smote him after he had numbered the  people. And David said to Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in  what I have done; and now, I beseech thee, Jehovah, put away  the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:11">24:11</a> And when David arose in the morning, the word of Jehovah  came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:12">24:12</a> Go and say to David, Thus saith Jehovah: I impose on thee  three [things]; choose one of them that I may do it unto thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:13">24:13</a> And Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him,  Shall seven years of famine come to thee in thy land? or wilt  thou flee three months before thine adversaries while they  pursue thee? or shall there be three days' pestilence in thy  land? Now be aware and consider what word I shall bring again  to him that sent me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:14">24:14</a> And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us  fall, I pray thee, into the hand of Jehovah; for his mercies  are great; but let me not fall into the hand of man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:15">24:15</a> And Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning  even to the set time; and there died of the people from Dan  even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:16">24:16</a> And the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to  destroy it; but Jehovah repented him of the evil, and said to  the angel that destroyed among the people, It is enough:  withdraw now thine hand. And the angel of Jehovah was by the  threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:17">24:17</a> And David spoke to Jehovah when he saw the angel that  smote among the people, and said, Behold, it is I that have  sinned, and it is I that have committed iniquity; but these  sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be on  me, and on my father's house!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:18">24:18</a> And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up,  rear an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the  Jebusite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:19">24:19</a> And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as  Jehovah had commanded.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:20">24:20</a> And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants  coming on towards him; and Araunah went out, and bowed himself  before the king with his face to the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:21">24:21</a> And Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his  servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to  build an altar to Jehovah, that the plague may be stayed from  the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:22">24:22</a> And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and  offer up that which is good in his sight: see, [here are] oxen  for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-sledges and  implements of the oxen for wood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:23">24:23</a> All these things, O king, doth Araunah give to the king.  And Araunah said to the king, Jehovah thy God accept thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:24">24:24</a> And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will in any case  buy [them] of thee at a price: neither will I offer up to  Jehovah my God burnt-offerings without cost. And David bought  the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:25">24:25</a> And David built there an altar to Jehovah, and offered up  burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. And Jehovah was propitious  to the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</p>
