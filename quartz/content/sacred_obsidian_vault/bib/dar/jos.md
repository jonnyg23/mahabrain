  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Joshua</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of  Jehovah, that Jehovah spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses'  attendant, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Moses my servant is dead; and now, rise up, go over this  Jordan, thou and all this people, into the land which I give  unto them, to the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread have I  given to you, as I said unto Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> From the wilderness and this Lebanon to the great river, the  river Euphrates, the whole land of the Hittites, to the great  sea, toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> None shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy  life: as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee; I will not  leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> Be strong and courageous, for thou shalt cause this people  to inherit the land which I have sworn unto their fathers to  give them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Only be strong and very courageous, that thou mayest take  heed to do according to all the law that Moses my servant  commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right or to the left,  that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> This book of the law shall not depart from thy mouth; and  thou shalt meditate upon it day and night, that thou mayest  take heed to do according to all that is written therein; for  then shalt thou have good success in thy ways, and then shalt  thou prosper.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Have I not commanded thee: Be strong and courageous? Be not  afraid, neither be dismayed; for Jehovah thy God is with thee  whithersoever thou goest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Go through the midst of the camp, and command the people,  saying, Prepare yourselves victuals, for in three days ye shall  pass over this Jordan, that ye may enter in to take possession  of the land which Jehovah your God giveth you to possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to half the  tribe of Manasseh spoke Joshua, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Remember the word that Moses the servant of Jehovah  commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God has given you rest and  has given you this land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall abide  in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan, but  ye, all the valiant men, shall go over in array before your  brethren and help them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> until Jehovah give your brethren rest as to you, and they  also take possession of the land which Jehovah your God giveth  them; then shall ye return into the land of your possession and  possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you on this  side of the Jordan toward the sun-rising.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast  commanded us will we do, and whither thou shalt send us will we  go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> According as we hearkened to Moses in all things, so will  we hearken to thee; only may Jehovah thy God be with thee as he  was with Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> Every one that is rebellious against thy commandment and  hearkeneth not to thy words in everything that thou commandest  us, shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And Joshua the son of Nun sent from Shittim two spies  secretly, saying, Go, see the land, even Jericho. And they  went, and came into a harlot's house, named Rahab, and they lay  down there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men  have come hither to-night from the children of Israel to search  out the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth  the men that have come to thee, who have come into thy house:  for they have come to search out all the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And the woman had taken and concealed the two men; and she  said, Yes, the men did come unto me, but I knew not whence they  were;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> and it came to pass when the gate had to be closed, at dark,  that the men went out: I know not whither the men have gone.  Pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> But she had taken them up to the roof, and secreted them  under the stalks of flax, which she had laid out on the roof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan, to the  fords; and when they who pursued after them had gone out, they  closed the gate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And before they had lain down, she went up to them upon the  roof;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> and said to the men, I know that Jehovah has given you the  land, and that the dread of you has fallen on us, and that all  the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> For we have heard that Jehovah dried up the waters of the  Red sea before you when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did  to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan,  to Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> We heard [of it], and our heart melted, and there remained  no more spirit in any man because of you; for Jehovah your God,  he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And now, I pray you, swear to me by Jehovah, since I have  dealt kindly with you, that ye will also deal kindly with my  father's house, and give me a certain sign,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> that ye will let my father live, and my mother, and my  brethren, and my sisters, and all that belong to them, and  deliver our souls from death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And the men said to her, Our lives shall pay for yours, if  ye do not make this our business known; and it shall be when  Jehovah shall give us the land, that we will deal kindly and  truly with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And she let them down by a cord through the window; for her  house was upon the city-wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And she said to them, Go to the mountain, that the pursuers  may not meet with you; and hide yourselves there three days,  until the pursuers have returned; and afterwards go your way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And the men said to her, We will be quit of this thine oath  which thou hast made us swear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind in the  window this line of scarlet thread by which thou hast let us  down; and thou shalt gather to thee in the house thy father,  and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's  household;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> and it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of  thy house into the street, -- his blood shall be upon his head,  and we shall be innocent; but every one who shall be with thee  in the house, his blood shall be upon our head, if any hand be  upon him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> And if thou make known this our business, we will be quit  of thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she  sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet  line in the window.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> And they went, and came to the mountain, and remained there  three days, until the pursuers had returned; and the pursuers  sought them all the way, and found them not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> And the two men returned and came down from the mountain,  and went over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and related to  him everything that had happened to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> And they said to Joshua, Of a surety Jehovah has given the  whole land into our hands, and even all the inhabitants of the  land faint because of us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from  Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of  Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And it came to pass at the end of three days, that the  officers went through the camp;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark  of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the  Levites bearing it, then remove from your place, and go after  it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> yet there shall be a distance between you and it, about two  thousand cubits by measure. Ye shall not come near it, that ye  may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed  this way heretofore.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And Joshua said to the people, Hallow yourselves; for  to-morrow Jehovah will do wonders in your midst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of  the covenant, and go over before the people. And they took up  the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify  thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I  was with Moses, so will I be with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And thou shalt command the priests who bear the ark of the  covenant, saying, When ye come to the edge of the waters of the  Jordan, stand still in the Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and  hear the words of Jehovah your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> And Joshua said, Hereby shall ye know that the living ùGod  is in your midst, and [that] he will without fail dispossess  from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the  Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the  Amorites, and the Jebusites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the  earth is going over before you into the Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And now take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,  one man for each tribe.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of  the priests who bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the  earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the  Jordan, the waters flowing down from above, shall be cut off,  and shall stand up in a heap.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And it came to pass when the people removed from their  tents, to pass over the Jordan, that the priests bearing the  ark of the covenant were before the people;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> and when they that bore the ark were come to the Jordan,  and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge  of the water (and the Jordan is full over all its banks  throughout the days of harvest),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> the waters which flowed down from above stood [and] rose up  in a heap, very far, by Adam, the city that is beside Zaretan;  and those that flowed down towards the sea of the plain, the  salt sea, were completely cut off. And the people went over  opposite to Jericho.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah  stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan. And all  Israel went over on dry ground, until all the nation had  completely gone over the Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And it came to pass when the whole nation had completely  gone over the Jordan, that Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> Take you twelve men out of the people, one man out of every  tribe,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> and command them, saying, Take up hence out of the midst of  the Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet stood firm,  twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down  in the lodging-place where ye shall lodge this night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had appointed of  the children of Israel, a man out of every tribe;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> and Joshua said to them, Pass before the ark of Jehovah your  God into the midst of the Jordan, and lift up each of you a  stone [and put it] upon his shoulder, according to the number  of the tribes of the children of Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> that this may be a sign in your midst. When your children  ask hereafter, saying, What mean ye by these stones?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> then ye shall say to them, That the waters of the Jordan  were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it  went through the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.  And these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of  Israel for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And the children of Israel did so, as Joshua had commanded,  and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as  Jehovah had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the  tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over  with them to the lodging-place, and laid them down there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And twelve stones did Joshua set up in the midst of the  Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the  ark of the covenant had stood firm; and they are there to this  day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the  Jordan, until everything was finished that Jehovah had  commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all  that Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hasted and  passed over.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And it came to pass, when all the people had completely  gone over, that the ark of Jehovah went over, and the priests,  in the presence of the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and  the half tribe of Manasseh, went over in array before the  children of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> About forty thousand armed for military service passed over  before Jehovah to the war, unto the plains of Jericho.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all  Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the  days of his life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony, that  they come up out of the Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> And Joshua commanded the priests, saying, Come up out of  the Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And it came to pass when the priests who bore the ark of  the covenant of Jehovah had come up out of the midst of the  Jordan, [when] the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up on  to the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned to  their place, and they flowed as previously, over all its banks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth of  the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the eastern  extremity of Jericho.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> And those twelve stones which they had taken out of the  Jordan did Joshua set up in Gilgal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your  children hereafter ask their fathers, saying, What [mean] these  stones?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> then ye shall let your children know, saying, On dry land  did Israel come over this Jordan;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> because Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan  from before you, until ye had passed over, as Jehovah your God  did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we  had passed over;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> that all peoples of the earth might know the hand of  Jehovah, that it is mighty; that ye might fear Jehovah your God  continually.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And it came to pass when all the kings of the Amorites, who  were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the  Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard that Jehovah had dried  up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel,  until they had passed over, that their heart melted, and there  was no spirit in them any more, because of the children of  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make thee stone-knives,  and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And Joshua made him stone-knives, and circumcised the  children of Israel at the hill of Araloth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And this is the cause why Joshua circumcised [them]: all the  people that had come out of Egypt, the males, all the men of  war, had died in the wilderness on the way, after they came out  of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all  the people that were born in the wilderness on the way, after  they came out of Egypt, [them] had they not circumcised.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> For the children of Israel had walked forty years in the  wilderness, till the whole nation of men of war had perished  who had come out of Egypt, who had not hearkened to the voice  of Jehovah; to whom Jehovah had sworn that he would not show  them the land which Jehovah had sworn unto their fathers that  he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> And their sons [whom] he raised up in their stead, them  Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, because they  had not circumcised them on the way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And it came to pass when the whole nation had finished being  circumcised, that they abode in their place in the camp, till  they were whole.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the  reproach of Egypt from off you. And the name of the place was  called Gilgal to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and held the  passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the  plains of Jericho.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And they ate of the old corn of the land on the morrow  after the passover, unleavened loaves, and roasted [corn] on  that same day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> And the manna ceased on the morrow, when they had eaten of  the old corn of the land; and there was no more manna for the  children of Israel; and they ate of the produce of the land of  Canaan that year.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho, that he  lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there stood a man  before him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to  him, and said to him: Art thou for us, or for our enemies?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> And he said, No; for [as] captain of the army of Jehovah am  I now come. Then Joshua fell upon his face to the earth, and  worshipped, and said to him, What saith my lord unto his  servant?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> And the captain of Jehovah's army said to Joshua, Loose thy  sandal from off thy foot: for the place whereon thou standest  is holy. And Joshua did so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> Now Jericho was shut up and was barred, because of the  children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> And Jehovah said to Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand  Jericho, and the king thereof, [and] the valiant men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And ye shall go round the city, all the men of war,  encompassing the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And seven priests shall carry before the ark seven  blast-trumpets; and on the seventh day ye shall go round the  city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And it shall come to pass when they make a long blast with  the blast-horn, that all the people on hearing the sound of the  trumpet shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the  city shall fall flat, and the people shall go up, each one  straight before him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to  them, Carry the ark of the covenant, and seven priests shall  carry seven blast-trumpets before the ark of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And he said to the people, Pass on, go round the city, and  they that are armed shall pass on before the ark of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And it came to pass when Joshua had spoken to the people,  that the seven priests carrying the seven blast-trumpets before  Jehovah passed on and blew with the trumpets; and the ark of  the covenant of Jehovah went after them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And the armed men went before the priests who blew with the  trumpets, and the rearguard came after the ark; they blew with  the trumpets in marching.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not  shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall a word  proceed out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, Shout;  then shall ye shout.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> And the ark of Jehovah went round the city, encompassing  [it] once; and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests  carried the ark of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> And the seven priests carrying the seven blast-trumpets  before the ark of Jehovah went on and blew continually with the  trumpets; and the armed men went before them, and the rearguard  went after the ark of Jehovah; they blew with the trumpets in  marching.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> And on the second day they went round the city once, and  returned into the camp. So they did six days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> And it was so that on the seventh day they rose early,  about the morning-dawn, and went round the city after the same  manner seven times; only on that day they went round the city  seven times.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> And it came to pass the seventh time, when the priests blew  with the trumpets, that Joshua said to the people, Shout; for  Jehovah has given you the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> And the city shall be accursed, it and all that is in it,  to Jehovah; only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that  are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that  we sent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> But in any wise keep from the accursed thing, lest ye make  [yourselves] accursed in taking of the accursed thing, and make  the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> And all the silver, and gold, and vessels of copper and  iron, shall be holy to Jehovah; they shall come into the  treasury of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> And the people shouted, and they blew with the trumpets.  And it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the  trumpets, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the  wall fell down flat; and the people went up into the city, each  one straight before him, and they took the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city; both  man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with  the edge of the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> And Joshua said to the two men that had spied out the  country, Go into the harlot's house and bring out thence the  woman, and all that she has, as ye swore unto her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> And the young men, the spies, went in and brought out  Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and  all that she had: all her kindred did they bring out, and they  left them outside the camp of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> And they burned the city with fire, and all that was  therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of  copper and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> And Joshua saved alive Rahab the harlot, and her father's  household, and all that she had, and she dwelt in the midst of  Israel to this day; because she hid the messengers whom Joshua  had sent to spy out Jericho.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:26">6:26</a> And Joshua swore at that time, saying, Cursed be the man  before Jehovah who shall rise up and build this city Jericho!  In his first-born shall he lay its foundation, and in his  youngest son shall he set up its gates.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:27">6:27</a> And Jehovah was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the  land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> But the children of Israel committed unfaithfulness in that  which had been brought under the curse: Achan, the son of  Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of  Judah, took of the accursed thing; and the anger of Jehovah was  kindled against the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside  Beth-Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them,  saying, Go up and spy out the country. And the men went up and  spied out Ai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all  the people go up; let about two or three thousand men go up and  smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither, for they are  few.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> And there went up thither of the people about three thousand  men, but they fled before the men of Ai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty-six men; and  they pursued them from before the gate to Shebarim, and smote  them on the descent. Then the hearts of the people melted, and  became as water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his  face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the  elders of Israel, and threw dust upon their heads.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> And Joshua said, Alas, Lord Jehovah, wherefore hast thou at  all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the  hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Oh that we had been  content and had remained beyond the Jordan!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> Ah Lord! what shall I say after Israel have turned their  backs before their enemies?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> When the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land  shall hear [of it], they will surround us, and cut off our name  from the earth. And what wilt thou do unto thy great name?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And Jehovah said to Joshua, Rise up; wherefore liest thou  thus upon thy face?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my  covenant which I commanded them, and they have even taken of  the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also,  and they have put it among their stuff.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> And the children of Israel shall not be able to stand  before their enemies: they shall turn their backs before their  enemies, for they have made themselves accursed. I will no more  be with you, except ye destroy the accursed thing from your  midst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> Rise up, hallow the people, and say, Hallow yourselves for  to-morrow; for thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel, There is  an accursed thing in the midst of thee, Israel: thou shalt not  be able to stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the  accursed thing from your midst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> And ye shall be brought near in the morning according to  your tribes; and it shall be, that the tribe which Jehovah  taketh shall come forward by families, and the family which  Jehovah taketh shall come forward by households; and the  household which Jehovah taketh shall come forward man by man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> And it shall be, that he who is taken with the accursed  thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he hath,  because he hath transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and  because he hath wrought wickedness in Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> And Joshua rose early in the morning, and caused Israel to  come forward by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> And he caused the families of Judah to come forward, and he  took the family of the Zarhites. And he caused the family of  the Zarhites to come forward man by man, and Zabdi was taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> And he caused his household to come forward man by man, and  Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of  the tribe of Judah, was taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory  to Jehovah the God of Israel, and make confession to him: tell  me now what thou hast done, keep it not back from me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> And Achan answered Joshua and said, Indeed I have sinned  against Jehovah the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I  done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> I saw among the spoils a beautiful mantle of Shinar, and  two hundred shekels of silver, and a golden bar of fifty  shekels weight, and I coveted them and took them; and behold,  they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the  silver under it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> And Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and  behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and  brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel, and  laid them out before Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of  Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the bar of gold, and  his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and  his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had; and they brought  them up into the valley of Achor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> And Joshua said, How hast thou troubled us! Jehovah will  trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones;  and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:26">7:26</a> And they raised over him a great heap of stones, [which is  there] to this day. And Jehovah turned from the fierceness of  his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called, The  Valley of Achor, to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And Jehovah said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be dismayed.  Take with thee all the people of war, and arise, go up to Ai.  See, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people,  and his city, and his land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And thou shalt do to Ai and to its king as thou didst to  Jericho and to its king; only, the spoil thereof and the cattle  thereof shall ye take as prey for yourselves. Set an ambush  against the city behind it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai.  And Joshua chose thirty thousand valiant men, and sent them  away by night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> And he commanded them, saying, See, ye shall be in ambush  against the city, behind the city: go not very far from the  city, and be all of you ready.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And I and all the people that are with me will approach to  the city; and it shall come to pass when they come out against  us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> And they will come out after us till we have drawn them from  the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the  first; and we will flee before them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> And ye shall rise up from the ambush and take possession of  the city; and Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> And it shall be when ye have taken the city, that ye shall  set the city on fire; according to the word of Jehovah shall ye  do. See, I have commanded you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to lie in ambush,  and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west of Ai. And Joshua  lodged that night among the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> And Joshua rose early in the morning, and inspected the  people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the  people to Ai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> And all the people of war that were with him went up, and  drew near, and came before the city; and they encamped on the  north of Ai; and the valley was between them and Ai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> Now he had taken about five thousand men, and set them in  ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west of the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And when they had set the people, the whole camp on the  north of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city,  Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And it came to pass when the king of Ai saw it, that the  men of the city hasted and rose early, and went out against  Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the appointed place  before the plain. But he knew not that there was an ambush  against him behind the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And Joshua and all Israel let themselves be beaten before  them; and they fled by the way of the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> And all the people that were in the city were called  together to pursue after them; and they pursued after Joshua,  and were drawn away from the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> And not a man remained in Ai and Bethel that went not out  after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> And Jehovah said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is  in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And  Joshua stretched out the javelin that he had in his hand toward  the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> And the ambush arose quickly from their place, and they ran  when he stretched out his hand, and came into the city, and  took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> And the men of Ai turned and saw, and behold, the smoke of  the city went up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this  way or that way; and the people that fled to the wilderness  turned upon the pursuers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken  the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, they turned  again, and slew the men of Ai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> And the others went out of the city against them; so they  were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on  that side; and they smote them, until they let none of them  escape or flee away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:23">8:23</a> And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to  Joshua.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:24">8:24</a> And it came to pass when Israel had ended slaying all the  inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they  had chased them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the  sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to  Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:25">8:25</a> And so it was, that all who fell that day, men as well as  women, were twelve thousand, all the people of Ai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:26">8:26</a> And Joshua did not draw back his hand, which he had  stretched out with the javelin, until they had utterly  destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:27">8:27</a> Only, the cattle and the spoil of the city Israel took as  prey to themselves, according to the word of Jehovah which he  had commanded Joshua.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:28">8:28</a> And Joshua burned Ai, and made it an everlasting heap of  desolation to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:29">8:29</a> And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the evening;  and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they  took his carcase down from the tree, and threw it down at the  entrance of the gate of the city, and raised upon it a great  heap of stones, [which remains] to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:30">8:30</a> Then Joshua built an altar to Jehovah the God of Israel, in  mount Ebal,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:31">8:31</a> as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded the children  of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an  altar of whole stones, over which iron had not been lifted up.  And they offered up burnt-offerings on it to Jehovah, and  sacrificed peace-offerings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:32">8:32</a> And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of  Moses, which he had written before the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:33">8:33</a> And all Israel, and their elders, and their officers and  judges, stood on this side and on that side of the ark before  the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of  Jehovah, as well the stranger as the home-born [Israelite];  half of them toward mount Gerizim, and the other half of them  toward mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of Jehovah had  commanded, that they should bless the people of Israel, in the  beginning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:34">8:34</a> And afterwards he read all the words of the law, the  blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the  book of the law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:35">8:35</a> There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which  Joshua read not before the whole congregation of Israel, and  the women, and the children, and the strangers that lived among  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And it came to pass when all the kings who were on this side  the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and along  all the coast of the great sea as far as opposite to Lebanon,  the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the  Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard [of it],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> that they assembled together, to fight with Joshua and with  Israel, with one accord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had  done to Jericho and to Ai,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> then they also acted with craft, and they went prepared as  on a journey, and took old sacks upon their asses, and  wine-flasks, old and rent and tied up;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> and old and patched sandals upon their feet, and old  garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was  dry [and] mouldy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said to  him, and to the men of Israel, From a far country are we come;  and now make a covenant with us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> And the men of Israel said to the Hivite, Perhaps thou  dwellest in the midst of us, and how should I make a covenant  with thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua  said to them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And they said to him, From a very far country are thy  servants come, because of the name of Jehovah thy God; for we  have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites that  were beyond Jordan, to Sihon the king of Heshbon, and to Og the  king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke  to us, saying, Take victuals in your hand for the way, and go  to meet them, and say to them, We are your servants, and now  make a covenant with us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> This our bread we took warm for our provision out of our  houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; and now,  behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And these flasks of wine which we filled new, behold, they  are rent; and these our garments and our sandals are become old  by reason of the very long journey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> And the men took of their victuals, but they did not  inquire at the mouth of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with  them, to let them live; and the princes of the assembly swore  unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had  made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their  neighbours, and that they dwelt in their midst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their  cities on the third day; and their cities were Gibeon, and  Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> And the children of Israel did not smite them, because the  princes of the assembly had sworn unto them by Jehovah the God  of Israel. Then all the assembly murmured against the princes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> And all the princes said to all the assembly, We have sworn  unto them by Jehovah the God of Israel, and now we may not  touch them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> This we will do to them, and let them live, lest wrath come  upon us, because of the oath which we swore unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> And the princes said to them, Let them live. And they were  hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the assembly; as  the princes had said to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying,  Why have ye deceived us, saying, We are very far from you;  whereas ye dwell in our midst?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> And now ye are cursed, and ye shall never cease to be  bondmen, and hewers of wood, and drawers of water for the house  of my God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> And they answered Joshua and said, Because it was certainly  told thy servants how that Jehovah thy God commanded his  servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the  inhabitants of the land from before you; and we feared greatly  for our lives because of you, and did this thing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> And now behold, we are in thy hand: as it is good and right  in thine eyes to do to us, do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> And he did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand  of the children of Israel, and they did not slay them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of  water for the assembly, and for the altar of Jehovah, to this  day, in the place which he should choose.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> And it came to pass when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem  heard that Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly destroyed it,  that he had done to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho  and its king, and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace  with Israel, and were among them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> that they feared greatly; for Gibeon was a great city, as  one of the royal cities, and it was greater than Ai, and all  its men were mighty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> And Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of  Hebron, and to Piream king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of  Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> Come up to me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon; for  it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> And the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,  the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish,  [and] the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went  up, they and all their armies, and they encamped before Gibeon,  and made war against it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua, to the camp at  Gilgal, saying, Withdraw not thy hand from thy servants: come  up to us quickly, and save us and help us; for all the kings of  the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered  against us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war  with him, even all the valiant men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> And Jehovah said to Joshua, Fear them not; for into thy  hand have I given them: not a man of them shall stand before  thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> And Joshua came upon them suddenly; he went up from Gilgal  all night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel, and smote them  [with] a great slaughter at Gibeon; and he chased them on the  way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them up to Azekah  and Makkedah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, --  they were at the descent of Beth-horon, -- that Jehovah cast  down great stones from heaven upon them up to Azekah, and they  died. They were more who died with the hailstones than they  whom the children of Israel had slain with the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> Then spoke Joshua to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah gave  up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in  the sight of Israel, Sun, stand still upon Gibeon; And thou,  moon, in the valley of Ajalon!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> And the sun stood still, and the moon remained where it  was, until the nation had avenged themselves upon their  enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? And the sun  remained standing in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go  down about a full day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> And there was no day like that before it or after it, that  Jehovah hearkened to the voice of a man; for Jehovah fought for  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp,  to Gilgal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave  at Makkedah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings have been  found, hid in the cave at Makkedah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> And Joshua said, Roll great stones before the mouth of the  cave, and set men before it to keep them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> And ye, stay not, pursue after your enemies, and smite the  hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities;  for Jehovah your God has given them into your hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> And it came to pass when Joshua and the children of Israel  had ended smiting them with a very great slaughter, until they  were consumed, that the remnant which remained of them entered  into fortified cities;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> and all the people returned to the camp to Joshua, at  Makkedah, in peace; none moved his tongue against the children  of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> And Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring  forth to me those five kings out of the cave.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> And they did so, and brought forth to him those five kings  out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the  king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> And it came to pass when they had brought forth those  kings to Joshua, that Joshua called to all the men of Israel,  and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him,  Come forward, put your feet on the necks of these kings. And  they came forward and put their feet on their necks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> And Joshua said to them, Fear not, neither be dismayed; be  strong and courageous, for thus will Jehovah do to all your  enemies against whom ye fight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:26">10:26</a> And afterwards Joshua smote them, and put them to death,  and hanged them on five trees; and they were hanging upon the  trees until the evening.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:27">10:27</a> And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the  sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the  trees, and cast them into the cave where they had been hid, and  laid great stones before the cave's mouth, [which remain] to  this very day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:28">10:28</a> And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with  the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, him and all the  souls that were therein he utterly destroyed; he let none  remain; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to  the king of Jericho.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:29">10:29</a> And Joshua passed, and all Israel with him, from Makkedah  to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:30">10:30</a> And Jehovah gave it also and the king thereof into the  hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and  all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it: and  he did to the king thereof as he had done to the king of  Jericho.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:31">10:31</a> And Joshua passed, and all Israel with him, from Libnah to  Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:32">10:32</a> And Jehovah gave Lachish into the hand of Israel; and they  took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the  sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all  that he had done to Libnah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:33">10:33</a> Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and  Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none  remaining.</p>

 <p><a name="an_10:37">10:37</a> And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword,  and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the  souls that were therein: he let none remain, according to all  that he had done to Eglon; and he utterly destroyed it, and all  the souls that were therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:38">10:38</a> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir;  and fought against it.</p>

 <p><a name="an_10:40">10:40</a> And Joshua smote the whole country, the mountain, and the  south, and the lowland, and the hill-slopes, and all their  kings: he let none remain, but he utterly destroyed all that  breathed, as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:41">10:41</a> And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gazah,  and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:42">10:42</a> and all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one  time; for Jehovah the God of Israel fought for Israel.</p>

 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And it came to pass when Jabin king of Hazor heard [this],  that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of  Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,</p>

 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and  smote the king thereof with the sword; for Hazor was in times  past the head of all those kingdoms.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> And they smote all the souls that were therein with the  edge of the sword, destroying them utterly: there was not any  left to breathe; and he burned Hazor with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> And all the cities of those kings and all their kings did  Joshua take; and he smote them with the edge of the sword,  destroying them utterly, as Moses the servant of Jehovah had  commanded.</p>

 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> And Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from  the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all  the mountain of Judah, and from all the mountain of Israel:  Joshua destroyed them utterly, with their cities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> There were none of the Anakim left in the land of the  children of Israel; only at Gazah, at Gath, and at Ashdod there  remained.</p>

 <p><a name="an_13:33">13:33</a> But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance:  Jehovah the God of Israel is their inheritance, as he said to  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And this is what the children of Israel inherited in the  land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of  Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of  Israel, allotted for inheritance to them:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> their inheritance was by lot, as Jehovah had commanded by  Moses, for the nine tribes, and the half tribe.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and  the half tribe beyond the Jordan, but to the Levites he had  given no inheritance among them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and  Ephraim; and they gave no part to the Levites in the land, save  cities to dwell in, and their suburbs for their cattle and for  their substance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> As Jehovah had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel  did, and they divided the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> Then the children of Judah came near to Joshua in Gilgal,  and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, Thou  knowest the word that Jehovah spoke to Moses the man of God,  concerning me and thee, in Kadesh-barnea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Jehovah  sent me from Kadesh-barnea to search out the land; and I  brought him word again as it was in my heart.</p>

 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> And Moses swore on that day, saying, The land whereon thy  feet have trodden shall assuredly be thine inheritance, and thy  children's for ever! for thou hast wholly followed Jehovah my  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> And now behold, Jehovah has kept me alive, as he said,  these forty-five years, since Jehovah spoke this word to Moses,  when Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now behold, I am  this day eighty-five years old.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> I am still this day strong, as in the day that Moses sent  me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for  war, both to go out and to come in.</p>

 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb the son  of Jephunneh for an inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son  of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly  followed Jehovah the God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> Now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-Arba; the great  man among the Anakim. And the land rested from war.</p>

 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> and it went out south of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed  on to Zin, and went up on the south of Kadesh-barnea, and  passed to Hezron, and went up toward Addar, and turned toward  Karkaah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> and passed on to Azmon, and went out by the torrent of  Egypt; and the border ended at the sea. That shall be your  border southward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> -- And the eastern border was the salt sea as far as the  end of the Jordan. -- And the border on the north side was from  the tongue of the salt sea, at the end of the Jordan;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> and the border went up toward Beth-hoglah, and passed north  of Beth-Arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan,  the son of Reuben;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> and the border went up toward Debir from the valley of  Achor, and turned northward to Gilgal, which is opposite to the  ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the torrent;  and the border passed to the waters of En-shemesh, and ended at  En-rogel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> and the border went up to the valley of the son of Hinnom,  toward the south side of the Jebusite, that is, Jerusalem; and  the border went up to the top of the mountain that is before  the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the  valley of Rephaim northward;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:9">15:9</a> and the border reached along from the top of the mountain  toward the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out  toward the cities of mount Ephron; and the border reached along  to Baalah, that is, Kirjath-jearim;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:10">15:10</a> and the border turned from Baalah westwards toward mount  Seir, and passed toward the side of Har-jearim, that is,  Chesalon, northwards, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed  Timnah.</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> And the men arose and went away. And Joshua charged them  that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the  land, and describe it, and come again to me, and I will cast  lots for you here before Jehovah in Shiloh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And the men went and passed through the land, and described  it by cities into seven portions, in a book, and they came to  Joshua, to the camp at Shiloh.</p>

 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this  day, and ye have kept the charge of the commandment of Jehovah  your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> And now Jehovah your God hath given rest to your brethren,  as he said unto them; and now return, and get you unto your  tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses the  servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan.</p>

 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> And Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went  to their tents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> And to half the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given  [inheritance] in Bashan, and to the other half thereof had  Joshua given among their brethren on this side the Jordan  westward. And when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he  blessed them also,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> and spoke to them, saying, Return unto your tents with much  wealth and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold,  and with copper, and with iron, and with clothing, in very  great quantity; divide the spoil of your enemies with your  brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the  half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children  of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go  to the country of Gilead, into the land of their possession, of  which they had become possessed, according to the word of  Jehovah through Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> And they came to the districts of the Jordan that are in  the land of Canaan; and the children of Reuben and the children  of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by  the Jordan, an altar of grand appearance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children  of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of  Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan,  in the districts of the Jordan, separately from the children of  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> And when the children of Israel heard [of it], the whole  assembly of the children of Israel gathered together at Shiloh,  to go up against them to war.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben,  and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh,  into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the  priest,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> and with him ten princes, of each father's house a prince,  out of all the tribes of Israel; and each of them was head of a  father's house, of the thousands of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> And they came to the children of Reuben, and to the  children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, to the land  of Gilead, and spoke with them, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> Thus saith the whole assembly of Jehovah: What wickedness  is this which ye have committed against the God of Israel, to  turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that ye have  built yourselves an altar, rebelling this day against Jehovah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us? from which we  are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in  the assembly of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> And ye turn away this day from following Jehovah; and it  will be, that since ye rebel this day against Jehovah,  to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole assembly of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession is  unclean, come over into the land of the possession of Jehovah,  where Jehovah's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession  amongst us; but rebel not against Jehovah, and rebel not  against us, in building for yourselves an altar besides the  altar of Jehovah our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the  accursed thing? and wrath fell on all the assembly of Israel,  and he perished not alone in his iniquity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:21">22:21</a> And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the  half tribe of Manasseh answered and said to the heads of the  thousands of Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> The ùGod of gods, Jehovah, the ùGod of gods, Jehovah, he  knoweth, and Israel he shall know [it]; if it is in rebellion,  or if in trespass against Jehovah, -- save us not this day!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:23">22:23</a> -- that we have built for ourselves an altar to turn from  following Jehovah, and if it is to offer up burnt-offering and  oblation on it, and if to offer peace-offerings thereon, let  Jehovah himself require it [from us];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:24">22:24</a> and if we have not done it from fear of this thing,  saying, In future your children will speak to our children,  saying, What have ye to do with Jehovah the God of Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:25">22:25</a> Jehovah hath made the Jordan a border between us and you,  ye children of Reuben and children of Gad, ye have no portion  in Jehovah! And so shall your children make our children cease  from fearing Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:26">22:26</a> And we said, Let us now set to work to build an altar, not  for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:27">22:27</a> but to be a witness between us and you, and between our  generations after us, that we might do service to Jehovah  before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices,  and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to  our children in future, Ye have no portion in Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:28">22:28</a> And we said, If it shall be that in future they so say to  us and to our generations, we will say, Behold the pattern of  the altar of Jehovah which our fathers made, not for  burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice, but as a witness between us  and you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:29">22:29</a> Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah,  and turn this day from following Jehovah, in building an altar  for burnt-offering, for oblation, and for sacrifice, besides  the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:30">22:30</a> And when Phinehas the priest and the princes of the  assembly and the heads of the thousands of Israel that were  with him heard the words that the children of Reuben and the  children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it was good  in their sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:31">22:31</a> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the  children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the  children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that Jehovah is  among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against  Jehovah: now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of  the hand of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:32">22:32</a> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the  princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the  children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of  Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:33">22:33</a> And the thing was good in the sight of the children of  Israel, and the children of Israel blessed God, and no more  said that they would go up in warfare against them, to destroy  the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of  Gad dwelt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:34">22:34</a> And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad gave a  name to the altar; for it is a witness between us that Jehovah  is God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> And it came to pass a long time after that Jehovah had  given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, and  Joshua had become old, advanced in age,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:2">23:2</a> that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders, and  for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers,  and said unto them, I am become old, advanced in age;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> and ye have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done to all  these nations because of you. For Jehovah your God is he that  hath fought for you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> Behold, I have divided unto you by lot for an inheritance,  according to your tribes, these nations that remain, from the  Jordan, as well as all the nations that I have cut off, as far  as the great sea toward the sun-setting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> And Jehovah your God, he will expel them from before you,  and dispossess them from out of your sight; and ye shall take  possession of their land, as Jehovah your God hath said unto  you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> And be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is  written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside  therefrom to the right hand or to the left;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> that ye enter not among these nations, these that remain  among you; and ye shall make no mention of the name of their  gods, nor cause to swear [by them], neither serve them, nor bow  yourselves unto them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> but ye shall cleave unto Jehovah your God, as ye have done  unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:9">23:9</a> For Jehovah hath dispossessed from before you great and  strong nations; and as to you, no man hath been able to stand  before you unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> One man of you chaseth a thousand; for Jehovah your God,  he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath said unto you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> Take great heed therefore unto your souls, that ye love  Jehovah your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> For if ye in any wise go back, and cleave unto the residue  of these nations, these that remain among you, and make  marriages with them, and come in unto them and they unto you:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:13">23:13</a> know for a certainty that Jehovah your God will no more  dispossess these nations from before you, and they shall be  snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and  thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land  which Jehovah your God hath given you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> And behold, I am going this day the way of all the earth;  and ye know in all your heart, and in all your soul, that not  one thing hath failed of all the good words that Jehovah your  God hath spoken concerning you: all are come to pass unto you  -- not one thing hath failed thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> But it shall come to pass, that as every good word hath  been fulfilled to you, that Jehovah your God spoke to you, so  will Jehovah bring upon you every evil word, until he have  destroyed you from off this good land which Jehovah your God  hath given you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:16">23:16</a> when ye transgress the covenant of Jehovah your God which  he commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow  yourselves unto them, so that the anger of Jehovah shall be  kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the  good land which he hath given unto you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem,  and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and  for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented  themselves before God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith Jehovah the  God of Israel: Your fathers dwelt of old on the other side of  the river, Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of  Nahor, and they served other gods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the  river, and led him throughout the land of Canaan, and  multiplied his seed and gave him Isaac.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau; and I gave unto Esau  mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his sons went down  into Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according  to that which I did among them; and afterwards I brought you  out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> And I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and ye came unto  the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with  chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> Then they cried to Jehovah, and he put darkness between you  and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered  them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt; and ye dwelt in  the wilderness a long time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:8">24:8</a> And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt  beyond the Jordan, and they fought with you, and I gave them  into your hand, and ye took possession of their land, and I  destroyed them from before you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:9">24:9</a> And Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred  against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to  curse you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> but I would not hearken unto Balaam, and he blessed you  expressly, and I delivered you out of his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:11">24:11</a> And ye went over the Jordan, and came unto Jericho, and  the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the  Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the  Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered  them into your hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:12">24:12</a> And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out  from before you, [as] the two kings of the Amorites; not with  thy sword, nor with thy bow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:13">24:13</a> And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour,  and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of  vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:14">24:14</a> And now fear Jehovah and serve him in perfectness and in  truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served on the  other side of the river, and in Egypt; and serve Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:15">24:15</a> And if it seem evil unto you to serve Jehovah, choose you  this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods whom your fathers  that were on the other side of the river served, or the gods of  the Amorite, in whose land ye dwell; but as for me and my  house, we will serve Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:16">24:16</a> And the people answered and said, Far be it from us that  we should forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:17">24:17</a> for Jehovah our God, he it is that brought us up and our  fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,  and who did those great signs before our eyes, and preserved us  in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoples  through whom we passed!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:18">24:18</a> And Jehovah drove out from before us all the peoples, and  the Amorites the inhabitants of the land: so therefore we will  serve Jehovah, for he is our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:19">24:19</a> And Joshua said to the people, Ye cannot serve Jehovah,  for he is a holy God; he is a jealous ùGod; he will not forgive  your transgressions nor your sins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:20">24:20</a> If ye forsake Jehovah, and serve strange gods, then he  will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath  done you good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:21">24:21</a> And the people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:22">24:22</a> And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against  yourselves that ye have chosen you Jehovah, to serve him. And  they said, [We are] witnesses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:23">24:23</a> Now therefore put away the strange gods that are among  you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah the God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:24">24:24</a> And the people said unto Joshua, Jehovah our God will we  serve, and to his voice will we hearken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:25">24:25</a> So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and  set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:26">24:26</a> And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of  God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak  that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:27">24:27</a> And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone  shall be a witness unto us, for it hath heard all the words of  Jehovah which he spoke unto us; and it shall be a witness  against you, lest ye deny your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:28">24:28</a> And Joshua dismissed the people, every man to his  inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:29">24:29</a> And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the  son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, a hundred and ten  years old.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:30">24:30</a> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in  Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of  the mountain of Gaash.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:31">24:31</a> And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all  the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua,  and who had known all the works of Jehovah, which he had done  for Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:32">24:32</a> And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had  brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem in the portion  of the field which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hamor,  Shechem's father, for a hundred kesitahs; and it became the  inheritance of the children of Joseph.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:33">24:33</a> And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in  the hill of Phinehas his son, which had been given him in mount  Ephraim.</p>
