  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: 2 Chronicles</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his  kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him and magnified him  exceedingly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of  thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the  princes of all Israel, the chief fathers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> and Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the  high place at Gibeon; for there was God's tent of meeting which  Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim  to the [place] that David had prepared for it; for he had  spread a tent for it at Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And the brazen altar that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son  of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah;  and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And Solomon offered there upon the brazen altar before  Jehovah which was at the tent of meeting; and he offered up a  thousand burnt-offerings upon it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask  what I shall give thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And Solomon said to God, Thou hast shewn unto David my  father great loving-kindness, and hast made me king in his  stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Now, Jehovah Elohim, let thy word unto David my father be  firm; for thou hast made me king over a people numerous as the  dust of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and  come in before this people; for who can judge this thy great  people?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and  thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of  them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast  asked for thyself wisdom and knowledge, that thou mayest judge  my people, over whom I have made thee king:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> wisdom and knowledge are granted unto thee; and I will give  thee riches and wealth and honour, such as none of the kings  have had that have been before thee, neither shall any after  thee have the like.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Then Solomon came back [from] the high place at Gibeon to  Jerusalem, from before the tent of meeting, and reigned over  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had a  thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen;  and he placed them in the chariot-cities, and with the king at  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem as stones,  and cedars made he as the sycamores that are in the lowland for  abundance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And the exportation of horses that Solomon had was from  Egypt: a caravan of the king's merchants fetched a drove [of  horses], at a price.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And they fetched up and brought forth out of Egypt a  chariot for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for a  hundred and fifty; and so they brought [them] by their means,  for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of  Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And Solomon numbered seventy thousand men to bear burdens,  and eighty thousand stone-masons in the mountain, and three  thousand six hundred to superintend them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And Solomon sent to Huram king of Tyre, saying, As thou  didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to  build him a house to dwell therein [so do for me].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> Behold, I build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God to  dedicate it to him, to burn before him sweet incense, and for  the continual arrangement [of the shewbread], and for the  morning and evening burnt-offerings [and] on the sabbaths and  on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God.  This is [an ordinance] for ever to Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And the house that I will build is great; for great is our  God above all gods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> But who is able to build him a house, seeing the heavens and  the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? And who am I that I  should build him a house, except to burn sacrifice before him?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And now send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in  silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple and crimson  and blue, and experienced in carving, besides the skilful men  that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my  father provided.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> Send me also cedar-trees, cypress-trees, and sandal-wood  trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants are  experienced in cutting timber in Lebanon; and behold, my  servants shall be with thy servants,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house that I  build shall be great and wonderful.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> And behold, I will give to thy servants the hewers that  fell timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and  twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths  of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And Huram king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent  to Solomon, Because Jehovah loved his people, he made thee king  over them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And Huram said, Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, that  made the heavens and the earth, who has given to David the king  a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, who will  build a house for Jehovah and a house for his kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And now, I send a skilful man, endued with understanding,  Huram Abi,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and whose  father was a man of Tyre, experienced in working in gold, and  in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in  purple, in blue, and in byssus, and in crimson, and for doing  any manner of engraving, and for inventing every device which  shall be put to him, besides thy skilful men, and the skilful  men of my lord David thy father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And now the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine,  which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt  need; and we will bring it to thee [in] floats by sea to Joppa,  and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the  land of Israel, after the account that David his father had  taken of them, and there were found a hundred and fifty-three  thousand six hundred.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And he set seventy thousand of them to be bearers of  burdens, and eighty thousand to be stone-masons in the  mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the  people to work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem  on mount Moriah, where he appeared to David his father, in the  place that David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Ornan  the Jebusite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And he began to build on the second of the second month, in  the fourth year of his reign.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And this was Solomon's foundation for the construction of  the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure  was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And the porch which was in front was twenty cubits in  length, in front of the house broadways, and the height was a  hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And the greater house he boarded with cypress-wood, which he  overlaid with fine gold, and set on it palm-trees and chains.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And he overlaid the house with precious stones for beauty;  and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And he covered the house, the beams, the threshold, and its  walls, and its doors with gold, and engraved cherubim on the  walls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And he made the house of the most holy place, the length of  which was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits,  and its breadth twenty cubits; and he covered it with fine  gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And  he covered the upper chambers with gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> And in the house of the most holy place he made two  cherubim of image work, and they overlaid them with gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: one  wing of five cubits touched the wall of the house; and the  other wing of five cubits touched the wing of the other cherub.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And the wing of the other cherub of five cubits touched the  wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits joining  the wing of the other cherub.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> The wings of these cherubim spread forth were twenty  cubits; and they stood on their feet, and their faces were  toward the house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and  byssus, and made cherubim upon it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And before the house he made two pillars thirty-five cubits  long; and the capital that was on the top of each of them was  five cubits.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> And he made chains [as] in the oracle, and he put them on  the top of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and  put them on the chains.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> And he set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on  the right hand and the other on the left; and he called the  name of that on the right Jachin, and the name of that on the  left Boaz.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And he made a brazen altar: its length was twenty cubits,  and its breadth twenty cubits, and its height ten cubits.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And he made the sea, molten, ten cubits from brim to brim,  round all about; and its height was five cubits; and a line of  thirty cubits encompassed it round about.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And under it was the similitude of oxen, encompassing it  round about, ten in a cubit enclosing the sea round about, two  rows of oxen, cast when it was cast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north,  and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the  south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was above  upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And its thickness was a hand-breadth, and its brim like the  work of the brim of a cup, with lily-blossoms; in capacity it  held three thousand baths.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And he made ten lavers, and put five on the right and five  on the left, to wash in them: they rinsed in them what they  prepared for the burnt-offering; and the sea was for the  priests to wash in.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to the  ordinance respecting them, and set them in the temple, five on  the right hand and five on the left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And he made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five  on the right hand and five on the left. And he made a hundred  golden bowls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And he made the court of the priests, and the great court,  and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors thereof with  bronze.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And he set the sea on the right side eastward, over against  the south.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls. So  Huram ended doing the work that he made for king Solomon in the  house of God:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> two pillars, and the globes and the capitals on the top of  the pillars, two; and the two networks, to cover the two globes  of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two  rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two globes  of the capitals which were upon the pillars.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And he made the bases, and he made the lavers on the bases;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> And the pots, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their  instruments did Huram Abiv make king Solomon for the house of  Jehovah, of bright brass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the  clay-ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And Solomon made all these vessels in great number; for the  weight of the brass was not ascertained.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And Solomon made all the vessels that were [in] the house  of God: the golden altar; and the tables whereon was the  shewbread;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> and the candlesticks with their lamps to burn according to  the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold (it  was perfect gold);</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> and the knives, and the bowls, and the cups, and the  censers, of pure gold; and the entrance of the house, the inner  folding-doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of  the house, of the temple, of gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And all the work was finished that Solomon made for the  house of Jehovah. And Solomon brought in the things that David  his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all  the vessels he put among the treasures of the house of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the  heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers of the children  of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of  Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king  at the feast, that of the seventh month.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up  the ark.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> And they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and  all the holy vessels that were in the tent: the priests, the  Levites, brought them up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And king Solomon, and all the assembly of Israel, that were  assembled to him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen  which could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of  Jehovah to its place, into the oracle of the house, into the  most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> and the cherubim stretched forth [their] wings over the  place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its  staves above.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> And the staves were long, so that the ends of the staves  were seen outside the ark before the oracle; but they were not  seen without. And there they are to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which  Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made [a covenant] with  the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And it came to pass when the priests were come out of the  holy place (for all the priests that were present were hallowed  without observing the courses;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> and the Levites the singers, all they of Asaph, of Heman,  of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, clad in  byssus, with cymbals and lutes and harps, stood at the east end  of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests  sounding with trumpets),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> -- it came to pass when the trumpeters and singers were as  one, to make one voice to be heard in praising and thanking  Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with trumpets, and  cymbals, and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah: For he  is good, for his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever; that then  the house, the house of Jehovah, was filled with a cloud,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> and the priests could not stand to do their service because  of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> Then said Solomon: Jehovah said that he would dwell in the  thick darkness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> But I have built a house of habitation for thee, even a  settled place for thee to abide in for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And the king turned his face and blessed the whole  congregation of Israel; and the whole congregation of Israel  stood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And he said: Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, who spoke  with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hands  fulfilled it, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land  of Egypt I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to  build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I  any man to be prince over my people Israel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there;  and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house  unto the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> But Jehovah said to David my father, Whereas it was in thy  heart to build a house unto my name, thou didst well that it  was in thy heart;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son  that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the  house unto my name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And Jehovah has performed his word which he spoke; and I am  risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne  of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and I have built the house unto  the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of  Jehovah, which he made with the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And he stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of  the whole congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> For Solomon had made a platform of bronze, five cubits  long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set  it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and he  kneeled down on his knees before the whole congregation of  Israel, and spread forth his hands toward the heavens,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> and said, Jehovah, God of Israel! there is no God like  thee, in the heavens or on the earth, who keepest covenant and  mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their  heart;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which  thou didst promise him; thou spokest with thy mouth, and hast  fulfilled [it] with thy hand as at this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> And now, Jehovah, God of Israel, keep with thy servant  David my father that which thou hast promised him saying, There  shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of  Israel, if only thy sons take heed to their way to walk in my  law, as thou hast walked before me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> And now, Jehovah, God of Israel, let thy word be verified  which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> But will God indeed dwell with man on the earth? behold,  the heavens and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how  much less this house which I have built!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> Yet have respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his  supplication, Jehovah, my God, to hearken unto the cry and to  the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night,  upon the place in which thou hast said thou wouldest put thy  name: to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth  toward this place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> And hearken unto the supplications of thy servant, and of  thy people Israel, which they shall pray toward this place, and  hear thou from thy dwelling-place, from the heavens, and when  thou hearest, forgive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> If a man have sinned against his neighbour, and an oath be  laid upon him to adjure him, and the oath come before thine  altar in this house;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> then hear thou from the heavens, and do, and judge thy  servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own  head; and justifying the righteous, giving him according to his  righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the  enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn  again and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication  before thee in this house;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy  people Israel, and bring them again unto the land that thou  gavest to them and to their fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:26">6:26</a> When the heavens are shut up, and there is no rain, because  they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place,  and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, because thou  hast afflicted them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:27">6:27</a> then hear thou in the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy  servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the  good way wherein they should walk; and give rain upon thy land,  which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:28">6:28</a> If there be famine in the land, if there be pestilence, if  there be blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their  enemies besiege them in the land of their gates; whatever  plague or whatever sickness there be:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:29">6:29</a> what prayer, what supplication soever be made by any man,  or by all thy people Israel, when they shall know every man his  own plague, and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands  toward this house;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:30">6:30</a> then hear thou from the heavens, the settled place of thy  dwelling, and forgive, and render unto every man according to  all his ways, whose heart thou knowest (for thou, thou only,  knowest the hearts of the children of men),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:31">6:31</a> that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, all the days  that they live upon the land which thou gavest unto our  fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:32">6:32</a> And as to the stranger also, who is not of thy people  Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy great name's  sake, and thy mighty hand and thy stretched-out arm; when they  shall come and pray toward this house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:33">6:33</a> then hear thou from the heavens, the settled place of thy  dwelling, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to  thee for; in order that all peoples of the earth may know thy  name, and may fear thee as do thy people Israel, and may know  that this house which I have built is called by thy name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:34">6:34</a> If thy people go out to battle against their enemies by the  way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward  this city that thou hast chosen, and the house that I have  built unto thy name;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:35">6:35</a> then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their  supplication, and maintain their right.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:36">6:36</a> If they have sinned against thee (for there is no man that  sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and give them up to  the enemy, and they have carried them away captives unto a land  far off or near;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:37">6:37</a> and if they shall take it to heart in the land whither they  were carried captive, and repent, and make supplication unto  thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we  have done iniquity and have dealt perversely;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:38">6:38</a> and if they return unto thee with all their heart and with  all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they  have carried them captives, and pray toward their land which  thou gavest unto their fathers, and the city that thou hast  chosen, and the house that I have built unto thy name;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:39">6:39</a> then hear thou from the heavens, from the settled place of  thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplications, and  maintain their right, and forgive thy people their sin against  thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:40">6:40</a> Now, my God, I beseech thee, let thine eyes be open and let  thine ears be attentive unto the prayer [that is made] in this  place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:41">6:41</a> And now, arise, Jehovah Elohim, into thy resting-place,  thou and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, Jehovah  Elohim, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice  in [thy] goodness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:42">6:42</a> Jehovah Elohim, turn not away the face of thine anointed:  remember mercies to David thy servant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And when Solomon had ended praying, the fire came down from  the heavens and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices;  and the glory of Jehovah filled the house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> And the priests could not enter into the house of Jehovah,  because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovah's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> And all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down,  and the glory of Jehovah upon the house, and bowed themselves  with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshipped  and thanked Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving-kindness  [endureth] for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> And the king and all the people offered sacrifices before  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> And king Solomon sacrificed a sacrifice of twenty-two  thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the  king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> And the priests stood in their charges, and the Levites with  Jehovah's instruments of music, which David the king had made  to praise Jehovah, for his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever,  when David praised by their means; and the priests sounded the  trumpets opposite to them, and all Israel stood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> And Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before  the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offerings,  and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar  which Solomon had made was not able to receive the  burnt-offerings and the oblations and the fat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> And at that time Solomon held the feast seven days, and all  Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance  of Hamath unto the torrent of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly; for they  kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast  seven days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he  sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart  for the goodness that Jehovah had done to David and to Solomon,  and to Israel his people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> And Solomon completed the house of Jehovah, and the king's  house; and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the  house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he did prosperously.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> Then Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him:  I have heard thy prayer, and I have chosen for myself this  place for a house of sacrifice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> If I shut up the heavens that there be no rain, or if I  command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence  among my people;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> and my people, who are called by my name, humble  themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their  wicked ways; then will I hear from the heavens, and forgive  their sin, and heal their land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attentive to the  prayer [made] in this place;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> for I have now chosen and hallowed this house, that my name  may be there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be  there perpetually.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> And [as for] thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David  thy father walked, to do according to all that I have commanded  thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom, according  as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall  not fail thee a man to rule over Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> But if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my  commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve  other gods and worship them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which  I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed to my  name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it a proverb  and a byword among all peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to  every one that passes by it; so that he shall say, Why has  Jehovah done thus to this land and to this house?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> And they shall say, Because they forsook Jehovah the God of  their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,  and have attached themselves to other gods, and have worshipped  them and served them; therefore he has brought upon them all  this evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon  had built the house of Jehovah and his own house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon  built them and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And Solomon went to Hamath-Zobah, and overcame it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> And he built Tadmor, in the wilderness, and all the  store-cities, which he built in Hamath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And he built upper Beth-Horon and lower Beth-Horon,  fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> and Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and  all the cities for chariots, and the cities for the horsemen,  and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and on  Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> All the people that were left of the Hittites, and the  Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the  Jebusites, who were not of Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> their children that were left after them in the land, whom  the children of Israel had not destroyed, upon them did Solomon  impose tribute-service until this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> But of the children of Israel, of them did Solomon make no  bondmen for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of  his captains, and captains of his chariots and his horsemen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> And these were the chief of king Solomon's superintendents,  two hundred and fifty, that ruled over the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the  city of David to the house which he had built for her; for he  said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of  Israel, because the [places] are holy to which the ark of  Jehovah has come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> Then Solomon offered up burnt-offerings to Jehovah on the  altar of Jehovah, which he had built before the porch;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> even as the duty of every day required, offering according  to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new  moons, and at the set feasts, three times in the year, -- at  the feast of unleavened bread, and at the feast of weeks, and  at the feast of tabernacles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his  father, the divisions of the priests for their service, and the  Levites for their charges, to praise and serve before the  priests, as the duty of every day required; and the doorkeepers  by their divisions at every gate: for such was the commandment  of David the man of God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> and they did not depart from the commandment of the king to  the priests and the Levites concerning any matter, nor  concerning the treasures.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> And all the work of Solomon was prepared, to the day of the  foundation of the house of Jehovah and to its completion. [So]  the house of Jehovah was finished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, on the  seashore in the land of Edom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> And Huram sent him by his servants ships, and servants that  had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of  Solomon to Ophir, and fetched thence four hundred and fifty  talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, and  came to Jerusalem to prove Solomon with enigmas; with a very  great train, and camels that bore spices and gold in great  abundance, and precious stones; and she came to Solomon, and  spoke with him of all that was in her heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> And Solomon explained to her all she spoke of, and there was  not a thing hidden from Solomon that he did not explain to her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And when the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, and  the house that he had built,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> and the food of his table, and the deportment of his  servants, and the order of service of his attendants and their  apparel, and his cupbearers and their apparel, and his ascent  by which he went up to the house of Jehovah, there was no more  spirit in her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard  in mine own land of thine affairs and of thy wisdom;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> but I gave no credit to their words, until I came and mine  eyes had seen; and behold, the half of the greatness of thy  wisdom was not told me: thou exceedest the report that I heard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, who  stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set  thee on his throne, to be king to Jehovah thy God! Because thy  God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore did he  make thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold,  and spices in very great abundance, and precious stones;  neither was there any such spice as that which the queen of  Sheba gave to king Solomon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> (And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of  Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought sandal-wood and  precious stones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And the king made of the sandal-wood stairs for the house  of Jehovah, and for the king's house, and harps and lutes for  the singers. And there were none such seen before in the land  of Judah.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,  whatever she asked, besides what she had brought to the king.  And she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was  six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> besides [what] dealers and merchants brought, and [what]  all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country  brought of gold and silver to Solomon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold,  -- he applied six hundred [shekels] of beaten gold to one  target;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> and three hundred shields of beaten gold, -- he applied  three hundred [shekels] of gold to one shield; and the king put  them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> And the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it  with pure gold;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> and the throne had six steps, with a footstool of gold  fastened to the throne; and there were arms on each side at the  place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the arms;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the  other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any  kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and  all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of  precious gold: silver was not of the least account in the days  of Solomon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of  Huram: once in three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing  gold and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> And king Solomon was greater than all the kings of the  earth in riches and wisdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of  Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver  and vessels of gold, and clothing, armour, and spices, horses  and mules, a rate year by year.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and  chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he placed them in  the chariot-cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> And he ruled over all the kings from the river as far as  the land of the Philistines, and up to the border of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars  made he as the sycamores that are in the lowland for abundance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:28">9:28</a> And they brought to Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of  all lands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:29">9:29</a> And the rest of the acts of Solomon first and last, are  they not written in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the  prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo  the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:30">9:30</a> And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty  years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:31">9:31</a> And Solomon slept with his fathers, and they buried him in  the city of David his father; and Rehoboam his son reigned in  his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel had come to  Shechem to make him king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> And it came to pass when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it  (now he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of  king Solomon) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel  came and spoke to Rehoboam saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> Thy father made our yoke grievous; and now lighten the  grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he  put upon us, and we will serve thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> And he said to them, Come again to me after three days. And  the people departed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, who had stood  before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, How do ye  advise to return answer to this people?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> And they spoke to him saying, If thou be kind to this  people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they  will be thy servants for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> But he forsook the advice of the old men which they had  given him, and consulted with the young men, who had grown up  with him, that stood before him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> And he said to them, What advice give ye that we may return  answer to this people, who have spoken to me saying, Lighten  the yoke which thy father put upon us?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> And the young men that had grown up with him spoke to him  saying, Thus shalt thou say to the people who have spoken to  thee saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and lighten thou  it for us, -- thus shalt thou say to them: My little [finger]  is thicker than my father's loins;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> and whereas my father laid a heavy yoke upon you, *I* will  add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but *I*  [will chastise you] with scorpions.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> And Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third  day, as the king had appointed saying, Come again to me on the  third day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam  forsook the advice of the old men,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> and spoke to them according to the advice of the young  men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but *I* will add  to it; my father chastised you with whips, but *I* [will  chastise you] with scorpions.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> So the king hearkened not to the people; for it was  brought about by God, that Jehovah might give effect to his  word, which he spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam  the son of Nebat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> And all Israel saw that the king hearkened not to them;  and the people answered the king saying, What portion have we  in David? and [we have] no inheritance in the son of Jesse:  every man to your tents, O Israel. Now see to thine own house,  David! And all Israel went to their tents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities  of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> And king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the levy; but  the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.  And king Rehoboam hastened to mount his chariot, to flee to  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> And Israel rebelled against the house of David, unto this  day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And Rehoboam came to Jerusalem; and he assembled the house  of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men  apt for war, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the  kingdom again to Rehoboam.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and  unto all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Go not up, nor fight with your  brethren; return every man to his house; for this thing is from  me. And they hearkened to the words of Jehovah, and returned  from going against Jeroboam.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for  defence in Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> And he built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> and Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> and Zorah, and Ajalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and  in Benjamin, fortified cities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in  them, and stores of victuals, and of oil and wine;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> and in every several city, targets and spears, and made  them exceedingly strong. And Judah and Benjamin were his.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel  resorted to him out of all their districts;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> for the Levites left their suburbs and their possessions,  and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had  cast them off from exercising the priesthood to Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> and he ordained for himself priests for the high places,  and for the he-goats and for the calves that he had made.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> -- And after them, those out of all the tribes of Israel  that set their heart to seek Jehovah the God of Israel came to  Jerusalem, to sacrifice to Jehovah the God of their fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> And they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made  Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong three years; for during  three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> And Rehoboam took Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the  son of David as wife, [and of] Abihail the daughter of Eliab  the son of Jesse.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> And she bore him children: Jeush, and Shemariah, and  Zaham.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; and  she bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above  all his wives and his concubines; for he had taken eighteen  wives and sixty concubines, and he begot twenty-eight sons and  sixty daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> And Rehoboam established Abijah the son of Maachah at the  head, to be ruler among his brethren; for [he thought] to make  him king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons  throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to all the  fortified cities; and he gave them food in abundance. And he  desired [for them] a multitude of wives.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> And it came to pass when the kingdom of Rehoboam was  established, and when he had become strong, [that] he forsook  the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam,  because they had transgressed against Jehovah, that Shishak  king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen;  and the people were without number that came with him out of  Egypt: Libyans, Sukkites, and Ethiopians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> And he took the fortified cities that belonged to Judah,  and came to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> And Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and [to] the  princes of Judah that had gathered together to Jerusalem  because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus saith Jehovah: Ye  have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the  hand of Shishak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> And the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves;  and they said, Jehovah is righteous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> And when Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves, the word  of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled  themselves: I will not destroy them, but I will grant them a  little deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon  Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know  my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> And Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and  took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the  treasures of the king's house; he took away all; and he took  away the shields of gold that Solomon had made.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of bronze,  and committed them to the hands of the chief of the couriers  who kept the entrance of the king's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> And it was so, that as often as the king entered into the  house of Jehovah, the couriers came and fetched them, and  brought them again into the chamber of the couriers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> And when he humbled himself, the anger of Jehovah turned  away from him, that he would not destroy him altogether; and  also in Judah there were good things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> And king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and  reigned; for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to  reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city  that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put  his name there: and his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> And he did evil, for he applied not his heart to seek  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> And the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not  written in the words of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the  seer, in the genealogical registers? And there were wars  between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the  city of David. And Abijah his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to  reign over Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> He reigned three years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name  was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was  war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> And Abijah began the war with an army of men of war, four  hundred thousand chosen men; and Jeroboam set the battle in  array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men,  mighty men of valour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> And Abijah stood up on the top of mount Zemaraim, which is  in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam, and all Israel!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> Ought ye not to know that Jehovah the God of Israel gave  the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, to him and to his  sons [by] a covenant of salt?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> But Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the  son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> And vain men, sons of Belial, gathered to him and  strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon,  and Rehoboam was young and faint-hearted, and did not shew  himself strong against them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> And now ye think to shew yourselves strong against the  kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are  a great multitude, and ye have with you the golden calves that  Jeroboam made you for gods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> Have ye not cast out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of  Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests as the peoples of  the lands? whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young  bullock and seven rams, he becomes a priest of what is not God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not  forsaken him; and the priests that serve Jehovah are the sons  of Aaron, and the Levites are at their work:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> and they burn to Jehovah every morning and every evening  burnt-offerings and sweet incense; the loaves also are set in  order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with its  lamps to burn every evening: for *we* keep the charge of  Jehovah our God; but *ye* have forsaken him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> And behold, we have God with us at our head, and his  priests, and the loud-sounding trumpets to sound an alarm  against you. Children of Israel, do not fight with Jehovah the  God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them;  and they were before Judah, and the ambush behind them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> And Judah looked back, and behold, they had the battle in  front and behind; and they cried to Jehovah, and the priests  sounded with the trumpets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> And the men of Judah gave a shout; and as the men of Judah  shouted, it came to pass that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel  before Abijah and Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God  delivered them into their hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> And Abijah and his people slew them with a great  slaughter; and there fell down slain of Israel five hundred  thousand chosen men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> And the children of Israel were humbled at that time, and  the children of Judah were strengthened, because they relied  upon Jehovah the God of their fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from  him: Bethel with its dependent villages, and Jeshanah with its  dependent villages, and Ephron with its dependent villages.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> And Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of  Abijah; and Jehovah smote him, and he died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> But Abijah strengthened himself, and took fourteen wives,  and begot twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways and his  sayings, are written in the treatise of the prophet Iddo.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in  the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his  days the land was quiet ten years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> And Asa did what was good and right in the sight of Jehovah  his God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> and he took away the altars of the strange [gods] and the  high places, and broke the columns, and cut down the Asherahs;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah the God of their  fathers, and to practise the law and the commandment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> And he removed out of all the cities of Judah the high  places and the sun-images; and the kingdom was quiet before  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had  rest, and he had no war in those years; because Jehovah had  given him rest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> And he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and  surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars, while the  land is yet before us; for we have sought Jehovah our God; we  have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. And  they built and prospered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> And Asa had an army that bore targets and spears: out of  Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore  shields and drew the bow, two hundred and eighty thousand: all  these, mighty men of valour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> And Zerah the Ethiopian came out against him with a host of  a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots, and he came to  Mareshah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> And Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in  array in the valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, it  maketh no difference to thee to help, whether there be much or  no power: help us, O Jehovah our God, for we rely on thee, and  in thy name have we come against this multitude. Jehovah, thou  art our God; let not man prevail against thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> And Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before  Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to  Gerar; and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that none of them  was left alive; for they were crushed before Jehovah and before  his army. And they carried away very much spoil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> And they smote all the cities round about Gerar, for the  terror of Jehovah came upon them; and they spoiled all the  cities, for there was very much spoil in them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away  sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear ye me,  Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Jehovah is with you while ye  are with him; and if ye seek him he will be found of you, but  if ye forsake him he will forsake you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> Now for a long while Israel [was] without the true God, and  without a teaching priest, and without law;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> but in their trouble they turned to Jehovah the God of  Israel, and sought him, and he was found of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> And in those times there [was] no peace to him that went  out nor to him that came in, but great disturbances were  amongst all the inhabitants of the countries.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> And nation was broken against nation, and city against  city; for God disturbed them with all manner of distress.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> But as for you, be firm and let not your hands be weak; for  there is a reward for your deeds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the  prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of  all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities that  he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of  Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:9">15:9</a> And he assembled all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers  with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon; for  they fell away to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw  that Jehovah his God was with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:10">15:10</a> And they assembled themselves at Jerusalem in the third  month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:11">15:11</a> And they sacrificed to Jehovah in that day, of the spoil  that they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand  sheep.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:12">15:12</a> And they entered into a covenant to seek Jehovah the God  of their fathers, with all their heart, and with all their  soul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:13">15:13</a> and that whoever would not seek Jehovah the God of Israel  should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or  woman.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:14">15:14</a> And they swore to Jehovah with a loud voice, and with  shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:15">15:15</a> And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they took the oath  with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire;  and he was found of them. And Jehovah gave them rest round  about.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:16">15:16</a> And also Maachah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed  from being queen, because she had made an idol for the Asherah;  and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burned it in the  valley Kidron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:17">15:17</a> But the high places were not removed from Israel; only,  Asa's heart was perfect all his days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:18">15:18</a> And he brought into the house of God the things which his  father had dedicated, and the things which he himself had  dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:19">15:19</a> And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the  reign of Asa.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king  of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, in order to  let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> And Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of  the house of Jehovah and of the king's house, and sent to  Ben-hadad king of Syria, who dwelt at Damascus, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> There is a league between me and thee, and between my  father and thy father: behold, I send thee silver and gold; go,  break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart  from me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> And Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains  of his forces against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon  and Dan and Abelmaim, and all the store-magazines of the cities  of Naphtali.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> And it came to pass when Baasha heard of it, that he left  off building Ramah, and let his work cease.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> And king Asa took all Judah; and they carried away the  stones and the timber from Ramah, with which Baasha had been  building, and he built with them Geba and Mizpah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah,  and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of  Syria, and hast not relied on Jehovah thy God, therefore has  the army of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army, with  very many chariots and horsemen? but when thou didst rely on  Jehovah, he delivered them into thy hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro through the whole  earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of those whose  heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly;  for from henceforth thou shalt have wars.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> And Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in the  prison; for he was enraged with him because of this. And Asa  oppressed some of the people at the same time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> And behold the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they  are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> And Asa in the thirty-ninth year of his reign was diseased  in his feet, until his disease was extremely great; yet in his  disease he did not seek Jehovah, but the physicians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the  one-and-fortieth year of his reign.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> And they buried him in his own sepulchre, which he had  excavated for himself in the city of David, and laid him in a  bed filled with spices, a mixture of divers kinds prepared by  the perfumer's art; and they made a very great burning for him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and  strengthened himself against Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:2">17:2</a> And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah,  and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of  Ephraim that Asa his father had taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat, for he walked in the  first ways of his father David, and sought not unto the Baals;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> but he sought the God of his father, and walked in his  commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> And Jehovah established the kingdom in his hand; and all  Judah gave gifts to Jehoshaphat; and he had riches and honour  in abundance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> And he took courage in the ways of Jehovah; moreover, he  removed the high places and Asherahs out of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> And in the third year of his reign he sent his princes,  Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethaneel, and Micah,  to teach in the cities of Judah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> and with them the Levites: Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and  Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jonathan, and  Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah, Levites; and with them  Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of  Jehovah with them; and they went about through all the cities  of Judah, and taught among the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> And the terror of Jehovah was upon all the kingdoms of the  lands that were round about Judah, and they made no war against  Jehoshaphat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and  tribute-silver. The Arabians also brought him flocks, seven  thousand seven hundred rams, and seven thousand seven hundred  he-goats.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> And Jehoshaphat waxed exceeding great; and he built in  Judah castles and store-cities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> And he had much business in the cities of Judah; and men  of war, strong and valiant, in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> And these are the numbers of them according to their  fathers' houses. Of Judah the captains of thousands: Adnah the  captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of  valour;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> and next to him was Johanan the captain, and with him two  hundred and eighty thousand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:16">17:16</a> and next to him, Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly  offered himself to Jehovah; and with him two hundred thousand  mighty men of valour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:17">17:17</a> And of Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valour, and with  him two hundred thousand, armed with bow and shield;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:18">17:18</a> and next to him was Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and  eighty thousand ready prepared for war.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:19">17:19</a> These were they that waited on the king, besides those  that the king had put in the fortified cities throughout Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> And Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance; and he  allied himself with Ahab by marriage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> And after [certain] years he went down to Ahab, to Samaria.  And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for  the people that were with him, and urged him to go up against  Ramoth-Gilead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> And Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah,  Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-Gilead? And he said to him, I am  as thou, and my people as thy people; and [I will be] with thee  in the war.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray  thee, this day of the word of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> And the king of Israel assembled the prophets, four hundred  men, and said to them, Shall we go against Ramoth-Gilead to  battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, and God will  give it into the king's hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of  Jehovah besides, that we might inquire of him?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet  one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, for  he prophesies no good concerning me, but always evil: [it is]  Micah the son of Imlah. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king  say so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> Then the king of Israel called a chamberlain, and said,  Fetch quickly Micah the son of Imlah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah,  having put on their robes, sat each on his throne; and they sat  in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and  all the prophets prophesied before them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns  of iron, and he said, Thus saith Jehovah: With these shalt thou  push the Syrians, until thou have exterminated them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to  Ramoth-Gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will give it into the  king's hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> And the messenger that went to call Micah spoke to him  saying, Behold, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the  king with one assent: let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be  like one of theirs, and declare good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> And Micah said, As Jehovah liveth, even what my God shall  say, that will I declare.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> And he came to the king. And the king said to him, Micah,  shall we go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall I  forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper; and they will be  given into your hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure  thee that thou tell me nothing but truth in the name of  Jehovah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the  mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And Jehovah said,  These have no master: let them return every man to his house in  peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell  thee that he prophesies no good concerning me, but evil?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> And he said, Hear ye therefore the word of Jehovah: I saw  Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven  standing on his right hand and on his left;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> and Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel  that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead? And one spoke  saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah  and said, I will entice him. And Jehovah said unto him,  Wherewith?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit  in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt  entice [him], and also succeed: go forth, and do so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> And now, behold, Jehovah has put a lying spirit in the  mouth of these thy prophets; and Jehovah has spoken evil  concerning thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote  Micah upon the cheek, and said, Which way now went the Spirit  of Jehovah from me to speak to thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:24">18:24</a> And Micah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when  thou shalt go from chamber to chamber to hide thyself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:25">18:25</a> And the king of Israel said, Take ye Micah, and carry him  back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's  son;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:26">18:26</a> and ye shall say, Thus says the king: Put this [man] in  the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with  water of affliction, until I return in peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:27">18:27</a> And Micah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah  has not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O peoples, all of  you!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:28">18:28</a> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah  went up to Ramoth-Gilead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:29">18:29</a> And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will  disguise myself, and will enter into the battle; but put thou  on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself; and  they went into the battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:30">18:30</a> And the king of Syria commanded the captains of his  chariots saying, Fight neither with small nor great, but with  the king of Israel only.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:31">18:31</a> And it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw  Jehoshaphat, that they said, That is the king of Israel; and  they surrounded him to fight; and Jehoshaphat cried out, and  Jehovah helped him; and God diverted them from him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:32">18:32</a> And it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots  perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back  from pursuing him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:33">18:33</a> And a man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of  Israel between the fastenings and the corslet. And he said to  the charioteer, Turn thy hand and drive me out of the camp; for  I am wounded.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:34">18:34</a> And the battle increased that day; and the king of Israel  stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the  even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> And Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned to his house in  peace to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> And Jehu the son of Hanani, the seer, went out to meet him,  and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly,  and love them that hate Jehovah? Therefore is wrath upon thee  from Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> Nevertheless there are good things found in thee; for thou  hast put away the Asherahs out of the land, and hast directed  thy heart to seek God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> And Jehoshaphat dwelt in Jerusalem; and he went out again  among the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought  them back to Jehovah the God of their fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> And he set judges in the land throughout the fortified  cities of Judah, city by city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> And he said to the judges, Take heed what ye do; for ye  judge not for man, but for Jehovah, who will be with you in the  matter of judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> And now, let the terror of Jehovah be upon you; be careful  what ye do, for there is no iniquity with Jehovah, nor respect  of persons, nor taking of presents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> -- And moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set some of  the Levites and priests, and of the chief fathers of Israel,  for the judgment of Jehovah and for causes. -- And they  returned to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> And he charged them saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of  Jehovah faithfully and with a perfect heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> And what cause soever comes to you of your brethren that  dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and  commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall even warn them  that they trespass not against Jehovah, and so wrath come upon  you and upon your brethren: this do and ye shall not trespass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> And behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all  matters of Jehovah, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, prince of  the house of Judah, in all the king's matters; and ye have the  Levites before you as officers. Be strong and do it, and  Jehovah will be with the good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> And it came to pass after this [that] the children of Moab,  and the children of Ammon, and with them certain of the  Maonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> And they came and told Jehoshaphat saying, A great  multitude is come against thee from beyond the sea, from Syria;  and behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar, which is Engedi.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek Jehovah,  and proclaimed a fast throughout Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> And Judah gathered themselves together to ask [help] of  Jehovah: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and  Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, before the new court;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> and he said, Jehovah, God of our fathers, art not thou God  in the heavens, and rulest thou not over all the kingdoms of  the nations? And in thy hand there is power and might, and none  can withstand thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> Hast not thou, our God, dispossessed the inhabitants of  this land before thy people Israel, and given it for ever to  the seed of Abraham, thy friend?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> And they have dwelt therein, and have built thee a  sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> If evil come upon us, sword, judgment, or pestilence, or  famine, and we stand before this house and before thee -- for  thy name is in this house -- and cry unto thee in our distress,  then thou wilt hear and save.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab, and those  of mount Seir, amongst whom thou wouldest not let Israel go  when they came out of the land of Egypt, (for they turned from  them, and destroyed them not,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> behold, they reward us, in coming to cast us out of thy  possession, which thou hast given us to possess.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> Our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might in  presence of this great company which cometh against us, neither  know we what to do; but our eyes are upon thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> And all Judah stood before Jehovah, with their little  ones, their wives, and their sons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> And upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of  Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of  the sons of Asaph, upon him came the Spirit of Jehovah, in the  midst of the congregation;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a> and he said, Be attentive, all Judah, and ye inhabitants  of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat! Thus saith Jehovah  unto you: Fear not, nor be dismayed by reason of this great  multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a> To-morrow go down against them: behold, they come up by  the ascent of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the  valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> Ye shall not have to fight on this occasion: set  yourselves, stand and see the salvation of Jehovah [who is]  with you! Judah and Jerusalem, fear not nor be dismayed;  to-morrow go out against them, and Jehovah will be with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the  ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell  down before Jehovah, worshipping Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:19">20:19</a> And the Levites, of the sons of the Kohathites, and of the  sons of the Korahites, stood up to praise Jehovah the God of  Israel with an exceeding loud voice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:20">20:20</a> And they rose early in the morning, and went forth towards  the wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat  stood and said, Hear me, Judah, and ye inhabitants of  Jerusalem! Believe in Jehovah your God, and ye shall be  established; believe his prophets, and ye shall prosper!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:21">20:21</a> And he consulted with the people, and appointed singers to  Jehovah, and those that should praise in holy splendour, as  they went forth before the armed men, and say, Give thanks to  Jehovah; for his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:22">20:22</a> And when they began the song of triumph and praise,  Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab,  and mount Seir, who had come against Judah, and they were  smitten.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:23">20:23</a> And the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the  inhabitants of mount Seir, to exterminate and destroy [them];  and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they  helped to destroy one another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:24">20:24</a> And Judah came on to the mountain-watch in the wilderness,  and they looked toward the multitude; and behold, they were  dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none had escaped.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:25">20:25</a> And Jehoshaphat and his people came to plunder the spoil  of them, and they found among them in abundance, both riches  with the dead bodies, and precious things, and they stripped  off for themselves more than they could carry away; and they  were three days in plundering the spoil, it was so much.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:26">20:26</a> And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the  valley of Berachah, for there they blessed Jehovah; therefore  the name of that place was called The valley of Berachah, to  this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:27">20:27</a> And they returned, all the men of Judah and Jerusalem, and  Jehoshaphat at their head, to go again to Jerusalem with joy;  for Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:28">20:28</a> And they came to Jerusalem with lutes and harps and  trumpets, to the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:29">20:29</a> And the terror of God was on all the kingdoms of the  lands, when they had heard that Jehovah fought against the  enemies of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:30">20:30</a> And the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; and his God gave  him rest round about.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:31">20:31</a> And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty-five  years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five  years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Azubah, daughter  of Shilhi.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:32">20:32</a> And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and turned not  aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:33">20:33</a> Only, the high places were not removed; and as yet the  people had not directed their hearts to the God of their  fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:34">20:34</a> And the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last,  behold, they are written in the words of Jehu the son of  Hanani, which are inserted in the book of the kings of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:35">20:35</a> And after this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself  with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:36">20:36</a> And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to  Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:37">20:37</a> And Eliezer the son of Dodavah, of Mareshah, prophesied  against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself  with Ahaziah, Jehovah has broken thy works. And the ships were  broken, and could not go to Tarshish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with  his fathers in the city of David; and Jehoram his son reigned  in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> And he had brethren, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah and  Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and  Shephatiah: all these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> And their father had given them great gifts of silver and  of gold and of precious things, besides fortified cities in  Judah; but the kingdom he gave to Jehoram, for he was the  firstborn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> And Jehoram established himself over the kingdom of his  father, and strengthened himself; and he slew all his brethren  with the sword, and [certain] also of the princes of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign;  and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the  house of Ahab, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he  did evil in the sight of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> But Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, because  of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he had  promised to give to him always a lamp, and to his sons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and  they set a king over themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> And Jehoram went over with his captains, and all the  chariots with him; and he rose up by night, and smote the  Edomites who had surrounded him, and the captains of the  chariots.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> But the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah  unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time from under  his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah the God of his  fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> Moreover he made high places on the mountains of Judah,  and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication,  and compelled Judah [thereto].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet  saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father:  Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy  father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and  hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit  fornication, like the fornications of the house of Ahab, and  also hast slain thy brethren, thy father's house who were  better than thyself:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> behold, Jehovah will smite with a great stroke thy people,  and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy substance,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> and thyself with sore sicknesses, with a disease of thy  bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day  by day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> And Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the  Philistines, and of the Arabians, who [are] near the  Ethiopians;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> and they came up into Judah, and broke into it, and  carried away all the substance that was found in the king's  house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was no  son left him, except Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> And after all this, Jehovah smote him in his bowels with  an incurable sickness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> And it came to pass, from day to day, and at the time when  the second year was drawing to a close, that his bowels fell  out by reason of his sickness, and he died in cruel sufferings.  And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his  fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he  reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being  regretted. And they buried him in the city of David, but not in  the sepulchres of the kings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest  son king in his stead; for the band of men that came in the  camp with the Arabians had slain all the elder ones. And  Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign;  and he reigned one year in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was  Athaliah, daughter of Omri.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for his  mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah like the house of  Ahab; for they were his counsellors after the death of his  father, to his destruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram  the son of Ahab, king of Israel, to the war against Hazael the  king of Syria at Ramoth-Gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> And he returned to be healed in Jizreel because of the  wounds that were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael  king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah,  went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jizreel; for he was  sick.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> But his coming to Joram was from God the complete ruin of  Ahaziah. And when he had come, he went out with Jehoram against  Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off  the house of Ahab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> And it came to pass when Jehu was executing judgment upon  the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the  sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that attended upon Ahaziah,  and he slew them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> And he sought Ahaziah; and they caught him (for he had hid  himself in Samaria), and brought him to Jehu, and slew him; and  they buried him, for they said, He is a son of Jehoshaphat, who  sought Jehovah with all his heart. And in the house of Ahaziah  there was no one who was able to [hold] the kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son  was dead, she rose up and exterminated all the royal seed of  the house of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> But Jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took Joash the  son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king's sons that  were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So  Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of  Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid  him from Athaliah, so that she did not slay him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> and he was with them hid in the house of God six years.  And Athaliah reigned over the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and  took the captains of the hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham,  and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed,  and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of  Zichri, into covenant with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:2">23:2</a> And they went about in Judah and gathered together the  Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief fathers  of Israel; and they came to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in  the house of God. And he said to them, Behold, the king's son  shall reign, as Jehovah has said of the sons of David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> This is the thing which ye shall do: a third part of you  that come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites,  shall be keepers of the doors;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> and a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third  part at the gate of the foundation; and all the people shall be  in the courts of the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> But let none come into the house of Jehovah except the  priests and those of the Levites that do the service; they  shall go in, for they are holy; but all the people shall keep  the watch of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> And the Levites shall encompass the king round about, every  man with his weapons in his hand; and he that comes into the  house shall be put to death; and ye shall be with the king when  he comes in and when he goes out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> And the Levites and all Judah did according to all that  Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men,  those that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were  to go forth on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest did not  liberate the divisions.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:9">23:9</a> And Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of the  hundreds king David's spears and shields and targets, which  were in the house of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> And he set all the people, every man with his javelin in  his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of  the house, toward the altar and the house, by the king round  about.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> And they brought forth the king's son, and put the crown  upon him, and [gave him] the testimony, and made him king. And  Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, Long live the  king!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> And Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and  praising the king, and she came to the people into the house of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:13">23:13</a> And she looked, and behold, the king stood on his dais at  the entrance, and the princes and the trumpets were by the  king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with  trumpets; and the singers [were there] with the instruments of  music, and such as taught to sing praise. And Athaliah rent her  garments, and said, Conspiracy! Conspiracy!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of the  hundreds that were set over the host, and said to them, Lead  her forth without the ranks; and whosoever follows her, let him  be slain with the sword; for the priest said, Ye shall not put  her to death in the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> And they made way for her, and she went through the  entrance of the horse-gate into the king's house, and they put  her to death there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:16">23:16</a> And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the  people and the king, that they should be the people of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:17">23:17</a> And all the people went into the house of Baal, and broke  it down; and they broke his altars and his images in pieces,  and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:18">23:18</a> And Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of Jehovah  under the hand of the priests, the Levites, whom David had set  by classes over the house of Jehovah to offer up Jehovah's  burnt-offerings, as it is written in the law of Moses, -- with  rejoicing and with singing according to the directions of  David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:19">23:19</a> And he set the doorkeepers at the gates of the house of  Jehovah, that no one unclean in anything should enter in.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:20">23:20</a> And he took the captains of the hundreds, and the nobles,  and the governors of the people, and all the people of the  land, and brought down the king from the house of Jehovah; and  they came through the upper gate into the king's house, and set  the king upon the throne of the kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:21">23:21</a> And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was  quiet; and they had slain Athaliah with the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> Joash was seven years old when he began to reign; and he  reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was  Zibiah of Beer-sheba.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> And Joash did what was right in the sight of Jehovah all  the days of Jehoiada the priest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begot sons and  daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to  renew the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and  said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah and collect of all  Israel money for the repair of the house of your God from year  to year, and ye shall hasten the matter. But the Levites  hastened it not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to  him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out  of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tribute of Moses the servant  of Jehovah [laid upon] the congregation of Israel, for the tent  of the testimony?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> For the wicked Athaliah [and] her sons had devastated the  house of God; and also all the hallowed things of the house of  Jehovah had they employed for the Baals.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:8">24:8</a> And the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it  at the gate of the house of Jehovah without,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:9">24:9</a> and they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem,  to bring to Jehovah the tribute of Moses the servant of God  [laid upon] Israel in the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and  brought in and cast into the chest, until they had finished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:11">24:11</a> And it came to pass at the time the chest was brought for  the king's control by the hand of the Levites, and when they  saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and high  priest's officer came, and they emptied the chest, and took it,  and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day,  and gathered money in abundance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:12">24:12</a> And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work  of the service of the house of Jehovah, and they hired masons  and carpenters to renew the house of Jehovah, and also such as  wrought in iron and bronze, to repair the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:13">24:13</a> So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by  them, and they set the house of God in its state, and  strengthened it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:14">24:14</a> And when they had finished, they brought the rest of the  money before the king and Jehoiada; and they made of it vessels  for the house of Jehovah, utensils to minister, and with which  to offer up, and cups, and utensils of gold and silver. And  they offered up burnt-offerings in the house of Jehovah  continually all the days of Jehoiada.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:15">24:15</a> And Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died;  he was a hundred and thirty years old when he died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:16">24:16</a> And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,  because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and toward  his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:17">24:17</a> And after the death of Jehoiada the princes of Judah came  and made obeisance to the king; then the king hearkened to  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:18">24:18</a> And they forsook the house of Jehovah the God of their  fathers, and served the Asherahs and idols; and wrath came upon  Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:19">24:19</a> And he sent prophets among them to bring them again to  Jehovah, and they testified against them; but they would not  give ear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:20">24:20</a> And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of  Jehoiada the priest; and he stood up above the people and said  unto them, Thus saith God: Wherefore do ye transgress the  commandments of Jehovah? And ye cannot prosper; for ye have  forsaken Jehovah, and he hath forsaken you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:21">24:21</a> And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones  at the command of the king in the court of the house of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:22">24:22</a> And king Joash remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada  his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died,  he said, Jehovah see and require [it]!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:23">24:23</a> And it came to pass at the end of the year [that] the army  of Syria came up against him; and they entered into Judah and  Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from  among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king at  Damascus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:24">24:24</a> Truly with a small company of men came the army of the  Syrians, but Jehovah delivered a very great army into their  hand, because they had forsaken Jehovah the God of their  fathers; and they executed judgment upon Joash.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:25">24:25</a> And when they had departed from him (for they left him in  great diseases), his own servants conspired against him for the  blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his  bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but  they did not bury him in the sepulchres of the kings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:26">24:26</a> And these are they that conspired against him: Zabad the  son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of  Shimrith a Moabitess.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:27">24:27</a> And as to his sons, and the greatness of the burdens  [laid] upon him, and the building of the house of God, behold,  they are written in the treatise of the book of the kings. And  Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:1">25:1</a> Amaziah was twenty-five years old [when] he began to reign;  and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother's  name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:2">25:2</a> And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, yet not  with a perfect heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:3">25:3</a> And it came to pass when the kingdom was established unto  him, that he killed his servants who had smitten the king his  father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:4">25:4</a> But their children he did not put to death, but [did]  according to that which is written in the law in the book of  Moses, wherein Jehovah commanded saying, The fathers shall not  die for the children, nor shall the children die for the  fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:5">25:5</a> And Amaziah gathered Judah together and arranged them  according to the fathers' houses, according to the captains of  thousands and the captains of hundreds, throughout Judah and  Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and  upwards, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able  for military service, that could handle spear and target.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:6">25:6</a> He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valour out  of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:7">25:7</a> But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not  the host of Israel go with thee; for Jehovah is not with  Israel, [with] all the children of Ephraim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:8">25:8</a> But if thou wilt go, do [it]; be strong for the battle: God  will make thee fall before the enemy, for there is with God  power to help and to cast down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:9">25:9</a> And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what is to be done  for the hundred talents which I have given to the troop of  Israel? And the man of God said, Jehovah is able to give thee  much more than this.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:10">25:10</a> Then Amaziah separated them, -- the troop that was come to  him out of Ephraim, -- to go home again. And their anger was  greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce  anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:11">25:11</a> But Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his  people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the  children of Seir ten thousand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:12">25:12</a> And the children of Judah took ten thousand captive,  alive, and brought them to the top of the cliff, and cast them  down from the top of the cliff, so that they all were broken in  pieces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:13">25:13</a> But those of the troop that Amaziah had sent back, that  they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of  Judah from Samaria as far as Beth-horon, and smote three  thousand of them, and took much spoil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:14">25:14</a> And it came to pass after Amaziah was come from the  slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the  children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed  himself down before them, and burned incense to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:15">25:15</a> And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Amaziah, and  he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, Why dost thou seek  after the gods of a people who have not delivered their own  people out of thy hand?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:16">25:16</a> And it came to pass as he talked with him, that [Amaziah]  said to him, Hast thou been made the king's counsellor?  Forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet  forbore, and said, I know that God has determined to destroy  thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened to my  counsel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:17">25:17</a> And Amaziah king of Judah took counsel, and sent to Joash  the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying,  Come, let us look one another in the face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:18">25:18</a> And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,  saying, The thorn-bush that is in Lebanon sent to the cedar  that is in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son as  wife; and there passed by the wild beast that is in Lebanon,  and trode down the thorn-bush.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:19">25:19</a> Thou thinkest, Lo, thou hast smitten Edom; and thy heart  has lifted thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest  thou contend with misfortune, that thou shouldest fall, thou  and Judah with thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:20">25:20</a> But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he  might deliver them into [the enemy's] hand, because they had  sought after the gods of Edom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:21">25:21</a> And Joash king of Israel went up; and they looked one  another in the face, he and Amaziah king of Judah, at  Beth-shemesh, which is in Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:22">25:22</a> And Judah was routed before Israel; and they fled every  man to his tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:23">25:23</a> And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the  son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought  him to Jerusalem, and he broke down the wall of Jerusalem from  the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:24">25:24</a> And he [took] all the gold and the silver, and all the  vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, and  the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returned  to Samaria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:25">25:25</a> And Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived after  the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, fifteen  years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:26">25:26</a> And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last,  behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah  and Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:27">25:27</a> And from the time that Amaziah turned aside from following  Jehovah, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and  he fled to Lachish; and they sent after him to Lachish, and  slew him there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:28">25:28</a> And they brought him on horses, and buried him with his  fathers in the city of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:1">26:1</a> And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen  years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:2">26:2</a> It was he that built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after  the king slept with his fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:3">26:3</a> Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign; and he  reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was  Jecholiah of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:4">26:4</a> And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah,  according to all that his father Amaziah had done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:5">26:5</a> And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had  understanding in the visions of God; and in the days that he  sought Jehovah, God made him to prosper.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:6">26:6</a> And he went forth and fought against the Philistines, and  broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the  wall of Ashdod; and built cities about Ashdod, and among the  Philistines.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:7">26:7</a> And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the  Arabians that dwelt in Gur-Baal, and the Maonites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:8">26:8</a> And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread  abroad to the entrance of Egypt; for he became exceeding  strong.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:9">26:9</a> And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate,  and at the valley gate, and at the angle, and fortified them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:10">26:10</a> And he built towers in the desert and digged many  cisterns; for he had much cattle, both in the lowland and on  the plateau, husbandmen [also] and vinedressers on the  mountains and in Carmel; for he loved husbandry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:11">26:11</a> And Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to  war by bands, according to the number of their account by the  hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand  of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:12">26:12</a> The whole number of the chief fathers of the mighty men of  valour was two thousand six hundred.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:13">26:13</a> And under their hand was an army-host of three hundred and  seven thousand five hundred, that made war with mighty power to  help the king against the enemy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:14">26:14</a> And Uzziah prepared for them, throughout the host,  shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows,  and even slinging-stones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:15">26:15</a> And he made in Jerusalem machines invented by skilful men,  to be upon the towers and upon the bulwarks, wherewith to shoot  arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he  was marvellously helped, till he became strong.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:16">26:16</a> But when he became strong his heart was lifted up to [his]  downfall; and he transgressed against Jehovah his God, and went  into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of  incense.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:17">26:17</a> And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him  priests of Jehovah, eighty valiant men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:18">26:18</a> and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, It is  not for thee, Uzziah, to burn incense to Jehovah, but for the  priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn  incense. Go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast transgressed;  neither shall it be for thine honour from Jehovah Elohim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:19">26:19</a> And Uzziah was wroth; and he had a censer in his hand to  burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the  leprosy rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house  of Jehovah, beside the incense altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:20">26:20</a> And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked  upon him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they  thrust him out from thence; even he himself hasted to go out,  because Jehovah had smitten him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:21">26:21</a> And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death,  and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut  off from the house of Jehovah. And Jotham his son was over the  king's house, judging the people of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:22">26:22</a> And the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did  the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz write.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:23">26:23</a> And Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him  with his fathers in the burial-ground of the kings, for they  said, He is a leper. And Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:1">27:1</a> Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign;  and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and his mother's  name was Jerushah, daughter of Zadok.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:2">27:2</a> And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah,  according to all that his father Uzziah had done; only he  entered not into the temple of Jehovah. And the people still  acted corruptly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:3">27:3</a> It was he who built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah,  and on the wall of Ophel he built much.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:4">27:4</a> And he built cities in the hill-country of Judah, and in  the forests he built castles and towers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:5">27:5</a> And he fought against the king of the children of Ammon,  and overcame them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same  year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of  wheat, and ten thousand of barley. This the children of Ammon  brought again to him also in the second year, and in the third.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:6">27:6</a> And Jotham became strong, for he prepared his ways before  Jehovah his God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:7">27:7</a> And the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and  his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of  Israel and Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:8">27:8</a> He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he  reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:9">27:9</a> And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in  the city of David; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:1">28:1</a> Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he  reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not what was  right in the sight of Jehovah, like David his father,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:2">28:2</a> but walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and even  made molten images for the Baals;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:3">28:3</a> and he burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom,  and burned his sons in the fire, according to the abominations  of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from before the  children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:4">28:4</a> And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places,  and on the hills, and under every green tree.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:5">28:5</a> Therefore Jehovah his God gave him into the hand of the  king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great  multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And  he was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who  smote him with a great slaughter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:6">28:6</a> And Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and  twenty thousand in one day, all valiant men, because they had  forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:7">28:7</a> And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the  king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah  the second to the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:8">28:8</a> And the children of Israel carried away captive of their  brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and  took away also much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to  Samaria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:9">28:9</a> But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded;  and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said  unto them, Behold, because Jehovah the God of your fathers was  wroth with Judah, he gave them into your hand, and ye have  slain them in a rage that reaches up to heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:10">28:10</a> And now ye think to subjugate the children of Judah and  Jerusalem as your bondmen and bondwomen. Are there not with  you, even with you, trespasses against Jehovah your God?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:11">28:11</a> And now hear me, and send back the captives again, whom ye  have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of  Jehovah is upon you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:12">28:12</a> And certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim,  Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth,  and Hezekiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai,  stood up against them that came from the war,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:13">28:13</a> and said to them, Ye shall not bring in the captives  hither; because, for our guilt before Jehovah, ye think to  increase our sins and our trespasses: for our trespass is  great, and fierce wrath is upon Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:14">28:14</a> Then the armed men left the captives and the spoil before  the princes and all the congregation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:15">28:15</a> And the men that have been expressed by name rose up, and  took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were  naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave  them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all  the feeble of them on asses, and brought them to Jericho the  city of palm-trees, to their brethren. And they returned to  Samaria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:16">28:16</a> At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to  help him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:17">28:17</a> And again the Edomites came and smote Judah, and carried  away captives.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:18">28:18</a> And the Philistines invaded the cities of the lowland, and  of the south of Judah, and took Beth-shemesh, and Ajalon, and  Gederoth, and Socho and its dependent villages, and Timnah and  its dependent villages, and Guimzo and its dependent villages;  and they dwelt there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:19">28:19</a> For Jehovah humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel,  for he had made Judah lawless, and transgressed much against  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:20">28:20</a> And Tilgath-Pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and  troubled him, and did not support him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:21">28:21</a> For Ahaz stripped the house of Jehovah, and the house of  the king and of the princes, and gave to the king of Assyria;  but he was of no help to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:22">28:22</a> And in the time of his trouble he transgressed yet more  against Jehovah, this king Ahaz.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:23">28:23</a> And he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which had  smitten him; and he said, Since the gods of the kings of Syria  help them, I will sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But  they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:24">28:24</a> And Ahaz gathered the vessels of the house of God, and cut  in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and closed the doors  of the house of Jehovah, and he made for himself altars in  every corner of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:25">28:25</a> And in every several city of Judah he made high places to  burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah the  God of his fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:26">28:26</a> And the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and  last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of  Judah and Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:27">28:27</a> And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in  the city, in Jerusalem; but they brought him not into the  sepulchres of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned  in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:1">29:1</a> Hezekiah began to reign being twenty-five years old; and he  reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name  was Abijah, daughter of Zechariah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:2">29:2</a> And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah,  according to all that David his father had done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:3">29:3</a> He, in the first year of his reign, in the first month,  opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:4">29:4</a> And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered  them into the open place eastward;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:5">29:5</a> and he said to them, Hear me, ye Levites: hallow yourselves  now, and hallow the house of Jehovah the God of your fathers,  and carry forth the filthiness out of the sanctuary.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:6">29:6</a> For our fathers have transgressed, and done evil in the  sight of Jehovah our God, and have forsaken him and turned away  their faces from the habitation of Jehovah, and have turned  their backs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:7">29:7</a> Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out  the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered up  burnt-offerings in the sanctuary to the God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:8">29:8</a> Therefore the wrath of Jehovah has been upon Judah and  Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to vexation, to  desolation, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:9">29:9</a> And behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our  sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:10">29:10</a> Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah the  God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:11">29:11</a> My sons, be not now negligent; for Jehovah has chosen you  to stand before him, to do service unto him, and to be his  ministers and incense-burners.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:12">29:12</a> Then the Levites rose up, Mahath the son of Amasai, and  Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of  the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son  of Jehalleleel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah,  and Eden the son of Joah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:13">29:13</a> and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; and of the  sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:14">29:14</a> and of the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and of the  sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:15">29:15</a> And they gathered their brethren, and hallowed themselves,  and came, according to the commandment of the king by the words  of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:16">29:16</a> And the priests went into the inner part of the house of  Jehovah to cleanse it, and carried forth all the uncleanness  that they found in the temple of Jehovah, into the court of the  house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it to carry it forth  into the brook Kidron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:17">29:17</a> And they began on the first of the first month to hallow,  and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of  Jehovah; and they hallowed the house of Jehovah eight days; and  on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:18">29:18</a> And they went in to king Hezekiah, and said, We have  cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of  burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the table of the  [bread] to be set in rows, and all its vessels;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:19">29:19</a> and all the vessels that king Ahaz in his reign cast away  in his transgression have we prepared and hallowed, and behold,  they are before the altar of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:20">29:20</a> And Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the  princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:21">29:21</a> And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven  lambs, and seven he-goats for a sin-offering for the kingdom,  and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the  priests the sons of Aaron to offer [them] upon the altar of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:22">29:22</a> And they slaughtered the bullocks, and the priests  received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar; and they  slaughtered the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar; and  they slaughtered the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the  altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:23">29:23</a> And they brought near the he-goats of the sin-offering  before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands  upon them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:24">29:24</a> And the priests slaughtered them, and they made  purification for sin with their blood upon the altar, to make  an atonement for all Israel; because for all Israel, said the  king, is the burnt-offering and the sin-offering.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:25">29:25</a> And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with  cymbals, with lutes, and with harps, according to the  commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan  the prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah through his  prophets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:26">29:26</a> And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and  the priests with the trumpets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:27">29:27</a> And Hezekiah commanded to offer up the burnt-offering on  the altar. And at the moment the burnt-offering began, the song  of Jehovah began, and the trumpets, accompanied by the  instruments of David king of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:28">29:28</a> And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang,  and the trumpeters sounded, all [the time] until the  burnt-offering was finished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:29">29:29</a> And when they had ended offering the burnt-offering, the  king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and  worshipped.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:30">29:30</a> And king Hezekiah and the princes commanded the Levites to  sing praise to Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph  the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and bowed their  heads and worshipped.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:31">29:31</a> And Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated  yourselves to Jehovah, come near and bring sacrifices and  thank-offerings into the house of the Lord. And the  congregation brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as  many as were of a willing heart, burnt-offerings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:32">29:32</a> And the number of the burnt-offerings, which the  congregation brought, was seventy bullocks, a hundred rams, two  hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:33">29:33</a> And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three  thousand sheep.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:34">29:34</a> Only the priests were too few, and they could not flay all  the burnt-offerings; therefore their brethren the Levites  helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests  had hallowed themselves; for the Levites were more upright in  heart to hallow themselves than the priests.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:35">29:35</a> And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the  fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for  the burnt-offering. And the service of the house of Jehovah was  set in order.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:36">29:36</a> And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had  prepared the people; for the thing was done suddenly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:1">30:1</a> And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote  letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to  the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to hold the passover to  Jehovah the God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:2">30:2</a> And the king took counsel, and his princes, and the whole  congregation in Jerusalem, to hold the passover in the second  month.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:3">30:3</a> For they could not keep it at that time, because the  priests had not hallowed themselves in sufficient number,  neither had the people been gathered together to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:4">30:4</a> And the thing pleased the king and the whole congregation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:5">30:5</a> So they established a decree to make proclamation  throughout Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should  come to hold the passover to Jehovah the God of Israel, at  Jerusalem; because they had not held it for a long time as it  was written.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:6">30:6</a> And the couriers went with the letters from the king and  his princes throughout Israel and Judah, and according to the  commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, return  to Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will  return to the remnant of you that are escaped out of the hand  of the kings of Assyria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:7">30:7</a> And be not like your fathers and like your brethren, who  transgressed against Jehovah the God of their fathers, so that  he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:8">30:8</a> Now, harden not your necks, as your fathers; yield  yourselves to Jehovah, and come to his sanctuary, which he has  sanctified for ever; and serve Jehovah your God, that the  fierceness of his anger may turn away from you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:9">30:9</a> For if ye return to Jehovah, your brethren and your  children shall find compassion with those that have carried  them captive, so that they shall come again unto this land; for  Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn  away his face from you, if ye return to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:10">30:10</a> And the couriers passed from city to city through the  country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun; but they  laughed them to scorn and mocked them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:11">30:11</a> Nevertheless certain of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun  humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:12">30:12</a> The hand of God was also upon Judah to give them one heart  to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the  word of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:13">30:13</a> And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to hold the  feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great  congregation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:14">30:14</a> And they rose up and took away the altars that were in  Jerusalem; and they took away all the incense-altars, and cast  them into the torrent Kidron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:15">30:15</a> And they slaughtered the passover on the fourteenth of the  second month; and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and  hallowed themselves; and they brought the burnt-offerings into  the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:16">30:16</a> And they stood in their place after their custom,  according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests  sprinkled the blood [receiving it] from the hand of the  Levites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:17">30:17</a> For there were many in the congregation that were not  hallowed; therefore the Levites had the charge of the  slaughtering of the passover-lambs for every one not clean, to  hallow them unto Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:18">30:18</a> For a multitude of the people, many of Ephraim and  Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves,  and they ate the passover otherwise than it was written. But  Hezekiah prayed for them saying, Jehovah, who is good, forgive  every one</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:19">30:19</a> that has directed his heart to seek God, Jehovah the God  of his fathers, although not according to the purification of  the sanctuary.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:20">30:20</a> And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:21">30:21</a> And the children of Israel, that were present at  Jerusalem, held the feast of unleavened bread seven days with  great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah  day by day, with the instruments of praise to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:22">30:22</a> And Hezekiah spoke consolingly to all the Levites that had  understanding in the good knowledge of Jehovah; and they ate  the feast-offerings the seven days, sacrificing  peace-offerings, and extolling Jehovah the God of their  fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:23">30:23</a> And the whole congregation took counsel to observe other  seven days; and they observed the seven days with gladness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:24">30:24</a> For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the congregation as  heave-offering: a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep;  and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks  and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests hallowed  themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:25">30:25</a> And the whole congregation of Judah, with the priests and  the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel,  and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that  dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:26">30:26</a> And there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time  of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there had not been  the like in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:27">30:27</a> And the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people;  and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy  habitation, to the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> And when all this was finished, all Israel that were  present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the columns,  and hewed down the Asherahs, and demolished the high places and  the altars in all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and  Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. And all the  children of Israel returned every man to his possession, into  their cities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:2">31:2</a> And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests, and  the Levites after their divisions, every man according to his  service, as well the priests as the Levites, for  burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to serve and to give  thanks and to praise in the gates of the courts of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:3">31:3</a> And [he ordered] that the king's portion [should be taken]  from his substance for the burnt-offerings: for the morning and  evening burnt-offerings, for the burnt-offerings of the  sabbaths, and of the new moons, and of the set feasts, as it is  written in the law of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:4">31:4</a> And he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give  the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be  encouraged in the law of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> And as soon as the commandment was published, the children  of Israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of corn, new wine  and oil and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and  they brought in abundantly the tithe of all [things].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:6">31:6</a> And the children of Israel and of Judah, that dwelt in the  cities of Judah, they also brought the tithe of oxen and sheep,  and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to Jehovah  their God, and laid them by heaps.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:7">31:7</a> In the third month they began to lay the heaps, and  finished them in the seventh month.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:8">31:8</a> And Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, and  they blessed Jehovah, and his people Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:9">31:9</a> And Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites  concerning the heaps.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:10">31:10</a> And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok spoke  to him and said, Since they began to bring the heave-offerings  into the house of Jehovah, we have eaten and been satisfied and  have left plenty; for Jehovah has blessed his people; and what  is left is this great store.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:11">31:11</a> And Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of  Jehovah; and they prepared [them],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:12">31:12</a> and brought in the heave-offerings and the tithes and the  dedicated things faithfully; and over these Cononiah the Levite  was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:13">31:13</a> And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and  Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Jismachiah, and Mahath,  and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and  Shimei his brother, at the command of Hezekiah the king and  Azariah the ruler of the house of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:14">31:14</a> And Kore the son of Jimnah the Levite, the doorkeeper  toward the east, was over the voluntary-offerings of God, to  distribute the heave-offerings of Jehovah, and the most holy  things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:15">31:15</a> And under him were Eden and Miniamin and Jeshua and  Shemaiah, Amariah and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests,  in [their] set trust, to make distributions to their brethren  by [their] divisions, to the great as to the small,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:16">31:16</a> besides those from three years old and upward who as males  were entered in the genealogical register, -- all that came  into the house of Jehovah, as the duty of every day required,  for their service in their charges, according to their  divisions,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:17">31:17</a> -- both to the priests enregistered according to their  fathers' houses, and to the Levites from twenty years old and  upward, in their charges, by their divisions;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:18">31:18</a> and to all their little ones, their wives, and their sons,  and their daughters, the whole congregation of those entered in  the register; for in their trust they hallowed themselves to be  holy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:19">31:19</a> And for the sons of Aaron the priests who were in the  country, in the suburbs of their cities, there were, in every  several city, men expressed by name, to give portions to all  the males among the priests, and to all the Levites that were  entered in the register.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:20">31:20</a> And thus did Hezekiah throughout Judah, and wrought what  was good and right and true before Jehovah his God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:21">31:21</a> And in every work that he undertook in the service of the  house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek  his God, he did it with all his heart and prospered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:1">32:1</a> After these things and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king  of Assyria came and entered into Judah, and encamped against  the fortified cities, and thought to break into them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:2">32:2</a> And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that  he was minded to fight against Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:3">32:3</a> he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop  the fountains of waters that were outside the city; and they  helped him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:4">32:4</a> And there was gathered together much people, and they  stopped all the fountains, and the torrent that flows through  the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria  come and find much water?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:5">32:5</a> And he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that  was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and [built]  another wall outside, and fortified the Millo of the city of  David, and made darts and shields in abundance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:6">32:6</a> And he set captains of war over the people, and assembled  them to him on the open place at the gate of the city, and  spoke consolingly to them saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:7">32:7</a> Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for  the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with  him; for there are more with us than with him:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:8">32:8</a> with him is an arm of flesh, but with us is Jehovah our God  to help us and to fight our battles. And the people depended  upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:9">32:9</a> After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants  to Jerusalem (but he himself was before Lachish, and all his  power with him), unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all  Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:10">32:10</a> Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: On what do ye rely  that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:11">32:11</a> Does not Hezekiah persuade you, to give yourselves over to  die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will  deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> Has not the same Hezekiah removed his high places and his  altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem saying, Ye shall  worship before *one* altar, and burn incense upon it?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> Do ye not know what I and my fathers have done to all the  peoples of the countries? Were the gods of the nations of the  countries in any wise able to deliver their country out of my  hand?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:14">32:14</a> Who is there among all the gods of those nations that my  fathers have utterly destroyed, that was able to deliver his  people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver  you out of my hand?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:15">32:15</a> And now, let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in  this manner, neither yet believe him; for no +god of any nation  or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, nor  out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God  deliver you out of my hand?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> And his servants spoke yet more against Jehovah, the  [true] God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:17">32:17</a> And he wrote a letter to rail at Jehovah the God of  Israel, and to speak against him saying, As the gods of the  nations of the countries have not delivered their people out of  my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people  out of my hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> And they cried with a loud voice in the Jewish [language]  to the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to frighten  them and to trouble them; that they might take the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of  the peoples of the earth, the work of man's hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> And because of this, king Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah  the son of Amoz prayed and cried to heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> And Jehovah sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men  of valour, and the princes and the captains in the camp of the  king of Assyria. And he returned with shame of face to his own  land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that  came forth of his own bowels made him fall there with the  sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> And Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of  Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and  from the hand of all, and protected them on every side.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:23">32:23</a> And many brought gifts unto Jehovah to Jerusalem, and  precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; and he was  thenceforth magnified in the sight of all the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:24">32:24</a> In those days Hezekiah was sick unto death, and he prayed  to Jehovah; and he spoke to him and gave him a sign.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit  [done] to him, for his heart was lifted up; and there was wrath  upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:26">32:26</a> And Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart,  he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of  Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:27">32:27</a> And Hezekiah had very much riches and honour; and he made  himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious  stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of  pleasant vessels;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> storehouses also for the increase of corn and new wine and  oil, and stalls for all manner of beasts, and [he procured]  flocks for the stalls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:29">32:29</a> And he provided for himself cities, and possessions of  flocks and herds in abundance; for God gave him very much  substance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:30">32:30</a> And he, Hezekiah, stopped the upper outlet of the waters  of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the  city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> However in [the matter of] the ambassadors of the princes  of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was  done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know  all [that was] in his heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:32">32:32</a> And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds,  behold, they are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah  the son of Amoz in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:33">32:33</a> And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him  in the highest place of the sepulchres of the sons of David;  and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour  at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and  he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, like the  abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from  before the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> And he built again the high places that Hezekiah his father  had broken down; and he reared up altars to the Baals, and made  Asherahs, and worshipped all the host of heaven and served  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, of which  Jehovah had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:5">33:5</a> And he built altars to all the host of heaven in both  courts of the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:6">33:6</a> He also caused his children to pass through the fire in the  valley of the son of Hinnom; and he used magic and divination  and sorcery, and appointed necromancers and soothsayers: he  wrought evil beyond measure in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke  him to anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:7">33:7</a> And he set the graven image of the idol that he had made,  in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to  Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have  chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for  ever;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:8">33:8</a> neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out  of the land that I have appointed to your fathers; if they will  only take heed to do all that I commanded them through Moses,  according to all the law and the statutes and the ordinances.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a> And Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem  astray, to do more evil than the nations that Jehovah had  destroyed from before the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:10">33:10</a> And Jehovah spoke to Manasseh and to his people; but they  did not hearken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:11">33:11</a> And Jehovah brought upon them the captains of the host of  the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh with fetters, and bound  him with chains of brass, and carried him to Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:12">33:12</a> And when he was in affliction, he besought Jehovah his  God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:13">33:13</a> and prayed to him. And he was intreated of him and heard  his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his  kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah, he was God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:14">33:14</a> And after this he built the outer wall of the city of  David, on the west, toward Gihon, in the valley, even to the  entrance of the fish-gate, and carried it round Ophel, and  raised it up a very great height; and he put captains of war in  all the fortified cities of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:15">33:15</a> And he removed the strange gods, and the idol out of the  house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built on the  mount of the house of Jehovah and in Jerusalem, and cast [them]  out of the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a> And he reinstated the altar of Jehovah, and sacrificed on  it peace-offerings and thank-offerings, and commanded Judah to  serve Jehovah the God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:17">33:17</a> Nevertheless, the people sacrificed still on the high  places, although to Jehovah their God only.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:18">33:18</a> And the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to  his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the  name of Jehovah the God of Israel, behold, they [are written]  in the acts of the kings of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:19">33:19</a> And his prayer, and [how God] was intreated of him, and  all his sin and his unfaithfulness, and the places in which he  built high places, and set up Asherahs and graven images,  before he was humbled, behold, they are written among the words  of Hozai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:20">33:20</a> And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him  in his own house; and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:21">33:21</a> Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and  he reigned two years in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:22">33:22</a> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, as Manasseh his  father had done; and Amon sacrificed to all the graven images  that Manasseh his father had made, and served them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:23">33:23</a> And he did not humble himself before Jehovah, as Manasseh  his father had humbled himself; for he, Amon, multiplied  trespass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:24">33:24</a> And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in  his own house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:25">33:25</a> But the people of the land smote all them that had  conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made  Josiah his son king in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:1">34:1</a> Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he  reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:2">34:2</a> And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, and  walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to  the right hand nor to the left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:3">34:3</a> And in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet  young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and  in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from  the high places, and the Asherahs, and the graven images, and  the molten images.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:4">34:4</a> And they broke down the altars of the Baals in his  presence; and the sun-pillars that were on high above them he  cut down; and the Asherahs and the graven images and the molten  images he broke in pieces, and made dust [of them] and strewed  it upon the graves of those that had sacrificed to them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:5">34:5</a> and he burned the bones of the priests upon their altars,  and purged Judah and Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:6">34:6</a> And [so did he] in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and  Simeon, even to Naphtali, in their ruins round about;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:7">34:7</a> and he broke down the altars, and beat the Asherahs and the  graven images into powder, and cut down all the sun-pillars  throughout the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:8">34:8</a> And in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he purged the  land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and  Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz  the chronicler, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:9">34:9</a> And they came to Hilkijah the high priest, and they  delivered [to them] the money that had been brought into the  house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had  gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the  remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the  inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:10">34:10</a> And they gave [it] into the hand of them that did the  work, that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and they  gave it to the workmen who wrought in the house of Jehovah to  reinstate and repair the house:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:11">34:11</a> they gave [it] to the carpenters and the builders, to buy  hewn stone, and timber for the joists, and to floor the houses  that the kings of Judah had destroyed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:12">34:12</a> And the men did the work faithfully. And over them were  appointed Jahath and Obadiah, Levites, of the children of  Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the children of the  Kohathites, for the oversight; and all these Levites were  skilled in instruments of music.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:13">34:13</a> They were also over the bearers of burdens, and were  overseers of all that worked in any manner of service. And of  the Levites were the scribes, and officers, and doorkeepers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:14">34:14</a> And when they brought out the money that had been brought  into the house of Jehovah, Hilkijah the priest found the book  of the law of Jehovah by Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:15">34:15</a> Then Hilkijah spoke and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have  found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkijah  gave the book to Shaphan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:16">34:16</a> And Shaphan carried the book to the king. And moreover he  brought the king word again saying, All that was committed to  the hand of thy servants, they do;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:17">34:17</a> and they have emptied out the money that was found in the  house of Jehovah, and have delivered it into the hand of the  overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:18">34:18</a> And Shaphan the scribe informed the king saying, Hilkijah  the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read out of it  before the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:19">34:19</a> And it came to pass when the king heard the words of the  law, that he rent his garments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:20">34:20</a> And the king commanded Hilkijah, and Ahikam the son of  Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe,  and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:21">34:21</a> Go, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for them that are left  in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book which  is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out  upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah,  to do according to all that is written in this book.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:22">34:22</a> And Hilkijah and they that the king [had appointed] went  to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of  Tokehath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe: now she dwelt  in Jerusalem in the second quarter [of the town]; and they  spoke with her to that effect.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:23">34:23</a> And she said to them, Thus saith Jehovah the God of  Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:24">34:24</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will bring evil upon this  place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, all the curses that  are written in the book which they have read before the king of  Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:25">34:25</a> Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense  unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all  the works of their hands; therefore my fury shall be poured out  upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:26">34:26</a> But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of  Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him: Thus saith Jehovah the God  of Israel touching the words which thou hast heard:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:27">34:27</a> Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble  thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this  place and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst  thyself before me, and didst rend thy garments and weep before  me, I also have heard [thee], saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:28">34:28</a> Behold, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou  shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall  not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and  upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought the king word  again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:29">34:29</a> And the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and  of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:30">34:30</a> And the king went up into the house of Jehovah, and all  the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the  priests and the Levites, and all the people, great and small;  and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the  covenant which had been found in the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:31">34:31</a> And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant  before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his  commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his  heart and with all his soul, to perform the words of the  covenant that are written in this book.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:32">34:32</a> And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and  Benjamin to stand [to it]. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did  according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:33">34:33</a> And Josiah removed all the abominations out of all the  countries that belonged to the children of Israel, and made to  serve all that were found in Israel, -- to serve Jehovah their  God: all his days they did not depart from following Jehovah,  the God of their fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:1">35:1</a> And Josiah held a passover to Jehovah in Jerusalem; and  they slaughtered the passover on the fourteenth of the first  month.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:2">35:2</a> And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged  them to the service of the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:3">35:3</a> And he said to the Levites, that taught all Israel, [and]  who were holy to Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the house that  Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built; ye have not to  carry it upon your shoulders. Serve now Jehovah your God, and  his people Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:4">35:4</a> and prepare yourselves by your fathers' houses, in your  divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel,  and according to the writing of Solomon his son;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:5">35:5</a> and stand in the sanctuary for the classes of the fathers'  houses, for your brethren, the children of the people, and  [according] to the divisions of the fathers' houses of the  Levites;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:6">35:6</a> and slaughter the passover, and hallow yourselves, and  prepare it for your brethren, that they may do according to the  word of Jehovah through Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:7">35:7</a> And Josiah gave for the children of the people a  heave-offering of the flocks, lambs and goats, all for the  passover-offerings, for all that were present -- to the number  of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of  the king's substance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:8">35:8</a> And his princes gave a voluntary heave-offering for the  people, for the priests, and for the Levites: Hilkijah and  Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the  priests for the passover-offerings two thousand six hundred  [small cattle] and three hundred oxen;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:9">35:9</a> and Conaniah, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and  Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave as  heave-offering to the Levites for the passover-offerings five  thousand [small cattle] and five hundred oxen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:10">35:10</a> And the service was prepared, and the priests stood in  their place, and the Levites in their divisions, according to  the king's commandment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:11">35:11</a> And they slaughtered the passover, and the priests  sprinkled [the blood] from their hand, and the Levites flayed  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:12">35:12</a> And they set apart the burnt-offerings to give them to the  classes of the fathers' houses of the children of the people,  to present them to Jehovah, as it is written in the book of  Moses. And so [did they] with the oxen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:13">35:13</a> And they roasted the passover with fire according to the  ordinance; and the consecrated things they boiled in pots and  in cauldrons and in pans, and divided them speedily among all  the children of the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:14">35:14</a> And afterwards they made ready for themselves and for the  priests; because the priests, the sons of Aaron, [were engaged]  in offering up the burnt-offerings and the fat until night;  therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the  priests, the sons of Aaron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:15">35:15</a> And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place,  according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman,  and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the doorkeepers were at every  gate; they had not to depart from their service, for their  brethren the Levites prepared for them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:16">35:16</a> And all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day,  to hold the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings on the altar  of Jehovah according to the commandment of king Josiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:17">35:17</a> And the children of Israel that were present held the  passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven  days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:18">35:18</a> And there was no passover like to that holden in Israel  from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings  of Israel hold such a passover as Josiah held, and the priests,  and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present,  and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:19">35:19</a> In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this  passover holden.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:20">35:20</a> After all this, when Josiah had arranged the house, Necho  king of Egypt came up to fight against Karkemish at the  Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:21">35:21</a> And he sent messengers to him, saying, What have I to do  with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this  day, but against the house with which I have war; and God has  told me to make haste: keep aloof from God who is with me, that  he destroy thee not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:22">35:22</a> But Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised  himself, that he might fight against him; and he hearkened not  to the words of Necho from the mouth of God; and he came to  fight in the valley of Megiddo.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:23">35:23</a> And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to  his servants, Have me away, for I am sore wounded.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:24">35:24</a> And his servants took him out from the chariot, and put  him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to  Jerusalem. And he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his  fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:25">35:25</a> And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah; and all the singing men  and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this  day; and they made them an ordinance for Israel. And behold,  they are written in the lamentations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:26">35:26</a> And the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds,  according to that which is written in the law of Jehovah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:27">35:27</a> and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in  the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:1">36:1</a> And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah,  and made him king in his father's stead, in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:2">36:2</a> Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign;  and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:3">36:3</a> And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and  imposed a fine upon the land of a hundred talents of silver and  a talent of gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:4">36:4</a> And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over  Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And  Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:5">36:5</a> Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign;  and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and he did evil in  the sight of Jehovah his God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:6">36:6</a> Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and  bound him with chains of brass to carry him to Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:7">36:7</a> And Nebuchadnezzar carried [part] of the vessels of the  house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at  Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:8">36:8</a> And the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations  which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are  written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And  Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:9">36:9</a> Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign;  and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and he  did evil in the sight of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:10">36:10</a> And at the turn of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent and  had him brought to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the  house of Jehovah; and he made Zedekiah his brother king over  Judah and Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:11">36:11</a> Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign;  and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:12">36:12</a> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah his God; he  humbled not himself before the prophet Jeremiah speaking from  the mouth of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:13">36:13</a> And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had  made him take oath by God; and he stiffened his neck, and  hardened his heart from returning to Jehovah the God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:14">36:14</a> All the chiefs of the priests also, and the people,  increased their transgressions, according to all the  abominations of the nations; and they defiled the house of  Jehovah which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:15">36:15</a> And Jehovah the God of their fathers sent to them by his  messengers, rising up early and sending; because he had  compassion on his people and on his dwelling-place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:16">36:16</a> But they mocked at the messengers of God, and despised his  words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the fury of Jehovah  rose against his people, and there was no remedy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:17">36:17</a> And he brought up [against] them the king of the Chaldees,  and slew their young men with the sword in the house of their  sanctuary, and spared not young man nor maiden, old man nor him  of hoary head: he gave [them] all into his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:18">36:18</a> And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small,  and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of  the king and of his princes, he brought all to Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:19">36:19</a> And they burned the house of God, and broke down the wall  of Jerusalem, and burned all the palaces thereof with fire, and  all the precious vessels thereof were given up to destruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:20">36:20</a> And them that had escaped from the sword he carried away  to Babylon; and they became servants to him and his sons, until  the reign of the kingdom of Persia;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:21">36:21</a> to fulfil the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah,  until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths. All the days of its  desolation it kept sabbath, to fulfil seventy years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:22">36:22</a> And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the  word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished,  Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he  made a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also in  writing, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:23">36:23</a> Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the  earth has Jehovah the God of the heavens given to me, and he  has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in  Judah. Whosoever there is among you of all his people, Jehovah  his God be with him, and let him go up.</p>
