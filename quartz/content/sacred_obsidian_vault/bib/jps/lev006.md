 <p><a name="an_lev:6:1">1</a> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <a name="an_lev:6:2">2</a> Command Aaron and his sons, saying:</p>  
 <p>This is the law of the burnt-offering: it is that which goeth up on its firewood upon the altar all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereby. <a name="an_lev:6:3">3</a> And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. <a name="an_lev:6:4">4</a> And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. <a name="an_lev:6:5">5</a> And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby, it shall not go out; and the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning; and he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it, and shall make smoke thereon the fat of the peace-offerings. <a name="an_lev:6:6">6</a> Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:6:7">7</a> And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, in front of the altar. <a name="an_lev:6:8">8</a> And he shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering, and shall make the memorial-part thereof smoke upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD. <a name="an_lev:6:9">9</a> And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat; it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it. <a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 124</font></a> <a name="an_lev:6:10">10</a> It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of My offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the guilt-offering. <a name="an_lev:6:11">11</a> Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as a due for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of the LORD made by fire; whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:6:12">12</a> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <a name="an_lev:6:13">13</a> This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening. <a name="an_lev:6:14">14</a> On a griddle it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, thou shalt bring it in; in broken pieces shalt thou offer the meal-offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD. <a name="an_lev:6:15">15</a> And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it, it is a due for ever; it shall be wholly made to smoke unto the LORD. <a name="an_lev:6:16">16</a> And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:6:17">17</a> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <a name="an_lev:6:18">18</a> Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying:</p>  
 <p>This is the law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before the LORD; it is most holy. <a name="an_lev:6:19">19</a> The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it; in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting. <a name="an_lev:6:20">20</a> Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place. <a name="an_lev:6:21">21</a> But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden I shall be broken; and if it be sodden in a brazen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water. <a name="an_lev:6:22">22</a> Every male among the priests may eat thereof; it is most holy. <a name="an_lev:6:23">23</a> And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire.</p>
