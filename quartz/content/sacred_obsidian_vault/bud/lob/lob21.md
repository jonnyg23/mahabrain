 <p>THE light emanating from the hero's body reached even to those realms where Mara, the Evil One, reigned supreme. It dazzled Mara, and he seemed to hear a voice saying:</p>  
 <p>"The hero who has renounced royalty, the son of Suddhodana, is now seated under the tree of knowledge. He is concentrating his mind, he is making the supreme effort, and soon he will bring to all creatures the help which they need. The road he will have taken, others will take. Once set free, he will set others free. Once he has found peace, he will bring peace to others. He will enter nirvana, and he will cause others to enter. He will find wisdom and happiness, and he will give them to others. Because of him, the city of the Gods will be crowded; because of him, the city of the Evil One will be deserted. And you, Mara, a commander without an army, a king without subjects, will not know where to take refuge."</p>  
 <p>Mara was filled with apprehension. He tried to sleep, but his slumber was disturbed by terrible dreams. He awoke and summoned his servants and his soldiers. When they saw him, they became</p>  
 <p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="green">p. 90</font></a></p>  
 <p>alarmed, and Sarthavaha, one of his sons, said to him:</p>  
 <p>"Father, you look pale and unhappy; your heart beats fast and your limbs tremble. What have you heard? What have you seen? Speak."</p>  
 <p>"Son," replied Mara, "the days of my pride are over. I heard a voice crying in the light, and it told me that the son of the Sakyas was seated under the tree of knowledge. And I had horrible dreams. A black cloud of dust settled over my palace. My gardens were bare of leaves, of flowers and of fruit. My ponds had dried up, and my swans and peacocks had their wings clipped. And I felt alone, amid this desolation. You had all deserted me. My queen was beating her breast and tearing her hair, as though haunted by remorse. My daughters were crying out in their anguish, and you, my son, were bowing before this man who meditated under the tree of knowledge! I wanted to fight my enemy, but I could not draw my sword from the scabbard. All my subjects fled in horror. Impenetrable darkness closed in upon me, and I heard my palace crashing to the ground."</p>  
 <p>Sarthavaha said:</p>  
 <p>"Father, it is disheartening to lose a battle. If you have seen these omens, bide your time, and do not run the chance of being ingloriously defeated."</p>  
 <p>But Mara, at the sight of the legions that surrounded</p>  
 <p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></a></p>  
 <p>him, felt his courage return. He said to his son:</p>  
 <p>"To the man of energy, a battle can end only in victory. We are brave; we will surely win. What strength can this man have? He is alone. I shall advance against him with a vast army, and I shall strike him down at the foot of the tree."</p>  
 <p>"Mere numbers do not make the strength of an army," said Sarthavaha, "The sun can outshine a myriad of glowworms. If wisdom is the source of his power, a single hero can defeat countless soldiers."</p>  
 <p>But Mara paid no heed. He ordered the army to advance at once, and Sarthavaha thought:</p>  
 <p>"He who is insane with pride will never recover."</p>  
 <p>Mara's army was a fearful sight. It bristled with pikes, with arrows and with swords; many carried enormous battle-axes and heavy clubs. The soldiers were black, blue, yellow, red, and their faces were terrifying. Their eyes were cruel flames; their mouths spewed blood. Some had the ears of a goat, others the ears of a pig or of an elephant. Many had bodies shaped like a jug. One had the paws of a tiger, the hump of a camel and the head of a donkey; another had a lion's mane, a rhinoceros' horn and a monkey's tail. There were many with two, four and five heads, and others with ten,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="green">p. 92</font></a></p>  
 <p>twelve and twenty arms. In place of ornaments, they wore jawbones, skulls and withered human fingers. And shaking their hairy heads, they advanced with hideous laughter and savage cries:</p>  
 <p>"I can shoot a hundred arrows at one time; I shall seize the body of the monk." "My hand can crumple up the sun, the moon and the stars; how easy it will be to crush this man and his tree." "My eyes are full of poison: they would dry up the sea; I shall look at him, and he will burn to a cinder."</p>  
 <p>Sarthavaha kept to himself. A few friends had gathered around him, and they were saying:</p>  
 <p>"Fools! You think he is mad because he meditates; you think he is craven because he is calm. It is you who are madmen, it is you who are cowards. You do not know his power; because of his great wisdom he will defeat you all. Were your numbers as infinite as the grains of sand on the banks of the Ganges, you would not disturb a single hair of his head. And you believe you can kill him! Oh, turn back! Do not try to harm him; bow before him in reverence. His reign has come. The jackals howl in the forests when the lion is away, but when the lion roars, the jackals scamper off in terror. Fools, fools! You shout with pride while the master is silent, but when the lion speaks you will take to your heels,"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="green">p. 93</font></a></p>  
 <p>The army listened with contempt to these words of wisdom spoken by Sarthavaha and his friends. It kept advancing.</p>  
 <p>Before attacking the hero, Mara sought to frighten him. He roused against him the fury of the winds. Fierce gales rushed toward him from the horizon, uprooting trees, devastating villages, shaking mountains, but the hero never moved; not a single fold of his robe was disturbed.</p>  
 <p>The Evil One summoned the rains. They fell with great violence, submerging cities and scarring the surface of the earth, but the hero never moved; not a single thread of his robe was wet.</p>  
 <p>The Evil One made blazing rocks and hurled them at the hero. They sped through the air but changed when they came near the tree, and fell, not as rocks, but flowers.</p>  
 <p>Mara then commanded his army to loose their arrows at his enemy, but the arrows, also, turned into flowers. The army rushed at the hero, but the light he diffused acted as a shield to protect him; swords were shivered, battle-axes were dented by it, and whenever a weapon fell to the ground, it, too, at once changed into a flower.</p>  
 <p>And, suddenly, filled with terror at the sight of these prodigies, the soldiers of the Evil One fled.</p>  
 <p>And Mara wrung his hands in anguish, and he cried:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="green">p. 94</font></a></p>  
 <p>"What have I done that this man should defeat me? For they are not a few, those whose desires I have granted! I have often been kind and generous! Those cowards who are fleeing could bear witness to that."</p>  
 <p>The troops that were still within hearing answered:</p>  
 <p>"Yes, you have been kind and generous. We will bear witness to that."</p>  
 <p>"And he, what proof has he given of his generosity?" continued Mara. "What sacrifices has he made? Who will bear witness to his kindness?"</p>  
 <p>Whereupon a voice came out of the earth, and it said:</p>  
 <p>"I will bear witness to his generosity."</p>  
 <p>Mara was struck dumb with astonishment. The voice continued:</p>  
 <p>"Yes, I, the Earth, I, the mother of all beings, will bear witness to his generosity. A hundred times, a thousand times, in the course of his previous existences, his hands, his eyes, his head, his whole body have been at the service of others. And in the course of this existence, which will be the last, he will destroy old age, sickness and death. As he excels you in strength, Mara, even so does he surpass you in generosity."</p>  
 <p>And the Evil One saw a woman of great beauty emerge from the earth, up to her waist. She bowed</p>  
 <p><a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="green">p. 95</font></a></p>  
 <p>before the hero, and clasping her hands, she said: "O most holy of men, I bear witness to your generosity."</p>  
 <p>Then she disappeared.</p>  
 <p>And Mara, the Evil One, wept because he had been defeated.</p>
