 <p>SIDDHARTHA could no longer find peace. He strode through the halls of his palace like a lion stung by some poisoned dart. He was unhappy.</p>  
 <p>One day, there came to him a great longing for the open fields and the sight of green meadows. He left the palace, and as he strolled aimlessly through the country, he mused:</p>  
 <p>"It is indeed a pity that man, weak as he really is, and subject to sickness, with old age a certainty and death for a master, should, in his ignorance and pride, contemn the sick, the aged and the dead. If I should look with disgust upon some fellow-being who was sick or old or dead, I would be unjust, I would not be worthy of understanding the supreme law."</p>  
 <p>And as he pondered the misery of mankind, he lost the vain illusion of strength, of youth and of life. He knew no longer joy or grief, doubt or weariness, desire or love, hatred or scorn.</p>  
 <p>Suddenly, he saw a man approaching who looked like a beggar and who was visible to him alone.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></a></p>  
 <p>"Tell me, who are you?" the prince asked him.</p>  
 <p>"Hero," said the monk, "through fear of birth and death, I became an itinerant monk. I seek deliverance. The world is at the mercy of destruction. I think not as other men; I shun pleasures; I know nothing of passion; I look for solitude. Sometimes I live at the foot of a tree; sometimes I live in the lonely mountains or sometimes in the forest. I own nothing; I expect nothing. I wander about, living on charity, and seeking only the highest good."</p>  
 <p>He spoke. Then he ascended into the sky and disappeared. A God had taken the form of a monk in order to arouse the prince.</p>  
 <p>Siddhartha was happy. He saw where his duty lay; he decided to leave the palace and become a monk.</p>  
 <p>He returned to the city. Near the gates he passed a young woman who bowed and said to him, "She who is your bride must know supreme blessedness, O noble prince." He heard her voice, and his soul was filled with peace: the thought had come to him of supreme blessedness, of beatitude, of nirvana.</p>  
 <p>He went to the king; he bowed and said to him:</p>  
 <p>"King, grant the request I have to make. Do not oppose it, for I am determined. I would leave the palace, I would walk in the path of deliverance. We must part, father."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></a></p>  
 <p>The king was deeply moved. With tears in his voice, he said to his son:</p>  
 <p>"Son, give up this idea. You're still too young to consider a religious calling. Our thoughts in the springtime of life are wayward and changeable. Besides, it is a grave mistake to perform austere practises in our youth. Our senses are eager for new pleasures; our firmest resolutions are forgotten when we learn the cost in effort. The body wanders in the forest of desire, only our thoughts escape. Youth lacks experience. It is for me, rather, to embrace religion. The time has come for me to leave the palace. I abdicate, O my son. Reign in my stead. Be strong and courageous; your family needs you. And first know the joys of youth, then those of later years, before you betake yourself to the woods and become a hermit."</p>  
 <p>The prince answered:</p>  
 <p>"Promise me four things, O father, and I shall not leave your house and repair to the woods."</p>  
 <p>"What are they?" asked the king.</p>  
 <p>"Promise me that my life will not end in death, that sickness will not impair my health, that age will not follow my youth, that misfortune will not destroy my prosperity."</p>  
 <p>"You are asking too much," replied the king. "Give up this idea. It is not well to act on a foolish impulse."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></a></p>  
 <p>Solemn as Meru mountain, the prince said to his father:</p>  
 <p>"If you can not promise me these four things, do not hold me back, O father. When some one is trying to escape from a burning house, we should not hinder him. The day comes, inevitably, when we must leave this world, but what merits is there in a forced separation? A voluntary separation is far better. Death would carry me out of the world before I had reached my goal, before I had satisfied my ardor. The world is a prison: would that I could free those beings who are prisoners of desire! The world is a deep pit wherein wander the ignorant and the blind: would that I could light the lamp of knowledge, would that I could remove the film that hides the light of wisdom! The world has raised the wrong banner, it has raised the banner of pride: would that I could pull it down, would that I could tear to pieces the banner of pride! The world is troubled, the world is in a turmoil, the world is a wheel of fire: would that I could, with the true law, bring peace to all men!"</p>  
 <p>With tears in his eyes, he returned to the palace. In the great hall Gopa's companions were laughing and singing. He paid no heed to them. Night came on, and they were silent.</p>  
 <p>They fell asleep. The prince looked at them.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></a></p>  
 <p>Gone was their studied grace, gone the sparkle of their eyes. Their hair was dishevelled, their mouths gaped, their breasts were crushed, and their arms and legs were stiffly outstretched or clumsily twisted under them. And the prince cried:</p>  
 <p>"Dead! They are dead! I am standing in a graveyard!"</p>  
 <p>And he left, and made his way toward the royal stables.</p>
