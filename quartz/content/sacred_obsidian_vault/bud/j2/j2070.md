 <p>"<i>All the world's on pleasure bent</i>," <i>etc</i>.--This story the Master told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about a greengrocer who was a lay-brother.</p>  
 <p>The circumstances have been already given in the First Book <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Here again the Master asked him where he had been so long; and he replied, "My daughter, Sir, is always smiling. After testing her, I gave her in marriage to a young gentleman. As this had to be done, I had no opportunity of paying you a visit." To this the Master answered, "Not now only is your daughter virtuous, but virtuous she was in days of yore; and as you have tested her now, so you tested her in those days." And at the man's request he told an old-world tale.</p>  
 <p align="center">_____________________________</p>  
 <p>Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was a tree-spirit.</p>  
 <p>This same pious greengrocer took it into his head to test his daughter. He led her into the woods, [180] and seized her by the hand, making as though he had conceived a passion for her. And as she cried out in woe, he addressed her in the words of the first stanza:--</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"All the world's on pleasure bent;<br> Ah, my baby innocent!<br> Now I've caught you, pray don't cry;<br> As the town does, so do I."</small></div>  
 <p>When she heard it, she answered, "Dear Father, I ant a maid, and I know not the ways of sin:" and weeping she uttered the second stanza:--</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"He that should keep me safe from all distress,<br> The same betrays me in my loneliness;<br> My father, who should be my sure defence,<br> Here in the forest offers violence."</small></div>  
 <p>And the greengrocer, after testing his daughter thus, took her home, and gave her in marriage to a young man. Afterwards he passed away according to his deeds.</p>  
 <p align="center">_____________________________</p>  
 <p>When the Master had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the Birth:--at the end of the Truths the greengrocer entered on the Fruit of the First Path:--"In those days, father and daughter were the snore as now, and the tree-spirit that saw it all was I myself."</p>
