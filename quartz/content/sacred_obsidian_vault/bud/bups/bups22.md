 <p>343. Having fulfilled forty and eight of the Divine Promise,</p>  
 <p>He attained unto the supreme enlightenment, and was manifest as the Buddha of Infinite Light.</p>  
 <p>Whoso seeketh refuge with Him shall be certainly born into the Land of Purity.</p>  
 <p>344. Into the Promised Land—the Paradise of the Great Calm.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="green">p. 90</font></a></p>  
 <p>He who practiseth the righteous deeds of the mingled motive hath no claim of birth,</p>  
 <p>Therefore He that is Infinite would have us follow the deeds of the single practice that is chosen of Him as teaching that is at the root.</p>  
 <p>345. The merit of His holy austerities throughout the myriads of Kalpas is fully declared in his name of Amida (the Infinite).</p>  
 <p>And the Holy Name, after the consideration of five Kalpas,</p>  
 <p>Will be accorded unto us who are alive in this degenerated age.</p>  
 <p>346. Because action, speech, and mind of the Infinite Life and the believer in the Holy Name are welded as into a diamond, therefore shall he certainly be one with the men that return no more unto birth and death.</p>  
 <p>347. He that hath much knowledge and keepeth the Pure Land is not chosen,</p>  
 <p>And whoso breaketh the Holy Law and sinneth is not disdained.</p>  
 <p>Only he that seeketh refuge in the Eternal Father shall enter into Buddhahood as a pebble is transmuted into gold.</p>  
 <p>348. Our faith that endureth as the diamond</p>  
 <p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></a></p>  
 <p>cometh from the mind of the Buddha that eternally endureth.</p>  
 <p>Lacking the aid of the Divine Power, how should we attain unto the unchanging mind?</p>  
 <p>349. In the great ocean of the Divine Promise</p>  
 <p>Is there no ripple of illusion.</p>  
 <p>If we enter into the ark of the Holy Vow,</p>  
 <p>The spirit of mercy shall take part with our self-endeavour.</p>  
 <p>350. Since we have believed the Divine Promise,</p>  
 <p>How is it possible we should be in the power of life or death?</p>  
 <p>Unchanged may be our sinful body,</p>  
 <p>But our heart is in the Paradise for ever.</p>
