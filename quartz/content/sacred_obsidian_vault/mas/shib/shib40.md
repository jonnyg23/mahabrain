 <p>The Christian Era was first used by a Roman abbot, Denys le Petit, or Dionisius Exigus, about the year 527. It was generally adopted in England in the eighth century. The Council of Chelsea, July, 816, ordained that all bishops should date their acts from the year of the incarnation of our Saviour. In the Eastern Empire it was not in general use until after the capture of Constantinople by Mahomet II, in 1453.</p>  
 <p>Down to 1752 the Historical year in England commenced on January 1st, and the Ecclesiastical, Civil (Legal) year commenced on March 25th. This led to great confusion, to avoid which it was long the custom to add the date of the <i>Historical</i> to that of the <i>Legal</i> year, when speaking of any day between January 1st and March 25th, thus:</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_13900"></a>
 <img src="img/13900.jpg" alt="January 30, 1648 = 1648, the Civil (Legal) year. 1649 = 1649, the Historical Year"></p>  
 <p>Others wrote it thus: January. 30, 1645-9. The lower, or last, figure always indicated the year according to the present calculation.</p>  <h5 align="center">MASONIC CALENDARS.</h5>  
 <p>The various bodies of Freemasonry have adopted Calendars for their special use. In the following table the figures are carried out for the year 1893.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Knights Templar</span> founded 1118. Hence <i>Anno Ordinis</i> 775.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Second Temple</span> began to be built by Zerubbabel, B. C. 330.</p>  
 <p>Hence the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Royal Arch</span>, <i>Anno Inventionis</i> (Year of Discovery) 2423.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Royal and Select Masters</span> refer to completion of the Temple, 1000 B. C.</p>

 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ancient Craft Masons</span> use <i>Anno Lucis</i> (Year of Light)Creation 5893.</p>

 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">January</span>.The Roman Janus presided over the beginning of everything; hence the first month of the year was called after him.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">February</span> (Latin, <i>Februarius</i>).The month of purification; on the 15th day of this month the Feast of Expiation was held.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">March</span>.Named from the Roman god of war, Mars.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">April</span>, (Latin, <i>Aprilis</i>).Probably derived from <i>aperire</i>, to open; because spring generally begins and the buds open in this month.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">May</span> (Latin, <i>Maius</i>).From Maia, a feminine divinity worshiped at Rome on the Ist day of this month.</p>

 <p>The Solar or astronomical year was, 265 years B. C., determined to comprise 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 51 seconds. The <i>Lunar</i> year, comprehending 12 moons, or 354 days, 8 hours, 48 minutes, was the regulator of time among the Chaldeans, Persians and Jews. Till the time of William the Conqueror the English began their year on the 25th of December. Down to 1732 the year did not legally commence till the 25th of March. In Scotland, at that date, the year began on the 1st of January.</p>  
 <p>To adjust the Calendar, a new one was published by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, omitting ten days, the 5th of October becoming the 15th. The New Style was not adopted in Great Britain till 1752, when eleven days were jumped, the 3d of September being reckoned the 14th. In Russia and the East the Old Style is still in force, and all Russian dates are twelve days earlier than English.</p>
