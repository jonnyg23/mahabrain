 Subject:  Have You Hugged Your Chupacabras Lately?      May 20, 1996.
 Part 2.
 
   In previous stories I've read about the Chupacabras it has been
 said that they were able to kill guinea fowl  or guinea hens.  I have
 attempted to hunt this birds as a youngster and they are really hard
 to get close to.  They are a barnyard fowl, having grayish blue
 feathers with white dots.  Originally imported from Guinea, a region
 of the N. African coast.
   Here we go with part 2.

   2.  The small wounds may be similar in appearance to bites
 inflicted by dogs or "baboons,"  due to their being round and small,
 but all similarity ends there.  The government officers and
 veterinarians willing to follow the official  "explanations" given by
 them, do not give the real details pertaining to the wounds.  They
 forget to inform us, conveniently, that whatever enters the animal's
 body has a length of about, at least, three to four inches long.. and
 in some occasions seems to cauterize the walls of the wound,
 apparently to prevent excessive blood loss.  No known animal species
 on Earth can do this.  Some of the wounds of this type appear also on
 the sides and bellies of the victims, and they usually penetrate
 into the animal, cutting through the stomach, continuing down to the
 liver, affecting it and taking parts of it, as well as "absorbing"
 liquids from it.  This requires a length of at least 3, 4 or five
 inches, as has been verified on the animals.  Also, the already
 mentioned triangular pattern of wounds has been observed going into
 the body and penetrating the liver of the victims.
 
   3.  Even though "something" intrudes and penetrates into the
 animals, creating extensive trauma and injuries in them, also leaving
 strange materials in the tissues, no natural inflammatory processes
 have been observed in the dead animals tissues.  This is totally
 unnatural.
 
   4.  In most cases the victims lack rigor mortis, and remain
 flexible, even for days after their death.  Also, incredibly, in
 several of these cases, the blood still remaining in the dead
 animals wouldn't clot or coagulate,  This weird detail lasts for
 days too.
 
   5.  Several bigger holes or cuts are found on the victims body.
 These consist of holes that range from an inch in diameter up to 12
 inches.  These openings are usually located in the neck, chest, belly
 and anal area of the animals killed, and look as if made with a
 surgeon's scalpel.  Clean cut openings are found through which organs
 are excised from the bodies.  The organs tend to be the liver, the
 reproductive and sexual organs, the anus, eyes and other soft
 tissues.
 
   As for the other official "explanation," that mentioned the
 possibility of someone involved with religious or satanic sects who
 may be doing the killings, the number of cases is too numerous for
 this to be the explanation behind it all.  These killings are
 happening everyday, at all hours, all over the island, and no single
 sect has the resources needed to finance such an operative.  There is
 only one sector in Puerto Rico that can afford these actions, the
 government, but what reasons would the government have to do this?
 
                        The Creature Observed
 
   Most of the killings are attributed to strange creatures we have
 called an Anomalous Biological Entities {ABE's}.  It looks like a
 cross between a "grey alien humanoid {because of the shape of its
 head and eyes} and what most witnesses describe as "the body of a
 biped, erect dinosaur, but with no tail."  Its head is oval in shape,
 with an elongated jaw.  It has two big elongated red eyes, small
 holes for a nostril and a small slit-like mouth with fangs
 protruding upwards and downwards from it.  Some witnesses mention it
 has small pointy ears, but most have stated it has none.  It has a
 strong, coarse hair all over its body.  This hair is black, but this
 creature has the ability to change colors at will, like a chameleon.
 If it is in the dark it changes to a dark color, black or dark brown.
 If in a sunlit area with vegetation, it changes to green, green-gray,
 light brown or beige.
 
   The creature has two small arms with three fingered-clawed hands
 and two strong hind legs with three claws, which enable it to run at
 a fast speed and to leap over trees and over more than 20 ft. in a
 single bound.  According to witnesses, the creature's legs look
 reptilian or goatlike.  Also, it has quill-like appendages running
 down from its back, with what seem to be fleshy membranes that change
 colors from blue to green, to red to purple, etcetera.  Some
 witnesses have described seeing the creature flap these
 quill-membrane-like appendages at an incredible speed, and this
 allows it to fly.  Even though it has what seems to be a pair of
 membrane-like wings, these are used by the anomalous biological
 entity to glide and guide itself while flying.  The creature seldom
 flaps these "wings."
 
 JW  All I have to say is, "Land-sakes."
