 THE B2 BOMBER:
 COULD IT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR BOOMERANG UFO SIGHTINGS?
 ======================================================
 
 Reports of boomerang-shaped UFO's are a permanent part of UFO
 records. Cases in point, the Hudson Valley sightings (documented
 in the book Night Siege- The Hudson Valley UFO sightings, by
 Philip J. Imbrogo and a sighting in Florida, April 1993.
 
 After doing a little digging, we cannot help but wonder if *some*
 of them might be attributed to the B2 Stealth bomber.
 
 The stealth fighter we all heard about during the Persian Gulf War
 was the Lockheed F-117. It first flew i 1981 and was used in
 combat during the Panama invasion and the Gulf War.
 
 The Northrop B2 Stealth Bomber first flew in 1989, and was not
 used in the Gulf War. It was developed with a specific mission
 in mind- to fly deep into Soviet territory and drop nuclear
 weapons on silos containing ICBMs. It was also supposed to hit
 the underground shelters that housed Soviet leaders. The B2 was
 also supposed to seek out and destroy Soviet mobile missile
 launchers such as SS24s and SS25s.
 
 The B2, essentially flying wing incorporating radar-defeating
 technology, has no pods to mount weapons. It goes into battle
 naked. Since it is said to be solely subsonic, it's an easy
 target if it is sighted visually by interceptors, particular
 since it does not have afterburners.
 
 The B2 is designed with few radar-reflecting surfaces. Engines,
 fuel tanks and weapons are inside the aircraft. Air for the
 engines comes from inlets on the top wing surface.
 
 Materials selected to defeat radar (radar absorbing materials)
 are used extensively. Carbon fiber, glass fiber and other
 composites are used heavily. And the glass canopy is coated with
 gold to prevent radar reflection off objects inside the cockpit.
 
 The specs for the B2 are:
 
 Builder:        Northrop Corp.
 Aircraft type:  Long rangestrategic bomber
 Engines:        Four General Electric F118-GE Turbofans.
                 Each delivers 19,000 pounds thrust.
 Length:         69 feet
 Height:         17 feet
 Wingspan:       172 feet
 Loaded weight:  376,000 pounds
 Speed:          Subsonic
 Range:          To 7,500 miles
 
 Some reports say boomerang-shaped UFOs "were as big as a football
 field". With a wingspan of 172 feet, we can't see how such errors
 in estimation of size could be made. Unless it was witnessed at
 tree-top level with no other objects to gage size.
 
 The Sirius Connection editors have seen USAF photos of the B2 in
 flight, and yes- it looks weird and a perfect candidate for a
 UFO sighting. Images of the B2 are available as .GIF images
 B2A.GIF and B2B.GIF in the free-to-all Browse Library of Sirius
 Connection. The images are not spectacular, but they are the only
 ones we have been able to track down.
 
 A few interesting questions arise now that the Soviet Union is
 no more. As of July 17, 1989 about $22 billion had been spent to
 produce the B2. The USAF was supposed to get 132 of them at $865
 million a copy. That was cut to 75 by the DOD in April of 1990.
 Additional budget cuts in the program reduced the number
 significantly. How many actually were built? Beyond the three
 known to exist in 1991, who knows?
 
 And with all all those variable wing surfaces, could it be that
 that the B2 has the ability to fly very slowly? Stall-speed data
 is not available. Boomerang-shaped UFO reports frequently mention
 that the objects can move slowly.
 
 And what of the future of the B2s? At $865 million a copy, it is
 not logical they would be scrapped, but rather used as flying
 test-beds for even more advanced technology.
 
 Hope this has helped shed some light on a possible cause of
 *some* of the boomerang-shaped UFO sightings.
