 I have been following the various postings on Crop Circles and thought people
 in this group might find an interview with Colin Andrews (founder of Circles
 Phenomenon Research, an internatiional organization dedicated to the
 investigation of the crop formations) by Monte Leach, USA editor for Share
 International magazine, of interest.  This interview is excerpted from the
 July/August 1992 issue of Share International.
 
 
 *******************************************************************************
 
 THE SIGNS HAVE ARRIVED
 
 
 Interview with Colin Andrews
 by Monte Leach
 
 
 
         Colin Andrews is an electrical engineer and former senior officer with
 local government in West Hampshire, England.  He is founder of Circles
 Phenomenon Research, an international organization dedicated to the
 investigation of the crop formations.  His 1989 international best-selling book
 Circular Evidence, co-authored with Pat Delgado, brought widespread attention
 to the phenomenon, and has been translated into Japanese, German, Spanish, and
 Italian.  A more recent book, The Latest Evidence, was published in 1990 (see
 Share International July/August 1991). Monte Leach interviewed him.
 
 
 
 SI:  What is the latest update on the crop circle phenomenon?
 
 
 CA:  We have been showing evidence, arrived at by a German distillation process
 at HSC laboratory, at Stroud in Gloucestershire, that there had been a change
 in the crystalline structure of the [crop circle] plants.  This is an
 unconventional process that's worried a lot of scientists, who were concerned
 that we were travelling up the wrong road in our research.
         I disagreed, and continue to disagree.  But because it was an
 unconventional approach, we had to find a laboratory prepared and equipped to
 undertake more conventional analytical processes.  Dr W.C. Levengood, a
 biophysicist and plant expert in Michigan, took up the challenge.  He already
 has secured two major discoveries.  One is that the cells at the nodal point,
 the point at which the plants bend, about a half to one inch above ground
 level, have fractured and scarred.  That cannot occur by the trampling of feet,
 or whirlwinds, or the other processes that we hear about.  Dr Levengood is not
 able to state precisely what causes that to happen, but is suggesting that it
 is due to a rapid increase in temperature within the plant.  This fracturing
 and scarring of the cell structure supports the HSC Laboratory results.
 
 
 SI:  What was the other important finding?
 
 
 CA:  Dr Levengood planted the seeds from the cereal crops involved in this
 phenomenon (those that were involved last year) and germinated them in
 environmentally-sound conditions.  He found that the date at which the plants
 germinated was consistent with the controls, the plants outside of the crop
 circle area.  What he then found, and this is consistent with what we have been
 looking at over the years, is that the plant growth is positive.  That is to
 say, the plants, once they've germinated, grew at a very much more accelerated
 rate above ground level [than the control samples].  The root structure was
 also much more extensive and healthy below ground level, as compared with the
 control samples -- indeed many-fold healthier and more productive.  That, too,
 is a very important discovery.  The plants were taken from three sites in the
 world -- Australia, America, and Great Britain.  We're looking at a consistency
 here.  Again, comparing that with wind damage, hoaxing, and trampling by human
 feet, it isn't an effect than can be replicated.
 
 
 
 
 SI:  Will these results be published in any way?
 
 
 CA:  Yes, they will be. In fact, in a limited way, they have already been
 published recently.*
 
 
 SI:  Are there any other developments with the scientific research?
 
 
 CA:  Yes, the work of Gerald Hawkins, the respected scientist in Washington,
 DC, who has written books on the geometry of Stonehenge.
 
 
 
 
 SI:  What has he found with the crop circles?
 
 
 CA:  It's looking very exciting indeed.  Prior to the launch of Circular
 Evidence, we had an 'uncontaminated' period, a period during which -- I would
 pretty well put my life on it -- we were not receiving any hoaxes at all. Since
 the book was launched, the public became aware that something unusual was going
 on, and of course now we have a high number of claims of hoaxes and indeed
 physical hoaxes as well.
         But in the crop formations of that pre-contaminated period prior to
 1989, what Gerald Hawkins has proven is that, well beyond a chance of over 90
 per cent, we are looking at diatonic ratios within the crop circles.  And
 perhaps we're looking at ancient geometry which could relate to sound itself,
 because these are the same ratios which underlie the diatonic scale in music.
 It's an extremely significant development.  What's for sure is that I doubt if
 there is any hoaxer in the world who would begin to even know what it is we're
 talking about, let alone calculate his handiwork to compare ancient diatonic
 ratios of that kind.
 
 
 
 
 The Gulf Breeze incident
 
 
 SI:  Anything that we can look forward to in the coming months?
 
 
 CA:  Early this summer, there's going to be a surveillance operation.  It will
 be similar to what happened when I planned Operation Blackbird with the British
 Army, but it will involve no media whatsoever.  It will be confidential.  A
 site has been chosen.  It's in central-southern England, and it will be at a
 site where the ground markings have appeared regularly, and also where aerial
 phenomena are occurring regularly.
         We're interested in those two particular elements because of a major
 development which took place in Gulf Breeze, Florida, on 13 March this year.
 
 SI:  This is your work with Steven Greer?
 
 
 CA:  We've been working with Dr Steven Greer, a physician here in the US. He's
 now heading his own SETI project [Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence],
 and has worked out over a period of 18 months a protocol for interaction with
 an airborne object.  He took his team of 33 observers to Gulf Breeze, opposite
 the Pensacola military establishment there.
         On 13 March, his team of 33 observers established their position. Using
 powerful one million candle-watt search beams they formed a triangle of light
 in the sky.  Within seconds five white lights with orange balls on the under
 side appeared, moved across the sky and took up position at the triangle's
 apex.  They maintained this position.
         In the next stage Steven flashed the search beam at a pre-determined
 rate onto one of the objects.  Meanwhile, everything was being filmed on video
 camaras.  There were, I believe, another 20 or so members of the public
 observing this from six other locations around Gulf Breeze.  The team then
 traced a course with a beam from above the five objects down onto the beach,
 suggesting to the objects that they move along this line to ground level.  Two
 objects broke away from the five, and moved along that beam.  But they stopped,
 took up a hovering position directly over the observers there.  They maintained
 their position for quite some while, and at that point, through binoculars, all
 of them, Steven included, could see the structural detail of those objects.  At
 this point, the objects gave out two flashes of white light, and all of them,
 the two and the remaining three, just simply disappeared.
         A CBS television film crew was there on the following Tuesday filming
 something quite different.  Some of Steven's team were still in the area.  I
 don't know how they made contact with one another, but apparently they
 suggested to CBS that they should stay and that Steven's team would have a
 second try at this.  They did, and the television crew filmed two UFOs, which
 responded similarly.  Quite an extraordinary case.
         If it is as reported, we have something here of great importance.
 Steven and his team will be coming over to Britain, and carrying on that
 particular process over the fields where these markings have appeared. I have a
 very positive feeling about this, as Steven does himself.  We may well be
 entering a critical phase.
 
 
 Response to a sick molecule
 
 
 SI:  Could you talk a bit about what you believe the crop circles mean?
 
 CA:  We are entering a very crucial and important phase in our evolution.  The
 crop markings are only a part of a major shift in the consciousness of mankind,
 and moving us forward, probably the biggest leap forward in our evolution in
 history.
         In terms of this planet, I believe that we are looking at a single,
 living molecule.  The Gaia theory makes perfect sense to me, that we are indeed
 looking at a living planet, a living organism.  It's what the indigenous
 peoples have always tried to tell us.  They have survived only because they
 have understood how to interact with nature.  They found their place in nature.
 We are here in a material way, and are on a course to folly.  We have a limited
 time to put things right.  It's 10 seconds to midnight.  Unless we learn to
 harmonize, to interact with all living things, I'm afraid we are going to see
 the closing down of a living organism on which we rely.  This message is also
 coming from those who are working in pure science right now.  We have a big
 problem.  The planet has a big problem.  The evidence is there.
         I believe that the crop circles are graphic markings that have within
 them, in their entirety, a meaning.  That meaning, and the response to that
 visual intake, is automatic, because it's within our blueprint.  It is within
 us subconsciously to recognize them.  Many people feel this, but they are
 unable to establish where they've seen them before.
         It is, I believe, part of the change of consciousness.  There are high
 levels of energy which are being intelligently placed into position in critical
 parts of the planet.  These, if you like, are probably the chakra points, to
 give it a term, important energy points of the living organism.  They are not
 random, and they have never been random.  They are at specific points, and they
 recur at those locations.  I believe that they are occurring literally at the
 interface between this dimension of the world that we know quite a lot about
 and those other dimensions of which we know so very little.  We are beginning
 to see that we can interact in a limited way, directly with other dimensions.
         We are seeing, I think, the reaction of the brain end of the universe,
 the thinking end, which is automatically responding to a very sick molecule. If
 you were to cut your finger, the brain end of your universe, your head, would
 react subconsciously to that.  You certainly wouldn't be saying, "Send me
 haemoglobin and white corpuscles."  But the brain end automatically responds.
 If we could watch the processes going on within your framed universe, what we
 would see in a microscope is white blood corpuscles moving to that point and
 interacting.  The behavioural tendency would be the equivalent of the UFO. That
 would be the UFO response from the brain-end of the universe to this planet.
 That's the analogy.
 
 
 The manifestation to come
 
 
 SI:  In the video 'Undeniable Evidence' you say that this crop circle
 phenomenon is leading to a manifestation of some type. What do you think is
 going to happen?
 
 CA:  I have felt for quite some years that we are certainly going to experience
 something of great magnitude.  It is going to be very soon.  We are going to
 encounter something here which I don't think any man or woman is going to
 doubt.
         This coming few months is going to see one or two events which are
 going to shake the world.  It is going to focus our attention and the reality
 of knowing we are not the only thinking components of this living planet.  We
 are going to be stunned into accepting that we have much more to consider.
 
 
 SI:  Do you have a bottom line? Do you know what it's going to be, but hesitate
 to make it known in public?
 
 CA:  I do, because I still feel it is most important at this juncture, as it
 has been for the last 10 years, that this research, this effort at
 disseminating what we already know about this phenomenon, must be kept
 rational.
 
 
 SI:  You believe this event will take place soon, and will leave no doubt that
 we are not alone here. Is that the main purpose of these events?
 
 CA:  It is indeed.  We will be receiving assistance of new knowledge, new
 abilities, because we will be working at a different level.  We will see
 manifestations of the Fatima** type.  That is the picture that is in my mind.
 It is a very clear picture.  I see certainly a Fatima-type experience
 occurring. I believe it will be in the vicinity of Silbury Hill, Stonehenge,
 Avebury in southern England, because that's where the focus of attention is.
 There has to be a reason why this is happening right there.  Having said that,
 I believe that will be the door opener.  The whole world is going to experience
 something of tremendous importance.
 
 
 Close to a Golden Age
 
 
 SI:  What you are saying correlates in some ways with Benjamin Creme's message.
 
 CA:  I would like to say on the record that I have great respect for Benjamin
 Creme's work.  Indeed, I hope to meet him.  I have read a fair bit of your
 magazine, in fact.
         The thinking end, the brain end of the universe is the way I have been
 putting it in recent times.  We could easily fall out with society here because
 there is potential for great difficulty when we are talking about the thinking
 component of the universe.  That could be Jesus.  It could be God.  It could be
 extraterrestrial.  It could be high nature.  I don't feel that we have time to
 fall out over that.  We have something which has thought, something which is
 intelligently interacting with us, and providing us with proof of its
 existence.
 
 
 SI:  I believe that all of these phenomena are very much connected. I think the
 appearance of the Teacher, the crop circles, the UFOs, are all working together
 to raise the consciousness of humanity. That's my opinion.
 
 CA:  It's one that I share totally.  We are living in special times.  There is
 no doubt that at this time next year, the world is going to be very different.
 We are living very close to a Golden Age.  I really feel that.  But equally,
 one has to say a word of warning, that always there are equal quantities of
 blackness right alongside.  It's as easy to get it wrong as it is to get it
 right.  We have to put out that white light, to put out there positive
 thinking, with sincerity and good heart.  At the end of the day, we'll be doing
 all we possibly can for humanity.
         It is also worth bearing in mind the Hopi Indian prophecy.  We have
 reached a stage at the very end of the evolutionary path where the Hopi are
 awaiting the white man who left their land to return with the missing piece of
 a tablet on which there will be the signs.  I would suggest to you that if we
 can focus our attention on the crop circles and the interaction with the UFO,
 in the very near future we will appreciate that the signs have arrived.  As the
 Hopi prophecy shows, we are about to hold and shake the hand of the Spirit, the
 very Spirit that started us on this path.
 
 
 
 *Linda Moulton Howe, an award-winning documentary filmmaker and a UFO
 researcher, has helped to co-ordinate Dr Levengood's work.  Howe had these
 comments at a recent conference in San Francisco:
         "Dr Levengood has found under microscopic examination that in the
 plants that were affected, the cell pits -- the tiny holes in cells of plants
 where fluid moves back and forth, and keep the plants growing and healthy --
 have been expanded.  The only way that Dr Levengood could duplicate this cell
 pit separation was to put plants inside of a microwave for up to 30 seconds.
 He's not saying that it's microwave radiation that did it.  He's saying that
 rapid heating was the only way he could duplicate the cell pit separation in
 the plants.
         "Further, a nuclear design engineer in Tennessee has done preliminary
 work on some soil samples and has found that there were three different types
 of isotope changes that were found in the soil underneath at least two crop
 formations.  That work is now considered to be tentative.  They need many more
 soil samples from many more formations to make any kind of definitive
 scientific presentation.  But at least the preliminary findings are intriguing
 because they suggest that some kind of energy is being applied in the formation
 of these crop circles that is not understood."

 Virgin Mary in 1917.  The experiences culminated in October of that year in a
 manifestation which included miraculous phenomena witnessed by thousands.

 -  a "space cookie" UGM was discovered in a meadow.  It is a
 perfect circle, 6 metres in diameter. Its depth varies from 5 cm
 to 31 cm.  Grass is growing straight up both inside and outside
 the circle.  No tracks were found leading to the area.  The UGM
 is not a sinkhole.

 920525    Limerick, Pennsylvania
 -  at least 12 "matted down" areas were found in a wheatfield north of
 Philadelphia.  Three were circles about five feet in diameter, arranged
 in a triangle.  One feature was "T-shaped".  Soil samples taken by a UFO
 investigator "showed no irregularities".  Geiger counter readings were
 also normal.  Although a hoax was suspected by the UFO investigator,
 the owner of the field believes that the UGMs were caused by lodging,
 wind and fertilizer damage, and that "It happens every year".

 -  a circle of flattened grass was found in a hay field following
 a CE2 UFO sighting.  A loud noise, "like a freight train", was
 heard, and two witnesses ran to look out their front door.  A
 object "the size of a swimming pool", "like orange windows lla
 around it", was in a field about 300 feet away from their house. 
 When they went to call other witnesses, the object disappeared.

 920705    Hobbema, Alberta
 -  two ovals of flattened barley were found in a field after
 unusual lights were observed descending to the ground.  The
 largest UGM has a major axis of 47 feet.  The crop is pushed away
 uniformly from the centers of the patches, but the centers are
 "clumped", like breaking waves.  Barley inside the circles is
 "white", and devoid of colour.  It was later suggested that the areas
 were due to spilled seeds and fertilizer, combined with lodging.

 920715    St. Adolphe, Manitoba
 -  a field beside a highway was discovered to have numerous patches of
 flattened crop, in irregular patterns.  The formations were discovered
 by the same person who found case 920701.  Investigation by NAICCR and
 interviews with the owner of the field established that the crop had
 been laid down by strong winds and heavy rain.  The person who
 discovered the formations was convinced that aliens created the
 flattened patches.

 NAICCR (North American Institute for Crop Circle Research)
 
 Report on Investigations of Crop Circles
 in the Area of Strathclair, Manitoba
 
 18 August 1992
 
 
      Following media reports about several new crop circles in
 western Manitoba, NAICCR representatives travelled to the area
 for onsite investigations.
 
      Five crop formations were discovered, one of which was
 easily explained as lodging.  Of the other four, three were in
 the shape of the symbol for Mars: a circle with an attached arrow. 
 Two were alongside a major highway, while the others were
 next to less-travelled farm roads.  The two near the major
 highway were apparently made on the night of 14-15 August 1992.  
 
      Rumours of the circles spread through the community, and
 many people went to see the formations.  By Monday, 17 August
 1992, an estimated 200 people had visited the sites.  News media
 mentioned the sites in newscasts on 17-18 August, but the
 formations did not attract the wide publicity that other, less
 impressive and explainable formations had garnered a month
 earlier.  NAICCR investigators were able to visit the sites on 18
 August 1992, after a four-hour excursion from Winnipeg.
 
      Wheat and soil samples were taken from all sites.  Mapping
 was done, though, because of excessive trampling of the
 formations, measurement errors of about six inches were possible. 
 Compasses were employed, but no magnetic anomalies were detected. 
 Both VHF and AM/FM radios were tested, but no interference was
 detected.  Tape recordings taken at the sites were unaffected. 
 No unusual sounds were heard, and no unusual "feelings" were
 sensed.  Insects were present in normal quantities at the sites. 
 According to residents, animals were not afraid to enter the
 areas.
 
      At one formation, two youths guarded the entrance and
 brandished a sign reading: "A Loonie a Look"; they charged a
 dollar to anyone wanting to enter the site. [Note: "loonie" is a slang
 term for a Canadian dollar coin.]
 
      At Strathclair No.4, two NAICCR investigators decided to try
 an experiment in circle creation.  They walked between the rows
 of wheat into an unaffected area and began walking around in a
 circle.  After five minutes, they had produced a circle of
 comparable size to Strathclair No.4.  The new circle was swirled
 and flattened, and examination of wheat stalks showed no breakage
 whatsoever.  The stalks were only gently bent at a height of
 about one to two inches above the ground, and did not appear to
 have been subjected to any force.  The appearance of the new
 circle was relatively "messy", but after a few minutes of "touch-
 ups", it began to look more like the "real" circle.  Suggestions
 were offered as to ways in which more even flattening could be
 produced.  Since Strathclair No.4 was created on the night of 14-
 15 August 1992, only a few days after full Moon, it was proposed
 that a hoaxer could easily have created the formation without any
 flashlights and ducked down below the level of the five-foot-high
 wheat when an occasional car passed by.
 
      The hoax theory is complicated by a CE1 UFO
 sighting over the field where the Ipswich formation was
 discovered.  One close witness and two other witnesses observed
 an unusual object moving over the field and then fly away on the
 night that that formation was likely created.
 
      On the night of 14 August, a television program about crop
 circles had been aired.  Residents of the area had recalled
 seeing the episode.  However, at least two of the formations had
 been discovered before the program was aired.  It is not thought
 that the television program had necessarily precipitated the later 
 formations.
 
      Wheat samples will be given to several researchers for
 testing.  As some cerealogists have claimed that seeds from
 plants inside circles grow faster/better than those from a
 control sample, double-blind tests of this theory will be
 performed.  Further investigations are continuing.
 
      Descriptions of the formations follow, along with a number of UFO
 reports from the same time period.

                                         2115 local time
 
 A woman was driving east from Shoal Lake to Strathclair when she
 saw a pair of bright yellow lights over a field to her left.  The
 lights appeared to be about 50 to 100 feet above the ground.  She
 stopped her car to get a better look, and watched as the lights
 moved in tandem, one above the other, progressing over the field
 heading west.  As it was not quite dark, she was sure that she
 could see a dark object behind the lights, with another very
 small flashing light at its "tail".  
 
 The witness' daughter and son-in-law were following in their own
 car, and they also saw the object before it moved out of view
 behind some trees.  The object was visible for about two minutes
 as it progressed slowly over the field.  No noise was heard.
 
 Reported to the media on 15 August 1992.
 
 The next day, a crop circle UGM was discovered in the wheat field
 over which the UFO had travelled.  See NAICCR case 920815.1

              North American Institute for Crop Circle Research
                             in conjunction with

                               Reported in 1992
 
      Since 1990, NAICCR (North American Institute for Crop Circle Research)
 has been requesting and collecting information on UGMs (unusual ground
 markings) in North America. The 1990 and 1991 NAICCR reports were widely
 circulated, and have been reprinted in a number of books and publications
 around the world.  The favourable response of the ufology and cerealogical
 community to NAICCR's efforts has encouraged the continued gathering of
 data for comparison and analysis.
 
      One of the reasons NAICCR has been making UGM and crop circle data
 available to researchers is because no comparable reports are produced
 regarding UGMs in Britain. Various factions and cerealogists are said to
 maintain extensive databases on crop circles, but the data is normally not
 disseminated.  True, several coffee-table books have been published with
 remarkable aerial photographs of unique formations, and cerealogy
 "alphabets" have been circulated which categorize the agriglyphs, but raw
 data including all possibly relevant parameters is hard to come by.  In
 addition, there is the alleged "hoarding" of crop circle data by some
 researchers, and the selective winnowing of cases by others.
 
      Since British data has been so elusive to some researchers, NAICCR
 associates have attempted to gather UGM data from the entire continent of
 North America, rather than focusing upon the British scene.  This has been
 no small feat.  The effective area of North American cerealogy is several
 times larger than that of Britain, so North American cerealogists have a
 much more difficult task than their counterparts across the ocean.
 "Stakeouts" of circle-prone areas are possible in England, but not in
 America.
 
      The principle which guides the collection and dissemination of crop
 circle data by NAICCR is the open exchange of information for all those
 involved in the field.  It has been suggested that the sharing of
 information and the co-operation between researchers is a vital aspect of
 both ufology and cerealogy.
 
      In practice, although requests for information are frequently made,
 relatively few researchers and investigators respond by sending NAICCR the
 required data.  Typically, local investigators send information to regional
 directors of their organizations, if they send their information to anyone
 at all.  The quality and style of investigations tend to vary considerably,
 and therefore make comparative studies very difficult.  The need for
 standardization of investigative techniques is clearly an issue in UGM
 studies.
 
      As a result, information about many UGMs comes by way of second-hand
 sources, newsletters, magazines, computer bulletin boards and media
 reports.  Some reports of UGMs are nothing more than rumours, despite
 attempts to substantiate claims and alleged witnesses' accounts.  For these
 reasons, the usefulness of the data is limited.  However, it is the
 position of NAICCR that the collection and publication of this data are
 important in the development of the field.  At the very least, researchers
 who perhaps read only a few publications can be apprised of the broader
 aspect of the phenomena, and the variety of the cases.
 
      While it is admirable that many researchers have taken it upon
 themselves to study specific cases or aspects of UGMs, those who claim
 expertise or are portrayed as being very knowledgeable of the subject are
 sometimes poorly versed in the phenomenon.  Indeed, some lack the necessary
 background to speak with authority on UGMs or related phenomena.  This has
 resulted in some "experts" making unscientific or otherwise unsupported
 claims during media interviews, contributing to misconceptions about the
 facts of the phenomenon.
 
      The situation is complicated further by the delineation of "camps"
 within the UGM field, whether they be vortex theorists, UFO adherents,
 skeptical refuseniks or ultraterrestrialists.  These are additional reasons
 why an objective presentation of all the raw data from all sources is
 considered essential in order to gain a more complete understanding of the
 phenomena.  It is the hope of NAICCR that the presentation of North
 American UGM data in this Report will encourage more co-operation and
 discussion among researchers at all levels, whether the reader is an
 armchair theorist, a field investigator or a debunker.
 
      The general position of NAICCR is that no one theory is favourable
 over any other at the present time.  This flies directly against the belief
 by many skeptics that "all crop circles are hoaxes", and also the belief by
 many ETH supporters that crop circles are definitely communications from
 aliens.  The hoax issue is not trivial.  Debates are raging between
 cerealogists concerning the fraction of "genuine" formations that have been
 found.
 
      First of all, we must realize that the exact determination of this
 fraction is impossible, since we have no exact figure for the number of all
 UGMs in Britain.  Are there 1000 recorded sites since 1980?  2000?  3000?
 Do the numbers reflect individual UGMs, or complete formations?  Is a site
 with ten "grapeshot" circles counted as "ten" or "one"?
 
      Second, cerealogists have gone on record as saying that hoaxers have
 become so proficient at their craft that there is now no way to tell a
 "genuine" circle from a "fake" one. The implications of such a statement
 should alarm researchers.  If hoaxed circles look "genuine", then all
 circles could be hoaxes just as easily as all circles could be "real".
 
      Third, claims of hoaxing are themselves not proof of hoaxing.
 Although skeptics would invoke Ockham's Razor and point out that hoaxing is
 the simplest explanation for crop circles, the problem is more complex than
 that.  Aside from the Bower/Chorley demonstrations, comparatively few
 hoaxers have admitted their handiwork and have described their exact method
 used.  This has resulted in many cerealogists adopting a "doubting Thomas"
 attitude;  unless hoaxers are caught red-handed or come forward after the
 fact with detailed information about their hoax effort, the hoaxers are not
 to be believed.
 
      In North America, though several individuals have claimed to have
 hoaxed crop circles, only a few have met the "doubting Thomas" criteria.
 The situation is much worse in Britain, given the larger number of sites.
 A common observation among cerealogists is that hoaxing cannot be a viable
 explanation because thousands of crop circle sites would require huge
 armies of hoaxers, all of whom were clever enough to make intricate
 formations without being seen, indeed, in some cases, under the watchful
 eyes of surveillance cameras.
 
      But are the logistics of hoaxing really that impossible?  Since many
 formations were discovered days or even weeks after they were likely
 created, they could have been done without any witnesses.  By the time many
 were found, visitors might have trampled tell-tale signs of hoaxing.  We do
 not have accurate figures available on the fraction of sites which were
 under observation, and which were also investigated prior to visitors.  How
 many of the 1000 (or 2000) UGMs are considered highly reliable?
 
      Let us assume that there is one determined and expert crop circle
 hoaxer in Britain. Let us also assume that he (or she) made one crop circle
 per night during a 100-day farming season.  This one person could have made
 all 1000 circles in Britain since 1980!
 
      This is absurd, of course.  The time requirements, personal cost,
 travelling, secrecy and other factors would make this scenario ridiculous.
 But let us assume that the variables were altered.  Suppose there were ten
 hoaxers.  Suppose that ten crop circles were made each night.  Suppose that
 some circles were created by a mysterious natural or preternatural
 phenomenon (!).  The reader is left to speculate upon other scenarios.
 This exercise does not, by itself, imply that hoaxing is the most likely
 explanation for crop circles.  However, it puts into perspective the
 problems of coming to terms with the phenomenon.
 
      What of the other theories?  What evidence is there to support the
 vortex or extraterrestrial theories?  In the former, there do exist several
 dozen recorded cases of eyewitnesses to strong, spiralling downdraughts
 making circular patches in wheat or tall grasses.  Both Ohtsuki and Meaden
 have presented physical arguments that simple crop circles could be made by
 wind vortices, and have hypothesized certain physical conditions that might
 be conducive to crop circle creation (sides of hills, winds, etc.).
 However, given the difficulty of weeding "genuine" circles from the dross
 in the data, the theory requires some refining.  In addition, a "natural"
 mechanism would demand the creation of formations in great numbers around
 the world, not just confined to a small area in Britain.  Perhaps, the
 NAICCR reports will serve to support the theory.
 
      On the other hand, TIF (Theory of the Intelligent Force) seems
 supported by eyewitness accounts and videos of unusual lights or structured
 objects near crop circle sites. Some vortex theorists might say these are
 special cases of plasmas in action, but some TIF proponents insist that
 added factors such as weaving and complex patterns rule out a natural
 mechanism.
 
      In terms of physical changes within crop circles, results are
 interesting, though not completely satisfying.  Tests have shown no sites
 to have residual radioactivity, despite earlier heralded claims to the
 contrary.  Spagyrical analyses, dating back to the days of alchemy and not
 given much scientific weight today, attempted to show "crystallization" of
 plant cells from within crop circles.  This evidence is not as credible as
 many would believe.  We are left with the body of evidence produced through
 analyses by Dr. W. Levengood of Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratories.  His
 results, published in a series of reports, purport to shown "changes" or
 otherwise significant abnormalities in samples taken from circle sites.
 The prospect of proving abnormalities within crop circles using these
 results is very exciting, though it would be preferable if other
 independent laboratories could confirm the effects.
 
 Results of the 1992 Study
 
      As of 31 January, 1993, there had been 93 UGMs (unusual ground
 markings) reported or otherwise communicated to UFOROM (Ufology Research of
 Manitoba) or NAICCR during the 1992 calendar year.  These represented only
 40 different sites or locations; some cases had multiple associated UGMs.
 The set of UGMs includes those features commonly called "crop circles" as
 well as features known as "saucer nests", "space cookies", "burn marks" and
 "landing traces".
 
 
      The UGMs were classified in the following categories:
 
                     1. FC - Flattened Circle
                     2. FR - Flattened Ring
                     3. BC - Burned Circle
                     4. BR - Burned Ring
                     5. BF - Burned and Flattened
                     6. CR - Concentric Ring
                     7. VM - Vegetation Missing
                     8. VD - Vegetation Dead
                     9. YG - Yellowing of Grass
                     10. SG - Stunted Growth
                     11. EG - Enhanced Growth
                     12. DP - Depression
                     13. HO - Hole
                     14. OT - Other
 
 The classification system is not mutually exclusive, and some sites may
 contain more than one category of UGM.
 
      A problem in the statistical tabulation of UGM data is the lack of
 standardization in the counting of the UGMs.  At some sites, only a single
 UGM is observed, while at others, there may be dozens.  Some researchers
 have chosen to count each UGM separately, but many count features according
 to sites.  A "quadruplet" may therefore be counted as "4" or "1", depending
 on the system used. A more complex feature such as an "agriglyph" poses
 additional problems: is a count of its component circles, triangles, etc.,
 of real analytical value?  The NAICCR data is presented with both counting
 schemes; researchers can adopt their own systems for interpretation.
 
      It is interesting to note that the number of UGMs per year has
 remained about the same since 1990.  This might suggest that UGMs are a
 continuing, constant phenomenon like their cousins, UFOs.

 # Sites     |   21   |  52.5%  |   19   |  47.5%  |   40   |
 ============================================================
 
 
      Of the 93 total UGMs found in North America, 47 (50.5%) were in Canada
 and 46 (49.5%) were in the United States.  When the number of sites is
 examined, the distribution is essentially the same: 21 (52.5%) in Canada
 and 19 (47.5%) in the United States.  When compared with previous years,
 the 1992 data suggests several things.  First, the number of reported UGMs
 in North America is constant, averaging around 90 UGMs/year.  Second, it
 would appear that the ratio of UGMs/sites is also constant, with a value
 near two.  In other words, the typical UGM case involves at least two
 impressions/effects, and are more properly called formations.
 
      If we assume that the mechanism for reporting North American UGM cases
 is relatively constant, this data does seem to show a "background" level of
 UGM activity, something that had been suspected by some researchers.  More
 to the point, it suggests that the huge numbers of crop circle UGMs in
 Britain are an anomaly.  Some would read this as a confirmation of
 widespread hoaxing and contamination of British UGM data.  To others, this
 implies that the British hills and valleys are host to a truly unique
 phenomenon, incomparable to UGM activity elsewhere in the world.  Indeed,
 the constancy of the American numbers seems to show that American and
 British UGM activity, specifically that of crop circles, are different
 effects with different causes.  Why this is so is not completely clear at
 this time.
 
      As in previous years, there was an uneven distribution of UGMs
 throughout North America in 1992.  Significant numbers of cases were
 reported in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, which had few UGMs reported in 1991.
 Illinois had the largest number of American cases in 1992, as in previous
 years.
 
      There was a strong, significant difference in the direction of swirl
 reported for crop circles.  Of the cases for which swirl data was reported,
 28 swirls were counterclockwise, and only one was clockwise.  All swirled
 UGMs were in Canada.

      The diversity of the crops affected by UGMs is evident in the above
 table.  The public impression that crop circles appear exclusively in wheat
 is clearly wrong.  Furthermore, the British label of "corn circles" is also
 a misnomer for North American cases, though this is due more to idiom than
 botany.  Some researchers such as AUFOSG have noted this problem of crop
 identification, and have included the proper scientific names of affected
 UGM crop in their reports.  If other groups adopt this system, it may
 alleviate some confusion.
 
      The most marked change from 1991 is the increase in wheat formations
 in the United States.  There were 21 in 1992, but only 1 in 1991.
 Otherwise, UGM activity was as varied as in previous years.

 In 1992, the average diameter of UGMs was 10.62 metres.  In 1991, the
 average diameter of UGMs was 7.06 metres.  The 1990 average was 10.7
 metres.
 
      The "UFO Connection" to UGMs and crop circles alleged by some
 researchers is not borne out by the 1992 data.  UFOs were reported in
 conjunction with only 4 UGM sites, representing 10% of the cases.  We can
 note that Ted Phillips' Catalog of Physical Traces Associated with UFO
 Sightings, published in the 1970's, had a similar fraction of cases. Many
 of the UGMs listed in his Catalog had no associated UFO activity.  In other
 words, the overall characteristics of trace cases and UFO effects have not
 changed dramatically over the years; only our identification and naming the
 sites as "crop circles" instead of "physical traces" has evolved.
 
      In 26 UGMs (28%) or at 8 sites (20%), winds were noted as a possible
 explanation. As many as 18 UGMs (19%) at 8 sites (20%) were given probable
 explanations.  As can be seen in the annotated list of cases, cerealogists
 are rapidly gaining expertise in crop effects such as lodging and blights.
 
      The characteristics of 1992 UGMs varied considerably.  As many as 11
 UGMS (12%) at 7 sites (17.5%) were described as possessing "corridors".  No
 complex formation such as the Coalhurst structure of 1991 was discovered,
 though smaller oddities such as "dumbbells" and "Mars symbols" were noted
 in 1992.
 
      The listing of UGM data does not include any indication of the
 investigations and conclusions reached by researchers regarding the cause
 or reason for the existence of the features.  The limited information
 available for these analyses precluded any extensive discussion of the
 individual cases.  Some information about the cases will be found in the
 annotated case list later in this report.  Sources of information about the
 cases are provided, but researchers intending to use this data in their own
 studies are cautioned that NAICCR cannot vouch for the accuracy of reports.
 
      The question of physical or physiological effects reported at UGM
 sites should also be addressed here.  It has been claimed that electronic
 interference is sometimes experienced within or in the proximity of British
 crop circles.  Convincing support for this claim is much debated, but such
 effects have been noted in many cases, usually as an indication that UFOs
 have been involved.  Sometimes, vortex theorists imply that these effects
 may be related to plasma activity in the surrounding area.
      
      In both 1991 and 1992, several North American UGM sites were claimed
 to have associated effects.  Some sites were said to exhibit a positive
 effect when dowsed, while other sites produced eerie "energy", detected by
 sensitives.  Unfortunately, these effects do not seem to be consistent, and
 are not experienced by all witnesses or investigators at the same site.
 
      It is hoped that research into UGMs will benefit from studies of the
 raw UGM data. Researchers are urged to examine the data presented and
 prepare their own interpretations in order to further develop their
 theories about the origins of UGMs or the specific category of crop
 circles.

 920525    Limerick, Pennsylvania
 -  at least 12 "matted down" areas were found in a wheatfield north of
 Philadelphia.  Three were circles about five feet in diameter, arranged in
 a triangle.  One feature was "T-shaped".  Soil samples taken by a UFO
 investigator "showed no irregularities".  Geiger counter readings were also
 normal.  Although a hoax was suspected by the UFO investigator, the owner
 of the field believes that the UGMs were caused by lodging, wind and
 fertilizer damage, and that "It happens every year".

 - a doughnut-shaped impression was found in sweet flag weeds.  The circle
 looked much like others that had appeared in the same field in 1991.
 Samples from the circles were analyzed by Dr. Levengood and shown to have
 abnormalities.  A skeptic posted an admission of hoaxing on a computer
 bulletin board, but this was never verified.

 920627    Raeford, North Carolina
 -  a circle of flattened grass was found in a hay field following a CE2 UFO
 sighting.  A loud noise, "like a freight train", was heard, and two
 witnesses ran to look out their front door.  A object "the size of a
 swimming pool", "like orange windows all around it", was in a field about
 300 feet away from their house. When they went to call other witnesses, the
 object disappeared.

 920701    St. Adolphe, Manitoba
 -  nine "horseshoe-shaped" patches of flattened grass were found on either
 side of a brook in a Winnipeg suburb. Because of recent storms and heavy
 rainfall, lodging was thought to be the cause.

 920705    Hobbema, Alberta
 -  two ovals of flattened barley were found in a field after unusual lights
 were observed descending to the ground.  The largest UGM has a major axis
 of 47 feet.  The crop is pushed away uniformly from the centers of the
 patches, but the centers are "clumped", like breaking waves.  Barley inside
 the circles is "white", and devoid of colour.  It was later suggested that
 the areas were due to spilled seeds and fertilizer, combined with lodging.

 920715    St. Adolphe, Manitoba
 -  a field beside a highway was discovered to have numerous patches of
 flattened crop, in irregular patterns.  The formations were discovered by
 the same person who found case 920701.  Investigation by NAICCR and
 interviews with the owner of the field established that the crop had been
 laid down by strong winds and heavy rain.  The person who discovered the
 formations was convinced that aliens created the flattened patches.

 920721    Friedensruh, Manitoba
 -  a farmer found a triangular area of flattened/swirled grass which was
 surrounded by an electric fence.  The dimensions were 31x27x17 feet.  Local
 residents could not explain the phenomenon.  However, NAICCR investigators
 found evidence that animals had trampled the site.
