          YOU HAVE  MY PERMISSION  TO QUOTE  FROM THIS INFORMATION IN
                   PRESS RELEASES, PERIODICALS, AND SPEECHES.
                     INCLUSION IN  ANY OTHER MEDIA REQUIRES
                         MY EXPRESS WRITTEN PERMISSION.
 
          This file  contains the  absolute true information regarding
     the alien presence on Earth and the U.S. Government's involvement
     with the aliens.
          This file contains only the information as I saw it and only
     my information.
          It does not contain any information from any other source.
          It was necessary for me to issue the information previous to
     this release in a manner which would deceive the government until
     someone was able to independently confirm my identity, my employ-
     ment, my service record, my intelligence background, the identity
     of the  person to  which I  gave the information in 1972, his ac-
     knowledgment of  the information  and when  it was  given to him,
     that the  information is  correct, that I have not seen him since
     1974, and that I have not communicated with him in any form since
     1976.
          This was  necessary because this file is my death warrant if
     MJ-12 continues  to operate  in a manner consistent with its his-
     tory.
          All in the last paragraph has been independently verified by
     two different  people who  have no connection with each other.  I
     will only list one for obvious reasons.
          Tony Pelham, journalist
          Las Vegas Bullet
          300 West Boston
          Las Vegas, Nevada  89102.
          The original  information that I first released was not much
     MAJI that I was not a threat long enough to have independent ver-
     ification of the facts before I risked death.  [TRANSMISSION GAR-
     BLED]
          I wish  to make  it absolutely  clear that I do not consider
     myself a hero.
          I believe  that most  of you  would do the same thing if you
     knew the truth.

          I gave an oath that I would uphold and protect the Constitu-
     tion of  the United  States of  America and I take that oath very
     seriously.
          I am doing no more now than I did when I fought in Vietnam.
          I am doing my duty.
          Please make  copies of  this file  and send  it to your con-
     gressman, your  senator,  the  attorney  general  of  the  United
     States, and the Supreme Court.
          Send it also to everyone you know.
          Attach copies of the Bill English file and John Lears file.
          Send anything  else you  may have which tends to support the
     information.
          I, Milton  William Cooper, 1311 S. Highland #205, Fullerton,
     California, 92632, 1-714-680-9537, do solemnly swear that the in-
     formation contained  in this file is true and correct to the best
     of my knowledge.
          I swear  that I  saw this information in 1972 in the perfor-
     mance of  my duties as a member of the Intelligence Briefing Team
     of the Commander In Chief of the Pacific Fleet as a Petty Officer
     in the U.S. Navy.
          I swear  that I  underwent hypnotic  regression in  order to
     make the information as accurate as possible.
          I swear  that I can and will take a lie detector test or any
     other test of any reputable person's choosing in order to confirm
     this information.
          I swear that I can and will undergo hypnotic regression con-
     ducted by  any reputable  and qualified  doctor of  any reputable
     person's choosing in order to confirm this information.
          I will not, however submit to any test or hypnosis by anyone
     who is  now or has ever been connected with the government in any
     capacity for obvious reasons.
          The following  is brief listing of everything that I person-
     ally saw  and know  from 1972 and does not contain any input from
     any other source whatsoever.
          MAJESTY was listed as the code word for the President of the
     United States for communications concerning this information.
          OPERATION MAJORITY  is the name of the operation responsible
     for every  aspect, project,  and consequence of alien presence on
     Earth.
          GRUDGE contains  16 volumes  of documented  information col-
     lected from  the beginning  of the United States investigation of
     Unidentified Flying  Objects (UFOs)  and Identified  Alien Crafts
     (IACs).
          The  project   was  financed   by  CIA   confidential  funds
     (nonappropriated) and money from the illicit drug trade.  Partic-
     ipation in  the illegal drug trade was justified in that it would
     identify and  eliminate the  weak elements  of our  society.  The
     purpose of  Project Grudge was to collect all scientific, techno-
     logical, medical and intelligence information from UFO/IAC sight-
     ings and contacts with alien life forms.
          This orderly  file of collected information has been used to
     advance the United States Space Program.
          MJ-12 is the name of the secret control group.
          President Eisenhower  commissioned a secret society known as
     THE JASON SOCIETY (JASON SCHOLARS) to sift through all the facts,
     evidence, technology,  lies and  deception and  find the truth of
     the alien question.
          The society  was made  up of 32 of the most prominent men in
     the country in 1972 and the top 12 members were designated MJ-12.
          MJ-12 has  total control  over everything.   They are desig-
 
                                     Page 2
 
 
 
 
     nated by  the codes  J-1, J-2,  etc., all  the  way  through  the
     members of the Jason Society.
          The director  of the CIA was appointed J-1 and is the Direc-
     tor of MJ-12.
          MJ-12 is responsible only to the President.
          MJ-12 runs most of the world's illegal drug trade.
          This was  done to hide funding and thus keep the secret from
     the Congress and the people of the United States.
          It was justified in that it would identify and eliminate the
     weak elements of our society.
          The cost  of funding  the alien connected projects is higher
     than anything you can imagine.
          MJ-12 assassinated  President Kennedy  when he informed them
     that he  was going  to tell the public all the facts of the alien
     presence.
          He was  killed by  the Secret Service agent driving his car,
     and it is plainly visible in the film held from public view.
          A secret meeting place was constructed for MJ-12 in MARYLAND
     and it was described as only accessible by air.
          It contains  full living, recreational, and other facilities
     for MJ-12 and the JASON SOCIETY.
          It is  code named  "THE COUNTRY  CLUB."  Only those with TOP
     SECRET/MAJIC clearance are allowed to go there.
          MAJI is the MAJORITY AGENCY FOR JOINT INTELLIGENCE.
          All information,  disinformation, and  intelligence is gath-
     ered and evaluated by this agency.
          This agency  is responsible for all disinformation and oper-
     ates in  conjunction with  the CIA, NSA, and the Defense Intelli-
     gence Agency.
          This is a very powerful organization, and all alien projects
     are under its control.
          MAJI is responsible only to MJ-12.
          SIGMA is  the project which first established communications
     with the aliens and is still responsible for communications.
          PLATO is  the project  responsible for  diplomatic relations
     with the aliens.
          This project secured a formal treaty (illegal under the Con-
     stitution) with the aliens.
          The terms were that the aliens would give us technology.
          In return,  we agreed  to keep their presence on earth a se-
     cret, not  to interfere in any way with their actions, and to al-
     low them to abduct humans and animals.
          The aliens  agreed to furnish MJ-12 with a list of abductees
     on a periodic basis.
          MAJIC is  the security  classification and  clearance of all
     alien connected material, projects, and information.
          MAJIC means MAJI Controlled.
          AQUARIUS is  a project  which compiled  the history of alien
     presence and their interaction with Homo Sapiens upon this planet
     for the  last 25,000 years and culminating with the Basque people
     who live  in the  mountainous country on the border of France and
     Spain and the Syrians.
          GARNET is  the project responsible for control of all infor-
     mation and documents regarding this subject and accountability of
     the information and documents.
          PLUTO is  a project to evaluate all UFO/IAC information per-
     taining to space tel [TRANSMISSION GARBLED]
          POUNCE is  the project  formed to recover all downed/crashed
     craft and aliens.
          REDLIGHT is the project to test fly recovered alien craft.
 
                                     Page 3
 
 
 
 
          It is conducted at AREA 51 (DREAMLAND) in Nevada.
          It was aided when the aliens gave us craft and helped us fly
     them.
          The initial  project was somewhat successful in that we flew
     a recovered craft, but it blew up in the air, and the pilots were
     killed.
          The project  was suspended  at that  time until  the  aliens
     agreed to help us.
          SNOWBIRD was  established as  a cover  for project REDLIGHT.
     Several flying  saucer type  craft were  built using conventional
     technology.
          They were  unveiled to  the press  and flown in front of the
     press.
          The purpose  was to  explain accidental sightings or disclo-
     sure of REDLIGHT as having been the SNOWBIRD craft.
          LUNA is the alien base on the far side of the Moon.
          It was seen and filmed by the Apollo astronauts.
          A base,  a mining  operation using  very large machines, and
     the very  large alien  craft described  in  sighting  reports  as
     MOTHER SHIPS exist there.
          NRO is the National Recon Organization based at Fort Carson,
     Colorado.
          It is  responsible for security for all alien or alien craft
     connected projects.
          DELTA is  the designation  for the  specific arm of the NRO,
     which is  especially trained  and tasked  with security  of these
     projects.
          JOSHUA is  a project to develop a low frequency pulsed sound
     generating weapon.
          It was  said that this weapon would be effective against the
     alien craft and beam weapons.
          EXCALIBUR is  a weapon  to  destroy  the  alien  underground
     bases.   It is to be a missile capable of penetrating 1000 meters
     of Tuff/hard packed soil such as that found in New Mexico with no
     operational damage.
          Missile apogee not to exceed 30,000 feet AGL and impact must
     not deviate in excess of 50 meters from designated target.
          The device will carry a one-megaton nuclear warhead.
          ALIENS:   There were  four types  of aliens mentioned in the
     papers.   A LARGE  NOSED GREY  with whom  we have the treaty, the
     GREY reported  in abductee  cases that  works for the LARGE NOSED
     GREY, a  blond human  like type  described as  the NORDIC,  a red
     haired human like type called the ORANGE.
          The home of the aliens were described as being a star in the
     Constellation of Orion, Barnards star, and Zeta Riticuli 1&amp;2.
          I cannot remember even under hypnosis which alien belongs to
     which star.
          EBE is  the name or designation given to the live alien cap-
     tured at the 1949 Roswell crash.
          He died in captivity.
          KRLL OR KRLLL OR CRLL OR CRLLL pronounced Crill or Krill was
     the hostage  left with  us at  the first  Holloman landing  as  a
     pledge that  the aliens  would carry  out their part of the basic
     agreement reached during that meeting.
          KRLL gave  us the  foundation of  the yellow  book which was
     completed by the guests at a later date.
          KRLL became sick and was nursed by Dr. G. Mendoza who became
     the expert on alien biology and medicine.  KRLL later died.
          His information  was disseminated  under the  pseudonym O.H.
     Cril or Crill.
 
                                     Page 4
 
 
 
 
          GUESTS were aliens exchanged for humans who gave us the bal-
     ance of the yellow book.
          At the time I saw the information there were only three left
     alive.
          They were called (P's) Alien Life Forms.
          [TRANSMISSION GARBLED]
          RELIGION
          The aliens  claim to  have created  Homo Sapiens through hy-
     bridization.
          The papers said that RH-blood was proof of this.
          They further  claimed to  have created  all four major reli-
     gions.
          They showed  a hologram  of the  crucifixion of Christ which
     the government filmed.
          They claim that Jesus was created by them.
          ALIEN BASES  exist in  the four  corners area  of Utah, Col-
     orado, New Mexico, and Nevada.
          Six bases  were described  in the 1972 papers, all on Indian
     reservations and  all in  the four  corners area.   The base near
     Dulce was one of them.
          MURDER
          The documents  stated that many military and government per-
     sonnel had  been terminated (murdered without due process of law)
     when they had attempted to reveal the secret.
          CRAFT RECOVERIES
          The documents stated that many craft had been recovered.
          The early  ones from  Roswell, Aztec,  Roswell again, Texas,
     Mexico, and other places.
          GENERAL DOOLITTLE  made a  prediction that  one day we would
     have to  reckon with  the aliens, and the document stated that it
     appeared that General Doolittle was correct.
          ABDUCTIONS were occurring long before 1972.
          The document  stated that  humans and animals were being ab-
     ducted and or mutilated.
          Many vanished without a trace.
          They were  taking sperm  and ova  samples, tissue, performed
     surgical operations,  implanted a  spherical device  40 to 80 mi-
     crons in  size near the optic nerve in the brain and all attempts
     to remove it resulted in the death of the patient.
          The document  estimated that one in every 40 people had been
     implanted.
          This implant  was said  to give  the aliens total control of
     that human.
          CONTINGENCY PLAN  SHOULD THE  INFORMATION BECOME  PUBLIC  OR
     SHOULD THE ALIENS ATTEMPT A TAKEOVER.
          This plan  called for a public announcement that a terrorist
     group had entered the United States with an atomic weapon.
          It would  be announced  that the terrorists planned to deto-
     nate the weapon in a major city.
          Martial law  would be declared and all persons with implants
     would be rounded up along with all dissidents and would be placed
     into concentration camps.
          The press,  radio, and  TV would  be nationalized  and  con-
     trolled.   Anyone attempting  to  resist  would  be  arrested  or
     killed.
          CONTINGENCY PLAN TO CONTAIN OR DELAY RELEASE OF INFORMATION
          This plan  called for the use of MAJESTIC TWELVE as a disin-
     formation ploy  to delay  and confuse  the release of information
     should anyone get close to the truth.
          It was  selected because  of the  similarity of spelling and
 
                                     Page 5
 
 
 
 
     the similarity to MJ-12.
          It was  designed to confuse memory and to result in a fruit-
     less search for material that does not exist.
          SOURCE OF MATERIAL CONTAINED IN THE DOCUMENTS WHICH I SAW
          The source  of the  material was an Office of Naval Intelli-
     gence counter-intelligence  operation against  MJ-12 in order for
     the Navy to find out the truth of what was really going on.
          The Navy  (at that  time or  at least the Navy that I worked
     for) were not participants in any of this.
          The different  services and the government conduct this type
     of operation against each other all the time.
          The result  of this  operation was  that the  Navy cut them-
     selves in  for a  piece of the action (technology) and control of
     some projects.
          As you  can see this file is only a little different from my
     previous file.
          Only some  names were  scrambled previously  to confuse  the
     government long  enough for  someone to  verify that  what I have
     said is the truth.
          I have  added information in this file that puts me in abso-
     lute danger.
          I have sent a copy of this file to people all over the coun-
     try and will continue to do so.
          Please get this file into as many hands as you can and maybe
     that will protect me but I doubt it.
          HISTORY WILL  BE THE JUDGE OF ME AND THIS INFORMATION, AND I
     HAVE NO FEAR OF THAT JUDGEMENT.
          I SWEAR  THAT THIS  INFORMATION IS  TRUE AND  CORRECT TO THE
     BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE.
          I wish to thank all those people who have aided me in reach-
     ing this point and for their patience and understanding.
          I owe you all more than I can ever repay.
          Finally, it does not matter who is right and who is wrong or
     if a project name is in the wrong place.
          It does not matter who is working for whom or what is really
     what.
          It should be obvious by now that something sinister and ter-
     ribly wrong is going on involving the government and the UFO phe-
     nomenon.
          We must all band together and expose it now.
          I have done my part in the best manner that I could.
          I can  add nothing else except my testimony in Congress or a
     court of  law that  what I  saw and  have written in this file is
     true and that I saw it.
          Everything in  my previous  file that does not conflict with
     this file  is true  and correct  to the  best of my knowledge and
     some of it is from sources and research.
          You may combine the files to get the entire picture.
          Throw out  only that  information that  conflicts with  that
     contained in this file.
          There will  be no  further additions  or corrections to this
     information either now or in the future.
          My file is complete and stands to be judged by history.
          Sometime in the future the exact papers that I saw will sur-
     face, and  you will  all see  this  exact  information  contained
     within them.

          There is  some thought  that the U.S. Air Force, in conjunc-
     tion with  the Canadians,  has standing  orders to  deny any  UFO
     sightings to the public.
          Timothy  Good,   in  his  book  Above  Top  Secret,  states:
     "Cooperation between  the United States and Canada in the report-
     ing of  UFOs was  laid down,  for example, in the Canadian-United
     States Communications  Instructions for  Reporting Vital Intelli-
     gence Sightings  (CIRVIS) JANAP  146 (E), issued in March 1966 by
     the Joint  Chiefs of Staff as well as the Canadian Defense Staff.
     This  publication   lists  instructions   for  the  reporting  of
     'information of  vital importance  to the  security of the United
     States of America and Canada and their forces, which in the opin-
     ion of the observer, requires very urgent defensive and/or inves-
     tigative action by the U.S. and/or Canadian armed forces.' Sight-
     ings within  the scope  of JANAP 146 include 'Unidentified Flying
     Objects' as  distinct from  'Hostile of  unidentified single air-
     craft or formations of aircraft,' and there are lengthy and elab-
     orate instructions for reporting UFOs" (Good, 192).
          And later he states:  "Because of reports like these [UFOs],
     airline pilots  became subject to military restrictions contained
     in a  Joint Army-Navy-Air  Force Publication (JANAP), drawn up by
     the Joint  Communications-Electronics Committee,  and promulgated
     by the  Joint Chiefs of Staff, and could thus find themselves li-
     able to  a prison term of up to 10 years and/or a fine of $10,000
     if they  discussed their  sightings with  the  media  or  public"
     (Good, 283).

          Stan Barrington offers a document about "Operation Majority,
     which concerns  the dealings of MJ-12.  The following discussion,
     taken from  the alt.conspiracy  section of Usenet, focuses on the
     validity of those documents:
          "What  is   the  latest   status  of   the  MJ-12  documents
     (concerning authenticity)?   I  know that Klass did his usual de-
     bunking job,  but also  read that  Friedman produced all the sup-
     porting evidence  Klass had demanded (similar typefaces in use on
     other documents  of the same era, etc.).  Has the U.S. Government
 
                                     Page 8
 
 
 
 
     taken a  formal position on the MJ-12  documents?  What evidence,
     pro and  con, has  been produced  on the authenticity issue since
     their release.  What are the details of the release?  Any and all
     information will be appreciated.  Thanks."
          The reply  was:   "I don't  know about the U.S. Government's
     position, but  Klass has  done a  pretty good job of showing that
     there is  at least  some fraud  in the papers.  In particular, he
     has shown  that the  supposed signature of Harry Truman on one of
     the critical  papers is  identical to  the signature  on  another
     document in  the National Archives, except that it's (if I recall
     correctly)  3.6  percent  larger.    It  is  impossible  for  two
     signatures to  be identical  unless one is a photographic copy of
     the other,  and interestingly,  most copying  machines do  a very
     small expansion  of what  they copy  to prevent  edge  effects--a
     blow-up of exactly 1.2 percent.  So it would appear this supposed
     signature is  actually a  third-generation photocopy  of Truman's
     signature.   Handwriting experts  have confirmed this.  I believe
     it's written  up in the current (Spring 1990) Skeptical Inquirer,
     but I can't find my copy at the moment so I can't say for sure."
          I don't  know who  Klass or Friedman are, (although Friedman
     may be the same person that was mentioned as a helper in Majestic
     by Whitley  Strieber, and also mentioned as a government official
     in the speech) but the Skeptical Inquirer is a respected paranor-
     mal debunking newspaper put out by James "the Amazing" Randi.
          It also seems to me that the idea that Truman's signature is
     a photocopy of another one in the National Archives is a bit odd.
     There must  be thousands of Truman signature in the Archives, and
     thinking that  someone could  find the one that exactly matched a
     3.6 percent  enlargement is laughable (but then again, those same
     people find the idea of a huge UFO cover-up laughable).
 
                                   * * *
 
          Whitley Strieber  is a  strange character  in this whole af-
     fair.   He is  the writer  of Wolfen  and The Howling, two horror
     novels.  Lately, he turned to writing about UFOs.
          His first  book on  the subject,  Communion, deals  with his
     personal experiences  with abduction  by an  unknown intelligence
     (Strieber always tries to avoid the word "alien," so he can leave
     the options open that these are humans that are traveling through
     time or  even an unknown earthly intelligence).  His second book,
     Transformation, is  not as  familiar to me, but I have heard that
     it is more of the same as Communion, except that it is less well-
     supported and  deals with  a sort  of religion  of  the  unknown.
     Strieber contends  in that  book that  the "others"  (as he calls
     them) gave  him a  sketchy design  for an anti-gravity motor that
     relies on rotating magnets.
          His third  book is Majestic.  Milton William Cooper mentions
     it in his speech.  This book follows the Cooper speech closely in
     many regards;  in fact,  sometimes it  seems like one is stealing
     from the  other because  they are so close.  Strieber writes this
     book as  fiction, but  at the  end there is a section in which he
     says that  the book  is based on truth and that the government is
     hiding information  from the  public.  He insists that this truth
     must be brought out.  However, Cooper says that Strieber is work-
     ing for  the government.  He offers some proof to this claim, but
     he doesn't  really say  why the government would hire Strieber to
     write Majestic, or whether he was hired before he wrote C mmunion
     and Transformation.   All Cooper says is that Strieber is testing
     the waters,  leaking the information in a way that the government
 
                                     Page 9
 
 
 
 
     could deny.
          I think  that if  Strieber works for the government, then it
     is mostly  likely because  the government thinks that people will
     not believe  anything he  writes about UFOs, given his history of
     writing horror.   Thus,  the government  has Strieber write some-
     thing that  is based  on truth,  and everyone thinks it is coming
     from such a bad source that it must be false.
 
                                   * * *
 
          This from Keith Rowell in Oregon:
          "You folks  interested in Strieber's claims should check out
     the book Report on Communion (Morrow, 1989) by Ed Conroy.
          "Conroy is  a San Antonio-based freelance reporter who wrote
     some early articles for the local newspaper and then continued to
     explore and  investigate till  he ended up with a book.  He basi-
     cally concludes  that Strieber's claims are true as far as we now
     understand the UFO phenomenon, which is very far from adequate at
     this time.   (The  scholarly and scientific establishment has yet
     to honestly  and openly embrace the problem of the UFO.  Conroy's
     book is  opening the  way for  the  investigative  media  people,
     though.   Things are changing as the UFO issue just refuses to go
     away.)   You will all hear more and more about the reality status
     of UFOs  as we  go through the 1990s.  Intelligence establishment
     secrecy is  being slowly broken down and the scientific/scholarly
     community is  slowly putting  up less  resistance as the years go
     by.
          "My opinions are based on 15 years of reading the UFO liter-
     ature and  four years  or so of more or less active participation
     in the  UFO community.  It is very hard to understand what is go-
     ing on  in the  UFO community without paying very close attention
     to it.   The  normal sources  of news  and information cover this
     group of  people in  a very  inconsistent and sometimes downright
     biased way.   You're  just going  to have to get your feet wet on
     this one; otherwise, you'll just being talking through your hat.
          "I'll be happy to send via electronic mail my representative
     UFO bibliography  to anyone  who wants it.  Lately, new (and sig-
     nificant) UFO books are added practically monthly in the past few
     years.   UFOs are hot again.  We seem to be in a peak of activity
     again.
          "The latest  significant book  is by Ed Walters on his Gulf-
     breeze UFO/photograph  experiences, being distributed to your lo-
     cal bookstores as I write this."
