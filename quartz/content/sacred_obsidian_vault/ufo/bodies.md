 This should provide a wealth of autopsy evidence on ET body structure and
 workings when accumulated in any one place.  ETs coming from UFOs have strange
 properties, a report:  THE UFO CRASH/RETRIEVAL SYNDROME (STATUS REPORT II:
 NEW SOURCES, NEW DATA) by Leonard H. Stringfield is published by MUTUAL UFO
 NETWORK INC., 103 Oldtowne Road, Sequin Texas 78155.  It has a January 1980
 copyright date.  The report interviews severl medical doctors who did autopsies
 
 on ET bodies from UFO crash sites.  ET had large heads and were around 4 ft.
 tall.  They have small noses and mouths with no ears or hair.  The ET photo
 that I have was taken by an ET and has an eye diameter of an inch.  He has his
 left hand raised in a salute.  That hand has 4 fingers on it with one finger
 twice as long as either outside finger.  The photo was taken at a range of 3 ft
 
 from the waist up.  Brain capacity is 1800 cc versus 1300cc for the average
 human.  The skin is grey or ashen and under the microscope appears meshlike.
 This meshlike appearance gives it the reptilian texture of granular skinned
 lizards like iguana or chameleon.  There was a colorless liguid in the body
 without red cells, no lymphocytes, no hemoglobin.  There was no digestive
 system, intestinal, alimentary canl, or rectal area in the ET autopsy.
 
 
 
 Note:  I got this off of the InterNet from the World Wide Times Area.  I'm not
 sure who put this report together.
 
 ... Will the real alien, please stand up?
