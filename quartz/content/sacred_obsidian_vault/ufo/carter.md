 Things to beware of in 1997:
 
 Gradual acclimation of the public to the idea of 'extraterrestrial
 life', possibly in the form of us somehow being martian progeny, all
 for dubious political ends.

 : Carter/Venus
 
 From: Keith Rowell
 Newsgroups: sci.skeptic
 Subject: Carter's NICAP UFO report verbatim
 Date: 20 Nov 91
 
 
 Read and make what you will of Carter's own words on his NICAP UFO
 report! You dedicated debunkers can breathe a sigh of relief
 because it looks like Venus, but do a little armchair UFO *research*
 anyway and actually read a real, live UFO report -- something none
 of you have done until now I am sure.
 
 The following is a typescript of a facsimile of the form that Jimmy
 Carter filled out for NICAP. The text between asterisks in the form
 is Carter's own words verbatim. I have taken some liberties with the
 format of the form, but the text is accurate. Text found between
 square brackets is my attempt to clarify where there may be some
 ambiguities. The form is found on pages 63-65 in Story, Ronald D. (ed),
 The Encyclopedia of UFOs, (Doubleday, 1980)  ISBN 0-385-11681-0.
 
 Look at Carter's answers to the questions and see if you think he
 and 10 other people were looking at Venus as Robert Sheaffer claims.
 See especially his answer to questions 12 and 20. But note that a Center for
 UFO Studies-sponsored study of 1300 UFO reports has established that
 Venus does indeed account for a lot of sightings. 360 reports fell
 into the category of "stars and planets". See Hendry, Allan, The UFO
 Handbook, (Doubleday, 1979)  ISBN 0-385-14348-6.
