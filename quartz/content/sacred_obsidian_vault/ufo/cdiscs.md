 Interesting Theory of Crashed Discs 12,000 Years Ago
 ====================================================
 
 High in the mountains of BayanKara-Ula, on the borders of China
 and Tibet - a team of archaeologists were conducting a very
 detailed routine survey of a series of interlinked caves.
 
 Their interests had been excited by the discovery of lines of
 neatly arranged graves which contained the skeletons of what
 must have been a strange race of human beings; strange because
 they had unnaturally spindly bodies and large, overdeveloped
 heads.
 
 At first, it had been thought that the caves had been the home
 of a hitherto unknown species of ape. But as the leader of the
 team - the Chinese archeologist, Professor Chi Pu Tei - pointed
 out, "Who ever heard of apes burying each other?"
 
 It was while studying the skeletons that one of the team
 stumbled on a large, round stone disk, half buried in the dust
 on the floor of the cave.
 
 The team gathered round the discovery, turning it this way and
 that.It looked, absurdly, like a kind of 'Stone Age Gramophone
 record'. There was a hole in the centre and a fine, spiral
 groove radiated to the rim.
 
 Closer inspection, however, showed that the groove was, in fact,
 a continuous spiralling line of closely written characters.
 
 The object was a 'record' ... in more ways then one. Only nobody
 at the time - the year was 1938 - possessed the key to its
 incredible message. The disc was labeled and filed away among
 other finds in the area. Even those who knew of its existence
 knew nothing of its meaning.
 
 Many experts tried to translate the hieroglyphics in the 20
 years the disc languished in Peking. They all failed. It was not
 until another professor Dr. Tsum Um Nui broke the code and
 started to decipher the 'speaking grooves' that the
 extraordinary implications of the disc were realized.
 
 Realized, that is, only by only a select few. The outside world
 remained in ignorance. For the professor's conclusions on the
 meaning of the disc were so shattering that they were officially
 suppressed. The Peking Academy of Pre-History forbade him to
 publish his findings.
 
 Two years later, in 1965, the professor and four of his
 colleagues were finally given permission to reveal their theory.
 It appeared under the longwinded but intriguing title, "The
 Grooved Script concerning Space-ships which, as recorded on the
 Discs, landed on Earth 12,000 years ago".
 
 The 'records' - 716 of the grooved discs were later uncovered in
 the same caves - told an astonishing story of a 'space probe' by
 the inhabitants of another planet which came to grief in the
 Bayan-Kara-Ula mountain range.
 
 The strange, spiral script told how the peaceful intentions of
 the 'aliens' had been misunderstood and how many of them were
 hunted down and killed by members of the Ham tribe, who lived in
 the neighboring caves.
 
 According to Tsum Um Nui, one of the lines of the hieroglyphics
 read, "The Dropas came down from the clouds in their aircraft.
 Our men, women and children hid in the caves ten times before
 sunrise. When at last they understood the sign language of the
 Dropas, they realized that the newcomers had peaceful intentions."
 
 Another section expressed 'regret' by the Ham tribe that the
 aliens' spaceship had crash-landed in such a remote and
 inaccessible mountains and that there had been no way to
 building a new one to enable Dropas to return to their own
 planet.
 
 In the years since the discovery of the first disc,
 archaeologists and anthropologists had learned more about the
 isolated Bayan-Kara-Ula area.And much of the information seemed
 to corroborate the bizarre story recorded on the discs.
 
 Legend still preserved in the area spoke of small, gaunt, yellow
 faced men who 'came from the clouds, long, long ago'. The men
 had huge, bulging heads and puny bodies and were so ugly and
 repellent that they were hounded down by local tribesmen on
 horseback. Strangely, the description of the 'invaders' tallied
 with the skeletons originally discovered in the caves by
 Professor Chi Pu Tei.
 
 On the walls of the caves themselves archaeologists had
 uncovered crude pictures of the rising Sun, the Moon,
 unidentifiable stars and the Earth...all joined together by
 lines of pea-sized dots. Along with the discs, the cave drawings
 had been dated around 12,000 years old.
 
 The cave area was still inhabited by two semi-troglodyte tribes
 known as the Hams and the Dropas, themselves extremely odd in
 appearance. The frail and stunted tribesmen averaged only about
 five feet in height and were neither typically Chinese nor
 Tibetan. "Their racial back-ground," said one expert, "is a
 mystery."
 
 But even with the publications of Professor Tsum Um Nui's
 amazing translation, the story of the 'space discs' was not over.
 Russian scientists asked to see the discs and several were sent
 to Moscow for examination.
 
 They were scraped free of rock particles which had stuck to them
 and then put through chemical analysis. To the surprise of the
 scientists, they we found to contain large amounts of cobalt and
 other metallic substances.
 
 That was not all. When placed on a special turntable - according
 to Dr.Vyatcheslav Saizev, who described the experiments in the
 Soviet magazine Sputnik - they vibrated or 'hummed' in an
 unusual rhythm as though an electric charge was passing through
 them. Or as one scientist suggested, "as if they formed some
 part of an electrical circuit." At some time, they had clearly
 been exposed to extraordinarily high voltages.
