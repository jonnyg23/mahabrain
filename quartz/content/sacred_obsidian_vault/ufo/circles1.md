        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        The concepts in  this  document  are  based  on  known  and  current
        technologies and capabilities  as   extrapolated  by  Jerry  Decker,
        Cheyenne Turner, Ron  Barker,  Chuck Henderson, and  brought  up  in
        discussions with various  other  associates  of KeelyNet and Vangard
        Sciences.
 
        It is offered to the public as a  VERY  RATIONAL  alternative to the
        current UFO speculations regarding the crop circles.
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                                Crop Circles a Hoax?
 
        By now, most people are aware of the mysterious crop  circles  which
        have appeared in  England  and  now  are  showing  up  in the United
        States.  The patterns began with simple circles that have now become
        complex patterns including lines and intricate designs.
 
        The circles appear in wheat fields  in the form of wheat stalks that
        are pressed down; usually in a swirling pattern having  rotations in
        either a counter-clockwise or clockwise direction.
 
        Both mystical and pseudo-scientific relationships have been attached
        including :
 
            1)  herds of mating hedgehogs,
            2)  violent atmospheric disturbances,
            3)  lung-mei (earth energies most commonly referred to as dragon
                currents) linked to megalithic sites,
            4)  UFO landing sites
            5)  hoaxers
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                     Specific observations regarding the circles
 
            1)  There  are  NO  vehicle tracks or footprints leading into or
                out of the fields when the circles appear.
 
            2)  The circles appear within  a very short period of time.  The
                best estimate I have seen between creation  and  observation
                of a circle is within an hour.
 
            3)  The circles ALWAYS APPEAR AT NIGHT.
 
 
                                       Page 1
 
            4)  In  some  cases  a  warbling sound and a moving orange light
                precede the  circle  appearance.    Other   cases   cited  a
                whooshing sound.
 
            5)  The crops affected by the circle are sometimes  "woven" in a
                basket weave pattern.
 
            6)  The  affected  crops  are  bent  in a more nearly horizontal
                position and  continue  to  grow  in  that  position  for  a
                considerable time after the circle manifestation.
 
            7)  The  affected  crops  are  bent as if the plant  cells  were
                "melted".  Microscopic  examination  shows  no fracturing or
                breaking of plant cells indicative of forced bending.
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        We have a  multiplicity  of facts  to  consider  which,  when  taken
        together, show a most interesting hypothesis as to a probable cause.
 
        Before going into the hypothesis, let me first state  that  circular
        patterns have been  associated  with  UFO  sightings  for many years
        before Man began launching rockets and satellites into space.
 
        A specific case is that of Billy Meier  in  Switzerland.  Videotapes
        of the patterns  left at alleged landing sights have  three  primary
        features which correlate exactly with the crop circles.  These are :
 
           1)  A swirling pattern (always circluar) appears in grass.
 
           2)  The  grass  grows  in the swirling pattern for several months
               AFTER the alleged landing.
 
           3)  Many of the sites are in secluded  and  highly  remote areas,
               some impossible to access with a vehicle.
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        Prior to the last 3 to 5 years, no UFO trace landing  site had shown
        evidence of any pattern beyond simple circles.
 
        Since the inception  of SDI (the Star Wars program), Man has had the
        capability of projecting  high  intensity   laser   beams   followed
        immediately by EXTREMELY high electrical charges aimed at targets on
        the planet.
 
        SDI uses very high intensity lasers (EXCIMER LASERS) to generate and
        project these beams of UltraViolet light.
 
        High intensity UV  light cohered into laser beams  IONIZES  the  air
        through which the beam passes thus creating a conducting path.
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                                 How Star Wars works
 
        The idea is :
 
           1)  to build up a very high electrical charge in the satellite,
 
           2)  target a structure from space using a weak UV laser
 
 
                                       Page 2
 
           3)  increase  the  amplitude  of the UV laser beam until a highly
               ionized path is created from the satellite to the target
 
           4)  this ionized path acts as an electrical conductor much like a
               wire being thrown from the satellite to the target
 
           5)  the electrical energy is then  transferred  to the laser beam
               path which passes the artificial "lightning" to the target
 
           6)  as  the  electrical  energy  passes  into  the   target,  the
               molecules are   electrostatically   repelled  with  explosive
               velocities causing the target to explode.
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                              The SDI Circle Hypothesis
 
        All cells contain DNA and RNA among other things.  These two complex
        molecules are especially sensitive to UV frequencies in the range of
        260 NM.
                                        * * *
 
        In addition, cells can be "denatured"  or  "melted"  when exposed to
        temperatures in the range of 73 to 77 degrees Celsius.   This causes
        the ladder-like structure of the DNA/RNA to begin to separate.
 
        This is one  of  the reasons high energy sources are so dangerous to
        living systems.  The  energy causes  micro-heating  in  the  DNA/RNA
        which partially "melts" the tissues.
 
        When the heating  is  removed  (and  depending  on   the  degree  of
        melting), the DNA/RNA  will  revert  to the original mirror symmetry
        pattern.
 
        This is not  always  a perfect reversion  to  the  original  pattern
        however.  Sometimes the  patterns  are so distorted  as  to  produce
        mutations in the form of cancer and other diseases.
 
                                        * * *
        Plants also are made up of cells.  If these cells are subjected to a
        high intensity UV  laser,  heating occurs causing the plants to melt
        like plastic at their weakest point, i.e.  the stalk.
 
                                        * * *
        Two dimensional laser displays rely on a device known as an acousto-
        optic modulator.  This is simply a  front surface mirror (reflecting
        only from the exposed side) which vibrates on either  an  X  or  a Y
        axis.
 
        When the modulator  is  driven by a sufficiently fast device (like a
        computer), the laser beam can be reflected off the mirror to paint a
        picture on any  surface.  The flatter  the  surface  (and  the  more
        perpendicular to the beam), the more perfect the reproduction of the
        intended image.
 
        If a UV  laser were to be properly directed from a  space  satellite
        (intended to be  used  for  SDI  purposes),  it  could  quite easily
        "paint" a picture on earth or crops.
 
 
 
                                       Page 3
 
                                        * * *
        Only the crops within the beam would be sufficiently melted to cause
        the bending effect.   That  is  why  microscopic  examination of the
        stalk shows no tearing or cellular rupture as it would be if bent by
        force.
 
                                        * * *
        Now as to  the swirling effect of  the  crop  patterns.   Anytime  a
        charged air mass  is moved, it must necessarily move  air  with  it.
        This effect is  used  commercially  for the production of sound from
        electrostatic speakers.
 
        When the UV laser is being rapidly  directed from the satellite, the
        air WILL follow the pattern and effectively push the  crops into the
        desired direction while  they  are  under the "melting/denaturation"
        process.
 
        This sudden moving of air from a moving  electrostatic  column would
        cause a whooshing sound.
 
        Also, the moving  orange  light  could quite well be  an  electrical
        effect in the form of a plasma.
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
        Some of our  group  find it quite humorous to think that some of the
        SDI people would be playing such  an  elaborate  prank  using such a
        sophisticated means of application.
 
        Chuck Henderson even suggested that the work might be that of one or
        more "hackers" who had broken the access and command  codes  for the
        SDI satellite.
 
        The intriguing thing  about  the  crop  circles is that to date, ALL
        sightings PRIOR to   the  SDI  project;   NEVER   involved   complex
        geometries or patterns beyond a circle shape.
 
        This would follow the UFO landing site theory, that  is  any pattern
        found within the   circle  could  be  landing  gear  or  some  other
        attachment of which we currently know  nothing.   Note that no lines
        or other complex patterns were EVER found before SDI.
 
        I understand that some people had voiced the opinion  that  "if  the
        circles are the work of an intelligent force, then the pattern would
        be more complex."
 
        Another comment was  to the effect that "lines or geometric patterns
        would be highly indicative of an intelligence at work."
 
        Damned if within the next couple  of  weeks,  lines and more complex
        patterns began showing up.  Just as if some SDI (or hacker) had read
        or heard the  media  report  of  such  a  comment  and   courteously
        "obliged" the request.
 
        I (Decker) cannot  help  but  find  a  great  deal  of  humor in the
        MAJORITY of UFO  cases  over  the   past  few  years.   Between  the
        outrageous abductions and the claims of greys eating  humans,  it is
        getting out of  hand,  even  exceeding  my credulity (which has been
        said to be pretty outrageous).
 
                                       Page 4
 
        The TV show  "America's  Funniest Home Videos" had a segment which I
        thought perfectly depicted the majority of UFO "believers" of today.
 
        A viewer took his video camera to  the zoo and trained it on a group
        of penguins standing in front of a dimly lit wall.  He then played a
        very tight flashlight beam on the wall and moved it  back and forth.
        Each time, the penguins would follow as if it were food or something
        of interest.
 
        A most hilarious  effect,  much  like my cat following a laser beam.
        He would even go so far as to hurt  himself while jumping to "catch"
        the moving light.
 
        At any rate,  now that there is a somewhat logical hypothesis  which
        matches and explains a good deal of the phenomena, we can figure out
        a means of proving it.
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                       How to Prove the SDI Circle Hypothesis
 
        Two techniques for  detecting  the  signs of the UV laser would take
        the following form :
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        Technique 1 - use of a camera to automatically record the phenomena
 
            1)  proper filtration and the  use  of  a  film  sensitive to UV
                wavelengths would record the "spotlight" of  the  beam as it
                swept the ground
 
            2)  multiple consecutive and rapid exposures of the UV sensitive
                film should be made to record the movement of the beam as it
                traces the pattern
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        Technique 2 - cloud beam detectors
 
            1)  pressurized  containers  containing  a  powder  or gas which
                emitted visible light in the presence of UV wavelengths
 
            2)  these containers would be  triggered to emit large clouds of
                powder and show the presence of the beam
 
            3)  once the beams were detected, video cameras  could  tape the
                clouds and   show  the  moving  beam  presence  and  pattern
                (depending on the speed)
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        Detection of the presence of the UV laser beam
 
            1)  the whooshing sound creating  by  the moving air as a result
                of the "scanned" beam could be used as a trigger
 
            2)  the abrupt change in the electrostatic potential  due to the
                establishment of  the  conducting path in the immediate area
                could be used as a trigger
 
 
 
                                       Page 5
 
            3)  human spotters to monitor for changes in the ambience of the
                area and manually trigger the recording devices
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
        One of the  reasons I dissociated with ACTIVE participation with the
        UFO movement was the gullibility of  many  of the people involved as
        well as the ridiculousness of many of the stories.
 
        I have met people who have spent as much as 30 years  of their lives
        studying this phenomenon without ONE SHRED OF PHYSICAL PROOF.
 
        After this happens  to you several times, you look at the person and
        think, "How could you throw away your life on such Bullshit!"
 
        Not for ME, I want to make VALID,  REPRODUCIBLE contributions in the
        form of increased  understanding  for myself and others,  preferably
        taking the form of machines or infallible techniques.
 
        Let's face it,  much  of  the WOOFY (airy-fairy) science and much of
        the New Age stuff is pure BS.  If  we can't build a machine to prove
        it, or have  others  duplicate  the  effect,  then  IT  AIN'T  WORTH
        SCREWING WITH!
 
        Don't blow your  life  down the tube, be CRITICAL, be ANALYTICAL and
        read WIDELY so you can see overlapping  patterns.   ASK  for  proof,
        don't take someone's  word  that  they can levitate  or  communicate
        telepathically, or astrally project, or whatever.
 
        If they ask for a "love donation" and they haven't done any physical
        phenomena or shown  a  working  device to produce an unusual effect,
        tell them to piss off and get a job.
 
        Forgive my somewhat negative comments, but on reading this paper, I
        can't help but to stress the value of HEALTHY SKEPTICISM.
 
        I am sending a copy of this paper  to the Koestler Foundation who is
        offering a 5,000 pound reward and the Sunday Mirror  who is offering
        a 10,000 pound reward to anyone who can fully explain the enigma.
 
        You never know,  it  might  win  and COULD WE EVER DO SOMETHING WITH
        THAT MONEY!!!
