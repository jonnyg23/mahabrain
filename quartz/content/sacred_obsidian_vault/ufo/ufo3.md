                         Witnesses marvel at mystery objects
                             by Pat Miller, Staff Writer
 
        It seems that Bemidji wasn't the lone city on the path of last weeks
        unexpected visitor from the sky as craft of similar description were
        sighted in every corner of the area.
 
        Reports of sightings  have  surfaced  from  Park Rapids, Clearbrook,
        Laporte, Zerkel and Turtle River  and  the  common threads among the
        varying accounts are the lack of noise and the shape.
 
        Between 9:30 and  10  p.m.  last  Thursday [August  23,  1990]  Dick
        McLaurie of Bemidji  and  his  son  Tony  were  heading  home from a
        fishing excursion east of Blackduck  when  they  saw  the craft near
        Castle Highlands Golf Course.
 
        We saw them  approaching  us from the direction of  Bemidji  and  we
        pulled over to  watch the show, said McLaurie.  They were about one-
        quarter of a mile away from us and  one-quarter of a mile in the air
        and we watched them for about three or four minutes.
 
        What McLaurie saw  was at least five different objects  shaped  like
        the bullet with  wings  that Julie Knutson described last week.  The
        objects sported a series of light  and they all traveled together in
        a convoy formation.
 
        There were five  or  six  different  vehicles  flying  in  a  group,
        McLaurie recalled.  At  first  they were moving slowly but then they
        started sparking and sped up.  All  of  a sudden all the lights went
        out and the  things really took off in the direction  of  Blackduck.
        They certainly moved faster than any plane I've ever seen.
 
        At 9:50 that  same  evening Tom Crissinger of Northward Ho Resort on
        Long Lake near Park Rapids was among  a group of about 14 people who
        saw a similar display.
 
        They looked like the space shuttle and were about the  size of a big
        jet.  But they didn't make any noise, Crissinger said.  They trailed
        balls of something  like  fire  about  a mile long and over the lake
        they were easy to see.  We also saw  about  20 square windows on the
        side (of the craft) and we kept asking each other  if  anybody  else
        saw the windows.  And everyone did.

        The objects continued over the lake in the direction of Bemidji and
        followed a slowly ascending course.
 
        Greg Gasman of  rural  Laporte also witnessed the show from his back
        yard between 9:30 and 10 p.m.  His  immediate  attention  was  on an
        airplane he could clearly hear and see high in the  sky but when his
        gaze returned earthward  it  was  interrupted  by the sight of three
        unusual visitors low to the ground.
 
        They were almost touching each other  and  each one had front lights
        and back lights,  he said.  The silhouette of each  was  of  a  long
        cylindrical object and they were traveling in a convoy.
 
        Unlike the other   reports   which   had  the  craft  heading  in  a
        northeasterly direction, Gasman's    objects   traveled   from   the
        southeast to the northwest.
 
        They were heading straight for Bemidji and going northwest, he said.
 
        What surprised me the most was that there were no sparks, no sign of
        what propelled them, and they made no noise.  It  was  a  very quiet
        night but still they didn't make a sound.

        Additional articles appeared in The Pioneer on August 26, 28, and 30
        with similar information.
 
        Other persons sighting  the  craft were Wayne Bitz and Dave Mathisen
        of Bemidji, Diane Wagner from the  east  side  of Big Bass Lake, and
        Jami Knutson, 11-year-old daughter of Julie Knutson  of Bemidji, and
        NORAD tracked the object on radar.
 
                                    ____________
 
 
        Here is an interesting quote from the August 28 story:
 
             "The official  word on the mysterious lights which were visible
              over the Bemidji area Thursday night is (probably) a returning
              rocket body  that  decayed   in   space   and   reentered  the
              atmosphere."
 
        That explanation was offered by Major David Griffard  of  the  North
        American Air Defense Command based at Peterson Air Force Base near
        Colorado Springs, Colo.
 
        He said he  cannot  disclose  other information about the rocket but
        said NORAD received  calls  from   Minnesota,  South  Dakota,  North
        Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming and Trinidad about the object.
 
        A spokesman from the Grand Forks Air Base said that  no  planes from
        that base were  in  the  air  Thursday  evening  and the objects the
        Knutson's saw did not have their roots at the base.
