                     The Milton William Cooper Speech
 
 
     Editor's note:   What follows is a transcript of a 45-minute lec-
     ture given  by Milton William Cooper on November 17, 1989, at the
     "Whole Life  Expo" in  Los Angeles,  Calif.  His speech was tran-
     scribed word-for-word from a microcassette recording.
 
          "For those of you who don't know who I am, I was raised in a
     military family.   My  family, my  ancestors, since  they came to
     this country, have been government people.  We have served in the
 
                                     Page 1
 
 
 
 
     military, we  have been patriots, we have fought in all the wars,
     we care about this country and believe in the constitution of the
     United States.  We know, as many people don't know, that the Con-
     stitution of the United States of America is the United States of
     America! And  that's why we've always been ready to do the things
     needed to preserve and protect it.
          "When I  left home  I went into the Air Force, the Strategic
     Air Command.  As a child I'd heard stories from my father and pi-
     lots, other  pilots, my  father was  a pilot, about Foo Fighters,
     UFOs, strange  craft that  were not made on this Earth.  And as a
     kid, you  hear that  in passing,  and it's  neat, and  you giggle
     about it, and you go out and play 'Space Man,' and you forget it.
          "When I  was in the Air Force I met men who had participated
     in alien crashed-craft recoveries.  Now this intrigued me, it in-
     terested me, but it was usually after quite a few bottles of beer
     that these stories would come out, and sometimes the next morning
     I couldn't remember what the heck the guy said.
          "When I left the Air Force I went into the Navy, and this is
     where everything  began to  happen for  me.  I had originally in-
     tended to  just go  from service to service and do something that
     very few people have ever done before.  I was a very adventurous,
     very crazy  ... young  man, and  I thought  that that  would be a
     pretty exciting life.  I volunteered for submarines, and while on
     the submarine  USS Tyroot, SS-416, on a transit between the Port-
     land/Seattle area  and Pearl Harbor, which was our home port; the
     Pearl Harbor sub base, as the port lookout I saw a craft, saucer-
     shaped, the size of a Midway class carrier, aircraft carrier, for
     those of  you who  don't know how big that is; it's huge, come up
     out of  the water approximately two and a half nautical miles off
     the port bow, which is about 45 degrees to the left of the pointy
     end of  the submarine.   It  tumbled slowly  on its own axis, and
     went up  into the  clouds.  It appeared to be moving slowly to me
     at a distance of two and a half nautical miles, but in reality it
     was moving pretty fast because it came up out of the water, did a
     few tumbles, and it was gone!
          "I then  reported it  to the  officer of the deck.  I didn't
     tell him  what it was that I saw because my Daddy didn't raise no
     fools and in case nobody else saw it I didn't want to be the only
     looney on  board the ship.  So I asked the officer of the deck to
     help me cover that area, and he did, which is common for officers
     and lookouts  to help  each other  while on  bridge watch because
     they all  hang together  if something  bad happens.   After a few
     seconds of  watching, the  same craft,  or another  craft exactly
     like it,  came down  out of  the clouds, tumbled again on its own
     axis, and  went into the water.  Ensign Ball, who was the officer
     of the  deck, was  literally shocked!   What could I say?  Seaman
     Dejeralimo, who  was the  starboard lookout,  had also  witnessed
     this, and  Ensign Ball  called the  captain to the bridge who was
     followed by  the chief  quartermaster who  brought a 35MM camera,
     and we  watched for  between seven and 10 minutes the same craft,
     or different craft that looked exactly alike, enter and leave the
     water.   It was an incredible show.  I don't know if they knew we
     were there,  or if  they even  cared, but the craft did not glow,
     they were  metal, they  were machines  without a doubt, they were
     obviously intelligently  guided, they  were huge, and having been
     in the  Air Force  and the Navy and knowing what it takes, I knew
     without a  doubt, and  know it  today, that  that machine was not
     made on the face of this earth.  Because there's nothing that man
     can make, that can fly through the air at a speed like that, tum-
     ble on  its own axis, and enter the water and effectively fly be-

     neath the sea.
          "If you've ever been aboard an airplane and then gone aboard
     a submarine, I know there's probably some of you in this room who
     have visited  a submarine at one time or another, you can readily
     see just without even any of the technicalities involved how dif-
     ficult such  a thing  would be  to do.   Where would it be built,
     that size?  It was absolutely incredible.  It changed my life be-
     cause then all the stories that I'd heard all my life I knew were
     true, and I began seeing the world in a different light.
          "It wasn't  long after  that I was trained by Naval security
     in intelligence.  I was sent to Vietnam.  I was assigned as a pa-
     trol boat  captain, first in DaNang harbor, given a crew, given a
     multi-million dollar  patrol boat.  My job was to gather intelli-
     gence from the people who lived around the harbor and the fisher-
     men who  transited the  harbor, and maintain the safety and secu-
     rity of  the harbor  and the shipping.  After about five months I
     was sent  up North  to the DMZ, to a place called Qua Vieaf [sp],
     on the  Tacan [sp]  river.  Our base camp was at the river mouth.
     We were only three miles south of the North Vietnamese border and
     our job  was to  patrol the  Tacan river  from the river mouth to
     Dang Ha  [sp], and  then up  the Quang  Tree [sp] cutoff to Quang
     Tree city,  again to  get to  know the people on the bank, gather
     intelligence, and  to patrol  every night and maintain the safety
     and security of the river and the river traffic.
          "It was  while there  that I  discovered that  there  was  a
     tremendous amount  of UFO  and alien activity in Vietnam.  It was
     always reported  in official messages as 'enemy helicopters.' Now
     any of  you who know anything about the Vietnam war know that the
     North Vietnamese  did not  have any helicopters, especially after
     our first  couple of  air raids into North Vietnam.  Even if they
     had they would not have been so foolish as to bring them over the
     DMZ because  that would  have insured  their demise.   Our troops
     were fired  on occasionally  by these  'enemy helicopters,' enemy
     troops were  fired on  occasionally by these 'enemy helicopters,'
     and occasionally  people would  disappear.   And on  one instance
     that I  know for sure at least one entire village disappeared one
     night because  of alien  activity.  The reason they used the term
     'enemy helicopters'  in messages and dispatches was that in Viet-
     nam you  could be overrun at any time, no matter where you where.
     They did  not bring  crypto encoding  equipment into Vietnam, I'm
     talking about  the machinery.   What  we did is we had crypto ta-
     bles, and  once we  every 24  hours those codes would be no good.
     So that's what we used.  We also, because of the inability to use
     crypto transmitting  equipment, had  to devise code words such as
     'enemy helicopters.'
          "When I  left Vietnam I was eventually attached to the head-
     quarters staff of the Commander in Chief of the United States Pa-
     cific Fleet  at Macalappa,  [sp] Hawaii,  which is  a little hill
     overlooking Pearl  Harbor, it's  a beautiful  white  building  up
     there, and I was specifically attached to the Intelligence Brief-
     ing Team  of the  Commander in Chief of the United States Pacific
     Fleet.
          "It was  during this  tour of duty that, in the course of my
     duties, documents  were placed in my hands that were so unbeliev-
     able and so incredible that it took me quite a while to adjust to
     the fact  that what  I was seeing was real.  Now for those of you
     who don't  understand how  I could  come to see this information,
     let me  give you  a little short course in security clearance and
     the need to know and how you get to see classified information if
     you're in  the military  or in  the government, it doesn't matter
 
                                     Page 3
 
 
 
 
     which, the rules are the same.
          "No. 1,  you need  a security  clearance, and  you've got to
     have clearance  at the level that the information you want to see
     is classified  at.   In this  instance it was classified 'Top Se-
     cret, Magic,  Restricted Information,'  which I  came to find out
     later is  the highest  security classification in the Nation.  To
     get that type of clearance, all you have to have is a Federal Bu-
     reau of  Investigation background  check, which  takes about  six
     months and  they send  federal agents  to your  home, to your old
     schools, to  all your teachers, to your friends, to everybody you
     put down  on your  security clearance  forms, to all your old ad-
     dresses, your  neighbors, everybody  that you've  worked for, and
     it's embarrassing  because they  don't  tell  them  what  they're
     checking on.   They just show them their identification and start
     asking questions  and that's  when you find out who's your friend
     and who's  not, because  a lot  of people  get scared  and think,
     'Bill just robbed a bank and I'm not talking to him anymore.'
          "Now once you get that it's called a 'B.I.' and for those of
     you who  have received  a copy  of my  service record look on the
     first page,  the DD-214  where it  says 'Security Clearance,' you
     will see  the term  'B.I.' That's  a  'Bureau  of  Investigation'
     clearance.   Now at that point, you have the clearance for every-
     thing including  Top Secret  and above.  What determines what you
     get to see is your need to know, and the job that you have deter-
     mines what your need to know is.
          "I was  assigned to  the Intelligence  Briefing Team  of the
     Commander in Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, who had to
     know everything  concerning his  area of operations which was one
     half of the Earth's surface; the Indian ocean, the Pacific ocean,
     and all  the land masses in between.  Believe it or not, if we go
     to war,  if we  ever go  to war, it's the United States Navy that
     strikes the  first blow  and attempts  to keep  the enemy  at bay
     while we  can get ourselves together, at least historically.  Nu-
     clear weapons have kind of done away with that concept, but mili-
     tary commanders like to talk about it anyway.
          "Because of  this, and  you have no conception of the amount
     of material  and information  that an area commander has to know;
     it's unbelievable,  and he  has to  keep track of this, he has to
     keep on  top of  it.   He has to know what's happening; he has to
     make the right decisions.  Because it's almost humanly impossible
     for anyone  to do  that, they have what's called a briefing team,
     and it's  our job  to make  sure that he has the correct informa-
     tion, all  the time,  on a 24-hour basis.  And every morning, be-
     tween 8 and 9 a.m., we would give a briefing which covered every-
     thing that  happened in  the previous  24 hours,  and  everything
     scheduled to  happen in  the next 24 hours, and all the pertinent
     intelligence reports that we had received since the last briefing
     that he needed to know and that his staff members needed to know.
     Occasionally we would get messages marked 'Top Secret, Magic, Re-
     stricted Information,'  and it  would be coded in such a way that
     all you  had were answers to questions which you didn't know what
     the questions were so you really didn't know what the message was
     all about.
          "But eventually  I found  myself in  possession, holding two
     documents;  one  called  'Project  Grudge,'  another  one  called
     'Operation Majority.'  Project Grudge  contained the  history  of
     alien involvement  since around  1936, and it began talking about
     Germany's involvement with a crashed disk that they had recovered
     in 1936  and were  attempting to  duplicate the technology.  They
     were not  successful despite  what all these Nazi hunters want to
 
                                     Page 4
 
 
 
 
     tell you.  If they had been successful, we would not have won the
     war, because  you cannot  beat those  weapons! You cannot out fly
     those craft, you can't even think about it with conventional air-
     craft.   If Germany had been successful, we would now have a Ger-
     man flag up in front of this podium.
          "They did  make some headway.  When we went into Punta Mundy
     [sp] we  captured documents,  we got some scientists, we got some
     hardware.  The Russians also got some documents, some scientists,
     and some  hardware.   It wasn't  until 1947  that we were able to
     capture a  craft, ral together but it was ev-
     erything.   And that  occurred near the city of Roswell, New Mex-
     ico.   There were  dead aliens recovered from the craft.  In Pro-
     ject Grudge I saw photographs of these dead aliens, of the craft;
     I saw photographs of live aliens; I saw photographs of autopsies,
     internal organs; I saw photographs of the alien designated 'E.B.'
     [or Ebe],  which was  held in  captivity from  1949 until June 2,
     1952, when he died.  I saw the history of what they had been able
     to at  that time put together, from incidents in the 1800s, which
     involved aliens and their craft.
          "I saw  the names  of projects.  I saw a project that was to
     fly recovered  alien craft that had been recovered intact and un-
     damaged, and  some of  them were  recovered intact and undamaged,
     and how  that happened  I have  no idea.   It was called 'Project
     Redlight,' and first was conducted from the Tonopah test range in
     the Nevada  test sight  and then  was moved  to a specially built
     area, ordered  built by  president Eisenhower,  called 'Area-51,'
     code named  'Dreamland,' in  the Groom  [sp] dry lake area of the
     Nevada test  sight, by  secret executive order.  It doesn't exist
     officially, if  you ask  anyone, or  if you  write letters to the
     government they  will tell  you it doesn't exist.  However if you
     go out there at several places and see it, fly outside the bound-
     aries and  look down and see it, you know it's there, but accord-
     ing to the government it doesn't exist.
          "The project to fly, test fly these craft, was ongoing until
     sometime in  1962 when  a craft  blew up  not far  from the  test
     sight, in  the air, and the explosion was seen over a three-state
     area.  The pilots were killed, they had no idea what had happened
     or why  the craft  blew up, but they put Project Redlight on hold
     until a  later date  when the aliens supplied us with three craft
     and personnel to help us learn how to fly these craft.  That pro-
     ject is ongoing, and we now have not only alien craft that we are
     flying, we  have craft we have built, using the captured technol-
     ogy, and some of the UFOs that people report seeing in the United
     States, and maybe even elsewhere, are flown by United States per-
     sonnel.
          "That may  come as  a shock  to you.  We have technology way
     beyond the limits of what we have been told.  A lot of our devel-
     opment technologically,  since the  end of World War II, has been
     due to the exchange of technology which occurs in the area called
     'Area-51' on a regular basis ... ongoing.
          "When James  Oberth, Professor  Oberth retired,  many of you
     don't know who he is ... not too many space people in here.  Pro-
     fessor Oberth  was probably one of the greatest rocket scientists
     and space  commentators that  ever lived.   When  he retired, the
     government gave  him a  special award,  there was a press confer-
     ence, all kinds of ceremony, and when he got up to speak he said,
     'Gentlemen,' and  I quote  Professor Oberth, he said, 'Gentlemen,
     we cannot take credit for all the technological developments that
     we have  had in  the last  decade.  We have had help,' and that's
     where he stopped.
 
                                     Page 5
 
 
 
 
          "One of  the reporters  raised his hand and said, 'Professor
     Oberth, can you tell us what other country helped us?'
          "He said,  'It was those little guys from out in space,' and
     then he got down and would not comment any further.  Now this oc-
     curred in 1959.  I can go on and on, but time doesn't allow it.
          "I will  tell you  ladies and  gentlemen that  there are all
     kinds of  things going  on all  the time,  we  are  making  rapid
     progress in  exposing this.   Since  I have begun talking, people
     have been  coming out  of the  woodwork at a rapid rate, who know
     and have  pieces of this puzzle, and are helping us to put it to-
     gether, because I don't have all the answers.  I saw an awful lot
     of material,  I have remembered an awful lot of it, I have proba-
     bly, in  my remembering,  made some mistakes, and I guarantee you
     they're minor ones, if I have.
          "We have  just recently, for those of you who didn't believe
     that the  Jason Society  of the Jason Scholars, the secret group,
     existed, we now have a letter from the Pentagon, with 51 names of
     the Jason Scholars, an admission from the Pentagon that they hold
     the highest  security clearances in the nation, an admission from
     the Pentagon  that they  hold the  protocol rank of Rear Admiral,
     and are  treated as  such on  any military installation or in any
     government office.   There  are six  Nobel Prize  winners on that
     list, there  are the  elite of the elite of the scientific world,
     they are  the only ones who really know the truth about the tech-
     nology today  and about  the real science of physics, because the
     one that  we're being  taught all  the time  ... If you send your
     kids to  college to  learn physics  you're wasting your money be-
     cause they're  teaching them  stuff that  doesn't work,  it's not
     true, it's  not real.  Gravity is not what we think it is.  There
     is a  Unified Theory! We already know what it is; it's what makes
     these craft work.  It's absolutely incredible what's going on.
          "How many  of you  keep up with Billy Goodman's show on KVEG
     out of  Las Vegas? For those of you who don't, I would try tuning
     in on  any night  between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m.  It's 840 on your AM
     dial, and  the subject  every night  are those  subjects that  no
     other media person in the United States will touch with a 10-foot
     pole, every  single night  except Saturday  night.  It's the only
     show that  you can call in and talk to another caller, you've got
     three minutes  to say  whatever you  want to  say as  long as you
     don't cuss  or swear  or slander  anyone, and every night they're
     helping to expose this.
          "When John  Lear and  I first  said what was going on out at
     Groom Lake everybody said, 'You're nuts, there's nothing going on
     out at Groom Lake!' The listeners of the Billy Goodman radio show
     put together an excursion and went up to Groom Lake and they all,
     ever since, every night, they go up there and watch them test fly
     the alien  craft ...  every night!  The first  night they had 100
     people there.   And  100 people  saw four  alien craft fly, doing
     things that no airplane and no helicopter can do.  Now they don't
     tell us  anymore that  there's nothing  happening at  Groom Lake.
     What they  tell us  now is  there's no such thing as aliens, it's
     all government  secret projects.   That's  OK because we'll prove
     that wrong  too eventually, it just takes a while.  Because where
     we were  ... it's  not where we're at, and I'm really happy about
     that.
          "Now, if  you want  to see  what's happening right now, keep
     watching your  movies, keep watching your television commercials,
     your  alien  programs  on  television,  read  Whitley  Strieber's
     Majestic,  which  is  a  part  of  the  contingency  plan  called
     'Majestic' to test the reaction of the population to the presence
 
                                     Page 6
 
 
 
 
     of aliens  on the  Earth.   And I  have just finished my study of
     Whitley Strieber's book Majestic, and I'm going to tell you right
     now that  most of  the documents  in  there,  that  he  says  are
     fiction, are  real documents  that  came  right  out  of  Project
     Grudge.  It is part of the government's campaign to leak informa-
     tion out  in ways  that they  can always  deny  that  it's  real.
     There's only  one thing  wrong with the information in that book,
     the stories  of the  characters in  there I  know nothing  about.
     What I'm talking about are the supposed government documents that
     he has  in that  book.   I'm telling  you tonight  they're  real.
     Those are some of the same documents that I saw in Project Grudge
     back between  1970 and  1973, and  where we have wondered before,
     now we  know that Whitley Strieber is working for the government.
     And we had a suspicion anyway because in the front of his book he
     states that  he got  information and  was helped  by the research
     team of  Moore, Shanderey,  and Friedman.  William Moore has pub-
     licly admitted on July 1 that he is an agent of the United States
     Government, and we know that the others are too.
          "This is  going to come out, and the reason they're doing it
     the way  they're doing it is they know eventually you're going to
     find out  that it's all true and real.  They're desensitizing you
     so that  you're not shocked, so that there's no collapse of soci-
     ety as  we know  it, so that the religious structure doesn't fall
     to pieces,  so that  the stock  market doesn't  go crazy, because
     these were  their original fears.  Now, there's nothing we can do
     about the last one because it's already happened, there will be a
     segment of  the population  that worships the aliens, even though
     they're no  different than  us; they're just from somewhere else,
     and they  may look  a little  different.  They are not gods.  But
     there are already people worshiping the aliens and they predicted
     this would happen when they slapped the secret stamp all over all
     this stuff.
          "You know,  there's really  nothing wrong  with what's  been
     happening except for three things.  [Cooper forgot to mention the
     third thing,  or was  sidetracked, or included it into the second
     thing.]
          "No. 1,  when they  decided to keep it secret they needed to
     finance it,  they couldn't tell the public, so they couldn't tell
     Congress.   They decided to finance it with the sale, importation
     and sale,  of drugs.  Now in the documents that I read, in Opera-
     tion Majority,  it specifically  stated that when George Bush was
     the president and CEO of Sapata [sp] Oil, he, in conjunction with
     the CIA,  organized the  first large-scale  drug importation into
     this country  from South  and Central America by fishing boat, to
     the offshore  oil platforms  of Sapata  Oil, and  then from there
     into the  beach, thus  bypassing all Customs inspections and law-
     enforcement inspections  of any kind.  They are still bringing in
     drugs, to a limited extent, in this manner.  Another manner is by
     CIA contract  aircraft which,  one of  their bases  of landing is
     Homestead [sp]  Air Force  Base in  Florida.   We have affidavits
     from air  controllers who  have vectored  the planes in, who have
     made sure  that they're  not interfered with in any way.  We have
     affidavits from personnel at Homestead Air Force Base who say the
     planes have  been met  by Jeb Bush, who is George Bush's son.  We
     have affidavits  from people  who work  in the Gulf of Mexico, in
     the offshore  oil business, that yes indeed, the drugs are coming
     in, at least some of them, from the offshore oil platforms."
          From the audience came a clear statement, "Just say no?"
          "Pardon?   Right! Just Say No!  Well that's what we're going
     to do  ladies and  gentlemen with your help.  We are going to say
 
                                     Page 7
 
 
 
 
     no, no  more! And you have to do it, you have to act.  You either
     have to act or watch your country go down the tubes.
          "Now, that's one of the things that's wrong.  The next thing
     that's wrong  is, to keep the secret, they killed a lot of people
     who tried to leak it out.  And if I hadn't done it the way that I
     did it, you wouldn't be seeing me anywhere standing or walking on
     this Earth  now.   They killed  President Kennedy  and during the
     workshop, for  those of  you haven't  seen the  tape, I will show
     you, on  the tape,  who shot  the president and why.  Between '70
     and '73,  in Operation Majority it stated verbatim that President
     Kennedy ordered  MJ-12 to cease the importation and sale of drugs
     to the  American people, that he ordered them to implement a plan
     to reveal  the presence  of aliens  to the American people within
     the following  year.  His assassination was ordered by the policy
     committee of  the Vilderbergers.   MJ-12 implemented the plan and
     carried it  out in  Dallas.  It involved agents of the CIA, Divi-
     sion-5 of  the FBI,  the Secret  Service, and the Office of Naval
     Intelligence.   President Kennedy was killed by the driver of his
     car, his  name was  William Greer, he used a recoilless, electri-
     cally operated,  gas-powered assassination  pistol that  was spe-
     cially built by the CIA to assassinate people at close range.  It
     fired an explosive pellet which injected a large amount of shell-
     fish poison into the brain, and that is why, in the documents, it
     stated that  President Kennedy's  brain was  removed.   If you've
     studied the  case, you  will find  that indeed  his brain  disap-
     peared.   The reason  for that is so that they would not find the
     particles of  the exploding pellet or the shellfish poison in his
     brain which would have proved conclusively that Lee Harvey Oswald
     was not  the assassin.   In fact, Lee Harvey Oswald never fired a
     shot, he was the patsy."
          Mr. Cooper  paused briefly, and a lady in the audience asked
     the obvious question, "Why haven't you been assassinated?"
          "If they  were to  kill me right now, what would you think?"
     Cooper posed.
          "That it's the truth," several people chimed.
          "I've got  them right  where I want them.  If they touch me,
     everyone who has ever heard me talk is going to be absolutely en-
     raged and is going to know that everything I've said is true.  As
     long as  they don't  touch me there's going to be some of you who
     are always  going to be wondering.  But eventually we're going to
     bring enough  proof out,  and if  you're here during the workshop
     you're going  to see  an awful lot of it that's going to prove to
     you that it's true.  It's real.  And it's happening!
          "Okay, I've tried to cover a lot of stuff, just briefly, be-
     cause there's  no time  in 45  minutes to  get into anything very
     much."
          Mr. Cooper then announced the scheduled workshop session the
     following day  in which  tangible proofs  could be  seen but  the
     transcriber was unable to attend.  He then opened up the floor to
     questions and answers.
          A muffled question was barely heard coming from the front of
     the room,  which in  essence asked, "What about all the people in
     the press  and others who were in Dallas and who saw the assassi-
     nation? Couldn't  they tell where the shot came from?  Why didn't
     they come forward? There must have been plenty."
          "There was,  we know that there was at least 18 who were all
     murdered within two years of the event.  The odds of that happen-
     ing are 1 ,000 trillion," Cooper replied.
          Again a  muffled question, "Why did the driver have to shoot
     Kennedy?"
 
                                     Page 8
 
 
 
 
          "Because the other fools missed! There were a total of three
     shots fired  at President  Kennedy, one hit him in the throat and
     didn't kill  him and two of them hit John Connelly [sp].  The one
     that was  fired from  the grassy  knoll hit  the president in the
     throat.  The other two shots came from directly behind the limou-
     sine, not  the school  book depository building, and hit Governor
     Connelly.   Governor Connelly, in intelligence community circles,
     is known  as a  'can do'  man, because he took two hits and still
     kept his mouth shut."
          "How is  it that the driver, sitting on the front, left-hand
     side of  the car was able to blow off the right side of Kennedy's
     brain when the bullet actually entered in, and it would have been
     virtually impossible ..." another person asked.
          Mr. Cooper  seized the  gist of  his question  and injected,
     "For those  of you who have been listening to all these talk show
     hosts, whose  job it  is to be a talk show host, and who have not
     done any  legitimate research into this, if you come to the work-
     shop, I  will show  you, on  the tape, how it was done.  You will
     see that  Kennedy was,  in fact  slumped over against Jackie, his
     head was turned [this direction], it was very simple, it was easy
     and you will see it with your own eyes."
          Another muffled,  off-mike question from a member of the au-
     dience inquiring why no one else had come forward with the infor-
     mation Mr.  Cooper was  disseminating, and  why those who knew it
     had kept  it secret  for so long was quickly answered, "It hasn't
     been, I'm  talking about  it now.  Bill English was talking about
     it eight  years ago, but everybody laughed at Bill English.  John
     Lear's been  talking about  it for  three  years,  and  everybody
     laughed at  him.   Now there's  so many  people have been talking
     about it,  people are  starting to  listen, and  it's about time.
     Because it's  about time  we that we quit being fools, and that's
     exactly what  they think  we are,  and we  prove it to them every
     day."
          The next  question dealt with the alien technology and asked
     in essence, "Hasn't any one else [other than the government] come
     up with the energy technology that the aliens have?" to which Mr.
     Cooper answered,  "There's been quite a few people who've come up
     with it and they've all been stopped, and they'll all continue to
     be stopped.  Because once you have it you have free energy.  Once
     you have free energy they no longer have power over you.  You un-
     derstand?  That's why they stop it."
          Another question  asking, "In the film of the assassination,
     which was  examined greatly  by experts, why didn't they conclude
     that Kennedy's driver shot him?" to which Cooper asked, "Examined
     by whom greatly?  Most of the film that you can purchase has that
     segment cut out, and you can always tell it by the person running
     in the  background, they'll  run up  to here  ... all of a sudden
     they'll be  down here  ... running.   You will see in most of the
     clips that  you've ever  seen on television, or in the movies, or
     that you're  able to  get your hands on, you'll see William Greer
     start to  turn like this ..." then a muffled comment from the au-
     dience, then  Cooper answered,  "That's because  they clipped  it
     out! And  on a  lot of them, I'll bet you most of you, every time
     you've seen  the clip  on television,  never looked at the driver
     anyway.   If you're really honest with yourself, and with me, you
     know your eyes were right on Kennedy."
          A woman  asked if any of the alien technology was being used
     in present-day military equipment and was answered, "Yes, there's
     a lot of alien technology contained in the Stealth bomber, that's
     right.   The Stealth  fighter was  flying for 10 years before you
 
                                     Page 9
 
 
 
 
     even knew it existed."
          As the hour drew late another question, more clearly stated,
     was asked  of Mr.  Cooper, "Before  you let  us all  out of here,
     there's a  bunch of  us here wondering what can we all do to help
     bring this all out?"
          A single  word, "revolt,"  issued from several listeners si-
     multaneously, but Cooper responded, "Don't revolt.  What you need
     to do  is what you should have been doing all along.  You need to
     get involved  with your  government.  The first thing you need to
     do is purchase a copy of the Constitution, which I know that most
     of you  don't have  anywhere in  your house,  and if I were to go
     around this  room and ask each person what the Constitution says,
     most of you couldn't tell me what the Constitution says from your
     grocery bill.   And  that's the truth!  And that is your country!
     So if  you don't  know what  your Constitution is you're dead al-
     ready, so  the first  thing you do is you get a copy of your Con-
     stitution.   The second  thing you  do is you learn it! The third
     thing you  do is  you start calling your senators and your repre-
     sentatives, and  the President of the United States and you start
     leaning on them, and you tell them, 'Unless you straighten up the
     government, and unless we start getting the truth, and I mean the
     whole truth,  and no  more of  this baloney, this is the last job
     you're ever  going to have, period.  And I'll do everything in my
     power to  make sure  that comes  true.' And then write them, fre-
     quently, saying  the same  thing.   And then when they're in your
     area, in  their area offices, take a little delegation and go see
     them, and make them understand that they're going to be living in
     poverty because  they're not  going to  have a  job anymore  come
     election day.   You see, the secret government may own the -
     tive branch,  but you people, all of us, we own the Congress, and
     the Congress makes the laws, and the Congress can impeach the en-
     tire executive  branch!   You also have the right to petition the
     government for  a redress  of injuries.   So  you  are  powerful,
     you've just forgotten that you're powerful, you've forgotten that
     that vote  that you  haven't been doing every time election comes
     around, that  vote has  abdicated your  power.  That vote you did
     not cast  abdicated your  power and gave it to those who are sub-
     verting the Constitution and are ruining this country."
          A gentleman  then asked,  "What was traded to the aliens for
     their technology?"
          "People and animals," replied Cooper succinctly.
          Another man asked, "Is the Soviet Union in on any of this?"
          "The Soviet Union and the United States of America have been
     close allies  since the end of World War II and have been closely
     participating in the secret space program all this time.  The So-
     viets have  the same  thing we have, yes.  What you see happening
     in the  Soviet block right now is not the result of people stand-
     ing up  and saying,  'We want to be free.' It's the result of the
     international bankers  saying, 'You tear down these barriers, and
     you meet  the West  half way,  give your people some freedom, the
     West is going to take some freedom away from their people so that
     we can  put together a one-world economic system ... and have all
     the power.   That's  what's happening!   If you don't believe it,
     stick around and watch it!"
          A dubious  woman then  asked, "Why  was the shellfish poison
     necessary?  A lot of his brain was blown off anyway."
          Cooper:   "The shellfish poison?  If you go to kill someone,
     one thing  I've learned, I learned it real good, I learned it es-
     pecially good  when I  went to  Vietnam; just  because you  shoot
     someone doesn't  mean they're  going to  die.   And if they don't
 
                                    Page 10
 
 
 
 
     die, they're  going to  be mad.  And if they've got a gun, you're
     dead.  So you want the first time to be the last time.  So if you
     really want  to kill  somebody you don't play around.  If you re-
     ally want to kill somebody ... you kill them, you don't play, you
     make sure  that when you shoot them, they're dead.  That way they
     can't hurt you, can't hurt you at all."
          Regrettably, the  next question  was totally unintelligible,
     but thankfully Mr. Cooper had a good public address system to am-
     plify his  reply, "The first moon landing was May 22, 1962 ... or
     excuse me,  that was  the first  landing on Mars.  I'm sorry, May
     22, 1962,  was the  winged probe that used a hydrozine propeller,
     flew around  approximately three  orbits and  landed on  May  22,
     1962, was a joint United States/Russian endeavor.  The first time
     that we  landed on  the moon was sometime during the ... probably
     middle 50s,  because at  the time  when President  Kennedy stated
     that he  wanted a  man to  set foot on the moon by the end of the
     decade we already had a base there."
          "What about Mars?" came another quick question.
          "We have a base on Mars also," Cooper calmly replied.
          "When did that happen?"
          "I don't  know the exact date but I know the project's name,
     it was 'Adam and Eve.'"
          "How long have you known about this?"
          "Well, I  revealed it publicly for the first time on July 2,
     1989, and  within three weeks of the time I revealed it publicly,
     the government,  to get  the American people not to listen to me,
     came out  and said  that they planned to build a base on the moon
     and a  colony on  Mars.   Now, three  days previous to my speech,
     representatives from  NASA said,  'We can  never have a colony on
     Mars, it's  impossible that there's a colony on Mars because Mars
     is a  dead planet.'   And it's not a dead planet, they've lied to
     you about Mars."
          "My name  is Dave  [unintelligible], I'm a representative of
     the Crystic  Institute, and I'd like to know why it was that when
     we sent  a representative down to your home, at your request, you
     failed to  produce any documentation to substantiate your allega-
     tions."
          "In the  first place  it was not at my request, I have never
     contacted the  Crystic Institute  in my life.  I was on the Carol
     Hemingway Show,  she contacted  the Crystic  institute, she  told
     Daniel Shehan  [sp] that I had just said something about Bush and
     drugs on her show.  He called me and told me he wanted to send an
     investigator, in  fact he  told me  to even help the investigator
     because he was new at the job, his name was Wayne Nelson, he is a
     very good  gentleman, he  stayed at  my house for two days, slept
     overnight on my couch, I gave him everything I had.  I never told
     Daniel Shehan  that I  had any  documents and  I never told Wayne
     Nelson that  I had any documents.  In fact what I told Wayne Nel-
     son, and  I quote, 'Wayne, if I did have the documents I couldn't
     admit it  and I don't know you from Adam, and I don't know Daniel
     Shehan from  Adam and  what makes  you think I would give them to
     you.'   Who am  I going  to give  them to  and how quick are they
     going to  disappear, that was my thought.  Wayne Nelson also came
     to my  house  with  a  stack  of  documents  this  thick  already
     substantiating the  presence of aliens and extraterrestrial craft
     on this planet, and they are keeping it a secret, because they're
     afraid  somebody'll   laugh  at  them  and  they'll  loose  their
     credibility.
          "We need some patriots in this country, not people trying to
     make a  name for  themselves, trying to expose some drug runners,
 
                                    Page 11
 
 
 
 
     because those  are just  the bag-men.   The  real crook is in the
     White House! And you can tell that to Daniel Shehan!"
          "Why didn't  Jackie Kennedy report [the source of the lethal
     shot]?" asked another audience member.
          "Who's she going to tell? The Secret Service just killed her
     husband, and  they're assigned  to protect  the president.  Also,
     who had her children? The same Secret Service had her children at
     the time."
          "Wasn't the  craft at Roswell, New Mexico, destroyed and all
     the aliens killed?" another young man asked.
          "All the  aliens were  dead but the craft was not completely
     destroyed, it was severely damaged yes."
          On an  unrelated note  an older  gentleman asked, "Does that
     mean that Alternative-3 is true?"
          "Alternative-3 is absolutely true and so is Alternative-2."
          Then a  man in  his late  20s or  early 30s raised his hand,
     said something  unintelligible, and  was apparently recognized by
     Mr. Cooper,  who asked him to take the podium and address the au-
     dience.
          "What I  said was  that I thanked him [Cooper] very much for
     coming forward  and saying  something.   A lot  of my friends out
     here know  that I  was involved  in  the  United  States  Special
     Forces, UFO  Tracking and  Research from  the years 1971 to 1975.
     My name  is Richard  Murray, I was based out of the 71st Tac Con-
     trol Flight,  McDill Air  Force Base,  Tampa, Florida.   We  were
     'Mobile Radar  Command,' that was combat and war ready.  We could
     be loaded  on aircraft  within an  hour and many times were taken
     into areas  [to] set  up radar.   A  lot of  times we were set up
     around Egland  [sp] Air Force Base because that's where they have
     the 'Altered  Temperature Weather  Control,' where  they can test
     various aircraft  for their  shrinkage and their dimension change
     during altered  temperature.  So, you know, I was told to shut up
     twice in  1982 and  they finally  threatened my parents life so I
     stayed quiet,  and, that's  when Wendel Stevens was taken off the
     streets ...  Just like that!  And I hid for quite awhile, and de-
     cided to  come back out when I heard that you're [Cooper] of such
     high rank  as you  were, and I felt just in saying that your cre-
     dentials are  true, and  that what  you have  to say,  everything
     you've said  here today,  I've heard  before behind closed doors.
     And you've  really tied  the link  for me to the Kennedy killing.
     And there's a few more links that have to go on with the Columbia
     Cartel and  the money  laundering.  I think there's more than one
     cartel involved, and they're shutting one of them down so one can
     maintain a power, it just seems to be the way it works."
          A muffled  question then  came from  someone in the audience
     regarding the person referred to as "Colonel Stevens."
          "Uh, Colonel Stevens is out of jail now," replied Murray who
     was quickly  asked another  question I  couldn't hear to which he
     answered, "I  sure hope  to hell so, he is a wonderful man, and I
     give him my utmost respect, and it was one of the saddest days in
     my life  to see  what happened to him happen to him.  But I don't
     care what  they say  about Wendel  Stevens, in my heart you can't
     discredit that  man to me.  I don't care who the hell you are.  I
     won't listen  to it,  I don't  give a shit if he was screwing ba-
     bies.  You know ... that doesn't ... he's not that kind of a man,
     I don't care what you say, I know him personally."
          The lecture  was then  essentially over.  The "Alternative-2
     and Alternative-3"  that  were  referred  to  briefly  are  (just
     guessing now)  two government  contingency plans  to  1.  Declare
     Martial Law and invalidate the Constitution on the premise that a

     terrorist group  had entered  the country  with a  Nuclear weapon
     with plans  to detonate it in a major city.  All dissidents would
     be rounded up and placed in concentration camps and the press and
     media would be nationalized.  All this if the information becomes
     public before  they want  it  to  or  if  the  aliens  attempt  a
     takeover, and 2. Another contingency plan to contain or delay the
     release of  this information,  the details of which I am probably
     wrong about anyway.
          Mr. Cooper  is a  man who  appears to be in his late 40s, of
     medium height  and weight,  and was  dressed casually  during the
     lecture.  His hairline was receding slightly, and he carried him-
     self with  confidence and purpose.  Bill Cooper, as he was called
     by several  in attendance,  is not  a professional  speaker.  His
     presentation lacked  the polish  of repeated deliveries which all
     the other  lectures had  during the  Expo, but  what it lacked in
     fine tuning was easily made up for in its content.
