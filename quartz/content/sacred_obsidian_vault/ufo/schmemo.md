Fascinating!  It's amazing how totally insane, deluded, and downright
stark-raving *MAD* our intelligence community was in 1947.  Look at all
the crackpots writing about such intricate details of flying saucer
construction!
_________________________________________________________________________

rudiak@garnet.berkeley.edu wrote:

Bill Peterson recently reprinted the remarkable Gen. Nathan Twining
memo of Sept. 23, 1947, which, in regard to all the flying saucer
reports of May-July 1947, stated that "The phenomenon is something
real and not visionary or fictitious."  He then went on to describe
how the saucers were large, metallic, highly maneuverable, evasive,
flew in formation, and exhibited extreme rates of climb.

Twining's memo had been prompted by Gen. George Schulgen, asst. Chief
of Staff for Air Intelligence, who asked him for further information
on July 30, 1947.  Schulgen and his staff, concerned about the massive
sightings and their implications for national security, had already
conducted their own preliminary investigation of the saucer reports
during July.  The existence of this study was denied by Air Force
spokesmen for the next 30 years until forced into the open by the
Freedom of Information Act in 1976.

The study was made up of 16 of what they considered to be the best
sightings (including Kenneth Arnold's famous June 24 case).  Like the
Twining letter, the July 30 study concluded that "From detailed study
of reports selected for their impression of veracity and reliability,
several conclusions have been formed:  This 'flying saucer' situation
is not at all imaginary or seeing too much in some natural phenomena.

Something is really flying around."

What then followed Twining's Sept. 23 letter was even more remarkable.

Schulgen apparently asked for additional information from Twining, and
then on Oct. 28, 1947 issued a draft order (portions reprinted below)
for American intelligence operatives throughout the world directing
them to gather all potentially relevent information about flying
saucers.  (This document was declassified and released under FOIA in
1985.)

What's remarkable about this order is that it goes into very specific
details about saucer contruction.  Unusual construction materials are
described including "metallic foils," and "balsa wood or similar
material" and "fabrication methods to achieve extreme light weight and
structural stability," which also included composite or sandwich
construction.

Those who have read the descriptions of crash debris by Roswell
eyewitnesses know that they also described extremely tough and
lightweight metallic foils and balsa-wood like beams, possibly
laminated, with plastic-like properties.

To my mind, this can't be mere coincidence.  The Air Force already had
in its possession crash material of this description, despite
Twining's denial in his Sept. 23 letter.

Schulgen's memo further describes such saucer oddities as retractable
domes, unusual hatchways, tripod landing gears, lack of fuel storage,
and a powerplant that wasn't separate from but an integral part of the
aircraft.  These are truly remarkable details to comment on if all the
Air Force had to go on were reports of distant lights in the sky told
to them by civilian crazies.

Skeptics ask for documentary proof of a Roswell saucer crash.  The
Schulgen memo is a virtual smoking gun that a crash occurred, and that
Twining and the Air Force had examined a craft, or pieces of one, up
close and personal.

Portions of Schulgen's directive follow:

"This strange object, or phenomenon, may be considered, in view of
certain observations, as long-range aircraft capable of a high rate of
climb, high cruising speed and highly maneuverable and capable of
being flown in very tight formations.  For the purpose of analysis and
evaluation of these so-called "flying saucers," the object sighted is
being assumed to be a manned craft of unknown origin.  While there
remains he possibility of Russian manufacture, based on perspective
thinking and actual accomplishments of the Germans, it is the
considered opinion of some elements that the object may in fact
represent interplanetary craft of some kind."

"Construction.
a.  Type of material, whether metal, ferrous, non-ferrous or
    nonmetallic.
b.  Composite or sandwich construction utilizing various
    combinations of metals, metallic foils, plastics, and perhaps
    balsa wood or similar material.
c.  Unusual fabrication methods to achieve extreme light weight and
    structural stability."

"Arrangement.
a.  Special provisions such as retractable domes to provide unusual
    observation for the pilot and crew members.
b.  Unusual feaures or provisions regarding the opening and closing
    of doors."

"Landing Gear.
a.  Indicate type of landing gear--whether conventional, tricycle,
    multiple wheel, etc. or of an unconventional type such as tripod
    or skid."

"Powerplant.
a.  3.  Nuclear propulsion (atomic energy).  Atomic energy engines
    would probably be unlike any family type of engine, although
    atomic energy might be employed in combination with any of the
    above types (piston, jet).  Aircraft would be characterized by
    lack of fuel systems and fuel storage space.
b.  The powerplant would likely be an integral part of the aircraft
    and possibly not distinguishable as an item separate from the
    aircraft."
