                             UFO's and the Occult Reich

        Many civilizations with  "flying  saucers"  exist,  and  are  hidden
        inside this planet. Beings which generate  out of their own thought,
        various craft which are among us.  There are also the UFO craft that
        are built by surface cultures.
 
        All these are linked together in various ways.  Most  all  of  these
        are OCCULT (hidden)...and most are "messengers of deception".
 
        In 1867, Wentworth  Little  founded the English Rosicrucian Society.
        He was in contact with the German Rosicrucians. Little recruited his
        followers, up to 144 people, from  the  ranks  of the higher-ranking
        "Freemasons".
 
        One of his  disciples  was  Bulwer  Lytton, who was  a  learned  man
        celebrated throughout the  world  for  his  novel  "The Last Days of
        Pompeii". He also wrote "The Coming  Race" (Zanoni) which featured a
        mystical pre-Nazi group in Germany.
 
        This Berlin group  called  itself  the  "Luminous Lodge",  or  "Vril
        Society" Vril (like the force) has enormous energy potential.
 
        The book describes  a  race  of  men  physically  far  in advance of
        surface humans.  They have acuired  powers  over themselves and over
        all material objects.
 
        They lived in  caves  and  would  emerge to reign over  the  surface
        world. The most  prominent  member  of  the  Vril  Society  was Karl
        Haushofer, a close confidant of Hitler,  Hess and Rosenburg, who all
        belonged to the Thule Society (Thule Gesellschaft)  that was founded
        in Munich in 1918.
 
        Thule was a  neo-Gnostic racist group, which became a rallying front
        for the societal roots of Nazi thought. The chief architect of the

        Thule group was  Baron  Rudolf von Sebottendorff (Rudolf Glauer) who
        had direct contact with the Dervish  Orders  and  knew  a great deal
        about Islamic mysticism, particularly Sufism in all its aspects.  He
        also had contact with Herman Pohl, leader of the German Order
        Walvater of the Holy Grail.
 
        Nazi occultism was  a  mixture  of  influences   and   a   host   of
        interrelated secret societies,  including  the  Bavarian Illuminati,
        the Knights Templar, the Teutonic Knights, the Holy Vehm, the Golden
        Dawn, the Rosy-Cross, the Vril Society,  the  German  Order  and its
        offshoot, the Thule Society.
 
        Thule is known as the capital of Hyperborea, in the polar regions.
        Also known as "Ultima Thule", it was the gateway to other worlds.
 
        It was known to serve as both a place to leave the earth and a place
        on the rim of the opening to the "hollow earth".  It  is interesting
        to note that  the  major powers of the earth have microwave stations
        setup in the area, broadcasting ELF waves on brain-wave freqencies.
 
        Tradition has it that Hyperboreans  were  in  contact  with  various
        "alien cultures". War supposedly broke out between  the Hyperboreans
        and other civilizations (atomic war).
 
        Descendants of the  Thule caste (Celts) emigrated elsewhere to other
        areas of the planet. They colonized  these  areas, driven by "memory
        chromosomes" inherited from their space-travelling ancestors.
 
        These star seed people are mostly of Celtic origin  (Basques, Irish,
        English, Norsemen, Icelanders,  Bretons,  Spaniards  and Portuguese)
        which, strangely enough,  make up  the  largest  percentage  of  RH-
        NEGATIVE blood types.
 
        Current neo-Nazis are allegedly trying to locate and  control  these
        people.  Apparently, most  contactees  have  RH-blood  type. Are UFO
        cultures tracking their own "cross-breeds"?
 
        The Grand Lodge of Vril was seeking to re-unite the ancient Aryan
        traditions and to  make  contact   with   the  original  super-human
        "luminous race" and to make an alliance with beings  who have secret
        sanctuaries hidden inside the planet.
 
        The book "UFOs  -  NAZI  SECRET WEAPON?" by Mattern-Friedrich brings
        out some interesting information,  It  seems that Victor Schauberger
        (1885-1958) invented a  number  of  "flying  disks"  for  the  Nazis
        between 1938 and 1945.

        Vangard Notes...
 
           We have  seen  a  copy  of  a letter from Schauberger to a friend
           which states  that  he worked at  Matthausen  concentration  camp
           directing technically   oriented  prisoners  and   other   German
           scientists in the successful construction of a saucer.
 
           In this   letter   written   by  Schauberger,  he  gives  further
           information from his direct experience with the German military :
 
 
                                       Page 2
 
 
 
 
 
                "The "flying   saucer"  which  was flight-tested on the 19th
                 February 1945 near Prague  and  which  attained a height of
                 15,000 metres in 3 minutes and a horizontal speed of 2,200
                 km/hours, was constructed according to a Mod l 1 built at
                 Mauthausen concentration camp in collaboration with the
                 first-class engineers and stress-analysts  ASSIGNED  TO  ME
                 from the prisoners there.
 
                 It was only after the end of the war that I came to hear,
                 through one  of  the  workers  UNDER MY DIRECTION, a Czech,
                 THAT FURTHER  INTENSIVE   DEVELOPMENT   WAS   IN  PROGRESS:
                 however, there was no answer to my enquiry.
 
                 From what I understand, just before the end of the war, the
                 machine is  SUPPOSED  TO  HAVE BEEN DESTROYED  on  Keitel's
                 orders.  That's the last I heard of it.
 
                 In this affair, several armament specialists were also
                 involved who  appeared  at  the  works  in  Prague, shortly
                 before my return to Vienna,  and  asked  that I DEMONSTRATE
                 the fundamental basis  of it:
 
                 The  CREATION   OF   AN   ATOMIC LOW-PRESSURE  ZONE,  which
                 DEVELOPS IN  SECONDS when  either AIR or WATER IS CAUSED TO
                 MOVE RADIALLY AND AXIALLY  under  conditions  of  a FALLING
                 TEMPERATURE GRADIENT."
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
        Schauberger and his son lived in the United States  for a short time
        after the war,  where  he was reported to be working on a top secret
        UFO project in Texas for the US Government.
 
        Reports of Aryan looking saucer pilots  are  many. Long haired blond
        folks that speak  German.  It is interesting to note  that  the  so-
        called "venusian" saucer  design  of contactees all look like German
        saucer designs.
 
        The Thule Society is still alive in the minds of neo-Nazi (Fourth
        Reich) occulists.
 
        There is a booklet going around that reports to be the secret log of
        Admiral Richard Byrd. In 1978, copies  were  sent  out by the Hollow
        Earth Research Society in Ontario, Canada.
 
        Ivan Boyes, its  director, claims that "after the  war,  the  allies
        discovered that over  2,000  scientists  from  Germany and Italy had
        vanished along with almost a million  people  to the Land beyond the
        pole.
 
        This is apparently what Admiral Byrd's expedition was  all about. To
        hunt them down. The domain of the Arianni.
 
        The "Flugelrads" (wingwheels)  were noted in the secret log as being
        sent to the  surface  world  to  investigate   the   first   nuclear
        explosions.
 
        These were the model T's of the German saucer design.  Do  we have a
        myth in the making? So ...  Admiral Byrd goes back and tells the
 
                                       Page 3
 
 
 
 
 
        Pentagon and the  President  what  he has seen. They order him to be
        silent.
 
        It seems that the inner earth cavern  civilizations  and  the  lands
        inside the earth have been a part of the occult/military  secret for
        a long time.
