 UFO Books -- The Serious Literature
 
    Compiled by Keith Rowell
 
    Please pass this list along intact to anyone who wants a copy.
 
 
      _________________________________________________________________
 
    This list is a quick guide to the best of the wide range of UFO books.
    The literature varies from naive believers to fanatic debunkers. This
    list, however, features the people in the middle: the UFO researchers.
    They believe genuine UFOs are a mystery needing a solution. Unlike UFO
    researchers, the naive believers and debunkers think alike since they
    both believe the mystery is solved. Naive believers "know" genuine
    UFOs are flying saucers piloted by space beings. Debunkers "know" it
    is all just psychology or perhaps some as yet undiscovered physical
    phenomenon. However, when mainstream scholars and scientists finally
    accept the challenge of the UFO mystery (which they haven't for 40
    years now), the naive believers will probably be closer to the truth
    than the debunkers.
 
    In order to join the debate about the reality of the saucers, you need
    to read at least half of these books. If you haven't, you haven't done
    the first thing that any scholar or scientist does -- a literature
    search and perusal (peruse means to read carefully, don't forget!).
    Remember, your opinion is worth no more than the depth of your
    understanding of a topic. The UFO, strange as it may seem to some of
    you, has a serious literature devoted it. Yes, it's true, this
    literature is definitely not scientific or scholarly in the strict
    sense of the word, but that is simply because enough scientists and
    scholars are not aware of the problem of the UFO yet. Every year,
    especially in the eighties and nineties, more and more scientists and
    scholars are turning a serious eye to the problem. This is happening
    despite the orchestration of negative opinion promoted over the years
    by the intelligence establishment of the US. Sad to say, US
    intelligence is part and parcel of the UFO problem. Anyone who ignores
    this is just plain naive.
 
   The list...
 Berlitz, Charles and William L. Moore. The Roswell Incident. New
 York: Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 1980. 168pp. ISBN 0-448-21199-8.  The
 facts about the crash of a saucer in the summer of 1947 in New
 Mexico and how the US government covered it up.
 
 Bowen, Charles, ed.  The Humanoids. Chicago: Henry Regnery, 1969.
 256pp.  LC 77-126142. Good summary of the evidence compiled from
 material published in the British Flying Saucer Review magazine.
 
 Blum, Howard.  Out There: The Government's Secret Quest for
 Extraterrestrials. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1990. 300pp.  ISBN
 0-671-66260-0.  An important book since it is written by a former
 NY Times reporter who has written two other influential books --
 one about Nazi intelligence officers brought to America illegally
 after WWII and the other about the Walker spy case.  However,
 Blum's UFO book was apparently hastily done and, thus, somewhat of
 a disappointment in the UFO research community.
 
 Bullard, Thomas Edward.  UFO Abductions: The Measure of a Mystery.
 Vol. 1: Comparative Study of Abduction Reports.  (Bloomington, IND):
 Fund for UFO Research, 1987. 402pp.  This study by a PhD folklorist
 is must reading for anyone wanting to understand the depth and
 breadth of the abduction enigma. Bullard concludes UFO abduction
 stories are much too internally consistent down to small details to
 be classed as traditional folklore or typical dream material.
 
 Butler, Brenda, Dot Street, and Jenny Randles.  Sky Crash: A Cosmic
 Conspiracy. Sudbury, Great Britain: Neville Spearman, 1984. 283pp.
 ISBN 85435-155-8. Review and analysis of the facts in the British
 Bentwaters-Rendlesham RAFB case.
 
 Clark, Jerome. The UFO Encyclopedia, Volume 1: UFOs in the 1980s.
 Detroit, MI: Apogee Books, 1990. 234pp.  ISBN 1-55888-301-0. This
 encyclopedia is mostly the author's tour de force, but still delivers
 valuable information not easily available elsewhere.  Libraries
 should have this.
 
 Clark, Jerome.  The UFO Encyclopedia, Volume 2: The Emergence of a
 Phenomenon: UFOs from the Beginning through 1959. Detroit, MI:
 Omnigraphics, 1992. 433pp.  ISBN 1-55888-301-0.  The second
 volume of this fine work is must reading for those desiring real
 understanding of UFOs.
 
 Colombo, John Robert.  UFOs Over Canada: Personal Accounts of
 Sightings and Close Encounters. Willowdale, Ontario, Canada:
 Hounslow Press, 1991. 221pp.  ISBN 0-88882-138-7.  A nice book by a
 famous Canadian compiler of Canadiana of short UFO accounts mostly
 in the words of the witnesses themselves.
 
 Condon, Edward U. and Daniel S. Gillmor (ed.).  Final Report of the
 Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects (Conducted by the
 University of Colorado Under Contract to the United States Air
 Force). New York: Bantam Books, 1968. 965pp.  After close,
 competent study of over 100 UFO sighting reports, 30% couldn't be
 identified!  Read Condon's prejudiced introduction only after you
 have looked through the rest of the study.  The National Academy of
 Sciences rubber-stamped Condon's recommendations that no public
 funds be devoted to the study of UFOs.
 
 Conroy, Ed.  Report on Communion: An Independent Investigation of
 and Commentary on Whitley Strieber's Communion. New York:
 Morrow, 1989. 427pp.  ISBN 0-688-08864-3.  This journalist was a
 boyhood acquaintance of Strieber. When Strieber published
 Communion, Conroy decided to see if his story would hold up under
 an investigative journalist's scrutiny. Conroy says yes.
 
 Crystall, Ellen.  Silent Invasion: The Shocking Discoveries of a UFO
 Researcher. New York: Paragon House, 1991. 190pp.  ISBN 1-55778-
 493-0.  A UFO researcher uses her psychic abilities to locate UFOs in
 the field. Interesting for showing how a scientifically naive person
 still understands that scientific and scholarly proof is what is
 needed in the end. Many hard to interpret photos accompany the text.
 
 Curran, Douglas.  In Advance of the Landing: Folk Concepts of Outer
 Space. New York: Abbeville Press, 1985. 132pp.  ISBN 0-89659-523-
 4.  Valuable photographic presentation of UFO folklore.
 
 Deardorff, James W. Celestial Teachings: The Emergence of the True
 Testament of Jmmanuel (Jesus). Tigard, OR: Wild Flower Press,
 1990. 323pp.  ISBN 0-926524-11-9. An analysis of some of the
 collateral material from the extensive Billy Meier contact case.
 
 Delgado, Pat and Colin Andrews.  Circular Evidence: A Detailed
 Investigation of the Flattened Swirled Crops Phenomenon. London:
 Bloomsbury, 1989. 190pp.  ISBN 0-7475-0357-5.  The first of the
 picture books about crop "circles".  It's a very good presentation of
 the facts and their investigative methods. Some investigators
 believe UFOs may produce the "circles".
 
 Druffel, Ann and D. Scott Rogo.  The Tujunga Canyon Contacts.
 Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1980. 264pp.  ISBN 0-13-
 932541-7.  Good book about abduction/contact experiences.
 
 Eberhart, George M.  UFOs and the Extraterrestrial Contact Movement:
 a bibliography. Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press, 1986. 1298pp.  ISBN
 0-8108-1919-8.  An outstanding listing of books, articles, movies,
 TV appearances, dissertations, conferences, etc., about UFOs and
 related phenomena.  No library in America should be without it.  Ask
 your public library to get a copy today!!
 
 Emenegger, Robert.  UFO's: Past, Present and Future. New York:
 Ballantine Books, 1974. 180pp.  ISBN 345-24189-4-150.  Good
 general book.  Emenegger produced a film documentary of the same
 name.  The US government hinted that it would give him some "real"
 flying saucer footage for inclusion in his film.  This didn't happen.
 
 Evans, Hilary and John Spencer (eds.).  UFOs: 1947-1987 -- The 40-
 Year Search for an Explanation. London: Fortean Tomes, 1987. 384pp.
 ISBN 1-870021-02-9.  Similar to the other book by Spencer and
 Evans, but more extensive. A must read for dedicated ufologists.
 
 Fawcett, Lawrence and Barry J. Greenwood.  Clear Intent: The
 Government Coverup of the UFO Experience. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.:
 Prentice-Hall, 1984. 259pp.  ISBN 0-13-136656-4.  Very important
 book summarizing what ufologists know from studying the thousands
 of FOIA-released government UFO documents.  Everything but proof
 of crashed flying saucers is here, and it's all from FOIA-released
 documents!
 
 Flammonde, Paris.  UFO Exist! New York: Putnam, 1976. 406pp.  ISBN
 399-11538-2.  Fine history of the subject from a radio
 producer/journalist. The book details the US government's
 involvement.

 Good, Timothy.  Above Top Secret: The Worldwide UFO Cover-Up. New
 York: William Morrow, 1988. 592pp.  ISBN 0-688-07860-5.  The most
 important book about the on-going government cover-up.
 
 Good, Timothy.  Alien Liaison: The Ultimate Secret. London: Century,
 1991. 242pp.  ISBN 0-7126-2194-6.  A reliable introduction to the
 wilder tales circulating in the UFO subculture in the 70s, 80s, and
 90s. The bizarre nature of what is known makes a prudent
 investigator reluctant to throw out any information. Some of this
 will turn out to be true after it is put through the academic mill in
 the 1990s and beyond. Not for the timid or intellectually rigid.
 
 Haines, Richard F., ed.  UFO Phenomena and the Behavioral Scientist.
 Metuchen, N.J.: The Scarecrow Press, 1979. 450pp.  ISBN 0-8108-
 1228-2.  Scholarly book of papers on how eyewitnesses report UFOs

 daylight discs categories of UFOs.
 
 Hall, Richard.  Uninvited Guests: A Documented History of UFO
 Sightings, Alien Encounters &amp; Coverups. Santa Fe, NM: Aurora Press,
 1988. 381pp.  ISBN 0-943358-32-9.  A very good summary of the
 whole field of ufology. Highly recommended as a place to start.
 
 Hendry, Allan. The UFO Handbook: A Guide to Investigating,
 Evaluating, and Reporting UFO Sightings. Garden City, NY: Doubleday
 (Dolphin), 1979. 297pp. ISBN 0-385-14348-6.  The best study of the
 subject.  About 1300 UFO reports, all happening within the year and a half of
 the study's duration, are dissected.  8.6% fall into the genuine UFOs
 category, that is, essentially flying saucers, whatever they are!
 
 Hopkins, Budd.  Intruders: The Incredible Visitations at Copley
 Woods. New York: Random House, 1987. 223pp.  ISBN 0-394-56076-0.
 HopkinsU second book.  He says it is likely that aliens are mixing our
 genes with theirs, and this is a major purpose of the abductions.

 year history of animal mutilations.
 
 Holroyd, Stuart.  Alien Intelligence.  New York: Everest House, 1979.
 231pp.  ISBN 0-89696-040-4.  An excellent book by a student of the
 paranormal that compares the different kinds of intelligence,
 including ET intelligence and "disembodied" intelligence.
 
 Hynek, J. Allen, Philip J. Imbrogno, and Bob Pratt.  Night Siege: The
 Hudson Valley UFO Sightings. New York: Ballantine Books, 1987.

 Hynek, J. Allen.  The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry. New York:
 Ballantine Books, 1972. 309pp.  ISBN 345-23953-9-150.  The father
 of modern ufology writes a solid book about the subject.
 
 Jacobs, David Michael.  Secret Life: Firsthand Accounts of UFO
 Abductions. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992. 336pp.  ISBN 0-671-
 74857-2.  The most important book on UFO abductions so far. Start
 here because the presentation is a just the facts, ma'am, blow by
 blow account of what Jacobs believes is happening. He says
 essential aspects of all abductions are absolutely real in ordinary
 perceptual and space-time reality. However, there are definite
 perceptual and space-time anomalies too. When people report that
 they had a missing time experience of two hours, Jacobs says they
 are actually bodily missing from planet Earth, or at least human
 beings cannot find them on Earth! A warning to  extreme skeptics and
 debunkers: this book may be hazardous to your mental health!

 Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1975. 362pp.  ISBN 0-

 publication.
 
 Keyhoe, Donald E.  Aliens from Space: The Real Story of Unidentified
 Flying Objects. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1973. 322pp.  Keyhoe says

 probably right. The last of Keyhoe's five books about UFOs.

 Experiences of Eduard Meier. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 1987.
 265pp.  ISBN 0-87113-139-0.  Easy introduction to the complex

 Randle, Kevin D. and Donald R. Schmitt.  UFO Crash at Roswell. New
 York: Avon, 1991. 327pp.  ISBN 0-380-76196-3. The authors don't
 back down. They say they have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that
 a flying saucer -- not a UFO -- crashed in NM in the summer of 1947.
 Get off your duff.  Prove them wrong!

 Investigated. London: Robert Hale, 1988. 240pp.  ISBN 0-7090-3276-

 South) American  phenomenon.

 City, NY: Doubleday, 1956. 277pp. Written by a former head of the
 AF's Project Blue Book public relations UFO effort. "Brand New
 Enlarged Edition Latest, Up-to-the-minute Facts on UFO!" on dust
 jacket.  No indication whatsoever inside the new edition that it
 differs from the earlier edition by the addition of three extra
 (debunking) chapters.  Without the dust jacket you would never know
 there are two distinct editions of this classic UFO book.  Some UFO
 researchers speculate that the Air Force/CIA was displeased enough
 with Ruppelt's pro-UFO first edition that they made him include the
 last three chapters in the "new edition"!
 
 Sagan, Carl and Thorton Page, eds.  UFO's -- A Scientific Debate. New
 York: Norton, 1972. 310pp.  ISBN 0-393-00739-1.  Appeared shortly
 after the Condon Committee Report said once again that saucers
 don't exist so they won't be studied by science.  UFO proponents,
 debunkers, and honest skeptics have their say here.

 Greenwich, CN: Devin-Adair, 1974. 286pp.  ISBN 0-8159-7000-5.

 memo that made it clear that the Condon UFO Study was a sham.

 components of the UFO phenomena.
 
 Scully, Frank.  Behind the Flying Saucers. New York: Henry Holt, 1950.

 Thompson, Keith.  Angels and Aliens: UFOs and the Mythic
 Imagination. New York: Addison-Wesley, 1991. 283pp.  ISBN 0-201-
 55084-9.  A minor lay scholar of the Jungian school takes on the
 UFO. His history of the field should be read by all UFO investigators.
 He suspects there might be a "real" component to UFOs, but his
 emphasis is on the mythic aspects, which may be more important in
 the final analysis anyway.
 
 Vallee, Jacques.  Confrontations: A Scientist's Search for Alien
 Contact. New York: Ballantine Books, 1990. 263pp.  ISBN 0-345-
 36453-8. Vallee is back to presenting "hard evidence" again instead
 of speculation. Some Brazilian peasants were killed in apparent
 encounters with UFOs.
 
 Vallee, Jacques.  Dimensions: A Casebook of Alien Contact. New York:

 37396-0.  Vallee turns away from excessive American ufologist bashing to
 give us a reasonable rundown on the latest in Russian UFOs and
 ufology. It's been as bad over there as it has been elsewhere. The
 aliens seem to be equal opportunity abusers the world over.
