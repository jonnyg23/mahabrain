 <p align="center"><i>AN EASTER MESSAGE<br> FROM OUR MASTER</i></p>  
 <p>Unto each of thee I address these words of earthly usage, that they may be read and understood by thy conscious thinking processes, limited by previous thought patterns strongly etched on thy brain, which be the physical instrument wherewith thou dost interpret My thoughts in conformity with thy willingness to accept Divine Truth in its purity of concept.</p>  
 <p>At this culminating period of intense effort on the part of <i>all</i> Light Forces to enter every smallest opening in mortal minds and hearts with the illuminating power of Christ-Love, it be given Me, the Christ-of-God once manifesting in mortal form, to give every human being <i>some glimpse</i> of My glorified Being! Until the mass of mankind be brought to a point where they yearn exceedingly to <i>know Me</i> (or the spirit of Truth which motivates My every word and act) of what avail would be My manifestation in garb of flesh? Would it not be accredited by the majority of mankind to some absurd, theoretical</p>  
 <p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74</font></a></p>  
 <p>fantasies invented by minds closed to inspired revelation of Truth?</p>  
 <p>Lo, ye do contradict thine own selves! One moment you pray for a visible demonstration of the reality of One sent into flesh nigh two thousand years agone, that thus thy faith may be justified. The next moment ye deride and scoff at anyone who tells thee of beings (<i>not</i> from highest heaven but from advanced planets more easily comprehensible to untutored, immature minds) sent of the Father to lead mankind to a partial understanding of the spiritual laws by which man may progress.</p>  
 <p>My words of Truth and Life have been discarded by the multitudes as "impractical," have been distorted, have been mouthed in "vain repetitions" until they have well-nigh lost their power to reach men's souls, have been relegated to the realm of childish fondness for pleasing tales, oft cast aside as they grow to maturity. Think these be fitting preparations for My manifestation in mortal guise?</p>  
 <p>Oh, my little children of earth, list not to those who prate of vast stores of knowledge to be acquired through years of arduous study of ponderous tomes designed to confuse thy minds and divert thee from the simple, direct pathway leading to true companionship with thy Master in thy daily thinking and living! <i>One Truth</i> lived each hour of every day in</p>  
 <p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a></p>  
 <p>conscious attunement with thy Master and thy Heavenly Father doth bring Me closer to thee than endless hours of reasoning about this or that theory concerning Life and its purpose.</p>  
 <p>To see Me with thy physical eyes would be to thee a boon beyond price, and this shall not be denied thee . . . yet will ye hasten the time of its occurring if ye will but behold Me in My spirit manifestation walking by thy side wherever duty calleth thee, revealing unto thee through our close understanding in what wise ye may best fulfill the tasks allotted to thee ere ye embarked upon thy present earth span.</p>  
 <p>Many now reading My written words be here as "ambassadors" from far flung vistas of "outer space," having volunteered to endure the irritations of fleshly existence that they might in some wise aid in turning men's minds toward a Christly mode of living. Unto these consecrated ones I say, "Lo, I shall give unto thee, mayhap in a way ye be not expecting, a true vision of thy Master and His boundless love for thee!"</p>  
 <p>Wouldst thou choose to see Me clothed in radiance of glory so dazzling you could not approach Me in thine earthly habiliments? Or may I come unto thee in seamless robe of perfect understanding of thine own earthly circumstances and problems?</p>  
 <p>Choose thee the latter, I pray thee, and in due season thy faithful service, performed in My Name</p>  
 <p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 76</font></a></p>  
 <p>and by My Power, shall lead thee to the hour appointed by our Heavenly Father when thou shalt see thy Master face-to-face!</p>  
 <p>Lo, this shall be thine own "Easter Morning" of never-ending, joyous recognition of thine ever present Friend and Counselor,</p>  
 <p align="right"><i>THY PRINCE OF PEACE</i></p>

 <p>What could a mere "Space Man" add to our Master's Easter Message which would not detract from the beautiful simplicity of His words? We, who come as Messengers and Deliverers from the "powers of Darkness" now encompassing your planet, beseech you to heed the note of warning concealed in this Easter Message and "step up" all your own vibrations to a level where you can bear the radiance streaming from the <i>glorified</i> Cross, which is the symbol of our Risen Lord, forever freed from the <i>limitations</i> of earth life.</p>  
 <p>It was said of old, "When He shall appear, we shall be like Him for we shall see Him as He is!" I wish to assure you, this is literally true as we have proven, for as we visualized the Divine purity of His Life and Teachings, as we made our lives conform with that inspired vision, we reached a point in our understanding where we were able to "see Him," not only with our spiritual eyes but with the sensitized lenses of our physical eyes until now, I can tell you in all truthfulness, we enjoy the almost inconceivable privilege of entertaining Him on many occasions when He visits Venus!</p>

 <p>Some of you may question this saying, "The Christ Spirit is indwelling in each of us!" This we gladly concede is true! And this Christ Spirit manifests in many guises on all planes and planets. The Spirit of Kindness, of Compassion, of Mercy, of Joy, of Beauty, of Love in all its multitudinous forms . . . all of these are reflections of the Christ Spirit which our Master so magnificently presented for our emulation during His sojourn on Shan (the earth).</p>  
 <p>Each mortal seeking to follow in His footsteps acts as a magnet to draw to earth those qualified to assist in restoring that perfection of both material and spiritual beauty it originally possessed in the Mind of the Creator! It is our great privilege to aid in this restoration under the direction of our Master and yours, Jesus the Christ!</p>  
 <p>A glorious Easter to you in which we shall share, with all the hosts of heaven rejoicing at your response to the Call . . . "Come up higher!"</p>
