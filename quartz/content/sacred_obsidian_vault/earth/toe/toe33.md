 <p align="center"><i>The Theory Illustrated, with a View of the<br> Summits of the Alps.</i></p>  
 <p>There are two different directions in which we may observe the destruction of our land to proceed; in the one of these, the basis of our continent is diminished by the incroachment of the sea; in the other, again, it is the height of the land above the level of the sea that is lowered. We have been considering the incroachment of the sea upon the continent; let us now examine how far there may also appear sufficient documents, by which we may be led to conclude a long progress in time past, for the destruction of the solid mass of earth above the sea, without diminishing its basis.</p>  
 <p>If we shall suppose this earth composed of horizontal strata, and of one level surface, without the least protuberance remaining by which we might be informed of what had been removed by time in the operation of second causes, we should be ignorant of every thing of cosmogeny but this, That the strata of the globe had been originally formed (by the sea) in the same shape as we had found them on the surface of the land. But this is not the shape of the surface of our continent: We have every where abundance of eminences, sufficient to give us great information with regard to what had passed in former periods of time, if the strata of the globe were in that regular shape which they had originally assumed in being deposited at the bottom the sea.</p>  
 <p>The strata, however, are not in that regular shape and position from whence we might learn, by examining the remaining portions, what had been carried away from the surface in general; they are found variously inclined to the horizon; and this we find both occasioned from the fracture and flexure of those bodies, thus changed from their natural horizontal state. Thus, though there are in many places immense masses of strata cut off abruptly, and exposed to view, without the remainder appearing, we cannot from hence form any estimate of the general quantity of destruction; at the same time, it must be evident, from a general inspection, that there has been an immense quantity removed; and that an immense time had been required in bringing about those revolutions of things, which are not done by violent changes, but by slow degrees.</p>  
 <p>Besides that general conclusion with regard to the destruction of the strata, there is also in many places a demonstration of that fact, from a measured minimum of the quantity which had been removed. It is to the mining business chiefly that we are indebted for that demonstration of which we now shall give an example.</p>  
 <p>The coal strata, about Newcastle upon Tyne, dip to the south-east at the rate of one in twelve, or thereabouts. This is but little removed from the horizontal position; at the same time, the strata come all up to the soil or surface in a country which is level, or with little risings. But in those strata there is a slip, or hitch, which runs from north-east to south-west, for 17 or 18 miles in a straight line; the surface on each side of this line is perfectly equal, and nothing distinguishable in the soil above; but, in sinking mines, the same strata are found at the distance of 70 fathoms from each other. Here therefore is a demonstration, that there had been worn away, and removed into the sea, 70 fathoms more from the country on the one side of this line, than from that on the other. It is far from having given us all the height of country which has been washed away, but it gives us a minimum of that quantity.</p>  
 <p>The examination of what is commonly called a secondary country is not sufficient to give us an idea of the immense operation of time in wearing the surface of this earth. It is not that those countries of inferior hardness and elevation have been spared in the course of time, but because we have not, in those levelled countries, such great remainders, by which we are to judge the quantity of what is lost. In the alpine country, again, though it be the same system of things with that which takes place in the lower country, the revolution of things is more marked for our view; and the ravages of time, in destroying the solid parts of the globe, in order to make soil of that which is removed, may be seen in all the steps of that important operation; whereas, in the more level countries, the scale of elevation is imperceptible, and that of time is so slow as renders our examination fruitless. It is the Alps, therefore, chiefly that we are to take for an example, in tracing this operation of nature upon the surface of this earth, and forming some idea of the course of time that must have flowed during that operation in which the height of our land had been diminished.</p>  
 <p>On whatever side we approach the Alps, we find some great river discharging the waters which had been gathered above, and with that water all the waste of earth and stone which had been made among those lofty masses of decaying rock. Now, we find this river running in a valley proportioned, in general, to this vehicle, in which is travelled the wreck of ruinous mountains. Spacious plains attend those mighty streams; and, tho' sometimes we find the greatest rivers much confined between approaching hills of solid rock, the valley opens again, and, on the whole, is always corresponding to the current of water which has successively run in all the quarters of this plain. Here a question occurs; Has this valley been made by the operation of the river itself, or has it been the effect of other causes? Let us now resolve that question.</p>  
 <p>If the valley was made for the river by any other natural cause, either we should tell by what means this work had been performed, or all reasoning upon the subject is at an end, and fancy substituted in its place. If again the river be considered as the means employed by nature in making this valley, then all the solid parts between the bounding mountains must have been removed, and the fertile plains must have been formed by the water depositing those materials which we find in the soil, and which had come originally from the solid mountains. There is no occasion to enter into any argument to prove this fact; nobody that examines the matter will find any reason to doubt; and it would be as unreasonable for those to doubt who have not examined, as for those who find no reasonable subject of doubt to disbelieve.</p>  
 <p>We are now to suppose the great river to have formed the valley and extensive plain in which the water runs,—a valley corresponding to the grandeur of the river by which it has been formed. But, as we ascend this great valley, we find other valleys branching from this main valley; and, in all those subordinate valleys, we find rivers corresponding in like manner with the magnitude of the valley. Here, therefore, is infinitely more than a single river, and a valley corresponding to the river; here is a <i>system</i> of rivers and of valleys, things calculated in perfect wisdom, or properly adapted to each other.</p>  
 <p>Now it is just as easy, by our theory, to explain this system of rivers and valleys, as it is to understand the single appearance of a river and a valley. But it is only in this manner that such a complicated operation, of a series in rivers and their valleys, is to be explained; and we can neither suppose the land to be formed with this intention by a supernatural cause, nor imagine any other natural cause so arranging things, upon the surface of the earth, as to form this perfect system, which holds of nothing but itself; a system in which is manifested wisdom, so far as all the parts are properly adapted to each other, and thus made to answer that intention which is so visible in the economy of this world.</p>  
 <p>The direction of the principal valleys of the Alps, or every mountainous region of the globe, may be considered as proceeding from the centre of that region to the plain country in which each river is to terminate; each secondary river with its valley then branches from the primary as from a stem, consequently runs in a direction perpendicular or inclined to the other. But the secondary rivers also have their branches; and subordinate branches still are branched. In thus tracing rivers and their branchings, we come at last to rivulets that only run in times of rain, and at other times are dry. It is here I would wish to carry my reader, in order to be convinced, with his proper observation, of this great fact,—that the rivers, in general, have hollowed out their valleys.</p>  
 <p>The changes of the valley of the main river are but slow, the plain indeed is wasted in one place, but it is repaired in another, and we do not perceive the place from whence that repairing matter had proceeded. Therefore, that which here appears does not immediately suggest to the spectator what had been the state of things before the valley had been hollowed out, or before that plain, through which the river runs so naturally as being in the lowest place, was made. But it is otherwise in the valley of the rivulet; no person can examine this subject without seeing that the rivulet carries away matter which cannot be repaired except by wearing away some part of the mountain, or the surface of that place upon which the rain, which forms the stream, is gathered. In those rivulets, or their little plains, we see the detached parts remaining in the soil, and also the place from whence those detached parts were taken. Here we need no long chain of reasoning from effect to cause; the whole operation is in a manner before our eyes. In this case, it requires but little study to replace the removed parts; and thus to see the work of nature, resolving the most hard and solid masses by the continued influences of the sun and atmosphere. In this state of things, we are easily made to understand how heavy bodies are travelled along the declivity of the earth, by means of water running from the height.</p>  
 <p>Such is the system of rivers and their valleys; nor is there upon the continent a spot on which some river has not run. But, in the Alps of Switzerland and Savoy, there is another system of valleys, above that of the rivers, and connected with it. These are valleys of moving ice, instead of water. This icy valley is also found branching from a greater to a lesser, until at last it ends upon the summit of a mountain, covered continually with snow. The motion of things in those icy valleys is commonly exceeding slow, the operation however of protruding bodies, as well as that of fracture and attrition, is extremely powerful.</p>  
 <p>To illustrate those operations of excavating the valleys of rivers and of thus undermining mountains which fall by their proper weight, I shall transcribe some descriptions of what is to be found among the Alps. But first I would wish to carry my reader to the summit of that country, to examine the state of that part which nothing can have affected but the immediate influences of the sun and air. After having thus formed some idea of the summit of this wasting country, we shall next examine the valleys through which the materials of the degraded summit must have travelled.</p>  
 <p>In order to give a proper idea of this central part of the Alps, which is so interesting a part in the natural history of the earth, M. de Saussure, in the plates of his <i>Voyages dans les Alpes</i>, tom. 2. has given us two views, the one in profile, the other in face, of the Mont-Blanc. I have caused copy those plates, which are necessary to be consulted in reading the following description of this centre of the Alps.</p>  
 <p>This author has taken much pains to form, to himself a proper idea of the object which we have now in view; and he gives a description of the Mont-Blanc as seen from the top of the Cramont. It is that description which I am now to transcribe <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">17</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>§ 910. «Le premier objet de mon étude fut le Mont Blanc. Il se présente ici de la maniere la plus brillante et la plus commode pour l'observateur. On l'embrasse d'un seul coup-d'oeil, depuis sa base jusqu'à sa cime, et il semble avoir écarté et rejeté sur ses épaules son manteau de neiges et de glaces pour laisser voir à découvert la structure de son corps. Taillé presqu'à pic dans une hauteur perpendiculaire de 1600 toises, les neiges et les glaces ne peuvent s'arrêter que dans un petit nombre d'échancrures, et il montre partout à nud le roc vif dont il est composé.</p>  
 <p>«Sa forme paroît être celle d'une pyramide, qui presente au sud-est du côté du Cramont une de ses faces. L'arrête droite de cette pyramide du côté du sud-ouest, monte au sommet, en faisant avec l'horison un angle de 23 à 24 degrés. L'arrête gauche du coté du nord-est, monte au même sommet sous un angle de 23 à 24 degrés, en sorte que l'angle au sommet est d'environ 130 degrés.</p>  
 <p>«Cette pyramide paroît elle même composée de grands feuillets triangulaires ou pyramidaux. Trois de ces grands feuillets ont leurs bases dans l'Allée-Blanche, et forment ensemble tout l'avant corps de la base de la pyramide. Chacun de ces feuillets, vu de l'Allée-Blanche, paroît une grande montagne, je les ai décrits dans le chapitre précédent sous le noms de Mont-Pétéret, Mont-Rouge, et Mont-Broglia, § 830, 831, 834. Mais du haut du Cramont, on voit plus nettement leur forme, et leur ensemble, on distingue, par exemple, qu'ils sont eux-mêmes composés de grandes feuilles pyramidales; on voit que les injures du temps ont détruit la pointe du Mont-Rouge, tandis que celles des deux autres pyramides sont demeurées entières.</p>  
 <p>«Ces trois feuillets ne s'élèvent pas jusqu'à la moitié de la hauteur du Mont-Blanc; d'autres feuillets plus petits, situés derrière et au-dessus d'eux, et placés sur deux lignes principales qui convergent au sommet, achèvent de couvrir la face de cette grande pyramide. Ces feuillets sont tous de forme pyramidale; les plus petits sont les plus aigus; j'en ai mesuré plusieurs, dont l'angle au sommet n'étoit que de 70 degrés. Tous, absolument tous, ont leurs plans parallèles à l'Allée-Blanche, et par conséquent dirigés du nord-est au sud-ouest.</p>  
 <p>«§ 911. Quant à la matière dont est composée cette grande et haute montagne, toute sa cime et toute sa base, tant au centre que du côté du nord-est, sont indubitablement de granit; mais le côté sud-ouest de la base, ou le Mont-Broglia que nous avons vu de près, § 834, est d'une pierre moins dure, mélangée de schorl, de feldspath, de mica, de quartz gras et de pyrites.</p>  
 <p>«On voit très-bien du haut du Cramont que cette partie de la base n'est point du granit; sa couleur est d'un brun rougeâtre, elle ne se termine point par des arrêtes vives et nettes, n'est point composée de grandes tables planes. Ce font cependant des feuillets pyramidaux, mais petits et pressés les unes contre les autres; à mesure qu'ils s'approchent du sommet, et par cela même du coeur de la montagne, ils perdent leur couleur rouge, leurs angles deviennent plus vifs, leurs tables plus grandes et plus planes, et enfin prés de la cime, et à la cime même, ce sont de vrais granits parfaitement caractérisés. On peut donc conclure, que le corps entier du Mont-Blanc, et même ces bases avancées du côté de l'Italie, sont toutes de granit, excepté la base de l'arrête extérieure du côté du sud-ouest.</p>  
 <p>«§ 912. La montagne qui touche le Mont-Blanc du côté du nord-est, et qui, vue de Genève, forme en quelque maniere le premiere escalier en descendant de la cime, est aussi composée de tables de granit qui paroissent dirigées du nord-est au sud-ouest. Mais la sommité qui suit celle-ci en tirant toujours au nord-est, et qui forme le second escalier, paroît avoir quelques feuillets tournans autour de son corps pyramidal, comme les feuillets d'un artichaux, et comme j'ai dépeint l'aiguille du Midi, <i>tome</i> I. <i>pl.</i> 6. En tirant plus encore au nord-est, on reconnoît les Jorasses que nous avons vues du haut du Taléfre, § 637, elles paroissent d'ici, après le Mont-Blanc et ses escaliers, les sommités les plus élevées de toute cette chaîne, et elles semblent résulter de l'assemblage de plusieurs suites de feuillets pyramidaux convergents vers leur sommet. En général toutes les cimes élevées que l'on peut distinguer dans cette chaine, depuis le Mont-Blanc jusqu'au col Ferret, sont soutenues par des augives composées d'une ou de plusieurs suites de feuillets pyramidaux appuyés les uns contre les autres; les extérieures ont leurs bases dans le fond de la vallée, et les intérieures remontent par degrés jusqu'au haut des cimes. Les deux escaliers du Mont-Blanc sont les seules sommités qui n'aient pas des augives de ce genre.</p>  
 <p>«§ 913. Je demande á present quelle idée on peut se faire de l'origine de ces feuillets plans et de toutes ces pyramides grandes et petites qui résultent de leur assemblage, si on ne les considère pas comme les restes ou les noyaux les plus durs des couches qui out résisté aux ravages du temps, tandis que les parties intermédiaires, qui les lioient entr'elles, out été détruites par ces mêmes ravages.</p>  
 <p>«Mais jusqu'à quel point la crystallization a-t-elle contribué á déterminer ces formes pyramidales? doit-on considérer le Mont-Blanc ou telle autre de ces aiguilles, comme un énorme crystal? C'est une question de théorie que j'examinerai ailleurs. Quant à présent je me contenterai de conclure, que la face méridionale de la chaîne centrale des Alpes est, comme la face septentrionale de cette même chaîne, composée, pour la plus grande partie, de couches de granit à-peu-près verticales, et dirigées pour la plupart du nord-est au sud-ouest.»</p>  
 <p>This theoretical question of our author is so properly connected with the natural history which he has here given us, that it is not difficult to resolve it in the most satisfactory manner.</p>  
 <p>Here is an enormous mass of granite, the origin of which we are not now inquiring after, but the causes of its present form. The internal part of this granite subsists in a state of the most perfect solidity; the external again is evidently in a decaying state. This is a fact which we learn from the nature of feldspar, of which granite is in part composed; this crystallised substance is every where decomposed, where long exposed to the atmosphere. But it is not this gradual decay of the mass of granite perishing equably from its external surface, and resolved into some of its component parts, that we are here to consider; it is only mentioned to show that the mass of granite is subject to decay, when exposed to the influence of the atmosphere, like every other compound mineral body, and to lose that perfect solidity which we find in the centre of the mass.</p>  
 <p>We find the granite masses not only subject to decay from the external surface, by the decomposition of the feltspar, or the dissolution of its constituent parts, but also liable to be separated into blocks of different degrees of regularity, commonly rectangular or approaching to the rhombic shape. This is the consequence, either of larger veins and fissures, filled with matter which is still more dissolvable than is the substance of the granite, or else by imperceptible crevices or cutters, into which the atmospheric influences gradually insinuate, and form at last a visible separation.</p>  
 <p>In examining the tops of granite mountains, or where this rock is exposed to the weather, we may perceive those two species of decay proceeding together. The external surface of the stone, where there is a sufficient mixture of feltspar, is separating into grains which form a species of sand, being nothing but the particles of granite separating by means of the decaying sparry part. But a similar progress may be observed, from the external surface penetrating in lines the mass of solid rock, and dividing that mass into the rectangular blocks into which those exposed places are gradually resolved.</p>  
 <p>Now the tops of all those mountains are formed into an assemblage of pyramids, declining in height from the central pyramid; and all those pyramids are again in like manner subdivided into lesser pyramids. But the smallest of those pyramids are no other than the rectangular blocks into which those granite masses always separate by the influence of the atmosphere.</p>  
 <p>It will now be evident, that those mountains, thus resolving into separate blocks, must acquire this series of pyramidal constructions; for, in every particular mass of mountain, there must be a central part, from which the separated blocks cannot be removed, while those around, or towards the sides, are detached by the swelling water upon freezing, and separated from the more central masses which are thus the latest of being removed.</p>  
 <p>It is impossible to see this series of pyramidal relics, without at the same time perceiving that manner of formation, by the gradual resolution of the solid mass of granite, as it comes to be exposed in succession to the influences of the atmosphere, which M. de Saussure has termed <i>les ravage du temps</i>.</p>  
 <p>But if it be in this manner, that time wastes the solid masses of this globe; and if all the solid masses of the earth have acquired their solid state by the same means, <i>i.e.</i> by heat and fusion, as is maintained in the present theory, we should find similar pyramidal mountains formed of different materials. Now there can be nothing more different than masses of lime-stone and those of granite. But pyramidal mountains are equally formed of those two different materials. In plate V, under the letter B, may be seen the calcareous pyramids which are near the <i>col de la Seigne</i>, and which in plate VI. are represented under the letter G.</p>  
 <p>Here is a view of the summit of the Alps, from whence we may be allowed to draw the most important conclusions in favour of our theory.</p>  
 <p>This summit is of solid granite, a mass in which there is no stratification, such as is to be perceived in all the other masses of those alpine regions. With regard again to the extent of this mass of granite, its basis is about two leagues in breadth, by at least thrice that space in length; and now we are to consider in what shape this mass of granite presents itself to our view.</p>  
 <p>The summit of Mont Blanc, which may be considered as in the centre of this mass, is a pyramid; and this great central pyramid is surrounded by a number of other great pyramids of the same kind. The points of those pyramids are extremely lofty; and, having sides often vastly steep, if not perpendicular, those colossal pyramids rise from the icy valleys in such a shape as has given occasion to their being named <i>needles</i>. Thus we find the whole space of this granite mass consisting of a mixture of icy valleys, and pyramidal rocks on which hardly any thing rests.</p>  
 <p>Now, these lofty rocks or pointed mountains must have been either originally formed of that shape, or posteriorly hewn out by the hand of nature, gradually wasting mountains in the course of time, and operations of the surface. If it is by the first that we are to explain the present state of things, then observation is superfluous, and our reasoning is at an end; for, when even observation should not contradict the proposition, which it actually does, it would be useless, as it can afford no data from a former state, which is supposed to have been no other than it is at present; and reasoning cannot be admitted if we have no data. Therefore, if we are to reason upon the subject, we are obliged to admit, that nature must have hollowed out of the solid rock all those pyramidal mountains, and a system of inclined valleys carrying the ice from the summits.</p>  
 <p>Let us now reason from our principles, in order to see how far the present appearances of things would naturally result from those wasting causes acting upon a mass of granite, of a given basis and of sufficient height, during a space of time which is unlimited.</p>  
 <p>We are to suppose our mass of granite without any structure except that of the veins and cutters, formed by the contraction of the solid mass in cooling. Now, those separations will naturally give direction to the operation of the wasting causes, whether we consider these as chymical or mechanical. Hollow tracts would thus be formed in the solid mass; in those hollow ways would flow the water, carrying the detached portions of the rock; and those hard materials, by their attrition upon the solid mass, would more and more increase the channels in which they move. Thus there would be early formed a system of valleys in this rock, and among those valleys a number of central points, or summits over which no running water would carry hard materials to operate upon the solid rock over which it flows.</p>  
 <p>Here therefore, in the nature of things, is placed the rudiments of our needles, those colossal pyramids which acquire height gradually as the valleys widen, and whose <i>apices</i> may arrive at an angle of a certain degree of acuteness. But what a waste of rock to have formed all those needles which we find rising from the icy valleys round Mount Blanc!</p>  
 <p>Upon the supposition that this had been the origin of those pyramidal mountains, it must be evident, that there is a <i>ne plus ultra</i> of acuteness to which the <i>apex</i> of a pyramid would in time arrive; and that then the decaying summit would tumble by the lump alternately, and regain the acuteness of its point. Now, if this be the case, although we cannot see the process, which is too slow for human observation, we should actually find them in all the stages of this progress. But this is precisely the state in which the summits of those mountains are to be found. M. de Saussure gives a view of one of those pyramids, which will serve to illustrate this subject in the most perfect manner. It is from the Montanvert that this object is to be perceived. (Voyages dans les Alpes, vol. 2.).</p>  
 <p>These high peaks of solid rock demonstrate the manner in which those enormous masses of mountains are degraded, and also the means which are employed by nature for that purpose; but this scene, however well represented, is too far removed, in its appearance, from the ordinary mountains of this earth, to satisfy the doubts of every reader or to generalise a principle which must be universal in the system of this earth. We therefore have occasion for a mean, by which the extreme of those alpine summits shall be generalised or connected with our low inclined plains; and, on this occasion, I will give M. de Saussure's most excellent description of the Breven. Nothing can better suit our present purpose than the subject of this natural history; and I am persuaded that most readers will be better informed by the description of this naturalist, than they would be by their own observation.</p>  
 <p>«§. 639. J'ai déjà plusieurs fois nommé cette montagne, qui est située immédiatement au-dessus du Prieuré de Chamouni, du côté du nord-ouest: elle est liée par sa base avec les Aiguilles-rouges, dont j'ai aussi parlé dans le premier volume. Mais sa cime est nue, isolée, arrondie sur les derrières, et coupée à pic du côté de Chamouni. C'est à tous égards une des montagnes les plus intéressantes pour un naturaliste.</p>  
 <p>«J'y montai pour la premiere fois en 1760, et je ne crois pas qu'aucun naturaliste l'eût visitée avant moi; j'y retournai l'année suivante; j'y allai encore en 1767, et j'y montai enfin pour la dernière fois en 1781, afin de vérifier mes anciennes observations, et de me mettre en état d'en donner une description plus exacte.</p>  
 <p>«§ 640. On peut du Prieuré monter au sommet du Bréven et redescendre dans le même jour, mais c'est une course pénible, car il faut au moins cinq heures pour monter, et la pente est extrêmement rapide. On peut cependant faire à mulet le premier tiers de cette montée. Comme je voulus avoir le tems d'observer tout avec soin, j'y destinai deux jours, et j'allai coucher le premier jour dans un chalet, nommé <i>Plianpra</i>, qui, en partant du Prieuré, est aux deux tiers de la hauteur totale de la montagne.</p>  
 <p>«En montant à Plianpra, on fait près des trois quarts du chemin sur des débris tombés et roulés du haut de la tête du Bréven. La colline même sur laquelle est bâti le village du Prieuré n'est composée que des débris de cette montagne; ces débris ont débouché par une gorge que nous traversons en montant, et se versant ensuite à droite et à gauche, ils ont pris la forme d'un cône, dont le sommet est au milieu de cette gorge. Les collines de ce genre et de cette forme se rencontrent bien fréquemment dans les vallées bordées par de hautes montagnes.</p>  
 <p>«Ces débris, qui ne viennent pas seulement de la tête du Bréven, mais de ses flancs et de sa base, sont des roches feuilletées mélangées de quartz, de mica et de feldspath dans toutes les proportions imaginables. De ces différentes proportions naissent différens degrés de dureté, depuis le granit feuilleté le plus dur jusques à la roche micacée la plus tendre.</p>  
 <p>«§ 641. Les rochers au pied desquels on passe avant de gravir la montée rapide et herbée qui aboutit à Plianpra, sont composés d'une roche feuilletée assez dure, dont les couches bien parallèles aux veines intérieures de la pierre, suivent la direction de l'aiguille aimantée et sont très-inclinées à l'horison.</p>  
 <p>«Le chalet de Plianpra est situé au milieu d'une assez grande prairie en pente douce du côté de la vallée de Chamouni, et dominée du côté opposé par les rocs nus qui forment les sommités de la chaîne du Bréven. Du bord de cette prairie, on a une très-belle vue du Mont-Blanc, de la vallée de Chamouni et des glaciers qui y aboutissent. Ces mêmes objets se présentent avec bien plus d'éclat de la cime du Bréven; cependant la vue de Plianpra mériteroit bien que ceux qui n'auroient pas la force ou le courage d'aller jusques à la cime, montassent du moins jusque là pour s'en former une idée.</p>  
 <p>«Comme je ne voulois monter sur le Bréven que lendemain, j'employai le reste de la journée à observer les environs du chalet. J'examinai surtout avec soin des rochers situés à une demi-lieue au nord au-dessus du chalet, qui de loin paroissent colorés en rouge, comme plusieurs sommités de cette chaîne: c'est par cette raison qu'elle porte le nom <i>d'Aiguilles-rouges</i>.</p>  
 <p>«§ 642. Je trouvai que c'étoient encore des granits veinés, mélangés de quartz, de feldspath, de mica et de fer qui colore la pierre en se décomposant au-dehors: cette teinte pénètre même quelquefois assez avant dans l'intérieur. Ces rochers sont divisés par couches bien distinctes, à-peu-près verticales, et dans la direction de l'aiguille aimantée, comme celles que j'avois observées au-dessous du chalet. Ces couches sont coupées par des fentes à-peu-près perpendiculaires à leurs plans, et qui sont pour la plupart parallèles à l'horison, de maniere que ces rochers se trouvent ainsi divisés en grandes pieces de forme à-peu-près rhomboïdale. Les veines mêmes intérieures de la pierre sont aussi très-bien prononcées, et exactement parallèles à ses couches; observation générale et de la plus grande importance, parce qu'elle prouve que ces couches sont bien de vraies couches, et non point des fissures produites fortuitement par la retraite ou par un affaissement inégal des parties du rocher. Ces veines sont dessinées sur le fond blanc de la pierre des feuillets minces de mica noirâtre; elles sont tantôt planes, tantôt ondées, mais toujours régulières et parallèles entr'elles, excepté là où il se rencontre des noeuds; encore reprennent-elles leur direction après en avoir fait le tour. Comme le mica s'y trouve en petite quantité, la pierre est dure, et ne se brise qu'à grands coups de marteau. Lorsqu'on l'observe de près dans sa cassure, on voit que les petites lames ou écailles de mica sont constamment couchées dans le sens des veines de la pierre. Ces mêmes écailles n'ont presque aucune adhérence entr'elles, en sorte que les feuillets dont la pierre est composée, n'adhèrent entr'eux que par les points où il ne se trouve point de mica.</p>  
 <p>«§ 643. Je me demandois à moi-même, en observant cette pierre, s'il étoit possible qu'elle eût été formée dans cette situation verticale; si ces écailles incohérentes auroient pu venir s'attacher à ces murs verticaux, et si le mouvement des eaux, clairement indiqué par le tissu feuilleté de la pierre, n'auroit pas dû les détacher et les faire tomber à mesure qu'elles se formoient. Je me demandois encore, si les fentes qui coupent ces feuillets, perpendiculairement à leurs plans, ne dateroient point d'un tems ou ces couches auroient été horisontales, et n'auroient point été produites alors par le poids et l'affaissement inégal des parties de la pierre. Mais pour admettre cette supposition, il faudroit expliquer comment ces bancs, d'abord horisontaux, ont pu se redresser; pourquoi ce redressement a été si fréquent, si régulier, etc. etc. Je réserve pour un autre tems la discussion de ces grandes questions; mais je ne crois pas inutile de faire apercevoir la liaison qu'ont avec la théorie des observations si minutieuses en apparence.</p>  
 <p>«En faisant ces réflexions, je retournai au chalet de Plianpra où je passai la nuit sur de la paille que j'avois fait étendre auprès du feu, parce que la soirée étoit extrêmement fraîche.</p>  
 <p>«§ 645 On commence à monter par de jolis sentiers peu inclinés, pratiqués le long d'un grand rocher semblable à ceux que j'avois observés la veille. On a ensuite le choix de monter, ou par des pentes couvertes de rocailles un peu fatigantes, ou par des gazons extrêmement rapides. Ceux-ci paroissent d'abord plus agréables et moins pénibles; cependant ces gazons sont si serrés et si glissans, qu'ils en deviennent dangereux, au moins pour ceux qui n'ont pas l'habitude des montagnes. Ces rocailles sont débris de roches feuilletées, semblables à celles que l'on rencontre en montant du Prieuré à Plianpra.</p>  
 <p>«§ 646. B. Au bout d'une heure de marche, on arrive au pied d'un rocher assez escarpé, qu'il faut escalader pour parvenir à la cime de la montagne. C'est une roche micacée, mais qui contient cependant assez de quartz pour avoir de la consistance. Elle se sépare par feuillets si décidés, que sans employer d'autre instrument que mes mains, j'en détachai une dalle, qui avoit sept pieds de hauteur sur quatre de largeur, et à peine un pouce dans sa plus grande épaisseur.</p>  
 <p>«J'avois quelque desir de descendre de-là au pied des grandes tables verticales qui composent la tête du Bréven, pour les observer de près et comparer ainsi leur base avec leur cime; mais de cet endroit la chose est impossible, la pente est d'une telle rapidité qu'une pierre médiocrement grosse, que je mis en mouvement, roula avec beaucoup de vitesse, en entraîna d'autres, celles-ci d'autres, et elles formèrent enfin un torrent de pierres qui se précipita avec un fracas mille fois répété par les grands rochers du Bréven.</p>  
 <p>«Comme donc je ne pouvois pas descendre, je montai par le passage ordinaire, qui est une espèce de couloir ou de cheminée ouverte, adossée à un rocher presqu'à pic, de 40 ou 50 pieds de hauteur. Bien des curieux sont venus jusques au pied de ce passage sans oser le franchir; mais je vis en revenant qu'à un demi-quart de lieue plus au nord, on trouve un autre passage extrêmement commode, qui mène au même but, et qu'il faut par conséquent toujours préférer.</p>  
 <p>«Ce rocher une fois escaladé, on monte par une pente douce, sans danger et sans fatigue, jusqu'au sommet du Bréven.</p>  
 <p>«§ 646. C. En montant le long du bord, du côté de Chamouni, j'eus un plaisir inexprimable à contempler les magnifiques tables de granit dont est composée toute la tête de cette montagne. Car bien que les écailles du mica noirâtre dont cette roche est mélangée, soient parallèles entr'elles et lui donnent ainsi quelque ressemblance avec une roche feuilletée, cependant la quantité de quartz et de feldspath qui entrent dans sa composition, son extrême dureté, le peu de disposition qu'elle a à se fondre dans le sens de ses feuillets, la placent, sinon pour le nomenclateur, du moins pour le naturaliste, dans la classe des vrais granits <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">18</font></a>; et le parfait parallélisme de ces feuillets avec les faces des grandes tables, ou des grandes divisions du rocher, démontre que ces tables sont des couches, et non des parties séparées par des fissures accidentelles.»</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>«L'extrême régularité de ces tables achève de démontrer que ce sont de véritables couches. Leurs plans qui sont ici à découvert dans une hauteur perpendiculaire de plus de 500 pieds, sont parfaitement suivis, comme taillés au ciseau, dirigés tous comme l'aiguille aimantée, et verticaux, à quelques degrés près dont ils s'appuyent contre le corps de la montagne. On s'assure en montant que cette structure est celle de la montagne entière; on voit les profils d'une infinité de ces couches, on passe sur les sommités de ces tranches verticales, et on les voit se prolonger dans cette même direction tout au travers de la montagne. Or je demande si un naturaliste qui aura observé cet ensemble et ces détails pourra regarder cette montagne comme le produit du concours fortuit de grains de sable agglutinés entr'eux.</p>  
 <p>«Ces tables sont coupées un peu obliquement à leurs plans par des fentes dont la plupart sont à-peu-près horizontales et d'autres trés-inclinées à l'horizon. La pierre se trouve ainsi très-fréquemment coupée en parallélépipèdes obliquangles. Ces mêmes fentes rendent raison, d'une observation que j'avois faite en 1776. En examinant avec une bonne lunette, depuis une fenêtre du Prieuré, les faces verticales des couches de la sommité du Bréven, j'avois remarqué un grand dieze <a name="img_v2img00"></a>
 <img src="img/v2img00.jpg"> bien nettement écrit sur la face de la montagne, je le vis de prés en 1781, et je reconnus qu'il étoit formé par quatre de ces fentes qui se coupoient obliquement.</p>  
 <p>«§ 647. La cime de la montagne est une pointe mousse, coupée à pic du côté de la vallée de Chamouni et arrondie de tous les autres côtés. Cette tête est entièrement couverte de débris et de blocs confusément entassé. On est étonné de trouver là ces débris, car cette cime est absolument isolée, et séparée par de larges et profondes vallées des sommités qui la surpassent en hauteur: il semble que ces débris n'aient pu tomber que du ciel; mais quand on les examine avec soin, on voit qu'ils sont du même genre de pierre que la montagne elle même; et que tous leurs angles font vifs, leurs faces planes et leur forme souvent rhomboïdale. On reconnoît donc par là que les parties supérieures de la montagne, qui sont plus exposées aux injures de l'air et qui ne sont pas assujetties par des masses situées au-dessus d'elles, se délitent et se separent. Je trouvai cependant sur la cime une pierre d'une espece différente; c'étoit une roche composée de schorl noir en aiguilles, de quartz et de grenats; sa forme étoit exactement rhomboïdale. Mais ce genre de pierre se rencontre assez souvent en filons dans les roches feuilletées et dans les granits veinés; il est donc vraisemblable que le filon auquel ce fragment avoit appartenu s'est détruit avec la partie supérieure du rocher, du moins n'en ai-je pu trouver aucun indice dans la partie solide de la montagne.</p>  
 <p>«L'admirable régularité des couches de cette cime élevée mérite l'attention des amateurs de la géologie, et la vue qu'elle présente dédommageroit seule de la peine d'y monter.</p>  
 <p>«§ 648. Mon but principal dans la premiere course que je fis au Bréven étoit de prendre de là une idée juste des glaciers de la vallée de Chamouni, de leur forme, de leur position, et de l'ensemble des montagnes sur lesquelles ils sont situés. Comme cette montagne est postée à-peu-près au milieu de la vallée de Chamouni, en face du Mont-Blanc et vis-à-vis des principaux glaciers qui en descendent, c'étoit certainement un des meilleurs observatoires que l'on pût choisir dans cette intention. J'y montai par le jour le plus beau et le plus clair; c'étoit mon premier voyage dans les hautes Alpes, je n'étois point encore accoutumé à ces grands spectacles; en sorte que cette vue fit sur moi une impression qui ne s'effacera jamais de mon souvenir.</p>  
 <p>«On découvre tout-à-la-fois et presque dans un seul tableau les six glaciers qui vont se verser dans la vallée de Chamouni, les cimes inaccessibles entre lesquelles ils prennent leur naissance; le Mont-Blanc surtout, que l'on trouve d'autant plus grand, d'autant plus majestueux, qu'on l'observe d'un lieu plus élevé. On voit ces étendues immenses de neige et de glaces, dont, malgré leur distance, on a peine à soutenir l'éclat, ces beaux glaciers qui s'en détachent comme autant de fleuves solides qui vont entre de grandes forêts de sapins, descendre en replis tortueux, et se verser au fond de la vallée de Chamouni; les yeux fatigués de l'éclat de ces neiges et de ces glaces se reposent délicieusement ou sur ces forêts, dont le verd foncé contraste avec la blancheur des glaces qui les traversent, ou dans la fertile et riante vallée qu'arrosent les eaux qui découlent de ces glaciers.»</p>  
 <p>Our object at present is not to see the degradation of that great mass of granite out of which have been hewn, by the hand of time and influences of the atmosphere, these lofty pyramids which surround Mont-Blanc; it is to see the degradation of that immense mass of vertical or highly inclined strata, out of which that great mass of granite rises; and it is to understand the conical and rounded forms which are to be perceived more or less in all the inferior mountains, where apparently the degradation has come to a stand, and where the surface is actually employed in vegetation, or in maintaining the system of living bodies in this world.</p>  
 <p>How high those vertical strata may have been erected, or how much may have been wasted of that mass in forming the mountains and their valleys, is a question which it is impossible to resolve: It is evident, however, that this quantity must have been very great. In the Mont-Rosa we find those strata at present in the horizontal situation, as high as the summits of those granite pyramids that overlook the mass of vertical strata which we are now considering; and, in those mountains of Rosa, the valleys are most profound. It is therefore most reasonable to suppose, that the mass out of which the Breven and all the other mountains had been formed, was once as high, at least, as the summit of Mont-Blanc. It is altogether inconceivable, that this mass of vertical and horizontal strata could have been formed, either originally, or by any mineral operation, into the present shape of things; therefore, we must look out for another cause.</p>  
 <p>Let us now suppose them degraded by the hand of time, and all their moveable materials transported in the floods; In what state would they be left for our examination?—Here is a question that must decide the theory of those mountains; for, if it is not possible to conceive the present appearances as arising from any other cause than this gradual degradation which we see operating at present, we must conclude that this is the system of nature established for the purpose of this world. But this is the very state in which they are found; every where the solid parts are going into decay, and furnishing those heaps of earth and stones that form the slopes by which we ascend from step to step. Wherever earth and stones may lie, there they are found to form a bank for vegetation; whenever these loose materials are carried away to a lower; station, the more solid parts above are still decaying in order to furnish more. There is not one step in all this progress, (of the summit of the solid mountain forming earth and stones, and travelling to the sea) that is not to be actually perceived, although it is only <i>scientifically</i> that man, who reasons in the present moment, may see the effect of time which has no end.</p>  
 <p>The summit of the granite pyramids of Mont-Blanc, the summit of the Breven, that of the Saleve <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">19</font></a>, and of every little hillock upon the surface of the earth, attest this truth, that there is no other natural means by which this end may be attained. It is true, indeed, that geologists every where imagine to themselves great events, or powerful causes, by which these changes of the earth should be brought about in a short space of time; but they are under a double deception; <i>first</i> with regard to time which is limited, whereas they want to explain appearances by a cause acting in a limited time; <i>secondly</i>, with regard to operation, their supposition of a great <i>debacle</i> is altogether incompetent for the end required. How, for example, accumulate the <i>debris</i> of the Breven, as we have now seen, upon the summit of that mountain, by the force of running water? But this is only one of a thousand appearances that proves the operations of time, and refutes the hypothesis of violent causes.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>From the top of those decaying pyramids to the sea, we have a chain of facts which clearly demonstrate this proposition, That the materials of the wasted mountains have travelled through the rivers; for, in every step of this progress, we may see the effect, and thus acknowledge the proper cause. We may often even be witness to the action; but it is only a small part of the whole progress that we may thus perceive, nevertheless it is equally satisfactory as if we saw the whole; for, throughout the whole of this long course, we may see some part of the mountain moving some part of the way. What more can we require? Nothing but time. It is not any part of the process that will be disputed; but, after allowing all the parts, the whole will be denied; and, For what?—only because we are not disposed to allow that quantity of time which the ablution of so much wasted mountain might require.</p>

Un de ces derniers prétend que ce que je nomme granit veiné n'est qu'un amas de gravier graniteux, et par conséquent une espèce de grès grossier. Mais je voudrois que ceux qui de bonne foi pourroient croire que j'aie commis une erreur aussi grossière et aussi fréquemment répétée, observassent les granits du Bréven; et j'en enverrais volontiers à ceux d'entr'eux que le souhaiteroient. Lorsqu'ils verroient que les parties de quartz et de feldspath qui entrent dans leur composition, ont tous leurs angles vifs et tranchans, que ces parties sont intimement unies entre elles et empâtées les unes avec les autres, comme dans les granits en masse; que leur cohérence est aussi grande que dans ces derniers granits, et que cette roche n'en diffère absolument, comme je l'ai déjà dit, que par le parallélisme qu'observent entr'elles les lames rares de mica dont elle est mélangée: je suis persuadé qu'ils reconnoîtroient qu'elle a tous les caractères essentiels du ranit, qu'elle doit avoir la même origine, et qu'en un mot elle est au granit proprement dit, ce qu'une pierre calcaire feuilletée est à une pierre calcaire dans laquelle on ne distingue point de feuillets.»</p>
