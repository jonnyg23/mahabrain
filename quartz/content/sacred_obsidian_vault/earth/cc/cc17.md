 <p>AFTER "scientific" men reach the position in mental concept and conviction that the earth is hollow, and that earthquakes are the result of the vibrations of a shell composed of layers of metals--placed one upon another in contiguous succession--beaten out by the processes of Nature's pulsations to form the rind or pediment of the superimposed atmospheres, and that volcanoes are the result of chemical pustules sometimes produced by the igneous union of natural gas, petroleum, and coal mines, in this rind or skin of the great hollow sphere, they may take one more step and apply the true laws of analogical construction and discover that we are on the inner surface of the sphere.</p>  
 <p>The world is hollow. In the physical sense every principle of reason confirms and demonstrates this belief. This is not all. The surface occupied by man is concave; and though so called scientific men m butt their heads against the adamantine wall of truth, succeeding generations will look back to the GUIDING STAR and FLAMING SWORD as the harbingers of true wisdom regarding cosmogonical construction.</p>  
 <p>By slow processes and roundabout methods the world gradually gropes its way through the darkness toward the dawn of the coning day; gradually the light reveals the forms of life, and enables them to be studied in the light and application of genuine science. The plumbline is the only true first step in every</p>  
 <p><a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 131</font></a></p>  
 <p>rational demonstration. This is the first scientific element in the hand of the Koreshan, in the formulation of the trigonometrical calculus of demonstration.</p>  
 <p>"When I wake in the morning and cast my eyes toward the east, I see a tree, forty rods away, and the rising sun, about six thousand miles distant, at the same instant. If it be true that a substance has to leave my brain and extend to a distant object, by means of which an impulse is carried back to the brain, it travels with a speed beyond my comprehension, and just as quickly to a distant object as to a near one."--[<i>Excerpt from letter to Koresh</i>.]</p>  
 <p>Koreshan Cosmogony holds that the central sun is less than four thousand miles away and invisible to us, and that the projected sun is at the point of the conjunction of our atmosphere with the atmosphere of hydrogen resting upon it. So that objection is obviated. Light or visual force is rapid, but it is not impossible for the mind to distinguish the difference between its communication at short or long distances.</p>  
 <p>I have stood upon the shore of Lake Michigan and in the distance, say about three miles from Chicago, have observed a permanent object. I closed my eyes for a few seconds, with their direction toward it. Instantly upon opening them I observed near objects, but it required about three seconds for the distant one to come into view. Visual "energy" is a thousand-fold more rapid than electrical "energy."</p>  
 <p>The sun at the center, or comprising a solar limbus to the astral nucleus, is constructed upon the basis of a helix. Like the astral center around which it forms a hemisphere, it has a light and a dark side. Its axis is inclined to the circumference of the earth, or to the earth's axis, in the same proportion as in the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 132</font></a></p>  
 <p>commonly accepted theory of astronomy, the earth's axis is supposed to be inclined to her own orbit around the sun.</p>  
 <p>The sun having a light and a dark side, is the recipient of an influx of spirit from the dark circumference, or semi-circumference, while it is projecting from its light side the "energy" of light to be focalized, in its projection through atmospheres and spheres of "energy," at two points; making in all three distinct suns; one for the highest atmosphere, one for the middle atmosphere, and one for the third, last, and outermost atmosphere. The last one focalized is the one which shines in our own circumference, and is visible to the natural eye.</p>  
 <p>As the astral center revolves upon its axis, its projections from its photoic side (being focal points from this side) must necessarily move in orbits around the astral nucleus. The peculiar relation of the astral axis to the earth's circumference, and therefore to the orbits of the projected suns, causes them to move in spirals, north and south, determining the seasons. As this motion is as if there were a process of winding, like the winding of thread upon a bobbin or spool, or like the wire upon a piece of steel, as in the magnetic battery, the Greeks called the sun helios; to wind in spirals.</p>  <h3 align="center">The Sun a Great Magneto-electric Battery</h3>  
 <p>The sun in its relation to the earth is nothing more nor less than a great compound magneto-electric battery, generating distinctively six primary "energies;" namely, light and. heat, one pair; electricity and magnetism, the second pair, and levity and gravity, the third pair. These are respectively, in the order</p>  
 <p><a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 133</font></a></p>  
 <p>named above, photoic, caloric, electric, magnetic, levic, and gravic "energy." They are merely what were material substances reduced to the most subtle solutions. Though they are "energies" and substantial,--composed of what had been atoms of matter,--they are no longer material, but spiritual. If an atom of matter is destroyed as an atom of matter, it at once becomes the spirit of that quality or kind of matter, and while just as substantial as before, is no longer material.</p>  
 <p>The astral center, with its concomitant solar system, revolves upon its axis; the earth being relatively and comparatively stationary. At the center of the system, this being about four thousand miles from the circumference or concave habitable surface, is a peculiar formation resulting from the emplacements of "energy," disposed or arranged by co-operative activities of refraction and reflection. This arrangement assumes the form of a tabernacle and tent, more nearly described by the Scriptural exposition than can be expressed in any other form of language.</p>  
 <p>Such cosmogonical construction is in harmony with all forms of creation, and has the advantage of being in agreement with the laws of development as everywhere observed, wheresoever the order of growth comes within the scope of observation and reason. In this system we have the great cell or egg of development, the progress of growth corresponding to the general law of incubation.</p>  
 <p>We are not begging the so called conservative people of the world to even examine the Koreshan System of Cosmogony. We do not fall upon our knees to fogyism. We have the true theory of construction, and know whereof we affirm. We declare our doctrine,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 134</font></a></p>  
 <p>knowing it will gain adherents from the thinking and reasoning people who are looking for some positive and tangible expression of the truths of Deity.</p>  <h3 align="center">Moon the Compound Reflection of all the Strata. Liquid Mercury the Intermetallic Substance</h3>  
 <p>It will be remembered that the moon is reflected from the strata comprising the metallic crust of the sphere. The action of the sun upon the earth is in reality the action of the sun upon the moon. The moon is not the reflection of any single stratum, but the compound reflection of all the strata. The penetration of the thermal and cruosic rays into the strata, causing the alternate expansion and contraction of the metallic laminæ, observes a spiral course in the laminæ, corresponding to the gyral motion of the sun.</p>  
 <p>As the heat expands the metallic substances the spaces between them contract; and as the cruosic substance contracts the laminæ, the spaces between expand. The result is an outward spiral current of the substance which fills the interstices between the laminæ.</p>  
 <p>The menstruum filling the vacuities, and which is being pushed along through a continual spiral from north to south and from south to north, between the tropics, or over forty-seven degrees of the earth's laminæ, is mercury (quicksilver), holding in liquid solution the elements of the intermetallic channel.</p>  
 <p>The motion of the sun is not merely a spiral north and south, but a spiral, enlarging and diminishing itself alternately, having a maximum and minimum field, or circuit of motion; hence there are alternate periods of approximation to, and remoteness from, the concave surface of the earth.</p>  
 <p>This approach of the orbit to, and departure from,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 135</font></a></p>  
 <p>the earth is the phenomenon called by astronomers perihelion and aphelion; from <i>peri</i>, around or near; and <i>apo</i>, distant or away from, and helios, the sun.</p>  
 <p>In Koreshan nomenclature it would be called the sun's perigee, near the earth; and the sun's apogee, distant from the earth, as indicating the nearest and remotest points of his approach and departure as he describes his helical orbit.</p>  
 <p>The cause of all motion resides, primarily, in the voluntary principle of the perfect human (God) mind. We say the God mind, referring the reader to the mind of the God-Man, the illustrious Christ of God, in whom was the fulness of the Godhead bodily; God in him having attained the ultimates of his being, he constituting the <i>esse</i> and <i>existere</i> of Deity.</p>  
 <p>Voluntary action begets the involuntary, its antithetical co-ordinate. The supreme cause of motion is in desire; and the supreme desire is love toward God as. a function of the ascending man, and the love of God toward man, as the function of the descending attraction of God. These two co-ordinate attractions result in conjunctive unity of the two, and God and man become one.</p>  
 <p>This law of motion is all pervasive, being let down by gradation through all the degrees of motion until its potencies operate outwardly into the alchemico-organic world. It is therefore seen that all the motions of the alchemico-organic, while originating in voluntary thought, are not the direct and immediate operation of mind upon those domains of activity; but there is a correspondence between the two, and the analogy is so perfect that a correct interpretation of the alchemico-organic will furnish, through correspondence, the correct interpretation of the anthropostic.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">Cause of Perigee, Apogee, and Helical Motions</h3>  
 <p>The proximate cause of the perigee and apogee of the orbit of the sun resides in the laws of expansion and contraction, induced by the alternation of heat and cold as follows: Heat is the result of friction; where there is the more resistance there is the more friction; and where there is the more friction there is more intense combustion. There can be no exception to this law.</p>  
 <p>The thermal substance of the sun is most intense at the vertical point of radiation, less intense as the rays are more oblique, and least intense at the lateral ray. This would be true even though the heat were measured at points of equal distance on every line of divergence. The pole opposite the vertical ray would be the coldest point.</p>  
 <p>Let us suppose the central and vertical substance of the sun to be potassium. The direct action of this ray would not constitute a thermal ray; but if this spirit meets, in its radiation to the circumference, the converging or afferent flow of cruosine, or cruosic substance, the resistance produces the friction from which proceeds the heat, precisely as flame will proceed from the union of potassium and ice.</p>  
 <p>Just as we have the north pole and the equator where two opposite conditions obtain, so we have the north side of the sum and the south side, where opposite conditions also obtain; and the alternation of these attitudes alternates the sides of expansion and contraction. This relative action produces the deviation of orbital motion.</p>  
 <p>The actinism of the sun's substance as he is caused to approach to or recede from the concavity within which he revolves, is successively specific upon the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 137</font></a></p>  
 <p>metallic laminæ which his substances penetrate, subjecting them to the successive alternation of heat and cold, applied to the contiguous layers, penetrating first the strata nearest the surface of the earth, and successively reaching the more outer layers until he acts upon the outermost.</p>  <h3 align="center">Outermost Metallic Plate of Earth's Crust the Greatest in Specific Gravity</h3>  
 <p>That it may not appear (in this solution of the moon problem) that the discussion of the operations of the sun comprises the more prominent factor, we will here reiterate the statement that the moon is the product of the influence of the sun's activities upon the terrestrial strata. We cannot, therefore, discuss the origin, form, and function of the moon independently of a general and specific consideration of solar functions and phenomena.</p>  
 <p>The reader is already familiar with the fact that the crust, shell, or rind of the earth is composed of contiguous laminæ or strata, concave in form, in seven primary metallic plates, superimposed one upon another; that which is greatest in specific gravity constituting the outermost plate, while the others are arranged according to diminution in the ratio of their specific gravities.</p>  
 <p>The operation of the sun's gyre (spiral motion) in the penetration of his essences into these metallic crusts acts specifically upon them, primarily, according to the quality of the physical spirit, whether it be photoic, scotoic, cruosic or thermic;--these being his primary substances.</p>  
 <p>The penetration of the thermal physical spirit must assume the form of a circular impression upon the laminæ, and must move in a spiral or gyre in the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a></p>  
 <p>direction of the gyre of the sun as he winds his helix north and south. The phenomenon following this action of the thermal radiation, manifest in the laminæ, would be singular in this: That as heat expands more where most intense, and less where least intense, the plates would become thickest at the vertical penetration (that is, where the thermal ray was perpendicular to the central radius), and thinnest at the circumference of the radiation.</p>  
 <p>Hence, between two plates (laminæ) pressed together by the process of expansion the interstice would be filled. If, twelve hours later, there follows this process of expansion and closer contiguity of the laminæ, a process of contraction by virtue of the action of cruosic physical spirit, a circular concavity would follow the spiral course of the obliterated interstice. This concavity being filled with mercury, there would necessarily move a circular disk of mercurial solution in a spiral course from tropic to tropic.</p>  
 <p>This would provide an amalgamated surface for each of the laminæ, acting at once as a conservator of the superfice and intrafice of the contiguous laminæ, and as an insulator and channel for the magnetic current generated in the activities of the solution and the lamina.</p>  <h3 align="center">The Sun Has Secondary Gyre</h3>  
 <p>Added to the common and primary gyral or helical motion of the sun in his annual course north and south between the tropics, he has an axillary motion around an axis perpendicular to the concavity of the earth, hence the solar substances are disseminated in a spiral, and this momentum is imparted to the mercurial discus, which, in addition to its motion with the solar</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_13800"></a>
 </p><p align="CENTER">

 <p><a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 139</font></a></p>  
 <p>helix, revolves from the impetus of the imparted solar axillation.</p>  
 <p>There are four primary laws of motion originating and moving as follows: The first impulse from combustion is radiatory; this meets the counter and resistant moment [motion] forming the circular, which, in a second resistance, is transformed to the spiral. The impact of the radiatory with the resistant, convergent, or afferent flow of physical spirit produces the undulatory or coruscatory movement.</p>  
 <p>With the secondary solar gyre, as with the primary helix, there are four primary polar points corresponding to the caloric, cruosic, photoic, and scotoic nuclei; and corresponding substances are radiated toward the metallic circumferences. From these centers there are secondary disci of mercurial solution formed in the inter-metallic spaces, which, by the secondary solar gyre, are caused to move in orbits around the primary discus in some of the planes.</p>  
 <p>Between the outer laminæ, upon the gold stratum, instead of there being formed a number of disci surrounding the primary discus, the vermiculation (peristaltic motion) is less complete, and the disci merge into rings of mercurial solution. The secondary disci of some of the inter-metallic laminæ are reflected into the heavens as so called moons of the planets (the "moons of Jupiter" are from such sources), and the mercurial rings as rings of Saturn.</p>  
 <p>The radiation of the solar substances toward and into the laminæ is not direct from the Solar center to each of the circumferential strata. The radiation of physical spirit from one stratum to another, through all the seven laminæ, is successive, observing a</p>  
 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a></p>  
 <p>graduated scale of transmission; the ratio of increase being a geometrical formula mathematically governed by the complex square of the ratios of specific gravity and places of deposition.</p>  
 <p>The operation of these laws, comprising the principles of both motion and form, would impart the peristaltium to the strata (laminæ), which continues in them after the direct action of the solar radiation has passed over the plates.</p>  
 <p>There is a primary mercurial discus between each pair of strata. Each discus pursues its spiral course, moved by the thermal physical spirit along the track mapped out by the course of the solar gyre. When we consider the fact that the disci are moved along their spiral course upon the surfaces of these seven metallic laminæ, and associate this fact with the fact that the momentum diminishes (from the inner to the outer discus) with the square of the complex ratios above noted, we are supplied with the data from which may be accounted that specific relative motion of the planets, wherein those of the inner orbits overtake those of the outer, and the laws of their annual circuits propounded and elaborated.</p>  
 <p>The planets proper are general aggregations of physical spirit heaped up through the reflection of the solar physical spirit from the metallic laminæ. The substances from these aggregations converge to the astral nucleus and are thence planted, through this nucleus or focal point, by a succession of divergences and refractions, upon the mercurial disci, and are again reflected from these and impressed upon the planetary stratifications in the heavens.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 141</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">The Peculiar Office of Mercury as a General Solvent</h3>  
 <p>Thus far, we have considered only the specific action of the two antithetical substances (caloric and cruosic) upon the laminæ and disci, as effecting the peristaltic progress in the gyre of their circuits. The observation of these depends upon the action of the photoine and scotoine, or the light and the dark substances moving in their gyrations, respectively, between the calorine and the cruosine impulses.</p>  
 <p>The photoic physical spirit acts specifically different from either calorine or cruosine. It has a subtle power of penetrability into and through the mercurial disci, imparting to the atoms comprising the compound solution held in amalgamation in mercury as the basis of the solvency, differential motion, as each quality reacts against the penetrating photoine.</p>  
 <p>That the above may be clearly comprehended, it will be well to recall to mind the fact that mercury attracts to itself (as it passes along, washing the metallic surfaces) the metallic atoms loosened by the action of the thermal and other substances, and absorbs and dissolves them.</p>  
 <p>The mercurial solution is consequently a general solvent for the metallic substances through which it passes; therefore, as the photoine penetrates the discus it imparts a precipitate motion to the general substance in solution, for the atom of each kind receives a motion of its own in resistance to the photoic impulse.</p>  
 <p>The passage of the mercurial solution is not confined to any single interspace; for at the tropics and the equator (where the ecliptic and equatorial circles meet) there are openings for the evacuation of the menstrua from the various interspaces, and their discharge into other interspaces.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 142</font></a></p>  
 <p>While the menstruum of one cavity is making its passage through one of the metallic interspaces, it both attracts to itself the substances of the surfaces to which it is exposed, and makes certain depositions to the surface through which it is passing, of the elements derived from its passage through a former one.</p>  
 <p>The continuous spiral canal through which the menstruum is impulsed by the action of the solar substances in the alternate expansion and contraction of the metallic strata is, so to speak, a sort of alimentary canal, and corresponds, in the alchemico-organic cosmos, to the alimentary canal of the human body; the functions being correspondentially the same. There is a correspondence also in the number and form of the divisions.</p>  <h3 align="center">Photo-Alchemic Action Determines Color Resistance</h3>  
 <p>That property of actinism through which the photoic reagency is manifest is largely influential in the determinations of the metamorphosis or transmutation of metallic elements; but it is not the only factor of the mutative processes. Every pigmentation is the result of the reagency of scotoic and photoic substances, and while it adds greatly to ornate attractiveness, this is not its only function. Processes of assimilation are dependent upon coloring as well as upon other factors of assimilation.</p>  
 <p>The character of the motion imparted to an atom of matter by photo-alchemic action upon the particle is determined by the resistance of the color, (each color offering its specific resistance,) being differently agitated, hence more or less rapidly metamorphosed and, therefore, differently posited.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a></p>  
 <p>No two atoms of matter of a given kind, going to make up the bulk of a mass, are differently posited in the mass without having yielded to different qualities of the same kind of force entering as a factor into the disposition of the atoms. Variations of shade in coloring, so slight that they could not be detected by the eye, would be sufficient to determine different depositions of the atoms.</p>  
 <p>That the reader may not labor under any false impression regarding the transmission of the solar substances, it will be well to state here that what we have denominated a thermal ray becomes the essence of heat only when a descending physical spirit of one kind meets the essence of an opposite kind. The heat is generated at the point and time of meeting.</p>  
 <p>No two substances can meet and produce their effect except as they form their conjunction and correlation in the form of matter adapted to the union and transmutation to be effected. Let us take, for illustration, the process of the formation of chloride of sodium in the ocean.</p>  <h3 align="center">How Chloride of Sodium Is Formed</h3>  
 <p>Sodium in minute quantities is constantly conveyed to the waters of the ocean, or any inland sea having no outlet, and transformed to chloride of sodium through the descent of solar essence. While it may not properly be called chlorine essence, the descending substance (meeting a co-ordinate ascending essence) does, in its union in the atom of sodium, produce chloride of sodium; and because there is no outlet to the ocean or sea, the solution accumulates.</p>  
 <p>We have entered but briefly into the exposition of the principle of photoine (light), in its action of differentiation</p>  
 <p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 144</font></a></p>  
 <p>in the process of deposition and assimilation. The mere presentation and study of the subject for a knowledge of the fact, would not be worth the while of the student and investigator. It is only when we apprehend the bearing of such knowledge upon life itself as pertaining to our relationship to God and to one another, in the fulfilment of uses to the neighbor in the performance of which we insure, by reflex action, the greatest use to self, that the joy of acquisition is experienced.</p>  
 <p>Precisely as light differentiates, selects, and rejects, with darkness as the background of resistance and impression, so does truth differentiate between good and evil, with fallacy as the background to insure contrast and enable the truth to direct in the acceptance of good and the rejection of evil.</p>  
 <p>The scotoic pole follows the photoic in the progress of the sun's gyre, and brings its influence to bear upon the particles differentiated and directed by the operation of light, not in a direct manner, but indirectly through its influence to obstruct or hold in rest the substance that did not directly respond to the influence of photoine.</p>  
 <p>As the determination of photoine accelerates differently each quality of atom upon which it reacts, when scotoine reacts it must perform its function to retard the various atoms where it finds them, this being at different places, because the momentum of photoic acceleration has given to each quality a different impulse from every other kind.</p>  
 <p>In the reagencies of photoine and scotoine, we possess the properties which co-ordinately determine the emplacement of substances in the order of strata;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 145</font></a></p>  
 <p>therefore, the law of stratification. The compactness of the strata is determined by their compression through the alternate action of expansion and contraction, which is a process of beating the metallic substances forming the strata into thin, hard plates denominated, in the description of creation given in Genesis, <i>rakiya</i>; in English, rendered firmament.</p>  
 <p>We have already compared the motion and current of the laminas and disci with the alimentary canal in the human body. This not merely because there is a similarity in their motions, but because the alchemico-organic universe is the correspondent of the Grand Man, or the general anthropostic world; and in the doubling up of the contents of the cellular cosmos, in the process of the incubation of the great egg or cell of the universe, that part of the environment of the egg becomes the alimentary channel of the dispensations, and these correspond to the alimentary canal of the vidual man.</p>  <h3 align="center">Candid Investigation Would Soon Convince a Truth Seeker</h3>  
 <p>The mind that conceived the Copernican system, arising in the dark ages, was so simple as to take an appearance for a fact, and to deduce a theory which better thinkers of more modern times would very soon dispose of were it not for the fact that they will not take time to think.</p>  
 <p>We have shown by repeated illustrations that the convex theory cannot be true; but the astronomers and scientists, with their inconceivable bigotry, having gone crazy through the hallucinations of mediæval times, must lose their reputations as scientific men (and their bread and butter also) if they permit the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 146</font></a></p>  
 <p>world to be set right with regard to questions upon which they have built up for themselves names, and, through this, are honored as great lights and educators of the people.</p>  
 <p>If any man with brains, having facts at his command, will give two hours' candid and unbiased thought to the investigation of this subject, with the application of the principles of foreshortening as set forth in the literature of the Koreshan Unity, he will be convinced of the truth of the Cellular Cosmogony and of the utter absurdity of the so called Copernican hallucination.</p>  
 <p>We are told that we do not exhibit the spirit and principle of the Christ, regarding the so called scientists, when we resort to language sometimes seen in THE FLAMING SWORD. What difference does it make whether we say, as did the Lord, "fools and blind," blind fools, blind idiots, or blind bigots and idiots. He told the truth, because it was the best way to exasperate people and set them thinking.</p>  
 <p>Koreshanity has the truth, but the present humanity (steeped in tobacco, rum, and sensualism) prefers to meet the truth of Koreshanity with ridicule rather than to give it candid consideration. But as ridicule is always the strongest argument, and the one that usually has the greatest weight with the non-thinking mind, it is not surprising that the so called scientist usually takes refuge behind it when meeting a rational force that otherwise is irresistible.</p>
