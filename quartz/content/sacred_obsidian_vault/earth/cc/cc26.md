 <p>IT IS CLAIMED that the surface of the earth moves from west to east nearly twenty-five thousand miles in twenty-four hours. This is a solid body moving through space, according to modern science, at a rotary speed of over one thousand miles an hour, or more than sixteen miles per minute.</p>  
 <p>Can any sane man imagine that a solid body with this rate of speed, surrounded by a thin atmosphere, could so carry its atmosphere with its momentum as not to produce a contrary motion of the atmosphere, while at the same time it would cause the rotation of an oscillating pendulum?</p>  
 <p>No one disputes the fact of the motion of the pendulum as first observed by Foucault, and later experimented with by Flammarion. We might, however, question the uniform direction of the oscillating pendulum in a series of experiments. But allowing the experiment to be fair and the motion as reported, we would inquire, What causes such a phenomenon?</p>  
 <p>Whatsoever the cause of the motion it must be considered with regard to two propositions. The first, the supposition that the earth revolves because the heavens <i>appear</i> to revolve; and the motion of the pendulum</p>  
 <p><a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 201</font></a></p>  
 <p>is taken as corroborative testimony to an hypothesis, a guess, which still hangs in doubt with the astronomers, for the reason that with howsoever much reinforcement you sustain a guess, it still remains hypothetical; and the astronomers will not stop seeking for still further corroboration because they are still in doubt. We wish to assure our readers that the problem is not settled under the Copernican system.</p>  
 <p>The second proposition is, that the Koreshan Geodetic Survey has settled forever the fact that the earth is a concave shell, and that man inhabits the cellular sphere. If it could be proven that the earth rotates, then the pendulum would act the same on the inner as it would on the outer surface of a ball, were it the motion of the earth that caused it. It could not, therefore, affect the fact of the Cellular Cosmogony in the least.</p>  
 <p>According to the Koreshan System, the earth is comparatively stationary, and the heavens are moving within the stationary earth. The sun is moving at the rate of about eighteen thousand miles in twenty-four hours. It is sweeping through space with this velocity and radiating its "energies" into the environing shell, in which there is a corresponding magnetic spiral motion.</p>  
 <p>To this spiral motion of "energy" is due the rotation of the pendulum, and not to the motion of the earth. First, it will be understood that the pendulum is suspended from a support attached solidly to the body of the earth. Second, it will be noticed that the curve of the earth is practically the same at both extremes of the oscillation, the earth moving just as</p>  
 <p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 202</font></a></p>  
 <p>rapidly at one point as at the other. There could not be a calculable commensuration of difference either in time or space, at the two extremities, as to curvation or the time of longitudinal motion.</p>  
 <p>If the pendulum be swung from north to south and south to north, at the start, it would be subject to the eastward motion of the earth, which, were the theory of the earth's rotate impression in relation to the pendulum ball true, the ball would apparently move toward the west, and with the opposite swing of the pendulum it would swing equally toward the west--the motion on one side balancing the other. This would be the effect if the phenomenon were the result of the earth's motion.</p>  
 <p>How would it be when the pendulum rotated around to the east and west points? The earth would be rotating toward the east, the pendulum swinging east and west. The earth is moving, according to the Copernican hypothesis, at the rate of sixteen miles a minute either with or against the ball, while it swings westward, and at the same rate with it when the ball swings eastward.</p>  
 <p>If the earth by its rotation affects the motion of the pendulum enough to cause this rotation, why would is not make an appreciable difference distinctively marked, while swinging east and west?</p>  
 <p>The swinging of a pendulum could bear no possible relation to the earth's rotation, even if the earth were a ball rotating from east to west at the rate of twenty-five thousand miles in twenty-four hours. The question of the relation of the rotating pendulum of Foucault to the rotation of the earth is equal to the question: "If it takes a thousand bundles of shingles</p>  
 <p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 203</font></a></p>  
 <p>to shingle an opera house, how many pancakes will it take to shingle a meeting house?"</p>  
 <p>The marvelous thing about this experiment, is that any man possessing any claim whatsoever to the title of scientific should accept this solution without asking the question, "May there not be some hypothesis for this motion as reasonable as, or more so than, the hypothesis of the rotation of the earth?"</p>  
 <p>If a pendulum were swung at the north pole, oscillating laterally over the plane of the earth's rotation, were there such a motion of the earth, the pendulum hung in space (not upon supports fixed solidly in the earth), there would be some sense to the proposition; as it is, it is the veriest nonsense, and later the "scientists" will laugh at their own folly.</p>
