 <p>The Fourth Book of the Classic of Mountains and Seas, entitled "The Classic of the Eastern Mountains," is divided into four sectionsother than that each pertains to the "Eastern Mountains" no one of the four sections is related to any one of the others.</p>  
 <p>The first section of the Fourth Book, identified a range of mountains approximately 1200 miles in extent, running due north and south. Twelve peaks have been named, each having a river flowing in an easterly directionnortheast, east or southeast. The second section climbed over mountainous territory for 2200 miles, also due north and south. The third section took a water course, due north and south for approximately 2000 miles. The fourth section was short, starting at the "North Sea" and travelling south and east.</p>  
 <p>There may be some indication in the untranslated portions that I do not have, that told how the Chinese got across the Eastern Sea to the Eastern Mountains. Since it is not available, to decide independently how they got there, would only be pulling a conclusion out of thin air. Therefore, with no apology, we shall jump across and only try to solve the geographical problems that we actually have.</p>  
 <p>The first identification of a mountain range that was described in the Classics, Book Four, Section 1, appeared that it might be the Cascades or Sierras, since they were coastal and fulfilled the requirement in that they ran north and south for more than 1200 miles. All rivers on the coastal range, however, emptied into the Pacificto the west. The Cascades and Sierras, therefore, had to be eliminatedthe rivers ran in the wrong direction. The Andes were then considered as a possibility, as that great range, extending north and south, had all major rivers flowing easterly to the Atlantic. The eastern slope of the Andes is one tremendous rain-forest. One of the items in the Classics stated that the recorder travelled for a time over shifting sandthere was no shifting sand on the eastern slope of the Andean</p>  
 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></a></p>  
 <p>range; that range was then eliminated. The only remaining range of great extent would be the Rockies. There, rivers did flow in an easterly directioninto the Mississippi basin.</p>  
 <p>The opening sentence of the section started out by saying that "Suh-Chu Mountain" on its northern side adjoined the "Sunless Mountain" and that drinkable water was found in a river flowing northeasterly. I chased up and down a dozen or more times on my map, from Canada to Mexico, and each time examined every peak without even a flicker of a clue. Being unable to locate "Suh-Chu Mountain" or the good drinking water, I finally passed it over. The second peak had to be passed over for the same reason. The third one "rang a bell." The Chinese had named it "Aspen Mountain." "Aspen," to me, meant only one thingEstes Park, Colorado. Taking a chance that the third peak was somewhere in Colorado, I pinpointed it there. From that point, I worked both forward and backward. Going backward to peak number one, "Suh-Chu Mountain," I found myself looking at Sweetwater River, in Wyoming, flowing northeastgood drinking water. Working my way down the map, the shifting sand, the sand that had eliminated the Andean range, was found precisely on the spot where the Chinese had placed itand today, we have commemorated that spot, unknowingly insofar as the Chinese were concerned, with our Great Sand Dunes National Monument. From then on, peak after peak tallied. It seemed unbelievable at firstbut it worked. If the first one worked, the others would have to do so.</p>  
 <p>In a few spots, winding through Tennessee Pass, Berthoud Pass, Rabbit's Ear Pass or Fall River Pass, mileage is about twenty miles short. But, in 1200 miles, a few minor errors of 4000 years ago can be forgiven, particularly if one knows that frightfully rugged terrain.</p>  
 <p>When one considers the difficulties and dangers of conquering one mountain peak and then can form a mental picture of himself trekking down 2200 miles over 17 peaks, on the very crest of the Continental Divide, from Manitoba to Mazatlan, some small appreciation of the seemingly <a href="errata.htm#40">insurmountable</a> task will be understood. We can do no more than to stand with</p>  
 <p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></a></p>  
 <p>bowed heads before the intrepid Chinese who mapped those jagged snow-capped peaks over 4000 years ago.</p>  
 <p>That their record has survived until today is, likewise, one of those peculiar turns of fate that make the reality of it stranger than fiction.</p>  
 <p> </p>  <h4 align="center">THE CLASSIC OF MOUNTAINS AND SEAS <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a></h4>  <h5 align="center"><i>Fourth Book</i></h5>  <h6 align="center">THE CLASSIC OF THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS</h6>  
 <p>1. The beginning of the "Classic of the Eastern Mountains" says that SUH-CHU Mountain on its northern side adjoins KAN-MEI Mountain (or Sunless Mountain). SHIH River (or "drinkable water") is found here, a stream that flows northeasterly into the sea. In it there are many water animals called YUNG-YUNG. These look like brindled cattle [i.e., they resemble cattle that are striped like tigers.] . Their voices sound like the grunting of swine.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: A peak (5930 ft.) twenty miles due west of Casper, Wyoming, appears to be SUH-CHU Mountain. On its northern side, it adjoins the Big Horn Range. SHIH River (or drinkable water) is the Sweetwater River which here joins the North Platte and flows northeasterly, eventually into the Mississippi and the sea. The animals, which in color are like brindled cattle, are probably beaver or otter.</small></div>  
 <p>2. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, LEI Mountain (or the Mountain of Creeping Plants) is to be found. Upon this there are gems and below it there is gold. Hu River is found here, stream that flows easterly into SHIN River. In this there are many HWOH-SHI. [These are tadpoles; the book entitled the RH-YA calls them HWOH-TUNG.]</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Three hundred LI is approximately equivalent to</small></div>

 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>one hundred milesa Chinese LI is just a fraction under one-third of a statute mile. One hundred miles due south, Medicine Bow Peak (12005 feet) is found. Gold and semi-precious gems are plentiful in the area. The Hu River is a small tributary flowing down the eastern slope of Medicine Bow Peak emptying into the Laramie which flows easterly into the North Platte.</small></div>  
 <p>3. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, KEU-CHWANG Mountain (or Aspen Mountain) is to be found. Upon this there are many gems and much gold, and below it many green jade stones. Wild animals are found there which look like dogs with six legs. These are called TSUNG-TSUNG, the name being given them in imitation of their cry. Birds are also found there which look like domestic fowls, but which have hair like a rat. These are called TSZ rats. When they are seen, the country is subject to great draught. The CHI River is found here, a stream flowing northerly into Hu River. In this there are many lancet-fish. These are of a dark color, spotted (or striped) with blue, and have a bill like a lancet. [These were originally found in the Eastern Sea, and they are now found in the KIANG-TUNG River also.] Those who eat them are not subject to epidemic diseases.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: One hundred miles south, "Aspen Mountain" probably is Long's Peak, Colorado. Mile after mile of the most spectacular golden-leafed Aspen trees stretch clear across Coloradotruly an unforgettable sight, even to the Chinese. Gold, as is well known, abounds in this area from Steamboat Springs to Cripple Creek. The CHI River is a fork of the Laramie which flows north. The two rivers, one from Medicine Bow and the other from Long's Peak, joinas the Chinese noted. Identification of the fish, rainbow or speckled trout or any other, will be left to the fishermen of Colorado. The birds with hair like a rat, may be bats.</small></div>  
 <p>4. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, PUH-TSAN Mountain is found. It has no grass or trees, and no water.</p>  
 <p>Note: Of four or five major peaks approximately 100 miles</p>  
 <p>south, Gray's Peak appears to be the one noted by the Chinese.</p>  
 <p>5. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, FAN-TIAO Mountain (or the Foreign Range) is to be found. It</p>  
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></a></p>  
 <p>has no grass or trees, but has much sand. The KIEN River (Diminishing River) is found here, a stream flowing northerly into the sea. In this there are many KAN fish. (The KAN fish is described as a fish three feet long, that is found in the YANG-TSZ River, having a large mouth and yellowish gills, and a greenish back.) [One authority names these "the yellow-jawed fish."]</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Mount Princeton, 100 miles south, immediately north of Monarch Pass, is probably the high peak, with the Sangre de Cristo Range, which starts there, being the "foreign range" mentioned in the record. The Chinese state that they found much sand. Along the western side of the crest of the Sangre de Cristo Range, stretches mile after mile of sandculminating in our Great Sand Dunes National Monument. Sand there is. The "Diminishing River" is a tributary of the Arkansas.</small></div>  
 <p>6. And it says that four hundred LI to the south, KU-MAO Mountain (or the Mountain of the Maiden) is found. Upon this there are many lacquer-trees, and below it many mulberry trees, and silk-worm oaks. KU-MAO River is found here, a stream flowing northerly into the sea, in which there are many KAN fish.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Blanca, the "White Maiden," Spanish name for the Chinese identification of the "Mountain of the Maiden," stands 130 miles due south. The Huerfano, a tributary of the Arkansas, flows northerly from Blanca Peak to joint the Arkansas.</small></div>  
 <p>7. And it says that, four hundred LI to the south, KAO-SHI Mountain is to be found. Upon this there are many gems and below it many sharp stones. [From these they are able to make smooth lancets to cure boils and swellings.] CHU-SHING River is found here, a stream flowing easterly into a marsh, and in it there are many gems and much gold.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: North Truches Peak, highest point in New Mexico, appears to be the peak identified in the Classics. There are two streams flowing easterly from the peak that appear to be surrounded with marsh, both are shown interrupted. Semi-precious stones of many kinds are found in the territoryturquoise is there in abundance, as is rock-crystal and jadeite.</small></div>  
 <p>8. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, YOH (Lofty) Mountain is found. Upon this there are many mulberry-trees, and below it many <a href="errata.htm#41">ailanthus</a>-trees. LOH River is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></a></p>  
 <p>found here, a stream flowing easterly into a marsh, and in it there are many gems and much gold.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: The "Lofty" mountain is Manzano Peak, high point in the range of the same name. The stream flowing into a marsh was not identifiable on my map. There may be one that is not large enough to be shownor the possibility exists that one may have dried up in the intervening 4,000 years. Climatic conditions, according to scientists, apparently changed in this specific area within the past 700-800 years, since many Indian sites, of an early age, show an exodus from here about 1200-1300 A.D., presumably caused by <a href="errata.htm#42">drought</a> or some climatic change.</small></div>  
 <p>9. And it says that three hundred LI to the south, Wolf Mountain is to be found. Upon this there is no grass and there are no trees, and below it there is much water (or there are many streams), in which there are many KAN-TSZ fish. [These are not fully described.] They have wild animals, which look like the (quadrumana, called) KWA-FU, but they have hair like that of swine, and their voice is like an expiration of the breath.</p>  
 <p>When these are seen, then heaven sends down great rains.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: 95 miles south of Manzano is Sierra Blanca, with many noisy streams chasing down its slopestwo main tributaries flow into the Rio Hondo. The wild animals that look like swine and are the size of monkey, I am not able to identifythey may be small peccary.</small></div>  
 <p>10. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, Lone Mountain is found. Upon this there are many gems and much gold, and below it many beautiful stones. MOH-TU (Muddy) River is found here, a stream flowing southeasterly into a mighty flood, in which there are many TIAO-YUNG. These look like yellow serpents with fishes fins. They go out and in. They are bright (or smooth). When these are seen, then the region is subject to great draught.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: South from Sierra Blanca is Guadalupe, or "Lone" peak, highest point in Texas. Flowing southeast from the peak is Delaware Creek, emptying into the Pecos, which on occasion, floods. Again, there are many semi-precious stones, as well as gold, in the mountains. Guadalupe, identified as "Lone" peak, is the only one of considerable height in the area. Travellers,</small></div>  
 <p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>who had just come over the rugged terrain where towering peaks surrounded them at every turn, would spot this "lone" peak quickly.</small></div>  
 <p>11. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, TAI (Bald) Mountain is found. [Then the mountain was called the Eastern YOH or TAI-TSUNG, which is now called TAI Mountain. It is in the northwestern part of FUNG-KAO District, and the distance from the foot of the mountain to its summit is forty-eight LI and three hundred paces.] Upon this there are many gems, and below it there is much gold. Wild animals are found here which look like sucking pigs, but they have pearls. They are called TUNG-TUNG, their name being given in imitation of their cry. The HWAN River is found here, a stream flowing easterly into a river (or into the river. i.e. The YANG-TSZ River). [One authority says that it flows into the sea.] In this there are many water-gems (quartz crystals).</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Exactly 100 miles south, in the Davis Range, stands Bald Peakand called "Bald Mountain" by the Chinese, an unusually pointed coincidence. The animals with pearls, are undoubtedly small peccary with tusks. The stream that flows easterly into a river, is the Coyanosa Draw, which flows east into the Pecos. Quartz of countless varieties is present.</small></div>  
 <p>12. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, Bamboo Mountain is found, bordering on a river (or <i>the</i> river). [One authority says that it is on the shoreor that it is at the boundary line.] There is no grass or trees, but there are many green-jasper and green-jade stones. The Km River (or water impeded in its course by rocks) is found here, a stream flowing southeasterly into TSU-TAN River (or a body of water). In this (country) there is a great abundance of dye-plants!</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: This last peak named could be either Emory Peak or Chinati Peak, both on the Rio Grande. Although Emory Peak is 100 miles south and Chinati only 85 miles, it is believed that, of the two, Chinati fits the description. Not too far away, the river is impeded in its coursenear the little town of Ruidoso (noisy)and the Rio Grande flows southeast, while it bends around Emory Peak. The ancient Chinese scholar who examined this account added that from the description it appeared</small></div>  
 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 116</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>that the river formed a boundary lineand so it does. The large body of water, recorded by the Chinese, is the Gulf of Mexico into which the Rio Grande empties.</small></div>  
 <p>13. The first section of the "Classic of the Eastern Mountains" thus gives the entire distance along the twelve mountains, from SUH-CHU Mountain to Bamboo Mountain, as three thousand six hundred LI. Their gods all have human bodies and dragon's heads. When they are offered a sacrifice of animals having hair, a dog is used. In other sacrifices the blood of a fish is used to besmear the things offered. [To use blood in besmearing the things offered in sacrifice is called "NI." KUNG-YANG'S "Chronicles" say that in offering sacrifices of creatures having flesh and blood, to the god of the land, and of grain, they besmear with blood the being that is sacrificed. The name of this species of sacrifice is pronounced "NI."]</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: The Chinese computation of 1200 miles figures approximately 100 miles more, as the crow flies, than my map indicates. However, that distance is compensated for in the area from Medicine Bow Peak to Blanca Peak, where the circuitous route threads through half a dozen insurmountably high mountain passes. In measuring distance by stepping off paces, the Chinese would inevitably have had to have travelled a greater distance on foot than a pair of dividers measures that distance on a flat paper map. On level stretches, the tabulation is within a mile or two of being accuratea most astounding feat for anyone at any time in that country. The general path has followed longitude 106° W., with comparatively little variation, from latitude 43° N. to 30° N.</small></div>  <h5 align="center">Second Section</h5>  
 <p>1. The beginning of the second section of the "Eastern Classic" says that KUNG-SANG Mountain (or the Mountain of the Empty Mulberry-Trees) on the northern side adjoins the SHIN River. [This mountain rises from the KIN-SEH Forestsee the book called "CHEU-LI."] On the eastern side (it adjoins the states of) Tsu and Wu; on the southern side a number of sandy mounds, and on the western side the MIN (or Muddy) Marsh. Here there are wild animals which look</p>

 <p>like cattle, but which are striped like tigers. Their voices resemble the sound of a person stretching and yawning. [Perhaps rather the sound of one moaning.] These are named LING-LING, and this name is an imitation of their cry. When these are seen, then heaven sends down great rains.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: This second journey has its start in Canada, on the western side of Lake Winnipegosis, Manitoba. The peak is Hart Mountain, the highest peak in the region, on the northern side of which flows the Bell River into Dawson Bay. The "MIN" or Muddy Marsh on the west, is well describedthe marsh area due west of Lake Winnipegosis extends for hundreds of miles. This is the lichen-rich tundra area in which caribou feed.</small></div>  
 <p>2. And it says that, six hundred LI to the south, TSAO-CHI Mountain is found. Below this there are many paper-mulberry trees, but there is no water (or river). There are many birds and wild animals.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: 600 Chinese miles, or 200 statute miles, there is a high peak in Moose Mountain Provincial Park, Saskatchewan, from which no river flows. Main breeding ground in North America for migratory birds and water-fowl, this specific territory is one of the largest known. The Canadian government is spending millions of dollars in conservation programs to provide protection for their wild life right on this very spot. Deer, elk, moose, bear, as well as wolves, have roamed over this vast wasteland since time immemorial. The Chinese found the most characteristic feature of the country to be the abundance of birds and wild animals.</small></div>  
 <p>3. And it says that, four hundred LI to the southwest, YIH-KAO Mountain is found. Upon this there are many gems and much gold, and below it there is much white plaster-rock. The YIH-KAO River is found here, a stream flowing easterly to the KIH-NU River. In this there are many clams with pearly shells. [These are clams or mussels with pearly shells, as beautiful as gems, these pearly shells belonging to a species of mussel called SHAN-PAN.]</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: 140 miles, or a fraction over 400 LI, to the southwest, a peak rises near Sioux Pass, Montana, just above the junction of the Yellowstone with the Missouri. The Missouri flows easterly</small></div>  
 <p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 120</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>to meet the Yellowstone which comes in from the south. And, interestingly enough, the Musselshell River converges with the Missouri immediately above this pointthe Chinese said they found mussels with pearly shells! The region through which the Chinese traveled south from Moose Mountain Provincial Park, would take them through an extensive area of "white plaster-rock" and perhaps even passing the small town of White Earth, North Dakota, which would have been in direct line with their course.  
 </small><p>It may well be that the most incredible coincidence of all will be found to be located right here. In this precise area, due north of Grenora, in the northwest corner of North Dakota, stands a large boulder on which is inscribed undecipherable carvings said to predate the earliest known tribesmen. This boulder falls within the immediate path of one travelling from Moose Mountain Provincial Park to the confluence of the Yellowstone with the Missouri. The probability seems undeniably strong that this marker was carved and left there by those first world map-makers sent out by Yu.</p>  
 <p>A second series of inscribed rocks of the same nature, is located in the southeast corner of Alberta, Canada, ten miles over the border. The Canadian Government has created Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park around the area. These obelisks are also covered with undecipherable hieroglyphics. It is my belief that if study were made of both stone carvings, that in Alberta and that in North Dakota, it might be found to be that the hieroglyphics were an archaic form of Chinesesuch, for example, as were found inscribed on the bones dug up in China, described earlier. The stone in Alberta would lie in a probably path of those coming south, preceding Section One, where our first identification started at the Sweetwater Riverthe beginning of the section being lost.</p>  
 <p>The carvings are undecipherablethey are known to be ancient. They lie in what I believe to be the path of the early Chinese, as indicated on the second map. If the inscriptions, after study, are found to be archaic Chinese, we will then have the necessary "bones," located on the spot, which archeologists must have, as well as the documentary proof.</p>  
 <p>They spoke also of gold and gems. Unusually fine agate is found in the area and gold in quantity, as is well known.</p></div>  
 <p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 121</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. And thence going to the south, five hundred LI by water, and three hundred LI over shifting sands, one end of the KOH (or Bean) Mountain is reached. There is no grass and there are no trees here, but there are many smooth whetstones.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Travelling south by water for 166 miles, as directed, the Chinese would have taken the Yellowstone River, which joins the Missouri at that point. 166 miles south on the Yellowstone would have brought them between the present towns of Miles City and Big Horn, in Montana. Thence 100 miles "over shifting sands," the travelers would arrive at the northern end of the Big Horn Mountains and the peak would be either Hunt Mountain or the adjacent peak near Wolf. This area is desolate as we knowit passes close by the Custer Battlefield National Monument.</small></div>  
 <p>5. And it says that, three hundred and eighty LI to the south, the other end of Bean Mountain is found. There is no grass and there are no trees here. The LI River is found here, a stream flowing easterly into the Yu Marsh. In it there are many CHU-PIEH fish (or water animals). These look like lungs, but have eyes and six feet, and they have pearls. They taste sour, but pleasant, and are eaten without producing sickness. [They do not cause diseases at any time. LU-SHI'S edition of the book of Confucius, called "Spring and Autumn," says that the LI River contains fish called CHU-PIEH, which have six feet, and which are beautiful as the "vermilion" fish.]</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: 125 miles south, or 380 LI, there is a peak at the southern end of the Big Horn Range, which bears no name on my map, a short distance from Casper, Wyoming and about 25 miles due west from Teapot Dome. From the peak, a stream flows easterly into a marshy area. The water animals that look like lungs and have six feet, may be some crab or crustacean having six feet that is small and lung-shaped.</small></div>  
 <p>6. And it says that, three hundred and eighty LI to the south, YU-NGO Mountain (or an excessively high peak) is found. Upon this there are many japonica-trees and JAN-trees, and below it there is much prickly succory. The TSAH-YU River is found here, a stream flowing easterly into the Yellow River. Here there are wild beasts which look like rabbits, but which</p>  
 <p><a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="green">p. 122</font></a></p>  
 <p>have a crow's bill, an owl's eyes, and a serpent's tail. When they see a man, they pretend to sleep. They are called CHIU-YU, this sound being an imitation of their cry. When these are seen, grasshoppers or locusts cause great destruction. [Grasshoppers are a species of locusts. It says that they ruin the herbage. Their name is pronounced CHUNG.]</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Precisely 125 miles to the south, Medicine Bow Peak towers 12,000 feet above the landscapethe excessively high peak noted by the Chinese. Three or four tributaries of the Laramie flow east from the peak into the main river. Description of the opossum could not have been better done. Locusts are commonand do destroy the herbage as the Chinese so fittingly stated.</small></div>  
 <p>7. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, TU-FU Mountain is found. There is no grass and there are no trees here, but there is much water (or there are many streams).</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: 100 miles south, would bring the travellers into Estes Park. Longs Peak, 85 miles south from Medicine Bow, is no doubt the one although there are many peaks in this vicinity. The 15 mile variation may be accountable to the difficulty in negotiating the high mountain passes between the two peaks over which the Chinese would have had to travel. Five or six major rivers have their source on Longs Peak or close by.</small></div>  
 <p>8. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, KANG Mountain is found. There is no grass and there are no trees here, but there is much water, and there are many green-jade stones (or there are many water-jade stones). [These are a species of water-gemsi.e., rock crystals.] There are many great serpents, and there are also wild beasts which look like foxes, but which have fish's fins. These are named CHU-JU, and derive their name from their cry. When these are seen, the country has reason to fear disasters.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Mount Harvard or Mount Princeton would fit the description as both are approximately the distance south. Branches of the Arkansas, Rio Grande and Colorado, with countless tributaries, rise within a twenty mile radius of either peakthere is much water. Rock crystal, jadeite and turquoise are found in the region. The animal that looks like a fox with</small></div>  
 <p><a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 123</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>fish's fins is not identifiedunless it might be the flying squirrel which is in the area or some <a href="errata.htm#43">species</a> of lizard.</small></div>  
 <p>9. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, LU-KI Mountain is found. There is no vegetation, and there are no trees, but there are many stones and much sand. The Sand River is found here, a stream flowing southerly into the CHAN River (or into a limpid river). In this there are many LI pelicans; these look like ducks, but have men's legs. They derive their name from their cry. When these are seen, then the country will see great literary achievements. [These pelicans have long legs, which somewhat resemble human shanks.]</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: 100 miles south, we come to Summit Peak, from which one branch of the Rio Grande flows south. The Chinese report "much sand." Today, our Great Sand Dunes National Monument has been located in this very areathere is much sand. The particular species of duck is not identified.</small></div>  
 <p>10. And it says that, three hundred and eighty LI to the south, KU-SHE Mountain is found. There is no grass and there are no trees there, but there is much water (or there are many streams).</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: 125 miles south, would bring the travellers to the vicinity of Santa Fe, New Mexico, where there are half a dozen peaks within a fifteen mile radius, any one of which would fit the descriptionChicoma Peak (11950), Redondo Peak (11252), N. Truches Peak (13306), Baldy Peak (12623), Rincon Peak (11500), or Thompson Peak (10546). The region is extremely barren. Four main branches of the Rio Grande have their source herethere are many streams.</small></div>  
 <p>11. And it says that, going to the south, three hundred LI by water, and one hundred LI over shifting sand, the northern KU-SHE Mountain is found. There is no grass and there are no trees there, but there are many stones.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: South from Santa Fe, by water, the Chinese would have gone by way of the Rio Grande to a point opposite Ladrones Peak and then over shifting sand for 30 more miles to South Baldy at the north end of the Black Range. The area is devoid of grass, as stated. It is a curious thing that both the Yellowstone River and the Rio Grande provide a water route due south. There is no other place in our country where this</small></div>  
 <p><a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 124</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>could be so in mountainous regions or where detailed physical characteristics show such marked similarity as they do in these two interior water journeys. It could hardly be coincidental.</small></div>  
 <p>12. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, Southern KU-SHE Mountain is found. There is no grass and there are no trees there, but there is much water (or there are many streams there).</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Exactly 100 miles due south, at the southern end of the Black Range, stands Cook's Peak. There is no grass and there are no trees but neither did I find an over abundance of waterthis is sandy desert, although small tributaries of the Rio Grande are in the section, there are no large streams. This is just the other side of the river from the White Sands National Monument.</small></div>  
 <p>13. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, Green-jade-stone Mountain is found. There is no grass here but there are many trees. Many great serpents are found here, and there are also many green-jade stones and quartz crystals.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: This appears to be either Animas Peak or Big Hatchet Peak, both approximately 100 miles south, and both in desert areas. A great deal of turquoise and jadeite comes from this territory as does quartz of many varieties.</small></div>  
 <p>14. And it says that, five hundred LI to the south, WEI-SHI Mountain is found. There is no grass and there are no trees here, but there are many gems and much gold. YUEN River is found here, a stream flowing easterly into a sand marsh (or into a sandy marsh). [One authority states that the name of the mountain is pronounced KIAH-SHI instead of WEI-SHI.]</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Directly south, 166 miles, there is a peak (8304 ft.), near Madera, State of Chihuahua, Mexico. This was the only place where my map has failed to indicate a major river as specifiedthe area is sandy and marshy and filled with small lakes, and in that, it is correct. It may be that in the intervening 4000 years, the river has drained into the marsh or just disappeared. Gold and gems are in the entire region.</small></div>  
 <p>15. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, KU-FUNG Mountain is found. There is no grass, and there are no trees here, but there are many gems and much gold. Wild beasts are found here which look like foxes, but which have wings (or</p>  
 <p><a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="green">p. 125</font></a></p>  
 <p>fins). Their voice sounds like that of a wild goose, and they are called PI-PI. When these are seen, then heaven sends down great draught.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: 100 miles south, there is a peak (8671 ft.) about seven miles from the small town of Pamachic, State of Chihuahua, in which area mining has been carried on for years. The "wild beast" is not known. Again, this may be some kind of lizard.</small></div>  
 <p>16. And it says that, five hundred LI to the south, FU-LI Mountain is found. Upon this there are many gems and much gold, and, below it, many lancet-stones. They have wild beasts which look like foxes, but which have nine tails and nine heads, and tiger's claws. They are called LUNG-CHIH. Their voice is like that of an infant child, and they eat men.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Here is where we find the nine-headed, nine-tailed foxes! Five hundred LI, or 166 miles, there are two peaks to the south that fit the description, due north by northeast of the city of Culiacan State of Sinaloa, one on the State border and the other just within the State of Durango.</small></div>  
 <p>17. And it says that, five hundred LI to the south, YIN Mountain is found. To the south, the YIN River is to be seen, and to the north the Hu Marsh (or lakes and marshes). Here they have wild beasts which look like horses, but they have sheep's eyes, four horns and cattle tails. Their voice is like the howl of a dog, and they are called YIU-YIU. When these are seen, the country will be visited by many crafty foreigners. They have birds which look like ducks, but they have rat's tails, and can climb trees. They are called CHIE-KEU. When these are seen, the country will have much sickness.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: South, exactly 166 miles, is the peak Triangulo (7832 ft.) about 75 miles due east of the city of Mazatlan, and a little to the north. To the south of Triangulo flows the Presidio River and to the north, is a considerable lake and marsh area in central Durango, as well as a swampy region all along the coast to the north.</small></div>  
 <p>18. The second section of the "Classic of the Eastern Mountains" thus gives the entire distance along the seventeen mountains, from KUNG-SANG Mountain to YIN Mountain, as six</p>  
 <p><a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="green">p. 126</font></a></p>  
 <p>thousand six hundred and forty LI. Their gods all have wild beast's bodies, but human faces. They bear the KOH fish. [With a species of stag's or deer's horns they catch the KOH fishes.] When they are offered a sacrifice of living beings having hair or feathers, a fowl is used. When the people pray to them for offspring, they retire to a screened place.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: According to the Classics, the distance along the seventeen mountains is 2214 miles. The distance shown by these notes is 30° of latitude, or roughly 2100 miles due south, 1¼°, or 85 miles, where between Moose Mountain Provincial Park and Sioux Peak, there was a turn from south to southwest, and the Yellowstone River flowed southwest for a part of its course. A further variation came at Long's Peak down to Summit Peak where I lost about 25 miles. With these two compensations, that would add 110 miles to the 2100, this computation arrives at a distance counted as 2210 miles. After turning from southwest and the Yellowstone River, the Chinese have followed longitude 106° W. for practically the entire distance down to Mazatlan. The rich minerals that the Chinese noted from North Dakota to central Mexico, needs no explanation heregold is in the hills. The same is true of gems, jade-stones and quartz. This entire territory is one of our richest in turquoise, jadeite, quartz, jasper, in yellow, green and blue, opals from Mexico and tourmaline, to name a few. The country over which the Chinese travelled, is the most formidable that we have on the North American continent, encompassed with difficulties at every turn. In no one place has there been mention of any hardship or strugglemeticulous notes, nothing more.</small></div>  <h5 align="center">Third Section</h5>  
 <p>1. The beginning of the third section of the "Eastern Classic" says that, SHI-HU Mountain on the north adjoins SIANG Mountain. Upon it there are many gems and much gold, and below it there are many thorny plants. Here there are wild beasts which look like elks, but which have fish eyes, and they are called WAN-HU (or YUEN-HU), deriving their name from their cry.</p>

 <p><a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="green">p. 129</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Section three starts at Mt. Fairweather in southern Alaska. On its north are the St. Elias MountainsMt. Hubbard, Mt. St. Elias and Mt. Logan. It lies just at the tip of Yukon Territory where "much gold" has been found. The animals may be moose, elk or reindeer.</small></div>  
 <p>2. And it says that going to the south by water for eight hundred LI, KI Mountain is found (or a mountain with two peaks). Upon this there are many peach-trees and plum-trees. There are also many wild beasts and many tigers.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: This is the only one of the journeys in the series that covers the distance by a water route.  
 </small><p>Travelling from Mt. Fairweather, eight hundred LI, or roughly 266 miles, south, the twin peaks of Mt. Burkett and Kates Needle stand, separated by a glacier, immediately north of Wrangell. This portion of the Alaskan coast is warmed by the waters of the Kamchatka Current so that in spite of its northern latitude, fruit trees grow there in a tempered climate, today. Scientists believe that in the early periods of the Christian era, or before 900 A.D., climatic conditions in the polar regions were far different from what they are now. They were temperate, or even warm. We know that to be true of the north Atlantic at the time of the crossing of the Norsemen. As glaciers recede in Greenland, villages are being uncovered. Rachel Carson speaks of it in her <a href="errata.htm#44">magnificent</a> book "The Sea Around Us."</p></div>  
 <p>3. And it says that, going to the south by water for five hundred LI, CHU-KEU Mountain is found. There are no trees or grass here, but there are many stones, and much sand. The distance around the mountain is one hundred LI. There are many MEI (or sleeping fish) here. [These MEI fish are of excellent flavor.]</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: South, 166 miles, is a peak (9140 ft.) due east of Prince Rupert, in British Columbia, Canada, that measures the correct distance. My map gives no name for it. The stretch of coast here is bleak.</small></div>  
 <p>4. And it says that, going south by water for seven hundred LI, Middle FU Mountain is found. Here there are no trees or grass, but there is much sand.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Towering Mt. Waddington (13,260 ft.), 233 miles</small></div>  
 <p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="green">p. 130</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>south, stands snow-capped just inside Queen Charlotte Strait.</small></div>  
 <p>5. And it says that, going to the east by water for one thousand LI, HU-SHE Mountain is found. Here there are no trees or grass, but there are many stones and much sand.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: This is the only point where directions turn "east" from the normal "south," and, due to the change, it furnished the clue to locating the third section. The turn east for a distance of 330 miles follows Vancouver Island, the one spot on the northwest coast that one can go 330 miles east by water. The mountain at the other end of the 330 miles, is Mt. Olympus, on the tip of Cape Flattery, dominating the scene around Seattle.</small></div>  
 <p>6. And it says that, going to the south by water for seven hundred LI, MANG-TSZ (the Eldest Child) Mountain is found. Here there are many trees; japonicas and TONG trees, and also many peach-trees and plum-trees. In the grass there are many mushroom-rushes (or mushrooms and rushes, or KIUN rushes). [These are not fully described. They are called KWUN.] They have wild beasts, and many elks and deers. The distance around the mountain is one hundred LI. Upon it there is a flowing stream called PIH-YANG (or the river of Clear Jade-stone). In this there are many sturgeons and mud-sturgeons. [These mud-sturgeons are a species of eel. They resemble sturgeons, but have a long body like an eel. One authority says that they are a species of herring.]</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: South, again by water for 233 miles, is Mt. Hood. The Chinese evidently went a short distance up the Columbia River to get a better view of one of our most beautiful peaksthey note a great many fruit trees, trees, mushrooms and rushes. The area as we know it is one of great fertility, centering around the rose-bowered city of Portland. Trees would be there in greatest profusiongiant firs of every variety. Mt. Hood is probably thirty miles around its base as the travellers say. The river is the Columbia in which there are many fish and those that the translator thought might be some kind of sturgeon are, as we know, salmon, for which the Columbia is famous. Large animals, likewise, are in the area in abundance.</small></div>  
 <p>7. And going south by water for five hundred LI, and over shifting sand for five hundred LI, a mountain is reached which</p>  
 <p><a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="green">p. 131</font></a></p>  
 <p>is called KI-CHUNG Mountain, the distance around which is two hundred LI. There is no grass and there are no trees here, but there are great serpents, and upon the mountain there are many precious stones. It has a body of water, the distance around which is forty LI, all bubbling up and running off. [Now, to the east of the Yellow River is the FAN River, and in the YIN (Dark) District it has the FUN River's Spring (or source). In this place the water rushes out, overflowing, bubbling up, and running rapidly. It is deep and can not be restrained. This is of the same class as the water above referred to.] This is called SHAN-TSEH (or the Deep Marsh). In it there are great tortoises. [They have beaks like the common tortoise, the tortoise being a great turtle; the shell has variegated marks, like those of the precious tortoise-shell, but it is thinner.] Here there are fish (or water animals) which look like carp, which have six feet and a bird's tail. These are called KOH-KOH fish, deriving this name from an imitation of their cry.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Travelling south for 166 miles by water and thence over shifting sand for another 166 miles, the Chinese came to Mt. Shasta. From the mouth of the Columbia to Winchester Bay, in Oregon, is exactly 160 miles and, overland from Winchester Bay to Mt. Shasta, is about 170 miles. The distance around the base of Mt. Shasta, one of our greatest peaks, is probably close to the sixty mile estimate of the pedestrian Chinese. In the area that they covered on foot, "over shifting sand," they evidently took a side excursion to see the sights at Klamath Falls, passing Upper Klamath Lake. The Falls have been described as a place where the water "rushes out, overflowing, bubbling up and running rapidly." "It is deep and cannot be restrained." How true. Upper Klamath Lake is the body of water, the distance around which was said to be about twelve miles although today the distance around the lake is considerably greater. Spectacular Klamath Falls and Mt. Shasta are two of our "show places"they impressed the Chinese tourists.</small></div>  
 <p>8. And it says that, going to the south by water for eight hundred LI, MEI-YU Mountain [or MIN-TSZ] Mountain is reached. Upon this there are many trees and much grass, and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></a></p>  
 <p>an abundance of gold and gems, and also much ocher. Here there are wild beasts which look like little cattle, but which have horse's tails, and which are called TSING-TSING, deriving their name from an imitation of their cry.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: After leaving Mt. Shasta, and going due west to the coast, coming out just to the south of Klamath, California, 266 miles south would have brought the Chinese to Los Gatos Peak, on the south side of San Francisco Bay. The "abundance of gold" was amply proved by the 49ers during the "Gold Rush." The "wild beasts which look like little cattle," are most probably the small seals in San Francisco Bay, which, in color, are like cattle.</small></div>  
 <p>9. And going to the south by water for five hundred LI, and over shifting sand for three hundred LI, WU-KAO (or Not Lofty) Mountain is reached. Here the YIU (Young) Sea may be seen. [This is now called the "Little Sea."] To the east the FU-tree may be seen [or FU-SANG] . There is no grass and there are no trees here, and much wind is found upon the mountain. The distance around it is a hundred LI.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: South by water for 166 miles and then overland for 100 miles, the Chinese travelled from San Francisco Bay by water to Morro Bay, 166 miles, and thence overland to the peak directly in back of Santa Barbara, for 100 miles. They stood on the peak, facing south, and saw Santa Barbara Channelthe Yiu Sea. Here comes the most amazing statement of the entire record"To the east the FU-tree may be seen [or Fu-sang] ." This instant document was written in the time of Yu, 2250 B.C., 2700 years before the time of Hwui Shan. At that early date, the Chinese had identified "Fu-sang." This is within 30 miles of the identical spot where I had previously calculated that Hwui Shan landed, at Point Hueneme, and from which place he journeyed east to the Kingdom of Women. As stated earlier, corn has been taken from excavations in this area, which, by the carbon-14 process, has been dated as being 4000 years old. The Chinese of 2200 B.C. named the tree Fu or Fu-Sang, and it was recognized at that time. Chinese literature, antedating Hwui Shan by more than a thousand years, makes frequent reference to "Fu-sang."</small></div>  
 <p><a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="green">p. 133</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Hwui Shan, without question, studied these ancient records and knew precisely where he was going before he started outhe came within 30 miles of the spot, identified in Yu's record, as being "Fu-sang" and Hwui Shan himself identified that place as being "Fu-sang." This statement on the part of Yu, appears to be the most highly significant identification in linking a definite point located 4000 years ago with Hwui Shan's description of 500 A.D., in Kuen 327. "To the east grows the FU-tree"and it did.</small></div>  
 <p>10. The third section of the "Eastern Classic" thus gives the entire distance along the nine mountains, from SHI-HU Mountain to WU-KAO Mountain, as six thousand eight hundred LI. Their gods all have human bodies and sheep's horns. When a sacrifice is offered to them, a ram is used. They use millet for food. When these gods are seen, then wind, rain, and floods cause ruin.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Section three gives the entire mileage from Mt. Fairweather, in Alaska, to Santa Barbara, California, as roughly 2260 miles. My calculations show 2100 milesthe variant, I believe, comes about in the area from Mt. Hood to Mt. Shasta, where the editor of the document, in China, has taken a straight line due south overlooking the journey of 166 miles over "shifting sand" which departed from an absolute due south direction. Given that 166 miles "over shifting sand" stretched out to the south instead of going inland, my calculations would come to 2266 milesor six miles over the Chinese figure.  
 </small><p>Again, there is a description of the Katchinahuman bodies and sheep's hornsand that in 2250 B.C., identified with the prayer for rain.</p></div>  <h5 align="center">Fourth Section</h5>  
 <p>1. The beginning of the fourth section of the "Eastern Classic" says that the Northern HAO Mountain slopes down to the North Sea. It has trees which look like Aspens, but which have red flowers. The fruit is like the jujube, but it has no pit. It tastes sour, but delicious. It is eaten without causing any ill results. The Stull River (or drinkable water) is found here, a</p>  
 <p><a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="green">p. 134</font></a></p>  
 <p>stream that flows northeasterly into the sea. Here there are wild animals which look like wolves, but which have red heads and rat's eyes. Their voices sound like those of sucking pigs, and they are called HIEH-TSU. They eat men. There are birds here which look like domestic fowls, but have white heads, rat's legs, and tiger's claws. They are called KWEI [or KI] birds, and they eat men.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: The last section of the Fourth Book starts at the "North Sea." The Strait of Juan de Fuca enters to the south of Vancouver Island and would be the only place on the Pacific coast where a large body of water is north of any land for an extended way. Mt. RainierHao Mountainslopes down to it. The Shih River is either the White River, which flows northeast for about fifteen miles before turning north and then west, emptying into Puget Sound, or it is the American, which also flows northeast from Rainier into the Naches, a tributary of the Yakima and the Columbiaand then to the sea. The white headed birds, the size of domestic fowl, having tiger's claws, that eat men, may in all probability be the bald eagle, which is common in the northwest.</small></div>  
 <p>2. And it says that, three hundred LI to the south, MAO Mountain is found. Here there are no trees and no grass. The TSANG-TI River is found here, a stream flowing westerly into the CHEN River (or a large body of water). In this there are many SIU fish. [These are shrimps, or the eels indicated by the character TSIU, and possibly the character SIU was then pronounced the same as TSIU.] These look like the carp, but have a larger head. Those who eat them have no swellings.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: 100 miles due south of Mt. Rainier, stands one of our most majestic peaksMt. Hood. The mountain is snowcapped and the tree-line is low. The small stream flowing westerly from Mt. Hood enters the Columbia near Gresham. The Columbia is the large river containing many fish that look like carp but have a larger headagain, they are salmon.</small></div>  
 <p>3. And it says that, three hundred and twenty LI to the south, the Eastern SHI Mountain is found. Upon this there are many green gems. Here there are trees which look like aspens, but which have red veins. Their sap is like blood, and they have no</p>  
 <p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="green">p. 136</font></a></p>  
 <p>fruit. These are called KI. They can break horses by its use [i.e., by rubbing them with this sap, horses become tame and gentle.] Clear River is found here, a stream flowing northeasterly into the sea. In this there are many delicious cowries and many cuttle-fish. These look like a goby, and have only one head with ten bodies. They smell like sedge-grass or a jungle. Those who eat them have no asthma. [It says that they cure the disease which consists of a difficulty in breathing.]</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Bachelor Butte, in central Oregon, stands 100 miles due south of Mt. Hood. From it, Squaw River flows northeasterly into the Deschutes, the Columbia, and to the sea. The fish with ten bodies, in this instance, may be a small octopus.</small></div>  
 <p>4. And it says that, three hundred LI to the southeast, NU-CHING Mountain is found. Upon this there are no trees, grass, or stones. KAO (Rich, Fertilizing) River is found here, a stream flowing westerly into LIH (Cauldron) River. In this there are many thin fish which look like herring, but have only one eye. Their voice sounds like vomiting [i.e., like the sound of a man retching and vomiting]. When these are seen, then heaven sends down a great draught.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Turning now to the southeast, we find Gearhart Mountain from which the Sprague River flows westerly into Upper Klamath Lake. The churning of the waters around Klamath Falls, may be the reason for the identification by the Chinese of a "cauldron." The "one-eyed" fish, I am unable to identifyit may be a "whimsy" or it may be some water animal that suggested itself to the Chinese as having one eye.</small></div>  
 <p>5. And it says that, two hundred LI to the southeast, the KIN (Imperial or Majestic) Mountain is found. Here there are many gems and much gold, but no stones. The SHI River is found there, a stream flowing northerly into KAO Marsh. In this there are many eels and cowrie-shells. Here there are wild animals which look like sucking pigs, but which have tusks. These are called TANG-KANG, deriving their name from their cry. When these are seen, then heaven causes the earth to produce much grain.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Continuing in a southeasterly direction, the Chinese came to Crane Mountain, the majestic peak. Crane Mountain</small></div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>has a stream flowing westerly into a marshthe entire area around is a swamp and marsh. The animals with tusks are probably small boar or peccary which 4000 years ago may have been in that region.</small></div>  
 <p>6. And it says that, two hundred LI to the southeast, TSZ-TUNG Mountain is found. TSZ-TUNG River is found here, a stream flowing westerly into YU-JU Marsh. In this there are many HWAH fish. These look like fish, but have bird's wings. They go out and in. They are bright. Their voices sound like those of the YUEN-YANG. When these are seen, then heaven sends down a great <a href="errata.htm#45">drought</a>.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Mahogany Peak, Nevada, fits the Chinese description. It has a small stream flowing west into a marshy area. This northwest section of Nevada is marsh and small lakes; it is a great feeding ground for water-fowl. The animal identified as a fish with wings, that go in and out of the water, may be a variety of duck or other water-fowl which abounds in the region.</small></div>  
 <p>7. And it, says that, two hundred LI to the northeast, YEN (Sharp-pointed) Mountain is found. Here there are many precious stones and much gold. There are also wild beasts which look like swine, but which have men's faces and yellow bodies, but red tails. These are called HOH-YU. Their voices sound like that of an infant child. These wild animals eat men, and eat vermin and serpents. When these are seen, then heaven sends down great rains.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Again the direction turned, this time to the northeast. Approximately 66 miles northeast from Mahogany Peak are two peaks, either one of which could fit the specifications Split Peak and Trident Peak both between 60 and 70 miles away. Trident, being some 1000 feet higher, is probably the one noted. No river or stream is mentioned as flowing from the peak and no major one was found. The Chinese note the presence of many precious stones and much gold. One of the most unusual gem deposits in the world is the opalized forest of Virgin Valley in northwestern Nevada, through which region the Chinese have just taken us. One of the largest known opals, 533 grams, a black opal with flashes of yellow, red,</small></div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>green and blue came from this specific region and is now housed in the collection of the National Museum.</small></div>  
 <p>8. And it says that, two hundred LI to the east, TAI (Immense) Mountain is found. Upon it there are many precious stones and much gold, and there are also many wax-trees. [These wax-trees do not shed their leaves in winter.] Here there are many wild animals which look like cattle, but which have a white head, one eye, and a serpent's tail. They are called FEI. When they go upon the water, they dry it up, and when they go upon the grass, they kill it. When these are seen, then heaven sends down a great pestilence. [It says that its body is full of a poisonous principle. The book called "KI-KIN" says that it is a locust or cricket called KIUNG. Its body looks harmless, but it causes the veins to wither and dry up, being more poisonous than the CHAN. All creatures fear it, and wish to keep at a great distance from it.] The KEU River is found here, a stream flowing northerly into LAO River. In this are many fish.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: Travelling due east from Trident for 70 miles, we find Capitol Peak, at the northeast end of the Santa Rosa Mountainsat the head of Paradise Valley. My map indicates hot springs in the valley, as well as mines in the general regionGetchell mine is about 50 miles distant. This whole territory is rich in precious stones and valuable minerals, as is well known. Trees would undoubtedly be green in the protected valley with hot springs not far away. A botanist would be able to identify the tree and whether it now grows there or whether 4000 years ago it didsome of these trees may be like the <a href="errata.htm#46">ginko</a>, which grew over considerable territory, anciently, but does not grow here today. The river flowing northerly into the Lao River, is the Little Owyhee which flows north from Capitol Peak into the Owyhee, a tributary of the Snake and the Columbia.</small></div>  
 <p>9. The fourth section of the "Eastern Classic" thus gives the entire distance along the eight mountains, from HAO Mountain to TAI Mountain, as one thousand seven hundred and twenty LI.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: This fourth section has been calculated by the Chinese to be 1720 LI, or 573 miles. From peak to peak, my pair of dividers came out exactly 570 milesor a three mile variation</small></div>  
 <p><a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="green">p. 139</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>from the ancient Chinese. Since this section is relatively short, and further, that it terminates in the middle of a mountain range with no way out, it is reasonable to assume that what we have is merely the first few pages of someone's little bamboo note bookthe remainder has been lost.</small></div>  
 <p>10. The above record of the "Classic of the Eastern Mountains" thus gives the distance along these forty-six mountains as eighteen thousand eight hundred and sixty LI.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Note: In compiling the entire record, back in China, it is evident that whoever did the job went on the assumption that each single section of the Fourth Book followed in sequence, south from the one that preceded itone man started where another man left off. On reading the notes, it is apparent that that could hardly have been the case.</small></div>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>In this Fourth Book of the Classic of the Eastern Mountains, compiled, according to the Chinese in 2250 B.C., we have set forth the translation as it was found. We faithfully followed directions, as promised at the start, and in every instance, where we were told to go south 100 miles, we went south 100 mileswhere we were directed to go by water, even in the interior, we went by water. Every mountain was found where the Chinese said it would be foundall rivers with the exception of two in the desert area, were found and found to flow in the proper direction. In two sections, I got lost in the tortuous mountain passes and came out short on mileage. I do not overlook the fact that errors are bound to be presentthey are inescapable.</p>  
 <p>On this Chinese "Cook's Tour," we thrilled with them at the sight of the golden aspen trees in Colorado; trekked across the Great Sand Dunes National Monument; saw the wild life in Canada and the pearly mussels in the Musselshell River; picked up black opals and a few nuggets in northern Nevada and turquoise in New Mexico; took a side excursion to see Klamath Falls and Mt. Shasta; watched the seals sporting on the rocks in San Francisco Bay; enjoyed eating the Columbia River salmon; were amused by the possum pretending to sleep; and finally came to the place where the FU-tree grewjust where Hwui Shan had said it did2700 years later.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="green">p. 140</font></a></p>  
 <p>On each one of these four journeys, the most outstanding characteristic of the region, as we know it, was the thing noted by the Chineseand many of them we have set aside as National Parks.</p>  
 <p>This is the mile by mile record that the ancient Chinese kept in their bamboo note-books.</p>
