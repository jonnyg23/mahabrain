 <h2 align="center">PROLOGUE I.
 </h2>
 <p>FIRST of all I exhort those who will read this book to peruse it with all
 attention and diligence, and not to run over it in a perfunctory manner, but
 with loving pains to study it and take into their minds impressions of the
 places, figures, and histories which it contains; and when the book has been
 read to the end, let them further look into the volume which we have composed
 for that lover of Christ, Constantinus: a volume wherein we have described more
 fully the whole earth, both the one beyond the ocean, and this one, and all its
 countries, together with the southern parts from Alexandria to the Southern
 Ocean, namely, the river Nile and the countries adjacent, and all the races of
 Egypt and Ethiopia; the Arabian Gulf besides, with the countries adjoining and
 their inhabitants as far as the same ocean, and likewise the middle country
 between the river and the gulf, with the cities, districts and tribes therein
 contained----a volume <a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> to prove that what things are said by us are
 true, and those false which are said by our adversaries, [114] for whose sake
 this book and the drawings <a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a> it contains have been prepared----those,
 I mean, concerning the size of the sun, and that sun-burnt, uninhabited part of
 the world about which they din our ears, and vomit out fictions and fables. Let
 me next exhort my readers to examine the sketch <a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a> of the universe and
 the stellar motions which we have prepared as a representation of <a name="p3">|3</a>
 the organic sphere of the pagans <a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a>, and to study the account of it
 sent to the pious deacon Homologus, then they with God's help are quite
 competent, especially with this book and the volume mentioned, to overthrow from
 the foundation the error of the pagan <a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a> theories. For if any Christian
 possesses these three works, and is by divine grace carefully exercised in the
 divine scriptures, he will easily confute the foolish views of the
 fable-mongers, for, from the figure itself, the constitution of the world and
 the very nature of things, they prove that the divine scriptures and the
 doctrines preached by Christians are perfectly true. Be strong then, ye
 Christians, in the Lord.

 </p>
 <h2 align="center">PROLOGUE II.
 </h2>
 <p align="center"><i>The Christian Topography of the whole world demonstrated from divine
 scripture, about which Christians ought not to doubt.</i>
 </p>
 <p>IN days long gone by I hesitated, O God-beloved, God-loving and Christ-loving
 <a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a> Pamphilus, to take in hand the treatise descriptive of the constitution of the
 whole world which you enjoined me to draw up. For even had I so wished, it was
 out of my power, as you well know, on account of the lingering illness by which
 I was prostrated. <a name="p4">|4</a> But since, in answer to your frequent prayers, I have recovered from that
 illness, accept at last the Preface to the books of the work which I submit,
 partly as fulfilling the obedience I owe you, and partly as dreading the
 condemnation of the sluggish servant which the discourse of our Saviour in the
 Gospels has pronounced. And let no one condemn me as overbold, because I conduct
 the exposition of my subject in a style homely and unmethodical, since it is not
 fine phrases the Christian requires but right notions. For while many be the
 darts and helmets and shields and wars set in motion against the Church, some
 supposed to be Christians, holding divine scripture of no account but despising
 and looking down upon it, assume like the Pagan philosophers, that the form of
 the heavens is spherical, being led into this error by the solar and lunar
 eclipses.<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a> We have therefore conveniently divided the subject of the
 book into five parts. In the outset then the first part is directed against the
 persons referred to who have been misled, and argues that one who wishes to
 profess Christianity cannot be led away by the plausible [115] errors of those
 outside the Church----errors which are opposed to divine scripture. For should
 any one choose to examine closely the Pagan theories he will find them to be
 entirely fictitious, fabulous sophistries, and to be utterly impossible. Then
 again, for the Christian who will naturally ask and say: these being refuted,
 what are the true theories that must be admitted in opposition to them? I have
 written the second book, which proceeds to explain from divine scripture the
 nature of the Christian theories----to describe the figure of the whole world,
 and to notice that some of the ancient Pagans have been of the same opinion.
 Then again, by way of replying to one <a name="p5">|5</a> who should doubt and ask: how does it appear that Moses and the prophets in
 saying such things say what is true? the third book exhibits the credibility of
 Moses and the Prophets, showing that they spake not of themselves, but as
 inspired by divine revelation, and that the writers alike of the Old and New
 Testament, men approved both by word and deed, having foreseen these things,
 declared them accordingly. It further shows what is the utility of delineations
 of the world, and how the notion of the sphere had its origin and beginning. The
 fourth book, again, has been written for behoof of those who wish to run their
 eye over the figures, and is a brief recapitulation, along with delineations, of
 what has been said before----a refutation, in fact, of the theory of the sphere
 and of the Antipodes. Then again, the fifth book has been written for those
 enquiring what the Christian theories are, and it shows that in what we have
 said and have represented by drawings we have neither devised fictions of our
 own nor invented new fables; but from revelation and from what God who created
 the world has ordained, have beheld the pattern of the whole world----namely the
 Tabernacle prepared by Moses, which the New Testament consistently with this
 view has pronounced to be an image of the whole world; and which also by means
 of the vail Moses divided, and so made one tabernacle into two, just as God also
 in the beginning divided what was one region, extending from the earth to the
 highest heaven, into two regions, by means of the firmament; and just as in the
 tabernacle there was an outer and an inner place, so here there was a lower and
 an upper. Now the lower is this world, and the upper is the world to come, into
 which also the Lord Christ, after having risen according to the flesh from the
 dead, ascended the first of all, and into which the righteous shall in their
 turn afterwards ascend. And since from Adam to Moses, and from Moses to John,
 and from John all the Apostles <a name="p6">|6</a> and Evangelists, have each and all in harmony, and both by words and types
 spoken of these two states; and since not one of them has uttered a discordant
 note, either saying that there was a state before the first, or supposing that
 there is a third after the second; but all of them, as if inspired by the Holy
 Ghost, have proclaimed that there are [116] but two states only, we, therefore,
 putting our confidence in the scriptures, which are truly divine, have not only
 sketched the figures of the whole world, but also of those very places by which
 you will find the Israelites made their exodus, also the mountain on which they
 received the law in writing, and were instructed in the knowledge of writing;
 also the delineation of the Tabernacle and the settlement in the Land of
 Promise; until he who was expected to arise from among them, and who was
 predicted by all the men of old and by the Prophets, did actually appear,
 proclaiming the future second state, which on his coming he showed in himself to
 us all, having entered into the inner Tabernacle, into the upper celestial
 region, into which at his second coming he shall call the righteous, saying: <i>Come,
 ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the
 foundation of the world. </i>To Him be glory for ever, Amen! <a name="p7">|7</a>

 <p align="center"><i>Against those who, while wishing to profess Christianity, think and

 </p>
 <p>
 <a name="img_cosmas1-5"></a>
 <img src="img/cosmas1-5.jpg">S many as ardently desire true knowledge and are lovers of the true light,
 and earnestly endeavour to become fellow-citizens of the saints in the age to
 come, who regard the Old and New Testament as in reality divine scripture, who
 are obedient to Moses and the Christ, who follow out to the end the principles
 they have adopted, who acknowledge <a name="p8">|8</a> that the world was produced by God out of mere nothing, and who believe that
 there is a resurrection of men and a judgment, and that the righteous shall
 inherit the Kingdom of Heaven; all these carefully examine the divine scriptures
 all throughout, to see whether in Moses, who wrote the account of the Creation,
 and in the other Prophets, they <a name="p9">|9</a> contain descriptions of the places and figures of the whole creation, among
 which is indicated also the position of the Kingdom of Heaven, which the Lord
 Christ promises God will give to righteous men. And when they find the Old and
 New Testaments to be in mutual harmony, they abide therein firmly grounded and
 immovable, in nothing confounded by their adversaries. But those on the other
 hand who prank themselves out in the wisdom of this world, and are
 self-confident that by scholastic reasonings they can comprehend its figure and
 position, scoff at all divine scripture as a mass of fables, stigmatising Moses
 and the prophets, the Lord Christ and the Apostles as idle babblers,<a href="#10"><sup>10</sup></a>
 [117] and given over to vain delusions; while with supercilious airs, as if they
 far surpassed in wisdom the rest of mankind, they attribute to the heavens a
 spherical figure and a circular motion, and by geometrical methods and
 calculations applied to the heavenly bodies, as well as by the abuse of words
 and by worldly craft, endeavour to grasp the position and figure of the world by
 means of the solar and lunar eclipses, leading others into error while they are
 in error themselves in maintaining that such phenomena could not present
 themselves if the figure was other than spherical. But concerning these matters
 we shall not enter into any discussion just at present, since those persons
 sufficiently confute the one the other. But those who wish to profess
 Christianity, while wishing at the same time to <a name="p10">|10</a>
 bedeck themselves with the principles, the wisdom, and the diversity of the
 errors of this world, and contend that one thing and another should be accepted,
 seem to differ nothing from a shadow which exists while the intermediate body
 from which it is projected is in light, but which cannot exist when that body is
 not in light, nay, is even obliterated by the light when the body is illuminated
 all round.
 </p>
 <p>It is against such men my words are directed, for divine scripture denounces
 them, as of old it denounced the strangers sojourning in Samaria, because they
 feared God and burned incense and offered worship on the high places.<sup><a href="#11"><sup>11</sup></a> </sup>Were
 one to call such men double-faced<a href="#12"><sup>12</sup></a> he would not be wrong, for, look
 you, they wish both to be with us and with those that are against us, thus
 making void their renunciation of Satan whom they renounced in baptism, and
 again running back to him. Now, such men cannot be with us at all; but they
 occupy a middle position, like empty houses standing high up in the air, without
 having either foundations in the earth below, or anything from above to hold
 them fast.<a href="#13"><sup>13</sup></a> For while they have as yet scarcely come by their
 principles they set about destroying them; and before they have yet destroyed
 them, they show that their end is unaccomplished, as they stand firm neither on
 the one side nor the other, but rather laugh at every one, and are themselves
 laughed at by all. In the first place, then, when arguing with them about the
 spherical figure, we showed that this figure was not possible, and was indeed
 quite inconsistent with the nature of things. Certain of them say that the
 heaven is a body consisting of four elements,<a href="#14"><sup>14</sup></a> but some later on
 superciliously <a name="p11">|11</a>  reconstructed it with an additional fifth new element,<a href="#15"><sup>15</sup></a> though formerly
 its essential constitution comprised only four elements, for they saw at a
 glance that the heaven could not revolve if it was composed of these. But herein
 again they are found to be blind even when they think that those who are
 sharp-sighted do not see. For since the heaven is seen to be of sundry and
 diverse colours, whence a power to produce heat and cold seems to be inherent in
 them, they say that the eyes of all are deceived by reason of their immense
 distance. Well, then, let any one of them who so wishes come forward and tell
 us: Why do the stars which, according to you are evidently fixed in an immovable
 sphere, not [118] apparently differ in colour and size, though their distances
 from us are seen to be unequal, if the centre of the earth be the point from
 which our eyes are directed towards them? And how is it that many of the fixed
 stars are equal and like to the planet we call Mars, to which a lower sphere has
 been assigned, and how do we in like manner see not a few of them to be like the
 planet Jupiter? But <a name="p12">|12</a> further, we do not even see the heaven itself to be of one and the same
 colour, for, if it were asked from whence can we surmise that the cloud-like
 concretions which you have named the galaxy, and which you have so designated
 simply because of the difference of their colour, have derived their peculiar
 appearance, while the surface on which the ray of vision strikes is uniform? and
 if I replied that these were proofs of the composition and mixture of different
 elements, no one, I apprehend, would dare to contradict me, even though he were
 a lover of falsehood, and much less if one of those who always assign the
 foremost place to truth. Now if the heaven has been constituted not of one
 single element endowed with a circular motion of its own, but of the mixture of
 the four elements, then it cannot well revolve. For it has been said that it
 must either be moved downward if the heavy element preponderate, or be carried
 upward if the opposite light one prevail, or must be stationary when no element
 is preponderant. This is certainly obvious to everybody. For no one would admit
 that he has ever seen the heaven move either upwards or downwards.<a href="#16"><sup>16</sup></a>
 It must be allowed therefore that it is firmly fixed. But should they ask:
 Whence are these motions that differ from the rest in an element that is simple
 and without qualities? since they say, and not untruly, that those bodies which
 they call planets revolve oppositely to the universe; and if in like manner they
 say that their revolution is accomplished in certain <a name="p13">|13</a>
 times which the Creator has fixed, it is evident that they do not even deny
 that the planets advance from the East.<a href="#17"><sup>17</sup></a>
 </p>
 <p>Then being mazed with perplexing doubts, as usually happens to those who
 shrink from the truth, they say, on finding no way of escape, that the stars
 make retrogressions and pauses. But tell me, ye souls that are so ingenious in
 tying and untying knots, if from their very nature they have motion, how comes
 it that they stand still? For nothing that can thwart them enters as an element
 into their natural constitution. And tell me this besides, what is the force or
 what the necessity which imposes on them the contrary motion? And here let no
 one tell me that it is an ocular deception; for it is no minute distance to
 which they advance, seeing that they are often observed to shift their place
 from a sign of the zodiac that is in the rear to one in front. But what must we
 say of our opponents when passing on to the operations of the stars themselves,
 they reach the very height of absurdity, all unconscious that they themselves
 stand still or move backward, and are but a sorry set of good-for-nothing
 rascals? Now anyone would say that the star previously seen in Aries, but at
 present appearing in Pisces, was not in the house of Mars, but in that of
 Jupiter, and that it [119] makes <i>movements, </i>not such as they babble about
 when it is in Aries, but those which they ascribe to it in its transit through
 Pisces. But if they do not admit the retrograde motion <i>of the planets </i>which
 is apparent, whence then or wherefore is their course in both directions? They
 will perhaps in reply assign as the cause those invisible epicycles which they
 have assumed as vehicles on which, as they will insist, the planets are borne
 along. But they will <a name="p14">|14</a> be in no better case from this invention, for we shall ask: Why have they
 need of vehicles? Is it because they are incapable of motion? Then, if so, why
 should you assert them to be animated, and that too even with souls more than
 usually divine? Or is it that they are capable? The very idea is, methinks,
 ridiculous. And why have not the moon and the sun their epicycles? Is it that
 they are not worthy on account of their inferiority? But this could not be said
 by men in their sober senses. Was it then from the scarcity of suitable material
 the Creator could not construct vehicles for them? On your own head let the
 blasphemy of such a thought recoil.
 </p>
 <p>Cease, O ye wiseacres! prating worthless nonsense, and learn at last though
 late to follow the divine oracles and not your own baseless fancies. For, tell
 us, how ye think that the fixed stars move in an opposite direction to the
 universe? Is such a motion theirs only or that of the sphere in which they are
 placed? Then, if it is theirs, how do they traverse unequal orbits in equal
 time? And how comes it that of the stars in the galaxy not one has ever gone
 outside of it, nor any of those outside is seen nearer it or within it? But if
 one should say that it is the sphere which moves in the opposite direction, then
 it will be found that at the same time it moves oppositely to itself. But who
 can imagine a greater absurdity than this? Thus they do their best to prevent
 anyone surpassing them in their effrontery----or rather, let me say, in impiety,
 since they do not blush to affirm that there are people who live on the under
 surface of the earth. What then, should some one question them and say: Is the
 sun to no purpose carried under the earth? these absurd persons will, on the
 spur of the moment, without thinking, reply that the people of the Antipodes are
 there----men carrying their heads downwards, and rivers having a position
 opposite to the rivers here! thus taking in hand to turn every thing <a name="p15">|15</a>
 upside down rather than to follow the doctrines of the truth, in which there
 are no futile sophisms, but which are plain and easy and full of godliness,
 while they procure salvation for those who reverently consult them.
 </p>
 <p>But you will most effectually rebuke them if you say: Why does that sphere of
 yours not revolve from the north to the south, or from some other quarter to its
 opposite? And do not tell me, in answer, that such seemed better to the Maker of
 the world, for my <a href="#18"><sup>18</sup></a> .... But how can you [120] deem that you speak
 consistently with the nature of things in supposing that the whole heaven is in
 motion and describes a circle, without also supposing that outside of it there
 is either some other space or body, even though it were imaginary. For it is
 impossible any thing can move apart from the four elements, but must move either
 in earth, or in water, or in air, or in fire, whether it is transferred from
 place to place into the infinite, or whether it always revolves in the same
 place. But if the heaven as it revolves passes into the infinity of space, we
 must suppose that beyond it there is an infinite earth into which it rolls, when
 noiselessly leaving what is behind it; but if one of the other three elements be
 supposed, in not one of them is the sphere adapted to roll and rotate; nay, were
 it to be shot into any of them, a whizzing noise would attend the transition.
 But if, again, it rolls and rotates always in the same spot without moving from
 place to place, then it must be upheld by supports like a turner's lathe, or an
 artificial globe, or on an axis like a machine or a waggon. And if so, then we
 must again inquire by what the supports and axles are themselves upheld, and so
 on <i>ad infinitum. </i>And tell me, pray, how are we to suppose the axis passes
 through the middle of the earth, and of what material it consists.
 </p>
 <p>When these problems then concerning the nature of <a name="p16">|16</a>
 things are discussed, there remains the conclusion, as we said before, that
 the heaven is fixed and does not revolve. But even in supposing that the earth
 is in the middle of the universe, as its centre, you immediately give the
 deathblow to your own theory when you repeat that the middle is below, for it is
 impossible that the same thing can at once both be in the middle and below, for
 the middle is the middle between up and down, or between right and left, or
 between before and behind. Why do you then, when beleaguered with difficulties,
 utter absurdities contrary to nature, in opposition to scripture? For being in
 terror lest any one should pose you with this question: How can this unspeakable
 weight of the earth be held suspended by the air and not fall down? you have
 invented stones of things that are not true, but strange; and, reversing the
 order of things, give out that the middle is below; so that if any should
 suppose that instead of the earth, fire was the middle, you would then say that
 the middle was above instead of below, seeing that the tendency of fire is
 upward. To me, therefore, they seem to subvert the first by means of the second,
 and the second by means of the first. But if they say that the air because it
 surrounds the earth equally on all sides, is pushed on by the universe, and that
 the earth remains immovable, and swerves neither to the one side nor the other,
 why do men <a href="#19"><sup>19</sup></a> and the irrational animals that live on land or fly in
 the air not move along with it, while all of them cleave the air in walking and
 in traversing it, and in going on high. And not only is it incapable of
 resisting these, but it cannot even sustain the weight of the lightest inanimate
 things, such as the shortest of feathers and the smallest of straws, but all of
 them cut it, it is so attenuated and so rare, and they outstrip it according to
 the force with which they are propelled. How then can we receive such false
 theories? <a name="p17">|17</a> 
 </p>
 <p>But should one wish to examine more elaborately the question of the
 Antipodes, he would easily find them to be old wives' fables. For if two men on
 opposite sides placed the soles of their feet each against each, whether they
 chose to stand on earth, or water, or air, or fire, or any other kind of body,
 how could both be found standing upright? The one would assuredly be found in
 the natural upright position, and the other, contrary to nature, head downward.<a href="#20"><sup>20</sup></a>
 Such notions are opposed to reason, and alien to our nature and condition. And
 how, again, when it rains upon both of them, is it possible to say that the rain
 falls down upon the two, and not that it falls down to the one and falls up to
 the other, or falls against them, or towards them, or away from them. For to
 think that there are Antipodes compels us to think also that rain falls on them
 from an opposite direction to ours; and any one will, with good reason, deride
 these ludicrous theories, which set forth principles incongruous, ill-adjusted,
 and contrary to nature.
 </p>
 <p>And if one should examine that other sophism of theirs, namely, that the
 earth is inflated with air, and that earthquakes occur when the pent-up air
 shakes the earth violently, he would be amazed at the imposture and the
 contradiction in their statements. For if the earth when equally pressed by the
 whole air stands unshaken and unswerving, then, when inflated it ought to be all
 the heavier in that quarter, and to swerve to a side, after the example of man
 which they adduce. For not only does a man shake and tremble when attacked with <a name="p18">|18</a>
 flatulency, but he trembles when seized with terror, and when overcome with wine,
 and pinched with cold, and when his blood boils with anger, and when he is old
 and imbecile, but when he reels under the effects of flatulency death results.
 Why then does not the earth also, which according to them is inflated with air,
 not collapse and lose its proper place? And why, again, do they further say that
 Egypt, because its soil is porous and its furrows allow the air to escape
 without violent shocks, is not subject to earthquakes, while in point of fact
 earthquakes have been of frequent occurrence in that country, and so violent as
 to overthrow cities and level them with the ground: and not only so, but even in
 the times of the Greeks, when Alexander, and Seleucus, and Antiochus, and
 Ptolemy ruled and reigned, they had recourse to the assistance of
 philosophers----Aristotle and his like----and frequently gave practical effect
 to what they advised? And when Antioch was being founded by Seleucus <a href="#21"><sup>21</sup></a>
 and Antiochus, how was it that the philosophers were not able to point out that
 the country there was not safe from earthquakes, but on the [122] contrary
 exposed to their frequent visitations? And this we say from having seen that
 this city has been repeatedly overthrown by earthquakes; and not Antioch only
 but Corinth also, which has close at her hand the mob of the philosophers.
 </p>
 <p>But if we should care to examine yet another of their opinions----that in
 which they say and try to prove by illustrations----that rain is produced from
 vapour drawn up <a name="p19">|19</a> by heat into the atmosphere, in the same way, say they, as the bath draws up
 vapour from the heat, and lets it fall in drops; and just as a cupping-glass
 draws up moisture by means of tow and fire, so too does the sun draw up vapour,
 and in course of time lets it fall in drops, whence rain is produced. One cannot
 but marvel at such wisdom as this, imposing, as it does by its speciousness,
 upon the multitude. For since the bath derives its heat not from above but from
 below, how can it be said to draw up, and npt rather to push up? So too in the
 case of a caldron: it receives its heat not from above but from below, and in
 both instances the vapours are pushed up by the heat, and in the rebound, due in
 the one case to the roof and in the other to the lid, they fall in drops.
 Similar is the case of the cupping-glass, which, did not this instrument itself
 constrain nature and suck up moisture, would never have sucked it up at all,<a href="#22"><sup>22</sup></a>
 no, not even if fire and tow had been applied ten thousand times over. But
 further, when one thrusts a damp faggot into the fire, moisture is to such a
 degree pushed by the heat that both moisture and smoke are expelled from the
 other end of the faggot. And when one has kindled a fire on the ground he sees
 the moisture in the faggots conveyed upwards by the smoke, not drawn up by what
 is above but pushed up by the heat of the fire. Nay, more, if one washes a
 garment and spreads it on the ground, and if, when it has been dried by the sun,
 he lifts it up, he will find the moisture which has been expelled from it by the
 heat impressed on the ground in the very <a name="p20">|20</a>
 shape of the garment. In like manner, if one places a hot piece of meat on a
 trencher he will see the moisture discharged in both directions, both upwards
 and downwards, the heat being intermediate, for above he sees the steam mounting
 upwards, and below he sees the trencher bathed in moisture on which the meat has
 impressed its own shape; whence it appears that heat does not draw up, as these
 sages tell us, but rather pushes up.
 </p>
 <p>But when we propose a new question to them: Why is it that in the Thebaid,
 where the ground is parched up by the heat, the moisture is not drawn up and
 turned into rain for that country? they defend themselves by saying that it is a
 moderate and not an excessive heat that causes the drawing up. To this we shall
 give a very summary reply: And how happens it, we shall ask, that beyond the
 Thebaid, in Ethiopia, where the heat is far greater, there are frequent copious
 downfalls of rain? And how can they say, those many and tip-top wise men, that
 the sun has the power of drawing upwards, and assert also quite confidently that
 in the course of his revolution he becomes heated by friction, while they will
 not entertain the supposition that the heat is in him by nature. But more: when
 they allow that the air is moist and hot, what need have [123] those wiseacres
 to resort to sophistry and say that the moisture is drawn up from elsewhere,
 when up above they have the heat and moisture at the same spot? But if one
 should ask them about one particular element as it is in itself, that is, should
 ask them to show its distinctive quality, they immediately find themselves at a
 loss, and attribute two qualities to one single element and say: Earth is <i>dry
 and cold; </i>water, <i>cold and moist; </i>air, <i>moist and warm; </i>fire, <i>warm
 and dry; </i>so that, being beleaguered with difficulties, they assign eight
 qualities to the four elements. But at times they say that all the qualities
 exist in each of the elements. Once more, therefore, they <a name="p21">|21</a>
 contradict their own words, by ascribing not four but only two qualities to
 each of the four elements. I marvel accordingly at those most excellent men when
 they attribute to water <i>coldness and humidity, </i>and to the air <i>humidity
 and heat. </i>How do they say that water, that is, the <i>cold and moist, </i>congeals
 and becomes ice in winter-time? Wherefrom comes that extreme cold which converts
 it into ice? For if they shall say that the departure of the sun naturally
 produces this effect, why does it not produce the same effect on the air, which
 is naturally <i>warm, </i>and at the same time <i>moist, </i>but makes it, on
 the contrary, extremely <i>cold? </i>And how does <i>the cold </i>itself----that
 is, water----not make the air----that is, <i>the moist</i>----freeze, but, on
 the contrary, it is the latter which makes the former freeze, as we actually
 see? Now though I have many things more to say about this question and the
 examples which they erroneously adduce in favour of their view of it, I curb
 myself, for I feel ashamed of the foolishness of what is said by them, and
 consider what has already been said on this subject sufficient.
 </p>
 <p>There is, however, another sophism held by these wise men which I am
 especially anxious to deal with, and will forthwith proceed to discuss. They say
 that the heaven which they call a body contains the whole world, and stoutly
 maintain that outside of it nothing whatever exists; and yet they define angels
 and demons and souls, which are parts of the world as uncircumscribed, neither
 containing the heaven, nor contained by the heaven, not understanding what they
 say, since that which neither contains nor is contained is never by any
 possibility seen among things that are. If then these things be as they say, let
 them tell us with respect to their own soul whether it is, or is not. And if
 they say it is not, then to their own shame and disgrace they assume themselves
 to be soulless. But if they say that it exists, let them tell us whether it is <a name="p22">|22</a>
 in them or is not in them. If they reply that it is not in them, they answer
 not less shamelessly and foolishly than they did before. But if they reply that
 the soul is in them, we must ask them a further question: As the body is
 circumscribed by the heaven, why is not the soul also circumscribed? And if, as
 they say, it illuminates the body without being circumscribed along with it, the
 question arises, where is it when it illuminates the body? since it is
 impossible that, being a created thing, it should not exist with things created.
 And if they say it exists somewhere [124] within the heaven, then it is again
 circumscribed by the body itself of the heaven, although it was represented by
 them as uncircumscribed. But if they make it exist outside the heaven, they, in
 the first place, confute themselves; in the next place, it will either be in a
 part of the heaven and occupy but a small part of it, or it will be in the whole
 of it, in which case it will circumscribe the heaven and will be found having
 form like a bodily substance; and this a spherical form embracing and limiting
 the sphere. But if, again, they say that as being uncircumscribed it pervades
 all things both within and without, let them not blind themselves to the fact
 that they arc both introducing polytheism and imagining an equality with God.
 For this property pertains to none except the uncreated Deity who created and
 fashioned the universe. So then, professing themselves to be wise, they become
 fools, as says the blessed Paul the Apostle, having changed the glory of the
 uncircumscribed Deity to their own created souls, thus appropriating to
 themselves the glory due to God. They must therefore in every way be avoided.
 For, saith the Apostle, from those turn away who hold an outward form of
 godliness but deny the power thereof.

 (παραγραφαὶ) which occur in this work have been inserted for the clearer
 exposition of the text (του̃ κειμένου). The reader should therefore read first
 the text and then the notes." As Cosmas in this book seeks to confute the
 system of astronomy called the Ptolemaic----because Ptolemy, though not its
 founder, was its chief exponent----it may be of service if we remind the reader
 of the main outlines of that system. It assumed that the earth was the Centre of
 the universe, and that the heavenly bodies revolved round it in perfect circles
 and at a uniform rate of motion. Such phenomena as were found to be inconsistent
 with these assumptions were explained by means of subsidiary hypotheses. The
 belief that the earth was the centre of the universe seemed to accord with the
 relation in which the primary elements of which the material world was thought
 to be composed stood to each other. Thus <i>earth, </i>as being the stablest
 element, held the lowest place and supported <i>water, </i>above which was
 placed <i>air, </i>and above that again, <i>fire, </i>while <i>ether </i>was supposed to extend indefinitely
 above the others. In or beyond the ether were certain heavens, each of which
 contained a crystalline sphere, whereto was attached a heavenly body, which by
 the revolution of its crystalline sphere was made to move round the earth. When
 it was discovered that the planets move sometimes from west to east, sometimes
 from east to west, and for some time remain stationary at the point where
 progression ends and retrogression begins, the ancient astronomers were greatly
 puzzled, and to account for these irregularities in the planetary movements
 invented the hypothesis of epicycles. This doctrine is explained as follows in
 the article on the Ptolemaic System of Astronomy in Chambers's <i>Encyclopaedia:
 </i>" The acceleration of the sun on one side, and retardation on the other
 side of his orbit, is only apparent, and results from the earth not being in the
 centre of his sphere, c (see fig.), but at E, and consequently his motion
 appears to be slowest at P and quickest at R.<br>

 <a name="img_cosmas1-6"></a>
 <img src="img/cosmas1-6.jpg">
 </p><p>"The alternate progression and regression of the planets was accounted
 for by supposing them to move, not directly with their crystallines, but in a
 small circle whose centre was a fixed point in the crystalline, and which
 revolved on its axis as it was carried round with the latter; thus (fig.) the
 planet was carried round the small circle A B D, as that circle was carried
 round P Q R (now supposed to represent the planetary crystalline). The planet,
 while in the outer portion of its small circle, would thus have a forward and in
 the inner portion a backward motion. The larger circle was called an <i>eccentric
 </i>and the smaller an <i>epicycle</i>"

 <p><a name="#15"></a>15. <sup>1</sup> Aristotle invented a term,  ἐντελέχεια , to denote <i>actuality
 </i>of existence in contrast to its mere potentiality,  δύναμις. His
 followers, however, eventually came to use the term in the sense of a <i>fifth
 element, </i>namely <i>mind, </i>which differed entirely in its nature from the
 four elements of common speech. To this effect I may quote the words of Cicero:
 "Dicaearchus .... quemdam Phthiotam senem .... disserentem inducit, nihil
 esse omnino animum et hoc esse nomen totum inane .... Aristoteles .... quum
 quattuor nota illa genera principiorum esset complexus, e quibus omnia
 orerentur, quintam quamclam naturam censet esse, e qua sit mens. Cogitare enim
 et providere et discere .... haec et similia eorum in horum quattuor generum
 inesse nullo putat: quintum genus adhibet vacans nomine et sic ipsum animum 
 ἐνδελέχειαν appellat novo nomine quasi quamdam continuatam motionem et
 perennem." (<i>Tusc. Disp., </i>i, 21, 22). Cicero has here confounded 
 ἐντελέχεια with ἐνδελέχειαν,<i> </i>of which he has given the meaning
 correctly. Probably he had not seen the word in the written pages of Aristotle,
 but only heard it from the lips of Greek Peripatetics, who, like their
 countrymen of the present day, pronounced the letter  ταυ̃ very like
 δέλτα.

 in 526 A. D., and almost entirely destroyed the city, which, however, Justinian
 had rebuilt with great splendour before it was captured by Chosroes in 540 A.D.
 Corinth also suffered severely from this memorable earthquake.

 </i>Charton does not give this illustration, though he gives the two which
 precede it. The argument is that it is the instrument ( ὄργανον,<i> i.e., </i>the
 cupping-glass), which draws up the blood to the punctures, and not the heat from
 the wick burning inside the glass to produce a vacuum. There is an ambiguity in
 the statement of the argument.</p>
