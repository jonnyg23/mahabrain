 			</p><h4>PROCEEDINGS</h4>
  
 			<p>MR. KEAN: That's the gavel.  Good morning. On behalf of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States, I hereby call to order this second hearing and, of course, our first hearing in Washington, D.C.
 			</p><p>Let me begin by expressing our gratitude to members of the public who are following our deliberations, whether they're here in person or whether they're watching on television.    Let me say, too, that since we held our first public hearing in New York on March 31st and April 1st, a number of individuals have contacted our staff.  Some expressed sympathy and support for the families of those who died on September 11th.  Others have offered us their help and have provided our investigators with some very useful information.  So, I'd like to emphasize that if anyone here with us today or watching elsewhere has any information that they believe will be helpful to our investigation, please contact the Commission through its website: www.9-11commission.gov.
 			</p><p>I also want to express my deep gratitude, and that of the entire Commission, to the families of those who died in the attacks on our country on September 11th, and to the many who survived them and their families.  They have given unsparingly of themselves to see that we have the necessary resources to do our work, and they've also uncovered some very valuable information that they have passed onto us.  
 			</p><p>As we begin today, let me say that the Commission's central mission, as all of us see it, is threefold.  
 			</p><p>First, we are charged with giving the American public a full accounting of the events of September 11th.  Ours is the only entity tasked by the United States government with presenting an authoritative account of those events.
 			</p><p>Second, we will attempt to find out how and why the tragedy that took place on that day could have occurred.  Clearly, something went wrong.  We need to establish the fullest factual account possible so that these problems can be fixed.
 			</p><p>The third part of our mission is perhaps the most important. We're going to make specific policy recommendations that might help prevent future terrorist attacks and make the people of our country safer. 
 			</p><p>And we're going to press for swift implementation of these recommendations after we make them.
 			</p><p>Now let me say a brief word about what the Commission's been doing.   We've opened offices in Washington, and within a month, we're going to have our opening for our office in New York.  We have assembled a staff of some 55 people divided into nine research teams. Each of those teams is deeply immersed in the parts of the investigation they were specifically recruited to conduct.  We're examining some very, very sensitive material.  Much of it's classified, so it's not always possible to share everything we're doing with the public, but we'll try to share as much as possible and what we learn as our investigation proceeds.  Where possible, we will present our findings in public hearings such as this one.
 			</p><p>We might question witnesses we will hear from today again -- perhaps, if it's sensitive matters, in closed session -- as we continue with our investigation, to get additional information.  So to those who requested us to ask particular questions today, I'd say please be patient.  Some of the items you brought to our attention are going to asked today and will come up in our discussion.  Others will come up in different forums.  
 			</p><p>We'll be exploring two topics at this hearing.  The first will be the role of the Congress, oversight of the agencies responsible for intelligence gathering, national security and homeland security.  The second is the state of aviation security -- before September 11th, on September 11th and after September 11th.
 			</p><p>We're now going to hear from three panels of members of the United States Congress.  Our first panel consists of members of Congress who sponsored the legislation that brought this Commission into existence.  Members of the Commission have met with many members of Congress in the course of our work.  Today, I believe, however, is the first time congressmen and senators who really supported the need for our Commission and a commission of this kind have the opportunity to share with us in public what they would most like the Commission to achieve.
 			</p><p>Each of the three members of this first panel is well-known to us and probably well-known to most of the people in the country.  They're Senators John McCain of Arizona and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, and the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi of California.  And I believe we're going to begin with you, Senator McCain.
 			</p><p>    SEN. MCCAIN:  I think Congresswoman Pelosi has a commitment --
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Oh, Congresswoman Pelosi?  Fine.
 			</p><p>SEN. MCCAIN:  -- and I'd be glad if she would proceed.
 			</p><p>REP. PELOSI:  Thank you very much, Chairman Kean, Vice Chairman Hamilton, very distinguished members of this Commission.  I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding to me because of my responsibilities on the House side, and I'm very honored to be here today to testify before, as I said, this very distinguished Commission, in the presence of two people, Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain, who were instrumental.  Their leadership, in fact, made this Commission possible, along with that of my colleague from the House Congressman Tim Roemer, who serves on this Commission. I commend him also, for his great leadership.
 			</p><p>Since the horrific attacks of September 11th, the United States has had two primary goals:  first, we must identify the individuals and the groups responsible for this horrific act and bring them to justice. And next, what you put forth, Mr. Chairman:  to provide a full account of why and how -- why the attacks were not prevented and how they can be prevented in the future.
 			</p><p>With respect for the families so affected and responsibility to the American people, many of us thought that it was important to have an independent commission to review events leading up and post-9/11. From the outset, I believed that a review of the events leading up to the attacks, including the government's response and the larger issue of our nation's preparedness for terrorist attacks, needed to be comprehensive and conducted independently by individuals who could bring fresh thinking to the issues at hand.  Congressional investigations, no matter how thorough, would likely be restricted primarily to the jurisdiction of the committee or committees involved. Because the government would conduct such investigations, they would be unlikely to achieve the same degree of public acceptance as an independent inquiry.
 			</p><p>It is unfortunate that such an inquiry did not begin much sooner, right after 9/11.  Within weeks of the attack, I offered legislation to establish such an independent commission, to be conducted by people who would challenge conventional wisdom and who had wide perspective and broad experience in dealing with complex problems.  Unfortunately, agreement could not be reached on how much power to give the review, and the commission I proposed was defeated on the House floor.
 			</p><p>I was pleased, however, that through the leadership and the persistence of a member of this commission, former congressman Tim Roemer, as I mentioned, and that of Senators McCain and Senator Lieberman, this body was established and has begun its critical work.  Thank you, Tim Roemer.  Thank you, Senators McCain and Lieberman.  Our entire country is deeply in your debt. 
 			</p><p>Fortunately, the time between the idea for this commission and its creation was not completely lost.  The inquiry undertaken by the House Intelligence Committee Subcommittee on Terrorism and the nearly year-long joint investigation by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees both answered questions about the nation's state of preparedness and also identified areas in which further work is necessary.
 			</p><p>I am aware that the committees are following up in those areas, even as they work toward the release of a declassified version of the report.  I'm confident that the work of these inquiries has been and will continue to be of assistance to this commission.  I hope that it is available to you.
 			</p><p>These congressional reviews were necessary, and they have produced important records that enhance our understanding of what happened on September 11th and why.  At the same time, these reviews do not tell the full story.  Both reviews were focused on the work of the intelligence community, rather than the performance of the federal government as a whole, both prior to and after the devastating attacks.  Whatever failures occurred in the intelligence agencies may have been matched in seriousness by failures in other agencies.
 			</p><p>This is not to excuse either the intelligence community specifically or the federal government generally.  Rather it is to say that the greatest service this commission can perform is to provide a clear picture of how the federal government, as a whole, was or was not working against terrorism before September 11th, how the pieces fit or did not fit, and the consequences of the government's performance.
 			</p><p>For example, and very important, the joint congressional inquiry on which I served, as a member of the Intelligence Committee, did not have access to records of the National Security Council.  I believe that a review of those records are essential to a thorough understanding of decisions made by the administration on terrorism matters, and I hope that this Commission is successful in obtaining access to them.
 			</p><p>Since the attacks, steps have been taken to realign federal agencies and change responsibilities, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security -- another brainchild of the senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman -- and the Terrorism Threat Integration Center being among the most notable. 
 			</p><p>These may turn out to be worthwhile actions; however, my concern has been that these entities were instinctive responses -- although Senator Lieberman had suggested his department long before September 11th -- to general perception that things were not right, rather than a result of an exhaustive inquiry across the government with specific findings and specific recommendations for change.  This is a critical role your commission can and must play.
 			</p><p>One question that has arisen, and very much in the forefront of everyone's thinking, is the role of congressional oversight.  The activities of the Congress before September 11th are appropriate area of inquiry, and to this point, have not been examined closely.  There has been concern that prior to the attacks, responsibility for oversight of homeland security issues has been too diffused within Congress.  
 			</p><p>In the House, a subcommittee and a separate appropriations subcommittee have been created to address that concern.  It is still too early for either of these entities to have produced a record on which to base judgments.  Nevertheless, I expect that a separate appropriations subcommittee will ensure that the homeland security programs that are not funded through subcommittees such as Defense or Transportation, which is the case now, will receive the resources they need.
 			</p><p>Adequate funding for homeland security presumes that it is accorded a high priority in budget submissions.  But I'm sorry to say this has not been the case; for example, the Coast Guard maintains it needs $6.6 billion over the next 10 years for port security and related activities.  Yet, the Bush administration has requested only $500 million thus far, despite the enactment of legislation that underscores the critical needs in this area.  I bring this up because it points to the fact that resources that Congress devotes to any given agency or effort have been less reflective of the organization of congressional committees and more reflective of the importance they are given by the Bush administration.  
 			</p><p>Although it is too early to judge what impact the changes already made in the House will have on the oversight process, I do not believe that additional changes are necessary at this point.  You may reach a different conclusion, and if you do, I, of course, will respect and be interested in your thinking.  My belief, however, is that the mechanisms are in place to conduct effective oversight and that it's up to the congressional leaders to make sure that those mechanisms are employed vigorously.  In closing, I want to reiterate the enormous significance I attach to your efforts and the high hopes I have for your success. The tragedy of September 11th is so immense that as we go forward to meet the challenges, we must always remember that we are walking on sacred ground.  Members of the families of those who were lost on September 11th have told me that just mere hearing a plane going overhead fills them with terror.  We must remove that fear from those families and from the American people.  Any review of this tragedy must, therefore, be conducted in a way that reflects the enormity of the losses the nation has suffered; the magnitude of the sacrifices endured by the families of the victims.  Your work will be essential in providing answers about why government agencies collectively did not do better in advance of September 11th and how they can improve their performance in the future.
 			</p><p>Along with the American people, especially the families and friends of those we have lost, I eagerly await the results of your deliberation and once again want to commend Senator McCain, Senator Lieberman and Congressman Roemer for their great leadership, and to you, Mr. Chairman, and your vice-chair and all the members of the Committee. 
 			</p><p>God bless you, and Godspeed in your very, very important work.
 			</p><p>Thank you.  (Applause.)
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you very much, Congresswoman.
 			</p><p>Senator McCain?
 			</p><p>SEN. MCCAIN:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank all the members of the commission for your willingness to serve in this very difficult and daunting task.
 			</p><p>The September 11th attacks represented a massive failure in the most fundamental duty of our government: the security of the American people from foreign attack. That developed over the course of successive administrations.  When Joe Lieberman and I called for an independent commission, we stated clearly that it shouldn't be a witch hunt directed at one particular administration, one particular agency or particular individuals; that it should be an honest, probing and thorough review and critique of U.S. policies, programs and practices spanning almost two decades and four administrations prior to September 11th, 2001, with the goal of understanding what we did wrong, how we can learn from identified failures, weaknesses and vulnerabilities in order to make necessary systemic corrections.  A full and frank accounting of such policies, programs and practices should be far ranging and candid in assessing the failures of vision, threat assessment and policy response that preceded the attacks.
 			</p><p>The joint congressional investigation into the intelligence failures associated with September 11th did critical work in uncovering how elements of our government failed to share and use existing information to divine the terrorists' planning and intentions.  This commission should expand on the joint congressional committee's investigation of the myriad failures that prevented significant information in our possession about the September 11th plot from being pursued by the relevant agencies.  The commission should also recommend additional reforms above and beyond those implemented to date, to rationalize the way intelligence information is collected, analyzed, disseminated and acted upon to improve the effectiveness of our efforts to deter, preempt and counter extremist terrorism.
 			</p><p>Mr. Chairman, I was disheartened that members of your commission were, until recently, denied access to the report of the joint congressional investigation into the September 11th terrorist attack. Using the congressional committee's report as the baseline for your work would theoretically have allowed the Commission to hit the ground running.   
 			</p><p>Instead you've been stuck in the quicksand of negotiating access to a document you should have been entitled to examine on a priority basis at the beginning of your tenure.
 			</p><p>I find it particularly troubling that Commission member and former Congressman Tim Roemer, who helped write the congressional report as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, was, until this month, denied access to his committee's own product.
 			</p><p>While I don't want to believe such a basic lack of cooperation was intentional, it nevertheless creates the appearance -- and I emphasize creates the appearance -- of bureaucratic stonewalling.
 			</p><p>The long-running dispute between the joint congressional committee and the administration over the declassification and public release of the committee report sets a troubling precedent for administration cooperation with your commission.  Excessive administration secrecy on issues related to the September 11th attacks feeds conspiracy theories and reduces the public's confidence in government.
 			</p><p>I strongly believe the commission will need access to the National Security Council documents denied the congressional committee.  I hope the administration will not abuse the principle of executive privilege to deny the Commission the critical repository of day-to-day activity on issues related to the terrorist attacks.
 			</p><p>Similarly, the Commission's ability to interview key administration officials is essential.  Without full cooperation on access to documents and officials, the administration will raise more questions than the Commission will be able to answer.
 			</p><p>The operations of the joint congressional investigations hold a valuable lesson for the commission on securing information from the executive branch.  Leaders of the joint congressional committee, Republican and Democrat, have been highly critical of the administration's resistance to congressional committee requests for information related to the attacks.
 			</p><p>The committee subpoena power was critical to the success it did not enjoy in ferreting out information related to the attacks.  As with the congressional committee, it is my hope that your commission will agree to issue most subpoenas by consensus and that any votes on subpoenas will not split the Commission along partisan lines.  I support the fullest possible public disclosure of all the commission's hearings and findings.  I encourage you to hold public hearings like this one as frequently as possible and to publicly issue substantive interim reports on the Commission's progress.  This is particularly important to the families of September 11th, will provide information the Congress and the administration can use to bolster our homeland defenses.
 			</p><p>Let me say that Congress bears some responsibilities in this matter also.  Too often its decisions are met with resistance due to the cost of the burden of the regulated industry.  Many believe that aviation security should have been greatly improved after the bombing of Pan Am 103 in 1988.  Congress enacted stricter security regulations for baggage screening as a result of that tragedy.  However, funding issues and complaints from industry delayed many of those requirements.
 			</p><p>In 1996, in response to the crash of TWA 800, Congress passed several security mandates on the Federal Aviation reauthorization bill.  It took five years, five years, to implement some of these requirements.  The General Accounting Office has pointed to industry resistance and a lack of adequate funding as two significant obstacles to improvements in aviation security.
 			</p><p>I don't necessarily believe that we could have prevented the events of September 11th had Congress acted differently, since the improvements were focused on detecting explosives in baggage. However, time after time, Congress moves in a certain direction only to have its goals obstructed by industry complaints, special interests or the earmarking of funds that divert precious resources to other non-essential programs.  This problem is not industry-specific but covers all issues on which Congress acts.
 			</p><p>Congress has a responsibility to do what it believes is right, even if industry or other interests are opposed.  Once it makes a decision, it must exercise proper oversight and ensure that proper funding is available to carry out our mandate.  On the issue of priorities for the Commission's investigations, I believe no area of inquiry should be off-limits if you would determine it relates to your mandate to pursue a comprehensive investigation into the September 11th attacks.
 			</p><p>I believe there are four specific areas that deserve particular attention from the commission:  The U.S. policy response to terrorism; the rise of al Qaeda; state support for terrorism; and the role of Saudi Arabia.
 			</p><p>An evaluation of the effectiveness of the U.S. response to a series of terrorist attacks against Americans by Islamic extremists over the last two decades is critical if we are to prevail in the coming months and years.  Osama bin Laden himself regularly cited American inaction after devastating attacks on our Marine barracks and on our embassy in Lebanon as inspiration for his cause.  Subsequent kidnappings and assassinations, the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103, the '93 World Trade Center bombings, subsequent planning of massive trans-Pacific hijackings, the 1995 Riyadh and 1996 Khobar Towers bombings of U.S. targets in Saudi Arabia, the 1998 embassy bombings of Kenya and Tanzania, the planned attacks against American interests on the eve of the millennium and the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole all provided a troublingly clear picture, not only of terrorists' intentions but of their ability to significantly damage American interests.
 			</p><p>The role of U.S. policy in responding to these attacks and the ways in which American leaders fail to adequately counter the threat posed by international terrorism should be central areas of inquiry for the commission.  Illustrative questions should include: 
 			</p><ul>
 				<li>Did the tension between law enforcement and military responses to terrorism inhibit our response by focusing on legal outcomes, indictments, prosecutions and convictions rather than focusing on the destruction and defeat of terrorist infrastructure that targeted Americans? 
 				</li><li>Were more active responses to the threat proposed but not implemented because of legal, bureaucratic, diplomatic or other concerns?  How well was the counterterrorist mission incorporated into the planning and operations of our armed forces, our diplomatic service, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies? 
 				</li><li>How was it that a troubled youth from California was able to join the ranks of al Qaeda and meet Osama bin Laden while our intelligence assets could not?
 			</li></ul>
 			<p>It now seems clear that U.S. policy toward Afghanistan in the 1980s and our decision to abandon the region after 1989 played a significant role in the conditions that allowed al Qaeda to flourish. I believe the formative period of al Qaeda, not just its more recent operations, should be thoroughly examined by the Commission.
 			</p><p>Key questions would include what we knew about bin Laden's efforts to build a terrorist training and operational network in the region, al Qaeda's role in Somalia in 1993, the partnership formed between Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar, as well as al Qaeda's ideological development, recruitment practices, networks and eventual operations on at least five continents.
 			</p><p>The question surrounding the nature and extent of foreign government sponsorship and support for al Qaeda and Islamic terrorists bear full examination.  Afghanistan and Sudan, as former bases for Qaeda training and operations, are obvious candidates for inquiry. But so, too, are nations like Iraq under Saddam Hussein, Syria and Iran, whose sponsorship of terrorist organizations known to have collaborated with al Qaeda.  And in Iran's case, its current support of known al Qaeda leaders merits investigating and publicizing.  Finally, the role of Saudi Arabia in the rise of a global terrorist network deeply hostile to America must be a part of this commission's deliberations.  The role of Saudi policy and Saudi money from both official and private sources, including members of the royal family, must be fully investigated and made public.
 			</p><p>Until Saudi Arabia itself was attacked last week, the Saudi leadership and public had clearly failed to acknowledge and learn from the Saudi role in the terrorist attacks of September 2001.  The United States and Saudi Arabia cannot enjoy a normal relationship, much less the relationship of allies, as long as Saudi leaders continue to deny and deceive us about Saudi culpability and the rise of extremist terrorism.  The U.S. government's reluctance to address this issue directly must not extend to your work.
 			</p><p>In retrospect, it's simply remarkable that the United States stood by over two decades, preoccupied by other dangers, challenges and opportunities, as a grave threat to our security formed, grew in strength, expanded in reach and conducted operations against American targets around the world and ultimately attacked our homeland.
 			</p><p>The challenge and the privilege of this Commission is to explain to the American people how and why these developments occurred and what our government can do to provide the greatest degree of security to our people in the face of these threats, consistent with the rights and laws of a free people.
 			</p><p>We will win the war al Qaeda and those whose support it started.  The Commission's investigations and findings will help form our response and will contribute to our ultimate victory.  I'm grateful for your service and look forward to your response to a historic mandate that I hope all elements of our government will actively support.
 			</p><p>I thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you, Senator McCain.   Senator Lieberman.
 			</p><p>SEN. LIEBERMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice Chairman, members of the commission.  I give a special greeting to my former colleagues, Senator Cleland, Senator Gorton and Congressman Roemer.
 			</p><p>It's an honor to be before you along with Congresswoman Pelosi and my dear friend and still straight-talking colleague, the senator from Arizona, here today.
 			</p><p>It was in December of 2001 that John McCain and I first proposed legislation creating this commission.  Our purpose was clear, and we believed non-controversial.  The American people were entitled to a full and unflinching account of how September 11th happened so we could determine what went wrong and prevent it from ever happening again.
 			</p><p>The American people deserve to know the full and objective truth as best it can be determined.  They and we still have not received that, unfortunately.  And until we get it, all the attempts to make America safer in this age of terrorism are bound to be incomplete.
 			</p><p>Today, May 22nd, 2003, the mission of this Commission is clearly more vital than ever.  Within recent days, 75 people have been killed and hundreds more wounded in two terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia and Morocco that appear to have been executed by al Qaeda.  The remaining members of a 19-man al Qaeda cell based in Saudi Arabia, we are told, have fanned out to commit more atrocities.
 			</p><p>And this morning we are greeted by the deadly taped voice of another al Qaeda leader, a voice that perversely invokes the name of God for the purpose of killing God's creations, innocent civilians. As Tom Friedman wrote a while ago in the New York Times, these terrorists hate us more than they love life.
 			</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security has, in response, imposed a heightened Code Orange alert amid rumors of possible attacks on major American cities.  And once again, surface-to-air missiles have been deployed in and around our nation's capital.  The war on terrorism continues.
 			</p><p>Our military victories in Afghanistan and Iraq have struck blows against global terrorism.  I consider these to be victories in battles in the war, but the war clearly goes on.  Neither Osama bin Laden nor Saddam Hussein have been brought to justice.  Al Qaeda is still killing innocent civilians and still seeking weapons of mass destruction.
 			</p><p>That is why our military action abroad must be complemented by an unrelenting and unprecedented commitment to strengthen our defenses here at home.  And I say again that that begins with the search for truth that you are conducting as members of this commission.
 			</p><p>The successful completion of your critical mission cannot occur without the full cooperation of the executive branch of our government.  As Senator McCain has indicated, and I agree, in its initial unwillingness to provide funds that you needed to do your job, and in its failure to facilitate the release of the joint intelligence inquiry report to the public, the administration has not acted constructively.
 			</p><p>The essential mission of this commission deserves and demands more than begrudging cooperation.  You don't have much time.  If you are constantly forced to fight for information, you'll never get to the heart of the problems that plagued and in many cases still plague our government's fight against terrorism.
 			</p><p>I urge you to use every power you have been given by Congress to obtain the information you need to fulfill the mission the law gives you and to call on members of Congress and members of the public to assist you in that quest.
 			</p><p>That's about the search for truth.  Let me talk about the second part of the mission, Mr. Chairman, that you correctly identified, which is to help us by making recommendations about how we can make certain that nothing like September 11th ever happens again in the United States.  And I regret to say that there is still an enormous amount to be done in that regard.  I was pleased to play an active role in the creation of the Department of Homeland Security.  I am confident that if properly led and supported it will help us protect the American people here at home.
 			</p><p>But the resources necessary have not been given to this department yet.  The potential for change and improvement is still there.  Let me cite as examples the fire fighters, police officers and medical emergency professionals in communities across America who are the first to respond to a disaster, and the last to leave, and who can become also the first preventers, because they are out there in enormous numbers everywhere in America, still desperately need proper training, proper communications to allow them to talk to one another in a crisis so they can protect us, and they need personal reinforcements.  Instead, many first responders -- more than half of the communities in America, from one statistic I have seen have been laying off first responders today, because the cities and towns are so fiscally strapped.  That makes about as much sense as reducing America's troop strength in the middle of a conventional war.  Yet, I regret to say that the administration and the majority here in Congress have not adequately funded first responders or the Department of Homeland Security.  There is much more to be done.
 			</p><p>We have made some strides in securing our air travel, that is true. But other forms of transportation remain inadequately protected, and require your consideration.
 			</p><p>Our nation's seaports, I fear, remain an Achilles' heel in our domestic defenses.  Too little cargo is being inspected, and too few containers are being tracked from their port of origin to their final destination.  At the current rate of funding, it will take the Coast Guard 20 years to build the modern fleet it needs to fight terrorism now.  And here again the president's budget under-supports basic physical security at ports for items like perimeter fencing, guards and monitors.
 			</p><p>Our borders remain painfully porous and cry out for the Border Patrol to be beefed up.  But I do want to say that to me perhaps the most significant gap remaining is the one that people can't see, and that is the gap in our intelligence community.  There has been too much reluctance to challenge the status quo in the intelligence community.  The best way to stop terrorism, all the experts agree, is to interrupt the plot before it's executed.  And that can only come from great intelligence.  Today, unfortunately, when it comes to understanding the scope and depth of the intelligence failures that led to September 11th, we simply don't have enough information.
 			</p><p>Too many of the failures that we have already identified remain unchanged today, a full 20 months after the attacks.  And I want to say bluntly it starts at the top.  And today at the top of our intelligence and law enforcement communities there remains too much division, too many of the same bureaucratic barriers that I think contributed to the disaster of September 11th.  And all of the federal agencies continue to keep state and local first responders and first preventers, as I call them, at arm's length, when it really is these front-line forces who have the vital knowledge to share, and most desperately need useful federal intelligence shared with them.
 			</p><p>Mr. Chairman, the bill creating a new Department of Homeland Security established an all-source intelligence center, where all the dots of counterterrorism information were supposed to be for the first time connected.  In the center was, according to the statute, to be placed within the new Department of Homeland Security, reporting directly to the new secretary, and therefore outside the counterproductive and destructive bureaucratic barriers and rivalries that unfortunately have characterized the intelligence and law enforcement communities.
 			</p><p>But I regret to say that the administration has applied an interpretation to what I believe is the clear mandate of the law that produced a different result.  It has created a weak intelligence analysis unit within the department, and a brand-new threat integration center under the command of the director of central intelligence.  That may make the guardians of the status quo happy. But I fear it will not do what is necessary to prevent further terrorism from occurring.
 			</p><p>Let me give you one final example of what remains to be done.  A terrorism watch list is one of the most basic tools for keeping terrorists out of the United States in the first place, and for finding them once they are inside our borders.  We know today of course that two of the hijackers should have been placed on the watch list as long as 20 months before September 11th.  And the CIA has acknowledged a systemic failure and breakdown in this.  Yet this glaring problem as far as I -- but not just I, the General Accounting Office has concluded, has not been fixed yet.  CIA Director Tenet testified to Congress twice in June and October of last year that a national watch list center was being created that would correct the failures and lapses of the past.  As we speak this morning, as best as I can determine, that has not been done yet, and that is unacceptable.  And of course these watch lists, which should be made into a single unified watch list, cannot be hoarded by federal officials if they are going to be valuable, as valuable as they must be.  Today state and local officials remain largely in the dark and out of the loop when it comes to these watch lists.  So I plead with you and I encourage you and, Mr. Chairman, what you have stated as a goal of this Commission in its report, not only to tell us the truth about what happened on September 11th, but to help all of us to take actions that will prevent it from ever happening again.
 			</p><p>These are difficult times for our great country.  I personally find more insecurity among the American people about more things than I have found ever in my adult lifetime.  These times demand that we look honestly at our failures, and correct those failures without hesitation.  They demand that officials and employees of our government, who have been charged with critical national security responsibilities, be held personally accountable if they have failed or faltered in their duties.  All that has become now the historic mission of the members of this commission.  It is through the work of this commission that America can best provide our people with the security that is their basic right and our government's most basic responsibility.
 			</p><p>And I would say finally, having seen some of the survivors and family members of those who were lost on September 11th, who I know you have been good and wise enough to talk to and work with -- so many words of condolence and sympathy have been expressed to them, which they deserve.  Memorials will be built to their loved ones who were lost on September 11th.  But I can't state strongly enough that I believe that the best memorial to those we lost on September 11th can and must come from the work that you do in searching for the truth and helping us make sure that those dead in fact did not die in vain.
 			</p><p>I thank you for your service, and I pray that God will strengthen and guide you in the work that you do.  As usual, Scripture provides the best counsel, which is that the truth once again will make us free -- in this case free from fear.  Thank you very much.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Senator Lieberman, thank you very, very much.  Do any members of the panels have -- Tim?
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER:  Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank my colleagues, my former colleagues, Representative Pelosi, Senator McCain, Senator Lieberman, for their hard work in creating, along with the families, this commission, to do the hard work of trying to make sure we get the truth and the answers to try to prevent or mitigate the next attack.  And we know al Qaeda is coming.  I know the next panel, with former colleagues -- I see a couple of them here -- Senator Shelby and Jane Harman and others -- did the hard work of the Joint Inquiry to try to give us recommendations and put them hopefully into law that will help protect the country as well.  And I would just say, Mr. Chairman, in thanking our colleagues, that 12 months from now, when we make recommendations -- whether they are comprehensive to intelligence or FAA, or Border Patrol, or foreign policy -- we very much look forward to working with you to hopefully implement successfully those recommendations, and we look forward to working with you very much.  Thank you again for our very helpful testimony this morning.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Senator Cleland.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND:  Yes, sir.  Thank you very much.  It's great to see my two former colleagues with whom I was pleased to co-sponsor the legislation to create this commission to take a powerful, incisive look at what happened and why so we don't have to repeat these mistakes again.  My father served at Pearl Harbor after the attack, so an attack on this nation has had a powerful impact upon my own family. It is now an opportunity for me to be of further service.
 			</p><p>I will say that as recently as this morning's articles in the New York Times, my sense of security continues to be lessened.  We are under an orange threat nationwide.  We have pursued wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  But the real war continues.  Senator McCain, one of the chilling thoughts that I came across when we were together in Vietnam was in terms of fighting guerrillas and suicide bombers and the like.  Walter Lippmann said the battles we fight we win, but the battles we fight can't win the war.  We have won some wars, in Afghanistan and Iraq.  But those are battles, as Senator Lieberman says.
 			</p><p>    But it seems the real war is against a global network of terrorists, primarily led by al Qaeda in the Middle East.  And what bothers me is that we still are grappling with the same problems we grappled with September 11th.  For instance, the New York Times now reports today pre-war views of Iraq threat are under review by the CIA, raising the question as to whether or not we had, duh, adequate intelligence to go to war.  We went to war.  Now, did we have the adequate intelligence?  Were we right?  Where are the weapons of mass destruction?
 			</p><p>Secondly, al Qaeda, duh, continues its own -- at its own pace: "New Tape Linked to Bin Laden Aide Urges More Attacks."  This is today.  This is 20 months after September the 11th.  It does seem to me, and I'd like for both of you to comment, that this Commission better get on with its business that you articulated so forcefully in your legislation, and that the sooner the better we come to terms with connecting the dots, improving the intelligence capability of this country, so that when we go to war somewhere, we don't have to look back and say, "did we have the right intelligence?  Did we not connect the dots?  Where's the Pentagon?  Where's the NSA?  Where's the FBI? Where's the CIA?" 
 			</p><p>It always bothered when I was spending six years with both of you on the Senate Armed Services Committee that the intelligence community was referred to as the intelligence community.  I never really understood who was in charge.  Apparently now no one is in charge.  It's a horse built by a committee winds up being a camel.  We still have the camel out there and the various humps trying to talk to one another, trying to figure out who's right, who's wrong, were we right, were we wrong in going to war.
 			</p><p>So this troubles me tremendously, and I would like for both of you to comment on the urgency of this panel to get on with this business and carry the American public along, so that we don't live constantly in fear.  Senator McCain?
 			</p><p>SEN. MCCAIN:  It's hard for me to elaborate on what you just said.  It's very articulate, and as you say, evidence grows daily that the threat is substantial, real and we still have not sufficient information, I think, to make the national security decisions -- and frankly the financial decisions.  I don't mean to digress, but when we are looking at a 300 to 400 billion dollar deficit just this year, there will be enormous efforts at some point for fiscal restraint. And then it would be even more difficult to set priorities.  And    that's why I think we have to look to this Commission to give us those priorities.  We are not going to have the money to address every single security threat to the United States of America. It is just not possible.  And certainly even if it was possible we couldn't do it all at once.  And that's why I emphasize that the importance of this committee, in not only giving us the information, but also helping us establish priorities that would guide the administration and Congress in our future actions to counter what I think we all agree is a long-term struggle.  I thank you, Senator Cleland.
 			</p><p>SEN. LIEBERMAN:  Mr. Chairman, very briefly, I thank Senator Cleland.  I agree with everything that Senator McCain has said in response.  I mean, you're in a very difficult and demanding position, because unlike most commissions of this kind which examine events that are in the past, you are examining an event that is in the past, but your work relates directly to our ability to successfully wage and win an ongoing war against terrorism, and to secure our people in the midst of that war.  So you have a very difficult but critically important mission.
 			</p><p>I said during my remarks -- I'll just say it again -- I do think that the intelligence committee, some of whose leaders you are going to hear soon, have done some very important work. I do think it's critically important that you continue that and be persistent, and just go where the search for truth takes you.  Because everybody will tell you of course that in this, to use a homely phrase, in the war against terrorism the best defense is an offense, that we ought not to accept the inevitability of another September 11th.  And by that I mean something as large, well planned that touched public and private entities so much before it was actually carried out.  And the best way to do that, the offense I'm talking about, of course, is an intelligence network working on our behalf that is so aggressive and pervasive that to the extent humanly possible it sees the threats and stops them before they are executed.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Congressman Hamilton.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON:  Mr. Chairman, I know you want to move on, and I know the two senators have much on their plate.  I want to say three things.  First of all, a word of very deep gratitude to the two of you and to Congresswoman Pelosi.  We would not have this commission without you.  Number two, we would not have the funding that we have without your support.  And, number three, we would not have the access we have so far obtained to documents and people without your strong words of support and encouragement.  We are going to need that as we proceed.
 			</p><p>The second thing I want to say is that the Joint Inquiry did some very good work, and I think the members of the Senate and the House can be very proud of that work.  We want to build on the work that they did.  I notice two of their members are here now, maybe more, and we will be hearing from them very shortly.  But I am very grateful for the work of the Joint Inquiry, and it will be extremely important to the work of this commission.  And, finally, one of the tasks you gave us is to make recommendations with regard to congressional oversight of the intelligence community.  I've worked on that for about 30 years without much success, and we are going to need some guidance here as to what we can do that will be constructive and helpful to improve the quality of this oversight.
 			</p><p>But we will be coming back to you again and again in the weeks ahead, and we are most grateful to you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you very much, Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman.  
 
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Okay, if we could -- our second panel is here, and we're focusing now on congressional oversight of the intelligence community and congressional joint inquiries investigation into the intelligence community's performance prior to September 11th.  The joint inquiry was obviously a logical place for us to start.  The legislation under which the Commission operates specifically charges it with reviewing the process by which Congress oversees its intelligence agencies and allocates its resources.  And actually from the founding days, I guess, of our republic, congressional oversight has been central to the effective functioning of our government. The subject has never been more important than it is in the aftermath of September 11th.  
 			</p><p>No less authority on government than professor and future president Woodrow Wilson wrote toward the end of the 19th century that Congress's vigilant oversight of administration was more important than any of its other roles, including the passing of legislation. And actually, our esteemed vice chairman, Lee Hamilton, said recently that Congress must do more than write the laws.  We must make sure the administration is carrying out those laws the way Congress intended.
 			</p><p>The Joint Inquiry spent considerable time and effort reviewing the intelligence community's performance concerning the September 11th attacks.  We intend to build on that work, using its documented findings.  We will also look at the Congress in the coming months, and we'll be exploring such issues as the overall effectiveness of congressional oversight, of intelligence, how effective is it, how might it be improved, and how can the Congress avoid micromanaging the intelligence agencies.  
 			</p><p>The current structure of intelligence oversight by two select committees with rotating membership -- and if we were starting again, would we really design it that way?  Given that our nation's form of government is best served by congressional activity that takes place in public, how can Congress oversee the intelligence agencies while guarding our country's secrets?   Finally, did Congress allocate sufficient funds for the intelligence community to really conduct a fight on terrorism?  Our second panel will help guide us through all these things.  It consists of current and former leaders of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Commission on Intelligence.
 			</p><p>With us today are Senators Richard Shelby of Alabama, Senator Bob Graham of Florida, Representative Porter Goss, also of Florida, and Representative Jane Harman of California.  And we're going to begin with Senator Shelby.
 			</p><p>SEN. RICHARD SHELBY (R-AL):  Thank you, Governor Kean.  
 			</p><p>Governor Kean, Representative Hamilton, and distinguished commissioners, it's a pleasure to come before you this morning to discuss what our nation did to prepare itself prior to the September the 11th terrorist attacks, and how our nation can be better prepared for such threats in the future.  I thank you for giving me the opportunity to say a few words specifically about the role of Congress prior to September the 11th.  With your permission, I will give an abbreviated version of my statement, and ask that my full statement be made part of the record, Governor.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Granted.  Thank you.
 			</p><p>SEN. SHELBY:  During our joint inquiry last year, defenders of the intelligence community's performance during the Clinton administration and prior to September the 11th, insinuated that it was really the fault of Congress that the intelligence community failed to detect and deter the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  One senior FBI agent, for instance, publicly complained about how little money his counterterrorism division had been given by Congress -- amounts far less than those that they had requested and felt was necessary.  
 			</p><p>Unfortunately, a surprising number of my colleagues in Congress seemed to give credence to the suggestion that September the 11th was in some way our fault.  I have at times been a harsh and I believe a constructive critic of the intelligence community.  I have never asserted, however, that the attacks of September the 11th were anyone's fault other than the murderous group of thugs that hijacked and crashed those planes into the symbols of American military and economic power.  We should all keep that in mind as we search for the truth here.  
 			</p><p>The truth is that the same FBI agent that I alluded to admitted to us privately later the same day, after the cameras had been turned off, that for several years Congress had met or exceeded administration budget requests for counterterrorism.  The FBI agent who said in public that we had deprived him of special agents to fight terrorism, conceded in private that Congress had actually helped his division tremendously.  In fact, we had added -- yes, added -- counterterrorism agents beyond the administration's request in the years 1996, '97, '98, '99, 2001, and 2002.    Similarly, though CIA counterterrorism officials publicly complained about tight budgets in our public hearings, their agency's own figures showed that Congress had met or exceeded budget requests for the Counter-Terrorism Center, or CTC, in '94, '95, '96, '97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001, and 2002.  In fact, in 2001, the CIA, prior to September the 11th, was reporting that it would not spend all of its counterterrorism funds.  Although Congress fully funded the administration's request for the CTC that year, the CIA was not going to spend tens of millions of dollars in Director Tenet's declared war on al Qaeda.  The picture changed dramatically after September the 11th.
 			</p><p>I don't mean to say here today that this nation's counterterrorism efforts and the U.S. intelligence community as a whole necessarily got all the money they needed before September the 11th, 2001.  In many areas, they did not.  There are, however, many bureaucratic steps between the development of a counterterrorism budget within the FBI, or a CTC budget within the CIA, and a final administration budget request from the Office of Management and Budget.  What goes in does not often look like anything that comes out.  I suspect that the intelligence agencies probably did request far more funding than they ended up getting -- agencies always do.  My point is that it is not accurate to lay the community's budget problems at the feet of Congress, particularly because we have emphasized counterterrorism and counter-intelligence as fundamental policy priorities for years.
 			</p><p>During my tenure as chairman of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee on Intelligence, I explicitly made counterterrorism and counter-intelligence two of the five highest priorities of the intelligence committee.  I and my colleagues worked long and hard to ensure that these programs got ever-expanding levels of support during the late '90s, support which was critical in order to help pull the community out of its post-Cold War funding slump.
 			</p><p>While I was a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, we took aggressive steps to address what were becoming very clear indications of fundamental weaknesses in our ability to attack the terrorist target.  Many of the conclusions that were reached by the joint inquiry were conclusions that had already been reached by the intelligence oversight committees prior to September the 11th.  I encourage you, this commission, to examine closely the unclassified and classified authorization bills of both the House and Senate committees in the years leading up to September the 11th that I've enumerated.  
 			</p><p>For example, terrorism and our ability to combat it was listed as one of the Senate Intelligence Committee's highest priorities in every one of our bills, at least since 1996.  In 1998, the committee revealed that the FBI was failing to address significant technological challenges that were degrading its ability to track the terrorist target.  We highlighted serious FBI-wide deficiencies in information technology, modernization, and the absence of a plan even to address it.  We provided significant additional funding to augment the Bureau's ability to analyze terrorism intelligence and train its agents.  We warned of a critical shortage of language skills, including Arabic and Farsi, and directed the FBI to review its language recruiting efforts in the bill.  The committee also worked consistently to remove restrictions that unnecessarily hindered our ability to collect terrorism information.  Often, these efforts were met with resistance from the Director of Central Intelligence himself. 
 			</p><p>Prior to September the 11th, we amended the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act on three separate occasions to grant new authorities to the attorney general and the FBI to collect terrorism-related intelligence.  Working with our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, we detailed serious problems in information sharing between intelligence agencies and law enforcement organizations, including our inability to track foreign students after they entered the United States.  In 1997, the committee registered its concern that no comprehensive intelligence community estimate existed on present and emerging terrorist threats, or other non-traditional attacks on the United States, using weapons of mass destruction.  That was the year 1997.  We directed the Director of Central Intelligence to produce such an estimate.
 			</p><p>Finally, the committee has worked since 1990 to effect structural and organizational changes within the community.  For example, the final report of the Joint Inquiry recommends the creation of a single authority that would be accountable for the success or failure of the intelligence community, and that would have the statutory and budgetary authority to lead the community.  In 1996, the Senate Intelligence Committee voted out the Intelligence Activities Renewal and Reform Act of '96, which gave the DCI these important statutory and budgetary authorities.  Unfortunately, it became a bridge too far and was never passed into law.
 			</p><p>In that same year, we created three Senate-confirmable positions within the community -- management staff to address community-wide problems with coordination on collection, analysis and production issues.  The intent was to give the DCI additional high-visibility managers to help him manage the intelligence community.  After the community's failure to predict the Indian nuclear tests, the need for these positions and the coordination they would foster was apparent. To this day, the Director of Central Intelligence refuses to comply with the law and submit names for consideration by the United States Senate.
 			</p><p>These are just a few examples of congressional actions, and I encourage the Commission to review the entire record, classified and unclassified.  I believe you will find it to be quite extensive.  
 			</p><p>I've mentioned our efforts to increase funding for counterterrorism.  As I said, this was a consistent theme, at least while I was chairman, and it continued under Chairman Graham.  I wish to emphasize, however, that the performance of the intelligence community is only partly a story of resources.  Money helps purchase technical systems and recruit large numbers of case officers, but you can't buy energy, enthusiasm, pride, professionalism, and aggressiveness.  You can't purchase a commitment to share information with other agencies and pull together as a team in order to protect Americans from threats to their lives and well-being.  You can't authorize and appropriate proper priorities, sensible management, and a vision of how to adapt complicated organizations to rapidly changing threats.  You can't simply fund an appreciation of the information technology and the absolute necessity to integrate it into what is essentially an information enterprise.  
 			</p><p>All these things have to be grown and nourished over time by wise and steady leadership.  Congress can encourage these things, and they should.  And we have certainly tried, but the legislature merely conducts oversight.  We do not and should not, I believe, direct the operational activities of our intelligence agencies.  We do not decide why someone gets promoted or punished.  We can legislate, but there is little we can do to compel compliance.
 			</p><p>As you examine the record, you will discover numerous examples of complete disregard for congressional direction, not to mention the law.  While we do have the power of the purse, it often presents a Hobbsian choice.   Does one cut funds to compel compliance, when the cut will probably degrade the very capability one is seeking to foster, to bring about? More often than not, the answer is no.    Each branch of government serves a very distinct, necessary function.  While Congress oversees the intelligence activities of the U.S., ultimately, the intelligence community is led and run by the Director of Central Intelligence, who deserves most of the credit or blame for the decisions he makes and the results that he produces.
 			</p><p>The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks is a great responsibility and a daunting job to do.  It is your responsibility to survey the whole range of government activity relevant to how well-prepared our nation was or was not for the modern terrorist threat.
 			</p><p>I have spoken today principally about intelligence matters, for they have been an abiding interest and a great concern of mine since I first became chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in '97.  The U.S. government's management of homeland security, however, implicates a broad array of federal activity.
 			</p><p>Consequently, you may need to come to grips with bigger issues of congressional organization and committee jurisdiction.  The House and the Senate have adopted very different organizational approaches to the challenges of homeland security.  My successor as the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Chairman Pat Roberts, has spoken repeatedly about the management and policy coordination problems we face in the Senate because of our many overlapping committee jurisdictions related to homeland security issues.
 			</p><p>These are matters which the Commission may end up having to speak on as well.  In the months ahead I hope you will be able to build constructively on what we accomplished last year during our Joint Inquiry.  Some of us have already issued detailed public analyses of the intelligence failures prior to September the 11th, and I imagine you probably now also have access to the classified final report of our two committees and to the substantial investigative record that we compiled.
 			</p><p>I believe our work can provide you with important insights into the problems that we identified and into ways to ensure that Americans are better protected in the future.
 			</p><p>I thank you for inviting me here today.  I wish you all the success in your inquiry.  Thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you, Senator Shelby.  Senator Graham.  
 			</p><p>SEN. GRAHAM:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, would like to submit a full statement for the record and try to summarize it this morning.  And I appreciate the opportunity that you have afforded us to come before this very important commission.
 			</p><p>I want to begin by commending each of you for having accepted this responsibility.  I know something of the commitment that this is going to require in order to achieve the result of giving to the American people a full accounting of what happened prior to September 11th, your recommendations of what should happen now in order to reduce the possibility of a repetition of September 11th.
 			</p><p>With other members of this panel, I supported the creation of this commission because I thought the American people deserved answers to those two questions.  I also recognize that our congressional joint inquiry focused on those matters that were within the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Committee.  I recognize that there are much broader arrays of federal agencies which could have played a role in this issue, everything from aviation security to the issuance of visas at overseas U.S. State Department embassies or consulates.
 			</p><p>But I do believe the Joint Inquiry's final report gives you a solid foundation upon which to begin your investigation.  I'm extremely proud of the hard work that was done by 37 members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.  They served on the joint inquiry with great distinction, including your member, former Congressman Tim Roemer.
 			</p><p>I'm also proud of the dedication and skill of the special team of investigators hired to conduct the joint inquiry, led by the very capable Ms. Eleanor Hill, who is with us today.  The staff reviewed nearly half a million pages of documents and interviewed 300 people. The committees held 22 hearings, nine open to the public, 13 closed. Our final report is more than 800 pages.
 			</p><p>The report was adopted by each committee on December 10th of 2002 and filed with the House and Senate on December 20th.  I'm sad to report that the final report, 153 days after it was filed, remains classified.  All of us are extremely frustrated that the declassification process is taking so long.
 			</p><p>We are hopeful that we'll be able to soon provide the American people with all of the report but those portions that are determined to address genuine national security concerns.  In the meantime, we have released summary findings and recommendations, a number of which this panel will speak to.
 			</p><p>Several of the recommendations focused on activities within the intelligence community that were ongoing at the time we completed our report.  One of the tasks of your commission is keeping track of those recommendations so that the American people are assured that our government is following through on necessary reforms.  Let me mention three of the recommendations which I would particularly call your attention to for purposes of ongoing oversight. First is recommendation number six, and I quote in part.  Quote: "Given the FBI's record of repeated shortcomings within its current responsibility for domestic intelligence in the face of grave and immediate threats to our homeland, the FBI should strengthen and improve its domestic capability as fully and expeditiously as possible."
 			</p><p>We then offered 10 specific steps, including, "clearly designating national counterterrorism priorities and enforcing field office adherence to those priorities."
 			</p><p>Mr. Chairman, I wish that I could tell you that the FBI has adopted our recommendations and moving towards their implementation. Congressman Goss and I wrote to Director Robert Mueller on January the 29th, 2003, and again on April 2nd, 2003, and asked him to tell us what steps the Bureau has taken and whether legislation is required to fully implement our recommendations.  We are still waiting for a response.
 			</p><p>The second recommendation is number 15.  Again, I quote in part: "The President should review and consider amendments to executive orders, policies and procedures that govern the national security classification of intelligence information in order to expand access to relevant information for federal agencies outside the intelligence community for state and local authorities which are critical to the fight against terrorism and for the American people.  Congress should also review the statutes, policies and procedures that govern the national security classification of intelligence information and its protection from unauthorized disclosure."
 			</p><p>The report from the director of national intelligence should include proposals to protect against the use of the classification process as a shield to protect agency self-interest.
 			</p><p>The third recommendation which I would call to your attention is number 19, which offers fertile ground for additional investigation. It reads as follows:  "The intelligence community, and particularly the FBI and the CIA, should aggressively address the possibility that foreign governments are providing support to or are involved in terrorist activities targeting the United States and United States interests.  State-sponsored terrorism substantially increases the likelihood of successful and more lethal attacks within the United States.  This issue must be addressed from a national standpoint and should not be limited in focus to the geographical and factual boundaries of the individual case."
 			</p><p>Continuing the quotation:  "The FBI and CIA should aggressively and thoroughly pursue related matters developed through this joint inquiry that have been referred to them for further investigation by these committees."  Mr. Chairman, because of classification, I cannot discuss in this public forum the specifics of the Joint Inquiry's findings in this area, even to identify any individual foreign governments.  However, there have been several developments since September the 11th and even since the completion of the Joint Inquiry's report on December 10th, 2002, which have been publicly reported and which cause me grave concern.
 			</p><p>Clearly al Qaeda is reconstituting itself, as we have seen by the bombings in places like Yemen, Indonesia, and most recently Saudi Arabia and possibly also Chechnya and Morocco. At the same time, it is disturbingly apparent that some foreign governments are supporting or at the very least providing sanctuary for terrorist networks.
 			</p><p>Within the last 30 days, Secretary Powell and Secretary Rumsfeld have met with the highest officials of Syria. They have brought, in the firmest manner, to the attention of the Syrians our knowledge, among others, to the sanctuary that has been provided for Hezbollah by that country. And we have called upon Syria to accept the responsibility for retreating from this position of sanctuary.
 			</p><p>As another example, I would like to submit for the record three recent news articles that raise questions about the government of Saudi Arabia and its apparent tolerance of individuals and groups with terrorist ties. First is a report from the Washington Post of May 19th that munitions from the Saudi National Guard may have been used by suspected al Qaeda operatives in last week's bombings that killed nearly three dozen innocent people in Riyadh, including nine Americans.
 			</p><p>Second is a May 10th story from the Los Angeles Times that reports a Saudi consular official was denied re-entry into the United States because of his suspected links to terrorists. It's important to note that this same individual had been employed at the Saudi consulate in California from 1996 until early in the year 2003.
 			</p><p>The third is an article from the May 5th issue of
 Newsweek which says that a top-ranking Saudi diplomat in Berlin is
 suspected of providing embassy funds to followers of Osama bin
 Laden. I want to emphasize again that these articles deal with
 events subsequent to the filing of the Joint Inquiry's final
 report, but they raise issues that are especially appropriate for
 this commission's review.
 			</p><p>This commission, in my judgment, should vigorously pursue
 the links between foreign governments and the September the 11th
 hijackers. I am troubled by the lack of attention that to date
 has been given to this critical aspect of the 9/11 investigation.
 			</p><p>Ignoring facts simply because they make some people
 uncomfortable or because they might stand in the way of short-term
 policy goals will prevent Americans from learning the full truth
 about 9/11 and thereby mitigating the possibility that future
 terrorist attacks can be avoided. Only a full and honest
 accounting will help us provide a safer and more secure world for
 our children and grandchildren. Mr. Chairman, you asked us also
 to comment on recommendations for improving congressional
 oversight of the intelligence committee. I would make five
 recommendations.
 			</p><p>One, membership on the House and Senate Intelligence
 Committees should be made permanent. There is, of course, an
 argument that members of the Oversight Committee could become
 captives of the Intelligence Committee. It was on this rationale
 that the term limits were imposed on members of the Intelligence
 Committee.
 			</p><p>But the counterargument, which I find persuasive, is that
 it takes so much time to understand the complexities of today's
 sophisticated programs and the increasing number of countries and
 organizations to which we are directing our intelligence
 capability that members need the expertise of time, of service, in
 order to thoroughly monitor our intelligence agencies'
 performance.
 			</p><p>Two, create within the congressional appropriations
 process a separate subcommittee for intelligence, much as has been
 done for the new Department of Homeland Security. If that means
 declassifying the top line of the intelligence budget, so be it.
 Director George Tenet has told me that he would support this
 approach.
 			</p><p>Three, establish a closer linkage between the financial
 reporting of the intelligence agencies and the Oversight
 Committee. During my tenure on the committee, I found it very
 frustrating to be repeatedly told that the agencies were virtually
 non-auditable because of the state of their basic accounting
 systems.
 			</p><p>Four, adopt what has come to be known as the Eleanor Hill
 approach to oversight, which means that staff should be given more
 authority to conduct detailed reviews under the direction of the
 chairman and vice chairman of the committee. Then, at the start
 of a hearing, the staff would present its findings to help frame
 the issues and outline the points of contention. Witnesses would
 then speak to those findings. I found this to be a highly
 efficient, productive use of the committee's time.
 			</p><p>Five, and finally, make it a practice to seek testimony
 from witnesses outside the administration, experts from the
 academic community, think tanks and other sources whose views can
 provide an alternative to the official administration perspective.
 			</p><p>Mr. Chairman, let me conclude again by thanking you and
 each member of this commission for your service and your
 dedication. It is fair to say that each of you has enlisted as a
 soldier in the war against terrorism. I will be ready to answer
 any questions that you might have today and assist you in any way
 that might be helpful in the weeks and months to come. Thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you, Congressman. Congressman Goss.
 			</p><p>REP. GOSS: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Vice
 Chairman, distinguished members of the commission. We are advised
 that we are going to have House votes at approximately 11:00 to
 11:30, so if we get interrupted, I hope we have your
 understanding.
 			</p><p>Much of my prepared statement echoes and underscores
 remarks that have been made by our distinguished leaders on the
 Senate side in our joint investigation, Senator Graham and Senator
 Shelby. Consequently, I would ask that you accept my prepared
 remarks, hopefully review them. We spent some time on them. And
 I would like to try and offer instead some helpful observations
 and views and talk a little bit more about the recommendations
 that Senator Graham has just discussed.
 			</p><p>First of all, I do feel that the national security
 requirement that we have requires that much of intelligence work
 that is done by the Intelligence Committees, which we represent,
 has to be done behind closed doors. As a result, our mission is
 probably not very well understood by many Americans, and while we
 have tried to explain it, it is not an easy sell.
 			</p><p>While we serve as the principal advocates for
 strengthening the nation's intelligence capabilities -- this is
 where you get your authorization and which leads to your money for
 intelligence -- we must also provide meaningful oversight of the
 intelligence community. Obviously they have to play by the rules
 and stay in bounds. That appears to be a tension. Actually, it's
 a healthy competition, I think. There are some 15 agencies, as
 you know, actually in the intelligence community. That means we
 are dealing with some half dozen Cabinet-level secretaries and
 very high-level directors of individual agencies. It is a very
 big chore, and we are instructed to look over, without
 overlooking, all the activities of those people and their
 departments as they apply to intelligence. We in fact have taken
 on the position of the 1-800 number that you call for those who
 are seeking additional intelligence resources, and also for those
 who want to report alleged abuses within the intelligence
 community system. I am happy to report we get more 1-800 calls
 asking for money than we do reporting abuses.
 			</p><p>The second thing I'd like to say is that we have tried to
 be as public as possible in going about our oversight work. It's
 hard, and we certainly tried to be as public as possible in our
 joint inquiry. As has been said, stated, I think nine of our 22
 meetings were open meetings, and we tried to include the public in
 a meaningful way and get public input.
 			</p><p>We have problems, of course. We are charged with the
 responsibility of not revealing sources and methods, and we need
 them more intensely now than we perhaps at any time in recent past
 in terms of our national security needs. We have a requirement
 not to contaminate any ongoing investigations or prosecutions by
 law enforcement people, whether state, federal or local. But we
 have to handle information very closely on that. We have
 arrangements with other foreign governments on sensitive matters -
 - exchange of information that we have to be careful that
 something that may not seem quite so sensitive to us is in fact
 very delicate in their country. All of those kinds of
 considerations create a legitimacy to actually having some
 classified information. But, equally, there cannot be abuse of
 classification because there is some legitimacy for
 classification. And I think that is an area that has recently
 come into some focus.
 			</p><p>I would like to take a brief snapshot of what the House
 oversight committee has focused on in the past few months, and
 tell you the classification process has become such a chore, and
 appears to me to be so dysfunctional that we are taking that on as
 a main piece of business for our oversight committee to deal with.
 Senator Moynihan led the way with some changes in the
 declassification program. I was pleased to be associated with him
 with that. That was one of his last pieces of legislation. But
 it didn't go anywhere far enough, and it pointed out a problem
 that we have -- not only not enough capability to declassify when
 we should; we overclassify very badly. There's a lot of
 gratuitous classification going on, and there are a variety of
 reasons for them. They are not all sinister by any means.
 			</p><p>We have discovered in trying to deal with getting our
 report out, which we are all anxious to do, because we are all
 very proud of our report, what the process is. And basically you
 have to understand that the first question you ask is, is this
 material classified? And then you get to the second question --
 is, Should this material be classified? And then the third
 question is, How can we change it if we think it should be out
 there? And the processes of changing it are very difficult, and
 it depends on who agrees whether it should be declassified or not.
 			</p><p>While this is easy to say in a few sentences, it is very
 hard to explain when you get into the details. It is a sufficient
 problem that we will be taking it up.
 			</p><p>The second area I wanted to bring up was the type of
 thing that we are doing which I hope will be instructive and
 helpful for you happens to be, serendipitously I presume, reported
 by James Risen in the New York Times. It's amazing how often that
 happens that something we are talking about in committee
 serendipitously shows up on the front page of the New York Times.
 This is not a classified matter, however. We believe that good
 decisions were made on the best possible information coming from
 the intelligence community about value-added analysis on weapons
 of mass destruction in Iraq, a very important point obviously. I
 think the time has come to find out whether or not, as we discover
 more and more about what actually happened in Iraq, as the doors
 are opening and we are finding documents to exploit and people to
 talk to, how good were those judgments, how good was the value
 added, how well does our analytical community perform, and what
 problems are there?
 			</p><p>So I would say that we are proceeding in our committees
 to do the work that the American people are asking us to do on
 timely matters. But it is a whole lot more complicated in trying
 to do our job than, "Where is UBL, why haven't we caught him?
 Where is Saddam? Why haven't we caught him? Where are these
 weapons of mass destruction?" And the way I characterize it is the
 fog of war is very hard to comprehend, even with CNN there. The
 fog of peace is much harder to comprehend, because there is so
 much going on everywhere, and we are not sure which may be the
 most important thing to focus on.
 			</p><p>I want to emphasize that there is a problem, and I hope
 you will address it. The program we oversee is called the
 national foreign intelligence program. Let me say that again: It
 is the national foreign intelligence program. The reason I say
 that, back in 1947, when we decided to have oversight, and
 formalize this arrangement a little bit, have the National
 Security Act, the leaders in the wise salons of that day did in
 fact contemplate the question of domestic intelligence, and they
 specifically rejected it. It is the foreign intelligence program.
 Spying is not permitted by Americans on America in the United
 States of America, or on Americans overseas by American
 organizations. That's how it is. There have been problems over
 the years. Our society has evolved. We've had events take place.
 Matters have come to the attention of Congress. We had the Church
 Commission, the Pike Commission, and then we've had other actions
 as well many of you are familiar with.
 			</p><p>The long and the short of it is being reinforced time and
 time again that Americans do not spy on Americans. This leaves us
 in today's world without much of a domestic intelligence agency.
 Now, that is a very good thing from the perspective of our civil
 liberties. Whether it is a very good thing from the perspective of
 our national security is a question that I hope you are seriously
 going to address.
 			</p><p>The next thing I wanted to point out, as we went through
 our joint inquiry I find that this was a much more labor-intensive
 task than I could ever have imagined. And to have the services of
 Eleanor Hill and Rick Siccagranna (ph) and the others, and Brett
 Schneider, who started off assembling the staff. These are people
 who did brilliant work for us. They had a couple of dozen people
 who labored very, very long hours with difficult matters --
 traveled all kinds of places. And even so we only touched a small
 bit. A half a million pages of documents is not a small bit, but
 in the sum of the things in the world, it actually is. And
 talking to five or six hundred people is helpful, but it's not all
 the people you need to talk to.
 			</p><p>I would suggest that you are going to need to understand
 how labor intensive this in your work, and I offer that as a
 constructive suggestion.
 			</p><p>With regard to protection of liberties, something has
 happened recently I hope you will also opine on, and that is we
 have created the TTIC, Terrorist Threat Integration Center of
 information. Now this is a wonderful thing. I think I understand
 how it's supposed to work, and we are dealing with terrorists on a
 priority basis. But understand here by putting TTIC under the CIA
 we are talking about the integration and analysis of value-added,
 hopefully, intelligence on combining foreign and domestic
 information under an agency that is chartered to work in a
 national foreign intelligence program. It's an interesting
 conundrum for us. Does it really matter? No. What matters is
 that we protect ourselves. But we are slipping over that line
 here in some people's eyes. The TTIC really shouldn't be in CIA.
 It really ought to be in the FBI or a separate agency or have
 different accountability. Those are the kinds of management
 questions we are now dealing with as a we deal with the
 capabilities to deal with the threats as they exist today, matched
 against the vulnerabilities which the Department of Homeland
 Security is very wisely pointing out to us are the highest
 vulnerabilities that we must protect against.
 			</p><p>In the areas of what might be considered recommendations,
 first of all I hope you will take a look at our work. I know that
 access is difficult. We have made the access available. I
 apologize for the inconvenience of having to come to the Ford
 Annex. I have spent far too many hours in the Ford Annex of an
 otherwise useful life. It's really somewhat unpleasant there.
 Think of the poor staff who have labored there. We only ask you
 there to come for a short time to read the report, and soon you
 will have your own copy. I hope that will be within the next
 month.
 			</p><p>Secondly, with regard to areas to go, I very much
 endorse Senator Graham's views that congressional oversight is an
 area that screams for your attention. Obviously we could not do
 all we should have done on congressional oversight. I think
 there's great questions. I think changes in the length of time
 and how we deal with this in the House are very important matters
 for you to take up, and I think you are perfectly positioned to do
 that, and I would be very happy to assist in any way I could on
 that.
 			</p><p>The other area that I think is very important is to
 understand that our report really stopped doing active
 investigation at the end of last year. Time has passed, many
 things have happened, and we don't pretend to be able to connect
 those things in a coherent way. That really is for you.
 			</p><p>And the third area that I would hope is that you would
 look is following up what I will call gaps. It's not just the
 update of what we didn't get. It's the things that weren't in our
 portfolio of intelligence, because there's a whole bunch of
 regulatory agencies there, a whole bunch of people charged with
 responsibility to deal with quality of life and safety matters for
 the American public on the homeland that we didn't touch, and that
 do need to be touched. And so I certainly hope that you would go
 there.
 			</p><p>I think that completes the main points I wanted to say. I
 very much look forward to the work of the commission. I want to
 be as helpful as I can, and our committee is going to continue to
 be functional and operational, and I suspect we will be talking to
 each other regularly, and I hope that indeed is the case. I thank
 you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you, Congressman Goss. Congresswoman
 Harman?
 			</p><p>REP. HARMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We have votes
 shortly, and I am determined to stop speaking before the green
 light changes to yellow, so I will be brief. But I do want to
 confess great admiration and affection for my former colleagues on
 your panel, Lee Hamilton and Tim Roemer. In fact, I believe I
 played somewhat of a godmother role in the formation of this
 commission. I remember a one a.m. conversation with Tim on the
 House floor about whether to support it in its revised form in the
 House. I am glad we did, and I am glad he's there. I also have
 many other good friends on your panel.
 			</p><p>The witnesses who have testified before you, as you well
 know, are enormously qualified to be here, and they are all good
 colleagues. And on a bipartisan basis, all of us are very
 interested in helping you succeed.
 			</p><p>And, finally, I just want to say something about the
 families in the audience. I've seen their faces many times when I
 sat where you sat as part of the public part of the joint inquiry.
 They are here again -- incredible courage, incredible
 determination. I think if those faces had not been there, I am
 not sure we would have had the commission. So I want to add to
 what others have said, my enormous admiration for them.
 			</p><p>And, last, Eleanor Hill -- they don't make them like that
 very often, and we were blessed in the Joint Inquiry to have here,
 and she's actually still there.
 			</p><p>Three points -- briefly -- that I would like to make, and
 my completed, my formal statement is part of your record. Number
 one, don't reinvent the wheel. Number two, focus on where you can
 add value. And, number three, be unflinching. Let's talk about
 the wheel. This is the wheel. Here it is. I thought you should
 all see it. You probably have this on the library shelves. This
 is the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security,
 brilliantly led by somebody named Saxby Chambliss and Jane Harman.
 We wrote a report to the speaker of the House of Representatives
 and the minority leader in July of 2002 -- lots of recommendations
 about the performance of NSA, CIA and FBI prior to 9/11.
 			</p><p>Here's another one. This is the Bremer Commission.
 Bremer may not have been known to the world before last week, but
 he is now the civil administrator in Iraq. Again, there was a
 commission, 10 members. One of them was named Harman -- lots of
 recommendations, m any of which have never been implemented, but
 they are good recommendations and worthy of consideration.
 			</p><p>This is Hart-Rudman. We all know who Hart and Rudman
 are. Lots of little volumes: New world coming, American security
 in the 21st century, seeking a national strategy, so forth --
 supporting stuff -- road map -- good word -- for national security
 -- two volumes of that.
 			</p><p>This is the Gilmore Commission, former Governor Gilmore
 of Virginia -- lots of the same folks served on all these
 commissions. These are only the first four reports. A lot of
 trees died to prepare this material, and a lot of it is gathering
 dust. Lots of recommendations that have not yet been implemented.
 			</p><p>Council on Foreign Relations, which is still at it, now
 has a new committee on homeland security, which I think is a good
 thing, led by somebody named Rudman. And these were earlier
 reports -- Hart and Rudman, "America Still Unprepared, Still in
 Danger."
 			</p><p>And then we have the National Academy of Science. We
 have here the Heritage Foundation. This is CSIS -- a huge amount
 of work that's excellent that has been very helpful. And then we
 have the Kennedy School at Harvard, "State and Local Response to
 Terrorism." The Markle Foundation's brilliant work on technology
 and terrorism. And I can't even read this -- Center for Arms
 Control and Non-Proliferation, and so forth.
 			</p><p>And then we have the phantom report -- it isn't here yet
 -- it's called the Joint Inquiry, but it will be soon to arrive in
 June, we all hope, and on that point I am absolutely promised that
 there will be an all-hands meeting at the end of this month, which
 will meet all weekend if necessary, where those who can make the
 decisions about what's in and what's out of that report will be in
 the room, and hopefully then all of us will be relieved to put out
 there what was and is a very good work product.
 			</p><p>So, please don't reinvent the wheel. Read this good
 stuff. Help us make certain that the recommendations of value,
 which is most of them, become law, become regulation, become
 practice in our intelligence community. All around me have spoken
 to a lot of the good recommendations. They should not be
 gathering dust. They should be helping us be safer. That's my
 first point.
 			</p><p>Second point: Focus on where you can add value. Most of
 these reports -- not all of them -- focused on three of our
 intelligence agencies -- two to three, the CIA, FBI and NSA. You
 have a broader mandate, you know this. You can look at a lot of
 the other things that went wrong that should be fixed. The FAA
 comes to mind, the watch list problem comes to mind, the
 vulnerability, continuing vulnerability of aircraft comes to mind.
 Every time I go to a hearing everyone is worried about shoulderfired
 missiles -- what do we do about that? We certainly had a
 near-death experience with one airplane headed out of Mombassa,
 Kenya. This is the kind of thing that perhaps you should think
 about -- what can we do to increase aviation security? What can
 we do to increase port security? There are lots of agencies that
 have to do with that. Many of them have moved on over to the
 Homeland Security Department. But, nonetheless, as a
 representative of the communities around the ports of Long Beach
 and Los Angeles, the largest container ports on the planet, you
 have lots of work that you could usefully do.
 			</p><p>Third subject is the evolution of the Department of
 Homeland Security. You've heard that we all tried to design a
 bill that would not just move the deck chairs around, but create
 one deck. We still have a lot of work to do to create one deck.
 There is not yet, so far as I can tell, a vulnerability
 assessment, one national, integrated vulnerability assessment.
 Money is not infinite -- until we have that vulnerability
 assessment we won't be putting our resources behind our most
 vulnerable targets, and that's something that I don't think should
 be a public document, because we don't need to tell the terrorists
 where we are most vulnerable. But, nonetheless, it's something
 that needs to get done. So that's where I think you can add
 value.
 			</p><p>Final point: Be unflinching. Seek the truth. But,
 remember, at least this is my version of this -- the point of
 looking backward is to look forward. We can't fix it going
 backwards. We can fix it going forwards. Don't get stuck
 backwards. The best way to honor these families and those they
 lost is to prevent this from happening again. That's where you
 have to be going. How do we prevent the next one? We've done a
 pretty good job over 20 months -- lots of gaps, but we haven't had
 a major terrorist attack in the United States of America in the
 last 20 months. It could happen in an hour -- might happen in an
 hour. But if you do your work well, the changes of it happening in
 an hour will be less.
 			</p><p>And finally, as you are unflinching, be sure you get the
 information you need from the Administration. Also be sure -- and
 I want to second something Senator Graham said -- that you fairly
 and evenhandedly assess the role of foreign governments currently
 and in the future in fostering spreading terrorism and weapons of
 mass destruction. That's a place we didn't get to fully, and it's
 place that I think needs more attention.
 			</p><p>Thank you very much.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you, Congresswoman Harman. Thank you
 all very much for taking the time to be with us today. And could
 I ask Senator Gorton?
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON: If I found one common theme through the
 testimony of all four of you, and reduced it to one word, it would
 be "frustration." I served for a little bit more than two years
 on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and quit out of frustration,
 thinking I wasn't learning very much, and that I was having almost
 no effect on how the agencies acted. And so, recognizing the
 short time period you have, I am going to fold three separate
 questions into one, and ask for the comments of each of you on it.
 			</p><p>Take first the period between January 2001 and
 September 11th, 2001, when the three of you at one time or another
 were chairmen of the Intelligence Committees -- just that period
 of approximately eight months -- were there any changes in the
 policies, priorities, or practices of our intelligence agencies as
 a result of congressional oversight, as a result of the
 suggestions that you all made? Now, if there were, some of them
 may be classified, but you could at least tell us whether any
 substantial changes were made as a result of your work, or were
 you totally frustrated during that period of time.
 			</p><p>The second question is very similar. From September
 11th, 2001 to December of 2002, were there any such changes? Now,
 obviously, Congress as a whole in that period of time passed the
 Patriot Act and created the Homeland Security Department. I'm not
 counting those. I'm just saying, were there any significant
 changes in the policies and priorities or practices of our
 intelligence agencies as a result of what you all did during that
 period of time?
 			</p><p>And third, from December of last year until May,
 Congressman Goss has given us a, I think, a magnificent outline of
 what he can say about your joint committee report, but I don't
 see, Congressman, in your written statement, the slightest
 indication that any of those recommendations have been acted on in
 that time, or any of the others. And so the final question is, has
 the final report of the joint committee resulted in any
 significant changes in policies, priorities or practices of our
 intelligence community?
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Who wants to take that one? Senator Shelby.
 			</p><p>SEN. SHELBY: First of all, January 1 to 9/11, that was
 your first thing -- were there any real changes that we
 recommended or tried to mandate -- I'm sure there were some, but
 they were probably --
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON: I know that you recommended, but they
 probably --
 			</p><p>SEN. SHELBY: -- but they were probably not earthshaking
 changes at all. In dealing with the NSA, Congressman Goss,
 Senator Graham, Congresswoman Harman, all of us, we tried to --
 hard, and I think NSA was moving in the right direction, is still
 moving in the right direction to modernize. And this was stuff
 coming from us. A lot of recommendations came from our joint --
 our TAG team, Technical Advisory Group recommendations, and then
 the reality of NSA going down, you know, and just didn't operate
 for some hours, two days -- sure, there were some -- there was
 some heeding of some of our recommendations there.
 			</p><p>As far as Langley is concerned, the first part, I know in
 the Senate, Senator Graham and I worked a long time, pushed a lot
 of emphasis on recruiting some of the best and brightest with
 different language skills -- I alluded to it earlier, Arabic,
 Farsi, you name it. Maybe just a little change, but no wholesale
 changes. Since September the 11th on, a lot of changes. One we
 had recommended before to take the wraps off the CIA that John
 Deutch had put on and had been continued under Director Tenet as
 to who the agents could recruit, their assets. You are very
 familiar with all this. The president was involved in that, and I
 think those were changes probably pushed by the White House, but
 also pushed by a lot of us in the Congress.
 			</p><p>You also mentioned statutory changes to FISA and
 different things and how they operate, but I don't think their
 wholesale changes have been made. I think it's incremental,
 evolutionary, but some progress, yes, considering everything. I'm
 going to save some time for some others.
 			</p><p>MR. HARMAN: Congresswoman Harman.
 			</p><p>REP. HARMAN: I'm sorry, Senator, that you left the
 Intelligence Committees. I think they're fabulous places to be.
 It took me four years to get on the House Intelligence Committee,
 and I am highly honored to be the ranking Democrat on the full
 committee now.
 			</p><p>I think there has been progress. Obviously, there needs
 to be more. Let me just tick off a few things. One is near to, I
 think, Tim Roemer's heart, the hiring of linguists. We found that
 we had basically zero language skills in the areas where we needed
 them, and the FBI, the CIA, and the NNSA have done a major job of
 recruiting the languages needed and training the linguists.
 			</p><p>Information sharing -- I think we do pretty well
 horizontally across the federal government now. We don't do well
 vertically with first responders. There's a requirement in the
 intelligence authorization bill from last year that a new system
 be developed. It isn't developed yet. What we have through the
 NLETS and other forms of communication that the FBI uses is much
 better than what we did have, but we still need to go to tear
 sheets or some way to get declassified information in the hands of
 those who need it quickly.
 			</p><p>Intelligence fusion -- Congressman Goss talked about the
 TTIC. I think that function is critically important. It's one we
 all recommended in all these reports, and we're starting to do
 that.
 			</p><p>The Homeland Security Department needs to develop one
 deck but it is, again, a step in the right direction. And
 finally, on NSA -- well, both NSA and the FBI -- their technology
 is rapidly improving in both cases. The FBI had to transit from
 the 16th century to the 21st century -- I mean, it was using
 abacuses and ancient parchment. I think Bob Mueller would agree
 with this. And now it has good, possibly excellent technology
 systems that can do data-mining and state-of-the-art intelligence
 gathering. The NSA had a lot of good technology but didn't use it
 well. And its new phrase, that I think is very appealing, is that
 it has changed from gatherer to a hunter, and it goes after clues
 that it needs to find. It couldn't possibly sift through all the
 stuff it has in real time.
 			</p><p>So, I would just put all those things out there as
 evidence of real progress, and I wish you had stayed on the
 Intelligence Committee -- you would have loved it.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Senator, I'll --
 			</p><p>SEN. GRAHAM: Could I just add a few words to --
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Yes, of course, Senator Graham.
 			</p><p>SEN. GRAHAM: -- to Senator Gorton's question. I would
 say that from January of '01 to September the 11th there was a
 considerable amount, primarily from the Senate side during the
 tenure of Senator Shelby, on reform. And those reforms had one
 basic starting point. We have had an intelligence system which
 basically started in 1947, which was totally focused on the Soviet
 Union. And as a result of that, we had developed certain
 technology, certain cultural orientations. What concerned me was
 that the Soviet Union had become history about 10 years earlier,
 and yet our intelligence agencies had not yet responded to that.
 And I think that is a very central question, which I hope you will
 explore, and that is why was there such reluctance to change
 during the first decade after the fall of the Soviet Union.
 			</p><p>We tried to emphasize, under Senator Shelby's leadership,
 some of the things that we thought were critical for change. The
 senator talked about increasing the linguistic capability because
 now we weren't just interested in listening to Russian, we also
 had 20 or 30 other often arcane languages that we needed to be
 able to understand in real time.
 			</p><p>There were other changes. The architecture of our
 satellite systems were based on putting big machines over big
 long-time projects, primarily things like the Soviet submarine
 capabilities. Now all of a sudden we needed to cover a dozen
 different projects. And one of the unfortunate things that
 happened is, for instance, we had to move coverage from India and
 Pakistan back to Bosnia when that war broke out. So, we were
 urging a new approach to satellite architecture that would be less
 expensive, smaller and more mobile in order to respond to the
 conditions that we were in.
 			</p><p>January of 2001 to January of 2002 I think is an
 interesting period for the policy changes that occurred. I met in
 February of 2002 with the people at Central Command in Tampa,
 Florida, and the question was, how is the war on terrorism going?
 And the answer was, the war on terrorism has been essentially
 abandoned and that what we're now doing is conducting a manhunt --
 that was their word -- to seek out those people that we consider
 to be the key figures in al Qaeda. I think that was a very
 serious mistake, as was the relocation of military intelligence
 capabilities, and that we probably were defective in not providing
 an adequate oversight of that policy judgment.
 			</p><p>As to what's happened since December of '02 until today,
 I would have to say that I don't know what has happened because
 most of the answers are contained in first examining what parts of
 the committee's report will be released publicly so that then the
 right questions can be asked. As I indicated in the area of FBI
 reform, Congressman Goss and I have sent two letters to the FBI
 detailing those 10 steps that we felt were a key to expeditious
 reform of the FBI's ability to conduct domestic intelligence, and
 as of today we have not received a response, so, therefore, are
 not in much of a position to evaluate how effective our
 recommendations have been in terms of institutional response.
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON: Is that the right answer to everything in
 the final report of the Joint Committee, Congressman Goss?
 			</p><p>REP. GOSS: Well, my take on your question, Senator, is I
 think that the right way to answer your question, and I think all
 of my colleagues have hit on very, very important points, is that
 there has been an extraordinary degree of attention focused on the
 intelligence community in the oversight committees since 9/11.
 What we were doing before 9/11 wasn't a whole lot different than
 what we were doing after 9/11 on the committee, it's just the
 people were changing. So, what really changed was the audience,
 not the message, as far as the work we were doing. And we were
 thankful to have the audience, but not thankful for the reason why
 we had the audience.
 			</p><p>Things that have been mentioned, but one or two have been
 left out -- the TPED cycle, which is a critical cycle for us, and
 will come under a lot more scrutiny, was getting attention, but
 not the kind of attention it needed. What we found after 9/11 was
 suddenly there was more money, people were willing to take more
 risk. Different things assumed priority that were pretty much
 either off limits for discussion or too difficult to bring to the
 floor of the House. Some of the FISA debate would, I think,
 illustrate that pretty well. And that, of course, is far from
 over, and it should be far from over.
 			</p><p>But I will also say that some of the processes that we
 have set up did work very well after 9/11, and I think that needs
 to be noticed, that the working relationship between the top
 responsible people on the Hill and the top responsible people in
 the executive branch actually function quite well to assist in our
 national security and how we have protected ourselves. I'm not
 going to go into a lot of detail, obviously, on that.
 			</p><p>I think that there was certainly a lot less push back on
 some of the things we put in our authorization bills. We saw
 decisions being made, as Senator Graham has said, properly so, on
 the architecture of our overhead structures. Our problem there
 was we would make strong recommendations, but we couldn't get a
 decision. We finally started to get some decisions.
 			</p><p>So, I think that by our continuous attention to the
 areas that needed work, we created a ball that rolled slowly at
 first, rolled much more rapidly after 9/11, and it's not a
 significantly different ball today than it was in January of '01.
 			</p><p>And one other area -- has any of this stuff been
 implemented? The answer is some of it has. Now, what's happened
 is the executive branch is taking some steps on some things we all
 learned from the 9/11 review. They haven't formalized the
 responses to us. I presume Senator Graham has not gotten his copy,
 but I did get an interim answer from Director Mueller to our long
 list of "what are you going to do about this stuff?" And then we
 sent -- it wasn't a sufficient answer, it was an interim answer,
 clearly, and we sent back specifics. And I know that some of
 those specifics are being addressed in the FBI. I'm not sure I
 want to say which ones publicly, but the record will speak. And I
 think that the FBI has informed me that by the end of the month
 that they expect to have the whole list brought up to attention,
 and serendipitously -- and this is serendipitously, our committee
 this afternoon is having the FBI in front of it as part of our
 authorization process, and those questions are out there.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Commissioner Gorelick.
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
 Mindful of the pressure on the schedules of our House member
 witnesses, let me say this first at the outset. I thank you for
 your dedication and evident enthusiasm for your work. Those of us
 from Washington know that membership on the intelligence
 committees does not offer some of the things that membership on
 other committee does. You hold your hearings mostly in private.
 You do not get to show the work that you're doing all that often.
 There is no obvious constituency for campaign contributions. And,
 therefore, you must be motivated by a strong sense of public
 service, and I think that is quite evident today.
 			</p><p>My concern is that you don't have the powers, the tools
 or the mechanisms to align our capabilities against our threats,
 and that's what I'd like to probe however briefly this morning,
 and I know that we will have some more time with you in private.
 And if there is time, we can turn to the joint inquiry. I have
 spent time in the Ford Building -- it's not all that bad. The
 report is very impressive, and I know that the public, if and when
 it is able to see the report, will be very impressed with it.
 Congresswoman Harman, I will try to be unflinching and rise to
 your challenge. The committee's oversight is clearly the product
 of the entities that it oversees. And as Congressman Goss pointed
 out, the intelligence committee -- community -- consists of 15
 agencies in six or so cabinet departments. Most of the resources
 actually belong to the Department of Defense and the committees
 that oversee the Department of Defense oversee those entities.
 The Director of Central Intelligence controls only the CIA,
 really.
 			</p><p>Now, you recognized this problem, and what you did is you
 created a deputy director for community management, who is a
 tremendous public servant, but she has, I don't know, six people
 in staff, she doesn't have the CIA reporting to her at all.
 			</p><p>And so, here is my question to you: How can you oversee
 the intelligence community when the agencies don't belong to any
 one that you have the right to oversee? And my second question
 is: Why shouldn't the director of central intelligence at least
 have the authority, if he doesn't own the agencies, to execute the
 budgets that he is given?
 			</p><p>SEN. SHELBY: If	 I can respond briefly -- that's an
 excellent question. You spent some time in thinking about this.
 			</p><p>That's part of the whole problem in the intelligence
 community. Fifteen agencies is, without reciting it all again, you
 know who controls what. The director of CIA controls at the most
 20 percent of the budget. Yet, if he is going to be in fact the
 director of central intelligence, I believe myself, and we've made
 some recommendations, that we need a national director of
 intelligence, we need a cabinet level position. Otherwise, the
 reforms we talk about, which comes with power, money, direction,
 management, it's not going to happen -- not in the manner that we
 think it should. If you can't control the legislative agenda or,
 more than that, the funding agenda for an agency, you can't
 control. You can't really influence them, except on the edge.
 That's my judgement.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Congresswoman Harman.
 			</p><p>REP. HARMAN: Let me first commend the questioner for her
 enormous service to our country. To anyone who missed it, Jamie
 Gorelick was general counsel of the Department of Defense, deputy
 attorney general, and a variety of other very useful and important
 roles in our government -- a lawyer, a wonderful friend, and
 supporter of all these activities.
 			</p><p>I think you're right. I think that there are limits on
 jurisdiction. There also is the dirtiest four-letter word in
 Washington spelled T-U-R-F, that limits what we can do, and also
 limits what others in Congress or in the executive branch or even
 you can do in terms of reorganizing. But on this point, I would
 like to recommend again the report of the Markle Foundation which
 is buried under all these trees, and its director, a fellow named
 Phil Zelikow, whom you may know, he's right in my line of sight --
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK: I think we may get an opportunity to review
 those recommendations.
 			</p><p>REP. HARMAN: And -- yes, those recommendations had to do
 with using technology to tie together a lot of independent
 functions effectively. And, in fact, if you do reorganization
 without the technology, it won't work. So, there is a virtual
 reorganization option possible, which I think would go a long way
 to avoid the turf fights. The only place then left is the
 budgetary reorganization. That's what we were able to accomplish
 with the Homeland Security Department, at least for 22 agencies.
 But that's not a home run either, given the fact that where we are
 now with the homeland security budget is -- it's just the
 aggregation of 22 agency budgets. So, this is a very hard
 problem, which you well know. I don't think the solutions are
 obvious, but I just want to put out there that technology is a
 major way to jump over some of the turf issues.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Senator Graham.
 			</p><p>SEN. GRAHAM: Yes. Mr. Chairman, I'd just make two
 remarks. One is going back to what I said earlier, the degree to
 which our current intelligence practices are a reflection of a
 past which no longer exists. In 1947, the focus of the
 intelligence agencies was on protecting our atomic secrets, and
 the congressional committee which oversaw the intelligence agency
 was the Committee on Atomic Energy. That fact then caused a series
 of other things to occur, such as, as Congressman Harman has just
 said, placing much of the intelligence community under the direct
 control of the Defense Department and placing a significant amount
 of its total budget under the control of the Defense Department.
 Those are issues which clearly need to be re-thought in the post-
 Cold War era.
 			</p><p>And I think it's not insignificant that the number
 one recommendation of the joint committee reads as follows:
 "Congress should amend the National Security Act of 1947 to create
 an sufficiently staff a statutory director of national
 intelligence who shall be the president's principal adviser on
 intelligence and shall have the full range of management,
 budgetary and personnel responsibilities needed to make sure the
 entire United States intelligence community operates as a coherent
 whole."
 			</p><p>I would hope that when you complete your review, that you
 might find that that's a statement that you could endorse.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Congressman Goss.
 			</p><p>REP. GOSS: Thank you. When I first took over as
 chairman of the committee, the policy that we had for intelligence
 was SMO, support for military operations. To put it in English,
 it was war-fighters -- take care of the war-fighters, force
 protection, force enhancement. Those were the concerns. Not a
 whole lot of audience out there talking about or a whole lot of
 people screaming for, clamoring for the national intelligence
 program.
 			</p><p>And so we've had this tension all along. It doesn't just
 measure up in whether I get an aircraft carrier or a satellite.
 It's measured up into various questions of what is the policy.
 So let's take a quick look at the situation today. We've been
 asked to look at vulnerabilities, in the United States
 particularly, in our homeland, because the two oceans aren't doing
 it for us anymore.
 			</p><p>Then we're taking a look at what's the nature of the
 threat, because it's obviously very different. It isn't those
 tanks on the other side of the Fulda Gap anymore. So then the
 next thing we have to do is, once we understand the vulnerability
 and the threats, then we have to understand what are the policies
 that have changed. Okay, those come out of leadership, long
 process, a lot of debate back and forth. It doesn't happen
 instantly in this country.
 			</p><p>The next thing that happens after that is when you have
 all of this understood of what your policy is, then you have to
 have the capability to accomplish it, to enforce it, to do it.
 Well, do we have the capabilities in the intelligence community to
 do it? No, of course we don't, because everything has changed so
 dramatically recently that we've got yesterday's capabilities on
 yesterday's policies, and we need today's. And we haven't quite
 got there yet. So I think that's what our committees are going to
 be basically functioning on, the oversight committee is going to
 be basically functioning on, no matter how we say it.
 			</p><p>Then comes the final piece of the straw, which you've
 properly identified. And if you understand all this and can get
 your arms around all that, what would the management profile look
 like? And it would not look anything like what we have today.
 And I think you all understand that. I know that Lee Hamilton
 knows that very well. He has studied Congress many times.
 			</p><p>And we try and solve the problem of overlap with other
 committees to deal with the other Cabinet-level secretaries by
 having members on the committee who also sit on the committees of
 those people. We've tried to create ways to make sure that we're
 heard in the proper space.
 			</p><p>So if we're talking about the FBI, the part that's
 intelligence gets represented and the part that's not intelligence
 gets represented. It's a cumbersome, inefficient, foolish system
 that has survived very well because it's the only one we have.
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK: Let me follow up on that. One of the
 reports that Congresswoman Harman waved around was Aspin-Brown, I
 think. And you were on that venerable commission; very good
 people on it, very good recommendations came out of it. You tried
 to implement it and you ran into a brick wall in the form of the
 Armed Services Committees. Do you have a proposed solution to
 that?
 			</p><p>REP. GOSS: I think the brick wall has actually been
 reinforced by a concrete wall as well.
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK: Sounds like we need a bunker buster.
 			</p><p>REP. GOSS: My basic conclusion is that the
 recommendations that we made in our report that you've seen the
 brief summary of are the right. I would prefer to go to DNI,
 director of national intelligence, take Joan Dempsey as the
 community management position and give it the clout that it was
 intended to have to coordinate, because coordination is a huge
 problem.
 			</p><p>It's very hard to ask somebody in a lower-level position
 -- although that's a high position, it's relatively lower to
 dealing with three stars and saying, "You will do this," when the
 three stars can go to the Pentagon and say, "I don't think so."
 			</p><p>It is an unworkable system. It was an inspiration that
 we put out there saying, "This will solve the problem." And like
 most silver bullets, it turned out to be lead.
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK: Let me follow up with two questions, if I
 can, about your actual internal mechanisms. I went back and read
 the Director of Central Intelligence's annual reports that he
 makes to your committees the beginning of every year, now called,
 I think, the worldwide threat hearings.
 			</p><p>If you go back and you look at his statements from '97
 through 2001, terrorism is in there at, like, number three or so
 until 2001, when it rockets in February of 2001 to number one with
 some very strong language. "The threat of terrorism is real. It
 is immediate. Osama bin Laden and his global network remain the
 most immediate and serious threat." In tone and content, I would
 say hair-raising.
 			</p><p>My question to you is, what were your mechanisms for
 following up on that? I didn't see -- maybe there were any, but I
 didn't see any hearings on terrorism in your committees after
 that. That was an inflection point, maybe at least in retrospect,
 but it seemed to be an inflection point. What happened?
 			</p><p>REP. GOSS: Well, the answer that I would give you on
 behalf of our committee is that we had been listening for some
 time about terrorism. Actually, terrorism, I think you can go
 back to Lebanon as sort of really the place we should start. But
 terrorism, in terms of our committee, is that we heard those
 threat briefings.
 			</p><p>Now, understand that the threat part of it and the
 awareness part of it is part of our education process as members
 of the committees. It's providing the capabilities to deal with
 the threat which is our responsibility to deal with.
 			</p><p>So we took that on and said, "Okay, Mr. Director, if it
 is this way, what are you going to do about it? What capabilities
 do you need? We are concerned that you have enough people who
 speak the right languages in your counterterrorism center. We are
 concerned that you have enough people in the right field stations
 around the world to deal with terrorists when they show up here
 and there."
 			</p><p>That dialogue does go on back and forth, but it does go
 on generally in closed session for a very simple reason. We're
 not out there making policy. We're out there trying to get
 capability, and we don't necessarily want to tell whoever might be
 listening in another country that we're having these discussions,
 because when it turns out we can't agree to fund the
 counterterrorist center, I don't think we ought to tell anybody.
 It's that kind of a problem.
 			</p><p>SEN. SHELBY: In February 2001, I remember the briefing,
 the threat assessment. And it was real. I thought the director
 laid it out. There was continuous dialogue between the committee,
 the committee staff and the Agency on that. I know Senator Graham
 and I were conducting the hearing, the threat hearing.
 			</p><p>I think the question is, you're going to have to look at
 what we did and what they did in the community, having laid out
 that this threat has escalated so highly, the terrorist threat,
 what they did during that time, because they were in the
 operational phase. We were in the oversight and legislative
 phase. I think that's an important distinction. And you ought to
 look at the record.
 			</p><p>REP. HARMAN: I would just add that when I returned to
 Congress in January of 2001, I was appointed by the speaker and
 the Democratic leader to be ranking member of a new working group
 on terrorism and homeland security. The date was January of 2001.
 And we began work on what became our report, which we issued
 shortly after September 11, 2001.
 			</p><p>So I think there was interest focused in Congress. But I
 think the absolutely critical thing is what Congressman Goss said
 earlier. What changed on 9/11 was the audience. And finally there
 was momentum, attention to doing things that many people in
 Congress and in the executive branch and the involved outside
 community had wanted to do for a long time.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Senator Graham.
 			</p><p>SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. The kinds of things that needed to
 be done after terrorism emerged as our highest priority were not
 the kinds of things that were particularly dramatic in scope. In
 fact, they tended to be in the opposite direction. They became
 more micro as we left our focus on the one big target and started
 dealing with all of these individual targets.
 			</p><p>As an example, we were still spending, in my
 judgment, an excessive amount of our research and development
 money to produce capabilities that didn't line up with our
 vulnerabilities. And that became one of the priorities of our
 committees, to assess what was going to be required, to think over
 the horizon 10 years.
 			</p><p>And I might say things like the unmanned small aircraft
 that have proved so significant in the war in Afghanistan and Iraq
 and no doubt in future engagements, particularly with terrorist
 groups, was in large part a result of the prodding of the
 intelligence committees over the resistance of some of the
 agencies that like to build the bigger, more known aircraft.
 			</p><p>So I'm not here to say that the Congress nor the
 intelligence committees were totally prescient or perfect. They
 understood the problem. They understood the analysis of the
 problem and were trying to carry out our responsibilities.
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK: It seems to me a completely legitimate
 position to take that, in the first instance, the responsibility
 is in the executive branch agency. But I'm concerned about the
 mechanisms that you all have or don't for aligning, as I said
 before, the capabilities against the threat and to see whether
 they are doing what they need to be doing against that threat.
 			</p><p>And there's some peculiarities of the way in which
 oversight is done in the intelligence community that I'd like to
 just ask one question about, and we can certainly follow up when
 we have more time.
 			</p><p>The authorizations for the Intelligence Community contain
 these massive classified annexes, 500 pages of annexes, with very
 detailed prescriptions for what the intelligence community, all
 these individual agencies, will do, and reports that they must
 give.
 			</p><p>And I look at that and I think, "Well, is that the best
 way to manage? Wouldn't it be better to have a more cross-cutting
 and strategic view of what their problems are and how they propose
 solutions?"
 			</p><p>And the second thing I noticed is that unlike many
 departments, the intelligence community has to have both the
 appropriators and the authorizers before they can spend any money.
 So even if the appropriators say, "Here's the money to do
 something," unless you specifically authorize it and it's found in
 one of those many lines, they can't do anything. I think that
 that is, having been in the executive branch, where I didn't serve
 under such a system at Justice or Defense, that it would have
 been, at the very least, dispiriting. And I just wonder how you
 carry out your functions in such a system.
 			</p><p>SEN. SHELBY: If I can try to answer that, because at one
 time I chaired the Intelligence Committee. And, of course, I was
 a member with Senator Gorton of the Defense Appropriations
 Committee that funded all of this. I can tell you there are a
 little different goals sometimes in the funding subcommittee, as
 you well know from your position at the Pentagon, of intelligence
 activities and what we did at times, and initiatives we tried to
 push sometimes were not funded, despite some of us being on both
 committees. It's a struggle.
 			</p><p>But overall we had, I think, overall a good relationship
 with the Defense subcommittees on Appropriations in the House and
 Senate, but not always did we get our way.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Congressman Goss.
 			</p><p>REP. GOSS: Thank you, Governor. I wanted to respond to
 that. You brought a little smile to my face, because by statute
 it's true; no intelligence monies may be spent unless they're
 authorized.
 			</p><p>What you haven't read in the statute is the appropriators
 on the House side have decided that they have authorization power,
 which was news to some of us. But the system does not work as
 perfectly as we would like it to work. And I say that (at this?)
 very important point right now, because we are funding much of
 what we're doing in the intelligence community these days on
 supplemental budgets.
 			</p><p>Supplemental budgets do not get scrutiny of authorizers
 to the degree that we would normally do our work. So one of the
 recommendations about the budget is very heartfelt. I agree with
 Senator Graham; we've talked long and hard about it. The DOD
 position has been, "We want the intelligence. We like it. It's
 useful. You pay for it." We understand that message.
 			</p><p>The other thing that I would like to say in terms of a
 little bit of foresight -- and give full credit to Senator Graham
 for this because he deserves it -- shortly after we started
 working together in 19 -- in '01 -- Senator Graham said, "I feel
 the need to have a joint retreat. We have got a management mess
 on our hands." And we did pull off the Senate-House retreat,
 which was very useful, attended by the right people, and we came
 out and we analyzed a lot of these management problems.
 			</p><p>September 11th came and we weren't in the business of
 management adjustment anymore. We were in the business of
 capabilities. So we tried, but it's been very hard to get the
 time to get out of the box lately and look five years down the
 road.
 			</p><p>SEN. GRAHAM: If I could just return to one of the
 recommendations that I made to this commission for its study, and
 that is, first, the need to get the basic financial accounting
 systems in the intelligence agencies up to a point that they are
 at least subject to being audited. That may sound like the driest
 subject imaginable, but it is the key to being able to implement
 some of the other reforms.
 			</p><p>And second, I believe that, just as has occurred with the
 Department of Homeland Security, that the intelligence agencies
 ought to be lifted from the Defense budget and given their own
 budget. Then at least the public will know what the bottom line
 for intelligence was and they can assess: "That seems excessive
 or inadequate." Right now you can't even have that debate because
 it's buried inside the big Defense Department budget.
 			</p><p>And second, there could be a closer relationship between
 the authorizing and appropriating committees so that common values
 and priorities, at least those that were considered to be number
 one, two and three, would get the priority attention that they
 deserve.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Congresswoman Harman.
 			</p><p>REP. HARMAN: I'm the only one here who has not chaired
 one of the intelligence committees yet, but I -- maybe that makes
 me more fearless. I appreciate the question, because I think
 authorization by footnote is a pretty awful process and it really
 prevents most members from having any reasonable oversight over
 the process, because wading through 500 dense pages is pretty
 hard.
 			</p><p>I turned around to smile at some of the Intelligence
 Committee staff because they've been having a conversation about
 how to change this. I suggest just taking the thrust of your
 question, that aligning capabilities, at least capabilities for
 terrorism, would be a good way to start.
 			</p><p>We might not be able to fix all of it, but the whole
 world is focused on this problem. And we have to fix some of it
 so that our capabilities are aligned, so that we prevent the next
 major terrorist attack in America. And there is the political
 will to support that. So this is a great subject. And I hope
 that, should we appear before you again, we can report progress.
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK: Well, thank you for -- oh, I'm sorry.
 Senator Shelby, did you want to add something?
 			</p><p>SEN. SHELBY: No, I was just --
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK: I wanted to thank you for inviting
 unflinching questions and for giving unflinching answers.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: I think we have one final question by Senator
 Cleland. You've given us an enormous amount of your time. Thank
 you very much. Senator Cleland.
 			</p><p>SEN. CLELAND: Thank you very much. Senator Graham, I could
 not agree more with you in the thrust of that number one
 recommendation in the report that there's got to be somebody in
 charge of the intelligence community.
 			</p><p>After spending six years on the Senate Armed Services
 Committee, where we got briefing after briefing in terms of
 appropriations needed by the intelligence community, that briefing
 was often murky. It was ill-defined. And, quite frankly, we
 never quite frankly knew exactly what was going on, because we
 were on one committee; the Intelligence Committee was on something
 else.
 			</p><p>Secondly, I do think that, despite the massive amounts of
 reports, where the water meets the wheel is just the report today;
 two articles in the New York Times. We're now going back and
 wondering whether or not we had the right intelligence on the war
 in Iraq. Pre- war views of Iraq threat are under review by the
 CIA. I'd like, with no objection by this commission, to enter
 that into the record. And what happens? We have another tape
 from a bin Laden aide, and so the al Qaeda is still in operation.
 Something has to change dramatically. Thank you for your
 testimony.
 			</p><p>What other lessons, Senator Graham, have you learned that
 you would like to share with us as we close out the hearing?
 			</p><p>SEN. GRAHAM: First, that we are dealing with a much
 smaller but more nimble adversary in these international terrorist
 organizations. And we have got to similarly become more nimble and
 capable. There probably are few areas that illustrate this as
 much as one that we've talked about, and that is language, and I
 would also say cultural identity.
 			</p><p>If you want to get somebody inside a terrorist
 organization, you can't go to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir to start
 recruiting. You've got to find somebody who looks and talks and
 understands the terrorists about as well as they do. We, frankly,
 don't have that capability. At least we don't have it today. We
 have trouble recruiting assets who do have that capability. I
 think that is an example of the kind of more nimble reform that we
 need to make.
 			</p><p>SEN. CLELAND: Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr.
 Chairman.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Anybody else like to comment? Thank you. I
 think one thing we have learned today is just how able our
 leadership in the Congress is in this area. Thank you all very,
 very much for taking your time. You know we'll be back to you,
 because we're going to need your help. Thank you very much.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: All right, we are going to start again,
 because I know some of the senators and congressmen have tight
 schedules today. Our third and final congressional panel this
 morning consists of senators and representatives who really come
 from the regions that experienced these particular attacks. I
 understand that very well. They, like I, I am sure lost people
 they knew on that day, and so have not only an intellectual but an
 emotional attachment and anger about what happened on that
 particular occasion. They have their own unique perspective. It
 was our intention actually to have them at our very first hearing
 in New York, but circumstances made that impossible. So, we are
 very, very pleased to have them with us today. The first two who
 are here, first of all Senator Hillary Clinton of New York and Jon
 Corzine of New Jersey. Senator Clinton?
 			</p><p>SEN. CLINTON: Thank you very much, Governor Kean, and
 Congressman Hamilton, and members of the commission. First let me
 thank you for taking on this very important challenge and
 responsibility. As I listened to the end of the previous panel, I
 think it became clear how important the mission of this
 independent commission is for the future of us all.
 			</p><p>I want to take this opportunity to speak with you about
 what happened in New York on September 11th, and the lingering
 consequences of those terrorist attacks on our city, and certainly
 on the surrounding region in terms of the impact in loss of human
 life, in grievously injured victims, and in the physical
 destruction that we are still coping with.
 			</p><p>We are testifying while once again the threat level has
 been raised to code orange. New York City, which has remained at
 that high level of threat alertness, is instituting an operation,
 called Operation Atlas. It costs millions of dollars a week for
 the heightened security that is necessary. And it is imperative
 that as we review what happened in the past, for answers, for
 recommendations, for changes that we hope will make our country
 safer, that we also look at the human cost and the incredible
 burden that localities have borne because of their being the
 particular victims of this attack on America.
 			</p><p>I applaud your efforts to get the funding that you need,
 and I hope that if there are additional resources that are
 required, you will let those of us in Congress know immediately so
 that we can work with you to get every penny that you see as
 necessary.
 			</p><p>But we are also here to provide more than funding. We
 want to provide support, and it is deeply troubling that the
 commission has had to fight to receive classified information, and
 the clearances that you need to effectively conduct your
 investigation. I am certainly well aware personally with a number
 of the commissioners and others by reputation. There could not be
 a more distinguished panel of Americans. And I hope that you and
 the staff you have compiled will quickly get access to everything
 necessary to make the conclusions that will be part of your
 recommendations.
 			</p><p>If you run into any other roadblocks, however, with
 respect to classified material, again I hope you will immediately
 turn to Congress, which of course created you and in a bipartisan
 fashion stand behind you. When your investigation is completed, I
 certainly know my constituents want and expect a report that not
 only informs and sheds new light on one of the darkest days in our
 history, but also tells us how we are going to find our way into a
 safer future. It's critical that the new Department of Homeland
 Security and the new Terrorist Threat Integration Center have your
 recommendations as soon as possible. They need to establish the
 protocols for gathering and sharing intelligence, and I worry that
 with the insights you are acquiring, and the very pointed,
 unflinching questions you are asking, you are going to get answers
 that may be discomforting, but necessary to be heard as soon as
 possible.
 			</p><p>I certainly have urged the Department of Homeland
 Security and the TTIC to use this information to establish their
 new systems, so that we don't get off on the wrong foot. I mean,
 one of the problems we face are frankly the bureaucratic inertia,
 the difficulty of communication, the compartmentalization which
 has led to some of the difficulties that we have seen in the past,
 and we all hope we can avoid that in the future.
 			</p><p>I also believe that part of your mission is to recommend
 not only what we must to do try to prevent any future attacks, but
 what needs to be done in the event unfortunately we are unable to.
 How do we respond in the wake of an attack? And there I think
 it's imperative to look at the lessons learned in New York. I am
 confident that no city in the world could have responded as
 heroically or as effectively as New York City did. Yet even today
 we are not given the resources in New York City to feel fully
 prepared for whatever else might happen in the future. There are
 outstanding homeland security needs that are not yet met. We
 haven't prioritized sufficiently with the funding from the federal
 government, in partnership with our state and local governments,
 what needs to be done. I'll give you just one example. It's not
 classified, but it is somewhat horrifying. There is one hazardous
 material unit in the city of New York for a city of eight million
 people. That is unacceptable. We have not yet gotten the
 resources to be able to go further than that.
 			</p><p>So I think it's imperative that we start where this
 commission is in the years and the certainly months and days prior
 to September 11th, but also in the aftermath, and to have strong
 recommendations along the lines of what the Congress and others
 need to be doing. And I certainly hope and trust that people in
 positions of influence and power, as well as citizens across our
 country, will pay more attention to this report than was paid to
 the Hart-Rudman reports, the first one released in February 2001,
 and the second in October 2002.
 			</p><p>I want to thank the Commission for appointing a new
 family liaison, Eleanor Hertz, who lost her husband on September
 the 11th. I also want to thank you for opening the New York
 office, headed by Emily Walker, who worked in World Trade Center
 7. These additional liaisons and staff members certainly send a
 very clear signal to the people of New York, New Jersey,
 Connecticut, the affected region, that there is someone they
 can go to for information, for answers to their questions, and
 frankly to hear ideas. I think some of the best ideas about what
 we need to do have come from family members who have taken this on
 as a mission, have come from fire fighters, police officers who
 are on the front lines day in and day out.
 			</p><p>The support that America extended to New York was so
 heart-warming and essential, but we learned a lot about what
 didn't mesh. There was a great deal of effort to try to reach out
 and help New York that it almost became overwhelming. I
 recommended a national 211 hotline, because what happened in the
 wake of September 11th is that 400 independent hotlines just
 mushroomed up all across the country, people wanting to help,
 wanting to contribute, wanting to know what they could do from
 California, to Florida. We need a national 211 system where in
 the wake of a disaster -- natural disaster, terrorist attack --
 people are able to know where to go to offer help and find help.
 We spend a lot of time, and my staff and I were involved in
 bringing together the charities and other groups to try to
 rationalize our efforts, so we didn't have duplication. We
 learned a lot of lessons there. There are people I would
 recommend you speak with about what we learned that can try to
 streamline the process in the future.
 			</p><p>Now, as we look forward, and you are going to be
 examining building codes, aviation security, intelligence, the
 whole range of issues, we have to find a way to communicate with
 the public beyond the screen, really the stone wall of
 classification. Part of the reason I think there are a lot of
 unanswered questions, part of the reason for the confusion -- and
 I thank my friend and colleague Senator Cleland -- I now serve on
 Armed Services -- I knew exactly what he was talking about -- is
 there is a glut of information. It is never summarized. There is
 no executive record that is put into the public domain. Members
 of Congress who are not on the respective committees often have no
 idea what is happening. So think about what it's like for the
 rest of the public. The need for information sharing, something
 that Senator Schumer and I have been advocating for 18 months,
 better information sharing between federal law enforcement, local
 law enforcement. We are still not where that needs to be. New
 York City is spending an enormous amount of money to put into
 effect its own counterterrorism unit. A thousand detectives have
 been taken off the street. They are now trying to run their own
 intelligence operation. Now clearly, in a city as big as ours you
 are going to have to have that. But I still believe that if we
 had a better system for sharing information with the federal
 government, some of that burden on the local community would be
 relieved, and certainly some of the funding that is necessary for
 the local communities, such as New York, to carry this function
 out should be forthcoming from the federal government.
 			</p><p>In addition, I think that the personal commitment of many
 of the members of families that were directly affected, to
 ensuring this doesn't happen to anyone else, has been a tremendous
 source of inspiration, but also a motivator. Any time anyone
 flags about what needs to be done or should be done, you only have
 to remember what so many of these husbands and wives and parents
 and children have gone through. The lessons they have learned on
 the ground, in very practical ways. How does FEMA really work when
 it's not a flood or an earthquake or a tornado, but the
 obliteration of 18 acres in the middle of a huge city, where it's
 very difficult to know whether people are ever going to be able to
 put their lives back together, whether the businesses will
 recover, whether those who were forced out of their homes will
 ever come back, whether we need a special authority to be
 inspecting the air? My colleague, Congressman Nadler, has been a
 champion on this issue. The people who have gone through this
 must be listened to, because the impact of what happened is so far
 beyond what the headlines can tell you or what the official
 reports will contain.
 			</p><p>It is also imperative that the issue of building
 safety codes, which seems arcane, which seems somewhat a bit
 extra, as opposed to a core issue has to be moved to the front of
 the list. A group of New Yorkers led by family members who lost
 their loved ones has made this a crusade that is imperative it be
 learned from and looked at around the country, just as after the
 earthquake in California. The Clinton administration's FEMA
 officials made recommendations along with the state of California
 for increasing building safety codes when it came to earthquakes.
 We have to do the same when it comes to infrastructure that is
 vulnerable, heavy populated areas where the building codes need to
 be looked at. And this is an issue that obviously is sensitive,
 because it crosses jurisdictional lines. But people need to know
 what we have learned from this terrible tragedy.
 			</p><p>Similarly, when we look at the resources for our frontline
 soldiers, I have said repeatedly that we now are fighting a
 two-front war. We are voting on our DOD authorization today. It
 is going to be everything we possibly can think of that is needed
 by our men and women in uniform. We are not doing the same for
 our fire fighters, our police officers, our EMTs, our public
 health and hospitals.
 			</p><p>This is something that I feel particularly strongly
 about, because here we are in a budget crunch, and in New York
 City we are closing fire houses. Now, granted you hope that you
 never have to use a fire house. But how can we possibly have a
 plan to minimize and prevent the effects of terrorism when we are
 not looking at the infrastructure we have to finance and maintain
 no matter what happens? Our public health system, our hospitals
 are under tremendous financial pressures. They know what they are
 supposed to do. They are not getting the help they need to do it.
 			</p><p>I also have taken on as an issue the health screening and
 tracking of those who worked and volunteered at Ground Zero. And
 this goes to a longer-term issue, but I would hope that you would
 include it in your consideration. When the terrorist attack took
 place, and those enormous buildings collapsed, the air was filled
 with chemicals of all kinds. We did the best we could. We didn't
 have, frankly, the legislative authority for EPA to do what was
 needed with a lot of the testing, outdoor and indoor, and we have
 been playing catch-up. That needs to change. Similarly, the
 people who were there at Ground Zero day after day -- the police,
 the fire, the construction workers, the volunteers -- all are now
 eligible, because of legislation we passed, to have their health
 tracked. We have a program at Mount Sinai Hospital -- I will
 submit the findings of that to you. Twenty five percent of the
 people who are being screened have serious respiratory functional
 problems; up to 50 percent have stress, including post-traumatic
 stress disorder. The long-term impacts of these terrorist attacks
 are things that have to be taken into account as we plan for not
 only prevention, but appropriate response.
 			</p><p>We had over 1,000 schoolchildren who were evacuated, who
 were very close to Ground Zero; about another 1,000 who were a
 little bit further away. We were able to get some additional
 counseling money for those children. The needs of different areas
 of population, when we think about how best to prepare, has to be
 included. Similarly, the related impact that could come from not
 just building collapses -- and this is something my colleague
 Senator Corzine has been the champion of -- chemicals, biological,
 radiological. I don't think we have even begun to figure out how
 best to be prepared in the event of such attacks occurring in
 especially heavily populated areas.
 			</p><p>So I want again to thank the commission for undertaking
 this important mission -- and I view it as a mission. You know,
 there come times in nations' histories when we are called upon to
 really reach down deep and summon up what it takes to respond and
 move forward, and I think this is one of those times. And it is
 troubling to me that 18 months later I don't think we have put the
 resources, I don't think we are prepared. We've certainly made
 progress, and I give the administration and Secretary Ridge and
 others enormous credit, because we basically had to start from
 ground zero.
 			</p><p>I remember in the 1980s when there were a series of
 research tests carried out by researchers in Canada, Israel, Japan
 and Europe, where they left unattended baggage, suitcases,
 backpacks, in public places like airports, bus stations, train
 stations. In other countries people reported it. In our country
 people walked by or kicked it out of the way. So this is not just
 a task for government. This requires a significant culturalmental-
 attitudinal psychological change amongst our people. And I
 look to you to give us both the guidance and the impetus to try to
 do what needs to be done.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you, Senator Clinton. Senator Corzine,
 who by the way was I think almost the very first one to call on
 the creation of this commission, to offer his help and support,
 and has been there with us every step of the way. Senator, thank
 you, and welcome.
 			</p><p>SEN. CORZINE: Thank you, Governor Kean, and Congressman
 Hamilton, and all the commissioners. Let me also express what I
 know all of my colleagues feel, an appreciation for the service
 you are giving to deal with something that I think is truly vital
 to the American people. It certainly is to those of us who live
 in the affected areas.
 			</p><p>As I am sure you know, as the governor suggested, I was
 one of the original co-sponsors in December 2001, I think the date
 is important to remember, to establish this commission and to
 review the circumstances that surrounded the attack. I hope that
 you know that all of us, and I certainly have been intent on this,
 to make sure that you are fully funded, that you are fully
 staffed, that you are fully equipped with the authorizations and
 the efforts to carry out your mission. It is too important to not
 have the tools to make sure that you can do the job that you have
 been asked to do.
 			</p><p>It is clearly a difficult task, but it is critically
 important that it is done and it is done thoroughly, credibly, and
 let me say expeditiously. It is imperative that you demand access
 to all the relevant materials, that you develop findings that lead
 to recommendations that will strengthen America's security. It's
 really about the future maybe even more than it is a review of the
 facts.
 			</p><p>To do otherwise, in my belief, and I think probably in
 yours as well, would be disrespectful to the thousands of people,
 thousands of innocents who paid an ultimate price because of
 mistakes in judgment, sometimes worse, sometimes not because of
 intent, but because of mistakes that preceded September 11th.
 			</p><p>But analysis of history aside, the root of this is how do
 we keep America safe for the future? The terrorist attacks of
 September 11th unmasked many vulnerabilities. We just heard
 Senator Clinton review a number of those areas that we need to go
 back in a very disciplined and thorough manner, review. History
 may not repeat itself, but as Will Rogers said, it often rhymes.
 And I think your job is to make sure that when that rhythm comes
 out that we have looked and done those things that create the
 greatest safety for us. We need to learn from the lessons of
 history.
 			</p><p>And, by the way, I am very much of the view that this is
 not about finding blame, assigning blame. This is about genuine
 reform and accountability going forward. And I have to say I
 heard Senator Cleland mention this, it almost makes your blood
 boil when you pick up a newspaper today and see that the CIA is
 conducting a postmortem analysis of the difference between
 intelligence before the Iraqi conflict and what we have learned
 today. And why we haven't had the same--and this is not the
 Commission's problem--but why we haven't had the same incentive to
 do the look-back and the lessons learned that are so imperative I
 think to make the world a safer place.
 			</p><p>In my view, and I say this absolutely with confidence, we
 are irrefutably tardy in carrying out this analysis with respect
 to 9/11. And, again, it's not the commission's problem, but this
 society needs to do it. And as a person who used to be involved
 in more than my fair share of mistakes in a world that I came
 from, one of the absolute essentials of serious management is to
 go back and understand what went wrong, so that you can prepare to
 make the world a better situation in the future. And I just
 believe we have fallen short on that, and I commend you for your
 efforts, but I also say it is one that needs to be brought to
 conclusion.
 			</p><p>I find it almost hard for me to understand that we have
 already set about the greatest merger and acquisition effort in
 the creation of the Department of Homeland Security without doing
 the kind of work that I think sets the framework for how we deal
 with this. You know, it's almost every day that we get a call or
 two, or five or ten, to my office from victims' families seeking
 advice and support. All of them are struggling with the victims
 compensation fund. There are enormous challenges for people. We
 cannot let this tragedy not be a motivation for us to move
 forward. Seven hundred of my fellow New Jerseyians, Governor
 Kean's New Jerseyians, people in my hometown, 11 in my hometown,
 innocent people who were working hard lost their lives. We must
 accept this as a responsibility to move forward with the
 accounting.
 			</p><p>I agree that we need to turn to many of the families for
 the lessons, many of the people who were involved in the immediate
 aftermath, to learn those lessons.
 			</p><p>I'm just going to quote Kristin Breitweiser, whose
 husband Ronald was killed in the World Trade Center, somebody from
 New Jersey, who said the 9/11 families and the country have waited
 long enough for answers. Each day of delay is another day that
 this country remains vulnerable and perilously at risk to another
 terrorist attack. Pretty common sense. We have all waited long
 enough. I know you understand the weight of your assignment. You
 have friends in the court of Congress to make sure that you have
 the ability to deal with all those various issues -- immigration
 policy, counterterrorism, the turf issues that we know exist, and
 how we put together the cross- fertilization and the information,
 the preparedness of first responders and on and on. I just want
 you to know, as I know you'll hear from all of us, we stand ready
 to do what is necessary to make sure you have the resources and
 all of the other elements that are necessary to pull this together
 in an expeditious and thorough and serious manner.
 			</p><p>I appreciate the opportunity. I stand prepared to work
 with you and for you to make sure that this comes out in a way
 that the American people are more secure after your efforts,
 because we have the information and we have learned and looked at
 the lessons that can be learned. I thank you for your service.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you, Senator Corzine.
 			</p><p>We are glad to be joined by three more people who have
 been very supportive of this whole effort: Senator Schumer,
 Congressman Nadler and Congressman Shays. Senator Schumer?
 			</p><p>SEN. SCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I very much
 appreciate the opportunity to be here and the work that you are
 doing. I want to just say two things preliminarily about people
 in this room. First, when I look up at the panel here, I know
 about half of you personally, and others not personally -- more
 than half personally -- it gives me confidence. And I want to say
 that to both the families who pushed so hard for this and for the
 American people. This is a Class A group of people. Every one of
 them has a reputation for honesty, for thoroughness, for
 integrity, and I think we can have a lot of faith in the results
 of what this panel does based on the membership of the panel. So
 I thank you for serving your country at a time of real need.
 			</p><p>Second, I do want to thank the families who pushed so
 hard. I don't recognize everybody here, but I know we have
 someone from the Petrocelli family, and the day we read all the
 names on the first anniversary, I was with Mr. Petrocelli's widow,
 learned all about him. We have the Barkow family here. And as
 well we have Ms. Gutwilick (sp), who lost four employees and has
 made this sort of a crusade. There are probably other family
 members here, too, that I don't see, but I thank them for coming.
 			</p><p>You know, we know, that without the efforts of the
 families, this panel wouldn't have happened. And it's a noble
 thing, when you lose a loved one, instead of simply cursing the
 darkness, to do something to correct, to change, to improve. It's
 a hard thing to do, because the hole in your heart never goes away
 and you're not as strong maybe as you once were.
 			</p><p>And so I want to commend the families who are here and
 all of those who really made this panel happen by their
 dedication, by their sincerity, and by their spirit of generosity
 to make sure that what happened to their loved ones doesn't
 happen, as best we can, in the future. So I thank both groups for
 being here on each side of our little table today.
 			</p><p>I also want to thank my colleagues. We've worked
 together as a team, Democrat, Republican, from the tri-state area
 to do the best for our community after this horrible blow
 occurred. We've accomplished some things and we have a long way
 to go.
 			</p><p>Let me just say that, you know, the bottom line of this
 panel is simple, and I want to just add to something my colleague,
 Senator Corzine, said. If this panel were just constituted to
 find blame, it might make a few people feel good but it wouldn't
 be doing its mission.
 			</p><p>The reason we're finding out what went wrong is so we can
 correct it in the future. And the great resistance to forming
 this panel befuddled me. A nation that is unwilling to confront
 truth, they almost always fail. They almost all tend to be secret
 societies, dictatorships, where the truth is abhorred.
 			</p><p>We're a grand and great democracy, and the fact that we
 are seeking this truth is a testament to the strength of this
 country. And I just wish it had happened a little quicker, and I
 never understood the resistance. I never understood the
 resistance. But I think, again, that is gain said by the strength
 of this panel. Now, the bottom line is that to me there are so
 many things that this panel can do, I don't know how you're going
 to deal with all of them. Obviously information; why all the
 little signals beforehand didn't add up into a big comprehensive
 picture that we could see. We've changed in the way we're dealing
 with information.
 			</p><p>Yesterday I met with the leaders of this new agency in
 Homeland Security, TTIC, which coordinates information from all
 the intelligence agencies. I guess we'd like to know from you,
 and this is more normative, will this TTIC do the kinds of things
 that weren't done before 9/11? Will it work? Do we have to
 change the structure?
 			</p><p>In other words, I guess if I had a message for the panel,
 be as prospective as possible. Look what happened in the past,
 but give us some recommendations. You know, the war on terrorism
 is not going to be over in two or three years. In a certain
 sense, our society is where we were in 1946. In '46 we had beaten
 the Germans and Japanese. The average American's-- you know, their
 view was, "Let's put our feet up on the table, relax and forget
 the rest of the world."
 			</p><p>And all of a sudden we see this huge Russian monolith
 staring over our shoulder, and we don't know how to react. And we
 make a whole lot of wrong turns at the beginning. McCarthyism in
 the '50s, Vietnam in the late '60s. And finally we figured it
 out, and praise God, we vanquished communism.
 			</p><p>We're at the very beginning now, and I think we all have
 to approach this with a bit of humility. Nobody knows what to do.
 The only people I resent are not the people who disagree with me,
 but people who think they have all the answers, because no matter
 how smart we are, both in our own minds and with computers able to
 assemble all this information, we don't have enough of an
 experience pool to know how to vanquish terrorism, which is a
 simple phenomenon, simple in describing it, which is that
 technology empowers small groups of people to do terrible and evil
 things which they couldn't do even 10 years ago. You can be in a
 cave in Afghanistan and be on the Internet if you have a wireless
 connection and learn as much about America as any of us know.
 			</p><p>And the sad fact of the matter is that if all the people
 in this room, all of us were bitten by an evil virus and decided
 to devote the next five years of our lives fanatically and evilly
 to figuring out how to do terrible damage to America in
 implementing it? The odds are too high we could succeed. We need
 answers on how to stop this.
 			</p><p>In terms of information and the failures of information,
 but more importantly on how we can pick up the signals, tie them
 into the big picture so that the norm is to find out something
 before it happens as opposed to the lucky aberration. We need
 your help on that and we need to know about coordination,
 coordination among federal agencies, coordination between the
 federal agencies and the local agencies. I think that's really
 important. I'd like to hear your advice on whether this new
 trilogy system that the FBI has set up will not make the same
 mistakes that their information systems had in the past. I've
 spoken to the director and all the people he's put in. They put
 great stock in it. Will it work? None of us want to be back here
 five years from now and say it didn't and something else happened
 and we should have known about it.
 			</p><p>Other things that I hope you'll look at, and that is how
 we deal with the openness of our borders, how we keep those and
 maintain those open borders, and at the same time prevent bad
 people who want to do terrible damage to us from coming in.
 Again, it seems to me a lot of that can be answered by technology.
 Are we doing enough?
 			</p><p>I don't know, again, if this is your domain, but one of
 the great things we're debating in America is the push and pull
 between liberty and security. How much change do we need there?
 There are some on the left who say make no change. I don't agree
 with them. You have to change in a changing world. There are
 some on the right who say we can't afford any of our precious
 liberty or we give up too much of it. They're wrong too.
 			</p><p>Where's the balance? A dispassionate, intelligent panel
 like yourselves might give us--you're not going to solve every one
 of these problems, but you might help us as we begin on this new
 path, protecting the world and America from terrorism, what
 directions we should go in and what kind of things we should do.
 			</p><p>So when I think about it, the task before you is awesome,
 not in the way my 14-year-olds use it, but in a biblical way. The
 angels, in awe of God, trembled before Him. The task is awesome.
 It's huge. You're not going to answer every question. We
 shouldn't expect it. But I think you can help us the way no group
 in America can, because you're dispassionate, you are intelligent,
 you don't have any axe to grind. I know none of you do.
 			</p><p>And so I just urge you on in your mission and pledge, in
 my small way, whatever cooperation that you need. Thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you, Senator Schumer. Congressman
 Nadler.
 			</p><p>REP. NADLER: Thank you, Governor Kean, members of the
 Commission. I thank you for the opportunity to testify today.
 And I want to share my first-hand knowledge of events that
 transpired in New York following the September 11th attacks. I
 understand this commission is tasked with making recommendations
 to improve the government's ability to detect, prevent and respond
 to terrorist attacks.
 			</p><p>I will focus my comments primarily on the events in New
 York and our reaction to the attack, and perhaps some lessons that
 can be learned. But I'd also like to provide a few suggestions on
 ways to both detect and prevent future attacks. As I toured the
 devastation with the mayor and the governor on September 12th, the
 day after the attacks, I was impressed with the plans they were
 putting in place to respond to the attacks. It was quite
 impressive the way they were mobilizing, especially Mayor
 Giuliani, the apparatus of city government.
 			</p><p>I also assumed that they would be preoccupied, of
 necessity, with the immediate problems of rescue and recovery and
 of getting the economy, especially Wall Street, back on its feet.
 I further assumed that many problems faced by local residents--and
 most people don't realize that 25,000 people live in Lower
 Manhattan below Chambers Street--that many of the people faced by
 local residents and small businesses would fall through the
 cracks.
 			</p><p>Therefore, on September 13th, we formed the Ground Zero
 Elected Officials Task Force to coordinate the efforts of all the
 local elected officials from the area. The main goal of the task
 force was to assess the needs of the community of Lower Manhattan
 and to ensure that those needs were addressed by the appropriate
 government agencies.
 			</p><p>When you pull together the staffs of several different
 city council members and state assembly members and state senators
 and a congressional office and a borough president, you have a
 formidable outreach organization that can ascertain the most
 urgent problems facing residents and businesses in the area and
 can work toward adjusting those problems.
 			</p><p>We could also and we did perform a triage function by
 fielding thousands of calls that we intercepted that didn't have
 to go into FEMA or the mayor's office from people seeking help and
 distilling from them the most crucial and immediate tasks to press
 on FEMA and on the mayor's and governor's people.
 			</p><p>We started by giving them first the daily memo of saying,
 "Here are the two or three emergency things you must do right
 now," and then it became every two days and then twice a week and
 then once a week and so forth. And I just say, that worked well
 for the first three weeks to a month after the attack. And after
 that, some of the normal bureaucratic imperatives reasserted
 themselves and these government agencies became less responsive.
 			</p><p>This is one example of the kind of thing I'm talking
 about. While many people were evacuated from their homes, many
 more remained behind, especially senior citizens, who were, in
 effect, trapped in some of the major housing developments in the
 area. These seniors needed to get food and water and medications,
 but all the pharmacies in the area were closed. There were armed
 guards preventing anybody from crossing Canal Street to get to
 Lower Manhattan, and no one and no supplies could get through.
 			</p><p>So we had to ensure the delivery of medicines and food
 and water and so forth to those who needed it in the days
 immediately following the disaster, despite the fact of the armed
 guards and the total blockade of the area, which was there for
 good reasons but hadn't really thought of this problem, and
 despite the fact that all the pharmacies which had the
 prescriptions for all these people were closed.
 			</p><p>We managed to do that. And one of the things we had to
 do was get the governor, for example, to suspend enforcement of
 the state law that prohibited a pharmacy from filling a
 prescription on file at a different pharmacy which was closed and
 therefore unresponsive to telephone calls.
 			</p><p>So we handled a lot of these kinds of problems that
 really no one had anticipated. And as I said, the governor and
 the mayor's people were focused on getting Wall Street running
 again and rescue and recovery, and someone had to do this. The
 Elected Officials Task Force stepped into the breach.
 			</p><p>And one thing you might consider is seeing if there's
 some kind of mobile mechanism you can set up or recommend perhaps
 to local governments to deal with these kinds of problems that
 might get overlooked in, God forbid, the event of some future
 disaster in the normal course of events.
 			</p><p>On the legislative level, of course, it was imperative to
 get tremendous aid into New York. And Senator Clinton, Senator
 Schumer and the president led the effort on this, and the
 congressional delegation. President Bush was quite responsive,
 for which we are very appreciative.
 			</p><p>But we also realized very quickly that the attack was
 devastating to small businesses all over the downtown area, not to
 mention to the tourism and entertainment industries all over New
 York City, and that the existing loan programs in the Small
 Business Administration would be wholly insufficient to begin to
 meet the needs of devastated small businesses.
 			</p><p>Most of those programs are predicated on the assumption
 that you can lend money to a small business which may have
 suffered physical damage, which can then fix the physical damage
 and amortize the cost over a period of time and repay a lowinterest
 loan, or on the assumption that a small business will
 have a business interruption of maybe a few weeks. And that cost,
 again, can be amortized, you know, when you get back into shape
 and you can repay a low-interest loan.
 			</p><p>But some of us immediately realized that what you're
 dealing with here were small businesses that might have, by
 government edict, no access for weeks or months because there are
 armed guards saying, "You can't go to that small business because
 it's below Canal Street," so several months of 100 percent
 business interruption, followed by a 40 or 50 or 60 percent
 business interruption that might last for years because 100,000
 people, 100,000 customers, suddenly weren't there. Because they
 weren't going to be there maybe for years, and that these
 businesses, if they were going to survive, were not going to be
 able to repay loans, which was the only federal government relief
 available.
 			</p><p>So we worked very hard to establish a program, a federal
 program, to provide direct grants to small businesses to cover
 their losses. And this was done, although I would say that the
 amount of money that has gone into it has been insufficient and
 the grants too small.
 			</p><p>Hundreds of people were helped by the mortgage and rental
 assistance program, which was essential in the wake of the
 attacks. This provision should not be allowed to expire. And
 there is legislation pending to extend the program. When disaster
 strikes and thousands of people are forced from their homes, it is
 essential to have in place a system to help families find
 immediate shelter.
 			</p><p>Our office also worked closely with FEMA. FEMA funds, of
 course, paid for the cleanup of the debris, which was accomplished
 very quickly, and I applaud them for that. However, possibly
 because they had other pressing matters to attend to, FEMA was not
 nearly as responsive to local residents and local business people
 as I would have liked.
 			</p><p>My office had to usher a good number of people
 through the FEMA process and to open doors for them simply so they
 could get the aid they were entitled to by law. People should not
 have to rely on a congressional office to access the aid they're
 entitled to in the aftermath of a disaster, and perhaps some
 better procedures could be put into place through your
 recommendations.
 			</p><p>Additionally, it is clear that many OSHA standards
 designed to protect the workers were not followed in the cleanup.
 I understand that in the haste to get as much done as possible in
 the first days, when there was still hope of rescuing people who
 might have still been alive buried in the ruble, there may have
 been a lag time in instituting safety procedures. And I am more
 than willing to say that in the immediate aftermath of the attacks
 there was considerable confusion, to say the least.
 			</p><p>But a short delay in instituting safety procedures is not
 what happened. Some workers on the site were never given the
 correct personal protective equipment, such as respirators, to
 protect themselves against the hazardous debris and fumes.
 Testimony at the EPA Ombudsman's hearings stated that many police
 officers worked on the pile without respirators for 41 days,
 despite repeated requests to be equipped with respirators. And
 there were thousands of respirators lying around in National Guard
 armories all over New York City that were never used--a failure of
 communications. This is inexcusable.
 			</p><p>The term World Trade Center cough should never have
 entered our lexicon. Now that it has, however, the government
 must commit to funding lifelong--and this is something that
 Senator Clinton has been particularly energetic in pursuing and I
 commend her for it--to funding lifelong health monitoring,
 including physical examinations of all the people whose lungs were
 damaged, whose health was damaged by their work at the World Trade
 Center.
 			</p><p>And I must say that there were really three different
 environmental problems that we have to look at, and too often no
 one has made the distinction between the -- among the three
 different problems. One problem were people caught in the
 immediate aftermath who were there, who were engulfed in the
 debris cloud, who ingested unavoidably for several hours perhaps,
 every contaminant known to man. And there's nothing that could
 have been done to prevent the damage done to them, and all we can
 do for them is follow-up, monitor their health, and provide
 whatever assistance we can, perhaps for their lives.
 			</p><p>The second problem are the rescue workers, who I just
 referred to, much of the health damage to whom could have been
 avoided had we had property safety precautions after the first
 couple of days. But again, that's past tense. There's not we can
 do about that now except to do follow-up, proper follow-up,
 monitoring, and providing health services as long as they need it,
 and putting into place procedures to make sure that that doesn't
 happen again. That could have been avoided, and God forbid, in
 future occurrences, should be avoided.
 			</p><p>The third thing I'm going to talk about is the long-term
 health consequences for people, residents and who work in the
 area, which is still avoidable, still ongoing, and is the fault of
 the one federal agency whose response was grossly inadequate, and
 I believe violated the law in many ways, and that is the EPA. The
 EPA did not seriously address the presence of hazardous waste,
 such as lead, mercury, asbestos, benzene, PCBs, to name a few, in
 people's homes, schools, and businesses, brought there through the
 air from the collapsing of the World Trade Center, and continues
 to this day what can only be called a willful cover-up of the
 damage that was done and the lack of proper response that
 continues to this day.
 			</p><p>Just two days after 9/11, when EPA Administrator Christie
 Todd Whitman made a completely false statement based on no
 empirical data that, quote, "The air is safe to breathe and the
 water is safe to drink," based on no testing to that date, the EPA
 has systematically misled the public about the safety of the
 environment, and that continues to this day.
 			</p><p>In the days following the attack, the East of Hudson task
 -- I'm sorry, it's a different task force -- the Ground Zero
 Elected Officials Task Force, heard countless complaints from
 people who suffered from adverse heath effects and/or lacked the
 resources necessary to properly test and clean their apartments or
 their work spaces.
 			</p><p>When EPA was presented with such information, the agency
 either maintained that everything was safe, again based early on
 no information, and after that on inadequate testing, or claimed
 that the City of New York was in charge of indoor environments and
 that EPA had no authority for ensuring indoor air quality.
 			</p><p>Now, I must say that when we get to the question of their
 authority, I believe the EPA not only had adequate authority but
 was mandated by law to do what they have refused to do to this
 day, and in fact I will commend to the Committee a white paper
 published by my office in April of last year doing an extensive
 legal analysis of the authority of EPA, and of the mandate for
 EPA, a mandate they have not pursued, they have not fulfilled,
 authority not in the Clean Air Act, which is what they usually
 refer to to mislead people, but in the CERCLA act, which is
 commonly referred to as the Superfund act, and in Presidential
 Decision Directive 62, issued by President Clinton in 1998.
 			</p><p>The agency maintained their position, even after being
 presented with independent air quality air test results conducted
 by long-time EPA consultants and contractors, which showed grossly
 elevated and unsafe levels of hazardous materials inside downtown
 apartments. This situation made it very difficult to address the
 mounting casework from constituents who had literally nowhere to
 go to get hazardous waste out of their homes. Citizens were left
 to fend for themselves, often ended up in court proceedings
 against their landlords and building owners, and expended vast
 resources on a cleanup downtown that was not conducted adequately.
 And when you consider that the average cost of properly cleaning
 up an apartment is probably on the order of $8,000 - $10,000, you
 have to realize why this was not within the means of most people,
 a clean-up that was not conducted adequately or systematically,
 but on an ad hoc basis, if at all.
 			</p><p>The EPA only began, and I must say, city agencies and
 state agencies only began to respond at least verbally to this
 problem after pressure from U.S. Senate hearings conducted at the
 request of Senator Clinton at the end of January 2002, four months
 after the disaster.
 			</p><p>After the Senate hearings, I asked the EPA National
 Hazardous Waste ombudsman, Robert Martin, and his chief
 investigator, Hugh Kaplan, to initiate an EPA ombudsman's office
 investigation of the situation. Their involvement produced a sea
 change in the relationship of my office and local residents with
 EPA. I have always maintained that EPA should use its existing
 authority to take any and all actions necessary to find out where
 all the hazardous materials went following the collapse of the
 World Trade Center, and to remediate all contaminated spaces,
 indoors and outdoors, and that New York should not be treated
 differently from other parts of the country where the EPA has
 engaged in proper response activities to hazardous waste releases
 on a smaller scale, and where Administrator Whitman, four days
 before September 11th stated in response to a different disaster,
 a smaller disaster, that it would be immoral for the EPA to expect
 residents and homeowners to pay for the cleanup. But in New York
 it was apparently moral.
 			</p><p>Ombudsman Martin and his chief investigator, Mr. Kaplan,
 were able to tell us what EPA should have done under the law,
 could have done, and has done at other hazardous waste sites
 around the country. But most importantly, the ombudsman process
 provided a forum to communicate with my constituents, to listen to
 their complaints and concerns, to issue requests for the
 production of documents and interrogatories, to hold public
 hearings, to bring in experts from around the country, to help the
 citizens understand the full magnitude of the issues, to make
 recommendations for corrective actions, and to get to the bottom
 of what the EPA could do, should have done, and was not doing.
 Through activities, the ombudsman process documented areas where
 EPA was not following the law and standard procedures that were
 followed in other cases but not in Lower Manhattan, not in the
 World Trade Center case, and recommended corrective action to
 protect the public.
 			</p><p>The key to all of this is that it was a public and
 transparent process. The ombudsman, with my office, held two 11-
 hour hearings that were open to the public, documented with a
 court reported, the transcripts of which are available to anyone.
 We heard from residents, workers, business owners, city and state
 elected officials, firefighters, police officers, parents, and the
 New York City Board of Education. We would have liked to hear
 from the government agencies, in particular EPA, but the EPA
 declined to participate and urged other government agencies not to
 participate.
 			</p><p>Except for the ombudsman, who has now been fired because
 of this and other activities, the EPA's ombudsman office has
 essentially been dismantled, and robbed of its independence, we
 were able to get a lot of information. The EPA, beginning in May
 of 2002, eight months after the disaster, decided that they would
 indulge in a cleanup, that they would establish a cleanup process
 for residences in Lower Manhattan, although they continued to
 maintain that this was not necessary, that everything was hunkydory,
 to assuage public fears. In other words, for public
 relations purposes, they said they would engage in a cleanup.
 			</p><p>The EPA cleanup plan, however, is still woefully
 inadequate in the following respects. Number one, they would only
 cleanup apartments upon request, ignoring the threat of cross and
 decontamination from uncleaned apartments and from building air
 conditioning, and HVAC systems. The EPA will test only for
 asbestos, only in the air, and not for dust on hard surfaces and
 in carpets and draperies that will get into the air over a long
 period of time. The EPA will not test for any of the other
 contaminants that were present in the World Trade Center debris,
 such as lead, mercury, dioxin, and fine particulate matter.
 			</p><p>The cleanup plan is available only south of an arbitrary
 boundary at Canal Street, as if there was a Star Trek force field
 preventing the debris cloud from going north of Canal Street or
 crossing the East River into Brooklyn and Queens, which we know
 from satellite photography it certainly did. Besides not dealing
 with many potentially contaminated areas, this presents and
 environmental justice problem.
 			</p><p>The EPA will not cleanup commercial spaces and
 schools, and EPA refuses to authorize the cleanup workers to wear
 protective gear, which will get us further people with great
 health problems, and which seem to be a clear violation of OSHA
 regulations. The EPA has developed this plan without public
 comment, has not established a citizens advisory group, or held
 public hearings. It has established an administrative record
 available accessible to the public.
 			</p><p>The EPA's cleanup plan does not comply with applicable
 laws and regulations, specifically with the National Contingency
 Plan, with OSHA regulations, and Presidential Decision Directive
 62. You could serve a great public purpose if you would examine
 this and conclude that the EPA should amend its procedures to
 follow the applicable laws and that these laws are in fact
 applicable.
 			</p><p>Let me say very briefly, on one other topic, we are not
 doing, I fear, what we must do to prevent a future nuclear attack
 by terrorists. When I first saw those planes going into the
 towers -- in real time, the second plane, I thought immediately,
 "My God, this is a terrorist attack, and thank God they don't have
 nuclear weapons." The greatest danger we face is that al Qaeda or
 some similar group will get nuclear weapons. The knowledge and
 the ability to make nuclear weapons is widely available and easy
 to do today if you have access to nuclear materials, to weapons
 grade plutonium and uranium, that's the hard thing to get. But
 there's enough weapons grade plutonium and uranium to make 40,000
 bomb sitting around in the Soviet Union, not properly guarded,
 available for sale on the black market, or through theft and
 through smuggling.
 			</p><p>We have an agreement with Russia under Nunn-Lugar to buy
 this material and make it not usable in nuclear bombs, over a 30-
 year period. We are out of our minds to do this over a 30-year
 period. We should purchase all this material immediately. For
 $25 to $30 billion, we could get legal title to all this material
 immediately. We could take it into our own care. We could make
 sure it's guarded properly and not available for smuggling to al
 Qaeda.
 			</p><p>Secondly, we must properly guard our ports. There's six
 million containers a year enter our ports. Two percent of them
 are inspected. If we fully funded the port security bill, about
 three percent, albeit better targeted, would be inspected. We
 should insist that no container in a foreign port gets put on a
 ship bound for an American port, no container until it's inspected
 by an American or joint inspection team and certified and sealed.
 Secondly, we should insist that no ship gets within U.S.
 territorial waters until it is boarded a hundred or 200 miles out
 by the Coast Guard or the Department of Homeland Security and
 searched from stem to stern because a nuclear bomb, which may not
 be bigger than a suitcase, can be anywhere on the ship, in the
 galley, in the living quarters, wherever,in the engine room, not
 just in the containers.
 			</p><p>And finally, we should equip commercial plans, certainly
 airlines with missile deflection shields. We got a warning from
 this in Kenya last year. And we can otherwise anticipate that we
 will see American planes shot down in the not too distant future.
 This is cheap enough. It can be done for $8- to $10 billion in one
 shot.
 			</p><p>I want to thank you again for the opportunity. Let me
 say also the government, as Senator Clinton said, must respond to
 the needs of first responders, must respond to the need for
 funding first responders, which it is not doing adequately.
 			</p><p>And I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify at
 this hearing. And I commend you on your efforts, and I hope that
 your work will make a great deal of difference in the future. And
 I thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you, Congressman Nadler. I welcome
 Senator Frank Lautenberg, and at this point, Congressman Shays.
 			</p><p>REP. CHRIS SHAYS (R-CT): Thank you very much. My
 statement will be less than five minutes. And I just want to
 first recognize Beverly Eckert, who is representing her husband,
 Sean Rooney, who was killed on September 11th, and Mary Fetchet,
 who is representing her son Brad, who was killed.
 			</p><p>Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton and other members
 of the commission, thank you for the opportunity to testify today
 on the events of September the 11th. In March I submitted
 testimony describing your task as a difficult and urgent one. In
 the intervening months, your mission has not become any less
 pressing or any easier. Each day, louder calls by the living echo
 the voices of those who died, asking why we still seek answers to
 basic questions about the attacks of September 11th, 2001.
 			</p><p>For residents of Connecticut's Fourth Congressional
 District, these attacks had obvious and personal impact. Family,
 friends and neighbors lost loved ones. Seventy-eight people I
 represented, or who grew up in the district, perished that day.
 Their families lost a spouse, a parent, a child, a sibling. The
 impact of their loss was immediately felt by all of us.
 			</p><p>September 11th was a wake up call from hell for all of
 us, not just because of our losses but because we as a country
 were previously warned, and September 11th exposed the extent to
 which we as a nation, our government and our people failed to heed
 that warning. I believe that we could have prevented September
 11th. We knew the terrorist threat was there. Prior to 2001,
 there were three national commissions--the Bremer, Gilmore and
 Hart-Rudman Commissions--charged with assessing the terrorist
 threat. The National Security Subcommittee, which I chair, held
 23 hearings on terrorism prior to September 11th. The
 jurisdiction of my subcommittee was rewritten in 1999 so we could
 examine the terrorist threat at home and abroad.
 			</p><p>While we received cooperation from the departments of
 State and Defense, we received little cooperation from the
 intelligence community. We sought to look at how the intelligence
 agencies communicated with each other, but we were stonewalled.
 			</p><p>It is absolutely imperative this commission not be stonewalled as
 well. And I want to concur with the comments of Senator Clinton
 that you need to come to us if you aren't able to get any
 information.
 			</p><p>It is also imperative we come to grips with the fact that
 our nation knew of the threat. Terrorist attacks against the
 United States go back more than 20 years, but a particularly
 sentinel moment was the taking of our embassy in Teheran in 1979
 and holding of our diplomats hostage for 444 days. The World
 Trade Center was previously attacked by al Qaeda, the same
 organization that ultimately destroyed it. We knew of Osama Bin
 Laden's hatred of the West and his commitment to its destruction.
 And we knew where he ate, slept and trained in relative safety.
 			</p><p>In the course of the more than 40 hearings my
 subcommittee has held on this issue, we found a pervasive
 inability or unwillingness to counter terrorism aggressively.
 Sadly, the 23 hearings we held prior to September 2001 received
 almost no attention. The media was focused on other issues.
 			</p><p>Well before 9/11, the Bremer, Gilmore and Hart-Rudman
 commissions recommended the executive branch bring greater urgency
 and focus to federal efforts by establishing a national strategy
 to combat terrorism. All three agreed our government needed to
 better reorganize, recognize that threat, develop a strategy to
 counter it, and reorganize the government to implement that
 strategy. The only disagreement they had was on how to implement
 such a strategy, in other words, how to reorganize the government.
 			</p><p>Regretfully, regrettably, there simply was no urgency in
 responding to these threats or recommendations. Deafened by our
 own Western preconceptions and biases, we failed to listen to what
 the terrorists said in Arabic. Distracted by smaller matters at
 home, we failed to understand the magnitude of their commitment to
 global terror and to our destruction.
 			</p><p>September 11th answered the one question to which we did
 not know the answer. Terrorists had the capability for mass
 destruction, but would they ever use it? Typically, tragically,
 we learned on September 11th there is no moral, political, or
 geographic red line that terrorists would not cross. Immediately
 after September 11th, I felt our primary task was to respond to
 the terrorist threat with all our time, energy and resources, with
 no distractions. Now, we need answers.
 			</p><p>I don't believe this commission will find a silver
 bullet, or a scapegoat because I don't believe there is one. If
 we're honest with ourselves and each other, we will admit that all
 of us, in varying degrees, could have been more alert. The past
 administration, this administration, Congress, and the media all
 could have done a better job.
 			</p><p>What my constituents ask now, particularly the families,
 is that we find and tell them the truth, the whole truth, and
 nothing but the truth, whatever that is, and wherever it leads.
 You can, and I know you will be thorough and dispassionate in the
 vital work that you have undertaken, and we in turn can trust the
 results of your investigation and learn from them.
 			</p><p>Thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you very much, Congressman, Shays.
 Senator Frank Lautenberg.
 			</p><p>SEN. FRANK LAUTENBERG (D-NJ): Governor Kean, Lee
 Hamilton, lots of good friends up there. Max Cleland, and Slade
 Gorton, and Jamie Gorelik, and Ben-Veniste, Richard. You have a
 distinguished panel and wonderful, I think, patriots and ambitious
 workers and the others, oh, Tim Roemer, I -- I know just about
 everyone -- John Lehman -- and I'm confident that you will do the
 work that's required.
 			</p><p>And while I doubt that all of the questions, and I
 think Chris Shays just said it, all of the questions that stand
 out there will never quite be answered. But we don't know how much
 we can find out about this until the work that you do and the work
 that others are doing is complete. So, we urge you on and commend
 you again for the task you've all agreed to undertake.
 			</p><p>Nearly 700 New Jersey residents were killed in the attack
 on the Trade Center on September 11th. Our states and our
 citizens suffered enormously, and we continue to suffer. Thinking
 of that day still pervades the minds and activities of people
 across the world. As luck would have it, I was on another trip,
 and I had made a stop in Israel on that given day, where I was in
 a bullet-proofed bus going through the Gaza area, and to watch the
 citizens there weeping for America, weeping for themselves at the
 same time, because we all know that we were blighted something in
 our lives that would change perhaps our views and our activities
 forever.
 			</p><p>The commission has an enormous responsibility, which is
 to prepare a full account of the circumstances surrounding the
 September 11th attacks and to provide recommendations on how our
 country might guard itself against future attacks. I can't get
 over the fact that you've got 500,000 pages of information to
 review, and lots of them classified, which reduces the amount of
 staffing that you can get. I served on the Intelligence
 Committee, and one of the worst parts was that you never had
 enough staff to help you remember the things that you had to put
 together. It's going to be a difficult task, but I know that you
 are going to do a thorough job.
 			</p><p>And I would point out, however, that the thousands of
 families most directly affected by September 11th are growing
 anxious and impatient. A person I know, Patty Cazaza (sp) of
 Colts Neck put it this way: "I'm concerned that we're 20 months
 past September 11th and the Commission has been running for about
 five months, but we're just getting into the investigation phase
 of our work." She lost her husband in the attack, but that's her
 point of view. A woman who is working in my office in Newark,
 Jennifer Jacobs, lost her husband Jason, she volunteered in my
 office solely to serve as a liaison between the families and my
 office to see where we can be of help. We want to. She tells us
 that the families have suffered greatly. They're having problems
 with the compensation fund. They feel a growing frustration that
 the federal government is moving too slowly on too many fronts.
 And by the way, that view is probably going to last with us for a
 long time, because what people really want down deep is the
 restoration of the families, the restoration of the lives that
 they knew and treasured so well.
 			</p><p>My daughter, who worked on Wall Street for a long time,
 had a friend when the two of them were at the firm Lehman
 Brothers, and my daughter went off to law school and her friend
 went to work at Cantor Fitzgerald and perished that day, leaving
 three young children behind, and her husband refusing to accept
 the fact that she was gone. He toured the hospitals in the area
 day after day after day looking for some kind of a sign that there
 had been a mistake in identity that she might be alive. But the
 best is that her son, a very bright young man, is working at the
 remnant firm -- remainder firm is really a better word, of Cantor
 Fitzgerald, and I met him just a couple of weeks ago, and he's
 enthusiastic about carrying on his mother's tradition.
 			</p><p>The Commission can't replace the loved ones lost on
 that terrible day, but it does have the ability to help relieve
 some of the grief. Americans want and need to know how their
 government may have failed them and Americans want and need to
 know that their government is doing everything possible to prevent
 another such tragedy.
 			</p><p>And I know that you will keep your shoulder to the wheel
 so that the Commission not only does a thorough job but does it as
 quickly as possible also. It's about accountability. And I think
 one thing this commission can do that would help is to review
 something that we've talked about regularly here, and that is the
 color-coded alert system.
 			</p><p>I don't know whether you have input there, but I'm going
 to be quite frank with you, as my name and my character indicate,
 I think. I don't think that this system is doing anything other
 than scaring the hell out of people. And perhaps you can make it
 more meaningful and more helpful to us.
 			</p><p>There is that old expression, "You can run but you can't
 hide." We can't hide from the fact that we're being stalked,
 apparently, at all times. And what would we -- what should we do?
 Do we all retreat to our houses and not leave? I get calls in my
 office and I wonder if Senator Clinton gets the same thing.
 "Well, I'd like to come to New York. Do you think it's safe? You
 know, we'd like to take the kids to Disneyland. Dare I venture
 that far, you know, take that kind of a trip?" And since the
 color is yellow or orange, without specific knowledge.
 			</p><p>I think that citizens have a right, the country has an
 obligation to tell people if they're in imminent danger. But if
 the danger is somewhere in our 3,000-mile width and our 2,000-mile
 depth, what do you do? I don't know whether it's as much a
 concern in the plains of Kansas or the mountains of Colorado,
 where I have a son and a couple of grandchildren. What does one
 do?
 			</p><p>So I think it ought to be reviewed. We need to face up
 to the fact that we're dealing with terrorists. That is
 permanently in front of us. If anyone ever has to travel, if you
 go to a building in a large city, New York among them but any of
 them, you check in, you take your time, you show your ID and
 things of that nature. You get a plastic knife when you get on
 airplanes, still leaving you with a pointed fork and glasses you
 can break.
 			</p><p>These are the reactions of a country. There is something
 about America that you can really love, and that is there's a
 certain naivete that creeps through us all the time, as
 sophisticated, as good as we are at so many things. We like to
 believe in people. We like to believe that somehow or other
 there's good in most folk.
 			</p><p>This constant surveillance that we go through and the
 larger guns, the uniforms, don't make us feel any better. And
 we're about ready to embark on a study of how we build tactical
 nuclear weapons within our arsenal, and we go to war to take those
 similar kinds of weapons away from Iraq and threaten North Korea
 with the same thing, and we worry about Iran and Pakistan, India.
 Here we're telling those countries, "You shouldn't have those
 things. Put them away, get rid of them," Israel as well, "but
 we're going to build some more."
 			</p><p>So the whole thing fits into a kind of peculiar matrix
 when you think about it. There's a lot of work that we have to do
 to convince people that they can be safe, that the country is
 doing something that really registers logically as an attempt to
 protect their families. We should take prudent precautions. We
 can never be completely safe, especially if we want to retain some
 semblance of liberty. To pretend otherwise does a disservice to
 our people.
 			</p><p>As I mentioned, New Jersey suffered a terrible human
 toll, losing nearly 700 residents. The economic toll was also
 very significant. Forty-five percent of the people who commute
 into Manhattan every day come from New Jersey, Senator Clinton,
 and we want to be --
 			</p><p>SEN. CLINTON: And we're grateful.
 			</p><p>SEN. LAUTENBERG: We want to treat those people very
 nicely and not tax them. When the twin towers collapsed, they took
 with them 10 million square feet of office space. And I had
 served as a commissioner on the Port Authority before I came to
 the Senate, a beautiful space, energetic, cities in themselves,
 cities that point to the sky, but cities larger, Governor Kean,
 than many we have in our own state.
 			</p><p>Damage to surrounding buildings claimed another 10
 million square feet, and over 1,200 businesses employing 50,000
 people were displaced. Many of the major financial, insurance,
 real estate firms affected have branch facilities in New Jersey,
 which they've expanded, at least in the interim.
 			</p><p>One might think that having displaced firms relocate from
 Manhattan to New Jersey would be a boom, but this is a Frank
 Lautenberg personal view. The economies of the three states --
 New Jersey, New York, Connecticut -- are so intertwined that when
 any part of the metropolitan area suffers, especially in a tragedy
 of magnitude, we all suffer. Our region has lost 350,000 privatesector
 jobs in the last two years.
 			</p><p>New Jersey is particularly vulnerable, which gives us a
 cause for so much anxiety. Our state is the most denselypopulated
 state in the nation, eight and a half million lined
 between New York City and Philadelphia, with several large cities
 of our own, including Newark and Camden and others. New Jersey is
 interlaced with highway, transit, freight and passenger-rail
 systems that serve as major thoroughfares for the state, the
 region and the nation.
 			</p><p>We have one of the country's biggest and busiest
 airports. We have pipelines, chemical manufacturers, nuclear
 power plants, 127 miles of coastline and major ports. Three
 million containers move through the Port Authority of New York and
 New Jersey facilities each year. Just a fraction of them, I think
 Congressman Nadler mentioned, get inspected. According to the
 Coast Guard, the Port Authority needs more than $7 billion to
 bring security and emergency response capabilities up to snuff.
 			</p><p>In short, we have people, facilities and infrastructure
 that terrorists are likely to target. And yet the Department of
 Homeland Security officials think that it's more important--and I
 don't mean to criticize, because there's an enormous job there,
 and I serve on the committee of jurisdiction--.but as we go
 through trying to consolidate 170,000 employees, a budget of $33
 billion, 22 different departments of government, bring them all
 together and have them be able to make sense is a very difficult
 job.
 			</p><p>But when it's thought that it's more important to
 allocate scarce resources across the country, regardless of threat
 level, than to do other things that could, in my view, have a
 significantly different value. Earlier this year, when the
 Department of Homeland Security distributed the first round of
 emergency-responder grants, New York and New Jersey, the two
 states that suffered the most, received a per capita allocation
 well below the national average.
 			</p><p>To Secretary Ridge's credit, he acknowledged problems
 with the allocation formula and he's pledged to fix them. I think
 one of the most important things his commission can do to enhance
 our nation's preparedness is to determine, without prejudice,
 which parts of the country are most at risk. You can't do this on
 just a per capita grant, because some of the places, thank
 goodness, a lot of them, are really not at risk. You can always
 dream up a risk, but the practicality is that we've had the
 tragedies and paid a terrible price.
 			</p><p>We need to bolster our security everywhere, but the fact
 remains that, as I just said, some parts of the country are truly
 more at risk than the others. And the usual practice of
 sprinkling money everywhere to placate Congress won't enhance our
 security. In fact, it'll diminish it. Simply put, we need to get
 the resources to where they're most needed and will do the most
 good.
 			</p><p>I've got a few specific recommendations that the
 Commission may want to consider. One is we've made progress
 bolstering aviation security, especially by federalizing baggage
 screeners, moving them from private hands to government hands.
 Twenty-eight thousand people we've moved over, put them on the
 federal payroll. It's all right with me as long as the jobs get
 better done. Frankly, I have a different program to recommend.
 			</p><p>But now the administration is talking about privatizing
 air traffic control. Talk about a program that's in reverse. I
 mean, take the baggage handlers away and put them in the
 government and take the controllers, who worked so hard that day
 to direct airplanes to safe landings, thousands of airplanes in
 the sky, while all that confusion and terror was going on. It's
 like the fifth branch of our service, and it ought not to happen.
 So I hope the Commission will have some view on that.
 			</p><p>On a related note, we do need to consider rerouting air
 traffic away from our bigger cities. Given the location of our
 airports, limited air space, it would be difficult, too, to say
 the least, but we think it's something we have to consider.
 			</p><p>The twin towers didn't collapse because of the impact of
 the jets crashing into them. The intense heat of the burning jet
 fuel snuffed out the buildings' fire control system before they
 could do any good, and the structural steel melted. We need new
 federal standards for building materials and design.
 			</p><p>Many first responders serve in the National Guard or
 Reserve. Because of Afghanistan and Iraq, these men and women have
 been called up for longer and longer tours of duty, and it's
 jeopardizing our emergency preparedness at home. And I've
 introduced a bill, S. 2921, to reimburse state and local
 governments--I think Senator Clinton has something similar--who
 lose their first responders to active duty call-ups for six months
 or more ought to be compensated in a way that these communities
 can handle the cost.
 			</p><p>I've heard it said that 9/11 didn't alter the American
 character; it merely revealed it. We'll continue to recover from
 attacks. We will be stronger, in part because of the important
 work that this commission will do in the weeks and the months
 ahead.
 			</p><p>I thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for inviting me to
 testify at this important hearing, and I pledge to you my full
 support for your efforts. Thank you very much. Sorry I ran so
 long.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Senator Lautenberg, thank you very much.
 Thank you, Congressman Shays. Senator Clinton, thank you very
 much for coming and staying. And Congressman Nadler, thank you
 very much.
 			</p><p>We will reconvene at 2:00.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: We're going to reconvene. We're going to go
 on real time, not the time of that clock there, which is not
 accurate. So, we're going to start our hearing. But before we
 convene our first aviation hearing, I want to do a little bit of
 housekeeping. We've said on previous occasions that the
 			</p><p>Commission would take steps to guard against even the appearance
 of conflicts of interest involving its members. I have an
 announcement to make about the recusal of three of our
 commissioners on matters relating to commercial aviation security.
 Commissioner Thompson is a partner in a law firm which
 American Airlines is a substantial client, and he will not
 personally work on American Airlines matters during the life of
 the Commission.
 			</p><p>Commissioner Ben-Veniste recently joined as a partner a
 law firm, and Commissioner Gorelick will soon join as a partner
 another law firm at which United Airlines is a substantial client.
 Neither of them has worked or will work on United Airlines
 matters.
 			</p><p>However, to avoid any appearance of a conflict of
 interest, all three commissioners have decided to recuse
 themselves from the Commission's deliberations and recommendations
 with respect to commercial aviation security. Their recusal does
 not extend to matters relating to air traffic control systems, or,
 of course, the role of military aircraft.
 			</p><p>And now we'll turn to our first panel on aviation
 security. Anyone who is considering commercial aviation in the
 United States confronts a striking paradox. On the one hand, the
 FAA-led aviation safety system has, in the words of the National
 Research Council, provided and excellent decades-long safety
 record. Indeed, the effectiveness of that system was no where
 more in evidence than on the morning of September 11th, when the
 air traffic control system efficiently and safely ground over
 5,000 flights and did it in less than three hours. The nation,
 and the entire world, honestly owes a debt of gratitude to the
 controllers, to the FAA, to Administrator Garvey, and to the
 Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta for that achievement under
 very, very trying circumstances.
 			</p><p>At the same time, according to numerous government and
 non- governmental reports, the security side of aviation safety
 has been beset with numerous problems and instances of underperformance.
 In 1990, the President's Lockerbie Pan Am 103
 Commission, which is one of the most interesting commission
 reports of all the ones I think that have been written, found that
 the U.S. civil aviation security system is seriously flawed and
 has failed to provide the proper level of protection for the
 traveling public. The FAA, it said, was a -- and I'm quoting now
 -- "a reactive agency, preoccupied with responses to events to the
 exclusive of adequate contingency planning and anticipation of
 future threats." Now, there are similar assessments that have
 been made repeatedly in GAO and Inspector General reports,
 congressional testimony, National Research Council studies and
 other reports both before the Lockerbie Commission and after, all
 the way up to September 11th.
 			</p><p>So, today this commission begins its inquiry into
 aviation security and 9/11 attacks by looking at the civil
 aviation security system as it existed heading into that
 particular tragic day. What were its strengths? What were its
 weaknesses? What did it know about the terrorist threat? And
 certainly, how did it respond to that threat?
 			</p><p>We are privileged to have a very distinguished panel with
 us this afternoon to help us begin to answer these and related
 questions. The first panel will have Mrs. Jane Garvey, who was
 the FAA administrator in September of 2001, and thus was in charge
 of federal civil aviation security and safety on 9/11. With her
 will be Mr. Kenneth Mead, who was then and still is inspector
 general of the Department of Transportation and who has a very
 informed perspective on the operation of the civil aviation
 security system.
 			</p><p>After we have heard from them and questioned them, we
 will welcome James May, president of the Air Transport
 Association, and he's going to give us the perspective of the
 airlines, which had a significant share of responsibility for
 civil aviation security in 2001. And our final witness, Mr.
 Bogdan Dzakovic, he was security investigator for the FAA in 2001,
 and is for TSA today. And he has lodged some complaints about
 federal aviation security efforts.
 			</p><p>Before I start and recognize the witnesses, I want to
 alert everybody that, two things, one is that this hearing record
 will remain open for 14 additional calendar days and you can
 submit any additional material you'd like to, and for the
 Commission, to send your follow-up written questions. And that we
 have these lights, which will hopefully regulate the time.
 			</p><p>And with that, Ms. Garvey.
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman and
 members of the Commission, thank you for this opportunity to
 testify and to provide my perspective as administrator of the
 Federal Aviation Administration from August of 1997 until August
 of 2002. I recognize, as many before me have, recognize the
 importance of the commission's work.
 			</p><p>Today I'd like to discuss the assumptions and the
 policies that underscored the aviation security program that was
 in place on September 11th, 2001. I hope that my testimony
 contributes to an understanding of the history and helps to inform
 the recommendations that will come from the Commission's work.
 			</p><p>On September 10th, 2001, by statute, civil aviation
 security in the United States was a shared responsibility. Air
 carriers had the primary responsibility for screening passengers
 and baggage, and for applying security measures to everything that
 went on their planes. Airports were responsible for keeping a
 secure ground environment and for providing law enforcement
 support.
 			</p><p>Government's role, that is the FAA's role, was regulatory.
 By rulemaking, the FAA set the security standards for U.S.
 airports, for U.S. airlines worldwide, and for foreign air
 carriers flying to the United States. The FAA also ensured
 compliance with those standards.
 			</p><p>On September 10th, we were not a nation at war. On
 September 10th, we were a nation bedeviled by delays, concerned
 about congestion, and patient to keep moving. On September 10th,
 aviation security was responsive to the assessed threat based on
 information from intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
 			</p><p>Within the FAA, the Office of Civil Aviation Security was
 the primary office responsible for security. The FAA, as others
 may point out, was not an intelligence gathering organization.
 Threat analysis was conducted in collaboration with the U.S.
 intelligence and law enforcement communities, and based on raw and
 finished intelligence products supplied to the FAA from these
 communities.
 			</p><p>Aviation became a high-profile target in the '60s, when
 hijackers took over flights and diverted one after another to
 Cuba. But the 1970s, government responded with a series of
 countermeasures that included tougher penalties, closing safe
 havens, and the use of airport metal detectors. Those measures
 helped to stem the domestic hijacking epidemic.
 			</p><p>In the 1980s, the nation's attention was drawn to the
 greater threat overseas to U.S. carriers, first with the threeweek
 ordeal of TWA flight 847 in 1985. This attack led to
 Congress instituting the FAA's first intelligence division,
 authorizing staff overseas to work with American carriers in
 foreign airports, and the reemphasis of the Federal Air Marshall
 program for international flights.
 			</p><p>But it was the bombing of Pan Am 103 in 1988 that was the
 crucible for aviation security. The world saw the devastating
 effects of an explosive device in checked luggage. This incident
 stimulated the most significant changes in aviation security since
 the 1970s. Based on the findings of the presidential commission,
 Congress elevated the stature of aviation security within the FAA.
 It directed the use of explosive detection systems. It gave the
 FAA additional responsibility for research and heightened the
 emphasis on intelligence and threat assessments.
 			</p><p>As a result of the '90 Commission, the FAA
 established a special group to simulate criminal and terrorist
 actions and to conduct covert examinations of the effectiveness of
 aviation security systems. This red team augmented the work being
 done by the inspectors, and reported to the top FAA security
 official. Red team findings influenced screener training, led to
 changes in the computer-assisted profiling program, and helped
 direct changes in the protocol for positive bag match. In effect,
 they helped shape the policy and direction for security programs.
 			</p><p>Over the years, the U.S. aviation security community had
 its successes. A frustration in aviation security, as it is in
 safety, is measuring success, because it is the absence of
 failure. The positive results are usually unseen. Some have
 suggested that the greatest aviation security accomplishment was
 thwarting Ramzi Yousef's 1995 plan to bomb as many as 12 U.S.
 jetliners nearly simultaneously. Working with the Philippine
 authorities, the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials
 uncovered the plot to destroy U.S. passenger aircraft in the
 Pacific by putting explosive devices aboard. FAA immediately
 issued specific countermeasures for U.S. carriers operating in
 that region, and adjusted its countermeasures as more information
 about the new approaches the terrorist were planning became
 available. Thanks to solid and integrated intelligence, as well
 as to coordination among the intelligence and law enforcement
 communities, the plot was stopped.
 			</p><p>Earlier in '93, after the World Trade Center bombing, FAA
 had begun reexamining its assumptions about domestic aviation
 security. This concern was heightened given the connection between
 the recent plot and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. At this
 time, the FAA initiated discussions with the executive branch,
 Congress, and the industry on the greater domestic threat to
 aviation. The FAA achieved some consensus that domestic security
 measures in place, what we call our baseline, needed to be
 redesigned. The FAA established a baseline working group composed
 of government and outside experts. Its first meeting was on July
 17th, 1996. TWA Flight 800 crashed into the Atlantic that
 evening. It's not surprising the initial focus on the cause of
 this crash was criminal, most likely terrorists. The president
 acted, swiftly establishing the White House Commission on Aviation
 Safety and Security, or known as the Gore Commission. That
 commission's security recommendations centered on improving
 screening and countering the effects of explosive devices.
 			</p><p>At the time of the September 11th attacks, FAA had
 implemented 24 of the commission's 27 security recommendations
 assigned to the FAA, and was addressing three others through
 rulemaking. With the Gore commission's determination that
 aviation security was a national security issue, for the first
 time, significant federal funding was directed toward the purchase
 of security equipment for civil aviation, $100 million a year.
 Most of that funding was directed to explosive detection
 equipment.
 			</p><p>On September 10th, the FAA was procuring and installing
 explosive detection equipment. We were focused on improving
 screener performance through training and standards. And on
 September 10th, based on intelligence reporting, we saw explosive
 devices on aircraft as the most dangerous threat.
 			</p><p>We were also concerned about what we now think of as
 traditional hijacking, in which the hijacker seizes control of the
 aircraft for transportation, or in which passengers are held as
 hostages to further some political agenda.
 			</p><p>The most powerful weapon the hijackers carried on
 9/11 was not box cutters. It was their knowledge that our
 aviation systems policy was to get the passengers on the ground
 safely, and that meant negotiation, not confrontation.
 			</p><p>We can all share some blame in hindsight for not seeing
 the jeopardy in that policy. But it was developed and continued
 over decades as a policy that we knew from experience would save
 lives. No one had to order that policy changed. The men and
 women on the fourth airplane that crashed in Pennsylvania changed
 that policy. It will never be our country's policy again.
 			</p><p>We shouldn't make the mistake of thinking this tragedy
 was fundamentally about then-legal box cutters carried on the
 planes. We are fighting an intelligence war against small special
 operations type teams of suicide pilots, in aviation's case, and
 they will always be gaming the ways to get around the holes in
 whatever mass deployment and system-wide policies we develop.
 Such small terrorist teams which can train for years prides
 predictability of procedures and expectations above all else in
 their planning. So our job is to give them unpredictable and some
 non-publicized layers of security in our aviation system. This is
 a much more important focus than hoping we can foresee and
 intercept every potential weapon that a determined terrorist team
 may devise from seemingly harmless items in the future.
 			</p><p>We are fighting a special operations war within a public
 transportation system, and our greatest challenge may not be
 improving security. That may be the easy part. It's how to
 improve security and keep the system convenient and affordable to
 700 million passengers. The terrorists have two ways to undermine
 our aviation system: future successful attacks or the effects of
 security measures that drive away the traveling public. Our job
 is to make sure that neither one happens. Thank you very much.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you very much. Mr. Mead?
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good to be here, and
 Mr. Cleland, Mr. Gorton, in particular I recall testifying before
 you when you were in the Senate.
 			</p><p>I'd like to acknowledge the presence here today of family
 and friends who lost loved ones and colleagues on September 11th.
 Nothing we can do is going to diminish the pain in their hearts.
 But my hope is that the work of this commission will result in a
 sustained and permanent improvement in security. My testimony
 today is based on audits and criminal investigative work spanning
 a number of years, covering a broad range of aviation security
 subjects. Before my current job, I worked at the General
 Accounting Office, and was testifying on aviation security at FAA
 as it existed in 1987. So, I'll try to bring that perspective to
 bear.
 			</p><p>As you know, FAA had the responsibility for overseeing
 the security of the nation's aviation system before September
 11th, and that responsibility transferred in November '01 to the
 Transportation Security Administration. On March 1st of this year
 the Transportation Security Administration was transferred to the
 Department of Homeland Security, in what was I think the largest
 reorganization in government since World War II.
 			</p><p>At the outset, I think we believe that aviation security
 will require continuous improvement and vigilance. There is no
 such thing as an end state in this business. But it's important
 to note that the aviation security that we have today is
 demonstrably, noticeably tighter than it was before September
 11th. I think during the 16 months after the passage of that act,
 and at the direction under the leadership of Secretary Mineta,
 much has been accomplished.
 			</p><p>But I want to focus on the aviation security system in
 place before September 11th. I know that's the charge that you
 laid out, Mr. Chairman. I think that the system that we had in
 place before September 11th had in fact undergone incremental
 improvements over the years, especially in the last five or six,
 and I believe in fact provided a deterrent value for certain types
 of threats. Overall though, the model on which the system was
 based did not work very well, and there were significant
 weaknesses in the protections it provided, even for the types of
 threats the system was designed to prevent. And, as a result,
 that system has undergone fundamental change. That model has
 undergone fundamental change.
 			</p><p>I would like to speak to several attributes of that
 model, if I might. Before September 11th, the model was mostly
 based on reacting to known security threats instead of being
 proactive. That is to say that the security requirements that
 were in place were predicated largely on responding to threats
 that we had actually experienced. Examples: screening checkpoint
 security came about as a direct result of the aircraft hijackings
 worldwide during the late '60s and the '70s. In almost all those
 cases guns were the weapon of choice for hijacking the plane, and
 you can see that reflected in the system. Airport access controls
 were further strengthened after the crash of Pacific Southwest
 Airlines Flight 1771 in 1987. This was where an employee didn't
 have to go through the normal screening. He was disgruntled, I
 think an ex-employee, smuggled the gun onboard a plane, fatally
 shot his supervisor, the pilot and co-pilot. And shortly
 thereafter requirements designed to address that threat were
 implemented. Check baggage security, as the chairman mentioned,
 was strengthened during the '90s after the bombing of Pan Am
 Flight 103. And I could go on. Security underlying that model and
 the assumptions on which the pre-9/11 aviation security model were
 predicated did not envision a scenario of commercial airliners
 being used as a weapon, or the use of box cutters by individuals
 who were prepared to die in the commission of their terrorist
 acts.
 			</p><p>Now, the model that we have dates back to the early
 1970s. This is the pre-9/11 model. It was implemented through
 kind of an odd sense, an odd assortment of shared
 responsibilities. Industry provided and paid for the security,
 that is, the airlines and the airports. The FAA's role was to
 establish the security requirements and ensure compliance with
 those requirements. We feel that within that model there were
 strong, very strong, counterpressures to control security costs,
 because it was a cost center for the airlines, and to also limit
 the impact of security requirements on aviation operations, so
 that the industry could concentrate on its primary mission of
 moving passengers and aircraft. In our opinion, those
 counterpressures in turn manifested themselves as significant
 weaknesses in security that we, the GAO, others, including the
 FAA, repeatedly found during audits and investigative work. I'd
 like to mention some of them, and these were not new--I mean, they
 didn't just crop up before 9/11. They've been around for many
 years.
 			</p><p>First, screener performance. Air carriers were required
 to screen passengers and their carry-on baggage, and they would
 typically award the contract to the lowest bidders. Employees of
 these screening companies, they would typically get maybe 15 hours
 of training, and that was after an FAA regulation requiring it.
 They usually picked up the minimum wage. Our work has shown that
 wasn't unusual for these screeners to be getting less money than
 the starting wages for an employee in a fast-food restaurant right
 down the concourse. And those conditions, among others, resulted
 in screener turnover rates at some airports were running about 400
 percent a year. And that is going to translate into the
 performance on the screener's part. So when we would go out and we
 would try to penetrate security at FAA. Going back nearly a
 decade, we'd find that the screeners would frequently fail to
 detect items, firearms and mock explosives, at security
 checkpoints. And I can't get into the details at an open session
 here, but suffice it to say it was significant.
 			</p><p>GAO recommended performance standards for the screeners
 going as far back as 1997. The FAA reauthorization act of 1996
 directed FAA to issue a rule on certification of the screening
 companies, which in turn would result in standards for the
 screeners.
 			</p><p>The FAA first proposed the rule a year after that law was
 passed, but experienced various delays in the rule-making process.
 And I'd just like to parenthetically note for the Commission here
 I think the rule-making process is one that is worthy of your
 scrutiny, and the role that cost-benefit analysis plays in the
 issuance of rules in our system of security. As it turned out
 though with respect to this rule, ironically FAA was prepared to
 issue this final rule the week of September 10th, 2001.
 			</p><p>Another area, underutilization of explosive detection
 machines. In 1998, we found air carriers were significantly
 underutilizing explosive detection machines. The machines cost
 the government about $1 million a copy. These machines were
 capable of screening 125 bags an hour. They were certified by FAA
 at that rate. We routinely were finding that the vast majority
 were screening between 250 and 700 bags a day.
 			</p><p>Background investigation requirements. Criminal
 investigations that we conducted before and after September 11th
 showed serious weaknesses in the background checks of contract
 screener and airport workers. In October 2000, one of the
 nation's largest private security companies pled guilty to a
 felony, paid more than $1 million in fines and restitution for
 actually falsifying the criminal history checks and screening
 qualification records at one of our nation's major airports. This
 was not an isolated case. Before September 11th, little public
 attention was being given to that issue. After September 11, we
 participated in law enforcement sweeps at more than 30 airports
 nationwide, and those sweeps resulted in indictments or arrests of
 more than a thousand individuals who had falsified records about
 their identities.
 			</p><p>Positive passenger bag match. For years the carriers said
 that we can't do positive passenger bag match on domestic flights,
 it would be too costly, it would bring the system to a
 standstill. It's now being done, and the system still seems to be
 working.
 			</p><p>Airport access controls. This is where going down the
 concourse you will see doors. Those doors access into secure
 areas of the airport. During the late '90s we successfully
 accessed secure areas in 68 percent of our tests at eight major
 U.S. airports, and once we entered the secure areas we were able
 to walk on the plane unchallenged 117 times.
 			</p><p>Cargo security is another area that I think is in
 need of some improvement. FAA made some improvements. I think
 some are still in order.
 			</p><p>Covert testing. I think it's very important in our
 system that we have covert testing employed to see how strong the
 security is. FAA standard protocols for testing how well screeners
 performed used carry-on bags with a firearm or fake bomb inside,
 and they didn't have much clutter -- there wouldn't be much in
 that briefcase. And so you run up to the screen, and it would be,
 I don't know, to me it would be kind of hard to miss. It was
 totally unlike the techniques the saboteur or terrorist might use.
 But FAA did establish an outfit called the red teams, which would,
 and I understand you are going to be taking some testimony from
 another former red team member later, they did use sophisticated
 testing techniques. We were encouraged the use of those. There
 were allegations FAA tried to cover up the results of the red team
 test. We did an investigation. We did not find that they covered
 them up. What we did find though that that there was not effective
 follow-up in terms of permanent improvement.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: If we could wind up ahead on time.
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: I guess I would just like to close by saying
 that I think the new security model is based on very powerful
 lessons learned, but the more distance and time that passes
 between a security event and the current day, I think we all have
 to guard against complacency and pressures to relax security
 rules, even under the new model of security that is in place.
 Thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you very much, Mr. Mead. The
 questioning of the panel is going to be led today by Commissioner
 Fielding and Senator Cleland. Commissioner Fielding.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon.
 Thank you both very much for coming to help us today.
 			</p><p>Our task is really four-fold when we are dealing with
 aviation security, because we are trying to figure out, first of
 all, what was the state of the system on 9/11. Secondly, What
 happened specifically on 9/11? Which of course could be different
 from the particular state the system may have been. What's the
 state of the system today? And what are our recommendations to do
 everything we can to assure that this sort of thing doesn't happen
 
 again? In my first line of questioning, I would like to
 concentrate and focus on 9/11 itself. When we've reviewed, and
 from what we know up until now, these hijackers beat the system.
 Whatever it was, they beat it. We know that they practiced, we
 know that they took trial runs, we know that they must have
 figured out where the weaknesses were, consistent with their
 plans, because after all they had to be 100 percent sure they all
 got on the planes that day. So they had to test that system. And
 they gamed it, and they beat it. Painfully so, they beat it. So
 what I'd really like to figure out is, and what we all want to
 figure out is how that happened, and specifically what happened in
 the case of these hijackers.
 			</p><p>And so I guess my first question, and it's probably
 addressed to you, Ms. Garvey, is what inquiries and investigations
 were initiated after 9/11 that would have reflected and identified
 the causes and actually actions that took place on 9/11 vis-a-vis
 the hijackers?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Well, Commissioner, in some cases we really
 had the protocols already in place. In other words, we had
 security people at all of those airports, and so there was an
 immediate communication from Washington to those airports, and
 sort of direct line of communication collecting information. But
 I would say also that almost immediately the FBI obviously was
 involved. So the FBI became the sort of lead agency, if you will,
 with us gathering information for them at those airports and
 funnelling that directly to them.
 			</p><p>I will tell you quite honestly I do not know all of the
 pieces of what the FBI has uncovered. I was briefed in October.
 The question, the line of questioning I had for the FBI at that
 time is, what actions, based on what you know, I obviously do not
 need to know everything that you do, but based on what you know,
 are there changes we should be making to the system? So when you
 look back and see all the security directives that came out very
 quickly after 9/11, the new directions to the airlines, those were
 based on communications with the FBI and the intelligence
 community. What changes should we make based on what we know?
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Okay, thank you. But what we are trying
 to look for is we are trying to identify answers and also sources
 of information so that we can divine the answers.
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Right.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: So I guess what I'm also asking you, or
 both of you, I mean, if you feel there if insufficiency to an
 answer, and you can add something to do it, please do, Mr. Mead,
 but what reports were prepared by the FAA that we should be
 looking at?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: There are a number of reports that were
 prepared both by our security teams, those folks who were actually
 in the field. There were reports that were coming up literally,
 the first few days literally hourly, but then certainly daily
 reports, reports that we were getting directly to the secretary.
 So the reports are coming very quickly. They were coming orally
 and they were coming in a written fashion. But the point of
 contact, the initial point of contact, were those field
 inspectors, those agents, those people literally in the field,
 literally at the airport. They were gathering information,
 communicating it both to us and then also to the FBI. That was
 pulled in at the local level as well.
 			</p><p>Another source of information of course would be the air
 traffic control side of the house. The radar information, the
 tracking information, the air traffic control tapes, all of those
 were readily made available to the FBI. All of those, you know,
 very, very, very clearly in some cases lay out a sequence of
 events.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: I have a couple of questions about those
 I'd like to come to that, but speaking of that day, and in
 particular if you know, and if you were briefed on this, you know,
 the regulations speak of dangerous weapons. There's a
 definitional issue of what's dangerous weapons. But was there any
 evidence of, for instance, in weapons, of guns being transported
 on those planes?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: There, to my knowledge--I'm going to be more
 definitive than that. There was not. We were briefed on that.
 There was a lot of confusion, as some have called it the fog of
 war. There was a report that at one point surfaced, and it may
 have been even part of a written report that had surfaced from
 somewhere in the field -- it may even have been from American
 Airlines in particular, that spoke about a gun. The FBI to my
 knowledge, and, again, I don't know if this has changed since I
 left, but certainly when I was there the FBI looked at that. GAO
 I believe also did a report on that as well and found no evidence
 of that. It may have been something that was reported in the
 confusion. And, frankly, that's a challenge for people even going
 through the information to make sure that we are sorting out what
 really happened from what may have been some extraordinarily
 difficult moments obviously.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Mr. Mead, do you have any information that
 differs from that?
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: No, sir.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Okay, well thank you. Also, how about any
 evidence of bombs on board any of the three planes?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: No evidence that certainly I am aware of.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Okay, then going back to my prior
 question, the reason I had raised the thing about the guns was
 that there was an earlier FAA report, or reported report --
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Reported report, yes.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: -- coming out of American 11. How about box
 cutters? Have any box cutters been recovered?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: I do not know, and I would assume that
 obviously would be the FBI. I will tell you again how we
 approached it in going to the FBI and saying we are obviously
 going to make some changes here, what do we need to consider?
 Were box cutters involved? And I want to be careful about this,
 because I do recognize the sensitivity. We were certainly, if
 "encouraged" is too strong a word, I don't mean it to be too
 strong, but it was suggested that prohibiting box cutters would be
 a good thing. To the extent to which they were used or how they
 were used, I don't have that information.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Mr. Mead, anything?
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: No, sir.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: The box cutter issue is kind of an
 interesting one to us, and a little perplexing to us, because,
 candidly, as I read the regulations, a box cutter that's four
 inches was a prohibited item. A box cutter that was under four
 inches was not. Is that your understanding as well?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: That is correct, Commissioner.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: So, theoretically, if somebody went up
 with 20 three-inch box cutters, they could get on the plane,
 theoretically.
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Theoretically, yes. Twenty individual ones.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Yes, yes. I don't mean --
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: That's what you're saying.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Okay. Was there any evidence that you're
 aware of pre-positioning of weapons on aircraft?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: I simply do not know.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: How about strategic pre-boarding,
 selection of seats?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: I don't know. I think that's all part of
 the FBI investigation.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: But none of that's been brought to your
 attention.
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: No, it has not, Commissioner.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Mr. Mead? Okay, thank you. Let's go to
 the investigations. After the incident, did the FAA conduct any
 interviews of the people that had access to the aircraft? By that
 I mean the sweepers, the cleaners, anybody. Were they
 interviewed?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: We became very quickly the sort of
 supporting role for the FBI. The investigation and those
 individual interviews would have been conducted by the FBI. I
 would certainly want to check, but I would certainly imagine in
 some cases that some of the FAA personnel may have been present,
 may even have been responsible for facilitating the meeting or
 whatever. But the lead focus or the lead agency very quickly
 became the FBI.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Were there any FAA reports on this that
 you're aware of?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: There may have been some summary reports.
 I'd certainly want to go back and check.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Another thing that's always interested me
 was have they ever gone back and checked the videos, the taping of
 the screening process, when people were going through the --
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: I do know that those were turned over to the
 FBI. I do know that they were carefully reviewed.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: At both airports?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: I believe it was for both, but I know for at
 least one of them.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: You know, when you go through an aircraft,
 I mean, boarding an airliner, and you go through and occasionally
 somebody asks you to step to one side, take off your shoes, take
 off your belt, whatever it is, and then they screen you, I guess
 99.9 percent of those people then ultimately get passed on and
 passed through. But in an incident where somebody would be pulled
 aside and there would be some question, some serious question as
 to whether they could get on the aircraft, are records kept of
 those incidents?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: There are records, Commissioner, yes.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: And have those records been reviewed with
 regard to identities of people that were -- well, the hijackers
 basically?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: I know that they have all been turned over
 to the FBI, yes. Yes, Commissioner.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND: Thank you very much, Ms. Garvey and Mr.
 Mead, and thank you for your service to our country in so many,
 many ways. I just was sitting here trying to connect some dots in
 my own mind. And Ms. Garvey, when you said the most powerful
 thing that the hijackers had going for them, I thought you were
 going to say, their willingness to die. Because in many ways I
 think that's the essence of what we now know since September the
 11th, the essence of catastrophic terrorism.
 			</p><p>The fascinating thing, too, is that if the FBI as a law
 enforcement agency, which is used to gathering evidence for
 prosecution of offenders--if those offenders are willing to die,
 there's very little evidence to prosecute. There may be a trail
 leading up to that, but what do you do after that?
 			</p><p>So I think that brings us to the discussion we were at
 this morning of how do we get hold of matching foreign
 intelligence and domestic intelligence? How do we hold someone
 accountable in the government for these 15 agencies and half a
 dozen different Cabinet departments that are somehow responsible
 for just foreign intelligence? And how do we bridge that gap
 between foreign intelligence and domestic intelligence?
 			</p><p>That is a big challenge, because I do believe that part
 of this is as -- I think it was Jane Harman said, or someone else
 said, that we do have to go forward in a strategic offensive, and
 part of that offensive is intelligence to pick up, before they get
 here, people who are willing to die. So I think this has changed
 the dynamic here.
 			</p><p>May I just ask kind of a time-line question here?
 Because I said that at the outset because I do not want to miss
 the strategic importance of what has changed here. September the
 11th wasn't a hijacking. It was a hijacking, with a political
 purpose, but the means of executing that were so much different
 than anything we had experienced. The willingness to die, the
 willingness to plan for a long time, financed out of a cultural
 sense of mission against the West. This is powerful stuff.
 			</p><p>And your point about what we're up against is a special
 operations against a public transportation system and the 700
 million passengers a year or so. There are a lot of people who
 travel on subways, lots of people who travel in cars, through
 tunnels and so forth. So there are other parts of people's
 transportation system. We have to think about cargo coming into
 our country and so forth. So we have a massive challenge if we
 are indeed up against a special operations thing here, and we are,
 with the willingness to die.
 			</p><p>Tom Friedman calls these people non-deterrables. It's
 one thing, as Senator Graham was talking about, to deal with in
 the Cold War, to deter the Soviet Union through better
 intelligence and mutual assured destruction. But for people who
 are willing to die, how do you deter that? I think you deter it
 with better intelligence, for one thing, coordinated intelligence,
 and do everything you can, as you pointed out, to change the
 system from time to time and to have deterrence built in that
 nobody knows about.
 			</p><p>So I think you're on to something here, because this is a
 new era here in terms of defense. May I just ask a little timeline
 question here? You may or may not know some detailed
 answers, but I'll try to run through it. Published accounts
 indicate that Boston flight controllers determined that American
 Airlines Flight 11 had been hijacked as early as 8:13 a.m. that
 morning and that two flight attendants telephoned American
 Airlines personnel with confirmation that a hijacking occurred at
 8:21.
 			</p><p>Yet, according to the FAA official time-line, NORAD was
 not notified until 8:40, about, what, 20-some-odd minutes later.
 Is that basically accurate? Is that basically your understanding?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Commissioner, I did see the notice of the
 flight attendants. I'm not aware of that. And I will give you
 the synopsis, or the chronology as I understand it. But, again, I
 think I'd want to get the real precise numbers from the air
 traffic control people. But as I recall it, and from my own
 notes, looking back and jotting some things down, 8:20, about
 8:20, was the first indication for Boston that there was a
 problem.
 			</p><p>Now, there was no -- there is a special signal that a
 pilot can give, as I know you know, Senator, for if it's a
 hijacking or there is an emergency. There was nothing like that.
 But the transponder or the signal was lost. And so the procedure
 is to begin to contact the aircraft. And I believe, and again, we
 would want to double-check this, but I believe there was an
 attempt to raise the pilot, raise the aircraft, about three or
 four times. And they were unsuccessful.
 			</p><p>And so, at about 8:34, based on the good initiative of
 the controller and his supervisor, NORAD was actually--that was
 the first notification from the controller and the supervisor to
 Otis. It was -- the official one is 8:40, as you've suggested.
 After they did that, they then called up to headquarters, and then
 the official notification.
 			</p><p>What that said to us, and when we think about what
 protocols did we need to examine, that was one. We applaud the
 controller, applaud the supervisor, for taking individual
 initiative on taking that action, but we recognized that we needed
 to make that communication much clearer. We needed to change the
 protocol. And there are some changes. Some are classified, but
 certainly could be provided to this committee. But there were
 changes that were made that made it very clear, or made it much
 clearer.
 			</p><p>But I do want to commend the controller and the
 supervisor who at 8:34 called Otis.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND: The reason I asked that question was the
 Commission has been made aware of a communication that alleges
 that there was some kind of planned test attack, a drill attack,
 on the United States on that day, scheduled for that day, and that
 maybe some of the slippage in time, either by the FAA or NORAD,
 might have been due to the fact that there was somehow an
 awareness that whatever problem was going on in the air was a
 drill.
 			</p><p>Are you aware of any planned drill, mock attack on the
 United States, that might have just been misinterpreted by either
 people in the FAA or NORAD as just a drill, and then found out
 that something really was going on?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: No I am not, Commissioner.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND: Mr. Mead, are you aware of any drill that
 was going on that day, some mock attack on the country that we
 should have, that people might, have, slowed down their reaction,
 said, "well this is just a drill, and it's not really real," that
 might have slowed down any reaction by NORAD or the FAA?
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: No, sir.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND: Thank you very much. We have some questions
 we'd like for you to submit for the record. May I say, what is
 one of the things you carry away from this experience, Ms. Garvey,
 having in effect as head of the FAA and dealing with the
 responsibility for safety and promotion of the airline industry.
 Looking at it all, you've had time to reflect, what's one or two
 things that you really carry away from this experience, you
 mentioned your understanding that we are in a special world now,
 special operations against a public transportation system. Do you
 have some other thoughts about what that day meant to us and what
 future FAA directors or this commission should look at in terms of
 recommending to the United States government?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Well some thoughts, I will tell you, are very
 personal. And those thoughts are thoughts of anguish. As Mr. Mead
 said, I don't think any of us will ever forget the pain and the
 anguish the people of New York felt and the individual families
 felt. One thought was the remarkable work, and I appreciate the
 Chairman mentioning this, that the air traffic controllers, that
 the managers, that the pilots and the flight attendants on the
 other aircraft, many of whom knew what had happened in the system.
 I think the magnificence of the professional work done by those
 men and women is something I will certainly always remember. They
 were remarkable individual acts of courage.
 			</p><p>The inspector general and I were speaking the other day about
 the need to stay focused even as we move forward. And he mentioned
 that in his comments. There many instances, and we are probably
 are all guilty of it, where we are captured by something, we know
 its importance, but we are diverted to other things. So the
 challenge of keeping the focus, keeping the attention on security.
 But at the same time, the tremendous challenge that both the
 Executive branch, that Congress and many in the private sector as
 well, of how do you find the right balance--how do you make sure
 we are as secure as we can possibly be but also recognizing too
 that we are a free and open society.
 			</p><p>MR.CLELAND: And therein lie the great challenge for all of
 us. Mr. Mead, what do you think that you have learned, in
 understanding not only the weaknesses, and you've articulated them
 very well, before 9/11, but what have you learned that maybe we
 should still be doing, or this commission should recommend to the
 Congress or the government to do in terms of aviation safety?
 Because you know the airlines are in great trouble right now,
 people are afraid to fly for many reasons, and as the coding
 system goes up, the anxiety of the country goes up, people are
 scared. How can we go about our business in this country and not
 just live constantly in fear particularly as we fly? What are
 some of the things we ought to be thinking about, what are some of
 the things this commission ought to be recommending?
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: That's hard to put into law, I think, but one
 characteristic of the security program you're reviewing has been
 in the past that it tends to respond to empirical evidence of
 tragedy or an incident.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND: Closing the barn door after the horse is
 out.
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: Yes. And it's all meant in good faith, and
 it's a sensible thing to do. But I think we have to broaden our
 thinking to think of the different scenarios that can play out and
 give the regulators the charge to do that, and then to the
 authority to do something about it.
 			</p><p>I think when you look back over the experience with the
 system that we had in place before 9/11, that admittedly wasn't
 designed to catch box cutters, wasn't designed to catch people
 that were willing to kill themselves. But it had a lot of
 weaknesses that a lot of people knew about for many years. And I
 think our tolerance level of that has to be very low. That's one
 of the lessons of 9/11.
 			</p><p>I mentioned in my testimony covert testing. What I mean
 by that is testing that's unannounced, that's rigorous, that would
 mock what the types of scenarios would be; test the system, find
 the holes in it, and don't tolerate long delays in closing those
 holes.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND: Good guidance. And as one who was sitting
 on the Commerce Committee and was the original co-sponsor, with
 Senator Fritz Hollings and others, of the new Transportation
 Security Act, in terms of aviation security, hopefully we are
 doing a better job out there now.
 			</p><p>But I think we go back to the same point. If people are
 willing to die, it's hard to defend against. We just have to keep
 changing it, taking away some of the predictability, because one
 of the things that I've learned about the al Qaeda and some of the
 terrorists that we face is that they practice long and hard based
 on predictability. Then they rehearse. Then they get the
 committed individuals.
 			</p><p>If we can keep them off-balance, either be on the
 strategic offensive militarily, strategic offensive in terms of
 preemptive intelligence, identifying the problem before it gets to
 us, those kind of things, that we are in this war game here. And
 is that your understanding, Ms. Garvey?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Absolutely. And I think you make an
 excellent point; in addi,tion the layers of security. It's
 changing it. It's being somewhat unpredictable, and it's the
 layers of security. I think it is, Brian Jenkins or someone I
 have read, mentions keeping the veil of mystery between some of
 the layers. And I think that's an important notion and an
 important concept to keep in mind.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND: Mr. Mead?
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: Yeah, I think so. You know, I think one of
 the interesting things about security now is it's almost as though
 we're trying to cover every exigency or every possible contingency
 with the screening. And one of the big issues I see for the
 Transportation Security Administration is making sure that they
 keep the heat on. It's not going to be automatic that we're going
 to have a sense of vigilance. It's a matter that we're all going
 to have to work very hard at.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND: Good point. Mr. Chairman, are there other
 commissioners to ask questions?
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Let me follow up a question. When the FAA
 notified NORAD, what did the FAA expect or ask NORAD to do?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Well, the expectation at that point, I
 believe, was really to respond as they did, by sending planes in
 the sky.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: So is it your understanding that once you
 give them the word or notify them, then their own procedures take
 over?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Would take over, exactly.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: There's nothing further required of the
 FAA?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: No, NORAD's procedures would rule at that
 point, would prevail at that point.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: You said in your prepared testimony
 something that kind of jumped out at me. You said that the
 FAA didn't have any solid intelligence which indicated the
 type of attack that we saw on 9/11. Can you amplify that
 answer? Particularly, what level of information or
 specificity of threat would constitute solid?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Well, the evidence that we had or the
 information that we had certainly indicated a growing threat and a
 concern. But the threat was much more focused on overseas
 targets. We were concerned about American targets. We were
 concerned, to some degree, about American airlines and notified
 the airlines accordingly. But the focus was much more overseas.
 			</p><p>I have seen a number of reports, for example, in the
 paper referring to other signals, to other signs and so forth,
 and, again, repeatedly have gone back to staff to say, "Were those
 run to ground?" And that's exactly why I said solid, because those
 were run to the ground by the intelligence community, by our own
 folks with the intelligence community, and for various reasons
 were discounted as not credible.
 			</p><p>And when you say, "What would constitute it?" Frankly,
 it's really the expertise and professional judgment of the
 intelligence community.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Well, following up on that, are you
 saying that there was information of a possible use of aircraft as
 a weapon that was --
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: I was not aware of any information of it
 being used as a weapon that was credible. I'm saying that
 correctly.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: That was credible. But I assume from that
 that there may have been information provided.
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Well, you know, to me directly,
 Commissioner?
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Well, the FAA, to you.
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Well, again, there were reports coming in.
 There was a great deal of information that would come in,
 sometimes 300 messages in a day. If there was anything like that,
 it would have been run to the ground and it was not deemed to be
 credible. We were not aware of anything like that. I'm always
 hesitant, because there might have been something in that pile
 that I didn't see. But to my knowledge, there was nothing. And
 I've asked that question repeatedly, I will tell you.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: When you say run to the ground, who would
 run it to the ground?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: The intelligence community, both our
 intelligence folks and the intelligence community, whether it's
 the FBI or the CIA or the intelligence community.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Did you ever ask, in your capacity as the
 administrator, for additional cooperation or additional
 assessments or assets from the intelligence community?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: No, I did not personally. No, I did not.
 Whether or not Admiral Flynn did, obviously we'd want to ask him.
 But I did not.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: If I can ask you one quick question about
 air traffic controllers--
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Sure.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: -- as I said I'd come back to it. Did the
 FAA investigate how the air traffic control system responded on
 9/11?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Oh, absolutely, really almost the next day.
 I will tell you, for those days following 9/11, we were
 meeting almost around the clock. And what was particularly
 interesting, in terms of air traffic control, is, again, I
 think a new area for us and another protocol that perhaps we
 had not in place was really the kind of communication we were
 going to need between air traffic control and security.
 Security all of a sudden was concerned about things like crop
 dusters. What do we do about general aviation?
 			</p><p>And there was much more then of a need for a kind of
 protocol to be developed for communication with air traffic
 control. But there was also very much an assessment. How do they
 bring the planes down? It worked very well, we know. But what was
 the protocol? And a protocol has since been designed based on the
 experiences of that day.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Well, based on the existing protocols of
 that day, there was a situation where flight paths obviously
 deviated. There was a point in time when an inactive transponder
 --
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Absolutely. Absolutely. And if you look at
 the current protocol, what has been developed post-9/11, you will
 find some very specific steps that controllers are instructed to
 take. If a transponder disappears, there's a protocol that has
 been established. If they see something unusual in the flight
 pattern, essentially it is reported immediately. But it is
 spelled out in the protocol.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Well, was the protocol that was in place
 on that day observed?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: You know, was it observed for that day? I
 think so, yes. Yes. I mean, the protocols before that did not
 anticipate anything of that magnitude. The protocols that were in
 place pre-9/11 anticipated some crises, but not of that magnitude.
 I mean, we're used to crises that involve weather, Y2K, those
 sorts of predicaments, not anything of that magnitude.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Thank you. Mr. Mead, the security
 function is now transferred to the jurisdiction of the Department
 of Homeland Security. Isn't that correct?
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: Yes.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: And they have their own inspector general?
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: Yes, they do.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Given your many years of experience and
 your able service, are they coordinating or consulting with you,
 and are you consulting with them, the new IG, to ensure that
 there's a continuity of oversight?
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: Yes. Fortunately there's -- the law contemplated
 a transition period. In other words, we have about two or three
 months to talk to each other, and have done so.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Okay, well, thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: I must say, the security thing was becoming
 all-consuming in the year or so following 9/11, at least for this
 inspector general. So we passed the mantle.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: You have a little glee in your voice.
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: Yeah.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Yeah. Okay, thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: A follow-up by Senator Cleland and then any
 other commissioners who have questions.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND: Yes, sir. The point that comes through to
 me, Ms. Garvey, is that your first go-to agency was the FBI. But
 it was basically the intelligence community that dealt with
 foreign intelligence that began to pick up indications that
 airlines might be used by hijackers for destructive purposes or
 cataclysmic terrorism, or whatever, several years earlier.
 			</p><p>I mean, the notion of using an airline to crash into
 someplace and create havoc was not new to the intelligence
 community, but apparently that wasn't genuinely widely known in
 terms of, shall we say, domestic use. Certainly that was not
 something that you were privy to. Is that right?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: That's correct. Again, the threats that we
 received, particularly in the months before, the summer months
 before September 11th, were very focused on overseas targets,
 concerns about American interests overseas, but primarily
 overseas. And I remember following the news, of course, at the
 time, and there was so much unrest in the Middle East, that even
 just intuitively, just from the newspapers, that was borne out.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: I've got one brief question, then Senator
 Gorton. You talked, Mr. Mead, in your testimony about your
 recommending, and others, I guess, too, of ways in which to make
 the handlers, the checkers at the airports professional and how
 this was tied up in rule-making for maybe a number of years.
 			</p><p>My question, really--I'm not from Washington; I don't
 really understand rule-making that can tie up something that
 logical for years. Who would have been opposed to that? It
 obviously would have made people safer, might have done something
 to help on 9/11. How was that tied up in rule-making? And is
 there anything else you're recommending to make the American
 public safer that is tied up in rule-making now?
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: This particular rule...what happens when
 a rule, FAA is supposed to come up with what they call an advance
 notice of proposed rulemaking. They did so. They did so. In my
 judgment they should have done it much earlier, many years before
 they did it. But a law came around --
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: (unclear)?
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: Yes, I said before. I said in the last five
 or six years in particular there had been improvements, and I mean
 that sincerely. But FAA issued the rule in 1997, which is a year
 after the law was passed. It then had to go through the office of
 the secretary at the Department of Transportation and then to OMB.
 And different people in that process, it has been my experience,
 have different points of view. The cost-benefit analysis--
 sometimes people say, Well, is this rule that will require FAA --
 that will authorize FAA to certify screen companies and impose
 perform standards on the employees of those companies, are the
 benefits of that going to be outweighed by the costs, or vice
 versa? And if the costs outweigh the benefits, people will raise
 eyebrows about whether that rule. Well, there's no question in my
 mind that that rule was going to increase costs, because the
 quality of the people, the expenses for the training of them, was
 going to have to increase in order to meet the performance
 standards.
 			</p><p>Ms. Garvey can give a further exposition on this, but the
 point I was trying to make in raising it is before you focus in on
 FAA, while FAA was in charge, and FAA is totally responsible, I
 just wanted to mention to the Commission that there are other
 parties in government that should be spoken to as well.
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Just one additional note. Congress did give
 the ability to TSA in the last legislation the ability to
 streamline the rule-making process. And I think that would be
 worth looking at to see how successful it was. I would say post-
 9/11, when we issued a whole series of rules, there were a number
 of the sort of steps that you had to go through that were
 eliminated, and we got those out very quickly. But clearly
 there's a trade-off, because certainly we all care about an open,
 transparent process. But, again, it's finding that right balance.
 And Mr. Mead is right: this was extraordinarily expensive. The
 rule was extraordinarily expensive, and we actually pulled it back
 a couple of times because it wasn't meeting the cost-benefit
 analysis, and we kept working it and reworking it. MR. MEAD: I'd
 like to just add that I think the role of cost-benefit analysis in
 this type of area--I agree that cost- benefit analysis should be
 one of many tools, but sometimes it can play too big a role when
 we are dealing with areas like this, because how can you ask, how
 can you speculated about how many lives might be saved from
 speculative terrorist attacks if the screener is efficient at
 screening and catching various devices? It's a very tough task to
 assign somebody to do that.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: I the other part of -- by the way, I think
 Washington streamlining to me sometimes means two years instead of
 three. But the final part of my question was there anything you
 are proposing now that is tied up in rule-making? Is there any
 cost-benefit analysis for the last one would have indicated we
 ought to do it right away, to me, because it would have saved more
 lives.
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: No, I can't think of one that's pending. That
 doesn't mean one doesn't exist. And one reason for that was
 mentioned by Ms. Garvey. Under the law that was passed, Congress
 gave TSA the authority to move rules on more of an urgent basis.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Senator Gorton and then Congressman Roemer.
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON: There is a remarkable similarity in the
 written testimony that each of you have prepared in one respect
 that really stands out to me, and that is the response to
 particular challenges. And I sort of wrote them down in this
 fashion: You know, the first major challenge was the hijacker who
 wanted to go to Cuba--transportation, you responded. The second
 perhaps was the hijacker who wanted money or to free prisoners,
 the Hezbollah type. And there was a response. I think a third
 one was explosives on board without the person who put the
 explosives on the plane, and certain steps were taken to meet with
 that. And the fourth, and sort of incidental one, was the
 disgruntled employee, or former employee, who wasn't subject to
 security. And you said in each of these cases there was a
 response with respect to rules. And I think as we look back on it
 those responses were probably fairly, at least fairly adequate to
 meet the specific challenges at which they were aimed. But then
 what both of you said, I think quite accurately, was no one really
 conceived of the kind of challenge with which we were faced on
 9/11, that you would have people who were perfectly willing to be
 suicidal, to make a point who were not hijacking an airplane to
 take it someplace but to make a weapon out of it. And we have
 concentrated ever since 9/11 on how do we deal with that
 particular challenge.
 			</p><p>But the question that I have for each of you, if your
 imagination is broad enough, what's the next different challenge
 that we haven't thought about, at least thought about
 sufficiently? Has either of you, with your professional being in
 this, thought, well, this last one was very different from the
 predecessor. Is there another significant challenge out there that
 hasn't been used yet to aircraft safety and the safety of people
 on the ground?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: I think that's one of the most difficult
 questions to answer.
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON: Sure is.
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Because, and you know I thought a lot about
 this particularly in relation to safety. When you are dealing
 with safety issues -- and we have become much better with this
 with the improvement in technology, you can, the FAA is beginning
 to do this very well, which is to track trends, to look at some
 incidents and see if you can track trends. It seems to me, but
 I'm not an intelligence expert, but it seems to me that's more
 challenging on the intelligence side when you are dealing with
 human nature. And is it possible to think of every scenario? And
 I don't think it is, which is why I think we get back to layers
 and being not so predictable.
 			</p><p>I do think, as many have discussed, that while aviation
 is an important area, you certainly, as has been alluded here too,
 get awfully concerned about other modes of transportation, and is
 there something within the other modes that would be equally as
 dramatic. And I think you can quickly come to some scenarios in
 those areas of well.
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: One area I would encourage the Commission to
 explore in depth, and I imagine you would want to devote part of a
 closed hearing, closed session of this, is the area of cargo
 flying on passenger airliners. I think that is an area that in my
 judgment is not as mature, one might say, as is the handling of
 checked baggage, the passage of passengers through magnetometers
 and the like, and the use of explosive detection machines. I
 think cargo is an area you should look at.
 			</p><p>Secondly, in the other modes, perhaps some of you caught
 this in the news, but a spokesman for the cruise industry was
 responding to an announcement by the Transportation Security
 Administration that there was going to have to be some screening
 of passengers on cruise lines. And I thought that the gentleman's
 comment was instructive and clearly up the lines of the question
 you asked. He said, "Well, we are quite different from the
 airlines, we're quite a different business. This type of thing
 will bring our industry to a halt, and who is going to pay for
 it?" I have heard that before in the context of a different
 industry. But I do think that we have to think about other modes
 of transportation and the type of security we can afford, the type
 of security that is going to be provided. But you can almost see
 the drum beat beginning in some of these other modes of
 transportation.
 			</p><p>MR. GORTON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Okay, we have time for two more questions, and
 I think they belong to Congressman Roemer and Commissioner Ben-
 Veniste.
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank the
 witnesses right off. You have been extremely helpful, and I know
 we will hopefully rely on you in the future. Administrator
 Garvey, you have handled yourself very well. Let me tee one up
 for you. I am sure you will handle this one well, it's a tough
 one, it's a direct one, and it comes from some of my experience
 from the Joint Inquiry where I served trying to put together the
 information that was coming forward from the intelligence
 component here to the FAA. This is unclassified and was read from
 our report in open hearing by one of our staff members. In
 January of 1995, a Philippine national police raid turned up
 materials in Manila, indicating that three individuals, including
 Ramzi Yousef, planned, among other things to crash an airplane
 into the CIA headquarters. This information was passed onto the
 FAA, which briefed U.S. and major foreign carriers. That's 1995.
 			</p><p>In 1998, August, the intelligence community obtained
 information that a group of unidentified Arabs planned to fly an
 explosive-laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade
 Center.
 			</p><p>September 1998: The intelligence community obtained
 information that Osama bin Laden's next operation could involve
 flying aircraft loaded with explosives into a U.S. airport.
 			</p><p>In November 1998, the intelligence community obtained
 information that a Turkish Islamic extremist group had planned a
 suicide attack. Part of this would involve crashing an airplane
 packed with explosives into Ataturk's tomb during a government
 ceremony.
 			</p><p>In March 1999, the intelligence community obtained
 information regarding plans by an al Qaeda member who was a U.S.
 citizen to fly a hang glider into an Egyptian presidential palace.
 			</p><p>And in August 2001, the intelligence community obtained
 information regarding a plan to either bomb the U.S. Embassy in
 Nairobi from an airplane, or crash an airplane into it.
 			</p><p>The CIA disseminated several of these reports to the FBI
 and to the agencies, and one of the agencies it disseminated this
 to was the FAA. Now, I know that since 1991 the FAA also had,
 since the counterterrorism unit was set up in 1986, the FAA had an
 intelligence liaison officer full-time with the CIA, FBI and
 State. So my question is: You've got these different reports
 coming in from intelligence sources, you have got a full-time
 person from the FAA picking this stuff up -- now, it may not be,
 We have a planned attack on such-and- such a date, but it's
 certainly an accumulation of evidence from intelligence sources
 that the FAA has access to that this could be a scenario that
 happens in the United States. It's being planned, it's being
 talked about all over the world. Why didn't the FAA do more to
 look at the possibility that this could happen in the United
 States?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Well, first of all, the 1995 incident that
 you referred to, I think the first one you began with, in fact
 that is one where a series of countermeasures were developed
 literally as we learned information. And in fact that is one
 where the appropriate action was taken and the plot was thwarted.
 			</p><p>The other ones, I'd like to go back and provide some
 information to you for the record. I can tell you that again, the
 threat assessment that we were getting, and that we were letting
 the airlines know about, was very much focused on overseas
 targets, overseas U.S. interests. That's really where the
 emphasis was.
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: But that '95 incident was Langley, Virginia.
 It wasn't overseas.
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Right. But again, I think that is an
 example where we did take the appropriate measures. And again I'll
 go back and say in each one of these cases or -- I'd like to
 provide more information for the record -- but in any number of
 those cases, again working with the intelligence community, it was
 tracked down and the source was deemed either not credible, or the
 -- or most likely or most generally the source was not credible.
 But it was --
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: But, administrator, how do we get this
 intelligence capability where FAA has a permanent stand-up
 capability within CTC to communicate these things to the top level
 of the FAA, and then hope that these administrators will at least
 evolve plans? Mr. Mead said that the 1970s plan did not really
 evolve much over the last 20 or 30 years. You kept targeting a
 hijacker and these other plans kept coming at you. How do we set
 up the intelligence component with the top people at the FAA to be
 proactive on this kind of possibility rather than just reactive to
 it?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Well, first of all I think there were a
 number of -- if you look back at some of the history, I think you
 will find some places where we were very -- the FAA was very
 proactive, the countermeasures were developed, and I will again
 mention '95. And we do have, or the FAA does have a very, very
 active intelligence branch. We are dependent on the information
 that we get from the CIA, and with a close examination of that
 information with the CIA, with the FBI. We do depend on them for
 the raw intelligence.
 			</p><p>Should there have been better communication? I think
 absolutely. I think that's been acknowledged really right from the
 beginning. I think in some cases we got appropriate and right
 information. I think in other cases we probably didn't get
 enough.
 			</p><p>I think it's also important to remember that there's a
 lot of information coming at the intelligence community, and that
 very often trying to determine what is the right priority, whether
 or not the source is credible, that is a very great challenge. I
 think there have been tremendous strides since 9/11 in terms of
 communication. The posture I think for the FAA always was we set
 up the criteria, pass that on to the intelligence community, this
 is what we need, they would give us information where they thought
 there was an aviation threat. Sometimes perhaps the information
 we needed perhaps wasn't necessarily a specific aviation threat.
 We may have missed some.
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: Let me just conclude by asking you one final
 question about the red teams. Mr. Mead agrees with you that there
 was no cover-up involved in some of the complaints about what red
 teams reported. But he did say that it either would be a cover-up
 or implementing effective improvements, and you were unable to do
 them. Were there reasons, institutional reasons, that you could
 not implement the recommendations of the red team, or what were
 the problems there?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: In my experience the red team
 recommendations were implemented. I think the point that Mr. Mead
 made in his report, which I think he was absolutely right on, is
 that we were not always as effective as we should have been in
 circling back to the red team, letting them know what
 recommendations had been implemented.
 			</p><p>I will say in the summer, pre-September 11th, the new
 deputy associate administrator for security recognized that as a
 problem and actually had a meeting with the red team and said,
 Look, we have got to do a better job at that. That was reinforced
 by the work that Mr. Mead did, and I believe we certainly made
 those changes, and I believe some of that is still incorporated
 into the TSA.
 			</p><p>In any case where a recommendation may not have been
 implemented, I would like to go back and look at it. But we
 really implemented many, many, most of them, nearly all of them. I
 think there may have been some individual ones where for various
 reasons there was a policy decision that it wasn't the right
 recommendation. Again, I want to go back to what I said. It was
 that kind of work that helped to shape and make the changes to
 training, help us formulate the security rule, the screeners
 security rule. So it was a part of that.
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: Mr. Mead?
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: I have to clarify --
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: Please.
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: -- what we found. There was an allegation the
 FAA covered up. We did not substantiate that allegation. In
 fact, we found that after the red team would go out, they would
 for example, just an example of their activity. They would try to
 get through passenger screening checkpoints with prohibited
 objects, not box cutters, but clearly prohibited objects in their
 luggage. They would try to conceal it, as would a saboteur or a
 terrorist. Or they would try to get something through the
 explosive detection machines. These are these $1 million SUV-type
 machines. They would achieve success in more times than you would
 like to see.
 			</p><p>FAA would in fact take, communicate that the red team had
 found these shortcomings to the airlines and to the screening
 companies. They would not, one, they would not feed back that
 they had done so to the red team, so the red team was frustrated.
 But, also, our work has shown that whatever the airlines did with
 it did not yield permanent improvements, because we would go back
 out with our auditors and investigators, we would try to penetrate
 security, and we would be able to.
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: Same rates?
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: So that's what I mean by the follow-up. The
 follow-up, there was communication back to the airlines, but and
 then FAA's ability -- what is FAA going to do? Fire them? They
 didn't have -- the fines were a cost of doing business. I think
 Ms. Garvey would agree with that. That was another weakness in
 the system. And --
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: And Mr. Mead is right. And that is exactly
 why the screener rule in our view was so important -- why we were
 focused on it, why we got it ready in the fall of 2000.
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I think
 that's a ripe area for us to follow through on, and that's why
 fines are out there and penalties are out there as well, too.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you, congressman. And the last
 questioner from the commission of these witnesses, Commissioner
 Ben-Veniste.
 			</p><p>MR. BEN-VENISTE: I want to join my colleagues in
 thanking you both for your help and for your testimony here today.
 I want to ask a very specific question about September 11th, and I
 want to focus on Flight 77, American 77, which, according to the
 timelines that we have, indicate that at 8:55 in the morning, the
 FAA received information that Flight 77 turned off its course. By
 that time the fate of American Airlines 11 was known, and United
 Airlines Flight 175 was declared to be hijacked and crashed
 shortly thereafter. Why was it, according to all the information
 you have been able to accumulate since, that Flight 77 was not
 immediately declared to be hijacked? According to our
 information, NORAD was not notified until 9:24, approximately a
 half an hour, after in hindsight it would indicate that FAA had
 very good reason to know something was terribly, terribly wrong?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Commissioner, I would like to go back and
 look at those records more carefully, because that is not
 consistent with my understanding of it and the timeline that I
 remember. The timeline that I have, that I remember, is one that
 had a notification of NORAD twice before the time that you
 mention, so that there had been three notifications. But, again,
 I would like to submit that specific timeline for the record, with
 the first notification being at 8:34.
 			</p><p>MR. BEN-VENISTE: At 8:34?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: At 8:34 from a controller at the Boston
 office. And, again, let me submit those for the record or let me
 double-check. The notes that I have were 8:34.
 			</p><p>MR. BEN-VENISTE: We are talking about American Airlines
 Flight 77, the plane that ultimately crashed into the Pentagon.
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Yes.
 			</p><p>MR. BEN-VENISTE: Now, our information, and I will repeat
 it again, because this is grossly outside what we have been
 informed, is that at 8:55 Flight 77 was detected by controllers
 and FAA personnel to be off its course. By that time we knew that
 two planes were hijacked, the two that hit the Twin Towers. At
 8:55 this information was recorded according to FAA. Now, it was
 not until 9:24, according to NORAD -- and if you have some other
 information, we would be very interested in receiving it -- but it
 was not until 9:24, according to NORAD, that they received any
 advice from FAA with respect to Flight 77. Do you have some other
 information that would indicate that FAA notified NORAD prior to
 that time?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: My understanding, commissioner, was that the
 notification was earlier. But I would like to ask that the FAA
 air traffic control chronology be submitted for the record.
 			</p><p>MR. BEN-VENISTE: Well, we are operating on the basis of
 the material that has already been submitted. Mr. Mead, can you
 shed any further light on that?
 			</p><p>MR. MEAD: No, sir, I have no information on that.
 			</p><p>MR. BEN-VENISTE: Do you have in the after-action
 investigation that has been conducted by FAA any information to
 shed light on why it was that FAA delayed notifying NORAD, if it
 is in fact the case that they had information suggesting that
 Flight 77 was off course? Because this is the information we are
 receiving from NORAD.
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Commissioner, the information that I have is
 that the first notification was at 8:34 from an individual
 controller in Boston to Otis, to NORAD at Otis. The next
 notification I believe was about -- and it was about 8:20 when the
 first indication that there was a difficulty with the American
 flight, and that --
 			</p><p>MR. BEN-VENISTE: Are you not confusing Flight 11 with
 Flight 77? Because --
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Sorry. I may be. I may be. If I could, if
 I could go back and, it's been a while since I have looked at that
 chronology.
 			</p><p>MR. BEN-VENISTE: In a general sense, having in mind that
 you do not have this squarely in mind at the moment, in a general
 sense did you investigate whether there was a delay by FAA in
 notifying NORAD with respect to Flight 77?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: We investigated the whole process of the
 NORAD notification. My belief is that we did notify them in a
 timely fashion, but we also felt, as I mentioned a little bit
 earlier, but we also felt that NORAD, that the procedures with
 NORAD and the procedures for communication needed to be much
 clearer, and those protocols were changed directly after 9/11.
 			</p><p>MR. BEN-VENISTE: Well, Mr. Chairman, may I simply
 for purposes of perhaps refreshing our witness's recollection read
 from the testimony of General Eberhardt, who will be here tomorrow
 from NORAD, who testified before the Senate Armed Services
 Committee on October 25th, 2001, in answer to a question from
 Senator Levin. "General Eberhardt, there's been some confusion
 about the sequence of events on September 11th. Perhaps you can
 clear this up for us. Timeline that we have been given is that at
 8:55 on September 11, American Airlines Flight 77 began turning
 east, away from its intended course, and at 9:10 Flight 77 was
 detected by FAA radar over West Virginia heading east. That was
 after the two planes that struck the World Trade Towers. Then, 15
 minutes later, at 9:25, the FAA notified NORAD that Flight 77 was
 headed towards Washington. Was that the first notification, the
 9:25 notification, that NORAD or DOD had that 77 was probably
 hijacked?"
 			</p><p>And then General Eberhardt said, "I show it as 9:24 that
 we were notified." And then he indicated that this was the first
 documented notification that he had. And then, interestingly
 enough, the questioning was, Well, why was the delay -- I'm
 paraphrasing -- and General Eberhardt said, "You'll have to ask
 the FAA." So we are asking.
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Right, and I'd like -- I appreciate that.
 I'd like to submit for the record. I really -- it is not as clear
 perhaps -- my recollection is not quite the same, so I'd like to
 double-check it before I say it here.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Well, you will double-check it, and you will
 get back to us?
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: Certainly will.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: It would be useful if you could get back to
 staff this evening.
 			</p><p>MS. GARVEY: I was thinking that we could probably get
 the answer this evening, because --
 			</p><p>MR. BEN-VENISTE: Thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Mr. Mead, Mrs. Garvey, thank you. Thank you
 both very, very much for your time. And is there anything else
 either of you would like to say? If not, again, thank you very
 much on behalf of the Commission.
 			</p><p>Mr. May is president of the Air Transport Association of America. Mr. May, thank you for coming, and welcome.
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Governor. Should I begin, sir?
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Yes, please.
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I am
 Jim May, president and CEO of the Air Transport Association of
 America. I will go through my statement in fairly rapid fashion
 so that you can proceed with the activities of the evening.
 			</p><p>On behalf of the ATA, let me begin by thanking this
 commission for the service it is performing. I don't think
 there's any higher goal than ensuring we learn everything
 possible.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Could you maybe get a little closer to the
 microphone. I'm having trouble hearing.
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Sure, I can. How's that? On behalf of the
 ATA, let me begin by thanking the Commission for the service it's
 performing. I don't think there can be any higher goal than
 ensuring we learn everything possible from the events of 9/11.
 			</p><p>When I joined ATA about three and a half months ago, one
 of the top priorities I was given by our board was to build on the
 relationship with the TSA. And in coming to better understand the
 TSA/industry dynamic, I've been briefed on the history of the
 relationship between government and the airlines regarding
 security, both before and after the events of 9/11. On that
 basis, let me offer a few observations relevant to your inquiry.
 On 9/11 the airlines administered an aviation security program
 directed and approved by the FAA which originated 30 years
 earlier, and had been developed fundamentally to avert the threat
 of a conventional hijacking, that I think has been referred to
 earlier today. This system was specifically designed as a,
 according to statute actually, a prevent-or-deter system, and was
 not a more intrusive prevent-and-detect system. The system was
 designed by the government to screen passengers and their hand
 luggage for various prohibited items, predominantly weapons, but
 including an array of other weapons and devices. These items were
 believed by the FAA and law enforcement to be the likely tools of
 choice for a hijacker.
 			</p><p>In the event of a hijacking, the policy, which reflected
 the government's long-standing assessment of how to respond to
 such situations, was one of cooperation. In addition, in
 cooperation with the government, the industry was engaged in
 deploying and testing various explosives baggage screening
 technologies to avert the threat of terrorist bombings of
 aircraft. Under the Security Equipment Integrated Product Team
 Program, which was established in the mid 1990s, approximately 160
 explosives detection machines purchased by the FAA were installed
 and utilized by the airlines to both screen for explosive
 materials and provide real-world testing of technologies that had
 been certified under laboratory conditions. While with tragic
 hindsight we can now see that pre-9/11 government security regimes
 in totality did not anticipate the kind of attack that we
 experienced.
 			</p><p>I am aware of no deviation from the established screening
 laws and regulations in effect on 9/11 that contributed in any way
 to the terrorist attack on the United States.
 			</p><p>Now, let me candid with regard to the reported role of
 box cutter devices in the attack. Under pre-9/11 FAA regulations,
 only, quote, "knives with blades four inches long or longer,
 and/or knives considered illegal under local law were prohibited."
 Under a nonregulatory checkpoint operations guide, or COG,
 developed by the FAA, the Regional Airlines Association, ATA, with
 FAA approval, interpreting FAA regulations, box-cutting devices
 were considered a restricted item posing a potential danger. This
 meant that if such a device was identified it could be kept off
 the aircraft. The FAA mandated metal detection walk-through
 systems however, which were designed and tested to detect metallic
 items about the size of a small handgun or larger. Therefore the
 pre-9/11 screening system wasn't designed to detect or prohibit
 these types of small items, and I don't think we have any
 information indicating they were in fact identified in the 9/11
 screening of the terrorists.
 			</p><p>Prior to 9/11 there had not been a hijacking of a U.S.
 carrier since 1991. In the three years prior there had been three
 hijacking events involving U.S. airlines worldwide. In 2001,
 prior to 9/11, the FAA had issued 15 information circulars, ICs,
 relating security information to the industry. Now, those ICs, as
 you probably are well aware, are used to communicate routine,
 nonspecific security information. Of these, four mentioned the
 term "hijacking," three of them making a generic reference to the
 threat, and one providing a more descriptive reference to a
 conventional hijacking concern. Beyond this there was no general
 industry intelligence threat briefing conducted during the period,
 and no relevant security directive was issued. An SD generally
 deals with more definite threat information warranting
 modification of security procedures.
 			</p><p>Finally, if the FAA had more specific credible threat
 information directed at a specific airline, it would have been
 communicated through an SDU, and directly to that airline. At
 ATA, we are not aware of such communications.
 			</p><p>Now, post-9/11 the world changed. Legislation
 establishing the TSA put aviation security directly in the hands
 of the government. The events of 9/11 changed the threat equation,
 which TSA is now dealing with, and they are meeting the challenge
 with the full cooperation and support of our industry. In the 20
 months that have passed, the entire aviation security regime has
 been revamped in response to a new threat. All cockpit doors have
 been hardened with stand- and-attack. Federal air marshals have
 been deployed in substantial numbers, and more recently armed
 federal flight deck officers have begun to be introduced into the
 system. New and improved training programs for crew members have
 been developed to proved and implemented. TSA conducts all
 passenger and baggage screening, using procedures and equipment
 appropriate to newly identified threats. All checked baggage is
 subject to explosive detection screening. TSA is working with the
 airlines to develop information technology, taking advantage of
 known passenger information to better determine where to focus its
 screening resources.
 			</p><p>Behind the scenes, intelligence priorities and practices
 of government have shifted dramatically. Finally, of course the
 mind-set of the government airline security screeners cockpit and
 cabin crews, and society at large has been permanently changed by
 the events of 9/11.
 			</p><p>The government's newly intensified intelligence focus is
 particularly important. The government has at its disposal the
 tools necessary to identify, assess and address or resolve
 evolving threat situations in a manner which really was impossible
 under the bifurcated government-industry relationship that existed
 prior to 9/11. And while no one would suggest that the current
 system has completed its development, it's strong and growing
 better every day with experience and with testing.
 			</p><p>As to the future, the airlines industry has long been on
 record that advocating over time the TSA security system evolve to
 focus more intensively at looking at people rather than searching
 solely for things. The events of 9/11 make that less inescapable.
 And, as I mentioned, TSA is moving in that direction to the
 development of a more sophisticated computer-based technology, the
 so-called CAPPS 2 system, that will complement and facilitate even
 better use of the physical screening resources.
 			</p><p>The second inescapable lesson from 9/11 is the imperative
 for aggressive collection and analysis of intelligence, always
 searching for new and evolving threats. Because of the historic
 pattern of terrorists targeting of aviation as a surrogate target
 for the United States, the airline industry has long sought
 intelligence resources dedicated to identifying and resolving
 terrorist threats to aviation. In the post-9/11 world, clearly
 those resources are being utilized by the TSA as an activist
 consumer of intelligence information, and it is our belief that
 today intelligence's flow and analysis has improved dramatically.
 			</p><p>This reorientation is indispensable. Deterring future
 acts of violence against U.S. civil aviation cannot occur without
 meaningful real-time intelligence assessments. It is imperative
 that in the future we recognize that the public interest demands
 an aviation security system that effectively deploys a prudent mix
 of technology and procedures capable of counteracting all
 vulnerabilities. The system must recognize that evolving threats
 require a continuous and accurate reassessment process guided by
 the best available information. The system must recognize as well
 that undue reliance on one or two technologies or procedures
 invites failure. Security must evolve and adapt to meet the
 changing nature of the threat.
 			</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to again thank the Commission
 for its important work and reaffirm our commitment to work
 unceasingly with the government to provide a safe and secure air
 transportation system upon which the public and our nation's
 economy can and should rely. Thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you, Mr. May. Commissioner Fielding?
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. May, did the
 ATA do a post-9/11 analysis or prepare a report or review?
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: To the best of my knowledge, Commissioner, they
 did not. Individual airlines certainly worked cooperatively with
 the FBI, but the association as an entity did not.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Were you provided with copies of the
 individual airline reports?
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: We were not. Those were discussions, as I
 understand it, that were conducted directly with the FBI and other
 intelligence agencies.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: The Commission is interested in what
 programs and procedures the airlines had in place to check the
 efficiency of the screening contractors prior to 9/11. I
 understand that the ATA provided figures, cost figures, but that
 there's some discrepancy. The figures range from 330 billion to
 one trillion.
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: I think, commissioner, the higher number
 probably was 100 million, if I recall. I don't think in my
 briefings I've ever heard a number that was as high as one
 trillion.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Tell me again what you think the figures
 were?
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: I think it ranged from 300 million -- I'm
 sorry, to a billion, I apologize.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Okay, 300 million --
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: That was the range that was discussed during
 the latest supplemental discussions before Congress on this very
 subject.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: How do we reconcile that discrepancy? The
 question came up because people were trying to evaluate how you
 could really assess the quality, if you couldn't really know, you
 know, less than that kind of a spread?
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: That's a very fair question. That's one I
 asked as well when I joined the organization, and it's my
 understanding that the high number was a number that was
 originally used almost as an offhand comment by one of the
 executives of the airlines involved, and that was, as all of us
 who are involved here in Washington recognize, sort of became
 gospel overnight. When the industry went back to do an in-depth
 analysis and an assessment, I think they reported back to Congress
 with a far, a lower number. I think the range was somewhere
 between three and five hundred million dollars. There are some
 documents that have been prepared by ATA that I think more
 accurately clarify what the industry was spending on security pre-
 9/11. I'd be happy to provide those to the commission for the
 record.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: That would be appreciated. Thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: ure..
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Mr. Cleland.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND: Yes, sir.	
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Senator Cleland.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND: Thank you, Mr. May. Thank you very much.
 We appreciate you and the American airline industry. Is it your
 assessment that basically 9/11 has been the main factor in the
 airlines' decline, or how do you see that? I mean, the airlines
 are in trouble now in America, and one of the things that bothers
 me is that part of the early rationale for al Qaeda attacking the
 country was to go to the heart of our economy and used airlines to
 do it.
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Senator, I think this industry is still suffering mightily as a result of the 9/11 tragedy and attack.
 There is no question that the drop in traffic still continues. We
 saw some rather significant spikes that resulted as a result of
 the increased hostilities in the Far East and the Iraq war. We
 have seen certainly a drop in traffic as a result of the SARS
 crisis in the Pacific. But I think we have a systemic drop across
 the board below pre-9/11 numbers that we attribute directly to the
 continued reluctance to fly, even though we have probably the best
 security system today that we have ever had, and a safety record
 that for three years running has been virtually perfect.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND: Give me the idea of -- the Department of
 Transportation has talked about what a sieve the pre-9/11 security
 system was. Published reports indicate that at least nine of the
 19 hijackers were selected for special security scrutiny prior to
 boarding the hijacked flight, nine of the 19; six by the computerassisted
 pre-screening program, CAPPS; two because of ID document
 irregularities; and one because he was traveling with one of the
 latter two. Are these reports accurate? Were nine identified
 somehow for a special security scrutiny, do you happen to know?
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Sir, I do now know the answer. I am not
 familiar with the specifics of the nine. I can tell you this,
 that there clearly have been a number of reports as to the
 effectiveness of the pre-9/11 security system. We are well aware
 of the red team activities and so forth.
 			</p><p>I would simply remind the Commission that the security
 system that was in place at the time, however good or efficient or
 inefficient it may have been, was designed to do two things:
 detect weapons coming on board because they were challenged with
 trying to sort of passively present or prevent hijackings; or,
 two, to detect explosives in the belly of the aircraft. And those
 were the two primary missions. To the extent that the system
 overall was effective, I think in a period of time from 1990, when
 that system was put in place, until the events of 9/11, there was
 something on the order of nine billion passengers and 50 million
 flights that were checked without incident. And so I think we can
 all look back and a lot of reason to think that it wasn't as
 effective was we would like it to be, and I think be accurate in
 that. I think overall it did do what it was intended to do.
 Unfortunately, the threat of 9/11 and the changes have shown us
 that the system wasn't effective in taking care of what happened
 then.
 			</p><p>MR. CLELAND: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: I've got just a couple of questions.
 Forgetting the systems for a minute, if everybody on that day had
 done their job, would the tragedy have been prevented?
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Governor, I can only give you a personal
 assessment on that answer. I don't have hands-on knowledge.
 Given what I understand about the nature of the security system
 that existed at that time, and the manner in which our crews and
 others were expected to respond to the kind of threat they were
 presented with historically, they could all have been doing a
 perfect job, and we still good have had the tragedy.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: I'm talking about the screeners too, which
 were part of --
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Yes, I understand.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: -- which were part of that operation.
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Yes, screeners and all. We don't even -- I
 don't think -- this commission may determine that we don't even
 know for sure that box cutters were brought through the screening
 process, as opposed to being on the plane, for example. But there
 was nothing in that screening system that would have guaranteed
 that box cutters would have been detected, and certainly even if
 they had, they were not a prohibited device at that time.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Another question. You said look at people,
 not things.
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Yes, sir.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Is that what I would call normally profiling?
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Yes, sir. And interestingly this industry, and
 I'd like to submit it for the record, made a series of
 recommendations to the Gore Commission back in 1996, and one of
 those was to focus very intensively on the profiling process and
 to look at people as well as things.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: And you were suggesting that the pilots are now
 going through a different kind of training, the training has been
 changed --
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Our crews --
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: -- could you elucidate that a little bit,
 elaborate on it a bit? What's new in the pilot training now that
 might prevent this ever happening again?
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: I am not sure it would be wise for me to go
 into a whole lot of detail in an open session on all of the
 training. Suffice it to say that both pilots and flight crews have
 a very different training regimen than they had pre-9/11. I think
 it is also safe to say, I can tell you even as a passenger, I
 think the mind-set of everyone on an airplane today is far
 different than it was pre-9/11.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Okay. Commissioner Hamilton.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: Mr. May, would your primary recommendation
 to make air travel safer be the use of profiling? Is that the
 most important single thing that you think can be done?
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: No, sir, I don't think there is one single
 thing that can be done. You know, it's interesting, we went back
 to do a little research preparing for this, and we looked at the
 recommendations that we made to that Gore Commission back in 1996,
 and I don't think there are any that wouldn't apply today in some
 respect. They range from improving analysis in the intelligence
 product to a heightened role -- at that time we said the FBI,
 because the TSA didn't exist, in reality or in our minds --
 detection device deployment, which is clear that the new
 technology is out there today and getting better all the time,
 profiling technology, canine support, screening, contractor
 certification, expansion of screener development programs -- a lot
 of things that TSA has already done. And I think we think they
 are doing a heck of a fine job. The human factors work, nonautomated
 passenger profiling, and so forth. And I'll, as I said,
 submit these for the record. But I think we need to focus on
 people as much as we do on things to have as complete a security
 system as possible.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: Perhaps you could just furnish to us the
 details -- you don't need to do this now -- but you could furnish
 to us the details of what you mean by profiling.
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Certainly, sir, I'd be happy to. I think the
 CAPPS 2 system is probably a good example of what we are talking
 about, and again it's one that the details of which are probably
 best not discussed in an open session.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: Thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Secretary Lehman.
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN: Just to follow up on the profiling, this is a
 pretty politically sensitive issue, as you know, and generally the
 gold standard in this air transport security is accepted to be the
 Israeli airline and airport security systems, which depends very
 heavily on ethnic profiling. Do you advocate specifically
 including ethnic profiling in the CAPPS system? Was there any
 ethnic profiling going on before 9/11? Should it go on today?
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Mr. Secretary, I am not in a position to
 suggest what the profile ought to consist of. That is a role of
 the TSA, exclusively the role of the TSA. We have a single
 airline that with respect to CAPPS 2 is working to facilitate the
 deployment of a system, but it's up to the federal government, and
 I don't think it would be appropriate for me to suggest.
 			</p><p>To the best of my knowledge, on the second part of your
 question, I don't think racial profiling was included in the
 earlier system, but there are those that I am sure will be
 testifying that can give you a more accurate reflection of the
 detail of that system than I can.
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN: But did the industry advocate, given
 that we are at war with Arab fundamentalists, that there should be
 a element of narrowing down special attention on an ethnic basis?
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Commissioner, we have not made any
 recommendations as to the detail of profiling, other than to say
 that we recommend that there ought to be profiling as part of the
 overall intelligence process.
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN: On another issue, we have had reports that
 there was very heavy lobbying from the industry during the '90s,
 particularly after the recommendations of the Pan Am 103 panel, to
 water down the rule-making, to prevent its funding properly, and
 then when certain things were implemented, like cockpit access,
 that once the heat was off, the key system and the locked cockpit
 doors and so forth was basically dropped by the industry, and that
 they successfully blocked Kevlar doors, which was one of the
 recommendations. Is that an accurate depiction? Did the industry
 lobby, pressure, to reduce and lower the cost of screening and
 other security procedures?
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: I don't have personal experience, Commissioner,
 as to what the industry did or didn't do at that time. I wouldn't
 be surprised in looking back at the history to discover that the
 industry did, or at least the trade association on behalf of the
 industry, worked to find rules and regulations that were as cost
 effective as they could be. So it, you know, it is entirely
 possible that they worked hard on behalf of their member companies
 to work with the FAA and with others to try and come up with the
 best solutions.
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN: Thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Any further questions of Mr. May? Yes?
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Just one follow-up question, Mr. May. You
 were talking about the training programs for new pilots. Is that
 --
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: And flight attendants.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Is that an industry program or is that a
 TSA program?
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: No, it is both an FAA program, and there are
 some TSA programs that are under development.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: So our source of information should be there
 on that program?
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: Both cases.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Okay, thank you. That's all. Thank you,
 Mr. Chairman.
 			MR. KEAN: There are no more questions, Mr. May. Thank
 you very much. I know you have a plane to catch.
 			</p><p>MR. MAY: A later one than I originally anticipated.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you very much, sir.
 I want to pronounce it right. Mr. Dzakovic?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Mr. Dzakovic.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Mr. Dzakovic.
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: No problem, I've got a slight sore throat
 myself.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you very much for coming and being with
 us today.
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: What I would like to do is give you a
 perspective of what led up to 9/11 from a person that worked in
 the field, in the trenches. But first, before I get into that, I
 would like to just say that I will always be held in shock and awe
 when I hear people who work in this field say that 9/11 was a
 totally unpredictable situation. And I say that for three
 reasons.
 			</p><p>One, as was briefly discussed earlier today, the aviation
 field has always been the favorite target of terrorism, going back
 to the 1960s, for a number of reasons, which I won't get into.
 The second is the intelligence information was so great that
 something was going to happen, and I acknowledge the fact that we
 didn't know when or where, but something was going to happen,
 something in the near future. And Commissioner Roemer went into
 that in a little detail, a little more detail earlier today.
 			</p><p>But I would also like to read a statement from the former
 associate administrator of FAA security on April 6th of 2000. This
 was to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation,
 Subcommitte on Aviation Security. And I quote, "Moreover, members
 of foreign terrorist groups and representatives from state
 sponsors of terrorism are present in the United States. There is
 evidence that a few foreign terrorist groups have well established
 capability and infrastructures here." When you combine that with
 what the Commissioner said earlier, that's a pretty strong
 indication that something is brewing.
 			</p><p>The third thing is we proved in the red team that FAA did
 not even enforce its own minimum standards of aviation security.
 When you combined all three of those, to me that's pretty much
 like adding two plus two and getting four, that maybe we ought to
 do something to beef up security.
 			</p><p>And, as another example, in my written statement to you I
 received a document in the course of my whistle-blower complaint
 that was written by an FAA agent at Boston's Logan Airport. And
 this was written on May 18th of 1999, in which the agent became so
 frustrated working through the system, the FAA system, that the
 person went to the inspector general's office and described a very
 serious problem at Boston Logan Airport, which as you recall is
 where two airplanes left from. And, I quote, "As a result of this
 situation, Logan International Airport is in a critical state of
 noncompliance with federal aviation security regulations." And
 this went to the inspector general's office, and no action was
 taken by the IG's office as early as 1999 to correct the problems
 there.
 			</p><p>But to give you my own background check, I first started
 working for FAA in the latter part of the '80s, and it was a
 direct result of the murder of Robert Stethem, who was a Navy
 sailor that was killed on TWA 847. When I was recruited I was told
 that FAA was looking for appropriate people with military and law
 enforcement background to start fighting this war on terrorism.
 So there was absolutely no doubt that our mission was to fight
 terrorism as it applied to the aviation industry.
 			</p><p>A little time went by and then we had Pan Am 103, and in
 the presidential commission that investigated that afterwards,
 they interviewed an FAA field agent who did some work in
 Frankfurt, which of course was where the bomb was placed on the
 plane. This was an inspection the person did several months prior
 to the bombing. The agent said, if I recall right, that the only
 thing that is holding security together at this airport are the
 tenuous threads of luck. And nothing substantially has changed in
 FAA's attitude about security since before the Pan Am 103 bombing.
 			</p><p>One of the high points, however, that occurred as a
 result of Pan Am 103 was the appointment of General Orlo Steele
 (ph), a retired Marine Corps general who was appointed, I believe
 in 1990 to take over security. And he did try to change the
 culture, and was in fact changing the culture in FAA security, but
 he had only a very limited tour of duty, two or three years, and
 he was in a position where he was forced to resign at that point.
 And I recall being at headquarters at the time, I was actually a
 team leader in the federal air marshal branch when he resigned.
 And the very next day that he resigned FAA rescinded a lot of his
 orders and directions as far as how we conduct business. I knew
 from that point we were going back to business as usual.
 			</p><p>I then quit the air marshal branch, because it was
 outright dangerous, some of the things they were proposing that we
 do, as well as changing our rules of engagement and training and
 what-not. And in 1995 I became a team leader in the red team.
 And it took me about two years, between one and two years, to
 realize that there was a very serious problem in how FAA conducts
 its business. And the reason it took me that long is we would test
 virtually every aspect of security from the screening checkpoints,
 to access control, CAPPS--we didn't have CAPPS at that point, but
 it was profiling. Later we did test CAPPS, screening of checked
 baggage, and some other areas, cargo security. And we found major
 loopholes in every area of security that FAA was involved in. But
 after two years, I started trying to work within the system, and I
 knew that was a pointless effort, because criticism is not
 accepted in FAA. That's part of the culture. And I became so
 frustrated that I joined up with another red team, former red team
 leader, who also found problems similar to what I had, and the two
 of us, his name is Steve Elson (ph), just for the record, we
 started going to the inspector general's office to try to get them
 to do something about this sorry state of aviation security. And
 they did nothing. Then I talked to a senior official in the IG's
 office, and he actually explained to me that when Mary Schiavo was
 the inspector general of the IG, she had a very aggressive stance
 against FAA, and it caused a lot of political problems. After she
 resigned, the IG had a kinder, gentler approach to dealing with
 problems with FAA.
 			</p><p>At a later meeting he actually informed me that unless I
 gave him a dead body and a smoking gun, there is nothing he can do
 against FAA management. Well, I submit now he has close to 3,000
 dead bodies and a gun the size of a canon, and they still have not
 taken any action against anyone in FAA for the poor manner in
 which they executed security.
 			</p><p>Anyway, life went on and we continued doing testing
 around the country and around the world, and I've probably been to
 around 30 or so countries around the world looking at their
 security systems and how our aviation industry was impacted by
 that. But still there was no improvement in security.
 			</p><p>And we then went to the General Accounting Office and
 tried to get them to do something about aviation security. I was
 not aware of it at the time, I learned of it since then, but the
 GAO has their own long history of reports going back 20 years
 documenting how poor aviation security is. And somewhere during
 that timeframe we were also joined by Bob Monetti, whose son died
 on Pam Am 103. He joined us on some of these meetings to the GAO
 and some other offices.
 			</p><p>So after that, realizing I wasn't getting anywhere, I
 sent a letter to Administrator Garvey in August of 1998, trying to
 explain to her that there's a serious culture of gross
 mismanagement in civil aviation security. She didn't even have
 the courtesy to respond to my letter, much less take any action on
 it.
 			</p><p>I did send a letter, a copy of the letter at the same
 time to the Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater, and he at
 least had the courtesy to respond to my letter, and he advised
 Jane Garvey to look into some of my issues, but there was never
 any follow-up, and nothing ever occurred as a result of that.
 			</p><p>More time went on, and while I was actually doing my
 testing, what I found out over the years is that the red team was
 basically working its way out of a job. Whenever we found major
 problems in security, such as the screening checkpoint. We did
 some massive testing in 1998 I think it was, lasting almost a
 year, where we came up with horrendous results on the screening
 checkpoint. After that project was over, we were prohibited from
 testing and screening checkpoints anywhere since 1998.
 			</p><p>We also did testing overseas in their explosive
 detection systems, and we found major problems with those, and FAA
 prevented us from going back and retesting to try and find what
 those problems were and to correct those problems.
 			</p><p>More time went on, and I don't have time to go into all
 of it, but basically we were working our way out of a job. Every
 time we found a major problem in security, beyond the normal
 problems, we were restricted from doing testing. And by the time
 of 9/11, about the only kind of testing we were doing was
 explosive detection systems domestically. We also did some
 international testing, but not a whole lot.
 			</p><p>And on the day of September 11th I was working in the
 operations center of FAA, and I forget who brought it up, but
 someone brought up the issue of a gun being on one of the flights.
 What happened that day we received information from a credible
 source at the operation center that a gun was in fact used on one
 of the flights. Around four o'clock that afternoon Ms. Garvey
 asked for an executive summary for everything we knew up to that
 point in time. If I remember right, it was just a one-page
 document, just a summary. And we reported the gun on American
 Airlines Flight 11. There was also some issue of a possible
 explosive on another aircraft. When this went on, I didn't give
 it a second thought at the time, because at the time I figured, if
 you are going to hijack a plane, why not bring a gun? And I knew
 from working on the red team that it was fairly easy to do. So I
 didn't give it a second thought.
 			</p><p>Two or three months went by when the press resurfaced
 that issue, and FAA's immediate response is that there was no such
 document. Then apparently they were confronted with the actual
 document, and then FAA's response, and this was written in the
 press, was that we admit that there is a document, but there is an
 error in it. They actually stated that what the person meant to
 write was it wasn't a gun but it was a knife, and instead of a
 bullet wound it was a stab wound. It was that kind of activity
 going on this entire time, where they just denied, and in my
 opinion tried to cover up, what actually went on. I don't want to
 take up too much time, but that is the gist of the history of how
 we got to 9/11.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Thank you very much. Commissioner Fielding?
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Thank you for appearing today and helping
 us. You said in your testimony that on 9/11 you received
 information that there was a firearm from a credible source?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Yes.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Can you provide us that credible source?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: I don't know who specifically it was.
 However, in the operation center not just anybody could just call
 us up and say, you know, we think this is what happened. Any
 information that came to us had to come from either the airlines
 or an FAA office or the FBI or some other government agency. It
 wasn't something that just anybody could access. So I personally
 don't know where that came from, but any information we had came
 from a credible source.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Well, help me out a little. You're in a
 room and you hear that somebody else has received that
 information?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: What we had was just a standard operation
 center, had four walls. And on each wall we had big blocks of
 butcher paper where whenever anything of substance came in we
 would write that information down on the paper. Then, when we
 were putting together the executive summary, without looking at
 things politically or using any other filtering process, we just
 wrote down the facts that we had. And one of them was that a gun
 was on such-and-such a flight, and the person also identified the
 seat where the gun was held by the passenger, and then apparently
 an individual sitting in front of that seat was shot. And we just
 reported that.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Do you remember who wrote it on the
 butcher paper?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Yes, it was a lady by the name of -- not
 on the butcher paper, but I know who wrote it on the executive
 summary.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: No, but I'm trying to figure out who
 received the information and wrote it on the butcher paper.
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: I really don't know.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: How many people were in the room?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Between 15 and 20 I would think.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Okay. Let me switch gears here a little.
 You made reference to the CAPPS system.
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Yes.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: And we have not had much testimony about
 that today, but from your understanding how did the CAPPS system
 operate on 9/11?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: We tested CAPPS in the red team. CAPPS is
 one of the most dangerous systems out there. It gives a totally
 false sense of protection. And the reason is when you look at
 CAPPS from a red team perspective or from a terrorist perspective,
 the way you look at it is how do what criteria do I have to use to
 apply to this not to be selected as a CAPPS selectee? That's
 fairly easy to do just by flying around a little bit and testing
 the system and see if you are made a selectee or not, based on
 CAPPS. I really believe that CAPPS is the number one most
 dangerous system out there, because it just totally gives a false
 sense of security. And CAPPS only, I don't know what the
 percentage is, but like it would make a selectee out of 10 or 15
 percent of the population of travelers. What that does is it
 totally eliminates the other 85 to 90 percent of the people from
 further selection other than on a random basis. It's already been
 demonstrated that terrorists have the capability to do a little
 research beforehand and they will find out what it takes to find
 out not to be made a selectee by CAPPS. And now we have CAPPS 2,
 which I am not familiar with the specifics, but if it's anywhere
 near the way CAPPS 1 was conducted, it's simply a very dangerous
 system.
 			</p><p>The single most effective deterrent against aviationrelated
 terrorism is profiling the way it used to be called, or
 now a risk assessment that is conducted by a human being in an
 interview process with the passenger. And that's not something
 you can do with every single passenger, but you can certainly weed
 people out a little bit. But from our red team experience, being
 interviewed by an experienced profiler or risk assessment person
 is the biggest deterrent against aviation-related terrorism.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Going back to CAPPS, CAPPS 1 or whatever
 it was called at that time, we have reports that six of the
 people, the hijackers, were identified by CAPPS. Though in this
 case it didn't eliminate them. They weren't in the other 85
 percent or whatever it is that went on. So it actually identified
 them. But then where was the breakdown?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Well, that's part of the problem with
 CAPPS. It makes you a selectee, but if all you're doing is going
 through the regular screening process without an appropriate
 interview, an in-depth interview, it really doesn't do anything.
 I read that there were nine people that were made selectees as a
 result of CAPPS. But so what? I mean, it had absolutely no
 impact. And I don't know how much money CAPPS costs, but I am
 sure it is in the millions of dollars. But it's a total waste of
 the money, if not a danger, in my opinion.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: Well, if you had to identify a single --
 or what would you say was the direct an immediate cause of the
 9/11 tragedies? Where was the specific breakdown with this group
 of hijackers?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: The only think remarkable about what
 happened on September 11 is how unremarkable their tactics were.
 And we proved on the red team that the best way to conduct an
 operation is to keep it as simple as possible. They didn't even
 need box cutters. I mean, they could have just walked on the
 plane as a regular passenger and taken over the plane without any
 type of weapon, because there's plenty of weapons on a plane you
 can use anyway. And apparently some of them also had martial arts
 training also. But as I put in my whistle-blower complaint, what
 happened on September 11th was not a failure of the system; it was
 a system that was designed for failure. Every single aspect of it
 did not work to either deter or find terrorists.
 			</p><p>MR. FIELDING: I have no further questions. Thank you,
 sir.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: One or two questions. I gather from your
 testimony before September 11th it was unsafe to fly.
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Yes.	
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: All right, now we have heard a number of
 people here testify about the difference in pilot training, a
 number of other systems that were put into place. The federal
 government has taken over the checkers. There have been a number
 of improvements made. Tell me about the system now.
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: I think we have got a long way to go.
 Just to give you one example, because of the situation I have been
 in as a whistle-blower, I have been given a tape of TV news
 reports from around the country, and I am not sure how many there
 are in there, 20 or 25 different reports from around the country
 where television news people are breaching security with almost
 100 percent regularity. And take it from -- and I have not worked
 with these people -- but, take it from me, TV news reporters are
 not the best terrorists in the world, but the methods that they
 are using are more sophisticated than what our own red team, what
 the current red team is using. In fact, I call it a pink team,
 because it is not as aggressive as it should be. But if TV
 reporters from around the country are breaching security with this
 kind of regularity, I mean that's a serious indication that things
 quite aren't quite what they should be.
 			</p><p>One of the other things is I spent quite a bit of time
 working in the explosives detection systems for checked baggage,
 and we are spending billions of dollars on this, and, not in all
 cases, but a lot of these machines are placed -- I don't want to
 go into too much detail, but they are being placed in the absolute
 
 worst possible environment given the capabilities of the machines
 that you could possibly put them in. And it's only a matter of
 time if terrorists are so inclined to figure out how the system
 works that they are going to figure it out, and they could blow up
 50 planes in one day. But they are going to figure that out by
 themselves, because that's what they are fairly good at.
 			</p><p>My concern is, which is one of the reasons I am not going
 into it now, is the high school freshman class could do this same
 thing as a class project, and -- but it's not just my opinion. I
 had discussions with our own explosives unit last summer about
 this same thing. They agree with my assessment of how they are
 deploying these machines and how they are using them. But nobody
 in the unit is going to rock the boat by sending this information
 up the chain, because in the culture that we have is that you
 simply don't rock the boat. And that is something that needs to
 change, and you have to come up with a system where the streetlevel
 employees, who are the ones that are going to stop the next
 terrorist attack, are in a position where they are encouraged to
 use initiative and their brain to try to do the job they are
 trying to do. And that does not exist right now.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: So you'd change the positions of the machines.
 You'd get a sophisticated form of profiling. Are there any other
 recommendations you would have to make us safer when we fly?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Well, there's mechanical things such
 as changing the training of the screeners. What was demonstrated
 in the TV news reporters across the country is, no terrorist in
 his right mind is going to walk through a screening checkpoint
 with a gun taped to his forehead. He is going to conceal it. So
 what the TV news people did is use what they called opaque
 objects, so that the X-ray could not see through the device, where
 you could easily hide a gun or a bomb or whatever, and they are
 getting through with almost 100 regularity. I mean something
 simple like that could be easily changed, if they provide the
 appropriate training for the screeners.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Congressman Hamilton and Congressman Gorelick.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: It may be that the Chairman has already
 asked the question. Do you believe the system today is unsafe?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: There's a bigger deterrent now then there
 was before September 11th.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: You believe the system today is unsafe?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Yes.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: You recommend to improve it, to kind of
 repeat what the chairman said, profiling?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Risk assessment.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: Risk assessment. Better detection
 devices, which will take time to bring on screen, I suppose?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: The equipment they have now isn't bad
 equipment, but it's not being used right.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: So the solution to that is better training
 of the people?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Better training, but also deploying the
 machines in a better manner. But I would rather not get into the
 specifics on that right now.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: And what else would you recommend?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Better training. I mean, there's pros and
 cons with pilots being armed, but the hazard with that is pilots
 need to know that their authority is completely limited to their
 cabin, or rather the cockpit of the airplane, that they are not,
 no matter what goes on behind me or in the cabin, that their main
 job is to get the plane on the ground as quickly as possible, and
 then disable the plane once it gets on the ground. And I am not
 sure those procedures have been ingrained in the pilots. But
 that's essentially it.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: Are there any systems around the world
 that you consider safe?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Any airline?
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: Yeah.
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Not really. I mean, I've been to some
 airports that are better than others.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: What's the best one?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Amsterdam. And the reason Amsterdam did
 so well, is the law enforcement authorities there take direct and
 personal interest in every aspect of security. If they see a
 screener, for for example, having a problem with a passenger, they
 will automatically get involved and resolve the situation
 themselves. It's done in a very professional manner. It's not
 intimidating. But that is by far the best place I witnessed as a
 red team member.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: Thank you.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Commissioner Gorelick.
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK: I'd like to follow up on some questions
 that Senator Gorton asked earlier. He pointed out that we are not
 that bad on following up on the last problem, on trying to solve
 the last problem. And as I appreciate your testimony and Jane
 Garvey's testimony, the FAA security operation relied pretty
 heavily on these red teams. And as I understand your testimony,
 the red team's job under statute was to determine the
 effectiveness and the vulnerabilities of the systems.
 			</p><p>Now, the red teams contest known vulnerabilities, like
 screening, or are doors closed, go through a list and just probe
 the list of known vulnerabilities. But it seems to me the best
 test, the best and most effective uses of a red team are testing
 unknown vulnerabilities. Now, to do that you have to have
 intelligence or imagination. You have to have some ability to
 creatively assess what your enemies might be doing, so you can
 essentially put yourself in their shoes. You can read novels --
 not a bad way actually to imagine what your enemies might be
 thinking. Or, instead of waiting for the intelligence community
 to feed you a list of items that Congressman Roemer read, you on
 the red team, or you in security, can pulse the system and say,
 What have you got out there that we ought to be thinking about?
 And my question to you is did you on the red team, or did anyone
 in the FAA security operation, affirmatively go to the
 intelligence community and say, Let us imagine what the next
 threat might be -- what might that be?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: No. And the reason for that is, aviation
 security under the whole guise of the homeland security
 responsibility, aviation security is probably the easiest system
 out of all this to protect. You don't have to go into using all
 kind of imagination to figure out how to beat the system. There
 are basically two threats against aviation, and that's a hijacking
 or a bombing, and all you have to do is focus on those two issues:
 how to minimize a hijacking and how to minimize a bombing.
 There's other issues, like a rocket.
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK: It does seem to me you would defend -- and
 we have heard that you would defend against a hijacking that is
 not designed to land the plane safely and get some ransom or some
 other action differently than you would defend against a hijacking
 designed to fly a plane into a building and kill the hijackers and
 everyone else. We have seen that the defensive measures would
 indeed be different. So if you were to imagine the latter
 situation as opposed to the former, you might probe the system
 differently, wouldn't you?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Well, there really, from a security point
 of view there is no difference between defending against a
 hijacker that wants to do a September 11th thing or a hijacker who
 wants to go to Miami. The key word is you are defending against a
 hijacking, and you worry about his motivations later.
 			</p><p>Now, there are other in-flight procedures that they can
 use regarding that type of stuff. But as far as keeping a
 hijacker off a plane and keeping the weapons off a plane, there's
 no difference between how you handle either situation.
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK: That's if you define defending it as
 keeping the weapons off the plane. There are other lines of
 defense if you failed in that first one, which you would put in
 place, like barring the doors and having redundant systems for
 alerting that a hijacking was taking place, that you might
 implement if you thought that the threat was different. And I'm
 asking whether anyone in the FAA security chain tried to imagine a
 different scenario than the one we have previously faced.
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Not that I am aware of. But I still say
 from a purely security point of view, whether a person is
 hijacking a plane, you know, some nutcase that wants to go to
 Miami or Las Vegas, there is no difference between providing
 security to deter that person as opposed to providing security
 against professional terrorists who want to crash a plane into a
 building. The key word is the basic procedures are the same. You
 can have heightened procedures, but the basic procedures are the
 same as far as deterring either one of those type of
 hijackings. There are only two threats: hijackings or bombings.
 			</p><p>MS. GORELICK: I think as a baseline that might be
 correct. I don't agree that there's nothing further that you can
 do once you imagine the threat differently than it has been
 imagined in the past.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: Do you fly?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Not anymore.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: You never get on an airplane?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Actually I was grounded professionally on
 September 11th, and I haven't flown anywhere since then.
 			</p><p>MR. HAMILTON: Because you're afraid?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Well, I'm not flying professionally, and
 for personal reasons I almost went overseas but then I decided
 against it because of the war. But what I do know is that if a
 terrorist wants to -- they are sophisticated enough to figure out
 how to get through the systems that we have now.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: Congressman Roemer?
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: You described the new red team in a pretty
 derogatory fashion there. In a serious vein, what are they not
 doing that they should be doing?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: I received as a response to my whistleblower
 complaint, the Transportation Security Agency provided a
 letter to the Office of Special Counsel that they let me read, and
 the OSC asked them to demonstrate how they have changed the red
 team. For one thing they are not using the same type of opaque
 objects for example that the TV news media is using. They are
 using real weapons, which is a plus, but like I said, a terrorist
 is not going to put a handgun or something worse --
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: So your argument then is that the standards
 and the difficulty has digressed since what you were able to
 achieve in terms of testing the systems today?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: In some respects. But the other part of
 it is they are not even testing certain areas that they should be
 testing. And one of them is the -- according to this letter -- the
 explosive detection systems. And we identified in the red team
 massive problems in this current generation of machines, and under
 the best of circumstances, with very few bags going through the
 machines and the machines in ideal situations, they only detected
 about one third of our devices. And now they are using those same
 machines in the worst possible condition, at least at some
 airports. And I would wager a paycheck that they could get close
 to a zero percent success rate on finding explosives the way some
 of these are deployed.
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: On page four of your testimony you talk
 about in 1998 the red team did extensive testing of screening
 checkpoints, and then an FAA field office conducted screening of
 different airports. How did you finally assess the safety of the
 airport? Was it based on the red team's penetration? The FAA
 field office penetration? Combination score? Median score? How
 was that done, and how is that being done today?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Which paragraph are you referring to?
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: I'm referring to in your prepared statement
 page four, point number four: "In 1998, the red team completed
 extensive testing of screening checkpoints at a number of domestic
 airports. Basically our test results were the inverse of the
 results FAA field offices achieved. In one case we had documented
 an airport detection rate of about three percent."
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Right. I'm sorry, can you repeat your
 question then?
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: Well, my question is then during your time
 on the red team, how did the FAA finally announce the success rate
 of the screening rate at that particular airport? Was it your
 score at the red team, three percent or 10 percent? Was it the
 FAA field office score of 90 percent? Was it a combination of
 those two? And then how are they doing that? How are the
 determining that kind of penetration rate today, if you know?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: There was a big division of labor between
 how the red team operated and how our FAA field offices operated.
 Someone else will have to define exactly what "cover-up" means,
 but in my opinion they covered up our results, did nothing with
 it. This is back in '98.
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: That's a strong term, and we asked that
 question to one of the preceding panels, and the inspector general
 said it wasn't a cover-up. In fact, he argues that it was
 difficulty in implementing some of your recommendations, or a
 failure to implement those. How would you respond to that? Do
 you say they didn't even try to do it, or they did not announce
 the results of your screening and results?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: They pretty much kept our testing secret.
 However --
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: You disagree with the inspector general's
 definition of "cover-up" --
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Yes.
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: -- versus effective implementation of your
 recommendations?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Yes. Not only that, but when the IG finished
 their investigation in the whistle-blower complaint, under law I
 was allowed to respond to their investigation. And one of the
 things I stated to the OSC is that the IG did not do a poor
 investigation; that they falsified their investigation into my
 whistle-blower complaint. The reason is that they did not include
 any of my documentation. They did not include any derogatory
 statements from my witnesses. They basically came up with a
 fairly lame investigation into my whistle-blower complaint. The
 OSC then kicked it back to the IG to have them re-do certain
 issues, and this kind of went on back and forth for a while. But
 this is one example that politics and image takes precedence over
 reality when it comes to aviation security. And that's the whole
 history of FAA-regulated security.
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: Finally, Mr. Chairman, how many red teams do
 we currently have out there working today?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: I think there's quite a few of then, but
 again, I would use the term "red team" rather loosely. But when I
 was there in the red team we only had one red team that only had
 from two to six people on a team.
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: The whole country?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: Yes.
 			</p><p>MR. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 			</p><p>MR. LEHMAN: Just a quick follow-up. Do you ascribe this
 cover-up or willful ignoring of the results of the red teams to
 clientitis? To pressure from the industry, or to pure
 bureaucratic inertia, or to something else?
 			</p><p>MR. DZAKOVIC: I think it's a combination of a number of
 factors. One is the pressure form the airline industry. The other
 is blatant incompetence on the part of many of the managers. But
 also keep in mind what a red team does. Basically all we do is
 dig up dirt or negative information and you don't get ahead in a
 career in the federal government by constantly bringing up dirt.
 So their reaction was to try to minimize that as much as possible.
 And I think that's what's happening now with the current red team,
 is they are being minimized far short of what they should be
 doing. And if they really wanted to do it right, I think you
 would have to have a red team that is totally independent of TSA
 to actually be doing what they should be doing.
 			</p><p>MR. KEAN: If there are no further question, Mr.
 Dzakovic, thank you very, very much for your time and for your
 appearance. Congressman Hamilton and I will be available for a
 brief press availability I gather right outside those doors, I am
 told. I would ask the Commission members if we could have a brief
 meeting in about 20 minutes back in back of us that shouldn't last
 too long I hope.</p><p align="center">
