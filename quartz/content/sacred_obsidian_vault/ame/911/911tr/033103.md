         <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  The official start of our 
  
        first public hearing is going to be an 
  
        extraordinarily important job, we believe, for the
 
        country.  In my capacity as the Chairman of the 
  
        Commission on Terrorist Attacks in the United 
  
        States, I am honored and humbled to convene this 
  
        first public hearing. 
  
         </p><p>Since my colleagues and I were appointed
 
        at the turn of the year, many people from all walks 
  
        of life, and actually from other nations even, have 
  
        inquired about our work.  And many offered their 
  
        help.  What they really wanted, however, were 
  
        answers.
 
         </p><p>Their questions fall into three basic 
  
        categories:  First, they wanted to know what led to 
  
        the terrorist attacks upon our country September 
  
        11th, that took the lives of almost 3,000 Americans 
  
        and forever changed the lives of millions of
 
        others.  There was not a person alive that day 
  
        whose life was not changed in some way by September 
  
        11th.  
   
         </p><p>Those who perished in those attacks or 
  
        those who were wounded had done nothing to warrant 
  
        it.  They were going about their business.  They 
  
        were doing their jobs.  They were flying to see
 
        family or to conduct business or to spend time with 
  
        loved ones or going or returning from vacations. 
  
         </p><p>They didn't personally know their 
  
        assassins.  Those who attacked them had no 
  
        particular human target in mind.  They just wanted
 
        to kill as many people as possible.  They didn't 
  
        care who the victims were.  All they had to do to 
  
        warrant their killing and maiming, they wanted to 
  
        target buildings or certain airplanes. 
  
         </p><p>Most of whom who died or were injured were
 
        Americans.  The deceased and survivors were of all 
  
        backgrounds, races, religions, creeds and even 
  
        nationalities.  They only had one thing in common. 
  
        They were all at the time doing their best to keep 
  
        ours, the finest, strongest, most productive,
 
        creative, diverse and welcoming democracy that has 
  
        ever been created on the face of the earth, and, 
  
        you see, that's what the terrorists sought to  
   
        destroy. 
  
         </p><p>They wanted to extinguish the very 
  
        freedom, vitality and diversity that characterizes 
  
        the American way of life and makes it the bastion
 
        of hope for so many others in the world. 
  
         </p><p>And they sought to do this by killing 
  
        thousands of our people, disrupting the life 
  
        pattern of this country as a whole, and by 
  
        instilling what they hoped was fear, not only in
 
        our nation but in all nations that allow ideas to 
  
        compete freely and fairly in the open marketplace. 
  
         </p><p>The American people want the answers to so 
  
        many questions around 9/11.  They want to know who 
  
        were these people and how could they have done this
 
        terrible thing to so many innocent people.  What 
  
        kind of fanaticism drove them to do this? 
  
         </p><p>They also want to know how such a 
  
        dastardly attack could occur and succeed in a 
  
        nation as strong as ours, militarily, economically
 
        and technologically.  They want to know what, if 
  
        anything, went wrong on that pacific day, what 
  
        evidence did those charged with safeguarding the  
   
        security of us all, what evidence did they have that 
  
        might somehow have averted this tragedy and how did 
  
        they use it. 
  
         </p><p>What evidence then was available?  What
 
        could have been done to avert this tragedy?  What 
  
        if people had acted differently on that day and the 
  
        days leading up to September 11th?  And finally, 
  
        most importantly, they want to know what can be 
  
        done to prevent future terrorist attacks of this
 
        scale and how can we make this country safer for 
  
        all its people. 
  
         </p><p>In conversations I have had with family 
  
        members of people who perished in the attacks 
  
        against the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and
 
        in that plane crash in a small field in Somerset 
  
        County, Pennsylvania, they told me time and again 
  
        that the one thing they were concerned about was to 
  
        make sure that their loved ones had not died in 
  
        vain.
 
         </p><p>It's horrible enough to see someone you 
  
        love struck down in this manner.  It would be even 
  
        worse for the rest of us to do nothing to prevent  
   
        other families from having to endure such grief and 
  
        pain in the future. 
  
         </p><p>As Chairman of the Commission, I want to 
  
        say that I consider this task the most important
 
        part of our work.  We must not allow the people who 
  
        were struck down to simply become statistics.  Each 
  
        represented a life that was interrupted.  All had 
  
        families, colleagues and friends who care deeply 
  
        about them, all who perished had dreams that are
 
        now unfulfilled.  All became the first casualties 
  
        of what has become a war against the United States, 
  
        declared by international terrorists. 
  
         </p><p>The victims did not know, when they said 
  
        good-bye to their loved ones when they departed for
 
        work or the airport on that fateful morning, that 
  
        they would be part of such a war.  They had no 
  
        weapons and they didn't even know the identity of 
  
        their enemies. 
  
         </p><p>We will, I know, in this country construct
 
        memorials, and we should, to honor these people, 
  
        but the greatest service we can pay those who made 
  
        the ultimate sacrifice and those who survived the  
   
        blaze is to do all we can to assure that no one 
  
        ever again experiences the kind of anguish that 
  
        they endured. 
  
         </p><p>I know there's nothing we can do on this
 
        Commission to bring anybody back to life, but those 
  
        who were taken from us on September 11th, we can 
  
        work to assure that no future families suffer in 
  
        this way, the way so many people have suffered. 
  
        And this is what our Commission intends to do.
 
         </p><p>I want to say a word or two about the 
  
        purpose of today's hearing.  In the parlance of 
  
        Congress, this is not an investigative hearing but 
  
        an informal one.  Today we will not, as we'll be 
  
        doing in the future, be cross-examining witnesses.
 
        The Mayor and Governor are coming.  They are coming 
  
        to welcome us.  We will have questions for them 
  
        probably later, but today we will not be doing 
  
        that. 
  
         </p><p>We will be doing that on, as I say, a
 
        number of other occasions.  And some of our 
  
        meetings will be in public, some will not be in 
  
        public because of the kind of sensitive materials  
   
        that we will be dealing with.  On those occasions, 
  
        we will be able to have extensive discussions with 
  
        many people who will be testifying today and 
  
        tomorrow.
 
         </p><p>On this first day of our hearing, we will 
  
        be seeking to ascertain what those who feel a 
  
        personal stake in our deliberations think is 
  
        important for us to study. 
  
         </p><p>We will hear from people who have lived
 
        and survived the attacks on the World Trade Center 
  
        and the Pentagon.  We will hear from 
  
        representatives of families of those who died in 
  
        those attacks.  We will hear from the governor of 
  
        this great state and the mayor of this great city.
 
        And finally, we will hear from a number of others 
  
        who have a particular interest in the events of 
  
        that terrible day. 
  
         </p><p>Tomorrow we will hear from people who have 
  
        particular expertise in national terrorism, the
 
        kinds of actions that made the attacks on September 
  
        11th possible, and the kinds of measures that might 
  
        be taken to avoid such future events.  
   
         </p><p>Before I turn over the floor to our Vice 
  
        Chairman, Lee Hamilton, I want to say a couple, two 
  
        additional things about what this Commission will 
  
        and will not attempt to do and something about the
 
        Commission itself. 
  
         </p><p>As I said, our purpose is to find out why 
  
        things happened, how they could have happened, and 
  
        what we can do to prevent their ever happening 
  
        again.  We will be following paths and we will
 
        follow those individual paths wherever they lead. 
  
        We may end up holding individual agencies, people 
  
        and procedures to account. 
  
         </p><p>But our fundamental purpose will not be to 
  
        point fingers, it is rather to answer fully the
 
        questions that so many still have and, most 
  
        importantly, as I say, to prevent and to do 
  
        everything we can to make the American people safer 
  
        so we will not have this kind of thing ever happen 
  
        again.
 
         </p><p>As we were getting ourselves organized, I 
  
        asked members of the Commission staff, were there 
  
        any precedents for what we were about to do.  And I  
   
        came forward with two commissions.  Both came into 
  
        being in the aftermath of other national tragedies. 
  
         </p><p>Those who are old enough to remember the 
  
        bombing of Pearl Harbor and the assassination of
 
        President Kennedy remember those commissions well. 
  
        Neither fully satisfied the hopes of those that 
  
        created them. 
  
         </p><p>It seems there are no real precedents for 
  
        what we're about to attempt.  To succeed, we are
 
        going to need the cooperation of the Congress, the 
  
        national administration, federal, state and local 
  
        law enforcement and other agencies, think tanks, 
  
        foundations, university professors, business, 
  
        industry and labor, survivors, witnesses, and
 
        ordinary citizens.  And I thank them in advance for 
  
        their help. 
  
         </p><p>Finally, about the Commission itself:  We 
  
        were created by the United States Congress for a 
  
        specific purpose.  I have outlined in a general way
 
        what we hope to do.  The Commission operates in a 
  
        strictly nonpartisan nature.  Five of us happen to 
  
        be registered as Republicans, five of us as  
   
        Democrats, but we're not going to operate as party 
  
        members, and the staff is not partisan. 
  
         </p><p>All of us, in one capacity or another, 
  
        have served in government.  None of us still do.
 
        None of us have any agenda but getting to the truth 
  
        to make ours a safer country. 
  
         </p><p>I want in particular to single out the 
  
        Vice Chairman of this Commission, Lee Hamilton.  I 
  
        have long admired Congressman Hamilton for his
 
        public service, in the truest sense of the word, 
  
        and what he has done for this country.  I am very 
  
        honored to be able to serve with him on this 
  
        particular Commission. 
  
         </p><p>Today marks the first occasion when the
 
        American people will have an opportunity to see who 
  
        we are.  Each of us had our own reasons for 
  
        accepting the call to serve on this Commission. 
  
         </p><p>For eight years I have had the honor to 
  
        serve as Governor of the State of New Jersey.  I
 
        was born here in this great city, attended graduate 
  
        school at Columbia, met my wife here.  I've spent 
  
        almost my entire life living and working around  
   
        this region. 
  
         </p><p>I remember when the World Trade Center was 
  
        built.  I must have been in it hundreds of times. 
  
        I appointed half the commissions to the Port
 
        Authority when I was Governor.  I was well 
  
        acquainted with many of its employees and knew some 
  
        of those who died on September 11th as friends. 
  
         </p><p>As a private citizen, I sat on the board 
  
        of a company who lost over 80 people on that
 
        terrible day.  I delivered the eulogy at that 
  
        memorial service.  As a university president, I 
  
        counseled students who were grieving on that 
  
        terrible day and afterwards. 
  
         </p><p>Not far from where I live, a young pastor
 
        of a rural church that serves no more than two- or 
  
        three-thousand families told the local newspaper he 
  
        had performed nine funeral masses on a single day. 
  
        I didn't lose any member of my family on that 
  
        particular day, but I did lose a lot of friends in
 
        the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and that 
  
        flight. 
  
         </p><p>Adlai Stevenson said, when he learned of  
   
        John Kennedy's assassination, each of us who was 
  
        alive will carry the memory of that particular 
  
        death until the day of ours.  That is how we feel 
  
        about September 11th.
 
         </p><p>Thank you,  and I will now call on 
  
        Congressman Lee Hamilton, the Vice Chairman of the 
  
        Commission. 
  
         </p><p>VICE CHAIRMAN HAMILTON:  Good morning, 
  
        Governor.  Thank you for a very moving and eloquent
 
        statement. 
  
         </p><p>Governor Kean is an inspired choice to 
  
        lead this Commission.  He's the only member of the 
  
        Commission appointed by the President, and I 
  
        commend the President for his appointment.  The
 
        other members of the Commission are appointed by 
  
        members of Congress. 
  
         </p><p>I am very pleased to serve with Governor 
  
        Kean on this Commission, as Vice Chairman, and I 
  
        have appreciated already his remarkable leadership
 
        as I have talked with him over the phone every day 
  
        now for the past four or five months. 
  
         </p><p>I'm pleased and privileged to be joined by  
   
        my fellow Commissioners.  Each bring remarkable and 
  
        unique experience from public service and from 
  
        private life.  They really are an exceptional 
  
        group, a talented group, that gives me high
 
        confidence that this Commission will successfully 
  
        complete its awesome task.  Each of us believes 
  
        that this is as serious an undertaking as any in 
  
        which we have been involved. 
  
         </p><p>The Commission exists to understand what
 
        happened on September 11th and to protect our 
  
        nation against future attack.  Our mandate is to 
  
        look back, to learn the vital lessons of 9/11, to 
  
        look forward, to make recommendations that leave 
  
        the United States and its people safer.
 
         </p><p>Our primary task is to answer one 
  
        essential question:  What can we do to prevent 
  
        another 9/11? 
  
         </p><p>Our mandate is breathtakingly broad. 
  
        After all, 9/11 was not simply a failure of a
 
        single person or department of government but 
  
        rather a systemic breakdown of our government's 
  
        defenses, our preparedness for catastrophic  
   
        terrorism and our understanding of a new world in 
  
        which threats develop an ocean away and strike us 
  
        with horrifying impact within our own borders. 
  
         </p><p>Thus, our mandate, as stated by the
 
        Congress and reaffirmed by the President, extends 
  
        to many areas of policy.  We are specifically 
  
        mandated to scrutinize intelligence, law 
  
        enforcement, diplomacy, immigration and border 
  
        controls, the financing of terrorism, commercial
 
        aviation, Congressional oversight of 
  
        counterterrorism efforts and other areas that we, 
  
        as a Commission, deem relevant. 
  
         </p><p>In all we do as a Commission, we will 
  
        strive to be independent, impartial, thorough, and
 
        nonpartisan.  The Commission will provide a factual 
  
        record of September 11, 2001, how events developed 
  
        and how our nation responded, from the first 
  
        responders at the Pentagon and the World Trade 
  
        Center, to the national leadership.
 
         </p><p>As the Chairman has already said, we will 
  
        also seek a better understanding of the enemy.  How 
  
        did al Qaeda emerge as a threat?  How did our  
   
        government's counterterrorism policy evolve?  What 
  
        have been our successes and our failures, and what 
  
        are the broad foreign-policy lessons of 9/11? 
  
         </p><p>I believe this Commission can and will
 
        make a significant and valuable impact worthy of 
  
        the attention and scrutiny of the American people 
  
        and policymakers. 
  
         </p><p>Much good work has already been done on 
  
        several issues before us.  The Congressional Joint
 
        Inquiry into the intelligence failures of 9/11 has 
  
        concluded its work and many other credible sources 
  
        have analyzed the issues that confront this 
  
        Commission, but the Joint Inquiry's focus was 
  
        limited to intelligence and other inquiries have
 
        lacked the breadth of our mandate. 
  
         </p><p>Now, some 18 months after that terrifying 
  
        day, we still have no comprehensive analysis of 
  
        9/11, no authoritative record of the many forces 
  
        that led to the attacks, no definitive narrative of
 
        the events of the day, and no set of 
  
        recommendations to address the wide assortment of 
  
        government policies and concerns related to the  
   
        attack. 
  
         </p><p>Today the Commission holds the first of 
  
        its public hearings.  The Commission is committed 
  
        to public hearings such as these for two reasons.
 
         </p><p>First, we are revisiting a seismic event 
  
        in American history and the lives of all Americans, 
  
        and we are working on issues of the utmost 
  
        importance to their safety and security.  Thus, we 
  
        are obligated to keep the American people as
 
        informed as we can of our work and our findings. 
  
         </p><p>Second, the American people are our 
  
        greatest resource.  The success of our inquiry 
  
        depends upon their intelligence, fortitude and good 
  
        will.  We will do our best to engage Americans of
 
        all walks of life to complete our work. 
  
         </p><p>Today we seek guidance from individuals 
  
        who can offer unique perspective and valuable 
  
        vision.  We will hear from the survivors of the 
  
        attack who can relate to us the awful experience of
 
        that day.  We will hear from the families of the 
  
        victims. 
  
         </p><p>Nobody suffered a greater loss on that  
   
        terrible day.  This loss both focuses and informs 
  
        our work.  The families offer a solemn reminder of 
  
        the gravity of our inquiry.  And through the 
  
        knowledge they have acquired in seeking answers to
 
        their many questions, the families also are a very 
  
        valuable resource. 
  
         </p><p>We will hear from the first responders who 
  
        were called to duty on 9/11.  Their brave and 
  
        extraordinarily capable example set this nation on
 
        a path towards recovery and their experience is 
  
        essential to our understanding of the events of the 
  
        day and our preparedness for future attacks. 
  
         </p><p>And we will hear from public officials who 
  
        coordinated this city and state's response.  They
 
        too were on the front lines in their 
  
        decision-making and marshalling of resources.  We 
  
        look forward to their wisdom on preventing, 
  
        preparing for, and responding to terrorist attacks. 
  
         </p><p>We step into a moving stream.  We operate
 
        in the context of the war on terror, which includes 
  
        operations abroad, some precautions already taken, 
  
        with more under consideration, and a government  
   
        that is reshaping itself to combat terrorism.  And 
  
        all the while, the threat of another attack looms. 
  
        The urgency of our work is apparent. 
  
         </p><p>Our staff, very ably led by Dr. Zelikow
 
        and Chris Kojm, represents some of the finest 
  
        expertise in the country.  We are establishing an 
  
        office in New York, as well as Washington.  We have 
  
        contacted all the various agencies we will be 
  
        working with in the coming months.
 
         </p><p>We have received assurances of cooperation 
  
        from the White House and from the Congress.  We 
  
        have set a course, an infrastructure, to meet the 
  
        charge of our mandate.  And we have begun to review 
  
        and build upon, not duplicate, the foundation of
 
        good work that has already been done by the Joint 
  
        Inquiry and many others. 
  
         </p><p>Our time is short and much work lies 
  
        ahead.  We have miles to go before we sleep.  At 
  
        the end of our work, it is my hope that we will
 
        have helped insure the security of the American homeland. 
  
        What greater or more urgent task could there be 
  
        than understanding this national tragedy and  
   
        working to strengthen the safety of the American 
  
        people? 
  
         </p><p>All want this Commission to succeed.  With 
  
        the help of our witnesses today and the many more
 
        to follow, we will produce a record that we trust 
  
        will stand the tests of time, a record that 
  
        heightens our understanding of the challenges ahead 
  
        and sets our course, as a nation, toward peace and 
  
        stability.
 
         </p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you, Congressman 
  
        Hamilton.  Now I'd like to introduce Commissioner 
  
        Fred Fielding. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER FIELDING:  Thank you, Mr.
 
        Chairman.  Good morning. 
  
         </p><p>At the outset, let me state how honored 
  
        and awed I am to be a member of this Commission and 
  
        to have the opportunity and privilege of working 
  
        with the Chairman, the Vice Chairman and my fellow
 
        Commissioners. 
  
         </p><p>It is a very onerous and huge task ahead 
  
        of us, and I can only pledge to provide all the  
   
        time, energy and skill I may possess to the 
  
        complete fulfillment of such important goals. 
  
         </p><p>For my part, I come to this task with no 
  
        preconceptions as to what we may find and no
 
        preconceived agenda as to what we may ultimately 
  
        recommend. 
  
         </p><p>I do, however, come with the anger and 
  
        sorrow and the despair shared by others over the acts 
  
        of 9/11 and over the loss we suffered to our
 
        national sense of domestic security and of the 
  
        losses, the senseless and vicious losses, of 
  
        friends and family and innocent people. 
  
         </p><p>I personally lost a dear friend who was 
  
        also the wife of a very close and longtime
 
        colleague and friend of mine.  I also personally 
  
        lost a delightful and most promising young law 
  
        partner, Karen Kincaide.  Her presence is so sorely 
  
        missed at the law firm. 
  
         </p><p>So I can't say that I am dispassionate and
 
        I can't say that I am totally objective about that 
  
        day, but we all suffered losses in various and 
  
        varied degrees.  And that collective loss must be  
   
        the motivation to be sure that everything is done 
  
        to prevent this from happening again. 
  
         </p><p>We must not rush to judgment, to be sure, 
  
        but we surely must make judgments.  As I see our
 
        mission, it is to carefully look to the past in 
  
        order that we can then realistically look to the 
  
        present and ultimately formulate credible 
  
        recommendations for the future. 
  
         </p><p>We must be fair and respectful and
 
        impartial in our work, but we must also be thorough 
  
        and surgical in our pursuit of these facts.  We 
  
        must follow facts wherever they lead.  There are no 
  
        sacred cows in this endeavor. 
  
         </p><p>We must be respectful to our institutions
 
        at every and all levels of government, but we must 
  
        also honor the mandate given to us to be as 
  
        thorough as possible in order to make the most 
  
        relevant findings and recommendations. 
  
         </p><p>I don't know where the facts will lead us
 
        when we seek to determine and to understand not 
  
        only what happened on that horrible day but also 
  
        how it could happen and how our government entities  
   
        were then dealing with the threat that gave rise to 
  
        it. 
  
         </p><p>And I don't know where the facts will lead 
  
        us as we probe the various institutions of our
 
        government, federal, state, executive, legislative, 
  
        to determine how each of these institutions was 
  
        poised and prepared to deal with other actions that 
  
        could have possibly occurred or, God forbid, 
  
        actions that can occur.
 
         </p><p>Further, we must probe to see if 
  
        institutional oversight, pressure, or actions 
  
        inhibited in any way the role or the degree of 
  
        vigilance that was necessary. 
  
         </p><p>To repeat the obvious, we don't know where
 
        these facts will lead us, but we will seek the 
  
        facts and have them lead us to conclusions which 
  
        then, and only then, can be the basis for realistic 
  
        recommendations that will hopefully mitigate the 
  
        possibility that we might again suffer the assaults
 
        of those who want to attack our way of life by 
  
        attacking and terrorizing our citizens and our 
  
        people in this country.  
   
         </p><p>A word of self-imposed caution is needed. 
  
        Probity, skill, intelligence, good judgment-they're 
  
        all necessary to accomplishing our 
  
        responsibility and should be the hallmarks of our
 
        conduct in our deliberations. But most important is 
  
        our task of instilling in the public confidence in 
  
        our objectivity. 
  
         </p><p>Critics will look to any indicia of 
  
        partisanship, divisiveness or disarray, and we must
 
        be vigilant to resist anything that leads to such a 
  
        conclusion.  History has shown that such actions, and 
  
        especially things such as leaks of sensitive 
  
        information prematurely, create the destruction of 
  
        a commission's work and its vitality and,
 
        therefore, its credibility and its validity. 
  
         </p><p>In today's world, I suspect no commission 
  
        will ever be able to satisfy everyone by its work, 
  
        but we must do everything we can to satisfy anyone 
  
        about the objective way we operate.  We have to
 
        have a shared commitment to an effort that is not 
  
        only thorough but is thoroughly fair and thoroughly 
  
        impartial and thoroughly nonpartisan.  
   
         </p><p>Those who attacked us on September 11th 
  
        wanted to usher in not a brave new world but a 
  
        cowardly one, a world in which terrorists who envy 
  
        our freedom and despise our values are willing to
 
        slaughter the innocent through any means at their 
  
        disposal. 
  
         </p><p>We have collectively learned this unwillingly, and at the cost of great 
  
        suffering, great shock and great sorrow. We now 
  
        have a challenge to prepare a report that will
 
        honor those who died on September 11th, their 
  
        families and friends who remain, and all the 
  
        Americans who are trusting us to help the President 
  
        and Congress to guard against any such other 
  
        attacks.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you, Commissioner. 
  
        Commissioner Richard Ben-Veniste. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE:  Thank you, Mr. 
  
        Chairman, Mr. Co-Chairman, fellow Commissioners. 
  
        Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
 
         </p><p>Like countless Americans, I felt the 
  
        searing pain, shock and horror of the brutal 
  
        September 11th attacks upon my fellow citizens and  
   
        the symbols of American greatness and power. 
  
         </p><p>Less than two weeks before the September 
  
        11th attacks, I brought my family to visit the 
  
        World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty.  Like tens of thousands of others on September 
  
        11th, I realized, there but for the grace of God go 
  
        I. 
  
         </p><p>In the intervening time since the 
  
        September 11th attacks, we have learned a great
 
        deal about what happened on that day and the events 
  
        leading up to it.  In particular, we are grateful 
  
        for the work of the Joint Inquiry conducted by the 
  
        Senate and House Intelligence Committees. 
  
         </p><p>Congress has specifically instructed us to
 
        build upon the good work of the Joint Inquiry as we 
  
        proceed with our investigation and develop 
  
        recommendations for Congress and the President. 
  
         </p><p>Yet the Joint Inquiry's full report had 
  
        only just last week been made available to the
 
        members of this Commission who have their full 
  
        security clearances.  As of last week, most of the 
  
        Commissioners and most of the staff had not yet  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        received security clearances. 
  
         </p><p>I believe the scheduling of this hearing 
  
        has had a salutary effect on speeding up the 
  
        clearance process and I am gratified that the White
 
        House has now promised the funds necessary to carry 
  
        out our work. 
  
         </p><p>It is important that President Bush has 
  
        publicly supported this Commission and its goals. 
  
        The full cooperation of the relevant departments
 
        and agencies of the executive branch is essential 
  
        to the Commission's ability to carry out its 
  
        responsibilities.  And the result of such 
  
        cooperation will be a measure of our success. 
  
         </p><p>I am pleased that in recent weeks the
 
        Commission has made good progress in hiring an
  
        excellent staff, capable of carrying out the 
  
        ambitious agenda Congress has set out for us. 
  
         </p><p>From an historical perspective, it would 
  
        seem that the closest precedent to our assignment
 
        was the Roberts Commission, created by President 
  
        Roosevelt immediately after the Japanese attack on 
  
        Pearl Harbor.  The Roberts Commission failed to  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        address certain fundamental aspects of our 
  
        unpreparedness at Pearl Harbor and was criticized 
  
        by subsequent inquiries for serious omissions and 
  
        impaired conclusions.
 
         </p><p>We must be thorough and diligent in our 
  
        work in order to get it right.  We have been given 
  
        an historic opportunity to contribute to the public 
  
        good and to provide a record that will withstand 
  
        the test of time.
 
         </p><p>In fulfilling our responsibilities, it is 
  
        imperative that we assess our vulnerability to 
  
        terrorist attacks, and specifically, why we were 
  
        unprepared for the attacks of September 11, 2001. 
  
         </p><p>No department or agency in this
 
        administration, or any other, is exempted from our 
  
        careful review.  I do not, however, interpret our 
  
        investigative mandate to be an invitation to engage 
  
        in finger-pointing or to participate in the blame 
  
        game.  Rather, it is the essential precursor to a
 
        reasoned analysis of how changes and improvements 
  
        to our security apparatus can and should be made. 
  
         </p><p>I have had the privilege of meeting with  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        representatives of families of citizens who died in 
  
        the September 11th attacks.  The loss that they 
  
        have suffered is beyond measure, but their strength 
  
        and determination will continue to keep our nation
 
        and this Commission focused on answering the 
  
        questions posed by this tragedy. 
  
         </p><p>The personal involvement of surviving 
  
        family members was central to the 
  
        creation of this Commission, and I welcome their
 
        continued involvement as we go forward with our 
  
        work. 
  
         </p><p>Among the many challenges facing our 
  
        nation is the need for balance as we respond to the 
  
        real and ongoing threat of terrorist attacks.
 
        While our focus on protection of the homeland is 
  
        paramount, we must be ever mindful of the 
  
        collateral consequences of measures which may 
  
        threaten our vital personal and civil liberties. 
  
         </p><p>There is no question but that we must
 
        factor into the equation of proper balance the 
  
        capacity of our adversaries to exploit the 
  
        protections afforded by our Constitutional  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        guarantees of freedom of religion and due process 
  
        of law to advance their nefarious objectives. 
  
         </p><p>This balancing will be no easy task, but 
  
        it is imperative that we get it right.  And I hope
 
        this Commission will make recommendations that 
  
        reflect the importance of that balancing. 
  
         </p><p>In 1989, Justice Thurgood Marshall warned, 
  
        "History teaches us that grave threats to liberty 
  
        often come in times of urgency when Constitutional
 
        rights seem too extravagant to endure." 
  
         </p><p>Similarly, in 1995, Justice Sandra Day 
  
        O'Connor cautioned, "It can never be too often 
  
        stated that the greatest threats to our 
  
        Constitutional freedoms come in times of crisis."
 
         </p><p>If the acts of al Qaeda and other 
  
        terrorist organizations who mean us harm result in 
  
        a response that disproportionately curtails the 
  
        personal freedoms and civil liberties that define 
  
        our American way of life, then our enemies will
 
        have won a great victory without taking another 
  
        life. 
  
         </p><p>In conclusion, our Commission was created  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        to operate outside the permanent structure of the 
  
        three branches of government.  In addition to the 
  
        experience and judgment we can bring to bear to 
  
        this assignment, we can offer another critically
 
        important quality, our independence and 
  
        objectivity. 
  
         </p><p>We can and must consider carefully the 
  
        actions and roles of all three branches of 
  
        government as they operate to respond to the threat
 
        of further terrorist attacks.  We should offer 
  
        objective, neutral analysis, with no pre-set agenda 
  
        or allegiance to any agency or branch of government 
  
        or political party.  No lesser standard will 
  
        satisfy our nation's expectation of this
 
        Commission.  Thank you. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you, Commissioner. 
  
        Commissioner Slade Gorton. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORTON:  Mr. Chairman, the 
  
        members of this Commission are charged by the
 
        Congress of the United States to produce a thorough 
  
        and dispassionate history of the events, the 
  
        individuals, the organizations and the ideas that  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        led up to 9/11, together with the immediate 
  
        response of American institutions to that attack. 
  
         </p><p>I'm convinced at the same time that the 
  
        members of this Commission are charged by our
 
        consciences never to forget, never to have at any 
  
        place other than the forefront of our thoughts the 
  
        individuals whose lives were lost in this attack 
  
        and the far larger number of lives that were 
  
        devastated by that attack.
 
         </p><p>We are charged by the Congress of the 
  
        United States to analyze the structural and human 
  
        failures that resulted in the failure of this 
  
        nation's defenses, adequately or at all, to 
  
        anticipate and to prevent this attack.  We are told
 
        by the statute that created us to build on the work 
  
        of the Joint Congressional Inquiry, which has done 
  
        much good work but which recognized its own 
  
        incompleteness and inadequacy. 
  
         </p><p>I am convinced that one of the important
 
        aspects of this Commission's work is to examine 
  
        what has taken place in the 18 months since 9/11 to 
  
        prevent future such attacks.  Have we changed our  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        ways?  Is our intelligence better?  Are 
  
        preventative measures in effect?  Could we do a 
  
        better job in the future than they have in the 
  
        past?
 
         </p><p>Beyond that, however, I agree one hundred 
  
        percent with our Chairman's remarks that we are to 
  
        come up with recommendations as to future and 
  
        additional changes, changes in the structure of our 
  
        intelligence and law- enforcement agencies, perhaps
 
        more difficult, a recommendation of attitudinal 
  
        changes with respect to the way that individuals in 
  
        positions of authority respond and do their 
  
        job. 
  
         </p><p>And finally, I'd like to echo the remarks
 
        of my colleague, Mr. Ben-Veniste.  The object of 
  
        the attack of 9/11 was a free and open society 
  
        which those attackers hated and wished to destroy. 
  
         </p><p>An immense challenge before this 
  
        Commission and before the people of the United
 
        States is to determine ways in which that free and 
  
        open society can far better prevent future such 
  
        attacks, with a full balance and respect for the  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        values of that free society of individual liberty 
  
        and openness. 
  
         </p><p>This is in my view a huge task which I 
  
        approach, I trust, with due humility in the hope
 
        and the expectation that the 10 members of this 
  
        Commission will carry out this task not only 
  
        honorably but effectively and with a result that 
  
        causes the respect and the acceptance of the 
  
        American people.
 
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you, Commissioner. 
  
        Commissioner Jamie Gorelick. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  Thank you, Mr. 
  
        Chairman.  Good morning.  Thank you, Tom Kean and 
  
        Lee Hamilton, for your leadership of this
 
        Commission. 
  
         </p><p>The first obligation of government is to 
  
        protect its people.  And clearly our government 
  
        failed to do that on September 11th.  As a country, 
  
        we have since declared war on terrorism, but as
 
        those schooled in the art of war know, history is 
  
        the best teacher. 
  
         </p><p>And it is for that reason that our  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        military, since the Revolutionary War when George 
  
        Washington appointed Baron von Steuben to assess 
  
        how our newly formed Army could do better, our 
  
        military has consistently demanded, in meticulous
 
        detail, after-action reports of every military 
  
        event so that in the future our actions could be 
  
        informed by both our successes and our failures. 
  
         </p><p>That principle has also been adopted in 
  
        our civilian agencies by act of Congress.  We have
 
        inspectors general in every civilian agency.  And they 
  
        know, as do their military counterparts, that our 
  
        consistent history is a prompt, effective and, most 
  
        importantly, unflinching review of our failures, 
  
        even, even when it is hard to accept the truth.
 
         </p><p>Now there may not be perfect historical 
  
        analogies to what we undertake here today, but we 
  
        have a consistent history of prompt, effective and 
  
        unflinching reviews.  We have already failed to 
  
        undertake this review promptly.
 
         </p><p>The statute establishing this Commission 
  
        was not passed until nearly a year and a half after 
  
        September 11, 2001.  And we have, to be sure,  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        encountered some obstacles in getting this inquiry 
  
        off the ground. But we are now underway, and 
  
        underway forcefully. 
  
         </p><p>Whatever difficulties we encounter, I
 
        will dedicate myself, as I know my fellow 
  
        colleagues will do also, to overcoming them because 
  
        we have to.  We must get this right.  If we don't, 
  
        we will fail to learn from our mistakes. 
  
         </p><p>I am a native of New York.  I am a
 
        long-time Washingtonian.  The two communities that 
  
        I call mine, where my children and my family and 
  
        friends want and need to feel safe, are the ones 
  
        that feel our vulnerability the most.  So I come to 
 
  
        this task with a great sense of urgency, which is
 
        underscored by my meetings and my communications 
  
        with the representatives of the families of the 
  
        victims. 
  
         </p><p>In my career I have dedicated myself to a 
  
        strong national defense, to a safe and secure
 
        domestic life, and to the protection of our 
  
        precious liberties.  And I pledge to those here and 
  
        to those who have placed their fate in this  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        Commission's work that I will bring every ounce of 
  
        my energy and each of those perspectives to bear as 
  
        we undertake the solemn obligations of this 
  
        Commission's work.  Thank you.
 
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Commissioner John Lehman. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN:  Thank you, Mr. 
  
        Chairman.  Good morning.  In my career I have 
  
        served in the Naval Forces, the National Security 
  
        Council Staff, the State Department, as a diplomat,
 
        and as Secretary of the Navy. 
  
         </p><p>In that last tour on my watch, I lost 241 
  
        Marines and sailors to a state-sponsored terrorist 
  
        attack in Beirut.  Most of those perpetrators today 
  
        are still recruiting and training terrorists.  Both
 
        of those states that sponsored that attack are 
  
        still harboring and sponsoring terrorism.  And it 
  
        has been a continuing dedication on my part to see 
  
        that the lessons that should be drawn from that 
  
        experience are applied in government.
 
         </p><p>So far, that has not been terribly 
  
        successful. But my experience in government has 
  
        certainly taught me one great lesson, that the  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        genius of our system is that we do learn the 
  
        lessons of history.  It takes us more time perhaps 
  
        in our democratic methods than we would prefer, but 
  
        I am a believer in the way our system, haltingly
 
        but inevitably, learns the lessons of history so that 
  
        they are not repeated. 
  
         </p><p>I think that our Commission is the ideal 
  
        vehicle, the ideal catalyst, to see that the 
  
        lessons of 9/11 are promptly applied, to see that
 
        they are not repeated as, unfortunately, our 
  
        experience in Beirut has been repeated numerous 
  
        times in the intervening decade. 
  
         </p><p>And so I think you will see a very 
  
        intense, a very active process in pursuing this
 
        investigation, in seeing that the recommendations 
  
        of previous commissions, the longstanding and 
  
        understood shortcomings in the organization of our 
  
        government that have been identified by a number of 
  
        previous commissions but never acted on, are going
 
        to be focused on and the new nature of the spread 
  
        of international terrorism is understood and 
  
        applied in concrete recommendations and proposals  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        that will issue from this Commission. 
  
         </p><p>And I'm confident that the Executive 
  
        Branch in Congress, with the catalyst of this 
  
        Commission's work, will see that those proposals
 
        are implemented and we indeed will learn the 
  
        lessons of history and not repeat them.  Thank you. 
  
 				</p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you, Commissioner 
  
        Lehman.  We are going to interrupt the statements 
  
        from the Commissioners because Governor Pataki has
 
        arrived.  Governor, we welcome you.  Thank you 
  
        very much for coming. 
  
         </p><p>GOVERNOR PATAKI:  Good morning, Chairman 
  
        Kean, Vice Chairman Hamilton, and members of the 
  
        Commission.  It's a privilege to be here before you
 
        this morning on behalf of the 19 million citizens of New 
  
        York State.  I have formal comments that you have 
  
        before you, and you're welcome to make them a part 
  
        of the record, but I would just like to reflect a 
  
        little bit on my thoughts of September 11th.
 
         </p><p>Thank you for your efforts to make sure 
  
        that every step is taken to make sure that America 
  
        is prepared and proactive to try to make sure it  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        doesn't happen again and if there are additional 
  
        attacks against anyone anywhere in America, we're 
  
        prepared to respond appropriately. 
  
         </p><p>Of course, when I think of September 11th,
 
        the first overwhelming feeling I have is a sense of 
  
        loss, a sense of loss of not just the hundreds of 
  
        brave firefighters and police officers and Port 
  
        Authority police officers, but also of the 
  
        thousands of civilians, just ordinary people who
 
        went to work that morning with their normal dreams 
  
        for a good day and a better future for themselves 
  
        and their families. 
  
         </p><p>You can't help but have a tremendous 
  
        sense of loss when you reflect on the individuals,
 
        friends that I know and so many in New York whom we 
  
        lost on that morning. But the second thought I have 
  
        is one of overwhelming pride and a tremendous sense 
  
        of the courage of those who faced unspeakable 
  
        tragedy with such incredible willingness to
 
        sacrifice.  And because of that courage, because of 
  
        that willingness to sacrifice, the efforts of the 
  
        terrorists on September 11th failed.  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
         </p><p>Now certainly they succeeded in bringing 
  
        down two towers, two symbols of American strength 
  
        and in the process killing thousands of innocent 
  
        people in a way that has broken our hearts. But
 
        they didn't want to break our hearts, they wanted 
  
        to break our spirit.  They didn't want to bring 
  
        down towers, they wanted to bring down our 
  
        confidence and our freedom and our way of life. 
  
         </p><p>And because of the way that ordinary New
 
        Yorkers responded with extraordinary courage, 
  
        instead of seeing us divided and frightened, we saw 
  
        us unified and inspired. 
  
         </p><p>I can recall the morning of September 
  
        11th walking the streets of lower Manhattan and
 
        seeing in front of St. Luke's Hospital doctors and 
  
        nurses lined up with gurneys.  Maybe they were 
  
        frightened because no one knew what might happen 
  
        next, but their fear was overcome by their courage 
  
        and their willingness to stand out in the streets
 
        of lower Manhattan in the hopes that injured people 
  
        would be brought that they could treat. 
  
         </p><p>I walked the streets of lower  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        Manhattan.  I will never forget turning a 
  
        corner and seeing more than a block of ordinary New 
  
        Yorkers lining the street.  And they weren't lining 
  
        the street to catch the subway uptown or to catch a
 
        bus out of town.  They were lined up, in the midst 
  
        of this fear and uncertainty, to give blood in the 
  
        hopes that somehow they could help New Yorkers 
  
        overcome this tragedy. 
  
         </p><p>All of the superficial differences that on
 
        the morning of September 11th seemed so important, 
  
        whether it was race or religion or politics or 
  
        economic position, disappeared in the sense of 
  
        unity and the sense that we had been attacked and 
  
        we were going to get through this together.
 
         </p><p>And it was with extraordinary pride that I 
  
        walked those streets of lower Manhattan and saw 
  
        how yes, our firefighters and our police officers 
  
        and our emergency-service workers charged into 
  
        those towers with no regard for their own lives to
 
        save others, but also with the pride of the 
  
        ordinary New Yorkers, who 
  
        responded with such courage.  And since that day  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        that sense of unity and that sense of courage is 
  
        something I believe still is very strong here in 
  
        New York. 
  
         </p><p>We are going to hear from family
 
        members who lost their loved ones on September 
  
        11th.  Their courage, their strength, a year and a 
  
        half later, is something that still inspires me 
  
        and, I believe, still inspires Americans. 
  
         </p><p>And we are going to rebuild Ground Zero in
 
        a way that makes it a symbol of the resurgence of 
  
        New York and the confidence Americans have in our 
  
        freedom, but at the same time, we're going to be 
  
        respectful and we're going to never forget that 
  
        almost 3,000 heroes were lost on that day.  And we
 
        are going to make sure we have a memorial that is 
  
        appropriate for all time and a symbol of courage 
  
        and a symbol of the sacrifice those heroes made on 
  
        that day. 
  
         </p><p>As we watch the nightly news and now see
 
        the war against terror being fought in the Middle 
  
        East, a lot of people say that, well, perhaps 
  
        almost two weeks ago the first shots of that war  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        were fired.  In my view, the first shots of that 
  
        war were fired September 11, 2001, right here in 
  
        New York City. 
  
         </p><p>In my view, the heroes and the martyrs
 
        of September 11th were the first casualties in that 
  
        war, a war we're going to win.  And when we win 
  
        that war, New York and America and the world will 
  
        be a safer place because of that. 
  
         </p><p>Last week I had the privilege of being in
 
        Fort Drum, which is a military base in upstate New 
  
        York, when the 77th Regional Command U.S. Army Reserve 
  
        Unit was mobilized and on their way to the Middle 
  
        East.  I had a chance to talk to them and talk 
  
        to their commanding general.
 
         </p><p>The 77th has suffered six fatalities in 
  
        this war.  They didn't suffer them in the Middle 
  
        East. They suffered them on September 11th when 
  
        firefighters, and a lawyer, one of them a very 
  
        close friend of mine, died responding to that
 
        attack.  And they are going over there with a 
  
        tremendous sense of pride and a tremendous sense of 
  
        mission knowing that their first casualties will  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        not occur in Iraq. They occurred on the streets of 
  
        New York. 
  
         </p><p>So as we go forward, I can't help but 
  
        think of the President's comments when he addressed
 
        the people of America on the eve of the war.  And 
  
        the President said, one of the points that has 
  
        stuck with me and will always stick with me, is that 
  
        this war against terror should be fought by our 
  
        soldiers and our sailors and our Marines and our
 
        Air Force and not by our firefighters and police 
  
        officers.  That to me is an important lesson of 
  
        September 11th. 
  
         </p><p>I am sure this Commission, as it goes about 
  
        its hearings and listens to so many people, will
 
        learn a lot of other lessons of September 11th.  I 
  
        thank you for your service.  I thank you for your 
  
        commitment and willingness to put in the time and 
  
        the effort to try to do everything we can to 
  
        protect the people of New York and to protect the
 
        people of America. 
  
         </p><p>New York State government and I'm sure the 
  
        people of New York stand ready to cooperate in any  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        way we possibly can to help you on this important 
  
        mission.  Again, let me just say that when you 
  
        think of September 11th, yes, we will never forget 
  
        the sadness and the heroes, but let's never forget
 
        the courage and the strength that ordinary New 
  
        Yorkers showed under extraordinary circumstances. 
  
        Thank you and God bless you.  Thank you, Chairman. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you, Governor. 
  
        Thank you very much.  I'd like to introduce
 
        Commissioner Tim Roemer. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER:  Thank you, Mr. 
  
        Chairman.  I'd just ask permission to have my 
  
        entire statement entered into the record so I can be 
  
        a little bit briefer than the whole statement.
 
         </p><p>I am honored to serve with you, Mr. 
  
        Chairman.  You bring such a good bipartisan 
  
        reputation to this Commission.  I am honored to 
  
        serve with the Vice Chair, Mr. Hamilton, with whom I 
  
        served in Congress.  And I'm honored to be
 
        here with the families that could have stepped away 
  
        in their grief and their sorrow and instead 
  
        participated in a process that helped bring us here  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        today with the Commission. 
  
         </p><p>We are here today because we love 
  
        democracy.  And in democracy, sometimes it is not 
  
        easy to get at the facts, to ask the tough
 
        questions, to make people feel uncomfortable, to 
  
        move paradigms and models from old ways into new 
  
        ways, to take on the threat of al Qaeda, who wants 
  
        to kill hundreds if not thousands of people and do 
  
        it anyplace in the world, including in the United
 
        States of America. 
  
         </p><p>We are here to get at the facts.  And 
  
        getting at the facts won't kill us, but not getting 
  
        at those facts might.  We need to make sure that we 
  
        follow the clues and the evidence wherever they will
 
        lead. 
  
         </p><p>Walter Lippman, a gifted and prolific 
  
        writer, reminded us that "A central function of 
  
        democracy is to allow a free people to drag 
  
        realities out into the sunlight and demand a full
 
        accounting from those who were permitted to hold 
  
        power." 
  
         </p><p>As our Declaration of Independence  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        proclaims, those holding power, "Deriving their 
  
        powers from the consent of the governed" should be 
  
        accountable to their citizens.  That's what we are 
  
        going to do on this Commission.
 
         </p><p>New York City is the appropriate place to 
  
        begin this great task.  Even before September 11th, 
  
        at 12:18, on February 26, 1993, a bomb exploded in 
  
        the World Trade Center, killing six people, 
  
        injuring 1,000 people, and causing $510 million in
 
        damage.  On June 24, 1993, the FBI arrested eight 
  
        individuals for plotting to bomb a number of New 
  
        York City landmarks. 
  
         </p><p>Why did it take our bureaucracies, our 
  
        intelligence community and our politicians so long
 
        to react to targets and clues and evidence that had 
  
        been building and building and building over time? 
  
         </p><p>A distinguished historian, Roberta 
  
        Wohlstetter, wrote a superb book on Pearl Harbor. 
  
        And the forward by Thomas Schelling is even more
 
        superb, and I quote, "It would be reassuring to 
  
        believe that Pearl Harbor was just a colossal and 
  
        extraordinary blunder.  In fact, blunder is too  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        specific.  It was just a dramatic failure of a 
  
        remarkably well-informed government to call the 
  
        next enemy move in a Cold War crisis." 
  
         </p><p>Today it might be some of the same words,
 
        a "well-intentioned but well-informed government to 
  
        call the next enemy move."  It was not a Cold War 
  
        crisis and it wasn't the Japanese, but it was al 
  
        Qaeda and it was an enemy that had declared war on 
  
        the United States in 1998.
 
         </p><p>We need our agencies, our bureaucracies, 
  
        our people to react with a sense of urgency, the 
  
        urgency that we have in the war right now in the 
  
        Middle East.  We should have had this sense of 
  
        urgency years ago.
 
         </p><p>When I have criticisms that maybe our 
  
        Commission got off to a slow start, when I have 
  
        criticisms of the White House, even reluctantly, in 
  
        finally coming forward with some of the funding, $9 
  
        million instead of $11 million, through a new
 
        account instead of through a supplemental 
  
        appropriation that should have gone through the 
  
        United States Congress, it is not a personal  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        criticism, it is not even a political criticism. 
  
        It is because of the urgency that I feel that al 
  
        Qaeda is coming after us again and again, and soon. 
  
         </p><p>It is the sense of urgency that the
 
        country should feel, not only because of 9/11, but 
  
        because of the impending and direct threat of 
  
        terrorists that have changed their modus operandi 
  
        from we "will cause damage and terror but not kill 
  
        lots of people" to "we will terrify people and kill
 
        thousands of them to get their attention." 
  
         </p><p>Let me conclude by saying, we should have 
  
        three objectives: a full accountability in sunlight 
  
        that this Commission asks the tough questions of 
  
        our government, asks the tough questions.
 
         </p><p>In an unclassified finding of the Joint 
  
        Inquiry that I served on, we asked, were other 
  
        governments involved in funding the terrorists.  We 
  
        need to get to the bottom of those questions. 
  
         </p><p>Secondly, the sense of urgency in this
 
        bond of the American people that we need to 
  
        establish.  Many commissions have made countless 
  
        recommendations that sit on dusty shelves, going  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        nowhere. 
  
         </p><p>These recommendations, with this sense of 
  
        urgency and bond with the American people, need to 
  
        find their way to the President's desk and be
 
        signed into law so that we make this country a 
  
        safer place and that they are not ignored at the end 
  
        of the day. 
  
         </p><p>We bury today not just someone from Hell's 
  
        Kitchen or someone New Yorkers are proud of but
 
        somebody that all America is proud of and somebody 
  
        I served with in the United States Congress, former 
  
        Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.  He gives us all 
  
        the sense of urgency that we should have in our 
  
        great work ahead.
 
         </p><p>He said in a Harvard commencement ceremony 
  
        last year, and I quote, "The terrorist attacks on 
  
        the United States of last September 11th were not 
  
        nuclear, but they will be." 
  
         </p><p>That is the sense of threat, of urgency,
 
        of love for democracy and accountability of our 
  
        government that I hope this Commission will bring 
  
        forward in a non-partisan, bipartisan way and get  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        to the bottom of why this happened and how we make 
  
        the country a safer place for every single American 
  
        in this great country that we love so much.  Thank 
  
        you.
 
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Commissioner Jim Thompson. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER THOMPSON:  Mr. Chairman, 
  
        thank you.  I too am honored to serve as a member 
  
        of this Commission and to serve with extraordinary 
  
        people who have each in their own way contributed
 
        much to this nation. 
  
         </p><p>I have always believed, as Commissioner 
  
        Gorelick has already noted, that the first 
  
        obligation of government, all governments, is to 
  
        protect the lives and property of its citizens.
 
         </p><p>Here is the American bargain.  Each of us, 
  
        as individual citizens, take a portion of our 
  
        liberties and our lives and pass them to those whom 
  
        we elect or appoint as our guardians.  And their 
  
        task is to hold our liberties and our lives in
 
        their hands, secure.  That is an appropriate 
  
        bargain. 
  
         </p><p>But on September 11th, that bargain was  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        not kept.  Our government, all governments, somehow 
  
        failed in their duty that day.  We need to know 
  
        why.  No one who was not there nor bound by family 
  
        or emotional ties to the victims can completely
 
        understand the horror and still present shock of 
  
        that day.  It is incomprehensible.  But as 
  
        Americans, we are all victims of September 11th and 
  
        the whole nation must be satisfied when we finish 
  
        our work.
 
         </p><p>I remember watching the television news as 
  
        I prepared to go to work that morning and saw the 
  
        first plane crash into the World Trade Tower.  And 
  
        my assumption was that this was a grievous, 
  
        horrible accident.  By the time I reached the
 
        street and learned of the second plane crashing 
  
        into the second tower, the whole world knew it was 
  
        no accident. 
  
         </p><p>A number of young people worked with me at 
  
        our law firm.  And by midmorning, when we made our
 
        decision to close our offices and send our people 
  
        home, they asked if they could go home with me. 
  
        Nobody wanted to be alone on September 11th.  One  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        young man and his wife and baby came to my house 
  
        because I live on the seventh floor.  They live in 
  
        another building on the 12th floor.  They felt 
  
        safer with me, closer to the ground.
 
         </p><p>Several months later, when I was in New 
  
        York, I stopped at Ground Zero, got out of my car, 
  
        ran to the fence before the policeman could shoo me 
  
        away, peered through the barricade and looked at 
  
        that vast empty space.  Space had replaced people
 
        and instruments of commerce.  Others will fill that 
  
        space one day with buildings and memorials and 
  
        human life will flourish again there. 
  
         </p><p>Our task is, to borrow a phrase, without 
  
        fear or favor to fill that space with the facts,
 
        with the truth, and with answered questions.  Thank 
  
        you, Mr. Chairman. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Commissioner Max Cleland. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER CLELAND:  Thank you very 
  
        much, Mr. Chairman.
 
         </p><p>I am deeply moved by the emotion and the 
  
        dedication and the commitment of these fine 
  
        Americans on this panel and the wonderful Americans  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        in the audience toward finding out what happened, 
  
        why and making sure it never happens again.  So I'm 
  
        honored to be among these wonderful people today. 
  
         </p><p>Let me just say that 18 months ago, this
 
        city and our country suffered an attack like none 
  
        we had ever experienced before.  On that day we 
  
        lost more than the thousands of innocent men and 
  
        women and children who perished or were grievously 
  
        injured.  We lost more than the two great towers
 
        that fell, we lost our sense of safety and 
  
        invulnerability. 
  
         </p><p>Almost without question, we could and 
  
        should have been better prepared, we know that, to 
  
        protect our homeland against the terrorist assault.
 
        As in the final report of the Joint Congressional 
  
        Intelligence Committee Inquiry into the 9/11 
  
        attacks found, "Prior to September the 11th, the 
  
        intelligence community was neither well organized 
  
        nor equipped and did not adequately adapt to meet
 
        the challenge posed by global terrorists focused on 
  
        targets within the domestic United States.  These 
  
        problems greatly exacerbated the nation's  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        vulnerability to an increasingly dangerous and 
  
        immediate international terrorist threat inside the 
  
        United States." 
  
         </p><p>Because of this I believe the work of this
 
        Commission will not only affirm those intelligence 
  
        deficiencies but will find corresponding lapses in 
  
        border control, aviation security, and a host of 
  
        other fields. 
  
         </p><p>As a member of the 107th Congress of the
 
        Senate Committee on Armed Services and Commerce and 
  
        Governmental Affairs, I participated in literally 
  
        dozens of hearings which thoroughly delved within 
  
        our unpreparedness for the terrorist threat.  And I 
  
        was pleased in some small way to play a role in the
 
        development of the Department of Aviation and 
  
        Transportation Security Act of 2001, Maritime 
  
        Transportation and Security Act of 2001, and the 
  
        Homeland Security Act of 2002. 
  
         </p><p>But I believe that this investigation will
 
        show that, as true of executive agencies, the Congress 
  
        should have been and could have been better 
  
        prepared and done better.  It's not hard to see  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        parallels between September 11th, 2001 and 
  
        December 7, 1941.  I am particularly sensitive to 
  
        such comparisons because my father was stationed in 
  
        Pearl Harbor after the attack.  That attack had a
 
        profound effect on this country and on my family 
  
        personally. 
  
         </p><p>As a CIA-funded study of the agency's 
  
        history reported, the intelligence community we had 
  
        in place in 2001 was in many respects a product of
 
        the 1941 debacle, after which our national leaders 
  
        had concluded "that the surprise attack could have 
  
        been blunted if the various commanders and 
  
        departments had coordinated their actions and 
  
        shared their intelligence."
 
         </p><p>And boy, does that have a familiar ring. 
  
        That was right after 1941.  These sobering 
  
        assessments led to the adoption of the National 
  
        Security Act of 1947 which "attempted to implement 
  
        the principles of unity of command and unity of
 
        intelligence." 
  
         </p><p>In many ways that is what now, over 50 
  
        years later, we have been trying to do in the wake  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        of the 2001 disaster. But there are some important 
  
        differences between Pearl Harbor and 9/11 which 
  
        also must be kept in mind as this Commission and 
  
        the country chart our course on where we go from
 
        here.  As shattering a blow as December 7, 
  
        1941, it was a military strike, aimed at military 
  
        targets, ordered by the Imperial Government of 
  
        Japan and coming at the end of a long period of 
  
        tensions between the two governments.
 
         </p><p>September the 11th, 2001 was a terrorist 
  
        strike, aimed primarily at civilian targets, in 
  
        which the perpetrators were not acting for a nation 
  
        but for a terrorist network.  It's true that previous 
  
        attacks, as has been stated, by al Qaeda, including
 
        the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, the 
  
        thwarted 1995 Bojinka plot in the Philippines, the 
  
        1990 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and 
  
        the 2000 attack on the USS Cole should have 
  
        produced, and amongst some governmental officials
 
        did produce, a heightened sense of urgency and 
  
        attention to the new terrorist threat. 
  
         </p><p>But these attacks were all either far away  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        or of limited success or both.  They were not 
  
        enough to shake us out of our collective sense of 
  
        invulnerability which was borne of the security 
  
        long provided us by two great oceans and friendly
 
        neighbors for almost 200 years, since the war of 
  
        1812, without significant hostile foreign assaults 
  
        on the continental United States, and by our more 
  
        recent victory in the Cold War which eliminated the 
  
        Soviet threat.
 
         </p><p>Thus, the pre-9/11 attacks by al Qaeda 
  
        were not sufficient to make intelligence 
  
        bureaucracy shed their turf-consciousness and 
  
        their Cold War mentalities or our border-control 
  
        agencies to overcome inertia and budget shortfalls
 
        or the airlines and airports to tighten security, 
  
        even if it meant some added inconvenience to the 
  
        traveling public or the executive or legislative 
  
        branches to prioritize homeland security above other 
  
        spending programs.
 
         </p><p>None of these things happened before 9/11.
  
        But all of them have occurred to at least some 
  
        degree since then.  It could and no doubt should  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        have been different. If it had been different, 
  
        some or all those who perished on that day would 
  
        still be with us.  Now at the very least, we do 
  
        want to, for those victims and their families, make
 
        sure we're never again so ill prepared to defend 
  
        our homeland. 
  
         </p><p>But I say that those families and the 
  
        sacrifices of their loved ones, that they have not 
  
        have died in vain.  The victims themselves have
 
        galvanized the public, the private sector and the 
  
        government into action in a way which unfortunately 
  
        would not likely have occurred otherwise. 
  
         </p><p>And the surviving families members, many 
  
        of them who are with us today, through your
 
        dedication, your persistence, and your untiring 
  
        efforts, more than any other force, are responsible 
  
        for this Commission, and thus have given us the 
  
        grave responsibility and opportunity to help 
  
        produce a more secure country for all of us as
 
        Americans. 
  
         </p><p>However, if a false sense of 
  
        invulnerability and security was our downfall on  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        September the 11th, in many ways the current 
  
        danger, in my opinion that we will succumb to 
  
        what FDR called "fear itself." Continuing the 
  
        quote, "nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror,
 
        which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat 
  
        into advance." 
  
         </p><p>That was from 1933.  President Roosevelt 
  
        was speaking, of course, of the fear of economic 
  
        insecurity wrought by the great global depression
 
        of the '30s, but I believe his words still ring 
  
        true these 70 years later as we confront "nameless, 
  
        unreasoning, unjustified fear," of the global 
  
        terrorism of the 21st century. 
  
         </p><p>We must never again lapse into complacency
 
        about homeland security when the march of 
  
        technology has made physical boundaries and 
  
        international borders more and more surmountable 
  
        and has expanded the destructive power of weapons 
  
        to the point that small groups, or even
 
        individuals, can now inflict a degree of death and 
  
        destruction heretofore reserved to great armies. 
  
         </p><p>But if we are to prevail in this struggle,  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        we must not give in to the terror of terrorism 
  
        which is, after all, at once both the major weapon 
  
        and the chief objective of al Qaeda and its allies. 
  
         </p><p>The war against terrorism bears many
 
        similarities to the Cold War against 
  
        communism, a war in which President Kennedy called 
  
        on our country to "bear the burden of a long 
  
        twilight struggle, year in and year out, rejoicing 
  
        in hope, patient in tribulation, in our struggle
 
        against the common enemies of man, tyranny, 
  
        disease and war itself." 
  
         </p><p>That is our challenge.  We walk in that 
  
        great challenge in the last half of the 20th 
  
        century with firmness and strength but also with
 
        the patience and hope that JFK spoke of.  We need a 
  
        similar combination to vanquish the new enemy. 
  
         </p><p>In my judgment, that is the task to which 
  
        this Commission must dedicate itself, to assist the 
  
        country in being neither complacent nor fearful in
 
        maintaining a sense of safety but not false 
  
        invulnerability. 
  
         </p><p>In closing, I'd just like to say a word of  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        prayer and thanks to the great men and women of the 
  
        Armed Forces of our country who, even as we meet 
  
        here today, stand in harm's way, far from home. 
  
        God be with them and bless them and their families.
 
        Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much, 
  
        Commissioner.  I'd now like to introduce and 
  
        welcome Mayor Michael Bloomberg of the City of New 
  
        York.
 
         </p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:  How about jobs and not 
  
        rhetoric?  How about saving human rights in this 
  
        country? 
  
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Governor, want me to 
  
        start?
 
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Yes, please.  I introduced 
  
        you before.  I will welcome you. 
  
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Thank you very much.  If 
  
        I need the introduction, I'm in big trouble here in 
  
        this city.
 
         </p><p>Governor, members of the Commission, 
  
        welcome to New York City.  We hope you spend a lot 
  
        of money and generate some sales-tax revenues while  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        you're here.  We could use you. 
  
         </p><p>Your Commission has a broad mandate, that 
  
        is, to look at the reasons why 9/11 happened, to 
  
        consider the steps the federal government should
 
        take to make sure attacks like that don't occur 
  
        again and to propose measures that would be taken 
  
        now to prepare us to respond to future terrorist 
  
        incidents. 
  
         </p><p>Much of your work will focus on such
 
        important questions as how did terrorists get into 
  
        this country, what should we do to make our borders 
  
        safe, how were the terrorists allowed to learn to 
  
        fly airplanes in our own country, how on earth 
  
        could they get by airport security with the
 
        obviously unenforced and ineffective federal 
  
        regulations, and how can we stop other acts of 
  
        terrorism in the future.  These are the issues for 
  
        your Commission. 
  
         </p><p>I want to focus on different but also
 
        important issues.  I will describe our city 
  
        government's reaction to the attacks to the World 
  
        Trade Center, including our emergency response that  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        day, our recovery effort in the days and months 
  
        immediately afterward, and what we have done since 
  
        in the areas of counterterrorism and preparedness. 
  
         </p><p>Simply put, the terrorist attack on 9/11
 
        was one of the darkest days in New York's history. 
  
        It took the lives of 2,700-plus of our loved ones, 
  
        friends and colleagues, including more than 360 
  
        valiant city firefighters, police officers and 
  
        emergency workers.
 
         </p><p>It revealed our vulnerability to murderous 
  
        plots formulated half a world away.  It shattered 
  
        forever any illusions that our vast ocean 
  
        boundaries can protect us. But out of the 
  
        devastation came one of our finest hours, defined
 
        by the heroism of those who rushed into the 
  
        buildings to save others, the selflessness of New 
  
        Yorkers who supported the recovery through acts as 
  
        simple as lining up on West Street to say thank you 
  
        to our emergency workers and the resilience of New
 
        Yorkers who refused to stop living their lives in 
  
        the difficult days, weeks and months that followed 
  
        the attack.  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
         </p><p>New York City has learned, and continues 
  
        to learn, the lessons of 9/11.  Today I want to 
  
        underscore the need for an effective and ongoing 
  
        counterterrorism partnership with the federal
 
        government. 
  
         </p><p>Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and Fire 
  
        Commissioner Nick Scoppetta are with me today. 
  
        They will make statements following my testimony, 
  
        if you so desire, and are prepared to answer your
 
        questions. 
  
         </p><p>As you know, I was not the mayor on 9/11. 
  
        Our administration took office the following 
  
        January. But the efforts of 9/11 have been a major 
  
        focus of our administration over the last 15
 
        months.  We have examined the city's response to 
  
        9/11 thoroughly, and I can tell you that it was 
  
        swift, massive, heroic and extraordinarily 
  
        effective. 
  
         </p><p>Within 10 minutes of the first attack at
 
        8:46 a.m., 50 percent of the Police Department's 
  
        Special Operation Units were deployed and were 
  
        either at or on their way to the World Trade  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        Center.  By 9:00 a.m., before the second plane even 
  
        hit, both the Fire Department and our Emergency 
  
        Medical Service had command posts on the scene 
  
        directing rescue operations.  By 9:10 a.m., less
 
        than half an hour after the first tower was struck, 
  
        100 percent of the Fire Department's rescue and 
  
        high-rise units had been ordered into action. 
  
         </p><p>Police officers immediately secured the 
  
        perimeter around the World Trade Center and police
 
        emergency-service units entered the towers to 
  
        assist in evacuations.  Department of Health 
  
        officials started considering public-health effects 
  
        and began contacting area hospitals to establish 
  
        procedures for accepting the heavy influx of
 
        injured people that was anticipated. 
  
         </p><p>Sadly, those numbers did not materialize. 
  
        I say sadly because instead of the influx of 
  
        injured New Yorkers, we experienced massive 
  
        fatalities.
 
         </p><p>The professionalism of our rescue efforts 
  
        and the bravery of those who carried them out is 
  
        encapsulated in one statistic, some 25,000 people  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        were safely evacuated from the World Trade Center 
  
        that morning, the most successful urban emergency 
  
        evacuation in modern history. 
  
         </p><p>After the towers collapsed, the city's
 
        response was just as exemplary.  Department of 
  
        Sanitation officials at the recently closed Fresh 
  
        Kills Landfill in Staten Island, knowing they had 
  
        heavy lifting and hauling equipment at hand, 
  
        immediately made plans to send that equipment into
 
        Manhattan. 
  
         </p><p>The offices of the city's Department of 
  
        Design and Construction, or DDC, acted with equal 
  
        dispatch, obtaining equipment from some of the 
  
        city's major construction firms.  Despite the fact
 
        that its command center was destroyed in the 
  
        attack, the city's Office of Emergency Management, 
  
        OEM, established a temporary command post.  By the 
  
        evening of September 11th, lights lit up the entire 
  
        site while the search for survivors went on.
 
         </p><p>Firefighters worked day and night to 
  
        extinguish fires that burned beneath the rubble for 
  
        months.  The Department of Design and Construction,  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        along with the Fire Department and the Office of 
  
        Emergency Management, spearheaded interagency 
  
        coordination among city agencies and with federal 
  
        and state agencies and private organizations.
 
         </p><p>In the first five days alone, almost 3,000 
  
        truckloads of debris were removed.  Over the next 
  
        seven months, an average of more than 7,000 tons of 
  
        debris, per day, was taken from the site.  Barging 
  
        operations were established at Hudson River Piers
 
        25 and 26 to transport debris from Manhattan to the 
  
        Fresh Kills Landfill, which was reopened to 
  
        accommodate the enormous tonnage of material. 
  
         </p><p>The recovery proceeded in a manner that 
  
        made the search for human remains the highest
 
        priority.  Work came to a halt any time it appeared 
  
        such a discovery might be made.  To date, the 
  
        remains of 1,481 victims of that attack have been 
  
        identified by the Office of the Chief Medical 
  
        Examiner, an office that has led the nation in its
 
        use of state-of-the-art DNA identification 
  
        technology. 
  
         </p><p>The clearing of the site, which was  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        initially expected to take years, instead took 
  
        eight months.  The work was not only accomplished 
  
        much faster than expected but done under budget, 
  
        without a single loss of life, with an injury rate
 
        far less than at an ordinary construction site, 
  
        despite the unprecedented conditions in which the 
  
        work was done. 
  
         </p><p>Would you like me to wait while we finish? 
  
        I'd be happy to wait until we catch up, soon as we
 
        finish briefing, then we can continue.  It's quite 
  
        all right.  I have plenty of time, so I'd be happy 
  
        to do it. 
  
         </p><p>In retrospect, there is little this city 
  
        could have done on 9/11 to avoid the tremendous
 
        loss of life that occurred so quickly after the 
  
        attacks.  The failure of airport security doomed 
  
        the 2,700 poor souls who are no longer with us. 
  
        However, since then we have taken it upon ourselves 
  
        to learn everything possible from this tragedy.
 
         </p><p>Shortly after 9/11, the consulting firm of 
  
        McKinsey &amp; Company agreed to study, on a pro bono 
  
        basis, the response of the Police and Fire  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        Departments to the attack on the World Trade Center 
  
        and to make recommendations for the future. 
  
         </p><p>These extremely valuable consultant 
  
        studies, which are available on the Web,
 
        complemented studies already underway in both these 
  
        departments.  And many of the consultants' 
  
        recommendations were already in effect or were 
  
        being implemented when the final reports were 
  
        issued.
 
         </p><p>For example, at the NYPD, one of 
  
        Commissioner Kelly's first acts was to establish a 
  
        Counterterrorism Bureau and expand the department's 
  
        Intelligence Division.  Protective and other 
  
        equipment issued to officers responding to possible
 
        terrorist incidents also was upgraded. 
  
         </p><p>McKinsey &amp; Company also recommended that 
  
        the NYPD create a comprehensive disaster-response 
  
        plan with the means to effectuate it, measures that 
  
        have already be carried out.  The McKinsey report
 
        concerning the FDNY was eloquent in its praise for 
  
        the heroism and sacrifice of our firefighters. 
  
         </p><p>It also focused on four principal areas;  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        operational preparedness, planning and management, 
  
        communications technology and the provision of 
  
        counseling and support services to members of the 
  
        department and their families.
 
         </p><p>Since its release, the Fire Department 
  
        also has appointed a Terrorist Advisory Task Force, 
  
        headed by former CIA director, James Woolsey. 
  
         </p><p>Perhaps the most encouraging McKinsey
  
        finding was that while the city's massive response
 
        was taking place downtown, the rest of the city 
  
        remained protected with response times to 
  
        emergencies elsewhere in the five boroughs barely 
  
        impacted. 
  
         </p><p>Other key agencies have also responded to
 
        the lessons of 9/11.  The Department of Health has 
  
        enhanced its bioterrorism surveillance, developed a 
  
        Web-based system to communicate with medical 
  
        providers in our city and is building a 
  
        state-of-the-art bioterrorism laboratory.
 
         </p><p>Our Office of Emergency Management has an 
  
        interim headquarters and is in the process of 
  
        building a new permanent home.  It has also  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        coordinated a series of inter-agency preparedness 
  
        exercises which have guided our city's response to 
  
        the increased security needs occasioned by the 
  
        current war in Iraq.
 
         </p><p>New York City, which unfortunately is one 
  
        of, if not the primary potential target of a 
  
        terrorist attack, must be prepared to both prevent 
  
        those attacks and to respond quickly and 
  
        effectively if they occur.  Our administration is
 
        committed to doing just that. 
  
         </p><p>We have developed an extraordinary system 
  
        to guard and protect this city, and every day we're 
  
        making those systems even more effective.  We are 
  
        developing the most sophisticated systems possible,
 
        both to prevent terrorism and respond to it. 
  
         </p><p>Some 10 days ago I met with President Bush 
  
        and the Homeland Security Secretary, Tom Ridge, to 
  
        brief them on the counterterrorism measures the 
  
        city has taken because of the war in Iraq.  Our
 
        operation is known as Operation Atlas.  Secretary 
  
        Ridge later said, "There is no city in this country 
  
        that does a better job of working across the board  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        to prevent terrorism than the City of New York." 
  
         </p><p>After 9/11 President Bush pledged $20 
  
        billion in federal rebuilding assistance to New 
  
        York City and he has been as good as his word.  We
 
        have also benefited from bipartisan support in 
  
        both houses of Congress on this matter, but we now 
  
        need additional help from the federal government to 
  
        meet the high costs of homeland security. 
  
         </p><p>New York City is the nation's financial
 
        capital and its communications nerve center. 
  
        Protection for New York is protection for the 
  
        nation.  And the key to our city's ability to 
  
        respond to any future terrorist attack is funding. 
  
         </p><p>I am sure you're aware of the city's
 
        fiscal plight.  We face a multi-billion-dollar 
  
        budget gap for the fiscal year beginning July 1st. 
  
        Much of that deficit is the result of the increased 
  
        expenses and decreased economic activity created by 
  
        9/11 and its aftermath.
 
         </p><p>I urge the Commission in the most emphatic 
  
        form possible to recommend to Congress that it 
  
        appropriate sufficient monies earmarked to the  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        cities most vulnerable to attack to help us defray 
  
        the extraordinary costs of protecting our citizens 
  
        and the whole country. 
  
         </p><p>Specifically, we have requested additional
 
        funds for counterterrorism training, equipment and 
  
        to cover the costs of our massive security 
  
        operations around the city in the supplemental 
  
        appropriation the administration sent to Congress 
  
        last week.  The Homeland Security Fund should be
 
        allocated on the basis of threat analysis and risk. 
  
        Any other formula, for example by population, 
  
        defies logic and makes a mockery of the country's 
  
        counterterrorism efforts. 
  
         </p><p>New York City has been targeted, let me
 
        remind you, four times by terrorists and the 
  
        federal government cannot ignore our symbolic 
  
        value, recent history and common sense as it works 
  
        to increase homeland security.  To argue that most 
  
        other cities have comparable threats is just
 
        ridiculous. 
  
         </p><p>New York City, to put it into perspective, 
  
        is estimated to receive between 8 and 11 million  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        dollars out of the 560 million dollars from the 
  
        last Homeland Security distribution.  At some point 
  
        politics has to give way to reality.  If we 
  
        distributed monies to the military this way, our
 
        troops in Iraq would have bows and arrows to fight 
  
        with. 
  
         </p><p>I want to close with some comments on 
  
        another problem that deserves your attention and 
  
        that of our policymakers.  It is how to deal with
 
        the massive destruction and personal injuries that 
  
        can result from a terrorist attack. 
  
         </p><p>New York's response to 9/11 was truly 
  
        extraordinary.  Within hours of the collapse of the 
  
        World Trade Center buildings, the city government
 
        and private companies had equipment and personnel 
  
        at Ground Zero to undertake the massive recovery 
  
        and debris-removal operations that were necessary. 
  
        The city and these contractors stayed there until 
  
        the end and did so selflessly and without a thought
 
        to the consequences. 
  
         </p><p>However, in the real world there are 
  
        consequences, and one of those is lawsuits.  The  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        city and the private contracting community are now 
  
        aware of the risks we took on without the benefit 
  
        of federal protection to cover our operations.  It 
  
        took over a year and a special act of Congress for
 
        any significant insurance to become available to 
  
        protect the city and private contractors from such 
  
        lawsuits arising from the cleanup operation. 
  
         </p><p>And the insurance provided is billions of 
  
        dollars less than sought in lawsuits already filed.
 
        Personal-injury claims regarding alleged long-term 
  
        health damage could bankrupt our city over the next 
  
        20 years.  Congress must give us retroactive 
  
        indemnification or the drag on the national economy 
  
        from New York's economic burden will ruin
 
        opportunity throughout all 50 states. 
  
         </p><p>Knowing what we know now, it is imperative 
  
        that a federal indemnification plan be enacted that 
  
        would insure municipalities and private contractors 
  
        so that in the future, when we respond to a
 
        terrorist attack, we will be protected against the 
  
        inevitable lawsuits. 
  
         </p><p>The attacks on 9/11 were attacks on the  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        United States, not just the City of New York.  We 
  
        cannot afford the substantial risk that, in the 
  
        wake of another terrorist attack, a municipality or 
  
        state will feel it has to wait for the Army Corps
 
        of Engineers to do the necessary work or private 
  
        companies will feel they have to refuse to provide 
  
        assistance until and unless a statute is passed 
  
        giving them protection. 
  
         </p><p>Therefore, the Commission should urge
 
        Congress to enact a special indemnification or 
  
        insurance program for governmental entities and 
  
        their contractors who respond to such an attack to 
  
        insure that FEMA can and will fund significant 
  
        intermediate insurance coverage to such governments
 
        and contractors.  Without Congressional action, the 
  
        nation will be unprepared to respond to the 
  
        destruction created by any future terrorist 
  
        attacks. 
  
         </p><p>Despite their extraordinarily busy
 
        schedules and the work they're doing right now to 
  
        meet the heightened security concerns accompanying 
  
        the war in Iraq, Commissioners Kelly and Scoppetta  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        are here to answer any questions you may have. 
  
         </p><p>Before turning over the floor to you and 
  
        to them I want to conclude with this thought: You 
  
        are charged with performing a great service to this
 
        nation and we all want to do what we can to 
  
        remember those who perished on 9/11 and those who 
  
        so selflessly toiled for the days and weeks and 
  
        months thereafter. 
  
         </p><p>We must learn the lessons of that terrible
 
        day and make sure that this city and other cities 
  
        in our nation have the communications systems, the 
  
        well-trained personnel and the federal assistance 
  
        we need to prevent and respond to such attacks in 
  
        the future.  Thank you.
 
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much for 
  
        your comments.  We did not expect Commissioners 
  
        Kelly and Scoppetta -- excuse me? 
  
         </p><p>MR. SCOPPETTA:  Scoppetta. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  -- Scoppetta this morning.
 
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I thought it would be 
  
        easier with all of us here, since one of the keys 
  
        is to make sure that we have all the departments  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        cooperating, so I thought that if we all testified 
  
        together, it would give you a better opportunity to 
  
        understand just how well prepared this city was and 
  
        is.
 
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  We'd be delighted to hear. 
  
        I know we have a panel tomorrow at which 
  
        representatives from your departments are going to 
  
        take part.  We would be delighted at this point to 
  
        hear Commissioner Kelly and Commissioner Scoppetta,
 
        any comments you would like to add to the Mayor's. 
  
         </p><p>MR. SCOPPETTA:  I think we just can answer 
  
        questions, Mr. Chairman. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Commissioner? 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER:  Mr. Chairman, I
 
        apologize, Mayor, I was asking the staff if this 
 
  
        meant that we would not have their expertise and 
  
        their insight and their counsel tomorrow. 
  
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Keep in mind that 
  
        neither were commissioners when the attacks
 
        occurred, or in the first three months.  They're 
  
        really only able to testify to the city's response 
  
        after 9/11's aftermath, starting January 1st, when  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        they took the lessons that we learned and actually 
  
        tried to implement them. 
  
         </p><p>And for the last 15 months, they have been 
  
        working very hard to increase this city's
 
        preparedness to any future attack, but certainly 
  
        more than that, to focus on preventing an attack. 
  
        People talk about first responders, these are our 
  
        first preventers. 
  
         </p><p>And the city is well-served by the NYPD
 
        and the Fire Department, not only to prevent 
  
        possible terrorist attacks, but if you take a look 
  
        at the murder rate and the deaths from fires 
  
        continues to decline and has precipitously in the 
  
        last 15 months, that's their job and they do it
 
        very well. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER:  But Mayor, my 
  
        question was, will they still be available to us 
  
        tomorrow at the 1:30 to 3:00 panel? 
  
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I thought I would make
 
        the head of the Department of Design and 
  
        Construction, Ken Holden, available.  He's the only 
  
        one in the administration that was running an  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        agency then and was onsite, and he can add a lot. 
  
        I think if there were specific questions, 
  
        unfortunately, both of these guys have an awful lot 
  
        to do, so I thought if we all came, we could avoid
 
        wasting their time. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Congressman Gorelick? 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  Let me say this. 
  
        Ray Kelly is probably the best-suited person in 
  
        this country to talk to us about the coordination
 
        that is taking place in real time between our 
  
        localities and the various agencies of the federal 
  
        government. 
  
         </p><p>I had the privilege of working with Ray 
  
        when he was in the federal government in various
 
        capacities, and I know that he's deeply involved 
  
        with our federal agencies.  I would find it 
  
        enormously helpful if we could have a session with 
  
        you at some later point to talk in detail about how 
  
        it is working for you in the city.
 
         </p><p>I would love to hear a general statement 
  
        now, but to Commissioner Roemer's point, I think we 
  
        could learn a great deal from you, if you would  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        make yourself available to us, I know you're 
  
        incredibly busy, but if you could make yourself 
  
        available to us, give us a sense of how the various 
  
        elements of the federal government are relating to
 
        each other and to you. 
  
         </p><p>MR. KELLY:  Sure, we can do that in the 
  
        future. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  But if you could 
  
        characterize it now, I think it would be helpful
 
        just to get us started and locate it, if you would. 
  
         </p><p>MR. KELLY:  I think there's no question 
  
        that state and local and federal agencies are 
  
        working more closely now than ever before.  We have 
  
        an excellent working relationship, that is the NYPD
 
        does with both the FBI and the CIA, and also the state's 
  
        Office of Public Security that is involved.  We're 
  
        much closer now than ever before.  We have a 
  
        free flow of information. 
  
         </p><p>I don't think there's any question in my
 
        mind that we're not getting information certainly 
  
        relevant to New York City on an immediate basis. 
  
        Internally in the city, I think we're working much  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        closer.  Commissioner Scoppetta and I and the staff 
  
        of the Fire and Police Department work closely 
  
        together. 
  
         </p><p>We now have executives assigned to each
 
        other's headquarters.  We make available our 
  
        helicopter assets to fire chiefs to survey the 
  
        scene of major events or major fires.  We are now 
  
        able to communicate on a city-wide basis, an 
  
        interagency-communication net that exists.  I think
 
        it certainly needs further development. 
  
        Commissioner Scoppetta can give you more specific 
  
        information about their communications systems. 
  
         </p><p>So just, you know, in a nutshell, there's 
  
        much more communication, much more coordination
 
        than there has ever been before.  Are there 
  
        occasional hiccups?  Yeah, but nothing really of 
  
        significance.  So I don't know how I can say it 
  
        more directly. 
  
         </p><p>We're getting the information that we
 
        think we need.  We, for instance, have increased 
  
        our Joint Terrorism Task Force component.  On 
  
        September 11, 2001, there were 17 investigators  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        from the NYPD, on the Joint Terrorism Task Force, 
  
        there are now over a hundred and they are working with 
  
        the FBI literally throughout the world. 
  
         </p><p>The CIA has been very forthcoming with
 
        information, as well.  We have brought onboard 
  
        General Frank Libutti, retired, a Marine Corps 
  
        Lieutenant General, to head our Counterterrorism 
  
        Bureau, and in that bureau is our Joint Terrorist 
  
        Task Force component.
 
         </p><p>We have also brought onboard David Cohen, 
  
        former Deputy Director and Director of Operations 
  
        for the CIA.  Commissioner Cohen is in charge of 
  
        the Intelligence Division.  He has really done a 
  
        remarkable job pulling that together.  We have our
 
        own Arabic speakers, Urdu, Pashtu, Hindi speakers 
  
        that we've brought together, and again, in that 
  
        construct, we work closely with the federal 
  
        government, as well. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  As we proceed, I
 
        think it would be enormously helpful if we could 
  
        sit down with you and your team as we -- 
  
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I thought tomorrow we'd  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        deliver a statement from both the Police 
  
        Commissioner and the Fire Commissioner, a written 
  
        statement, so that you can start going in that 
  
        direction.  And as you get more information and
 
        formulate specific questions, we'd be happy to 
  
        answer questions. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  Thank you, Mayor. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Commissioner Hamilton? 
  
         </p><p>VICE CHAIRMAN HAMILTON:  Mayor, I am very
 
        grateful to you and your colleagues for coming this 
  
        morning.  And what especially I appreciated about 
  
        your statement was the specific recommendations you 
  
        made. 
  
         </p><p>Our task as a Commission, at the end of
 
        the day, will be to make recommendations to 
  
        policymakers to prevent such attacks occurring 
  
        again.  And while you're here -- and I hope without 
  
        taking advantage of you -- I would like to get from 
  
        you what several recommendations you think are most
 
        important for this Commission to make with regard 
  
        to the prevention of future attacks. 
  
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Well, funding for the  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        people on the ground is perhaps the most important 
  
        thing that Congress could do.  In the end, it is 
  
        the cop on the beat, it is the firefighter in the 
  
        truck that does the work.
 
         </p><p>We can talk about policies, we can fund 
  
        studies, but you need to get those people that do 
  
        the work to be well trained, to have the equipment 
  
        they need and to be fairly compensated.  And you 
  
        will only do that if you direct the monies to where
 
        the need is. 
  
         </p><p>It is laughable, and tragically laughable, 
  
        to think that a tiny city in another state is under 
  
        the same kind of threat that New York City is or 
  
        that if an attack were -- let us pray not -- but if
 
        an attack were to take place that it would have the 
  
        same kind of effect on the entire country. 
  
         </p><p>VICE CHAIRMAN HAMILTON:  My point was 
  
        prevention, your point is protection.  Your point 
  
        is very, very important and very valuable.  And I
 
        think your experience in New York City can teach us 
  
        an awful lot about how we respond to terrorism and 
  
        how we can protect against terrorism, but is there  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        anything that comes out of the New York City 
  
        experience that can guide us with regard to the 
  
        prevention of terrorism? 
  
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  We have a thousand of
 
        our police officers on intelligence.  The New York 
  
        City Police Department has its own police officers 
  
        in major cities around the world so that we get 
  
        intelligence.  What you see under Operation Atlas, a 
  
        group of heavily armed men and women in police
 
        uniforms all of a sudden show up and then go 
  
        someplace else totally unexpected, that is a 
  
        preventive thing. 
  
         </p><p>VICE CHAIRMAN HAMILTON:  Are you 
  
        comfortable with the amount of intelligence you get
 
        from the federal government?  Is there good 
  
        coordination with our intelligence agencies at the 
  
        federal level and your intelligence agencies? 
  
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  As the Commissioner 
  
        said, that in terms of information that references
 
        New York, Commissioner Kelly is comfortable that we 
  
        get it virtually instantly.  The problem with 
  
        intelligence is there's so much and it tends to be  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        so unspecific that there isn't a direct answer to 
  
        your question. 
  
         </p><p>Only in retrospect can you look back and 
  
        say whether or not you had too few assets deployed.
 
        We will never know whether we had too many, but we 
  
        have an obligation to prevent, to protect, and if 
  
        need be respond to the public, not just terrorism 
  
        from terrorists, terrorism from criminals. 
  
         </p><p>There's lots of different things that all
 
        of our security agencies, law-enforcement agencies, 
  
        Fire Department, medical people, have to 
  
        respond to every day.  Not everything is caused by 
  
        terrorists. 
  
         </p><p>I think we're going in the right
 
        direction.  We have a commitment to provide the 
  
        level of security that we believe is adequate.  It 
  
        is not as much as we would like.  I'd love to have 
  
        a firehouse on every corner.  We can't afford that. 
  
        I'd love to have a police officer stationed in the
 
        lobby of every building.  We can't afford that.  We 
  
        have to deal with the economic realities of the 
  
        world.  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
         </p><p>Having said that, we will provide the 
  
        level that our senior management in police and fire 
  
        think is appropriate to make this city safe.  And 
  
        the consequences of doing that are that we will
 
        have to, unfortunately, not do many of the other 
  
        things that the people of this city and this 
  
        country need, due to the limited resources. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Commissioner Ben-Veniste? 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE:  Mayor
 
        Bloomberg, I thank you for your pledge of full 
  
        cooperation, and we will certainly take you up on 
  
        it.  I would like to congratulate you on your 
  
        selection of my old friend and colleague, Nick 
  
        Scoppetta, to be Fire Commissioner.  And I see Ray
 
        Kelly, who I have had the privilege of meeting with 
  
        in the past. 
  
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Let me also point out 
  
        that we have our Corporation Counsel here, so out 
  
        of the four of us up here, three are lawyers.
 
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE:  Not a bad 
  
        thing. 
  
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  It depends.  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE:  Let me ask Nick 
  
        Scoppetta this question, and one we will continue 
  
        to think about, and that is the relationship of the 
  
        federal and state and local systems working
 
        together. 
  
         </p><p>Traditionally, there has been a criticism 
  
        that federal agencies and particularly our domestic 
  
        law-enforcement agencies, the FBI, has treated state 
  
        and local authorities in a manner involving a
 
        one-way street of information.  Many criticisms 
  
        have been laid to that situation. 
  
         </p><p>And let me ask both Commissioner Scoppetta 
  
        and Commissioner Kelly whether, in the post-9/11 
  
        environment, you see any improvement in the flow of
 
        information from the federal government to the 
  
        state and city authorities. 
  
         </p><p>MR. SCOPPETTA:  I think Commissioner Kelly 
  
        is in a better position to address that question. 
  
        And I'd like to start by saying that we rely
 
        heavily on the Police Department, and I in 
  
        particular rely heavily on my contacts with 
  
        Commissioner Kelly, which are frequent and  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        continuous.  And there has been more than one 
  
        occasion when he has called me directly to discuss 
  
        a piece of intelligence that we then jointly acted 
  
        on.
 
         </p><p>I will say that I think I have never seen 
  
        better cooperation and coordination between the 
  
        various city agencies that might be called upon to 
  
        first responders and, in particular, fire and 
  
        police.  We have done four joint exercises
 
        together. 
  
         </p><p>We have, as Commissioner Kelly mentioned, 
  
        executive liaisons at each other's headquarters 
  
        that report there every day.  We have a high-level 
  
        working committee, our chief of the department, our
 
        chief of operations and their counterparts in the 
  
        Police Department meet on a regular basis. 
  
         </p><p>And so there is a lot of coordination and 
  
        cooperation and joint planning with police and 
  
        fire, which is the thing that concerns me
 
        primarily.  And the relationship with the FBI and 
  
        the other law-enforcement and intelligence 
  
        communities on the federal level is one that Ray  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        Kelly has I think a very good relationship with. 
  
        And we rely heavily on police intelligence. 
  
         </p><p>MR. KELLY:  I have been in law enforcement 
  
        a long time, both on the federal and the local
 
        level.  And clearly there were some issues in the 
  
        past with the flow of information. 
  
         </p><p>I can tell you that has changed 
  
        significantly in the aftermath of September 11th. 
  
        I think the Patriot Act also has changed it.  So
 
        there were some restrictions placed on the federal 
  
        agencies restricting them from talking to other 
  
        agencies, and indeed talking to local agencies.  That 
  
        has changed. 
  
         </p><p>There is a palpable difference in their
 
        approach to doing business.  They want to get that 
  
        information out.  They are getting it out.  Again, 
  
        we're commingled, you might say, on the Joint 
  
        Terrorism Task Force level, as never before, with a 
  
        number of investigators that we have assigned over
 
        there. 
  
         </p><p>So in terms of the flow of information, it 
  
        is much, much different, much better than it was  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        prior to September 11th. 
  
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  But let me also add that 
  
        it is not just police and fire with this kind of 
  
        terrorism that you saw on 9/11.  Our Office of
 
        Emergency Management, our Department of Health and 
  
        Mental Hygiene, our Medical Examiner's Office, our 
  
        Department of Environmental Protection, all of 
  
        those agencies meet virtually every day, have 
  
        contacts, either in person or over the phone.
 
         </p><p>The threat to this country and the threat 
  
        to this city of an attack on our water supply or a 
  
        bioterrorism threat or a chemical threat, those are 
  
        the kinds of agencies that would have to recognize 
  
        threats, occurrences, when they take place, which
 
        is not easy to do. 
  
         </p><p>You don't just wake up and say, oh, we 
  
        have a bioterrorism threat or an attack.  It's over 
  
        a period of time that you build information to say, 
  
        hey, we must have been attacked days ago.  That's
 
        the way bioterrorism works. And it is having scientists, researchers, 
  
        personnel on the ground that look and have their  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        eyes and ears open and exercise common sense and 
  
        have the interdisciplinary as well as interagency 
  
        coordination.  I just cannot tell you the amount of 
  
        research that is done every day to make sure the
 
        city stays safe.  And it's not just looking for the 
  
        kinds of acts that are obvious once they take 
  
        place. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE:  Let me follow 
  
        up in one way.  And I'm gratified to hear
 
        Commissioner Kelly's statement with respect to 
  
        cooperation from the FBI and other 
  
        intelligence-gathering agencies of the federal 
  
        government. 
  
         </p><p>Are there specific areas where you feel
 
        improvement still needs to be made? 
  
         </p><p>MR. KELLY:  I think it's something that 
  
        has to be worked on every day.  You have to be 
  
        aware of it and be conscious of it every day.  We 
  
        don't want agencies to fall back into old habits.  And I
 
        think that it is very important at the top, 
  
        certainly here in this city, we have a great 
  
        working relationship with the Assistant Director of  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        the FBI, Kevin Donovan. 
  
         </p><p>It's something that you have to focus on 
  
        and use.  You just can't let that slip.  So I can't 
  
        think of a particular area where we would want to
 
        say we need more information in that area. 
  
         </p><p>I think it's general approach.  People 
  
        want that information to go forward.  Quite 
  
        frankly, they don't want to be caught holding onto 
  
        information that should be disseminated.  So people
 
        now see it in their interest to move that 
  
        information forward. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE:  I appreciate 
  
        that.  And we look forward to you continuing to 
  
        think about these issues and to advise us of where
 
        we may be helpful in making recommendations for 
  
        even further cooperation. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  We'd better move on 
  
        because we have two more Commissioners with 
  
        questions.  I know we're going to deal with this
 
        subject more tomorrow.  Commissioner Thompson and 
  
        Commissioner Roemer. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER THOMPSON:  I'd be interested,  
   
         </p><p>        </p><p>        </p><p>             
  
        Mr. Chairman, in hearing from either Commissioner 
  
        about their opportunity, if one has presented 
  
        itself -- I know that they have been 
  
        extraordinarily busy with their New York duties --
 
        in passing on to their peers in law enforcement and 
  
        firefighting across the United States and other 
  
        large metropolitan areas the lessons that these 
  
        departments have learned, or if they have not yet 
  
        had that opportunity, whether they plan to do that
 
        in the future. 
  
         </p><p>MR. SCOPPETTA:  A lot of our people have 
  
        spent a lot of time since 9/11 traveling to other 
  
        jurisdictions, talking about our experience, 
  
        talking about the lessons we have learned.  And in
 
        fact, when we had the McKinsey study done of our 
  
        response on 9/11, the McKinsey people and our 
  
        senior chiefs traveled across the country, both 
  
        talking about our experience and trying to learn 
  
        something from other jurisdictions.  That was
 
        extremely useful.  So there's been a lot of that. 
  
         </p><p>MR. KELLY:  We have done some of that, but 
  
        quite frankly, our focus is right here in New York.  
  
        There's an opportunity cost when you take your 
  
        senior leadership and maybe send them to other 
  
        jurisdictions.  I think people are welcome to come 
  
        here to New York.
 
         </p><p>I think the Mayor proposed that perhaps 
  
        even there is a possibility for us to maybe have some lessons 
  
        given and perhaps some money can come our way as a 
  
        result of that, but quite frankly, we are focused 
  
        on New York and protecting this city.  So we
 
        haven't done as much of that, I guess, as we could 
  
        have. 
  
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I did volunteer to the 
  
        President and to Secretary Ridge, that we would be 
  
        happy, financing and time being available, to share
 
        lessons which we learned here with other 
  
        municipalities.  Keep in mind that New York, 
  
        because of its size and density, is somewhat 
  
        different than any other city, even the other very 
  
        large cities.
 
         </p><p>To put it in perspective, our police 
  
        department is bigger than the police departments of 
  
        the next four largest cities in this country  
  
        combined.  So we have a different problem. 
  
         </p><p>Forty percent of our population was born 
  
        outside of the United States.  There is roughly 140 
  
        different languages spoken here in New York City.
 
        So when another city might look for somebody that 
  
        speaks a language, we probably have a hundred 
  
        people in the Police Department that speak that 
  
        language. 
  
         </p><p>We have a service where you can call 24
 
        hours a day, seven days a week, to interact with 
  
        municipal government.  We have identified 170 
  
        different languages that we could take your 
  
        question in and give you a response. 
  
         </p><p>I will say that when we had the terrible
 
        tragedy of 9/11, this country responded to help New 
  
        York in ways that New Yorkers will forever remember 
  
        and forever be grateful.  And I said to the 
  
        President and to Secretary Ridge, if we can find 
  
        the funding and the time, perhaps there are some
 
        ways that we can, in a small measure, by helping 
  
        the rest of this country, say thank you for their 
  
        outpouring of support back then.  
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you. 
  
         </p><p>MR. KELLY:  I just want to add one thing, 
  
        I'm sorry, Governor.  We do have an excellent 
  
        working relationship with the senior staff of the
 
        Chicago Police Department.  They did visit here 
  
        with us and we have sent representatives there.  So 
  
        I know you might have particular interest in 
  
        Illinois.  I wanted to emphasize that. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Congressman Roemer.
 
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER:  Commissioner Kelly, 
  
        you not only hit right away on one of the 
  
        Governor's concerns, you hit absolutely on the mark 
  
        in your two minutes what the United States Congress 
  
        looked at for 12 months in the Joint Inquiry with
 
        regard to what are the two key issues to make sure 
  
        the federal government is sharing information with 
  
        local Police Departments and Fire Departments and 
  
        intelligence agencies. 
  
         </p><p>The two key issues that we found, and I
 
        wish you would comment on them, are one, how do we make 
  
        sure the people in your department get clearances. 
  
        The Governor of Virginia, Jim Gilmore, eloquently  
  
        complained to Congress that he wasn't even cleared, 
  
        as a governor, to get certain information.  And how 
  
        do you then make sure that you get the information 
  
        to you and your top people.
 
         </p><p>The second issue is, as you again hit on 
  
        and I wish you'd be a little bit more explicit 
  
        about some ways we can improve this, is 
  
        actionable intelligence.  How do we improve the 
  
        specifics of that information to you the first
 
        time, if not the second time, to give you the right 
  
        information that can help you prevent some kind of 
  
        terrorist attack from taking place? 
  
         </p><p>MR. KELLY:  I think the granting of 
  
        clearances is a real issue.  It is still an issue
 
        and it obviously has to be handled on the federal 
  
        level.  There has been some give in the granting of 
  
        interim clearances, but it just has to be speeded 
  
        up. 
  
         </p><p>And we are on the receiving end of that.
 
        I think the Mayor and I have had some discussions 
  
        about that.  The background checks are extensive. 
  
        There's some archaic regulations.  
  
         </p><p>I myself have not been, I've gone through 
  
        the nomination process twice.  And when I was in 
  
        the federal government, I moved from one job to the 
  
        other requiring another clearance process.  That
 
        whole thing had to be done again, even though I was 
  
        sitting in an office.  I was an Undersecretary 
  
        moving to the Commissioner position.  I had to go 
  
        through the whole process again.  It simply did not 
  
        make sense.  So I think that we just need give
 
        in that regard. 
  
         </p><p>As far as actionable intelligence, the 
  
        problems, it just doesn't come in a neat package. 
  
        It's not specific.  We're not getting it as a 
  
        nation with great specificity.  It's not coming to
 
        us with specificity.  We're getting bits and pieces 
  
        and it's difficult for our intelligence agencies. 
  
        And we work with them.  It's difficult to put it 
  
        together.  There's no easy answer. 
  
         </p><p>And you know, we can go back 30 years and
 
        all of these discussions that we've had about 
  
        over-reliance on technology versus human 
  
        intelligence, but that's what we're faced with now,  
  
        that's what we get on a national level, that's what 
  
        comes down to us on the local level. 
  
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Let me add to that.  One 
  
        of the surest ways to let the terrorists attack us
 
        again is for all of us to stay home, seal ourselves 
  
        in, and let our economy and our lives fall apart 
  
        because of a perceived threat. 
  
         </p><p>America is a country that for 225 years 
  
        has been willing to stand up, run risks, fight to
 
        make sure that we stay a democratic country and to 
  
        try to help the rest of the world.  And we have not 
  
        gone back and hidden ourselves at home.  We have to 
  
        say, turn it over to the professionals and go about 
  
        our business.
 
         </p><p>And this constant reaction to ill-defined 
  
        terrorist threats can only damage our economy and 
  
        prevent us from responding later on when a real 
  
        threat does occur.  And we have to be very careful 
  
        that we don't go in the other direction in the
 
        interest of being able to show that we had X number 
  
        of threats and we responded here, here and here. 
  
         </p><p>The fact of the matter is, the public has  
  
        to go on.  This is, by and large, let us pray, 
  
        totally, it is a safe country.  And we have 
  
        professionals certainly in this city, and I think, 
  
        although I have a little less experience at the
 
        state and federal level, to prevent terrorist 
  
        attacks in the future, let us all pray.  In the 
  
        meantime, we have to go about our business and our 
  
        lives. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  The last question,
 
        Secretary Lehman. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN:  Yes, thank you for 
  
        your statement.  I would really like to request at 
  
        a subsequent opportunity that we get the city 
  
        government's best recommendations with regard to a
 
        problem that was highlighted in the Joint Committee 
  
        investigations and became a major criticism of the 
  
        FBI in particular, and that is the dominance of the 
  
        law-enforcement and prosecutorial approach to 
  
        terrorist issues and the obstacle that that becomes
 
        in the sharing of intelligence, which may be 
  
        evidentiary, and becomes protected as soon as an 
  
        investigation gets going, and how you, at your  
  
        level, can come up with procedures to insure that 
  
        there is full sharing among all the offices in your 
  
        government, as well as the federal government, even 
  
        at the expense of perhaps weakening the evidentiary
 
        sanctity of a prosecution.  That would be very 
  
        valuable to us in the future. 
  
         </p><p>MR. KELLY:  I agree.  I think that is an 
  
        excellent point.  I think it's an issue of culture. 
  
        We need that change, again, in the FBI, and
 
        obviously the Department of Justice, That's their 
  
        business, the prosecution. We are now forced to 
  
        be in the preventive mode where we have to focus on 
  
        stopping another event, preventing another event, 
  
        rather than doing a retrospective examination of
 
        one of these horrific events. 
  
         </p><p>It takes a lot of focus and a real 
  
        culture change in those agencies.  I think that Director Mueller is 
  
        doing an excellent job in that regard, but it is a
 
        heavy lift, and he understands it.  I've had these 
  
        conversations. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN:  Do you think you  
  
        have the right balance in the NYPD? 
  
         </p><p>MR. KELLY:  I think we have it in the 
  
        department more so than perhaps on the federal 
  
        level because I think we're literally at Ground
 
        Zero.  There is much more of an awareness of the 
  
        need for prevention than perhaps on the federal 
  
        level.  It's something we have to focus on, as 
  
        well. 
  
         </p><p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  And evidentiary
 
        considerations are not just for criminal 
  
        prosecution.  We live in a litigious society, and 
  
        we have to continue day in and day out and pay the 
  
        bills. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Mayor, I want to thank you
 
        very much, Commissioner Kelly, Commissioner 
  
        Scoppetta, Counsel, thank you for your time very, 
  
        very much today.  I appreciate it. 
  
 </p><p>I now ask the panel of Mr. Waizer, David 
  
        Lim, Lee Ielpi, Brian Birdwell and Craig Sincock,
 
        please.  All right.  Are we ready to get started 
  
        again?  We are running behind, which I apologize 
  
        for.  We did not expect the Commissioners from New  
  
        York but thought it was wrong, since they made 
  
        themselves available, they are an important part of 
  
        this, and I thought it was wrong not to ask them 
  
        questions when they offered to accept questions.
 
         </p><p>Mr. Waizer, do you want to start in? 
  
         </p><p>MR. WAIZER:  Governor Kean, members of the 
  
        Commission, thank you for asking me to speak before 
  
        you today.  My experience of 9/11 differs from 
  
        yours and that of the general public.  As this
 
        nation and much of the world watched in shock and 
  
        horror on 9/11, as events unfolded at the World 
  
        Trade Center, at the Pentagon and in the air over 
  
        the farmlands of Pennsylvania, I was otherwise 
  
        engaged, battling for my life.  If hearing my
 
        personal story can help this Commission fulfill its 
  
        important task, I will gladly tell it. 
  
         </p><p>On September 11th, at approximately 8:46 
  
        in the morning, I was in an elevator, somewhere 
  
        between the 78th and 101st floor, in Tower 1 of the
 
        World Trade Center.  I had left my wife, Karen, and 
  
        our three children, Katie then age 13, Joshua 12, 
  
        and Jodi 10, at about 7:15 that morning and I was  
  
        on my way to my offices on the 104th floor where I 
  
        was employed as Vice President and Tax Counsel in 
  
        charge of national and international tax matters 
  
        for Cantor Fitzgerald.
 
         </p><p>The elevator was ascending when, suddenly, 
  
        I felt it rocked by an explosion, and then felt it 
  
        plummeting.  Orange, streaming sparks were apparent 
  
        through the gaps in the doors at the sides of the 
  
        elevator as the elevator scraped the walls of the
 
        shaft.  The elevator burst into flame.  I began to 
  
        beat at the flames, burning my hands, arms and legs 
  
        in the process.  The flames went out, but I was hit 
  
        in the face and neck by a separate fireball that 
  
        came through the gap in the side of the elevator
 
        doors.  The elevator came to a stop on the 78th 
  
        floor, the doors opened, and I jumped out. 
  
         </p><p>I began the long walk down 78 flights in 
  
        the fire stairwell.  I walked, focused on my single 
  
        mission: to get to the streets and find an
 
        ambulance.  I knew I was seriously hurt.  The 
  
        stairwell was filled with people calmly walking 
  
        down, with no apparent sense of the magnitude of  
  
        what had just occurred.  I was shouting out to 
  
        people in the stairwell, telling them I was burned, 
  
        asking them to step aside so that I could get down 
  
        more quickly.  Faces turned towards me, sometimes
 
        with apparent annoyance at this intrusion on the 
  
        orderly evacuation process.  I saw the look on many 
  
        of those faces turn to sympathy or horror as they 
  
        saw me.  At one point I noticed a large flap of 
  
        skin hanging on my arm.  I did not look any
 
        further. 
  
         </p><p>Somewhere on the way down, I believe 
  
        around the 50th floor, I met a man who appeared to 
  
        be either a firefighter or Emergency Medical 
  
        Technician walking up.  He stopped, turned around,
 
        and walked in front of me, leading me down.  We 
  
        made it to the lobby and walked two blocks to find 
  
        an empty ambulance, which took me to the Burn 
  
        Center at New York Presbyterian Hospital.  I stayed 
  
        conscious only long enough to give them my name and
 
        my wife's phone number. 
  
         </p><p>I have no memories after that for some six 
  
        or seven weeks; I spent that period in a state of  
  
        induced coma, but I can offer a secondhand account 
  
        of some of the more important personal events.  I 
  
        was triaged at the hospital, where they took my 
  
        clothes, wallet, watch and glasses, none of which I
 
        ever saw again.  They began to cut off my wedding 
  
        band from my badly burned fingers, but a 
  
        sympathetic nurse used an entire jar of lubricant 
  
        to remove it intact and saved it for my wife. 
  
        Karen has worn that ring on a chain around her neck
 
        since then, saving it for the day when I can wear 
  
        it on my finger again. 
  
         </p><p>As the world watched with horror as the 
  
        events of that morning unfolded, Karen began 
  
        receiving phone calls from friends and relatives.
 
        She tried to call me and waited, with fading hope, 
  
        for me to call her.  Friends and family gathered at 
  
        my home to offer hope and, if the worst happened, 
  
        comfort.  My two older children, having heard of 
  
        the attack called home and were allowed to return
 
        home.  My 10 year old daughter remained in school, 
  
        unaware.  At 12:30 the nurse was finally able to 
  
        call Karen, who took the call in our kitchen and  
  
        passed the news on to the others that I was alive. 
  
        Screams and tears of joy filled that room.  But as 
  
        one nightmare ended for her, another was to begin. 
  
         </p><p>Karen had no idea how seriously I had been
 
        injured.  She was unable to reach me at the 
  
        hospital until almost 8 o'clock that evening.  When 
  
        Karen first saw me that night, I was not 
  
        recognizable.  My head was swollen almost 
  
        basketball size, the rest of my body had similarly
 
        swelled and my features were either covered by 
  
        bandages or so blackened and distorted as to be 
  
        unidentifiable.  It was only the ring that gave her 
  
        any comfort that the swollen, misshapen body lying 
  
        in that hospital bed was in fact her husband.
 
         </p><p>The doctors explained to Karen the nature 
  
        and severity of my injuries.  I was particularly at 
  
        risk because the fireball in my face had seared my 
  
        windpipe and lungs and I had inhaled a large amount 
  
        of jet fuel, leaving me particularly prone to
 
        life-threatening infections.  I have since been 
  
        told that my chances of survival at that moment 
  
        were roughly five percent.  
  
         </p><p>That night began a seven-week 
  
        roller-coaster ride for Karen, friends and family. 
  
        I would appear to be recovering one day and be 
  
        diagnosed with a highly dangerous infection the
 
        next.  I underwent multiple surgeries to graft new 
  
        skin on my hands, arms, face and neck, suffered a 
  
        blood clot, a seizure, a partial lung collapse and 
  
        a series of blood and lung infections. 
  
         </p><p>Karen's mother moved up from Delaware into
 
        our home to take care of our three children. 
  
        Members of our local and our synagogue communities 
  
        delivered dinner to our home and drove our children 
  
        to their various activities.  Friends and family 
  
        accompanied Karen to the hospital every day.  Mine
 
        was not just a personal struggle, it was shared by 
  
        family and community. 
  
         </p><p>After five months of hospitalization, 
  
        multiple surgeries, a year and a half, and 
  
        counting, of painful, sometimes grueling, therapy,
 
        I am here today to bear witness.  My injuries have 
  
        left me with lung damage, chronic pain in my right 
  
        elbow, my left knee, my back, damage to my vocal  
  
        cords and the prognosis for the nerve and tendon 
  
        damage in my hands is still uncertain.  But I can 
  
        enjoy various activities, play with my children, 
  
        and enjoy my time spent with my wife, with my
 
        friends and family. 
  
         </p><p>I am one of the handful of lucky ones. 
  
        Just blocks away from here lay the unrecovered 
  
        remains of many friends and colleagues, some dear 
  
        friends.  They can no longer speak for themselves
 
        and I am left with the unchosen, unhappy task of 
  
        trying to speak for them.  I do this with no 
  
        particular moral authority, but neither I nor they 
  
        have a choice. 
  
         </p><p>I have no rage about what happened on
 
        9/11, only a deep sadness for the many innocent, 
  
        worthy lives lost and the loved ones who lost so 
  
        much that day.  There have always been madmen, 
  
        perhaps there always will be.  They must be 
  
        stopped, but with the cold detachment reserved by a
 
        surgeon for removing a cancer.  They are not worthy 
  
        of my rage.  Neither do I feel anger at those who 
  
        arguably could have foreseen, and thereby  
  
        prevented, the tragedies.  If there were mistakes, 
  
        they were the mistakes of complacency, a 
  
        complacency in which we all shared. 
  
         </p><p>This Commission cannot turn back the hands
 
        of time.  There's nothing to be gained by asserting 
  
        blame, by pointing fingers.  The dead will remain 
  
        dead despite this Commission's best efforts and 
  
        intentions.  But it is my hope that this Commission 
  
        can learn and teach us from its scrutiny of the
 
        past, and if the findings of this Commission can 
  
        prevent even one future 9/11, if they can forestall 
  
        even one plan of Osama bin Laden, prevent even one 
  
        more act of madness and horror, I and the rest of 
  
        this nation will owe the Commission our gratitude,
 
        and I will be proud of the small part I was allowed 
  
        to play today. 
  
         </p><p>I do have one concern I would like to 
  
        voice.  I have no political experience, but I do 
  
        have experience as an informed citizen.  It tells
 
        me that commissions such as this are usually formed 
  
        by men and women of good will, have committed, 
  
        intelligent members and staff possessed of good  
  
        will, and eventually produce reports that are read 
  
        carefully and seriously by others of good will. 
  
        Yet the findings of such commissions are often 
  
        ignored in the end.  Compassion and concern are
 
        often spread thin, and other important issues 
  
        become priorities after the glare of the public 
  
        spotlight fades. 
  
         </p><p>My fear is that the work of this 
  
        Commission will have a similar fate.  My hope is
 
        that by speaking to you today, by putting a human 
  
        face on the tragedy that was 9/11, by attempting to 
  
        speak, however inadequately, for those who no 
  
        longer have voices, I can help further the cause of 
  
        this Commission and this nation, to help build a
 
        safer, more secure tomorrow for all of us, and that 
  
        doing so will help bring peace for us and our 
  
        children.  Thank you. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Mr. Waizer, thank you for 
  
        your eloquence, sir.  Mr. David Lim, of the Port
 
        Authority. 
  
         </p><p>MR. LIM:  I would first like to say, that 
  
        was one of the most moving statements I have ever  
  
        heard.  And it makes what I have to say, I guess, 
  
        pale in comparison. 
  
         </p><p>I would like to thank the Commission, 
  
        Governor Kean, for allowing me to speak before you
 
        today in regards to my personal experience on 9/11. 
  
        As Mr. Waizer said, if what I can tell you will 
  
        help you in any way, find a cause to prevent future 
  
        happening of events such as this, speaking from a 
  
        police officer's point of view, will be greatly
 
        appreciated. 
  
         </p><p>I saw, I saw a great number of my 
  
        brethren, 37 Port Authority police officers were 
  
        killed that day.  Port Authority police only had 
  
        1,100 police officers at that time.  And therein
 
        lies my responsibility, the same as Mr. Waizer's, I 
  
        have to speak now for those who can no longer 
  
        speak. 
  
         </p><p>I guess that's where it lies heaviest for 
  
        me.  These men and women, like myself, were just
 
        doing our jobs that day, something we do every day. 
  
        And only recently, I guess, it's appreciated, 
  
        unfortunately, through our great loss.  
  
         </p><p>Someone asked why the Port Authority 
  
        police were in the World Trade Center, with the 
  
        exception of Governor Kean, of course.  The Port 
  
        Authority police are in the World Trade Center
 
        because the Port Authority of New York and New 
  
        Jersey built the World Trade Center.  They built it 
  
        back in the '70s and from the first time they dug 
  
        the first hole, there was a Port Authority police 
  
        officer present to provide security for that area.
 
         </p><p>When I first became a police officer, that 
  
        was back in 1980, I'll be perfectly honest, I 
  
        didn't know a lot of Port Authority police.  I 
  
        wanted to be a police officer.  I wanted to serve 
  
        the public.  So I learned.
 
         </p><p>I learned that the Port Authority police 
  
        were responsible for most of the 
  
        public-transportation facilities in the bi-state 
  
        area, which of course includes tunnels, bridges, 
  
        airports, areas which obviously need security but
 
        post-9/11 have now become the most highlighted 
  
        areas in this area, in this theater of terrorism. 
  
        But I digress.  
  
         </p><p>I wanted to say a lot of things today 
  
        about the Port Authority, but I think, I guess, I 
  
        said enough about that.  And I'm going to tell you 
  
        about what happened to me that day.  When I tell
 
        you this, I want you to remember what I tell you is 
  
        not the story of just David Lim, it's the story of 
  
        every police officer, firefighter, EMS, civilians 
  
        that were helping out that day. 
  
         </p><p>As the governor, Governor Pataki, said to
 
        you earlier, it was a day that we all came 
  
        together.  We, everybody, pulled together to help 
  
        every else.  You will understand that as I tell my 
  
        story. 
  
         </p><p>I myself have been a Port Authority police
 
        officer for 23 years, the greater part of that at 
  
        the World Trade Center Command until I got into the 
  
        Canine Unit and have been doing that for the last 
  
        six years.  And that's where my story begins. 
  
         </p><p>I was working on 9/11, like I do every
 
        day, with my partner, Sirius, my explosive-detector 
  
        canine, checking trucks coming into the World Trade 
  
        Center.  This was considered vital, considering  
  
        what happened in '93.  We did this every day with a 
  
        great feeling that we were accomplishing a very 
  
        necessary job. 
  
         </p><p>The Trade Center itself, I can speak to
 
        the security.  We had delta barriers and all kinds 
  
        of security situations set up to prevent future 
  
        terrorist attacks after '93.  On that day I had 
  
        just finished up searching a multitude of trucks 
  
        with my partner and I had retired to my office to
 
        do my paperwork and have a little breakfast. 
  
         </p><p>8:45 a.m. all that changed.  I was in the 
  
        basement of Number 2 World Trade Center, yet I felt 
  
        the shock of the first plane hitting Tower 1.  And 
  
        that could give you at least a start of the idea of
 
        the power of that hit, if I was in the basement of 
  
        the other building.  I secured my partner in his 
  
        kennel, told him that I had to go help the people 
  
        -- he was a bomb dog, not a search-and-rescue dog 
  
        -- and I figured he'd be safe there while I went to
 
        assist.  Unfortunately, that was the last time I 
  
        saw him. 
  
         </p><p>I went over to Tower Number 1 to the  
  
        mezzanine level by the plaza by the sound stage 
  
        where they would have summertime shows.  I was 
  
        assisting people out of the A staircase as they 
  
        were coming out of the building.  At this point the
 
        debris was already falling onto the plaza. 
  
        Somebody screamed that a body was outside on the 
  
        plaza.  I went over to investigate.  And sure 
  
        enough, was the first body that I had seen. 
  
         </p><p>It's not something that I'm going to
 
        describe here, there's no point.  It's just 
  
        something that I will never forget for the rest of 
  
        my life.  Here, as a police officer, at that point 
  
        I guess 21-and-a-half-years, was what I thought was 
  
        the most important thing, I had a body, a DOA.  I
 
        had a lot of procedures to follow.  And I went to 
  
        call it in on the radio. 
  
         </p><p>And just as I did that, another body fell 
  
        about 10 feet away from that one.  And all of a 
  
        sudden, what I thought was the most important thing
 
        to take care of, this body, became inconsequential 
  
        in the fact that obviously things were going to get 
  
        a lot worse than this one body that I had seen.  
  
         </p><p>I took it upon myself at that point to 
  
        start heading up into the building to assist before 
  
        people would start jumping out of the building.  I 
  
        started going up the stairs and I saw a lot of
 
        frightened faces.  People were asking me what was 
  
        going on.  At that point I already heard about the 
  
        airplane, but I lowered my radio to prevent people 
  
        from getting too scared. 
  
         </p><p>I kept on going up, telling people to keep
 
        going down, down is good.  I remember running into 
  
        people similar to Mr. Waizer that were burned, 
  
        asking for help.  What I did was I assigned those 
  
        people to people that were healthy to 
  
        help get them down.  I felt the greater good was
 
        for me to get to a higher point to try to assist 
  
        those people upstairs. 
  
         </p><p>I got to the 27th floor and I saw a man in 
  
        a wheelchair waiting with his friend.  I remember 
  
        this because it's very important.  I went up to him
 
        and he said he was waiting for the crowd to clear 
  
        and then he would go down.  Coming up another 
  
        staircase, the B staircase, was the Fire Department  
  
        who said that they would take care of the gentleman 
  
        and that if I wanted, to proceed up. 
  
         </p><p>Well, I tell you, I went into the 
  
        staircase that they came out of and, as you'll
 
        hear, it was very important.  As I went to that 
  
        staircase, there were more people coming down. 
  
        There were some clogs of people, but generally they 
  
        were calm and they were not too frightened.  At 
  
        this point it was still rather early, but they were
 
        going down orderly. 
  
         </p><p>I got up to the 44th floor, Tower 1, the 
  
        sky lobby.  I had made that my goal based on the 
  
        fact that there are express elevators that are 
  
        situated on that floor.  My fear was that people
 
        coming from the middle floors would get onto those 
  
        elevators and try to take the quicker way down. 
  
         </p><p>I have learned from my training in ESU 
  
        that an elevator is probably not one of the better 
  
        places to be.  And I apologize for that, you know,
 
        it's just you didn't know, obviously, you know, at 
  
        the time.  I'm talking about post-emergency. 
  
         </p><p>And sure enough, just as I was starting to  
  
        get the people down, I felt another collision on 
  
        the left side.  Looking out the window I saw this 
  
        rain of fire coming down and it blew out the 
  
        windows on the 44th floor.  Fortunately, I was
 
        right in the middle, I was not burned, but I was 
  
        knocked to the ground by the concussion.  I grabbed 
  
        whatever people I had left. 
  
         </p><p>And at this point, as you say, I knew we 
  
        were under attack.  I thought it was an accident,
 
        there was no reason to think otherwise at that 
  
        point.  A horrible accident, something we actually 
  
        had trained for, I remember, in the '80s in case 
  
        something like that would happen.  But as I started 
  
        going down and taking the people with me, I could
 
        see the fear in their eyes growing. 
  
         </p><p>The building now was starting to shake and 
  
        was not the stablest, you know, in other words, it 
  
        was not very stable.  I'll just leave it at that. 
  
        As we were going down, I was clearing the floors,
 
        getting people that were left behind that were 
  
        waiting.  Most of them were either handicapped, 
  
        elderly, had someone coming with disabilities, but at  
  
        this point there was no more waiting.  We had to 
  
        go. 
  
         </p><p>So I proceeded to gather them, right, and 
  
        start going, start heading down.  We got to about the
 
        35th floor, in that general area.  I don't remember 
  
        specifically when I felt the building shaking.  I 
  
        thought for sure that my building was collapsing. 
  
        It shook and it stopped. 
  
         </p><p>Then I heard on the radio something I will
 
        never forget, it was from our police desk over at 5 
  
        World Trade Center.  And the transmission said, 
  
        "Tower 2 is down, all units evacuate Tower 1."  I 
  
        couldn't believe it.  What do you mean, Tower 2 is 
  
        down?  I mean, it's the World Trade Center.  Each
 
        building, 1,477 feet, can withstand anything.  But 
  
        it also raised in my mind if that building can 
  
        fall, so can mine. 
  
         </p><p>And now the people I was with were very 
  
        upset, of course.  I just told them, we have to
 
        keep going.  And we started heading down again.  On 
  
        the 21st floor I ran into three of my supervisors, 
  
        Chief Romito, Captain Mazza and Lieutenant Cirri.   
  
        They were assisting a gentleman who has having 
  
        difficulty walking and breathing.  They were making 
  
        a stretcher out of a soda push cart. 
  
         </p><p>I told the chief about the other building
 
        going down and that this collapse was imminent.  So 
  
        he gathered the gentleman, one arm over his 
  
        shoulder, Lieutenant Cirri grabbed the other arm, 
  
        and we proceeded to take him down the building with 
  
        Captain Mazza, myself and our people.  We went
 
        down. 
  
         </p><p>As we were going down, and now we were 
  
        starting to lose power in the building, the lights 
  
        were going on and off.  We had some emergency lighting in 
  
        the staircase and after '93, they'd painted stripes
 
        and they glow and it was very eerie watching the 
  
        stairs as they lit up.  I concentrated on the task 
  
        at hand, which was to get the people out of the 
  
        building. 
  
         </p><p>I got down to the fifth floor and I saw,
 
        that is where I met Josephine Harris and Ladder 
  
        Company 6, Ladder Company 6, a fire company out of 
  
        Chinatown.  Josephine Harris, who is a Port  
  
        Authority employee, had walked down 72 flights, and 
  
        she had a bad leg problem and she could go no 
  
        further. 
  
         </p><p>Captain Jonas, of Ladder 6, was attempting
 
        to find a chair to put her in to help carry her 
  
        down.  I told the captain it was too late.  And 
  
        following my chief's lead, I grabbed Josephine by 
  
        one arm, Firefighter Tommy Falco grabbed the other 
  
        arm, with Billy Butler right behind us, we started
 
        going down. 
  
         </p><p>I remember my captain, Captain Mazza, 
  
        telling me to leave and let the Fire Department 
  
        handle that and to go with her.  And I just said, 
  
        I'm helping out, just go ahead.  Well, one more
 
        flight down was as far as we got and the building 
  
        started coming down.  I knew that was it because 
  
        the other building was already gone.  The memory of 
  
        that is very sharp in my mind, something I'll never 
  
        forget.  People always ask me, of course, but this,
 
        I knew it was coming down. 
  
         </p><p>All I could think of is, well, if I could 
  
        protect Josephine from the debris.  So me and Tommy  
  
        were covering her and it started coming.  And you 
  
        could feel the wind of pushing down as they were 
  
        compressing through the building, you could hear 
  
        the sound.  It was like an on-rushing locomotive or
 
        an avalanche.  You could almost feel the sound of 
  
        the floors pancaking on top of each other as they 
  
        were collapsing.  As we all know, they collapsed 
  
        straight down. 
  
         </p><p>Actually, one of the firefighters, Matty,
 
        actually blew right by us as he went down.  I 
  
        didn't even know that until afterwards.  And they 
  
        just kept coming and coming.  And I guess my final 
  
        thoughts were about my family.  I thought about my 
  
        wife, my kids.  Excuse me.  I hoped they would
 
        think well of me for what I did.  I was very 
  
        fortunate.  When the debris stopped falling -- 
  
        excuse me. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Just take your time. 
  
         </p><p>MR. LIM -- first I thought I had died.  I
 
        heard nothing, I saw nothing.  But then I heard a 
  
        voice, I heard a voice, the voice of Captain Jonas, 
  
        my new friend.  The voice was, "Who's here?"  And I  
  
        heard a fireman that was in the stairwell with us 
  
        shouting out the names of companies.  I remember 
  
        saying, "Lim, Port Authority police." 
  
         </p><p>We couldn't see each other.  It was
 
        totally black.  We couldn't breathe.  We had to try 
  
        to breathe through our shirts, but we were fairly, 
  
        in fairly good shape.  We were alive.  And we were 
  
        very grateful for that. 
  
         </p><p>I hoped then that Captain Jonas and the
 
        men of Ladder 6 and there were other fire companies 
  
        below us, of course, there was a total of 12 
  
        firefighters, Josephine and myself in that 
  
        stairwell.  And for five hours, we fought to get 
  
        out of there.  When I say we fought, we fought as a
 
        team. 
  
         </p><p>There were times you may have heard in New 
  
        York that firefighters and police officers sometimes 
  
        don't get along.  Well, we changed all that. 
  
        Between their actions and my expertise, after
 
        working almost 20 years in the building, we did 
  
        manage eventually to work our way out. 
  
         </p><p>We also managed to get ahold of our  
  
        families, I was fortunate to have a couple of cell 
  
        phones, and managed to get through to let them know 
  
        that we were okay.  And that was probably one of 
  
        the hardest moments for me was trying to explain to
 
        my wife that I might not get out of there.  But 
  
        she's strong, a good cop's wife, she understood, I 
  
        was doing my job. 
  
         </p><p>We ended up going up to get out through 
  
        the sixth floor stair, top of the staircase.  We
 
        had started smelling jet fuel in the staircase, 
  
        unburned jet fuel, and the fear of fire had caused 
  
        us to work even harder to get out.  We saw a light 
  
        over the sixth-floor staircase and our first 
  
        thought was that the floor had power in it and it was
 
        virtually, or at least partially, intact, we could 
  
        make our stand there. 
  
         </p><p>We felt we would be there for a lot longer 
  
        than five hours.  As it turns out, as that light 
  
        got brighter, it turned out to be the sun.  We were
 
        virtually standing on top of what was left of the 
  
        World Trade Center.  When I say that, you have to 
  
        picture a straw in a pancake.  We were in that  
  
        straw. 
  
         </p><p>By all the engineers and everybody else 
  
        that tried to figure this out, there's no reason 
  
        why I should be sitting here talking to you right
 
        now.  It was just a small sliver of staircase from 
  
        the sixth floor down to the first floor, damaged, 
  
        though still enough to keep us alive, that 
  
        preserved our lives. 
  
         </p><p>We finally got through on the radio to
 
        Ladder Company 43 and they managed to come and 
  
        throw us ropes.  We managed to climb down onto the 
  
        debris field in order to exit.  They sent two of 
  
        their officers to stand by with Josephine for a 
  
        basket in order to carry her out.
 
         </p><p>Then came the trek to get out of Ground 
  
        Zero.  And that in itself was treacherous.  One of 
  
        our party had a concussion, Mikey Meldrom, so I was 
  
        helping him.  And the field was still on fire. 
  
        There were things that we saw that, like I said, there is
 
        no need to repeat. 
  
         </p><p>So we attempted to exit actually through, 
  
        ironically enough, the U.S. Customs House over at  
  
        Six World Trade Center, but then we saw fire and we 
  
        heard what we thought was gunfire.  And I guess in 
  
        my moment of stress, I thought we were under attack 
  
        and these guys had landed on the beach.  And all I
 
        could think of was, well, I've got 46 rounds, I'll 
  
        take 'em. 
  
         </p><p>But as it turned out, it was just ammunition 
  
        going off.  But you still couldn't go out that way. 
  
        We ended up going out by One World Trade Center and
 
        exiting on West Street.  We finally got out, I 
  
        think it was around 3:30 or so and we were beaten, 
  
        but we were alive, virtually with minor injuries. 
  
         </p><p>Myself, I was taken to the hospital with a 
  
        concussion and some leg and back injuries which I
 
        have recovered from.  But I guess it's the mental 
  
        injuries that I still suffer at times.  Yes, I 
  
        still have some nightmares, I still have trouble, 
  
        as you can see, talking about this at times, but I 
  
        think it's important that we as a people move on.
 
         </p><p>One of the questions that I'm usually 
  
        asked when I do speak about this is why don't I 
  
        retire.  I'm a 20-plus man, I can retire any time.   
  
        And my answer is that I will retire at a time of my 
  
        choosing, not at the choosing of some knucklehead 
  
        from Afghanistan.  No way is he going to determine 
  
        when this cop is going to quit.
 
         </p><p>I just again want to thank you for 
  
        allowing me to speak here.  And I know, I know it's 
  
        obviously not quite as important as all the people 
  
        that we lost.  I grieve for all those that I knew 
  
        that day, I grieve for those that I will never
 
        know, but I also grieve for the best partner I ever 
  
        had.  Thank you very much. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Thank you. Mr. Ielpi? 
  
         </p><p>MR. IELPI:  Good morning.  Before I start, 
  
        let me say two things.  One, I'm not used to
 
        reading, I'd rather talk candidly, but I'm going to 
  
        have to read for time.  And two, some of the things 
  
        I'm going to say are going to be sensitive to some 
  
        of the families that might be listening, so I'd 
  
        like to let them know ahead of time.
 
         </p><p>I come to you today as an ambassador for 
  
        the dead and on behalf of the many others who 
  
        toiled at Ground Zero to recover the victims of the  
  
        terrorist attack.  My son Jonathan, a member of 
  
        Squad Company 288 at the New York City Fire 
  
        Department, was killed in the South Tower. 
  
         </p><p>I am a retired firefighter and a grieving
 
        father.  I bring no political agenda to this 
  
        hearing.  The only baggage I bear is a broken heart 
  
        and a resolve that the terrible events of September 
  
        11th not be repeated. 
  
         </p><p>Ten minutes is a very short time to
 
        summarize even one day of the horror and loss that 
  
        filled Ground Zero.  It is far too short to describe 
  
        nine months of picking though rubble and debris, to 
  
        find torsos, fingers, arms, bones and legs. Far too 
  
        short to convey one year and seven months of
 
        missing my son and looking into the sorrowful eyes 
  
        of his mother, his siblings, his wife, his 
  
        children.  I can only summarize.  I cannot 
  
        summarize an eternity, I can only share with you 
  
        some of the images of Ground Zero that I will carry
 
        with me forever. 
  
         </p><p>That morning when I arrived at the Trade 
  
        Center site, I got there about half an hour, within  
  
        a half an hour after the South Tower had come down. 
  
        I saw my first fatality, a New York City 
  
        firefighter laying by his apparatus.  I continued 
  
        down the block.  I got down to West and Vessey
 
        where the walkway spanned the West Side Highway. 
  
        It had collapsed onto a number of fire vehicles. 
  
        We were able to crawl underneath of these vehicles 
  
        and start a search. 
  
         </p><p>We were able to turn off some of the
 
        engines that were still running.  All of the souls 
  
        that ran underneath of this walkway to find shelter 
  
        were dead.  My primary reason, of course, was to 
  
        find my son.  My ultimate reason was to find my 
  
        son.  I continued searching with a lot of my
 
        friends that I had met.  I had been a firefighter 
  
        for some 26 years and I know a lot of people on the 
  
        job. 
  
         </p><p>The searching continued in and out of 
  
        voids, under and around spaces, and over and above,
 
        only to find death.  We found no life.  After the 
  
        first bunch of hours at the site, for the remainder 
  
        of those nine months, we were to find nobody alive.  
  
        We were only going to find death. 
  
         </p><p>I continued that day in searching.  It 
  
        became quite obvious as we progressed that it was 
  
        going to be a difficult day for my family.  The
 
        following days were much the same.  I spent the 
  
        better part of nine months at that site searching. 
  
         </p><p>I met a lot of wonderful people that came 
  
        from across this country to assist us.  I cannot 
  
        begin to tell you how wonderful it was to see and
 
        talk and listen to these people.  These were men 
  
        and women that came to serve us, to serve us food, 
  
        to listen to us, to cry with us, to not say 
  
        anything to us. 
  
         </p><p>We worked with operating engineers, we
 
        worked with carpenters, we worked with iron 
  
        workers, we worked with police, we worked with 
  
        fire.  I worked with a number of fathers who came 
  
        to look for their sons.  I brought a picture along 
  
        with me that I will leave here.  Many of these
 
        fathers that came did not find their sons. 
  
         </p><p>On December 11th, three months to the day, 
  
        I had left the site, I was home, it was about 11:30  
  
        at night, I got a phone call.  It was Paul Ferro, 
  
        who was the Deputy Chief at the site.  He was 
  
        working the night tour.  When I heard his voice, I 
  
        knew what it was.  Paul said, Lee, we have your
 
        son.  I said okay, Paul, I'll be right there. 
  
         </p><p>I got my son Brendan, who is also a 
  
        firefighter, we hopped in a car.  We had a fire 
  
        vehicle at our disposal.  We headed back to the 
  
        site.  At about 1:30 in the morning, my son Brendan
 
        and I started our descent down into the site.  And 
  
        this is within the slurry-wall area, bathtub, 
  
        otherwise known as, about 35 to 40 feet below 
  
        level. 
  
         </p><p>Over on the side was a stokes basket, and
 
        my son was in it.  He was covered with an American 
  
        flag.  Paul Ferro came over to me and he put his 
  
        hands on my shoulder and he said, Lee, he's all 
  
        there.  That meant something to me.  And I will 
  
        explain it later.
 
         </p><p>I went over to my son.  I knelt down.  I 
  
        spoke to him.  I still had to feel him from head to 
  
        toe to satisfy my own curiosity.  Then with the  
  
        help of my son Brendan and some of the men from 
  
        Squad 288, we picked up my son and we carried him 
  
        up the hill.  We placed him in an ambulance and my 
  
        son Brendan and I rode with him to the morgue.  We
 
        were able to bring home our son in one piece and we 
  
        put him to bed at home where he belonged. 
  
         </p><p>We have a chart here, if I could just show 
  
        it for a second.  The work that continued at the 
  
        site went on for almost nine months.  The New York
 
        City Fire Department used the GPS system to mark 
  
        every remain that was found.  This map, you can see 
  
        the vast majority of remains, those are the towers. 
  
         </p><p>Those towers sit within the slurry-wall 
  
        area.  That area goes down six stories deep.  Every
 
        dot there represents a body part.  We could not 
  
        represent all of them because we went from grade 
  
        level down to six stories below, so one dot may 
  
        represent 5, 10, 15, 20 body parts.  Thank you.  I 
  
        will leave that with you also.
 
         </p><p>We meet with the -- I belong to the 
  
        Coalition of 9/11 Families.  We meet with the 
  
        Medical Examiner's Office every three weeks.  I'll  
  
        give you just a couple of quick figures here. 
  
        Between Shanksville of course, Pennsylvania, and 
  
        the Pentagon, we know that some 3,000 lives were 
  
        taken that day.  At the World Trade Center site,
 
        2,792 souls were murdered that day, 19,934 body 
  
        parts were retrieved in nine months. 
  
         </p><p>To date, 6,438 of those remains have been 
  
        identified.  To date, 13,447 of those remains still 
  
        are unidentified and remain at the Medical
 
        Examiner's Office.  Fourteen hundred and seveny seven families have been 
  
        notified that their loved ones were found.  1,312 
  
        have not.  Out of 2,792 souls lost at the World 
  
        Trade Center, there were only 292 whole bodies. 
  
        There will never be any more than 292 whole bodies.
 
        My son was one of those whole bodies. 
  
         </p><p>One night after all the recovery work was 
  
        over, I was at the site, six stories below grade at 
  
        bedrock, for a small tribute.  There were many of 
  
        them.  Afterwards, as I was ready to leave, I
 
        realized that no one was working.  As I started to 
  
        walk that long walk to the ramp that led out to 
  
        street level, a Port Authority cop that I know  
  
        drove by and said, "Would you like a ride up the 
  
        hill?"  I said, "No, I think I would like to walk." 
  
        He understood and he left. 
  
         </p><p>I had never been down there where there
 
        was this fire.  I walked over to where they found 
  
        my son.  I cannot describe the overwhelming feeling 
  
        of warmth and sadness as I stood there.  And I 
  
        could hear people talking.  It was a very powerful 
  
        feeling.  Now I guess I'm going to try to help you
 
        hear those voices too. 
  
         </p><p>We cannot change what happened on 
  
        September 11th, but it must not be forgotten and it 
  
        must never happen again.  America's guardians 
  
        failed us on 9/11.  You are now the guardians of
 
        that legacy of that horrible day.  Each of you 
  
        personally, not merely as a member of a commission, 
  
        now bear responsibility to see that the lessons you 
  
        learn at these hearings are remembered, and more 
  
        importantly, acted on.
 
         </p><p>I urge you not to fail the past or the 
  
        future.  And I thank you for the time. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much.   
  
        Colonel Birdwell? 
  
         </p><p>COLONEL BIRDWELL:  Good morning, Governor 
  
        Kean, members of the Commission.  Thank you for 
  
        affording me this opportunity to share with you my
 
        experiences from the events of September 11th. 
  
        It's also my distinct honor to be a representative 
  
        of those in our national defense, the Pentagon and 
  
        those currently serving overseas right now. 
  
         </p><p>First let me establish where I was located
 
        inside the Pentagon at the moment of impact of 
  
        American Airlines Flight 77.  You have a slide 
  
        inside your packet that I provided that gives you 
  
        that layout.  Inside the attached slide, you'll see 
  
        the impact point on the E-ring, the outermost ring
 
        of the building.  To the left of the collapsed 
  
        structure, my office window is circled in yellow. 
  
         </p><p>The top right-hand portion of the slide is 
  
        called the corridor.  The corridors are the spokes 
  
        of the building that connect the rings to one
 
        another.  The rectangular tan box designated with a 
  
        red X at the top of the building shows the location 
  
        of the elevators within the corridor.  
  
         </p><p>As I stepped out of the men's restroom 
  
        inside corridor 4 on the second floor to return to 
  
        my office, I was passing in front of those 
  
        elevators at the moment of impact, in fact moving
 
        toward the point of impact.  The arrow originating 
  
        from my circled office window indicates the window 
  
        I was facing at the time of impact, approximately 
  
        15 to 20 yards behind that window inside the 
  
        corridor.
 
         </p><p>As you can see from the slide, I had just 
  
        crossed the path of the plane in going to the 
  
        restroom and was just seconds from being in the 
  
        direct path of the plane at the time of the impact. 
  
        When an 80-ton airliner traveling at over 300 miles
 
        an hour with over 10,000 gallons of petroleum jet-A 
  
        slams into a building 15 to 20 yards from you, 
  
        you may also discern that I sit here at the 
  
        miraculous hand of Christ. 
  
         </p><p>In surviving the concussion and being
 
        conscious through it, the blast, the fire, the 
  
        smoke, I am able to provide for you a glimpse of 
  
        the ghastly, firey death that many died in that  
  
        day.  By virtue of surviving my injuries, I can 
  
        provide you the great detail of the emotional and 
  
        physical trauma of the critically injured. 
  
         </p><p>As a husband and father, I can share with
 
        you the physical and emotional strain of my wife 
  
        Mel and my son Matt as I experienced throughout my 
  
        hospitalization and continued recovery.  Let me 
  
        share with you a little bit of that experience of 
  
        my wife.
 
         </p><p>I too would offer the same thing that Lee 
  
        offered as well, to the family members in the room 
  
        today.  At the moment of impact I went, in an 
  
        instant, from a well-lit corridor that I had 
  
        traversed many times to an earthly hell of fire,
 
        choking black smoke, physical and emotional pain 
  
        and the disorientation, all of which seemed to last 
  
        an eternity. 
  
         </p><p>First was the physical pain of the fire. 
  
        My body was burned with 60 to 65 percent total body
 
        surface burn area on my back, legs, face, neck, 
  
        arms, hands, with approximately 40 percent of my 
  
        burns being third degree.  Portions of my face and  
  
        each entire arm required complete grafting of skin 
  
        from those portions of my body that could donate 
  
        such skin.  The heat, smoke and fuel vapor within 
  
        my lungs inflicted a serious inhalation injury on
 
        me, as well.  Second, I was disoriented and unable 
  
        to navigate my way out of the building due to the 
  
        loss of lighting, combined with the smoke that was 
  
        pouring out of the building. 
  
         </p><p>I cannot put into words, there are none
 
        sufficient in the English language, to describe for 
  
        you the abject terror and panic that I experienced, 
  
        not only facing such grievous, life-threatening 
  
        injuries, but at the same time the inability to 
  
        escape them.  Third, I knew I was facing the
 
        finality of my life.  I thought about how I had 
  
        said good-bye to my wife Mel that morning, and my 
  
        son Matt, and how it would be my last. 
  
         </p><p>In moments immediately after impact, I 
  
        reacted normally with the survival instincts of
 
        trying to save myself.  I attempted to get to my 
  
        feet but was unable to do so, given the concussion 
  
        and blast of the explosion and the subsequent  
  
        vacuum that had to be filled and the damage that 
  
        had on my sense of balance.  After an undetermined 
  
        amount of time, I eventually accepted my death and 
  
        collapsed to the floor and waited for whatever that
 
        feeling is of the soul departing your body.  By 
  
        God's grace, I never felt that feeling. 
  
         </p><p>Instead, I could feel liquid running down 
  
        my face, but it wasn't blood, it was cold.  In fact 
  
        it was water.  I had collapsed into one of the
 
        functioning sprinkler systems inside the Pentagon. 
  
        That water was able to douse the flames on and 
  
        around me and I was eventually evacuated for 
  
        treatment at Georgetown University Hospital. 
  
         </p><p>In my written remarks, I wanted to pause
 
        and move on in the interests of time, but let me 
  
        share just a little bit of that with you, if I may, 
  
        Governor.  With your permission, let me just share 
  
        that with you. 
  
         </p><p>Inside corridor 4 on the second floor,
 
        there are portions that were still under 
  
        renovation, portions that were, on my right side, 
  
        that were plywooded up, still under construction.   
  
        Portions on my left were badge-access doors that, 
  
        even though my badge was burned beyond recognition 
  
        at that point, even if it had functioned, I did not 
  
        have access to those areas.  The corridor to the
 
        A-ring, which is the innermost circle, the 
  
        innermost ring of the Pentagon, the fire doors had 
  
        already closed.  I was only operating with 
  
        emergency lights and the will to survive and God's 
  
        grace am I still being alive.
 
         </p><p>As I moved, actually staggered, it was not 
  
        a walk, it was not calm, I was not able to run, I 
  
        got down to about B-ring where Bill McKennan and 
  
        Roy Wallace stepped out of the B-ring doors to see if 
  
        there were any survivors inside the hallway.  I was
 
        the only one there.  Pieces of my skin were still 
  
        hanging off of me, pants burned, portions of my 
  
        polyester pants had melted to me.  It's not a 
  
        description I wish to go into in greater detail 
  
        because Roy was already rather descriptive of it
 
        for me already. 
  
         </p><p>They and two other gentlemen carried me to 
  
        the A-ring through one of the passages that they  
  
        had within their area, took me to Redskins Snack 
  
        Bar.  You may be familiar with that, Secretary 
  
        Lehman.  At that point I was laid down for triage 
  
        with five other seriously injured people.  I was
 
        the first one evacuated. 
  
         </p><p>Fortunately, I had a great Air Force 
  
        doctor, Dr. Baxter, give me a shot of morphine in 
  
        my foot and then in the other foot gave me the IV 
  
        bag.  My feet were the only portion of my body that
 
        they could determine was not seriously injured.  I 
  
        was immediately evacuated by ambulance inside the 
  
        Pentagon up to North Parking, from North Parking 
  
        taken to Georgetown University Hospital by a Ford 
  
        Expedition.
 
         </p><p>Inside Georgetown University, I had yet 
  
        another seminal moment.  Major John Collison had 
  
        accompanied me to Georgetown.  I knew that when Dr. 
  
        Williams, the attending physician there, told me 
  
        they were soon to place me under general anesthesia
 
        and intubate me that he was going to do the best he 
  
        could to save my life. But I also knew that I was 
  
        facing, in being under anesthesia, that my last  
  
        words were maybe those that I now speak. 
  
         </p><p>I asked John to take the wedding ring off 
  
        my finger.  It removed skin, it removed muscle, it 
  
        removed other tissue, but I don't recall it
 
        hurting.  I don't know if that was because of the 
  
        morphine that I received from Dr. Baxter or because 
  
        I was more concerned with the manner of my death 
  
        and how my life or my death was going to give 
  
        witness to those on the medical staff.
 
         </p><p>John took the ring off.  I looked at the 
  
        hospital chaplain and asked to say a prayer, a 
  
        prayer of salvation, actually, rather, sovereignty 
  
        of God in my life, not of salvation.  We said that 
  
        prayer.  And after that prayer I had the peace of
 
        God's concern in my life and his sovereignty in my 
  
        life to look at Dr. Williams and say, let's get on 
  
        with it, resting in his sovereignty. 
  
         </p><p>I was fortunate, as you can imagine, to be 
  
        sitting here with you today.  I was evacuated to
 
        Washington Hospital Center Burn Unit by ambulance, 
  
        or by air ambulance, after the FAA had opened air 
  
        space inside Washington D.C.  That evening I was  
  
        admitted where I would spend the next three-plus 
  
        months enduring 30 surgeries, 24 days on a 
  
        respirator, 26 days in intensive care, nearly 90 
  
        days breathing through a trache, numerous tank
 
        sessions of sterile debridement in a solution of 
  
        water, iodine and chlorine -- and I can tell you 
  
        that is, short of being a prisoner of war, probably 
  
        the most horrific, painful experience you can 
  
        endure -- three days of maggots to eat the dead
 
        tissue off my arms, to sterilize the infection, to 
  
        give me live tissue, living tissue, that the 
  
        doctors could then graft on top of, daily physical 
  
        therapy to the point of requiring a morphine 
  
        derivative, Dilaudid, prior to each session, in
 
        addition to the scheduled pain medications. 
  
         </p><p>The physical environment was agonizing, 
  
        but the emotional pain was probably far worse. 
  
        Seeing the anguish my wife was enduring on my 
  
        behalf, the separation she endured from Matt and to
 
        complicate that emotional pain was my inability to 
  
        communicate with her for a good portion of my 
  
        hospitalization, and that physical incapacitation  
  
        combined with the pain medications that I was 
  
        receiving. 
  
         </p><p>Mel and Matt had already overcome the 
  
        immediate torment of those first few moments and
 
        hours of watching the attacks.  Mel had previously 
  
        accompanied me to my office when we made the move 
  
        from one part of the building to the other.  She 
  
        knew that my office overlooked the helipad and in 
  
        watching the local news coverage, saw the helipad
 
        and the row of windows overlooking it with fire 
  
        coming out of them. 
  
         </p><p>Mel and Matt eventually learned that I was 
  
        alive and were quite overjoyed at that.  The 
  
        greatest challenges ahead were dealing with the
 
        medical setbacks that are indicative of not knowing 
  
        if I would survive.  In our visits together, 
  
        especially Matt's, the overtone was always, is this 
  
        my last chance to speak with Dad alive. 
  
         </p><p>By virtue of the hand of the Lord, an
 
        outstanding group of medical professionals, the 
  
        presence of my church and the presence of the U.S. 
  
        Army family, I sit here before you enjoying the  
  
        remainder of my life.  I trust that you will keep 
  
        my life and those of other citizens of this great 
  
        nation in mind as you go about the business of 
  
        determining how we can improve our processes to
 
        combat terrorism. 
  
         </p><p>I look forward to answering any questions 
  
        that you may have about my family's experience. 
  
        Again, thank you for the honor to be here with you 
  
        today.
 
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Mr. Sincock? 
  
         </p><p>DR. SINCOCK:  Mr. Chairman, Commissioners, 
  
        I'm Dr. Craig Sincock of Woodbridge, Virginia.  To 
  
        me, it is an honor to come to you today as a 
  
        citizen, an Army officer of 34 years, and as a
 
        surviving spouse of September 11, 2001. 
  
         </p><p>Before I proceed into the things that I 
  
        had written down, this gentleman right beside me, 
  
        Brian Birdwell, is the only survivor out of my 
  
        wife's office.  He is now my dearest friend.  He's
 
        like a brother to me. 
  
         </p><p>The Pentagon was my building and it was my 
  
        wife's building too, my wife, Cheryle.  I was first  
  
        stationed there in 1985, brand new W-2 with the 
  
        Army.  My wife came in 1987, working as an Army 
  
        civil servant.  Both of us went to work there, 
  
        usually together, from those years until the events
 
        of 9/11.  I worked in just about every corridor and 
  
        most of the floors of that building.  I met 
  
        countless thousands of people, both military and 
  
        civilian.  Most of those people I consider as 
  
        friends.
 
         </p><p>My wife made several promotions through 
  
        the years as an Army civil servant.  She was 
  
        excited about where she worked, who she worked for, 
  
        and the fact that she was doing her small part to 
  
        make the system work better.
 
         </p><p>On the day her world ended, Cheryle got up 
  
        at 3:00 a.m., got dressed, and drove herself to 
  
        work at 4:30.  My last recollection of her was 
  
        standing in our bedroom combing her hair.  We said 
  
        good-bye and I told her I would call her later to
 
        see if she wanted to come home early.  This was one 
  
        of those days when her illnesses made her very 
  
        sick, but being sick never stopped her from work,  
  
        from her duty. 
  
         </p><p>I followed her to work about a half hour 
  
        later.  This was our normal schedule for almost 15 
  
        years.  And although I was on leave, I went to work
 
        anyway.  The belief was, year-end use-or-lose type 
  
        of leave in the military, but that did not mean I 
  
        did not do my job.  And I credit my wife, Cheryle, 
  
        with showing me that side of the work ethic. 
  
         </p><p>I called Cheryle at about 8:30.  She
 
        sounded like she was hurting.  In fact, she told me 
  
        her head was just pounding.  That meant usually 
  
        that her blood pressure was elevated, but true to 
  
        her form, she said no to going home at that time. 
  
        I told her I had been invited to participate in a
 
        meeting in Rosslyn and I should be back in the 
  
        early afternoon.  That was the last time I talked 
  
        to my wife.  I know I told her I loved her and for 
  
        that I'm ever so grateful. 
  
         </p><p>When the plane hit the Pentagon an hour
 
        later, I felt the shudder two miles away in 
  
        Rosslyn.  When I looked out the window and saw the 
  
        first plume of smoke go up, I simultaneously heard  
  
        the TV announcer in a back room say that the south 
  
        parking lot of the Pentagon had been hit by an 
  
        airplane. 
  
         </p><p>My heart stopped because I just knew that
 
        was where Cheryle worked and something told me she 
  
        was in danger.  I ran the two miles back to the 
  
        Pentagon, through Arlington Cemetery.  I spent that 
  
        entire day, until 11:30 that night, working, 
  
        praying, and hoping at the side of the building we
 
        called home.  It was not until the next morning 
  
        that I got the official word from the Army that my 
  
        wife Cheryle, my bride of almost 25 years, was on 
  
        the missing list. 
  
         </p><p>That is what happened to Cheryle and 183
 
        others that day.  What has happened to the families 
  
        and friends since that day is another story.  I 
  
        like to think of 9/11 as an event and what we do 
  
        now as the journey after the event.  Every once in 
  
        awhile, someone or something will take us back to
 
        that day.  Those are the triggers from the event. 
  
        We hope that as time goes by, the triggers become 
  
        less in frequency and their results less in depth.  
  
         </p><p>This is the reason I said yes to coming 
  
        before you today.  What you do here, the results 
  
        you obtain and the recommendations you send 
  
        forward, will, I sincerely hope, lessen those
 
        triggers for all of us. 
  
         </p><p>I found early on in my grieving process 
  
        that to hold onto anger brought on resentment.  And 
  
        with resentment came sleepless nights, foggy days, 
  
        and bad memories.  So you won't hear anger from me.
 
        I won't talk about what people should have done, 
  
        for that would be to try to place blame somewhere. 
  
        That may be part of what you end up doing, but it 
  
        is not part of my responsibility. 
  
         </p><p>I will however, give you some personal
 
        observations. 
  
         </p><p>I watched that day as everyone with any 
  
        authority tried to take charge of something, take 
  
        charge of anything, but no one was really in 
  
        charge.  No matter how many times the scenario of a
 
        plane crashing into the Pentagon during takeoff or 
  
        landing at National Airport had been practiced, 
  
        no one was prepared for this attack.  
  
         </p><p>I know many of these in the Defense Protective 
  
        Service and there's not one of them that I would 
  
        fault for not doing their job and then some that 
  
        day.  I know many of the building support personnel
 
        and they too are above reproach and blame.  I've 
  
        worked for many of the top-level and mid-level 
  
        managers of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine 
  
        Corps.  Each one of them and their subordinates did 
  
        what their training and their instincts directed
 
        them to do.  Some of them died trying. 
  
         </p><p>If there is anything to blame, it is our 
  
        systems, our bureaucracies and our inflexibility 
  
        towards change.  That is normal for bureaucracies 
  
        and large systems.  That is what happened on 9/11.
 
        Those who are used to change, are trained to 
  
        respond to events demanding instant change, are the 
  
        police, fire and rescue.  Bureaucrats do not like 
  
        change, in fact they fear it, for their programs 
  
        may go away and with it their very existence.
 
         </p><p>So when these same bureaucrats tried to 
  
        respond to 9/11 events, they were not prepared for 
  
        it, but we should not blame them for that because  
  
        we may have made them what they are.  We do this 
  
        with our antiquated programming, budgeting and 
  
        execution methods.  We do this by outsourcing 
  
        almost everything we do until we make our
 
        government managers policy makers rather than 
  
        decision makers. 
  
         </p><p>We cannot fault our fine nonprofit 
  
        organizations and the multitude of companies that 
  
        responded to the needs starting within many hours
 
        of the tragedy.  These people brought everything 
  
        they could think of, provided every service they 
  
        could, and extended themselves, usually at a loss 
  
        of profit.  But within months of the event, the 
  
        attitude of these same people, not all of them to
 
        be sure, but a lot of them, went back to the way 
  
        they had been before 9/11.  They did what so many 
  
        of our own citizens did.  They reverted to what was 
  
        comfortable and known.  This is one of the prime 
  
        laws of systems thinking, which I happen to have a
 
        doctorate in, that tells us that a system always 
  
        reverts to where it is comfortable.  That's where 
  
        bureaucracies go, back to being comfortable.  
  
         </p><p>Some of the organizations that responded 
  
        had gone through similar incidents and responses 
  
        like this before.  Some of them already had 
  
        response models they could modify quickly.  But the
 
        vast majority of responders did not have a clue 
  
        because this was so much bigger, so much different 
  
        than anything they had ever seen before.  And now 
  
        almost a year and a half has gone by and we still 
  
        don't have any more models of crisis response than
 
        we had before. 
  
         </p><p>I'm certain that some bureaucrats have 
  
        probably worked on a few of those and spent several millions 
  
        of dollars of public funds to try to get a model 
  
        going, but I suspect that when push comes to shove,
 
        God forbid, those models will have become 
  
        shelfware.  For until our bureaucracies start to 
  
        train themselves on how to change, on how to be 
  
        flexible and pliable, they will never be in a 
  
        position to respond properly to events such as
 
        9/11. 
  
         </p><p>I trust that what you do here will be 
  
        guided by finding answers, not placing blame.  I  
  
        trust that you will search out the truth, no matter 
  
        where it leads, and pass that truth to those who 
  
        can make changes that matter.  I trust that you 
  
        will do the next right thing.
 
         </p><p>As you call your witnesses and try to find 
  
        out what happened and why, please try to remember 
  
        that those who were at the sites that day, those 
  
        who lost loved ones and friends, those who were 
  
        injured, are still going through their private and
 
        individualized trauma and grief processes.  Some 
  
        may be angry, many may be depressed, some may be 
  
        distraught and others may have their own agendas. 
  
        Try to understand that each of these people will 
  
        try to do their best given the circumstances that
 
        befell them. 
  
         </p><p>You are now part of their healing process. 
  
        I know you will do right by them and right by our 
  
        great country, the United States of America. 
  
         </p><p>Thank you once again for the honor of
 
        being here, and God bless. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you all very much. 
  
        You're an extraordinary group of people.  And I  
  
        thank you all so much for being here today. 
  
        Senator Gorton has a question. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORTON:  Mr. Waizer, was 
  
        there anyone else on that elevator?
 
         </p><p>MR. WAIZER:  There was another woman, a 
  
        black, middle-aged woman, who I have tried to 
  
        identify.  I think I know who she was.  And if it's 
  
        who I think it was, she died in the hospital.  She 
  
        didn't make it down to another ambulance.  But I
 
        have never be able to confirm that. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORTON:  I was going to have 
  
        a question for Mr. Lim, Mr. Chairman, but he 
  
        answered it.  He went back to work.  And I just 
  
        wanted to say that that was a great thing to do.
 
        You really deserve our admiration, not only for 
  
        what you did on that day but you're back to work 
  
        right now. 
  
         </p><p>MR. LIM:  There's a great need for 
  
        bomb-dog handlers right now.
 
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you.  Any other 
  
        questions from the Commission? 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  I'd just like to  
  
        make a comment.  When we were deciding what to do 
  
        for our first hearing, we considered many different 
  
        alternatives.  And clearly we wanted to hear from 
  
        the families of the victims.  We also wanted to
 
        hear firsthand from people who had experienced the 
  
        tragedy themselves for two reasons. One, we knew it 
  
        would motivate us.  And it has.  We will 
  
        collectively keep your stories with us as we go on 
  
        this journey.  And two, you have given us some
 
        challenges to live up to.  As you said, you are 
  
        speaking for so many others.  And we have heard 
  
        you.  Thank you. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Yes, Senator? 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER CLELAND:  Mr. Chairman, come
 
        April 8th, I will celebrate 35 years after my 
  
        tremendous trauma and challenges, grieving all 
  
        that, physical loss and pain and suffering. 
  
         </p><p>And this is an extraordinary story.  The 
  
        nation needed to hear it.  We needed to hear it.
 
        We love you.  We appreciate you.  And we hope that 
  
        God continues to strengthen you in your struggle. 
  
        Thank you.  
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much.  The 
  
        next panel, Stephen Push, Mary Fetchet, Mindy 
  
        Kleinberg, Allison Vadhan. 
  
         </p><p>(Recess)
 
 </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  We will call the session 
  
        back to order.  I'd like to introduce, first of 
  
        all, Stephen Push from the Families of September 
  
        11. 
  
         </p><p>MR. PUSH:  Governor Kean, Congressman
 
        Hamilton, and the other members of the Commission, 
  
        thank you for inviting me to offer my views about 
  
        the Commission as it starts its investigation of 
  
        the worst terrorist attack in American history. 
  
        And thank you all for taking on this assignment.
 
        You're doing a tremendous service for your country. 
  
         </p><p>You have an extremely important task 
  
        before you.  What is at stake is nothing less than 
  
        the legitimacy of the United States government. 
  
        The primary function of government is to provide
 
        for the common defense.  If the government cannot 
  
        do that effectively, everything else it does is of 
  
        little value.  
  
         </p><p>I would like to explain to you what it was 
  
        that brought me before you today.  I don't claim to 
  
        speak for all the 9/11 families, but I believe that 
  
        many of them have similar views concerning the need
 
        for this Commission. 
  
         </p><p>When my wife, Lisa Raines, was murdered 
  
        aboard American Airlines Flight 77, I was 
  
        immediately cast into a spiral of shock, disbelief, 
  
        and grief.  Within two weeks, however, my strongest
 
        emotion was anger.  And I think I probably differ 
  
        substantially from Mr. Waizer and Dr. Sincock in 
  
        that.  In fact, actually, anger is an inadequate 
  
        word to describe what I felt.  What I felt was a 
  
        rage so intense it was like no emotion I had ever
 
        felt before.  But I haven't let go of this anger. 
  
        I've tried to pour it into working to see that 
  
        something like this never happens again. 
  
         </p><p>Initially my rage was directed at the 
  
        hijackers.  Why did they do this?  What did they
 
        expect to accomplish?  What had Lisa done to them? 
  
        But as I read the newspapers and spent night after 
  
        sleepless night watching cable news networks and  
  
        searching books and the Web for information about 
  
        terrorism, I also became angry at my government, 
  
        the government that was supposed to protect Lisa 
  
        but that, as I eventually learned, had failed her
 
        and the other 3,000-plus victims of 9/11. 
  
         </p><p>I learned, for instance, that two of the 
  
        hijackers on Lisa's plane were known to the CIA. 
  
        In fact, the CIA even knew that one of them had a 
  
        multiple-entry visa to come into the country.  They
 
        knew that they were associated, I found out a 
  
        little later on that they were associated with the 
  
        people who bombed the Cole, the USS Cole, knew that 
  
        they had attended a terrorism conference in Kuala 
  
        Lumpur.  Nevertheless, they were allowed to enter
 
        the country, to live here for months and to board 
  
        the plane using their own names. 
  
         </p><p>I also learned that, for 14 years prior to 
  
        9/11, the Government Accounting Office repeatedly 
  
        documented the ineffectiveness of the aviation
 
        security system, but during that 14-year period, 
  
        nothing was done to correct the problems. 
  
         </p><p>I realized that al Qaeda had first  
  
        attacked America in 1993, declared war on America a 
  
        few years later, and mounted a series of 
  
        increasingly daring and deadly attacks.  While all 
  
        of this was happening, the Clinton administration
 
        took only ineffectual steps against al Qaeda.  And 
  
        after all of these clear signs that we were at war 
  
        with a ruthless enemy, the new Bush administration 
  
        put counterterrorism on the back burner until 
  
        September 11th.
 
         </p><p>I am now convinced that this tragedy did 
  
        not have to happen.  9/11 was foreseeable.  And it 
  
        could have been prevented.  But even if you don't 
  
        accept my word on that, I think everyone must admit 
  
        that at the very least 9/11 exposed serious
 
        problems with our counterterrorism and 
  
        national-security procedures. 
  
         </p><p>I'm not advocating conspiracy theories.  I 
  
        personally don't believe that anyone in the 
  
        government had specific knowledge of what would
 
        happen on 9/11.  If only it were that simple, we 
  
        could then easily correct the problem by 
  
        investigating and punishing those responsible.  
  
         </p><p>But I fear that what we're up against is 
  
        far more insidious.  There has been a failure of 
  
        leadership in this country that cuts across decades 
  
        and political parties.  Too many politicians put
 
        reelection above national security.  Too many 
  
        government managers favor process over results and 
  
        careerism over service. 
  
         </p><p>I'm not maligning the many brave men and 
  
        women who protect us.  I have great respect and
 
        gratitude to those in the military and the 
  
        intelligence agencies and for the many others who 
  
        have dedicated their lives to public service, but 
  
        in too many cases, they have been poorly led. 
  
         </p><p>I'd like to make a comment about something
 
        that Mr. Ben-Veniste and one of the witnesses said 
  
        about not pointing fingers.  I think this 
  
        Commission should point fingers.  I'm not 
  
        suggesting that you find scapegoats, someone to 
  
        hang out to dry, but there were people, people in
 
        responsible positions, who failed us on 9/11.  They 
  
        didn't just fail us once;  9/11 occurred because 
  
        they were failing us over a long period of time.   
  
        Some of these people are still in responsible 
  
        positions in the government.  Perhaps they 
  
        shouldn't be.  And that's one of the things I think 
  
        you need to look at and think about.
 
         </p><p>I also hope that you will, in conducting 
  
        your investigation, talk to some of the rank and 
  
        file in the agencies that you will be looking at. 
  
        I notice that you have some people from the Fire 
  
        Department and the Police Department speaking
 
        tomorrow.  I don't know what level they're at, but 
  
        you should speak to some of the rank and file in 
  
        those departments and see if what the leaders
  
        are telling you squares with what the rank and file 
  
        are telling you.
 
         </p><p>The same goes for the federal agencies. 
  
        I'm in touch with a number of former and current 
  
        employees of the Federal Aviation Administration 
  
        and the new Transportation Security Administration 
  
        who have horror stories to tell about our aviation
 
        security.  And I'd like you to listen to them. 
  
        Maybe not everything they say is legitimate, but 
  
        there is a lot there for you to look at that  
  
        requires serious consideration. 
  
         </p><p>I'd also like to say something about what 
  
        Mr. Waizer said about these commissions coming to 
  
        naught in the end.  If I have anything to say about
 
        it, that's not going to happen.  Your report is not 
  
        the end of the process, it's the beginning. 
  
         </p><p>And I think I can speak for some of the 
  
        other families who are here today, we're not going 
  
        away.  We're going to see that your recommendations
 
        are translated into legislation, that the 
  
        legislation is translated into effective action by 
  
        the agencies. 
  
         </p><p>Since 9/11, there have been some important 
  
        successes in the war on terrorism.  Afghanistan has
 
        been liberated, al Qaeda has been disrupted, and 
  
        many of al Qaeda's leaders have been captured. 
  
         </p><p>But there have been far too many failures, 
  
        as well.  For example, despite the expensive and 
  
        highly publicized creation of the Transportation
 
        Security Administration, aviation security is still 
  
        little better than it was on 9/11. 
  
         </p><p>Just last month, an investigative  
  
        journalist was able to defeat the carry-on-bag 
  
        screening process at a major American airport 10 
  
        out of 10 times.  This is a year and a half after 
  
        9/11, months after the TSA has taken over
 
        responsibility for all the airports, an 
  
        investigative journalist can carry unallowed items 
  
        through security a hundred percent of the time at a 
  
        major American airport. 
  
         </p><p>And this is not just one incident.  I just
 
        mentioned this one because it happened long after 
  
        TSA had taken over.  But I just this weekend 
  
        watched a compilation tape of stories that were 
  
        done by national and local television stations over 
  
        the period starting before 9/11 and continuing
 
        throughout the period when TSA was training and 
  
        hiring and taking over, right up until last month. 
  
        And in every single one of those instances, they 
  
        were able to defeat the system between 50 and 100 
  
        percent of the time.  I will provide you with a
 
        copy of that tape.  It's sickening. 
  
         </p><p>The TSA's response to this latest story, 
  
        to this latest appalling failure rate, was to  
  
        assert that "proper screening procedures were 
  
        followed."  I'm sure the families of the next 
  
        hijack victims will take great comfort in knowing 
  
        that "procedures were followed."
 
         </p><p>These ineffectual reforms of 
  
        transportation security focus almost exclusively on 
  
        addressing past attacks.  And this seems to be a 
  
        recurring theme in the government.  Let's respond 
  
        to the last attack.  Richard Reid uses a shoe bomb,
 
        so let's check everybody's shoes.  Well, the 
  
        terrorists are probably a little smarter than that 
  
        and probably the next time it's not going to be 
  
        shoes. 
  
         </p><p>But most of what's been done by the TSA so
 
        far responds to the threats that became evident on 
  
        9/11 and the Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie. 
  
        Little has been done to address other 
  
        aviation-security issues, and these issues are well 
  
        known.  Little has been done to address threats to
 
        other modes of transportation. 
  
         </p><p>We have to do much more than prevent a 
  
        repeat of prior terrorist attacks.  We need people  
  
        in government who know how to anticipate new 
  
        tactics and develop methods to defeat them.  Even 
  
        more important, we need to understand and change 
  
        the causes of terrorism.  This will require a major
 
        change in the government's mindset. 
  
         </p><p>I urge you to look beyond al Qaeda and 
  
        beyond 9/11 and examine the underlying problems 
  
        that this country has not fully faced and has done 
  
        little to address.  I urge you to ask the tough
 
        questions and offer tough solutions. 
  
         </p><p>For example, what changes need to be made 
  
        in our foreign policy, including -- no, not 
  
        including -- especially in our relations with 
  
        so-called friends such as Saudi Arabia?
 
         </p><p>Does the new Department of Homeland 
  
        Security really make America safer or has the 
  
        government just reshuffled the boxes on the 
  
        organizational chart? 
  
         </p><p>Can we obtain useful counterterrorism
 
        intelligence from an intelligence community made up 
  
        of 14 different agencies when no one is in charge 
  
        of the entire operation?  
  
         </p><p>Can the FBI, an agency steeped in a 
  
        law-enforcement culture transform itself into a 
  
        counterterrorism agency, or do we need to create an 
  
        agency similar to Britain's MI-5?
 
         </p><p>Are political campaign contributions from 
  
        the airlines undermining Congressional oversight of 
  
        aviation security? 
  
         </p><p>These are just a few of the questions you 
  
        are going to need to answer.  The list of questions
 
        is too long for this brief testimony.  I know that 
  
        other 9/11 families and many other people have 
  
        provided you or can provide you with far more 
  
        comprehensive lists. 
  
         </p><p>The families, the 9/11 families, aren't
 
        asking these questions for our own benefit.  We 
  
        have already been irreparably damaged.  Our loved 
  
        ones have already paid the ultimate price.  We ask 
  
        these questions for all Americans, for all people 
  
        who may be the next victims of terrorism, for
 
        future generations. 
  
         </p><p>Thank you again for inviting me to 
  
        testify.  And good luck in your search for the  
  
        truth. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you.  Mary Fetchet, 
  
        who is from Voices of 9/11. 
  
         </p><p>MS. FETCHET:  Good afternoon.  My name is
 
        Mary Fetchet.  I tragically lost my son Brad in the 
  
        most devastating attack on our country, the attacks 
  
        on the World Trade Center.  I am Co-Chair of Voices 
  
        of September 11th and a member of the family 
  
        steering committee for the 9/11 Independent
 
        Commission.  I'm honored to be here today and want 
  
        to thank Governor Kean, Mr. Hamilton, and all the 
  
        commissioners for the opportunity to discuss my 
  
        expectations for the 9/11 Commission. 
  
         </p><p>I want to express to all of you my very
 
        deep concern about the slow progress of the 
  
        Commission and stress the urgency we feel as 
  
        precious time is being wasted.  I also want to 
  
        impress on you the importance of the Commission's 
  
        investigation in answering our mounting questions.
 
         </p><p>Your investigation will help identify the 
  
        systemic problems within and amongst government 
  
        agencies that contributed to the success of the  
  
        terrorists in carrying out this horrific attack on 
  
        our country. 
  
         </p><p>It will also set a framework for the 
  
        necessary changes to insure national security.  The
 
        responsibility of the success of this investigation 
  
        rests on your shoulders.  We have waited far too 
  
        long for this Commission to get up and running. 
  
         </p><p>As a mother who lost her child, it is my 
  
        moral obligation to speak on behalf of my son and
 
        all those that died on September 11th.  They 
  
        deserve answers to how and why they were 
  
        senselessly murdered in their own country, nearly 
  
        3,000 innocent citizens at work and traveling on 
  
        American aircraft.  I also speak on behalf of my
 
        family and other families who are searching for 
  
        answers to how and why their loved ones died on 
  
        September 11th.  We deserve answers to the long 
  
        list of questions we have. 
  
         </p><p>Most importantly, I am here as a citizen,
 
        like you and the rest of the nation, who continues 
  
        to feel unprotected at these volatile times.  For 
  
        the sake of our children, we feel a great sense of  
  
        urgency.  What were the failures?  Who was 
  
        accountable? 
  
         </p><p>As I speak about my son, I would like to 
  
        share with you a picture which I took this morning
 
        from his 15-year-old brother's bedroom.  Brad was 
  
        24 years' old and the oldest of our three sons.  He 
  
        worked at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods as an equity 
  
        trader on the 89th floor of Tower 2.  Brad was an 
  
        understated, athletic, handsome young man, as you
 
        can see from the picture, with a sparkle in his 
  
        eyes and a wonderful smile.  Much like the 3,000 
  
        other innocent victims, he was hard working and 
  
        dedicated to his family and friends. 
  
         </p><p>Brad was planning to become engaged to his
 
        girlfriend of three years, Brooke.  When Brad died, 
  
        my husband and I lost a son and our dreams for his 
  
        future, a wedding, a daughter-in-law and 
  
        grandchildren.  His younger brothers have lost a 
  
        friend, a coach, a mentor, a confidant and a
 
        companion. 
  
         </p><p>It is incomprehensible that the 
  
        devastation was so great that our families are  
  
        being notified of minute body parts, such as a 
  
        finger, a jaw or a vertebra, or worse, nothing at 
  
        all.  We have been notified three times of Brad's 
  
        limited remains and have had a memorial service and
 
        a burial.  We will wait until the notification 
  
        process ends before we have a final burial.  It may 
  
        continue for years. 
  
         </p><p>On September 11th, Brad called my husband 
  
        at work shortly after the first plane hit Tower 1.
 
        Like other times when there was an emergency in the 
  
        building, he wanted to reassure us that he was 
  
        okay.  He was shaken because he had seen someone, 
  
        quote, "drop from the 91st floor, all the way 
  
        down."  He knew a plane hit Tower 1, but wasn't
 
        aware it was a commercial jet. 
  
         </p><p>The Port Authority directed my son's 
  
        company to stay put in their office, quote, "that 
  
        the building is safe and secure."  My husband asked 
  
        Brad to call me at home and here's the recording of
 
        his call left on my message machine at home around 
  
        9 o'clock a.m.: 
  
         </p><p>"Hey Mom, it's Brad.  I just wanted to  
  
        call and let you know, I'm sure that you've heard, 
  
        or maybe you haven't heard, that a plane crashed 
  
        into World Trade Center One.  We're fine, we're in 
  
        World Trade Center Two.  I'm obviously alive and
 
        well over here, but it's obviously a pretty scary 
  
        experience.  I saw a guy fall out of probably the 
  
        91st story all the way down.  So you're welcome to 
  
        give a call here.  I think we'll be here all day. 
  
        I'm not sure if the firm is going to shut down for
 
        the day or what.  Give me a call back later.  I 
  
        called Dad to let him know.  Love you." 
  
         </p><p>Brad always tried to be strong so I would 
  
        not worry.  Although he wasn't aware his life was 
  
        in danger, I can hear the fear in his voice.  I
 
        never had the opportunity to return his call, to 
  
        say good-bye and tell him I love him. 
  
         </p><p>Brad made two calls to his girlfriend, the 
  
        last after the second plane hit Tower 2.  The 
  
        message was brief.  Sirens were sounding in the
 
        background and he was franticly trying to escape 
  
        the building.  Other families received similar 
  
        calls from their loved ones after the building was  
  
        hit. 
  
         </p><p>These individuals knew they were going to 
  
        die.  They were trapped above the fire, asphyxiated 
  
        or injured, and unable to escape.  They died a
 
        horrendous death. 
  
         </p><p>So I ask you, if the house next door to 
  
        your home was hit by a plane or on fire, would you 
  
        direct your family to remain in your home?  How is 
  
        it that people would be directed to remain in a
 
        110-story building supposedly, quote, "safe and 
  
        secure," when its twin tower is billowing in smoke, 
  
        and people are jumping to their death to avoid a 
  
        high-rise fire?  How is it is that Brad was unaware 
  
        of the dangerous situation he was in 15 minutes
 
        after the first plane hit Tower 1?  Precious time 
  
        was wasted. 
  
         </p><p>Unlike Brad's situation, Rick Rescorla, 
  
        Director of Security for Morgan Stanley, directed 
  
        his employees to leave the building, to disregard
 
        the Port Authority's commands to evacuees to, 
  
        quote, "return up to their offices." 
  
         </p><p>How is it that they were receiving such  
  
        conflicting information which ultimately, 
  
        senselessly, cost my son's life and the lives of 
  
        600 others in Building 2?  What lessons were 
  
        learned after the bombing in 1993?  Were there
 
        evacuation policies in place?  Were they followed? 
  
        No one in Building 2 should be dead today.  What 
  
        were the failures and who is accountable? 
  
         </p><p>Furthermore, what communications existed 
  
        to warn city authorities and the Port Authority
 
        that hijacked commercial aircraft appeared headed 
  
        for their targets?  More specifically, what was New 
  
        York City and the Port Authority told about the 
  
        findings of the Joint FBI and NYPD Terrorist Task 
  
        Force?
 
         </p><p>What were the breakdowns in communication 
  
        between the control towers, the FAA, NORAD, and 
  
        other government agencies?  On a larger scale, what 
  
        were the CIA, the FBI, the INS and the military 
  
        doing to protect our country?  What were the
 
        systemic failures?  Who should be held accountable? 
  
         </p><p>September 11th has repeatedly been 
  
        referred to as a wake-up call.  Our president said  
  
        on September 27, 2001, "We have awakened to a new 
  
        danger, but our resolve is great." As late as May 
  
        16, 2002, Condoleeza Rice stated that, "I don't 
  
        think anybody could have predicted that these
 
        people would take an airplane and slam it into the 
  
        World Trade Center, take another one and slam it 
  
        into the Pentagon; that they would try to use an 
  
        airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a 
  
        missile."
 
         </p><p>But September 11th should not have been a 
  
        wake-up call.  Nor was it a new danger.  September 
  
        11th should have been predictable.  The loss of 
  
        life in the 1993 bombing and the continued threats, 
  
        specifically on the World Trade Center and other
 
        New York City landmarks, should have been the 
  
        wake-up call. 
  
         </p><p>In fact, Eleanor Hill from the Joint 
  
        Intelligence Committee concludes, "There was 
  
        considerable historical evidence that international
 
        terrorists had planned and were, in fact, capable 
  
        of conducting major terrorist strikes within the 
  
        United States."  
  
         </p><p>Despite increased chatter and the CIA 
  
        Director, George Tenet, issuing a declaration of 
  
        war on al Qaeda on December 4, 1998, the FBI and 
  
        CIA failed to communicate or coordinate their
 
        efforts in providing national security.  How could 
  
        this be that the two intelligence agencies 
  
        responsible for our safety are not coordinating 
  
        their efforts to protect our citizens?  How could 
  
        this happen and who is accountable?
 
         </p><p>The Hart-Rudman Commission released on 
  
        February 2001 also predicted a terrorist attack of 
  
        great magnitude and loss of life on our own soil. 
  
        This report both identified the increasing threat 
  
        of terrorism and was also a blueprint for the
 
        development of homeland security, which, if 
  
        implemented, could have prevented September 11th. 
  
        However, their recommendations to address these 
  
        threats were never implemented.  The report sat on 
  
        a shelf.
 
         </p><p>It is also important to note that two 
  
        earlier presidential commissions on airline safety, 
  
        security and antiterrorism were established  
  
        following airline disasters, the Pan Am Flight 103 
  
        and the TWA Flight 800.  However, these commissions 
  
        were bogged down by lobbying from the aviation 
  
        industry.  Timetables were delayed, and financial
 
        expenditures were given priority over the safety of 
  
        human lives. 
  
         </p><p>During this time what steps did the 
  
        aviation community take amidst the growing threat, 
  
        one which centered on using aircraft as bombs and
 
        American cities as targets?  If an effective 
  
        security system was in place, how did box cutters 
  
        get through security?  What were the failures and 
  
        who is accountable? 
  
         </p><p>Thankfully, we live in a country with
 
        freedom of speech.  Yet our elected officials with 
  
        oversight have neglected to implement prior 
  
        commissions' important recommendations to improve 
  
        airline and national security.  We have a strong 
  
        military support, yet they were not able to protect
 
        us within our own borders. 
  
         </p><p>We have sophisticated intelligence 
  
        agencies that, for reasons unknown to the public,  
  
        are territorial and have been proven to be 
  
        ineffective, at least as far as protecting American 
  
        lives.  Our nation is technologically advanced, yet 
  
        the technology is not protecting the skyways of
 
        America. 
  
         </p><p>Before September 11th, I assumed we were 
  
        safe and secure living in the United States, that 
  
        the threat of terrorism was outside our country, 
  
        that government officials and other agencies were
 
        competent, responsible individuals, coordinating 
  
        their efforts and acting in our best interests.  I 
  
        found out the hard way that I was naive, that my 
  
        assumptions were wrong. 
  
         </p><p>Unfortunately, the threat of terrorism
 
        exists in our country.  The building that Brad 
  
        worked in was unsafe and an identified target.  And 
  
        government agencies with the responsibility to 
  
        protect us have major systemic problems 
  
        communicating.
 
         </p><p>For 18 months our family has been denied 
  
        the truth that a thorough investigation would 
  
        reveal.  As a family member, I am frustrated to  
  
        have suffered the loss of a son and yet to be 
  
        required to spend time away from my family and 
  
        fight for the establishment of a commission that 
  
        should have been in place on the day of the tragic
 
        events. 
  
         </p><p>Following a recent mining disaster and 
  
        tragic Columbian aircraft explosion, commissions 
  
        were established immediately, with substantial 
  
        funding.  It is now 18 months later.  We're at war
 
        with heightened alert.  Yet the Commission has had 
  
        a slow start.  A quest for the truth has to begin 
  
        at the top, with the support of the administration, 
  
        to require all government agencies to provide 
  
        necessary documents and act in full cooperation
 
        with the Commission. 
  
         </p><p>Security for all Commissioners and staff 
  
        should be expedited.  Necessary funds should be 
  
        allocated for a Commission of this magnitude.  The 
  
        findings of this Commission are of utmost
 
        importance to developing an effective Homeland 
  
        Security Department. 
  
         </p><p>I found a journal my son began writing at  
  
        age 21.  On the first page he wrote a quote which 
  
        best describes how he lived his life: "You can tell 
  
        the character of a man by what he does for the man 
  
        who can offer him nothing."
 
         </p><p>I challenge you, the Commissioners, the 
  
        staff, and all those involved with the success of 
  
        this Commission to approach this important inquiry 
  
        with the same manner that Brad approached life, to 
  
        approach it with an open mind and with integrity,
 
        above all, with a sense of urgency and a full 
  
        commitment to the time and energy that will be 
  
        necessary to do a complete and thorough job. 
  
         </p><p>It is your moral and legal obligation to 
  
        insure that no stone is unturned.  Most
 
        importantly, each Commissioner must recuse 
  
        themselves in areas that they have a conflict of 
  
        interest.  Our nation deserves this Commission to 
  
        be different.  We want to prevent other families 
  
        from suffering the loss we have had to endure.  We
 
        want you to answer our questions, identify systemic 
  
        failures, and resolve problems. 
  
         </p><p>Despite the cost, we want recommendations  
  
        that are implemented and we want accountability. 
  
        We want to know that changes are being made so our 
  
        families can feel safe living in this country. 
  
        Ultimately, you are accountable for the success of
 
        this Commission. 
  
         </p><p>In closing, I would like to offer my 
  
        sincerest condolences to the families of the brave 
  
        soldiers who perished in Iraq.  I understand their 
  
        grief.  May God bless my son and all those who died
 
        as a result of September 11th and may their spirit 
  
        grant you the strength and wisdom as you proceed 
  
        with this important contribution for the sake of 
  
        our nation.  Thank you. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much.
 
        Mindy Kleinberg from September 11th Advocates. 
  
         </p><p>MS. KLEINBERG:  My name is Mindy 
  
        Kleinberg.  My husband Alan, 39 years old, was 
  
        killed in the World Trade Center on September 11th, 
  
        2001.  As I testify here today about the 9/11
 
        attacks, I will begin by saying that my thoughts 
  
        are very much with the men and women who are 
  
        involved in armed conflict overseas and their  
  
        families who wait patiently for them to return. 
  
         </p><p>This war is being fought on two fronts, 
  
        overseas as well as here on our shores.  This means 
  
        that we are all soldiers in this fight against
 
        terrorism.  As the threat of terrorism mounts here 
  
        in the United States, the need to address the 
  
        failures of September 11th is more important than 
  
        ever.  It is an essential part of lessons learned. 
  
         </p><p>As such, this commission has an extremely
 
        important task before it.  I'm here today to ask 
  
        you, the Commissioners, to help us understand how 
  
        this could have happened.  Help us understand where 
  
        the breakdown was in our nation's defense 
  
        capabilities.
 
         </p><p>Where we were on the morning of September 
  
        11th.  On the morning of September 11th my 
  
        three-year-old son, Sam, and I walked Jacob, 10, 
  
        and Lauren, seven, to the bus stop at about 8:40 
  
        a.m.  It was the fourth day of a new school year
 
        and you could still feel everyone's excitement.  It 
  
        was such a beautiful day that Sam and I literally 
  
        skipped home, oblivious to what was happening in  
  
        New York. 
  
         </p><p>At around 8:55 I was confirming play-date 
  
        plans for Sam when a friend said, "I can't believe 
  
        what I'm watching on TV, a plane has just hit the
 
        World Trade Center."  For some reason it didn't 
  
        register with me until a few minutes later, I asked 
  
        her calmly, "What building did you say?  Oh, that's 
  
        Alan's building, I have to call you back." 
  
         </p><p>There was no answer when I tried to reach
 
        him at the office.  By now my house started filling 
  
        with people -- his mother, my parents, our sisters 
  
        and friends.  The seriousness of the situation was 
  
        beginning to register.  We spent the rest of the 
  
        day calling hospitals and the Red Cross and
 
        anyplace else we could think of to see if we could 
  
        find him.  I will never forget thinking all day 
  
        long, "How am I going to tell Jacob and Lauren that 
  
        their father was missing?" 
  
         </p><p>They came home to a house filled with
 
        people but no Daddy.  How were they going to be 
  
        able to wait calmly for his return?  What if he was 
  
        really hurt?  This was their hero, their king,  
  
        their best friend, their father.  The thoughts of 
  
        that day replay over and over in our heads, always 
  
        wishing for a different outcome. 
  
         </p><p>We are trying to learn to live with the
 
        pain.  We will never forget where we were or how we 
  
        felt on September 11th.  But where was our 
  
        government, its agencies and institutions prior to 
  
        and on the morning of September 11th? 
  
         </p><p>The theory of luck.  With regard to the
 
        9/11 attacks, it has been said that the 
  
        intelligence agencies have to be right 100 percent 
  
        of the time and the terrorists only have to get 
  
        lucky once.  This explanation for the devastating 
  
        attacks of September 11th, simple on its face, is
 
        wrong in its value, because the 9/11 terrorists 
  
        were not just lucky once, they were lucky over and 
  
        over again.  Allow me to illustrate. 
  
         </p><p>The SEC.  The terrorists' lucky streak 
  
        began the week before September 11th with the
 
        Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.  The 
  
        SEC, in concert with the United States intelligence 
  
        agencies, has sophisticated software programs that  
  
        are used in real time to watch both domestic and 
  
        overseas markets to seek out trends that may 
  
        indicate a present or future crime. 
  
         </p><p>In the week prior to September 11th both
 
        the SEC and U.S. intelligence agencies ignored one 
  
        major stock-market indicator, one that could have 
  
        yielded valuable information with regard to the 
  
        September 11th attacks.  On the Chicago Board 
  
        Options Exchange during the week before September
 
        11th, put options were purchased on American and 
  
        United Airlines, the two airlines involved in the 
  
        attacks.  The investors who placed these orders 
  
        were gambling that in the short term, the stock 
  
        prices of both airlines would plummet.
 
         </p><p>Never before on the Chicago Exchange were 
  
        such large amounts of United and American Airlines 
  
        options traded.  These investors netted a profit of 
  
        several million dollars after the September 11th 
  
        attacks.  Interestingly, the names of the investors
 
        remain undisclosed and the millions remain 
  
        unclaimed in the Chicago Exchange account. 
  
         </p><p>Why were these aberrant trades not  
  
        discovered prior to 9/11?  Who were the individuals 
  
        who placed these trades?  Have they been 
  
        investigated?  Who was responsible for monitoring 
  
        these activities?  Have those individuals been held
 
        responsible for their inaction? 
  
         </p><p>The INS.  Prior to 9/11, our United States 
  
        intelligence agencies should have stopped the 19 
  
        terrorists from entering this country for 
  
        intelligence reasons alone.  However, their failure
 
        to do so in 19 instances does not negate the luck 
  
        involved for the terrorists when it comes to their 
  
        visa applications and our Immigration and 
  
        Naturalization Service, or INS. 
  
         </p><p>With regard to the INS, the terrorists got
 
        lucky 15 individual times because 15 of the 19 
  
        hijackers' visas should have been unquestionably 
  
        denied. 
  
         </p><p>Most of the 19 hijackers were young, 
  
        unmarried, unemployed males.  They were, in short,
 
        the classic overstay candidates.  A seasoned former 
  
        Consular Officer stated in National Review 
  
        Magazine, "Single, idle young adults with no  
  
        specific destination in the United States rarely 
  
        get visas absent compelling circumstances." 
  
         </p><p>Yet these 19 young, single, unemployed, 
  
        "classic overstay candidates still received their
 
        visas."  I am holding in my hand some of the 
  
        applications of the terrorists who killed my 
  
        husband.  All of these forms are incomplete and 
  
        incorrect. 
  
         </p><p>Some of the terrorists listed their means
 
        of support as simply "student" failing to then list 
  
        the name and address of any school or institution. 
  
        Others, when asked about their means of support for 
  
        their stay in the United States wrote "myself" and 
  
        provided no further documentation.  Some of the
 
        terrorists listed their destination as simply 
  
        "hotel" or "California" or "New York".  One even 
  
        listed his destination as "no". 
  
         </p><p>Had the INS or the State Department 
  
        followed the law, at least 15 of the hijackers
 
        would have been denied visas and would not have 
  
        been in the United States on September 11, 2001. 
  
         </p><p>Help us to understand how something as  
  
        simple as reviewing forms for completeness could 
  
        have been missed at least 15 times.  How many more 
  
        lucky terrorists gained unfettered access into this 
  
        country?  With no one being held accountable, how
 
        do we know that this still isn't happening? 
  
         </p><p>On the morning of September 11th, the 
  
        terrorists' luck commenced with airline and airport 
  
        security.  When the 19 hijackers went to purchase 
  
        their tickets and to receive their boarding passes,
 
        nine were singled out and questioned through a 
  
        screening process.  Luckily for those nine 
  
        terrorists, they passed the screening process and 
  
        were allowed to continue on with their mission. 
  
         </p><p>But the terrorists' luck did not end at
 
        the ticket counter, it accompanied them through 
  
        airport security, as well, because how else would 
  
        the hijackers get specifically contraband items 
  
        such as box cutters, pepper spray, or, according to 
  
        one FAA executive summary, a gun, on those planes?
 
         </p><p>Finally, sadly for us, years of GAO 
  
        recommendations to secure cockpit doors were 
  
        ignored making it all too easy for the hijackers to  
  
        gain access to the flight controls and carry out 
  
        their suicide missions. 
  
         </p><p>The FAA and NORAD.  Prior to 9/11, FAA and 
  
        Department of Defense manuals gave clear,
 
        comprehensive instructions on how to handle 
  
        everything from minor emergencies to full-blown 
  
        hijackings.  These protocols were in place and were 
  
        practiced regularly for a good reason -- with 
  
        heavily trafficked airspace, airliners without
 
        radio and transponder contact are collisions 
  
        waiting to happen. 
  
         </p><p>These protocols dictate that in the event 
  
        of an emergency, the FAA is to notify NORAD.  Once 
  
        that notification takes place, it is then the
 
        responsibility of NORAD to scramble fighter jets to 
  
        intercept the errant plane.  It is a matter of 
  
        routine procedure for fighter jets to intercept 
  
        commercial airliners in order to regain contact 
  
        with the pilot.  In fact, between June 2000 and
 
        September 2001, fighter jets were scrambled 67 
  
        times. 
  
         </p><p>If that weren't enough protection, on  
  
        September 11th, NEADS, or the Northeast Air Defense 
  
        System department of NORAD, was several days into a 
  
        semi-annual exercise known as Vigilant Guardian. 
  
        This meant that our Northeast Air Defense System
 
        was fully staffed.  In short, key officers were 
  
        manning the operation battle center, fighter jets 
  
        were cocked, loaded, and carrying extra gas on 
  
        board.  Lucky for the terrorists none of that 
  
        mattered on September 11th.
 
         </p><p>Let me use Flight 11 as an example. 
  
        American Airlines Flight 11 departed Boston Logan 
  
        Airport at 7:45 a.m.  The last routine 
  
        communication between ground control and the plane 
  
        occurred at 8:13 a.m.  Between 8:13 and 8:20,
 
        Flight 11 became unresponsive to ground control. 
  
        Additionally, radar indicated that the plane had 
  
        deviated from its assigned path of flight.  Soon 
  
        thereafter, transponder contact was lost. 
  
         </p><p>Two Flight 11 airline attendants had
 
        separately called American Airlines reporting a 
  
        hijacking, the presence of weapons and the 
  
        inflictions of injuries upon passengers and crew.   
  
        At this point it would seem abundantly clear that 
  
        Flight 11 was an emergency. 
  
         </p><p>And yet, according to NORAD's official 
  
        timeline, NORAD was not contacted until 20 minutes
 
        later at 8:40 a.m.  Tragically, the fighter jets 
  
        were not deployed until 8:52 a.m., a full 32 
  
        minutes after loss of contact with Flight 11. 
  
         </p><p>Why was there a delay in the FAA notifying 
  
        NORAD?  Why was there a delay in NORAD's scrambling
 
        fighter jets?  How is this possible when NEADS was 
  
        fully staffed with planes at the ready, monitoring 
  
        our airspace? 
  
         </p><p>Flights 175, 77 and 93 all had this same 
  
        repeat pattern of delays in notification and delays
 
        in scrambling fighter jets, delays that are 
  
        unimaginable considering a plane had, by this time, 
  
        already hit the World Trade Center.  Even more 
  
        baffling for us is the fact that fighter jets were 
  
        not scrambled from the closest Air Force bases.
 
         </p><p>For example, for the flight that hit the 
  
        Pentagon, the jets were scrambled from Langley Air 
  
        Force, in Hampton, Virginia rather than Andrews Air  
  
        Force Base right outside D.C.  As a result, 
  
        Washington skies remained wholly unprotected on the 
  
        morning of September 11th. 
  
         </p><p>At 9:41 a.m., one hour and 21 minutes
 
        after the first plane was hijack confirmed by 
  
        NORAD, Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon.  The 
  
        fighter jets were still miles away.  Why? 
  
         </p><p>So the hijackers' luck had continued.  On 
  
        September 11th both the FAA and NORAD deviated from
 
        standard emergency operating procedures.  Who were 
  
        the people that delayed the notification?  Have 
  
        they been questioned? 
  
         </p><p>In addition, the interceptor planes or 
  
        fighter jets did not fly at their maximum speed.
 
        Had the belatedly scrambled fighter jets flown at 
  
        their maximum speed of engagement, they would have 
  
        reached New York City and the Pentagon within 
  
        moments of their deployment, intercepted the 
  
        hijacked airliners before they could have hit their
 
        targets, and undoubtedly saved lives. 
  
         </p><p>The leadership.  The acting Joint Chief of 
  
        Staff on September 11th was General Richard B.   
  
        Myers.  On the morning of September 11th, he was 
  
        having a routine meeting.  The acting Joint Chief 
  
        of Staff stated that he saw a TV report about a 
  
        plane hitting the World Trade Center but thought it
 
        was a small plane or something like that. 
  
         </p><p>So, he went ahead with his meeting. 
  
        "Meanwhile, the second World Trade Center was hit 
  
        by another jet.  Nobody informed us of that," 
  
        Myers said.  By the time he came out of this
 
        meeting, the Pentagon had been hit. 
  
         </p><p>Whose responsibility was it to relay this 
  
        emergency to the Joint Chief of Staff?  Have they 
  
        been held accountable for this error?  Surely this 
  
        represents a breakdown in protocol.
 
         </p><p>The Secretary of Defense was at his desk 
  
        doing paperwork when Flight 77 crashed into the 
  
        Pentagon.  As reported, Secretary Rumsfeld felt the 
  
        building shake, went outside, saw the damage and 
  
        started helping the injured onto stretchers.  After
 
        aiding the victims, the Secretary then went to the 
  
        War Room. 
  
         </p><p>How is it possible that the National  
  
        Military Command Center, located in the Pentagon 
  
        and in contact with law enforcement and air-traffic 
  
        controllers from 8:46 a.m., did not communicate to 
  
        the Secretary of Defense, also at the Pentagon,
 
        about the other hijacked planes, especially the one 
  
        headed to Washington?  How is it that the Secretary 
  
        of Defense could have remained at his desk until 
  
        the crash?  Whose responsibility is it to relay 
  
        emergency situations to him?
 
         </p><p>At 6:15 a.m. on the morning of September 
  
        11th, my husband Alan left for work.  He drove in 
  
        to New York City and was at his desk and working at 
  
        his NASDAQ security-trading position with Cantor 
  
        Fitzgerald, in Tower 1 of the World Trade Center,
 
        by 7:30 a.m. 
  
         </p><p>In contrast, on that morning President 
  
        Bush was scheduled to read to elementary-school 
  
        children.  Before the President walked into the 
  
        classroom, NORAD had sufficient information that
 
        the plane that hit the World Trade Center was 
  
        hijacked.  At that time they also had knowledge 
  
        that two other commercial airliners in the air were  
  
        also hijacked. 
  
         </p><p>It would seem that a national emergency 
  
        was in progress, yet the President was allowed to 
  
        enter a classroom full of young children and listen
 
        to students read. 
  
         </p><p>Why didn't the Secret Service inform him 
  
        of this national emergency?  When is the President 
  
        supposed to be notified of everything the agencies 
  
        know?  Why was the President permitted by the
 
        Secret Service to remain in the Sarasota elementary 
  
        school?  Was this Secret Service protocol? 
  
         </p><p>In the case of a national emergency, 
  
        seconds of indecision could cost thousands of 
  
        lives.  And it is precisely for that reason that
 
        our government has a whole network of adjuncts and 
  
        advisors to ensure that these top officials are 
  
        among the first to be informed and not the last. 
  
         </p><p>Where were these individuals who did not 
  
        properly inform these top officials?  Where was the
 
        breakdown in communication?  Was it luck?  Is it 
  
        luck that aberrant stock trades were not monitored? 
  
        Is it luck when 15 visas are awarded based on  
  
        incomplete forms?  Is it luck when airline security 
  
        screeners allow hijackers to board planes with box 
  
        cutters and pepper spray?  Is it luck when 
  
        emergency FAA and NORAD protocols are not followed?
 
        Is it luck when a national emergency is not 
  
        reported to top government officials on a timely 
  
        basis? 
  
         </p><p>To me luck is something that happens once. 
  
        When you have this repeated pattern of broken
 
        protocols, broken laws, broken communication, one 
  
        cannot still call it luck.  If at some point we 
  
        don't look to hold the individuals accountable for 
  
        not doing their jobs properly, then how can we ever 
  
        expect for terrorists to not get lucky again?
 
         </p><p>And that is why I'm here with all of you 
  
        today, because we must find the answers as to what 
  
        happened that day so as to ensure that another 
  
        September 11th can never happen again. 
  
         </p><p>Commissioners, I implore you to answer our
 
        questions.  You are the generals in the terrorism 
  
        fight on our shores.  In answering our questions, 
  
        you have the ability to make this nation a safer  
  
        place and, in turn, minimize the damage if there is 
  
        another terrorist attack.  And if there is another 
  
        attack, the next time our systems will be in place 
  
        and working and luck will not be an issue.  Thank
 
        you. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Is Allison Vadhan here 
  
        yet?  She's on the way and she has a statement and 
  
        we will put her on after the break. 
  
         </p><p>SPEAKER:  She's here now, she's right
 
        upstairs. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Here she is.  All right. 
  
        You picked your timing very well.  Are you all 
  
        right to go on right now? 
  
         </p><p>MS. VADHAN:  I'm all right, yes.
 
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Okay. 
  
         </p><p>MS. VADHAN:  Thank you.  I apologize. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much. 
  
        Allison Vadhan, Families of Flight 93. 
  
         </p><p>MS. VADHAN:  Members of the Commission,
 
        Mr. Kean, honored guests, my name is Allison Vadhan 
  
        and I lost my very young 65-year-old mother, 
  
        Kristin White Gould, on United Flight 93, the plane  
  
        that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania while the 
  
        passengers and crew tried to overcome the 
  
        hijackers. 
  
         </p><p>I'd like to thank the Commission for
 
        inviting me to speak today.  I've always had a 
  
        strong inner faith and I still believe that God 
  
        doesn't give us what we can't handle.  Being here 
  
        today and your hearing my voice and our voices in 
  
        place of our loved ones is a privilege.
 
         </p><p>My mother, a graduate from Cornell 
  
        University and a medical journalist, preferred to 
  
        spend her vacation time visiting ancient cities to 
  
        learn about ancient civilizations.  Before I knew 
  
        that she was flying that day, I had already
 
        witnessed the second tower of the World Trade 
  
        Center explode into an orange fireball and I saw 
  
        with my own eyes the great black mushroom cloud 
  
        rise above the New York City skyline, not far from 
  
        my own home.
 
         </p><p>I'm sure most Americans today remember the 
  
        sinking feeling when it was obvious that not only 
  
        the World Trade Center had come under terrorist  
  
        attacks but that there were other planes in trouble 
  
        -- along with fires and explosions in Washington. 
  
        And then there was news about a plane down in 
  
        Pennsylvania.  Before the day was over, we all knew
 
        that this was war. 
  
         </p><p>By the Christmas holidays, we faced the 
  
        anthrax attacks, the attempted bombing of the plane 
  
        from Paris to Miami, which was averted to Boston, 
  
        by Richard Reid, the discovery of an American, John
 
        Walker Lind, who was captured as a Taliban rebel in 
  
        Afghanistan.  How many other plans were there?  It 
  
        felt like each day could be the next day for an 
  
        attack. 
  
         </p><p>Most of us would turn on the TV first
 
        thing in the morning to see if the world had 
  
        changed overnight.  Finally, it seemed crystal 
  
        clear to citizens, as well as governments, that the 
  
        U.S. is a prized target for al Qaeda.  And this 
  
        could possibly happen again and again and again,
 
        whether they actually hit or just miss. 
  
         </p><p>I'm concerned not only about my own three 
  
        children and if the U.S. will be as strong as it  
  
        has been in the 20th century.  I'm also concerned 
  
        about what's already been taught to children in 
 
  
        Madrassa schools this year, last year, five years 
  
        ago.
 
         </p><p>Six days after my mother was killed, our 
  
        family traveled to Shanksville, Pennsylvania for 
  
        the memorial services for the families of Flight 
  
        93.  After the services I went back to my hotel 
  
        room for some quiet time and when I turned on the
 
        TV, a reporter in Pakistan was interviewing 8- and 
  
        10-year-old boys at school.  Their computer screen 
  
        savers bounced pictures of Osama bin Laden.  We 
  
        have discovered that there is another generation 
  
        being trained and raised to become terrorists when
 
        they grow up. 
  
         </p><p>I can tell you that forgetting and trying 
  
        to move on is a survival mechanism and it is part 
  
        of human nature.  The pain of trying to envision 
  
        what my mother might have been going through and
 
        experienced on that plane is so great that it's 
  
        almost only normal to try to forget about it and 
  
        think about something else.  But trying to forget  
  
        is an indulgence for any American who saw what we 
  
        saw. 
  
         </p><p>Al Qaeda and similar cells around the 
  
        world are training their young ones.  If Americans
 
        don't prepare for this next generation, we have 
  
        only ourselves in this room to hold accountable. 
  
         </p><p>I'm concerned about civil liberties as an 
  
        excuse for not taking action to prevent terrorism. 
  
        I'm concerned about how many untold cases there are
 
        of federal and local agencies not being able to 
  
        properly investigate a potential terrorist.  At the 
  
        time FBI investigators could not obtain a criminal 
  
        search warrant to inspect the laptop computer of 
  
        Zacharias Moussaoui because supervisors in
 
        Washington D.C. thought there was no probable 
  
        cause. 
  
         </p><p>Now that we know our laws for 
  
        investigating are outdated and no longer 
  
        appropriate, I'm concerned that we will choose not
 
        to fix them in the name of protecting civil 
  
        liberties, rather than protecting the lives of 
  
        American civilians.  
  
         </p><p>President Bush effectively made us aware 
  
        that we are fighting a new kind of war.  And if the 
  
        battlefield is here at home, waged by specific 
  
        groups from specific areas around the world, in the
 
        name of a specific religion, I'm concerned that 
  
        avoiding racial profiling will supersede preventing 
  
        further terrorism.  And the enemy knows this. 
  
         </p><p>Terrorism is similar to the guerilla 
  
        warfare we hear about going on in Iraq: Militants
 
        pose themselves as ordinary citizens and immigrants 
  
        here in the United States.  They appear so clean 
  
        cut, they could fit in on any golf course.  And 
  
        they do this to remain undetected until they carry 
  
        out their terrorist goals.  If we're lucky, they're
 
        dressed in their customary dress, they're wearing 
  
        their traditional non-Western clothing. 
  
         </p><p>As long as we allow groups to be protected 
  
        from racial profiling, how can we win this new war? 
  
        And after seeing those little boys in the Madrassa
 
        schools which are sponsored by Osama bin Laden and 
  
        the like, our children and grandchildren will, with 
  
        no uncertainly, face a very dangerous existence,  
  
        especially if we try to forget and move on. 
  
         </p><p>The people who died on September 11th were 
  
        the first casualties in this new war.  It is our 
  
        responsibility not to let them die in vain.  I hope
 
        we learn from our mistakes and prevent our children 
  
        from having to deal with the problems that their 
  
        parents and grandparents could have and should have 
  
        addressed with action and resolve. 
  
         </p><p>Thank you for inviting me and other
 
        families to speak today.  I believe that we all 
  
        share the same goal in making our country and our 
  
        world a safer place.  I hope the outcome of the 
  
        independent Commission is to learn from the past so 
  
        that history will not repeat itself.  Thank you.
 
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you all very much. 
  
        This is an extraordinary panel and you have given 
  
        us a tremendous charge.  I might say, in addition 
  
        to the fact of all the questions that you have 
  
        given us that we must answer to our satisfaction
 
        and the satisfaction of the American people, in 
  
        addition the families' group, I didn't realize this 
  
        was appointed somewhat late, but there wouldn't be  
  
        a Commission if it was not for the work of the 
  
        victims and the families.  And we're all very, very 
  
        aware of that. 
  
         </p><p>I also want to say, as Chairman, that
 
        every single time that this Commission has asked 
  
        the families to help in any way in the execution of 
  
        our mission, they have been there, from setting out 
  
        the mission to helping us get an adequate budget. 
  
         </p><p>I just want to say to you all, as
 
        representatives of the families, thank you very, 
  
        very much, and we look forward to working with you 
  
        in the future. 
  
         </p><p>At this point, if I could recognize 
  
        Senator Cleland.
 
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER CLELAND:  Thank you very 
  
        much, Mr. Chairman.  Miss Kleinberg has referred to 
  
        a meeting of the new Chairman 
  
        of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was having, at that 
  
        moment of 9/11. He was having that meeting with me.
 
        I was on the Armed Services Committee.  And we were 
  
        talking about America's defenses at the moment. 
  
         </p><p>My understanding of that is at the very  
  
        moment that we were talking about that, the aide, a 
  
        lieutenant colonel, was receiving a call from the 
  
        Pentagon.  Basically the message was, as I 
  
        understand it, New York hit, Washington next.
 
         </p><p>And that scared one of my secretaries so 
  
        badly about that moment that the Chairman and I 
  
        rolled in and watched the second plane hit.  And we 
  
        left the office immediately, but it was ironic that 
  
        we were talking about defending the country at that
 
        very moment.  I just wanted to add that for the 
  
        record. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you, Senator. 
  
        Senator Gorton? 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORTON:  Mr. Push, with the
 
        exception of some of your co-sufferers from this 
  
        tragedy, I doubt that anyone in the course of the 
  
        last 18 months has spent more time or thought on 
  
        this entire matter than you have. 
  
         </p><p>And in your written and oral testimony,
 
        you have several questions that you think it 
  
        necessary for us to answer.  I'd like to know 
  
        whether or not you have formed any tentative  
  
        answers to those questions that you'd like to share 
  
        with us.  And let me just do one of them. 
  
         </p><p>Do you have any strong and informed views 
  
        on whether or not the FBI can be an appropriate
 
        counterterrorism agency or whether or not we should 
  
        have a separate British-type MI-5? 
  
         </p><p>MR. PUSH:  It is my opinion that we should 
  
        have a separate MI-5 type of organization.  It
 
        appears to me that the whole culture of the FBI is 
  
        antithetical to the skills that are needed in 
  
        counterterrorism.  The reward system is geared 
  
        towards people who solve cases rather than prevent 
  
        terrorist attacks.
 
         </p><p>And I realize that the director of the FBI 
  
        is attempting to change that culture, but we 
  
        haven't got the luxury of time.  And I think we 
  
        should try a different model.  Would you like me to 
  
        mention my views on these others?
 
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORTON:  If you'd like to do 
  
        so.  I may comment. 
  
         </p><p>MR. PUSH:  Sure.  
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORTON:  I have a friend who 
  
        is a United States Attorney in one of the districts 
  
        in Washington who has said to me, not at all 
  
        facetiously, recently, that he can't get the FBI to
 
        investigate bank robberies anymore because they're 
  
        all looking for, spies and they may very 
  
        well be inconsistent charges. 
  
         </p><p>MR. PUSH:  As far as foreign policy, I 
  
        think we have to take, I realize that now that
 
        we're at war with Iraq is not the right moment to 
  
        reevaluate our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but 
  
        I think that we need to reevaluate our 
  
        relationships with the Middle East. 
  
         </p><p>I think too many governments, particularly
 
        Saudi Arabia, but I think this applies to other 
  
        Middle Eastern governments as well, who play a 
  
        double game, who pretend to be our allies while 
  
        secretly, or sometimes not so secretly, turning a 
  
        blind eye to their citizens, funding terrorism,
 
        even the governments themselves setting up 
  
        newspapers that are blatantly anti-American, 
  
        anti-Semitic, schools and mosques that provide  
  
        hatred and violence. 
  
         </p><p>And I think that we need to use the full 
  
        weight of our -- military action 
  
        like in Iraq will not always be appropriate, but I
 
        think we should use the full weight of our foreign 
  
        policy, whether it be diplomatic or through foreign 
  
        aid or whatever to pressure these governments to 
  
        change until -- I believe that we'll never be safe 
  
        from Islamic extremism until the Arab Muslim
 
        countries begin to experience democracy. 
  
         </p><p>In the case of the Homeland Security 
  
        Department, I believe that it was done more to 
  
        appease the American public than to make 
  
        fundamental change.  I think just
 
        throwing a lot of agencies together under a single 
  
        department in and of itself does not in itself 
  
        provide a more secure environment.  We really have 
  
        to rethink. And one of the things I've mentioned 
  
        about people who are still in responsible
 
        positions, it's my understanding that the managers 
  
        who are responsible for the poor performance of 
  
        aviation security under the FAA have been  
  
        transferred to responsible positions in the TSA 
  
        and/or to contractors who work for the TSA.  So we 
  
        changed the label it's operating under, we haven't 
  
        changed the fundamental problem.
 
         </p><p>In the case of the 14 agencies, I support 
  
        the recommendation of the Joint 9/11 Inquiry to 
  
        have a Director of National Intelligence.  I spent 
  
        most of my time in the private sector.  You would 
  
        never even dream in the private sector having 14
 
        different departments in a company doing the same 
  
        thing, and nobody is in charge. 
  
         </p><p>And as far as political campaign 
  
        contributions having an effect on aviation 
  
        security, I suspect they have.  The airlines have
 
        always gotten a pass from the government.  I know 
  
        that they make the case that they're absolutely 
  
        vital to the national interest, and I believe they 
  
        are, but I believe they're in trouble not because 
  
        of regulatory requirements but because of poor
 
        management. 
  
         </p><p>And I think that they have, they seem to 
  
        have plenty of money to spend on political campaign  
  
        contributions and on lawyers and they, before 9/11 
  
        and after 9/11, they seem to have successfully 
  
        evaded many of the requirements that the government 
  
        has tried to place on them.
 
         </p><p>And I think that, and this is a broader 
  
        issue, I'm picking on the airline industry because 
  
        they're the industry that I think had played a key 
  
        role in responsibility for 9/11, but this is just 
  
        the tip of the iceberg, I think, and maybe this is
 
        too broad for this Commission to get into, but I 
  
        think the whole political campaign contribution
  
        system in this country is warping the political 
  
        process.  And the problems with the airline 
  
        industry are just one example of it.
 
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER FIELDING:  Thank you, Mr. 
  
        Chairman.  Just a general statement, if I may, 
  
        thanking this panel.  Your stories are very 
  
        compelling, your advice is good and sound, and 
  
        obviously you have strengthened our resolve.
 
         </p><p>I know I speak for all of us, you're 
  
        obviously one of our best assets.  Please, stay 
  
        with us, please keep giving us guidance, please  
  
        keep us direct.  Thank you. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Senator Gorelick? 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  Yes, I might just 
  
        follow up on that.  I was very impressed with what
 
        both Mary Fetchet and Mindy Kleinberg had to say in 
  
        terms of the body of acknowledge that you have 
  
        brought to bear on this issue. 
  
         </p><p>And I was struck by the fact that 
  
        laypeople, with no powers of subpoena, with no
 
        access to inside information of any sort, could put 
  
        together a very powerful set of questions and set 
  
        of facts that are a roadmap for us.  And I would 
  
        just ask you to briefly describe by what process 
  
        you have developed the factual basis that you have
 
        laid before us today because it is really quite 
  
        striking. 
  
         </p><p>MS. KLEINBERG:  Hours and hours and hours 
  
        of reading articles, and you know, over the 
  
        Internet, we e-mailed each other articles.
 
        Somewhere in October we became obsessed with 
  
        everything that was September 11th. 
  
         </p><p>It started with, you know, any article  
  
        that had anything to do with September 11th we 
  
        started to pass back and forth.  And then, you 
  
        know, if they had something to do with let's say 
  
        INS, we started to look up information about the
 
        INS.  So it's literally 18 months of doing nothing 
  
        but grieving and reading. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  Thank you for the 
  
        reading part, motivated by the grieving, I'm sure. 
  
         </p><p>MS. FETCHET:  I think initially we were
 
        all just numb.  And we were like the general 
  
        public.  And I said to my friends, in fact, you 
  
        might read an article and say, gee, that's sort of 
  
        odd, they gave visas to the terrorists.  And you 
  
        know, that's unusual or that's, you know.
 
         </p><p>So I think that as we progressed, our 
  
        curiosity took over.  And we started reading and 
  
        really not only putting the articles together but 
  
        also connecting the dots.  And you see, I mean, 
  
        they had more than enough information to really, if
 
        not minimize, completely prevent this from 
  
        happening. 
  
         </p><p>And the problem is, these agencies are not  
  
        communicating.  They don't have protocol that they 
  
        have in place or they're not following it.  So it's 
  
        just, I think our curiosity took over and we 
  
        started drawing conclusions to reading this
 
        information. 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  Thank you. 
  
         </p><p>MS. FETCHET.  But we're turning it over to 
  
        you now because we're tired.  Now it's your job. 
  
         </p><p>MR. PUSH:  And we want to see lots of
 
        subpoenas. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Congressman Roemer? 
  
         </p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER:  Thank you, Mr. 
  
        Chairman. 
  
         </p><p>Having served in Congress and as a member
 
        of the Joint Inquiry, I cannot thank all of you 
  
        enough and the people in the audience enough for 
  
        your participation in making sure that the Joint 
  
        Inquiry continued to dig hard and dig deep and get 
  
        at the facts and put out the starting point for the
 
        Commission. 
  
         </p><p>Many of you could have taken your grief 
  
        and your sorrow and your pain and gone to the  
  
        sidelines.  Instead, just as we see today the 
  
        pictures out there of your wife or your son or your 
  
        loved one, you came to every single public hearing 
  
        that we had on the Joint Inquiry.
 
         </p><p>And the members of that Joint Inquiry 
  
        looked out in the audience and saw those faces 
  
        every single day.  And that had a huge impact on 
  
        that committee, that bipartisan committee of 
  
        Senators and Congressmen, trying to do their job
 
        harder and harder and more effectively every day. 
  
         </p><p>You were instrumental in the creation of 
  
        the Commission.  It would not have happened 
  
        legislatively, getting through the House and 
  
        Senate, if it had not been for you.  At a time when
 
        many Americans don't even take the opportunity to 
  
        cast a ballot, you folks went out and made the 
  
        legislative system work.  You can take great pride 
  
        in that. 
  
         </p><p>I hope you will stay involved in this
 
        Commission's work.  And I hope that you will stay 
  
        involved in helping us implement recommendations of 
  
        the Commission.  That will be one of the most  
  
        difficult parts we get to. 
  
         </p><p>And along those lines, Steve, if you want 
  
        to, I just want to ask you a very quick question. 
  
        Maybe you don't answer it today, maybe you answer
 
        it in six months.  And Steve, you may have 
  
        partially answered it, but maybe you can all take a 
  
        quick try at it. 
  
         </p><p>What two recommendations would you like to 
  
        see us pass at the end of the day to make the
 
        country a safer place against this fluid, dynamic, 
  
        very lethal threat of al Qaeda and terrorists? 
  
         </p><p>Steve, I will call on you first.  You may 
  
        have mentioned two of them, the creation of the 
  
        Director of National Intelligence and an MI-5.
 
         </p><p>MR. PUSH:  Yes, actually I think if I had 
  
        to pick only two, I would say the Director of 
  
        National Intelligence and a change in our 
  
        relationship to the Middle East, both.  I mentioned 
  
        Saudi Arabia, but also I think we have to reexamine
 
        our policy towards Israel, as well. 
  
         </p><p>I support Israel, but we've turned a blind 
  
        eye to the expansion of settlements in the West  
  
        Bank and all of these things are interconnected. 
  
        I'm not a blame-America-first advocate.  This was 
  
        the fault of the hijackers, and the hijackers were 
  
        the fault of a dysfunctional society in the Arab
 
        Muslim countries. 
  
         </p><p>Unfortunately, we can't just pin the blame 
  
        on them because they're killing us.  So we have to 
  
        do whatever we can, use whatever leverage we have 
  
        to force changes there that will stop them from
 
        continuing to create young people who hate us more 
  
        than they love life itself. 
  
         </p><p>We can build a wall around America, and we 
  
        will never be able to protect ourselves as long as 
  
        there are people like that in the world.
 
         </p><p>MS. FETCHET:  I think the two areas I 
  
        would like to see changes in would be the FBI and 
  
        the CIA working together.  To me it's inexcusable 
  
        that you have two agencies that are supposed to be 
  
        protecting our citizens.  And they have cultures
 
        and territorial wars and they're not communicating 
  
        or coordinating their efforts. 
  
         </p><p>I think the second thing is immigration.   
  
        I think we really do not know who is living in this 
  
        country.  I was amazed to hear -- the learning 
  
        curve for all of us has been beyond straight up -- 
  
        but when I sat in the Joint Intelligence hearings
 
        and I heard that the watch list only goes one way, 
  
        that doesn't make sense to me.  And I can't 
  
        understand how we're not monitoring people coming 
  
        and going.  So I think those are the two areas. 
  
         </p><p>And one other thing I'd like to include is
 
        just to mention how thankful we are for the work 
  
        that the Joint Intelligence Committee did.  They 
  
        really, worked hard.  I 
  
        would like you to follow some of their 
  
        recommendations.
 
         </p><p>They were very frustrated with people not 
  
        showing up for testimony, people not complying with 
  
        subpoenas, and so, I've forgotten who mentioned it 
  
        to us, but they said subpoena early and often, and 
  
        that's another recommendation that I would have, is
 
        make that list and get started. 
  
         </p><p>MS. KLEINBERG:  You know, I agree with 
  
        Mary and Steve.  I also think that there's a part  
  
        about accountability that we, as citizens, we can't 
  
        hold the Director of Central Intelligence 
  
        accountable or the people that work for him or the 
  
        FBI, we're not in charge of hiring or firing them.
 
         </p><p>And there's no way, there's no report 
  
        card, you know, it's a matter of national security. 
  
        So Congressional oversight becomes extremely 
  
        important.  And you know, our ability to, as 
  
        Americans, to get the story out so that we know
 
        who's accountable and we know that we could use our 
  
        votes to ensure this accountability.  That's one of 
  
        them. 
  
         </p><p>And the other is, I think there should be 
  
        full disclosure for public officials of any of
 
        their business interests.  You know, we have talked 
  
        a lot about conflicts on this Commission.  And you 
  
        know, the onus is on you to rise above those 
  
        conflicts. 
  
         </p><p>And I'm sure that you will be able to do
 
        that when it is this important of a job, but I 
  
        think, you know, it's another area that has to be 
  
        looked at that when we put people into office,  
  
        whether it's a Congressman or a Senator or a 
  
        President, we have to take a look at what their 
  
        business interests are so that there are no 
  
        conflicts there either.
 
         </p><p>MS. VADHAN:  Again, I'll just reiterate 
  
        what I have said in my statement.  I think we need 
  
        to take a good look at the laws, how we investigate 
  
        possible suspects, how we investigate, how we keep 
  
        track of immigrants, and also take a look at, take
 
        a good hard look at what we do know about September 
  
        11th and the people who were involved with 
  
        conspiring the terrorist attacks and finding out 
  
        why we decided to stop investigating or stop 
  
        following one of the hijackers in the middle of the
 
        year, right before September 11th, we just decided 
  
        to stop following him. 
  
         </p><p>We had been on his tail for over a year, 
  
        and for some unknown reason, we just don't know, we 
  
        decided to stop watching him.  And we didn't hear
 
        about him until he ended up on the plane, on Flight 
  
        93 that crashed in Pennsylvania. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Are there anymore  
  
        questions from the Commissioners?  If not, you are 
  
        extraordinary people.  Thank you so very much for 
  
        your testimony.  I believe we're running late, not 
  
        unexpectedly, but I would ask, therefore, if we
 
        could hold our break to 45 minutes.  Let's catch 
  
        our 15 minutes that way, if we could be back here 
  
        in 45 minutes.  Thank you all very much. 
  
         </p><p>(45-minute recess) 
  
 </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you all very, very
 
        much for coming.  I'd like to start by introducing 
  
        Dr. Sofaer, from Hoover Institution.  Institute, 
  
        right? 
  
         </p><p>DR. SOFAER:  Institution. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Institution.  It's
 
        Institution, all right.  Thank you very much, sir, 
  
        for coming here today. 
  
         </p><p>DR. SOFAER:  Delighted to be here, Mr. 
  
        Chairman.  It's a privilege, Mr. Chairman and 
  
        members of this Commission, to testify concerning
 
        the prevention of terrorist acts against the United 
  
        States.  My experience in this field is based on 
  
        service as a federal prosecutor with one of the  
  
        Commissioners here, Mr. Ben-Veniste, as a federal 
  
        judge, as legal advisor to the Department of State 
  
        and another Commissioner participated in making me 
  
        legal advisor, Fred Fielding, and as a scholar in
 
        the area of national security. 
  
         </p><p>And I am honored to say, Mr. Chairman, 
  
        that I serve with many in the federal government, 
  
        with many of the people who are sitting here as 
  
        Commissioners and I am privileged to be with you
 
        again. 
  
         </p><p>This Commission has the formidable task of 
  
        explaining the terrorist acts of September 11th and 
  
        providing recommendations help to prevent such 
  
        attacks in the future.  The cost of those attacks
 
        is staggering, as you know:  2,819 lives at the 
  
        World Trade Center, including 343 firefighters and 
  
        paramedics, 23 New York City policemen, 124 killed 
  
        at the Pentagon, 271 people who died in the crashes 
  
        of the airplanes involved and the economic
 
        consequences of it are tremendous and still haven't 
  
        been figured out.  We know that New York City, this 
  
        great city, lost 146,000 jobs.  
  
         </p><p>Those who were murdered on September 11th 
  
        remain in our minds and hearts.  We owe it to them 
  
        to ask ourselves, what are the lessons of their 
  
        terrible deaths, have we made the changes to permit
 
        us to say they did not die in vain. 
  
         </p><p>The long process of introspection began 
  
        immediately after the attacks and continues.  This 
  
        Commission will find no shortage of ideas as to how 
  
        America can defend itself more effectively,
 
        including better intelligence, reorganization of 
  
        agencies, enhanced technologies, better 
  
        diplomacy and accountability.  These are all 
  
        important subjects which the Commission must 
  
        address.
 
         </p><p>My testimony, Mr. Chairman, though, will 
  
        focus on what I regard as most significant, the 
  
        failure to use force to prevent the terrorist acts 
  
        of 9/11 from happening.  It is now the strategic 
  
        policy of the United States to use force
 
        preemptively to prevent terrorists and their 
  
        states' supporters from attacking this country. 
  
         </p><p>Until 9/11, however, the use of force was  
  
        not seriously pursued.  When President Clinton 
  
        promised to bring terrorists to justice, he meant 
  
        that he would investigate them, try to capture 
  
        them, and when that was possible, see that they
 
        were tried, convicted and sent to prison. 
  
         </p><p>Preventing terrorist attacks became a game 
  
        in which national-security experts, the FBI, 
  
        prosecutors and intelligence personnel attempted to 
  
        learn where and when attacks were to occur before
 
        they actually happened so they could do their best 
  
        to prevent it. 
  
         </p><p>For many years prior to 9/11, I spoke out 
  
        as forcefully as I could against this approach to 
  
        fighting terrorism.  My position was not original,
 
        Mr. Chairman.  It reflected the views of Secretary 
  
        of State George Shultz, and the views of his boss, 
  
        Ronald Reagan. 
  
         </p><p>He proposed in 1983 that the United States 
  
        should adopt a policy of active defense against
 
        terror.  "Fighting terrorism will not be a clean or 
  
        pleasant contest," he said, "but we have no choice. 
  
        We must reach a consensus in this country that our  
  
        responses should go beyond passive measures, 
  
        passive defense, to consider means of active 
  
        prevention, preemption and retaliation.  Our goal 
  
        must be to prevent and deter future terrorist
 
        attacks." 
  
         </p><p>By the end of the Reagan administration, 
  
        the Shultz Doctrine had become national policy as 
  
        reflected by the bombing of Libya in 1987 for 
  
        arranging terrorist attacks on America.
 
         </p><p>Mr. Chairman, you know, and certainly 
  
        Co-Chairman Hamilton knows, that nothing stays the 
  
        same in Washington D.C.  After the first President 
  
        Bush took over, the bombing of Pan Am 103 was 
  
        treated as a criminal matter and eventually
 
        resolved after years of legal and diplomatic 
  
        maneuvering with the conviction of a single Libyan 
  
        intelligence operative. 
  
         </p><p>Osama bin Laden fashioned his strategy on 
  
        the basis of this passive policy.  He became
 
        convinced the U.S. could be forced to leave Muslim 
  
        countries and abandon Israel if he launched attacks 
  
        that shed American blood.  Nothing that happened  
  
        prior to September 11th gave bin Laden reason to 
  
        doubt his assumptions. 
  
         </p><p>Al Qaeda was responsible for several 
  
        successful attacks on U.S. targets prior to
 
        September 11th, as the Commission knows.  And 
  
        throughout this onslaught, we responded precisely 
  
        as bin Laden anticipated. 
  
         </p><p>In early 1993, al Qaeda operatives began 
  
        training Somali fighters to attack UN forces, and
 
        in October that year, they participated in attacks 
  
        that killed 18 marines.  We had boisterously 
  
        arranged to have the UN Security Council issue a 
  
        warrant for the arrest of Mohamed Aidid, but after 
  
        suffering these 18 deaths, we withdrew from
 
        Somalia. 
  
         </p><p>On February 26, 1993, a car bomb exploded 
  
        under the World Trade Center, killing eight people 
  
        and injuring over a thousand.  We convicted most of 
  
        the perpetrators, but we left the organization from
 
        which they came unscathed. 
  
         </p><p>On June 26, 1996, car bombs killed 19 
  
        Americans in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and injured  
  
        another 200.  The U.S. suspected bin Laden and al 
  
        Qaeda.  All we did, however, was open a criminal 
  
        investigation.  Bin Laden was not intimidated.  On 
  
        October 12th that year, he issued a declaration of
 
        war against the U.S., calling on Muslims to "fight 
  
        jihad and cleanse the land from these Crusader 
  
        occupiers." 
  
         </p><p>In November of 1996, bombings in Riyadh 
  
        and at the Khobar Towers barracks killed another 19
 
        American servicemen and injured 109.  Bin Laden 
  
        called those attacks "praiseworthy terrorism," and 
  
        he promised more would follow.  Once again, we sent 
  
        in the FBI. 
  
 
         </p><p>In February 1998, bin Laden put his war
 
        into the form of a religious order, declaring the 
  
        "killing of Americans and their civilian and 
  
        military allies is a religious duty for each and 
  
        every Muslim." 
  
         </p><p>And then August that same year, al Qaeda
 
        terrorists car-bombed the U.S. embassies in Kenya 
  
        and Tanzania, killing 224 people and injuring about 
  
        5,000.  The U.S. launched a single ineffectual  
  
        missile strike on an al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan, 
  
        on one of those big old mountains, and on a 
  
        pharmaceutical plant in Sudan. 
  
         </p><p>When it came to legal action, though, we
 
        pulled out the stops; we indicted bin Laden on 224 
  
        counts of murder.  Characteristically, he failed to 
  
        show up for his trial.  We settled for prosecuting 
  
        four al Qaeda operatives, after which prosecutors 
  
        triumphantly declared that they would continue to
 
        investigate al Qaeda until bin Laden and his 
  
        cohorts were all brought to justice. 
  
         </p><p>This so terrified bin Laden that he told 
  
        Time Magazine, "The U.S. knows that I have attacked 
  
        it, by the grace of God, for more than 10 years
 
        now," in other words, why are they making such a 
  
        big deal out of this? 
  
         </p><p>On October 12, 2000, a suicide boat 
  
        bombing of the USS Cole in Aden harbor killed 17 
  
        American sailors and injured 40, in addition to
 
        causing over $100 million of damage.  We knew it, 
  
        it was al Qaeda's work, but the Clinton 
  
        administration did not bother to engage even in a  
  
        symbolic use of force, not even that one salvo of 
  
        missiles this time.  Instead, it launched once 
  
        again a massive invasion of aggressive FBI agents, 
  
        incidentally, none of whom could speak Arabic.
 
         </p><p>At the turn of the millennium, we had some 
  
        very good luck.  An attack plan for the Los Angeles 
  
        Airport was aborted when the perpetrator panicked 
  
        on his way into the U.S.  from Canada. 
  
         </p><p>U.S. officials knew that bin Laden would
 
        strike again.  They worried intensively, not about 
  
        whether an attack was coming, over where and when. 
  
        As the attack began on September 11th, the 
  
        President's advisors were sitting around a table in 
  
        the White House, worrying.  They knew immediately
 
        that the attack for which they were waiting was 
  
        underway. 
  
         </p><p>Given these events, it is small surprise 
  
        that after the attacks of September 11th, bin Laden 
  
        was triumphant.  He was a hero.  His strategy had
 
        worked.  The U.S. had not stopped him. 
  
         </p><p>Now we have heard many claims by former 
  
        and present officials in an attempt to explain why  
  
        they could not have prevented the 9/11 attacks. 
  
        The accumulating evidence undermines these claims. 
  
        But these excuses are, in any event, beside the 
  
        point.  And that is the fundamental point of my
 
        testimony to this Commission.  They are beside the 
  
        point. 
  
         </p><p>The fact is that well before September 
  
        11th, the FBI, the intelligence community, the 
  
        Terrorism Czar, and everyone to whom they reported
 
        all knew that additional attacks by al Qaeda were 
  
        being planned and would certainly be attempted. 
  
        They simply failed to do before September 11th what 
  
        was done immediately thereafter. 
  
         </p><p>The horrors of that day finally galvanized
 
        the nation into action.  Now President Bush has 
  
        adopted three principles to guide U.S. policy: 
  
        First, that serious terrorist attacks should be 
  
        treated as acts of war, not merely as crimes; 
  
        second, that states are responsible for terrorism
 
        from within their borders; and third, that we must 
  
        preempt attacks where possible. 
  
         </p><p>These principles are strategically  
  
        necessary, morally sound, and legally defensible. 
  
        This Commission should confirm the need to adopt 
  
        active measures of defense.  Where grave threats 
  
        are present, state responsibility exists and the
 
        need for the use of preemptive force is 
  
        demonstrable, even if not imminent. 
  
         </p><p>The notion that criminal prosecution could 
  
        bring a terrorist group like al Qaeda to justice is 
  
        absurd.  And the UN Security Council has now
 
        authoritatively established the responsibilities of 
  
        states in this regard in its Resolution 1373. 
  
         </p><p>As for preemption, the Commission should 
  
        consider carefully the implications of a position 
  
        that would preclude the U.S. from acting in its
 
        self defense merely because a real, terrible, and 
  
        certain threat was not also imminent.  The 
  
        Commission should reject any standard of law that 
  
        would unreasonably restrict the President from 
  
        performing his or her obligation to protect the
 
        United States. 
  
         </p><p>The need for preemptive actions stems 
  
        ultimately from the conditions in modern life.  We  
  
        are a target-rich country, huge, virtually 
  
        impossible to defend effectively.  Every potential 
  
        type of weapon can be used against us, from the 
  
        most conventional to the most modern and
 
        unconventional.  We are vulnerable.  Our entire 
  
        infrastructure is vulnerable and will be for many 
  
        years to come. 
  
         </p><p>The area of intelligence is no less 
  
        subject to this reality.  Many improvements should
 
        be made to enhance capacities, but it is illusory 
  
        to believe that intelligence, even combined with 
  
        all presently conceivable advances in technology, 
  
        will enable us to know in advance of all the 
  
        attacks we will have to foil through passive
 
        measures to achieve an adequate level of security. 
  
         </p><p>We must, therefore, be able, when 
  
        necessary, to resort to active measures, and 
  
        necessity must be determined on the basis of all 
  
        relevant factors, not just imminence.
 
         </p><p>No national-security policy against 
  
        terrorism can be regarded as sound if it fails to 
  
        include preemptive actions as an essential element.  
  
        Nor should the Commission underestimate the 
  
        importance of preemption. 
  
         </p><p>The historical record indicates that many 
  
        terrorist acts, attacks on the U.S., can be
 
        anticipated.  The most recent attacks were by al 
  
        Qaeda, a single organization responsible for most 
  
        of the attacks I have listed for you, led by a man 
  
        who announced his intentions to kill Americans, in 
  
        advance, and who demonstrated his capacity to do so
 
        over and over again before he was finally stopped. 
  
         </p><p>Other groups likely to attack us are also 
  
        well known, indeed, this panel has on it some of 
  
        the world's experts on those groups.  It is true 
  
        that any war carries risks and the war on terrorism
 
        is no exception. But the risks of using force must 
  
        always be weighed against the risk of inaction. 
  
         </p><p>The Commission should keep in mind the 
  
        utterly helpless posture into which our 
  
        national security officials placed themselves and
 
        the damage to which they exposed the nation by 
  
        failing to treat, as a proper part of their 
  
        authority and indeed of their responsibility, the  
  
        use of force against so well-established and 
  
        determined an enemy as al Qaeda. 
  
         </p><p>Ultimately, we owe the dead, the living, 
  
        and the unborn a world of freedom and tolerance.
 
        When all else fails, we must fight to preserve and, 
  
        in due course, extend those values.  Freedom and 
  
        tolerance are not merely Western or American 
  
        ideals.  They are enshrined in the UN Charter, 
  
        freely subscribed to by all Member States.  To
 
        allow their subordination to any ideology or 
  
        religion, however deeply felt, would undo the 
  
        principles upon which the future of this nation and 
  
        of humanity rests.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much.
 
        Professor Dan Byman, who's got a class to teach, 
  
        somebody who works for a university who understands 
  
        very, very clearly is a top priority.  He's from 
  
        Georgetown University.  Thank you, sir, for coming. 
  
        And when you have to leave, we will certainly
 
        understand that. 
  
         </p><p>PROFESSOR BYMAN:  Thank you very much, Mr. 
  
        Chairman.  Governor Kean, Vice Chairman Hamilton,  
  
        Commissioners and Commission staff, representatives 
  
        of the victims and survivors of the attack.  I am 
  
        very grateful and honored to be here today speaking 
  
        to you.
 
         </p><p>In my testimony today I am going to 
  
        concentrate, in the interests of brevity, on key 
  
        intelligence and policy issues that proved a 
  
        problem before September 11th.  The CIA has been 
  
        roundly criticized, as have other intelligence
 
        agencies, for their performance in 
  
        counterterrorism.  They particularly have been 
  
        faulted for not stopping the attacks of September 
  
        11th. 
  
         </p><p>A closer scrutiny of the factual
 
        background, however, suggests there was no single 
  
        action, no simple step, that, had it been taken, 
  
        would have stopped the attack.  More broadly, the 
  
        intelligence community, and I would say 
  
        particularly the CIA, did well in providing
 
        strategic warning of the al Qaeda threat. 
  
         </p><p>Policymakers from both parties have 
  
        confirmed that the intelligence community informed  
  
        them of the identity of the foe, the scale of its 
  
        ambitions and its lethality before September 11th. 
  
        Nevertheless, it is clear that the intelligence 
  
        community could have done much better.
 
         </p><p>In my judgment, many of the problems the 
  
        intelligence community faced in meeting the 
  
        challenge al Qaeda stemmed from broader structural 
  
        issues, and I will discuss three today. 
  
         </p><p>One issue was a large gap that existed
 
        between the gathering of intelligence domestically 
  
        by the FBI and the overseas focus of the rest of 
  
        the intelligence community.  As a result of this 
  
        gap, there was lack of sharing of information 
  
        between those tracking radicals at home and those
 
        tracking radicals abroad. 
  
         </p><p>There was little attempt to marry up this 
  
        privileged information that only the FBI held with 
  
        broader CIA information and vice versa.  And the 
  
        working-level analysts and operatives often did not
 
        know information was available, let alone its 
  
        content. 
  
         </p><p>Because of these problems, it is  
  
        unfortunate but reasonable to conclude that the 
  
        threat to the U.S. homeland received less attention 
  
        than the coverage of al Qaeda's activities 
  
        overseas.
 
         </p><p>A second structural problem was that there 
  
        was no firm control of the intelligence community, 
  
        and as a result, prioritization was exceptionally 
  
        difficult.  The CIA had responsibilities for 
  
        supporting more fighting in Iraq and the Balkans,
 
        monitoring China and other rivals and so on.  For 
  
        the FBI, dead-beat dads, drug money, infrastructure 
  
        protection, all competed for resources with 
  
        counterterrorism.  There was no single plan that 
  
        everyone followed and because everything was
 
        declared to be a priority, nothing really was. 
  
         </p><p>A third structural problem was that before 
  
        September 11th, the FBI was not properly oriented 
  
        for counterterrorism.  The Bureau often failed to 
  
        collect relevant information and the information
 
        collected often was not disseminated outside of the 
  
        FBI and many times within the FBI.  Few people in 
  
        the FBI with counterterrorism responsibilities knew  
  
        about al Qaeda.  What knowledge that existed was 
  
        primarily confined to the New York field office. 
  
        The FBI culture fostered these problems. 
  
         </p><p>Before September 11th, the FBI was
 
        primarily a law-enforcement agency and it was 
  
        probably the world's best.  But law enforcement 
  
        focuses on prosecuting cases, not on understanding 
  
        a broader network.  Law enforcement emphasizes 
  
        gathering specific evidence, not collecting and
 
        sharing all possibly relevant information. 
  
         </p><p>As a result of these problems, the FBI not 
  
        only was not conscious of al Qaeda activities in 
  
        the United States but also didn't know the depth of 
  
        its own ignorance; it didn't know what it didn't
 
        know.  But concentrating attention solely on the 
  
        intelligence community misses the broader context 
  
        of counterterrorism. 
  
         </p><p>A broader review of the U.S. Government's 
  
        performance in both the Clinton and the Bush
 
        administrations before September 11th suggests 
  
        several deep flaws and problems.  As a result of 
  
        these, the intelligence community's successful  
  
        strategic warning of the al Qaeda threat was not 
  
        met with the proper response. 
  
         </p><p>One policy problem was very carefully and 
  
        well discussed by my colleague here at the table,
 
        Mr. Sofaer.  I will simply add my endorsement to 
  
        his remarks that the use of force was not properly 
  
        considered as an option before September 11th. 
  
         </p><p>A second problem was that U.S. policy left 
  
        the issue of terrorist sanctuary unresolved.  In
 
        Afghanistan, al Qaeda was essentially allowed to build 
  
        to an army of like-minded radicals outside the 
  
        reach of the United States.  But even more 
  
        troubling, al Qaeda enjoyed a permissive 
  
        environment in the West, including in the United
 
        States.  It was allowed to recruit, raise money, 
  
        train and plot with relatively little interference 
  
        throughout much of the world. 
  
         </p><p>A third policy flaw was the limited 
  
        defensive measures against terrorism in the United
 
        States.  Almost 20 years ago, the Inman Commission 
  
        investigated the bombings of the U.S. and Marine 
  
        barracks in Lebanon.  And they concluded, "If  
  
        determined well-trained and funded teams are 
  
        seeking to do damage, they will eventually 
  
        succeed." 
  
         </p><p>Over 10 years later, the Cole Commission,
 
        investigating the 1998 embassy bombings, came to 
  
        pretty much the same conclusion, "We cannot count 
  
        on having intelligence to warn us of such  
  
        attacks." 
  
         </p><p>But despite the finding that intelligence is
 
        likely to be lacking, when facing a skilled 
  
        adversary and the intelligence community's 
  
        strategic warning of the al Qaeda threat, very few 
  
        defensive measures were initiated in the United 
  
        States before September 11th.
 
         </p><p>Now the problems I have briefly described 
  
        are problems in a pre-9/11 world.  And much has 
  
        changed since September 11th.  Since the attack, 
  
        funding for intelligence and counterterrorism in 
  
        particular has increased dramatically.  Both
 
        policymakers and the intelligence community are 
  
        intensely focused on terrorism and there have been 
  
        numerous bureaucratic changes to fight terrorism,  
  
        particularly in the FBI. 
  
         </p><p>In its work, I hope the Commission not 
  
        only evaluates what went wrong on September 11th 
  
        but also the quality of changes that we have taken
 
        since then as a nation to prevent the recurrence of 
  
        these attacks. 
  
         </p><p>Mr. Chairman, the work that you and your 
  
        fellow commissioners are doing is essential if we 
  
        are to ensure the security of Americans and triumph
 
        over the threat of terrorism.  And I am confident 
  
        that the Commission's work will enable our country 
  
        to better meet future challenges and prevent a 
  
        recurrence of the nightmare of September 11th. 
  
         </p><p>But I must conclude on a pessimistic note.
 
        Al Qaeda is simply too skilled an adversary to 
  
        expect uninterrupted success.  The United States 
  
        and every nation should recognize that any 
  
        improvements that occur will reduce the frequency 
  
        of attacks, will reduce the lethality of attacks,
 
        but will not end them completely.  Thank you very 
  
        much. 
  
         </p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much.  Our  
  
        next speaker we have is Mr. Brian Jenkins, from the 
  
        Rand Corporation. 
  
         </p><p>MR. JENKINS:  Thank you very much, Mr. 
  
        Chairman.  The written remarks that I submitted to
 
        the Commission, which I believe are in your 
  
        briefing books, address the nature of the current 
  
        terrorist threat, the goals of our counterterrorist 
  
        strategy and the role of intelligence in dealing 
  
        with terrorism.
 
         </p><p>Subsequently, I was asked by members of 
  
        your staff if, in my comments this afternoon, I 
  
        could specifically address the topics of al Qaeda's 
  
        mindset, their purpose in attacking the World Trade 
  
        Center, and how this attack has profoundly affected
 
        our society. 
  
         </p><p>The members of this panel were chatting 
  
        just before we convened here about the necessity to 
  
        change our vocabulary when it came to the 
  
        description of al Qaeda. This is not some
 organization which we simply can depict in a chart
 on the wall and draw Xs through its key figures.
 
 		</p><p>Al Qaeda is more than an organization, it
 
 is a global network of relationships. It is one
 among a galaxy of like-minded terrorist
 enterprises. It is a system, a process for
 transforming the discontents of Islam into a
 violent expression of jihad.
 
 		</p><p>Al Qaeda also reflects a mindset, a
 mindset that really transcends the specific members
 that we may label as members of al Qaeda. Its
 members believe, as others, that Islam is on the
 defensive.
 
 		</p><p>Indeed, they believe that Islam's very
 existence is threatened, not simply by the presence
 of our troops in Saudi Arabia or our support for
 Israel, but by the secular nature of our society,
 by our vast commercial and cultural power, by the
 destructive effects they see in globalization, by
 their own marginalization in the world, in their
 own societies, in the countries to which they and
 their parents have migrated.
 
 		</p><p>They really operate and are instructed in
 a very harrowing, apocalyptic vision of death and
 destruction, one that is informed by an conflated
 
 history of centuries, from the Crusades, to the
 sacking of Baghdad by the Mongol armies, to the
 latest headlines on CNN. To respond to this, to
 battle their way to what they regard as the age of
 the tyrants and to achieve this utopian restoration
 of the Caliphate, God commands that they mount an
 aggressive attack and places no limits on its
 violence. Only violence, cataclasmic violence, can
 change that reality, defend Islam, and drive them
 into this new age.
 
 		</p><p>Therefore, it is absolutely consistent
 that al Qaeda, as we see from the intelligence
 reports, is determined to acquire and use weapons
 of mass destruction, is determined to carry out
 events on the scale of a 9/11. Fortunately, for
 the time being, its capabilities in the area of
 chemical or biological weapons trail its
 ambitions, but it's certainly something that we
 have to take as a presumption going forward.
 
 		</p><p>Now what did these people hope to
 accomplish by attacking the World Trade Center? As
 a consequence of its sheer size, its soaring
 
 height, its prominence on the New York skyline, the
 World Trade Center was an obvious terrorist target
 almost from the moment its construction was
 completed. Both terrorists and terrorism's
 analysts saw this.
 
 		</p><p>The size also meant mass casualties. To
 terrorists who in the 1990s seemed increasingly
 intent upon large-scale violence, toppling the
 towers could bring fatalities in the tens of
 thousands, which we now know was the terrorists'
 intent.
 
 		</p><p>Symbolically, the World Trade Center
 represented America's economic might, our ambition
 to extend our brand of free commerce throughout the
 world, the physical expression of globalization,
 even before the term was coined. Bringing down the
 World Trade Center, in their mind, would challenge
 American authority and would demonstrate the power
 of the attackers.
 
 		</p><p>Of course having been attacked
 unsuccessfully in 1993, that only increased the
 possibility that it would be attacked again. We
 
 recognized this immediately after the '93 bombing.
 In contemplating all possible forms of attack, we
 even included among the theoretical scenarios a
 plane crashing into the building.
 
 		</p><p>Now there wasn't a hell of a lot we could
 do about that with protective measures other than
 to recommend that there be the opportunity for
 swift evacuation of the towers, and fortunately, a
 lot of people did get out on September 11th.
 
 		</p><p>Officials in charge of the property also
 recognized that another major terrorist attack,
 even if unsuccessful, would ruin its commercial
 future. And I want to return to this point in
 light of current concerns about the ruinous
 economic consequences of another 9/11-scale attack
 in the United States.
 
 		</p><p>Al Qaeda's leadership also, in attacking
 the World Trade Center, hoped by such an attack to
 provoke an American retaliation. A feeble American
 response like that described by my colleague here,
 like that in 1998, would only confirm, in their
 eyes, our impotence. On the other hand, an
 
 indiscriminate massive response could be portrayed
 by them as an assault on Islam and might provoke a
 huge backlash that would also advantage al Qaeda.
 
 		</p><p>Now destruction of the World Trade Center
 obviated concerns about the commercial viability of
 the property itself, but the 9/11 attack did have
 cascading effects, devastating cascading effects,
 on the American economy.
 
 		</p><p>Abe correctly points out, calculating the
 costs of 9/11 is tricky business, but in addition
 to the lives lost, the damage to property, the
 insured business-interruption losses amount to
 perhaps $50 billion, total losses in revenue into
 the hundreds of billions, increased security costs
 at the federal level, tens of billions.
 
 		</p><p>State and local governments are being
 crushed by the incremental security costs.
 Corporate security costs have increased by an
 average of 40 to 50 percent, insurance premiums up
 by 30 percent. Borders and ports slowed down just-
 in-time deliveries, inventories increased at a cost. We have
 spent the last three decades exploiting new
 
 technology and new management techniques to remove
 friction from the economy. We have spent the last
 18-and-a-half months putting friction back in.
 
 		</p><p>Now all of this imposes a cost, making
 terrorism an effective mode of economic warfare.
 Now I doubt that the terrorists were aware of this
 on September 11th, but they cannot help but to
 have observed these effects in the 18-and-a-half
 months since. And that poses a challenge to us.
 
 		</p><p>We cannot rely in our strategy of homeland
 security on a gates-and-guards approach. We must
 design security that is effective and efficient.
 We must build critical infrastructure that is
 strong and resilient, able to suffer damage and
 continue to function. Above all, we must abandon
 unrealistic expectations of total security and
 instead adopt a more realistic acceptance of risk.
 We must not allow terrorist attacks or fears of
 terrorist attack to shut us down.
 
 		</p><p>Now building a more effective defense is
 going to require intelligence. And let me just
 make a final comment on intelligence. There has
 
 been a great deal of debate in the federal
 government about how we should reorganize to
 improve our intelligence collection and analysis
 here in the United States. We've talked about
 restructuring the FBI, we've talked about creating
 a domestic intelligence-collection service,
 patterned after the British MI-5.
 
 		</p><p>In my own view, we can do a lot more by
 taking advantage of local-level intelligence
 collection, and I think that might even be better
 than creating another federal entity.
 
 		</p><p>There's great potential at the local
 level. Local police departments know their
 territory, they are recruited locally, they often
 have a composition that better reflects the local
 ethnic mix, they have often more native fluency,
 foreign-language capabilities. Unlike federal
 officers, they don't rotate from city to city every
 three or four years.
 
 		</p><p>To take as an example, you heard from the
 New York Police Department this morning. The NYPD
 is one of the most effective departments in the
 country. They have devoted a thousand of their
 officers to intelligence collection, about
 two-and-a-half percent of their total strength. If
 police departments across the country were to
 dedicate a similar portion of their strength to
 intelligence collection, we would have a national
 intelligence capability of 15,000 to 18,000
 officers.
 
 		</p><p>Now in order to make it work on a national
 basis, they would need better training, they would
 need a common curriculum, they would need some
 better technology, and, above all, they would have
 to be linked so that the results of their
 investigations could be shared across
 jurisdictional lines.
 
 		</p><p>They're ready to go. We don't have to
 wait several years to create another entity in
 Washington. We don't even have to build a new
 building. So I think that in looking at
 intelligence solutions, we might want to look to
 our local capabilities before we look to another
 Washington solution. Thank you.
 
 		</p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Dr. Ranstorp is from the
 University of St. Andrews.
 
 		</p><p>DR. RANSTORP: Thank you much, honored
 members of this panel, this Commission, members of
 the Senate, members of Congress, ladies and
 gentlemen and honored guests. I am honored to be
 here.
 
 		</p><p>I am not going to go into the
 introspective of what happened on 9/11, but
 hopefully, I can contribute to some future
 prescription, looking at it from the outside,
 looking at U.S. terrorism policy in a global
 perspective.
 
 		</p><p>I applaud the introspective and noble
 purpose of this Commission. We must understand our
 historic shortcomings to better order our future
 steps in security. To no one is this quest more
 important or heartfelt than the families and
 friends of those fallen on September the 11th, some
 of whom are assembled here today.
 
 		</p><p>Now while nothing will compensate them for
 their loss, the search for some semblance of
 justice lies not only in assessing the intelligence
 and policy failures. And let me say that it's not
 just in the context of the United States, but also
 there were not only intelligence failures but also
 intelligence failures in terms of policy failures
 that contributed even on the outside of the United
 States and that contributed to this over the past.
 
 		</p><p>But we also must look towards the future
 to ensure that September the 11th will never
 again be repeated. Let me emphasize something
 that has been echoed here before. There is no plan
 that is absolutely watertight. There is no one
 overarching solution that will defeat terrorism.
 We can say with certainty that what Osama bin Laden
 and al Qaeda set in motion on September the 11th is
 likely to reoccur in different places under
 different circumstances in the future.
 
 		</p><p>Much of our future success lies in knowing
 our adversary. Let me echo what Brian Jenkins
 said, in our conception of al Qaeda -- and that's
 something I spent a lot of time on in my written
 contribution to this Commission -- how it adapts,
 
 and in prescribing countermeasures which would
 stand the rigors of an ever-changing global
 context.
 
 		</p><p>Now we have deconstructed in myriad ways
 our intelligence failures and have offered some
 potential solutions in addressing these and in
 breaking down the bureaucratic barriers. Today,
 unlike before September the 11th, there is an
 unprecedented U.S.-led coalition, including -- and
 me emphasize this -- including over 90 countries
 overtly and covertly that have degraded the
 capabilities of al Qaeda.
 
 		</p><p>For instance, a number of those
 responsible for the planning of September the 11th
 attacks and other terrorist operations are in U.S.
 custody, including the mastermind of al Qaeda's
 planning, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.
 
 		</p><p>Now the response of the United States to
 al Qaeda has been focused and highly successful,
 both visibly and otherwise. And I laude President
 Bush's 4D approach to fighting terror, to defeat,
 to deny, to diminish and to defend, and I believe
 
 this strategy strikes the requisite balance of
 offence and defense. And let me stress the
 necessity of offence to counter terrorism with a
 global reach.
 
 		</p><p>Further, the recent establishment of the
 Terrorist Threat Integration Center is a powerful
 testament to the progressive strategy of the
 administration and sends a commanding signal to
 terrorists and their supporters that the United
 States will continue to bring to bear the full
 measure of its intelligence capabilities to thwart
 future plans.
 
 		</p><p>Now my expertise as a foreign scholar of
 Islam, militant Islamic movements and terrorism
 lies not in assessing or critiquing the structures
 or responses of the U.S. intelligence community,
 the counterterrorism bodies, or other institutional
 bureaucracies, or in pinpointing the precise
 shortcomings that led to September the 11th, 2001.
 There are those better equipped to address the
 panel.
 
 		</p><p>What I can do is possibly think about this
 
 in more of a global perspective in highlighting not
 only challenges but also possibly a roadmap toward
 the future, in order to preempt, to prevent another
 attack upon the interests of the United States, at
 home or abroad.
 		</p><p>Now it is essential that the United States
 in this global war on terrorism continues to craft
 and to evolve comprehensive new strategies and
 tactics that balance a changing adversary with a
 rapidly changing global environment. It is
 absolutely necessary not just to take a defensive
 approach but also think globally. And the United
 States is doing that at this moment.
 
 		</p><p>Counterterrorism policy has never been,
 will never be in the future, divorced from other
 strands of foreign policy, regional initiatives, or
 fail to take into account, for example, the nuances
 and the significance of the Israeli-Palestinian
 crisis.
 
 		</p><p>Yet, as Vice Admiral Thomas R. Wilson
 indicated, even the resolution of this
 Israeli-Palestinian conflict will not bring an end
 1
 to the systemic problems inherent to the global
 landscape that foment terrorism and enable
 organizations such as al Qaeda to thrive and to
 flourish.
 
 		</p><p>Countering al Qaeda depends upon
 understanding its true character, as well as the
 environment in which violent jihadism operates.
 Only then can prescriptive solutions be applied and
 the flow of capabilities and the threat-based
 intelligence be translated into building effective
 countermeasures within a strategic framework.
 
 		</p><p>Now Brian Jenkins offered, I would say, a
 way in which one should look at al Qaeda, not as a
 static phenomenon. It is not a static
 organization. It exists on a number of different
 levels. We have to think about what comes after al
 Qaeda, post-al Qaeda, and the systemic environment
 is very difficult in producing, potentially, future
 generations that will follow the message of bin
 Laden and al Qaeda.
 
 		</p><p>Let me go deep down into some of the
 prescriptions and highlighting some of these
 
 prescriptions I think are important. The first
 one, not only understanding the threat, we have to
 continuously reevaluate the threat itself in
 adjusting our response not only internally but also
 globally.
 
 		</p><p>Another issue we need to counter with
 great urgency is the issue of identity theft. Not
 only is this a problem within the United States but
 also has been the basic building blocks for al
 Qaeda to function without philanthropic donations,
 without official donations on a large scale. And
 we need to work harder on this issue because if
 there is one common theme that we see, it's the
 issue of identity theft. And we saw some of those
 9/11 hijackers utilizing that in order to not only
 gain entry into the United States but also to
 garner requisite resources.
 
 		</p><p>The second issue I want to highlight is
 countering terrorism finance. Now more resources
 need to be expended in a more coordinated fashion
 on the financial front in the war against
 terrorism.
 
 		</p><p>Now beyond the existing goal and efforts
 to deny terrorist groups access to the
 international system, to impair their ability to
 fundraise in different theaters of operations and
 also, of course, to expose and incapacitate the
 financial networks used by terrorists, more focused
 global coordination is needed.
 		</p><p>We need better trained, we need
 multilingual financial analysts, and accountants
 are crucial. Closer knit multi-agency
 coordination is vital to monitor the changing means
 and contours of terrorist finance and how it flows
 as they provide vital -- and I would take this sort
 of as a measure from the European perspective, if
 one can't follow the contours of the organization,
 a good way is to follow how the finance flows in,
 understand how it's structuring, how it's changing,
 how it's adapting to the security measures.
 However, it is a simple and true reality that
 terrorist finances flow far quicker in the
 international financial system than any one
 law-enforcement agency can react to.
 
 		</p><p>Operationally, linking funds in one
 country with a terrorist crime in another is
 extremely difficult to prove in a court of law, let
 alone tracking the money in today's international
 financial system. We have to focus and we have to
 look at the nexus not only between terrorism but
 also between organized crime.
 		</p><p>There are numerous black holes that we
 need to address, numerous areas of sustained areas
 of lawlessness that fuel and that feed the ability
 of terrorism to garner resources and operational
 capacity. And I can think of not only areas
 continuing in the Middle East, even in Eastern
 Europe, the former Soviet Union, but also in
 America's own back yard in Latin America.
 		</p><p>Apart from that, we also need to
 understand how al Qaeda works, not only as an
 organization but also in assessing their
 terrorist-attack mode, understanding the
 psychological makeup of the terrorist and
 decision-making procedures and how do they
 identify, how do they gather intelligence of
 
 potential targets, how do they select peculiar
 attack modes.
 		</p><p>And that is urgently needed. We need to
 centrally collate lessons learnt from intelligence
 gathering, from interrogations, from military
 manuals and from identifying weaknesses in our own
 critical infrastructure.
 		</p><p>Now instituting protection of our nuclear
 power stations, providing protection and security
 of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear
 weapons against attack and theft, while also of
 course overall improving our response and
 resilience towards the use of these weapons, is
 absolutely critical.
 		</p><p>Insufficient degrees of physical
 protection, security of chemical and biological
 facilities in the former Soviet Union and
 elsewhere, coupled with the availability of
 freelance scientific expertise, increases the
 spectre of catastrophic terrorism.
 		</p><p>Now even if al Qaeda may be far away, or
 may be close to the using or succeeding in using
 
 what I call a CBRN attack, it is very clear that
 the media also will play a critical role in
 allaying the broader psychological effects for the
 public, with or without major fatalities.
 		</p><p>It is still questionable whether there are
 sufficient contingency plans in coordinating public
 information between the public contingency offices
 in any country and major media outlets, yet the
 framework for this type of coordination will be
 absolutely critical in mitigating the effects of
 such an attack, both in terms of dissemination of
 public advice but also in ensuring infrastructure
 and societal economic continuity.
 		</p><p>Let me finish off by saying that the new
 terrorism represented by September the 11th
 presents special and new urgent challenges to the
 West and international community, especially not
 only to the United States, but to Europe. In
 Europe right now there is a feeling that there's a
 question of not if but rather when terrorism
 globalization and weapons of mass destruction may
 be fused into one, an attack will be imminent.
 
 		</p><p>The fundamental first step but also
 critical step is building on lessons learnt, on
 cross-border cooperation, in looking at U.S.
 counterterrorism in a global arena. And we have to
 understand the changing nature of the threat
 itself. The United States has made significant
 inroads in readdressing weaknesses inside the
 United States but also outside, not only overtly
 but also covertly, in building a tremendous
 multilateral intelligence cooperation with many
 different countries.
 		</p><p>But the simple lesson is that the United
 States, if it wants to protect itself for the long
 term, cannot do this alone. It needs allies. It
 needs multilateral cooperation. This is not a war
 on terrorism, it's a ceaseless struggle that goes
 beyond any administration that will and should
 remain at the heart of protecting the homeland
 nationally and its interests abroad.
 		</p><p>More than ever it is critically necessary
 to prevent, coming back to what my fellow panel
 members had mentioned before, not only to prevent
 
 but also to preempt, beyond U.S. borders,
 terrorist cells, otherwise, September the 11th may
 repeat itself with potentially higher levels of
 lethality.
 		</p><p>Now as a testimony of the great strength
 of New York City and the American people to
 overcome but never to forget, we owe it to the
 victims, their families and the country to be ever
 vigilant in the face of evil, not only from the
 U.S. perspective but also with those allies that
 responded to the tragic events of September the
 11th. Thank you very much.
 		</p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Thank you very much, Dr.
 Ranstorp. Are there any questions from the
 Commission? Senator Lehman?
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: I would like to ask
 Professor Sofaer, the first part of your testimony
 I found very compelling with regard to the vision
 that stretched over a number of administrations
 where prosecution and bringing the terrorists to
 justice, and I believe Reagan used that term
 numerous times as well, superseded and dominated
 
 the sharing of information at the expense of that
 prosecution, as I think you pointed out or in some
 of the previous testimony, the Joint Investigation,
 the CIA, sometimes DIA, sometimes learned important
 intelligence only by reading the trial transcripts
 of some of the 93 perpetrators.
 		</p><p>As a former prosecutor and distinguished
 legal advisor, could you get a little more specific
 of how could we establish a procedure or a process
 within the government to bring that a little more
 back into balance so if it was necessary to perhaps
 sacrifice a conviction in order to prevent a
 disaster that that balance can be made on a
 common-sense basis.
 		</p><p>DR. SOFAER: With pleasure. I think what
 the present government and the present Department
 of Homeland Security has been trying to do,
 Congress is trying to do right now, is overcome
 those barriers. Once you adopt the criminal-law
 model as your primary model, of course it has to be
 part of any effort to prosecute criminals, but once
 you adopt it as your primary model, a number of
 
 very complicated things happen. Evidence that a
 national-security strategist might think is very
 important is treated as unimportant by someone who
 wants to make a case. He's always thinking about
 whether the evidence is admissible in a courtroom.
 		</p><p>I mean, there are so many points like this
 that support what you have just said, Secretary
 Lehman. In general, what you have to do is
 subordinate the interests in criminal prosecution
 to the interests in protecting the country. And I
 would think that that's a no-brainer.
 		</p><p>We subordinate the interests of criminal
 prosecution to Congressional investigations because
 our public needs to know things and our legislators
 need to know things. I would think that it would
 follow from that premise that we would subordinate
 the interests of criminal prosecution to the
 interests of protecting the country.
 		</p><p>And that needs to be done institutionally.
 You need to have a body of some kind in Washington,
 a counterterrorism center of some sort, that's
 capable of doing that. And I must say, I don't
 
 think that the combination of the CIA and the FBI
 is that body. Frankly, it's the first evidence
 I've ever seen of them cooperating effectively, and
 that is in precluding the development of an
 independent intelligence operation that would in
 fact lead to the protection of the American people.
 		</p><p>I have the highest regard for both
 agencies, but to think that that is going to solve
 the problem is a terrible mistake. And I think the
 President was sold a bill of goods. I hope he
 changes his mind and reconsiders and helps to give the Department of
 Homeland Security
 this authority to create a real counter-balance to
 the interests of two agencies that have utterly
 failed to cooperate and will continue to fail to
 cooperate because they have radically different
 agendas, and the underlying issues, as you pointed
 out, aren't changing.
 		</p><p>So you need to have, as you said, a
 different institutional structure that puts in
 place this notion of the nation's security as
 preeminent. I do want to say that I think Attorney
 
 General Ashcroft has made the protection of America
 his chief priority but that still the agencies
 under him are still geared to achieving
 predominantly other things.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: And it's not just
 the federal. I think we would very much appreciate
 on the Commission your giving further thought, in
 your career combining policy with the
 prosecutorial, to perhaps give us some
 recommendations down the road for specific ways to
 do this.
 		</p><p>This is not just a federal problem. If a
 New York cop who speaks Farsi picks up a piece of
 intelligence and is involved in a case, the
 district attorney can put it under seal and it's
 gone into the mole hole until that case is
 resolved.
 		</p><p>And saying we're going to put national
 security ahead of prosecutions. It's all fine, it's
 motherhood, but if we don't have specific
 procedures and changes to recommend, then it's just
 so much hot air.
 
 		</p><p>DR. SOFAER: Can I get a little help from
 the Rand Institution? I mean, I'd like an office
 there and a little bit of an opportunity to consult
 with some of the experts. That's a wonderful
 subject and I'm very serious in suggesting that it
 will take some, several talented people to put
 together a detailed plan of the kind you're talking
 about.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: That leads right
 into another theme that all three of you have
 touched on, and that is the sharing of
 intelligence. And all through the post-9/11
 period, some people have pointed to MI-5 as a
 better way of dealing with this contradiction
 between law enforcement and intelligence.
 		</p><p>I would be interested if each of you could
 tell the Commission, either now or later, after
 further reflection, what other examples, in your
 experience, in Europe and elsewhere in the world,
 where they're getting it right and we're getting it
 wrong in the handling of counterterrorism, not just
 intelligence, but across the board.
 
 		</p><p>DR. RANSTORP: Could I comment on this?
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: Yes.
 		</p><p>DR. RANSTORP: I think there's a great
 sort of reflection of what went wrong in 9/11 from
 the U.S. perspective, but let's make one thing very
 clear. This was not just a U.S. problem, this was
 a problem that we had in Germany. I mean, the
 German intelligence had these cells under
 investigation, dating back to 1998.
 		</p><p>However, the legislation was not up to
 speed in what kind of adversary we were facing.
 The same with Britain. I mean, the only country
 that I can think of that has had it right is a
 country, France, which have had very much
 less-restricted laws in terms of dealing with the
 problem of Islamic radicalism, but that is of
 course at the expense of civil liberties.
 		</p><p>So when we look at this issue, we cannot
 just look at it from the U.S. perspective, we have
 to look at it from a global perspective,
 particularly with our European allies who
 constituted part of this coalition, but also
 
 front-line defense.
 		</p><p>It's no accident, first of all, that 15 of
 the hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, given al
 Qaeda and bin Laden's desire to create the
 response, vis-a-vis United States and Saudi, nor is
 it an accident that they stationed themselves in
 Germany having analyzed, having probed, having
 known exactly where the weakness is.
 		</p><p>We know that from the interrogations. We
 know that from having the benefit of the doubt of
 the interrogations, the evidence that we had in the
 past that we're dealing with an exceptionally savvy
 adversary who would know and understand our
 weaknesses.
 		</p><p>And therefore, I would be hesitant to sort
 of try to import a model like MI-5 into the United
 States. Rather, we have to rely, and we're doing
 that now, we're getting things right in terms of
 counterterrorism cooperation not only between the
 United States and European allies, but more
 importantly, with friendly Arab allies who have
 provided invaluable information and assistance in
 
 not only understanding al Qaeda but also what may
 come after al Qaeda.
 		</p><p>And therefore, I think that my
 recommendation, as a foreigner to this country, and
 having looked at this problem for a long time, is
 that we have to not only look at this problem from
 a U.S. perspective in trying to get the modalities
 right in terms of the structure, but also looking
 at how can we overcome the intelligence-sharing
 issues that, despite September the 11th, still
 plagues some of the cooperation, even among our
 most valued allies, in other words, the
 prioritization of intelligence.
 		</p><p>MR. JENKINS: Mr. Secretary, I'd like to
 take you up on your offer to have an opportunity to
 reflect on that more, but let me just make a couple
 of comments which are perhaps sobering comments.
 		</p><p>First of all, if you ask people, you know,
 should we have something like an MI-5, a lot of
 people will say, yes, and then you ask what is it,
 and they haven't the vaguest idea. So there's some
 mystique about this notion. The fact is, most of
 
 the Western European nations, many of the nations
 around the world, do have more than one
 intelligence service. They do divide their
 responsibilities.
 		</p><p>The British have MI-5 and MI-6. The
 Germans have their intelligence service, the Bundes
 Criminal Amt, the Bundesamt fur Verfassungsschutz,
 to deal with different aspects of intelligence.
 The French divide it. The Italians divide it.
 That is a common feature for very, very good, good
 reason.
 		</p><p>The problem of intelligence, of sharing
 among intelligence agencies, is chronic. Creating
 another entity may be a solution, but it doesn't
 automatically mean that intelligence will be
 shared. Instead of having two rival agencies, we
 can create three and four rival agencies. Simply
 sharing information, to most intelligence services, is
 an unnatural act.
 		</p><p>The third point I'd like to make is that I
 am willing to concede that we can learn a great
 deal from the intelligence services of the European
 
 countries, many of whom have dealt with terrorist
 threats on their turf longer than we have dealt
 with it here. At the same time, we have to keep in
 mind again the realities.
 		</p><p>It took the British 15, 20 years to
 effectively penetrate the IRA. There were still
 surprises. Large bombs went off in the heart of
 London. That's dealing with an adversary that
 speaks roughly the same language, and not something
 headquartered in distant Afghanistan. So we want
 to be careful about that.
 		</p><p>Final point, and it relates to something
 that Magnus had said which I think is important.
 We do have to figure out how to create capability
 at an international level. We have achieved since
 September 11th an unprecedented degree of
 cooperation among intelligence services of a number
 of countries in going after al Qaeda.
 		</p><p>What we have to figure out how to do now
 is how to institutionalize that and to create
 permanent machinery and procedures that will allow
 us to orchestrate -- and I use the word orchestrate
 
 here -- traditional law enforcement, intelligence
 collection, responses, whether in the form of
 arrest, special operations, or application of
 military force, and to do that across the globe in
 a very, very effective way, since this is the type
 of adversary we're going to be dealing with.
 		</p><p>DR. SOFAER: Could I just add one thing,
 Mr. Secretary, and that is that I hope you did pay
 a little bit of attention to what I said, where we
 can drive ourselves nuts trying to come up with
 different ways to figure out everything about
 everybody that might attack us, when and where
 they're going to do it.
 		</p><p>The fact of the matter is that we have
 excellent strategic intelligence. And Dan Byman is
 absolutely right about that. We knew who was going
 to attack us, we knew where he was, we knew he
 could do it. And we knew he wanted to do it and
 was determined to do it. And how much more do you
 need to know before you actually do something to
 stop an enemy?
 		</p><p>I hope that you won't be offended that I
 
 repeat that. I just think that there is a tendency
 among us all, we're all civilized people, we all
 sort of tend to get drawn into this game of trying
 to manipulate things around so somehow we can make
 the world safe without raising a hand in violence
 or anger, but ultimately -- and that's the right
 attitude -- but ultimately, when it's pretty clear
 you're not going to talk someone out of wanting to
 kill you that you have to do something about him.
 		</p><p>And when I hear stuff about the Middle
 East and Israel and stuff, I just, obviously I have
 always been, I've worked hard on Israel peace
 issues. When I was in the department, Chairman
 Hamilton, you remember that we worked together on
 many things involving Iran and we showed our good
 will in many ways to these countries, but can you
 imagine that a peace treaty between Israel and the
 Palestinians would be anything but anathema to
 these people, these people who hate us?
 		</p><p>The last thing they want is a peace
 treaty between Israel and the Palestinians. They
 would be determined to destroy it, to tear it down.
 
 Go read what Islamic jihad says. They're our next
 enemy, Islamic jihad. And I'm telling you, they
 have told us they want to kill us. They have
 already started doing it.
 		</p><p>And we have to pay attention to these few
 organizations that are around the world who are
 determined to attack us for the reasons that these
 gentlemen have so brilliantly articulated.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: That leads into
 another question, Professor Ranstorp. You're a
 well-known expert on Hizbollah, for instance, and
 other groups. As Mr. Jenkins has so well
 elucidated, this, what we call al Qaeda, is really
 a set of or an archipelago of groups, some that
 will last a short time, some a long time.
 Hizbollah has lasted a very long time.
 		</p><p>How would you describe the relationship
 today between Hizbollah, Hamas, the group that just
 got hit up in northern Iraq, and these other parts
 of the archipelago and how much should we focus on
 them, as well as the core of al Qaeda?
 		</p><p>DR. RANSTORP: Mr. Secretary, a very good
 
 question. It's a very broad question. I think we
 have to understand that al Qaeda is one of three
 things, first of all, before I address the issue of
 Hizbollah.
 		</p><p>First of all, at the higher level, we're
 talking about an organization that have command and
 control structure. It's very organized. We have
 made major dents into the organization. We
 understand it.
 		</p><p>The second level, which is probably the
 largest level, we have those working in the service
 of al Qaeda, those concerted groups who are
 operating on a national level, trying to confront
 not just the United States but also their own
 regimes and trying to effect regime changes.
 		</p><p>Thirdly, we have those that are inspired
 or are sympathetic to the means and modes of al
 Qaeda. In terms of the cooperation between the two
 groups, there's very little corporation, there has
 been some.
 		</p><p>In terms of Hizbollah itself, I would
 recommend to divorce Hizbollah as a movement and
 
 those individuals who have been part of Hizbollah's
 past, who I would more characterize as half Iranian
 intelligence agents and half Hizbollah operatives,
 who are standing with one foot in Iran and one foot
 in Hizbollah, who the United States is pursuing
 with extraordinary vigor.
 		</p><p>The movement itself knows it may be on the
 sort of third phase on the war against terrorism.
 It's exceptionally sensitive to that issue. It is
 of course bounded up into the U.S.-Iranian dynamic
 in terms of its relationship, but it is of course
 an organization with global reach.
 		</p><p>I mean, it's an organization just like al
 Qaeda, if one disturbs the bee hive, they may come
 back at us. We have to treat this issue with
 extraordinary care. Otherwise, we may be in for
 possibly retaliation from the organization.
 		</p><p>In terms of other organizations, of course
 there are other ones in Lebanon, not just Hizbollah
 elements but also we have an organization called
 Asbat al-Ansar. And certainly there were connections
 between Asbat al-Ansar in Ein-el-Helweh, a refugee
 
 camp, with Ansa al-Islam, and connections also to
 the assassination of Lawrence Foley in Jordan. So
 there were these loose connections that are more
 based on logistical aspects than any common
 ideology. So we have to treat this on a
 case-by-case basis.
 		</p><p>I wouldn't say that there is a
 full-fledged cooperation between Hizbollah and al
 Qaeda. They have different goals. They may focus
 in on the Israeli-Palestinian issue as a mobilizing
 tool, but certainly we should treat them as
 separate. And Hizbollah certainly knows that they
 may be the next face in the U.S. war on terrorism.
 And they are very sensitive to that issue.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: Do they have any
 current plans or operations that you're aware of
 targeted in the United States?
 		</p><p>DR. RANSTORP: I would say this, that
 there are, there have been, according to my
 assessment, according to my contacts and support,
 that should there be a confrontation between the
 United States and Iran, they could cause some
 
 damage inside the U.S. mainland.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: That raises a very
 interesting dimension also that Mr. Jenkins had
 raised, the fact that this is a kind of a
 missionary organization and that it depends on
 interrelationships and sponsors and sanctuaries.
 		</p><p>What would your judgment be if we were
 truly effective in draining the financial swamp, I
 mean cutting off principally the Saudi money that
 flows through various channels and through the
 various foundation networks, if we were successful
 in doing what Mr. Push had recommended so
 eloquently earlier and really putting the heat on
 those sources that like to have it both ways, would
 that dry up al Qaeda and other groups, related
 groups?
 		</p><p>MR. JENKINS: Going after finances is
 useful, to the extent that it can reduce some of
 the resources that are available to these
 organizations, that is of benefit. It is also,
 quite separate from how much money you can dry up,
 it is a source of useful intelligence itself, that
 
 is, it tells us a great deal about connections
 between various entities, so it has a separate
 utility.
 		</p><p>In terms of being able, however, to dry it
 up enough to halt terrorist activities, that, I
 must say, I'm somewhat skeptical of. To be sure,
 the cash flow of organizations like al Qaeda was
 significant, but a lot of that
 money was used to support the Taliban, a lot of it
 was used to support the training camps and
 infrastructure in Afghanistan itself, which they no
 longer have.
 		</p><p>Can we squeeze it down enough to reduce
 money to support actual terrorist operations? That
 I'm less certain about because that, you know,
 we're talking about estimates of the cost of
 September 11th on the terrorists' side, we're
 probably something in the area of a half a million.
 A terrorist operation, major large-scale terrorist
 operation, we're talking about something in the
 hundreds of thousands.
 		</p><p>Given the volume of money sloshing around
 
 the world in legitimate and illegitimate channels,
 through formal and informal structures, the notion
 that we can squeeze it down into the
 hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars level, I'm not so
 sure we can do that.
 		</p><p>So we can put a dent in these
 organizations, we can make the support that they
 provide for some of these more radical movements,
 proselytization activities, support for some of
 these madrassas, we can do that. Can we deny the
 money necessary to buy the bombs, to recruit the
 people to carry out these attacks? I'm a lot less
 certain about that.
 		</p><p>DR. SOFAER: I'm not sure we can close the
 madrassas down. I mean, do you think about how we
 would ever have the ability to close madrassas down
 in western Pakistan?
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: Money talks.
 		</p><p>DR. SOFAER: Money talks, yeah, but I
 don't know how this country could go along and
 convince the government of Pakistan to do that when
 the people of Pakistan want those madrassas.
 
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: But are they not
 supported by the Saudis financially?
 		</p><p>DR. SOFAER: I'm sure. I'm sure they are.
 I'm sure they are.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: Is there nothing we
 can do there?
 		</p><p>DR. SOFAER: Oh, we can do plenty, I just
 think there's a limit.
 		</p><p>DR. RANSTORP: Mr. Secretary, if I may
 add, beyond the philanthropic aspects of this, let
 me say that I have looked into every single arrest
 in Europe and beyond. The common feature is what I
 outlined as the number-one issue, and that was,
 every time you catch an al Qaeda suspect or al
 Qaeda operative, you will have 15 to 20 different
 identities.
 		</p><p>Through these, he can easily, with or
 without Saudi or other financing, be able to garner
 
 the requisite resources, the building blocks of
 being able to launch terrorism through credit-card
 fraud, bank fraud. And that's an issue what we
 need to tackle with great urgency if we're going to
 
 be able to find these individuals, to weed them
 out, and to put a stop to this preemptively.
 		</p><p>DR. SOFAER: It isn't, Mr. Secretary, if I
 may say, it isn't the teaching of Islam that we
 should be trying to prevent or inhibit. It's the
 teaching of one type of Islam, the Wahhabi type
 brand of Islam. So if we can modify our effort and
 narrow it and target it to those uses of funds that
 threaten us as human beings and appeal to Muslims
 in the world and say, 'stop teaching your children
 to kill us,' that is really what we want you to do.
 		</p><p>Teach Islam, go ahead, but that branch of
 Islam, if we can narrow it, then we might succeed
 because if the Islamic world sees this as an effort
 to squeeze the financing of Islamic institutions,
 we will never get anywhere.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: One last question.
 How close is al Qaeda to having usable weapons of
 mass destruction? I'd like to hear it from all of
 you.
 		</p><p>DR. RANSTORP: Well, I was asked by CNN,
 when they found the terrorist tapes, to come and
 
 analyze them, the so-called dog tapes, it was
 visual representation of the fact that they were on
 their way to using chemical agents.
 		</p><p>I think al Qaeda is very close to, and
 particularly in two spheres, number one, the ricin
 arrests we have had in Europe, we have had them for
 about a year and a half, I mean, we have known
 about this issue for a year and a half, over a year
 and a half, since 9/11.
 		</p><p>And it's not a weapon of mass destruction,
 it's a weapon of mass disruption. It would have
 huge economic consequences, psychological
 contingent of fear.
 		</p><p>Perhaps more worrying is al Qaeda and al
 Qaeda elements in the former Soviet Union are
 searching for radiological material. And you have
 those two elements. On the one hand, chemical
 agents, that there's a program, an active program
 to try to acquire them and to also possibly deploy
 them. On the other hand, you have a lot of
 radiological material.
 		</p><p>And in many ways I think the prevailing
 
 view in Europe among security officials that I have
 spoken to is that it is not a question of if but
 rather when that they are deployed, perhaps not in
 the United States, but possibly in Europe.
 		</p><p>MR. JENKINS: Depending on how you define
 weapons of mass destruction, in fact they have
 them, I mean, we know that they have chemical
 capabilities and biological capabilities. The
 construction of a radiological dispersal device
 takes nothing more than some source of
 radioactivity, which is readily available in
 society, and some explosive or other means of
 dispersing it.
 		</p><p>If we're talking about using those on a
 scale that would create mass destruction, mass
 casualties, then they're probably far, far from
 that, but as Magnus points out, the issue here is
 not the body count but rather the effects. We
 should perhaps be talking about weapons of mass
 effect.
 		</p><p>That is, if we go back to the incident in
 Tokyo and the attack involving nerve gas in Tokyo
 
 subways, 12 people died in that attack, 5,500 were
 treated at hospital as a consequence of that. Of
 those 5,500, 1,200 were actually exposed to the
 chemical. The other 4,700 were illnesses brought
 about by anxiety, I mean real heart attacks, real
 respiratory problems, asthmatic attacks,
 psychosomatic attacks. And that's something that
 we would have to expect.
 		</p><p>Simply by mentioning the words biological
 or nerve gas or radioactivity in the same sentence
 with terrorism is going to get us some real effects
 here. So the issue is not whether they can carry
 out the terrorist equivalent of a Chernobyl or a
 Bhopal, but rather simply how they could use these
 in order to create a tremendous amount of fear,
 alarm, national panic, and economic disruption.
 		</p><p>I mean, we remember from our own
 experience, which is not al Qaeda connected, but
 with the anthrax letters that we experienced in the
 fall of September 2001, five people were killed,
 but we closed down a portion of a Senate office
 building for months while we tried to get things
 
 down to the 'manageable number of spores,' I think
 was one of the quotes.
 		</p><p>If we talk about a major transportation
 system or a major commercial property, I'm not
 quite sure what the public reaction would be to the
 manageable number of spores. It's going to have
 tremendous psychological consequences, not just
 biochemical.
 		</p><p>DR. SOFAER: I would just add one remark,
 one comment to what my colleagues have said, Mr.
 Secretary, Mr. Chairman, and that is that you
 should not consider the potential of al Qaeda or
 terrorist groups to use these weapons on their own.
 You have to take into account the potential of
 cooperation with a state.
 		</p><p>We have on the record, in the last year
 and a half or so, two statements that I consider
 highly significant. One is by former Prime
 Minister Rafsanjani where he suggests that a
 nuclear device in Tel Aviv would put an end to
 Israel, whereas a nuclear device in the Arab world
 would simply take some casualties and they'd get
 
 over it and move on.
 		</p><p>And another statement and most recently
 made by the former Head of Intelligence of
 Pakistan, General al Haq, where he said essentially
 the same thing, we could use a nuclear device and
 put an end to Israel.
 		</p><p>Most of this, both these comments were
 directed at Israel, but clearly the option is
 always there of going to a terrorist group if you
 are hostile to the United States or any other
 western country, including Israel, and having them
 do your dirty work and providing the terrorist with
 the ability to do that. Indeed, that is probably
 the ultimate fear that we have to confront.
 		</p><p>MR. JENKINS: I'm going to take exception
 to the comments of my colleague on that point. I
 am not absolutely convinced that national
 governments, even those we may identify as rogue
 states, are so ready to put weapons of mass
 destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, things
 that have signatures, in the hands of groups they
 do not absolutely control. They would bear the
 
 consequences.
 		</p><p>And indeed, I think this is, however, the
 point where probably Abe and I would find common
 ground on this, that we can affect this by policy.
 We can ensure that people well understand that we
 will take appropriate action to deal with that,
 whether it's action after the fact or whether it's
 action before the fact, that will be treated, that
 the notion that this can be done with some
 successful degree of subterfuge through some
 terrorist operative and that that will necessarily
 fool us or deter us from going back to the source,
 I think in wake of the headlines we're looking at,
 as we speak, that becomes a fairly credible
 argument. So as I say, we affect that by our
 policy.
 		</p><p>DR. RANSTORP: Mr. Secretary, may I sort
 of continue beyond the state using those types of
 weapons. What concerns security and policy-makers
 in thinking about al Qaeda for the future is
 possibly not so much what is happening right now --
 because we have a very good handle on that, there's
 
 an unprecedented coordination among 90 countries --
 it's the potential for al Qaeda or post-al Qaeda to
 become an incubator of specific states, I'm
 thinking particularly about the consequences of,
 for example, Pakistan.
 		</p><p>We've got al Qaeda eventually taking over,
 post-Al Qaeda taking over other structures like
 Saudi. So al Qaeda is very patient. What
 represents al Qaeda is very patient, thinking about
 strategy over the long term.
 		</p><p>I think we equally have to craft
 strategies. They are thinking about these issues
 over the long term. It is not going to be easy
 decades ahead, but I hope we will be able to
 prevent another catastrophe that we had like here
 in New York City.
 		</p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Congressman Roemer?
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: Well, in his usual
 fashion, Secretary Lehman has thoroughly delved
 into a host of the very important topics here. And
 let me just merely try to follow up on a couple of
 them while we have your very helpful expertise and
 
 counsel and insight before us.
 		</p><p>With respect to the body count and the
 number of people that terrorists are willing to
 take, kill, especially as we reflect back on
 September 11th, let me read a quote:
 "Terrorists want a lot of people watching
 and a lot of people listening and not a lot of
 people dead."
 		</p><p>I read that not to embarrass anybody, not
 to, you know, try to throw that around at all.
 It's a quote from 1975. It's a quote from one of
 the panelists. And it is very, very perceptive in
 showing how much terrorists have changed. And Mr.
 Jenkins and I talked a little about that before the
 hearing. It has been a monumental change in what
 terrorists can do with what they have access to do
 and what they are willing to do.
 		</p><p>Mr. Jenkins, you said that back in 1975.
 It was very accurate back then. Why do you think
 it has changed to such a degree today?
 		</p><p>MR. JENKINS: Well, I am the culprit. And
 I believed it then. And in fact I think for many
 
 of the groups, even groups that we would label
 terrorists today, that that still applies. That is
 so long as an enterprise thinks in terms of a
 political ideology or a political agenda, that's
 what we were talking about in the 1970s when I
 wrote that, so long as there's a sense of political
 agenda, then there's a sense of political
 constituency.
 		</p><p>And that imposes constraints that we
 recognized in the 1970s that terrorists, using
 primitive weapons that we knew they had, weapons of
 explosives, weapons of fire, could kill a lot more
 people than they did. And yet they didn't do so,
 not because of some technological ceiling, it had
 to be because of some self-imposed constraint. And
 over a period of time, through interrogation of
 terrorists and interviews in prisons, through trial
 testimony, we learned what those constraints were.
 		</p><p>They worried about group cohesion, not all
 of whose members might have the same stomach for
 violence. They worried about their perceived
 constituents. They always imagine themselves to
 
 have legions of supporters. They wanted to provoke
 public alarm but not to provoke so much backlash
 that would change the rules and threaten their own
 survival.
 		</p><p>And therefore, terrorists have a notion of
 some kind of a red line, some type of a line beyond
 which the violence would be counter-productive.
 		</p><p>Now those constraints were not universal and they
 were not immutable. And over a period of time,
 they changed. And they changed in part because, as
 terrorism became commonplace, there was a built-in
 requirement to escalate.
 		</p><p>Hijacking airliners may get you a headline
 in 1971. When you're up to the 150th hijacking,
 you're page 5 news. So they had to escalate. But
 I think the real change, the qualitative change
 that came about, that was referred to as a
 so-called new terrorism in the late '80s and 1990s
 was the decline of ideology as a driving force for
 political violence, and increasingly, either ethnic
 hatreds or religious fanaticism.
 		</p><p>Now if one believes that instructions to
 
 act, instructions to kill, are handed down from
 God, however that God may communicate with an
 individual, then you really don't worry about the
 constraints of conventional morality, you don't
 worry about constituents on this planet. They are
 infidels or pagans or nonbelievers who will burn in
 hell anyway.
 		</p><p>And it is that, the fundamental change in
 the quality of terrorist violence, so that by the
 1990s, large-scale indiscriminate violence was
 becoming increasingly the reality of contemporary
 terrorism.
 		</p><p>Now projecting that is scary because what
 it means, if the willingness is there because of
 technological advance, that power, power I mean
 crudely, simply is the capacity to kill, to
 destroy, to disrupt, to alarm, to oblige us to
 divert vast resources to security, that that is
 descending into the hand of smaller and smaller
 groups whose grievances, real or imaginary, it's
 not always going to be possible to satisfy.
 		</p><p>Putting that another way, the bands of
 
 fanatics, irreconcilables, lunatics that have
 existed throughout history, are becoming in our age
 an increasingly potent force to be reckoned with.
 And how we, as a society, as a democratic society,
 are going to successfully cope with that and remain
 a democratic society to me is one of the major
 challenges of this century.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: So your argument is,
 quite simply, constraints are coming off, the
 technology is going up, and we can't afford even a
 single mistake, given that these terrorist groups
 could get access to the kind of weaponry that their
 ambition already has them seeking to get.
 		</p><p>MR. JENKINS: Exactly.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: You talked a little
 bit, you talked a little bit in your testimony
 about how we got it so wrong throughout the 1990s
 in calculating the enemy. Al Qaeda's vision, al
 Qaeda's organizational capabilities, al Qaeda's
 money and fundraising.
 		</p><p>The Clinton administration didn't get it
 right, they got it wrong in a lot of ways. The
 
 Bush administration didn't get it right, they got
 it wrong in a lot of ways. The Europeans, the same
 thing.
 		</p><p>I can't help but recall the words from one
 of the counterterrorism chiefs in the Joint Inquiry
 hearings of the FBI who said he was 98 percent
 certain in 2000 that the attack would come from
 overseas and be overseas and it wouldn't be in the
 United States. We not only got it wrong, there was
 no hand-off to get it right domestically. And if
 you might comment on how we do get it right in the
 future.
 		</p><p>Mr. Jenkins, you talked a little bit about
 an intriguing proposal, with 15,000 to 18,000 local
 sheriffs and police officers that could help us get
 it right at the local level.
 		</p><p>Could you flush that out a bit more and
 talk a little bit more in detail about that, and
 would that replace what the Bush administration has
 proposed a T-TIC center [Terrorist Threat Investigation Center] here, or
 work with
 them; how would that work together as a fusion
 center in getting information out to the local
 
 people?
 		</p><p>MR. JENKINS: That is simply one among
 many proposals. It's a rough-and-ready response.
 We're talking about needing a lot more collection
 capability on the streets. And that is one
 approach to getting it. I'd say it probably gets
 us there faster than the creation of a new federal
 agency and the deployment of additional federal
 agencies, but by itself, it's not going to work.
 		</p><p>Here we have to really address a broad
 variety of proposals, some of which have been
 discussed in this panel. Part of the problem, as
 has been mentioned, in terms of the FBI's
 unwillingness to share information relating to
 investigations that might ultimately result in
 prosecution, that itself reflects a trajectory in
 our domestic-intelligence capabilities over the
 years.
 		</p><p>In the 1960s, much more of the FBI's
 counter-intelligence efforts in what we would call
 terrorist-related crimes was aimed at prevention,
 but because of abuses that were recognized in the
 
 1970s, we imposed new rules, new constraints, that
 basically said at the federal level, and these were
 repeated at the state and local level, we don't
 want intelligence in the prevention business
 anymore. We want you in the prosecution business,
 that the prevention business is just too intrusive
 in a free society. So we imposed new guidelines in
 the bureau, at the state level. These were
 repeated by police commissions throughout the
 country.
 		</p><p>By the beginning of the '80s, it was
 recognized that perhaps some of these constraints
 were having a serious impact on
 intelligence-collection capabilities, and so they
 were relaxed somewhat, began to swing a little bit
 the other way, but really there was at the same
 time, there was a perceived decline in the
 terrorist threat domestically in this country. And
 so in fact, because they were difficult to manage,
 because they were politically risky, because they
 were in some cases costly to operate, we continued
 to dismantle domestic-intelligence capabilities.
 
 		</p><p>That reversed somewhat in the 1990s as we
 began to perceive a more serious threat again, but
 we really didn't rebuild the capabilities. And it
 wasn't until September 11th that we recognized we
 had a failure of intelligence in terms of looking
 at this. When I say, "failure," I want to put that
 in quotes. I am not one who believes that if we
 had had just a little better intelligence
 collection, we could have connected the dots, as
 the phrase goes. This is very, very tough.
 		</p><p>When you read the last page of a mystery
 novel first and then read the novel, all of the
 clues are obvious. Going forward, it's a lot more
 complicated than that. But we probably can do it
 better. Now that we have pushed back into the
 prevention business, then that should allow us to
 more easily share some of this information across
 lines without some of the constraints imposed by
 prosecution, which was the real constraint. So
 sharing has to be made better.
 		</p><p>The analysis does have to get there and
 does have to get better. We also have to keep in
 
 mind that we can't judge intelligence solely on the
 basis of identifying and preventing an attack. Of
 course we're going to do that, but intelligence is
 also aimed at disrupting your opponent's capability
 to operate.
 		</p><p>We don't know how many attacks we may have
 thwarted since September 11th. It's a good many.
 And we can identify some clearly, but there may be
 many more that were aborted because of increased
 security or because of good intelligence that we
 will find out about years from now when we catch
 more of these people and interrogate them.
 		</p><p>Better sharing, better analysis, better
 mechanisms across national frontiers, to work more
 closely with our allies, take advantage of this
 unprecedented cooperation I mentioned before.
 		</p><p>When we can get a good flow of information
 from the streets of our cities across to, whether
 it is an investigating magistrate in France or an
 intelligence operative in the Middle East, and
 begin to assemble that kind of information and
 analyze it and repackage it and send it back out to
 
 users, whether it's a policeman on the beat or a
 judge in Italy or a Special Forces Team in
 Afghanistan, then we will be getting close to the
 kind of capability we need to deal with this kind
 of problem. That's going to take a couple, a few
 years.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: More than a few
 years, I would suspect. Several years. Professor,
 you talked a little bit about the problems of
 communication and information sharing between the
 CIA and the FBI. The Joint Inquiry's findings
 agree very much with those systemic and endemic and
 ongoing problems.
 		</p><p>How do you fix it? Do you create more
 agencies to do it and more stove-piping? How do we
 get either those agencies to talk to one another
 and share information or do you create this new
 Terrorist Threat Integration Center? Where do you
 put it, Homeland Security or outside of it? How do
 they communicate with the local people? Give me
 some tangible suggestions here.
 		</p><p>DR. SOFAER: You're really in good shape.
 
 Your Executive Director happens to be the former
 Executive Director of the Markle Commission, a
 Commission Task Force Report on this very subject.
 And he was the principal author, Philip Zelikow was
 the principal author of that report.
 		</p><p>And that report does a lot to move policy
 in the right direction on those issues. They're
 very complicated. And the Markle Commission is
 continuing its work and trying to develop a sort of
 a distributed intelligence framework where you have
 less top-down evaluation, the kind of thing that
 Brian had suggested earlier with the New York City
 police force and the other local police forces, but
 on an intelligence, computer-based intelligence
 system.
 		</p><p>I think it's very, very complicated and
 important that it be done, but I think that's the
 way it's got to be done, through experts. We've
 got people in the room, I'm privileged to be on
 that task force, who I don't even understand when
 they start talking about distributed networks and
 all these other things.
 
 		</p><p>And they clearly have a handle on how to
 use information and also how to control your
 seeking of information so that you maintain civil
 liberties. They have a handle on those issues that
 is really highly sophisticated at this stage in the
 private sector. And that's where we really have to
 turn to them and ask them to guide us in these
 very, very complicated issues.
 		</p><p>But don't forget, Congressman, that when
 you know who your enemy is and he's killed you a
 few times, you can sort of skip the dots on a
 particular incident and go take him out before he
 comes back and kills our people again. Don't
 forget that.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: There has to be an
 offensive and a defensive strategy.
 		</p><p>DR. SOFAER: Absolutely. That's right. I
 think that it is very hard to keep, it's so hard to
 keep the attention of commissions and government
 officials away from this process of examination,
 this going deeper and deeper into intelligence,
 trying to figure out things.
 
 		</p><p>There is a certain point at which that you
 have figured it out, you know what the issue is and
 who the enemy is. And when you get to that point,
 when you can indict someone twice, he had been
 indicted twice before 9/11, when you can do that,
 my God, you've waited around too long. You already
 solved the problem, you know who your enemy was.
 You know he is going to come kill you.
 		</p><p>I think this is an important point not
 just for this case but for other cases. There
 aren't that many big terrorist groups in the world.
 There are some. And you have got here, with Brian
 and Magnus, we've got here really two of the great
 experts on this. Magnus has written the work on
 Hizbollah. I mean, no one knows more about
 Hizbollah in the world, I don't think, than Magnus.
 		</p><p>And the fact of the matter is, there's
 Hizbollah, there's Islamic jihad, you know, you can
 make a list. It's not that long a list. And part
 of what you should do to keep America safe is focus
 on those people who say they hate us and they want
 to kill us, because those are the guys who are
 
 going to do it, Mr. Secretary.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: Magnus, let me draw
 you in here and ask for your international insight
 into this.
 You mentioned earlier about al Qaeda and
 other terrorist organizations, but specifically, I
 believe your words were that al Qaeda is dispersed
 from Afghanistan, but they're still an organization
 that has tentacles in a host of different places
 and are very much able to attack us from where
 they're going, whether that be in Indonesia or
 Malaysia or other parts of the world.
 		</p><p>Can you draw this out a little bit more
 clearly for us in terms of how we expect they have
 dispersed, where they are, and how this 90-country
 international coalition continues to focus on this
 international law on terrorism and what are the two
 or three most effective ways to do that?
 		</p><p>DR. RANSTORP: Well, let me say that from
 the American people's point of view, they can rest
 assured, from the international perspective of what
 I see, Europe, Europe's contribution, we have 500
 
 people in custody in Europe in many, many different
 countries, we have thwarted many plots, and that
 is that we are getting things right.
 		</p><p>Fortunately, unfortunately, 9/11 was the
 wake-up call for that. It was a tremendous secret
 war of intelligence hunters out there trying to
 learn as much as possible about al Qaeda, about how
 al Qaeda is changing from different regions.
 And of course, it is very difficult. It
 is not affected by the war against Iraq, rather,
 those are institutional linkages that are already,
 it's not affected in terms of the sharing and
 cooperation between a number of countries.
 		</p><p>There have been some countries that have
 been tremendously helpful. Among them, of course,
 Pakistan, but also Jordan, particularly Jordan's
 role in contributing, and not only protecting
 itself and its royal family, but also in
 illuminating our understanding of how the al Qaeda
 network works, alongside the Egyptians and other,
 shall we say, coalition partners. So we are
 getting things right, but there are also of course
 
 tremendous challenges because they do exist.
 		</p><p>Al Qaeda's network has a presence in over
 98 different countries around the world. It has a
 global reach. One of the areas we have not tackled
 very much is in America's own back yard, Latin
 America. We know that there has been some al Qaeda
 presence there.
 		</p><p>Of course, there are other problems there
 as well. There's a sort of al Qaeda elements,
 other Islamic extremist elements who are not only
 dispersed in Latin America but of course the world.
 		</p><p>It's a tremendously difficult issue.
 And I think one of the issues and one of
 the things that I put in my recommendation is that
 we should coordinate our response, particularly
 because terrorism is fusing together with organized
 crime and even ordinary crime, that we should put
 together our efforts, particularly within the U.S.
 structures, of the war on terrorism as well as the
 war on drugs, because as we speak right now, we
 dealt with Afghanistan, it was a huge blow for al
 Qaeda.
 
 		</p><p>The issue of reconstruction in Afghanistan
 is still a major issue. As we speak, there are
 Taliban and al Qaeda suspects flooding back into
 Afghanistan or using a large portion of the
 country. It's a lawless zone. It's a blind spot
 in this war of terrorism.
 		</p><p>And it's not just Afghanistan, it's not
 just in certain portions of Iran, it's not just the
 fact that Iran has facilitated al Qaeda transit out
 of that area. There are large proportions in the
 world where we do not have effective central
 authority, where the authority does not have the
 capability. And the United States have been not
 only hunting down al Qaeda cells but also providing
 antiterrorism assistance.
 		</p><p>The United States is the only country with
 global intelligence reach on a tremendous level.
 And I think that, you know, we may want to sort of
 do an inventory of how we can do things better, but
 I think that we have gone a long way of ensuring
 that al Qaeda will at lease not strike with ease
 against the American homeland or against U.S.
 
 citizens abroad.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: You mentioned the
 need for central authority. I think a half a dozen
 commissions throughout the 1990s have recommended
 the creation of a Director of National
 Intelligence, somebody with centralized power and
 authority within the intelligence community that
 has the responsibility for a budget, that can
 implement policy and, if they declare a war on
 terrorism or al Qaeda, they have the resources to
 marshal the intelligence community forward to get
 it done.
 		</p><p>Six or seven commissions have recommended
 it. We are probably moving in the other direction,
 in reality, from accomplishing that.
 Do you have views on whether or not,
 Professor, should we create a DNI, Mr. Jenkins, Mr.
 Ranstorp?
 		</p><p>DR. SOFAER: I'm not sure we should, Mr.
 Congressman. I think that our reluctance to be
 strong and act positively, actively in our self
 defense leads us sometimes to overwork on the
 
 passive measures to the point that we do create
 real threats to our civil liberties.
 I think that an active defense would
 facilitate, in fact, less reliance on internal
 control of our own citizens. And so I worry about
 setting up institutions in this country that would
 change the nature of our life.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: Mr. Jenkins?
 		</p><p>MR. JENKINS: First of all, I thought at
 one time we had created someone that was supposed
 to be in charge of the intelligence community and
 it didn't quite work out that way.
 		</p><p>There's a tendency, by the way, to try to
 approach a particularly gnarly problem like this
 one by the creation of some sort of a czar. This
 is a recurring theme in our governmental approach.
 I'm not sure. I'm not going to make a powerful
 argument against it, but I'm not automatically
 convinced that it provides an answer that simply a
 new organization or a new head of organization gets
 us there.
 		</p><p>There are rather procedural issues, there
 
 are issues of imperative, there are issues of
 incentives that I think we have to address quite
 apart from the issue of government reorganization.
 The fact is, my own view is that we do
 have the basic building blocks now to do this
 thing. We are making progress. We do have to
 improve and we will improve as we go along. Every
 time we create another entity, that may expand our
 capabilities in one sense, but at the same time, it
 becomes a distraction.
 		</p><p>I mean, I'm not going to argue against the
 creation of a Homeland Security Department.
 Bringing together is a good idea, but at the same
 time, how it is going to function, how it is
 actually going to integrate them in this major
 post-merger environment now that has been created,
 and effectively operate, that becomes, that almost
 tends to slow you down somewhat in terms of dealing
 with the actual process that we want to deal with.
 		</p><p>So as I say, I'm not going to argue against it, but
 I'm not sure an Intelligence Czar or a
 Counterterrorist Czar is automatically going to get
 
 us there.
 		</p><p>I do think, and this is a cultural
 problem, it's not a government-organizational
 problem, that we, being a very pragmatic nation,
 that we like to view things in terms of finite
 achievement -- there's a problem, we identify the
 problem, we solve the problem, move on to the next
 problem -- and that we are so desperate for closure
 after September 11th that we're looking for some
 way, organizationally, that we can put the lid on
 this thing and say we have now solved that, we are
 now moving on.
 		</p><p>Instead what I think our message is here,
 and I'm not putting words in the mouths of my
 colleagues here, but that this is an open-ended
 thing we're engaged in here. Our pursuit of al
 Qaeda itself must be unrelenting. If it takes us
 two years, if it takes us 20 years, this enterprise
 must be destroyed to reduce its capabilities to
 attack us and also as a lesson to other
 organizations around the world, that if you do
 this, this will be the response of the United
 
 States and we will spend the rest of our lives
 hunting you down.
 		</p><p>At the same time, where we can
 appropriately use the term "war", and I think
 language needs to be precise here, where we can
 appropriately use the term "war" for dealing with
 an al Qaeda or its successors, that we're also
 simultaneously engaged in an effort to improve the
 security of our homeland against catastrophes like
 9/11.
 		</p><p>And as I pointed out here, that's going to
 take certain kinds of strategies, both intelligence
 strategies, response strategies, infrastructure,
 the way we do security, to do it in a way that
 doesn't cripple our own economy, that doesn't
 create some sort of a neo-medieval society where we
 spend the rest of our lives living under the
 kitchen table.
 		</p><p>At the same time, another court of our
 activity must be to combat terrorism. Now here the
 verb is important. Combat implies an enduring
 task. We're going to do the things that we can
 
 internationally to improve the exchange of
 intelligence, to improve travel documentation, to
 improve border security, aviation security, all of
 the things, financial controls, all of the things
 that we can do to make the environment
 operationally more difficult for the terrorists,
 whatever group they belong to.
 		</p><p>We are doing all these things
 simultaneously, some we will succeed. Ultimately,
 we will destroy al Qaeda. These other tasks that
 we're talking about, these are tasks that are going
 to take years, probably decades.
 		</p><p>And there will be other commissions to
 follow this one that will be examining and making
 useful contributions to improve things along the
 way. But the notion that we can come up to some
 moment and say, we have won, the terrorists have
 lost, probably not in my lifetime.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: Sir?
 		</p><p>DR. RANSTORP: I think Brian echoed
 exactly my sentiment in terms of looking at this as
 a ceaseless struggle. I think there is, from the
 
 outside, I have to preface my comments as being an
 outsider, a foreigner to the United States, that
 there's an over-tendency to look at trying to
 hermetically seal the U.S. or immunize itself from
 a future attack.
 		</p><p>It's important that we do the work that
 has been done so far in terms of homeland security,
 in terms of the possibility of centralizing
 intelligence, in making intelligence flow, not just
 from the top between different agencies but also,
 as Brian said earlier, more importantly, the front
 line of defense, the local law-enforcement
 officers, the police, equipping them with the right
 equipment.
 		</p><p>I think, thinking back, and I was in the
 United States in 1998 on the day on which President
 Clinton ordered air strikes against Afghanistan and
 instituted some protective measures, in part to try
 to protect the U.S. against what I would call
 catastrophic terrorism, but I would have to say
 this, that we have to balance our protective
 measures, our defensive measures, with more
 
 aggressive preemptive action.
 		</p><p>I mean, logic would prevail that once they
 start moving towards the target, we've already lost
 half the battle. And therefore, we have to work on
 multilateral cooperation, we have to work on making
 it as difficult as possible, we have to create the
 sense of insecurity for the adversary, for al
 Qaeda, so that they're not able to plan
 undisturbed, but they also have to worry about
 their own security and the fact that they may
 become apprehended by the U.S. in the future.
 		</p><p>Therefore, I think, you know, we have gone
 a long way towards getting it right. A lot of the
 measures we don't see because they're occurring in
 the quiet, occurring in the intelligence sphere.
 Therefore, you know, on the one hand, we're
 creating different structures and trying to
 centralize different decisions, pooling
 intelligence and intelligence analysis, but there's
 a tremendous force, an unseen force out there that
 are hunting these people down, that will seek
 justice, no matter how long it will take.
 
 		</p><p>And that goes not only for al Qaeda but
 also for those forces that killed the U.S. Marines
 in '93.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: At the end of the
 day, this Commission will be about some
 recommendations. And what I am hearing very
 clearly from you is that part of those
 recommendations might be in fact communicating to
 the American people that this war, this combatting
 terrorism, as Mr. Jenkins says, one needs the sense
 of urgency that we have when our troops go into
 Afghanistan or Iraq, and secondly, that this is
 long-term, almost ceaseless struggle, that will
 take a lot of time, that despite the
 recommendations that this Commission makes in May
 of 2004, al Qaeda may be out there in 2014. I see
 you nodding.
 		</p><p>MR. JENKINS: If not al Qaeda, the son of
 al Qaeda or the grandson of al Qaeda or some other
 enterprise.
 		</p><p>Look, we have been dealing with terrorism,
 fortunately not at the scale of 9/11, for many,
 
 many years. And it's not because of an absence of
 intelligent people who have been addressing this
 topic, it's because this is a very, very big
 challenge. This thing is going to go on. It's not
 simply going to be a matter of how we can
 reorganize our intelligence collection or how many
 National Guardsmen we can deploy or how much
 concrete we can pour around every identifiable
 piece of critical infrastructure we have in this
 country.
 		</p><p>Ultimately, it is going to be our own
 sense of urgency, our own tenacity, our own
 determination, our own courage, to a certain
 extent, our own stoicism about accepting that there
 are going to be some failures, there are going to
 be some losses, and in the process -- and I think
 this is very, very important because it's long-term
 and because we are America -- our own continuing
 commitment to the values for which this country
 stands.
 		</p><p>It's not something that we can simply
 reorganize, toss the values, forget the rules, and
 
 go off and blast away and fix things up and come
 back and restore the old rules and say we'll go
 back to whatever normality was on September 10,
 2001. We don't get to go back. It is a different
 world. It is a long-term contest. And so we
 better do it in a way that we can maintain the
 sense of values.
 		</p><p>I'm not saying we don't change the rules.
 We can change rules. Every country that has dealt
 with terrorism has been obliged to change the rules
 of detention, of intelligence gathering, of trial
 procedures, but the countries of Europe that have
 done this, they have done this as democracies and
 remained democracies.
 		</p><p>We can do the same, but we cannot, we
 cannot violate fundamentally those rules and
 maintain the support we will need domestically and
 internationally for what promises to be a long-term
 struggle.
 		</p><p>DR. SOFAER: I would agree with all that,
 Mr. Congressman. I just want to say that I think
 this Commission should make it clear that the duty
 
 to protect and defend the American people includes,
 very explicitly, the duty to go out and stop a
 known enemy that has killed Americans from doing it
 again, that that duty is a clear, precise duty.
 		</p><p>You're not supposed to sit in Washington
 with a bunch of experts trying to make dots and
 connect ideas to figure out when someone is going
 to kill you and where he's going to do it if you
 know there's someone out there that is determined
 to do it and capable of doing it and you know where
 he is.
 		</p><p>So this Commission should, I think, make
 it clear that presidents don't have the option of
 sitting back and playing that game, that part of
 fighting terrorism is that when you know there's an
 enemy who rises up to kill you, and the words that
 should be familiar to all of us in all three of our
 religions, that you rise up and kill him first.
 		</p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: I'm going to interrupt
 this shortly because we have already kept our panel
 more than we expected.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: Thank you for your
 
 patience.
 		</p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Do you have anymore
 questions?
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: No, I'm all done.
 Thank you very much. I want to thank the panel,
 too. You've been terrific.
 		</p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Senator, you have a
 question?
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER CLELAND: Mr. Jenkins, all of
 you, you've been eloquent to a fault. Thank you
 very much.
 		</p><p>Mr. Jenkins, right at the end of your
 incredible, wonderful presentation, you talked
 about, in effect, defeating al Qaeda, that is a
 specific goal, they did rise up to kill us and did,
 and they declared war on us. And I couldn't agree
 more. Then you went to combatting terrorism.
 		</p><p>What that reminded me of was an experience
 I had in Malaya, or now it's Malaysia. I was in
 Vietnam, '67, '68, fighting guerillas, terrorists,
 suicide bombers and the like, took a little R &amp; R
 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and read a book called
 
 The Long, Long War. It was about the British
 experience in combatting guerrillas, terrorists,
 suicide bombers. And one of the things they
 learned was that the terrorist doesn't lose, he
 wins. The terrorist doesn't lose, he wins.
 		</p><p>So for those who came after us, you're
 exactly right, and that's specific. We know who
 did it and we must kill or capture them or else
 they will do it again. What little I know about al
 Qaeda, that is true. Within the combating of
 terrorism, doing what you can in terms of strategic
 offensive abroad, strategic defensive at home, that
 is the long, long war.
 		</p><p>What I want to pose to you is a couple of
 problems with this. One of the problems is that in
 terms of stirring up the bee hive, Mr. Ranstorp,
 your point about the Hizbollah, it seems to me that
 Osama bin Laden deliberately has stirred up the bee
 hive to create an overreaction by Western
 democracies, particularly America, so that we would
 then trigger more recruits for his jihad.
 		</p><p>In his declaration of war, for instance,
 
 bin Laden states that the stationing of American
 forces on the soil of the Arabian Peninsula
 constitutes the greatest aggression committed
 against the Muslims since the death of the prophet
 Mohammed in AD 632. Well, we don't believe that,
 but that's his rhetoric.
 		</p><p>The point being, is it your understanding,
 Mr. Jenkins, that to the extent to which we
 increase our footprint on Arab soil, Muslim soil,
 and appear to be the Crusaders of old trying to
 take over Islamic lands, which fulfills his
 rhetoric, that as we do that, we stand in
 difficulty or difficult trouble, or potentially
 potential trouble of creating really a backlash
 against us and more terrorist activity?
 		</p><p>Talk to me a little bit about it. We
 created an air base in Saudi Arabia and one in
 Iraq. We have a presence in the Middle East in
 many, many ways. Talk to me a little bit about the
 potential dangers that you see about increasing
 what -- another article is called the Pax Americana
 in the Middle East -- and how that could possibly
 
 generate a greater terrorist threat ultimately in
 terms of a backlash against us.
 		</p><p>MR. JENKINS: This is not easy because
 this is a balance and, as you know, policy is
 always a matter of trade-offs. To not respond
 forcefully to the events of September 11th, to me,
 would have been unimaginable. In responding,
 whether it's responding to September 11th or
 whether it's what we are currently engaged in in
 Iraq, clearly unavoidably, does raise risks. It
 raises risks that our opponents will be able to
 exploit these, we know they will, in order to
 increase their recruiting.
 		</p><p>So the challenge for us becomes can we
 respond forcibly and effectively in a way without
 signalling a desire for dominion, a desire for
 Imperialist rule, a desire, communicating the
 desire that we wish to remake the world in our, in
 our image or in anything that suggests that we're
 opposed to a religion. Now that is hard to do.
 I'm not sure that there's a single formulaic answer
 to that specific question.
 
 		</p><p>By the way, the question to our opponents
 would be unimaginable, it would be utterly bizarre
 because while we may say that we're not engaged in
 a war on Islam, correctly so in that we're not
 interested in dominion and that we make separations
 between what people believe and how they behave and
 we respond to how they behave to us, these
 bifurcations of a spiritual world of belief, of
 political developments, are completely foreign to
 them. This is all of a single piece. So can we
 operate in this territory and do it.
 		</p><p>In Afghanistan, although we're not home
 yet in Afghanistan, in Afghanistan we were
 successful. We used military force, we destroyed
 al Qaeda bases. And there was no uprising of
 Islam. There was no worldwide surge in terrorism
 against us as a consequence, as a consequence of
 this.
 		</p><p>Now, as I say, we're not there yet. And
 one of the things that we also have to figure out
 how to do to ensure, and I think a mistake made the
 first time around in dealing with Afghanistan is
 
 that probably, without being Imperialists, we can't
 afford to leave too many black holes on the planet,
 can't afford to have too many badlands where these
 type of things can find a petri dish they need to
 grow and survive.
 		</p><p>So we're going to have to actively go out
 and, in one way or another, not always with Special
 Forces or smart bombs or other applications of
 military force, we're going to find out how to
 address some of these.
 		</p><p>That doesn't mean straying off into what
 to me is illusions about addressing root causes.
 It is not demonstrable that there's any causal
 relationship between poverty and terrorism. We
 will address, we will address poverty in the world,
 we will address lack of education, we will address
 political oppression because it's the right thing
 to do, not because we have any illusions that it is
 going to end terrorism.
 		</p><p>As I say, in doing so, we run these risks,
 but I think we have to take these one at a time and
 get them right.
 
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER CLELAND: Mr. Ranstorp?
 		</p><p>DR. RANSTORP: Connecting with what Brian
 said, I think the environment is such that we're
 moving towards greater complexity. I mean,
 unfortunately, if you look at the Middle East, for
 example, U.S. economists have estimated it will
 take economic growth rate five times that of the
 United States to get the region on an even keel.
 		</p><p>There's been a youth explosion. There's
 been demographic growth. There's no link between
 poverty and terrorism, yet it's that environment
 which so easily lends itself to certain radical
 nodes of radical Islam. I think that we have,
 following 9/11, we addressed many of those issues.
 We are aware of them.
 		</p><p>We do not have the capability of reaching
 into so-called black spots. We're simply not
 perhaps developing our own capabilities, but we're
 outsourcing this. This is not just the United
 States' problem, this is a Western problem, not
 just a U.S. problem, but also a European problem.
 And therefore, we're working hand in hand in trying
 
 to alleviate this.
 		</p><p>But we have tremendous challenges. I
 think one of the issues particularly we have to
 grapple with is the global feeling of
 anti-Americanism, in using public diplomacy to much
 greater effect, in thinking ahead about tactics and
 strategies, explaining better to the world why
 American is doing what it is doing.
 		</p><p>And you can see that's happening now as an
 integral part of the war against Iraq. In the war
 against the hearts and minds and the war against
 Islamic extremism, it's very difficult to do, but
 it has to be done at some level. It has to be, it
 has to be confronted.
 		</p><p>I have spent 15 years working, mapping
 Islamic extremists. And let me say that one of the
 issues where it is both the strength and the
 weakness which we have to tackle with greater
 ingenuity and innovation is the issue of their
 legitimacy. We have to tackle at the root heart
 their legitimacy. And there are many ways one can
 do that, but it will take a greater ingenuity. It
 
 has to take greater effort. And it is not going to
 be an easy road ahead.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER CLELAND: Thank you, Mr.
 Chairman. 
 		</p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Thank you. Mr.
 Commissioner Ben-Veniste.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE: I know it's
 getting late.
 		</p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: This is going to be the
 last question, just to let these people go.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE: Also a biblical
 expression. Both Judge Sofaer and Mr. Jenkins have
 commented on the concept of creating a new domestic
 intelligence agency from different perspectives.
 Judge Sofaer, you have mentioned that you
 opposed it, and one of the reasons that you stated
 was because of the greater threat to civil
 liberties. And Mr. Jenkins said that he thought
 that the basic building blocks to do the work were
 there.
 		</p><p>And perhaps that ties into the
 extraordinary presentation of Miss Kleinberg
 earlier this morning. She talked about all of the
 
 things that were missed by our intelligence
 agencies that could have, in fact, on the basis of
 information in hand, had they been working
 cooperatively and done the work that was expected
 of them, could have identified at least some of the
 terrorists involved in 9/11.
 		</p><p>I wonder whether you would each expand
 upon that because one of the major objectives I
 think we have in making our ultimate
 recommendations will be related to whether a new
 system of domestic intelligence should be
 instituted or whether in fact we can make do with
 what we have with significant improvement.
 		</p><p>DR. SOFAER: I think the latter. I think
 we can make do with what we have with significant
 improvements. I think we ought to use DHS more
 than going back to the FBI and CIA. I think that
 we're not going to make much progress if we rely on
 those agencies exclusively.
 		</p><p>I think the list of failures and
 opportunities that the Joint Committee has put
 together with Miss Hill, her report has been very
 
 impressive. And I can't imagine that the
 Commission needs to spend a lot of time building on
 that record.
 		</p><p>I mean, it's just clear that we lost, we
 missed a lot of opportunities. And I think we can
 do a lot to correct that if we don't rely
 exclusively on the same agencies that missed those
 opportunities, incidentally, without any
 accountability whatsoever. There's be no
 accountability whatsoever for those missed
 opportunities.
 		</p><p>MR. JENKINS: Again, I think we could have
 done it better prior to September 11th. I'm not
 sure that that would have prevented the September
 11th attack. I just don't know that. Putting
 aside the issue of whether could have or could not
 have identified the attack coming, how do we
 approach this, how do we approach it now.
 I notice that you used the word, can we
 make the system better. I think you said system.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE: That supposes a
 fact that perhaps is not yet in evidence.
 
 		</p><p>MR. JENKINS: That is, my point is that I
 think there's a key word there that we want to
 focus on, can we make this into a system and how do
 we achieve that. It's not a question of can we
 create another entity or not create another entity.
 That, to me, is a tactical question, it's a
 how-you-get-there question.
 		</p><p>The root, how do we create a system out of
 the capabilities that we have now and that we can
 reasonably create? We can enhance those
 capabilities. There's a variety of ways we can do
 that, one of which I have indicated already, but
 how do we procedurally, what is the machinery for
 creating a system?
 		</p><p>If that requires a new entity, then so be
 it. I'm not convinced that it does yet, but I am
 persuaded that we need to do something to bring
 about a system.
 		</p><p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE: Mr. Ranstorp,
 do you care to comment?
 		</p><p>DR. RANSTORP: No, I totally agree that
 there has to be an integrated system. I think
 
 we're on our way there. I think though within,
 this is the European experience, within bearing in
 mind civil liberties, I think that cannot be the
 casualty of any system. I think protecting and
 preserving them is something that we all cherish.
 		</p><p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Dr. Sofaer, Mr. Jenkins,
 Mr. Ranstorp, thank you very, very much for the
 enlightening discussion. We are adjourned until
 9:00 tomorrow morning.
