 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XX</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 The story saith that King Arthur goeth his way and Lancelot and
 Messire Gawain with him, and they had ridden so far one day that
 night came on in a forest and they might find no hold.  Messire
 Gawain marvelled him much that they had ridden the day long
 without finding neither hold nor hermitage.  Night was come and
 the sky was dark and the forest full of gloom.  They knew not
 whitherward to turn to pass the night.
 </p><p>
 "Lords," saith the King, "Where may we be able to alight to-
 night?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, we know not, for this forest is fight wearisome."
 </p><p>
 They make the squire climb up a tall tree and tell him to look as
 far as he may to try whether he may espy any hold or house where
 they may lodge.  The squire looketh on all sides, and then
 telleth them he seeth a fire a long way off as if it were in a
 waste house, but that he seeth nought there save the fire and the
 house.
 </p><p>
 "Take good heed," saith Lancelot, "in which quarter it is, so
 that you may know well how to lead us thither."
 </p><p>
 He saith that right eath may he lead them.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 With that he cometh down and mounteth again on his hackney, and
 they go forward a great pace and ride until they espy the fire
 and the hold.  They pass on over a bridge of wattles, and find
 the courtyard all deserted and the house from within great and
 high and hideous.  But there was a great fire within whereof the
 heat might be felt from afar.  They alight of their horses, and
 the squire draweth them on one side amidst the hall, and the
 knights set them beside the fire all armed.  The squire seeth a
 chamber in the house and entereth thereinto to see if he may find
 any meat for the horses, but he cometh forth again the swiftest
 he may and crieth right sweetly on the Mother of the Saviour.
 They ask him what aileth him, and he saith that he hath found the
 most treacherous chamber ever he found yet, for he felt there,
 what with heads and what with hands, more than two hundred men
 dead, and saith that never yet felt he so sore afeared.  Lancelot
 went into the chamber to see whether he spake true, and felt the
 men that lay dead, and groped among them from head to head and
 felt that there was a great heap of them there, and came back and
 sate at the fire all laughing.  The King asketh whether the 
 squire had told truth.  Lancelot answereth him yea, and that
 never yet had he found so many dead men together.
 </p><p>
 "Methinketh," saith Messire Gawain, "Sith that they are dead we
 have nought to fear of them, but God protect us from the living."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 While they were talking thus, behold you a damsel that cometh
 into the dwelling on foot and all alone, and she cometh lamenting
 right grievously.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, God!" saith she, "How long a penance is this for me, and
 when will it come to an end?"
 </p><p>
 She seeth the knights sitting in the midst of the house.  "Fair
 Lord God," saith she, "Is he there within through whom I am to
 escape from this great dolour?"
 </p><p>
 The knights hearken to her with great wonderment.  They look and
 see her enter within the door, and her kirtle was all torn with
 thorns and briars in the forest.  Her feet were all bleeding for
 that she was unshod.  She had a face of exceeding great beauty.
 She carried the half of a dead man, and cast it into the chamber
 with the others.  She knew Lancelot again so soon as she saw him. 
 </p><p>
 "Ha, God !" saith she, "I am quit of my penance!  Sir," saith
 she, "Welcome may you be, you and your company!"
 </p><p>
 Lancelot looketh at her in wonderment.  "Damsel," saith he, "Are
 you a thing on God's behalf?"
 </p><p>
 "Certes, Sir," saith she, "Yea!  nor be you adread of nought!  I
 am the Damsel of the Castle of Beards, that was wont to deal with
 knights so passing foully as you have seen.  You did away the
 toll that was levied on the knights that passed by, and you lay
 in the castle that demanded it of them that passed through the
 demesne thereof.  But you had me in covenant that so the Holy
 Graal should appear unto you, you would come back to me, for
 otherwise never should I have been willing to let you go.  You
 returned not, for that you saw not the Graal.  For the shame that
 I did to knights was this penance laid upon me in this forest and
 this manor, to last until such time as you should come.  For the
 cruelty I did them was sore grievous, for never was knight
 brought to me but I made his nose be cut off or his eyes thrust
 out, and some were there as you saw that had their feet or their
 hands stricken off.  Now have I paid full dear thereof since, for
 needs must I carry into this chamber all the knights that are
 slain in this forest, and within this manor must I cast them
 according to the custom thereof, alone, without company; and this
 knight that I carried in but now hath lain so long in the forest
 that wild beasts have eaten half of his body.  Now am I quit of 
 this foul penance, thanks to God and to you, save only that I
 must go back when it shall be daylight in like manner as I came
 here."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Lancelot, "Right glad am I that we should have
 come to lodge the night here within, for love of you, for I never
 saw I damsel that might do so cruel penance."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "You know not yet what it is, but you will know
 it ere long this night, both you and your fellows, and the Lord
 God shield you from death and from mischief!  Every night cometh
 a rout of knights that are black and foul and hideous, albeit
 none knoweth whence they come, and they do battle right sore the
 one against other, and the stour endureth of a right long while;
 but one knight that came within yonder by chance, the first night
 I came hither, in like manner as you have come, made a circle
 round me with his sword, and I sate within it as soon as I saw
 them coming, and so had I no dread of them, for I had in
 remembrance the Saviour of the World and His passing sweet
 Mother.  And you will do the same, and you believe me herein, for
 these are knights fiends."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot draweth his sword and maketh a great circle round the
 house-place, and they were within.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, behold you the knights that come through the forest
 with such a rushing as it seemed they would rend it all up by the
 roots.  Afterward, they enter into the manor and snatch great
 blazing firebrands and fling them one at another.  They enter
 into the house battling together, and are keen to fall upon the
 knights, but they may not.  They hurl the firebrands at them from
 afar, but they are holding their shields and their swords naked.
 Lancelot maketh semblant as though he would leap towards them,
 and sore great cowardize it seemeth him nor to go against them. 
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel, "Take heed that you go not forth of the
 circle, for you will be in sore jeopardy of death, for well you
 see what evil folk be these."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot was nor minded to hold himself back, but that he would
 go toward them sword drawn, and they run upon him on all sides,
 but he defendeth him stoutly and smiteth the burning firebrands
 so that he maketh red-hot charcoal fly, and thrusreth his sword
 amidst their faces.  King Arthur and Messire Gawain leap up to
 help Lancelot and smite upon these evil folk and cut them limb
 from limb, and they bellow like fiends so that the whole forest
 resoundeth thereof.  And when they fell to the ground, they may
 no longer endure, but become fiends and ashes, and their bodies
 and their horses become devils all black in the shape of ravens
 that come forth of their bodies.  They marvel right sore what
 this may be, and say that such hostel is right grievous.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 When they had put them all to the worse, they sate them down
 again and rested; but scarce were they seated or ever another
 rout of yet blacker folk came about them, and they bare spears
 burning and flaming, and many of them carried dead knights that
 they had slain in the forest, and dropped them in the midst of
 the house, and then bid the damsel carry and set them with the
 others.  Howbeit, she answereth that she is quit of their
 commandment and service, nor no longer is forced to do nought for
 them sith that she hath done her penance.  They thrust forward
 their spears toward the King and the two knights, as though they
 were come to avenge their companions; but they all three leapt up
 together and attacked them right stoutly.  But this rout was
 greater and of knights more hideous.  They began to press the
 King and his knights hard, and they might not put them to the
 worse as they did the others.  And while they were thus in the
 thickest of the conflict, they heard the stroke of a bell
 sounding, and forthwith the knight fiends departed and hurried
 away a great pace.
 </p><p>
 "Lords," saith the damsel, "Had this sound not been heard, scarce
 might you have endured, for yet another huge rout of this folk
 was coming in such sort as that none might have withstood them,
 and this sound have I heard every night, whereby my life hath
 been saved."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII.
 </p><p>
 Josephus telleth us that as at this time was there no bell
 neither in Greater Britain nor in Lesser; but folk were called
 together by a horn, and in many places there were sheets of
 steel, and in other places clappers of wood.  King Arthur
 marvelled him much of this sound, so clear and sweet was it, and
 it well seemed him that it came on God's behalf, and right fain
 was he to see a bell and so he might.  They were the night until
 the morrow in the house, as I tell you.  The damsel took leave of
 them and so departed.  As they came forth of the hold, they met
 three hermits that told them they were going to search for the
 bodies that were in this manor so that they might bury them in a
 waste chapel that was hard by, for such knights had lain there as
 that henceforward the haunting of the evil folk would be stayed
 in such sort as that they would have no more power to do hurt to
 any, wherefore they would set therewithin a worshipful hermit
 that should build up the place in holiness for the service of
 God.  The King was right joyful thereof, and told them that it
 had been too perilous.  They parted from the hermits and entered
 into a forest, nor was there never a day so long as King Arthur
 was on pilgrimage, so saith the history, but he heard the sound
 of one single bell every hour, whereof he was right glad.  He
 bade Messire Gawain and Lancelot that they should everywhere
 conceal his name, and that they should call him not Lord but
 Comrade.  They yielded him his will, and prayed to Our Lord that
 he would guide and lead them to such a castle and such a hostel
 as that they might be lodged honourably therein.  They rode on
 until evening drew nigh, and they found a right fair hold in the
 forest, whereinto they entered and alighted.  The damsel of the
 hold came to meet them and made them right great cheer, then made
 them be disarmed, afterward bringeth them right rich robes to
 wear.  She looketh at Lancelot and knoweth him again.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VIII.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "You had once, on a day that is past, right
 great pity of me, and saved me my honour, whereof am I in great
 unhappiness.  But better love I to suffer misease in honour, than
 to have plenty and abundance in shame or reproach, for shame
 endureth, but sorrow is soon overpassed."
 </p><p>
 Thereupon behold you the knight of the hold, whither he cometh
 from shooting in the forest and maketh carry in full great plenty
 venison of deer and wild boar.  He alighted to greet the knights,
 and began to laugh when he saw Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith he, "I know you well For you disappointed me
 of the thing I best loved in the world, and made me marry this
 damsel that never yet had joy of me, nor never shall have."
 </p><p>
 "Faith, Sir," saith Lancelot, "You will do your pleasure therein,
 for she is yours.  Truth it is that I made you marry her, for you
 were fain to do her a disgrace and a shame in such sort that her
 kinsfolk would have had shame of her."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the knight, "the damsel that I loved before
 loveth you no better hereof, nay, rather, fain would she procure
 your vexation and your hurt and your shame if she may, and great
 power hath she in this forest."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "I have sithence spoken to her and she to
 me, and so hath she told me her will and her wish."
 </p><p>
 Thereupon the knight bade the knights take water, and the lady
 taketh the basins and presenteth water to the knights.
 </p><p>
 "Avoid, damsel," saith the King, "Take it away!  Never, please
 God, shall it befall that we should accept such service from
 you."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the knight, "But so must you needs do, for
 other than she shall not serve you to-night in this matter, or
 otherwise shall you not eat with me this night there within."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IX.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot understandeth that the knight is not overburdened of
 courtesy, and he seeth the table garnished of good meat, and
 bethinketh him he will not do well to lose such ease, for misease
 enough had they the night before.  He maketh the King take water
 of the lady, and the same service did she for all of them.  The
 knight biddeth them be seated.  The King would have made the lady
 sit beside him at the table, but the knight said that there she
 should not sit.  She goeth to sit among the squires as she was
 wont to do.  The knights are sorry enough thereof, but they durst
 not gainsay the will of her lord.  When they had eaten, the
 knight said to Lancelot, "Now may you see what she hath gained of
 me by your making me take her perforce, nor never, so help me
 God, so long as I live shall she be honoured otherwise by me, for
 so have I promised her that I love far more."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "To my thinking you do ill herein and a
 sin, and meseemeth you should have great blame thereof of them
 that know it, and may your churlishness be your own, for nought
 thereof take I to myself."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 X.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot telleth the King and Messire Gawain that were he not
 lodged in his hostel, and had him outside of the hold, he would
 willingly have set the blood of his body on it but he would have
 handled him in such sort as that the lady should be maintained in
 greater honour, either by force or by prayer, in like manner as
 he did when he made him marry her.  They were right well lodged
 the night and lay in the hold until the morrow, when they
 departed thence, and rode right busily on their journeys until
 they came into a very different land, scarce inhabited of any
 folk, and found a little castle in a combe.  They came
 thitherward and saw that the enclosure of the castle was fallen
 down into an abysm, so that none might approach it on that side,
 but it had a right fair gateway and a door tall and wide whereby
 one entered.  They beheld a chapel that was right fair and rich,
 and below was a great ancient hall.  They saw a priest appear in
 the midst of the castle, bald and old, that had come forth of the
 chapel.  They are come thither and alighted, and asked the priest
 what the castle was, and he told them that it was the great
 Tintagel.
 </p><p>
 "And how is this ground all caved in about the castle?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the priest, "I will tell you.  Sir," saith he, "King
 Uther Pendragon, that was father of King Arthur, held a great
 court and summoned all his barons.  The King of this castle that
 then was here was named Gorlois.  He went to the court and took
 his wife with him, that was named Ygerne, and she was the fairest
 dame in any kingdom.  King Uther sought acquaintance of her for
 her great beauty, and regarded her and honoured her more than all
 the others of his court.  King Gorlois departed thence and made
 the Queen come back to this castle for the dread that he had of
 King Uther Pendragon.  King Uther was very wroth with him, and
 commanded him to send back the Queen his wife.  King Godois said
 that he would not.  Thereupon King Uther Pendragon defied him,
 and then laid siege about this castle where the Queen was.  King
 Gorlois was gone to seek for succour.  King Uther Pendragon had
 Merlin with him of whom you have heard tell, that was so crafty.
 He made him be changed into the semblance of King Gorlois, so
 that he entered there within by Merlin's art and lay that night
 with the Queen, and so begat King Arthur in a great hall that was
 next to the enclosure there where this abysm is.  And for this
 sin hath the ground sunken in on this wise."
 </p><p>
 He cometh with them toward the chapel that was right fair, and
 had a right rich sepulchre therein.
 </p><p>
 "Lords, in this sepulchre was placed the body of Merlin, but
 never mought it be set inside the chapel, wherefore perforce it
 remained outside.  And know of a very truth that the body lieth
 not within the sepulchre, for, so soon as it was set therein, it
 was taken out and snatched away, either on God's behalf or the
 Enemy's, but which we know not."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XI.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith King Arthur, "And what became of King Gorlois?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir." saith he, "The King slew him on the morrow of the night he
 lay with his wife, and so forthwith espoused Queen Ygerne, and in
 such manner as I tell you was King Arthur conceived in sin that
 is now the best King in the world."
 </p><p>
 King Arthur hath heard this as concerning his birth that he knew
 not, and is a little shamed thereof and confounded on account of
 Messire Gawain and Lancelot.  He himself marvelleth much thereof,
 and much it misliketh him that the priest hath said so much. They
 lay the night in the hold, and so departed thence on the morrow
 when they had heard mass.  Lancelot and Messire Gawain, that
 thought they knew the forest, found the land so changed and
 different that they knew not whither they were become, and such
 an one as should come into the land that had been King
 Fisherman's, and he should come again another time within forty
 days, should not find the castle within a year.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XII.
 </p><p>
 Josephus telleth us that the semblances of the islands changed
 themselves by reason of the divers adventures that by the
 pleasure of God befell therein, and that the quest of adventures
 would not have pleased the knights so well and they had not found
 them so different.  For, when they had entered into a forest or
 an island where they had found any adventure, and they came there
 another time, they found holds and castles and adventures of
 another kind, so that their toils and travails might not weary
 them, and also for that God would that the land should be
 conformed to the New Law.  And they were the knights that had
 more toil and travail in seeking adventures than all the knights
 of the world before them, and in holding to that whereof they had
 made covenant; nor of no court of no king in the world went forth
 so many good knights as went forth from the court of King Arthur,
 and but that God loved them so much, never might they have
 endured such toil and travail as they did from day to day; for
 without fait, good knights were they, and good knights not only
 to deal hard buffets, but rather in that they were loyal and
 true, and had faith in the Saviour of the World and His sweet
 Mother, and therefore dreaded shame and loved honour.  King
 Arthur goeth on his way and Messire Gawain and Lancelot with him,
 and they pass through many strange countries, and so enter into a
 great forest.  Lancelot called to remembrance the knight that he
 had slain in the Waste City whither behoved him to go, and knew
 well that the day whereon he should come was drawing nigh.  He
 told King Arthur as much, and then said, that and he should go
 not, he would belie his covenant.  They rode until they came to a
 cross where the ways forked.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "Behoveth me go to acquit me of my pledge,
 and I go in great adventure and peril of death, nor know I
 whether I may live at all thereafter, for I slew the knight,
 albeit I was right sorry thereof, but or ever I slew him, I had
 to swear that I would go set my head in the like jeopardy as he
 had set his.  Now the day draweth nigh that I must go thither,
 for I am unwilling to fail of my covenant, whereof I should be
 blamed, and, so God grant me to escape therefrom, I will follow
 you speedily."
 </p><p>
 The King embraceth him and kisseth him at parting and Messire
 Gawain also, and they pray God preserve his body and his life,
 and that they may see him again ere it be long.  Lancelot would
 willingly have sent salute to the Queen had he durst, for she lay
 nearer his heart than aught beside, but he would not that the
 King nor Messire Gawain should misdeem of the love they might
 carry to their kinswoman.  The love is so rooted in his heart
 that he may not leave it, into what peril soever he may go;
 rather, he prayeth God every day as sweetly as he may, that He
 save the Queen, and that he may deliver his body from this
 jeopardy.  He hath ridden until that he cometh at the hour of
 noon into the Waste City, and findeth the city empty as it was
 the first time he was there.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIII.
 </p><p>
 In the city wherein Lancelot had arrived were many waste houses
 and rich palaces fallen down.  He had scarce entered within the
 city when he heard a great cry and lamentation of dames and
 damsels, but he knew not on which side it was, and they say: "Ha,
 God, how hath the knight betrayed us that slew the knight,
 inasmuch as he returneth not!  This day is the day come that he
 ought to redeem his pledge!  Never again ought any to put trust
 in knight, for that he cometh not!  The others that came hither
 before him have failed us, and so will he also for dread of
 death; for he smote off the head of the comeliest knight that was
 in this kingdom and the best, wherefore ought he also to have his
 own smitten off, but good heed taketh he to save it if he may!"
 </p><p>
 Thus spake the damsels.  Lancelot much marvelled where they might
 be, for nought could he espy of them, albeit he cometh before the
 palace, there where he slew the knight.  He alighteth, then
 maketh fast his horse's reins to a ring that was fixed in the
 mounting-stage of marble.  Scarce hath he done so, when a knight
 alighteth, tall and comely and strong and deliver, and he was
 clad in a short close-fitted jerkin of silk, and held the axe in
 his hand wherewith Lancelot had smitten off the head of the other
 knight, and he came sharpening it on a whetstone to cut the
 better.  Lancelot asketh him, "What will you do with this axe?"
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the knight, "That shall you know in such sort
 as my brother knew when you cut off his head, so I may speed of
 my business."
 </p><p>
 "How?" saith Lancelot, "Will you slay me then?"
 </p><p>
 "That shall you know," saith he, "or ever you depart hence.  Have
 you not loyally promised hereof that you would set your head in
 the same jeopardy as the knight set his, whom you slew without
 defence?  And no otherwise may you depart therefrom.  Wherefore
 now come forward without delay and kneel down and stretch your
 neck even as my brother did, and so will I smite off your head,
 and, if you do nor this of your own good will, you shall soon
 find one that shall make you do it perforce, were you twenty
 knights as good as you are one.  But well I know that you have
 not come hither for this, but only to fulfil your pledge, and
 that you will raise no contention herein."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot thinketh to die, and is minded to abide by that he hath
 in covenant without fail, wherefore he lieth down on the ground
 as it were on a cross, and crieth mercy of God.  He mindeth him
 of the Queen, and crieth God of mercy and saith, "Ha, Lady" saith
 he, "Never shall I see you more!  but, might I have seen you yet
 once again before I die, exceeding great comfort had it been to
 me, and my soul would have departed from me more at ease.  But
 this, that never shall I see you more, as now it seemeth me,
 troubleth me more than the death whereby behoveth me to die, for
 die one must when one hath lived long enough.  But faithfully do
 I promise you that my love shall fail you not yet, and never
 shall it be but that my soul shall love you in the other world
 like as my body hath loved you in this, if thus the soul may
 love!"
 </p><p>
 With that the tears fell from his eyes, nor, never sithence that
 he was knight, saith the story, had he wept for nought that had
 befallen him nor for heaviness of heart, but this time and one
 other.  He taketh three blades of grass and so eateth thereof in
 token of the holy communion, then signeth him of the cross and
 blesseth him, riseth up, setteth himself on his knees and
 stretcheth forth his neck.  The knight lifteth up the axe.
 Lancelot heareth the blow coming, boweth his head and the axe
 misseth him.  He saith to him, "Sir Knight, so did not my brother
 that you slew; rather, he held his head and neck quite still, and
 so behoveth you to do!"
 </p><p>
 Two damsels appeared at the palace-windows of passing great
 beauty, and they knew Lancelot well.  So, as the knight was
 aiming a second blow, one of the damsels crieth to him, "And you
 would have my love for evermore, throw down the axe and cry the
 knight quit!  Otherwise have you lost me for ever!"
 </p><p>
 The knight forthwith flingeth down the axe and falleth at
 Lancelot's feet and crieth mercy of him as of the most loyal
 knight in the world.
 </p><p>
 "But you?  Have mercy on me, you!  and slay me not!" saith
 Lancelot, "For it is of you that I ought to pray mercy!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "Of a surety will I not do this!  Rather
 will I help you to my power to save your life against all men,
 for all you have slain my brother."
 </p><p>
 The damsels come down from the palace and are come to Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIV.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say they to Lancelot, "Greatly ought we to love you, yea,
 better than all knights in the world beside.  For we are the two
 damsels, sisters, that you saw so poor at the Waste Castle where
 you lay in our brother's house.  You and Messire Gawain and
 another knight gave us the treasure and the hold of the robber-
 knights that you slew; for this city which is waste and the Waste
 Castle of my brother would never again be peopled of folk, nor
 should we never have had the land again, save a knight had come
 hither as loyal as are you.  Full a score knights have arrived
 here by chance in the same manner as you came, and not one of
 them but hath slain a brother or a kinsman and cut off his head
 as you did to the knight, and each one promised to return at the
 day appointed; but all failed of their covenant, for not one of
 them durst come to the day; and so you had failed us in like
 manner as the others, we should have lost this city without
 recovery and the castles that are its appanages."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XV.
 </p><p>
 So the knight and the damsels lead Lancelot into the palace and
 then make him be disarmed.  They hear presently how the greatest
 joy in the world is being made in many parts of the forest, that
 was nigh the city.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say the damsels, "Now may you hear the joy that is made of
 your coming.  These are the burgesses and dwellers in the city
 that already know the tidings."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot leaneth at the windows of the hall, and seeth the city
 peopled of the fairest folk in the world, and great thronging in
 the broad streets and the great palace, and clerks and priests
 coming in long procession praising God and blessing Him for that
 they may now return to their church, and giving benison to the
 knight through whom they are free to repair thither.  Lancelot
 was much honoured throughout the city.  The two damsels are at
 great pains to wait upon him, and right great worship had he of
 all them that were therewithin and them that came thither, both
 clerks and priests.
