 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXVII</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 This history saith that the land of this King was full far away
 from the land of King Arthur, and that needs must he pass two
 seas or ever he should approach the first head of King Arthur's
 land.  He arrived in Albanie with great force of men with a great
 navy.  When they of the land knew it, they garnished them against
 him and defended their lands the best they might; then they sent
 word to King Arthur that King Madeglant was come in such manner
 into the land, with great plenty of folk, and that he should come
 presently to succour them or send them a knight so good as that
 he might protect them, and that in case he doth not so, the land
 will be lost.  When King Arthur understood these tidings, it was
 not well with him.  He asked his knights whom he might send
 thither.  And they say, let him send Lancelot thither, for that
 he is a worthy knight and a kingly, and much understandeth of
 war, and hath in him as much loyalty as hath ever another that
 they know.  The King maketh him come before him.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 "Lancelot," saith the King, "Such affiance have I in you and in
 your knighthood, that it is my will to send you to the furthest
 corner of my land, to protect it, with the approval of my
 knights, wherefore I pray and require you that you do your power
 herein as many a time have you done already in my service.  And I
 will give you in command forty knights."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "Against your will am I not minded to be,
 but in your court are there other knights full as good, or better
 than I, whom you might well send thither.  But I would not that
 you should hold this of cowardize in me, and right willingly will
 I do your pleasure, for none ought I to serve more willingly than
 you."
 </p><p>
 The King giveth him much thanks of this that he saith.  Lancelot
 departeth from the court, and taketh forty knights with him, and
 so cometh into the land of Albanie where King Madeglant hath
 arrived.  When they of the land knew that Lancelot was come,
 great joy had they thereof in their hearts, for ofttimes had they
 heard tell of him and of his good knighthood.  They were all at
 his commandment, and received him as their champion and
 protector.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 King Madeglant one day issued forth of his ships to do battle
 against Lancelot and them of the land.  Lancelot received him
 right stoutly, and slew many of his folk, and the more part fled
 and would fain have drawn them to their ships, but Lancelot and
 his people went after and cut a part of them to pieces.  King
 Madeglant, with as many of his men as he might, betaketh himself
 to his own ship privily, and maketh put to sea the soonest he
 may.  They that might not come to the ships remained on dry land,
 and were so cut up and slain.  Madeglant went his way
 discomfited.  Of ten ships full of men that he had brought he
 took back with him but two.  The land was in peace and assured in
 safety.  Lancelot remained there of a long space.  They of the
 country loved him much and gave themselves great joy of his
 valour and his great bounty, insomuch that most of them say
 ofttimes that they would fain have such a knight as was he for
 king, by the goodwill of King Arthur, for that the land is too
 far away; but and if he would set there a knight or other man
 that might protect the land, they would take it in right good
 part, and he should hold the land of him, for they might not
 safeguard it at their will without a champion, for that land
 without a lord may but little avail.  They of the land loved
 Lancelot well, as I tell you.  King Arthur was at Cardoil, and so
 were his knights together with him.  He thought to be assured in
 his kingdom and to live peaceably; but what time he sate at meat
 one day in Cardoil, behold you thereupon a knight that cometh
 before the Table Round without saluting him.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "Where is Lancelot?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the King to the knight, "He is not in this country."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the knight, "that misliketh me.  Wheresoever
 he be, he is your knight and of your household; wherefore King
 Claudas sendeth you word that he is his mortal enemy, and you
 also, if so be that for love of him you receive him from this day
 forward, for he hath slain his sister's son, Meliant of the Waste
 Manor, and he slew the father of Meliant likewise, but the father
 belongeth not to King Claudas.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 Meliant was the son of his sister-german, wherefore much grieveth
 he of his death."
 </p><p>
 "Sir knight," saith the King, "I know not how the covenant may be
 between them as of this that you tell me, but well know I that
 King Claudas holdeth many a castle that King Claudas ought not of
 right to have, whereof he disherited his father, but meet is it
 that each should conquer his own right.  But so much I tell you
 plainly, that never will I fail mine own knight and he be such as
 durst defend himself of murder, but and if he hath no will to do
 this, then well may I allow that right be done upon him.  But,
 sith that he will not love his own death, neither I nor other
 ought greatly to love him and he refuse to redress his wrong.
 When Lancelot shall know these tidings, I know well that such is
 his valour and his loyalty that he will readily answer in reason,
 and will do all that he ought to do to clear himself of such a
 charge."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "You have heard well that I have told
 you.  Once more, I tell you plainly, King Claudas sendeth you
 word that so you harbour his enemy henceforward and in such
 manner as you have done heretofore, he will be less than pleased
 with you."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 With that the knight departeth, and the King remaineth at
 Cardoil.  He sendeth for Briant of the Isles, his seneschal, and
 a great part of his knights, and demandeth counsel of them what
 he may do.  Messire Ywain saith that he killed Meliant in the
 King's service, as one that warred upon his land, albeit the King
 had done him no wrong, and had so made common cause with the
 King's enemies without demanding right in his court.  Nor never
 had Meliant appealed Lancelot of murder nor of treason, nor
 required him of the death of his father.  Rather, Lancelot slew
 him in open war, as one that warred upon his lord by wrong.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Ywain to the King, "Howsoever Lancelot might
 have wrought in respect of Meliant, your land ought not to be
 called to account, for you were not in the kingdom, nor knew not
 that either had done other any wrong, and therefore say I that
 King Claudas will do great wrong and he bring plaint or levy war
 against you on this account."
 </p><p>
 "Messire Ywain," saith Briant of the Isles, "matter of common
 knowledge is it that Lancelot slew the lord of the Waste Manor
 and Meliant his son after the contention that was betwixt King
 Arthur and me.  But, after that he had slain the father, he ought
 of right to have taken good heed that he did no wrong to the son,
 but rather ought he to have sought peace and accord."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 "Briant," saith Messire Gawain, "Lancelot is nor here; and,
 moreover, he is now on the King's business.  Well know you that
 Meliant came to you and that you made him knight, and that
 thereafter he warred upon the King's land without reasonable
 occasion.  The King was far away from the land as he that made
 pilgrimage to the Graal.  He was told tidings that his land was
 being put to the worse, and he sent Lancelot to protect it.  He
 accordingly maintained the war as best he might until such time
 as the King was returned.  Meliant knew well that the King was
 come back, and that never had he done wrong to none in his court
 that wished to demand right therein.  He neither came thither nor
 sent, either to do right or to demand right, whether he did so
 for despite or whether it was for that he knew not how to do it.
 In the meanwhile he warred upon the King, that had never done him
 a wrong nor refused to do him a right.  Lancelot slew him in the
 King's war and upon his land in defence thereof.  There was peace
 of the war, as was agreed on between you and the King, but and if
 any should therefore hold Lancelot to blame of the death of
 Meliant, meseemeth that therein is he wrong.  For the others are
 not held to answer for them that they slew; but and if you wish
 to say that Lancelot hath not slain him with reason, howsoever he
 may have wrought aforetime in respect of his father, I am ready
 to maintain his right by my body on behalf of his."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII.
 </p><p>
 "Messire Gawain," saith Briant of the Isles, "You will not as at
 this time find none that will take up your gage on account of
 this affair, nor ought any to make enemies of his friends, nor
 ought you to counsel me so to do.  King Madeglant warreth upon
 him and King Claudas maketh war upon him also.  They will deliver
 attacks enough.  But I should well allow, for the sake of saving
 his land and keeping his friends, that the King should suffer
 Lancelot to remain at a distance from his court for one year,
 until tidings should have come to King Claudas that he had been
 bidden leave thereof, so as that King Arthur might have his good
 will and his love."
 </p><p>
 Sagramors li Desirous leapeth forward.  "Briant of the Isles,"
 saith Sagramors, "Ill befall him that shall give such counsel to
 a lord or his knight, and the knight have well served his lord,
 albeit he may have slain in his wars a knight without murder and
 without treason, that he should give him his leave!  Right ill
 will Lancelot hitherto have bestowed his services, and the King
 on this account give him his leave!  After that, let King Claudas
 come!  Let him lay waste and slay, and right great worship shall
 King Arthur have thereof!  I say not this for that Lancelot hath
 need be afeared of King Claudas body to body, nor of the best
 knight in his land, but many things befall whereof one taketh no
 heed; and so King Arthur give leave to Lancelot from his court,
 it will be counted unto him for cowardize, and neither I nor you
 nor other knight ought never more to have affiance in him."
 </p><p>
 "Lord," saith Briant of the Isles, "Better would it avail the
 King to give Lancelot leave for one year, than it would to fight
 for him ten years and have his land wasted and put to the worse."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VIII.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, behold you!  Orguelleux of the Launde come, that had
 not been at the court of a long time, and it had been told him
 whereof these words were.
 </p><p>
 "Briant," saith Orguelleux of the Launde, "Evil fare the knight
 that would fain grieve and harm with their lord them that have
 served him well!  Sith that Lancelot is not here, say nought of
 him that ought not to be said.  The court of King Arthur hath
 been as much renowned and made honoured by Lancelot as by ever
 another knight that is in it, and, but for him, never would his
 court have been so redoubted as it is.  For no knight is there so
 cruel to his foes nor so redoubted throughout all Great Britain
 as is Lancelot, and, for that King Arthur loveth you, make him
 not that he hate his knights, for such four or such six be there
 in his castle as may depart therefrom without returning, the loss
 whereof should scarce be made good by us.  Lancelot hath well
 served the King aforetime, and the King well knoweth how much he
 is worth; and if so be that King Claudas purposeth to war on King
 Arthur for Lancelot's sake, according as I have heard, without
 any reason, and King Arthur be not more craven than he wont to
 be, he may well abide his warfare and his strife so treason harm
 him not.  For so many good knights hath King Arthur yet, that
 none knoweth such knights nor such King in the world beside."
