 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXXIII</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 Afterward, this title telleth us that Meliot of Logres was
 departed from Castle Perilous sound and whole, by virtue of the
 sword that Lancelot had brought him, and of the cloth that he
 took in the Chapel Perilous.  But sore sorrowful was he of the
 tidings he had heard that Messire Gawain was in prison and he
 knew not where, but he had been borne on hand that two knights
 that were kinsmen of them of the Raving Castle that had slain one
 another, had shut him in prison on account of Perceval that had
 won the castle.  Now, saith Meliot of Logres, never shall he have
 ease again until he knoweth where Messire Gawain is.  He rideth
 amidst a forest, and prayeth God grant him betimes to hear
 witting of Messire Gawain.  The forest was strange and gloomy. 
 He rode until nightfall but might not find neither hold nor
 hermitage.  He looketh right amidst the forest before him and
 seeth a damsel sitting that bemoaneth herself full sore.  The
 moon was dark and the place right foul of seeming and the forest
 gloomy of shadow.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, damsel, and what do you here at this hour?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "I may not amend it, the more is my sorrow. 
 For the place is more perilous than you think.  Look," saith she,
 "up above, and you will see the occasion wherefore I am here."
 </p><p>
 Meliot looketh and seeth two knights all armed hanging up above
 the damsel's head.  Thereof much marvelleth he.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, damsel," saith he, "Who slew these knights so foully?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "The Knight of the Galley that singeth in the
 sea."
 </p><p>
 "And wherefore hath he hanged them in such wise?"
 </p><p>
 "For this," saith she, "that they believed in God and His sweet
 Mother.  And so behoveth me to watch them here for forty days,
 that none take them down of hanging, for and they were taken
 hence he would lose his castle, he saith, and would cut off my
 head."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Meliot, "Such watch is foul shame to damsel,
 and no longer shall you remain here."
 </p><p>
 "Ha, Sir," saith the damsel, "Then shall I be a dead woman, for
 he is of so great cruelty that none scarce might protect me
 against him."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Meliot, "Foul shame would it be and I left here
 these knights in such wise for the reproach of other knights."
 </p><p>
 Meliot made them graves with his sword, and so buried them the
 best he might.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel, "And you take not thought to protect me,
 the knight will slay me.  To-morrow, when he findeth not the
 knights, he will search all the forest to look for me."
 </p><p>
 Meliot and the damsel together go their way through the forest
 until they come to a chapel where was wont to be a hermit that
 the Knight of the Galley had destroyed.  He helpeth down the
 damsel of his horse, and afterward they entered into the chapel,
 where was a great brightness of light, and a damsel was there
 that kept watch over a dead knight.  Meliot marvelleth him much. 
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," said Meliot, "When was this knight killed?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, yesterday the Knight of the Galley slew him on the sea-
 shore, wherefore behoveth me thus keep watch, and in the morning
 will he come hither or ever he go to the castle where Messire
 Gawain hath to-morrow to fight with a lion, all unarmed, and my
 Lady, that is mistress both of me and of this damsel you have
 brought hither, will likewise be brought to-morrow to the place
 where the lion is to slay Messire Gawain, and she in like sort
 will be afterward delivered to the lion and she renounce not the
 New Law wherein the knight that came from Raving Castle, whereof
 she is lady, hath made her believe; and we ourselves shall be in
 like manner devoured along with her.  But this damsel would still
 have taken respite of my death and she had still kept guard over
 the knights that were so foully hanged above her.  Natheless,
 sith that you have taken them down from where they were hanging,
 you have done a right good deed, whatsoever betide, for the Lord
 of the Red Tower will give his castle to the knight for this." 
 </p><p>
 Meliot is right joyous of the tidings that he hath heard of
 Messire Gawain that he is still on live, for well knoweth he,
 sith that the Knight of the Galley will come by the chapel there,
 that he will come thither or ever Messire Gawain doth battle with
 the lion.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel of the chapel, "For God's sake, take this
 damsel to a place of safety, for the knight will be so wood mad
 of wrath and despite so soon as he cometh hither, that he will be
 fain to smite off her head forthwith, and of yourself also have I
 great fear."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Meliot, "The knight is but a man like as am I."
 </p><p>
 "Yea, Sir, but stronger is he and more cruel than seem you to
 be."
 </p><p>
 Meliot was in the chapel the night until the morrow, and heard
 the knight coming like a tempest, and he brought with him the
 lady of the castle and reviled her from time to time, and Meliot
 seeth him come, and a dwarf that followeth after him a great
 pace.  He crieth out to him: "Sir, behold there the disloyal
 knight through whom you have lost your castle.  Now haste! 
 Avenge yourself of him!  After that will we go to the death of
 Messire Gawain?"
 </p><p>
 Meliot, so soon as he espieth him, mounteth and maketh his arms
 ready.
 </p><p>
 "Is it you," saith the Knight of the Galley, "that hath
 trespassed on my demesne and taken down my knights?"
 </p><p>
 "By my head, yours were they not!  Rather were they the knights
 of God, and foul outrage have you done herein when you slew them
 so shamefully."
 </p><p>
 He goeth toward the knight without more words, and smiteth him so
 passing strong amidst the breast that he pierceth the habergeon
 and thrusteth all the iron of his spear into his body and
 afterward draweth it back to him with a great wrench.  And the
 knight smiteth him so hard on his shield that he maketh an ell's
 length pass beyond, for right wroth was he that he was wounded.
 The dwarf crieth to him, "Away, then!  The knight endureth
 against you that have slain so many of them!"
 </p><p>
 The Knight of the Galley waxeth wood wrath.  He taketh his
 career, and cometh as fast as his horse may carry him, and
 smiteth Meliot so strongly that he breaketh his spear in such
 sort that he maketh both him and his horse stagger.  But Meliot
 catcheth him better, for he thrusteth the spear right through his
 body and hurleth against him at the by-passing with such
 stoutness and force that he maketh him fall dead to the ground
 from his horse.  The dwarf thought to escape, but Meliot smote
 off his head, whereof the damsels gave him great thanks, for many
 a mischief had he wrought them.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 Meliot buried the knight that he found in the chapel dead, then
 told the damsels that he might abide no longer, but would go
 succour Messire Gawain and he might.  The damsels were horsed to
 their will, for one had the horse of the knight that was slain
 and the other the horse of the dwarf.  The other damsel was come
 upon a mule, and they said that they would go back, for the
 country was made all safe by the death of the knight.  They
 thanked Meliot much, for they say truly that he hath rescued them
 from death.  Meliot departeth from the damsels and goeth right
 amidst the forest as he that would most fain hear tidings of
 Messire Gawain.  When he had ridden of a long space, he met a
 knight that was coming all armed at great pace.
 </p><p>
 "Sir Knight," saith he to Meliot, "Can you tell me tidings of the
 Knight of the Galley?"
 </p><p>
 "What have you to do therein?" saith Meliot.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, the Lord of the Red Tower hath made bring Messire Gawain
 into a launde of this forest, and there, all unarmed, must he do
 battle with a lion.  So my lord is waiting for the Knight of the
 Galley, that is to bring two damsels thither that the lion will
 devour when he shall have slain Messire Gawain."
 </p><p>
 "Will the battle be presently?" saith Meliot.
 </p><p>
 "Yea, Sir," saith the knight, "Soon enough betimes, for Messire
 Gawain hath already been led thither and there bound to a stake
 until such time as the lion shall be come.  Then will he be
 unbound, but even then two knights all armed will keep watch on
 him.  But tell me tidings of the Knight of the Galley, and you
 have seen him?"
 </p><p>
 "Go forward," saith he, "and you will hear tidings of him." 
 </p><p>
 Meliot departeth thereupon, a great gallop, and cometh nigh the
 launde whereunto Messire Gawain had been brought.  He espied the
 two knights that kept guard over him, and if that Messire Gawain
 were in fear, little marvel was it, for he thought that his end
 had come.  Meliot espied him bound to an iron staple with cords
 about the body on all sides so that he might not move.  Meliot
 hath great pity thereof in his heart, and saith to himself that
 he will die there sooner than Messire Gawain shall die.  He
 clappeth spurs to his horse when he cometh nigh the knights, and
 overtaketh one of them with such a rush that he thrusteth his
 spear right through his body, and beareth him down dead.  The
 other was fain to go to the castle for succour when he saw his
 fellow dead.  Meliot slew him forthwith.  He cometh to Messire
 Gawain, and so unbindeth him and cutteth the cords wherewith he
 is bound.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "I am Meliot of Logres, your knight."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 When Messire Gawain felt himself unbound, no need to ask whether
 he had joy thereof.  The tidings were come to the Red Court that
 Queen Jandree was christened and baptized, and that the Knight
 was come that had such force and puissance in him that none might
 endure against him for the God in whom he believed, and they knew
 likewise that the Knight of the Galley was dead, and Messire
 Gawain unbound and the knights that guarded him slain.  They say
 that there may they not abide, so they depart from the castle and
 say that they will cross the sea to protect their bodies, for
 that there they may have no safety.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 When Meliot had delivered Messire Gawain he made him be armed
 with the arms, such as they were, of one of the knights he had
 slain.  Messire Gawain mounted on a horse such as pleased him,
 and right great joy had he at heart.  They marvel much how it is
 that they of the castle have not come after them, but they know
 not their thought nor how they are scared.
 </p><p>
 "Meliot," saith Messire Gawain, "You have delivered me from death
 this time and one other, nor never had I acquaintance with any
 knight that hath done so much for me in so short a time as have
 you."
 </p><p>
 They departed the speediest they might and rode nigh enow to the
 castle, but they heard none moving within nor any noise, nor saw
 they none issue forth, and much marvelled they that none should
 come after them.  They rode until they came to the head of the
 forest and caught sight of the sea that was nigh enough before
 them, and saw that there was a great clashing of arms at the
 brink of the sea.  A single knight was doing battle with all them
 that would fain have entered into a ship, and held stour so
 stiffly against them that he toppled the more part into the sea.
 They went thither as fast as they might, and when they drew nigh
 to the ship they knew that it was Perceval by his arms and his
 shield.  Or ever they reached it, the ship was put off into the
 midst of the sea, wherein he was launched of his own great
 hardiment, and they went on fighting against him within the ship. 
 </p><p>
 "Meliot," saith Messire Gawain, "See you, there is Perceval the
 Good Knight, and now may we say of a truth that he is in sore
 peril of death; for that ship, save God bethink Him thereof,
 shall arrive in such manner and in such a place as that never
 more shall we have no witting of him, and, so he perish for ever,
 no knight on live may have power to set forward the Law of our
 Lord."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII.
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain seeth the ship going further away, and Perceval
 that defendeth himself therein against them that set upon him.
 Right heavy is he that he came not sooner, or ever the ship had
 put off from the land.  He turneth back, he and Meliot together,
 and right sorrowful was Messire Gawain of Perceval, for they knew
 not in what land he might arrive, and, might he have followed,
 right gladly would he have gone after him to aid him.  They have
 ridden until they meet a knight.  Messire Gawain asketh him
 whence he cometh, and he saith from King Arthur's court.
 </p><p>
 "What tidings can you tell us thereof?" saith Messire Gawain. 
 </p><p>
 "Sir, bad enough!" saith he.  "King Arthur hath neglected all his
 knights for Briant of the Isles, and hath put one of his best
 knights in prison."
 </p><p>
 "What is his name?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, he is called Lancelot of the Lake.  He had reconquered all
 the islands that had been reft of King Arthur, and slain King
 Madeglant, and conquered the land of Oriande that he turned to
 the belief of the Saviour of the World, and, so soon as he had
 conquered his enemies, King Arthur sent for him forthwith and
 straightway put him in his prison by the counsel of Briant of the
 Isles.  But King Arthur will have a surfeit of friends betimes;
 for King Claudas hath assembled his folk in great plenty to
 reconquer the kingdom of Oriande and come back upon King Arthur
 by the counsel of Briant of the Isles that betrayeth the King,
 for he hath made him his Seneschal and commander of all his
 land."
 </p><p>
 "Sir Knight," saith Messire Gawain, "Needs must the King miscarry
 that setteth aside the counsel of his good knights for the
 leasings of a traitor."
 </p><p>
 Thereupon the knight departed from Messire Gawain.  Right heavy
 is he of this that he hath said, that the King hath put Lancelot
 in prison.  Never tofore did he aught whereby he wrought so much
 to blame.
