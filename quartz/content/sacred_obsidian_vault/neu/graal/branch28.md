 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXVIII</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 This story saith that Briant would have been wroth with a will
 against Orguelleux of the Launde, had it not been for the King,
 and Orguelleux against him, for Orguelleux heeded no danger when
 anger and ill-will carried him away.  Therewithal the talk came
 to an end.  When the King learnt the tidings that Madeglant was
 discomfited and that the land of Albanie was in peace, he sent
 word to Lancelot to return back.  They of the land were very
 sorrowful when he departed, for great affiance had they in his
 chivalry.  So he came back thither where King Arthur was.  All
 they of the land made a great joy, for well loved was he of many,
 nor were there none that hated him save of envy alone.  They told
 him the tidings of King Claudas, and also in what manner Briant
 had spoken.  Lancelot took no notice outwardly, as he that well
 knew how to redress all his grievances.  He was at the court of a
 long while, for that King Claudas was about to send over thither
 some one of his knights.  Briant of the Isles would fain that the
 King should have given him his leave, for more he hated him than
 ever another knight in the court, sith he it was that many a time
 had harmed him more than any other.  By Briant's counsel, King
 Claudas sent his knight to King Arthur's court, wherein did he
 not wisely, for that he thereby renewed a matter whereof
 afterward came right great mischief, as this title witnesseth.

 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 Madeglant of Oriande heard say that Lancelot was repaired back,
 and that the land of Albanie was all void save for the folk of
 the country.  He maketh ready his navy at once and cometh back to
 the land in great force.  He burneth the land and layeth it waste
 on every side, and doth far worse therein than he did aforetime.
 They of the land sent over to King Arthur and told him of their
 evil plight, warning him that, and he send them not succour
 betimes, they will leave the land and yield up the castles, for
 that they might not hold them longer.  He took counsel, the King
 with his knights, whom he might send thither, and they said that
 Lancelot had already been there and that now another knight
 should be sent thither.  The King sent thither Briant of the
 Isles, and lent him forty knights.  Briant, that loved not the
 King in his heart, came into the land, but only made pretence of
 helping him to defend it.  One day fell out a battle betwixt
 Madeglant and Briant and all their men.  Briant was discomfited,
 and had many of his knights killed.  Madeglant and his people
 spread themselves over the land and laid the towns in ruins and
 destroyed the castles, that were disgarnished, and put to death
 all them that would not believe in their gods, and cut off their
 heads.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 All they of the land and country longed with sorrow for Lancelot,
 and said that had he remained there, the land would not have been
 thus destroyed, nor might they never have protection of no knight
 but of him alone.  Briant of the Isles returned back, as he that
 would the war against King Arthur should increase on every side,
 for, what good soever the King may do him, he loveth him not, nor
 never will so long as he is on live.  But no semblant thereof
 durst he show, for, sith that the best of his knights had been
 slain in the battle, so had he no power on his side, as against
 Lancelot and the good knights of his fellowship, whereof he would
 fain that there had been not one.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 King Arthur was at Cardoil on one day of Whitsuntide.  Many were
 the knights that were come to this court whereof I tell you.  The
 King was seated at meat, and the day was fair and clear, and the
 air clean and fresh.  Sagramors li Desirous and Lucan the Butler
 served before the King.  And what time they had served of the
 first meats, therewithal behold you, a quarrel, like as it had
 been shot from a cross-bow, and striketh in the column of the
 hall before the King so passing strong that there was not a
 knight in the hall but heard it when it struck therein.  They all
 looked thereat in great wonderment.  The quarrel was like as it
 were of gold, and it had about it a many costly precious stones.
 The King saith that quarrel so costly cometh not from a poor
 place.  Lancelot and Messire Gawain say that never have they seen
 one so rich.  It struck so deep in the column that the iron point
 thereof might not be seen, and a good part of the shaft was also
 hidden.  Thereupon, behold you, a damsel of surpassing great
 beauty that cometh, sitting on a right costly mule, full well
 caparisoned.  She had a gilded bridle and gilded saddle, and was
 clad in a right rich cloth of silk.  A squire followed after her 
 that drove her mule from behind.  She came before King Arthur as
 straight as she might, and saluted him right worshipfully, and he
 made answer the best he might.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "I am come to speak and demand a boon, nor will
 I never alight until such time as you shall have granted it to
 me.  For such is my custom, and for this am I come to your court,
 whereof I have heard such tidings and such witness in many places
 where I have been, that I know you will not deny me herein."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel, tell me what boon you would have of me?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "I would fain pray and beseech you that you bid
 the knight that may draw forth this quarrel from this column go
 thither where there is sore need of him."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the King, "Tell me the need."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "I will tell it you plainly when I shall see
 the knight that shall have drawn it forth."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the King, "Alight!  Never, please God, shall you
 go forth of my court denied of that you ask."
 </p><p>
 Lucan the Butler taketh her between his arms and setteth her to
 the ground, and her mule is led away to be stabled.  When the
 damsel had washen, she was set in a seat beside Messire Ywain,
 that showed her much honour and served her with a good will.  He
 looked at her from time to time, for she was fair and gentle and
 of good countenance.  When they had eaten at the tables, the
 damsel prayeth the King that he will hasten them to do her
 business.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "Many a good knight is there within yonder, and
 right glad may he be that shall draw it forth, for I tell you a
 right good knight is he, sith that none may achieve this business
 save he alone."
 </p><p>
 "Fair nephew," saith the King, "Now set your hand to this quarrel
 and give it back to the damsel."
 </p><p>
 "Ha, sir," saith he, "Do me not shame!  By the faith that I owe
 you, I will not set my hand forward herein this day, nor ought
 you to be wroth hereof.  Behold, here have you Lancelot with you,
 and so many other good knights, that little worship should I have
 herein were I to set myself forward before them."
 </p><p>
 "Messire Ywain," saith the King, "Set your hand hereto!  It may
 be that you think too humbly of yourself herein."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Ywain, "Nought is there in the world that I
 would not do for you, but as for this matter I pray you hold me
 excused."
 </p><p>
 "Sagramors, and you, Orguelleux of the Launde, what will you do?"
 saith the King.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say they, "When Lancelot hath made assay, we will do your
 pleasure, but before him, so please you, we will not go."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the King, "Pray Lancelot that he be fain to set
 his hand, and then the rest shall go after him if needs be."
 </p><p>
 "Lancelot," saith the damsel, "By the thing that most you love,
 make not mine errand bootless, but set your hand to the quarrel
 and then will the others do that they ought of right to do.  For
 no leisure have I to tarry here long time."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Lancelot, "Ill do you, and a sin, to conjure me
 for nought, for so many good knights be here within, that I
 should be held for a fool and a braggart and I put myself forward
 before all other."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the King, "Not so!  Rather will you be held
 as a knight courteous and wise and good, as now you ought to be,
 and great worship will it be to yourself and you may draw forth
 the quarrel, and great courtesy will it be to aid the damsel.
 Wherefore I require you, of the faith you owe me, that you set
 your hand thereto, sith that the damsel prayeth you so to do,
 before the others."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot hath no mind to disobey the King's commandment; and he
 remembered that the damsel had conjured him by the thing that
 most he loved; nor was there nought in the world that he loved so
 much as the Queen, albeit she were dead, nor never thought he of
 none other thing save her alone.  Then standeth he straight
 upright, doth off his robe, and cometh straight to the quarrel
 that is fixed in the column.  He setteth his hand thereunto and
 draweth it forth with a right passing strong wrench, so sturdily
 that he maketh the column tremble.  Then he giveth it to the
 damsel.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she to King Arthur, "Now is it my devoir to tell you
 plainly of my errand; nor might none of the knights here within
 have drawn forth the quarrel save only he; and you held me in
 covenant how he that should draw it forth should do that which I
 shall require of him, and that he might do it, nor will I pray
 nor require of him nought that is not reason.  Needs must he go
 to the Chapel Perilous the swiftest he may, and there will he
 find a knight that lieth shrouded in the midst of the chapel.  He
 will take of the cloth wherein he is shrouded and a sword that
 lieth at his side in the coffin, and will take them to the Castle
 Perilous; and when he shall there have been, he shall return to
 the castle where he slew the lion in the cavern wherein are the
 two griffons, and the head of one of them shall he take and bring
 to me at Castle Perilous, for a knight there lieth sick that may
 not otherwise be healed."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VIII.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel." saith Lancelot, "I see that you reckon but little of my
 life, so only that your wish be accomplished."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "I know as well as you what the enterprise is,
 nor do I no whit desire your death, for, and were you dead, never
 would the knight be whole for whose sake you undertake it.  And
 you will see the fairest damsel that is in any kingdom, and the
 one that most desireth to see you.  And, so you tarry not,
 through her shall you lightly get done that you have to do.  See
 now that you delay it not, but do that is needful swiftly sith
 that it hath been laid upon you, for the longer you tarry, the
 greater will be the hazard of mischance befalling you."
 </p><p>
 The damsel departeth from the court and taketh her leave and
 goeth her way back as fast as she may, and saith to herself:
 "Lancelot, albeit you have these pains and this travail for me,
 yet would I not your death herein, but of right ought I to
 rejoice in your tribulation, for into two of the most perilous
 places in the world are you going.  Greatly ought I to hate you,
 for you reft me of my friend and gave him to another, and while I
 live may I never forget it."
 </p><p>
 The damsel goeth her way, and Lancelot departeth from the court
 and taketh leave of the King and of all the others.  He issueth
 forth of Cardoil, all armed, and entereth into the forest that is
 deep, and so goeth forth a great pace, and prayeth God guide him
 into safety.
