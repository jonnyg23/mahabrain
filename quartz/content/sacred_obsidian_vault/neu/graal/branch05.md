 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch V</h1> 
 INCIPIT.
 <p>
 Here beginneth again another branch of the Graal in the name of
 the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 TITLE I.
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain goeth his way and evening draweth on; and on his
 right hand was there a narrow pathway that seemed him to be
 haunted of folk.  Thitherward goeth he, for that he seeth the sun
 waxeth low, and findeth in the thick of the forest a great
 chapel, and without was a right fair manor.  Before the chapel
 was an orchard enclosed of a wooden fence that was scarce so high
 as a tall man.  A hermit that seemed him a right worshipful man
 was leaning against the fence, and looked into the orchard and
 made great cheer from time to time.  He seeth Messire Gawain, and
 cometh to meet him, and Messire Gawain alighteth.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "Welcome may you be."
 </p><p>
 "God grant you the joy of Paradise," saith Messire Gawain.  The
 hermit maketh his horse be stabled of a squire, and then taketh
 him by the hand and maketh him sit beside him to look on the
 orchard.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "Now may you see that whereof I was
 making cheer."
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain looketh therewithin and seeth two damsels and a
 squire and a child that were guarding a lion.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "Here see my joy, which is this child.
 Saw you ever so fair a child his age?"
 </p><p>
 "Never," saith Messire Gawain.  They go into the orchard to sit,
 for the evening was fair and calm.  He maketh disarm him, and
 thereupon the damsel bringeth him a surcoat of right rich silk
 furred of ermine.  And Messire Gawain looketh at the child that
 rode upon the lion right fainly.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "None durst guard him or be master over
 him save this child only, and yet the lad is not more than six
 years of age.  Sir, he is of right noble lineage, albeit he is
 the son of the most cruel man and most felon that is.  Marin the
 Jealous is his father, that slew his wife on account of Messire
 Gawain.  Never sithence that his mother was dead would not the
 lad be with his father, for well knoweth he that he slew her of
 wrong.  And I am his uncle, so I make him be tended here of these
 damsels and these two squires, but no one thing is there that he
 so much desireth to see as Messire Gawain.  For after his
 father's death ought he of right to be Messire Gawain's man. Sir,
 if any tidings you know of him, tell us them."
 </p><p>
 "By my faith, Sir," saith he, "Tidings true can I give you.  Lo,
 there is his shield and his spear, and himself shall you have
 this night for guest."
 </p><p>
 "Fair sir, are you he?" saith the hermit.
 </p><p>
 "So men call me," saith Messire Gawain, "And the lady saw I slain
 in the forest, whereof was I sore an-angered."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 "Fair nephew," saith the hermit, "See here your desire.  Come to
 him and make him cheer."
 </p><p>
 The lad alighteth of the lion and smiteth him with a whip and
 leadeth him to the den and maketh the door so that he may not
 issue forth, and cometh to Messire Gawain, and Messire Gawain
 receiveth him between his arms. "Sir," saith the child, "Welcome
 may you be!"
 </p><p>
 "God give you growth of honour!" saith Messire Gawain.  He
 kisseth him and maketh cheer with him right sweetly.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "He will be of right your man, wherefore
 ought you to counsel him and help him, for through you came his
 mother by her death, and right sore need will he have of your
 succour."  The child kneeleth before him and holdeth up his
 joined hands.
 </p><p>
 "Look, Sir," saith the hermit, "Is he not right pitiful?  He
 offereth you his homage."
 </p><p>
 And Messire Gawain setteth his hands within his own: "Certes,"
 saith Messire Gawain, "Both your honour and your homage receive I
 gladly, and my succour and my counsel shall you have so often as
 you shall have need thereof.  But fain would I know your name?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, I am called Meliot of Logres."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "He saith true, for his mother was
 daughter of a rich earl of the kingdom of Logres."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain was well harboured the night and lay in a right
 fair house and right rich.  In the morning, when Messire Gawain
 had heard mass, the hermit asked him, "Whitherward go you?" and
 he said, "Toward the land of King Fisherman, and God allow me."
 </p><p>
 "Messire Gawain," saith the hermit, "Now God grant you speed your
 business better than did the other knight that was there before
 you, through whom are all the lands fallen into sorrow, and the
 good King Fisherman languisheth thereof."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "God grant me herein to do His
 pleasure."
 </p><p>
 Thereupon he taketh his leave and goeth his way, and the hermit
 commendeth him to God.  And Messire Gawain rideth on his journeys
 until he hath left far behind the forest of the hermitage, and
 findeth the fairest land in the world and the fairest meadowlands
 that ever had he seen, and it lasted a good couple of great
 leagues Welsh.  And he seeth a high forest before him, and
 meeteth a squire that came from that quarter, and seeth that he
 is sore downcast and right simple.
 </p><p>
 "Fair friend," saith Messire Gawain, "Whence come you?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "I come from yonder forest down below."
 </p><p>
 "Whose man are you?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "I belong to the worshipful man that owneth the forest."
 </p><p>
 "You seem not over joyful," saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, I have right to be otherwise," saith the squire, "For he
 that loseth his good lord ought not to be joyful."
 </p><p>
 "And who is your lord?"
 </p><p>
 "The best in the world."
 </p><p>
 "Is he dead?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "Nay, of a truth, for that would be right sore grief to the
 world, but in joy hath he not been this long time past."
 </p><p>
 "And what name hath he?"
 </p><p>
 "They call him Parlui there where he is."
 </p><p>
 "And where then, is he, may I know?"
 </p><p>
 "In no wise, Sir, of me; but so much may I well tell you that he
 is in this forest, but I ought not to learn you of the place more
 at large, nor ought I to do any one thing that may be against my
 master's will."
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain seeth that the squire is of passing comeliness and
 seeth him forthwith bow his head toward the ground and the tears
 fall from his eyes.  Thereupon he asketh what aileth him.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "Never may I have joy until such time as I be
 entered into a hermitage to save my soul.  For the greatest sin
 that any man may do have I wrought; for I have slain my mother
 that was a Queen, for this only that she told me I should not be
 King after my father's death, for that she would make me monk or
 clerk, and that my other brother, who is younger-born than I,
 should have the kingdom.  When my father knew that I had slain my
 mother, he withdrew himself into this forest, and made a
 hermitage and renounced his kingdom.  I have no will to hold the
 land for the great disloyalty that I have wrought, and therefore
 am I resolved that it is meeter I should set my body in
 banishment than my father."
 </p><p>
 "And what is your name?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, my name is Joseus, and I am of the lineage of Joseph of
 Abarimacie.  King Pelles is my father, that is in this forest,
 and King Fisherman mine uncle, and the King of Castle Mortal, and
 the Widow Lady of Camelot my aunt, and the Good Knight Par-lui-
 fet is of this lineage as near akin as I."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 With that, the squire departeth and taketh leave of Messire
 Gawain, and he commendeth him to God and hath great pity of him,
 and entereth into the forest and goeth great pace, and findeth
 the stream of a spring that ran with a great rushing, and nigh
 thereunto was a way that was much haunted.  He abandoneth his
 high-way, and goeth all along the stream from the spring that
 lasteth a long league plenary, until that he espieth a right fair
 house and right fair chapel well enclosed within a hedge of wood.
 He looketh from without the entrance under a little tree and
 seeth there sitting one of the seemliest men that he had ever
 seen of his age.  And he was clad as a hermit, his head white and
 no hair on his face, and he held his hand to his chin, and made a
 squire hold a destrier right fair and strong and tail, and a
 shield with a sun thereon; and he was looking at a habergeon and
 chausses of iron that he had made bring before him.  And when he
 seeth Messire Gawain he dresseth him over against him and saith:
 "Fair sir," saith he, "Ride gently and make no noise, for no need
 have we of worse than that we have."
 </p><p>
 And Messire Gawain draweth rein, and the worshipful man saith to
 him: "Sir, for God's sake take it not of discourtesy; for right
 fainly would I have besought you to harbour had I not good cause
 to excuse me, but a knight lieth within yonder sick, that is held
 for the best knight in the world.  Wherefore fain would I he
 should have no knight come within this close, for and if he
 should rise, as sick as he is, none might prevent him nor hold
 him back, but presently he should arm him and mount on his horse
 and joust at you or any other; and so he were here, well might we
 be the worse thereof.  And therefore do I keep him so close and
 quiet within yonder, for that I would not have him see you nor
 none other, for and he were so soon to die, sore loss would it be
 to the world."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "What name hath he?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "He hath made him of himself, and therefore do I
 call him Par-lui-fer, of dearness and love."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "May it not be in any wise that I
 may see him?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "I have told you plainly that nowise may
 it not be.  No strange man shall not see him within yonder until
 such time as he be whole and of good cheer."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "Will you in nowise do nought for me
 whatsoever I may say?"
 </p><p>
 "Certes, sir, no one thing is there in the world that I would
 tell him, save he spake first to me."
 </p><p>
 Hereof is Messire Gawain right sorrowful that he may not speak to
 the knight.  "Sir," saith he to the hermit, "Of what age is the
 knight, and of what lineage?"
 </p><p>
 "Of the lineage of Joseph of Abarimacie the Good Soldier."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon behold you a damsel that cometh to the door of the
 chapel and calleth very low to the hermit, and the hermit riseth
 up and taketh leave of Messire Gawain, and shutteth the door of
 the chapel; and the squire leadeth away the destrier and beareth
 the arms within door and shutteth the postern door of the house.
 And Messire abideth without and knoweth not of a truth whether it
 be the son of the Widow Lady, for many good men there be of one
 lineage.  He departeth all abashed and entereth again into the
 forest.  The history telleth not all the journeys that he made.
 Rather, I tell you in brief words that he wandered so far by
 lands and kingdoms that he found a right fair land and a rich,
 and a castle seated in the midst thereof.  Thitherward goeth he
 and draweth nigh the castle and seeth it compassed about of high
 walls, and he seeth the entrance of the castle far without.  He
 looketh and seeth a lion chained that lay in the midst of the
 entrance to the gate, and the chain was fixed in the wall.  And
 on either side of the gate he seeth two serjeants of beaten
 copper that were fixed to the wall, and by engine shot forth
 quarrels from their cross-bows with great force and great wrath.
 Messire Gawain durst not come anigh the gate for that he seeth
 the lion and these folk.  He looketh above on the top of the wall
 and seeth a sort of folk that seemed him to be of holy life, and
 saw there priests clad in albs and knights bald and ancient that
 were clad in ancient seeming garments.  And in each crenel of the
 wall was a cross and a chapel.  Above the wall, hard by an issue
 from a great hall that was in the castle, was another chapel, and
 above the chapel was a tall cross, and on either side of this
 cross another that was somewhat lower, and on the top of each
 cross was a golden eagle.  The priests and the knights were upon
 the walls and knelt toward this chapel, and looked up to heaven
 and made great joy, and well it seemed him that they beheld God
 in Heaven with His Mother.  Messire Gawain looketh at them from
 afar, for he durst not come anigh the castle for these that shoot
 their arrows so strongly that none armour might defend him.  Way
 seeth he none to right nor left save he go back again.  He
 knoweth not what to do. He looketh before him and seeth a priest
 issue forth of the gateway.  "Fair sir," saith Messire Gawain,
 "Welcome may you be!"
 </p><p>
 "Good adventure to you also," saith the good man, "What is your
 pleasure?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "So please you, I would fain ask you
 to tell me what castle is this?"
 </p><p>
 "It is," saith he, "the entrance to the land of the rich King
 Fisherman, and within yonder are they beginning the service of
 the Most Holy Graal."
 </p><p>
 "Allow me then," saith Messire Gawain, "that I may pass on
 further, for toward the land of King Fisherman have I emprised my
 way."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the priest, "I tell you of a truth that you may not
 enter the castle nor come nigher unto the Holy Graal, save you
 bring the sword wherewith S. John was beheaded."
 </p><p>
 "What?" saith Messire Gawain, "Shall I be evilly entreated and I
 bring it not?"
 </p><p>
 "So much may you well believe me herein," saith the priest, "And
 I tell you moreover that he who hath it is the fellest
 misbelieving King that lives.  But so you bring the Sword, this
 entrance will be free to you, and great joy will be made of you
 in all places wherein King Fisherman hath power."
 </p><p>
 "Then must I needs go back again," saith Messire Gawain, "Whereof
 I have right to be sore sorrowful."
 </p><p>
 "So ought you not to be," saith the priest, "For, so you bring
 the sword and conquer it for us, then will it be well known that
 you are worthy to behold the Holy Graal.  But take heed you
 remember him who would not ask whereof it served."
 </p><p>
 Thereupon Messire Gawain departeth so sorrowful and full of
 thought that he remembereth not to ask in what land he may find
 the sword nor the name of the King that hath it.  But he will
 know tidings thereof when God pleaseth.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 The history telleth us and witnesseth that he rode so far that he
 came to the side of a little hill, and the day was right fair and
 clear.  He looketh in front of him before a chapel and seeth a
 tall burgess sitting on a great destrier that was right rich and
 fair.  The burgess espieth Messire Gawain and cometh over against
 him, and saluteth him right courteously and Messire Gawain him.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "God give you joy."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the goodman, "Right sorrowful am I of this that you
 have a horse so lean and spare of flesh.  Better would it become
 so worshipful man as you seem to be that he were better horsed."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "I may not now amend it, whereof am
 I sorry; another shall I have when it shall please God."
 </p><p>
 "Fair sir," saith the burgess, "Whither are you bound to go?"
 </p><p>
 "I go seek the sword wherewith the head of S. John Baptist was
 cut off."
 </p><p>
 "Ha, sir," saith the burgess, "You are running too sore a peril.
 A King hath it that believeth not in God, and is sore fell and
 cruel.  He is named Gurgalain, and many knights have passed
 hereby that went thither for the sword, but never thence have
 they returned.  But, and you are willing to pledge me your word
 that so God grant you to conquer the sword, you will return
 hither and show it me on your return, I will give you this
 destrier, which is right rich, for your own."
 </p><p>
 "Will you?" saith Messire Gawain, "Then are you right courteous,
 for you know me not."
 </p><p>
 "Certes, sir," saith he, "So worshipful man seem you to be, that
 you will hold well to this that you have covenanted with me."
 </p><p>
 "And to this do I pledge you my word," saith Messire Gawain,
 "that, so God allow me to conquer it, I will show it to you on my
 return."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon the burgess alighteth and mounteth upon Messire
 Gawain's horse, and Messire Gawain upon his, and taketh leave of
 the burgess and goeth his way and entereth into a right great
 forest beyond the city, and rideth until sundown and findeth
 neither castle nor city.  And he findeth a meadow in the midst of
 the forest, right broad, and it ran on beyond, like as there were
 the stream of a spring in the midst.  He looketh toward the foot
 of the meadow close by the forest, and seeth a right large tent,
 whereof the cords were of silk and the pegs of ivory fixed in the
 ground, and the tops of the poles of gold and upon each was a
 golden eagle.  The tent was white round about, and the hanging
 above was of the richest silk, the same as red samite. 
 Thitherward goeth Messire Gawain and alighteth before the door of
 the tent, and smiteth off the bridle of his horse, and letteth
 him feed on the grass, and leaneth his spear and his shield
 without the tent, and looketh narrowly within"and seeth a right
 rich couch of silk and gold, and below was a cloth unfolded as it
 were a feather-bed, and above a coverlid of ermine and vair
 without any gold, and at the head of the couch two pillows so
 rich that fairer none ever saw, and such sweet smell gave they
 forth that it seemed the tent was sprinkled of balm.  And round
 about the couch were rich silken cloths spread on the ground. 
 And at the head of the couch on the one side and the other were
 two seats of ivory, and upon them were two cushions stuffed with
 straw, right rich, and at the foot of the couch, above the bed,
 two candlesticks of gold wherein were two tall waxen tapers.  A
 table was set in the midst of the tent, that was all of ivory
 banded of gold, with rich precious stones, and upon the table was
 the napkin spread and the basin of silver and the knife with an
 ivory handle and the rich set of golden vessels.  Messire Gawain
 seeth the rich couch and setteth him down thereon all armed in
 the midst, and marvelleth him wherefore the tent is so richly
 apparelled and yet more that therein he seeth not a soul. 
 Howbeit, he was minded to disarm him.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VIII.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, behold you, saluteth a dwarf that entereth the tent
 and saluteth Messire Gawain.  Then he kneeleth before him and 
 would fain disarm him.  Then Messire Gawain remembereth him of
 the dwarf through whom the lady was slain.
 </p><p>
 "Fair sweet friend, withdraw yourself further from me, for as at
 this time I have no mind to disarm."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the dwarf, "Without misgiving may you do so, for
 until to-morrow have you no occasion to be on your guard, and
 never were you more richly lodged than to-night you shall be, nor
 more honourably."
 </p><p>
 With that Messire Gawain began to disarm him, and the dwarf
 helpeth him.  And when he was disarmed, he setteth his arms nigh
 the couch and his spear and sword and shield lying within the
 tent, and the dwarf taketh a basin of silver and a white napkin,
 and maketh Messire Gawain wash his hands and his face.  
 Afterward, he unfasteneth a right fair coffer, and draweth forth
 a robe of cloth of gold furred of ermine and maketh Messire
 Gawain be clad therewithal.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the dwarf, "Be not troubled as touching your
 destrier, for you will have him again when you rise in the
 morning.  I will lead him close hereby to be better at ease, and
 then will I return to you."
 </p><p>
 And Messire Gawain giveth him leave.  Thereupon, behold you, two
 squires that bear in the wine and set the meats upon the table
 and make Messire Gawain sit to eat, and they have great torches
 lighted on a tall cresset of gold and depart swiftly.  Whilst
 Messire Gawain was eating, behold you, thereupon, two damsels
 that come into the tent and salute him right courteously.  And he
 maketh answer, the fairest he may.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say the damsels, "God grant you force and power tomorrow
 to destroy the evil custom of this tent."
 </p><p>
 "Is there then any evil custom herein, damsel?" saith he.
 </p><p>
 "Yea, sir, a right foul custom, whereof much it grieveth me, but
 well meseemeth that you are the knight to amend it by the help of
 God."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IX.
 </p><p>
 Therewith he riseth from the table, and one of the squires was
 apparelled to take away the cloths.  And the two damsels take him
 by the hand and lead him without the tent, and they set them down
 in the midst of the meadow.  "Sir," saith the elder damsel, "What
 is your name?"
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith he, "Gawain is my name."
 </p><p>
 "Thereof do we love you the better, for well we know that the
 evil custom of the tent shall be done away on condition that you
 choose to-night the one of us two that most shall please you."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel, gramercy," saith he.  Thereupon he riseth up, for he was
 weary, and draweth him toward the couch, and the damsels help him
 and wait upon his going to bed.  And when he was lien down, they
 seated themselves before him and lighted the taper and leant over
 the couch and prospered him much service.  Messire Gawain
 answered them naught save "Gramercy," for he was minded to sleep
 and take his rest.
 </p><p>
 "By God," saith the one to the other, "And this were Messire
 Gawain, King Arthur's nephew, he would speak to us after another
 sort, and more of disport should we find in him than in this one.
 But this is a counterfeit Gawain, and the honour we have done him
 hath been ill bestowed.  Who careth?  To-morrow shall he pay his
 reckoning."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 X.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, lo you, the dwarf where he cometh.  "Fair friend," say
 they, "Keep good watch over this knight that he flee not away,
 for he goeth a-cadging from, hostel to hostel and maketh him be
 called Messire Gawain, but Messire Gawain meseemeth is he not. 
 For, and it were he, and we had been minded to watch with him two
 nights, he would have wished it to be three or four."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the dwarf, "He may not flee away save he go
 afoot, for his horse is in my keeping."
 </p><p>
 And Messire Gawain heareth well enough that which the damsels
 say, but he answereth them never a word.  Thereupon they depart,
 and say: God give him an ill night, for an evil knight and a
 vanquished and recreant, and command the dwarf that he move not
 on any occasion.  Messire Gawain slept right little the night,
 and so soon as he saw the day, arose and found his arms ready and
 his horse that had been led all ready saddled before the tent. 
 He armed himself as swiftly as he might, and the dwarf helpeth
 him and saith to him: "Sir, you have not done service to our
 damsels as they would fain you should, wherefore they make sore
 complaint of you."
 </p><p>
 "That grieveth me," saith Messire Gawain, "if that I have
 deserved it."
 </p><p>
 "It is great pity," saith the dwarf, "when knight so comely as be
 you is so churlish as they say."
 </p><p>
 "They may say their pleasure," saith he, "for it is their right.
 I know not to whom to render thanks for the good lodging that I
 have had save to God, and if I shall see the lord of the tent or
 the lady I shall con them much thanks thereof."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XI.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, lo you, where two knights come in front of the tent on
 their horses, all armed, and see Messire Gawain that was mounted
 and had his shield on his neck and his spear in his fist, as he
 that thinketh to go without doing aught further.  And the knights
 come before him: "Sir," say they, "Pay for your lodging!  Last
 night did we put ourselves to misease on your account and left
 you the tent and all that is therein at your pleasure, and now
 you are fain to go in this fashion."
 </p><p>
 "What pleaseth it you that I should do?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "It is meet I should requite you of my victual and the honour of
 the tent."
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, lo you, where the two damsels come that were of right
 great beauty.  "Sir Knight," say they, "Now shall we see whether
 you be King Arthur's nephew!"
 </p><p>
 "By my faith," saith the dwarf, "Methinketh this is not he that
 shall do away the evil custom whereby we lose the coming hither
 of knights!   Albeit if he may do it, I will forego mine ill will
 toward him."
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain thus heard himself mocked by day as well as by
 night and had great shame thereof.  He seeth that he may not
 depart without a fight.  One of the knights drew to backward and
 was alighted; the other was upon his horse all armed, his shield
 on his neck and grasping his spear in his fist.  And he cometh
 toward Messire Gawain full career and Messire Gawain toward him,
 and smiteth him so wrathfully that he pierceth his shield and
 pinneth his shield to his arm and his arm to his rib and
 thrusteth his spear into his body, and hurtleth against him so
 sore that he beareth him to the ground, him and his horse
 together at the first blow.
 </p><p>
 "By my head!  Look at Messire Gawain the counterfeit!  Better
 doth he to-day than he did last night!"
 </p><p>
 He draweth back his spear, and pulleth forth his sword and
 runneth upon him, when the knight crieth him mercy and saith that
 he holdeth himself vanquished.  Messire Gawain bethinketh him
 what he shall do and whether the damsels are looking at him.
 </p><p>
 "Sir knight," saith the elder, "Need you not fear the other
 knight until such time as this one be slain, nor will the evil
 custom be done away so long as this one is on live.  For he is
 the lord of the other and because of the shameful custom hath no
 knight come hither this right long space."
 </p><p>
 "Hearken now," saith the knight, "the great disloyalty of her!
 Nought in the world is there she loved so well in seeming as did
 she me, and now hath she adjudged me my death!"
 </p><p>
 "Again I tell you plainly," saith she, "that never will it be
 done away unless he slay you."
 </p><p>
 Thereupon Messire Gawain lifteth the skirt of his habergeon and
 thrusteth his sword into his body.  Thereupon, lo you, the other
 knight, right angry and sorrowful and full of wrath for his
 fellow that he seeth dead, and cometh in great rage to Messire
 Gawain and Messire Gawain to him, and so stoutly they mell
 together that they pierce the shields and pierce the habergeons
 and break the flesh of the ribs with the points of their spears,
 and the bodies of the knights and their horses hurtle together so
 stiffly that saddle-bows are to-frushed and stirrups loosened and
 girths to-brast and fewtres splintered and spears snapped short,
 and the knights drop to the ground with such a shock that the
 blood rayeth forth at mouth and nose.  In the fall that the
 knight made, Messire Gawain brake his collar-bone in the hurtle.
 Thereupon the dwarf crieth out: "Damsel, your counterfeit Gawain
 doth it well!"
 </p><p>
 "Our Gawain shall he be," say they, "so none take him from us!"
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain draweth from over the knight and cometh toward his
 horse, and right fain would he have let the knight live had it
 not been for the damsels.  For the knight crieth him mercy and
 Messire Gawain had right great pity of him.  Howbeit the damsels
 cry to him; "And you slay him not, the evil custom will not be
 overthrown."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the younger damsel, "And you would slay him, smite
 him in the sole of his foot with your sword, otherwise will he
 not die yet."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the knight, "Your love of me is turned to shame!
 Never more ought knight to set affiance nor love on damsel.  But
 God keep the other that they be not such as you!"
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain marvelleth at this that the damsel saith to him,
 and draweth him back, and hath great pity of the knight, and
 cometh to the other side whither the horses were gone, and taketh
 the saddle of the knight that was dead and setteth it on his own
 horse and draweth him away.  And the wounded knight was
 remounted, for the dwarf had helped him, and fleeth toward the
 forest a great gallop.  And the damsels cry out, "Messire Gawain,
 your pity will be our death this day!  For the Knight without
 Pity is gone for succour, and if he escape, we shall be dead and
 you also!"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XII.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon Messire Gawain leapeth on his horse and taketh a spear
 that was leaning against the tent and followeth the knight in
 such sort that he smiteth him to the ground.  Afterward he saith
 to him: "No further may you go!"
 </p><p>
 "That grieveth me," saith the knight, "For before night should I
 have been avenged of you and of the damsels."
 </p><p>
 And Messire Gawain draweth his sword and thrusteth it into the
 sole of his foot a full palm's breadth, and the knight stretcheth
 himself forth and dieth.  And Messire Gawain returneth back, and
 the damsels make great joy of him and tell him that never
 otherwise could the evil custom have been done away.  For, and he
 had gone his way, all would have been to begin over again, for he
 is of such kind seeing that he was of the kindred of Achilles,
 and that all his ancestors might never otherwise die.  And
 Messire Gawain alighteth, and the damsels would have searched the
 wound in his side, and he telleth them that he taketh no heed
 thereof.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say they, "Again do we proffer you our service, for well
 we know that you are a good knight.  Take for your lady-love
 which of us you will."
 </p><p>
 "Gramercy, damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "Your love do I refuse
 not and to God do I commend you."
 </p><p>
 "How?" say the damsels, "Will you go your way thus?  Certes,
 meeter were it to-day for you to sojourn in this tent and be at
 ease."
 </p><p>
 "It may not be," saith he, "for leisure have I none to abide
 here."
 </p><p>
 "Let him go!" saith the younger, "for the falsest knight is he of
 the world."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the elder, "it grieveth me that he goeth, for
 stay would have pleased me well."
 </p><p>
 Therewithal Messire Gawain departeth and is remounted on his
 horse.  Then he entereth into the forest.
