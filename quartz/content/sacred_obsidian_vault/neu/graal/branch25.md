 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXV</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 Here the story is silent of Lancelot and the knights that are at
 Cardoil, and saith that King Arthur and Messire Gawain are in the
 castle where the priest told Messire Gawain how he was born.  But
 they cannot depart thence at their will, for Ahuret the Bastard
 that was brother of Nabigant of the Rock, that Messire Gawain
 slew on account of Meliot of Logres, knoweth well that they are
 therewithin, and hath assembled his knights and holdeth them
 within so strait that they may not depart without sore damage.
 For he hath on the outer side a full great plenty of knights, and
 the King and Messire Gawain have with them but only five of the
 forest and the country that are upon their side, and they hold
 them so strait within that they may not issue out from thence;
 yea, the brother of Nabigant sweareth that they shall not depart
 thence until such time as he shall have taken Messire Gawain, and
 taken vengeance on his fellow of his brother whom he slew.  The
 King saith to Messire Gawain that he hath much shame of this that
 they are so long shut up therewithin, and that he better loveth
 to die with honour than to live with shame within the castle.  So
 they issued forth, spears in rest, and Ahuret and his knights,
 whereof was there great plenty, made much joy thereat.

 The King and Messire Gawain strike among them, and each
 overthroweth his man; but Ahuret hath great shame of this that he
 seeth his knights put to the worse by so few folk.  He setteth
 his spear in rest and smiteth one of King Arthur's knights
 through the body and beareth him down dead.  Then returneth he to
 Messire Gawain, and buffeteth him so strongly that he pierceth
 his shield, but he maketh drop his own spear and loseth his
 stirrups, and Messire Gawain waxeth wroth and smiteth him so
 grimly and with such force that he maketh him bend back over the
 hinder bow of his saddle.  But Ahuret was strong and of great
 might, and leapeth back between the bows and cometh toward King
 Arthur that he saw before him, but he knew him not.  He left
 Messire Gawain, and the King smiteth him with such a sweep that
 he cutteth off his arm, spear and all.  There was great force of
 knights, so that they ran upon them on all sides; and never would
 they have departed thence sound and whole, but that thereupon
 Meliot of Logres cometh thither with fifteen knights, for that he
 had heard tidings of Messire Gawain, how he was besieged in a
 castle there, where he and King Arthur between them were in such
 plight that they had lost their five knights, so that they were
 not but only two that defended themselves as best they might, as
 they that had no thought but to remain there, for the odds of two
 knights against thirty was too great.

 III.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, behold you, Meliot of Logres with fifteen knights, and
 they come thither where the King and Messire Gawain are in such
 jeopardy, and they strike so stoutly among them that they rescue
 King Arthur and Messire Gawain from them that had taken them by
 the bridle, and so slay full as many as ten of them, and put the
 others to flight, and lead away their lord sore maimed. And
 Messire Gawain giveth Meliot much thanks of the bounty he hath
 done, whereby he hath saved them their lives; and he giveth him
 the castle, and is fain that he hold it of him, for in no place
 might he have better employment, and that well hath he deserved
 it of his service in such need.  Meliot thanketh him much, and
 prayeth Messire Gawain instantly that and he shall have need of
 succour he will come to aid him, in like manner as he would do by
 him everywhere.  And Messire Gawain telleth him that as of this
 needeth him not to make prayer, for that he is one of the knights
 of the world that most he ought of right to love.  The King and
 Messire Gawain take leave of Meliot, and so depart, and Meliot
 garnisheth the castle that was right fair and rich and well-
 seated.
