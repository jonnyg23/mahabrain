 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXIX</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 Therewithal the story is silent of Lancelot, and saith that
 Briant of the Isles is repaired to Cardoil.  Of the forty knights
 that he took with him, but fifteen doth he bring back again.
 Thereof is King Arthur right sorrowful, and saith that he hath
 the fewer friends.  They of the land of Albanie have sent to King
 Arthur and told him that and he would not lose the land for
 evermore he must send them Lancelot, for never saw they knight
 that better knew how to avenge him on his enemies and to do them
 hurt than was he.  The King asketh Briant of the Isles how it is
 that his knights are dead in such sort?
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Briant, "Madeglant hath great force of people, and
 what force of men soever may run upon them, they make a castle of
 their navy in such sort that none may endure against them, and
 never did no folk know so much of war as do they.  The land lieth
 far away from you, and more will it cost you to hold it than it
 is worth; and, if you will believe my counsel, you will trouble
 yourself no more about it, and they of the country would be well
 counselled and they did the same."
 </p><p>
 "Briant," saith the King, "This would be great blame to myself.
 No worshipful man ought to be idle in guarding and holding that
 which is his own.  The worshipful man ought not to hold of things
 so much for their value as for their honour, and if I should
 leave the land disgarnished of my aid and my counsel, they will
 take mine, and will say that I have not heart to protect my land;
 and even now is it great shame to myself that they have settled
 themselves there and would fain draw away them of the land to
 their evil law.  And I would fain that Lancelot had achieved that
 he hath undertaken, and I would have sent him there, for none
 would protect the land better than he, and, were he now there
 along with forty knights and with them of the country, Madeglant
 would make but short stay there."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Briant, "They of the country reckon nought of you
 nor any other but Lancelot only, and they say that and you send
 him there they will make him King."
 </p><p>
 "It may well be that they say so," saith the King, "But never
 would Lancelot do aught that should be against my will."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Briant, "Sith that you are not minded to believe me,
 I will say no more in this matter, but in the end his knighthood
 will harm you rather than help you and you take no better heed
 thereof than up to this time you have done."
