 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch III</h1> 
 INCIPIT.
 <p>
 Here beginneth another branch of the Graal in the name of the
 Father, and in the name of the Son, and in the name of the Holy
 Ghost.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 TITLE I
 </p><p>
 Here is the story silent of the three damsels and the Car and
 saith that Messire Gawain hath passed throughout the evil forest
 and is entered into the forest passing fair, the broad, the high,
 the plenteous of venison.  And he rideth a great pace, but sore
 abashed is he of that the damsel had said to him, and misdoubteth
 him but he shall have blame thereof in many places.  He rode hard
 the day long till that it was evensong and the sun was about to
 set.  And he looketh before him and seeth the house of a hermit
 and the chapel in the thick of the forest; and a spring flowed
 forth in front of the chapel right clear and fresh, and above it
 was a tree full broad and tall that threw a shadow over the
 spring.  A damsel sate under the tree and held a mule by the
 reins and at the saddle-bow had she the head of a knight hanging.
 And Messire Gawain cometh thitherward and alighteth.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith he, "God give you good adventure!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "And you always."
 </p><p>
 When she was risen up over against him, "Damsel," saith he, "For
 whom are you a-waiting here?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "I am waiting for the hermit of this holy
 chapel, that is gone into the forest, and I would fain ask him
 tidings of a knight."
 </p><p>
 "Think you he will tell you them and he knoweth any?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea, sir, I think so, according to that I have been told."
 </p><p>
 Therewithal behold you the hermit that was coming, and saluteth
 the damsel and Messire Gawain and openeth the door of the house
 and setteth the two steeds within and striketh off the bridles
 and giveth them green-meat first and barley after, and fain would
 he have taken off the saddles when Messire Gawain leapeth before:
 "Sir," saith he, "Do not so!  This business is not for you!"
 </p><p>
 "Hermit though I be," saith he, "yet well know I how to deal
 withal, for at the court of King Uther Pendragon have I been
 squire and knight two-score years, and a score or mort have I
 been in this hermitage."
 </p><p>
 And Messire Gawain looketh at him in wonderment. "Sir," saith he,
 "Meseemeth you are not of more than forty years."
 </p><p>
 "That know I well of a truth," saith the hermit, and Messire
 Gawain taketh off the saddles and bethinketh him more of the
 damsel's mule than of his own horse.  And the hermit taketh
 Messire Gawain by the hand and the damsel and leadeth them into
 the chapel.  And the place was right fair.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit to Messire Gawain, "You will disarm you
 not," saith he, "for this forest is passing adventurous, and no
 worshipful man behoveth be disgarnished."
 </p><p>
 He goeth for his spear and for his shield and setteth them within
 the chapel.  He setteth before them such meat as he hath, and
 when they have eaten giveth them to drink of the spring.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel, "Of a knight that I go seek am I come to
 ask you tidings."
 </p><p>
 "Who is the knight?" saith the hermit.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, he is the Chaste Knight of most holy lineage.  He hath a
 heart of gold, the look of a lion, the navel of a virgin maid, a
 heart of steel, the body of an elephant, and without wickedness
 are all his conditions."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the hermit, "Nought will I tell you concerning
 him, for I know not of a certainty where he is, save this, that
 he hath lain in this chapel twice, not once only, within this
 twelvemonth."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "Will you tell me no more of him, nor none
 other witting?"
 </p><p>
 "In no wise," saith the hermit.
 </p><p>
 "And you, Messire Gawain?" saith she.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith he, "As fainly would I see him as you, but none
 find I that may tell me tidings of him."
 </p><p>
 "And the damsel of the Car, Sir, have you seen her?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea, lady," saith he, "It is but just now sithence that I left
 her."
 </p><p>
 "Carried she still her arm slung at her neck?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea," saith Messire Gawain, "in such wise she carried it."
 </p><p>
 "Of a long while," saith the damsel, "hath she borne it thus." 
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "how are you named?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "Gawain am I called, King Arthur's nephew." 
 </p><p>
 "Thereof I love you the better," saith the hermit.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel, "You are of kindred to the worst King
 that is."
 </p><p>
 "Of what King speak you?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "I speak," saith she, "of King Arthur, through whom is all the
 world made worser, for he began doing well and now hath become
 evil.  For hatred of him hate I a knight that found me nigh S.
 Augustine's Chapel, and yet was he the comeliest knight that saw
 I ever.  He slew a knight within the bar right hardily.  I asked
 him for the head of the knight and he went back for the same and
 set himself in sore peril.  He brought it me, and I made him
 great joy, but when he told me his name was Arthur I had no
 fainness of the bounty he had done me, for that he had the name
 of that evil King."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "You may say your pleasure.  I
 tell you that King Arthur hath held the richest court that he
 hath held ever, and these evil conditions whereof you blame him
 is he minded to put away for evermore, and more will he do of
 good and more of largesse than was ever known aforetime so long
 as he shall live; nor know I none other knight that beareth his
 name."
 </p><p>
 "You are right," saith the damsel, "to come to his rescue, for
 that he is your uncle, but your rescue will scarce avail him and
 he deliver not himself."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit to Messire Gawain, "The damsel will say
 her pleasure.  May God defend King Arthur, for his father made me
 knight.  Now am I priest, and in this hermitage ever sithence
 that I came hither have I served King Fisherman by the will of
 Our Lord and His commandment, and all they that serve him do well
 partake of his reward, for the place of his most holy service is
 a refuge so sweet that unto him that hath been there a year, it
 seemeth to have been but a month for the holiness of the place
 and of himself, and for the sweetness of his castle wherein have
 I oftentimes done service in the chapel where the Holy Graal
 appeareth.  Therefore is it that I and all that serve him are so
 youthful of seeming."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "By what way may a man go to his
 castle?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "None may teach you the way, save the
 will of God lead you therein.  And would you fain go thither?" 
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "It is the most wish that I have."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "Now God give you grace and courage to
 ask the question that the others to whom the Graal hath appeared
 would ask not, whereof have many mischances sithence befallen
 much people."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 With that, they left of talking, and the hermit led Messire
 Gawain into his house to rest, and the damsel abode still in the
 chapel.  On the morrow when dawn appeared, Messire Gawain that
 had lain all armed, arose and found his saddle ready and the
 damsel, and the bridles set on, and cometh to the chapel and
 findeth the hermit that was apparelled to sing mass, and seeth
 the damsel kneeling before an image of Our Lady, and she prayed
 God and the sweet Lady that they would counsel her that whereof
 she had need, and wept right tenderly so that the tears ran down
 her face.  And when she had prayed of a long space she ariseth,
 and Messire Gawain biddeth her God give her good day, and she
 returneth his salute.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith he, "Meseemeth you are not over joyous."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "I have right, for now am I nigh unto my
 desolation, sith that I may not find the Good Knight.  Now must I
 needs go to the castle of the Black Hermit, and bear thither the
 head that hangeth at my saddle-bow, for otherwise shall I not be
 able to pass through the forest but my body should there be cast
 in prison or shamed, and this shall be the quittance for my
 passing.  Then will I seek the Damsel of the Car and so shall I
 go in safer through the forest."
 </p><p>
 With that the hermit had begun the mass and Messire Gawain and
 the damsel heard it.  When mass was sung, Messire Gawain took
 leave of the hermit and the damsel also.  And Messire Gawain
 goeth one way and the damsel the other, and either biddeth other
 to God.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 Hereupon the story is now silent of the damsel, and saith that
 Messire Gawain goeth through the high forest and rideth a great
 pace, and prayeth God right sweetly that He will set him in such
 way as that thereby he may go to the land of the rich King
 Fisherman.  And he rideth until the hour of noon, and cometh into
 the fulness of the forest and seeth under a tree a squire
 alighted of a horse of the chase.  Messire Gawain saluteth him,
 and the squire saith: "Sir, right welcome may you be!"
 </p><p>
 "Fair sweet friend," saith Messire Gawain, "Whither go you?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, I go to seek the lord of this forest."
 </p><p>
 "Whose is the forest?" saith Messire Gawain. "Sir, it belongeth
 to the best knight in the world."
 </p><p>
 "Can you tell me tidings of him?"
 </p><p>
 "He ought to bear a shield banded azure and argent with a red
 cross thereon and a boss of gold.  I say that he is good knight,
 but little call have I to praise him, for he slew my father in
 this forest with a javelin.  The Good Knight was squire what time
 he slew him, and fain would I avenge my father upon him and I may
 find him, for he reft me of the best knight that was in the realm
 of Logres when he slew my father.  Well did he bereave me of him
 what time he slew him with his javelin without defiance, nor
 shall I never be at ease nor at rest until I shall have avenged
 him."
 </p><p>
 "Fair sweet friend," saith Messire Gawain, "Sith that he is
 knight so good take heed you increase not your wrong of your own
 act, and I would fain that you had found him, so as that no evil
 had befallen him thereof."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 "So would not I," saith the squire, "for never shall I see him in
 this place but I shall run upon him as my mortal enemy!"
 </p><p>
 "Fair sweet friend," saith Messire Gawain, "you may say your
 pleasure, but tell me is there no hold in this forest wherein I ú
 may harbour me the night?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the squire, "No hold know I within twenty league of
 your way in any quarter.  Wherefore no leisure have you to tarry,
 for it is high noon already."
 </p><p>
 So Messire Gawain saluteth the squire and goeth a great pace as
 he that knoweth neither highway nor byway save only as adventure
 may lead him.  And the forest pleaseth him well for that it is so
 fair and that he seeth the deer pass by before him in great
 herds.  He rode on until it drew toward evensong at a corner of
 the forest.  The evening was fair and calm and the sun was about
 to set.  And a score league Welsh had he ridden sithence that he
 parted from the squire, and sore he misdoubted him that he should
 find no hold.  He found the fairest meadow-land in the world, and
 looked before him when he had ridden a couple of bow-shot lengths
 and saw a castle appear nigh the forest on a mountain.  And it
 was enclosed of high walls with battlements, and within were fair
 halls whereof the windows showed in the outer walls, and in the
 midst was an ancient tower that was compassed round of great
 waters and broad meadow-lands.  Thitherward Messire Gawain
 draweth him and looketh toward the gateway of the castle and
 seeth a squire issue forth a great pace upon a hackney, and he
 came the way that Messire Gawain was coming.  And when the squire
 seeth him, and hath drawn somewhat anigh, he saluteth him right
 nobly.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, right welcome may you be!"
 </p><p>
 "Good adventure may you have!" saith Messire Gawain.  "Fair sweet
 friend, what is this castle here, sir?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, it is the castle of the Widow Lady."
 </p><p>
 "What is the name thereof;"
 </p><p>
 "Camelot; and it belonged to Alain li Gros, that was a right
 loyal knight and worshipful man.  He is dead this long time, and
 my Lady hath remained without succour and without counsel.
 Wherefore is the castle warred upon of them that would fain reave
 her thereof by force.  The Lord of the Moors and another knight
 are they that war upon her and would fain reave her of this
 castle as they have reft he of seven other already.  Greatly
 desireth she the return of her son, for no counsel hath she save
 only of her one daughter and of five old knights that help her to
 guard the castle.  Sir," saith he, "The door is made fast and the
 bridge drawn up, for they guard the castle closely, but, so
 please you, you will tell me your name and I will go before and
 make the bridge be 1owered and the gate unfastened, and will say
 that you will lodge within to-night."
 </p><p>
 "Gramercy," saith Messire Gawain, "right well shall my name be
 known or ever I depart from the castle."
 </p><p>
 The squire goeth his way a great pace, and Messire Gawain tided
 softly at a walk for he had yet a long way to go.  And he found a
 chapel that stood between the forest and the castle, and it was
 builded upon four columns of marble and within was a right fair
 sepulchre.  The chapel had no fence of any kind about it so that
 he seeth the coffin within full clearly, and Messire Gawain
 bideth awhile to look thereon.  And the squire entered into the
 castle and hath made the bridge be lowered and the door opened.
 He alighteth and is come into the hall when was the Widow Lady
 and her daughter.  Saith the Lady to the squire: "Wherefore have
 you returned from doing my message?  Lady, for the comeliest
 knight that I have seen ever, and fain would he harbour within
 to-night, and he is garnished of all arms and rideth without
 company."
 </p><p>
 "And what name hath he?" saith the Lady.
 </p><p>
 "Lady, he told me you should know it well or ever he depart
 from this castle."
 </p><p>
 Therewithal the Lady gan weep for joy and her daughter also, and,
 lifting her hands towards heaven, "Fair Lord God!" saith the
 Widow Lady, "And this be indeed my son, never before have I had
 joy that might be likened to this!  Now shall I not be disherited
 of mine honour, neither shall I lose my castle whereof they would
 fain reave me by wrong, for that no Lord nor champion have I!"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon the Widow Lady ariseth up and her daughter likewise,
 and they go over the bridge of the castle and see Messire Gawain
 that was yet looking on the coffin within the chapel.
 </p><p>
 "Now haste!" saith the Lady; "At the tomb shall we be well able
 to see whether it be he!"
 </p><p>
 They go to the chapel right speedily, and Messire Gawain seeth
 them coming and alighteth. "Lady, saith he, "Welcome may you be,
 you and your company."
 </p><p>
 The Lady answereth never a word until that they are come to the
 tomb.  When she findeth it not open she falleth down in a swoon.
 And Messire Gawain is sore afraid when he seeth it.  The Lady
 cometh back out of her swoon and breaketh out into great
 lamentation.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel to Messire Gawain, "Welcome may you be!
 But now sithence my mother supposed that you had been her son and
 made great joy thereof, and now seeth she plainly that you are
 not he, whereof is she sore sorrowful, for so soon as he shall
 return, this coffin behoveth open, nor until that hour shall none
 know who it is that lieth therein."
 </p><p>
 The Lady riseth up and taketh Messire Gawain by the hand. "Sir,"
 saith she, "What is your name?"
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "I am called Gawain, King Arthur's nephew."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "You shall be he that is welcome both for the
 sake of my son and for your own sake."
 </p><p>
 The Lady biddeth a squire lead his horse into the castle and
 carry his shield and spear.  Then they enter into the castle and
 lead Messire Gawain into the hall, and make disarm him.  After
 that, they fetch him water to wash his hands and his face, for he
 was distained of the rust of his habergeon.  The Lady maketh
 apparel him in a rich robe of silk and gold, and furred of
 ermine.  The Widow Lady cometh forth of her chamber and maketh
 Messire Gawain sit beside her.  "Sir," saith she, "Can you tell
 me any tidings of my son that I have not seen of this long time
 past, and of whom at this present am I sore in need?"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VIII.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "No tidings of him know I to tell you, and
 right heavy am I thereof, for he is the knight of the world that
 fainest I would see and he be your son as I am told.  What name
 hath he?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "His name in right baptism is Perceval, and a
 right comely squire was he when he departed hence.  Now as at
 this time is it said that he is the comeliest knight on live and
 the most hardy and the cleanest of all wickedness.  And sore need
 have I of his hardiment, for what time that he departed hence he
 left me in the midst of a great warfare on behalf of the Knight
 of the Red Shield that he slew.  Within the se'nnight thereafter
 he went away, nor never once have I seen him sithence, albeit a
 full seven year hath passed already.  And now the brother of the
 knight that he slew and the Lord of the Moors are warring upon me
 and are fain to reave me of my castle and God counsel me not. 
 For my brothers are too far away from me, and King Pelles of the
 Lower Folk hath renounced his land for God's sake and entered
 into a hermitage.  But the King of Castle Mortal hath in him as
 much of wickedness and felony as these twain have in them of
 good, and enough thereof have they.  But neither succour nor help
 may they give me, for the King of Castle Mortal challengeth my
 Lord King Fisherman both of the most Holy Graal and of the Lance
 whereof the point bleedeth every day, albeit God forbid he should
 ever have them."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IX.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Messire Gawain, "There was at the hostel of King
 Fisherman a knight before whom the Holy Graal appeared three
 times, yet never once would he ask whereof it served nor whom it
 honoured."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Widow Lady's daughter, "You say true, and the
 Best Knight is he of the world.  This say I for love of my
 brother, and I love all knights for the love of him, but by the
 foolish wit of the knight hath mine uncle King Fisherman fallen
 into languishment."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Lady, "Behoveth all good knights go see the rich
 King Fisherman.  Will you not therefore go?"
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Messire Gawain, "Yea, that will I, so speedily as I
 may, for not elsewhither have I emprised my way."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "Then are you going to see my son, wherefore
 tell my son, and you see him, of mine evil plight and my misease,
 and King Fisherman my brother.  But take heed, Messire Gawain,
 that you be better mindful than was the knight."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Messire Gawain, "I shall do as God shall teach me." 
 </p><p>
 In the meanwhile as they were speaking thus together, behold you
 therewithal the Widow Lady's five knights that were come in from
 the forest and make bring harts and hinds and wild swine.  So
 they alighted and made great joy of Messire Gawain when they knew
 who he was.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 X.
 </p><p>
 When the meat was ready they sate to eat, and full plenteously
 were they provided and right well were they served.  Thereupon,
 behold, cometh the squire that had opened the door for Messire
 Gawain, and kneeleth before the Widow Lady.
 </p><p>
 "And what tidings?" saith she.
 </p><p>
 "Lady, there is to be a right great assembly of tourney in the
 valleys that aforetime were ours.  Already have they spread the
 Welsh booths, and thither are come these two that are warring
 upon you and great store other knights.  And they have ordained
 that he which shall do best at the assembly shall undertake the
 garrison of this castle in such sort as that he shall hold it for
 his own alone against all other."
 </p><p>
 The Widow Lady beginneth to weep: "Sir," saith she to Messire
 Gawain, "Now may you understand that the castle is not mine own,
 sith that these knights say it is theirs as you hear."
 </p><p>
 "Certes, Lady," saith he, "Herein do they great dishonour and a
 sin."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XI.
 </p><p>
 When the table was removed the damsel fell at Messire Gawain's
 feet, weeping.  He raiseth her forthwith and saith to her,
 "Damsel, herein do you ill."
 </p><p>
 "For God's sake, Sir, take pity on my Lady mother and me!"
 </p><p>
 "Certes, damsel, great pity have I of you."
 </p><p>
 "Sir, now shall it be seen in this strait whether you be good
 knight, for good is the knighthood that doeth well for God's
 sake."
 </p><p>
 The Widow Lady and her daughter go into the chamber, and Messire
 Gawain's bed was made in the midst of the hall.  So he went and
 lay down as did also the five knights.  All the night was Messire
 Gawain in much thought.  The morrow, when he was risen, he went
 to hear mass in a chapel that was within and ate thereafter three
 sops in wine and then armed him, and at the same time asked the
 five knights that were there in the hall whether they would go
 see the assembly.
 </p><p>
 "Yea, Sir," say they, "and you be going thither."
 </p><p>
 "In faith, thither verily will I go!" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 The knights are armed forthwith, and their horses brought and
 Messire Gawain's, and he goeth to take leave of the Widow Lady
 and her daughter.  But great joy make they of this that they have
 heard say that he will go with their knights to the assembly.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XII.
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain and the five knights mounted and issued forth of
 the castle and rode a great gallop before a forest.  Messire
 Gawain looketh before him about the foreclose of the forest, and
 seeth the fairest purlieus that he had seen ever, and so broad
 they be that he may not see nor know the fourth part thereof.
 They are garnished of tall forests on one hand and on the other,
 and there are high rocks in the midst with wild deer among.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say the knights, "Lo, these be the Valleys of Camelot
 whereof my Lady and her daughter have been bereft, and bereft
 also hath she been of the richest castles that be in Wales to the
 number of seven."
 </p><p>
 "A wrong is it and a sin!" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 So far have they ridden that they see the ensigns and the shields
 there where the assembly is to be held, and they see already
 mounted the more part of the knights all armed and running their
 horses down the meadow-land.  And they see the tents stretched on
 the one hand and on another.  And Messire Gawain bideth, and the
 five knights under a tree, and see the knights assembling on one
 hand and on another.  One of the five knights that were with him
 gave him witting of the Lord of the Moors and the brother of the
 knight of the Red Shield that had to name Chaos the Red.  So soon
 as the tournament was assembled, Messire Gawain and the knights
 come to the assembly, and Messire Gawain goeth to a Welsh knight
 and beareth him to the ground, both him and his horse, all in a
 heap.  And the five come after at a great gallop and each
 overthroweth his own, and greatly pride they themselves of
 Messire Gawain.  Chaos the Red seeth Messire Gawain but knoweth
 him not.  He goeth toward him a full career, and Messire Gawain
 receiveth him on the point of his spear and hurtleth against him
 so sore that he all to-brast his collarbone and maketh the spear
 fly from his fist.  And Messire Gawain searcheth the fellowships
 of one part and the other, and findeth not nor encountereth no
 knight before him in his way but he putteth him off his horse or
 woundeth him, either by himself or by one of the five knights,
 that make right great joy of that they see him do.  They show him
 the Lord of the Moors that was coming with a full great
 fellowship of folk.  He goeth thitherward a great gallop.  They
 mell together either upon other of their spears that they bent
 and all to-brast in flinders, and hurtle together so stoutly both
 of their horses and their bodies that the Lord of the Moors
 loseth his stirrups and hath the hinder saddlebow to-frushed, and
 falleth down to the ground over his horse croup in such sort that
 the peak of his helm dinteth a full palm's breadth into the turf.
 And Messire Gawain taketh the horse that was right rich and good,
 maugre all of his fellowship, and giveth it to one of the five
 knights that maketh it be led to Camelot of a squire.  Messire
 Gawain searcheth the ranks on the one hand and on the other, and
 doeth such feats of arms as never no knight might do the same
 again.  The five knights also showed great hardiment, and did
 more of arms that day than ever had they done tofore, for not one
 of them but had overthrown at least a single knight and won his
 horse.  The Lord of the Moors was mounted again on another rich
 horse and had great shame for that Messire Gawain had overthrown
 him.  He espieth Messire Gawain and goeth toward him a great
 gallop and thinketh to avenge his shame.  They come together
 either on other with a great shock, and Messire Gawain smiteth
 him with the truncheon of his spear that he had still left, in
 the midst of his breast, so that it was all to-splintered.  The
 Lord of the Moors likewise again to-brast his spear upon him.
 Messire Gawain draweth his sword and flingeth the truncheon to
 the ground.  The Lord of the Moors doth likewise and commandeth
 his folk not to mell betwixt them twain, for never yet had he
 found no knight that he had not conquered.  They deal them great
 buffets on the helms, either upon other, in such sort that the
 sparks fly thereout and their swords are blunted.  The buffets of
 Messire Gawain are heavier than the other's, for he dealeth them
 so mighty and horrible that the blood rayeth out from the Lord of
 the Moors by the mouth and the nose so that his habergeon is all
 bloody thereof and he may no more endure.  Thereupon he yieldeth
 him prisoner to Messire Gawain, that is right glad thereof and
 his live knights likewise.  The Lord of the Moors goeth to his
 tent to alight, and Messire Gawain with him and alighteth.  And
 Messire Gawain taketh the horse and saith to one of the knights,
 "Keep this for me."
 </p><p>
 And all the knights are repaired to their tents, and with one
 accord say they all that the knight of the Red Shield with the
 eagle of gold thereon hath done better than we, and they ask the
 Lord of the Moors whether he accordeth with them, and he saith
 "Aye."
 </p><p>
 " Sir," saith he to Messire Gawain, "You, then, are the warden of
 this castle of Camelot."
 </p><p>
 "Gramercy, lord!" saith Messire Gawain.  He calleth the five
 knights and saith unto them: "Lords, my will is that you be there
 on my behalf and that you shall safeguard the same by consent of
 the knights that are here present."
 </p><p>
 "Sir, right gladly do we agree thereto."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain to the Lord of the Moors, "I give you
 moreover as my prisoner to the Widow Lady that harboured me last
 night."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "This have you no right to do.  Assembly of
 tourney is not war.  Hence have you no right to imprison my body
 in castle, for well am I able to pay my ransom here.  But tell
 me, what is your name?"
 </p><p>
 "I am called Gawain."
 </p><p>
 "Ha, Messire Gawain, many a time have I heard tell of you albeit
 never tofore have I seen you.  But sith that the castle of
 Camelot is in your keeping, I promise you loyally that before a
 year and a day neither the castle nor none of the Lady's land
 need fear nought from me nor from any other so far forth as I may
 hinder him, and hereto do I pledge me in the presence of all
 these knights that are here.  And, so you would have of me gold
 or silver, thereof will I give you at your will."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "Gramercy!  I consent freely to as
 much as you have said."
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain taketh leave and turneth him again toward the
 castle of Camelot, and sendeth by a squire the horse of the Lord
 of the Moors to the daughter of the Widow Lady, that made great
 joy thereof.  And the five knights drive before them the horses
 they have taken booty.  Whereof great also was the joy.  No need
 to wonder whether Messire Gawain were well harboured that night
 at the castle.  He recounted to the Lady how the castle was in
 the keeping of these knights.  When it came to morning-tide,
 Messire Gawain took leave and departed from the castle, but not
 before he had heard mass, for such was his custom.  The Widow
 Lady and her daughter commend him to God, and the castle
 remaineth in better keeping than he had found it.
