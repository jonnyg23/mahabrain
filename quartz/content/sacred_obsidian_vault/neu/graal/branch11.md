 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XI</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 This High History witnesseth whereof this account cometh, and
 saith that Perceval is in the kingdom of Logres, and came great
 pace toward the land of the Queen of the Tents to release the
 Damsel of the Car, that he had left in hostage on account of
 Clamados, that had put upon him the treason whereof behoved him
 to defend himself.  But, or ever he entered into the land of the
 Queen of the Tents, he met the Damsel of the Car that was coming
 thence.  She made right great joy of him, and told him that
 Clamados was dead of the wound that Meliot of Logres had dealt
 him, and that Meliot of Logres was heal.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "The tents and the awnings are taken down, and
 the Queen hath withdrawn herself to the castle with her maidens,
 and by my coming back from thence may you well know that you are
 altogether quit.  Wherefore I tell you that your sister goeth in
 quest of you, and that never had your mother so sore need of help
 as now she hath, nor never again shall your sister have joy at
 heart until such time as she shall have found you.  She goeth
 seeking for you by all the kingdoms and strange countries in sore
 mis-ease, nor may she find any to tell her tidings of you."
 </p><p>
 Therewith Perceval departeth from the Damsel, without saying
 more, and rideth until he cometh into the kingdom of Wales to a
 castle that is seated above the sea upon a high rock, and it was
 called the Castle of Tallages.  He seeth a knight issue from the
 castle and asketh whose hold it is, and he telleth him that it
 belonged to the Queen of the Maidens.  He entereth into the first
 baby of the castle, and alighteth at the mounting-stage and
 setteth down his shield and his spear, and looketh toward the
 steps whereby one goeth up to the higher hall, and seeth upon
 them row upon row of knights and damsels.  He cometh thitherward,
 but never a knight nor dame was there that gave him greeting of
 any kind.  So he saluted them at large.  He went his way right
 amidst them toward the door of the great hall, which he findeth
 shut, and rattled the ring so loud that it made the whole hall
 resound thereof.  A knight cometh to open it and he entereth in.
 </p><p>
 "Sir Knight, welcome may you be!"
 </p><p>
 "Good adventure may you have!" saith Perceval.
 </p><p>
 He lowereth his ventail and taketh off his helm.  The knight
 leadeth him to the Queen's chamber, and she riseth to meet him,
 and maketh great joy of him, and maketh him sit beside her all
 armed.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 "With that, cometh a damsel and kneeleth before the Queen and
 saith: "Lady, behold here the knight that was first at the Graal.
 I saw him in the court of the Queen of the Tents, there where he
 was appeached of treason and murder."
 </p><p>
 "Now haste," saith the Queen to the knight, "Let sound the ivory
 horn upon the castle."
 </p><p>
 The knights and damsels that were sitting on the steps leapt up,
 and make right great joy, and the other knights likewise.  They
 say that now they know well that they have done their penance.
 Thereupon they enter into the hall, and the Lady issueth from her
 chamber and taketh Perceval by the hand and goeth to meet them. 
 </p><p>
 "Behold here," saith she, "the knight through whom you have had
 the pain and travail, and by whom you are now released
 therefrom!"
 </p><p>
 "Ha!" say the knights and dames, "welcome may he be!"
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the Queen, "so is he, for he is the knight of
 the world that I had most desire to see."
 </p><p>
 She maketh disarm him, and bring the rich robe of cloth of silk
 to apparel him. "Sir," saith the Queen, "Four knights and three
 damsels have been under the steps at the entrance of the hall
 ever since such time as you were at the hostel of King Fisherman,
 there where you forgot to ask whereof the Graal might serve, nor
 never since have they had none other house nor hold wherein to
 eat nor to drink nor to lie, nor never since have they had no
 heart to make joy, nor would not now and you had not come hither.
 Wherefore ought you not to marvel that they make joy of your
 coming.  Howbeit, on the other hand, sore need have we in this
 castle of your coming, for a knight warreth upon me that is
 brother of King Fisherman, and his name is the King of Castle
 Mortal."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "He is my uncle, albeit I knew it not of a long
 time, nor of the good King Fisherman either, and the good King
 Hermit is my uncle also.  But I tell you of a very truth, the
 King of Castle Mortal is the most fell and cruel that liveth,
 wherefore ought none to love him for the felony that is in him,
 for he hath begun to war upon King Fisherman my uncle, and
 challengeth him his castle, and would fain have the Lance and the
 Graal."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Queen, "in like sort challengeth he my castle of
 me for that I am in aid of King Fisherman, and every week cometh
 he to an island that is in this sea, and oft-times cometh
 plundering before this castle and hath slain many of my knights
 and damsels, whereof God grant us vengeance upon him."
 </p><p>
 She taketh Perceval by the hand and leadeth him to the windows of
 the hall that were nighest the sea.  "Sir," saith she, "Now may
 you see the island, there, whereunto your uncle cometh in a
 galley, and in this island sojourneth he until he hath seen where
 to aim his blow and laid his plans.  And here below, see, are my
 gallies that defend us thereof."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 Perceval, as the history telleth, was much honoured at the castle
 of the Queen of the Maidens, that was right passing fair.  The
 Queen loved him of a passing great love, but well she knew that
 she should never have her desire, nor any dame nor damsel that
 might set her intent thereon, for chaste was he and in chastity
 was fain to die.  So long was he at the castle as that he heard
 tell his uncle was arrived at the island whither he wont to come.
 Perceval maketh arm him forthwith and entereth into a galley
 below the hall, and maketh him be rowed toward his uncle, that
 much marvelleth when he seeth him coming, for never aforetime
 durst no knight issue out alone from this castle to meet him, nor
 to come there where he was, body to body.  But had he known that
 it was Perceval, he would not have marvelled.  Thereupon the
 galley taketh the ground and Perceval is issued forth.  The Queen
 and the knights and her maidens are come to the windows of the
 castle to behold the bearing of the nephew and the uncle.  The
 Queen would have sent over some of her knights with him, but
 Perceval would not.  The King of Castle Mortal was tall and
 strong and hardy.  He seeth his nephew come all armed, but
 knoweth him not.  But Perceval knew him well, and kept his sword
 drawn and his shield on his arm, and sought out his uncle with
 right passing wrathfulness, and dealeth him a heavy buffet above
 upon his helm that he maketh him stoop withal.  Howbeit, the King
 spareth him not, but smiteth him so passing stoutly that he had
 his helm all dinted in thereby.  But Perceval attacketh him
 again, thinking to strike him above on the head, but the King
 swerveth aside and the blow falleth on the shield and cleaveth it
 right down as far as the boss.  The King of Castle Mortal draweth
 him backward and hath great shame within himself for that
 Perceval should thus fettle him, for he searcheth him with his
 sword in every part, and dealeth him great buffets in such sort
 that, and his habergeon had not been so strong and tough, he
 would have wounded him in many places.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 The King himself giveth him blows so heavy that the Queen and all
 they that were at the windows marvelled how Perceval might abide
 such buffets.  The King took witting of the shield that Perceval
 bare, and looketh on it of a long space.
 </p><p>
 "Knight," saith he, "who gave you this shield, and on behalf of
 whom do you bear such an one?"
 </p><p>
 "I bear it on behalf of my father," saith he.
 </p><p>
 "Did your father, then, bear a red shield with a white hart?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea," saith Perceval, "Many a day."
 </p><p>
 "Was your father, then, King Alain of the Valleys of Camelot?"
 </p><p>
 "My father was he without fail.  No blame ought I to have of him,
 for a good knight was he and a loyal."
 </p><p>
 "Are you the son of Yglais my sister, that was his wife?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea!" saith Perceval.
 </p><p>
 "Then are you my nephew," saith the King of Castle Mortal, "For
 she was my sister."
 </p><p>
 "That misliketh me," saith Perceval, "For thereof have I neither
 worship nor honour, for the most disloyal are you of all my
 kindred, and I knew well when I came hither that it was you, and,
 for the great disloyalty that is in you, you war upon the best
 King that liveth and the most worshipful man, and upon the Lady
 of this castle for that she aideth him in all that she may.  But,
 please God, henceforward she shall have no need to guard her to
 the best of her power against so evil a man as are you, nor shall
 her castle never be obedient to you, nor the sacred hallows that
 the good King hath in his keeping.  For God loveth not you so
 much as He doth him, and so long as you war upon him, you do I
 defy and hold you as mine enemy."
 </p><p>
 The King wotteth well that his nephew holdeth him not over dear,
 and that he is eager to do him a hurt, and that he holdeth his
 sword in his fist and that he is well roofed-in of his helmet,
 and that he is raging like a lion.  He misdoubteth him sore of
 his strength and his great hardiment.  He hath well proven and
 essayed that he is the Best Knight of the world.  He durst no
 longer abide his blows, but rather he turneth him full speed
 toward his galley, and leapeth thereinto forthwith.  He pusheth
 out from the shore incontinent, and Perceval followeth him right
 to the beach, full heavy that he hath gotten him away.  Then he
 crieth after him: "Evil King, tell me not that I am of your
 kindred!  Never yet did knight of my mother's lineage flee from
 other knight, save you alone!  Now have I conquered this island,
 and never on no day hereafter be you so over-hardy as be seen
 therein again!"
 </p><p>
 The King goeth his way as he that hath no mind to return, and
 Perceval cometh back again in his galley to the Queen's castle,
 and all they of the palace come forth to meet him with great joy.
 The Queen asketh him how it is with him and whether he is
 wounded?
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "Not at all, thank God."
 </p><p>
 She maketh disarm him, and honoureth him at her pleasure, and
 commandeth that all be obedient to him, and do his commandment so
 long as he shall please to be there.  Now feel they safer in the
 castle for that the king hath so meanly departed thence, and it
 well seemeth them that never will he dare come back for dread of
 his nephew more than of any other, whereof make they much joy in
 common.
