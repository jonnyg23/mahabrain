 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXVI</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 Of Meliot the story is here silent, and saith that King Arthur
 and Messire Gawain have ridden so far that they are come into the
 Isle of Avalon, there where the Queen lieth.  They lodge the
 night with the hermits, that made them right great cheer.  But
 you may well say that the King is no whit joyful when he seeth
 the coffin where the Queen lieth and that wherein the head of his
 son lieth.  Thereof is his dole renewed, and he saith that this
 holy place of this holy chapel ought he of right to love better
 than all other places on earth.  They depart on the morrow when
 they have heard mass.  The King goeth the quickest he may toward
 Cardoil, and findeth the land wasted and desolate in many places,
 whereof is he right sorrowful, and understandeth that Kay the
 Seneschal warreth upon him with the others.  He marvelleth much
 how he durst do it.  He is come to Cardoil.  When they of the
 castle know it they come to meet him with right great cheer.  The
 tidings went throughout all the land, and they of the country
 were right joyous thereof, for the more part believed that he was
 dead.  They of the castle of the Hard Rock knew it, but little
 rejoiced they thereat.  But Kay the Seneschal was whole of his
 wound and bethought him that great folly would he do to remain
 longer there to war upon the King, for well knew he that and the
 King held him and did that which he had proclaimed, his end were
 come.  He departeth from the castle, where he had sojourned of a
 long while, and crossed again stealthily over-sea, and came into
 Little Britain, and made fast a castle for fear of the King, that
 is called Chinon, and was there long time, without the King
 warring upon him, for enough adventures had he in other parts.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 To Cardoil was the King repaired and Messire Gawain.  You may
 well understand that the land was much rejoiced thereof, and that
 all the knights were greatly comforted, and knights came back to
 the court from all parts.  They that had been wounded were whole
 again.  Briant of the Isles stinted not of his pride nor of his
 outrage, but rather stirred up the war the most he might, he and
 Meliant still more, and said that never would he cease therefrom
 until death, nor never would he have rest until such time as he
 should have vengeance of Lancelot.  The King was one day at
 Cardoil at meat, and there was in the hall great throng of
 knights, and Messire Gawain sate beside the King.  Lancelot sate
 at the table, and Messire Ywain the son of King Urien, and
 Sagramors li Desirous, and Ywain li Aoutres, and many more other
 knights round about the table, but there were not so many as
 there wont to be.  Messire Lucan the Butler served before the
 King of the golden cup.  The King looked round about the table
 and remembered him of the Queen.  He was bent upon thinking
 rather than on eating, and saw that his court was much wasted and
 worsened of her death.  And what time the King was musing in such
 sort, behold you a knight come into the hall all armed before the
 King; and he leaneth on the staff of his spear.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "Listen, so please you, to me, and all
 these others, listen!  Madeglant of Oriande sendeth me here to
 you, and commandeth that you yield up the Table Round to him, for
 sith that the Queen is dead, you have no right thereof, for he is
 her next of kin and he that hath the best right to have and to
 hold it; and, so you do not this, you he defieth as the man that
 disinheriteth him, for he is your enemy in two manner of ways,
 for the Table Round that you hold by wrong, and for the New Law
 that you hold.  But he sendeth you word by me, that so you will
 renounce your belief and take Queen Jandree his sister, that he
 will cry you quit as of the Table Round and will be of your aid
 everywhere.  But and if you do not this, have never affiance in
 him.  And so sendeth he word to you by me!"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 Therewith the knight departeth, and the King remaineth all heavy
 in thought, and when they had eaten, he rose from the tables and
 all the knights.  He speaketh to Messire Gawain and Lancelot, and
 taketh counsel with all the others.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "You will defend yourself the best
 you may, and we will help you to smite your enemies.  Great
 Britain is all at your will.  You have not as yet lost any
 castle.  Nought hath been broken down nor burnt but open ground
 and cottages and houses, whereof is no great harm done to
 yourself, and the shame thereof may lightly be amended.  King
 Madeglant is of great hardiment as of words, but in arms will he
 not vanquish you so soon.  If that he warreth upon you toward the
 West, send thither one of the best knights of your court that may
 maintain the war and defend the land against him."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 The King sojourned at Cardoil of a long space.  He believed in
 God and His sweet Mother right well.  He brought thither from the
 castle where the Graal was the pattern whereby chalices should be
 made, and commanded make them throughout all the land so as that
 the Saviour of the world should be served more worshipfully.  He
 commanded also that bells be cast throughout his land after the
 fashion of the one he had brought, and that each church should
 have one according to the means thereof.  This much pleased the
 people of his kingdom, for thereby was the land somewhat amended.
 The tidings came to him one day that Briant and Meliant were
 riding through his land with great routs of folk, and were minded
 to assiege Pannenoisance; and the King issued forth of Cardoil
 with great throng of knights all armed, and rode until he espied
 Briant and his people, and Briant him again.  They ranged their
 battles on both sides, and came together with such might and so
 great a shock as that it seemed the earth shook; and they melled
 together at the assembly with their spears so passing grimly as
 that the frushing thereof might be heard right far away.  Some
 fourteen fell in the assembly that rose up again never more.
 Meliant of the Waste Manor searcheth for Lancelot in the midst of
 the stour until he findeth him, and runneth upon him right
 sturdily and pierceth his shield with his spear.  Lancelot
 smiteth him such a sweep amidst the breast, that he thrusteth his
 spear right through his shoulder, and pinneth him so strongly
 that the shaft is all to-brast, and the end thereof remaineth in
 his body.  And Meliant, all stricken through as he is, runneth
 upon him and passeth his spear right through the shield and
 through the arm, in such sort that he pinneth it to his side.  He
 passeth beyond and breaketh his spear, and afterward returneth to
 Lancelot, sword in fist, and dealeth him a buffet on the helm so
 grimly that he all to-battered it in.  Lancelot waxeth right
 wroth thereof, and he grieveth the more for that he feeleth him
 wounded.  He cometh toward Meliant, sword drawn, and holding him
 well under cover of his shield and cover of his helm, and smiteth
 Meliant so fiercely that he cleaveth his shoulder down to the rib
 in such sort that the end of the spear wherewith he had pierced
 him fell out therefrom.  Meliant felt himself wounded to the
 death, and draweth him back all sorrowful, and other knights run
 upon Lancelot and deliver assault.  Messire Ywain and Sagramors
 li Desirous and Messire Gawain were on the other side in great
 jeopardy, for the people of Briant of the Isles came from all
 parts, and waxed more and more, and on all sides the greater
 number of knights had the upper hand therein.  King Arthur and
 Briant of the Isles were in the midst of the battle, and dealt
 each other right great buffets.  Briant's people come thither and
 take King Arthur by the bridle, and the King defendeth himself as
 a good knight, and maketh a ring about him amongst them that
 attack him, the same as doth a wild boar amongst the dogs.
 Messire Ywain is come thither and Lucan the Butler, and break
 through the press by force.  Thereupon, behold you Sagramors li
 Desirous, that cometh as fast as his horse may gallop under him,
 and smiteth Briant of the Isles right before his people with such
 a rush that he beareth him to the ground in a heap, both him and
 his horse. Briant to-brast his thigh bone in the fall that he
 made. Sagramors holdeth sword drawn and would fain have thrust it
 into his body, when the King crieth to him that he slay him not.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>

 </p><p>
 Briant's people were not able to succour their lord.  Nay,
 rather, they drew back on all sides, for the stout had lasted of
 a long space.  So they tended the dead and the wounded, of whom
 were enough on one side and the other.  King Arthur made carry
 Briant of the Isles to Cardoil, and bring along the other knights
 that his own knights had taken.  Right joyous were the folks at
 Cardoil when the King came back.  They bore Meliant of the Waste
 Manor on his shield to the Hard Rock, but he scarce lived after.
 The King made Briant of the Isles be healed, and held him in
 prison of a long while, until Briant gave him surety of all his
 lands and became his man.  The King made him Seneschal of all his
 lands, and Briant served him right well.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot was whole of his wound, and all the knights of theirs.
 King Arthur was safely stablished, and redoubted and dreaded of
 all lands and of his own land like as he wont to be.  Briant hath
 forgotten all that is past, and is obedient to the King's
 commands and more privy is he of his counsel than ever another of
 the knights, insomuch that he put the others somewhat back,
 whereof had they much misliking.  The felony of Kay the Seneschal
 lay very nigh the King's heart, and he said that and any would
 take vengeance upon him for the same, greatly would he love him
 thereof, for so disloyally hath he wrought against him that he
 durst not let the matter be slurred over; and a sore misfortune
 is it for the world when a man of so poor estate hath slain so
 high a man as his son for no misdeed, and that strangers ought by
 as good right as they that knew him or himself take vengeance
 upon him thereof, so that others might be adread of doing such
 disloyalty.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII.
 </p><p>
 Briant was feared and redoubted throughout all Great Britain.
 King Arthur had told them that they were all to be at his
 commandment.  And one day while the King was at Cardoil, behold
 you a damsel that cometh into the hail and saith unto him: "Sir,
 Queen Jandree hath sent me over to you, and biddeth you do that
 whereof her brother sent you word by his knight.  She is minded
 to be Lady and Queen of your land, and that you take her to wife,
 for of high lineage is she and of great power, wherefore she
 biddeth you by me that you renounce the New Law and that you
 believe in the God in whom she believeth, and, so you do not
 this, you may not have affiance in your land, for King Madeglant
 hath as now made ready his host to enter into the chief of your
 land, and hath sworn his oath that he will not end until he shall
 have passed all the borders of the isles that march upon your
 land, and shall come upon Great Britain with all his strength,
 and so seize the Table Round that ought to be his own of right.
 And my Lady herself would come hither but for one thing, to wit,
 that she hath in her such disdain of them that believe in the New
 Law, that she deigneth not behold none of them, for, so soon as
 she was stablished Queen, made she her eyes be covered for that
 she would not look upon none that were of that believe.  But the
 Gods wherein she believeth did so much for her, for that she
 loveth and worshippeth them, that she may discover her eyes and
 her face, and yet see not at all, whereof is she right glad, for
 that the eyes in her head are beautiful and gentle.  But great
 affiance hath she in her brother, that is mighty and puissant,
 for he hath her in covenant that he will destroy all them that
 believe in the New Law, in all places where he may get at them,
 and, when he shall have destroyed them in Great Britain and the
 other islands, so that my Lady might not see none therein, so
 well is she with the Gods wherein she believeth, that she will
 have her sight again all whole nor until that hour is she fain to
 see nought"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VIII.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the King, "I have heard well that which you tell
 me of this that you have in charge to say; but tell your Lady on
 my behalf, that the Law which the Saviour of the world hath
 established by His death and by His crucifixion never will I
 renounce, for the love that I have in Him.  But tell her that she
 believe in God and in His sweet Mother, and that she believe in
 the New Law, for by the false believe wherein she abideth is she
 blinded in such sort, nor never will she see clear until she
 believe in God.  Tell her moreover, I send her word that never
 more shall there be Queen in my land save she be of like worth as
 was Queen Guenievre."
 </p><p>
 "Then I tell you plainly," saith she, "that you will have betimes
 such tidings as that good for you they will not be."
 </p><p>
 The damsel departeth from Cardoil, and cometh back to where the
 Queen was, and telleth her the message King Arthur sendeth her. 
 "True," saith she, "I love him better than all in the world, and
 yet refuseth he my will and my commandment.  Now may he no longer
 endure!"
 </p><p>
 She sendeth to her brother King Madeglant, and telleth him that
 she herself doth defy him and he take not vengeance on King
 Arthur and bring him not into prison.
