 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XIII</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 Here the story is silent of Lancelot, and saith that Messire
 Gawain goeth a great pace riding, and prayeth God that He will so
 counsel him that he may find the knight.  He rideth until the day
 cometh to decline, and he lay in the house of a hermit in the
 forest, that lodged him well.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit to Messire Gawain, "Whom do you go seek?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "I am in quest of a knight that I would see
 right gladly."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "In this neighbourhood will you find no
 knight."
 </p><p>
 "Wherefore not?" saith Messire Gawain, "Be there no knights in
 this country?"
 </p><p>
 "There was wont to be plenty," saith the hermit, "But now no
 longer are there any, save one all alone in a castle and one all
 alone on the sea that have chased away and slain all the others."
 </p><p>
 "And who is the one of the sea?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "I know not who he is, save only that
 the sea is hard by here, where the ship runneth oftentimes
 wherein the knight is, and he repaireth to an island that is
 under the castle of the Queen of the Maidens, from whence he
 chased an uncle of his that warred upon the castle, and the other
 knights that he had chased thence and slain were helping his
 uncle, so that now the castle is made sure.  And the knights that
 might flee from this forest and this kingdom durst not repair
 thither for the knight, for they dread his hardiment and his
 great might, sith that they know well they might not long endure
 against him."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "Is it so long a space sithence that
 he hath haunted the sea?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "It is scarce more than a twelvemonth."
 </p><p>
 "And how nigh is this to the sea?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "It is not more than two leagues Welsh.
 When I have gone forth to my toil, many a time have I seen the
 ship run close by me, and the knight, all armed, within, and
 meseemed he was of right great comeliness, and had as passing
 proud a look as any lion.  But I can well tell you never was
 knight so dreaded in this kingdom as is he.  The Queen of the
 Maidens would have lost her castle ere now but for him.  Nor
 never sithence that he hath chased his uncle from the island,
 hath he entered the Queen's castle even once, but from that time
 forth hath rather rowed about the sea and searched all the
 islands and stricken down all the proud in such sort that he is
 dreaded and warily avoided throughout all the kingdoms.  The
 Queen of the Maidens is right sorrowful for that he cometh not to
 her castle, for so dear she holdeth him of very love, that and he
 should come and she might keep him so that he should never issue
 forth again, she would sooner lock him up with her there safe
 within."
 </p><p>
 "Know you." saith Messire Gawain, "what shield the knight
 beareth?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "I know not now to blazon it, for nought
 know I of arms.  Three score years and more have I been in this
 hermitage, yet never saw I this kingdom before so dismayed as is
 it now."
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain lay the night therewithin, and departed when he
 had heard mass.  He draweth him as nigh the sea as he may, and
 rideth along beside the shore and many a time draweth rein to
 look forth if he might see the knight's ship.  But nowhere might
 he espy it.  He hath ridden until he cometh to the castle of the
 Queen of the Maidens.  When she knew that it was Messire Gawain,
 she made thereof great joy, and pointed him out the island
 whither Perceval had repaired, and from whence he had driven his
 uncle.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she to Messire Gawain, "I plain me much of him, for
 never hath he been fain to enter herewithin, save the one time
 that he did battle with his uncle, but ever sithence hath he made
 repair to this island and rowed about this sea."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Messire Gawain, "and whereabout may he be now?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, God help me," saith she, "I know not, for I have not seen
 him now of a long space, and no earthly man may know his intent
 nor his desire, nor whitherward he may turn."
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain is right sorrowful for that he knoweth not where
 to seek him albeit he hath so late tidings of him.  He lay at the
 castle and was greatly honoured, and on the morrow he heard mass
 and took leave of the Queen, and rideth all armed beside the
 seashore, for that the hermit had told him, and the Queen
 herself, that he goeth oftener by sea than by land.  He entereth
 into a forest that was nigh the sea, and seeth a knight coming a
 great gallop as if one were chasing him to slay him.
 </p><p>
 "Sir knight," saith Messire Gawain, "Whither away so fast?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, I am fleeing from the knight that hath slain all the
 others."
 </p><p>
 "And who is the knight?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "I know not who he is," saith the knight, "But and you go forward
 you are sure to find him."
 </p><p>
 "Meseemeth," saith Messire Gawain, "that I have seen you
 aforetime."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "So have you!  I am the Knight Coward that you
 met in the forest there where you conquered the knight of the
 shield party black and white, and I am man of the Damsel of the
 Car.  Wherefore I pray you for God's sake that you do me no hurt,
 for the knight that I found down yonder hath a look so fierce
 that I thought I was dead when I saw it."
 </p><p>
 "Need you fear nought of me," saith Messire Gawain, "For I love
 your damsel well."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "I would that all the other knights
 would say as much in respect of me, for no fear have I save for
 myself alone."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain departeth from the knight, and goeth his way
 amidst the forest that overshadowed the land as far as the
 seashore, and looketh forth from the top of a sand-hill, and
 seeth a knight armed on a tall destrier, and he had a shield of
 gold with a green cross.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, God," saith Messire Gawain, "Grant that this knight may be
 able to tell me tidings of him I seek!"
 </p><p>
 Thitherward goeth he a great gallop, and saluteth him
 worshipfully and he him again.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "Can you tell me tidings of a knight
 that beareth a shield banded of argent and azure with a red
 cross?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea, Sir," saith the knight, "That can I well.  At the assembly
 of the knights may you find him within forty days."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "Where will the assembly be?"
 </p><p>
 "In the Red Launde, where will be many a good knight.  There
 shall you find him without fail."
 </p><p>
 Thereof hath Messire Gawain right great joy, and so departeth
 from the knight and the knight from him, and goeth back toward
 the sea a great gallop.  But Messire Gawain saw not the ship
 whereinto he entered, for that it was anchored underneath the
 cliff.  The knight entered thereinto and put out to sea as he had
 wont to do.  Howbeit Messire Gawain goeth his way toward the Red
 Launde where the assembly was to be, and desireth much the day
 that it shall be.  He rideth until he cometh one eventide nigh to
 a castle that was of right fair seeming.  He met a damsel that
 was following after a dead knight that two other knights bare
 upon a horse-bier, and she rode a great pace right amidst the
 forest.  And Messire Gawain cometh to meet her and saluteth her,
 and she returned the salute as fairly as she might.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "Who lieth in this bier?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, a knight that a certain man hath slain by great outrage."
 </p><p>
 "And whither shall you ride this day?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, I would fain be in the Red Launde, and thither will I take
 this knight, that was a right worshipful man for his age."
 </p><p>
 "And wherefore will you take him there?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "For that he that shall do best at the assembly of knights shall
 avenge this knight's death."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 The damsel goeth her way thereupon.  And Messire Gawain goeth to
 the castle that he had seen, and found none within save only one
 solitary knight, old and feeble, and a squire that waited upon
 him.  Howbeit, Messire Gawain alighteth at the castle.  The
 Vavasour lodged him well and willingly, and made his door be well
 shut fast and Messire Gawain be disarmed, and that night he
 showed him honour as well as he might.  And when it came to the
 morrow and Messire Gawain was minded to depart thence, the
 Vavasour saith to him, "Sir you may not depart thus, for this
 door hath not been opened this long while save only yesterday,
 when I made it be opened before you, to the intent that you
 should meet on my behalf a certain knight that is fain to slay
 me, for that the King of Castle Mortal hath had his hold
 herewithin, he that warreth on the Queen of the Maidens.
 Wherefore I pray you that you help me to defend it against the
 knight."
 </p><p>
 "What shield beareth he?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "He beareth a golden shield with a green cross."
 </p><p>
 "And what sort of knight is he?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Vavasour, "A good knight and a hardy and a
 sure."
 </p><p>
 "By my faith," saith Messire Gawain, "And you can tell me tidings
 of another knight whereof I am in quest, I will protect you
 against this one to the best I may, and if he will do nought for
 my prayer, I will safeguard you of my force."
 </p><p>
 "What knight, then, do you seek?" saith the Vavasour.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, a knight that is called Perceval, and he hath carried away
 from the court of King Arthur a shield banded argent and azure
 with a red cross on a band of gold.  He will be at the assembly
 in the Red Launde.  These tidings had I of the knight you dread
 so much."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, whilst Messire Gawain was thus speaking to the
 Vavasour, behold you the Knight of the Golden Shield, that
 draweth rein in the midst of a launde that was betwixt the castle
 and the forest.  The Vavasour seeth him from the windows of the
 hall, and pointeth him out to Messire Gawain.  Messire Gawain
 goeth and mounteth on his destrier, his shield at his neck and
 his spear in his fist, all armed, and issueth forth of the door
 when it had been unfastened, and cometh toward the knight, that
 awaited him on his horse.  He seeth Messire Gawain coming, but
 moveth not, and Messire Gawain marvelleth much that the knight
 cometh not toward him, for him thinketh well that the Vavasour
 had told him true.  But he had not, for never had the knight come
 thither to do the Vavasour any hurt, but on account of the
 knights that passed by that way that went to seek adventure, for
 right glad was he to see them albeit he was not minded to make
 himself known unto any.  Messire Gawain looketh before him and
 behind him and seeth that the door was made fast and the bridge
 drawn up so soon as he was departed thence, whereof he marvelled
 much and saith to the knight, "Sir, is your intent nought but
 good only?"
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith he, "Nought at all, and readily will I tell
 it you."
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, behold you a damsel that cometh a great pace, and held
 a whip wherewith she hurrieth her mule onward, and she draweth
 rein there where the two knights were.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, God!" saith she, "shall I ever find one to wreak me
 vengeance of the traitor Vavasour that dwelleth in this castle?"
 </p><p>
 "Is he then traitor?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "Yea, Sir, the most traitor you saw ever!  He lodged my brother
 the day before yesterday, and bore him on hand at night that a
 certain knight was warring upon him for that the way whereby the
 knights pass is here in front of this place, and lied to him so
 much as that my brother held him in covenant that he would
 assault a certain knight that he should point out to him, for
 love of him.  This knight came passing hereby, that had no
 thought to do hurt neither to the Vavasour nor to my brother. 
 The knight was right strong and hardy, and was born at the castle
 of Escavalon.  My brother issued forth of the castle filled with
 fool-hardiness for the leasing of the Vavasour, and ran upon the
 knight without a word.  The knight could do no less than avenge
 himself.  They hurtled together so sore that their horses fell
 under them and their spears passed either through other's heart.
 Thus were both twain killed on this very piece of ground."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 "The Vavasour took the arms and the horses and put them in safe
 keeping in his castle, and the bodies of the knights he left to
 the wild beasts, that would have devoured them had I not chanced
 to come thither with two knights that helped me bury them by
 yonder cross at the entrance of the forest."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Messire Gawain, "In like manner would he have
 wrought me mischief had I been minded to trust him; for he bore
 me in hand that this knight was warring upon him, and besought me
 that I should safeguard him against him.  But our Lord God so
 helped me that I intermeddled not therein, for lightly might I
 have wrought folly."
 </p><p>
 "By the name of God," saith the other, "Meseemeth it clear that
 the Vavasour would fain that knights should kill each other."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel, "You say true; it is of his covetise of
 harness and horses that he entreateth the knights on this-wise."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "Whither go you?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "After a knight that I have made be carried in
 a litter for the dead."
 </p><p>
 "I saw him," saith he, "pass by here last night, full late last
 night."
 </p><p>
 The knight taketh leave of Messire Gawain, and Messire Gawain
 saith that he holdeth himself a churl in that he hath not asked
 him of his name.  But the knight said, "Fair Sir, I pray you of
 love that you ask not my name until such time as I shall ask you
 of yours."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain would ask nought further of the knight, and the
 knight entered into the Lonely Forest and Messire Gawain goeth on
 his way.  He meeteth neither knight nor damsel to whom he telleth
 not whom he goeth to seek, and they all say that he will be in
 the Red Launde.  He lodged the night with a hermit.  At night,
 the hermit asked Messire Gawain whence he came?
 </p><p>
 "Sir, from the land of the Queen of the Maidens."
 </p><p>
 "Have you seen Perceval, the Good Knight that took the shield in
 King Arthur's court and left another there?"
 </p><p>
 "No, certes," saith Messire Gawain, "Whereof am I right
 sorrowful.  But a knight with a shield of gold and a green cross
 thereon told me that he would be at the Red Launde."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "you say true, for it was he himself to
 whom you spake.  Tonight is the third night since he lay within
 yonder, and see here the bracket he brought from King Arthur's
 court, which he hath commanded me to convey to his uncle, King
 Hermit."
 </p><p>
 "Alas!" saith Messire Gawain, "What ill chance is mine if this
 be true!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "I ought not to lie, neither to you nor
 other.  By the brachet may you well know that this is true."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "Of custom beareth he no such
 shield."
 </p><p>
 "I know well," saith the hermit, "what shield he ought to bear,
 and what shield he will bear hereafter.  But this doth he that he
 may not be known, and this shield took he in the hermitage of
 Joseus, the son of King Hermit, there where Lancelot was lodged,
 where he hanged the four thieves that would have broken into the
 hermitage by night.  And within there hath remained the shield he
 brought from King Arthur's court, with Joseus the son of my
 sister, and they are as brother and sister between the twain, and
 you may know of very truth that albeit Joseus be hermit, no
 knight is there in Great Britain of his heart and hardiment."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII.
 </p><p>
 "Certes," saith Messire Gawain, "It was sore mischance for me
 that I should see him yesterday before the castle where the
 knights pass by, and speak to him and ask him his name, but he
 besought me that I should not ask him his name until such time as
 he should ask me mine; and with that he departed from me and
 entered into the forest, and I came hitherward.  Now am I so
 sorrowful that I know not what I may do for the best, for King
 Arthur sendeth me in quest of him, and Lancelot hath also gone to
 seek him in another part of the kingdom of Logres.  But now hath
 too great mischance befallen me of this quest, for twice have I
 seen him and found him and spoken to him, and now have I lost him
 again."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "He is so close and wary a knight, that
 he is fain never to waste a word, neither will he make false
 semblant to any nor speak word that he would not should be heard,
 nor do shame of his body to his knowledge, nor carnal sin, for
 virgin and chaste is he and doth never outrage to any."
 </p><p>
 "I know well," saith Messire Gawain, "that all the valours and
 all the cleannesses that ought to be in a knight are in him, and
 therefore am I the more sorrowful that I am not of them that he
 knoweth, for a man is worth the more that hath acquaintance with
 a good knight."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VIII.
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain lay the night in the hermit's house, right
 sorrowful, and in the morning departed when he had heard mass.
 Josephus the good clerk witnesseth us in this high history that
 this hermit had to name Josuias, and was a knight of great
 worship and valour, but he renounced all for the love of God, and
 was fain to set his body in banishment for Him.  And all these
 adventures that you hear in this high record came to pass,
 Josephus telleth us, for the setting forward the law of the
 Saviour.  All of them could he not record, but only these whereof
 he best remembered him, and whereof he knew for certain all the
 adventures by virtue of the Holy Spirit.  This high record saith
 that Messire Gawain hath wandered so far that he is come into the
 Red Launde whereas the assembly of knights should be held.  He
 looketh and seeth the tents pitched and the knights coming from
 all quarters.  The most part were already armed within and before
 their tents.  Messire Gawain looketh everywhere, thinking to see
 the knight he seeketh, but seemeth him he seeth him not, for no
 such shield seeth he as he beareth.  All abashed is he thereof,
 for he hath seen all the tents and looked at all the arms.  But
 the knight is not easy to recognise, for he hath changed his
 arms, and nigh enough is he to Messire Gawain, albeit you may
 well understand that he knoweth it not.  And the tournament
 assembleth from all parts, and the divers fellowships come the
 one against other, and the melly of either upon other as they
 come together waxeth sore and marvellous.  And Messire Gawain
 searcheth the ranks to find the knight, albeit when he meeteth
 knight in his way he cannot choose but do whatsoever a knight may
 do of arms, and yet more would he have done but for his fainness
 to seek out the knight.  The damsel is at the head of the
 tournament, for that she would fain know the one that shall have
 the mastery and the prize therein.
 </p><p>
 The knight that Messire Gawain seeketh is not at the head of the
 fellowships, but in the thickest of the press, and such feats of
 arms doth he that more may no knight do, and smiteth down the
 knights about him, that flee from him even as the deer-hound
 fleeth from the lion.
 </p><p>
 "By my faith," saith Messire Gawain, "sith that they have lied to
 me about the knight, I will seek him no more this day, but forget
 my discontent as best I may until evening."
 </p><p>
 He seeth the knight, but knoweth him not, for he had a white
 shield and cognisances of the same.  And Messire Gawain cometh to
 him as fast as his horse may carry him, and the knight toward
 Messire Gawain.  So passing stoutly they come together that they
 pierce their shields below the boss.  Their spears were so tough
 that they break not, and they draw them forth and come together
 again so strongly that the spears wherewith they smote each other
 amidst the breast were bended so that they unriveted the
 holdfasts of their shields, and they lost their stirrups, and the
 reins fly from their fists, and they stagger against the back
 saddlebows, and the horses stumbled so as that they all but fell.
 They straighten them in saddle and stirrup, and catch hold upon
 their reins, and then come together again, burning with wrath and
 fury like lions, and either smiteth on other with their spears
 that may endure no longer, for the shafts are all to-frushed as
 far as the fists in such sort that they that look on marvel them
 much how it came to pass that the points had not pierced their
 bodies.  But God would not that the good knights should slay each
 other, rather would He that the one should know the true worth of
 the other.  The habergeons safeguarded not their bodies, but the
 might of God in whom they believed, for in them had they all the
 valour that knight should have; and never did Messire Gawain
 depart from hostel wherein he had lien, but he first heard mass
 before he went if so he might, nor never found he dame nor damsel
 discounselled whereof he had not pity, nor did he ever
 churlishness to other knight, nor said nor thought it, and he
 came, as you have heard, of the most holy lineage of Josephus and
 the good King Fisherman.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IX.
 </p><p>
 The good knights were in the midst of the assembly, and right
 wrathful was the one against the other, and they held their
 swords naked and their shields on their arms and dealt each other
 huge buffets right in the midst of the helms.  The most part of
 the knights come to them and tell them that the assembly waiteth
 for them to come thereunto.  They have much pains to part them
 asunder, and then the melly beginneth again on all sides, and the
 evening cometh on that parteth them at last.  And on this wise
 the assembly lasted for two days.  The damsel that brought the
 knight on a bier in a coffin, dead, prayed the assembly of all
 the knights to declare which one of all the knights had done the
 best, for the knight that she made be carried might not be buried
 until such time as he were avenged.  And they say that the knight
 of the white shield and the other with the shield sinople and the
 golden eagle had done better than all the other, but, for that
 the knight of the white shield had joined in the melly before the
 other, they therefore would give him the prize; but they judged
 that for the time that Messire Gawain had joined therein he had
 not done worse than the other knight.  The damsel seeketh the
 knight of the white shield among the knights and throughout all
 the tents, but cannot find him, for already hath he departed. 
 She cometh to Messire Gawain and saith: "Sir, sith that I find
 not the knight of the white shield, you are he that behoveth
 avenge the knight that lieth dead in the litter."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "Do me not this shame, for it
 hath been declared that the other knight hath better done herein
 than I."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 X.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel, well you know that no honour should I have thereof, were
 I to emprise to do that whereof you beseech me, ~for you have
 said that behoveth none to avenge him, save only that hath borne
 him best at this assembly, and that is he of the white shield,
 and, so God help me, this have I well felt and proven."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XI.
 </p><p>
 The damsel well understandeth that Messire Gawain speaketh
 reason.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, Sir," saith she, "He hath already departed hence and gone
 into the forest, and the most divers-seeming knight is he and the
 best that liveth, and great pains shall I have or ever I find him
 again."
 </p><p>
 "The best?" saith Messire Gawain; "How know you that?"
 </p><p>
 "I know it well," saith she, "for that in the house of King
 Fisherman did the Graal appear unto him for the goodness of his
 knighthood and the goodness of his heart and for the chastity of
 his body.  But he forgat to ask that one should serve thereof,
 whence hath sore harm befallen the land.  He came to the court of
 King Arthur, where he took a shield that none ought to bear save
 he alone.  Up to this time have I well known his coming and
 going, but nought shall I know thereof hereafter for that he hath
 changed the cognisance of his shield and arms.  And now am I
 entered into sore pain and travail to seek him, for I shall not
 have found him of a long space, and I came not to this assembly
 save for him alone."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "You have told me tidings such as
 no gladness have I thereof, for I also am seeking him, but I know
 not how I may ever recognise him, for he willeth not to tell me
 his name, and too often changeth he his shield, and well I know
 that so I shall ever come in place where he hath changed his
 cognisance, and he shall come against me and I against him, I
 shall only know him by the buffets that he knoweth how to deal,
 for never in arms have I made acquaintance with so cruel a
 knight.  But again would I suffer sorer blows than I have
 suffered yet, so only I might be where he is."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel, "What is your name?"
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith he, "I am called Gawain."
 </p><p>
 With that he commendeth the damsel to God, and goeth his way in
 one direction and the damsel in another, and saith to herself
 that Perceval is the most marvellous knight of the world, that so
 often he discogniseth himself.  For when one seeth him one may
 recognise him not.  Messire Gawain rideth amidst the forest, and
 prayeth the Saviour lead him into such place as that he may find
 Perceval openly, in such sort that he may have his acquaintance
 and his love that so greatly he desireth.
