 CHAPTER XLIII
 
 How Morgan le Fay buried her paramour, and how Sir
 Tristram praised Sir Launcelot and his kin.
 
 NOW leave to speak of Sir Tristram, and speak we of the knight
 that was wounded to the death.  Then his varlet alighted, and
 took off his helm, and then he asked his lord whether there were
 any life in him.  There is in me life said the knight, but it is
 but little; and therefore leap thou up behind me when thou hast
 holpen me up, and hold me fast that I fall not, and bring me to
 Queen Morgan le Fay; for deep draughts of death draw to my heart
 that I may not live, for I would fain speak with her or I died:
 for else my soul will be in great peril an I die.  For[thwith]
 with great pain his varlet brought him to the castle, and there
 Sir Hemison fell down dead.  When Morgan le Fay saw him dead she
 made great sorrow out of reason; and then she let despoil him
 unto his shirt, and so she let him put into a tomb.  And about
 the tomb she let write:  Here lieth Sir Hemison, slain by the
 hands of Sir Tristram de Liones.
 
 Now turn we unto Sir Tristram, that asked the knight his host if
 he saw late any knights adventurous.  Sir, he said, the last
 night here lodged with me Ector de Maris and a damosel with him,
 and that damosel told me that he was one of the best knights of
 the world.  That is not so, said Sir Tristram, for I know four
 better knights of his own blood, and the first is Sir Launcelot
 du Lake, call him the best knight, and Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir
 Bleoberis, Sir Blamore de Ganis, and Sir Gaheris.  Nay, said his
 host, &lt;431&gt;Sir Gawaine is a better knight than he.  That is not
 so, said Sir Tristram, for I have met with them both, and I felt
 Sir Gaheris for the better knight, and Sir Lamorak I call him as
 good as any of them except Sir Launcelot.  Why name ye not Sir
 Tristram? said his host, for I account him as good as any of
 them.  I know not Sir Tristram, said Tristram.  Thus they talked
 and bourded as long as them list, and then went to rest.  And on
 the morn Sir Tristram departed, and took his leave of his host,
 and rode toward the Roche Dure, and none adventure had Sir
 Tristram but that; and so he rested not till he came to the
 castle, where he saw five hundred tents.
