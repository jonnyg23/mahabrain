 CHAPTER VII
 
 How Sir Mordred rode hastily to the king, to tell him of
 the affray and death of Sir Agravaine and the other
 knights
 
 
 NOW turn we again unto Sir Mordred, that when he was
 escaped from the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, he anon gat
 his horse and mounted upon him, and rode unto King
 Arthur, sore wounded and smitten, and all forbled; and
 there he told the king all how it was, and how they were
 all slain save himself all only.  Jesu mercy, how may this
 be? said the king; took ye him in the queen's chamber?
 Yea, so God me help, said Sir Mordred, there we found
 him unarmed, and there he slew Colgrevance, and armed
 him in his armour; and all this he told the king from
 the beginning to the ending.  Jesu mercy, said the king,
 he is a marvellous knight of prowess.  Alas, me sore
 repenteth, said the king, that ever Sir Launcelot should
 be against me.  Now I am sure the noble fellowship of
 the Round Table is broken for ever, for with him will
 many a noble knight hold; and now it is fallen so, said
 the king, that I may not with my worship, but the queen
 must suffer the death.  So then there was made great
 ordinance in this heat, that the queen must be judged to
 the death.  And the law was such in those days that
 whatsomever they were, of what estate or degree, if they
 were found guilty of treason, there should be none other
 remedy but death; and outher the men or the taking with
 the deed should be causer of their hasty judgment.  And
 right so was it ordained for Queen Guenever, because
 Sir Mordred was escaped sore wounded, and the death of
 thirteen knights of the Round Table.  These proofs and
 experiences caused King Arthur to command the queen to
 the fire there to be brent.
 
 Then spake Sir Gawaine, and said:  My lord Arthur,
 I would counsel you not to be over-hasty, but that ye
 would put it in respite, this judgment of my lady the
 queen, for many causes.  One it is, though it were so
 that Sir Launcelot were found in the queen's chamber, yet
 it might be so that he came thither for none evil; for ye
 know my lord, said Sir Gawaine, that the queen is much
 beholden unto Sir Launcelot, more than unto any other
 knight, for ofttimes he hath saved her life, and done battle
 for her when all the court refused the queen; and
 peradventure she sent for him for goodness and for none
 evil, to reward him for his good deeds that he had done
 to her in times past.  And peradventure my lady, the
 queen, sent for him to that intent that Sir Launcelot
 should come to her good grace privily and secretly,
 weening to her that it was best so to do, in eschewing
 and dreading of slander; for ofttimes we do many things
 that we ween it be for the best, and yet peradventure it
 turneth to the worst.  For I dare say, said Sir Gawaine,
 my lady, your queen, is to you both good and true; and
 as for Sir Launcelot, said Sir Gawaine, I dare say he will
 make it good upon any knight living that will put upon
 himself villainy or shame, and in like wise he will make
 good for my lady, Dame Guenever.
 
 That I believe well, said King Arthur, but I will not
 that way with Sir Launcelot, for he trusteth so much upon
 his hands and his might that he doubteth no man; and
 therefore for my queen he shall never fight more, for she
 shall have the law.  And if I may get Sir Launcelot, wit
 you well he shall have a shameful death.  Jesu defend,
 said Sir Gawaine, that I may never see it.  Why say ye
 so? said King Arthur; forsooth ye have no cause to love
 Sir Launcelot, for this night last past he slew your brother,
 Sir Agravaine, a full good knight, and almost he had slain
 your other brother, Sir Mordred, and also there he slew
 thirteen noble knights; and also, Sir Gawaine, remember
 you he slew two sons of yours, Sir Florence and Sir Lovel.
 My lord, said Sir Gawaine, of all this I have knowledge,
 of whose deaths I repent me sore; but insomuch I gave
 them warning, and told my brethren and my sons aforehand
 what would fall in the end, insomuch they would
 not do by my counsel, I will not meddle me thereof, nor
 revenge me nothing of their deaths; for I told them it
 was no boot to strive with Sir Launcelot.  Howbeit I am
 sorry of the death of my brethren and of my sons, for
 they are the causers of their own death; for ofttimes I
 warned my brother Sir Agravaine, and I told him the
 perils the which be now fallen.
