 CHAPTER LXXXIII
 
 How Sir Palomides brought Sir Epinogris his lady; and
 how Sir Palomides and Sir Safere were assailed.
 
 
 NAY, nay, said Epinogris, your sorrow is but japes to my
 sorrow; for I rejoiced my lady and won her with my
 hands, and lost her again: alas that day! Thus first I
 won her, said Epinogris; my lady was an earl's daughter,
 and as the earl and two knights came from the tournament
 of Lonazep, for her sake I set upon this earl and
 on his two knights, my lady there being present; and so
 by fortune there I slew the earl and one of the knights,
 and the other knight fled, and so that night I had my
 lady.  And on the morn as she and I reposed us at this
 well-side there came there to me an errant knight, his name
 was Sir Helior le Preuse, an hardy knight, and this Sir
 Helior challenged me to fight for my lady.  And then
 we went to battle first upon horse and after on foot, but
 at the last Sir Helior wounded me so that he left me for
 dead, and so he took my lady with him; and thus my
 sorrow is more than yours, for I have rejoiced and ye
 rejoiced never.  That is truth, said Palomides, but sith
 I can never recover myself I shall promise you if I can
 meet with Sir Helior I shall get you your lady again, or
 else he shall beat me.
 
 Then Sir Palomides made Sir Epinogris to take his
 horse, and so they rode to an hermitage, and there Sir
 Epinogris rested him.  And in the meanwhile Sir Palomides
 walked privily out to rest him under the leaves, and
 there beside he saw a knight come riding with a shield
 that he had seen Sir Ector de Maris bear beforehand; and
 there came after him a ten knights, and so these ten
 knights hoved under the leaves for heat.  And anon after
 there came a knight with a green shield and therein a
 white lion, leading a lady upon a palfrey.  Then this
 knight with the green shield that seemed to be master of
 the ten knights, he rode fiercely after Sir Helior, for it was
 he that hurt Sir Epinogris.  And when he came nigh Sir
 Helior he bade him defend his lady.  I will defend her,
 said Helior, unto my power.  And so they ran together
 so mightily that either of these knights smote other down,
 horse and all, to the earth; and then they won up lightly
 and drew their swords and their shields, and lashed
 together mightily more than an hour.  All this Sir Palomides
 saw and beheld, but ever at the last the knight with
 Sir Ector's shield was bigger, and at the last this knight
 smote Sir Helior down, and then that knight unlaced his
 helm to have stricken off his head.  And then he cried
 mercy, and prayed him to save his life, and bade him take
 his lady.  Then Sir Palomides dressed him up, because he
 wist well that that same lady was Epinogris' lady, and he
 promised him to help him.
 
 Then Sir Palomides went straight to that lady, and
 took her by the hand, and asked her whether she knew a
 knight that hight Epinogris.  Alas, she said, that ever he
 knew me or I him, for I have for his sake lost my
 worship, and also his life grieveth me most of all.  Not
 so, lady, said Palomides, come on with me, for here is
 Epinogris in this hermitage.  Ah! well is me, said the
 lady, an he be alive.  Whither wilt thou with that lady?
 said the knight with Sir Ector's shield.  I will do with
 her what me list, said Palomides.  Wit you well, said that
 knight, thou speakest over large, though thou seemest me
 to have at advantage, because thou sawest me do battle
 but late.  Thou weenest, sir knight, to have that lady
 away from me so lightly? nay, think it never not; an
 thou were as good a knight as is Sir Launcelot, or as is
 Sir Tristram, or Sir Palomides, but thou shalt win her
 dearer than ever did I.  And so they went unto battle
 upon foot, and there they gave many sad strokes, and
 either wounded other passing sore, and thus they fought
 still more than an hour.
 
 Then Sir Palomides had marvel what knight he might
 be that was so strong and so well breathed during, and
 thus said Palomides:  Knight, I require thee tell me thy
 name.  Wit thou well, said that knight, I dare tell thee
 my name, so that thou wilt tell me thy name.  I will, said
 Palomides.  Truly, said that knight, my name is Safere,
 son of King Astlabor, and Sir Palomides and Sir Segwarides
 are my brethren.  Now, and wit thou well, my name is
 Sir Palomides.  Then Sir Safere kneeled down upon his
 knees, and prayed him of mercy; and then they unlaced
 their helms and either kissed other weeping.  And in the
 meanwhile Sir Epinogris arose out of his bed, and heard
 them by the strokes, and so he armed him to help Sir
 Palomides if need were.
