 CHAPTER LXX
 
 How Sir Tristram changed his harness and it was all red,
 and how he demeaned him, and how Sir Palomides
 slew Launcelot's horse.
 
 
 AND when the queen La Beale Isoud saw that Sir
 Tristram was unhorsed, and she wist not where he was,
 then she wept greatly.  But Sir Tristram, when he was
 ready, came dashing lightly into the field, and then La
 Beale Isoud espied him.  And so he did great deeds of
 arms; with one spear, that was great, Sir Tristram smote
 down five knights or ever he stint.  Then Sir Launcelot
 espied him readily, that it was Sir Tristram, and then he
 repented him that he had smitten him down; and so
 Sir Launcelot went out of the press to repose him and
 lightly he came again.  And now when Sir Tristram
 came into the press, through his great force he put Sir
 Palomides upon his horse, and Sir Gareth, and Sir
 Dinadan, and then they began to do marvellously; but
 Sir Palomides nor none of his two fellows knew not who
 had holpen them on horseback again.  But ever Sir
 Tristram was nigh them and succoured them, and they
 [knew] not him, because he was changed into red armour:
 and all this while Sir Launcelot was away.
 
 So when La Beale Isoud knew Sir Tristram again
 upon his horse-back she was passing glad, and then she
 laughed and made good cheer.  And as it happened, Sir
 Palomides looked up toward her where she lay in the
 window, and he espied how she laughed; and therewith
 he took such a rejoicing that he smote down, what with
 his spear and with his sword, all that ever he met;
 for through the sight of her he was so enamoured in
 her love that he seemed at that time, that an both Sir
 Tristram and Sir Launcelot had been both against him
 they should have won no worship of him; and in his
 heart, as the book saith, Sir Palomides wished that with
 his worship he might have ado with Sir Tristram before
 all men, because of La Beale Isoud.  Then Sir Palomides
 began to double his strength, and he did so marvellously
 that all men had wonder of him, and ever he cast up
 his eye unto La Beale Isoud.  And when he saw her
 make such cheer he fared like a lion, that there might
 no man withstand him; and then Sir Tristram beheld
 him, how that Sir Palomides bestirred him; and then he
 said unto Sir Dinadan:  So God me help, Sir Palomides
 is a passing good knight and a well enduring, but such
 deeds saw I him never do, nor never heard I tell that
 ever he did so much in one day.  It is his day, said
 Dinadan; and he would say no more unto Sir Tristram;
 but to himself he said:  An if ye knew for whose love
 he doth all those deeds of arms, soon would Sir Tristram
 abate his courage.  Alas, said Sir Tristram, that Sir
 Palomides is not christened.  So said King Arthur, and
 so said all those that beheld him.  Then all people gave
 him the prize, as for the best knight that day, that he
 passed Sir Launcelot outher Sir Tristram.  Well, said
 Dinadan to himself, all this worship that Sir Palomides
 hath here this day he may thank the Queen Isoud, for
 had she been away this day Sir Palomides had not gotten
 the prize this day.
 
 Right so came into the field Sir Launcelot du Lake,
 and saw and heard the noise and cry and the great
 worship that Sir Palomides had.  He dressed him against
 Sir Palomides, with a great mighty spear and a long, and
 thought to smite him down.  And when Sir Palomides
 saw Sir Launcelot come upon him so fast, he ran upon
 Sir Launcelot as fast with his sword as he might; and
 as Sir Launcelot should have stricken him he smote his
 spear aside, and smote it a-two with his sword.  And
 Sir Palomides rushed unto Sir Launcelot, and thought
 to have put him to a shame; and with his sword he
 smote his horse's neck that Sir Launcelot rode upon, and
 then Sir Launcelot fell to the earth.  Then was the cry
 huge and great:  See how Sir Palomides the Saracen hath
 smitten down Sir Launcelot's horse.  Right then were
 there many knights wroth with Sir Palomides because he
 had done that deed; therefore many knights held there
 against that it was unknightly done in a tournament to
 kill an horse wilfully, but that it had been done in plain
 battle, life for life.
