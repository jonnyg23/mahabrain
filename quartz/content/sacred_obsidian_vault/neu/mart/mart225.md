 CHAPTER XXXII
 
 How Sir Tristram found Palomides by a well, and brought
 him with him to his lodging.
 
 THEN the King with the Hundred Knights withdrew his knights.  And
 all this while, and long to-fore, Sir Launcelot had watched upon
 Sir Tristram with a very purpose to have fellowshipped with him. 
 And then suddenly Sir Tristram, Sir Dinadan, and Gouvernail, his
 man, rode their way into the forest, that no man perceived where
 they went.  So then King Arthur blew unto lodging, and gave the
 King of Northgalis the prize because Sir Tristram was upon his
 side.  Then Sir Launcelot rode here and there, so wood as lion
 that fauted his fill, because he had lost Sir Tristram, and so he
 returned unto King Arthur.  And then in all the field was a noise
 that with the wind it might be heard two mile thence, how the
 lords and ladies cried:  The Knight with the Black Shield hath
 won the field.  Alas, said King Arthur, where is that knight
 become?  It is shame to all those in the field so to let him
 escape away from you; but with gentleness and courtesy ye might
 have brought him unto me to the Castle of Maidens.  Then the
 noble King Arthur went unto his knights and comforted them in the
 best wise that he could, and said:  My fair fellows, be not
 dismayed, howbeit ye have lost the field this day.  And many were
 hurt and sore wounded, and many were whole.  My fellows, said
 King Arthur, look that ye be of good cheer, for to-morn I will be
 in the field with you and revenge you of your enemies.  So that
 night King Arthur and his knights reposed themself.
 
 The damosel that came from La Beale Isoud unto Sir Tristram, all
 the while the tournament was a-doing she was with Queen Guenever,
 and ever the queen asked her for what cause she came into that
 country.  Madam, she answered, I come for none other cause but
 from my lady &lt;408&gt;La Beale Isoud to wit of your welfare.  For in
 no wise she would not tell the queen that she came for Sir
 Tristram's sake.  So this lady, Dame Bragwaine, took her leave of
 Queen Guenever, and she rode after Sir Tristram.  And as she rode
 through the forest she heard a great cry; then she commanded her
 squire to go into the forest to wit what was that noise.  And so
 he came to a well, and there he found a knight bounden till a
 tree crying as he had been wood, and his horse and his harness
 standing by him.  And when he espied that squire, therewith he
 abraid and brake himself loose, and took his sword in his hand,
 and ran to have slain the squire.  Then he took his horse and
 fled all that ever he might unto Dame Bragwaine, and told her of
 his adventure.  Then she rode unto Sir Tristram's pavilion, and
 told Sir Tristram what adventure she had found in the forest. 
 Alas, said Sir Tristram, upon my head there is some good knight
 at mischief.
 
 Then Sir Tristram took his horse and his sword and rode thither,
 and there he heard how the knight complained unto himself and
 said:  I, woful knight Sir Palomides, what misadventure befalleth
 me, that thus am defoiled with falsehood and treason, through Sir
 Bors and Sir Ector.  Alas, he said, why live I so long!  And then
 he gat his sword in his hands, and made many strange signs and
 tokens; and so through his raging he threw his sword into that
 fountain.  Then Sir Palomides wailed and wrang his hands.  And at
 the last for pure sorrow he ran into that fountain, over his
 belly, and sought after his sword.  Then Sir Tristram saw that,
 and ran upon Sir Palomides, and held him in his arms fast.  What
 art thou, said Palomides, that holdeth me so?  I am a man of this
 forest that would thee none harm.  Alas, said Sir Palomides, I
 may never win worship where Sir Tristram is; for ever where he is
 an I be there, then get I no worship; and if he be away for the
 most part I have the gree, unless that Sir Launcelot be there or
 Sir Lamorak.  Then Sir Palomides said:  Once in Ireland Sir
 Tristram put me to the worse, and another time in Cornwall, and
 in other places in this land.  What would ye do, said Sir
 &lt;409&gt;Tristram, an ye had Sir Tristram?  I would fight with him,
 said Sir Palomides, and ease my heart upon him; and yet, to say
 thee sooth, Sir Tristram is the gentlest knight in this world
 living.  What will ye do, said Sir Tristram, will ye go with me
 to your lodging?  Nay, said he, I will go to the King with the
 Hundred Knights, for he rescued me from Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir
 Ector and else had I been slain traitorly.  Sir Tristram said him
 such kind words that Sir Palomides went with him to his lodging. 
 Then Gouvernail went to-fore, and charged Dame Bragwaine to go
 out of the way to her lodging And bid ye Sir Persides that he
 make him no quarrels.  And so they rode together till they came
 to Sir Tristram's pavilion, and there Sir Palomides had all the
 cheer that might be had all that night.  But in no wise Sir
 Palomides might not know what was Sir Tristram; and so after
 supper they yede to rest, and Sir Tristram for great travail
 slept till it was day.  And Sir Palomides might not sleep for
 anguish; and in the dawning of the day he took his horse privily,
 and rode his way unto Sir Gaheris and unto Sir Sagramore le
 Desirous, where they were in their pavilions; for they three were
 fellows at the beginning of the tournament.  And then upon the
 morn the king blew unto the tournament upon the third day.
