 CHAPTER LXXXI
 
 How Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector reported to Queen Guenever
 of the beauty of La Beale Isoud.
 
 
 SO at the seven nights' end Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector
 departed from Sir Tristram and from the queen; and
 these two good knights had great gifts; and Sir Gareth
 and Sir Dinadan abode with Sir Tristram.  And when
 Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector were come there as the Queen
 Guenever was lodged, in a castle by the seaside, and
 through the grace of God the queen was recovered of
 her malady, then she asked the two knights from whence
 they came.  They said that they came from Sir Tristram
 and from La Beale Isoud.  How doth Sir Tristram, said
 the queen, and La Beale Isoud?  Truly, said those two
 knights, he doth as a noble knight should do; and as
 for the Queen Isoud, she is peerless of all ladies; for to
 speak of her beauty, bount<e>, and mirth, and of her
 goodness, we saw never her match as far as we have ridden
 and gone.  O mercy Jesu, said Queen Guenever, so
 saith all the people that have seen her and spoken with
 her.  God would that I had part of her conditions; and it
 is misfortuned me of my sickness while that tournament
 endured.  And as I suppose I shall never see in all my
 life such an assembly of knights and ladies as ye have
 done.
 
 Then the knights told her how Palomides won the
 degree at the first day with great noblesse; and the
 second day Sir Tristram won the degree; and the third
 day Sir Launcelot won the degree.  Well, said Queen
 Guenever, who did best all these three days?  So God
 me help, said these knights, Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristram
 had least dishonour.  And wit ye well Sir Palomides
 did passing well and mightily; but he turned against
 the party that he came in withal, and that caused him to
 lose a great part of his worship, for it seemed that Sir
 Palomides is passing envious.  Then shall he never win
 worship, said Queen Guenever, for an it happeth an
 envious man once to win worship he shall be dishonoured
 twice therefore; and for this cause all men of worship
 hate an envious man, and will shew him no favour, and
 he that is courteous, and kind, and gentle, hath favour
 in every place.
