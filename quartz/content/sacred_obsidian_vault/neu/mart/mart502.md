 CHAPTER XIII
 
 How Sir Ector found Sir Launcelot his brother dead, and
 how Constantine reigned next after Arthur; and of the
 end of this book
 
 
 AND when Sir Ector heard such noise and light in the
 quire of Joyous Gard, he alighted and put his horse from
 him, and came into the quire, and there he saw men sing
 and weep.  And all they knew Sir Ector, but he knew
 not them.  Then went Sir Bors unto Sir Ector, and told
 him how there lay his brother, Sir Launcelot, dead; and
 then Sir Ector threw his shield, sword, and helm from
 him.  And when he beheld Sir Launcelot's visage, he fell
 down in a swoon.  And when he waked it were hard any
 tongue to tell the doleful complaints that he made for his
 brother.  Ah Launcelot, he said, thou were head of all
 Christian knights, and now I dare say, said Sir Ector,
 thou Sir Launcelot, there thou liest, that thou were never
 matched of earthly knight's hand.  And thou were the
 courteoust knight that ever bare shield.  And thou were
 the truest friend to thy lover that ever bestrad horse.
 And thou were the truest lover of a sinful man that ever
 loved woman.  And thou were the kindest man that ever
 struck with sword.  And thou were the goodliest person
 that ever came among press of knights.  And thou was
 the meekest man and the gentlest that ever ate in hall
 among ladies.  And thou were the sternest knight to thy
 mortal foe that ever put spear in the rest.  Then there
 was weeping and dolour out of measure.
 
 Thus they kept Sir Launcelot's corpse aloft fifteen
 days, and then they buried it with great devotion.  And
 then at leisure they went all with the Bishop of Canterbury
 to his hermitage, and there they were together more than
 a month.  Then Sir Constantine, that was Sir Cador's
 son of Cornwall, was chosen king of England.  And he
 was a full noble knight, and worshipfully he ruled this
 realm.  And then this King Constantine sent for the
 Bishop of Canterbury, for he heard say where he was.
 And so he was restored unto his Bishopric, and left that
 hermitage.  And Sir Bedivere was there ever still hermit
 to his life's end.  Then Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Ector de
 Maris, Sir Gahalantine, Sir Galihud, Sir Galihodin, Sir
 Blamore, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Villiars le Valiant, Sir Clarrus
 of Clermont, all these knights drew them to their
 countries.  Howbeit King Constantine would have had
 them with him, but they would not abide in this realm.
 And there they all lived in their countries as holy men.
 And some English books make mention that they went
 never out of England after the death of Sir Launcelot,
 but that was but favour of makers.  For the French book
 maketh mention, and is authorised, that Sir Bors, Sir
 Ector, Sir Blamore, and Sir Bleoberis, went into the Holy
 Land thereas Jesu Christ was quick and dead, and anon as
 they had stablished their lands.  For the book saith, so
 Sir Launcelot commanded them for to do, or ever he passed
 out of this world.  And these four knights did many
 battles upon the miscreants or Turks.  And there they
 died upon a Good Friday for God's sake.
