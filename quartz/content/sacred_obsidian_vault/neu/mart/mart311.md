 CHAPTER LXXIV
 
 How the second day Palomides forsook Sir Tristram, and
 went to the contrary part against him.
 
 
 THEN there was a cry unto all knights, that when they
 heard an horn blow they should make jousts as they did the
 first day.  And like as the brethren Sir Edward and Sir
 Sadok began the jousts the first day, Sir Uwaine the
 king's son Urien and Sir Lucanere de Buttelere began
 the jousts the second day.  And at the first encounter
 
 Sir Uwaine smote down the King's son of Scots; and
 Sir Lucanere ran against the King of Wales, and they
 brake their spears all to pieces; and they were so fierce
 both, that they hurtled together that both fell to the
 earth.  Then they of Orkney horsed again Sir Lucanere.
 And then came in Sir Tristram de Liones; and then
 Sir Tristram smote down Sir Uwaine and Sir Lucanere;
 and Sir Palomides smote down other two knights and
 Sir Gareth smote down other two knights.  Then
 said Sir Arthur unto Sir Launcelot:  See yonder three
 knights do passingly well, and namely the first that
 jousted.  Sir, said Launcelot, that knight began not yet
 but ye shall see him this day do marvellously.  And then
 came into the place the duke's son of Orkney, and then
 they began to do many deeds of arms.
 
 When Sir Tristram saw them so begin, he said to
 Palomides:  How feel ye yourself? may ye do this day
 as ye did yesterday?  Nay, said Palomides, I feel myself
 so weary, and so sore bruised of the deeds of yesterday,
 that I may not endure as I did yesterday.  That me
 repenteth, said Sir Tristram, for I shall lack you this
 day.  Sir Palomides said:  Trust not to me, for I may
 not do as I did.  All these words said Palomides for to
 beguile Sir Tristram.  Sir, said Sir Tristram unto Sir
 Gareth, then must I trust upon you; wherefore I pray
 you be not far from me to rescue me.  An need be,
 said Sir Gareth, I shall not fail you in all that I may do.
 Then Sir Palomides rode by himself; and then in despite
 of Sir Tristram he put himself in the thickest press among
 them of Orkney, and there he did so marvellously deeds
 of arms that all men had wonder of him, for there might
 none stand him a stroke.
 
 When Sir Tristram saw Sir Palomides do such deeds,
 he marvelled and said to himself:  He is weary of my
 company.  So Sir Tristram beheld him a great while
 and did but little else, for the noise and cry was so huge
 and great that Sir Tristram marvelled from whence came
 the strength that Sir Palomides had there in the field
 Sir, said Sir Gareth unto Sir Tristram, remember ye not
 of the words that Sir Dinadan said to you yesterday,
 when he called you a coward; forsooth, sir, he said it
 for none ill, for ye are the man in the world that he
 most loveth, and all that he said was for your worship.
 And therefore, said Sir Gareth to Sir Tristram, let me
 know this day what ye be; and wonder ye not so upon
 Sir Palomides, for he enforceth himself to win all the
 worship and honour from you.  I may well believe it,
 said Sir Tristram.  And sithen I understand his evil
 will and his envy, ye shall see, if that I enforce myself,
 that the noise shall be left that now is upon him.
 
 Then Sir Tristram rode into the thickest of the
 press, and then he did so marvellously well, and did so
 great deeds of arms, that all men said that Sir Tristram
 did double so much deeds of arms as Sir Palomides had
 done aforehand.  And then the noise went plain from
 Sir Palomides, and all the people cried upon Sir Tristram.
 O Jesu, said the people, see how Sir Tristram smiteth
 down with his spear so many knights.  And see, said
 they all, how many knights he smiteth down with his
 sword, and of how many knights he rashed off their
 helms and their shields; and so he beat them all of
 Orkney afore him.  How now, said Sir Launcelot unto
 King Arthur, I told you that this day there would a
 knight play his pageant.  Yonder rideth a knight ye
 may see he doth knightly, for he hath strength and wind.
 So God me help, said Arthur to Launcelot, ye say sooth,
 for I saw never a better knight, for he passeth far Sir
 Palomides.  Sir, wit ye well, said Launcelot, it must
 be so of right, for it is himself, that noble knight Sir
 Tristram.  I may right well believe it, said Arthur.
 
 But when Sir Palomides heard the noise and the
 cry was turned from him, he rode out on a part and
 beheld Sir Tristram.  And when Sir Palomides saw Sir
 Tristram do so marvellously well he wept passingly
 sore for despite, for he wist well he should no worship
 win that day; for well knew Sir Palomides, when Sir
 Tristram would put forth his strength and his manhood,
 be should get but little worship that day,
