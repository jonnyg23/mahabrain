 CHAPTER XIII
 
 How there was a party made of an hundred knights against
 an hundred knights, and of other matters
 
 
 THEN Arthur made a party of hundred knights to be
 against an hundred knights.  And so upon the morn they
 jousted for a diamond, but there jousted none of the
 dangerous knights; and so for to shorten this tale, Sir
 Urre and Sir Lavaine jousted best that day, for there was
 none of them but he overthrew and pulled down thirty
 knights; and then by the assent of all the kings and
 lords, Sir Urre and Sir Lavaine were made knights of the
 Table Round.  And Sir Lavaine cast his love unto Dame
 Felelolie, Sir Urre's sister, and then they were wedded
 together with great joy, and King Arthur gave to everych
 of them a barony of lands.  And this Sir Urre would
 never go from Sir Launcelot, but he and Sir Lavaine
 awaited evermore upon him; and they were in all the
 court accounted for good knights, and full desirous in
 arms; and many noble deeds they did, for they would
 have no rest, but ever sought adventures.
 
 Thus they lived in all that court with great noblesse
 and joy long time.  But every night and day Sir Agravaine,
 Sir Gawaine's brother, awaited Queen Guenever and Sir
 Launcelot du Lake to put them to a rebuke and shame.
 And so I leave here of this tale, and overskip great books
 of Sir Launcelot du Lake, what great adventures he did
 when he was called Le Chevaler du Chariot.  For as the
 French book saith, because of despite that knights and
 ladies called him the knight that rode in the chariot like
 as he were judged to the gallows, therefore in despite of
 all them that named him so, he was carried in a chariot a
 twelvemonth, for, but little after that he had slain Sir
 Meliagrance in the queen's quarrel, he never in a twelvemonth
 came on horseback.  And as the French book
 saith, he did that twelvemonth more than forty battles.
 And because I have lost the very matter of Le Chevaier
 du Chariot, I depart from the tale of Sir Launcelot, and
 here I go unto the morte of King Arthur; and that
 caused Sir Agravaine.
