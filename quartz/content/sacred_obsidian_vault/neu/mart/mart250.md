 CHAPTER XIII
 
 How Sir Palomides by adventure met King Mark flying,
 and how he overthrew Dagonet and other knights.
 
 
 SO King Mark rode by fortune by a well, in the way
 where stood a knight-errant on horseback, armed at all
 points, with a great spear in his hand.  And when he
 saw King Mark coming flying he said:  Knight, return
 again for shame and stand with me, and I shall be thy
 warrant.  Ah, fair knight, said King Mark, let me pass,
 for yonder cometh after me the best knight of the world,
 with the black bended shield.  Fie, for shame, said the
 knight, he is none of the worthy knights, and if he were
 Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram I should not doubt to
 meet the better of them both.  When King Mark heard
 him say that word, he turned his horse and abode by
 him.  And then that strong knight bare a spear to
 Dagonet, and smote him so sore that he bare him over
 his horse's tail, and nigh he had broken his neck.  And
 anon after him came Sir Brandiles, and when he saw
 Dagonet have that fall he was passing wroth, and cried:
 Keep thee, knight, and so they hurtled together wonder
 sore.  But the knight smote Sir Brandiles so sore that
 he went to the earth, horse and man.  Sir Uwaine came
 after and saw all this.  Jesu, said he, yonder is a strong
 knight.  And then they feutred their spears, and this
 knight came so eagerly that he smote down Sir Uwaine.
 Then came Ozana with the hardy heart, and he was
 smitten down.  Now, said Sir Griflet, by my counsel let
 us send to yonder errant-knight, and wit whether he be
 of Arthur's court, for as I deem it is Sir Lamorak de
 Galis.  So they sent unto him, and prayed the strange
 knight to tell his name, and whether he were of Arthur's
 court or not.  As for my name they shall not wit, but
 tell them I am a knight-errant as they are, and let them
 wit that I am no knight of King Arthur's court; and
 so the squire rode again unto them and told them his
 answer of him.  By my head, said Sir Agravaine, he is
 one of the strongest knights that ever I saw, for he hath
 overthrown three noble knights, and needs we must
 encounter with him for shame.  So Sir Agravaine feutred
 his spear, and that other was ready, and smote him down
 over his horse to the earth.  And in the same wise he
 smote Sir Uwaine les Avoutres and also Sir Griflet.
 Then had he served them all but Sir Dinadan, for he
 was behind, and Sir Mordred was unarmed, and Dagonet
 had his harness.
 
 So when this was done, this strong knight rode on
 his way a soft pace, and King Mark rode after him,
 praising him mickle; but he would answer no words,
 but sighed wonderly sore, hanging down his head, taking
 no heed to his words.  Thus they rode well a three mile
 English, and then this knight called to him a varlet, and
 bade him ride until yonder fair manor, and recommend
 me to the lady of that castle and place, and pray her to
 send me refreshing of good meats and drinks.  And if
 she ask thee what I am, tell her that I am the knight
 that followeth the glatisant beast: that is in English to
 say the questing beast; for that beast wheresomever he
 yede he quested in the belly with such a noise as it had
 been a thirty couple of hounds.  Then the varlet went
 his way and came to the manor, and saluted the lady, and
 told her from whence he came.  And when she understood
 that he came from the knight that followed the
 questing beast:  O sweet Lord Jesu, she said, when shall
 I see that noble knight, my dear son Palomides?  Alas,
 will he not abide with me? and therewith she swooned
 and wept, and made passing great dole.  And then also
 soon as she might she gave the varlet all that he asked.
 And the varlet returned unto Sir Palomides, for he was
 a varlet of King Mark.  And as soon as he came, he
 told the knight's name was Sir Palomides.  I am well
 pleased, said King Mark, but hold thee still and say
 nothing.  Then they alighted and set them down and
 reposed them a while.  Anon withal King Mark fell
 asleep.  When Sir Palomides saw him sound asleep he
 took his horse and rode his way, and said to them:  I
 will not be in the company of a sleeping knight.  And
 so he rode forth a great pace.
