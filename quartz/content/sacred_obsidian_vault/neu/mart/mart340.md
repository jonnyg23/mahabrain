 CHAPTER I
 
 How Sir Launcelot in his madness took a sword and fought
 with a knight, and leapt in a bed.
 
 
 AND now leave we of a while of Sir Ector and of Sir
 Percivale, and speak we of Sir Launcelot that suffered and
 endured many sharp showers, that ever ran wild wood
 from place to place, and lived by fruit and such as he
 might get, and drank water two year; and other clothing
 had he but little but his shirt and his breech.  Thus as
 Sir Launcelot wandered here and there he came in a fair
 meadow where he found a pavilion; and there by, upon
 a tree, there hung a white shield, and two swords hung
 thereby, and two spears leaned there by a tree.  And
 when Sir Launcelot saw the swords, anon he leapt to the
 one sword, and took it in his hand, and drew it out.  And
 then he lashed at the shield, that all the meadow rang of
 the dints, that he gave such a noise as ten knights had
 foughten together.
 
 Then came forth a dwarf, and leapt unto Sir Launcelot,
 and would have had the sword out of his hand.  And
 then Sir Launcelot took him by the both shoulders and
 threw him to the ground upon his neck, that he had
 almost broken his neck; and therewithal the dwarf cried
 help.  Then came forth a likely knight, and well
 apparelled in scarlet furred with minever.  And anon as
 he saw Sir Launcelot he deemed that he should be out of
 his wit.  And then he said with fair speech:  Good man,
 lay down that sword, for as meseemeth thou hadst more
 need of sleep and of warm clothes than to wield that
 sword.  As for that, said Sir Launcelot, come not too
 nigh, for an thou do, wit thou well I will slay thee.
 
 And when the knight of the pavilion saw that, he
 stert backward within the pavilion.  And then the dwarf
 armed him lightly; and so the knight thought by force
 and might to take the sword from Sir Launcelot, and so
 he came stepping out; and when Sir Launcelot saw him
 come so all armed with his sword in his hand, then Sir
 Launcelot flew to him with such a might, and hit him
 upon the helm such a buffet, that the stroke troubled his
 brains, and therewith the sword brake in three.  And the
 knight fell to the earth as he had been dead, the blood
 brasting out of his mouth, the nose, and the ears.  And
 then Sir Launcelot ran into the pavilion, and rushed even
 into the warm bed; and there was a lady in that bed, and
 she gat her smock, and ran out of the pavilion.  And when
 she saw her lord lie at the ground like to be dead, then
 she cried and wept as she had been mad.  Then with her
 noise the knight awaked out of his swoon, and looked up
 weakly with his eyes; and then he asked her, where was
 that mad man that had given him such a buffet:  For
 such a buffet had I never of man's hand.  Sir, said the
 dwarf, it is not worship to hurt him, for he is a man out
 of his wit; and doubt ye not he hath been a man of great
 worship, and for some heartly sorrow that he hath taken,
 he is fallen mad; and me beseemeth, said the dwarf, he
 resembleth much unto Sir Launcelot, for him I saw at the
 great tournament beside Lonazep.  Jesu defend, said
 that knight, that ever that noble knight, Sir Launcelot,
 should be in such a plight; but whatsomever he be, said
 that knight, harm will I none do him: and this knight's
 name was Bliant.  Then he said unto the dwarf:  Go
 thou fast on horseback, unto my brother Sir Selivant, that
 is at the Castle Blank, and tell him of mine adventure,
 and bid him bring with him an horse litter, and then will
 we bear this knight unto my castle.
