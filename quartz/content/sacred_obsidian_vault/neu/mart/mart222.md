 CHAPTER XXIX
 
 How Sir Launcelot jousted with Palomides and overthrew
 him, and after he was assailed with twelve knights.
 
 THEN Sir Palomides sent unto Sir Launcelot a squire, and required
 him of jousts.  Fair fellow, said Sir Launcelot, &lt;402&gt;tell me thy
 lord's name.  Sir, said the squire, my lord's name is Sir
 Palomides, the good knight.  In good hour, said Sir Launcelot,
 for there is no knight that I saw this seven years that I had
 liefer ado withal than with him.  And so either knights made them
 ready with two great spears.  Nay, said Sir Dinadan, ye shall see
 that Sir Palomides will quit him right well.  It may be so, said
 Sir Tristram, but I undertake that knight with the shield of
 Cornwall shall give him a fall.  I believe it not, said Sir
 Dinadan.  Right so they spurred their horses and feutred their
 spears, and either hit other, and Sir Palomides brake a spear
 upon Sir Launcelot, and he sat and moved not; but Sir Launcelot
 smote him so lightly that he made his horse to avoid the saddle,
 and the stroke brake his shield and the hauberk, and had he not
 fallen he had been slain.  How now, said Sir Tristram, I wist
 well by the manner of their riding both that Sir Palomides should
 have a fall.
 
 Right so Sir Launcelot rode his way, and rode to a well to drink
 and to repose him, and they of Northgalis espied him whither he
 rode; and then there followed him twelve knights for to have
 mischieved him, for this cause that upon the morn at the
 tournament of the Castle of Maidens that he should not win the
 victory.  So they came upon Sir Launcelot suddenly, and unnethe
 he might put upon him his helm and take his horse, but they were
 in hands with him; and then Sir Launcelot gat his spear, and rode
 through them, and there he slew a knight and brake a spear in his
 body.  Then he drew his sword and smote upon the right hand and
 upon the left hand, so that within a few strokes he had slain
 other three knights, and the remnant that abode he wounded them
 sore all that did abide.  Thus Sir Launcelot escaped from his
 enemies of North Wales, and then Sir Launcelot rode his way till
 a friend, and lodged him till on the morn; for he would not the
 first day have ado in the tournament
 because of his great labour.  And on the first day he was with
 King Arthur thereas he was set on high upon a scaffold to discern
 who was best worthy of his deeds.  So &lt;403&gt;Sir Launcelot was with
 King Arthur, and jousted not the first day.
