 CHAPTER XVII
 
 How Sir Launcelot returned towards Logris, and of other
 adventures which he saw in the way.
 
 
 THEN King Pelles came to Sir Launcelot and told him
 tidings of his brother, whereof he was sorry, that he wist
 not what to do.  So Sir Launcelot departed, and took his
 arms, and said he would go see the realm of Logris,
 which I have not seen in twelve months.  And there
 with he commended the king to God, and so rode through
 many realms.  And at the last he came to a white abbey,
 and there they made him that night great cheer; and on
 the morn he rose and heard mass.  And afore an altar
 he found a rich tomb, which was newly made; and then
 he took heed, and saw the sides written with gold which
 said:  Here lieth King Bagdemagus of Gore, which King
 Arthur's nephew slew; and named him, Sir Gawaine.
 Then was not he a little sorry, for Launcelot loved him
 much more than any other, and had it been any other
 than Gawaine he should not have escaped from death to
 life; and said to himself:  Ah Lord God, this is a great
 hurt unto King Arthur's court, the loss of such a man.
 And then he departed and came to the abbey where
 Galahad did the adventure of the tombs, and won the
 white shield with the red cross; and there had he great
 cheer all that night.
 
 And on the morn he turned unto Camelot, where he
 found King Arthur and the queen.  But many of the
 knights of the Round Table were slain and destroyed,
 more than half.  And so three were come home, Ector,
 Gawaine, and Lionel, and many other that need not to
 be rehearsed.  And all the court was passing glad of Sir
 Launcelot, and the king asked him many tidings of his
 son Galahad.  And there Launcelot told the king of his
 adventures that had befallen him since he departed.  And
 also he told him of the adventures of Galahad, Percivale,
 and Bors, which that he knew by the letter of the dead
 damosel, and as Galahad had told him.  Now God would,
 said the king, that they were all three here.  That shall
 never be, said Launcelot, for two of them shall ye never
 see, but one of them shall come again.
 
 Now leave we this story and speak of Galahad.
