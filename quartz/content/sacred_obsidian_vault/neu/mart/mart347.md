 CHAPTER VIlI
 
 How each of them knew other, and of their great courtesy,
 and how his brother Sir Ector came unto him, and of
 their joy.
 
 
 AND therewithal Sir Launcelot kneeled down upon his
 knees, and threw away his shield and his sword from
 him.  When Sir Percivale saw him do so he marvelled
 what he meant.  And then thus he said:  Sir knight,
 whatsomever thou be, I require thee upon the high
 order of knighthood, tell me thy true name.  Then he
 said:  So God me help, my name is Sir Launcelot du
 Lake, King Ban's son of Benoy.  Alas, said Sir Percivale,
 what have I done?  I was sent by the queen for to
 seek you, and so I have sought you nigh this two
 year, and yonder is Sir Ector de Maris, your brother
 abideth me on the other side of the yonder water.  Now
 for God's sake, said Sir Percivale, forgive me mine offences
 that I have here done.  It is soon forgiven, said Sir
 Launcelot.
 
 Then Sir Percivale sent for Sir Ector de Maris, 
 and when Sir Launcelot had a sight of him, he ran
 unto him and took him in his arms; and then Sir
 Ector kneeled down, and either wept upon other, that
 all had pity to behold them.  Then came Dame Elaine
 and she there made them great cheer as might lie in
 her power; and there she told Sir Ector and Sir
 Percivale how and in what manner Sir Launcelot came
 into that country, and how he was healed; and there
 it was known how long Sir Launcelot was with Sir
 Bliant and with Sir Selivant, and how he first met with
 them, and how he departed from them because of a
 boar; and how the hermit healed Sir Launcelot of his
 great wound, and how that he came to Corbin.
