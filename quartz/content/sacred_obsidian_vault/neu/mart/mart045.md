 CHAPTER XIX
 
 How Merlin buried them both in one tomb, and of
 Balin's sword.
 
 IN the morn came Merlin and let write Balin's name on the tomb
 with letters of gold, that Here lieth Balin le Savage that was
 the Knight with the Two Swords, and he that smote the Dolorous
 Stroke.  Also Merlin let make there a bed, that there should
 never man lie therein but he went out of his wit, yet Launcelot
 de Lake fordid that bed through his noblesse.  And anon after
 Balin was dead, Merlin took his sword, and took off the pommel
 and set on another pommel.  So Merlin bade a knight that stood
 afore him handle that sword, and he assayed, and he might not
 handle it.  Then Merlin laughed.  Why laugh ye? said the knight. 
 This is the cause, said Merlin: there shall never man handle this
 sword but the best knight of the world, and that shall be Sir
 Launcelot or else Galahad his son, and Launcelot with this sword
 shall slay the man that in the world he loved best, that shall be
 Sir Gawaine.  All this he let write in the pommel of the sword. 
 Then Merlin let make a bridge of iron and of steel into that
 island, and it was but half a foot broad, and there shall never
 man pass that bridge, nor have hardiness to go over, but if he
 were a passing good man and a good knight without treachery or
 villainy.  Also the scabbard of Balin's sword Merlin left it on
 this side the island, that Galahad should find it.  Also Merlin
 let make by his subtilty that Balin's sword was put in a marble
 stone standing upright as great as a mill stone, and the stone
 hoved always above the water and did many years, and so by
 adventure it swam down the stream to the City of Camelot, that is
 in English Winchester.  And that same day Galahad the haut prince
 came with King Arthur, and so Galahad brought with him the
 scabbard and achieved the sword that was there in the marble
 stone &lt;78&gt;hoving upon the water.  And on Whitsunday he achieved
 the sword as it is rehearsed in the book of Sangreal.
 
 Soon after this was done Merlin came to King Arthur and told him
 of the dolorous stroke that Balin gave to King Pellam, and how
 Balin and Balan fought together the marvellest battle that ever
 was heard of, and how they were buried both in one tomb.  Alas,
 said King Arthur, this is the greatest pity that ever I heard
 tell of two knights, for in the world I know not such two
 knights.  Thus endeth the tale of Balin and of Balan, two
 brethren born in Northumberland, good knights.
