 CHAPTER XIX
 
 How King Mark sent Sir Tristram for La Beale Isoud
 toward Ireland, and how by fortune he arrived into England.
 
 THEN when this was done King Mark cast always in his heart how he
 might destroy Sir Tristram.  And then he imagined in himself to
 send Sir Tristram into Ireland for La Beale Isoud.  For Sir
 Tristram had so praised her beauty and her goodness that King
 Mark said that he would wed her, whereupon he prayed Sir Tristram
 to take his way into Ireland for him on message.  And all this
 was done to the intent to slay Sir Tristram.  Notwithstanding,
 Sir Tristram would not refuse the message for no danger nor peril
 that might fall, for the pleasure of his uncle, but to go he made
 him ready in the most goodliest wise that might be devised.  For
 Sir Tristram took with him the most goodliest knights that he
 might find in the court; and they were arrayed, after the guise
 that was then used, in the goodliest manner.  So Sir Tristram
 departed and took the sea with all his fellowship.  And anon, as
 he was in the broad sea a tempest took him and his fellowship,
 and drove them back into the coast of England; and there they
 arrived fast by Camelot, and full fain they were to take the
 land.
 
 And when they were landed Sir Tristram set up his pavilion upon
 the land of Camelot, and there he let hang his shield upon the
 pavilion.  And that same day came two knights of King Arthur's,
 that one was Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir Morganor.  And they
 touched the shield, and bade him come out of the pavilion for to
 joust, an he would joust.  Ye shall be answered, said Sir
 Tristram, an ye will tarry a little while.  So he made him ready,
 and first he smote down Sir Ector de Maris, and after he smote
 down Sir Morganor, all with one spear, and sore bruised them. 
 And when they lay upon the earth they asked Sir &lt;311&gt;Tristram
 what he was, and of what country he was knight.  Fair lords, said
 Sir Tristram, wit ye well that I am of Cornwall.  Alas, said Sir
 Ector, now am I ashamed that ever any Cornish knight should
 overcome me.  And then for despite Sir Ector put off his armour
 from him, and went on foot, and would not ride.
