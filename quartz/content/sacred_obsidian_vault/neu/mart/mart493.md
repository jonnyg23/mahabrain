 CHAPTER IV
 
 How by misadventure of an adder the battle began, where
 Mordred was slain, and Arthur hurt to the death
 
 
 THEN were they condescended that King Arthur and
 Sir Mordred should meet betwixt both their hosts, and
 everych of them should bring fourteen persons; and they
 came with this word unto Arthur.  Then said he:  I am
 glad that this is done: and so he went into the field.  And
 when Arthur should depart, he warned all his host that an
 they see any sword drawn:  Look ye come on fiercely, and
 slay that traitor, Sir Mordred, for I in no wise trust him.
 In like wise Sir Mordred warned his host that:  An ye see
 any sword drawn, look that ye come on fiercely, and so
 slay all that ever before you standeth; for in no wise I
 will not trust for this treaty, for I know well my father
 will be avenged on me.  And so they met as their appointment
 was, and so they were agreed and accorded thoroughly;
 and wine was fetched, and they drank.  Right
 soon came an adder out of a little heath bush, and it stung
 a knight on the foot.  And when the knight felt him
 stung, he looked down and saw the adder, and then he
 drew his sword to slay the adder, and thought of none
 other harm.  And when the host on both parties saw that
 sword drawn, then they blew beams, trumpets, and horns,
 and shouted grimly.  And so both hosts dressed them
 together.  And King Arthur took his horse, and said:
 Alas this unhappy day! and so rode to his party.  And
 Sir Mordred in like wise.  And never was there seen a
 more dolefuller battle in no Christian land; for there was
 but rushing and riding, foining and striking, and many a
 grim word was there spoken either to other, and many a
 deadly stroke.  But ever King Arthur rode throughout
 the battle of Sir Mordred many times, and did full nobly
 as a noble king should, and at all times he fainted never;
 and Sir Mordred that day put him in devoir, and in great
 peril.  And thus they fought all the long day, and never
 stinted till the noble knights were laid to the cold earth;
 and ever they fought still till it was near night, and by
 that time was there an hundred thousand laid dead upon
 the down.  Then was Arthur wood wroth out of measure,
 when he saw his people so slain from him.
 
 Then the king looked about him, and then was he
 ware, of all his host and of all his good knights, were left
 no more alive but two knights; that one was Sir Lucan
 the Butler, and his brother Sir Bedivere, and they were
 full sore wounded.  Jesu mercy, said the king, where are
 all my noble knights become?  Alas that ever I should
 see this doleful day, for now, said Arthur, I am come to
 mine end.  But would to God that I wist where were that
 traitor Sir Mordred, that hath caused all this mischief.
 Then was King Arthur ware where Sir Mordred leaned
 upon his sword among a great heap of dead men.  Now
 give me my spear, said Arthur unto Sir Lucan, for yonder
 I have espied the traitor that all this woe hath wrought.
 Sir, let him be, said Sir Lucan, for he is unhappy; and if
 ye pass this unhappy day ye shall be right well revenged
 upon him.  Good lord, remember ye of your night's
 dream, and what the spirit of Sir Gawaine told you this
 night, yet God of his great goodness hath preserved you
 hitherto.  Therefore, for God's sake, my lord, leave off
 by this, for blessed be God ye have won the field, for here
 we be three alive, and with Sir Mordred is none alive;
 and if ye leave off now this wicked day of destiny is past.
 Tide me death, betide me life, saith the king, now I see
 him yonder alone he shall never escape mine hands, for at
 a better avail shall I never have him.  God speed you
 well, said Sir Bedivere.
 
 Then the king gat his spear in both his hands, and ran
 toward Sir Mordred, crying:  Traitor, now is thy death-day
 come.  And when Sir Mordred heard Sir Arthur, he
 ran until him with his sword drawn in his hand.  And
 there King Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the shield,
 with a foin of his spear, throughout the body, more than
 a fathom.  And when Sir Mordred felt that he had his
 death wound he thrust himself with the might that he
 had up to the bur of King Arthur's spear.  And right
 so he smote his father Arthur, with his sword holden in
 both his hands, on the side of the head, that the sword
 pierced the helmet and the brain-pan, and therewithal Sir
 Mordred fell stark dead to the earth; and the noble
 Arthur fell in a swoon to the earth, and there he swooned
 ofttimes.  And Sir Lucan the Butler and Sir Bedivere
 ofttimes heaved him up.  And so weakly they led him
 betwixt them both, to a little chapel not far from
 the seaside.  And when the king was there he thought him well
 eased.
 
 Then heard they people cry in the field.  Now go
 thou, Sir Lucan, said the king, and do me to wit what
 betokens that noise in the field.  So Sir Lucan departed,
 for he was grievously wounded in many places.  And so
 as he yede, he saw and hearkened by the moonlight, how
 that pillers and robbers were come into the field, to pill
 and to rob many a full noble knight of brooches, and
 beads, of many a good ring, and of many a rich jewel;
 and who that were not dead all out, there they slew them
 for their harness and their riches.  When Sir Lucan
 understood this work, he came to the king as soon as he might,
 and told him all what he had heard and seen.  Therefore
 by my rede, said Sir Lucan, it is best that we bring you
 to some town.  I would it were so, said the king.
