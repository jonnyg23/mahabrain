 CHAPTER XI
 
 How La Beale Isoud counselled Sir Tristram to go unto the
 court, to the great feast of Pentecost.
 
 
 NOW will we leave off this matter, and speak we of Sir
 Tristram, and of Sir Palomides that was the Saracen
 unchristened.  When Sir Tristram was come home unto
 Joyous Gard from his adventures, all this while that Sir
 Launcelot was thus missed, two year and more, Sir
 Tristram bare the renown through all the realm of Logris,
 and many strange adventures befell him, and full well and
 manly and worshipfully he brought them to an end.  So
 when he was come home La Beale Isoud told him of the
 great feast that should be at Pentecost next following, and
 there she told him how Sir Launcelot had been missed two
 year, and all that while he had been out of his mind, and
 how he was holpen by the holy vessel, the Sangreal.  Alas,
 said Sir Tristram, that caused some debate betwixt him
 and Queen Guenever.  Sir, said Dame Isoud, I know it
 all, for Queen Guenever sent me a letter in the which she
 wrote me all how it was, for to require you to seek him.
 And now, blessed be God, said La Beale Isoud, he is whole
 and sound and come again to the court.
 
 Thereof am I glad, said Sir Tristram, and now shall
 ye and I make us ready, for both ye and I will be at the
 feast.  Sir, said Isoud, an it please you I will not be there,
 for through me ye be marked of many good knights, and
 that caused you to have much more labour for my sake
 than needeth you.  Then will I not be there, said Sir
 Tristram, but if ye be there.  God defend, said La Beale
 Isoud, for then shall I be spoken of shame among all
 queens and ladies of estate; for ye that are called one of
 the noblest knights of the world, and ye a knight of the
 Round Table, how may ye be missed at that feast?  What
 shall be said among all knights?  See how Sir Tristram
 hunteth, and hawketh, and cowereth within a castle with
 his lady, and forsaketh your worship.  Alas, shall some
 say, it is pity that ever he was made knight, or that ever
 he should have the love of a lady.  Also what shall queens
 and ladies say of me?  It is pity that I have my life, that
 I will hold so noble a knight as ye are from his worship.
 So God me help, said Sir Tristram unto La Beale Isoud,
 it is passing well said of you and nobly counselled; and
 now I well understand that ye love me; and like as ye
 have counselled me I will do a part thereafter.  But there
 shall no man nor child ride with me, but myself.  And so
 will I ride on Tuesday next coming, and no more harness
 of war but my spear and my sword.
