 CHAPTER IX
 
 Of the battle between King Arthur and Accolon.
 
 AND then they dressed them on both parties of the field, and let
 their horses run so fast that either smote other in the midst of
 the shield with their spear-heads, that both horse and man went
 to the earth; and then they started up both, and pulled out their
 swords.  The meanwhile that they were thus at the battle, came
 the Damosel of the Lake into the field, that put Merlin under the
 stone; and she came thither for love of King Arthur, for she knew
 how Morgan le Fay had so ordained that King Arthur should have
 been slain that day, and therefore she came to save his life. 
 And so they went eagerly to the battle, and gave many great
 strokes, but always Arthur's sword bit not like Accolon's sword;
 but for the most part, every stroke that Accolon gave he wounded
 sore Arthur, that it was marvel he stood, and always his blood
 fell from him fast.
 
 When Arthur beheld the ground so sore be-bled he was dismayed,
 and then he deemed treason that his sword was changed; for his
 sword bit not steel as it was wont to do, therefore he dreaded
 him sore to be dead, for ever him seemed that the sword in
 Accolon's hand was Excalibur, for at every stroke that Accolon
 struck he drew blood on Arthur.  Now, knight, said Accolon unto
 Arthur, keep thee well from me; but Arthur answered not again,
 and gave him such a buffet on the helm that it made him to stoop,
 nigh falling down to the earth.  Then &lt;116&gt;Sir Accolon withdrew
 him a little, and came on with Excalibur on high, and smote Sir
 Arthur such a buffet that he fell nigh to the earth.  Then were
 they wroth both, and gave each other many sore strokes, but
 always Sir Arthur lost so much blood that it was marvel he stood
 on his feet, but he was so full of knighthood that knightly he
 endured the pain.  And Sir Accolon lost not a deal of blood,
 therefore he waxed passing light, and Sir Arthur was passing
 feeble, and weened verily to have died; but for all that he made
 countenance as though he might endure, and held Accolon as short
 as he might.  But Accolon was so bold because of Excalibur that
 he waxed passing hardy.  But all men that beheld him said they
 saw never knight fight so well as Arthur did considering the
 blood that he bled.  So was all the people sorry for him, but the
 two brethren would not accord.  Then always they fought together
 as fierce knights, and Sir Arthur withdrew him a little for to
 rest him, and Sir Accolon called him to battle and said, It is no
 time for me to suffer thee to rest.  And therewith he came
 fiercely upon Arthur, and Sir Arthur was wroth for the blood that
 he had lost, and smote Accolon on high upon the helm, so
 mightily, that he made him nigh to fall to the earth; and
 therewith Arthur's sword brast at the cross, and fell in the
 grass among the blood, and the pommel and the sure handles he
 held in his hands.  When Sir Arthur saw that, he was in great
 fear to die, but always he held up his shield and lost no ground,
 nor bated no cheer.
