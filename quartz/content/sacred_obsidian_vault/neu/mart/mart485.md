 CHAPTER XVIII
 
 How Sir Launcelot passed over the sea, and how he made
 great lords of the knights that went with him
 
 
 TRULY, said Sir Launcelot, I thank you all of your good
 saying, howbeit, I wot well, in me was not all the stability
 of this realm, but in that I might I did my devoir; and
 well I am sure I knew many rebellions in my days that by
 me were peaced, and I trow we all shall hear of them in
 short space, and that me sore repenteth.  For ever I dread
 me, said Sir Launcelot, that Sir Mordred will make trouble,
 for he is passing envious and applieth him to trouble.  So
 they were accorded to go with Sir Launcelot to his lands;
 and to make short tale, they trussed, and paid all that
 would ask them; and wholly an hundred knights departed
 with Sir Launcelot at once, and made their avows they
 would never leave him for weal nor for woe.
 
 And so they shipped at Cardiff, and sailed unto Benwick:
 some men call it Bayonne, and some men call it
 Beaune, where the wine of Beaune is.  But to say the
 sooth, Sir Launcelot and his nephews were lords of all
 France, and of all the lands that longed unto France; he
 and his kindred rejoiced it all through Sir Launcelot's
 noble prowess.  And then Sir Launcelot stuffed and
 furnished and garnished all his noble towns and castles.
 Then all the people of those lands came to Sir Launcelot
 on foot and hands.  And so when he had stablished all
 these countries, he shortly called a parliament; and there
 he crowned Sir Lionel, King of France; and Sir Bors [he]
 crowned him king of all King Claudas' lands; and Sir
 Ector de Maris, that was Sir Launcelot's youngest brother,
 he crowned him King of Benwick, and king of all Guienne,
 that was Sir Launcelot's own land.  And he made Sir Ector
 prince of them all, and thus he departed.
 
 Then Sir Launcelot advanced all his noble knights,
 and first he advanced them of his blood; that was Sir
 Blamore, he made him Duke of Limosin in Guienne
 and Sir Bleoberis he made him Duke of Poictiers, and
 Sir Gahalantine he made him Duke of Querne, and
 Sir Galihodin he made him Duke of Sentonge, and Sir
 Galihud he made him Earl of Perigot, and Sir Menadeuke
 he made him Earl of Roerge, and Sir Villiars the
 Valiant he made him Earl of Bearn, and Sir Hebes le
 Renoumes he made him Earl of Comange, and Sir
 Lavaine he made him Earl of Arminak, and Sir Urre
 he made him Earl of Estrake, and Sir Neroneus he made him
 Earl of Pardiak, and Sir Plenorius he made Earl of Foise,
 and Sir Selises of the Dolorous Tower he made him Earl
 of Masauke, and Sir Melias de Lile he made him Earl of
 Tursauk, and Sir Bellangere le Beuse he made Earl of the
 Launds, and Sir Palomides he made him Duke of the
 Provence, and Sir Safere he made him Duke of Landok, and
 Sir Clegis he gave him the Earldom of Agente, and Sir
 Sadok he gave the Earldom of Surlat, and Sir Dinas le
 Seneschal he made him Duke of Anjou, and Sir Clarrus
 he made him Duke of Normandy.  Thus Sir Launcelot
 rewarded his noble knights and many more, that meseemeth
 it were too long to rehearse
