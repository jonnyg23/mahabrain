 CHAPTER X
 
 How Merlin counselled King Arthur to send for King Ban and King
 Bors, and of their counsel taken for the war.
 
 SO after the feast and journey, King Arthur drew him unto London,
 and so by the counsel of Merlin, the king let call his barons to
 council, for Merlin had told the king that the six kings that
 made war upon him would in all haste be awroke on him and on his
 lands.  Wherefore the king asked counsel at them all.  They could
 no counsel give, but said they were big enough.  Ye say well,
 said Arthur; I thank you for your good courage, but will ye all
 that loveth me speak with Merlin? ye know well that he hath done
 much for me, and he knoweth many things, and when he is afore
 you, I would that ye prayed him heartily of his best advice.  All
 the barons said they would pray him and desire him.  So Merlin
 was sent for, and fair desired of all the barons to give them
 best counsel.  I shall say you, said Merlin, I warn you all, your
 enemies are passing strong for you, and they are good men of arms
 as be alive, and by this time they have gotten to them four kings
 more, and a mighty duke; and unless that our king have more
 chivalry with him than he may make within the bounds of his own
 realm, an he fight with them in battle, he shall be overcome and
 slain.  What were best to do in this cause? said all the barons. 
 I shall tell you, said Merlin, mine advice; there are two
 brethren beyond the sea, and they be kings both, and marvellous
 good men of their hands; and that one hight King Ban of Benwick,
 and that other hight King Bors of &lt;16&gt;Gaul, that is France.  And
 on these two kings warreth a mighty man of men, the King Claudas,
 and striveth with them for a castle, and great war is betwixt
 them.  But this Claudas is so mighty of goods whereof he getteth
 good knights, that he putteth these two kings most part to the
 worse; wherefore this is my counsel, that our king and sovereign
 lord send unto the kings Ban and Bors by two trusty knights with
 letters well devised, that an they will come and see King Arthur
 and his court, and so help him in his wars, that he will be sworn
 unto them to help them in their wars against King Claudas.  Now,
 what say ye unto this counsel? said Merlin.  This is well
 counselled, said the king and all the barons.
 
 Right so in all haste there were ordained to go two knights on
 the message unto the two kings.  So were there made letters in
 the pleasant wise according unto King Arthur's desire.  Ulfius
 and Brastias were made the messengers, and so rode forth well
 horsed and well armed and as the guise was that time, and so
 passed the sea and rode toward the city of Benwick.  And there
 besides were eight knights that espied them, and at a strait
 passage they met with Ulfius and Brastias, and would have taken
 them prisoners; so they prayed them that they might pass, for
 they were messengers unto King Ban and Bors sent from King
 Arthur.  Therefore, said the eight knights, ye shall die or be
 prisoners, for we be knights of King Claudas.  And therewith two
 of them dressed their spears, and Ulfius and Brastias dressed
 their spears, and ran together with great raundom.  And Claudas'
 knights brake their spears, and theirs to-held and bare the two
 knights out of their saddles to the earth, and so left them
 lying, and rode their ways.  And the other six knights rode afore
 to a passage to meet with them again, and so Ulfius and Brastias
 smote other two down, and so passed on their ways.  And at the
 fourth passage there met two for two, and both were laid unto the
 earth; so there was none of the eight knights but he was sore
 hurt or bruised.  And when they come to Benwick it fortuned there
 were both kings, Ban and Bors.
 
 &lt;17&gt;
 And when it was told the kings that there were come messengers,
 there were sent unto them two knights of worship, the one hight
 Lionses, lord of the country of Payarne, and Sir Phariance a
 worshipful knight.  Anon they asked from whence they came, and
 they said from King Arthur, king of England; so they took them in
 their arms and made great joy each of other.  But anon, as the
 two kings wist they were messengers of Arthur's, there was made
 no tarrying, but forthwith they spake with the knights, and
 welcomed them in the faithfullest wise, and said they were most
 welcome unto them before all the kings living; and therewith they
 kissed the letters and delivered them.  And when Ban and Bors
 understood the letters, then they were more welcome than they
 were before.  And after the haste of the letters they gave them
 this answer, that they would fulfil the desire of King Arthur's
 writing, and Ulfius and Brastias, tarry there as long as they
 would, they should have such cheer as might be made them in those
 marches.  Then Ulfius and Brastias told the kings of the
 adventure at their passages of the eight knights.  Ha! ah! said
 Ban and Bors, they were my good friends.  I would I had wist of
 them; they should not have escaped so.  So Ulfius and Brastias
 had good cheer and great gifts, as much as they might bear away;
 and had their answer by mouth and by writing, that those two
 kings would come unto Arthur in all the haste that they might. 
 So the two knights rode on afore, and passed the sea, and came to
 their lord, and told him how they had sped, whereof King Arthur
 was passing glad.  At what time suppose ye the two kings will be
 here?  Sir, said they, afore All Hallowmass.  Then the king let
 purvey for a great feast, and let cry a great jousts.  And by All
 Hallowmass the two kings were come over the sea with three
 hundred knights well arrayed both for the peace and for the war. 
 And King Arthur met with them ten mile out of London, and there
 was great joy as could be thought or made.  And on All Hallowmass
 at the great feast, sat in the hall the three kings, and Sir Kay
 seneschal served in the hall, and Sir Lucas the butler, that
 &lt;18&gt;was Duke Corneus' son, and Sir Griflet, that was the son of
 Cardol, these three knights had the rule of all the service that
 served the kings.  And anon, as they had washen and risen, all
 knights that would joust made them ready; by then they were ready
 on horseback there were seven hundred knights.  And Arthur, Ban,
 and Bors, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Sir Ector, Kay's
 father, they were in a place covered with cloth of gold like an
 hall, with ladies and gentlewomen, for to behold who did best,
 and thereon to give judgment.
