 CHAPTER IV
 
 How Sir Tor was known for son of King Pellinore,
 and how Gawaine was made knight.
 
 SO on the morn King Pellinore came to the court of King Arthur,
 which had great joy of him, and told him of Tor, how he was his
 son, and how he had made him knight at the request of the
 cowherd.  When Pellinore beheld Tor, he pleased him much.  So the
 king made Gawaine knight, but Tor was the first he made at the
 feast.  What is the cause, said King Arthur, that there be two
 places void in the sieges?  Sir, said Merlin, there shall no man
 sit in those places but they that shall be of most worship.  But
 in the Siege Perilous there shall no man sit therein but one, and
 if there be any so hardy to &lt;84&gt;do it he shall be destroyed, and
 he that shall sit there shall have no fellow.  And therewith
 Merlin took King Pellinore by the hand, and in the one hand next
 the two sieges and the Siege Perilous he said, in open audience,
 This is your place and best ye are worthy to sit therein of any
 that is here.  Thereat sat Sir Gawaine in great envy and told
 Gaheris his brother, yonder knight is put to great worship, the
 which grieveth me sore, for he slew our father King Lot,
 therefore I will slay him, said Gawaine, with a sword that was
 sent me that is passing trenchant.  Ye shall not so, said
 Gaheris, at this time, for at this time I am but a squire, and
 when I am made knight I will be avenged on him, and therefore,
 brother, it is best ye suffer till another time, that we may have
 him out of the court, for an we did so we should trouble this
 high feast.  I will well, said Gawaine, as ye will.
