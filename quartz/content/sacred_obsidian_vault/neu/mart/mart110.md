 CHAPTER X
 
 How Sir Launcelot rode with a damosel and slew a knight
 that distressed all ladies and also a villain that kept a bridge.
 
 NOW turn we unto Sir Launcelot, that rode with the damosel in a
 fair highway.  Sir, said the damosel, here by this way haunteth a
 knight that distressed all ladies and gentlewomen, and at the
 least he robbeth them or lieth by them.  What, said Sir
 Launcelot, is he a thief and a knight and a ravisher of women? he
 doth shame unto the order of knighthood, and contrary unto his
 oath; it is pity that he liveth.  But, fair damosel, ye shall
 ride on afore, yourself, and I will keep myself in covert, and if
 &lt;191&gt;that he trouble you or distress you I shall be your rescue
 and learn him to be ruled as a knight.
 
 So the maid rode on by the way a soft ambling pace, and within a
 while came out that knight on horseback out of the wood, and his
 page with him, and there he put the damosel from her horse, and
 then she cried.  With that came Launcelot as fast as he might
 till he came to that knight, saying, O thou false knight and
 traitor unto knighthood, who did learn thee to distress ladies
 and gentlewomen?  When the knight saw Sir Launcelot thus rebuking
 him he answered not, but drew his sword and rode unto Sir
 Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot threw his spear from him, and drew
 out his sword, and struck him such a buffet on the helmet that he
 clave his head and neck unto the throat.  Now hast thou thy
 payment that long thou hast deserved!  That is truth, said the
 damosel, for like as Sir Turquine watched to destroy knights, so
 did this knight attend to destroy and distress ladies, damosels,
 and gentlewomen, and his name was Sir Peris de Forest Savage. 
 Now, damosel, said Sir Launcelot, will ye any more service of me? 
 Nay, sir, she said, at this time, but almighty Jesu preserve you
 wheresomever ye ride or go, for the curteist knight thou art, and
 meekest unto all ladies and gentlewomen, that now liveth.  But
 one thing, sir knight, methinketh ye lack, ye that are a knight
 wifeless, that he will not love some maiden or gentlewoman, for I
 could never hear say that ever ye loved any of no manner degree,
 and that is great pity; but it is noised that ye love Queen
 Guenever, and that she hath ordained by enchantment that ye shall
 never love none other but her, nor none other damosel nor lady
 shall rejoice you; wherefore many in this land, of high estate
 and low, make great sorrow.
 
 Fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, I may not warn people to speak
 of me what it pleaseth them; but for to be a wedded man, I think
 it not; for then I must couch with her, and leave arms and
 tournaments, battles, and adventures; and as for to say for to
 take my pleasaunce with paramours, that will I refuse in
 principal &lt;192&gt;for dread of God; for knights that be adventurous
 or lecherous shall not be happy nor fortunate unto the wars, for
 other they shall be overcome with a simpler knight than they be
 themselves, other else they shall by unhap and their cursedness
 slay better men than they be themselves.  And so who that useth
 paramours shall be unhappy, and all thing is unhappy that is
 about them.
 
 And so Sir Launcelot and she departed.  And then he rode in a
 deep forest two days and more, and had strait lodging.  So on the
 third day he rode over a long bridge, and there stert upon him
 suddenly a passing foul churl, and he smote his horse on the nose
 that he turned about, and asked him why he rode over that bridge
 without his licence.  Why should I not ride this way? said Sir
 Launcelot, I may not ride beside.  Thou shalt not choose, said
 the churl, and lashed at him with a great club shod with iron. 
 Then Sir Launcelot drew his sword and put the stroke aback, and
 clave his head unto the paps.  At the end of the bridge was a
 fair village, and all the people, men and women, cried on Sir
 Launcelot, and said, A worse deed didst thou never for thyself,
 for thou hast slain the chief porter of our castle.  Sir
 Launcelot let them say what they would, and straight he went into
 the castle; and when he came into the castle he alighted, and
 tied his horse to a ring on the wall and there he saw a fair
 green court, and thither he dressed him, for there him thought
 was a fair place to fight in.  So he looked about, and saw much
 people in doors and windows that said, Fair knight, thou art
 unhappy.
