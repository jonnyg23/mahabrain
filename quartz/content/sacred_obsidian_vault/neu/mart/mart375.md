 CHAPTER II
 
 How Merlin likened the Round Table to the world, and how
 the knights that should achieve the Sangreal should be
 known.
 
 
 ALSO Merlin made the Round Table in tokening of roundness
 of the world, for by the Round Table is the world
 signified by right, for all the world, Christian and heathen,
 repair unto the Round Table; and when they are chosen
 to be of the fellowship of the Round Table they think them
 more blessed and more in worship than if they had gotten
 half the world; and ye have seen that they have lost their
 fathers and their mothers, and all their kin, and their wives
 and their children, for to be of your fellowship.  It is well
 seen by you; for since ye have departed from your mother
 ye would never see her, ye found such fellowship at the
 Round Table.  When Merlin had ordained the Round
 Table he said, by them which should be fellows of the
 Round Table the truth of the Sangreal should be well
 known.  And men asked him how men might know them
 that should best do and to enchieve the Sangreal?  Then
 he said there should be three white bulls that should enchieve
 it, and the two should be maidens, and the third should be
 chaste.  And that one of the three should pass his father
 as much as the lion passeth the leopard, both of strength
 and hardiness.
 
 They that heard Merlin say so said thus unto Merlin:
 Sithen there shall be such a knight, thou shouldest ordain
 by thy crafts a siege, that no man should sit in it but he
 all only that shall pass all other knights.  Then Merlin
 answered that he would do so.  And then he made the
 Siege Perilous, in the which Galahad sat in at his meat on
 Whitsunday last past.  Now, madam, said Sir Percivale,
 so much have I heard of you that by my good will I will
 never have ado with Sir Galahad but by way of kindness;
 and for God's love, fair aunt, can ye teach me some way
 where I may find him? for much would I love the fellowship
 of him.  Fair nephew, said she, ye must ride unto a
 castle the which is called Goothe, where he hath a cousin-
 germain, and there may ye be lodged this night.  And as
 he teacheth you, seweth after as fast as ye can; and if he
 can tell you no tidings of him, ride straight unto the Castle
 of Carbonek, where the maimed king is there lying, for
 there shall ye hear true tidings of him.
