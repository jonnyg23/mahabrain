 CHAPTER VII
 
 How for the despite of Sir Tristram King Mark came with
 two knights into England, and how he slew one of the
 knights.
 
 
 THEN King Mark had great despite of the renown of Sir
 Tristram, and then he chased him out of Cornwall: yet
 was he nephew unto King Mark, but he had great suspicion
 unto Sir Tristram because of his queen, La Beale Isoud;
 for him seemed that there was too much love between
 them both.  So when Sir Tristram departed out of Cornwall
 into England King Mark heard of the great prowess that
 Sir Tristram did there, the which grieved him sore.  So
 he sent on his part men to espy what deeds he did.  And
 the queen sent privily on her part spies to know what
 deeds he had done, for great love was between them twain.
 So when the messengers were come home they told the
 truth as they had heard, that he passed all other knights
 but if it were Sir Launcelot.  Then King Mark was right
 heavy of these tidings, and as glad was La Beale Isoud.
 Then in great despite he took with him two good knights
 and two squires, and disguised himself, and took his way
 into England, to the intent for to slay Sir Tristram.
 And one of these two knights hight Bersules, and the
 other knight was called Amant.  So as they rode King
 Mark asked a knight that he met, where he should find
 King Arthur.  He said:  At Camelot.  Also he asked that
 knight after Sir Tristram, whether he heard of him in the
 court of King Arthur.  Wit you well, said that knight,
 ye shall find Sir Tristram there for a man of as great
 worship as is now living; for through his prowess he won
 the tournament of the Castle of Maidens that standeth by
 the Hard Rock.  And sithen he hath won with his own
 hands thirty knights that were men of great honour.
 And the last battle that ever he did he fought with Sir
 Launcelot; and that was a marvellous battle.  And not
 by force Sir Launcelot brought Sir Tristram to the court,
 and of him King Arthur made passing great joy, and so
 made him Knight of the Table Round; and his seat was
 where the good knight's, Sir Marhaus, seat was.  Then
 was King Mark passing sorry when he heard of the honour
 of Sir Tristram; and so they departed.
 
 Then said King Mark unto his two knights:  Now
 will I tell you my counsel: ye are the men that I trust
 most to alive, and I will that ye wit my coming hither is
 to this intent, for to destroy Sir Tristram by wiles or by
 treason; and it shall be hard if ever he escape our hands.
 Alas, said Sir Bersules, what mean you? for ye be set in
 such a way ye are disposed shamefully; for Sir Tristram
 is the knight of most worship that we know living, and
 therefore I warn you plainly I will never consent to do
 him to the death; and therefore I will yield my service,
 and forsake you.  When King Mark heard him say so,
 suddenly he drew his sword and said:  Ah, traitor; and
 smote Sir Bersules on the head, that the sword went to
 his teeth.  When Amant, the knight, saw him do that
 villainous deed, and his squires, they said it was foul done,
 and mischievously:  Wherefore we will do thee no more
 service, and wit ye well, we will appeach thee of treason
 afore Arthur.  Then was King Mark wonderly wroth
 and would have slain Amant; but he and the two squires
 held them together, and set nought by his malice.  When
 King Mark saw he might not be revenged on them, he
 said thus unto the knight, Amant:  Wit thou well, an
 thou appeach me of treason I shall thereof defend me
 afore King Arthur; but I require thee that thou tell not
 my name, that I am King Mark, whatsomever come of
 me.  As for that, said Sir Amant, I will not discover your
 name; and so they departed, and Amant and his fellows
 took the body of Bersules and buried it.
