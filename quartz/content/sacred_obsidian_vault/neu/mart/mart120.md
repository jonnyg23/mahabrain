 CHAPTER II
 
 How Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine were wroth because
 Sir Kay mocked Beaumains, and of a damosel which
 desired a knight to fight for a lady.
 
 THEREAT was Sir Gawaine wroth, and in especial Sir Launcelot bade
 Sir Kay leave his mocking, for I dare lay my head he shall prove
 a man of great worship.  Let be said Sir Kay, it may not be by no
 reason, for as he is, so he hath asked.  Beware, said Sir
 Launcelot, so ye gave the good knight Brewnor, Sir Dinadan's
 brother, a name, and ye called him La Cote Male Taile, and that
 turned you to anger afterward.  As for that, said Sir Kay, this
 shall never prove none such.  For Sir Brewnor desired ever
 worship, and this desireth bread and drink and broth; upon pain
 of my life he was fostered up in some abbey, and, howsomever it
 was, they failed meat and drink, and so hither he is come for his
 sustenance.
 
 And so Sir Kay bade get him a place, and sit down to meat; so
 Beaumains went to the hall door, and set him down among boys and
 lads, and there he ate sadly.  And then Sir Launcelot after meat
 bade him come to his chamber, and there he should have meat and
 drink enough.  And so did Sir Gawaine: but he refused them all;
 he would do none other but as Sir Kay commanded him, for no
 proffer.  But as touching Sir Gawaine, he had reason to
 &lt;212&gt;proffer him lodging, meat, and drink, for that proffer came
 of his blood, for he was nearer kin to him than he wist.  But
 that as Sir Launcelot did was of his great gentleness and
 courtesy.
 
 So thus he was put into the kitchen, and lay nightly as the boys
 of the kitchen did.  And so he endured all that twelvemonth, and
 never displeased man nor child, but always he was meek and mild. 
 But ever when that he saw any jousting of knights, that would he
 see an he might.  And ever Sir Launcelot would give him gold to
 spend, and clothes, and so did Sir Gawaine, and where there were
 any masteries done, thereat would he be, and there might none
 cast bar nor stone to him by two yards.  Then would Sir Kay say,
 How liketh you my boy of the kitchen?  So it passed on till the
 feast of Whitsuntide.  And at that time the king held it at
 Carlion in the most royallest wise that might be, like as he did
 yearly.  But the king would no meat eat upon the Whitsunday,
 until he heard some adventures.  Then came there a squire to the
 king and said, Sir, ye may go to your meat, for here cometh a
 damosel with some strange adventures.  Then was the king glad and
 sat him down.
 
 Right so there came a damosel into the hall and saluted the king,
 and prayed him of succour.  For whom? said the king, what is the
 adventure?
 
 Sir, she said, I have a lady of great worship and renown, and she
 is besieged with a tyrant, so that she may not out of her castle;
 and because here are called the noblest knights of the world, I
 come to you to pray you of succour.  What hight your lady, and
 where dwelleth she, and who is she, and what is his name that
 hath besieged her?  Sir king, she said, as for my lady's name
 that shall not ye know for me as at this time, but I let you wit
 she is a lady of great worship and of great lands; and as for the
 tyrant that besiegeth her and destroyeth her lands, he is called
 the Red Knight of the Red Launds.  I know him not, said the king. 
 Sir, said Sir Gawaine, I know him well, for he is one of the
 perilloust knights of the world; men say that he hath seven men's
 strength, &lt;213&gt;and from him I escaped once full hard with my
 life.  Fair damosel, said the king, there be knights here would
 do their power for to rescue your lady, but because you will not
 tell her name, nor where she dwelleth, therefore none of my
 knights that here be now shall go with you by my will.  Then must
 I speak further, said the damosel.
