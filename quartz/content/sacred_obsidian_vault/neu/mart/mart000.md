 CHAPTER I
 
 How Uther Pendragon sent for the duke of Cornwall and
 Igraine his wife, and of their departing suddenly again.
 
 IT befell in the days of Uther Pendragon, when he was king of all
 England, and so reigned, that there was a mighty duke in Cornwall
 that held war against him long time.  And the duke was called the
 Duke of Tintagil.  And so by means King Uther sent for this duke,
 charging him to bring his wife with him, for she was called a
 fair lady, and a passing wise, and her name was called Igraine.
 
 So when the duke and his wife were come unto the king, by the
 means of great lords they were accorded both.  The king liked and
 loved this lady well, and he made them great cheer out of
 measure, and desired to have lain by her.  But she was a passing
 good woman, and would not assent unto the king.  And then she
 told the duke her husband, and said, I suppose that we were sent
 for that I should be dishonoured; wherefore, husband, I counsel
 you, that we depart from hence suddenly, that we may ride all
 night unto our own castle.  And in like wise as she said so they
 departed, that neither the king nor none of his council were ware
 of their departing.  All so soon as King Uther knew of their
 departing so suddenly, he was wonderly wroth.  Then he called to
 him his privy council, and told them of the sudden departing of
 the duke and his wife.
 
 &lt;2&gt;
 Then they advised the king to send for the duke and his wife by a
 great charge; and if he will not come at your summons, then may
 ye do your best, then have ye cause to make mighty war upon him. 
 So that was done, and the messengers had their answers; and that
 was this shortly, that neither he nor his wife would not come at
 him.
 
 Then was the king wonderly wroth.  And then the king sent him
 plain word again, and bade him be ready and stuff him and garnish
 him, for within forty days he would fetch him out of the biggest
 castle that he hath.
 
 When the duke had this warning, anon he went and furnished and
 garnished two strong castles of his, of the which the one hight
 Tintagil, and the other castle hight Terrabil.  So his wife Dame
 Igraine he put in the castle of Tintagil, and himself he put in
 the castle of Terrabil, the which had many issues and posterns
 out.  Then in all haste came Uther with a great host, and laid a
 siege about the castle of Terrabil.  And there he pight many
 pavilions, and there was great war made on both parties, and much
 people slain.  Then for pure anger and for great love of fair
 Igraine the king Uther fell sick.  So came to the king Uther Sir
 Ulfius, a noble knight, and asked the king why he was sick.  I
 shall tell thee, said the king, I am sick for anger and for love
 of fair Igraine, that I may not be whole.  Well, my lord, said
 Sir Ulfius, I shall seek Merlin, and he shall do you remedy, that
 your heart shall be pleased.  So Ulfius departed, and by
 adventure he met Merlin in a beggar's array, and there Merlin
 asked Ulfius whom he sought.  And he said he had little ado to
 tell him.  Well, said Merlin, I know whom thou seekest, for thou
 seekest Merlin; therefore seek no farther, for I am he; and if
 King Uther will well reward me, and be sworn unto me to fulfil my
 desire, that shall be his honour and profit more than mine; for I
 shall cause him to have all his desire.  All this will I
 undertake, said Ulfius, that there shall be nothing reasonable
 but thou shalt have thy desire.  Well, said Merlin, he shall have
 his intent and desire.  And therefore, said Merlin, ride on your
 way, for I will not be long behind.
