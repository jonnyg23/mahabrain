 CHAPTER XXXIII
 
 How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palomides, and how he
 jousted with King Arthur, and other feats.
 
 SO the King of Northgalis and the King with the Hundred Knights,
 they two encountered with King Carados and with the King of
 Ireland; and there the King with the Hundred Knights smote down
 King Carados, and the King of Northgalis smote down the King of
 Ireland.  With that came in Sir Palomides, and when he came he
 made great work, for by his indented &lt;410&gt;shield he was well
 known.  So came in King Arthur, and did great deeds of arms
 together, and put the King of Northgalis and the King with the
 Hundred Knights to the worse.  With this came in Sir Tristram
 with his black shield, and anon he jousted with Sir Palomides,
 and there by fine force Sir Tristram smote Sir Palomides over his
 horse's croup.  Then King Arthur cried:  Knight with the Black
 Shield, make thee ready to me, and in the same wise Sir Tristram
 smote King Arthur.  And then by force of King Arthur's knights
 the King and Sir Palomides were horsed again.  Then King Arthur
 with a great eager heart he gat a spear in his hand, and there
 upon the one side he smote Sir Tristram over his horse.  Then
 foot-hot Sir Palomides came upon Sir Tristram, as he was upon
 foot, to have overridden him.  Then Sir Tristram was ware of him,
 and there he stooped aside, and with great ire he gat him by the
 arm, and pulled him down from his horse.  Then Sir Palomides
 lightly arose, and then they dashed together mightily with their
 swords; and many kings, queens, and lords, stood and beheld them. 
 And at the last Sir Tristram smote Sir Palomides upon the helm
 three mighty strokes, and at every stroke that he gave him he
 said:  This for Sir Tristram's sake.  With that Sir Palomides
 fell to the earth grovelling.
 
 Then came the King with the Hundred Knights, and brought Sir
 Tristram an horse, and so was he horsed again.  By then was Sir
 Palomides horsed, and with great ire he jousted upon Sir Tristram
 with his spear as it was in the rest, and gave him a great dash
 with his sword.  Then Sir Tristram avoided his spear, and gat him
 by the neck with his both hands, and pulled him clean out of his
 saddle, and so he bare him afore him the length of ten spears,
 and then in the presence of them all he let him fall at his
 adventure.  Then Sir Tristram was ware of King Arthur with a
 naked sword in his hand, and with his spear Sir Tristram ran upon
 King Arthur; and then King Arthur boldly abode him and with his
 sword he smote a-two his spear, and therewithal Sir Tristram
 stonied; and so King Arthur gave him three or four &lt;411&gt;strokes
 or he might get out his sword, and at the last Sir Tristram drew
 his sword and [either] assailed other passing hard.  With that
 the great press departed [them].  Then Sir Tristram rode here and
 there and did his great pain, that eleven of the good knights of
 the blood of King Ban, that was of Sir Launcelot's kin, that day
 Sir Tristram smote down; that all the estates marvelled of his
 great deeds and all cried upon the Knight with the Black Shield.
