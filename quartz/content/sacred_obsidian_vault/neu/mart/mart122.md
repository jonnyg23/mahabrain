 CHAPTER IV
 
 How Beaumains departed, and how he gat of Sir Kay a
 spear and a shield, and how he jousted with Sir Launcelot.
 
 BUT there went many after to behold how well he was horsed and
 trapped in cloth of gold, but he had neither shield nor spear. 
 Then Sir Kay said all open in the hall, I will ride after my boy
 in the kitchen, to wit whether he will know me for his better. 
 Said Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine, Yet abide at home.  So Sir
 Kay made him ready and took his horse and his spear, and rode
 after him.  And right as Beaumains overtook the damosel, right so
 came Sir Kay and said, Beaumains, what, sir, know ye not me? 
 Then he turned his horse, and knew it was Sir Kay, that had done
 him all the despite as ye have heard afore.  Yea, said Beaumains,
 I know you for an ungentle knight of the court, and therefore
 beware of me.  Therewith Sir Kay put his spear in the rest, and
 ran straight upon him; and Beaumains came as fast upon him with
 his sword in his hand, and so he put away his spear with his
 sword, and with a foin thrust him through the side, that Sir Kay
 fell down as he had been dead; and he alighted down and took Sir
 Kay's shield and his spear, and stert upon his own horse and rode
 his way.
 
 All that saw Sir Launcelot, and so did the damosel.  And then he
 bade his dwarf stert upon Sir Kay's horse, and so he did.  By
 that Sir Launcelot was come, then he proffered Sir Launcelot to
 joust; and either made them ready, and they came together so
 fiercely that either bare down other to the earth, and sore were
 they bruised.  Then Sir Launcelot arose and helped him from his
 horse.  And then Beaumains threw his shield from him, and
 proffered to fight with Sir Launcelot on foot; and so they rushed
 together like boars, tracing, rasing, and foining to the
 mountenance of an hour; and Sir Launcelot felt him &lt;215&gt;so big
 that he marvelled of his strength, for he fought more liker a
 giant than a knight, and that his fighting was durable and
 passing perilous.  For Sir Launcelot had so much ado with him
 that he dreaded himself to be shamed, and said, Beaumains, fight
 not so sore, your quarrel and mine is not so great but we may
 leave off.  Truly that is truth, said Beaumains, but it doth me
 good to feel your might, and yet, my lord, I showed not the
 utterance.
