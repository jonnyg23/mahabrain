 CHAPTER VIII
 
 How when Sir Lancelot heard of the death of King
 Arthur, and of Sir Gawaine, and other matters, he
 came into England
 
 
 AND when he heard in his country that Sir Mordred was
 crowned king in England, and made war against King
 Arthur, his own father, and would let him to land in his
 own land; also it was told Sir Launcelot how that Sir Mordred
 had laid siege about the Tower of London, because the
 queen would not wed him; then was Sir Launcelot wroth
 out of measure, and said to his kinsmen:  Alas, that
 double traitor Sir Mordred, now me repenteth that ever he
 escaped my hands, for much shame hath he done unto my
 lord Arthur; for all I feel by the doleful letter that my
 lord Sir Gawaine sent me, on whose soul Jesu have mercy
 that my lord Arthur is full hard bestead.  Alas, said Sir
 Launcelot, that ever I should live to hear that most noble
 king that made me knight thus to be overset with his subject
 in his own realm.  And this doleful letter that my
 lord, Sir Gawaine, hath sent me afore his death, praying
 me to see his tomb, wit you well his doleful words shall
 never go from mine heart, for he was a full noble knight
 as ever was born; and in an unhappy hour was I born
 that ever I should have that unhap to slay first Sir
 Gawaine, Sir Gaheris the good knight, and mine own
 friend Sir Gareth, that full noble knight.  Alas, I may
 say I am unhappy, said Sir Launcelot, that ever I should
 do thus unhappily, and, alas, yet might I never have hap
 to slay that traitor, Sir Mordred.
 
 Leave your complaints, said Sir Bors, and first revenge
 you of the death of Sir Gawaine; and it will be well done
 that ye see Sir Gawaine's tomb, and secondly that ye
 revenge my lord Arthur, and my lady, Queen Guenever
 I thank you, said Sir Launcelot, for ever ye will my
 worship.
 
 Then they made them ready in all the haste that
 might be, with ships and galleys, with Sir Launcelot and
 his host to pass into England.  And so he passed over
 the sea till he came to Dover, and there he landed with
 seven kings, and the number was hideous to behold.
 Then Sir Launcelot spered of men of Dover where was
 King Arthur become.  Then the people told him how
 that he was slain, and Sir Mordred and an hundred thousand
 died on a day; and how Sir Mordred gave King
 Arthur there the first battle at his landing, and there was
 good Sir Gawaine slain; and on the morn Sir Mordred
 fought with the king upon Barham Down, and there the
 king put Sir Mordred to the worse.  Alas, said Sir
 Launcelot, this is the heaviest tidings that ever came to
 me.  Now, fair sirs, said Sir Launcelot, shew me the
 tomb of Sir Gawaine.  And then certain people of the
 town brought him into the castle of Dover, and shewed
 him the tomb.  Then Sir Launcelot kneeled down and
 wept, and prayed heartily for his soul.  And that night he
 made a dole, and all they that would come had as much
 flesh, fish, wine and ale, and every man and woman had
 twelve pence, come who would.  Thus with his own hand
 dealt he this money, in a mourning gown; and ever he
 wept, and prayed them to pray for the soul of Sir
 Gawaine.  And on the morn all the priests and clerks that
 might be gotten in the country were there, and sang mass
 of Requiem; and there offered first Sir Launcelot, and he
 offered an hundred pound; and then the seven kings
 offered forty pound apiece; and also there was a thousand
 knights, and each of them offered a pound; and the
 offering dured from morn till night, and Sir Launcelot lay
 two nights on his tomb in prayers and weeping.
 
 Then on the third day Sir Launcelot called the kings,
 dukes, earls, barons, and knights, and said thus:  My fair
 lords, I thank you all of your coming into this country
 with me, but we came too late, and that shall repent me
 while I live, but against death may no man rebel.  But
 sithen it is so, said Sir Launcelot, I will myself ride and
 seek my lady, Queen Guenever, for as I hear say she hath
 had great pain and much disease; and I heard say that
 she is fled into the west.  Therefore ye all shall abide me
 here, and but if I come again within fifteen days, then
 take your ships and your fellowship, and depart into your
 country, for I will do as I say to you.
