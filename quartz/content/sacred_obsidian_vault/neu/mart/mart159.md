 CHAPTER VI
 
 How Sir Tristram arrived into the Island for to furnish the
 battle with Sir Marhaus.
 
 SO to shorten this tale, when Sir Tristram was arrived within the
 island he looked to the farther side, and there he saw at an
 anchor six ships nigh to the land; and under the shadow of the
 ships upon the land, there hoved the noble knight, Sir Marhaus of
 Ireland.  Then Sir Tristram commanded his servant Gouvernail to
 bring his horse to the land, and dress his harness at all manner
 of rights.  And then when he had so done he mounted upon his
 horse; and when he was in his saddle well apparelled, and his
 shield dressed upon his shoulder, Tristram asked Gouvernail,
 Where is this knight that I shall have ado withal?  Sir, said
 Gouvernail, see ye him not?  I weened ye had seen him; yonder he
 hoveth under the umbre of his ships on horseback, with his spear
 in his hand and his shield upon his shoulder.  That is truth,
 said the noble knight, Sir Tristram, now I see him well enough.
 
 Then he commanded his servant Gouvernail to go to his vessel
 again:  And commend me unto mine eme King Mark, and pray him, if
 that I be slain in this battle, for to inter my body as him
 seemed best; and as for me, let him wit that I will never yield
 me for cowardice; and if I be slain and flee not, then they have
 lost no truage for &lt;288&gt;me; and if so be that I flee or yield me
 as recreant, bid mine eme never bury me in Christian burials. 
 And upon thy life, said Sir Tristram to Gouvernail, come thou not
 nigh this island till that thou see me overcome or slain, or else
 that I win yonder knight.  So either departed from other sore
 weeping.
