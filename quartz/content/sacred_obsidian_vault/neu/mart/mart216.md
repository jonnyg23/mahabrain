 CHAPTER XXIII
 
 How a damosel sought help to help Sir Launcelot against
 thirty knights, and how Sir Tristram fought with them.
 
 AND at the next landing, fast by the sea, there met with Sir
 Tristram and with Sir Dinadan, Sir Ector de Maris and Sir Bors de
 Ganis; and there Sir Ector jousted with Sir Dinadan, and he smote
 him and his horse down.  And then Sir Tristram would have jousted
 with Sir Bors, and Sir Bors said that he would not joust with no
 Cornish knights, for they are not called men of worship; and all
 this was done upon a bridge.  And with this came Sir Bleoberis
 and Sir Driant, and Sir Bleoberis proffered to joust with Sir
 Tristram, and there Sir Tristram smote down Sir Bleoberis.  Then
 said Sir Bors de Ganis:  I wist never Cornish knight of so great
 valour nor so valiant as that knight that beareth the trappings
 embroidered with crowns.  And then Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan
 departed from them into a forest, and there met them a damosel
 that came for the love of Sir Launcelot to seek after some noble
 knights of King Arthur's court for to rescue Sir Launcelot.  And
 so Sir Launcelot was ordained, for-by the treason of Queen Morgan
 le Fay to have slain Sir Launcelot, and for that cause she
 ordained thirty knights to lie in await for Sir Launcelot, and
 this damosel knew this treason.  And for this cause the damosel
 came for to seek noble knights to help Sir Launcelot.  For that
 night, or the day after, Sir Launcelot should come where these
 thirty knights were.  And so this damosel met with Sir Bors and
 Sir Ector and with Sir Driant, and there she told them all four
 of the treason of Morgan le Fay; and then they promised her that
 they would be nigh where Sir Launcelot should meet with the
 thirty knights.  And if so be they set upon him we will do
 rescues as we can.
 
 So the damosel departed, and by adventure the damosel met with
 Sir Tristram and with Sir Dinadan, and there &lt;391&gt;the damosel
 told them all the treason that was ordained for Sir Launcelot. 
 Fair damosel, said Sir Tristram, bring me to that same place
 where they should meet with Sir Launcelot.  Then said Sir
 Dinadan:  What will ye do? it is not for us to fight with thirty
 knights, and wit you well I will not thereof; as to match one
 knight two or three is enough an they be men, but for to match
 fifteen knights that will I never undertake.  Fie for shame, said
 Sir Tristram, do but your part.  Nay, said Sir Dinadan, I will
 not thereof but if ye will lend me your shield, for ye bear a
 shield of Cornwall; and for the cowardice that is named to the
 knights of Cornwall, by your shields ye be ever forborne.  Nay,
 said Sir Tristram, I will not depart from my shield for her sake
 that gave it me.  But one thing, said Sir Tristram, I promise
 thee, Sir Dinadan, but if thou wilt promise me to abide with me,
 here I shall slay thee, for I desire no more of thee but answer
 one knight.  And if thy heart will not serve thee, stand by and
 look upon me and them.  Sir, said Sir Dinadan, I promise you to
 look upon and to do what I may to save myself, but I would I had
 not met with you.
 
 So then anon these thirty knights came fast by these four
 knights, and they were ware of them, and either of other.  And so
 these thirty knights let them pass, for this cause, that they
 would not wrath them, if case be that they had ado with Sir
 Launcelot; and the four knights let them pass to this intent,
 that they would see and behold what they would do with Sir
 Launcelot.  And so the thirty knights passed on and came by Sir
 Tristram and by Sir Dinadan, and then Sir Tristram cried on high: 
 Lo, here is a knight against you for the love of Sir Launcelot. 
 And there he slew two with one spear and ten with his sword.  And
 then came in Sir Dinadan and he did passing well, and so of the
 thirty knights there went but ten away, and they fled.  All this
 battle saw Sir Bors de Ganis and his three fellows, and then they
 saw well it was the same knight that jousted with them at the
 bridge; then they took their horses and rode unto Sir Tristram,
 and praised him and thanked him of his good &lt;392&gt;deeds, and they
 all desired Sir Tristram to go with them to their lodging; and he
 said:  Nay, he would not go to no lodging.  Then they all four
 knights prayed him to tell them his name.  Fair lords, said Sir
 Tristram, as at this time I will not tell you my name.
