 CHAPTER XVI
 
 How Balin was delivered by Merlin, and saved a knight
 that would have slain himself for love.
 
 THEN Merlin came thither and took up Balin, and gat him a good
 horse, for his was dead, and bade him ride out of that country. 
 I would have my damosel, said Balin.  Lo, said Merlin, where she
 lieth dead.  And King Pellam lay so, many years sore wounded, and
 might never be whole till Galahad the haut prince healed him in
 the quest of the Sangreal, for in that place was part of the
 blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, that Joseph of Arimathea brought
 into this land, and there himself lay in that rich bed.  And that
 was the same spear that Longius smote our Lord to the heart; and
 King Pellam was nigh of Joseph's kin, and that was the most
 worshipful man that lived in those days, and great pity it was of
 his hurt, for through that stroke, turned to great dole, tray and
 tene.  Then departed Balin from Merlin, and said, In this world
 we meet never no more.  So he rode forth through the fair
 countries and cities, and found the people dead, slain on every
 side.  And all that were alive cried, O Balin, thou hast caused
 great damage in these countries; for the dolorous stroke thou
 gavest unto King Pellam three countries are destroyed, and doubt
 not but the vengeance will fall on thee at the last.  When Balin
 was past those countries he was passing fain.
 
 So he rode eight days or he met with adventure.  And at the last
 he came into a fair forest in a valley, and was ware of a tower,
 and there beside he saw a great horse of war, tied to a tree, and
 there beside sat a fair knight on the ground and made great
 mourning, and he was a likely &lt;72&gt;man, and a well made.  Balin
 said, God save you, why be ye so heavy? tell me and I will amend
 it, an I may, to my power.  Sir knight, said he again, thou dost
 me great grief, for I was in merry thoughts, and now thou puttest
 me to more pain.  Balin went a little from him, and looked on his
 horse; then heard Balin him say thus:  Ah, fair lady, why have ye
 broken my promise, for thou promisest me to meet me here by noon,
 and I may curse thee that ever ye gave me this sword, for with
 this sword I slay myself, and pulled it out.  And therewith Balin
 stert unto him and took him by the hand.  Let go my hand, said
 the knight, or else I shall slay thee.  That shall not need, said
 Balin, for I shall promise you my help to get you your lady, an
 ye will tell me where she is.  What is your name? said the
 knight.  My name is Balin le Savage.  Ah, sir, I know you well
 enough, ye are the Knight with the Two Swords, and the man of
 most prowess of your hands living.  What is your name? said
 Balin.  My name is Garnish of the Mount, a poor man's son, but by
 my prowess and hardiness a duke hath made me knight, and gave me
 lands; his name is Duke Hermel, and his daughter is she that I
 love, and she me as I deemed.  How far is she hence? said Balin. 
 But six mile, said the knight.  Now ride we hence, said these two
 knights.  So they rode more than a pace, till that they came to a
 fair castle well walled and ditched.  I will into the castle,
 said Balin, and look if she be there.  So he went in and searched
 from chamber to chamber, and found her bed, but she was not
 there.  Then Balin looked into a fair little garden, and under a
 laurel tree he saw her lie upon a quilt of green samite and a
 knight in her arms, fast halsing either other, and under their
 heads grass and herbs.  When Balin saw her lie so with the
 foulest knight that ever he saw, and she a fair lady, then Balin
 went through all the chambers again, and told the knight how he
 found her as she had slept fast, and so brought him in the place
 there she lay fast sleeping.
