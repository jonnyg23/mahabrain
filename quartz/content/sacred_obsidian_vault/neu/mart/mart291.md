 CHAPTER LIV
 
 Of Sir Palomides, and how he met with Sir Bleoberis
 and with Sir Ector, and of Sir Pervivale.
 
 
 RIGHT so as they stood thus there came Sir Palomides, and
 when he saw the shield of Bleoberis lie on the earth, then
 said Palomides:  He that oweth that shield let him dress
 him to me, for he smote me down here fast by at a fountain,
 and therefore I will fight for him on foot.  I am ready,
 said Bleoberis, here to answer thee, for wit thou well, sir
 knight, it was I, and my name is Bleoberis de Ganis.
 Well art thou met, said Palomides, and wit thou well my
 name is Palomides the Saracen; and either of them hated
 other to the death.  Sir Palomides, said Ector, wit thou
 well there is neither thou nor none knight that beareth the
 life that slayeth any of our blood but he shall die for it;
 therefore an thou list to fight go seek Sir Launcelot or Sir
 Tristram, and there shall ye find your match.  With them
 have I met, said Palomides, but I had never no worship of
 them.  Was there never no manner of knight, said Sir
 Ector, but they that ever matched with you?  Yes, said
 Palomides, there was the third, a good knight as any of
 them, and of his age he was the best that ever I found;
 for an he might have lived till he had been an hardier man
 there liveth no knight now such, and his name was Sir
 Lamorak de Galis.  And as he had jousted at a tournament
 there he overthrew me and thirty knights more, and
 there he won the degree.  And at his departing there met
 him Sir Gawaine and his brethren, and with great pain they
 slew him feloniously, unto all good knights' great damage.
 Anon as Sir Percivale heard that his brother was dead, Sir
 Lamorak, he fell over his horse's mane swooning, and there
 he made the greatest dole that ever made knight.  And
 when Sir Percivale arose he said:  Alas, my good and noble
 brother Sir Lamorak, now shall we never meet, and I trow
 in all the wide world a man may not find such a knight as
 he was of his age; and it is too much to suffer the death
 of our father King Pellinore, and now the death of our
 good brother Sir Lamorak.
 
 Then in the meanwhile there came a varlet from the
 court of King Arthur, and told them of the great tournament
 that should be at Lonazep, and how these lands,
 Cornwall and Northgalis, should be against all them that
 would come.
