 CHAPTER XII
 
 How the cousins and kinsmen of Sir Launcelot excited him
 to go out to battle, and how they made them ready
 
 
 WELL, well, said Sir Gawaine to Launcelot, sithen thou
 enbraidest me of Sir Lamorak, wit thou well I shall never
 leave thee till I have thee at such avail that thou shalt not
 escape my hands.  I trust you well enough, said Sir
 Launcelot, an ye may get me I get but little mercy.  But
 as the French book saith, the noble King Arthur would
 have taken his queen again, and have been accorded with
 Sir Launcelot, but Sir Gawaine would not suffer him by no
 manner of mean.  And then Sir Gawaine made many men
 to blow upon Sir Launcelot; and all at once they called
 him false recreant knight.
 
 Then when Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Ector de Maris, and
 Sir Lionel, heard this outcry, they called to them Sir
 Palomides, Sir Safere's brother, and Sir Lavaine, with many
 more of their blood, and all they went unto Sir Launcelot,
 and said thus:  My lord Sir Launcelot, wit ye well we have
 great scorn of the great rebukes that we heard Gawaine
 say to you; wherefore we pray you, and charge you as ye
 will have our service, keep us no longer within these walls;
 for wit you well plainly, we will ride into the field and do
 battle with them; for ye fare as a man that were afeard,
 and for all your fair speech it will not avail you.  For wit
 you well Sir Gawaine will not suffer you to be accorded
 with King Arthur, and therefore fight for your life and
 your right, an ye dare.  Alas, said Sir Launcelot, for to
 ride out of this castle, and to do battle, I am full loath.
 
 Then Sir Launcelot spake on high unto Sir Arthur and
 Sir Gawaine:  My lords, I require you and beseech you,
 sithen that I am thus required and conjured to ride into
 the field, that neither you, my lord King Arthur, nor you
 Sir Gawaine, come not into the field.  What shall we do
 then? said Sir Gawaine, [N]is this the king's quarrel with
 thee to fight? and it is my quarrel to fight with thee, Sir
 Launcelot, because of the death of my brother Sir Gareth.
 Then must I needs unto battle, said Sir Launcelot.  Now
 wit you well, my lord Arthur and Sir Gawaine, ye will
 repent it whensomever I do battle with you.
 
 And so then they departed either from other; and then
 either party made them ready on the morn for to do battle,
 and great purveyance was made on both sides; and Sir
 Gawaine let purvey many knights for to wait upon Sir
 Launcelot, for to overset him and to slay him.  And on
 the morn at underne Sir Arthur was ready in the field with
 three great hosts.  And then Sir Launcelot's fellowship
 came out at three gates, in a full good array; and Sir Lionel
 came in the foremost battle, and Sir Launcelot came in the
 middle, and Sir Bors came out at the third gate.  Thus
 they came in order and rule, as full noble knights; and
 always Sir Launcelot charged all his knights in any wise to
 save King Arthur and Sir Gawaine.
