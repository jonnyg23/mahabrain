 CHAPTER XVI
 
 How Sir launcelot had lain four-and-twenty days and as
 many nights as a dead man, and other divers matters.
 
 
 IN such manner they kept Launcelot four-and-twenty
 days and all so many nights, that ever he lay still as a
 dead man; and at the twenty-fifth day befell him after
 midday that he opened his eyes.  And when he saw folk
 he made great sorrow, and said:  Why have ye awaked
 me, for I was more at ease than I am now.  O Jesu
 Christ, who might be so blessed that might see openly
 thy great marvels of secretness there where no sinner may
 be!  What have ye seen? said they about him.  I
 have seen, said he, so great marvels that no tongue may
 tell, and more than any heart can think, and had not my
 son been here afore me I had seen much more.
 
 Then they told him how he had lain there four-and-twenty
 days and nights.  Then him thought it was
 punishment for the four-and-twenty years that he had
 been a sinner, wherefore Our Lord put him in penance
 four-and-twenty days and nights.  Then looked Sir
 Launcelot afore him, and saw the hair which he had
 borne nigh a year, for that he for-thought him right
 much that he had broken his promise unto the hermit,
 which he had avowed to do.  Then they asked how it
 stood with him.  Forsooth, said he, I am whole of body,
 thanked be Our Lord; therefore, sirs, for God's love tell
 me where I am.  Then said they all that he was in the
 castle of Carbonek.
 
 Therewith came a gentlewoman and brought him
 a shirt of small linen cloth, but he changed not there,
 but took the hair to him again.  Sir, said they, the
 quest of the Sangreal is achieved now right in you, that
 never shall ye see of the Sangreal no more than ye have
 seen.  Now I thank God, said Launcelot, of His great
 mercy of that I have seen, for it sufficeth me; for as I
 suppose no man in this world hath lived better than I
 have done to enchieve that I have done.  And therewith
 he took the hair and clothed him in it, and above that he
 put a linen shirt, and after a robe of scarlet, fresh and
 new.  And when he was so arrayed they marvelled all,
 for they knew him that he was Launcelot, the good
 knight.  And then they said all:  O my lord Sir Launcelot,
 be that ye?  And he said:  Truly I am he.
 
 Then came word to King Pelles that the knight that
 had lain so long dead was Sir Launcelot.  Then was the
 king right glad, and went to see him.  And when Launcelot
 saw him come he dressed him against him, and there
 made the king great joy of him.  And there the king
 told him tidings that his fair daughter was dead.  Then
 Launcelot was right heavy of it, and said:  Sir, me
 forthinketh the death of your daughter, for she was a full
 fair lady, fresh and young.  And well I wot she bare the
 best knight that is now on the earth, or that ever was sith
 God was born.  So the king held him there four days,
 and on the morrow he took his leave at King Pelles
 and at all the fellowship, and thanked them of their great
 labour.
 
 Right so as they sat at their dinner in the chief salle,
 then was so befallen that the Sangreal had fulfilled the table
 with all manner of meats that any heart might think.  So
 as they sat they saw all the doors and the windows of the
 place were shut without man's hand, whereof they were
 all abashed, and none wist what to do.
 
 And then it happed suddenly a knight came to the
 chief door and knocked, and cried:  Undo the door.  But
 they would not.  And ever he cried:  Undo; but they
 would not.  And at last it noyed them so much that
 the king himself arose and came to a window there where
 the knight called.  Then he said:  Sir knight, ye shall
 not enter at this time while the Sangreal is here, and
 therefore go into another; for certes ye be none of the
 knights of the quest, but one of them which hath served
 the fiend, and hast left the service of Our Lord: and he
 was passing wroth at the king's words.  Sir knight, said
 the king, sith ye would so fain enter, say me of what
 country ye be.  Sir, said he, I am of the realm of Logris,
 and my name is Ector de Maris, and brother unto my
 lord, Sir Launcelot.  In the name of God, said the king,
 me for-thinketh of what I have said, for your brother is
 here within.  And when Ector de Maris understood that
 his brother was there, for he was the man in the world
 that he most dread and loved, and then he said:  Ah God,
 now doubleth my sorrow and shame.  Full truly said the
 good man of the hill unto Gawaine and to me of our
 dreams.  Then went he out of the court as fast as his
 horse might, and so throughout the castle.
