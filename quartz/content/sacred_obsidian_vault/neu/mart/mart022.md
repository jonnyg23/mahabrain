 CHAPTER XXIII
 
 How twelve knights came from Rome and asked truage for this land
 of Arthur, and how Arthur fought with a knight.
 
 WHEN the knight saw him lie so on the ground, he alighted, and
 was passing heavy, for he weened he had slain him, and then he
 unlaced his helm and gat him wind, and so with the truncheon he
 set him on his horse, and so betook him to God, and said he had a
 mighty heart, and if he might live he would prove a passing good
 knight.  And so Sir Griflet rode to the court, where great dole
 was made for him.  But through good leeches he was healed and
 saved.  Right so came into the court twelve knights, and were
 aged men, and they came from the Emperor of Rome, and they asked
 of Arthur truage for this realm, other else the emperor would
 destroy him and his land.  Well, said King Arthur, ye are
 messengers, therefore ye may say what ye will, other else ye
 should die therefore.  But this is mine answer: I owe the emperor
 no truage, nor none will I hold him, but on a fair field I shall
 give him my truage that shall be with a sharp spear, or else with
 a sharp sword, and that shall not be long, by my father's soul,
 Uther Pendragon.  And therewith the messengers departed passingly
 wroth, and King Arthur as wroth, for in evil time came they then;
 for the king was passingly wroth for the hurt of Sir Griflet. 
 And so he commanded a privy man of his chamber that or it be day
 his best horse and armour, with all that longeth unto his person,
 be without the city or to-morrow day.  Right so or to-morrow day
 he met with his man and his horse, and so mounted up and
 &lt;42&gt;dressed his shield and took his spear, and bade his
 chamberlain tarry there till he came again.  And so Arthur rode a
 soft pace till it was day, and then was he ware of three churls
 chasing Merlin, and would have slain him.  Then the king rode
 unto them, and bade them:  Flee, churls! then were they afeard
 when they saw a knight, and fled.  O Merlin, said Arthur, here
 hadst thou been slain for all thy crafts had I not been.  Nay,
 said Merlin, not so, for I could save myself an I would; and thou
 art more near thy death than I am, for thou goest to the
 deathward, an God be not thy friend.
 
 So as they went thus talking they came to the fountain, and the
 rich pavilion there by it.  Then King Arthur was ware where sat a
 knight armed in a chair.  Sir knight, said Arthur, for what cause
 abidest thou here, that there may no knight ride this way but if
 he joust with thee? said the king.  I rede thee leave that
 custom, said Arthur.  This custom, said the knight, have I used
 and will use maugre who saith nay, and who is grieved with my
 custom let him amend it that will.  I will amend it, said Arthur. 
 I shall defend thee, said the knight.  Anon he took his horse and
 dressed his shield and took a spear, and they met so hard either
 in other's shields, that all to-shivered their spears.  Therewith
 anon Arthur pulled out his sword.  Nay, not so, said the knight;
 it is fairer, said the knight, that we twain run more together
 with sharp spears.  I will well, said Arthur, an I had any more
 spears.  I have enow, said the knight; so there came a squire and
 brought two good spears, and Arthur chose one and he another; so
 they spurred their horses and came together with all their
 mights, that either brake their spears to their hands.  Then
 Arthur set hand on his sword.  Nay, said the knight, ye shall do
 better, ye are a passing good jouster as ever I met withal, and
 once for the love of the high order of knighthood let us joust
 once again.  I assent me, said Arthur.  Anon there were brought
 two great spears, and every knight gat a spear, and therewith
 they ran together that Arthur's spear all to-shivered.  But the
 other knight hit him so hard in midst of the &lt;43&gt;shield, that
 horse and man fell to the earth, and therewith Arthur was eager,
 and pulled out his sword, and said, I will assay thee, sir
 knight, on foot, for I have lost the honour on horseback.  I will
 be on horseback, said the knight.  Then was Arthur wroth, and
 dressed his shield toward him with his sword drawn.  When the
 knight saw that, he alighted, for him thought no worship to have
 a knight at such avail, he to be on horseback and he on foot, and
 so he alighted and dressed his shield unto Arthur.  And there
 began a strong battle with many great strokes, and so hewed with
 their swords that the cantels flew in the fields, and much blood
 they bled both, that all the place there as they fought was
 overbled with blood, and thus they fought long and rested them,
 and then they went to the battle again, and so hurtled together
 like two rams that either fell to the earth.  So at the last they
 smote together that both their swords met even together.  But the
 sword of the knight smote King Arthur's sword in two pieces,
 wherefore he was heavy.  Then said the knight unto Arthur, Thou
 art in my daunger whether me list to save thee or slay thee, and
 but thou yield thee as overcome and recreant, thou shalt die.  As
 for death, said King Arthur, welcome be it when it cometh, but to
 yield me unto thee as recreant I had liefer die than to be so
 shamed.  And therewithal the king leapt unto Pellinore, and took
 him by the middle and threw him down, and raced off his helm. 
 When the knight felt that he was adread, for he was a passing big
 man of might, and anon he brought Arthur under him, and raced off
 his helm and would have smitten off his head.
