 CHAPTER III
 
 How Sir Gawaine and Sir Ector came to an hermitage to be
 confessed, and how they told to the hermit their advisions.
 
 
 ALAS, said Gawaine, that ever this misadventure is befallen
 me.  No force, said Uwaine, sith I shall die this death, of
 a much more worshipfuller man's hand might I not die;
 but when ye come to the court recommend me unto my
 lord, King Arthur, and all those that be left alive, and for
 old brotherhood think on me.  Then began Gawaine to
 weep, and Ector also.  And then Uwaine himself and Sir
 Gawaine drew out the truncheon of the spear, and anon
 departed the soul from the body.  Then Sir Gawaine and
 Sir Ector buried him as men ought to bury a king's son,
 and made write upon his name, and by whom he was
 slain.
 
 Then departed Gawaine and Ector, as heavy as they
 might for their misadventure, and so rode till that they
 came to the rough mountain, and there they tied their
 horses and went on foot to the hermitage.  And when
 they were come up they saw a poor house, and beside
 the chapel a little courtelage, where Nacien the hermit
 gathered worts, as he which had tasted none other meat
 of a great while.  And when he saw the errant knights he
 came toward them and saluted them, and they him again.
 Fair lords, said he, what adventure brought you hither?
 Sir, said Gawaine, to speak with you for to be confessed.
 Sir, said the hermit, I am ready.  Then they told him so
 much that he wist well what they were.  And then he
 thought to counsel them if he might.
 
 Then began Gawaine first and told him of his advision
 that he had had in the chapel, and Ector told him all as it is
 afore rehearsed.  Sir, said the hermit unto Sir Gawaine, the
 fair meadow and the rack therein ought to be understood the
 Round Table, and by the meadow ought to be understood
 humility and patience, those be the things which be always
 green and quick; for men may no time overcome humility
 and patience, therefore was the Round Table founded,
 and the chivalry hath been at all times so by the fraternity
 which was there that she might not be overcome; for men
 said she was founded in patience and in humility.  At the
 rack ate an hundred and fifty bulls; but they ate not in
 the meadow, for their hearts should be set in humility and
 patience, and the bulls were proud and black save only
 three.  By the bulls is to understand the fellowship of
 the Round Table, which for their sin and their wickedness
 be black.  Blackness is to say without good or virtuous
 works.  And the three bulls which were white save only
 one that was spotted: the two white betoken Sir Galahad
 and Sir Percivale, for they be maidens clean and without
 spot; and the third that had a spot signifieth Sir Bors de
 Ganis, which trespassed but once in his virginity, but
 sithen he kept himself so well in chastity that all is forgiven
 him and his misdeeds.  And why those three were
 tied by the necks, they be three knights in virginity and
 chastity, and there is no pride smitten in them.  And the
 black bulls which said:  Go we hence, they were those
 which at Pentecost at the high feast took upon them to go
 in the quest of the Sangreal without confession: they
 might not enter in the meadow of humility and patience.
 And therefore they returned into waste countries, that
 signifieth death, for there shall die many of them: everych
 of them shall slay other for sin, and they that shall
 escape shall be so lean that it shall be marvel to see them.
 And of the three bulls without spot, the one shall come
 again, and the other two never.
