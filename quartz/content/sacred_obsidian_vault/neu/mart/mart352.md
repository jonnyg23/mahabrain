 CHAPTER XIII
 
 How that Sir Tristram gat him harness of a knight which
 was hurt, and how he overthrew Sir Palomides.
 
 
 AS for that, said Sir Palomides, I may not yet be christened
 for one avow that I have made many years agone; howbeit
 in my heart I believe in Jesu Christ and his mild
 mother Mary; but I have but one battle to do, and when
 that is done I will be baptised with a good will.  By my
 head, said Tristram, as for one battle thou shalt not seek
 it no longer.  For God defend, said Sir Tristram, that
 through my default thou shouldst longer live thus a
 Saracen, for yonder is a knight that ye, Sir Palomides,
 have hurt and smitten down.  Now help me that I were
 armed in his armour, and I shall soon fulfil thine avows.
 As ye will, said Palomides, so it shall be.
 
 So they rode both unto that knight that sat upon a
 bank, and then Sir Tristram saluted him, and he weakly
 saluted him again.  Sir knight, said Sir Tristram, I require
 you tell me your right name.  Sir, he said, my name is
 Sir Galleron of Galway, and knight of the Table Round.
 So God me help, said Sir Tristram, I am right heavy of
 your hurts; but this is all, I must pray you to lend me
 all your whole armour, for ye see I am unarmed, and I
 must do battle with this knight.  Sir, said the hurt knight,
 ye shall have it with a good will; but ye must beware,
 for I warn you that knight is wight.  Sir, said Galleron,
 I pray you tell me your name, and what is that knight's
 name that hath beaten me.  Sir, as for my name it is Sir
 Tristram de Liones, and as for the knight's name that
 hath hurt you is Sir Palomides, brother to the good knight
 Sir Safere, and yet is Sir Palomides unchristened.  Alas,
 said Sir Galleron, that is pity that so good a knight and
 so noble a man of arms should be unchristened.  So God
 me help, said Sir Tristram, either he shall slay me or I
 him but that he shall be christened or ever we depart in-
 sunder.  My lord Sir Tristram, said Sir Galleron, your
 renown and worship is well known through many realms,
 and God save you this day from shenship and shame.
 
 Then Sir Tristram unarmed Galleron, the which was
 a noble knight, and had done many deeds of arms, and he
 was a large knight of flesh and bone.  And when he was
 unarmed he stood upon his feet, for he was bruised in the
 back with a spear; yet so as Sir Galleron might, he armed
 Sir Tristram.  And then Sir Tristram mounted upon his
 own horse, and in his hand he gat Sir Galleron's spear;
 and therewithal Sir Palomides was ready.  And so they
 came hurtling together, and either smote other in midst
 of their shields; and therewithal Sir Palomides' spear
 brake, and Sir Tristram smote down the horse; and Sir
 Palomides, as soon as he might, avoided his horse, and
 dressed his shield, and pulled out his sword.  That saw
 Sir Tristram, and therewithal he alighted and tied his
 horse till a tree.
