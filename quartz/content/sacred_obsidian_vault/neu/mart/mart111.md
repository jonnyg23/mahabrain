 CHAPTER XI
 
 How Sir Launcelot slew two giants, and made a castle free.
 
 ANON withal came there upon him two great giants, well armed all
 save the heads, with two horrible clubs in their hands.  Sir
 Launcelot put his shield afore him and put the stroke away of the
 one giant, and with his sword he clave &lt;193&gt;his head asunder. 
 When his fellow saw that, he ran away as he were wood, for fear
 of the horrible strokes, and Launcelot after him with all his
 might, and smote him on the shoulder, and clave him to the navel. 
 Then Sir Launcelot went into the hall, and there came afore him
 three score ladies and damosels, and all kneeled unto him, and
 thanked God and him of their deliverance; For sir, said they, the
 most party of us have been here this seven year their prisoners,
 and we have worked all manner of silk works for our meat, and we
 are all great gentlewomen born; and blessed be the time, knight,
 that ever thou be born, for thou hast done the most worship that
 ever did knight in this world, that will we bear record, and we
 all pray you to tell us your name, that we may tell our friends
 who delivered us out of prison.  Fair damosel, he said, my name
 is Sir Launcelot du Lake.  Ah, sir, said they all, well mayest
 thou be he, for else save yourself, as we deemed, there might
 never knight have the better of these two giants; for many fair
 knights have assayed it, and here have ended, and many times have
 we wished after you, and these two giants dread never knight but
 you.  Now may ye say, said Sir Launcelot, unto your friends how
 and who hath delivered you, and greet them all from me, and if
 that I come in any of your marches, show me such cheer as ye have
 cause, and what treasure that there in this castle is I give it
 you for a reward for your grievance, and the lord that is owner
 of this castle I would he received it as is right.  Fair sir,
 said they, the name of this castle is Tintagil, and a duke ought
 it sometime that had wedded fair Igraine, and after wedded her
 Uther Pendragon, and gat on her Arthur.  Well, said Sir
 Launcelot, I understand to whom this castle longeth; and so he
 departed from them, and betaught them unto God.
 
 And then he mounted upon his horse, and rode into many strange
 and wild countries, and through many waters and valleys, and evil
 was he lodged.  And at the last by fortune him happened, against
 a night, to come to a fair courtelage, and therein he found an
 old gentlewoman that lodged him with good will, and there he had
 good cheer &lt;194&gt;for him and his horse.  And when time was, his
 host brought him into a fair garret, over the gate, to his bed. 
 There Sir Launcelot unarmed him, and set his harness by him, and
 went to bed, and anon he fell asleep.  So, soon after, there came
 one on horseback, and knocked at the gate in great haste, and
 when Sir Launcelot heard this, he arose up and looked out at the
 window, and saw by the moonlight three knights came riding after
 that one man, and all three lashed on him at once with swords,
 and that one knight turned on them knightly again, and defended
 him.  Truly, said Sir Launcelot, yonder one knight shall I help,
 for it were shame for me to see three knights on one, and if he
 be slain I am partner of his death; and therewith he took his
 harness, and went out at a window by a sheet down to the four
 knights, and then Sir Launcelot said on high, Turn you knights
 unto me, and leave your fighting with that knight.  And then they
 all three left Sir Kay, and turned unto Sir Launcelot, and there
 began great battle, for they alighted all three, and struck many
 great strokes at Sir Launcelot, and assailed him on every side. 
 Then Sir Kay dressed him for to have holpen Sir Launcelot.  Nay,
 sir, said he, I will none of your help; therefore as ye will have
 my help, let me alone with them.  Sir Kay, for the pleasure of
 the knight, suffered him for to do his will, and so stood aside. 
 And then anon within six strokes, Sir Launcelot had stricken them
 to the earth.
 
 And then they all three cried:  Sir knight, we yield us unto you
 as a man of might makeless.  As to that, said Sir Launcelot, I
 will not take your yielding unto me.  But so that ye will yield
 you unto Sir Kay the Seneschal, on that covenant I will save your
 lives, and else not.  Fair knight, said they, that were we loath
 to do; for as for Sir Kay, we chased him hither, and had overcome
 him had not ye been, therefore to yield us unto him it were no
 reason.  Well, as to that, said Launcelot, advise you well, for
 ye may choose whether ye will die or live, for an ye be yolden it
 shall be unto Sir Kay.  Fair knight, then they said, in saving of
 our lives we will do as thou commandest &lt;195&gt;us.  Then shall ye,
 said Sir Launcelot, on Whitsunday next coming, go unto the court
 of King Arthur, and there shall ye yield you unto Queen Guenever,
 and put you all three in her grace and mercy, and say that Sir
 Kay sent you thither to be her prisoners.  Sir, they said, it
 shall be done by the faith of our bodies, an we be living, and
 there they swore every knight upon his sword.  And so Sir
 Launcelot suffered them so to depart.  And then Sir Launcelot
 knocked at the gate with the pommel of his sword, and with that
 came his host, and in they entered Sir Kay and he.  Sir, said his
 host, I weened ye had been in your bed.  So I was, said Sir
 Launcelot, but I rose and leapt out at my window for to help an
 old fellow of mine.  And so when they came nigh the light, Sir
 Kay knew well that it was Sir Launcelot, and therewith he kneeled
 down and thanked him of all his kindness that he had holpen him
 twice from the death.  Sir, he said, I have nothing done but that
 me ought for to do, and ye are welcome, and here shall ye repose
 you and take your rest.
 
 So when Sir Kay was unarmed, he asked after meat; so there was
 meat fetched him, and he ate strongly.  And when he had supped
 they went to their beds and were lodged together in one bed.  On
 the morn Sir Launcelot arose early, and left Sir Kay sleeping,
 and Sir Launcelot took Sir Kay's armour and his shield, and armed
 him, and so he went to the stable, and took his horse, and took
 his leave of his host, and so he departed.  Then soon after arose
 Sir Kay and missed Sir Launcelot.  And then he espied that he had
 his armour and his horse.  Now by my faith I know well that he
 will grieve some of the court of King Arthur; for on him knights
 will be bold, and deem that it is I, and that will beguile them. 
 And because of his armour and shield I am sure I shall ride in
 peace.  And then soon after departed Sir Kay and thanked his
 host.
