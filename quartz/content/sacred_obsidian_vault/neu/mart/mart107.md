 CHAPTER VII
 
 How Sir Launcelot behaved him in a tournament, and how
 he met with Sir Turquine leading Sir Gaheris.
 
 WITH that came Sir Launcelot du Lake, and he thrust in with his
 spear in the thickest of the press, and there he smote down with
 one spear five knights, and of four of them he brake their backs. 
 And in that throng he smote down the King of Northgalis, and
 brake his thigh in that fall.  All this doing of Sir Launcelot
 saw the three knights of Arthur's.  Yonder is a shrewd guest,
 said Sir Mador de la Porte, therefore have here once at him.  So
 they encountered, and Sir Launcelot bare him down horse and
 &lt;185&gt;man, so that his shoulder went out of lith.  Now befalleth
 it to me to joust, said Mordred, for Sir Mador hath a sore fall. 
 Sir Launcelot was ware of him, and gat a great spear in his hand,
 and met him, and Sir Mordred brake a spear upon him, and Sir
 Launcelot gave him such a buffet that the arson of his saddle
 brake, and so he flew over his horse's tail, that his helm butted
 into the earth a foot and more, that nigh his neck was broken,
 and there he lay long in a swoon.
 
 Then came in Sir Gahalantine with a great spear and Launcelot
 against him, with all their strength that they might drive, that
 both their spears to-brast even to their hands, and then they
 flang out with their swords and gave many a grim stroke.  Then
 was Sir Launcelot wroth out of measure, and then he smote Sir
 Gahalantine on the helm that his nose brast out on blood, and
 ears and mouth both, and therewith his head hung low.  And
 therewith his horse ran away with him, and he fell down to the
 earth.  Anon therewithal Sir Launcelot gat a great spear in his
 hand, and or ever that great spear brake, he bare down to the
 earth sixteen knights, some horse and man, and some the man and
 not the horse, and there was none but that he hit surely, he bare
 none arms that day.  And then he gat another great spear, and
 smote down twelve knights, and the most part of them never throve
 after.  And then the knights of the King of Northgalis would
 joust no more.  And there the gree was given to King Bagdemagus.
 
 So either party departed unto his own place, and Sir Launcelot
 rode forth with King Bagdemagus unto his castle, and there he had
 passing good cheer both with the king and with his daughter, and
 they proffered him great gifts.  And on the morn he took his
 leave, and told the king that he would go and seek his brother
 Sir Lionel, that went from him when that he slept, so he took his
 horse, and betaught them all to God.  And there he said unto the
 king's daughter, If ye have need any time of my service I pray
 you let me have knowledge, and I shall not fail you as I am true
 knight.  And so Sir Launcelot departed, and by adventure he came
 into the same forest there he was &lt;186&gt;taken sleeping.  And in
 the midst of a highway he met a damosel riding on a white
 palfrey, and there either saluted other.  Fair damosel, said Sir
 Launcelot, know ye in this country any adventures?  Sir knight,
 said that damosel, here are adventures near hand, an thou durst
 prove them.  Why should I not prove adventures? said Sir
 Launcelot for that cause come I hither.  Well, said she, thou
 seemest well to be a good knight, and if thou dare meet with a
 good knight, I shall bring thee where is the best knight, and the
 mightiest that ever thou found, so thou wilt tell me what is thy
 name, and what knight thou art.  Damosel, as for to tell thee my
 name I take no great force; truly my name is Sir Launcelot du
 Lake.  Sir, thou beseemest well, here be adventures by that fall
 for thee, for hereby dwelleth a knight that will not be
 overmatched for no man I know but ye overmatch him, and his name
 is Sir Turquine.  And, as I understand, he hath in his prison, of
 Arthur's court, good knights three score and four, that he hath
 won with his own hands.  But when ye have done that journey ye
 shall promise me as ye are a true knight for to go with me, and
 to help me and other damosels that are distressed daily with a
 false knight.  All your intent, damosel, and desire I will
 fulfil, so ye will bring me unto this knight.  Now, fair knight,
 come on your way; and so she brought him unto the ford and the
 tree where hung the basin.
 
 So Sir Launcelot let his horse drink, and then he beat on the
 basin with the butt of his spear so hard with all his might till
 the bottom fell out, and long he did so, but he saw nothing. 
 Then he rode endlong the gates of that manor nigh half-an-hour. 
 And then was he ware of a great knight that drove an horse afore
 him, and overthwart the horse there lay an armed knight bound. 
 And ever as they came near and near, Sir Launcelot thought he
 should know him.  Then Sir Launcelot was ware that it was Sir
 Gaheris, Gawaine's brother, a knight of the Table Round.  Now,
 fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, I see yonder cometh a knight
 fast bounden that is a fellow of mine, and brother he is unto Sir
 Gawaine.  And at the first beginning I promise you, by the leave
 of God, to rescue that knight; &lt;187&gt;but if his master sit better
 in the saddle I shall deliver all the prisoners that he hath out
 of danger, for I am sure he hath two brethren of mine prisoners
 with him.  By that time that either had seen other, they gripped
 their spears unto them.  Now, fair knight, said Sir Launcelot,
 put that wounded knight off the horse, and let him rest awhile,
 and let us two prove our strengths; for as it is informed me,
 thou doest and hast done great despite and shame unto knights of
 the Round Table, and therefore now defend thee.  An thou be of
 the Table Round, said Turquine, I defy thee and all thy
 fellowship.  That is overmuch said, said Sir Launcelot.
