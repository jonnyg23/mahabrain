 CHAPTER XIV
 
 How King Mark and Sir Dinadan heard Sir Palomides
 making great sorrow and mourning for La Beale Isoud.
 
 
 NOW turn we unto Sir Dinadan, that found these seven
 knights passing heavy.  And when he wist how that they
 sped, as heavy was he.  My lord Uwaine, said Dinadan, I
 dare lay my head it is Sir Lamorak de Galis.  I promise
 you all I shall find him an he may be found in this
 country.  And so Sir Dinadan rode after this knight;
 and so did King Mark, that sought him through the
 forest.  So as King Mark rode after Sir Palomides he
 heard the noise of a man that made great dole.  Then
 King Mark rode as nigh that noise as he might and as he
 durst.  Then was he ware of a knight that was descended
 off his horse, and had put off his helm, and there he made
 a piteous complaint and a dolorous, of love.
 
 Now leave we that, and talk we of Sir Dinadan, that
 rode to seek Sir Palomides.  And as he came within a
 forest he met with a knight, a chaser of a deer.  Sir,
 said Sir Dinadan, met ye with a knight with a shield
 of silver and lions' heads?  Yea, fair knight, said the
 other, with such a knight met I with but a while agone,
 and straight yonder way he yede.  Gramercy, said Sir
 Dinadan, for might I find the track of his horse I should
 not fail to find that knight.  Right so as Sir Dinadan
 rode in the even late he heard a doleful noise as it were
 of a man.  Then Sir Dinadan rode toward that noise;
 and when he came nigh that noise he alighted off his
 horse, and went near him on foot.  Then was he ware of
 a knight that stood under a tree, and his horse tied by
 him, and the helm off his head; and ever that knight
 made a doleful complaint as ever made knight.  And
 always he made his complaint of La Beale Isoud, the
 Queen of Cornwall, and said:  Ah, fair lady, why love I
 thee! for thou art fairest of all other, and yet showest
 thou never love to me, nor bounty.  Alas, yet must I
 love thee.  And I may not blame thee, fair lady, for
 mine eyes be cause of this sorrow.  And yet to love
 thee I am but a fool, for the best knight of the world
 loveth thee, and ye him again, that is Sir Tristram de
 Liones.  And the falsest king and knight is your husband,
 and the most coward and full of treason, is your lord,
 King Mark.  Alas, that ever so fair a lady and peerless
 of all other should be matched with the most villainous
 knight of the world.  All this language heard King
 Mark, what Sir Palomides said by him; wherefore he
 was adread when he saw Sir Dinadan, lest he espied him,
 that he would tell Sir Palomides that he was King Mark;
 and therefore he withdrew him, and took his horse and
 rode to his men, where he commanded them to abide.
 And so he rode as fast as he might unto Camelot; and
 the same day he found there Amant, the knight, ready
 that afore Arthur had appealed him of treason; and so,
 lightly the king commanded them to do battle.  And by
 misadventure King Mark smote Amant through the body.
 And yet was Amant in the righteous quarrel.  And right
 so he took his horse and departed from the court for
 dread of Sir Dinadan, that he would tell Sir Tristram and
 Sir Palomides what he was.  Then were there maidens
 that La Beale Isoud had sent to Sir Tristram, that knew
 Sir Amant well.
