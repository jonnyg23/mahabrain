 CHAPTER XIV
 
 How Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides fought long together,
 and after accorded, and how Sir Tristram made him to
 be christened.
 
 
 AND then they came together as two wild boars, lashing
 together, tracing and traversing as noble men that oft had
 been well proved in battle; but ever Sir Palomides dread
 the might of Sir Tristram, and therefore he suffered him
 to breathe him.  Thus they fought more than two hours,
 but often Sir Tristram smote such strokes at Sir Palomides
 that he made him to kneel; and Sir Palomides brake and
 cut away many pieces of Sir Tristram's shield; and then
 Sir Palomides wounded Sir Tristram, for he was a well
 fighting man.  Then Sir Tristram was wood wroth out of
 measure, and rushed upon Sir Palomides with such a might
 that Sir Palomides fell grovelling to the earth; and
 therewithal he leapt up lightly upon his feet, and then Sir
 Tristram wounded Palomides sore through the shoulder.
 And ever Sir Tristram fought still in like hard, and Sir
 Palomides failed not, but gave him many sad strokes.
 And at the last Sir Tristram doubled his strokes, and by
 fortune Sir Tristram smote Sir Palomides sword out of
 his hand, and if Sir Palomides had stooped for his sword
 he had been slain.
 
 Then Palomides stood still and beheld his sword with
 a sorrowful heart.  How now, said Sir Tristram unto
 Palomides, now have I thee at advantage as thou haddest
 me this day; but it shall never be said in no court, nor
 among good knights, that Sir Tristram shall slay any
 knight that is weaponless; and therefore take thou thy
 sword, and let us make an end of this battle.  As for to
 do this battle, said Palomides, I dare right well end it,
 but I have no great lust to fight no more.  And for this
 cause, said Palomides: mine offence to you is not so great
 but that we may be friends.  All that I have offended is
 and was for the love of La Beale Isoud.  And as for her,
 I dare say she is peerless above all other ladies, and also
 I proffered her never no dishonour; and by her I have
 gotten the most part of my worship.  And sithen I offended
 never as to her own person, and as for the offence that
 I have done, it was against your own person, and for that
 offence ye have given me this day many sad strokes, and
 some I have given you again; and now I dare say I felt
 never man of your might, nor so well breathed, but if it
 were Sir Launcelot du Lake; wherefore I require you,
 my lord, forgive me all that I have offended unto you;
 and this same day have me to the next church, and first
 let me be clean confessed, and after see you now that I be
 truly baptised.  And then will we all ride together unto
 the court of Arthur, that we be there at the high feast.
 Now take your horse, said Sir Tristram, and as ye say so
 it shall be, and all thine evil will God forgive it you, and
 I do.  And here within this mile is the Suffragan of
 Carlisle that shall give you the sacrament of baptism.
 
 Then they took their horses and Sir Galleron rode
 with them.  And when they came to the Suffragan Sir
 Tristram told him their desire.  Then the Suffragan let
 fill a great vessel with water, and when he had hallowed it
 he then confessed clean Sir Palomides, and Sir Tristram
 and Sir Galleron were his godfathers.  And then soon
 after they departed, riding toward Camelot, where King
 Arthur and Queen Guenever was, and for the most part
 all the knights of the Round Table.  And so the king
 and all the court were glad that Sir Palomides was
 christened.  And at the same feast in came Galahad and
 sat in the Siege Perilous.  And so therewithal departed
 and dissevered all the knights of the Round Table.  And
 Sir Tristram returned again unto Joyous Gard, and Sir
 Palomides followed the Questing Beast.
