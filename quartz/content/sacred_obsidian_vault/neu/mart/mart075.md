 CHAPTER XV
 
 How Morgan le Fay saved a knight that should have been
 drowned, and how King Arthur returned home again.
 
 THEN said Morgan, Saw ye Arthur, my brother?  Yea, said her
 knights, right well, and that ye should have found an we might
 have stirred from one stead, for by his armyvestal countenance he
 would have caused us to have fled.  I believe you, said Morgan. 
 Anon after as she rode she met a knight leading another knight on
 his horse before him, bound hand and foot, blindfold, to have
 &lt;125&gt;drowned him in a fountain.  When she saw this knight so
 bound, she asked him, What will ye do with that knight?  Lady,
 said he, I will drown him.  For what cause? she asked.  For I
 found him with my wife, and she shall have the same death anon. 
 That were pity, said Morgan le Fay.  Now, what say ye, knight, is
 it truth that he saith of you? she said to the knight that should
 be drowned.  Nay truly, madam, he saith not right on me.  Of
 whence be ye, said Morgan le Fay, and of what country?  I am of
 the court of King Arthur, and my name is Manassen, cousin unto
 Accolon of Gaul.  Ye say well, said she, and for the love of him
 ye shall be delivered, and ye shall have your adversary in the
 same case ye be in.  So Manassen was loosed and the other knight
 bound.  And anon Manassen unarmed him, and armed himself in his
 harness, and so mounted on horseback, and the knight afore him,
 and so threw him into the fountain and drowned him.  And then he
 rode unto Morgan again, and asked if she would anything unto King
 Arthur.  Tell him that I rescued thee, not for the love of him
 but for the love of Accolon, and tell him I fear him not while I
 can make me and them that be with me in likeness of stones; and
 let him wit I can do much more when I see my time.  And so she
 departed into the country of Gore, and there was she richly
 received, and made her castles and towns passing strong, for
 always she dreaded much King Arthur.
 
 When the king had well rested him at the abbey, he rode unto
 Camelot, and found his queen and his barons right glad of his
 coming.  And when they heard of his strange adventures as is
 afore rehearsed, then all had marvel of the falsehood of Morgan
 le Fay; many knights wished her burnt.  Then came Manassen to
 court and told the king of his adventure.  Well, said the king,
 she is a kind sister; I shall so be avenged on her an I live,
 that all Christendom shall speak of it.  So on the morn there
 came a damosel from Morgan to the king, and she brought with her
 the richest mantle that ever was seen in that court, for it was
 set as full of precious stones as one might stand by another, and
 there were the richest stones &lt;126&gt;that ever the king saw.  And
 the damosel said, Your sister sendeth you this mantle, and
 desireth that ye should take this gift of her; and in what thing
 she hath offended you, she will amend it at your own pleasure. 
 When the king beheld this mantle it pleased him much, but he said
 but little.
