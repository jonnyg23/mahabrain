 CHAPTER XXVI
 
 How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Breunor, and at the
 last smote off his head.
 
 THEN they took their horses and came together as it had been the
 thunder; and Sir Tristram smote Sir Breunor clean from his horse,
 and lightly he rose up; and as Sir Tristram came again by him he
 thrust his horse throughout both the shoulders, that his horse
 hurled here and there and fell dead to the ground.  And ever Sir
 Breunor ran after to have slain Sir Tristram, but Sir Tristram
 was light and nimble, and voided his horse lightly.  And or ever
 Sir Tristram might dress his shield and his sword the other gave
 him three or four sad strokes.  Then they rushed together like
 two boars, tracing and traversing mightily and wisely as two
 noble knights.  For this Sir Breunor was a proved knight, and had
 been or then the death of many good knights, that it was pity
 that he had so long endured.
 
 Thus they fought, hurling here and there nigh two hours, and
 either were wounded sore.  Then at the last Sir Breunor rashed
 upon Sir Tristram and took him in his arms, for he trusted much
 in his strength.  Then was Sir Tristram called the strongest and
 the highest knight of the world; for he was called bigger than
 Sir Launcelot, but Sir Launcelot was better breathed.  So anon
 Sir Tristram thrust Sir Breunor down grovelling, and then he
 unlaced his helm and struck off his head.  And then all they that
 longed to the castle came to him, and did him homage and fealty,
 praying him that he would abide there still a little while to
 fordo that foul custom.  Sir Tristram granted thereto.  The
 meanwhile one of the knights of the castle rode unto Sir Galahad,
 the haut prince, the which was Sir Breunor's son, which was a
 noble knight, and told him what misadventure his father had and
 his mother.
