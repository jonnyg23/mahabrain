 CHAPTER XXXV
 
 Of the Great Royalty, and what officers were made at the
 feast of the wedding, and of the jousts at the feast.
 
 SO it drew fast to Michaelmas; and thither came Dame Lionesse,
 the lady of the Castle Perilous, and her sister, Dame Linet, with
 Sir Gringamore, her brother, with them for he had the conduct of
 these ladies.  And there they were lodged at the device of King
 Arthur.  And upon Michaelmas Day the Bishop of Canterbury made
 the wedding betwixt Sir Gareth and the Lady Lionesse with great
 solemnity.  And King Arthur made Gaheris to wed the Damosel
 Savage, that was Dame Linet; and King Arthur made Sir Agravaine
 to wed Dame Lionesse's niece, a fair lady, her name was Dame
 Laurel.
 
 And so when this solemnization was done, then came in the Green
 Knight, Sir Pertolepe, with thirty knights, and there he did
 homage and fealty to Sir Gareth, and these knights to hold of him
 for evermore.  Also Sir Pertolepe said:  I pray you that at this
 feast I may be your chamberlain.  With a good will, said Sir
 Gareth sith it liketh you to take so simple an office.  Then came
 in the Red Knight, with three score knights with him, and did to
 Sir Gareth homage and fealty, and all those knights to hold of
 him for evermore.  And then this Sir Perimones prayed Sir Gareth
 to grant him to be his chief butler at that high feast.  I will
 well, said Sir Gareth, that ye have this office, and it were
 better.  Then came in Sir Persant of Inde, with an hundred
 knights with him, and there he did homage and fealty, and all his
 knights should do him service, and hold their lands of him for
 ever; and there he prayed Sir Gareth to make him his sewer-chief
 at the feast.  I will well, said Sir Gareth, that ye have it and
 it were better.  Then came the Duke de la Rowse with an hundred
 knights with him, and there he did homage and fealty to Sir
 Gareth, and so to hold their &lt;276&gt;lands of him for ever.  And he
 required Sir Gareth that he might serve him of the wine that day
 of that feast.  I will well, said Sir Gareth, and it were better. 
 Then came in the Red Knight of the Red Launds, that was Sir
 Ironside, and he brought with him three hundred knights, and
 there he did homage and fealty, and all these knights to hold
 their lands of him for ever.  And then he asked Sir Gareth to be
 his carver.  I will well, said Sir Gareth, an it please you.
 
 Then came into the court thirty ladies, and all they seemed
 widows, and those thirty ladies brought with them many fair
 gentlewomen.  And all they kneeled down at once unto King Arthur
 and unto Sir Gareth, and there all those ladies told the king how
 Sir Gareth delivered them from the dolorous tower, and slew the
 Brown Knight without Pity:  And therefore we, and our heirs for
 evermore, will do homage unto Sir Gareth of Orkney.  So then the
 kings and queens, princes and earls, barons and many bold
 knights, went unto meat; and well may ye wit there were all
 manner of meat plenteously, all manner revels and games, with all
 manner of minstrelsy that was used in those days.  Also there was
 great jousts three days.  But the king would not suffer Sir
 Gareth to joust, because of his new bride; for, as the French
 book saith, that Dame Lionesse desired of the king that none that
 were wedded should joust at that feast.
 
 So the first day there jousted Sir Lamorak de Galis, for he
 overthrew thirty knights, and did passing marvellously deeds of
 arms; and then King Arthur made Sir Persant and his two brethren
 Knights of the Round Table to their lives' end, and gave them
 great lands.  Also the second day there jousted Tristram best,
 and he overthrew forty knights, and did there marvellous deeds of
 arms.  And there King Arthur made Ironside, that was the Red
 Knight of the Red Launds, a Knight of the Table Round to his
 life's end, and gave him great lands.  The third day there
 jousted Sir Launcelot du Lake, and he overthrew fifty knights,
 and did many marvellous deeds of arms, that all men wondered on
 him.  And there King Arthur &lt;277&gt;made the Duke de la Rowse a
 Knight of the Round Table to his life's end, and gave him great
 lands to spend.  But when these jousts were done, Sir Lamorak and
 Sir Tristram departed suddenly, and would not be known, for the
 which King Arthur and all the court were sore displeased.  And so
 they held the court forty days with great solemnity.  And this
 Sir Gareth was a noble knight, and a well-ruled, and fair-
 languaged.
 
 
 Thus endeth this tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney that
 wedded Dame Lionesse of the Castle Perilous.
 And also Sir Gaheris wedded her sister, Dame
 Linet, that was called the Damosel Sabage.  And
 Sir Agrabaine wedded Dame Laurel, a fair lady
 and great, and mighty lands with great riches gave
 with them King Arthur, that royally they might
 live till their lives' end.
 
 Here followeth the viii. book, the which is the first
 book of Sir Tristram de Liones, and who was
 his father and his mother, and how he was born
 and fostered, and how he was made knight.
