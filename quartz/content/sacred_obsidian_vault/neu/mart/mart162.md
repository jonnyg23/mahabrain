 CHAPTER IX
 
 How Sir Tristram was put to the keeping of La Beale
 Isoud first for to be healed of his wound.
 
 THEN the king for great favour made Tramtrist to be put in his
 daughter's ward and keeping, because she was a noble surgeon. 
 And when she had searched him she found in the bottom of his
 wound that therein was poison, and so she healed him within a
 while; and therefore Tramtrist cast great love to La Beale Isoud,
 for she was at that time the fairest maid and lady of the world. 
 And there Tramtrist learned her to harp, and she began to have a
 great fantasy unto him.  And at that time Sir Palamides, the
 Saracen, was in that country, and well cherished with the king
 and the queen.  And every day Sir Palamides drew unto La Beale
 Isoud and proffered her many gifts, for he loved her passingly
 well.  All that espied Tramtrist, and full well knew he Sir
 Palamides for a noble knight and a mighty man.  And wit you well
 Sir Tramtrist had great despite at Sir Palamides, for La Beale
 Isoud told Tramtrist that Palamides was in will to be christened
 for her sake.  Thus was there great envy betwixt Tramtrist and
 Sir Palamides.
 
 Then it befell that King Anguish let cry a great jousts and a
 great tournament for a lady that was called the Lady of the
 Launds, and she was nigh cousin unto the king.  And what man won
 her, three days after he should wed her and have all her lands. 
 This cry was made in England, Wales, Scotland, and also in France
 and in Brittany.  It befell upon a day La Beale Isoud came unto
 Sir Tramtrist, and told him of this tournament.  He answered and
 said:  Fair lady, I am but a feeble knight, and but late I had
 been dead had not your good ladyship been.  Now, fair lady, what
 would ye I should do in this matter? well ye wot, my lady, that I
 may not joust.  Ah, Tramtrist, said La Beale Isoud, why will ye
 not have ado at that tournament?&lt;293&gt; well I wot Sir Palamides
 shall be there, and to do what he may; and therefore Tramtrist, I
 pray you for to be there, for else Sir Palamides is like to win
 the degree.  Madam, said Tramtrist, as for that, it may be so,
 for he is a proved knight, and I am but a young knight and late
 made; and the first battle that I did it mishapped me to be sore
 wounded as ye see.  But an I wist ye would be my better lady, at
 that tournament I will be, so that ye will keep my counsel and
 let no creature have knowledge that I shall joust but yourself,
 and such as ye will to keep your counsel, my poor person shall I
 jeopard there for your sake, that, peradventure, Sir Palamides
 shall know when that I come.  Thereto, said La Beale Isoud, do
 your best, and as I can, said La Beale Isoud, I shall purvey
 horse and armour for you at my device.  As ye will so be it, said
 Sir Tramtrist, I will be at your commandment.
 
 So at the day of jousts there came Sir Palamides with a black
 shield, and he overthrew many knights, that all the people had
 marvel of him.  For he put to the worse Sir Gawaine, Gaheris,
 Agravaine, Bagdemagus, Kay, Dodinas le Savage, Sagramore le
 Desirous, Gumret le Petit, and Griflet le Fise de Dieu.  All
 these the first day Sir Palamides struck down to the earth.  And
 then all manner of knights were adread of Sir Palamides, and many
 called him the Knight with the Black Shield.  So that day Sir
 Palamides had great worship.
 
 Then came King Anguish unto Tramtrist, and asked him why he would
 not joust.  Sir, he said, I was but late hurt, and as yet I dare
 not adventure me.  Then came there the same squire that was sent
 from the king's daughter of France unto Sir Tristram.  And when
 he had espied Sir Tristram he fell flat to his feet.  All that
 espied La Beale Isoud, what courtesy the squire made unto Sir
 Tristram.  And therewithal suddenly Sir Tristram ran unto his
 squire, whose name was Hebes le Renoumes, and prayed him heartily
 in no wise to tell his name.  Sir, said Hebes, I will not
 discover your name but if ye command me.
