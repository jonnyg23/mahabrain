 CHAPTER IX
 
 How the damosel again rebuked Beaumains, and would not
 suffer him to sit at her table, but called him kitchen boy.
 
 AND ever she rebuked Beaumains, and would not suffer him to sit
 at her table, but as the Green Knight took him and sat him at a
 side table.  Marvel methinketh, said the Green Knight to the
 damosel, why ye rebuke this noble knight as ye do, for I warn
 you, damosel, he is a full noble knight, and I know no knight is
 able to match him; therefore ye do great wrong to rebuke him, for
 he shall do you right good service, for whatsomever he maketh
 himself, ye shall prove at the end that he is come of a noble
 blood and of king's lineage.  Fie, fie, said the damosel, it is
 shame for you to say of him such worship.  Truly, said the Green
 Knight, it were shame for me to say of him any disworship, for he
 hath proved himself a better knight than I am, yet have I met
 with many knights in my days, and never or this time have I found
 no knight his match.  And so that night they yede unto rest, and
 all that night the Green Knight commanded thirty knights privily
 to watch Beaumains, for to keep him from all treason.
 
 And so on the morn they all arose, and heard their mass and brake
 their fast; and then they took their horses and rode on their
 way, and the Green Knight conveyed them through the forest; and
 there the Green Knight said, My lord Beaumains, I and these
 thirty knights shall be always at your summons, both early and
 late, at your calling and whither that ever ye will send us.  It
 is well said, said Beaumains; when that I call upon you ye must
 yield you unto King Arthur, and all your knights.  If &lt;224&gt;that
 ye so command us, we shall be ready at all times, said the Green
 Knight.  Fie, fie upon thee, in the devil's name, said the
 damosel, that any good knights should be obedient unto a kitchen
 knave.  So then departed the Green Knight and the damosel.  And
 then she said unto Beaumains, Why followest thou me, thou kitchen
 boy?  Cast away thy shield and thy spear, and flee away; yet I
 counsel thee betimes or thou shalt say right soon, alas; for wert
 thou as wight as ever was Wade or Launcelot, Tristram, or the
 good knight Sir Lamorak, thou shalt not pass a pass here that is
 called the Pass Perilous.  Damosel, said Beaumains, who is afeard
 let him flee, for it were shame to turn again sithen I have
 ridden so long with you.  Well, said the damosel, ye shall soon,
 whether ye will or not.
