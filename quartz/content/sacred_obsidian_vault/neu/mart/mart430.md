 CHAPTER I
 
 Of the joy King Arthur and the queen had of the achievement
 of the Sangreal; and how Launcelot fell to his old
 love again.
 
 
 SO after the quest of the Sangreal was fulfilled, and all
 knights that were left alive were come again unto the
 Table Round, as the book of the Sangreal maketh
 mention, then was there great joy in the court; and in
 especial King Arthur and Queen Guenever made great
 joy of the remnant that were come home, and passing
 glad was the king and the queen of Sir Launcelot and of
 Sir Bors, for they had been passing long away in the
 quest of the Sangreal.
 
 Then, as the book saith, Sir Launcelot began to resort
 unto Queen Guenever again, and forgat the promise and
 the perfection that he made in the quest.  For, as the
 book saith, had not Sir Launcelot been in his privy
 thoughts and in his mind so set inwardly to the queen
 as he was in seeming outward to God, there had no
 knight passed him in the quest of the Sangreal; but
 ever his thoughts were privily on the queen, and so
 they loved together more hotter than they did to-forehand,
 and had such privy draughts together, that many in the
 court spake of it, and in especial Sir Agravaine, Sir
 Gawaine's brother, for he was ever open-mouthed.
 
 So befell that Sir Launcelot had many resorts of ladies
 and damosels that daily resorted unto him, that besought
 him to be their champion, and in all such matters of right
 Sir Launcelot applied him daily to do for the pleasure of
 Our Lord, Jesu Christ.  And ever as much as he might
 he withdrew him from the company and fellowship of
 Queen Guenever, for to eschew the slander and noise;
 wherefore the queen waxed wroth with Sir Launcelot.
 And upon a day she called Sir Launcelot unto her chamber,
 and said thus:  Sir Launcelot, I see and feel daily that thy
 love beginneth to slake, for thou hast no joy to be in my
 presence, but ever thou art out of this court, and quarrels
 and matters thou hast nowadays for ladies and gentlewomen
 more than ever thou wert wont to have aforehand.
 
 Ah madam, said Launcelot, in this ye must hold me
 excused for divers causes; one is, I was but late in the
 quest of the Sangreal; and I thank God of his great
 mercy, and never of my desert, that I saw in that my
 quest as much as ever saw any sinful man, and so was it
 told me.  And if I had not had my privy thoughts to
 return to your love again as I do, I had seen as great
 mysteries as ever saw my son Galahad, outher Percivale,
 or Sir Bors; and therefore, madam, I was but late in that
 quest.  Wit ye well, madam, it may not be yet lightly
 forgotten the high service in whom I did my diligent
 labour.  Also, madam, wit ye well that there be many
 men speak of our love in this court, and have you and me
 greatly in await, as Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred; and
 madam, wit ye well I dread them more for your sake than
 for any fear I have of them myself, for I may happen to
 escape and rid myself in a great need, where ye must
 abide all that will be said unto you.  And then if that ye
 fall in any distress through wilful folly, then is there none
 other remedy or help but by me and my blood.  And wit
 ye well, madam, the boldness of you and me will bring us
 to great shame and slander; and that were me loath to see
 you dishonoured.  And that is the cause I take upon me
 more for to do for damosels and maidens than ever I did
 to-fore, that men should understand my joy and my delight
 is my pleasure to have ado for damosels and maidens.
