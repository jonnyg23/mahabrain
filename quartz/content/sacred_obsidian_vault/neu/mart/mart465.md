 CHAPTER XI
 
 How King Arthur handled Sir Urre, and after him many
 other knights of the Round Table
 
 
 THEN King Arthur looked upon Sir Urre, and the king
 thought he was a full likely man when he was whole;
 and then King Arthur made him to be taken down off
 the litter and laid him upon the earth, and there was laid
 a cushion of gold that he should kneel upon.  And then
 noble Arthur said:  Fair knight, me repenteth of thy hurt,
 and for to courage all other noble knights I will pray thee
 softly to suffer me to handle your wounds.  Most noble
 christened king, said Urre, do as ye list, for I am at the
 mercy of God, and at your commandment.  So then
 Arthur softly handled him, and then some of his wounds
 renewed upon bleeding.  Then the King Clarence of
 Northumberland searched, and it would not be.  And
 then Sir Barant le Apres that was called the King with
 the Hundred Knights, he assayed and failed; and so did
 King Uriens of the land of Gore; so did King Anguish
 of Ireland; so did King Nentres of Garloth; so did King
 Carados of Scotland; so did the Duke Galahad, the haut
 prince; so did Constantine, that was Sir Carados' son of
 Cornwall; so did Duke Chaleins of Clarance; so did the
 Earl Ulbause; so did the Earl Lambaile; so did the Earl
 Aristause.
 
 Then came in Sir Gawaine with his three sons, Sir
 Gingalin, Sir Florence, and Sir Lovel, these two were
 begotten upon Sir Brandiles' sister; and all they failed.
 Then came in Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris, Sir Mordred,
 and the good knight, Sir Gareth, that was of very knighthood
 worth all the brethren.  So came knights of Launcelot's
 kin, but Sir Launcelot was not that time in the court,
 for he was that time upon his adventures.  Then Sir
 Lionel, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Blamore
 de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, Sir Gahalantine, Sir Galihodin,
 Sir Menaduke, Sir Villiars the Valiant, Sir Hebes le
 Renoumes.  All these were of Sir Launcelot's kin, and all
 they failed.  Then came in Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir
 Dodinas le Savage, Sir Dinadan, Sir Bruin le Noire, that
 Sir Kay named La Cote Male Taile, and Sir Kay le
 Seneschal, Sir Kay de Stranges, Sir Meliot de Logris, Sir
 Petipase of Winchelsea, Sir Galleron of Galway, Sir Melion
 of the Mountain, Sir Cardok, Sir Uwaine les Avoutres,
 and Sir Ozanna le Cure Hardy.
 
 Then came in Sir Astamor, and Sir Gromere, Grummor's son,
 Sir Crosselm, Sir Servause le Breuse, that was
 called a passing strong knight, for as the book saith, the
 chief Lady of the Lake feasted Sir Launcelot and Servause
 le Breuse, and when she had feasted them both at sundry
 times she prayed them to give her a boon.  And they
 granted it her.  And then she prayed Sir Servause that he
 would promise her never to do battle against Sir Launcelot
 du Lake, and in the same wise she prayed Sir Launcelot
 never to do battle against Sir Servause, and so either
 promised her.  For the French book saith, that Sir
 Servause had never courage nor lust to do battle against
 no man, but if it were against giants, and against dragons,
 and wild beasts.  So we pass unto them that at the king's
 request made them all that were there at that high feast,
 as of the knights of the Table Round, for to search Sir
 Urre: to that intent the king did it, to wit which was
 the noblest knight among them.
 
 Then came Sir Aglovale, Sir Durnore, Sir Tor, that
 was begotten upon Aries, the cowherd's wife, but he was
 begotten afore Aries wedded her, and King Pellinore begat
 them all, first Sir Tor, Sir Aglovale, Sir Durnore, Sir
 Lamorak, the most noblest knight one that ever was in
 Arthur's days as for a worldly knight, and Sir Percivale
 that was peerless except Sir Galahad in holy deeds, but
 they died in the quest of the Sangreal.  Then came Sir
 Griflet le Fise de Dieu, Sir Lucan the Butler, Sir Bedevere
 his brother, Sir Brandiles, Sir Constantine, Sir Cador's son
 of Cornwall, that was king after Arthur's days, and Sir
 Clegis, Sir Sadok, Sir Dinas le Seneschal of Cornwall, Sir
 Fergus, Sir Driant, Sir Lambegus, Sir Clarrus of Cleremont,
 Sir Cloddrus, Sir Hectimere, Sir Edward of Carnarvon,
 Sir Dinas, Sir Priamus, that was christened by Sir
 Tristram the noble knight, and these three were brethren;
 Sir Hellaine le Blank that was son to Sir Bors, he begat
 him upon King Brandegoris' daughter, and Sir Brian de
 Listinoise; Sir Gautere, Sir Reynold, Sir Gillemere, were
 three brethren that Sir Launcelot won upon a bridge in
 Sir Kay's arms.  Sir Guyart le Petite, Sir Bellangere le
 Beuse, that was son to the good knight, Sir Alisander le
 Orphelin, that was slain by the treason of King Mark.
 Also that traitor king slew the noble knight Sir Tristram,
 as he sat harping afore his lady La Beale Isoud, with a
 trenchant glaive, for whose death was much bewailing of
 every knight that ever were in Arthur's days; there was
 never none so bewailed as was Sir Tristram and Sir
 Lamorak, for they were traitorously slain, Sir Tristram
 by King Mark, and Sir Lamorak by Sir Gawaine and his
 brethren.  And this Sir Bellangere revenged the death of
 his father Alisander, and Sir Tristram slew King Mark,
 and La Beale Isoud died swooning upon the corse of Sir
 Tristram, whereof was great pity.  And all that were
 with King Mark that were consenting to the death of Sir
 Tristram were slain, as Sir Andred and many other.
 
 Then came Sir Hebes, Sir Morganore, Sir Sentraile,
 Sir Suppinabilis, Sir Bellangere le Orgulous, that the good
 knight Sir Lamorak won in plain battle; Sir Neroveus
 and Sir Plenorius, two good knights that Sir Launcelot
 won; Sir Darras, Sir Harry le Fise Lake, Sir Erminide,
 brother to King Hermaunce, for whom Sir Palomides
 fought at the Red City with two brethren; and Sir Selises
 of the Dolorous Tower, Sir Edward of Orkney, Sir Ironside,
 that was called the noble Knight of the Red Launds
 that Sir Gareth won for the love of Dame Liones, Sir
 Arrok de Grevaunt, Sir Degrane Saunce Velany that
 fought with the giant of the black lowe, Sir Epinogris,
 that was the king's son of Northumberland.  Sir Pelleas
 that loved the lady Ettard, and he had died for her love
 had not been one of the ladies of the lake, her name was
 Dame Nimue, and she wedded Sir Pelleas, and she saved
 him that he was never slain, and he was a full noble
 knight; and Sir Lamiel of Cardiff that was a great lover.
 Sir Plaine de Fors, Sir Melleaus de Lile, Sir Bohart le
 Cure Hardy that was King Arthur's son, Sir Mador de la
 Porte, Sir Colgrevance, Sir Hervise de la Forest Savage,
 Sir Marrok, the good knight that was betrayed with his
 wife, for she made him seven year a wer-wolf, Sir Persaunt,
 Sir Pertilope, his brother, that was called the Green
 Knight, and Sir Perimones, brother to them both, that
 was called the Red Knight, that Sir Gareth won when he
 was called Beaumains.  All these hundred knights and
 ten searched Sir Urre's wounds by the commandment of
 King Arthur.
