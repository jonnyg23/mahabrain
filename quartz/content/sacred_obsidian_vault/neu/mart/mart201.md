 CHAPTER VII
 
 How Sir Launcelot met with the damosel named Male
 disant, and named her the Damosel Bienpensant.
 
 SO then they took their horses and rode forth a pace after Sir
 Launcelot.  And within two mile they overtook him, and saluted
 him, and thanked him, and the damosel cried Sir Launcelot mercy
 of her evil deed and saying:  For now I know the flower of all
 knighthood is departed even between Sir Tristram and you.  For
 God knoweth, said the damosel, that I have sought you my lord,
 Sir Launcelot, and Sir Tristram long, and now I thank God I have
 met with you; and once at Camelot I met with Sir Tristram, and
 there he rescued this black shield with the white hand holding a
 naked sword that Sir Breuse Saunce Pite had taken from me.  Now,
 fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, who told you my name?  Sir,
 said she, there came a damosel from a knight that ye fought
 withal at the bridge, and she told me your name was Sir Launcelot
 du Lake.  Blame have she then, said Sir Launcelot, but her lord,
 Sir Nerovens, hath told her.  But, damosel, said Sir Launcelot,
 upon this covenant I will ride with you, so that ye will not
 rebuke this knight Sir La Cote Male Taile no more; for he is a
 good knight, and I doubt not he shall prove a noble knight, and
 for his sake and pity that he should not be destroyed I followed
 him to succour him in this great need.  Ah, Jesu thank you, said
 the damosel, for now I will say unto you and to him both, I
 rebuked him never for no hate that I hated him, but for great
 &lt;363&gt;love that I had to him.  For ever I supposed that he had
 been too young and too tender to take upon him these adventures. 
 And therefore by my will I would have driven him away for
 jealousy that I had of his life, for it may be no young knight's
 deed that shall enchieve this adventure to the end.  Pardieu,
 said Sir Launcelot, it is well said, and where ye are called the
 Damosel Maledisant I will call you the Damosel Bienpensant.
 
 And so they rode forth a great while unto they came to the border
 of the country of Surluse, and there they found a fair village
 with a strong bridge like a fortress.  And when Sir Launcelot and
 they were at the bridge there stert forth afore them of gentlemen
 and yeomen many, that said:  Fair lords, ye may not pass this
 bridge and this fortress because of that black shield that I see
 one of you bear, and therefore there shall not pass but one of
 you at once; therefore choose you which of you shall enter within
 this bridge first.  Then Sir Launcelot proffered himself first to
 enter within this bridge.  Sir, said La Cote Male Taile, I
 beseech you let me enter within this fortress, and if I may speed
 well I will send for you, and if it happened that I be slain,
 there it goeth.  And if so be that I am a prisoner taken, then
 may ye rescue me.  I am loath, said Sir Launcelot, to let you
 pass this passage.  Sir, said La Cote Male Taile, I pray you let
 me put my body in this adventure.  Now go your way, said Sir
 Launcelot, and Jesu be your speed.
 
 So he entered, and anon there met with him two brethren, the one
 hight Sir Plaine de Force, and the other hight Sir Plaine de
 Amours.  And anon they met with Sir La Cote Male Taile; and first
 La Cote Male Taile smote down Plaine de Force, and after he smote
 down Plaine de Amours; and then they dressed them to their
 shields and swords, and bade La Cote Male Taile alight, and so he
 did; and there was dashing and foining with swords, and so they
 began to assail full hard La Cote Male Taile, and many great
 wounds they gave him upon his head, and upon his breast, and upon
 his shoulders.  And as he might ever among he gave sad strokes
 again.  &lt;364&gt;And then the two brethren traced and traversed for
 to be of both hands of Sir La Cote Male Taile, but he by fine
 force and knightly prowess gat them afore him.  And then when he
 felt himself so wounded, then he doubled his strokes, and gave
 them so many wounds that he felled them to the earth, and would
 have slain them had they not yielded them.  And right so Sir La
 Cote Male Taile took the best horse that there was of them three,
 and so rode forth his way to the other fortress and bridge; and
 there he met with the third brother whose name was Sir Plenorius,
 a full noble knight, and there they jousted together, and either
 smote other down, horse and man, to the earth.  And then they
 avoided their horses, and dressed their shields, and drew their
 swords, and gave many sad strokes, and one while the one knight
 was afore on the bridge, and another while the other.  And thus
 they fought two hours and more, and never rested.  And ever Sir
 Launcelot and the damosel beheld them.  Alas, said the damosel,
 my knight fighteth passing sore and over long.  Now may ye see,
 said Sir Launcelot, that he is a noble knight, for to consider
 his first battle, and his grievous wounds; and even forthwithal
 so wounded as he is, it is marvel that he may endure this long
 battle with that good knight.
