 CHAPTER XV
 
 How Sir Kay met with Sir Tristram, and after of the
 shame spoken of the knights of Cornwall, and how they jousted.
 
 NOW leave we of this tale, and speak we of Sir Tristram, that as
 he rode he met with Sir Kay, the Seneschal; and there Sir Kay
 asked Sir Tristram of what country he was.  He answered that he
 was of the country of Cornwall.  It may well be, said Sir Kay,
 for yet heard I never that ever good knight came out of Cornwall. 
 That is evil spoken, said Sir Tristram, but an it please you to
 tell me your name I require you.  Sir, wit ye well, said Sir Kay,
 that my name is Sir Kay, the Seneschal.  Is that your name? said
 Sir Tristram, now wit ye well that ye are named the shamefullest
 knight of your tongue that now is living; howbeit ye are called a
 good knight, but ye are called unfortunate, and passing
 overthwart of your tongue.  And thus they rode together till they
 came to a &lt;375&gt;bridge.  And there was a knight would not let them
 pass till one of them jousted with him; and so that knight
 jousted with Sir Kay, and there that knight gave Sir Kay a fall:
 his name was Sir Tor, Sir Lamorak's half-brother.  And then they
 two rode to their lodging, and there they found Sir Brandiles,
 and Sir Tor came thither anon after.  And as they sat at supper
 these four knights, three of them spake all shame by Cornish
 knights.  Sir Tristram heard all that they said and he said but
 little, but he thought the more, but at that time he discovered
 not his name.
 
 Upon the morn Sir Tristram took his horse and abode them upon
 their way.  And there Sir Brandiles proffered to joust with Sir
 Tristram, and Sir Tristram smote him down, horse and all, to the
 earth.  Then Sir Tor le Fise de Vayshoure encountered with Sir
 Tristram and there Sir Tristram smote him down, and then he rode
 his way, and Sir Kay followed him, but he would not of his
 fellowship.  Then Sir Brandiles came to Sir Kay and said: I would
 wit fain what is that knight's name.  Come on with me, said Sir
 Kay, and we shall pray him to tell us his name.  So they rode
 together till they came nigh him, and then they were ware where
 he sat by a well, and had put off his helm to drink at the well. 
 And when he saw them come he laced on his helm lightly, and took
 his horse, and proffered them to joust.  Nay, said Sir Brandiles,
 we jousted late enough with you, we come not in that intent.  But
 for this we come to require you of knighthood to tell us your
 name.  My fair knights, sithen that is your desire, and to please
 you, ye shall wit that my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, nephew
 unto King Mark of Cornwall.  In good time, said Sir Brandiles,
 and well be ye found, and wit ye well that we be right glad that
 we have found you, and we be of a fellowship that would be right
 glad of your company.  For ye are the knight in the world that
 the noble fellowship of the Round Table most desireth to have the
 company of.  God thank them said Sir Tristram, of their great
 goodness, but as yet I feel well that I am unable to be of their
 fellowship, for I was &lt;376&gt;never yet of such deeds of worthiness
 to be in the company of such a fellowship.  Ah, said Sir Kay, an
 ye be Sir Tristram de Liones, ye are the man called now most of
 prowess except Sir Launcelot du Lake; for he beareth not the
 life, Christian nor heathen, that can find such another knight,
 to speak of his prowess, and of his hands, and his truth withal. 
 For yet could there never creature say of him dishonour and make
 it good.  Thus they talked a great while, and then they departed
 either from other such ways as them seemed best.
