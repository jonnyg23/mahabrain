 CHAPTER I
 
 How Sir Tristram jousted, and smote down King Arthur,
 because he told him not the cause why he bare that shield.
 
 
 AND if so be ye can descrive what ye bear, ye are worthy
 to bear the arms.  As for that, said Sir Tristram, I will
 answer you; this shield was given me, not desired, of
 Queen Morgan le Fay; and as for me, I can not descrive
 these arms, for it is no point of my charge, and yet I
 trust to God to bear them with worship.  Truly, said
 King Arthur, ye ought not to bear none arms but if ye
 wist what ye bear: but I pray you tell me your name.
 To what intent? said Sir Tristram.  For I would wit,
 said Arthur.  Sir, ye shall not wit as at this time.  Then
 shall ye and I do battle together, said King Arthur.
 Why, said Sir Tristram, will ye do battle with me but if
 I tell you my name? and that little needeth you an ye
 were a man of worship, for ye have seen me this day
 have had great travail, and therefore ye are a villainous
 knight to ask battle of me, considering my great travail;
 howbeit I will not fail you, and have ye no doubt that I
 fear not you; though you think you have me at a great
 advantage yet shall I right well endure you.  And there
 withal King Arthur dressed his shield and his spear, and
 Sir Tristram against him, and they came so eagerly
 together.  And there King Arthur brake his spear all to
 pieces upon Sir Tristram's shield.  But Sir Tristram hit
 Arthur again, that horse and man fell to the earth.  And
 there was King Arthur wounded on the left side, a great
 wound and a perilous.
 
 Then when Sir Uwaine saw his lord Arthur lie on the
 ground sore wounded, he was passing heavy.  And then
 he dressed his shield and his spear, and cried aloud unto
 Sir Tristram and said:  Knight, defend thee.  So they
 came together as thunder, and Sir Uwaine brised his spear
 all to pieces upon Sir Tristram's shield, and Sir Tristram
 smote him harder and sorer, with such a might that he
 bare him clean out of his saddle to the earth.  With that
 Sir Tristram turned about and said:  Fair knights, I had
 no need to joust with you, for I have had enough to do
 this day.  Then arose Arthur and went to Sir Uwaine,
 and said to Sir Tristram:  We have as we have deserved,
 for through our orgulyt<e> we demanded battle of you,
 and yet we knew not your name.  Nevertheless, by Saint
 Cross, said Sir Uwaine, he is a strong knight at mine
 advice as any is now living.
 
 Then Sir Tristram departed, and in every place he
 asked and demanded after Sir Launcelot, but in no place
 he could not hear of him whether he were dead or alive;
 wherefore Sir Tristram made great dole and sorrow.  So
 Sir Tristram rode by a forest, and then was he ware of a
 fair tower by a marsh on that one side, and on that other
 side a fair meadow.  And there he saw ten knights
 fighting together.  And ever the nearer he came he saw
 how there was but one knight did battle against nine
 knights, and that one did so marvellously that Sir
 Tristram had great wonder that ever one knight might
 do so great deeds of arms.  And then within a little
 while he had slain half their horses and unhorsed them,
 and their horses ran in the fields and forest.  Then Sir
 Tristram had so great pity of that one knight that
 endured so great pain, and ever he thought it should be
 Sir Palomides, by his shield.  And so he rode unto the
 knights and cried unto them, and bade them cease of
 their battle, for they did themselves great shame so many
 knights to fight with one.  Then answered the master of
 those knights, his name was called Breuse Saunce Pit<e>,
 that was at that time the most mischievoust knight living,
 and said thus:  Sir knight, what have ye ado with us to
 meddle? and therefore, an ye be wise, depart on your
 way as ye came, for this knight shall not escape us.
 That were pity, said Sir Tristram, that so good a knight
 as he is should be slain so cowardly; and therefore I
 warn you I will succour him with all my puissance.
