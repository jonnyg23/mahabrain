 CHAPTER XXXIV
 
 How Sir Gareth acknowledged that they loved each other
 to King Arthur, and of the appointment of their wedding.
 
 AND among all these ladies she was named the fairest, and
 peerless.  Then when Sir Gawaine saw her there was many a goodly
 look and goodly words, that all men of worship had joy to behold
 them.  Then came King Arthur and many other kings, and Dame
 Guenever, and the Queen of Orkney.  And there the king asked his
 nephew, Sir Gareth, whether he would have that lady as paramour,
 or to have her to his wife.  My lord, wit you well that I love
 her above all ladies living.  Now, fair lady, said King Arthur,
 what say ye?  Most noble King, said Dame Lionesse, wit you well
 that my lord, Sir Gareth, is to me more liefer to have and wield
 as my husband, than any king or prince that is christened; and if
 I may not have him I promise you I will never have none.  For, my
 lord Arthur, said Dame Lionesse, wit ye well he is my first love,
 and he shall be the last; and if ye will suffer him to &lt;274&gt;have
 his will and free choice I dare say he will have me.  That is
 truth, said Sir Gareth; an I have not you and wield not you as my
 wife, there shall never lady nor gentlewoman rejoice me.  What,
 nephew, said the king, is the wind in that door? for wit ye well
 I would not for the stint of my crown to be causer to withdraw
 your hearts; and wit ye well ye cannot love so well but I shall
 rather increase it than distress it.  And also ye shall have my
 love and my lordship in the uttermost wise that may lie in my
 power.  And in the same wise said Sir Gareth's mother.
 
 Then there was made a provision for the day of marriage; and by
 the king's advice it was provided that it should be at Michaelmas
 following, at Kink Kenadon by the seaside, for there is a
 plentiful country.  And so it was cried in all the places through
 the realm.  And then Sir Gareth sent his summons to all these
 knights and ladies that he had won in battle to-fore, that they
 should be at his day of marriage at Kink Kenadon by the sands. 
 And then Dame Lionesse, and the damosel Linet with Sir
 Gringamore, rode to their castle; and a goodly and a rich ring
 she gave to Sir Gareth, and he gave her another.  And King Arthur
 gave her a rich pair of beads[*6] of gold; and so she departed;
 and King Arthur and his fellowship rode toward Kink Kenadon, and
 Sir Gareth brought his lady on the way, and so came to the king
 again and rode with him.  Lord! the great cheer that Sir
 Launcelot made of Sir Gareth and he of him, for there was never
 no knight that Sir Gareth loved so well as he did Sir Launcelot;
 and ever for the most part he would be in Sir Launcelot's
 company; for after Sir Gareth had espied Sir Gawaine's
 conditions, he withdrew himself from his brother, Sir Gawaine's,
 fellowship, for he was vengeable, and where he hated he would be
 avenged with murder, and that hated Sir Gareth.
