 CHAPTER XLVIII
 
 Of the sixth day, and what then was done.
 
 
 HERE beginneth the sixth day.  Then came therein Sir
 Gaheris, and there encountered with him Sir Ossaise of
 Surluse, and Sir Gaheris smote him over his horse's croup.
 And then either party encountered with other, and there
 were many spears broken, and many knights cast under
 feet.  So there came in Sir Dornard and Sir Aglovale,
 that were brethren unto Sir Lamorak, and they met with
 other two knights, and either smote other so hard that
 all four knights and horses fell to the earth.  When Sir
 Lamorak saw his two brethren down he was wroth out of
 measure, and then he gat a great spear in his hand, and
 therewithal he smote down four good knights, and then
 his spear brake.  Then he pulled out his sword, and
 smote about him on the right hand and on the left hand,
 and raced off helms and pulled down knights, that all
 men marvelled of such deeds of arms as he did, for he
 fared so that many knights fled.  Then he horsed his
 brethren again, and said:  Brethren, ye ought to be
 ashamed to fall so off your horses! what is a knight
 but when he is on horseback?  I set not by a knight
 when he is on foot, for all battles on foot are but pillers'
 battles.  For there should no knight fight on foot but
 if it were for treason, or else he were driven thereto by
 force; therefore, brethren, sit fast on your horses, or else
 fight never more afore me.
 
 With that came in the Duke Chaleins of Clarance,
 and there encountered with him the Earl Ulbawes of
 Surluse, and either of them smote other down.  Then
 the knights of both parties horsed their lords again, for
 Sir Ector and Bleoberis were on foot, waiting on the
 Duke Chaleins.  And the King with the Hundred Knights
 was with the Earl of Ulbawes.  With that came Gaheris
 and lashed to the King with the Hundred Knights, and
 he to him again.  Then came the Duke Chaleins and
 departed them.
 
 Then they blew to lodging, and the knights unarmed
 them and drew them to their dinner; and at the midst
 of their dinner in came Dinadan and began to rail.  Then
 he beheld the haut prince, that seemed wroth with some
 fault that he saw; for he had a custom he loved no fish,
 and because he was served with fish, the which he hated,
 therefore he was not merry.  When Sir Dinadan had
 espied the haut prince, he espied where was a fish with a
 great head, and that he gat betwixt two dishes, and
 served the haut prince with that fish.  And then he said
 thus:  Sir Galahalt, well may I liken you to a wolf, for
 he will never eat fish, but flesh; then the haut prince
 laughed at his words.  Well, well, said Dinadan to
 Launcelot, what devil do ye in this country, for here may
 no mean knights win no worship for thee.  Sir Dinadan,
 said Launcelot, I ensure thee I shall no more meet with
 thee nor with thy great spear, for I may not sit in my
 saddle when that spear hitteth me.  And if I be happy I
 shall beware of that boistous body that thou bearest.
 Well, said Launcelot, make good watch ever:  God
 forbid that ever we meet but if it be at a dish of meat.
 Then laughed the queen and the haut prince, that they
 might not sit at their table; thus they made great joy
 till on the morn, and then they heard mass, and blew to
 field.  And Queen Guenever and all the estates were set,
 and judges armed clean with their shields to keep the
 right.
