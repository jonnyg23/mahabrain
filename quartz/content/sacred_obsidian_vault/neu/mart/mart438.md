 CHAPTER IX
 
 How Sir Launcelot rode to Astolat, and received a sleeve to
 wear upon his helm at the request of a maid.
 
 
 MADAM, said Sir Launcelot, I allow your wit, it is of late
 come since ye were wise.  And therefore, madam, at this
 time I will be ruled by your counsel, and this night I will
 take my rest, and to-morrow by time I will take my way
 toward Winchester.  But wit you well, said Sir Launcelot
 to the queen, that at that jousts I will be against the king,
 and against all his fellowship.  Ye may there do as ye
 list, said the queen, but by my counsel ye shall not be
 against your king and your fellowship.  For therein
 be full many hard knights of your blood, as ye wot well
 enough, it needeth not to rehearse them.  Madam, said
 Sir Launcelot, I pray you that ye be not displeased with
 me, for I will take the adventure that God will send me.
 
 And so upon the morn early Sir Launcelot heard mass
 and brake his fast, and so took his leave of the queen and
 departed.  And then he rode so much until he came to
 Astolat, that is Guildford; and there it happed him in the
 eventide he came to an old baron's place that hight Sir
 Bernard of Astolat.  And as Sir Launcelot entered into
 his lodging, King Arthur espied him as he did walk in a
 garden beside the castle, how he took his lodging, and
 knew him full well.  It is well, said King Arthur unto the
 knights that were with him in that garden beside the
 castle, I have now espied one knight that will play his play
 at the jousts to the which we be gone toward; I undertake
 he will do marvels.  Who is that, we pray you tell
 us? said many knights that were there at that time.  Ye
 shall not wit for me, said the king, as at this time.  And
 so the king smiled, and went to his lodging.
 
 So when Sir Launcelot was in his lodging, and unarmed
 him in his chamber, the old baron and hermit came
 to him making his reverence, and welcomed him in the
 best manner; but the old knight knew not Sir Launcelot.
 Fair sir, said Sir Launcelot to his host, I would pray you
 to lend me a shield that were not openly known, for mine
 is well known.  Sir, said his host, ye shall have your
 desire, for meseemeth ye be one of the likeliest knights of
 the world, and therefore I shall shew you friendship.  Sir,
 wit you well I have two sons that were but late made
 knights, and the eldest hight Sir Tirre, and he was hurt
 that same day he was made knight, that he may not ride,
 and his shield ye shall have; for that is not known I dare
 say but here, and in no place else.  And my youngest son
 hight Lavaine, and if it please you, he shall ride with you
 unto that jousts; and he is of his age strong and wight,
 for much my heart giveth unto you that ye should be a
 noble knight, therefore I pray you, tell me your name,
 said Sir Bernard.  As for that, said Sir Launcelot, ye
 must hold me excused as at this time, and if God give me
 grace to speed well at the jousts I shall come again and
 tell you.  But I pray you, said Sir Launcelot, in any wise
 let me have your son, Sir Lavaine, with me, and that I
 may have his brother's shield.  All this shall be done,
 said Sir Bernard.
 
 This old baron had a daughter that was called that
 time the Fair Maiden of Astolat.  And ever she beheld
 Sir Launcelot wonderfully; and as the book saith, she
 cast such a love unto Sir Launcelot that she could never
 withdraw her love, wherefore she died, and her name was
 Elaine le Blank.  So thus as she came to and fro she was
 so hot in her love that she besought Sir Launcelot to wear
 upon him at the jousts a token of hers.  Fair damosel,
 said Sir Launcelot, an if I grant you that, ye may say I
 do more for your love than ever I did for lady or damosel.
 Then he remembered him he would go to the jousts
 disguised.  And because he had never fore that time
 borne no manner of token of no damosel, then he bethought
 him that he would bear one of her, that none of
 his blood thereby might know him, and then he said:
 Fair maiden, I will grant you to wear a token of yours
 upon mine helmet, and therefore what it is, shew it me.
 Sir, she said, it is a red sleeve of mine, of scarlet, well
 embroidered with great pearls: and so she brought it
 him.  So Sir Launcelot received it, and said:  Never did
 I erst so much for no damosel.  And then Sir Launcelot
 betook the fair maiden his shield in keeping, and prayed
 her to keep that until that he came again; and so that night
 he had merry rest and great cheer, for ever the damosel
 Elaine was about Sir Launcelot all the while she might be
 suffered.
