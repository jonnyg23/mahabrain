 CHAPTER XLVII
 
 How Sir Palomides fought with Corsabrin for a lady, and
 how Palomides slew Corsabrin.
 
 
 SO by fortune this damosel heard tell that Palomides did
 much for damosels' sake; so she sent to him a pensel,
 and prayed him to fight with Sir Corsabrin for her love,
 and he should have her and her lands of her father's
 that should fall to her.  Then the damosel sent unto
 Corsabrin, and bade him go unto Sir Palomides that was
 a paynim as well as he, and she gave him warning that
 she had sent him her pensel, and if he might overcome
 Palomides she would wed him.  When Corsabrin wist
 of her deeds then was he wood wroth and angry, and
 rode unto Surluse where the haut prince was, and there he
 found Sir Palomides ready, the which had the pensel.
 So there they waged battle either with other afore
 Galahalt.  Well, said the haut prince, this day must
 noble knights joust, and at-after dinner we shall see how
 ye can speed.
 
 Then they blew to jousts; and in came Dinadan,
 and met with Sir Gerin, a good knight, and he threw
 him down over his horse's croup; and Sir Dinadan overthrew
 four knights more; and there he did great deeds
 of arms, for he was a good knight, but he was a scoffer
 and a japer, and the merriest knight among fellowship
 that was that time living.  And he had such a custom
 that he loved every good knight, and every good knight
 loved him again.  So then when the haut prince saw
 Dinadan do so well, he sent unto Sir Launcelot and bade
 him strike down Sir Dinadan:  And when that ye have
 done so bring him afore me and the noble Queen
 Guenever.  Then Sir Launcelot did as he was required.
 Then Sir Lamorak and he smote down many knights,
 and raced off helms, and drove all the knights afore
 them.  And so Sir Launcelot smote down Sir Dinadan,
 and made his men to unarm him, and so brought him to
 the queen and the haut prince, and they laughed at
 Dinadan so sore that they might not stand.  Well, said
 Sir Dinadan, yet have I no shame, for the old shrew, Sir
 Launcelot, smote me down.  So they went to dinner, [and]
 all the court had good sport at Dinadan.
 
 Then when the dinner was done they blew to the
 field to behold Sir Palomides and Corsabrin.  Sir Palomides
 pight his pensel in midst of the field; and then they
 hurtled together with their spears as it were thunder, and
 either smote other to the earth.  And then they pulled
 out their swords, and dressed their shields, and lashed
 together mightily as mighty knights, that well-nigh there
 was no piece of harness would hold them, for this Corsabrin
 was a passing felonious knight.  Corsabrin, said
 Palomides, wilt thou release me yonder damosel and the
 pensel?  Then was Corsabrin wroth out of measure, and
 gave Palomides such a buffet that he kneeled on his knee.
 Then Palomides arose lightly, and smote him upon the
 helm that he fell down right to the earth.  And therewith
 he raced off his helm and said:  Corsabrin, yield thee
 or else thou shalt die of my hands.  Fie on thee, said
 Corsabrin, do thy worst.  Then he smote off his head.
 And therewithal came a stink of his body when the soul
 departed, that there might nobody abide the savour.  So
 was the corpse had away and buried in a wood, because
 he was a paynim.  Then they blew unto lodging, and
 Palomides was unarmed.
 
 Then he went unto Queen Guenever, to the haut
 prince, and to Sir Launcelot.  Sir, said the haut prince,
 here have ye seen this day a great miracle by Corsabrin,
 what savour there was when the soul departed from the
 body.  Therefore, sir, we will require you to take the
 baptism upon you, and I promise you all knights will set
 the more by you, and say more worship by you.  Sir,
 said Palomides, I will that ye all know that into this land
 I came to be christened, and in my heart I am christened
 and christened will I be.  But I have made such an avow
 that I may not be christened till I have done seven true
 battles for Jesu's sake, and then will I be christened; and
 I trust God will take mine intent, for I mean truly
 Then Sir Palomides prayed Queen Guenever and the
 haut prince to sup with him.  And so they did, both Sir
 Launcelot and Sir Lamorak, and many other good knights.
 So on the morn they heard their mass, and blew the field,
 and then knights made them ready.
