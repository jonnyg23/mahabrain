 CHAPTER X
 
 How the tourney began at Winchester, and what knights
 were at the jousts; and other things.
 
 
 SO upon a day, on the morn, King Arthur and all his
 knights departed, for their king had tarried three days to
 abide his noble knights.  And so when the king was
 ridden, Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine made them ready to
 ride, and either of them had white shields, and the red
 sleeve Sir Launcelot let carry with him.  And so they
 took their leave at Sir Bernard, the old baron, and at his
 daughter, the Fair Maiden of Astolat.  And then they rode
 so long till that they came to Camelot, that time called
 Winchester; and there was great press of kings, dukes
 earls, and barons, and many noble knights.  But there Sir
 Launcelot was lodged privily by the means of Sir Lavaine
 with a rich burgess, that no man in that town was ware
 what they were.  And so they reposed them there till our
 Lady Day, Assumption, as the great feast should be.  So
 then trumpets blew unto the field, and King Arthur was
 set on high upon a scaffold to behold who did best.  But
 as the French book saith, the king would not suffer Sir
 Gawaine to go from him, for never had Sir Gawaine the
 better an Sir Launcelot were in the field; and many times
 was Sir Gawaine rebuked when Launcelot came into any
 jousts disguised.
 
 Then some of the kings, as King Anguish of Ireland
 and the King of Scots, were that time turned upon the
 side of King Arthur.  And then on the other party was
 the King of Northgalis, and the King with the Hundred
 Knights, and the King of Northumberland, and Sir
 Galahad, the haut prince.  But these three kings and this
 duke were passing weak to hold against King Arthur's
 party, for with him were the noblest knights of the world.
 So then they withdrew them either party from other, and
 every man made him ready in his best manner to do what
 he might.
 
 Then Sir Launcelot made him ready, and put the red
 sleeve upon his head, and fastened it fast; and so Sir
 Launcelot and Sir Lavaine departed out of Winchester
 privily, and rode until a little leaved wood behind the
 party that held against King Arthur's party, and there
 they held them still till the parties smote together.  And
 then came in the King of Scots and the King of Ireland
 on Arthur's party, and against them came the King of
 Northumberland, and the King with the Hundred Knights
 smote down the King of Northumberland, and the King
 with the Hundred Knights smote down King Anguish of
 Ireland.  Then Sir Palomides that was on Arthur's party
 encountered with Sir Galahad, and either of them smote
 down other, and either party halp their lords on horseback
 again.  So there began a strong assail upon both parties.
 And then came in Sir Brandiles, Sir Sagramore le Desirous,
 Sir Dodinas le Savage, Sir Kay le Seneschal, Sir Griflet le
 Fise de Dieu, Sir Mordred, Sir Meliot de Logris, Sir
 Ozanna le Cure Hardy, Sir Safere, Sir Epinogris, Sir
 Galleron of Galway.  All these fifteen knights were
 knights of the Table Round.  So these with more other
 came in together, and beat aback the King of Northumberland
 and the King of Northgalis.  When Sir Launcelot
 saw this, as he hoved in a little leaved wood, then he said
 unto Sir Lavaine:  See yonder is a company of good
 knights, and they hold them together as boars that were
 chafed with dogs.  That is truth, said Sir Lavaine.
