 CHAPTER XV
 
 How Sir Bleoberis demanded the fairest lady in King Mark's
 court, whom he took away, and how he was fought with.
 
 THEN it befell upon a day that the good knight Bleoberis de
 Ganis, brother to Blamore de Ganis, and nigh cousin unto the good
 knight Sir Launcelot du Lake, this Bleoberis came unto the court
 of King Mark, and there he asked of King Mark a boon, to give him
 what gift that he would ask in his court.  When the king heard
 him ask so, he marvelled of his asking, but because he was a
 knight of the Round Table, and of a great renown, King Mark
 granted him his whole asking.  Then, said Sir Bleoberis, I will
 have the fairest lady in your court that me list to choose.  I
 may not say nay, said King Mark; now choose at your adventure. 
 And so Sir Bleoberis did choose Sir Segwarides' wife, and took
 her by the hand, and so went his way with her; and so he took his
 horse and gart set her behind his squire, and rode upon his way.
 
 When Sir Segwarides heard tell that his lady was gone with a
 knight of King Arthur's court, then he armed him and rode after
 that knight for to rescue his lady.  So when Bleoberis was gone
 with this lady, King Mark and all the court was wroth that she
 was away.  Then were there certain ladies that knew that there
 were great love between Sir Tristram and her, and also that lady
 loved Sir Tristram above all other knights.  Then there was one
 lady that rebuked Sir Tristram in the horriblest wise, and called
 him coward knight, that he would for shame of his knighthood see
 a lady so shamefully be taken away from his uncle's court.  But
 she meant that either of them had loved other with entire heart. 
 But Sir Tristram &lt;304&gt;answered her thus:  Fair lady, it is not my
 part to have ado in such matters while her lord and husband is
 present here; and if it had been that her lord had not been here
 in this court, then for the worship of this court peradventure I
 would have been her champion, and if so be Sir Segwarides speed
 not well, it may happen that I will speak with that good knight
 or ever he pass from this country.
 
 Then within a while came one of Sir Segwarides' squires, and told
 in the court that Sir Segwarides was beaten sore and wounded to
 the point of death; as he would have rescued his lady Sir
 Bleoberis overthrew him and sore hath wounded him.  Then was King
 Mark heavy thereof, and all the court.  When Sir Tristram heard
 of this he was ashamed and sore grieved; and then was he soon
 armed and on horseback, and Gouvernail, his servant, bare his
 shield and spear.  And so as Sir Tristram rode fast he met with
 Sir Andred his cousin, that by the commandment of King Mark was
 sent to bring forth, an ever it lay in his power, two knights of
 Arthur's court, that rode by the country to seek their
 adventures.  When Sir Tristram saw Sir Andred he asked him what
 tidings.  So God me help, said Sir Andred, there was never worse
 with me, for here by the commandment of King Mark I was sent to
 fetch two knights of King Arthur's court, and that one beat me
 and wounded me, and set nought by my message.  Fair cousin, said
 Sir Tristram, ride on your way, and if I may meet them it may
 happen I shall revenge you.  So Sir Andred rode into Cornwall,
 and Sir Tristram rode after the two knights, the which one hight
 Sagramore le Desirous, and the other hight Dodinas le Savage.
