 CHAPTER XI
 
 How a servant of Sir Aglovale's was slain, and what vengeance
 Sir Aglovale and Sir Percivale did therefore.
 
 
 AND when she was awaked she sent a squire after them
 with spending enough.  And so when the squire had overtaken
 them, they would not suffer him to ride with them,
 but sent him home again to comfort their mother, praying
 her meekly of her blessing.  And so this squire was
 benighted, and by misfortune he happened to come to a
 castle where dwelled a baron.  And so when the squire
 was come into the castle, the lord asked him from whence
 he came, and whom he served.  My lord, said the squire,
 I serve a good knight that is called Sir Aglovale: the
 squire said it to good intent, weening unto him to have
 been more forborne for Sir Aglovale's sake, than he had
 said he had served the queen, Aglovale's mother.  Well,
 my fellow, said the lord of that castle, for Sir Aglovale's
 sake thou shalt have evil lodging, for Sir Aglovale slew my
 brother, and therefore thou shalt die on part of payment.
 And then that lord commanded his men to have him away
 and slay him; and so they did, and so pulled him out of
 the castle, and there they slew him without mercy.
 
 Right so on the morn came Sir Aglovale and Sir Percivale
 riding by a churchyard, where men and women were
 busy, and beheld the dead squire, and they thought to bury
 him.  What is there, said Sir Aglovale, that ye behold so
 fast?  A good man stert forth and said:  Fair knight, here
 lieth a squire slain shamefully this night.  How was he
 slain, fair fellow? said Sir Aglovale.  My fair sir, said the
 man, the lord of this castle lodged this squire this night;
 and because he said he was servant unto a good knight
 that is with King Arthur, his name is Sir Aglovale,
 therefore the lord commanded to slay him, and for this cause is
 he slain.  Gramercy, said Sir Aglovale, and ye shall see
 his death revenged lightly; for I am that same knight for
 whom this squire was slain.
 
 Then Sir Aglovale called unto him Sir Percivale, and
 bade him alight lightly; and so they alighted both, and
 betook their horses to their men, and so they yede on foot
 into the castle.  And all so soon as they were within the
 castle gate Sir Aglovale bade the porter:  Go thou unto thy
 lord and tell him that I am Sir Aglovale for whom this
 squire was slain this night.  Anon the porter told this to
 his lord, whose name was Goodewin.  Anon he armed him,
 and then he came into the court and said:  Which of you
 is Sir Aglovale?  Here I am, said Aglovale: for what
 cause slewest thou this night my mother's squire?  I slew
 him, said Sir Goodewin, because of thee, for thou slewest
 my brother, Sir Gawdelin.  As for thy brother, said Sir
 Aglovale, I avow it I slew him, for he was a false knight
 and a betrayer of ladies and of good knights; and for the
 death of my squire thou shalt die.  I defy thee, said Sir
 Goodewin.  Then they lashed together as eagerly as it
 had been two lions, and Sir Percivale he fought with all the
 remnant that would fight.  And within a while Sir Percivale
 had slain all that would withstand him; for Sir Percivale
 dealt so his strokes that were so rude that there durst
 no man abide him.  And within a while Sir Aglovale had
 Sir Goodewin at the earth, and there he unlaced his helm,
 and struck off his head.  And then they departed and took
 their horses; and then they let carry the dead squire unto
 a priory, and there they interred him.
