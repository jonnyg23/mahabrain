 CHAPTER V
 
 How Tristram enterprized the battle to fight for the truage of
 Cornwall, and how he was made knight.
 
 THEREWITHAL Tristram went unto his father, King Meliodas, and
 asked him counsel what was best to do for to recover Cornwall
 from truage.  For, as meseemeth, said Sir Tristram, it were shame
 that Sir Marhaus, the queen's brother of Ireland, should go away
 unless that he were foughten withal.  As for that, said King
 Meliodas, wit you well, son Tristram, that Sir Marhaus is called
 one of the best knights of the world, and Knight of the Table
 Round; and therefore I know no knight in this country that is
 able to match with him.  Alas, said Sir Tristram, that I am not
 made knight; and if Sir Marhaus should thus depart into Ireland,
 God let me never have worship: an I were made knight I should
 match him.  And sir, said Tristram, I pray you give me leave to
 ride to King Mark; and, so ye be not displeased, of King Mark
 will I be made knight.  I will well, said King Meliodas, that ye
 be ruled as your courage will rule you.  Then Sir Tristram
 thanked his father much.  And then he made him ready to ride into
 Cornwall.
 
 In the meanwhile there came a messenger with letters of love from
 King Faramon of France's daughter unto Sir Tristram, that were
 full piteous letters, and in them were written many complaints of
 love; but Sir Tristram had no joy of her letters nor regard unto
 her.  Also she sent him a little brachet that was passing fair. 
 But when the king's daughter understood that Sir Tristram would
 not love her, as the book saith, she died for sorrow.  And then
 the same squire that brought the letter and the brachet came
 again unto Sir Tristram, as after ye shall hear in the tale.
 
 So this young Sir Tristram rode unto his eme, King Mark of
 Cornwall.  And when he came there he heard say that there would
 no knight fight with Sir Marhaus.  &lt;286&gt;Then yede Sir Tristram
 unto his eme and said:  Sir, if ye will give me the order of
 knighthood, I will do battle with Sir Marhaus.  What are ye, said
 the king, and from whence be ye come?  Sir, said Tristram, I come
 from King Meliodas that wedded your sister, and a gentleman wit
 ye well I am.  King Mark beheld Sir Tristram and saw that he was
 but a young man of age, but he was passingly well made and big. 
 Fair sir, said the king, what is your name, and where were ye
 born?  Sir, said he again, my name is Tristram, and in the
 country of Liones was I born.  Ye say well, said the king; and if
 ye will do this battle I shall make you knight.  Therefore I come
 to you, said Sir Tristram, and for none other cause.  But then
 King Mark made him knight.  And therewithal, anon as he had made
 him knight, he sent a messenger unto Sir Marhaus with letters
 that said that he had found a young knight ready for to take the
 battle to the uttermost.  It may well be, said Sir Marhaus; but
 tell King Mark I will not fight with no knight but he be of blood
 royal, that is to say, other king's son, other queen's son, born
 of a prince or princess.
 
 When King Mark understood that, he sent for Sir Tristram de
 Liones and told him what was the answer of Sir Marhaus.  Then
 said Sir Tristram:  Sithen that he saith so, let him wit that I
 am come of father side and mother side of as noble blood as he
 is: for, sir, now shall ye know that I am King Meliodas' son,
 born of your own sister, Dame Elizabeth, that died in the forest
 in the birth of me.  O Jesu, said King Mark, ye are welcome fair
 nephew to me.  Then in all the haste the king let horse Sir
 Tristram, and armed him in the best manner that might be had or
 gotten for gold or silver.  And then King Mark sent unto Sir
 Marhaus, and did him to wit that a better born man than he was
 himself should fight with him, and his name is Sir Tristram de
 Liones, gotten of King Meliodas, and born of King Mark's sister. 
 Then was Sir Marhaus glad and blithe that he should fight with
 such a gentleman.  And so by the assent of King Mark and of Sir
 Marhaus they let ordain that they &lt;287&gt;should fight within an
 island nigh Sir Marhaus' ships; and so was Sir Tristram put into
 a vessel both his horse and he, and all that to him longed both
 for his body and for his horse.  Sir Tristram lacked nothing. 
 And when King Mark and his barons of Cornwall beheld how young
 Sir Tristram departed with such a carriage to fight for the right
 of Cornwall, there was neither man nor woman of worship but they
 wept to see and understand so young a knight to jeopardy himself
 for their right.
