 CHAPTER VIII
 
 How La Cote Male Taile was taken prisoner, and after
 rescued by Sir Launcelot, and how Sir Launcelot overcame
 four brethren.
 
 THIS meanwhile Sir La Cote Male Taile sank right down upon the
 earth, what for-wounded and what for-bled he might not stand. 
 Then the other knight had pity of him, and said:  Fair young
 knight, dismay you not, for had ye been fresh when ye met with
 me, as I was, I wot well that I should not have endured so long
 as ye have done; and &lt;365&gt;therefore for your noble deeds of arms
 I shall show to you kindness and gentleness in all that I may. 
 And forthwithal this noble knight, Sir Plenorius, took him up in
 his arms, and led him into his tower.  And then he commanded him
 the wine, and made to search him and to stop his bleeding wounds. 
 Sir, said La Cote Male Taile, withdraw you from me, and hie you
 to yonder bridge again, for there will meet with you another
 manner knight than ever was I.  Why, said Plenorius, is there
 another manner knight behind of your fellowship?  Yea, said La
 Cote Male Taile, there is a much better knight than I am.  What
 is his name? said Plenorius.  Ye shall not know for me, said La
 Cote Male Taile.  Well, said the knight, he shall be encountered
 withal whatsomever he be.
 
 Then Sir Plenorius heard a knight call that said:  Sir Plenorius,
 where art thou? either thou must deliver me the prisoner that
 thou hast led unto thy tower, or else come and do battle with me. 
 Then Plenorius gat his horse, and came with a spear in his hand
 walloping toward Sir Launcelot; and then they began to feutre
 their spears, and came together as thunder, and smote either
 other so mightily that their horses fell down under them.  And
 then they avoided their horses, and pulled out their swords, and
 like two bulls they lashed together with great strokes and foins;
 but ever Sir Launcelot recovered ground upon him, and Sir
 Plenorius traced to have gone about him.  But Sir Launcelot would
 not suffer that, but bare him backer and backer, till he came
 nigh his tower gate.  And then said Sir Launcelot:  I know thee
 well for a good knight, but wit thou well thy life and death is
 in my hand, and therefore yield thee to me, and thy prisoner. 
 The other answered no word, but struck mightily upon Sir
 Launcelot's helm, that the fire sprang out of his eyes.  Then Sir
 Launcelot doubled his strokes so thick, and smote at him so
 mightily, that he made him kneel upon his knees.  And therewith
 Sir Launcelot leapt upon him, and pulled him grovelling down. 
 Then Sir Plenorius yielded him, and his tower, and all his
 prisoners at his will.
 
 Then Sir Launcelot received him and took his troth; &lt;366&gt;and then
 he rode to the other bridge, and there Sir Launcelot jousted with
 other three of his brethren, the one hight Pillounes, and the
 other hight Pellogris, and the third Sir Pellandris.  And first
 upon horseback Sir Launcelot smote them down, and afterward he
 beat them on foot, and made them to yield them unto him; and then
 he returned unto Sir Plenorius, and there he found in his prison
 King Carados of Scotland, and many other knights, and all they
 were delivered.  And then Sir La Cote Male Taile came to Sir
 Launcelot, and then Sir Launcelot would have given him all these
 fortresses and these bridges.  Nay, said La Cote Male Taile, I
 will not have Sir Plenorius' livelihood; with that he will grant
 you, my lord Sir Launcelot, to come unto King Arthur's court, and
 to be his knight, and all his brethren, I will pray you, my lord,
 to let him have his livelihood.  I will well, said Sir Launcelot,
 with this that he will come to the court of King Arthur and
 become his man, and his brethren five.  And as for you, Sir
 Plenorius, I will undertake, said Sir Launcelot, at the next
 feast, so there be a place voided, that ye shall be Knight of the
 Round Table.  Sir, said Plenorius, at the next feast of Pentecost
 I will be at Arthur's court, and at that time I will be guided
 and ruled as King Arthur and ye will have me.  Then Sir Launcelot
 and Sir La Cote Male Taile reposed them there, unto the time that
 Sir La Cote Male Taile was whole of his wounds, and there they
 had merry cheer, and good rest, and many good games, and there
 were many fair ladies.
