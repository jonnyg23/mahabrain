 CHAPTER XIX[*1]
 
 [*1] Misnumbered xx.  by Caxton.
 
 How Sir Marhaus, Sir Gawaine, and Sir Uwaine met
 three damosels, and each of them took one.
 
 NOW shall everych of us choose a damosel.  I shall tell you, said
 Sir Uwaine, I am the youngest and most weakest of you both,
 therefore I will have the eldest damosel, for &lt;132&gt;she hath seen
 much, and can best help me when I have need, for I have most need
 of help of you both.  Now, said Sir Marhaus, I will have the
 damosel of thirty winter age, for she falleth best to me.  Well,
 said Sir Gawaine, I thank you, for ye have left me the youngest
 and the fairest, and she is most liefest to me.  Then every
 damosel took her knight by the reins of his bridle, and brought
 him to the three ways, and there was their oath made to meet at
 the fountain that day twelvemonth an they were living, and so
 they kissed and departed, and each knight set his lady behind
 him.  And Sir Uwaine took the way that lay west, and Sir Marhaus
 took the way that lay south, and Sir Gawaine took the way that
 lay north.  Now will we begin at Sir Gawaine, that held that way
 till that he came unto a fair manor, where dwelled an old knight
 and a good householder, and there Sir Gawaine asked the knight if
 he knew any adventures in that country.  I shall show you some
 to-morn, said the old knight, and that marvellous.  So, on the
 morn they rode into the forest of adventures to a laund, and
 thereby they found a cross, and as they stood and hoved there
 came by them the fairest knight and the seemliest man that ever
 they saw, making the greatest dole that ever man made.  And then
 he was ware of Sir Gawaine, and saluted him, and prayed God to
 send him much worship.  As to that, said Sir Gawaine, gramercy;
 also I pray to God that he send you honour and worship.  Ah, said
 the knight, I may lay that aside, for sorrow and shame cometh to
 me after worship.
