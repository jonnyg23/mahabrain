 CHAPTER XXX
 
 How Sir Gareth was espied by the heralds, and how he
 escaped out of the field.
 
 BUT before he was in so many colours, and now he is but in one
 colour; that is yellow.  Now go, said King Arthur &lt;266&gt;unto
 divers heralds, and ride about him, and espy what manner knight
 he is, for I have spered of many knights this day that be upon
 his party, and all say they know him not.  And so an herald rode
 nigh Gareth as he could; and there he saw written about his helm
 in gold, This helm is Sir Gareth of Orkney.  Then the herald
 cried as he were wood, and many heralds with him:--This is Sir
 Gareth of Orkney in the yellow arms; wherby[*4] all kings and
 knights of Arthur's beheld him and awaited; and then they pressed
 all to behold him, and ever the heralds cried:  This is Sir
 Gareth of Orkney, King Lot's son.  And when Sir Gareth espied
 that he was discovered, then he doubled his strokes, and smote
 down Sir Sagramore, and his brother Sir Gawaine.  O brother, said
 Sir Gawaine, I weened ye would not have stricken me.
 
 
 [*4] So W. de Worde; Caxton ``that by.''
 
 
 
 So when he heard him say so he thrang here and there, and so with
 great pain he gat out of the press, and there he met with his
 dwarf.  O boy, said Sir Gareth, thou hast beguiled me foul this
 day that thou kept my ring; give it me anon again, that I may
 hide my body withal; and so he took it him.  And then they all
 wist not where he was become; and Sir Gawaine had in manner
 espied where Sir Gareth rode, and then he rode after with all his
 might.  That espied Sir Gareth, and rode lightly into the forest,
 that Sir Gawaine wist not where he was become.  And when Sir
 Gareth wist that Sir Gawaine was passed, he asked the dwarf of
 best counsel.  Sir, said the dwarf, meseemeth it were best, now
 that ye are escaped from spying, that ye send my lady Dame
 Lionesse her ring.  It is well advised, said Sir Gareth; now have
 it here and bear it to her, and say that I recommend me unto her
 good grace, and say her I will come when I may, and I pray her to
 be true and faithful to me as I will be to her.  Sir, said the
 dwarf, it shall be done as ye command: and so he rode his way,
 and did his errand unto the lady.  Then she said, Where is my
 knight, Sir Gareth?  Madam, said the dwarf, he bade me say that
 he would not be long from you.  And so lightly the dwarf came
 again unto Sir Gareth, that would full fain &lt;267&gt;have had a
 lodging, for he had need to be reposed.  And then fell there a
 thunder and a rain, as heaven and earth should go together.  And
 Sir Gareth was not a little weary, for of all that day he had but
 little rest, neither his horse nor he.  So this Sir Gareth rode
 so long in that forest until the night came.  And ever it
 lightened and thundered, as it had been wood.  At the last by
 fortune he came to a castle, and there he heard the waits upon
 the walls.
