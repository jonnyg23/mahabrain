 CHAPTER XII
 
 How Sir Gawaine returned to King Arthur with his prisoners,
 and how the King won a city, and how he was crowned Emperor.
 
 NOW thanked be God, said the noble King Arthur.  But what manner
 man is he that standeth by himself, him seemeth no prisoner. 
 Sir, said Gawaine, this is a good man of arms, he hath matched
 me, but he is yielden unto &lt;172&gt;God, and to me, for to become
 Christian; had not he have been we should never have returned,
 wherefore I pray you that he may be baptised, for there liveth
 not a nobler man nor better knight of his hands.  Then the king
 let him anon be christened, and did do call him his first name
 Priamus, and made him a duke and knight of the Table Round.  And
 then anon the king let do cry assault to the city, and there was
 rearing of ladders, breaking of walls, and the ditch filled, that
 men with little pain might enter into the city.  Then came out a
 duchess, and Clarisin the countess, with many ladies and
 damosels, and kneeling before King Arthur, required him for the
 love of God to receive the city, and not to take it by assault,
 for then should many guiltless be slain.  Then the king avaled
 his visor with a meek and noble countenance, and said, Madam,
 there shall none of my subjects misdo you nor your maidens, nor
 to none that to you belong, but the duke shall abide my judgment. 
 Then anon the king commanded to leave the assault, and anon the
 duke's oldest son brought out the keys, and kneeling delivered
 them to the king, and besought him of grace; and the king seized
 the town by assent of his lords, and took the duke and sent him
 to Dover, there for to abide prisoner term of his life, and
 assigned certain rents for the dower of the duchess and for her
 children.
 
 Then he made lords to rule those lands, and laws as a lord ought
 to do in his own country; and after he took his journey toward
 Rome, and sent Sir Floris and Sir Floridas to-fore, with five
 hundred men of arms, and they came to the city of Urbino and laid
 there a bushment, thereas them seemed most best for them, and
 rode to-fore the town, where anon issued out much people and
 skirmished with the fore-riders.  Then brake out the bushment and
 won the bridge, and after the town, and set upon the walls the
 king's banner.  Then came the king upon an hill, and saw the city
 and his banner on the walls, by which he knew that the city was
 won.  And anon he sent and commanded that none of his liege men
 should defoul nor lie by no lady, wife nor maid; and when he came
 &lt;173&gt;into the city, he passed to the castle, and comforted them
 that were in sorrow, and ordained there a captain, a knight of
 his own country.
 
 And when they of Milan heard that thilk city was won, they sent
 to King Arthur great sums of money, and besought him as their
 lord to have pity on them, promising to be his subjects for ever,
 and yield to him homage and fealty for the lands of Pleasance and
 Pavia, Petersaint, and the Port of Tremble, and to give him
 yearly a million of gold all his lifetime.  Then he rideth into
 Tuscany, and winneth towns and castles, and wasted all in his way
 that to him will not obey, and so to Spolute and Viterbe, and
 from thence he rode into the Vale of Vicecount among the vines. 
 And from thence he sent to the senators, to wit whether they
 would know him for their lord.  But soon after on a Saturday came
 unto King Arthur all the senators that were left alive, and the
 noblest cardinals that then dwelt in Rome, and prayed him of
 peace, and proferred him full large, and besought him as governor
 to give licence for six weeks for to assemble all the Romans, and
 then to crown him emperor with chrism as it belongeth to so high
 estate.  I assent, said the king, like as ye have devised, and at
 Christmas there to be crowned, and to hold my Round Table with my
 knights as me liketh.  And then the senators made ready for his
 enthronization.  And at the day appointed, as the romance
 telleth, he came into Rome, and was crowned emperor by the pope's
 hand, with all the royalty that could be made, and sojourned
 there a time, and established all his lands from Rome into
 France, and gave lands and realms unto his servants and knights,
 to everych after his desert, in such wise that none complained,
 rich nor poor.  And he gave to Sir Priamus the duchy of Lorraine;
 and he thanked him, and said he would serve him the days of his
 life; and after made dukes and earls, and made every man rich.
 
 Then after this all his knights and lords assembled them afore
 him, and said:  Blessed be God, your war is finished and your
 conquest achieved, in so much that we &lt;174&gt;know none so great nor
 mighty that dare make war against you: wherefore we beseech you
 to return homeward, and give us licence to go home to our wives,
 from whom we have been long, and to rest us, for your journey is
 finished with honour and worship.  Then said the king, Ye say
 truth, and for to tempt God it is no wisdom, and therefore make
 you ready and return we into England.  Then there was trussing of
 harness and baggage and great carriage.  And after licence given,
 he returned and commanded that no man in pain of death should not
 rob nor take victual, nor other thing by the way but that he
 should pay therefore.  And thus he came over the sea and landed
 at Sandwich, against whom Queen Guenever his wife came and met
 him, and he was nobly received of all his commons in every city
 and burgh, and great gifts presented to him at his home-coming to
 welcome him with.
 
 Thus endeth the fifth book of the conquest that King Arthur
 had against Lucius the Emperor of Rome,  and here
 followeth the sixth book, which is of Sir Launcelot
 du Lake.
