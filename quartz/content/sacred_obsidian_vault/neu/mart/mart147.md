 CHAPTER XXIX
 
 Yet of the said tournament.
 
 THEN when this was done there was drawing of swords, and then
 there began a sore tournament.  And there did Sir Lamorak
 marvellous deeds of arms; and betwixt Sir Lamorak and Sir
 Ironside, that was the Red Knight of the Red Launds, there was
 strong battle; and betwixt Sir Palamides and Bleoberis there was
 a strong battle; and Sir Gawaine and Sir Tristram met, and there
 Sir Gawaine had the worse, for he pulled Sir Gawaine from his
 horse, and there he was long upon foot, and defouled. Then came
 in Sir Launcelot, and he smote Sir Turquine, and he him; and then
 came Sir Carados his brother, and both at once they assailed him,
 and he as the most noblest knight of the world worshipfully
 fought with them both, that all men wondered of the noblesse of
 Sir Launcelot. And then came in Sir Gareth, and knew that it was
 Sir Launcelot that fought with the two perilous knights. And then
 Sir Gareth came with his good horse and hurtled them in-sunder,
 and no stroke would he smite to Sir Launcelot.  That espied Sir
 Launcelot, and deemed it should be the good knight Sir Gareth:
 and then Sir Gareth rode here and there, and smote on the right
 hand and on the left hand, and all the folk might well espy where
 that he rode.  And by fortune he met with his brother Sir
 Gawaine, and there he put Sir Gawaine to the worse, for he put
 off his helm, and so he served five or six knights of the Round
 Table, that all men said he put him in the most pain, and best he
 did his devoir.  For when Sir Tristram beheld him how he first
 jousted and after fought so well with a sword, then he rode unto
 Sir Ironside and to Sir Persant of Inde, and asked them, by their
 faith, What manner a knight is yonder knight that seemeth in so
 many divers colours?  Truly, meseemeth, said Tristram, that he
 putteth himself in great pain, for he &lt;265&gt;never ceaseth.  Wot ye
 not what he is? said Sir Ironside.  No, said Sir Tristram.  Then
 shall ye know that this is he that loveth the lady of the castle,
 and she him again; and this is he that won me when I besieged the
 lady of this castle, and this is he that won Sir Persant of Inde,
 and his three brethren.  What is his name, said Sir Tristram, and
 of what blood is he come?  He was called in the court of King
 Arthur, Beaumains, but his right name is Sir Gareth of Orkney,
 brother to Sir Gawaine.  By my head, said Sir Tristram, he is a
 good knight, and a big man of arms, and if he be young he shall
 prove a full noble knight.  He is but a child, they all said, and
 of Sir Launcelot he was made knight.  Therefore he is mickle the
 better, said Tristram.  And then Sir Tristram, Sir Ironside, Sir
 Persant, and his brother, rode together for to help Sir Gareth;
 and then there were given many strong strokes.
 
 And then Sir Gareth rode out on the one side to amend his helm;
 and then said his dwarf:  Take me your ring, that ye lose it not
 while that ye drink.  And so when he had drunk he gat on his
 helm, and eagerly took his horse and rode into the field, and
 left his ring with his dwarf; and the dwarf was glad the ring was
 from him, for then he wist well he should be known.  And then
 when Sir Gareth was in the field all folks saw him well and
 plainly that he was in yellow colours; and there he rased off
 helms and pulled down knights, that King Arthur had marvel what
 knight he was, for the king saw by his hair that it was the same
 knight.
