 CHAPTER XXXIV
 
 How Sir Launcelot hurt Sir Tristram, and how after
 Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palomides.
 
 THEN this cry was so large that Sir Launcelot heard it.  And then
 he gat a great spear in his hand and came towards the cry.  Then
 Sir Launcelot cried:  The Knight with the Black Shield, make thee
 ready to joust with me.  When Sir Tristram heard him say so he
 gat his spear in his hand, and either abashed down their heads,
 and came together as thunder; and Sir Tristram's spear brake in
 pieces, and Sir Launcelot by malfortune struck Sir Tristram on
 the side a deep wound nigh to the death; but yet Sir Tristram
 avoided not his saddle, and so the spear brake.  Therewithal Sir
 Tristram that was wounded gat out his sword, and he rushed to Sir
 Launcelot, and gave him three great strokes upon the helm that
 the fire sprang thereout, and Sir Launcelot abashed his head
 lowly toward his saddle-bow.  And therewithal Sir Tristram
 departed from the field, for he felt him so wounded that he
 weened he should have died; and Sir Dinadan espied him and
 followed him into the forest.  Then Sir Launcelot abode and did
 many marvellous deeds.
 
 So when Sir Tristram was departed by the forest's side he
 alighted, and unlaced his harness and freshed his wound; then
 weened Sir Dinadan that he should have died.  Nay, nay, said Sir
 Tristram, Dinadan never dread &lt;412&gt;thee, for I am heart-whole,
 and of this wound I shall soon be whole, by the mercy of God.  By
 that Sir Dinadan was ware where came Palomides riding straight
 upon them.  And then Sir Tristram was ware that Sir Palomides
 came to have destroyed him.  And so Sir Dinadan gave him warning,
 and said: Sir Tristram, my lord, ye are so sore wounded that ye
 may not have ado with him, therefore I will ride against him and
 do to him what I may, and if I be slain ye may pray for my soul;
 and in the meanwhile ye may withdraw you and go into the castle,
 or in the forest, that he shall not meet with you.  Sir Tristram
 smiled and said:  I thank you, Sir Dinadan, of your good will,
 but ye shall wit that I am able to handle him.  And then anon
 hastily he armed him, and took his horse, and a great spear in
 his hand, and said to Sir Dinadan:  Adieu; and rode toward Sir
 Palomides a soft pace.  Then when Sir Palomides saw that, he made
 countenance to amend his horse, but he did it for this cause, for
 he abode Sir Gaheris that came after him.  And when he was come
 he rode toward Sir Tristram.  Then Sir Tristram sent unto Sir
 Palomides, and required him to joust with him; and if he smote
 down Sir Palomides he would do no more to him; and if it so
 happened that Sir Palomides smote down Sir Tristram, he bade him
 do his utterance.  So they were accorded.  Then they met
 together, and Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palomides that he had a
 grievous fall, so that he lay still as he had been dead.  And
 then Sir Tristram ran upon Sir Gaheris, and he would not have
 jousted; but whether he would or not Sir Tristram smote him over
 his horse's croup, that he lay still as though he had been dead. 
 And then Sir Tristram rode his way and left Sir Persides' squire
 within the pavilions, and Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode to an
 old knight's place to lodge them.  And that old knight had five
 sons at the tournament, for whom he prayed God heartily for their
 coming home.  And so, as the French book saith, they came home
 all five well beaten.
 
 And when Sir Tristram departed into the forest Sir &lt;413&gt;Launcelot
 held alway the stour like hard, as a man araged that took no heed
 to himself, and wit ye well there was many a noble knight against
 him.  And when King Arthur saw Sir Launcelot do so marvellous
 deeds of arms he then armed him, and took his horse and his
 armour, and rode into the field to help Sir Launcelot; and so
 many knights came in with King Arthur.  And to make short tale in
 conclusion, the King of Northgalis and the King of the Hundred
 Knights were put to the worse; and because Sir Launcelot abode
 and was the last in the field the prize was given him.  But Sir
 Launcelot would neither for king, queen, nor knight, have the
 prize, but where the cry was cried through the field:  Sir
 Launcelot, Sir Launcelot hath won the field this day, Sir
 Launcelot let make another cry contrary:  Sir Tristram hath won
 the field, for he began first, and last he hath endured, and so
 hath he done the first day, the second, and the third day.
