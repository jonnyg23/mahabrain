 CHAPTER XXXIII
 
 How Sir Lamorak jousted with thirty knights, and Sir Tristram
 at the request of King Mark smote his horse down.
 
 THE king and the queen made their pavilions and their tents in
 that forest beside a river, and there was daily hunting and
 jousting, for there were ever thirty knights ready to joust unto
 all them that came in at that time.  And there by fortune came
 Sir Lamorak de Galis and Sir Driant; and there Sir Driant jousted
 right well, but at the last he had a fall.  Then Sir Lamorak
 proffered to joust.  And when he began he fared so with the
 thirty knights that there was not one of them but that he gave
 him a fall, and some of them were sore hurt.  I marvel, said King
 Mark, what knight he is that doth such deeds of arms.  Sir, said
 Sir Tristram, I know him well for a noble knight as few now be
 living, and his name is Sir Lamorak de Galis.  It were great
 shame, said the king, that he should go thus away, unless that
 some of you meet with him better.  Sir, said Sir Tristram,
 meseemeth it were no worship for a noble man to have ado with
 him: and for because at this time he hath done over much for any
 mean knight living, therefore, as meseemeth, it were great shame
 and villainy to tempt him any more at this time, insomuch as he
 and his horse are weary both; for the &lt;334&gt;deeds of arms that he
 hath done this day, an they be well considered, it were enough
 for Sir Launcelot du Lake.  As for that, said King Mark, I
 require you, as ye love me and my lady the queen, La Beale Isoud,
 take your arms and joust with Sir Lamorak de Galis.  Sir, said
 Sir Tristram, ye bid me do a thing that is against knighthood,
 and well I can deem that I shall give him a fall, for it is no
 mastery, for my horse and I be fresh both, and so is not his
 horse and he; and wit ye well that he will take it for great
 unkindness, for ever one good knight is loath to take another at
 disadvantage; but because I will not displease you, as ye require
 me so will I do, and obey your commandment.
 
 And so Sir Tristram armed him and took his horse, and put him
 forth, and there Sir Lamorak met him mightily, and what with the
 might of his own spear, and of Sir Tristram's spear, Sir
 Lamorak's horse fell to the earth, and he sitting in the saddle. 
 Then anon as lightly as he might he avoided the saddle and his
 horse, and put his shield afore him and drew his sword.  And then
 he bade Sir Tristram:  Alight, thou knight, an thou durst.  Nay,
 said Sir Tristram, I will no more have ado with thee, for I have
 done to thee over much unto my dishonour and to thy worship.  As
 for that, said Sir Lamorak, I can thee no thank; since thou hast
 for-jousted me on horseback I require thee and I beseech thee, an
 thou be Sir Tristram, fight with me on foot.  I will not so, said
 Sir Tristram; and wit ye well my name is Sir Tristram de Liones,
 and well I know ye be Sir Lamorak de Galis, and this that I have
 done to you was against my will, but I was required thereto; but
 to say that I will do at your request as at this time, I will
 have no more ado with you, for me shameth of that I have done. 
 As for the shame, said Sir Lamorak, on thy part or on mine, bear
 thou it an thou wilt, for though a mare's son hath failed me, now
 a queen's son shall not fail thee; and therefore, an thou be such
 a knight as men call thee, I require thee, alight, and fight with
 me.  Sir Lamorak, said Sir Tristram, I understand your heart is
 great, and cause why ye have, to &lt;335&gt;say thee sooth; for it
 would grieve me an any knight should keep him fresh and then to
 strike down a weary knight, for that knight nor horse was never
 formed that alway might stand or endure.  And therefore, said Sir
 Tristram, I will not have ado with you, for me forthinketh of
 that I have done.  As for that, said Sir Lamorak, I shall quit
 you, an ever I see my time.
