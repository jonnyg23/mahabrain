 CHAPTER XII
 
 Of the marvel that Sir Galahad saw and heard in the
 tomb, and how he made Melias knight.
 
 
 NOW lead me thither, said Galahad.  And so they did, all
 armed save his helm.  Now, said the good man, go to
 the tomb and lift it up.  So he did, and heard a great
 noise; and piteously he said, that all men might hear it:
 Sir Galahad, the servant of Jesu Christ, come thou not
 nigh me, for thou shalt make me go again there where I
 have been so long.  But Galahad was nothing afraid, but
 lifted up the stone; and there came out so foul a smoke,
 and after he saw the foulest figure leap thereout that ever
 he saw in the likeness of a man; and then he blessed him
 and wist well it was a fiend.  Then heard he a voice say
 Galahad, I see there environ about thee so many angels
 that my power may not dere thee{sic}  Right so Sir Galahad
 saw a body all armed lie in that tomb, and beside him a
 sword.  Now, fair brother, said Galahad, let us remove
 this body, for it is not worthy to lie in this churchyard,
 for he was a false Christian man.  And therewith they all
 departed and went to the abbey.  And anon as he was
 unarmed a good man came and set him down by him and
 said:  Sir, I shall tell you what betokeneth all that ye saw
 in the tomb; for that covered body betokeneth the
 duresse of the world, and the great sin that Our Lord
 found in the world.  For there was such wretchedness
 that the father loved not the son, nor the son loved not
 the father; and that was one of the causes that Our Lord
 took flesh and blood of a clean maiden, for our sins were
 so great at that time that well-nigh all was wickedness.
 Truly, said Galahad, I believe you right well.
 
 So Sir Galahad rested him there that night; and upon
 the morn he made the squire knight, and asked him his
 name, and of what kindred he was come.  Sir, said he,
 men calleth me Melias de Lile, and I am the son of the
 King of Denmark.  Now, fair sir, said Galahad, sith
 that ye be come of kings and queens, now look that
 knighthood be well set in you, for ye ought to be a mirror
 unto all chivalry.  Sir, said Sir Melias, ye say sooth.  But,
 sir, sithen ye have made me a knight ye must of right
 grant me my first desire that is reasonable.  Ye say sooth,
 said Galahad.  Melias said:  Then that ye will suffer me
 to ride with you in this quest of the Sangreal, till that some
 adventure depart us.  I grant you, sir.
 
 Then men brought Sir Melias his armour and his spear
 and his horse, and so Sir Galahad and he rode forth all
 that week or they found any adventure.  And then upon a
 Monday in the morning, as they were departed from an
 abbey, they came to a cross which departed two ways, and
 in that cross were letters written that said thus:  Now, ye
 knights errant, the which goeth to seek knights adventurous,
 see here two ways; that one way defendeth thee that
 thou ne go that way, for he shall not go out of the way
 again but if he be a good man and a worthy knight; and
 if thou go on the left hand, thou shalt not lightly there
 win prowess, for thou shalt in this way be soon assayed.
 Sir, said Melias to Galahad, if it like you to suffer me to
 take the way on the left hand, tell me, for there I shall well
 prove my strength.  It were better, said Galahad, ye rode
 not that way, for I deem I should better escape in that way
 than ye.  Nay, my lord, I pray you let me have that
 adventure.  Take it in God's name, said Galahad.
