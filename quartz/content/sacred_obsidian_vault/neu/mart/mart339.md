 CHAPTER XIV
 
 How by miracle they were both made whole by the coming
 of the holy vessel of Sangreal.
 
 
 THEN they made both great dole out of measure.  This
 will not avail, said Sir Percivale.  And then he kneeled
 down and made his prayer devoutly unto Almighty Jesu,
 for he was one of the best knights of the world that at
 that time was, in whom the very faith stood most in.
 Right so there came by the holy vessel of the Sangreal
 with all manner of sweetness and savour; but they could
 not readily see who that bare that vessel, but Sir Percivale
 had a glimmering of the vessel and of the maiden that
 bare it, for he was a perfect clean maiden; and forthwithal
 they both were as whole of hide and limb as ever they
 were in their life-days: then they gave thankings to God
 with great mildness.  O Jesu, said Sir Percivale, what
 may this mean, that we be thus healed, and right now we
 were at the point of dying?  I wot full well, said Sir Ector,
 what it is; it is an holy vessel that is borne by a maiden,
 and therein is part of the holy blood of our Lord Jesu
 Christ, blessed mote he be.  But it may not be seen, said
 Sir Ector, but if it be by a perfect man.  So God me
 help, said Sir Percivale, I saw a damosel, as me thought,
 all in white, with a vessel in both her hands, and forthwithal
 I was whole.
 
 So then they took their horses and their harness, and
 amended their harness as well as they might that was
 broken; and so they mounted upon their horses, and rode
 talking together.  And there Sir Ector de Maris told Sir
 Percivale how he had sought his brother, Sir Launcelot,
 long, and never could hear witting of him: In many
 strange adventures have I been in this quest.  And so
 either told other of their adventures.
