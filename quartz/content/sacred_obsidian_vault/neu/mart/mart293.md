 CHAPTER LVI
 
 How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Agravaine and Sir
 Gaheris, and how Sir Dinadan was sent for by La Beale Isoud.
 
 
 SO when they had overtaken Sir Tristram, Sir Agravaine
 bade him:  Turn, traitor knight.  That is evil said, said
 Sir Tristram; and therewith he pulled out his sword, and
 smote Sir Agravaine such a buffet upon the helm that he
 tumbled down off his horse in a swoon, and he had a
 grievous wound.  And then he turned to Gaheris, and Sir
 Tristram smote his sword and his helm together with such
 a might that Gaheris fell out of his saddle: and so Sir
 Tristram rode unto Joyous Gard, and there he alighted
 and unarmed him.  So Sir Tristram told La Beale Isoud
 of all his adventure, as ye have heard to-fore.  And when
 she heard him tell of Sir Dinadan:  Sir, said she, is not that
 he that made the song by King Mark?  That same is he,
 said Sir Tristram, for he is the best bourder and japer, and
 a noble knight of his hands, and the best fellow that I
 know, and all good knights love his fellowship.  Alas, sir,
 said she, why brought ye not him with you?  Have ye
 no care, said Sir Tristram, for he rideth to seek me in this
 country; and therefore he will not away till he have met
 with me.  And there Sir Tristram told La Beale Isoud
 how Sir Dinadan held against all lovers.  Right so there
 came in a varlet and told Sir Tristram how there was come
 an errant knight into the town, with such colours upon
 his shield.  That is Sir Dinadan, said Sir Tristram; wit
 ye what ye shall do, said Sir Tristram: send ye for him,
 my Lady Isoud, and I will not be seen, and ye shall hear
 the merriest knight that ever ye spake withal, and the
 maddest talker; and I pray you heartily that ye make him
 good cheer.
 
 Then anon La Beale Isoud sent into the town, and
 prayed Sir Dinadan that he would come into the castle and
 repose him there with a lady.  With a good will, said Sir
 Dinadan; and so he mounted upon his horse and rode
 into the castle; and there he alighted, and was unarmed,
 and brought into the castle.  Anon La Beale Isoud came
 unto him, and either saluted other; then she asked him
 of whence that he was.  Madam, said Dinadan, I am of
 the court of King Arthur, and knight of the Table Round,
 and my name is Sir Dinadan.  What do ye in this country?
 said La Beale Isoud.  Madam, said he, I seek Sir Tristram
 the good knight, for it was told me that he was in this
 country.  It may well be, said La Beale Isoud, but I am
 not ware of him.  Madam, said Dinadan, I marvel of
 Sir Tristram and mo other lovers, what aileth them to
 be so mad and so sotted upon women.  Why, said La
 Beale Isoud, are ye a knight and be no lover? it is shame
 to you: wherefore ye may not be called a good knight
 [but] if ye make a quarrel for a lady.  God defend me, said
 Dinadan, for the joy of love is too short, and the sorrow
 thereof, and what cometh thereof, dureth over long.  Ah,
 said La Beale Isoud, say ye not so, for here fast by was
 the good knight Sir Bleoberis, that fought with three
 knights at once for a damosel's sake, and he won her afore
 the King of Northumberland.  It was so, said Sir Dinadan,
 for I know him well for a good knight and a noble, and
 come of noble blood; for all be noble knights of whom
 he is come of, that is Sir Launcelot du Lake.
 
 Now I pray you, said La Beale Isoud, tell me will you
 fight for my love with three knights that do me great
 wrong? and insomuch as ye be a knight of King Arthur's
 I require you to do battle for me.  Then Sir Dinadan
 said: I shall say you ye be as fair a lady as ever I saw
 any, and much fairer than is my lady Queen Guenever,
 but wit ye well at one word, I will not fight for you with
 three knights, Jesu defend me.  Then Isoud laughed, and
 had good game at him.  So he had all the cheer that she
 might make him, and there he lay all that night.  And
 on the morn early Sir Tristram armed him, and La Beale
 Isoud gave him a good helm; and then he promised her
 that he would meet with Sir Dinadan, and they two would
 ride together into Lonazep, where the tournament should
 be:  And there shall I make ready for you where ye shall
 see the tournament.  Then departed Sir Tristram with
 two squires that bare his shield and his spears that were
 great and long.
