 CHAPTER XXXI
 
 How Sir Tristram returned against King Arthur's party
 because he saw Sir Palomides on that party.
 
 THEN upon the morn Sir Palomides returned from the King of
 Northgalis, and rode to King Arthur's side, where was King
 Carados, and the King of Ireland, and Sir Launcelot's kin, and
 Sir Gawaine's kin.  So Sir Palomides sent the damosel unto Sir
 Tristram that he sent to seek him when he was out of his mind in
 the forest, and this damosel asked Sir Tristram what he was and
 what was his name?  As for that, said Sir Tristram, tell Sir
 Palomides ye shall not wit as at this time unto the time I have
 broken two spears upon him.  But let him wit thus much, said Sir
 Tristram, that I am the same knight that he smote down in over-
 evening[*10] at the tourna&lt;405&gt;ment; and tell him plainly on what
 party that Sir Palomides be I will be of the contrary party. 
 Sir, said the damosel, ye shall understand that Sir Palomides
 will be on King Arthur's side, where the most noble knights of
 the world be.  In the name of God, said Sir Tristram, then will I
 be with the King of Northgalis, because Sir Palomides will be on
 King Arthur's side, and else I would not but for his sake.  So
 when King Arthur was come they blew unto the field; and then
 there began a great party, and so King Carados jousted with the
 King of the Hundred Knights, and there King Carados had a fall:
 then was there hurling and rushing, and right so came in knights
 of King Arthur's, and they bare aback the King of Northgalis'
 knights.

 Then Sir Tristram came in, and began so roughly and so bigly that
 there was none might withstand him, and thus Sir Tristram dured
 long.  And at the last Sir Tristram fell among the fellowship of
 King Ban, and there fell upon him Sir Bors de Ganis, and Sir
 Ector de Maris, and Sir Blamore de Ganis, and many other knights. 
 And then Sir Tristram smote on the right hand and on the left
 hand, that all lords and ladies spake of his noble deeds.  But at
 the last Sir Tristram should have had the worse had not the King
 with the Hundred Knights been.  And then he came with his
 fellowship and rescued Sir Tristram, and brought him away from
 those knights that bare the shields of Cornwall.  And then Sir
 Tristram saw another fellowship by themself, and there were a
 forty knights together, and Sir Kay, the Seneschal, was their
 governor.  Then Sir Tristram rode in amongst them, and there he
 smote down Sir Kay from his horse; and there he fared among those
 knights like a greyhound among conies.
 
 Then Sir Launcelot found a knight that was sore wounded upon the
 head.  Sir, said Sir Launcelot, who wounded you so sore?  Sir, he
 said, a knight that beareth a black shield, and I may curse the
 time that ever I met with him, for he is a devil and no man.  So
 Sir Launcelot departed from him and thought to meet with Sir
 Tristram, &lt;406&gt;and so he rode with his sword drawn in his hand to
 seek Sir Tristram; and then he espied him how he hurled here and
 there, and at every stroke Sir Tristram wellnigh smote down a
 knight.  O mercy Jesu! said the king, sith the times I bare arms
 saw I never no knight do so marvellous deeds of arms.  And if I
 should set upon this knight, said Sir Launcelot to himself, I did
 shame to myself, and therewithal Sir Launcelot put up his sword. 
 And then the King with the Hundred Knights and an hundred more of
 North Wales set upon the twenty of Sir Launcelot's kin: and they
 twenty knights held them ever together as wild swine, and none
 would fail other.  And so when Sir Tristram beheld the noblesse
 or these twenty knights he marvelled of their good deeds, for he
 saw by their fare and by their rule that they had liefer die than
 avoid the field.  Now Jesu, said Sir Tristram, well may he be
 valiant and full of prowess that hath such a sort of noble
 knights unto his kin, and full like is he to be a noble man that
 is their leader and governor.  He meant it by Sir Launcelot du
 Lake.  So when Sir Tristram had beholden them long he thought
 shame to see two hundred knights battering upon twenty knights. 
 Then Sir Tristram rode unto the King with the Hundred Knights and
 said:  Sir, leave your fighting with those twenty knights, for ye
 win no worship of them, ye be so many and they so few; and wit ye
 well they will not out of the field I see by their cheer and
 countenance; and worship get ye none an ye slay them.  Therefore
 leave your fighting with them, for I to increase my worship I
 will ride to the twenty knights and help them with all my might
 and power.  Nay, said the King with the Hundred Knights, ye shall
 not do so; now I see your courage and courtesy I will withdraw my
 knights for your pleasure, for evermore a good knight will favour
 another, and like will draw to like.
