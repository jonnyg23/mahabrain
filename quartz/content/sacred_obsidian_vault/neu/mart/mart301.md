 CHAPTER LXIV
 
 Of the battle between Sir Palomides and the two brethren,
 and how the two brethren were slain.
 
 
 THEN they departed, and the two brethren came against
 Sir Palomides, and he against them, as fast as their horses
 might run.  And by fortune Sir Palomides smote Helake
 through his shield and through the breast more than a
 fathom.  All this while Sir Helius held up his spear, and
 for pride and orgulit<e> he would not smite Sir Palomides
 with his spear; but when he saw his brother lie on the
 earth, and saw he might not help himself, then he said
 unto Sir Palomides:  Help thyself.  And therewith he
 came hurtling unto Sir Palomides with his spear, and
 smote him quite from his saddle.  Then Sir Helius rode
 over Sir Palomides twice or thrice.  And therewith Sir
 Palomides was ashamed, and gat the horse of Sir Helius
 by the bridle, and therewithal the horse areared, and Sir
 Palomides halp after, and so they fell both to the earth;
 but anon Sir Helius stert up lightly, and there he smote
 Sir Palomides a great stroke upon the helm, that he
 kneeled upon his own knee.  Then they lashed together
 many sad strokes, and traced and traversed now backward,
 now sideling, hurtling together like two boars, and that
 same time they fell both grovelling to the earth.
 
 Thus they fought still without any reposing two hours,
 and never breathed; and then Sir Palomides waxed faint
 and weary, and Sir Helius waxed passing strong, and
 doubled his strokes, and drove Sir Palomides overthwart
 and endlong all the field, that they of the city when they
 saw Sir Palomides in this case they wept and cried, and
 made great dole, and the other party made as great joy.
 Alas, said the men of the city, that this noble knight
 should thus be slain for our king's sake.  And as they
 were thus weeping and crying, Sir Palomides that had
 suffered an hundred strokes, that it was wonder that he
 stood on his feet, at the last Sir Palomides beheld as he
 might the common people, how they wept for him; and
 then he said to himself:  Ah, fie for shame, Sir Palomides,
 why hangest thou thy head so low; and therewith he bare
 up his shield, and looked Sir Helius in the visage, and he
 smote him a great stroke upon the helm, and after that
 another and another.  And then he smote Sir Helius with
 such a might that he fell to the earth grovelling; and
 then he raced off his helm from his head, and there he
 smote him such a buffet that he departed his head from
 the body.  And then were the people of the city the
 joyfullest people that might be.  So they brought him to
 his lodging with great solemnity, and there all the people
 became his men.  And then Sir Palomides prayed them
 all to take keep unto all the lordship of King Hermance:
 For, fair sirs, wit ye well I may not as at this time abide
 with you, for I must in all haste be with my lord King
 Arthur at the Castle of Lonazep, the which I have
 promised.  Then was the people full heavy at his
 departing, for all that city proffered Sir Palomides the
 third part of their goods so that he would abide with
 them; but in no wise as at that time he would not
 abide.
 
 And so Sir Palomides departed, and so he came unto
 the castle thereas Sir Ebel was lieutenant.  And when they
 in the castle wist how Sir Palomides had sped, there was a
 joyful meiny; and so Sir Palomides departed, and came
 to the castle of Lonazep.  And when he wist that Sir
 Tristram was not there he took his way over Humber,
 and came unto Joyous Gard, whereas Sir Tristram was
 and La Beale Isoud.  Sir Tristram had commanded that
 what knight errant came within the Joyous Gard, as in
 the town, that they should warn Sir Tristram.  So there
 came a man of the town, and told Sir Tristram how there
 was a knight in the town, a passing goodly man.  What
 manner of man is he, said Sir Tristram, and what sign
 beareth he?  So the man told Sir Tristram all the tokens
 of him.  That is Palomides, said Dinadan.  It may well
 be, said Sir Tristram.  Go ye to him, said Sir Tristram
 unto Dinadan.  So Dinadan went unto Sir Palomides,
 and there either made other great joy, and so they lay
 together that night.  And on the morn early came Sir
 Tristram and Sir Gareth, and took them in their beds, and
 so they arose and brake their fast.
