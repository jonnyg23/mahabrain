 <p align="center"><i>Bodli brings Tidings to Bathstead</i>.</p>  
 <p>NOW so it chanced, on a late summer day,<br> Unto the west would Oswif take his way<br> With all his sons, and Gudrun listlessly<br> Stood by the door their going forth to see,<br> Until the hill's brow hid them; then she turned,<br> And long she gazed, the while her full heart yearned<br> Toward Herdholt and the south.<br>                                 "Late grows the year,"<br> She said, "and winter cometh with its fear<br> And dreams of dying hopes. Ah me, I change,<br> And my heart hardens! Will he think me strange<br> When he beholds this face of mine at last,<br> Or shall our love make nought of long days past,<br> Burn up the sights that we apart have seen,<br> And make them all as though they had not been?<br> Ah, the hard world! I, who in hope so sure<br> Have waited, scarcely may the days endure.<br> How has it been with those who needs must wait<br> With dying hope and lingering love, till hate,<br> The seed of ill lies, told and hearkened to,<br> The knot of loving memories shall undo,<br> Break the last bonds of love, and cast them forth<br> With nothing left to them of joy or worth?<br>    "O love, come back, come back, delay no more<br> To ease thine aching heart that yearneth sore<br> For me, as mine for thee! Leave wealth and praise <a name="page_407"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 407</font></a><br> For those to win who know no happy days.<br> Come, though so true thou art, thou fearest not<br> Yet to delay! Come, my heart waxes hot<br> For all thy lonely days to comfort thee."</p>  
 <p>   So spake she, and awhile stood quietly,<br> Still looking toward the south, her wide grey eyes<br> Made tenderer with those thronging memories,<br> Until upon the wind she seemed to hear<br> The sound of horse-hoofs, and twixt hope and fear<br> She trembled, as more clear the far sounds grew,<br> And thitherward it seemed from Herdholt drew;<br> So now at last to meet that sound she went,<br> Until her eyes, on the hill's brow intent,<br> Beheld a spear rising against the sky<br> Oer the grey road, and therewith presently<br> A gilded helm rose up beneath the spear,<br> And then her trembling limbs no more might bear<br> Her body forward; scarce alive she stood,<br> And saw a man in raiment red as blood<br> Rise oer the hill's brow, who when he did gain<br> The highest part of the grey road, drew rein<br> To gaze on Bathstead spreading neath him there,<br> Its bright vanes glittering in the morning air.,<br> She stared upon him panting, and belike<br> He saw her now, for he his spurs did strike<br> Into his horse, and, while her quivering face<br> Grew hard and stern, rode swiftly to the place<br> Whereas she stood, and clattering leapt adown <a name="page_408"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 408</font></a><br> Unto the earth, and met her troubled frown<br> And pale face, with the sad imploring eyes<br> Of Bodli Thorleikson.<br>                          Then did there rise<br> A dreadful fear within her heart, for she<br> No look like that in him was wont to see;<br> Scarce had she strength to say:<br>                                   "How goes it then,<br> With himthy kinsman, mid the Eastland men?"</p>  
 <p>   Then, writhen as with some great sudden sting<br> Of pain, he spake; "Fear not, Gudrun, I bring<br> Fair news of his well-doinghe is well."</p>  
 <p>   "Speak out," she said, "what more there is to tell!<br> Is he at Herdholt? will he come to-day?"</p>  
 <p>   And with that word she turned her face away,<br> Shamed with the bitter-sweet of yearning pain,<br> And to her lips the red blood came again;<br> But he a moment made as he would reach<br> His hand to hers, his sad eyes did beseech<br> Some look from hers, so blind to him, so blind!<br> And scarce his story might he call to mind,<br> Until he deemed he saw her shoulders heave<br> As with a sob.<br>                   Then said he, "We did leave<br> Kiartan in Norway, praised of all men there;<br> He bade me tell thee that his life was fair<br> And full of hopeand that he looked to see <a name="page_409"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 409</font></a><br> Thy face again.So God be good to me,<br> These were the words he spake!"<br>                                     For now she turned<br> Tearless upon him, and great anger burned<br> Within her eyes: "O trusty messenger,<br> No doubt through thee his very voice I hear!<br> Sure but light thought and stammering voice he had<br> To waste on one, who used to make him glad!<br> Thou art a true friend! Ah, I know thee, then,<br> A follower on the footsteps of great men,<br> To reap where they have sowed. Alive and well!<br> And doing deeds whereof the skalds shall tell!<br> Ah, what fair days he heapeth up for me!<br> Come now, unless thine envy stayeth thee,<br> Speak more of him, and make me glad at heart!"</p>  
 <p>   Then Bodli said, "Nay, I have done my part,<br> Let others tell the rest "and turned to go,<br> Yet lingered, and she cried aloud:<br>                                       "No, no,<br> Friend of my lover! if ill words I spake<br> Yet pardon me! for sore my heart doth ache<br> With pent-up love."<br>                        She reached her hand to him,<br> He turned and took it, and his eyes did swim<br> With tears for him and her; a while it seemed,<br> As though the dream so many a sweet night dreamed,<br> Waked from with anguish on so many a morn,<br> Were come to pass, that he afresh was born <a name="page_410"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 410</font></a><br> To happy life, with heavens and earth made new;<br> But slowly from his grasp her hand she drew,<br> And stepped aback, and said:<br>                                  "Speak, I fear not,<br> Because so true a heart my love hath got<br> That nought can change it; speak, when cometh he?<br> Tell me the sweet words that he spake of me,<br> Did he not tell me in the days agone,<br> That oft he spake of me to thee alone?<br> Nay, tell me of his doings, for indeed<br> Of words twixt him and me is little need."</p>  
 <p>   Then Bodli gan in troubled voice to tell<br> True tidings of the things that there befell,<br> Saving of Ingibiorg, and Gudrun stood<br> And hearkened, trembling:<br>                               "Good, yea, very good,"<br> She said, when he had done, "and yet I deem<br> All this thou sayst as if we dreamed a dream<br> Nor camst thou here to say but this to me<br> Why tarrieth Kiartan yet beyond the sea?"</p>  
 <p>   Bodli flushed red, and, trembling sorely, spake:<br> "O Gudrun, must thou die for one man's sake,<br> So heavenly as thou art? What shall I say?<br> Thou mayst live long, yet never see the day<br> That bringeth Kiartan back unto this land."</p>  
 <p>   He looked at her, but moveless did she stand,<br> Nor spake a word, nor yet did any pain <a name="page_411"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 411</font></a><br> Writhe her fair face, grown deadly pale again.<br> Then Bodli stretched his hand forth;<br>                                       "Yet they lie,<br> Who say I did the thing, who say that I,<br> Een in my inmost heart, have wished for it.<br> But thouO, hearken, Gudrunhe doth sit<br> By Ingibiorg's side ever; day by day,<br> Sadder his eyes grow when she goes away<br> What! know I not the eyes of lovers then?<br> Why should I tell thee of the talk of men,<br> Babbling of how he weds her, is made king,<br> How he and Olaf shall have might to bring<br> Denmark and England both beneath their rule.<br> Ah, woe, woe, woe, that I, a bitter fool,<br> Upon one heart all happy life should stake;<br> Woe is me, Gudrun, for thy beauty's sake!<br> Ah, for my fool's eyes and my greedy heart<br> Must all rest henceforth from my soul depart?"</p>  
 <p>   He reached his hand to her, she put it by,<br> And gathered up her gown-skirts hurriedly,<br> And in a voice, like a low wailing wind,<br> Unto the wind she cried:<br>                              "Still may he find<br> A woman worthy of his loveliness;<br> Still may it be that she his days will bless,<br> As I had done, had we been wed at last!"</p>  
 <p>   Therewith by Bodli's trembling hands she passed, <a name="page_412"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 412</font></a><br> Nor gave one look on him; but he gazed still,<br> Een when her gown fluttered far down the hill,<br> With staring eyes upon the empty place<br> Where last he saw the horror of her face<br> Changed by consuming anguish; when he turned,<br> Blind with the fire that in his worn heart burned,<br> Empty the hill-side was of anyone,<br> And as a man who some great crime hath done<br> He gat into his saddle, and scarce knew<br> Whither he went, until his rein he drew<br> By Herdholt porch, as in the other days,<br> When Kiartan by his side his love would praise.</p>  
 <p>   Three days at Herdholt in most black despair<br> Did Bodli sit, till folk gan whisper there<br> That the faith-changer on the earth was dead,<br> Although he seemed to live; with mighty dread<br> They watched his going out and coming in;<br> On the fourth day somewhat did hope begin<br> To deal, as its wont is, with agony;<br> And he, who truly at the first could see<br> What dreadful things his coming days did wait,<br> Now, blinded by the hand of mocking fate,<br> Deeming that good from evil yet might rise,<br> Once more to pleasure lifted up his eyes.<br>    And now, to nurse his hope, there came that day<br> A messenger from Gudrun, who did pray<br> That he would straightly come and see her there.<br> At whose mazed face a long while did he stare <a name="page_413"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 413</font></a><br> As one who heard not, and the man must speak<br> His message thrice, before a smile gan break<br> Over his wan face; neither did he say<br> A word in answer, but straight took his way<br> Oer rough and smooth to Bathstead, knowing not<br> What ground his horse beneath his hoofs had got.</p>  
 <p>   Ah, did he look for pleasure, when he saw<br> Her long slim figure down the dusk hall draw<br> Unto his beating heart, as nobly clad<br> As in the days when all the three were glad?<br> Did he perchance deem that he might forget<br> The man across the sea? His eyes were wet<br> For pity of that heart so made forlorn,<br> But on his lips a smile, of pleasure born,<br> Played, that I deem perchance he knew not of,<br> As he reached out his hand to touch his love<br> Long ere she drew anigh. But now, when she<br> Was close to him, and therewith eagerly,<br> Trembling and wild-eyed, he beheld the face<br> He deemed een then would gladden all the place,<br> Blank grew his heart, and all hope failed in him,<br> And een the anguish of his love grew dim,<br> And poor it seemed, a thing of little price,<br> Before the gathered sorrow of her eyes.</p>  
 <p>   But while, still trembling there, the poor wretch stood,<br> She spoke in a low voice that chilled his blood,<br> So worn and far away it seemed; "See now, <a name="page_414"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 414</font></a><br> I sent for thee, who of all men dost know<br> The heart of him who once swore troth to me:<br> Kiartan, I mean, the son of Olaf, he<br> Who oer the sea wins great fame as thou sayst<br> That thou mayst tell again, why he doth waste<br> The tale of happy days that we shall have;<br> For death comes quickly on us, and the grave<br> Is a dim land whereof I know not aught."</p>  
 <p>   As a grey dove, within the meshes caught,<br> Flutters a little, then lies still again<br> Ere wildly beat its wings with its last pain,<br> So once or twice her passion, as she spake,<br> Rose to her throat, and yet might not outbreak<br> Till that last word was spoken; then as stung<br> By pain on pain, her arms abroad she flung,<br> And wailed aloud; but dry-eyed Bodli stood<br> Pale as a corpse, and in such haggard mood,<br> Such helpless, hopeless misery, as one<br> Who first in hell meets her he hath undone.<br> Yet sank her wailing in a little while,<br> Through dreadful sobs to silence, and a smile,<br> A feeble memory of the courteous ways,<br> For which in days agone she won such praise,<br> Rose to her pale lips, and she spake once more<br> As if the passionate words, cast forth before,<br> Were clean forgotten, with that bitter wail:</p>  
 <p>   "O, Bodli Thorleikson, of good avail <a name="page_415"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 415</font></a><br> Thou ever art to me, and now hast come<br> Swiftly indeed unto a troubled home:<br> For ill at ease I am, and fain would hear<br> From thee who knowst him, why this looked-for year<br> Lacks Kiartan still."<br>                       He knew not what to say,<br> But she reached out her hand in the old way<br> And coldly palm met palm: then him she led<br> Unto a seat, and sat by him, and said:</p>  
 <p>   "Yea, fain am I to hear the tale once more,<br> The shame and grief, although it hurt me sore;<br> Yea, from thee, Bodli; though it well may be<br> That he I trusted, too much trusted thee."</p>  
 <p>   So great a burden on his spirit lay<br> He heeded not the last words she did say,<br> But in low measured speech began again<br> The story of the honour and the gain<br> That Kiartan had, and how his days went now;<br> She sat beside him, with her head bent low,<br> Hearkening, or hearkening not; but now when all<br> Was done, and he sat staring at the wall<br> Silent, and full of misery, then she said:</p>  
 <p>   "How know I yet but thou the tale hast made,<br> Since many a moment do I think of now<br> In the old time before ye went, when thou<br> Wouldst look on me, as on him I should gaze <a name="page_416"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 416</font></a><br> If he were here, false to the happy days?"</p>  
 <p>   "A small thing," said he, "shall I strive with fate<br> In vain, or vainly pray against thy hate?<br> Would God I were a liar! that his keel<br> Een now the sands of White-river did feel.<br> O Gudrun, Gudrun, thou shalt find it true!<br> Ah, God, what thing is left for me to do?"</p>  
 <p>   Therewith he rose, and towards the hall-door went,<br> Nor heard her voice behind him, as she bent<br> Oer the tear-wetted rushes of the floor.<br> Sick-hearted was he when he passed the door,<br> Weary of all things, weary of his love,<br> And muttering to himself hard things thereof;<br> But when he reached the Herdholt porch again,<br> A heaven long left seemed that morn's bitter pain,<br> And one desire alone he had, that he<br> Once more anigh unto his love might be;<br> Honour and shame, truth, lies, and weal and woe,<br> Seemed idle words whose meaning none might know;<br> What was the world to him with all its ways,<br> If he once more into her eyes might gaze?<br> Again he saw her, not alone this tide,<br> But in the hall, her father by her side,<br> And many folk around: if like a dream<br> All things except her loveliness did seem,<br> Yet doubt ye not that evil shades they were;<br> A dream most horrible for him to bear, <a name="page_417"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 417</font></a><br> That all his strength was fallen to weakness now,<br> That he the sweet repose might never know<br> Of being with her from all the world apart,<br> Eyes watching eyes, heart beating unto heart.<br> Cold was her face, not pensive as before,<br> And like a very queen herself she bore<br> Among the guests, and courteous was to all,<br> But no kind look on Bodli's face did fall,<br> Though he had died to gain it.<br>                                   So time wore,<br> And still he went to Bathstead more and more,<br> And whiles alone, and whiles in company,<br> With raging heart her sad face did he see,<br> And still the time he spent in hall and bower<br> Beside her did he call the evillest hour<br> Of all the day, the while it dured; but when<br> He was away, came hope's ghost back again<br> And fanned his miserable longing, till<br> He said within himself that nought was ill<br> Save that most hideous load of loneliness.<br> Howso the time went, never rest did bless<br> His heart a moment; nought seemed good to him,<br> Not een the rest of death, unknown and dim.</p>  
 <p>   And Kiartan came not, and what news came out<br> From Norway was a gravestone on such doubt<br> As yet might linger in the hearts of men,<br> That he perchance might see that land again.<br> And no more now spake Gudrun any word <a name="page_418"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 418</font></a><br> Of Kiartan, until folk with one accord<br> Began to say, how that no little thing<br> It was, those two great strains of men to bring<br> Into alliance: "Pity though!" they said,<br> "That she to such a strange man should be wed<br> As Bodli Thorleikson of late hath grown!"</p>  
 <p>   So sprung the evil crop by evil sown.</p>
