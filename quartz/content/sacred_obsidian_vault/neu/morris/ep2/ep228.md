 <p>"Morris's 'Jason' is in the purest, simplest, most idiomatic English; full of freshness, full of life, vivid in landscape, vivid in human action, worth reading at the cost of many leisure hours even to a busy man."<i>The Times</i>.</p>  
 <p>"Not many living Englishmen have written so good a poem on such a scale. Mr. Morris is a most skilful narrator, full of the sweet garrulity proper to the olden time and those that love it."<i>The Guardian</i>.</p>  
 <p>"Mr. Morris has displayed poetic qualities rare in themselves, and especially rare in these days. We should have to go back for a quarter of a century to find any labor of equal pretension that exhibits the same amount of fortitude in the writer and the same intimate knowledge of all that relates to his theme."<i>The Athenæum</i>.</p>  
 <p>"'The Life and Death of Jason' is a fine poem, which never flags in interest for a single line, and is full of music, life, and clear vision. The freshness of the early world' has taken complete possession of Mr. Morris as he wrote."<i>The Spectator</i>.</p>  
 <p>"In all the noble roll of our poets there has been since Chaucer no second teller of Tales, no second rhapsode comparable to the first, till the advent of this one. Rarely but in the ballad and romance periods has such poetry been written, so broad and sad and simple, so full of deep and direct fire, certain of its aim, without finish, without fault."<i>Fortnightly Review</i>.</p>  
 <p>"Open this poem where the reader may, he will find in it broad and simple pictures of the olden days. It is true art alone which can draw pictures with this living simplicity, whether in bare outline or in full blaze of color; and this art Mr. Morris possesses in a high degree."<i>The Standard</i>.</p>  
 <p>"Musical, clear, and flowing, strangely imaginative and suggestive, presenting pictures of almost incomparable beauty, it is a work of which an epoch may be proud."<i>Sunday Times</i>.</p>
