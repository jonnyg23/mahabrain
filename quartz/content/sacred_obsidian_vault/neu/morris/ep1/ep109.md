 <p><font size="-1">ACRISIUS, king of Argos, being warned by an oracle that the son of his daughter Danaë should slay him, shut her up in a brazen tower built for that end beside the sea: there, though no man could come nigh her, she nevertheless bore a son to Jove, and she and her new-born son, set adrift on the sea, came to the island of Seriphos. Thence her son, grown to manhood, set out to win the Gorgon's Head, and accomplished that end by the help of Minerva; and afterwards rescued Andromeda, daughter of Cepheus, from a terrible doom, and wedded her. Coming back to Seriphos he took his mother thence, and made for Argos, but by stress of weather came to Thessaly, and there, at Larissa, accomplished the prophecy, by unwittingly slaying Acrisius. In the end he founded the city of Mycenæ, and died there.</font></p>  
 <p>NOW of the King Acrisius shall ye hear,<br> Who, thinking he could free his life from fear,<br> Did that which brought but death on him at last.<br>    In Argos did he reign in days long past,<br> And had one daughter, fair as man could see,<br> Who in old tales is callèd Danaë;<br> But as she grew up fairer day by day,<br> A wandering oracle to him did say,<br> That whatso else might happen, soon or late <a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 219</font></a><br> He should be taken in the toils of fate,<br> And by the fruit of his own daughter's womb<br> Be slain at last, and set within his tomb;<br> And therefore heavy sorrow on him fell,<br> That she he thought to love so passing well<br> Must henceforth be his deadliest dread and woe.<br>    Long time he pondered what was best to do;<br> And whiles he thought that he would send her forth<br> To wed some king far in the snowy north,<br> And whiles that by great gifts of goods and gold<br> Some lying prophet might be bought and sold<br> To swear his daughter he must sacrifice,<br> If he would yet find favour in the eyes<br> Of the dread gods who govern everything;<br> And sometimes seemed it better to the King,<br> That he might scape the shedding of her blood<br> By leaving her in some far lonely wood,<br> Wherein the Dryads might the maiden find,<br> Or beasts might slay her, following but their kind.<br>    So passed his anxious days, until at last,<br> When many a plot through his vexed brain had passed,<br> He lacked the heart his flesh and blood to slay,<br> Yet neither would he she should go away<br> From out his sight, or be at large at all;<br> Therefore his wisest craftsmen did he call,<br> And bade them make for him a tower foursquare,<br> Such as no man had yet seen anywhere,<br> For therein neither stone nor wood should be,<br> But all be wrought of brass most cunningly. <a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 220</font></a><br>    Now thither oft would maiden Danae stray,<br> And watch its strange walls growing day by day,<br> Because, poor soul! she knew not anything<br> Of these forebodings of the fearful King,<br> Nor how he meted out for her this doom,<br> Therein to dwell as in a living tomb.<br> But on a day, she, coming there alone,<br> Found it all finished and the workmen gone,<br> And no one nigh, so through the open door<br> She entered, and went up from floor to floor,<br> And through its chambers wandered without dread;<br> And, entering one, she found therein a bed,<br> Dight daintily, as though to serve a queen;<br> And all the walls adorned with hangings green,<br> Tables and benches in good order set,<br> And all things new, by no one used as yet.<br>    With that she murmured, "When again I see<br> My father, will I bid him tell to me<br> Who shall live here and die here, for, no doubt,<br> Whoever enters here shall neer go out:<br> Therefore the walls are made so high and great,<br> Therefore the bolts are measureless of weight,<br> The windows small, barred, turned towards the sea,<br> That none from land may tell who here may be.<br> No doubt some man the King my father fears<br> Above all other, here shall pass his years.<br> Alas, poor soul! scarce shall he see the sun,<br> Or care to know when the hot day is done,<br> Or ever see sweet flowers again, or grass, <a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 221</font></a><br> Or take much note of how the seasons pass.<br> Truly we folk who dwell in rest and ease<br> But lightly think of such abodes as these;<br> And I, who live wrapped round about with bliss,<br> Shall go from hence and soon forget all this:<br> For in my garden many a sweet flower blooms,<br> Wide open are the doors of all my rooms,<br> And lightly folk come in and lightly go;<br> And I have known as yet but childish woe."<br>    Therewith she turned about to leave the place,<br> But as unto the door she set her face<br> A bitter wailing from outside she heard,<br> And somewhat therewithal she waxed afeard,<br> And stopped awhile; yet listening, she but thought,<br> "This is the man who to his doom is brought<br> By weeping friends, who come to see the last<br> Of that dear face they know shall soon be past<br> From them for ever." Then she gan to go<br> Adown the brazen stairs with footsteps slow.<br>    But quick the shrieks and wailing drew anear,<br> Till in her ears it sounded sharp and clear,<br> And then she said, "Alas! and must I see<br> These weeping faces drawn with agony?<br> Would I had not come here to-day!" Withal<br> She started, as upon her ear did fall<br> The sound of shutting of the outer door,<br> And people coming up from floor to floor;<br> And paler then she grew, but moved to meet<br> The woful sounds and slow-ascending feet, <a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 222</font></a><br> Shrinking with pity for that wretched one<br> Whose life of joy upon that day was done.<br>    Thus down the stairs with saddened heart she passed,<br> And to a lower chamber came at last;<br> But as she went beneath the archway wide<br> The door was opened from the other side,<br> And in poured many maidens, whom she knew<br> For her own fair companions, leal and true;<br> And after them two soldiers armed there came,<br> With knitted brows and eyes downcast for shame.<br>    But when those damsels saw her standing there,<br> Anew they wept, and tore their unbound hair;<br> But midst their wailing, still no word they said,<br> Until she spoke oppressed with sickening dread:<br>    "O tell me what has happened to me then!<br> For is my father slain of outland men?<br> Or have the gods sent death upon the land?<br> Or is it mine own death that they command?<br> Alas, alas! but slay me quick, I pray,<br> Nor let me linger on from day to day,<br> Maddened with fear like this, that sickens me,<br> And makes me seem the half-dead thing ye see."<br>    Then, like a man constrained, a soldier said<br> These cruel words unto the wretched maid:<br> "Lady, lose hope and fear now once for all;<br> Here must thou dwell betwixt brass wall and wall<br> Until the gods send gentle death to thee;<br> And these as erst thine handmaidens shall be:<br> And if thou askest why the thing is so,<a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 223</font></a><br> Thus the King wills it, for a while ago<br> An oracle foretold that thou shouldst live<br> To have a son, who bitter death should give<br> Unto thy father; so, to save this shame<br> From falling on the glorious Argive name,<br> He deemed it well that thou shouldst live indeed,<br> But yet apart from man thy life shouldst lead.<br> So in this place thy days must pass away,<br> And we who are thy guards, from day to day<br> Will bring thee everything that thou mayst need.<br> But pardon us, constrained to do this deed<br> By the King's will, and oaths that we have sworn<br> Ere to this life of sorrow thou wert born."<br>    Therewith they turned and went, and soon the sound<br> Of shutting doors smote like a deadly wound<br> Into her heart; and yet no word she spoke,<br> But fell as one beneath a deadly stroke.</p>  
 <p>   Then they who there her fellows were to be<br> Bore up her body, groaning heavily,<br> Unto the upper chamber where that day<br> She came before, and on the bed did lay<br> The wretched maid, and then they sat around,<br> With heavy heads and hair that swept the ground,<br> To weep the passing of those happy days<br> When many an one their happy lot would praise.<br> But now and then, when bitterly would sting<br> The loss of some nigh-reached desired thing,<br> To a loud wail their weeping would arise. <a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 224</font></a><br>    Then in a while did Danae ope her eyes,<br> And to her aching forehead raised her hand;<br> But when she saw that wan, dishevelled band,<br> She soon remembered this was no ill dream,<br> But that all things were een as they did seem,<br> Then she arose, but soon upon the bed<br> Sank down again, and hid her troubled head,<br> And moaned and moaned, and when a damsel came<br> And touched her hand, and called her by her name,<br> She knew her not, but turned her head away:<br> Nor did she know when dark night followed day.</p>  
 <p>   So passed by many a day in mourning sore,<br> And weariness oppressed her evermore<br> In that unhappy prison-house of brass;<br> And yet a little the first sting did pass<br> That smote her, and she ate and drank and slept,<br> And fair and bright her body Venus kept,<br> Yea, such a grace the sea-born goddess fair<br> Did to her, that the ripples of her hair<br> Grew brighter, and the colour in her face<br> And lovely lips waned not in that sad place;<br> And rounder grew her limbs from day to day;<br> Yea, as upon the golden bed she lay,<br> You would have thought the Queen herself had come<br> To meet some love far from her golden home.<br>    And once it happed at the first hour of day<br> In golden morn upon her bed she lay,<br> Newly awakened to her daily woe, <a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 225</font></a><br> And heard the rough sea beat the rocks below,<br> The wheeling sea-gull screaming on the wing,<br> Sea-swallows swift, and many a happy thing,<br> Till bitterly the tears ran down her cheek,<br> And stretching forth her arms and fingers weak,<br> Twixt moans these piteous helpless words she said:<br> "O Queen Diana, make me now thy maid,<br> And take me from this place and set me down<br> By the boar-haunted hills, that oak-woods crown,<br> Amid thy crowd of trim-girt maidens fair.<br>    "And shall I not be safe from men-folk there,<br> Thou cruel King, when she is guarding me,<br> The mighty maid from whom the shepherds flee,<br> When in the gathering dusk twixt day and night,<br> The dead leaves tell them of her footsteps light,<br> Because they mind how dear Actæon bought<br> The lovely sight for which he never sought,<br> Diana naked in the water wan.<br>    "Yea, what fear should I have of any man<br> When through the woods I, wandering merrily,<br> With girt-up gown, sharp sword upon the thigh,<br> Full quiver on the back, stout bow in hand,<br> Should tread with firm feet many a grassy land,<br> And grow strong-limbed in following up the deer,<br> And meet the lions' eyes with little fear.<br>    "Alas! no doubt she hears not; many a maid<br> She has already, of no beast afraid,<br> Crisp-haired, with arms made meet for archery,<br> Whose limbs unclad no man shall ever see; <a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 226</font></a><br> Though the birds see them, and the seeding grass<br> Harsh and unloving over them may pass,<br> When carelessly through rough and smooth they run,<br> And bough and briar catches many a one.<br>    "Alas! why on these free maids is my thought,<br> When to such misery my life is brought?<br> I, who so long a happy maid have been,<br> The daughter of a great King and a Queen;<br> And why these fresh things do I think upon,<br> Who now shall see but little of the sun?<br>    "Here every day shall have the same sad tale,<br> My weary damsels with their faces pale,<br> The dashing of the sea on this bleak rock,<br> Pipe of the wind through cranny and through lock,<br> The sea-bird's cry, like mine grown hoarse and shrill,<br> The far off sound of horn upon the hill,<br> The merry pipe about the shepherd's home,<br> And all the things whereto I neer may come.<br>    "O ye who rule below, I pray this boon,<br> I may not live here long, but perish soon,<br> Forgotten, but at peace, since I feel nought;<br> For even now it comes across my thought<br> That here my wretched body dwells alone,<br> And that my soul with all my hope is gone.</p>  
 <p>   "Father, thy blood upon thine own head be<br> If any solace Venus send to me<br> Within this wretched place which thou hast made,<br> Of thine own flesh and blood too much afraid." <a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 227</font></a><br>    Truly Diana heard not, for that tide<br> Upon the green grass by a river side,<br> Wherein she had just bathed her body sweet,<br> She stooped to tie the sandals to her feet,<br> Her linen gown upon the herbage lay,<br> And round her was there standing many a may<br> Making her ready for the morning chase.<br>    But so it happed that Venus by the place<br> Was passing, just arisen from the sea,<br> And heard the maid complaining bitterly,<br> So to the window-bars she drew anigh,<br> And thence unseen, she saw the maiden lie,<br> As on the grass herself she might have lain<br> When in the thicket lay Adonis slain;<br> For power and joy she smiled thereat, and thought<br> "She shall not suffer all this pain for nought."<br> And slowly for Olympus sailed away,<br> And thither came at hottest of the day.<br>    Then through the heavenly courts she went, and when<br> She found the father both of gods and men,<br> She smiled upon him, and said, "Knowest thou<br> What deeds are wrought by men in Argos now?<br> Wherein a brazen tower well builded is,<br> That hides a maid away from all my bliss;<br> Since thereby thinks Acrisius to forego,<br> This doom that has been fated long ago,<br> That by his daughter's son he shall be slain;<br> Wherefore he puts the damsel to this pain<br> To see no man, and thinks to scape his doom <a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 228</font></a><br> If she but live and die with barren womb;<br> And great dishonour is it unto me<br> That such a maiden lives so wretchedly;<br> And great dishonour is it to us all<br> That ill upon a guiltless head should fall<br> To save a King from what we have decreed.<br> Now, therefore, tell me, shall his impious deed<br> Save him alive, while she that might have borne<br> Great kings and glorious heroes, lives forlorn<br> Of love's delight, in solitude and woe?"</p>  
 <p>   Then said the Thunderer, "Daughter, nowise so<br> Shall this be in the end; heed what shall fall,<br> And let none think that any brazen wall<br> Can let the Gods from doing what shall be."</p>  
 <p>   Now therewithal went Venus to the sea<br> Glad of her father's words, and, as she went,<br> Unseen the gladness of the spring she sent<br> Across the happy lands oer which she moved,<br> Until all men felt joyous and beloved.<br>    But while to Paphos carelessly she fared,<br> All day upon the tower the hot sun glared,<br> And Danaë within that narrow space<br> Went to and fro, and sometimes hid her face<br> Between her hands, moaning in her despair,<br> Or sometimes tore the fillets from her hair,<br> And sometimes would begin a piteous tale<br> Unto her maids, and in the midst would fail <a name="page_229"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 229</font></a><br> For sobs and tears; but mostly would she sit<br> Over against the window, watching it,<br> And feel the light wind blowing from the sea<br> Against her face, with hands laid listlessly<br> Together in her lap; so passed the day,<br> And to their sleep her damsels went away,<br> And through the dead of night she slept awhile,<br> But when the dawn came, woke up with a smile,<br> As though she had forgotten all her pain,<br> But soon the heavy burden felt again,<br> And on her bed lay tossing wretchedly,<br> Until the sun had nigh looked oer the sea.<br>    In that fresh morn was no one stirring yet,<br> And many a man his troubles did forget<br> Buried in sleep, but nothing she forgat,<br> She raised herself and up in bed she sat,<br> And towards the window turned round wearily<br> To watch the changing colours of the sky;<br> And many a time she sighed, and seemed as though<br> She would have told the story of her woe<br> To whatsoever god near by might be<br> Betwixt the grey sky and the cold grey sea,<br> But to her lips no sound at all would rise,<br> Except those oft repeated heavy sighs.<br>    And yet, indeed, within a little while<br> Her face grew calm, the shadow of a smile<br> Stole oer her parted lips and sweet grey eyes,<br> And slowly from the bed did she arise,<br> And towards the window drew, and yet did seem, <a name="page_230"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 230</font></a><br> Although her eyes were open, still to dream.<br>    There on the sill she laid her slender hand,<br> And looking seaward, pensive did she stand,<br> And seemed as though she waited for the sun<br> To bring her news her misery was done;<br> At last he came and over the green sea<br> His golden road shone out right gloriously,<br> And into Danae's face his glory came<br> And lit her softly waving hair like flame.<br> But in his light she held out both her hands,<br> As though he brought her from some far-off lands<br> Healing for all her great distress and woe.<br>    But yellower now the sunbeams seemed to grow<br> Not whiter as their wont is, and she heard<br> A tinkling sound that made her, half afeard,<br> Draw back a little from the fresh green sea,<br> Then to a clang the noise rose suddenly,<br> And gently was she smitten on the breast,<br> And some bright thing within her palm did rest,<br> And trickled down her shoulder and her side,<br> And on her limbs a little did abide,<br> Or lay upon her feet a little while.<br>    Then in her face increased the doubtful smile,<br> While oer her eyes a drowsy film there came,<br> And in her cheeks a flush as if of shame,<br> And, looking round about, could she behold<br> The chamber scattered oer with shining gold,<br> That grew, till ankle-deep she stood in it.<br>    Then through her limbs a tremor did there flit <a name="page_231"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 231</font></a><br> As through white water runs the summer wind,<br> And many a wild hope came into her mind,<br> But her knees bent and soft she sank down there,<br> And on the gold was spread her golden hair,<br> And like an ivory image still she lay,<br> Until the night again had hidden day.</p>  
 <p>   But when again she lifted up her head,<br> She found herself laid soft within her bed,<br> While midmost of the room the taper shone,<br> And all her damsels from the place were gone,<br> And by her head a gold-robed man there stood,<br> At sight of whom the damsel's shamefast blood<br> Made all her face red to the golden hair,<br> And quick she covered up her bosom fair.</p>  
 <p>   Then in a great voice said he, "Danaë,<br> Sweet child, be glad, and have no fear of me,<br> And have no shame, nor hide from thy new love<br> The breast that on this day has pillowed Jove.<br> Come now, come from that balmy nest of thine,<br> And stand with me beneath the taper's shine<br> That I may see thy beauty once again;<br> Then never shalt thou be in any pain,<br> But if thou liftest up thy face to Jove<br> I shall be kind to my sweet simple love;<br> I shall bethink me of thy body sweet,<br> From golden head to rosy little feet."<br>    Then, trembling sore, from out the bed she came <a name="page_232"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 232</font></a><br> And hid away her face for dread and shame,<br> But soon she trembled more for very love,<br> To feel the loving hands of mighty Jove<br> Draw down her hands, and kisses on the head<br> And tender bosom, as again he said,<br> "Now must I go; and sweet love, Danae,<br> Fear nothing more that man can do to thee,<br> For soon shall come an ending to thy woe,<br> And thou shalt have a son whose name shall grow<br> Still greater, till the mountains melt away<br> And men no more can tell the night from day."</p>  
 <p>   Then forth he sprang and oer the sea did fly<br> And loud it thundered from a cloudless sky.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>SO when her damsels came to her next day,<br> And thought to see her laid in her old way<br> Upon the bed, and looking out to sea<br> Moaning full oft, and sighing heavily,<br> They found her singing oer a web of silk<br> Where through the even warp as white as milk<br> Quick flew the shuttle from her arm of snow,<br> And somewhat from her girded gown did show<br> On the black treadles both her rosy feet,<br> Moving a little as the tall green wheat <a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 233</font></a><br> Moves in the June when Zephyr blows on it,<br> So, like a goddess weaving did she sit.<br>    But when she saw her maidens wondering stand<br> She ceased her song and stayed her busy hand,<br> And said, "Girls, if ye see me glad to-day<br> Be nought amazed, for all things pass away;<br> The good days die, but also die the bad.<br>    "See now, in sleep last night a dream I had<br> That in his claws an eagle lifted me<br> And bore me to a land across the sea:<br> Wherefore I think that here I shall not die<br> But live to feel dew falling from the sky,<br> And set my feet deep in the meadow grass<br> And underneath the scented pine-trees pass,<br> Or in the garden feel the western breeze,<br> The herald of the rain, sweep through the trees,<br> Or in the hottest of the summer day,.<br> Betwixt green banks within the mill-stream play.<br>    "For either shall my father soon relent,<br> Or for my sake some marvel shall be sent,<br> And either way these doors shall open wide;<br> And then doubt not to see me soon a bride<br> With some king's amorous son before my feet.<br>    "Ah! verily my life shall then be sweet;<br> Before these days I knew not life or death,<br> With little hope or fear I drew my breath,<br> But now when all this sorrow is oerpast,<br> Then shall I feel how sweet life is at last,<br> And know how dear peace is from all these fears. <a name="page_234"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 234</font></a><br>    "So no more will I waste my life in tears,<br> But pass the time as swiftly as may be,<br> Until ye step out on the turf with me."</p>  
 <p>   Then glad they were, when such-like words they heard,<br> And yet some doubted and were sore afeard<br> That she had grown light-headed with her woe,<br> Dreading the time might come when she would throw<br> Her body on the ground and perish there,<br> Slain by her own hand mighty with despair.<br> Nathless the days more merrily went by<br> And from that prison men heard minstrelsy,<br> When nought but mourning, fisher-folk afeard<br> Who passed that way, in other times had heard.</p>  
 <p>   Yet truly Danae said that all things pass<br> And are forgotten; in that house of brass<br> Forgotten was the stunning bitter pain<br> Wherewith she entered it, and yet again<br> In no long time, hope was forgotten too<br> When wringing torments moaning from her drew,<br> And to and fro the pale scared damsels went,<br> And those her guards unto Acrisius sent.<br>    But ere the messenger returned again<br> She had been eased of half her bitterest pain,<br> And on her breast a fair man-child was laid;<br> Then round the messenger her maids afraid<br> Drew weeping; but he charged them earnestly, <a name="page_235"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 235</font></a><br> Ever to watch her in that chamber high,<br> Lest any man should steal the babe away,<br> And so to bide until there came a day<br> When on her feet she might arise and go,<br> Whereof by messengers the King must know;<br> So, threatening torments unendurable,<br> If any harm through treachery befell,<br> He left them, and no more to them he told,<br> But in his face the sooth they might behold.<br>    Now, therefore when some wretched days were past,<br> And trembling by the bed she stood at last,<br> She heard the opening of the outer door,<br> And footsteps came again from floor to floor,<br> And soon with all-armed men her chamber shone,<br> Who with few words now led her forth alone<br> Adown the stairs from out the brazen place;<br> And on her hot hands, and her tear-stained face<br> Half-fainting, the pine-scented air she felt,<br> And all about the salt sea savour smelt,<br> And in her ears the dashing of the sea<br> Rang ever; thus the God had set her free.<br>    But by the shore further they led her still<br> To where the sea beat on a barren hill,<br> And a long stage of timber met the sea,<br> At end whereof was tossing fearfully<br> A little boat that had no oars or sail,<br> Or aught that could the mariner avail.<br> Thither with her their steps the soldiers bent,<br> And as along the narrow way they went <a name="page_236"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 236</font></a><br> The salt waves leapt aloft to kiss her feet<br> And in the wind streamed out her tresses sweet;<br> But little heed she took of feet or head<br> For nought she doubted she to death was led,<br> But ever did she hold against her breast<br> The little babe, and spoke not for the rest,<br> No, not when in the boat they bade her go,<br> And twixt its bulwarks thin she lay alow,<br> Nor when adrift they set her presently<br> And all about was but the angry sea.</p>  
 <p>   No word she said until the sun was down,<br> And she beheld the moon that on no town,<br> On no fair homestead, no green pasture shone,<br> But lit up the unwearied sea alone;<br> No word she said till she was far from shore<br> And on her breast the babe was wailing sore,<br> And then she lifted up her face to Jove,<br> And said, "O thou who once didst call me love,<br> Hast thou forgotten those fair words of thine,<br> When underneath the taper's glimmering shine<br> Thou badst me stand that thou mightst look on me,<br> And love thou calldst me, and sweet Danae?<br> Now of thy promised help am I most fain<br> For on what day can I have greater pain<br> Than this wherein to-night my body is,<br> And brought thereto by what, but thy sweet kiss?"<br>    But neither did she pray the God in vain;<br> For straight he set himself to end her pain, <a name="page_237"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 237</font></a><br> And while he cast on her a gentle sleep,<br> The winds within their houses did he keep<br> Except the west which soft on her did blow,<br> That swiftly through the sea the boat might go.</p>  
 <p>   Far out to sea a certain isle doth lie<br> Men call Seriphos, craggy, steep, and high:<br> It rises up on every side but one,<br> And mariners its ill-famed headlands shun;<br> But toward the south the meads slope soft adown,<br> Until they meet the yellow sands and brown,<br> That slope themselves so gently to the sea,<br> The nymphs are hidden only to the knee<br> When half a mile of rippling water is<br> Between the waves that their white limbs do kiss<br> And the last wave that washes shells ashore.<br>    To this fair place the west wind onward bore<br> The skiff that carried Danae and her son,<br> And on the morn, when scarce the dusk was done,<br> Upon the sands the shallop ran aground;<br> And still they slept, and for awhile around<br> Their wretched bed the waves sang lullaby,<br> But sank at last and left the long strand dry.<br>    Then uprose Danaë, and nothing knew<br> What land it was: about her sea-fowl flew;<br> Behind her back the yet retreating sea<br> Beat on the yellow sands unceasingly;<br> Landward she saw the low green meadows lie,<br> Dotted with homesteads, rich with elm-trees high; <a name="page_238"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 238</font></a><br> And at her feet the little boat there lay<br> That happily had brought her on the way.<br>    But as it happed, the brother of the King<br> Had ridden forth to hear the sea-fowl sing,<br> With hawk on fist, right early on that morn,<br> Hard by the place whereunto she was borne.<br> He, seeing far away a white thing stand,<br> Deemed her at first some maiden of the sand,<br> Such as to fishers sings a honied strain,<br> And leaves them longing for her love in vain.<br> So, wishful to behold the sea-folk's bride,<br> He set the spurs into his horse's side.<br> But drawing nigher, he but saw her there,<br> Not moving much, her unbound yellow hair<br> Heavy with dew and washing of the sea;<br> And her wet raiment clinging amorously<br> About her body, in the wind's despite;<br> And in her arms her woe and her delight,<br> Spreading abroad the small hands helplessly<br> That on some day should still the battle's cry.<br> And furthermore he saw where by her lay<br> The boat that brought her oer the watery way:<br> Then, though he knew not whence she might have come,<br> He doubted not the firm land was her home.</p>  
 <p>   But when he came anigh, beholding him,<br> She fell a trembling in her every limb,<br> And kneeling to him held the young babe out, <a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 239</font></a><br> And said: "O Sir, if, as I have no doubt,<br> In this strange land thou art a king and lord,<br> Speak unto me some comfortable word.<br>    "Born of a king who rules a lovely land,<br> I in my house that by the sea doth stand,<br> With all my girls, made merry on a day:<br> Now some of them upon the sands did play,<br> Dancing unto their fellows' minstrelsy;<br> And some it pleased upon sweet flowers to lie,<br> Ripe fruits around, and thence to look on them;<br> And some were fain to lift their kirtles' hem,<br> And through the shallows chase the fishes fleet;<br> But in this shallop would I have my seat<br> Alone, and holding this my little son,<br> And knowing not that my good days were done.<br>    "Now how it chanced, in sooth I cannot say,<br> But yet I think that one there was that day,<br> Who for some hidden cause did hate me sore,<br> Who cut the cord that bound me to the shore,<br> And soon amidst my helpless shrieks the boat,<br> Oarless and sailless, out to sea did float.<br>    "But now that many a danger has been passed,<br> The gods have sent me to your land at last,<br> Alive, indeed, but such-like as you see,<br> Cold and drenched through with washing of the sea,<br> Half-clad, and kneeling on an unknown land, .<br> And for a morsel holding out my hand."</p>  
 <p>   Then said he, "Lady, fear not any more, <a name="page_240"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 240</font></a><br> For you are come unto no savage shore,<br> But here shall be a queen as erst at home:<br> And if thou askest whereto thou art come,<br> This is the isle Seriphos; and for me,<br> My name is Dictys, and right royally<br> My brother lives, the king of all the isle.<br> Him shalt thou see within a little while,<br> And doubtless he will give thee everything<br> That longs unto the daughter of a king.<br>    "Meanwhile I bid thee in mine house to rest,<br> And there thy wearied body shall be dressed<br> In seemly raiment by my women slaves,<br> And thou shalt wash thee from the bitter waves,<br> And eat and drink, and sleep full easily;<br> And on the morrow shalt thou come with me<br> And take King Polydectes by the hand,<br> Who in good peace rules oer this quiet land."<br>    Then on his horse he set the Queen, while he<br> Walked by the side thereof right soberly,<br> And half asleep, as slow they went along,<br> She laid her hand upon the war-horse strong,<br> While Dictys by her side Jove's offspring bore,<br> And thus they left the sea-beat yellow shore.<br> And as one dreaming to the house she came,<br> Where in the sun the brazen doors did flame;<br> And there she ate and drank as in a dream;<br> Dreamlike to her the scented bath did seem<br> After the icy sprinkling of the waves,<br> And like a dream the fair, slim women-slaves, <a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 241</font></a><br> Who laid her in the fair bed, where she slept<br> Dreamless, until the horned white moon had stept<br> Over the fresh pine-scented hills again.<br>    But when the sun next day drave forth his wain,<br> The damsel, clad in queen-like gold array,<br> With Dictys to the palace took her way;<br> And there by minstrels duly were they met,<br> Who brought them to the great hall, where was set<br> The King upon a royal throne of gold:<br> Black-bearded was he, thirty summers old,<br> Comely and strong, and seemed a king indeed;<br> Who, when he saw the minstrels thither lead<br> Fair Danaë, rose up to her, and said:<br> "Oh, welcome, lady! be no more afraid<br> That thou shalt lose thy state and dignity;<br> Yea, since a gem the gods have sent to me,<br> With plates of silver will I overlay<br> The casket that has brought it on the way,<br> And set it in King Neptune's house to stand<br> Until the sea shall wash away the land.<br>    "And for thyself a fair house shalt thou have<br> With all things needful, and right many a slave,<br> Both men and women; fair shall all things be<br> That thou mayst dwell here in felicity,<br> And that no care may wrinkle thy smooth brow.<br>    "And for the child, when he is old enow<br> The priests of Pallas shall of him have care,<br> And thou shalt dwell hard by her temple fair;<br> But on this good day in mine hall abide, <a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 242</font></a><br> And do me grace in sitting by my side."<br>    Then mounted she the dais and sat, and then<br> Was she beheld of all the island-men<br> Who praised her much, and praised the sturdy child,<br> Who at their shouting made as if he smiled.<br>    So passed the feast, and at the end of day<br> Towards her own house did Danae go away,<br> That stood amid Minerva's olive-trees<br> Hidden away from moaning of the seas.</p>  
 <p>   And there began fair Danae's life again,<br> And quite forgotten was her ancient pain,<br> And peacefully did day succeed to clay,<br> While fairer grew the well-loved child alway,<br> And strong and wise beyond his scanty years,<br> And in the island all his little peers<br> Held him for lord whatso might be their worth,<br> And Perseus is his name from this time forth.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>LO, eighteen summers now have come and gone<br> Since on the beach fair Danae stood alone<br> Holding her little son, nor yet was she<br> Less fair than when the hoarse unwilling sea<br> Moaned loud that Neptune drew him from her feet,<br> And the wind sighed upon her bosom sweet. <a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 243</font></a><br> For in that long past half-forgotten time,<br> While yet the world was young, and the sweet clime,<br> Golden and mild, no bitter storm-clouds bred,<br> Light lay the years upon the untroubled head,<br> And longer men lived then by many a year<br> Than in these days, when every week is dear.</p>  
 <p>   Now on a day was held a royal feast<br> Whereon there should be slain full many a beast<br> Unto Minerva; thereto the King came,<br> And in his heart love lit a greedy flame<br> At sight of Danae's arms stretched out in prayer<br> Unto the goddess, and her yellow hair,<br> Wreathed round with olive wreaths, that hung adown<br> Over the soft folds of her linen gown;<br> And when at last he took her by the hand<br> Speechless by her did Polydectes stand,<br> So much with fond desire bewildered<br> At sight of all that wondrous white and red,<br> That peaceful face wherein all past distress<br> Had melted into perfect loveliness.<br>    So when that night he lay upon his bed,<br> Full many a thought he turned within his head<br> Of how he best might unto that attain,<br> Whose lack now filled him with such burning pain.<br> And at the first it seemed a little thing<br> For him who was a rich man and a king,<br> Either by gifts to win her, or to send<br> And fetch her thither, and perforce to end <a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 244</font></a><br> Her widowhood; but then there came the thought,<br> "By force or gifts hither she might be brought,<br> And here might I get that for which I long,<br> Yet has she here a son both brave and strong,<br> Nor will he think it much to end my days<br> If he may get thereby the people's praise,<br> Een if therewith he shortly needs must die;<br> Ah, verily, a purblind fool was I,<br> That when I first beheld that matchless face<br> I had no eyes to see her heavenly grace;<br> Then with few words might I have held her here<br> And kept her for mine own with little fear;<br> But now I have no will the lad to slay,<br> For he would be revenged some evil day,<br> Who now Jove's offspring do I think to be,<br> So dowered he is with might and majesty.<br>    "Yet could I find perchance some fair pretence<br> Whereby with honour I might send him hence,<br> Nor have the youngling's blood upon my head,<br> Then might he be well nigh as good as dead."<br>    So pondering on his bed long time he lay,<br> Until the night began to mix with day,<br> And then he smiled and so to sleep turned round,<br> As though at last some sure way he had found.</p>  
 <p>   And now it chanced to come round to the day,<br> When all the lords clad in their rich array<br> Unto the King should come for royal feast;<br> And there the way was, that both most and least <a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 245</font></a><br> Should thither bear some present for the King,<br> As horse or sword, gold chain, fair cup, or ring.<br> Unto which feast was Perseus bidden now<br> Who giftless came, bare as the winter bough,<br> For little was his wealth in that strange land.<br>    So there ashamed it was his lot to stand,<br> Before the guests were called to meat, and when<br> He sat amidst those royally-clad men<br> Little he spake for shame of his estate,<br> Not knowing yet his god-like birth and great.<br>    So passed the feast, and when the full time came<br> To show the gifts, he waxed all red for shame:<br> For through the hall white horses were brought up,<br> And well-clad slaves, and many a dainty cup,<br> And many a gem well set in brooch or ring,<br> And laid before the daïs of the King.<br> But all alone of great folk of the land<br> With eyes cast down for rage did Perseus stand,<br> Yet for his manhood thence he would not go.<br>    Now some that secretly were bidden so,<br> Beholding him began to gibe and jeer,<br> Yet not too loud, held back perchance by fear,<br> And thus a murmur spread about the hall<br> As, each to each, men cast about the ball,<br> Which the King heard, or seemed to hear at last,<br> And round the noisy hall a look he cast,<br> And then beholding Perseus with a smile<br> He said, "Good friends, fair lords, be still awhile,<br> And say no ill about this giftless guest, <a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 246</font></a><br> For truly not the worst, if scarce the best,<br> I hold him, and forsooth so rich 1 live<br> Within this land, that I myself may give<br> Somewhat to him, nor yet take from him aught,<br> And when I bade him here this was my thought."<br>    Then stretching out his arm did he take up<br> From off the board, a jewelled golden cup<br> And said, "O Perseus, come and sit by me,<br> And from my hand take this, that thou dost see<br> And be my friend." Then Perseus drew anear,<br> And took the cup and said, "This shall be dear<br> Unto mine eyes while on the earth I live;<br> And yet a gift I in my turn may give,<br> When to this land comes bitter war, or when<br> Some enemy thou hast among great men;<br> Yea, sire, among these knights and lords I swear<br> To do whatso thou biddst me without fear."</p>  
 <p>   Then the King smiled and said, "Yea, verily,<br> Then wilt thou give a great gift unto me,<br> Nor yet, forsooth, too early by a day;<br> To-morrow mayst thou be upon thy way.<br>    "Far in the western sea a land there is<br> Desert and vast, and emptied of all bliss,<br> Where dwell the Gorgons wretchedly enow;<br> Two of them die not, one above her brow<br> And wretched head bears serpents, for the shame<br> That on an ill day fell upon her name,<br> When in Minerva's shrine great sin was wrought, <a name="page_247"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 247</font></a><br> For thither by the Sea-god she was brought,<br> And in the maiden's house in love they mixed;<br> Who wrathful, in her once fair tresses fixed<br> 'That snaky brood, and shut her evermore<br> Within a land west of the Lybian shore.<br>    "Now if a king could gain this snaky head<br> Full well for war were he apparelled,<br> Because no man may look thereon and live.<br> A great gift, therefore, Perseus, wouldst thou give<br> If thou shouldst bring this wonder unto me;<br> And for the place, far in the western sea<br> It lies, I say, but nothing more I know,<br> Therefore I bid thee, to some wise man go<br> Who has been used this many a day to pore<br> Oer ancient books of long-forgotten lore."</p>  
 <p>   Thus spoke the King, knowing the while full well<br> None but a god of that far land could tell.<br>    But Perseus answered, "O my Lord, the King,<br> Thou settest me to win a dreadful thing,<br> Yet for thy bounty this gift will I give<br> Unto thine hands, if I should chance to live."<br>    With that he turned, and silent, full of thought,<br> From out the hall he passed not noting aught,<br> And toward his home he went but soberly,<br> And thence went forth an ancient man to see<br> He hoped might tell him that he wished to know<br> And to what land it were the best to go.<br> But when he told the elder all the tale, <a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 248</font></a><br> He shook his head, and said, "Nought will avail<br> My lore for this, nor dwells the man on earth<br> Whose wisdom for this thing will be of worth,<br> Yea, to this dreadful land no man shall win<br> Unless some god himself shall help therein;<br> Therefore, my son, I rede thee stay at home,<br> For thou shalt have full many a chance to roam<br> Seeking for something that all men love well,<br> Not for an unknown isle where monsters dwell."</p>  
 <p>   Then forth again went Perseus soberly<br> And walked along the border of the sea,<br> Upon the yellow sands where first he came<br> That time that he was deemed his mother's shame.<br>    And now was it the first hour of the night,<br> Therefore within the west a yellow light<br> Yet shone, though risen was the horned moon,<br> Whose lonely cold grey beams would quench it soon,<br> Though now her light was shining doubtfully<br> On the wet sands, for low down was the sea<br> But rising, and the salt-sea wind blew strong<br> And drave the hurrying breakers swift along.<br> So there walked Perseus thinking many a thing<br> About those last words of the wily king,<br> And as he went at last he came upon<br> An ancient woman, who said, "Fair, my son,<br> What dost thou wandering here in the cold night?<br> When in the King's hall glance from shade to light<br> The golden sandals of the dancing girls, <a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 249</font></a><br> And in the gold cups set with gems and pearls<br> The wine shines fair that glads the heart of man;<br> What dost thou wandering neath the moonlight wan?"</p>  
 <p>   "This have I done," said he, "as one should swear<br> To make the vine bear bunches twice a year,<br> For I have sworn the Gorgon's head to bring<br> A worthy gift unto our island King,<br> When neither I, nor any man can tell<br> In what far land apart from men they dwell.<br> Some god alone can help me in my need;<br> And yet unless somehow I do the deed<br> An exile I must be from this fair land,<br> Nor with my peers shall I have heart to stand."<br>    Grim in the moonlight smiled the aged crone,<br> And said, "If living there thou comst, alone<br> Of all men yet, what thinkest thou to do?<br> Then verily thy journey shalt thou rue,<br> For whoso looks upon that face meets death,<br> That in his sick heart freezes up his breath<br> Until he has the semblance of a stone."<br>    But Perseus answered straightly to the crone,<br> "O Mother, if the gods but give me grace<br> To come anigh that fair and dreadful face,<br> Well may they give me grace enough also<br> Their enemy and mine to lay alow."<br>    Now as he spake, the white moon risen high<br> Burst from a cloud, and shone out gloriously,<br> And down the sands her path of silver shone, <a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 250</font></a><br> And lighted full upon that ancient crone;<br> And there a marvel Perseus saw indeed,<br> Because in face, in figure, and in weed,<br> She wholly changed before his wondering eyes.<br>    Now tall and straight her figure did arise,<br> That erst seemed bent with weight of many a year,<br> And on her head a helmet shone out clear<br> For the rent clout that held the grizzled head:<br> With a fair breastplate was she furnished,<br> From whence a hauberk to her knees fell down;<br> And underneath, a perfumed linen gown,<br> O'erwrought with many-coloured Indian silk,<br> Fell to her sandalld feet, as white as milk.<br> Grey-eyed she was, like amber shone her hair,<br> Aloft she held her right arm round and bare,<br> Whose long white fingers closed upon a spear.</p>  
 <p>   Then trembled Perseus with unwonted fear<br> When he beheld before him Pallas stand,<br> And with bowed head he stood and outstretched hand:<br> But she smiled on him softly, and she said,<br> "Hold up again, O Perseus, thy fair head,<br> Because thou art indeed my father's son,<br> And in this quest that now thou goest upon<br> Thou shalt not fail: I swear it by my head,<br> And that black water all immortals dread.<br>    "Look now before my feet, and thou shalt see<br> Four helpful things the high gods lend to thee,<br> Not willing thou shouldst journey forth in vain: <a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 251</font></a><br> Hermes himself, the many-eyed one's bane,<br> Gives these two-winged shoes, to carry thee<br> Tireless high over every land and sea;<br> This cap is his whose chariot caught away<br> The maid of Enna from her gentle play;<br> And if thou art hard-pressed of any one<br> Set this on thee, and so be seen of none:<br> The halting god was craftsman of this blade,<br> No better shone, when, making heaven afraid,<br> The giants round our golden houses cried,<br> For neither brass nor steel its edge can bide,<br> Or flinty rocks or gleaming adamant:<br> With these, indeed, but one thing dost thou want,<br> And that I give thee; little needst thou reck<br> Of those grey hopeless eyes, if round thy neck<br> Thou hangst this shield, that, hanging once on mine,<br> In the grim giant's hopeless eyes did shine.<br>    "And now be strong, and fly forth with good heart<br> Far northward, till thou seest the ice-walls part<br> The weary sea from snow-clad lands and wan:<br> There dwell the Gorgons ancient sisters three<br> Men call the Graiæ, who make shift to see<br> With one eye, which they pass from hand to hand.<br> Now make thyself unseen in this white land<br> And snatch the eye, while crooning songs they sit,<br> From hand to withered hand still passing it;<br> And let them buy it back by telling thee<br> How thou shalt find within the western sea<br> The unknown country where their sisters dwell. <a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 252</font></a><br>    "Which thing unto thee I myself would tell,<br> But when with many a curse I set them there,<br> I in my wrath by a great oath did swear<br> I would not name again the country grey<br> Wherein they dwell, with little light of day.<br>    "Good speed, O Perseus; make no tarrying,<br> But straightly set thyself to do this thing."</p>  
 <p>   Now as his ears yet rung with words like these,<br> And on the sand he sank upon his knees<br> Before the goddess, there he knelt alone<br> As in a dream; but still the white moon shone<br> Upon the sword, the shield, and cap and shoes,<br> Which half adrad he was at first to use,<br> Until the goddess gave him heart at last,<br> And his own gear in haste aside he cast,<br> And armed himself in that wild, lonely place:<br> Then turning round, northward he set his face,<br> And rose aloft and oer the lands gan fly,<br> Betwixt the green earth and the windy sky.<br>    Young was the night when first he left the sands<br> Of small Seriphos, but right many lands<br> Before the moon was down his winged feet<br> Had borne him over, tireless, strong, and fleet.<br> Then in the starlight black beneath him lay<br> The German forests, where the wild swine play,<br> Fearless of what Diana's maids may do,<br> Who ever have more will to wander through<br> The warm and grassy woods of Thessaly, <a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 253</font></a><br> Or in Sicilian orange-gardens lie.<br>    But ere the hot sun on his arms gan shine<br> He had passed oer the Danube and the Rhine,<br> And heard the faint sound of the northern sea;<br> But ever northward flew untiringly,<br> Till Thule lay beneath his feet at last.<br> Then oer its desert icy hills he passed,<br> And on beneath a feeble sun he flew,<br> Till, rising like a wall, the cliffs he knew<br> That Pallas told him of: the sun was high,<br> But on the pale ice shone but wretchedly;<br> Pale blue the great mass was, and cold enow;<br> Grey tattered moss hung from its jagged brow,<br> No wind was there at all, though ever beat<br> The leaden tideless sea against its feet.</p>  
 <p>   Then lighted Perseus on that dreary land,<br> And when on the white plain his feet did stand<br> He saw no sign of either beast or man,<br> Except that near by rose a palace wan,<br> Built of some metal that he could not name.<br> Thither he went, and to a great door came<br> That stood wide open, so without a word<br> He entered in, and drew his deadly sword,<br> Though neither sword or man could you behold<br> More than folk see their death ere they grow old.<br>    So having entered, through a cloïster grey<br> With cautious steps and slow he took his way,<br> At end whereof he found a mighty hall; <a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 254</font></a><br> Where, bare of hangings, a white marble wall<br> And milk-white pillars held the roof aloft,<br> And nothing was therein of fair or soft;<br> And at one end, upon a dais high,<br> There sat the crones that had the single eye,<br> Clad in blue sweeping cloak and snow-white gown;<br> While oer their backs their straight white hair hung down<br> In long thin locks; dreadful their faces were<br> Carved all about with wrinkles of despair;<br> And as they sat they crooned a dreary song,<br> Complaining that their lives should last so long,<br> In that sad place that no one came anear,<br> In that wan place desert of hope and fear;<br> And singing, still they rocked their bodies bent,<br> And ever each to each the eye they sent.</p>  
 <p>   Awhile stood Perseus gazing on the three<br> Then sheathed his sword, and toward them warily<br> He went, and from the last one snatched the eye,<br> Who, feeling it gone from her, with a cry<br> Sprung up and said, "O sisters, he is here<br> That we were warned so long ago to fear,<br> And verily he has the eye of me."<br>    Then those three, thinking they no more should see<br> What feeble light the sun could show them there,<br> And that of all joys now their life was bare,<br> Began a wailing and lamenting sore<br> That they were worse than ever heretofore. <a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 255</font></a><br>    Then Perseus cried, "Unseen am I indeed,<br> But yet a mortal man, who have a need<br> Your wisdom can make good, if so ye will;<br> Now neither do I wish you any ill,<br> Nor this your treasure will I keep from you<br> If ye will tell me what I needs must do<br> To gain, upon the earth or under it,<br> The dreary country where your sisters sit:<br> Of whom, as wise men say, the one is fair<br> As any goddess, but with snaky hair<br> And body that shall perish on some day,<br> While the two others ancient are, and grey<br> As ye be, but shall see the whole world die."<br>    Then said they, "Rash man, give us back the eye<br> Or rue this day, for wretched as we are,<br> Beholding not fair peace or godlike war,<br> Or any of the deeds of men at all,<br> Yet are we strong, and on thy head shall fall<br> Our heavy curses, and but dismally<br> Thy life shall pass until thou comst to die."<br>    "Make no delay," he said, "to do this thing,<br> Or this your cherished sight I soon shall fling<br> Into the sea, or burn it up with fire."<br>    "What else, what else, but this wilt thou desire?"<br> They said, "Wilt thou have long youth at our hands?<br> Or wilt thou be the king of lovely lands?<br> Or store up wealth to lead thy life in mirth?<br> Or wilt thou have the beauty of the earth<br> With all her kindness for thy very own? <a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 256</font></a><br> Choose what thou wilt except this thing alone."<br>    "Nay," said he, "for nought else I left my home,<br> For this sole knowledge hither am I come,<br> Not all unholpen of the gods above;<br> Nor yet shall words my stedfast purpose move."<br>    Then with that last word did he hold his peace,<br> And they no less from wailing words did cease,<br> Hoping that in that silence he might think<br> Of their dread words and from the evils shrink<br> Wherewith they threatened him; but in his heart<br> Most godlike courage fit for such a part<br> The white-armed goddess of the loom had set,<br> Nor in that land her help did he forget.</p>  
 <p>   Withal, when many an hour had now gone by,<br> Together did the awesome sisters cry,<br> "O man! O man! hear that which thou wouldst know,<br> And with thy knowledge let the dread curse go,<br> We, least of all, have scaped, of those who dwell<br> Upon this wretched fire-concealing shell.<br> Slave of the cruel gods! go, get ye hence,<br> And storing deeds for fruitless penitence,<br> Go east, as though in Scythia was your home,<br> But when unto the wind-beat seas ye come<br> Stop short, and turn round to the south again<br> Until ye reach the western land of Spain;<br> There take your way unto the narrow seas<br> That wash the pillars of great Hercules,<br> And thenceforth go thou westward as thou mayst <a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 257</font></a><br> Until ye find a dark land long laid waste,<br> Where green cliffs rise from out an inky sea,<br> But no green leaf may grow on bush or tree.<br> No sun makes day there, no moon lighteth night,<br> The long years there must pass in grey twilight;<br> There dwell our sisters, walking dismally,<br> Between the dull-brown caverns and the sea.</p>  
 <p>   "Tool in the hands of gods! do there thy might!<br> Nor fall like us, nor strive for peace and right;<br> But give our own unto us and be gone,<br> And leave us to our misery alone."</p>  
 <p>   Then straight he put the eye into the hand<br> Of her that spoke, and turned from that white land,<br> Leaving them singing their grim song again.<br> But flying forth he came at last to Spain,<br> And so unto the southern end of it,<br> And then with restless wings due west did flit.<br> For many a day across the sea he flew,<br> That lay beneath him clear enough and blue,<br> Until at last rose such a thick grey mist,<br> That of what lay beneath him nought he wist;<br> But still through this he flew a night and day<br> Hearkening the washing of the watery way,<br> Unseen: but when, at ending of the night,<br> The mist was gone and grey sea came in sight,<br> He thought that he had reached another world;<br> This way and that the leaden seas were hurled, <a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 258</font></a><br> Moved by no wind, but by some unseen power;<br> Twilight it was and still his feet dropped lower,<br> As through the thickening, dim hot air he passed,<br> Until he feared to reach the sea at last.<br>    But even as his feet dragged in the sea,<br> He, praying to the goddess fervently,<br> Felt her good help, for soon he rose again<br> Three fathoms up, and flew with lessened pain;<br> And looking through the dimness could behold<br> The wretched land whereof the sisters told.<br> And soon could see how down the green cliffs fell<br> A yellow stream, that from some inland well<br> Arose, and through the land ran sluggishly,<br> Until it poured with dull plash in the sea<br> Like molten lead; and nigher as he came<br> He saw great birds, whose kind he could not name,<br> That whirling noiselessly about did seem<br> To seek a prey within that leaden stream;<br> And drawing nigher yet, at last he saw<br> That many of them held, with beak or claw,<br> Great snakes they tore still flying through the air.<br> Then making for the cliff and lighting there<br> He saw, indeed, that tawny stream and dull<br> Of intertwining writhen snakes was full,<br> So, with a shudder, thence he turned away,<br> And through the untrodden land he took his way.<br>    Now cave-pierced rocks there rose up everywhere,<br> And gaunt old trees, of leaves and fruit all bare;<br> And midst this wretchedness a mighty hall, <a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 259</font></a><br> Whose great stones made a black and shining wall;<br> The doors were open, and thence came a cry<br> Of one in anguish wailing bitterly;<br> Then oer its threshold passed the son of Jove,<br> Well shielded by the grey-eyed Maiden's love.<br>    Now there he saw two women bent and old,<br> Like to those three that erst he did behold<br> Far northward, sitting well-nigh motionless,<br> Their eyes grown stony with their long distress,<br> Stared out at nought, and still no sound they made,<br> And on their knees their wrinkled hands were laid.<br>    But a third woman paced about the hall,<br> And ever turned her head from wall to wall<br> And moaned aloud, and shrieked in her despair;<br> Because the golden tresses of her hair<br> Were moved by writhing snakes from side to side,<br> That in their writhing oftentimes would glide<br> On to her breast, or shuddering shoulders white;<br> Or, falling down, the hideous things would light<br> Upon her feet, and crawling thence would twine<br> Their slimy folds about her ankles fine.<br> But in a thin red garment was she clad,<br> And round her waist a jewelled band she had,<br> The gift of Neptune on the fatal day<br> When fate her happiness first put away.<br>    So there awhile unseen did Perseus stand,<br> With softening heart, and doubtful trembling hand<br> Laid on his sword hilt, muttering, "Would that she<br> Had never turned her woeful face to me." <a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 260</font></a><br> But therewith Pallas smote him with this thought,<br> "Does she desire to live, who has been brought<br> Into such utter woe and misery,<br> Wherefrom no god or man can set her free,<br> Since Pallas' dreadful vow shall bind her fast,<br> Till earth and heaven are gone, and all is past?<br> And yet, would God the thing were at an end."<br>    Then with that word, he saw her stop and rend<br> The raiment from her tender breast and soft,<br> And with a great cry lift her arms aloft;<br> Then on her breast her head sank, as she said,<br> "O ye, be merciful, and strike me dead!<br> How many an one cries unto you to live,<br> Which gift ye find no little thing to give,<br> O give it now to such, and unto me<br> That other gift from which all people flee!<br>    "O was it not enough to take away<br> The flowery meadows and the light of day?<br> Or not enough to take away from me<br> The once-loved faces that I used to see;<br> To take away sweet sounds and melodies,<br> The song of birds, the rustle of the trees;<br> To make the prattle of the children cease,<br> And wrap my soul in shadowy hollow peace,<br> Devoid of longing? Ah, no, not for me!<br> For those who die your friends this rest shall be;<br> For me no rest from shame and sore distress,<br> For me no moment of forgetfulness;<br> For me a soul that still might love and hate, <a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 261</font></a><br> Shut in this fearful land and desolate,<br> Changed by mine eyes to horror and to stone;<br> For me perpetual anguish all alone,<br> Midst many a tormenting misery,<br> Because I know not if I eer shall die.<br>    "And yet, and yet, thee will I pray unto,<br> Thou dweller in the varying halls of blue,<br> Fathoms beneath the treacherous bridge of lands.<br> Call now to mind that day upon the sands,<br> Hard by the house of Pallas white and cold,<br> Where hidden in some wave thou didst behold<br> This body, fearless of the cold grey sea,<br> And dowered as yet with fresh virginity.<br>    "How many things thou promisedst me then!<br> Who among all the daughters of great men<br> Should be like me? what sweet and happy life!<br> What peace, if all the world should be at strife,<br> Thou promisedst me then! Lay all aside,<br> And give unto the great Earth-Shaker's bride<br> That which the wretch shut up in prison drear,<br> Deprived of all, yet ceases not to fear;<br> That which all men fear more than all distress,<br> Irrevocable dull forgetfulness."</p>  
 <p>   Her constant woeful prayer was heard at last,<br> For now behind her unseen Perseus passed,<br> And silently whirled the great sword around;<br> And when it fell, she fell upon the ground,<br> And felt no more of all her bitter pain. <a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 262</font></a><br>    But from their seats rose up with curses vain<br> The two immortals when they saw her fall<br> Headless upon the floor, and loud gan call<br> On those that came not, because far away<br> Their friends and kindred were upon that day.<br> Then to and fro about the hall they ran<br> To find the slayer, were he god or man,<br> And when unseen from out the place he drew,<br> Upon the unhappy corpse, with wails, they threw<br> Their wretched and immortal bodies old:<br> But when the one the other did behold,<br> Alive and hideous there before her eyes,<br> Such anguish for the past time would arise<br> Within their hearts, that the lone hall would ring<br> With dreadful shrieks of many an impious thing.<br>    Yet of their woe but little Perseus knew,<br> As with a stout heart south-east still he flew.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>NOW at his side a wallet Perseus bore,<br> With threads of yellow gold embroidered oer<br> Shuddering, therein he laid the fearful head,<br> Lest he unwitting yet might join the dead,<br> Or those he loved by sight of it be slain.<br>    But strong fate led him to the Lybian plain,<br> Where, at the ending of a sultry day, <a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 263</font></a><br> A palace huge and fair beneath him lay,<br> Whose roofs with silver plates were covered oer;<br> Then lighting down by its enormous door,<br> He heard unmeasured sounds of revelry,<br> And thought, 'A fair place this will be for me,<br> Who lack both food and drink, and rest this night.'<br> So turning to the ruddy flood of light,<br> Up the huge steps he toiled unto the hall;<br> But even as his eager foot did fall<br> Upon the threshold, such a mocking shout<br> Rang in his ears as Etna sendeth out<br> When, at the day's end, round the stithy cold<br> The Cyclops some unmeasured banquet hold.<br> And monstrous men could he see sitting there,<br> Burnt by the sun, with length of straight back hair,<br> And taller far than men are wont to be;<br> And at a gold-strewn daïs could he see<br> A mighty King, a fearful man to face,<br> Brown-skinned and black-haired, of the giants race,<br> Who seeing him, with thundering voice gan call,<br> "O Stranger, come forthwith into the hall,<br> Atlas would see thee!" Forth stood Perseus then,<br> And going twixt the rows of uncouth men<br> Seemed but a pigmy; but his heart was great,<br> And vain is might against the stroke of fate.<br>    Then the King cried, "Who art thou, little one?<br> Surely in thy land weak must be the sun<br> If there are bred such tender folk as thou:<br> May the gods grant such men are few enow! <a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 264</font></a><br> Art thou a king's son?" Loud he laughed withal,<br> And shouts of laughter rang throughout the hall,<br> Like clattering thunder on a July night.<br> But Perseus quailed not. "Little were my might,"<br> He said, "if helpless on the earth I were;<br> But to the equal gods my life is dear,<br> And certes victory over Jove's own son<br> By earthly men shall not be lightly won."<br>    So spake he, moving inward from the door,<br> But louder laughed the black king than before,<br> And all his people shouted at his beck;<br> Therewith he cried, "Break now this Prince's neck,<br> And take him forth and hang him up straightway<br> Before my door, that henceforth from this day<br> Pigmies and jesters may take better heed,<br> Lest at our hands they gain a liar's meed."<br>    Then started up two huge men from the board,<br> And Perseus, seeing them come, half drew his sword,<br> Looking this way and that; but in a while,<br> Upon his wallet with a deadly smile<br> He set his hand, and forth the head he drew,<br> Dead, white midst golden hair, where serpents blue<br> Yet dangled dead; and ere they stooped to take<br> His outstretched arms, before them he did shake<br> The dreadful thing: then stopped they suddenly,<br> Stone dead, without a wound or any cry.<br>    Then toward the King he held aloft the head,<br> And as he stiffened cried at him, and said,<br> "O King! when such a gift I bring to thee, <a name="page_265"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 265</font></a><br> Wilt thou be dumb and neither hear nor see?<br> Listen how sing thy men, and in thy hall<br> How swift the merry dancers feet do fall!"<br>    For now these, thinking him some god to be,<br> Cried in their fear, and made great haste to flee,<br> Crowding about the great doors of the hall,<br> Until not one was left of great or small,<br> But the dead king, and those that there had died.<br> Lo, in such way Medusa's head was tried!<br>    But when the living giant-folk were gone,<br> And with the dead men there he stood alone,<br> He turned him to the food that thereby lay,<br> And ate and drank with none to say him nay;<br> And on the floor at last he laid him down,<br> Midst heaps of unknown tawny skins and brown.<br>    There all the night in dreamless sleep he lay,<br> But rose again at the first streak of day,<br> And looking round about rejoiced to see<br> The uncouth image of his enemy,<br> Silent for ever, with wide mouth agape<br> Een as he died; and thought, 'Who now shall scape<br> When I am angry, while this gift I have?<br> How well my needy lovers I may save<br> While this dread thing still hangeth by my side!'<br>    Then out he passed: a plain burnt up, and wide,<br> He saw before him, bare of any trees,<br> And much he longed for the green dashing seas,<br> And merry winds of the sweet island shore,<br> Fain of the gull's cry, for the lion's roar. <a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 266</font></a><br>    Yet, glad at heart, he lifted up his feet<br> From the parched earth, and soon the air did beat,<br> Going north-east, and flew forth all the day,<br> And when the night fell still was on the way;<br> And many a sandy plain did he pass oer,<br> And many a dry much-trodden river shore,<br> Where thick the thirsty beasts stood in the night.<br> The stealthy leopard saw him with afright,<br> As whining from the thicket it crept out;<br> The lion drew back at his sudden shout<br> From off the carcass of some slaughtered beast;<br> And the thin jackals waiting for the feast<br> Stinted their hungry howls as he passed by;<br> And black men sleeping, as he came anigh<br> Dreamed ugly dreams, and reached their hands to seize<br> The spear or sword that lay across their knees.</p>  
 <p>   So at the last the sea before him lay,<br> And yet, therefore, he made not any stay,<br> But flew on till the night began to wane,<br> And the grey sea was blue and green again;<br> Until the sunlight on his wings shone fair,<br> And turned to red the gold locks of his hair.<br> Then in a little while he saw no land,<br> But all was heaving sea on every hand,<br> Driven this way and that way by the wind.<br>    Still fast he flew, thinking some coast to find,<br> And so, about the middle of the day,<br> Far to the east a land before him lay, <a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 267</font></a><br> And when unto it he was come anigh<br> He saw the sea beat on black cliffs and high,<br> With green grass growing on the tops of them,<br> Binding them round as gold a garment's hem.<br>    Then slowly alongside thereof he flew<br> If haply by some sign the land he knew,<br> Until a ness he reached, whereon there stood<br> A tower new-built of mighty beams of wood;<br> So nigh he came that, unseen, he could see<br> Pale haggard faces peering anxiously<br> From out its well-barred windows that looked forth<br> Into a bay that lay upon the north;<br> But inland over moveless waves of down<br> Shone the white walls of some great royal town.<br> Now underneath the scarped cliffs of the bay<br> From horn to horn a belt of sand there lay<br> Fast lessening as the flood-tide swallowed it,<br> There all about did the sea-swallows flit,<br> And from the black rocks yellow hawks flew down,<br> And cormorants fished amidst the sea-weed brown,<br> Or on the low rocks nigh unto the sea,<br> While over all the fresh wind merrily<br> Blew from the sea, and oer the pale blue sky<br> Thin clouds were stretched the way the wind went by,<br> And forward did the mighty waters press<br> As though they loved the green earth's stedfastness.<br> Nought slept, but everything was bright and fair<br> Beneath the bright sun and the noon-day air. <a name="page_268"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 268</font></a><br> Now hovering there, he seemed to hear a sound<br> Unlike the sea-bird's cry, and, looking round,<br> He saw a figure standing motionless<br> Beneath the cliff, midway twixt ness and ness,<br> And as the wind lulld heard that cry again,<br> That sounded like the wail of one in pain;<br> Wondering thereat, and seeking marvels new<br> He lighted down, and toward the place he drew,<br> And made invisible by Pallas aid,<br> He came within the scarped cliff's purple shade,<br> And found a woman standing lonely there,<br> Naked, except for tresses of her hair<br> That oer her white limbs by the breeze were wound,<br> And brazen chains her weary arms that bound<br> Unto the sea-beat overhanging rock,<br> As though her golden-crowned head to mock.<br> But nigh her feet upon the sand there lay<br> Rich raiment that had covered her that day,<br> Worthy to be the ransom of a king,<br> Unworthy round such loveliness to cling.</p>  
 <p>   Alas, alas! no bridal play this was,<br> The tremors that throughout her limbs did pass,<br> Her restless eyes, the catching of her breath,<br> Were but the work of the cold hand of death,<br> She waited for, midst untold miseries,<br> As, now with head cast back, and close-shut eyes<br> She wailed aloud, and now all spent with woe<br> Stared out across the rising sea, as though <a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 269</font></a><br> She deemed each minute brought the end anigh<br> For which in her despair she needs must cry.</p>  
 <p>   Then unseen Perseus stole anigh the maid,<br> And love upon his heart a soft hand laid,<br> And tender pity rent it for her pain,<br> Nor yet an eager cry could he refrain,<br> As now, transformed by that piteous sight,<br> Grown like unto a god for pride and might,<br> Down on the sand the mystic cap he east<br> And stood before her with flushed face at last,<br> And grey eyes glittering with his great desire<br> Beneath his hair, that like a harmless fire<br> Blown by the wind shone in her hopeless eyes.<br>    But she, all rigid with her first surprise,<br> Ceasing her wailing as she heard his cry,<br> Stared at him, dumb with fear and misery,<br> Shrunk closer yet unto the rocky place<br> And writhed her bound hands as to hide her face;<br> But sudden love his heart did so constrain,<br> With open mouth he strove to speak in vain<br> And from his heart the hot tears gan to rise;<br> But she midst fear beheld his kind grey eyes,<br> And then, as hope came glimmering through her dread,<br> In a weak voice he scarce could hear, she said,<br> "O Death! if thou hast risen from the sea,<br> Sent by the gods to end this misery,<br> I thank them that thou comest in this form,<br> Who rather thought to see a hideous worm <a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 270</font></a><br> Come trailing up the sands from out the deep,<br> Or suddenly swing over from the steep<br> To lap me in his folds, and bone by bone<br> Crush all my body: come then, with no moan,<br> Will I make ready now to leave the light.<br>    "But yetthy face is wonderful and bright;<br> Art thou a god? Ah, then be kind to me!<br> Is there no valley far off from the sea<br> Where I may live alone, afar from strife<br> Nor anger any god with my poor life?<br> Or do the gods delight in misery<br> And art thou come to mock me ere I die?<br> Alas, must they be pitiless, when they<br> Fear not the hopeless slayer of the day!<br> Speak, speak! what meanest thou by that sad smile?<br>    "O, if the gods could be but men awhile<br> And learn such fearful things unspeakable<br> As I have learned this morn, what man can tell<br> What golden age might wrap the world again<br> Ah, dost thou love me, is my speech not vain?<br> Did not my beauty perish on this morn<br> Dost thou not kiss me now for very scorn?<br> Alas, my shame, I cannot flee from thee!<br> Alas, my sin! no green-stemmed laurel tree<br> Shall mock thy grasp, no misty mountain stream<br> Shall wake thee shuddering from a lovely dream,<br> No helping god shall hear, but thou alone!<br> Help me, I faint! I see not! art thou gone?<br> Alas! thy lips were warm upon my brow, <a name="page_271"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 271</font></a><br> What good deed will it be to leave me now!<br>    "Oh, yet I feel thy kind and tender hand<br> On my chained wrist, and thou wilt find some land<br> Where I may live a little, free from fear?<br>    "And yet, and yet, if thou hast sought me here<br> Being but a man, no manly thing it is,<br> Nor hope thou from henceforth to live in bliss,<br> If here thou wrongest me, who am but dead."<br>    Then as she might she hung adown her head,<br> Her bosom heaved with sobs, and from her eyes<br> Long dried amidst those hopeless miseries<br> Unchecked the salt tears oer her bosom ran<br> As love and shame their varying strife began.<br>    But overwhelmed with pity, mad with love<br> Stammering, nigh weeping spoke the son of Jove,<br> "Alas, what land is this, where such as thou<br> Are thus tormented? look upon me now,<br> And cease thy fear! no evil man am I,<br> No cruel god to mock thy misery;<br> But the gods help me, and their unmoved will<br> Has sent me here to save thee from some ill,<br> I know not what; to give thee rest from this,<br> And unto me unutterable bliss,<br> If from a man thou takest not away<br> The gift thou gavest to a god to-day;<br> But I may be a very god to thee,<br> Because the gods are helpful unto me,<br> Nor would I fear them aught if thou wert nigh,<br> Since unto each it happeneth once to die. <a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 272</font></a><br>    "Speak not, sweet maid, till I have loosed thine hands<br> From out the grasp of these unworthy bands."<br>    So straight, and ere her lips could frame a word,<br> From out its sheath he drew the gleaming sword,<br> And while she shut her dazzled eyes for fear<br> To see the glittering marvel draw anear,<br> Unto her side her weary arms feel freed;<br> Then must she shrink away, for now indeed<br> With rest and hope and growing love there came<br> Remembrance of her helplessness and shame,<br> Weeping she said, "My fate is but to die,<br> Forget the wild words of my misery,<br> Take a poor maiden's thanks, and leave this place,<br> Nor for thy pity die before my face,<br> As verily thou wilt if thou stayst here;<br> Because, however free thou art from fear,<br> What hopest thou against this beast to do,<br> My death, and thine unconquerable foe?<br> When all a kingdom's strength has had no hope<br> With this strange horror, God-endowed, to cope,<br> But deemed it good to give up one poor maid<br> Unto his wrath, who makes the world afraid."<br>    "Nay," said he, "but thy fate shall be my fate,<br> And on these sands thy bane will I await,<br> Though I know nought of all his mightiness:<br> For scarcely yet a man, I none the less<br> Such things have done as make me now a name,<br> Nor can I live a loveless life of shame,<br> Or leave thee now, this day's most god-like gain, <a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 273</font></a><br> To suffer some unknown and mortal pain."</p>  
 <p>   She, hurrying as he spoke, with trembling hands<br> Had lifted up her raiment from the sands,<br> And yet therewith she was not well arrayed,<br> Before she turned round, ghastly white, and said,<br> "Look seaward and behold, my death draw nigh,<br> Not thinenot thinebut kiss me ere I die;<br> Alas! how many things I had to tell,<br> For certainly I should have loved thee well."<br>    He came to her and kissed her as she sank<br> Into his arms, and from the horror shrank,<br> Clinging to him, scarce knowing he was there;<br> But through the drifting wonder of her hair,<br> Amidst his pity, he beheld the sea,<br> And saw a huge wave rising mightily<br> Above the smaller breakers of the shore,<br> Which in its green breast for a minute bore<br> A nameless horror, that it cast aland,<br> And left, a huge mass on the oozing sand,<br> That scarcely seemed a living thing to be,<br> Until at last those twain it seemed to see,<br> And gathering up its strange limbs, towards them passed.<br> And therewithal a dismal trumpet-blast<br> Rang from the tower, and from the distant town<br> The wind in answer brought loud wails adown.<br>    Then Perseus gently put the maid from him,<br> Who sank down shivering in her every limb,<br> Silent despite herself for fear and woe, <a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 274</font></a><br> As down the beech he ran to meet the foe.<br>    But he, beholding Jove's son drawing near,<br> A great black fold against him did uprear,<br> Maned with grey tufts of hair, as some old tree<br> Hung round with moss, in lands where vapours be;<br> From his bare skull his red eyes glowed like flame,<br> And from his open mouth a sound there came,<br> Strident and hideous, that still louder grew<br> As that rare sight of one in arms he knew:<br> But godlike, fearless, burning with desire,<br> The adamant jaws and lidless eyes of fire<br> Did Perseus mock, and lightly leapt aside<br> As forward did the torture-chamber glide<br> Of his huge head, and ere the beast could turn,<br> One moment bright did blue-edged Herpe burn,<br> The next was quenched in the black flow of blood;<br> Then in confusèd folds the hero stood,<br> His bright face shadowed by the jaws of death,<br> His hair blown backward by the poisonous breath;<br> But all that passed, like lightning-lighted street<br> In the dark night, as the blue blade did meet<br> The wrinkled neck, and with no faltering stroke,<br> Like a god's hand the fell enchantment broke,<br> And then again in place of crash and roar,<br> He heard the shallow breakers on the shore,<br> And oer his head the sea-gull's plaintive cry,<br> Careless as gods for who might live or die.</p>  
 <p>   Then Perseus from the slimy loathsome coil <a name="page_275"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 275</font></a><br> Drew out his feet, and then with little toil<br> Smote off the head, the terror of the lands,<br> And, dragging it along, went up the sands,<br> Shouting aloud for joy, "Arise, arise,<br> O thou whose name I know not! Ope thine eyes<br> To see the gift, that I, first seen to-day,<br> Am hastening now before thy feet to lay!<br> Look up, look up! What shall thy sweet face be,<br> That I have seen amidst such misery,<br> When thou at last beginnest to rejoice."<br>    Slowly she rose, her burdened heart found voice<br> In sobs and murmurs inarticulate,<br> And clean forgetting all the sport of fate,<br> She scarce could think that she should ever die,<br> As locked in fearless, loving, strait embrace,<br> They made a heaven of that lone sandy place.<br>    Then on a rock smoothed by the washing sea<br> They sat, and eyed each other lovingly.<br> And few words at the first the maiden said,<br> So wrapped she was in all the goodlihead<br> Of her new life made doubly happy now:<br> For her alone the sea-breeze seemed to blow,<br> For her in music did the white surf fall,<br> For her alone the wheeling birds did call<br> Over the shallows, and the sky for her<br> Was set with white clouds, far away and clear;<br> Een as her love, this strong and lovely one<br> Who held her hand, was but for her alone.<br>    But after loving silence for a while, <a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 276</font></a><br> She, turning round to him her heavenly smile,<br> Said, "Tell me, O my love, what name is thine,<br> What mother brought thee forth so nigh divine,<br> Whence art thou come to take away my shame?"<br>    Then said he, "Fair love, Perseus is my name,<br> Not known of men, though that may come to be;<br> And her that bore me men call Danaë,<br> And tales of my begetting people tell<br> And call my father, Jove: but it befell<br> Unto my mother, when I first was born,<br> That she, cast out upon the sea, forlorn<br> Of help of men, unto Seriphos came;<br> And there she dwells as now, not gathering shame,<br> But called a Queen; and thence I come indeed,<br> Sent by the gods to help thee in thy need."<br>    Then he began and told her everything<br> Down to the slaying of the monstrous king,<br> She listening to him meanwhile, glad at heart<br> That he had played so fair and great a part.<br> But all being told, she said, "This salt pool nigh<br> Left by the tide, now mirrors well the sky,<br> So smooth it is, and now I stand anear<br> Canst thou not see my foolish visage clear,<br> Yea, een the little gems upon my hands?<br> May I not see this marvel of the lands<br> So mirrored, and yet livemake no delay<br> The sea is pouring fast into the bay,<br> And we must soon be gone."<br>                                  "Look down," he said, <a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 277</font></a><br> "And take good heed thou turnest not thine head."<br> Then gazing down, with shuddering dread and awe,<br> Over her imaged shoulder, soon she saw<br> The head rise up, so beautiful and dread,<br> That, white and ghastly, yet seemed scarcely dead<br> Beside the image of her own fair face,<br> As, daring not to move from off the place,<br> But trembling sore, she cried, "Enough, O love!<br> What man shall doubt thou art the son of Jove;<br> I think thou wilt not die:" then with her hand<br> She hid her eyes, and trembling did she stand<br> Until she felt his lips upon her cheek;<br> Then turning round, with anxious eyes and meek,<br> She gazed upon him, and some doubtful thought<br> Up to her brow the tender colour brought,<br> And sinking somewhat down her golden head,<br> Stammering a little now these words she said,<br>    "O godlike man, thou dost not ask my name,<br> Or why folk gave me up to death and shame;<br> Dost thou not dread I am some sorceress,<br> Whose evil deeds well earned me that distress?"<br>    "Tell me thy name," he said; "yet as for thee<br> I deem that thou wert bound beside the sea,<br> Because the gods would have the dearest thing<br> Thy land possessed for its own ransoming."<br>    She said, "O love, the sea is rising fast,<br> And time it is that we henceforth were past;<br> The only path that leadeth to the down<br> Is far, and thence a good way is the town; <a name="page_278"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 278</font></a><br> Come then, and on our journey will I tell<br> How all these things, now come to nought, befell."<br>    "Lead me," he said, and lifted from the sand<br> The monster's head; and therewith, hand in hand,<br> Together underneath the cliffs they went,<br> The while she told her tale to this intent.</p>  
 <p>   "This is the Syrian land, this town anigh<br> Is Joppa, and Andromeda am I,<br> Daughter of him who holds the sceptre there,<br> King Cepheus and Cassiope the fair.<br>    "She, smit by cruel madness, brought ill fate,<br> Upon the land to make it desolate;<br> For by the place whence thou deliveredst me,<br> An altar to the daughters of the sea<br> Erewhile there stood, and we in solemn wise,<br> Unto the maids were wont to sacrifice,<br> And give them gifts of honey, oil, and wine,<br> That we might have the love of folk divine;<br> And so it chanced that on a certain day,<br> When from that place the sea was ebbed away,<br> Upon the firm sands I and many a maid<br> About that altar went, while the flutes played<br> Such notes as sea-folk love; and as we went<br> Upon the wind rich incense-clouds we sent<br> About the hallowed stone, whereon there lay<br> Fruits of the earth for them to bear away;<br> Thus did we maids, as we were wont to do,<br> And watching us, as was their wont also, <a name="page_279"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 279</font></a><br> Our mothers stood, my own amidst the rest.<br>    "But ere the rites were done, as one possessed<br> She cried aloud, 'Alas, what do we now,<br> Such honour unto unseen folk to show!<br> To spend our goods, our labour, and our lives,<br> In serving these the careless sea-wind drives<br> Hither and thither through the booming seas;<br> While thou Andromeda art queen of these,<br> And in thy limbs such lovely godhead moves,<br> That thou shalt be new Mother of the Loves;<br> Thou shalt not die! Go child, and sit alone,<br> And take our homage on thy golden throne;<br> And I that bore thee will but be thy slave,<br> Nor shall another any worship have.'<br>    "Trembling awhile we stood with heads downcast,<br> To hear those words, then from the beach we passed.;<br> And sick at heart each went unto her home<br> Expecting when the fearful death should come,<br> Like those of Thebes, who, smit by arrows, fell<br> Before the feet of her who loved too well.<br>    "And yet stayed not my mother's madness there;<br> She caused men make a silver image fair<br> Of me unhappy, round the base she writ<br> '<i>Fairest of all</i>,' and bade men carry it,<br> With flowers and music, down unto the sea,<br> Who on the altar fixed it solidly<br> Against the beating of the winds and waves.<br>    "But we, expecting now no quiet graves,<br> Trembled at every murmur of the night, <a name="page_280"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 280</font></a><br> And if a cloud should hide the noon sun bright<br> Grew faint with terror; yet the days went by<br> Harmless above our great iniquity,<br> Until one wretched morn I woke to hear,<br> Down in the street loud wails and cries of fear,<br> And my heart died within me, nor durst I<br> Ask for the reason of that bitter cry,<br> Though soon I knew itnigh unto the sea<br> Were gathered folk for some festivity;<br> When, at the happiest moment of their feast,<br> Forth from the deep there came a fearful beast<br> No man could name, who quickly snatched away<br> Their fairest maid, and with small pain did slay<br> Such men as there in arms before him stood;<br> For unto him was steel as rotten wood,<br> And darts as strawnor grew the story old,<br> Day after day een such a tale was told.<br> Kiss me, my love! I grow afraid again;<br> Kiss me amid the memory of my pain.<br> Draw me to thee, that I thine arms may feel,<br> A better help than triple brass or steel!<br>    "Alas, love! folk began to look on me<br> With angry eyes, and mutter gloomily,<br> As pale and trembling through the streets I passed;<br> And from the heavy thunder-cloud, at last<br> The dreadful lightning quivered through the air:<br> For on a day the people filled the square<br> With arms and tumult, and my name I heard,<br> But heard no more; for, shuddering and afeard, <a name="page_281"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 281</font></a><br> Unto my far-off quiet bower I fled,<br> And from that moment deemed myself but dead.<br> How the time passed I know not, what they did<br> I know not now; for like a quail half hid,<br> When the hawk's pinions shade the sun from him,<br> Crouching adown, I felt my life wax dim.<br>    "The gods have made us mighty certainly<br> That we can bear such things and yet not die.<br> This mornAh, love, and was it yet this year,<br> Wherein thou camest to me, kind and dear?<br> This morn they brought me forth, they did on me<br> This mocking raiment bright with bravery;<br> They mocked my head with gold, with gems my feet,<br> My heart with lovely songs and music sweet.<br> Thou wouldst have wept to see me led along<br> Amidst that dreary pomp with flowers and song,<br> But if folk wept, how could I note it then;<br> Most vain to me were grown all ways of men.<br>    "They brought me to mine image on the sands,<br> They took it down, they bore it in their hands<br> To deck mine empty tomb, I think, and then<br> O cruel is the fearfulness of men,<br> Striving a little while to scape death's pain!<br> My naked body they spared not to chain,<br> Lest I should scape the death from which they fled,<br> Then left me there alone and shamedand dead<br> While to his home each went again, to live<br> Such vain forgetful life as fate might give. <a name="page_282"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 282</font></a><br>    "O love, to think that love can pass away,<br> That, soon or late, to us shall come a day<br> When this shall be forgotten! een this kiss<br> That makes us now forget the high God's bliss,<br> And sons of men with all their miseries."<br>    "Turn round," he said, "and let your well-loved eyes<br> Behold the sea from this high grassy hill,<br> And thou shalt see the risen waves now fill<br> The bay from horn to horn of it: no more<br> Thy footprints bless the shell-strewn sandy shore,<br> The vale the monster scooped as neath my sword<br> He writhed, the black stream that from out him poured,<br> The rock we sat on, and the pool wherein<br> Thou sawest the gods revenge for heedless sin<br> How the green ripples of the shallow sea<br> Cover the strife and passion peacefully,<br> Nor lack the hallowing of the low broad sun.<br>    "So has love stolen upon us, lovely one,<br> And quenched our old lives in this new delight,<br> And if thou needs must think of that dull night<br> That creepeth on no otherwise than this,<br> Yet for that thought hold closer to thy bliss,<br> Come nigher, come! forget the more thy pain."</p>  
 <p>   So there of all love's feasting were they fain,<br> Words fail to tell the joyance that they had,<br> And with what words they made each other glad.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 283</font></a></p>  
 <p>SO, as it drew to ending of the day,<br> Unto the city did they take their way,<br> And when they stood before its walls at last<br> They found the heavy gate thereof shut fast,<br> And no one on the walls for very shame;<br> Then to the wicket straightway Perseus came,<br> And down the monster's grinning head he threw,<br> While on the horn a mighty blast he blew,<br> But no one answered; then he cried aloud,<br> "Come forth, O warders, and no more shrink cowed<br> Behind your battlements! one man alone<br> Has dared to do what thousands have not done,<br> And the great beast besides the sea lies dead:<br> Come forth, come forth! and gaze upon this head!"<br>    Then opened was the door a little way,<br> And one peered forth and saw him with the may,<br> And turning round some joyous words he cried<br> Unto the rest, who oped the great gates wide,<br> And through them Perseus the saved maiden led.<br> Then as the folk cast eyes upon the head,<br> They stopped their shouts to gaze thereon with fear,<br> And timidly the women drew anear;<br> But soon, beholding Perseus godlike grace,<br> His mighty limbs, and flushed and happy face,<br> Cried out unto the maid, "O happy thou,<br> Who art well paid for every trouble now,<br> In winning such a godlike man as this." <a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 284</font></a><br> And many there were fain his skirts to kiss;<br> But he smiled down on them, and said, "Rejoice,<br> O girls, indeed, but yet lift heart and voice<br> Unto the gods to-day, and not to me!<br> For they it was who sent me to this sea.<br> And first of all fail not to bless the Maid<br> Through whom it came that I was not afraid."<br>    So through the streets they went, and quickly spread<br> News that the terror of the land was dead.<br> And folk thronged round to see the twain go by,<br> Or went before with flowers and minstrelsy,<br> Rejoicing for the slaying of their shame.</p>  
 <p>   Thus harbingerd the happy lovers came<br> Unto King Cepheus' royal house of gold.<br> To whom by this the joyful cries had told<br> That all was changed and still his days were good,<br> So, eager in his well-built porch he stood,<br> No longer now in mournful raiment clad.<br>    But when they met, then were those two more glad<br> Than words can say; there came her mother, too,<br> And round about her neck fair arms she threw,<br> Weeping for joy; and all about the King<br> The great men stood and eyed the fearful thing<br> That lay at Perseus feet: then the King said,<br> "O thou, who on this day hast saved my maid,<br> Wilt thou rule half my kingdom from to-day?<br> Or wilt thou carry half my wealth away?<br> Or in some temple shall we honour thee, <a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 285</font></a><br> Setting thine image up beside the sea?<br> Ask what thou wilt before these mighty lords,<br> And straightway is it thine without more words."<br>    Then in his heart laughed Perseus: and, "O King,"<br> He said, "I ask indeed a mighty thing;<br> Yet neither will I take thy wealth away,<br> Or make thee less a King than on this day,<br> And in no temple shall mine image stand<br> To look upon the sea that beats this land,<br> For fear the God who now is friend to me<br> Thereby should come to be mine enemy;<br> And yet on this day am I grown so bold,<br> I ask a greater gift than power or gold;<br> Give me thy maiden saved, to be my bride,<br> And let me go, because the world is wide,<br> And the gods hate me not, and I am fain<br> Some fertile land with these my hands to gain.<br> Nor think thereby that thou wilt get thee shame,<br> For if thou askest of my race and name,<br> Perseus I am, the son of Danaë,<br> Born nigh to Argos, by the sounding sea,<br> And those that know, call me the son of Jove,<br> Who in past days my mother's face did love."<br>    Then, glad at heart, the King said, "Poor indeed<br> Were such a gift, to give thee to thy meed<br> This that thine own unconquered hands have won.<br> O ye! bring now the head and cast thereon<br> Jewels and gold from out my treasury,<br> Till nothing of its grimness men can see; <a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 286</font></a><br> And let folk bring round to the harbour's mouth<br> My ship that saileth yearly to the south;<br> That to his own land since it is his will<br> This Prince may go; nor yet without his fill<br> Of that which all men long for everywhere,<br> Honour, and gold, and women kind and fair.<br> And ye, O lords, to-morrow ere midday,<br> Come hither to my house in great array,<br> For then this marriage will we solemnize,<br> Appeasing all the gods with gifts of price."<br>    Then loud all shouted, and the end of day<br> Being come, Andromeda was led away<br> Unto her bower, and there within a while<br> She fell asleep, and in her sleep did smile,<br> For on the calm of that forgetfulness<br> Her bliss some happy longings did impress.<br>    But in the Syrian King's adorned hall<br> Sat Perseus till the shadows gan to fall<br> Shorter beneath the moon, and still he thought<br> Amid the feast of what a day had brought<br> Unto his heart, a foolish void before,<br> And for the morrow must he long so sore<br> That all those joyances and minstrelsy<br> Seemed unto him but empty things to be.</p>  
 <p>   Early next morn the city was astir,<br> And country folk came in from far and near<br> Hearing the joyous tidings that the beast<br> Was dead, and fain to see the marriage feast, <a name="page_287"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 287</font></a><br> And joyous folk wandered from street to street<br> Crowned with fair flowers and singing carols sweet.<br>    Then to the maiden's chamber maidens came,<br> And woke her up to love and joyous shame,<br> And as the merry sun streamed through the room<br> Spread out unequalled marvels of the loom,<br> Stored up for such an end in days long done,<br> Ere yet her grey eyes looked upon the sun,<br> Fine webs like woven mist, wrought in the dawn,<br> Long ere the dew had left the sunniest lawn,<br> Gold cloth so wrought that nought of gold seemed there,<br> But rather sunlight over blossoms fair;<br> You would have said that gods had made them, bright,<br> To hide her body from the common light<br> Lest men should die from unfulfilled desire.<br>    Gems too they showed wrought by the hidden fire<br> That eats the world, and from the unquiet sea<br> Pearls worth the ransom of an argosy.<br>    Yet all too little all these riches seemed<br> In worship of her, who as one who dreamed,<br> By her fair maidens hands was there arrayed,<br> Then, with loose hair, ungirded as a maid<br> Unto the threshold of the house was brought,<br> But when her hand familiar fingers caught<br> And when that voice, that erst amidst her fear<br> She deemed a god's, now smote upon her ear<br> Like one new-born to heaven she seemed to be.<br>    But dreamlike was the long solemnity,<br> Unreal the joyous streets, where yesterday <a name="page_288"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 288</font></a><br> She passed half dead upon her wretched way;<br> And though before the flickering altar flame<br> She trembled when she thought of that past shame,<br> And midst the shouting knit her brows to think<br> Of what a cup these men had bidden her drink,<br> Unreal they seemed, forgotten as a tale<br> We cannot tell, though it may still avail<br> For pensive thoughts betwixt the day and night.<br>    All things unto the gods were done aright;<br> Beside the sea the flame and smoke uprose<br> Over rich gifts of many things to those<br> A woman's tongue had wounded; golden veils<br> And images, and bowls wrought oer with tales,<br> By all the altars of the gods were laid;<br> On this last day of maidenhood the maid<br> Had stood before the shrines, and there had thrown<br> Sweet incense on the flame, and through the town<br> The praises of immortals had been sung,<br> And sacred flowers about the houses hung;<br> And now the last hours of the dreamlike day<br> Amid great feasting slowly passed away.</p>  
 <p>   But in that land there was a mighty lord,<br> To whom erewhile the King had pledged his word<br> That he should wed Andromeda, and he<br> Heard through sure friends of this festivity<br> And raged thereat, and thought that eve to come<br> Unbidden to the feast and bear her home;<br> Phineus his name was, great amidst great men. <a name="page_289"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 289</font></a><br>    He setting out, came to the great hall when<br> The sun was well-nigh down, all armed was he,<br> And at his back came on tumultuously<br> His armed men-slaves, and folk that loved him dear.<br>    Beholding him, the King rose up in fear,<br> And all about the place scared folk uprose<br> As men surprised at feast by deadly foes;<br> But Perseus laughing said, "What feat do ye<br> This eve in honour of my sweet and me?<br> Or are ye but the servants of the King<br> Returned from doing for him some great thing<br> In a far land? then sit here and be glad,<br> For on this day the king feeds good and bad."<br>    Then inarticulate with rage and grief<br> Phineus turned on him, snatching at a sheaf<br> Of darts that hung against a pillar there,<br> And hurled one at him, that sung through his hair<br> And smote a serving man down by his side;<br> Then finding voice, he faced the King and cried,<br> "What dost thou drinking with this robber here,<br> Who comes to steal that which I hold so dear<br> That on my knees I prayed for her to thee?<br> Speak, Cepheus! wilt thou give her yet to me<br> And have good peace withal, or wilt thou die?<br> Ho, friends, and ye that follow, cry my cry!"</p>  
 <p>   Then straight the hall rang with a mighty shout<br> Of "Phineus," and from sheath and belt leapt out<br> The gleaming steel, and Cepheus stammering <a name="page_290"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 290</font></a><br> Took heart to say, "Think well upon this thing;<br> What should I do? the man did save her life,<br> And her he might have made his slave, as wife<br> He asks for now; take gifts and go thy way<br> Nor quench in blood the joyance of this day."<br>    Then forth stood Perseus with a frowning face<br> Before them all, and cried out from his place,<br> "Get ye behind my back, all friends to me!<br> And ere the lamps are lighted ye shall see<br> A stranger thing than ye have ever dreamed;"<br> And as he spake in his left hand there gleamed<br> The gold-wrought satchel; but amazed and cowed<br> Did the King's friends behind the hero crowd,<br> Who, ere from out the bag he drew the head,<br> Unto that band of fierce new-comers said;<br> "Will ye have life or death? if life, then go<br> And on the grass outside your armour throw,<br> And then returning, drink to my delight<br> Until the summer sun puts out the night."<br>    But loud they shouted, swaying to and fro,<br> And mocked at him, and cried aloud to know<br> If in his hand Jove's thunderbolt he had,<br> Or Mars' red sword that makes the eagles glad;<br> But Phineus, raging, cried, "Take him alive,<br> That we for many an hour the wretch may drive<br> With thongs and clubs until he longs to die!"<br>    Then all set on him with a mighty cry,<br> But, with a shout that thrilled high over theirs,<br> He drew the head out by the snaky hairs <a name="page_291"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 291</font></a><br> And turned on them the baleful glassy eyes;<br> Then sank to silence all that storm of cries<br> And clashing arms; the tossing points that shone<br> In the last sunbeams, went out one by one<br> As the sun left them, for each man there died,<br> Een as the shepherd on the bare hill-side,<br> Smitten amid the grinding of the storm;<br> When, while the hare lies flat in her wet form,<br> Een strong men quake for fear in houses strong,<br> And nigh the ground the lightning runs along.<br>    But upright on their feet the dead men stood,<br> In brow and cheek still flushed the angry blood;<br> This smiled, the mouth of that was open wide,<br> This other drew the great sword from his side,<br> All were at point to do this thing or that.</p>  
 <p>   As silent in the hall the living sat<br> As those dead men, till Perseus turned at last<br> And over all a kingly look he cast,<br> And said, "O friends, drink yet one cup to me,<br> And then to-morrow will I try the sea<br> With this my love; and, sweet Andromeda,<br> Forgive me that I needs must play this play;<br> Forget it, sweet! thou wilt not see again<br> This land of thine, upland, or hill, or plain;<br> There where we go shall all be new to thee<br> Except the love that thou hast won from me."<br> Then to her frightened face there came a smile,<br> And in her cheeks within a little while <a name="page_292"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 292</font></a><br> Sweet colour came again; but right few words<br> Upon that night were said of king or lords.</p>  
 <p>   But soon again the lovers were alone<br> Of all the sons of men remembering none,<br> Forgetting every god but him whose bow<br> About the vexed and flowery earth doth go.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>SO on the morn, when risen was the sun<br> About the capstan did the shipmen run,<br> Warping the great ship to the harbour mouth<br> That yearly went for treasures to the south,<br> And thither from the palace did men bear<br> Bales of rich cloth, and golden vessels rare,<br> And gold new coined, and silver bars of weight.<br> And women-slaves with bodies slim and straight<br> Stood on the snow-white deck, and strong men-slaves<br> Brought from some conquered land beyond the waves<br> Bore down rich burdens; so when all things due<br> Were laid on ship-board, and to noon it grew<br> Thither came Perseus with his new-wed wife,<br> And she, as losing somewhat of her life<br> Was pensive now, and silent, and regret<br> Must move her that her heart must soon forget<br> All folk and things where first her life began, <a name="page_293"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 293</font></a><br> Yea, een the mother, whose worn face and wan,<br> Tearless and haughty, yet looked oer the sea,<br> As though the life wherein no good could be<br> She still would hear in every god's despite<br> Ah, folk forget; the damsel's heart grew light<br> Een while her country's cliffs she yet could see.<br> Should she remember, when so lovingly<br> That cheek touched hers, and he was hers alone?</p>  
 <p>   Love while ye may; if twain grow into one<br> Tis for a little while; the time goes by,<br> No hatred twixt the pair of friends doth lie,<br> No troubles break their heartsand yet, and yet<br> How could it be? we strove not to forget;<br> Rather in vain to that old time we clung,<br> Its hopes and wishes round our hearts we hung,<br> We played old parts, we used old namesin vain,<br> We go our ways, and twain once more are twain;<br> Let passat latest when we come to die<br> Thus shall the fashion of the world go by.<br>    But these, while still at brightest love's flame burned,<br> Were glad indeed, as towards Seriphos turned<br> Bright shone their gilded prow against the sun.</p>  
 <p>   Meanwhile the folk of Joppa, one by one,<br> Took Phineus' people and their master dead<br> All turned to stone as they had seen the head,<br> And in a lonely place they set them down,<br> Upon a hill that overlooked the town, <a name="page_294"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 294</font></a><br> And round about them built a wall, four-square,<br> And at each corner raised a temple fair,<br> And therein altars made they unto Jove,<br> Pallas, and Neptune, and the God of Love;<br> And in Jove's temple carved that history,<br> That those who came there after them might see,<br> From first to last, how all these things were done,<br> And how these men last looked upon the sun.</p>  
 <p>   But the two lovers going on their way<br> Grew happier still, as bright day followed day;<br> And, the wind favouring, in a little while<br> They reached the low shore of the well-loved isle;<br> And, having beached the well-built keel, took land<br> Where Danae's boat first touched the yellow sand.<br> Then cityward alone did Perseus go<br> His fatal gift unto the King to show;<br> And, passing through the fair fields hastily,<br> Reached the green precinct, where he thought to see<br> His mother, he had left alive and well;<br> But from inside upon his ears there fell<br> A noise of shrieks and clashing arms and shouts;<br> Thereto he ran beset with many doubts,<br> Since Polydectes evil wiles he knew,<br> And what a fate he erst had doomed him to;<br> So, hurrying through, he reached the shrine at last,<br> And there beheld his mother, her arms cast<br> About Minerva's image, and by her<br> Good Dictys, who, with shield and glittering spear, <a name="page_295"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 295</font></a><br> Abode the onslaught of an armed band,<br> At head of whom did Polydectes stand.<br>    Then to her side sprang Perseus with a cry,<br> And at that sight and sound she joyfully<br> Said, "Comst thou, long desired? nought fear I now,<br> This kingly traitor soon shall lie alow."<br> Then the King tottered backward, and awhile<br> Stood staring at him: but an evil smile<br> Soon hid his fear, as, turning, he beheld<br> The glittering weapons that his stout slaves held,<br> And he cried out, "Yea, art thou back again?<br> And was my story forged for thee in vain?<br> Be merry then, but give me place or die!<br> I am not one to meet thee fearfully.<br> But thee, O brother, must I then slay thee,<br> And in our house must one more story be?<br> Give back! nor for a woman's foolishness,<br> Bring curses on the name thou shouldest bless.<br> Set on at once then! take the three of them!"<br>    Then once more clashed the spears, but on the hem<br> Of that dread satchel Perseus set his hand,<br> And put his friend aside, and took his stand<br> Betwixt his mother and the island men;<br> And terribly he cried, "Thus take thou then<br> The gift thou badst me bring to thee! nor ask<br> Of any man again another task,<br> Except to cast on thee a little sand<br> That thou mayst reach in peace the shadowy land."<br> His mocking speech he ended with a shout, <a name="page_296"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 296</font></a><br> And from the bag the dreadful head drew out,<br> And shook it in the King's bewildered face;<br> Who unto him yet strove to make one pace<br> With feebly brandished spear and drooping shield,<br> Then unto stony death his heart did yield,<br> And without any cry upright he died,<br> With fallen arms and fixed eyes staring wide.<br> But of his men the bravest turned and fled,<br> And on the ground some trembled, well-nigh dead<br> For very fear, till Perseus cried, "Arise,<br> Lay down your arms and go! Henceforth be wise;<br> Nor at kings biddings gainst the just gods strive."<br> But as they slunk away, too glad to live<br> To need more words, and shivering with their dread,<br> Once more did Perseus hide the fearful head,<br> And toward his mother turned; who, with pale face,<br> Stood trembling there, remembering that embrace<br> Within the brazen house; but now he threw<br> His arms about her as he used to do<br> When her own arms his little body bore;<br> And smiling, even as he smiled of yore,<br> He said, "O mother, fear me not at all,<br> But yet bethink thee of the brazen wall<br> And golden Jove, nor doubt from him I came;<br> And no more now shall I be called thy shame,<br> But thy defence and glory everywhere.</p>  
 <p>   "But now to lovely Argos let us fare,<br> Too small a land this is become for thee, <a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 297</font></a><br> And I may hope a greater sovereignty,<br> Who, by God's help, have done such mighty things,<br> Which I will tell thee of, while the wind sings<br> Amongst the shrouds of my rich-laden keel,<br> While by thy feet a god-given gift shall kneel,<br> My bride new won; in such-like guise will we<br> Come back to him who gave us to the sea,<br> And make our peace and all ill blood forget,<br> That through long happy years thou mayst live yet."<br>    Then did he take good Dictys by the hand,<br> And said, "O righteous man, we leave this land,<br> Nor leave thee giftless for the welcoming<br> Thou gavst us erst, nor for this other thing<br> That thou hast wrought for us this happy tide;<br> Therefore do thou as King herein abide,<br> And win Jove's love by helping in such wise<br> As thou didst us, folk sunk in miseries."<br>    So gave he kingdoms, as he took away,<br> For strong the God was in him on that day,<br> And the gods smiled to hear him; yea, and she<br> Who armed him erst, then dealt so lovingly,<br> She caused the people's hearts towards him to yearn,<br> Who, thronging round, began somehow to learn<br> The story of his deeds, and cried aloud,<br> "Be thou our King!" Then showed he to the crowd<br> Dictys his friend, and said, "Ito my kin<br> Must go, mine heritage and goods to win,<br> And a king, deal with kings; but yet see here<br> This royal man, my helpful friend and dear; <a name="page_298"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 298</font></a><br> Loved of the gods, surely he is of worth<br> For greater things." So saying he went forth<br> And mid their reverence, leading by the hand<br> His happy mother, turned unto the strand;<br> And still the wondering folk with them must go,<br> And now such honour unto him would show,<br> That rather they would make him God than King;<br> But while fresh carols round him these did sing<br> They came unto the low, sea-beaten sand;<br> And Danae took the Syrian by the hand<br> And kissed her, full of joy that such an one<br> Should bear brave children to her godlike son:<br> Then Perseus gave commands, and on the shore<br> Great gifts they laid from out his plenteous store,<br> To glad King Dictys eyes withal, and then<br> Bade farewell to him and his island men;<br> And all took ship, and hoisting sail straightway,<br> Departed oer the restless plain and grey.</p>  
 <p>   Now fair the wind was for a day and night,<br> But on the second day as it grew light,<br> And they were thinking that they soon should be<br> At Argos, rose a tempest on the sea,<br> And drave them from their course unto a land<br> Far north thereof. So on the yellow sand<br> They hauled their ship, and thereto presently<br> The good folk of the country drew anigh,<br> To make their market; and being asked, they said<br> That this was Thessaly, that strait paths led <a name="page_299"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 299</font></a><br> Through rugged mountains to a fertile plain<br> Peneus watered, rich with many a fane:<br> That following down the stream they soon should come<br> Unto a mighty people's glorious home,<br> A god-loved ancient city, called of men<br> Larissa, and the time was fitting then<br> To go thereto, and there should they have rest,<br> For now each corner was an honoured guest,<br> Because Teutamias, the Thessalian king,<br> His father dead with games was honouring.<br>    Then to that city Perseus fain would go,<br> His might unto the gathered men to show;<br> Desiring, too, to gather tidings there<br> Of how the old Acrisius yet might fare,<br> And if unto his scarce-seen Argive home<br> He in good peace might venture now to come.<br> So of the country folk he took fair steeds<br> And gave them gold, and goods for all their needs,<br> And with a trusty band with this intent<br> Through the rough passes of the hills he went,<br> Bearing his mother, and the Syrian may:<br> As of a king's men deemed of his array,<br> When to the fertile peopled fields he came;<br> But yet he bade that none should tell his name.<br> So coming to Larissa, all men thought,<br> That he who with him such great marvels brought<br> Was some great king, though scanty was his band;<br> So honour did he get on every hand.<br> But when the games began, and none could win <a name="page_300"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 300</font></a><br> A prize in any, if he played therein,<br> A greater name they gave him, saying, "What worth<br> In this poor age is left upon the earth<br> To do such deeds? Surely no man this is,<br> But some god weary of the heavenly bliss."<br>    At last, when all the other games were done,<br> Men fell to play at casting of the stone;<br> And strong men cast it, mighty of their hands,<br> Bearers of great names in the Grecian lands:<br> But Perseus stood and watched the play alone,<br> Nor did he move when every man had thrown.<br> Then cried Teutamias, "Nameless one! see now<br> How mightily these strong-armed heroes throw:<br> Canst thou prevail in this as in the rest?"<br>    "O King!" said Perseus, "now I think it best<br> To try the Fates no more; I must be gone:<br> Therefore to-day thou seest me thus alone,<br> For in the house my white-armed damsels stay<br> To order matters for our homeward way."<br>    "Nay, stranger," said the King, "but rather take<br> This golden garland for Teutamias sake,<br> And try one cast: look, here I have with me<br> A well-loved guest, who is most fain to see<br> Thy godlike strength, yea we will draw anigh<br> To watch the heavy stone like Jove's bolt fly<br> Forth from thine hand." Then Perseus smiled and said,<br> "Nay then, be wary, and guard well thine head.!<br> For who of mortals knoweth where and when<br> The bolts of Jove shall smite down foolish men?" <a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 301</font></a><br>    So said he, and withal the King drew nigh,<br> And with him an old man, who anxiously<br> Peered round him as if looking for a foe;<br> Then Perseus made him ready for the throw,<br> But even as he stooped the stone to raise,<br> The old man said, "That I the more may praise<br> This hero's cast, come to the other end<br> And we shall see the hill of granite send<br> The earth and stones up as its course is spent."<br> So then beyond the furthest cast they went<br> By some three yards, and stood aside; but now<br> Since it was evening and the sun was low<br> Its beams were in their eyes, nor could they see<br> If Perseus moved or not, then restlessly<br> Looking this way or that, the ancient man,<br> Gathering his garments up, in haste began<br> To cross the place, but when a warning shout<br> Rang in his ears, then wavering and in doubt<br> He stopped, and scarcely had he time to hear<br> A second cry of horror and of fear,<br> Ere crushed, and beaten down upon the ground,<br> The end of all his weary life he found.</p>  
 <p>   Then women shrieked, and strong men shouted out,<br> And Perseus ran to those that drew about<br> The slain old man, and asked them of his name,<br> But the King, eyeing him as nigh he came,<br> Said, "This we know, and thy hid name we know,<br> For certainly thou art his fated foe, <a name="page_302"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 302</font></a><br> His very daughter's strange-begotten son,<br> The child the sea cast up, the dreaded one.<br> This was Acrisius, who for fear of thee<br> Shut up thy mother by the sounding sea;<br> This was the man, who, for the very dread<br> Of meeting thee, from lovely Argos fled<br> To be my guest. Nay, let thy sharp sword bide<br> Within its sheath, the world is fair and wide,<br> Nor have we aught to do to thee for this;<br> Go then in peace, and live in woe or bliss<br> Een as thou mayst, but stay with us no more,<br> Because we fear the gods may plague us sore<br> For this thy deed, though they would have it so."</p>  
 <p>   Then soberly thenceforth did Perseus go<br> Unto his folk, and straightly told them all<br> That on that luckless day had chanced to fall;<br> Wondering thereat, there made they no delay<br> But down unto the sea they took their way;<br> And much did Danae ponder as they went<br> How the high gods had wrought out their intent,<br> And thinking on these things she needs must sigh<br> For pity of her sweet life passing by.<br>    But when they reached the border of the sea,<br> Then Perseus said, "Though all unwittingly<br> I slew this man, and though perchance of right<br> His throne is mine, yet never will I fight<br> Against the just gods, and I fear the stain<br> Of kindred blood, if slaying him I gain <a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 303</font></a><br> His kingdom and the city of my birth:<br> Now, therefore, since the gods have made the earth<br> Most fair in many places, let us go<br> Whereer the god-sent fated wind shall blow<br> The ship, that carries one the high gods love.<br> But first the armed lovely Maid of Jove<br> Here let us worship, on this yellow beach,<br> That her, my helper erst, we may beseech<br> To grant us much, and first of all things, this,<br> A land where we may dwell awhile in bliss."<br>    They heard him gladly, for the most of those<br> Were young, nor yet by mishaps and by foes<br> Had learned to think the world a dreary thing;<br> So round about the altar did they sing<br> And feasted well, and when the day came round<br> Once more, they went a-shipboard to the sound<br> Of trumpets and heart-moving melody,<br> And gave their rich keel to the restless sea.<br>    Then for four days before the wind they drove,<br> Until at last in sight a new land hove<br> Their pilot called the coast of Argolis,<br> That rich in cattle and in horses is.<br>    But landing there had Perseus godlike fame<br> Gone on before him, and the people came<br> And cried upon him for their king and lord,<br> The people's saving shield and conquering sword;<br> So in that land he failed not to abide,<br> And there with many rites he purified<br> His fated hands of that unlooked-for guilt: <a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 304</font></a><br> And there a town within a while he built<br> Men call Mycenæ. Peaceful grew the land<br> The while the ivory rod was in his hand,<br> For robbers fled, and good men still waxed strong,<br> And in no house was any sound of wrong,<br> Until the Golden Age seemed there to be,<br> So steeped the land was in felicity.</p>  
 <p>   Time past, and there his wife and mother died,<br> And he, no god, must lie down by their side,<br> While Alceus his first son reigned after him,<br> A conquering king, and fair, and strong of limb.</p>  
 <p>   But long ere this he did not fail to lay<br> The sacred things that brought him on his way<br> Within Minerva's temple; there with awe<br> Twixt silver bars, all folk these marvels saw,<br> But not for long, for on the twentieth day<br> From the fair temple were they snatched away<br> Though by the armed priests guarded faithfully.<br> But still the empty wallet there did lie<br> Wherein had Perseus borne the head with him,<br> Which still when his great deeds were waxing dim,<br> Hung in the Maiden's temple near the shrine,<br> And folk would pour before it oil and wine.</p>  
 <p>   And know besides, that from that very year<br> Those who are wise say that the Maid doth bear<br> Amidst her shield that awful snaky head<br> Whereby so many heedless ones are dead.</p>

 <p>BEFORE the last words of his tale were done<br> The purple hills had hidden half the sun,<br> But when the story's death a silence made<br> Within the hall, in freshness and in shade<br> The trembling blossoms of the garden lay.<br>    Few words at first the elder men could say,<br> For thinking how all stories end with this,<br> Whatever was the midway gain and bliss:<br> "He died, and in his place was set his son;<br> He died, and in a few days every one<br> Went on their way as though he had not been."<br>    Yet with the pictures that their eyes had seen,<br> As still from point to point that history past,<br> And round their thoughts its painted veil was cast,<br> Their hearts were softened,far away they saw<br> That other world, that neath another law<br> Had lived and died; when man might hope to see<br> Some earthly image of Divinity,<br> And yet not die, but, strengthened by the sight,<br> Cast fear away, and go from might to might,<br> Until to godlike life, though short, he came,<br> Amidst all losses winning hope of fame,<br> Nor losing joy the while his life should dure,<br> For that at least his valiant strife made sure,<br> That still in place of dreamy, youthful hope,<br> With slow decay and certain death could cope. <a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 306</font></a><br> So mused the Wanderers, and awhile might deem<br> That world might not be quite an empty dream,<br> But dim foreshadowings of what yet might come<br> When they perforce must leave that new-gained home;<br> Foreshadowings mingled with the images<br> Of man's misdeeds in greater days than these.</p>  
 <p>   With no harsh words their musing was undone,<br> The garden birds sang down the setting sun,<br> A rainy wind from twixt the trees arose,<br> And sang a mournful counterpoint to those;<br> And, ere the rain amidst the dark could fall,<br> The minstrel's song was ringing through the hall.</p>

 <p>WHEN April-tide was melting into May,<br> Within a hall that midst the gardens lay<br> These elders met, and having feasted well,<br> The time came round the wonted tale to tell.<br> Then spake a Wanderer: "Sirs, it happed to me,<br> Long years agone, to cross the narrow sea<br> That twixt us Drontheimers and England lies;<br> Young was I then, and little thought these eyes<br> Should see so many lands ere all was done.<br>    "But this land was a fair and fertile one,<br> As at that time, for April-tide it was,<br> Even as now; well, sirs, it came to pass<br> That to this town or that we took our way,<br> Or in some abbey's guesten-chamber lay,<br> And many tales we heard, some false, some true,<br> Of the ill deeds our fathers used to do<br> Within that land; and still the tale would end,<br> 'Yet did the Saint his Holy House defend;'<br> Or, 'Sirs, their fury all was nought and vain,<br> And by our Earl the pirate-king was slain.'<br> God wot, I laughed full often in my sleeve,<br> And could have told them stories, by their leave,<br> With other endings: but I held my tongue.<br> Let each king's deeds in his own land be sung,<br> And then will lies stretch far. Besides, these men<br> Were puffed up with their luck and glory then, <a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 308</font></a><br> For at that tide, within the land of France,<br> Unto their piping must all people dance.<br> But let that pass, for Captain Rolf has told<br> How, on the way, their king he did behold.</p>  
 <p>   "For other tales they told, and one of these<br> Not all the washing of the troublous seas,<br> Not all the changeful days whereof ye know,<br> Has swept from out my memory; even so<br> Small things far off will be remembered clear<br> When matters both more weighty, and more near,<br> Are waxing dim to us. I, who have seen<br> So many lands, and midst such marvels been,<br> Clearer than these abodes of outland men,<br> Can see above the green and unburnt fen<br> The little houses of an English town,<br> Cross-timbered, thatched with fen-reeds coarse and brown,<br> And high oer these, three gables, great and fair,<br> That slender rods of columns do upbear<br> Over the minster doors, and imagery<br> Of kings, and flowers no summer field doth see,<br> Wrought on those gables.Yea, I heard withal,<br> In the fresh morning air, the trowels fall<br> Upon the stone, a thin noise far away;<br> For high up wrought the masons on that day,<br> Since to the monks that house seemed scarcely well<br> Till they had set a spire or pinnacle<br> Each side the great porch. In that burgh I heard <a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 309</font></a><br> This tale, and late have set down every word<br> That I remembered, when the thoughts would come,<br> Of what we did in our deserted home,<br> And of the days, long past, when we were young,<br> Nor knew the cloudy woes that oer us hung.<br> And howsoever I am now grown old,<br> Yet is it still the tale I then heard told<br> Within the guest-house of that minster-close,<br> Whose walls, like cliffs new-made, before us rose."</p>
