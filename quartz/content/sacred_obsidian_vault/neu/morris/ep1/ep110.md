 <p><a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 310</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">THE PROUD KING.</h3>  <h4 align="center">ARGUMENT.</h4>  
 <p><font size="-1">A CERTAIN King, blinded by pride, thought that he was something more than man, if not equal to God; but such a judgment fell on him that none knew him for king, and he suffered many things, till in the end, humbling himself, he regained his kingdom and honour.</font></p>  
 <p>IN a far country that I cannot name,<br> And on a year long ages past away,<br> A King there dwelt, in rest and ease and fame,<br> And richer than the Emperor is to-day:<br> The very thought of what this man might say,<br> From dusk to dawn kept many a lord awake,<br> For fear of him did many a great man quake.</p>  
 <p>   Young was he when he first sat on the throne,<br> And he was wedded to a noble wife,<br> But at the daïs must he sit alone,<br> Nor durst a man speak to him for his life,<br> Except with leave: nought knew he change or strife,<br> But that the years passed silently away,<br> And in his black beard gathered specks of grey <a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 311</font></a></p>  
 <p>   Now so it chanced, upon a May morning,<br> Wakeful he lay when yet low was the sun,<br> Looking distraught at many a royal thing,<br> And counting up his titles one by one,<br> And thinking much of things that he had done;<br> For full of life he felt, and hale and strong,<br> And knew that none durst say-when he did wrong.</p>  
 <p>   For no man now could give him dread or doubt,<br> The land was neath his sceptre far and wide,<br> And at his beck would well-armed myriads shout.<br> Then swelled his vain, unthinking heart with pride,<br> Until at last he raised him up and cried,<br> "What need have I for temple or for priest,<br> Am I not God, whiles that I live at least."</p>  
 <p>   And yet withal that dead his fathers were,<br> He needs must think, that quick the years pass by;<br> But he, who seldom yet had seen death near<br> Or heard his name, said, "Still I may not die<br> Though underneath the earth my fathers lie;<br> My sire indeed was called a mighty king,<br> Yet in regard of mine, a little thing</p>  
 <p>   "His kingdom was; moreover his grandsire<br> To him was but a prince of narrow lands,<br> Whose father, though to things he did aspire<br> Beyond most men, a great knight of his hands,<br> Yet ruled some little town where now there stands <a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 312</font></a><br> The kennel of my dogs; then may not I<br> Rise higher yet, nor like poor wretches die?</p>  
 <p>   "Since up the ladder ever we have gone<br> Step after step nor fallen back again;<br> And there are tales of people who have won<br> A life enduring, without care or pain,<br> Or any man to make their wishes vain;<br> Perchance this prize unwitting now I hold;<br> For times change fast, the world is waxen old."</p>  
 <p>   So mid these thoughts once more he fell asleep,<br> And when he woke again, high was the sun,<br> Then quickly from his gold bed did he leap,<br> And of his former thoughts remembered none,<br> But said, "To-day through green woods will we run,<br> Nor shall to-day be worse than yesterday,<br> But better it may be, for game and play."</p>  
 <p>   So for the hunt was he apparelled,<br> And forth he rode with heart right well at ease;<br> And many a strong, deep-chested hound they led,<br> Over the dewy grass betwixt the trees,<br> And fair white horses fit for the white knees<br> Of Her the ancients fabled rides a-nights<br> Betwixt the setting and the rising lights.</p>  
 <p>   Now following up a mighty hart and swift<br> The King rode long upon that morning tide, <a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 313</font></a><br> And since his horse was worth a kingdom's gift,<br> It chanced him all his servants to outride,<br> Until unto a shaded river-side<br> He came alone at hottest of the sun,<br> When all the freshness of the day was done.</p>  
 <p>   Dismounting there, and seeing so far adown<br> The red-finned fishes oer the gravel play,<br> It seemed that moment worth his royal crown<br> To hide there from the burning of the day,<br> Wherefore he did off all his rich array,<br> And tied his horse unto a neighbouring tree,<br> And in the water sported leisurely.</p>  
 <p>   But when he was fulfilled of this delight<br> He gat him to the bank well satisfied,<br> And thought to do on him his raiment bright<br> And homeward to his royal house to ride;<br> But 'mazed and angry, looking far and wide<br> Nought saw he of his horse and rich attire,<br> And gainst the thief gan threaten vengeance dire.</p>  
 <p>   But little help his fury was to him,<br> So lustily he gan to shout and cry;<br> None answered, still the lazy chub did swim<br> By inches gainst the stream; away did fly<br> The small pied bird, but nathless stayed anigh,<br> And oer the stream still plied his fluttering trade,<br> Of such a helpless man not much afraid. <a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 314</font></a></p>  
 <p>   Weary of crying in that lonely place<br> He ceased at last, and thinking what to do,<br> Een as he was, up stream he set his face,<br> Since not far off a certain house he knew<br> Where dwelt his ranger, a lord leal and true,<br> Who many a bounty at his hands had had,<br> And now to do him ease would be right glad.</p>  
 <p>   Thither he hastened on, and as he went<br> The hot sun sorely burned his naked skin,<br> The whiles he thought, "When he to me has lent<br> Fine raiment, and at ease I sit within<br> His coolest chamber clad in linen thin,<br> And drinking wine, the best that he has got,<br> I shall forget this troublous day and hot."</p>  
 <p>   Now note, that while he thus was on his way,<br> And still his people for their master sought,<br> There met them one who in the King's array<br> Bestrode his very horse, and as they thought<br> Was none but he in good time to them brought,<br> Therefore they hailed him King, and so all rode<br> From out the forest to his fair abode.</p>  
 <p>   And there in royal guise he sat at meat,<br> Served, as his wont was, neath the canopy,<br> And there the hounds fawned round about his feet,<br> And there that city's elders did he see,<br> And with his lords took counsel what should be; <a name="page_315"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 315</font></a><br> And there at supper when the day waxed dim<br> The Queen within his chamber greeted him.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>LEAVE we him there; for to the ranger's gate<br> The other came, and on the horn he blew,<br> Till peered the wary porter through the grate<br> To see if he, perchance, the blower knew,<br> Before he should the wicket-gate undo;<br> But when he saw him standing there, he cried,<br> "What dost thou friend, to show us all thine hide?</p>  
 <p>   "We list not buy to-day or flesh or fell;<br> Go home and get thyself a shirt at least,<br> If thou wouldst aught, for saith our vicar well,<br> That God hath given clothes een to the beast."<br> Therewith he turned to go, but as he ceased<br> The King cried out, "Open, O foolish man!<br> I am thy lord and King, Jovinian;</p>  
 <p>   "Go now, and tell thy master I am here<br> Desiring food and clothes, and in this plight,<br> And then hereafter needst thou have no fear,<br> Because thou didst not know me at first sight."<br> "Yea, yea, I am but dreaming in the night,"<br> The carle said, "and I bid thee, friend, to dream,<br> Come through! here is no gate, it doth but seem." <a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 316</font></a></p>  
 <p>   With that his visage vanished from the grate;<br> But when the King now found himself alone,<br> He hurled himself against the mighty gate,<br> And beat upon it madly with a stone,<br> Half wondering midst his rage, how any one<br> Could live, if longed-for things he chanced to lack;<br> But midst all this, at last the gate flew back,</p>  
 <p>   And there the porter stood, brown-bill in hand,<br> And said, "Ah, fool, thou makest this ado,<br> Wishing before my lord's high seat to stand;<br> Thou shalt be gladder soon hereby to go,<br> Or surely nought of handy blows I know.<br> Come, willy nilly, thou shalt tell this tale<br> Unto my lord, if aught it may avail."</p>  
 <p>   With that his staff he handled, as if he<br> Would smite the King, and said, "Get on before!<br> St Mary! now thou goest full leisurely,<br> Who, erewhile, fain wouldst batter down the door.<br> See now, if ere this matter is passed oer,<br> I come to harm, yet thou shalt not escape,<br> Thy back is broad enow to pay thy jape."</p>  
 <p>   Half blind with rage the King before him passed,<br> But nought of all he doomed him to durst say,<br> Lest he from rest nigh won should yet be cast,<br> So with a swelling heart he took his way,<br> Thinking right soon his shame to cast away, <a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 317</font></a><br> And the carie followed still, ill satisfied<br> With such a wretched losel to abide.</p>  
 <p>   Fair was the ranger's house and new and white,<br> And by the King built scarce a year agone,<br> And carved about for this same lord's delight<br> With woodland stories deftly wrought in stone;<br> There oft the King was wont to come alone,<br> For much he loved this lord, who erst had been<br> A landless squire, a servant of the Queen.</p>  
 <p>   Now long a lord and clad in rich attire,<br> In his fair hall he sat before the wine<br> Watching the evening sun's yet burning fire,<br> Through the close branches of his pleasance shine,<br> In that mood when man thinks himself divine,<br> Remembering not whereto we all must come,<br> Not thinking aught but of his happy home.</p>  
 <p>   From just outside loud mocking merriment<br> He heard midst this; and therewithal a squire<br> Came hurrying up, his laughter scarcely spent,<br> Who said, "My lord, a man in such attire<br> As Adam's, ere he took the devil's hire,<br> Who saith that thou wilt know him for the King,<br> Up from the gate John Porter needs must bring.</p>  
 <p>   "He to the King is nothing like in aught<br> But that his beard he weareth in such guise <a name="page_318"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 318</font></a><br> As doth my lord: wilt thou that he be brought?<br> Perchance some treason neath his madness lies."<br> "Yea," saith the ranger, "that may well be wise,<br> But haste, for this eve am I well at ease,<br> Nor would be wearied with such folk as these."</p>  
 <p>   Then went the squire, and coming back again,<br> The porter and the naked King brought in,<br> Who thinking now that this should end his pain,<br> Forgat his fury and the porter's sin,<br> And said, "Thou wonderest how I came to win<br> This raiment, that kings long have ceased to wear,<br> Since Noah's flood has altered all the air?</p>  
 <p>   "Well, thou shalt know, but first I pray thee, Hugh,<br> Reach me that cloak that lieth on the board,<br> For certes, though thy folk are leal and true,<br> It seemeth that they deem a mighty lord<br> Is made by crown, and silken robe, and sword;<br> Lo, such are borel folk; but thou and I<br> Fail not to know the signs of majesty.</p>  
 <p>   "Thou risest not! thou lookest strange on me!<br> Ah, what is this? Who reigneth in my stead?<br> How long hast thou been plotting secretly?<br> Then slay me now, for if I be not dead<br> Armies will rise up when I nod my head.<br> Slay me!or cast thy treachery away,<br> And have anew my favour from this day." <a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 319</font></a></p>  
 <p>   "Why should I tell thee that thou neer wast king?<br> The ranger said, "Thou knowest not what I say;<br> Poor man, I pray God help thee in this thing,<br> And, ere thou diest send thee some good day;<br> Nor hence unholpen shalt thou go away.<br> Good fellows, this poor creature is but mad,<br> Take him, and in a coat let him be clad;</p>  
 <p>   "And give him meat and drink, and on this night<br> Beneath some roof of ours let him abide,<br> For some day God may set his folly right."<br> Then spread the King his arms abroad and cried,<br> "Woe to thy food, thy house, and thee betide,<br> Thou loathsome traitor! Get ye from the hall,<br> Lest smitten by God's hand this roof should fall;</p>  
 <p>   "Yea, if the world be but an idle dream,<br> And God deals nought with it, yet shall ye see<br> Red flame from out these careen windows stream.<br> I, I, will burn this vile place utterly,<br> And strewn with salt the poisonous earth shall be,<br> That such a wretch of such a man has made,<br> That so such Judases may grow afraid."</p>  
 <p>   Thus raving, those who held him he shook off<br> And rushed from out the hall, nigh mad indeed,<br> And gained the gate, not heeding blow or scoff,<br> Nor longer of his nakedness took heed, <a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 320</font></a><br> But ran, he knew not where, at headlong speed.<br> Till, when at last his strength was fully spent,<br> Worn out, he fell beneath a woody bent.</p>  
 <p>   But for the ranger, left alone in peace,<br> He bade his folk bring in the minstrelsy;<br> And thinking of his life, and fair increase<br> Of all his goods, a happy man was he,<br> And towards his master felt right lovingly,<br> And said, "This luckless madman will avail<br> When next I see the King for one more tale."</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>MEANWHILE the real King by the road-side lay,<br> Panting, confused, scarce knowing if he dreamed,<br> Until at last, when vanished was the day,<br> Through the dark night far off a bright light gleamed;<br> Which growing quickly, down the road there streamed<br> The glare of torches, held by men who ran<br> Before the litter of a mighty man.</p>  
 <p>   These mixed with soldiers soon the road did fill,<br> And on their harness could the King behold<br> The badge of one erst wont to do his will,<br> A counsellor, a gatherer-up of gold,<br> Who underneath his rule had now grown old: <a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 321</font></a><br> Then wrath and bitterness so filled his heart,<br> That from his wretched lair he needs must start;</p>  
 <p>   And oer the clatter shrilly did he cry,<br> "Well met, Duke Peter! ever art thou wise;<br> Surely thou wilt not let a day go by<br> Ere thou art good friends with mine enemies;<br> O fit to rule within a land of lies,<br> Go on thy journey, make thyself more meet<br> To sit in hell beneath the devil's feet!"</p>  
 <p>   But as he ceased a soldier drew anear,<br> And smote him flatling with his sheathed sword,<br> And said, "Speak louder, that my lord may hear,<br> And give thee wages for thy ribald word!<br> Come forth, for I must show thee to my lord,<br> For he may think thee more than mad indeed,<br> Who of men's ways hast taken wondrous heed."</p>  
 <p>   Now was the litter stayed midmost the road,<br> And round about, the torches in a ring<br> Were gathered, and their flickering light now glowed<br> In gold and gems and many a lordly thing,<br> And showed that face well known unto the King,<br> That, smiling yesterday, right humble words<br> Had spoken midst the concourse of the lords.</p>  
 <p>   But now he said, "Man, thou wert cursing me<br> If these folk heard aright; what wilt thou then, <a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 322</font></a><br> Deemst thou that I have done some wrong to thee,<br> Or hast thou scathe from any of my men?<br> In any case tell all thy tale again<br> When on the judgment-seat thou seest me sit,<br> And I will give no careless ear to it."</p>  
 <p>   "The night is dark, and in the summer wind<br> The torches flicker; canst thou see my face?<br> Bid them draw nigher yet, and call to mind<br> Who gave thee all thy riches and thy place<br> Well;if thou canst, deny me, with such grace<br> As by the fire-light Peter swore of old,<br> When in that Maundy-week the night was cold</p>  
 <p>   "Alas! canst thou not see I am the King?"<br> So spoke he, as their eyes met mid the blaze,<br> And the King saw the dread foreshadowing<br> Within the elder's proud and stony gaze,<br> Of what those lips, thin with the lapse of days,<br> Should utter now; nor better it befell;<br> "Friend, a strange story thou art pleased to tell;</p>  
 <p>   "Thy luck it is thou tellest it to me,<br> Who deem thee mad and let thee go thy way:<br> The King is not a man to pity thee,<br> Or on thy folly thy fool's tale to lay:<br> Poor fool! take this, and with the light of day<br> Buy food and raiment of some labouring clown,<br> And by my counsel keep thee from the town, <a name="page_323"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 323</font></a></p>  
 <p>   "For fear thy madness break out in some place<br> Where folk thy body to the judge must hale,<br> And then indeed wert thou in evil case<br> Press on, sirs! or the time will not avail."<br> There stood the King, with limbs that gan to fail,<br> Speechless, and holding in his trembling hand<br> A coin new stamped for people of the land;</p>  
 <p>   Thereon, with sceptre, crown, and royal robe,<br> The image of a King, himself, was wrought;<br> His jewelled feet upon a quartered globe,<br> As though by him all men were vain and nought.<br> One moment the red glare the silver caught,<br> As the lord ceased, the next his hurrying folk<br> The flaring circle round the litter broke.</p>  
 <p>   The next, their shadows barred a patch of light,<br> Fast vanishing, all else around was black;<br> And the poor wretch, left lonely with the night,<br> Muttered, "I wish the day would neer come back,<br> If all that once I had I now must lack:<br> Ah God! how long is it since I was King,<br> Nor lacked enough to wish for anything?"</p>  
 <p>   Then down the lonely road he wandered yet,<br> Following the vanished lights, he scarce knew why,<br> Till he began his sorrows to forget,<br> And, steeped in drowsiness, at last drew nigh<br> A grassy bank, where, worn with misery, <a name="page_324"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 324</font></a><br> He slept the dreamless sleep of weariness,<br> That many a time such wretches' eyes will bless.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>BUT at the dawn he woke, nor knew at first<br> What ugly chain of grief had brought him there,<br> Nor why he felt so wretched and accursed;<br> At last remembering, the fresh morning air,<br> The rising sun, and all things fresh and fair,<br> Yet caused some little hope in him to rise,<br> That end might come to these new miseries.</p>  
 <p>   So looking round about, he saw that he<br> To his own city gates was come anear;<br> Then he arose and going warily,<br> And hiding now and then for very fear<br> Of folk who bore their goods and country cheer,<br> Unto the city's market, at the last<br> Unto a stone's-throw of the gate he passed.</p>  
 <p>   But when he drew unto the very gate,<br> Into the throng of country-folk he came<br> Who for the opening of the door did wait,<br> Of whom some mocked, and some cried at him shame,<br> And some would know his country and his name;<br> But one into his waggon drew him up,<br> And gave him milk from out a beechen cup, <a name="page_325"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 325</font></a></p>  
 <p>   And asked him of his name and misery;<br> Then in his throat a swelling passion rose,<br> Which yet he swallowed down, and, "Friend," said he,<br> "Last night I had the hap to meet the foes<br> Of God and man, who robbed me, and with blows<br> Stripped off my weed and left me on the way:<br> Thomas the Pilgrim am I called to-day.</p>  
 <p>   "A merchant am I of another town,<br> And rich enow to pay thee for thy deed,<br> If at the King's door thou wilt set me down,<br> For there a squire I know, who at my need<br> Will give me food and drink, and fitting weed.<br> What is thy name? in what place dost thou live?<br> That I some day great gifts to thee may give."</p>  
 <p>   "Fair Sir," the carie said, "I am poor enow,<br> Though certes food I lack not easily;<br> My name is Christopher a-Green; I sow<br> A little orchard set with bush and tree,<br> And ever there the kind land keepeth me,<br> For I, now fifty, from a little boy<br> Have dwelt thereon, and known both grief and joy.</p>  
 <p>   "The house my grandsire built there has grown old,<br> And certainly a bounteous gift it were<br> If thou shouldst give me just enough of gold<br> To build it new; nor shouldst thou lack my prayer<br> For such a gift." "Nay, friend, have thou no care," <a name="page_326"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 326</font></a><br> The King said: "this is but a little thing<br> To me, who oft am richer than the King."</p>  
 <p>   Now as they talked the gate was opened wide,<br> And toward the palace went they through the street,<br> And Christopher walked ever by the side<br> Of his rough wain, where midst the May-flowers sweet<br> Jovinian lay, that folk whom they might meet<br> Might see him not to mock at his bare skin:<br> So shortly to the King's door did they win.</p>  
 <p>   Then through the open gate Jovinian ran<br> Of the first court, and no man stayed him there;<br> But as he reached the second gate, a man<br> Of the King's household, seeing him all bare<br> And bloody, cried out, "Whither dost thou fare?<br> Sure thou art seventy times more mad than mad,<br> Or else some magic potion thou hast had,</p>  
 <p>   "Whereby thou fearst not steel or anything."<br> "But," said the King, "good fellow, I know thee;<br> And can it be thou knowest not thy King?<br> Nay, thou shalt have a good reward of me,<br> That thou wouldst rather have than ten years' fee,<br> If thou wilt clothe me in fair weed again,<br> For now to see my council am I fain."</p>  
 <p>   "Out, ribald!" quoth the fellow: "What sayst thou?<br> Thou art my lord, whom God reward and bless? <a name="page_327"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 327</font></a><br> Truly before long shalt thou find out how<br> John Hangman cureth ill folk's wilfulness;<br> Yea, from his scourge the blood has run for less<br> Than that which now thou sayest: nay, what say I?<br> For lighter words have I seen tall men die.</p>  
 <p>   "Come now, the sergeants to this thing shall see!"<br> So to the guard-room was Jovinian brought,<br> Where his own soldiers mocked him bitterly,<br> And all his desperate words they heeded nought;<br> Until at last there came to him this thought,<br> That never from this misery should he win,<br> But, spite of all his struggles, die therein.</p>  
 <p>   And terrible it seemed, that everything<br> So utterly was changed since yesterday,<br> That these who were the soldiers of the King,<br> Ready to lie down in the common way<br> Before him, nor durst rest if he bade play,<br> Now stood and mocked him, knowing not the face<br> At whose command each man there had his place.</p>  
 <p>   "Ah, God!" said he, "is this another earth<br> From that whereon I stood two days ago?<br> Or else in sleep have I had second birth?<br> Or among mocking shadows do I go,<br> Unchanged myself of flesh and fell, although<br> My fair weed I have lost and royal gear?<br> And meanwhile all are changed that I meet here; <a name="page_328"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 328</font></a></p>  
 <p>   "And yet in heart and nowise outwardly."<br> Amid his wretched thoughts two sergeants came,<br> Who said, "Hold, sirs! because the King would see<br> The man who thus so rashly brings him shame,<br> By taking his high style and spotless name,<br> That never has been questioned ere to-day.<br> Come, fool! needs is it thou must go our way."</p>  
 <p>   So at the sight of him all men turned round,<br> As twixt these two across the courts he went,<br> With downcast head and hands together bound;<br> While from the windows maid and varlet leant,<br> And through the morning air fresh laughter sent;<br> Until unto the threshold they were come<br> Of the great hall within that kingly home.</p>  
 <p>   Therewith right fast Jovinian's heart must beat,<br> As now he thought, "Lo, here shall end the strife;<br> For either shall I sit on mine own seat,<br> Known unto all, soldier and lord and wife,<br> Or else is this the ending of my life,<br> And no man henceforth shall remember me,<br> And a vain name in records shall I be."</p>  
 <p>   Therewith he raised his head up, and beheld<br> One clad in gold set on his royal throne,<br> Gold-crowned, whose hand the ivory sceptre held;<br> And underneath him sat the Queen alone,<br> Ringed round with standing lords, of whom not one <a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 329</font></a><br> Did aught but utmost reverence unto him;<br> Then did Jovinian shake in every limb.</p>  
 <p>   Yet midst amaze and rage to him it seemed<br> This man was nowise like him in the face;<br> But with a marvellous glory his head gleamed,<br> As though an angel sat in that high place,<br> Where erst he sat like all his royal race,<br> But their eyes met, and with a stern, calm brow<br> The shining one cried out, "And where art thou?</p>  
 <p>   "Where art thou, robber of my majesty?"<br> "Was I not King," he said, "but yesterday?<br> And though to-day folk give my place to thee,<br> I am Jovinian; yes, though none gainsay,<br> If on these very stones thou shouldst me slay,<br> And though no friend be left for me to moan,<br> I am Jovinian still, and King alone."</p>  
 <p>   Then said that other, "O thou foolish man,<br> King was I yesterday, and long before,<br> Nor is my name aught but Jovinian,<br> Whom in this house the Queen my mother bore,<br> Unto my longing father, for right sore<br> Was I desired before I saw the light;<br> Thou, fool, art first to speak against my right.</p>  
 <p>   "And surely well thou meritest to die;<br> Yet ere that I bid lead thee unto death, <a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 330</font></a><br> Hearken to these my lords that stand anigh,<br> And what this faithful Queen beside me saith,<br> Then mayst thou many a year hence draw thy breath,<br> If these should stammer in their speech one whit:<br> Behold this face, lords, look ye well on it!</p>  
 <p>   "Thou, O fair Queen, say now whose face is this!"<br> Then cried they, "Hail O Lord Jovinian<br> Long mayst thou live!" and the Queen knelt to kiss<br> His gold-shod feet, and through her face there ran<br> Sweet colour, as she said, "Thou art the man<br> By whose side I have lain for many a year,<br> Thou art my lord Jovinian lief and dear."</p>  
 <p>   Then said he, "O thou wretch, hear now and see!<br> What thing should hinder me to slay thee now?<br> And yet indeed, such mercy is in me,<br> If thou wilt kneel down humbly and avow<br> Thou art no King, but base-born, as I know<br> Thou art indeed, in mine house shalt thou live,<br> And as thy service is, so shalt thou thrive."</p>  
 <p>   But the unhappy King laughed bitterly,<br> The red blood rose to flush his visage wan<br> Where erst the grey of death began to be;<br> "Thou liest, "he said, "I am Jovinian,<br> Come of great Kings; nor am I such a man<br> As still to live when all delight is gone,<br> As thou mightst do, who sittest on my throne." <a name="page_331"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 331</font></a></p>  
 <p>   No answer made the other for a while,<br> But sat and gazed upon him steadfastly,<br> Until across his face there came a smile,<br> Where scorn seemed mingled with some great pity.<br> And then he said, "Nathless thou shalt not die,<br> But live on as thou mayst, a lowly man<br> Forgetting thou wast once Jovinian."</p>  
 <p>   Then wildly round the hall Jovinian gazed,<br> Turning about to many a well-known face,<br> But none of all his folk seemed grieved or mazed,<br> But stood unmoved, each in his wonted place;<br> There were the Lords, the Marshal with his mace,<br> The Chamberlain, the Captain of the Guard,<br> Grey-headed, with his wrinkled face and hard,</p>  
 <p>   That had peered down so many a lane of war;<br> There stood the grave ambassadors arow,<br> Come from half-conquered lands; without the bar<br> The foreign merchants gazed upon the show,<br> Willing new things of that great land to know;<br> Nor was there any doubt in any man<br> That the gold throne still held Jovinian.</p>  
 <p>   Yea, as the sergeants laid their hands on him,<br> The mighty hound that crouched before the throne,<br> Flew at him fain to tear him limb from limb,<br> Though in the woods, the brown bear's dying groan,<br> He and that beast had often heard alone. <a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 332</font></a><br> "Ah!" muttered he, "take thou thy wages too<br> Worship the risen sun as these men do."</p>  
 <p>   They thrust him out, and as he passed the door,<br> The murmur of the stately court he heard<br> Behind him, and soft footfalls on the floor,<br> And, though by this somewhat his skin was seared,<br> Hung back at the rough eager wind afeard;<br> But from the place they dragged him through the gate,<br> Wherethrough he oft had rid in royal state.</p>  
 <p>   Then down the streets they led him, where of old,<br> He, coming back from some well-finished war,<br> Had seen the line of flashing steel and gold<br> Wind upwards twixt the houses from the bar,<br> While clashed the bells from wreathed spires afar;<br> Now moaning, as they haled him on, he said,<br> "God and the world against one lonely head!"</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>BUT soon, the bar being past they loosed their hold,<br> And said "Thus saith by us our Lord the King,<br> Dwell now in peace, but yet be not so bold<br> To come again, or to thy lies to cling,<br> Lest unto thee there fall a worser thing;<br> And for ourselves we bid thee ever pray<br> For him who has been good to thee this day." <a name="page_333"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 333</font></a></p>  
 <p>   Therewith they turned away into the town,<br> And still he wandered on and knew not where,<br> Till, stumbling at the last, he fell adown,<br> And looking round beheld a brook right fair,<br> That ran in pools and shallows here and there,<br> And on the further side of it a wood,<br> Nigh which a lowly clay-built hovel stood.</p>  
 <p>   Gazing thereat, it came into his mind<br> A priest dwelt there, a hermit wise and old,<br> Whom he had ridden oftentimes to find,<br> In days when first the sceptre he did hold,<br> And unto whom his mind he oft had told,<br> And had good counsel from him, though indeed<br> A scanty crop had sprung from that good seed.</p>  
 <p>   Therefore he passed the brook with heavy cheer,<br> And toward the little house went speedily,<br> And at the door knocked, trembling with his fear,<br> Because he thought, "Will he remember me?<br> If not, within me must there surely be<br> Some devil who turns everything to ill,<br> And makes my wretched body do his will."</p>  
 <p>   So, while such doleful things as this he thought,<br> There came unto the door the holy man,<br> Who said, "Good friend, what tidings hast thou brought?"<br> "Father," he said, "knowest thou Jovinian? <a name="page_334"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 334</font></a><br> Knowst thou me not, made naked, poor, and wan?<br> Alas, O father! am I not the King,<br> The rightful lord of thee and everything?"</p>  
 <p>   "Nay, thou art mad to tell me such a tale!"<br> The hermit said; "if thou seekst soul's health here,<br> Right little will such words as this avail;<br> It were a better deed to shrive thee clear,<br> And take the pardon Christ has bought so dear,<br> Than to an ancient man such mocks to say<br> That would be fitter for a Christmas play."</p>  
 <p>   So to his hut he got him back again,<br> And fell the unhappy King upon his knees,<br> And unto God at last he did complain,<br> Saying, "Lord God, what bitter things are these?<br> What hast thou done, that every man that sees<br> This wretched body, of my death is fain?<br> O Lord God, give me back myself again!</p>  
 <p>   "Een if therewith I needs must die straightway.<br> Indeed I know that since upon the earth<br> I first did go, I ever day by day<br> Have grown the worse, who was of little worth<br> Een at the best time since my helpless birth.<br> And yet it pleased thee once to make me King,<br> Why hast thou made me now this wretched thing?</p>  
 <p>   "Why am I hated so of every one? <a name="page_335"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 335</font></a><br> Wilt thou not let me live my life again,<br> Forgetting all the deeds that I have done,<br> Forgetting my old name, and honours vain,<br> That I may cast away this lonely pain?<br> Yet if thou wilt not, help me in this strife,<br> That I may pass my little span of life,</p>  
 <p>   "Not made a monster by unhappiness.<br> What shall I say? thou madst me weak of will,<br> Thou wrappedst me in ease and carelessness,<br> And yet, as some folk say, thou lovest me still;<br> Look down, of folly I have had my fill,<br> And am but now as first thou madest me,<br> Weak, yielding clay to take impress of thee."</p>  
 <p>   So said he weeping, and but scarce had done,<br> When yet again came forth that hermit old,<br> And said, "Alas! my master and my son,<br> Is this a dream my wearied eyes behold?<br> What doleful wonder now shall I be told,<br> Of that ill world that I so long have left?<br> What thing thy glory from thee has bereft?"</p>  
 <p>   A strange surprise of joy therewith there came<br> To that worn heart; he said, "For some great sin<br> The Lord my God has brought me unto shame;<br> I am unknown of servants, wife, and kin,<br> Unknown of all the lords that stand within<br> My father's house; nor didst thou know me more <a name="page_336"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 336</font></a><br> When een just now I stood before thy door.</p>  
 <p>   "Now since thou knowst me, surely God is good,<br> And will not slay me, and good hope I have<br> Of help from Him that died upon the rood,<br> And is a mighty lord to slay and save:<br> So now again these blind men will I brave,<br> If thou wilt give me of thy poorest weed,<br> And some rough food, the which I sorely need;</p>  
 <p>   "Then of my sins thou straight shalt shrive me clean."<br> Then weeping said the holy man, "Dear lord,<br> What heap of woes upon thine head has been;<br> Enter, O King, take this rough gown and cord,<br> And scanty food, my hovel can afford;<br> And tell me everything thou hast to say;<br> And then the High God speed thee on thy way."</p>  
 <p>   So when in coarse serge raiment he was clad,<br> He told him all his pride had made him think;<br> And showed him of his life both good and bad;<br> And then being houselled, did he eat and drink,<br> While in the wise man's heart his words did sink,<br> For, "God be praised!" he thought, "I am no king,<br> Who scarcely shall do right in anything!</p>  
 <p>   Then he made ready for the King his ass,<br> And bade again, God speed him on the way, <a name="page_337"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 337</font></a><br> And down the road the King made haste to pass<br> As it was growing toward the end of day,<br> With sober joy for troubles passed away;<br> But trembling still, as onward he did ride,<br> Meeting few folk upon that even-tide.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>SO to the city gate being come at last,<br> He noted there two ancient warders stand,<br> Whereof one looked askance as he went past,<br> And whispered low behind his held-up hand<br> Unto his mate, "The King, who gave command<br> That if disguised he passed this gate to-day,<br> No reverence we should do him on the way."</p>  
 <p>   Thereat with joy, Jovinian smiled again,<br> And so passed onward quickly down the street;<br> And well nigh was he eased of all his pain<br> When he beheld the folk that he might meet<br> Gaze hard at him, as though they fain would greet<br> His well-known face, but durst not, knowing well<br> He would not any of his state should tell.</p>  
 <p>   Withal unto the palace being cone,<br> He lighted down thereby and entered,<br> And once again it seemed his royal home,<br> For folk again before him bowed the head; <a name="page_338"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 338</font></a><br> And to him came a Squire, who softly said,<br> "The Queen awaits thee, O my lord the King,<br> Within the little hall where minstrels sing,</p>  
 <p>   "Since there thou badst her meet thee on this night."<br> "Lead on then!" said the King, and in his heart<br> He said, "perfay all goeth more than right<br> And I am King again;" but with a start<br> He thought of him who played the kingly part<br> That morn, yet said, "if God will have it so<br> This man like all the rest my face will know."</p>  
 <p>   So in the Little Hall the Queen he found,<br> Asleep, as one a spell binds suddenly;<br> For her fair broidery lay upon the ground,<br> And in her lap her open hand did lie,<br> The silken-threaded needle close thereby;<br> And by her stood that image of the King<br> In rich apparel, crown and signet-ring.</p>  
 <p>   But when the King stepped forth with angry eye<br> And would have spoken, came a sudden light,<br> And changed was that other utterly;<br> For he was clad in robe of shining white,<br> Inwrought with flowers of unnamed colours bright,<br> Girt with a marvellous girdle, and whose hem<br> Fell to his naked feet and shone in them;</p>  
 <p>   And from his shoulders did two wings arise, <a name="page_339"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 339</font></a><br> That with the swaying of his body, played<br> This way and that; of strange and lovely dyes<br> Their feathers were, and wonderfully made:<br> And now he spoke, "O King, be not dismayed,<br> Or think my coming here so strange to be,<br> For oft ere this have I been close to thee.</p>  
 <p>   "And now thou knowest in how short a space<br> The God that made the world can unmake thee,<br> And though He alter in no whit thy face,<br> Can make all folk forget thee utterly,<br> That thou to-day a nameless wretch mayst be,<br> Who yesterday woke up without a peer,<br> The wide world's marvel and the people's fear.</p>  
 <p>   "Behold, thou oughtest to thank God for this,<br> That on the hither side of thy dark grave<br> Thou well hast learned how great a God He is,<br> Who from the heavens countless rebels drave,<br> Yet turns himself such folk as thee to save;<br> For many a man thinks nought at all of it,<br> Till in a darksome land he comes to sit,</p>  
 <p>   "Lamenting everything: so do not thou!<br> For inasmuch as thou thoughtst not to die<br> This thing may happen to thee even now,<br> Because the day unspeakable draws nigh,<br> When bathed in unknown flame all things shall lie;<br> And if thou art upon God's side that day,<br> Unslain, thine earthly part shall pass away. <a name="page_340"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 340</font></a></p>  
 <p>   "Or if thy body in the grave must rot,<br> Well mayst thou see how small a thing is this,<br> Whose pain of yesterday now hurts thee not,<br> Now thou hast come again to earthly bliss,<br> Though bitter-sweet thou knowest well this is,<br> And thou no coming day canst ever see<br> Ending of happiness where thou mayst be.</p>  
 <p>   "Now must I go, nor wilt thou see me more,<br> Until the day, when, unto thee at least,<br> This world is gone, and an unmeasured shore,<br> Where all is wonderful and changed, thou seest:<br> Therefore, farewell! at council and at feast<br> Thy nobles shalt thou meet as thou hast done,<br> Nor wilt thou more be strange to any one."</p>  
 <p>   So scarce had he done speaking, ere his wings<br> Within the doorway of the hall did gleam,<br> And then he vanished quite; and all these things<br> Unto Jovinian little more did seem<br> Than some distinct and well-remembered dream,<br> From which one wakes amidst a feverish night,<br> Taking the moonshine for the morning light.</p>  
 <p>   Silent he stood, not moving for a while,<br> Pondering oer all these wondrous things, until<br> The Queen arose from sleep, and with a smile,<br> Said, "O fair lord, your great men by your will<br> Een as I speak the banquet-chamber fill, <a name="page_341"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 341</font></a><br> To greet thee amidst joy and revelling,<br> Wilt thou not therefore meet them as a King?"</p>  
 <p>   So from that place of marvels having gone,<br> Half mazed, he soon was clad in rich array,<br> And sat thereafter on his kingly throne,<br> As though no other had sat there that day;<br> Nor did a soul of all his household say<br> A word about the man, who on that morn<br> Had stood there, naked, helpless, and forlorn.</p>  
 <p>   But ever day by day the thought of it<br> Within Jovinian's heart the clearer grew,<br> As oer his head the ceaseless time did flit,<br> And everything still towards its ending drew,<br> New things becoming old, and old things new;<br> Till, when a moment of eternity<br> Had passed, grey-headed did Jovinian lie</p>  
 <p>   One sweet May morning, wakeful in his bed;<br> And thought, "That day is thirty years a-gone<br> Since useless folly came into my head,<br> Whereby, before the steps of mine own throne,<br> I stood in helpless agony alone,<br> And of the wondrous things that there befell,<br> When I am gone there will be none to tell:</p>  
 <p>   "No man is now alive who doubts that he,<br> Who bade thrust out the madman on that tide, <a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 342</font></a><br> Was other than the King they used to see:<br> Long years have passed now, since the hermit died,<br> So must I tell the tale, ere by his side<br> I lie, lest it be unrecorded quite,<br> Like a forgotten dream in morning light.</p>  
 <p>   "Yea, lest I die ere night come, this same day<br> Unto some scribe will I tell everything,<br> That it may lie when I am gone away,<br> Stored up within the archives of the King;<br> And may God grant the words thereof may ring<br> Like His own voice in the next corner's ears!<br> Whereby his folk shall shed the fewer tears."</p>  
 <p>   So it was done, and at the King's command<br> A clerk that day did note it every whit,<br> And after by a man of skilful hand<br> In golden letters fairly was it writ;<br> Yet little heed the new King took of it<br> That filled the throne when King Jovinian died,<br> So much did all things feed his swelling pride.</p>  
 <p>   But whether God chastised him in his turn,<br> And he grew wise thereafter, I know not;<br> I think by eld alone he came to learn<br> How lowly on some day must be his lot.<br> But ye, O Kings, think all that ye have got<br> To be but gawds cast out upon some heap,<br> And stolen the while the Master was asleep.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><a name="page_343"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 343</font></a></p>  
 <p>THE story done, for want of happier things,<br> Some men must even fall to talk of kings;<br> Some trouble of a far-off Grecian isle,<br> Some hard Sicilian craftsman's cruel guile<br> Whereby he raised himself to be as God,<br> Till good men slew him; the fell Persian rod<br> As blighting as the deadly pestilence,<br> The brazen net of armed men from whence<br> Was no escape; The fir-built Norway hall<br> Filled with the bonders waiting for the fall<br> Of the great roof whereto the torch is set;<br> The laughing mouth, beneath the eyes still wet<br> With more than sea-spray, as the well-loved land<br> The freeman still looks back on, while his hand<br> Clutches the tiller, and the eastern breeze<br> Grows fresh and fresher: many things like these<br> They talked about, till they seemed young again,<br> Remembering what a glory and a gain<br> Their fathers deemed the death of kings to be.<br>    And yet amidst it, some smiled doubtfully<br> For thinking how few men escape the yoke,<br> From this or that man's hand, and how most folk<br> Must needs be kings and slaves the while they live,<br> And take from this man, and to that man give<br> Things hard enow. Yet as they mused, again<br> The minstrels raised some high heroic strain<br> That led men on to battle in old times;<br> And midst the glory of its mingling rhymes,<br> Their hard hearts softened, and strange thoughts arose<br> Of some new end to all life's cruel foes.</p>
