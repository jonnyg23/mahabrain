 <p align="center">CHAPTER III.</p>  
 <p align="center">OF THE KING OF MEADHAM AND HIS DAUGHTER.</p>  
 <p>Tells the tale that in the country which lay south of Oakenrealm, and was called Meadham, there was in these days a king whose wife was dead, but had left him a fair daughter, who was born some four years after King Christopher.  A good man was this King Roland, mild, bounteous, and no regarder of persons in his justice; and well-beloved he was of his folk:  yet could not their love keep him alive; for, whenas his daughter was of the age of twelve years, he sickened unto death; and so, when he knew that his end drew near, he sent for the wisest of his wise men, and they came unto him sorrowing in the High House of his chiefest city, which hight Meadhamstead.  So he bade them sit down nigh unto his bed, and took up the word and spake:</p>  
 <p>"Masters, and my good lords, ye may see clearly that a sundering is at hand, and that I must needs make a long journey, whence I shall come back never; now I would, and am verily of duty bound thereto, that I leave behind me some good order in the land. Furthermore, I would that my daughter, when she is of age thereto, should be Queen in Meadham, and rule the land; neither will it be many years before she shall be of ripe age for ruling, if ever she may be; and I deem not that there shall be any lack in her, whereas her mother could all courtesy, and was as wise as a woman may be.  But how say ye, my masters?"</p>  
 <p>So they all with one consent said Yea, and they would ask for no better king than their lady his daughter.  Then said the King:</p>  
 <p>"Hearken carefully, for my time is short:  Yet is she young and a maiden, though she be wise.  Now therefore do I need some man well looked to of the folk, who shall rule the land in her name till she be of eighteen winters, and who shall be her good friend and counsellor into all wisdom thereafter.  Which of you, my masters, is meet for this matter?"</p>  
 <p>Then they all looked one on the other, and spake not.  And the King said:  "Speak, some one of you, without fear; this is no time for tarrying."</p>  
 <p>Thereon spake an elder, the oldest of them, and said: "Lord, this is the very truth, that none of us here present are meet for this office:  whereas, among other matters, we be all unmeet for battle; some of us have never been warriors, and other some are past the age for leading an host.  To say the sooth, King, there is but one man in Meadham who may do what thou wilt, and not fail; both for his wisdom, and his might afield, and the account which is had of him amongst the people; and that man is Earl Geoffrey, of the Southern Marches."</p>  
 <p>"Ye say sooth," quoth the King; "but is he down in the South, or nigher to hand?"</p>  
 <p>Said the elder:  "He is as now in Meadhamstead, and may be in this chamber in scant half an hour."  So the King bade send for him, and there was silence in the chamber till he came in, clad in a scarlet kirtle and a white cloak, and with his sword by his side.  He was a tall man, bigly made; somewhat pale of face, black and curly of hair; blue-eyed, thin-lipped, and hook-nosed as an eagle; a man warrior-like, and somewhat fierce of aspect.  He knelt down by the King's bedside, and asked him in a sorrowful voice what he would, and the King said:  "I ask a great matter of thee, and all these my wise men, and I myself, withal, deem that thou canst do it, and thou alone--nay, hearken:  I am departing, and I would have thee hold my place, and do unto my people even what I would do if I myself were living; and to my daughter as nigh to that as may be.  I say all this thou mayst do, if thou wilt be as trusty and leal to me after I am dead, as thou hast seemed to all men's eyes to have been while I was living.  What sayest thou?"</p>  
 <p>The Earl had hidden his face in the coverlet of the bed while the King was speaking; but now he lifted up his face, weeping, and said:  "Kinsman and friend and King; this is nought hard to do; but if it were, yet would I do it."</p>  
 <p>"It is well," said the King:  "my heart fails me and my voice; so give heed, and set thine ear close to my mouth: hearken, belike my daughter Goldilind shall be one of the fairest of women; I bid thee wed her to the fairest of men and the strongest, and to none other."</p>  
 <p>Thereat his voice failed him indeed, and he lay still; but he died not, till presently the priest came to him, and, as he might, houselled him:  then he departed.</p>  
 <p>As for Earl Geoffrey, when the King was buried, and the homages done to the maiden Goldilind, he did no worse than those wise men deemed of him, but bestirred him, and looked full sagely into all the matters of the kingdom, and did so well therein that all men praised his rule perforce, whether they loved him or not; and sooth to say he was not much beloved.</p>
