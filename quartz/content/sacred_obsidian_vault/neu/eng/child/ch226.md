 226A.1	 * * * * *
 	 OUT it spake Lizee Linzee,
 	 The tear blinket in her ee;
 	 How can I leave father and mother,
 	 Along with young Donald to gae!
 226A.2	 Out spoke Lizees young handmaid,
 	 A bonny young lassie was she;
 	 Said, Were I heress to a kingdom,
 	 Along with young Donald Id ga.
 226A.3	 O say ye so to me, Nelly?
 	 O say ye so to me?
 	 Must I leave Edinburgh city,
 	 To the high Highland to gae?
 226A.4	 Out spoke Lizies own mother,
 	 A good old lady was she;
 	 If you speak such a word to my dochter,
 	 Ill gar hang [you] hi.
 226A.5	 Keep well your dochter from me, madam,
 	 Keep well your dochter fa me;
 	 For I care as little for your dochter
 	 As ye can care for me.
 226A.6	 The road grew wetty and dubby,
 	 And Lizee began to think lang;
 	 Said, I wish had staid with my mother,
 	 And nae wi young Donald had gane.
 226A.7	 Your welcome hame, Sir Donald,
 	 Your thrice welcome to me;
 	 Your welcome hame, Sir Donald,
 	 And your young lady you wi.
 226A.8	 . . . .
 	 . . . .
 	 Ye call na me Sir Donald,
 	 But ca me Donald your son.
 226A.9	 Rise up, Lizee Linzee,
 	 You [have] lain too long in the day;
 	 Ye might have helped my mother
 	 To milch her goats and her kie.
 226A.10	 Out it spake Lizee Linzee,
 	 The tear blinket in her eye;
 	 The ladys of Edinburgh city,
 	 They neither milch goats nor kie.

 226B.1	 ITRRrrS of a young lord o the Hielands,
 	 A bonnie braw castle had he,
 	 And he says to his lady mither,
 RRMrry	 boon ye will grant to me:
 	 Sall I gae to Edinbruch city,
 	 And fesh hame a lady wi me?
 226B.2	 Ye may gae to Edinbruch city,
 	 And fesh hame a lady wi thee,
 	 But see that ye bring her but flattrie,
 	 And court her in grit povertie.
 226B.3	 My coat, mither, sall be o the plaiden,
 	 A tartan kilt oure my knee,
 	 Wi hosens and brogues and the bonnet;
 	 Ill court her wi nar flattrie.
 226B.4	 Whan he cam to Edinbruch city,
 	 He playd at the ring and the ba,
 	 And saw monie a bonnie young ladie,
 	 But Lizie Lindsay was first o them a.
 226B.5	 Syne, dressd in his Hieland grey plaiden,
 	 His bonnet abune his ee-bree,
 	 He called on fair Lizie Lindsay;
 	 Says, Lizie, will ye fancy me?
 226B.6	 And gae to the Hielands, my lassie,
 	 And gae, gae wi me?
 	 O gae to the Hielands, Lizie Lindsay,
 	 Ill feed you on curds and green whey.
 226B.7	 And yese get a bed o green bracken,
 	 My plaidie will hap thee and me;
 	 Yese lie in my arms, bonnie Lizie,
 	 If yell gae to the Hielands wi me.
 226B.8	 O how can I gae to the Hielands,
 	 Or how can I gae wi thee,
 	 Whan I dinna ken whare Im gaing,
 	 Nor wha I hae to gae wi?
 226B.9	 My father, he is an auld shepherd,
 	 My mither, she is an auld dey;
 	 My name it is Donald Macdonald,
 	 My name Ill never deny.
 226B.10	 O Donald, Ill gie ye five guineas
 	 To sit ae hour in my room,
 	 Till I tak aff your ruddy picture;
 	 Whan I hae t, Ill never think lang.
 226B.11	 I dinna care for your five guineas;
 	 Its ye thats the jewel to me;
 	 Ive plenty o kye in the Hielands,
 	 To feed ye wi curds and green whey.
 226B.12	 And yese get a bonnie blue plaidie,
 	 Wi red and green strips thro it a;
 	 And Ill be the lord o your dwalling,
 	 And thats the best picture ava.
 226B.13	 And I am laird o a my possessions;
 	 The king canna boast o na mair;
 	 And yese hae my true heart in keeping,
 	 Therell be na ither een hae a share.
 226B.14	 Sae gae to the Hielands, my lassie,
 	 O gae awa happy wi me;
 	 O gae to the Hielands, Lizie Lindsay,
 	 And hird the wee lammies wi me.
 226B.15	 O how can I gae wi a stranger,
 	 Oure hills and oure glens frae my hame?
 	 I tell ye I am Donald Macdonald;
 	 Ill ever be proud o my name.
 226B.16	 Doun cam Lizie Lindsays ain father,
 	 A knicht o a noble degree;
 	 Says, If ye do steal my dear daughter,
 	 Its hangit ye quickly sall be.
 226B.17	 On his heel he turned round wi a bouncie,
 	 And a licht lauch he did gie:
 	 Theres nae law in Edinbruch city
 	 This day that can dare to hang me.
 226B.18	 Then up bespak Lizies best woman,
 	 And a bonnie young lass was she;
 	 Had I but a mark in my pouchie,
 	 Its Donald that I wad gae wi.
 226B.19	 O Helen, wad ye leave your coffer,
 	 And a your silk kirtles sae braw,
 	 And gang wi a bare-houghd puir laddie,
 	 And leave father, mither, and a?
 226B.20	 But I think hes a witch or a warlock,
 	 Or something o that fell degree,
 	 For Ill gae awa wi young Donald,
 	 Whatever my fortune may be.
 226B.21	 Then Lizie laid doun her silk mantle,
 	 And put on her waiting-maids goun,
 	 And aff and awa to the Hielands
 	 Shes gane wi this young shepherd loun.
 226B.22	 Thro glens and oure mountains they wanderd,
 	 Till Lizie had scantlie a shoe;
 	 Alas and ohone! says fair Lizie,
 	 Sad was the first day I saw you!
 	 I wish I war in Edinbruch city;
 	 Fu sair, sair this pastime I rue.
 226B.23	 O haud your tongue now, bonnie Lizie,
 	 For yonders the shieling, my hame;
 	 And theres my guid auld honest mither,
 	 Thats coming to meet ye her lane.
 226B.24	 O yere welcome, yere welcome, Sir Donald,
 	 Yere welcome hame to your ain.
 	 O ca me na young Sir Donald,
 	 But ca me Donald my son;
 	 And this they hae spoken in Erse,
 	 That Lizie micht not understand.
 226B.25	 The day being weetie and daggie,
 	 They lay till twas lang o the day:
 	 Win up, win up, bonnie Lizie,
 	 And help at the milking the kye.
 226B.26	 O slowly raise up Lizie Lindsay,
 	 The saut tear blindit her ee:
 	 O, war I in Edinbruch city,
 	 The Hielands shoud never see me!
 226B.27	 He led her up to a hie mountain
 	 And bade her look out far and wide:
 	 Im lord o thae isles and thae mountains,
 	 And yere now my beautiful bride.
 226B.28	 Sae rue na yeve come to the Hielands,
 	 Sae rue na yeve come aff wi me,
 	 For yere great Macdonalds braw lady,
 	 And will be to the day that ye dee.

 226C.1	 WHAT wad ye gie to me, mither,
 	 What wad ye gie to me,
 	 If I wad go to Edinbruch city
 	 And bring hame Lizie Lindsey to thee?
 226C.2	 Meikle wad I gie to thee, Donald,
 	 Meikle wad I gie to thee,
 	 If ye wad gang to Edinbruch city
 	 And court her as in povertie.
 226C.3	 Whan he cam to Edinbruch city,
 	 And there a while to resort,
 	 He called on fair Lizie Lindsey,
 	 Wha lived at the Canongate-Port.
 226C.4	 Will ye gang to the Hielands, Lizie Lindsey?
 	 Will ye gae to the Hielands wi me?
 	 And I will gie ye a cup o the curds,
 	 Likewise a cup of green whey.
 226C.5	 And I will gie ye a bed o green threshes,
 	 Likewise a happing o grey,
 	 If ye will gae to the Hielands, Lizie Lindsey,
 	 If yell gae to the Hielands wi me.
 226C.6	 How can I gang? says Lizie Lindsey,
 	 How can I gang wi thee?
 	 I dinna ken whare I am gaing,
 	 Nor wha I am gaing wi.
 226C.7	 My father is a cowper o cattle,
 	 My mither is an auld dey;
 	 My name is Donald Macdonald,
 	 My name Ill never deny.
 226C.8	 Doun cam Lizie Lindseys father,
 	 A revrend auld gentleman was he:
 	 If ye steal awa my dochter,
 	 Hie hanged ye sall be.
 226C.9	 He turned him round on his heel
 	 And [a] licht lauch gied he;
 	 There is na law in a Edinbruch city
 	 This day that can hang me.
 226C.10	 Its doun cam Lizies hand-maid,
 	 A bonnie young lass was she:
 	 If I had ae crown in a the warld,
 	 Awa wi that fellow Id gae.
 226C.11	 Do ye say sae to me, Nelly?
 	 Do ye say sae to me?
 	 Wad ye leave your father and mither,
 	 And awa wi that fellow wad gae?
 226C.12	 She has kilted her coats o green silk
 	 A little below her knee,
 	 And shes awa to the Hielands wi Donald,
 	 To bear him companie.
 226C.13	 And whan they cam to the vallies
 	 The hie hills war coverd wi snow,
 	 Which caused monie a saut tear
 	 From Lizies een to flow.
 226C.14	 O, gin I war in Edinbruch city,
 	 And safe in my ain countrie,
 	 O, gin I war in Edinbruch city,
 	 The Hielands shoud never see me.
 226C.15	 O haud your tongue, Lizie Lindsey,
 	 Na mair o that let me see;
 	 Ill tak ye back to Edinbruch city,
 	 And safe to your ain countrie.
 226C.16	 RRrrThough I war in Edinbruch city,
 	 And safe in my ain countrie,
 	 Though I war in Edinbruch city,
 	 O wha wad care for me!
 226C.17	 Whan they cam to the shiels o Kilcushneuch,
 	 Out there cam an auld dey:
 	 Yere welcome here, Sir Donald,
 	 You and your lady gay.
 226C.18	 Ca me na mair Sir Donald,
 	 But ca me Donald your son,
 	 And Ill ca ye my auld mither,
 	 Till the lang winter nicht is begun.
 226C.19	 A this was spoken in Erse,
 	 That Lizie micht na ken;
 	 A this was spoken in Erse,
 	 And syne the broad English began.
 226C.20	 Yell gae and mak to our supper
 	 A cup o the curds and whey,
 	 And yell mak a bed o green threshes,

 226C.21	 Won up, won up, Lizie Lindsey,
 	 Yeve lain oure lang in the day;

 	 To milk the ewes and the kye.
 226C.22	 Then up got Lizie Lindsey,
 	 And the tear blindit her ee:
 	 O, gin I war in Edinbruch city,
 	 The Hielands shoud never see me!
 226C.23	 Won up, won up, Lizie Lindsey,
 	 A fairer sicht ye hae to see;
 	 Do ye see yon bonnie braw castle?

 	 And many a laird and lord sought her,
 	 But nane o them a could her gain.
 226D.2	 Out spoke the heir o Kinkawsie,
 	 An down to his fader spoke he;
 	 Fat would ye think o me, fadther,
 	 Fat would ye think o me,
 	 To go to Edinburgh city,

 226D.3	 Out and spoke his auld modther,
 	 An auld revrend lady was she;
 	 Court her wi nae fause flatterie,
 	 But in great policie.
 226D.4	 He was nae in Edinbruch citie
 	 But a twalmont an a day,
 	 When a the young lairds an the ladies
 	 Went forth to sport an play:
 	 There was nane like Lizzy Lindsay,
 	 She was baith gallan an gay.
 226D.5	 Will ye go to the Hielans, Lizzy Linsay?

 	 Ill gar ye get cruds and green whey.
 226D.8	 Out it spoke Lizzys best maiden,
 	 A wat a fine creature was she;
 	 Tho I were born heir till a crown,
 	 Its young Donald that I would go wi.
 226D.9	 Oh say ye sae to me, Nelly?
 	 Oh say ye sae to me?
 	 Will I cast off my fine gowns and laces,
 	 An gae to the Highlans him wi?
 226D.10	 Shes putten her hand in her pocket,
 	 Shes taen out ten guineas roun:
 	 And that wad I gie to thee, Donald,
 	 To stay but ae hour i my room,

 226D.15	 They sought all Edinboro citie,
 	 They sought it roun an roun,
 	 Thinkin to fin Lizzy Lindsay,
 	 But awa to the Highlans shes gane.
 226D.16	 Whan they came to the shielin,
 	 Out bespoke the ould dye;
 	 Youre welcome home, Sir Donald,
 	 Lang hae we been thinkin for thee.
 226D.17	 Yell call nae mair Sir Donald,
 	 Yell call me nae sic thing;
 	 But yese be my auld mither,
 	 And Ise be Donald your sin.
 226D.18	 Yell mak for us a supper,

 	 A supper o cruds and why,
 	 And likewise a bed o green rashes,
 	 For Lizzy and him to ly.
 226D.20	 But Donald rose up i the mornin,
 	 The rest o his glens to spy;
 	 It was to look for his goats,
 	 His goats, his yows, an his kye.
 226D.21	 But Lizzy, beein wearied wi travel,
 	 She lay till twas lang i the day:
 	 Get up, get up, Lizzy Linsay,
 	 What maks you sae lang for to ly?
 	 You had better been helping my mither
 	 To milk her yews and her kye.
 226D.22	 But Lizzy drew till her her stockins,
 	 The tears fell down on her eye:
 	 I wish I were at Edinboro city,
 	 I can neither milk yews nor kye.
 226D.23	 Oh hold your tongue, Lizzy Linsay,

 <h3 align="CENTER">226E: Lizie Lindsay</h3>
 <pre>
 
 226E.1	 IN Edinburgh lived a lady,
 	 Was cad Lizie Lindsay by name,
 	 Was courted by mony fine suitors,
 	 And mony rich person of fame:
 	 Tho lords of renown had her courted,
 	 Yet none her favour could gain.
 226E.2	 Then spake the young laird o Kingcaussie,
 	 And a bonny young boy was he;
 	 Then let me a year to the city,
 	 Ill come, and that lady wi me.
 226E.3	 Then spake the auld laird o Kingcaussie,
 	 A canty auld mannie was he;
 	 What think ye by our little Donald,
 	 Sae proudly and crously cracks he?
 226E.4	 But hes win a year to the city,
 	 If that I be a living man;
 	 And what he can mak o this lady,
 	 We shall lat him do as he can.
 226E.5	 Hes stript aff his fine costly robes,
 	 And put on the single liverie;
 	 With no equipage nor attendance,
 	 To Edinburgh city went he.
 226E.6	 Now there was a ball in the city,
 	 A ball o great mirth and great fame;
 	 And fa danced wi Donald that day
 	 But bonny Lizie Lindsay on the green!
 226E.7	 Will ye gang to the Hielands, bonny Lizie?
 	 Will ye gang to the Hielands wi me?
 	 Will ye leave the South Country ladies,
 	 And gang to the Hielands wi me?
 226E.8	 The lady she turned about,
 	 And answered him courteouslie;
 	 Id like to ken faer I am gaun first,
 	 And fa I am gaun to gang wi.
 226E.9	 O Lizie, ae favour Ill ask you,
 	 This favour I pray not deny;
 	 Yell tell me your place of abode,
 	 And your nearest o kindred do stay.
 226E.10	 Yell call at the Canogate-Port,
 	 At the Canogate-Port call ye;
 	 Ill gie you a bottle o wine,
 	 And Ill bear you my companie.
 226E.11	 Syne he called at the Canogate-Port,
 	 At the Canogate-Port calld he;
 	 She gae him a bottle o wine,
 	 And she gae him her companie.
 226E.12	 Will ye gang to the Hielands, bonny Lizie?
 	 Will ye gang to the Hielands wi me?
 	 Will ye leave the South Country ladies,
 	 And gang to the Hielands wi me?
 226E.13	 Then out spake Lizies auld mither,
 	 For a very auld lady was she;
 	 If ye cast ony creed on my dochter,
 	 High hanged Ill cause you to be.
 226E.14	 O keep hame your dochter, auld woman,
 	 And latna her gang wi me;
 	 I can cast nae mair creed on your dochter,
 	 Nae mair than she can on me.
 226E.15	 Now, young man, ae question Ill ask you,
 	 Sin ye mean to honour us sae;
 	 Yell tell me how braid your lands lie,
 	 Your name, and faer ye hae to gae.
 226E.16	 My father he is an auld soutter,
 	 My mither she is an auld dey,
 	 And Im but a puir broken trooper,
 	 My kindred I winna deny.
 226E.17	 Yet Im nae a man o great honour,
 	 Nor am I a man o great fame;
 	 My name it is Donald MDonald,
 	 Ill tell it, and winna think shame.
 226E.18	 Will ye gang to the Hielands, bonny Lizie?
 	 Will ye gang to the Hielands wi me?
 	 Will ye leave the South Country ladies,
 	 And gang to the Hielands wi me?
 226E.19	 O Donald, Ill gie you ten guineas,
 	 If ye woud but stay in my room
 	 Until that I draw your fair picture,
 	 To look on it fan I think lang.
 226E.20	 No, I carena mair for your guineas,
 	 Nae mair than ye care for mine;
 	 But if that ye love my ain person,
 	 Gae wi me, maid, if ye incline.
 226E.21	 Then out spake Lizies bower-woman,
 	 And a bonny young lassie was she;
 	 Tho I was born heir to a crown,
 	 Young Donald, I woud gang him wi.
 226E.22	 Up raise then the bonny young lady,
 	 And drew till her stockings and sheen,
 	 And packd up her claise in fine bundles,
 	 And awa wi young Donald shes gane.
 226E.23	 The roads they were rocky and knabby,
 	 The mountains were baith strait and stay;
 	 When Lizie grew wearied wi travel,
 	 For shed travelld a very lang way.
 226E.24	 O turn again, bonny Lizie Lindsay,
 	 O turn again, said he;
 	 Were but ae days journey frae town,
 	 O turn, and Ill turn wi thee.
 226E.25	 Out speaks the bonny young lady,
 	 Till the saut tear blinded her ee;
 	 Altho Id return to the city,
 	 Theres nae person woud care for me.
 226E.26	 When they came near the end o their journey,
 	 To the house o their fathers milk-dey,
 	 He said, Stay still there, Lizie Lindsay,
 	 Till I tell my mither o thee.
 226E.27	 When he came into the shielen,
 	 She hailed him courteouslie;
 	 Said, Yere welcome hame, Sir Donald,
 	 Theres been mony ane calling for thee.
 226E.28	 O ca me na mair, Sir Donald,
 	 But Donald MDonald your son;
 	 Well carry the joke a bit farther,
 	 Theres a bonny young lady to come.
 226E.29	 When Lizie came into the shielen,
 	 She lookd as if shed been a feel;
 	 She sawna a seat to sit down on,
 	 But only some sunks o green feall.
 226E.30	 Now make us a supper, dear mither,
 	 The best o your cruds and green whey;
 	 And make us a bed o green rashes,
 	 And covert wi huddins sae grey.
 226E.31	 But Lizie being wearied wi travel,
 	 She lay till twas up i the day:
 	 Ye might hae been up an hour seener,
 	 To milk baith the ewes and the kye.
 226E.32	 Out then speaks the bonny young lady,
 	 Whan the saut tear drapt frae her eye;
 	 I wish that I had bidden at hame,
 	 I can neither milk ewes nor kye.
 226E.33	 I wish that I had bidden at hame,

 226G.4	 But the roads grew broad and broad,
 	 And the mountains grew high and high,
 	 Which caused many a tear
 	 To fall from Leezies eye.
 226G.5	 But the roads grew broad and broad,
 	 And the mountains grew high and high,
 	 Till they came to the glens of Glen Koustie,
 	 And out there came an old die.

 226G.7	 O call me not Sir Donald,
 	 But call me Donald your son,
 	 And I will call you mother,
 	 Till this long night be done.
 226G.8	 These words were spoken in Gaelic,
 	 And Leezie did not them ken;
 	 These words were spoken in Gaelic,
 	 And then plain English began.
 226G.9	 O make her a supper, mother,
 	 O make her a supper wi me;
 	 O make her a supper, mother,
 	 Of curds and green whey.

 	 And a braw new bigging saw she,
 	 And out cam Lord Macdonald,
 	 And his gay companie.
 226G.12	 Youre welcome here, Leezie Lindsay,
 	 The flower of a your kin,
 	 And you shall be Lady Macdonald,
