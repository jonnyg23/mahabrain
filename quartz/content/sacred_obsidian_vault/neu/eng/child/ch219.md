 <h1 align="CENTER">219A: The Gardener</h1>
 <pre>
 
 219A.1	 THE gardener stands in his bower-door,
 	 With a primrose in his hand,
 	 And by there came a leal maiden,
 	 As jimps a willow wand.
 	 And by, etc.
 219A.2	 O lady, can you fancy me,
 	 For to be my bride,
 	 Youll get a the flowers in my garden,
 	 To be to you a weed.
 219A.3	 The lily white shall be your smock;
 	 Becomes your body neat;
 	 And your head shall be deckd with jelly-flower,
 	 And the primrose in your breast.
 219A.4	 Your gown shall be o the sweet-william,
 	 Your coat o camovine,
 	 And your apron o the salads neat,
 	 That taste baith sweet and fine.
 219A.5	 Your stockings shall be o the broad kail-blade,
 	 That is baith broad and long;
 	 And narrow, narrow at the coot,
 	 And broad, broad at the brawn.
 219A.6	 Your gloves shall be the marygold,
 	 All glittering to your hand,
 	 Well spread oer wi the blue blaewort,
 	 That grows in corn-land.
 219A.7	 O fare you well, young man, she says,
 	 Farewell, and I bid adieu;
 	 Since youve provided a weed for me,
 	 Among the summer flowers,
 	 Then Ill provide another for you,
 	 Among the winter showers.
 219A.8	 The new-fallen snow to be your smock;
 	 Becomes your body neat;
 	 And your head shall be deckd with the eastern wind,
 	 And the cold rain on your breast.

 <h3 align="CENTER">219B: The Gardener</h3>
 <pre>
 
 219B.1	 ALL ye young men, I pray draw near,
 	 Ill let you hear my mind
 	 Concerning those who fickle are,
 	 And inconstant as the wind.
 219B.2	 A pretty maid who late livd here,
 	 And sweetheatrs many had,
 	 The gardener-lad he viewd them all,
 	 Just as they came and gaed.
 219B.3	 The gardener-lad he viewd them all,
 	 But swore he had no skill:
 	 If I were to go as oft to her,
 	 Ye surely would me kill.
 219B.4	 Im sure shes not a proper maid,
 	 Im sure she is not tall;
 	 Another young man standing by,
 	 he said, Slight none at all.
 219B.5	 For were all come of woman, he said,
 	 If ye woud call to mind,
 	 And to all women for her sake
 	 Ye surely should be kind.
 219B.6	 The summer hours and warm showers
 	 Make the the trees yield in the ground,
 	 And kindly words will woman win,
 	 And this maid Ill surround.
 219B.7	 The maid then stood in her bower-door,
 	 As straight as ony wand,
 	 When by it came the gardener-lad,
 	 With his hat in his hand.
 219B.8	 Will ye live on fruit, he said?
 	 Or will ye marry me?
 	 And amongst the flowers in my garden
 	 Ill shape a weed for thee.
 219B.9	 I will live on fruit, she says,
 	 But Ill never marry thee;
 	 For I can live without mankind,
 	 And without mankind Ill die.
 219B.10	 Ye shall not live without mankind,
 	 If yell accept of me;
 	 For among the flowers in my garden
 	 Ill shape a weed for thee.
 219B.11	 The lily white to be your smock;
 	 Becomes your body best;
 	 And the jelly-flower to be your quill,
 	 And the red rose in your breast.
 219B.12	 Your gown shall be o the pingo white,
 	 Your petticoat cammovine,
 	 Your apron o the seel o downs;
 	 Come smile, sweet heart o mine!
 219B.13	 Your shoes shall be o the gude rue red-+--+-
 	 Never did I garden ill-+--+-
 	 Your stockings o the mary mild;
 	 Come smile, sweet heart, your fill!
 219B.14	 Your gloves shall be o the green clover,
 	 Comes lockerin to your hand,
 	 Well dropped oer wi blue blavers,
 	 That grow among white land.
 219B.15	 Young man, yeve shapd a weed for me,
 	 In summer among your flowers;
 	 Now I will shape another for you,
 	 Among the winter showers.
 219B.16	 The snow so white shall be your shirt;
 	 It becomes your body best;
 	 The cold bleak wind to be your coat,
 	 And the cold wind in your breast.
 219B.17	 The steed that you shall ride upon
 	 Shall be o the weather snell,
 	 Well bridled wi the northern wind,
 	 And cold sharp showers o hail.
 219B.18	 The hat you on your head shall wear
 	 Shall be o the weather gray,
 	 And aye when you come into my sight
 	 Ill wish you were away.

 219C.1	 BURD ELLEN stands in her bower-door,
 	 As straucht s a hollan wand,
 	 And by it comes the gairdner-lad,
 	 Wi a red rose in his hand.
