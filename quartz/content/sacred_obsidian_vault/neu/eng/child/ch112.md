 <h1 align="CENTER">112A: Blow Away the Morning Dew</h1>
 <pre>
 
 112A.1	 YONDER comes a courteous knight,
 	 Lustely raking ouer the lay;
 	 He was well ware of a bonny lasse,
 	 As she came wandring ouer the way.
       Refrain:	Then she sang downe a downe, hey downe derry (bis)
 112A.2	 Ioue you speed, fayre lady, he said,
 	 Among the leaues that be so greene;
 	 If I were a king, and wore a crowne,
 	 Full soone, fair lady, shouldst thou be a queen.
 112A.3	 Also Ioue saue you, faire lady,
 	 Among the roses that be so red;
 	 If I haue not my will of you,
 	 Full soone, faire lady, shall I be dead.
 112A.4	 Then he lookt east, then hee lookt west,
 	 Hee lookt north, so did he south;
 	 He could not finde a priuy place,
 	 For all lay in the diuels mouth.
 112A.5	 If you will carry me, gentle sir,
 	 A mayde vnto my fathers hall,
 	 Then you shall haue your will of me,
 	 Vnder purple and vnder paule.
 112A.6	 He set her vp vpon a steed,
 	 And him selfe vpon another,
 	 And all the day he rode her by,
 	 As though they had been sister and brother.
 112A.7	 When she came to her fathers hall,
 	 It was well walled round about;
 	 She yode in at the wicket-gate,
 	 And shut the foure-eard foole without.
 112A.8	 You had me, quoth she, abroad in the field,
 	 Among the corne, amidst the hay,
 	 Where you might had your will of mee,
 	 For, in good faith, sir, I neuer said nay.
 112A.9	 Ye had me also amid the field,
 	 Among the rushes that were so browne,
 	 Where you might had your will of me,
 	 But you had not the face to lay me downe.
 112A.10	 He pulled out his nut-browne sword,
 	 And wipt the rust off with his sleeue,
 	 And said, Ioues curse come to his heart
 	 That any woman would beleeue!
 112A.11	 When you haue you owne true-loue
 	 A mile or twaine out of the towne,
 	 Spare not for her gay clothing,
 	 But lay her body flat on the ground.

 <h3 align="CENTER">112B: Blow Away the Morning Dew</h3>

 112B.1	 THERE was a knight, and he was young,
 	 A riding along the way, sir,
 	 And there he met a lady fair,
 	 Among the cocks of hay, sir.
 112B.2	 Quoth he, Shall you and I, lady,
 	 Among the grass lye down a?
 	 And I will have a special care
 	 Of rumpling of your gown a.
 112B.3	 If you will go along with me
 	 Unto my fathers hall, sir,
 	 You shall enjoy my maidenhead,
 	 And my estate and all, sir.
 112B.4	 So he mounted her on a milk-white steed,
 	 Himself upon another,
 	 And then they rid upon the road,
 	 Like sister and like brother.
 112B.5	 And when she came to her fathers house,
 	 Which was moated round about, sir,
 	 She stepped streight within the gate,
 	 And shut this young knight out, sir.
 112B.6	 Here is a purse of gold, she said,
 	 Take if for your pains, sir;
 	 And I will send my fathers man
 	 To go home with you again, sir.
 112B.7	 And if you meet a lady fair,
 	 As you go thro the next town, sir,
 	 You must not fear the dew of the grass,
 	 Nor the rumpling of her gown, sir.
 112B.8	 And if you meet a lady gay,
 	 As you go by the hill, sir,
 	 If you will not when you may,
 	 You shall not when you will, sir.

 <h3 align="CENTER">112C: Blow Away the Morning Dew</h3>
 <pre>
 
 112C.1	 THERE was a knight was drunk with wine
 	 A riding along the way, sir,
 	 And there he did meet with a lady fine,
 	 And among the cocks of hay, sir.
 112C.2	 One favour he did crave of her,
 	 And askd her to lay her down, sir,
 	 But he had neither cloth nor sheet,
 	 To keep her from the ground, sir.
 112C.3	 There is a great dew upon the grass,
 	 And if you shoud lay me down, sir,
 	 You would spoil my gay clothing,
 	 That has cost me many a pound, sir.
 112C.4	 I have a cloak of scarlet red,
 	 Ill lay it under you, love,
 	 So you will grant me my request
 	 That I shall ask of you, love.
 112C.5	 And if youll go to my fathers hall,
 	 That is moated all round about, sir,
 	 There you shall have your will of me,
 	 Within, sir, and without, sir.
 112C.6	 Oh yonder stands my milk-white steed,
 	 And among the cocks of hay, sir;
 	 If the kings pinner should chance to come,
 	 Hell take my steed away, sir.
 112C.7	 I have a ring upon my finger,
 	 Its made of the finest gold, love,
 	 And it shall serve to fetch your steed
 	 Out of the pinners fold, love.
 112C.8	 And if youll go to my fathers house,
 	 Round which theres many a tree, sir,
 	 There you shall have your chamber free,
 	 And your chamberlain Ill be, sir.
 112C.9	 He sate her on a milk-white steed,
 	 Himself upon another,
 	 And then they rid along the way,
 	 Like sister and like brother.
 112C.10	 But when she came to her fathers house,
 	 Which was moated all round about, sir,
 	 She slipd herself within the gate,
 	 And she lockd the knight without, sir.
 112C.11	 I thank you, kind knight, for seeing me here,
 	 And bringing me home a maiden, sir,
 	 But you shall have two of my fathers men
 	 For to set you as far back again, sir.
 112C.12	 He drew his sword out of his scabbard,
 	 And whet it upon his sleeve, sir,
 	 Saying, Cursed be to evry man
 	 That will a maid believe, sir!
 112C.13	 She drew her handkerchief out of her pocket,
 	 And threw it upon the ground, sir,
 	 Saying, Thrice cursed be to evry maid
 	 That will believe a man, sir!
 112C.14	 We have a tree in our garden,
 	 Some call it of rosemary, sir;
 	 Theres crowing-cocks in our town,
 	 That will make a capon of you, sir.
 112C.15	 We have a flower in our garden,
 	 Some call it a marygold, sir,
 	 And he that would not when he might,
 	 He shall not when he would, sir.
 112C.16	 But if you chance for to meet a maid,
 	 A little below the town, sir,
 	 You must not fear her gay cloathing,
 	 Nor the wrinkling of her gown, sir.
 112C.17	 And if you chance for to meet a maid,
 	 A little below the hill, sir,
 	 You need not fear her screeking out,
 	 For she quickly will lye still, sir.
 112C.18	 The baffld knight was by the lass
 	 Ingeniously outwitted,
 	 And since that time it came to pass
 	 He was again well fitted.
 112C.19	 As he was riding cross a plain,
 	 In boots, spurs, hat and feather,
 	 He met that lady fair again;
 	 They talkd a while together.
 112C.20	 He said, Tho you did serve me so,
 	 And cunningly decoy me,
 	 Yet now, before you further go,
 	 I must and will enjoy thee.
 112C.21	 RRrrtwas near a spacious rivers side,
 	 Where rushes green were growing,
 	 And Neptunes silver streams did glide,
 	 Four fathom waters flowing.
 112C.22	 The lady blushd like scarlet red,
 	 And trembled at this stranger:
 	 How shall I guard my maidenhead
 	 From this approaching danger!
 112C.23	 With a lamenting sigh, said she,
 	 To dye I now am ready;
 	 Must this dishonour fall on me?
 	 A most unhappy lady!
 112C.24	 He from his saddle did alight,
 	 In gaudy rich attire,
 	 And cried, I am a noble knight,
 	 Who do your charms admire.
 112C.25	 He took the lady by the hand,
 	 Who seemingly consented,
 	 And woud no more disputing stand:
 	 She had a plot invented.
 112C.26	 How she might baffle him again,
 	 With much delight and pleasure,
 	 And eke unspotted still remain,
 	 With her pure virgin treasure.
 112C.27	 Look yonder, good sir knight, I pray:
 	 Methinks I do discover,
 	 Well mounted on a dapple-grey,
 	 My true, entire lover.
 112C.28	 The knight, he standing on the brink
 	 Of the deep floating river,
 	 Thought she, Thou now shalt swim or sink;
 	 Choose which you fancy rather.
 112C.29	 Against his back the lady run;
 	 The waters strait he sounded;
 	 He cryd out, Love, what have you done!
 	 Help! help! or I am drowned.
 112C.30	 Said she, Sir knight, farewel, adieu;
 	 You see what comes of fooling;
 	 That is the fittest place for you,
 	 Whose courage wanted cooling.
 112C.31	 Love help me out, and Ill forgive
 	 This fault which youve committed;
 	 No, no, says she, Sir, as I live,
 	 I think youre finely fitted.
 112C.32	 She rid home to her fathers house,
 	 For speedy expedition,
 	 While the gay knight was soakd like souce,
 	 In a sad wet condition.
 112C.33	 1 When he came mounted to the plain
 	 He was in rich attire,
 	 Yet when he back returnd again
 	 He was all muck and mire.
 	 Yet when he back returnd again
 	 He was all muck and mire.
 112C.34	 A solemn vow he there did make,
 	 Just as he came from swiming,
 	 Hed love no lady, for her sake,
 	 Nor any other women.
 112C.35	 The baffld knight was foold once more,
 	 Youll find by this pleasant ditty,
 	 For she whose charms he did adore
 	 Was wonderful sharp and witty.
 112C.36	 Returning from her fathers park,
 	 Just close by a summer bower,
 	 She chancd to meet her angry spark,
 	 Who gave her a frowning lower.
 112C.37	 The thoughts of what she twice had done
 	 Did cause him to draw his rapier,
 	 And at the lady then he run,
 	 And thus he began to vapour:
 112C.38	 You chousd me at your fathers gate,
 	 Then tumbld me into the river;
 	 I seek for satisfaction straight;
 	 Shall I be a fool forever?
 112C.39	 He came with resolution bent
 	 That evening to enjoy her,
 	 And if she did not give consent,
 	 That minute he would destroy her.
 112C.40	 I pray, sir knight, and why so hot
 	 Against a young silly woman?
 	 Such crimes as these might be forgot;
 	 For merry intrigues are common.
 112C.41	 What! do you count it mirth, he cryd,
 	 To tumble me in and leave me?
 	 What if I drowned there had dyd?
 	 A dangerous jest, believe me.
 112C.42	 Well, if I pardon you this day
 	 Those injuries out of measure,
 	 It is because without delay
 	 I mean to enjoy the pleasure.
 112C.43	 Your suit, she said, is not denyd,
 	 But think of your boots of leather,
 	 And let me pull them off, she cryd,
 	 Before we lye down together.
 112C.44	 He set him down upon the grass,
 	 And violets so sweet and tender;
 	 Now by this means it came to pass
 	 That she did his purpose hinder.
 112C.45	 For having pulld his boots half-way,
 	 She cryd, I am now your betters;
 	 You shall not make of me your prey;
 	 Sit there, like a thief in fetters.
 112C.46	 Now finding she had servd him so,
 	 He rose and began to grumble;
 	 Yet he could neither stand nor go,
 	 But did like a cripple tumble.
 112C.47	 The boots stuck fast, and would not stir;
 	 His folly she soon did mention,
 	 And laughing said, I pray, kind sir,
 	 How like you my new invention?
 112C.48	 My laughing fit you must excuse;
 	 You are but a stingless nettle;
 	 Youd neer a stood for boots or shooes,
 	 Had you been a man of mettle.
 112C.49	 Farewel, sir knight, tis almost ten;
 	 I fear neither wind nor weather;
 	 Ill send my fathers serving-men
 	 To pull off your boots of leather.
 112C.50	 She laughed outright, as well she might,
 	 With merry conceits of scorning,
 	 And left him there to sit all night,
 	 Untill the approaching morning.
 112C.51	 The fourth part of the baffld knight
 	 The lady hath fairly acted;
 	 She did his love and kindness slight,
 	 Which made him almost distracted.
 112C.52	 She left him in her fathers park,
 	 Where nothing but deer could hear him;
 	 While he lay rouling in the dark,
 	 Theres never a soul came near him.
 112C.53	 Until the morning break of day,
 	 And being warm summer weather,
 	 A shepherd chancd to come that way,
 	 Who pulld on his boots of leather.
 112C.54	 Then mounting on his milk-white steed,
 	 He, shaking his ears, was ready,
 	 And whip and spur he rid with speed
 	 To find out this crafty lady.
 112C.55	 If once this lady I come nigh
 	 She shall be released by no man:
 	 Why shoud so brave a knight as I
 	 Be foold by a silly woman!
 112C.56	 Three times she has affronted me,
 	 In crimes which I cannot pardon;
 	 But if I ant revengd, said he,
 	 Let me not be worth a farthing.
 112C.57	 I value not her beauty fair,
 	 Tho once I did dote upon her;
 	 This trusty sword shall now repair
 	 My baffled, blasted honour.
 112C.58	 Unto her fathers house he came,
 	 Which every side was moated;
 	 The fair sweet youthful charming dame,
 	 His angry brows she noted.
 112C.59	 Thought she, Ill have the other bout,
 	 And tumble him in the river;
 	 And let the Devil help him out,
 	 Or there he shall soak for ever.
 112C.60	 He will not let me live at rest,
 	 Although I have often foild him;
 	 Therefore once more, I do protest,
 	 With flattering Ill beguile him.
 112C.61	 The bridge was drawn, the gates lockd fast,
 	 So that he could no ways enter;
 	 She smild to him, and cryd at last,
 	 Sir knight, if you please to venture,
 112C.62	 A plank lies over the moat hard by,
 	 Full seventeen foot in measure;
 	 Theres no body now at home but I;
 	 Therefore well take our pleasure.
 112C.63	 This word she had no sooner spoke,
 	 But straight he was tripping over;
 	 The plank was sawd, and snapping broke;
 	 He provd an unhappy lover.

 112D.1	 THERE was a shepherds son
 	 Kept sheep upon a hill;
 	 He laid his pipe and crook aside,
 	 And there he slept his fill.
       Refrain:	Sing, Fal deral, etc.
 112D.2	 He looked east, he looked west,
 	 Then gave an under-look,
 	 And there he spyed a lady fair,
 	 Swimming in a brook.
 112D.3	 He raisd his head frae his green bed,
 	 And then approachd the maid;
 	 Put on your claiths, my dear, he says,
 	 And be ye not afraid.
 112D.4	 RRrrtis fitter for a lady fair
 	 To sew her silken seam
 	 Than to get up in a May morning
 	 And strive against the stream.
 112D.5	 If youll not touch my mantle,
 	 And let my claiths alane,
 	 Then Ill give you as much money
 	 As you can carry hame.
 112D.6	 O Ill not touch your mantle,
 	 And Ill let your claiths alane;
 	 But Ill tak you out of the clear water,
 	 My dear, to be my ain.
 112D.7	 And when she out of the water came,
 	 He took her in his arms:
 	 Put on your claiths, my dear, he says,
 	 And hide those lovely charms.
 112D.8	 He mounted her on a milk-white steed,
 	 Himself upon anither,
 	 And all along the way they rode,
 	 Like sister and like brither.
 112D.9	 When she came to her fathers yate
 	 She tirled at the pin,
 	 And ready stood the porter there,
 	 To let this fair maid in.
 112D.10	 And when the gate was opened,
 	 So nimblys she whipt in;
 	 Pough! youre a fool without, she says,
 	 And Im a maid within.
 112D.11	 Then fare ye well, my modest boy,
 	 I thank you for your care;
 	 But had you done what you should do,
 	 I neer had left you there.
 112D.12	 Oh Ill cast aff my hose and shoon,
 	 And let my feet gae bare,
 	 And gin I meet a bonny lass,
 	 Hang me if her I spare.
 112D.13	 In that do as you please, she says,
 	 But you shall never more
 	 Have the same opportunity;
 	 With that she shut the door.
 112D.14	 There is a gude auld proverb,
 	 Ive opten heard it told,
 	 He that would not when he might,
 	 He should not when he would.

 112E.1	 THERE was a knight, was drunk with wine,
 	 Came riding along the way, sir;
 	 He would have had a lady gay
 	 Amang the quiles of hay, sir.
 112E.2	 What if I should lay thee down,
 	 Amang the quiles of hay, maid?
 	 Sheets nor blankets have I none,
 	 To keep thy cloathing clean, maid.
 112E.3	 The wind blaws east, the wind blaws west,
 	 The wind blaws owre yon thorn, sir;
 	 Weel may I wash my cloathing clear,
 	 And dry them on the morn, sir.
 112E.4	 What if I should lay thee down,
 	 Amang the rigs of corn, maid?
 	 Then the kings life-guard will come,
 	 And steal our steeds away, maid.
 112E.5	 I have ten gold rings on my hand,
 	 Theyre all gold but the stone, sir;
 	 Ill give them to the kings life-guard,
 	 If hell let our steeds alone, sir.
 112E.6	 But see you not yon sunny bank,
 	 Over yon lily lea, sir,
 	 Where you and I may crack a while,
 	 And never one may see, sir?
 112E.7	 He was on a milk-white steed,
 	 And she was on another,
 	 And all the live-long winter night
 	 They rode like sister and brother.
 112E.8	 When they came to that sunny bank,
 	 He began to lay her down, sir;
 	 O no, O no, kind sir, she says,
 	 Yell ruffle all my gown, sir.
 112E.9	 My gown it cost my father dear,
 RRrrtwas	many a mark and pound, sir;
 	 And if that ye do lay me down,
 	 Yell ruffle all my gown, sir.
 112E.10	 But see ye na yon fair castel,

 112E.11	 He was on a milk-white steed,
 	 And she was on another,
 	 And all the live-long winter night
 	 They rode like sister and brother.
 112E.12	 When they came to that fair castel,
 	 She was at her fathers yet, sir;
 	 She jumped in at her fathers door,
 	 And left this knight without, sir.
 112E.13	 She says, I am a maid within,
 	 Youre but a knave without, sir;
 	 There were neer a butchers son
 	 Put me in so much doubt, sir.
 112E.14	 Oh if I had thee out, he said,
 	 But two miles from the town, maid,
 	 I would lay thee down, he said,
 	 And never mind thy gown, maid.
 112E.15	 There is a flower in my fathers garden,
 	 The name ot marigold, sir,
 	 And he that would not when he might,

 112E.17	 Yere like unto my fathers steed;
 	 Hes standing in the lone, sir;
