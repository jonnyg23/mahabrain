 <pre>
 
 170A.1	 QUEEN JANE was in labour full six weeks and more,
 	 And the women were weary, and fain would give oer:
 	 O women, O women, as women ye be,
 	 Rip open my two sides, and save my baby!
 170A.2	 O royal Queen Jane, that thing may not be;
 	 Well send for King Henry to come unto thee.
 	 King Henry came to her, and sate on her bed:
 	 What ails my dear lady, her eyes look so red?
 170A.3	 O royal King Henry, do one thing for me:
 	 Rip open my two sides, and save my baby!
 	 O royal Queen Jane, that thing will not do;
 	 If I lose your fair body, Ill lose your baby too.
 170A.4	 She wept and she waild, and she wrung her hands sore;
 	 O the flour of England must flurish no more!
 	 She wept and she waild till she fell in a swoond,
 	 They opend her two sides, and the baby was found.
 170A.5	 The baby was christened with joy and much mirth,
 	 Whilst poor Queen Janes body lay cold under earth:
 	 There was ringing and singing and mourning all day,
 	 The princess Eliz[abeth] went weeping away.
 170A.6	 The trumpets in mourning so sadly did sound,
 	 And the pikes and the muskets did trail on the ground.
 	 . . . .

 	 Till women and midwives had quite gien her oer:
 	 O if ye were women as women should be,
 	 Ye would send for a doctor, a doctor to me.
 170B.2	 The doctor was called for and set by her bedside:
 	 What aileth thee, my ladie, thine eyes seem so red?
 	 O doctor, O doctor, will ye do this for me,
 	 To rip up my two sides, and save my babie?
 170B.3	 Queen Jeanie, Queen Jeanie, thats the thing Ill neer do,
 	 To rip up your two sides to save your babie:
 	 Queen Jeanie, Queen Jeanie, traveld six weeks and more,
 	 Till midwives and doctors had quite gien her oer.

 	 To rip up your two sides to save your babie.
 170B.6	 But with sighing and sobbing shes fallen in a swoon,
 	 Her side it was ript up, and her babie was found;
 	 At this bonie babies christning there was meikle joy and mirth,
 	 But bonnie Queen Jeanie lies cold in the earth.
 170B.7	 Six and six coaches, and six and six more,
 	 And royal King Henry went mourning before;
 	 O two and two gentlemen carried her away,
 	 But royal King Henry went weeping away.
 170B.8	 O black were their stockings, and black were their bands,
 	 And black were the weapons they held in their hands;
 	 O black were their mufflers, and black were their shoes,
 	 And black were the cheverons they drew on their luves.
 170B.9	 They mourned in the kitchen, and they mournd in the ha,
 	 But royal King Henry mournd langest of a:
 	 Farewell to fair England, farewell for evermore!
 	 For the fair flower of England will never shine more.
