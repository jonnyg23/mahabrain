 <h1 align="CENTER">135A: Robin Hood and the Shepherd</h1>
 <pre>
 
 135A.1	 ALL gentlemen and yeomen good,
 	 Down a down a down a down
 	 I wish you to draw near;
 	 For a story of gallant brave Robin Hood
 	 Vnto you I wil declare.
 	 Down, etc.
 135A.2	 As Robin Hood walkt the forrest along,
 	 Some pastime for to spie,
 	 There was he aware of a jolly shepherd,
 	 That on the ground did lie.
 135A.3	 Arise, arise, cryed jolly Robin,
 	 And now come let me see
 	 What is in thy bag and bottle, I say;
 	 Come tell it unto me.
 135A.4	 Whats that to thee, thou proud fellow?
 	 Tell me as I do stand
 	 What thou hast to do with my bag and bottle?
 	 Let me see thy command.
 135A.5	 My sword, which hangeth by my side,
 	 Is my command I know;
 	 Come, and let me taste of thy bottle,
 	 Or it may breed thee wo.
 135A.6	 Tut, the devil a drop, thou proud fellow,
 	 Of my bottle thou shalt see,
 	 Untill thy valour here be tried,
 	 Whether thou wilt fight or flee.
 135A.7	 What shall we fight for? cries bold Robin Hood;
 	 Come tell it soon to me;
 	 Here is twenty pounds in good red gold;
 	 Win it, and take it thee.
 135A.8	 The Shepherd stood all in a maze,
 	 And knew not what to say:
 	 I have no money, thou proud fellow,
 	 But bag and bottle Ile lay.
 135A.9	 I am content, thou shepherd-swain,
 	 Fling them down on the ground;
 	 But it will breed thee mickle pain,
 	 To win my twenty pound.
 135A.10	 Come draw thy sword, thou proud fellow,
 	 Thou stands too long to prate;
 	 This hook of mine shall let thee know
 	 A coward I do hate.
 135A.11	 So they fell to it, full hardy and sore;
 	 It was in a summers day;
 	 From ten till four in the afternoon
 	 The Shepherd held him play.
 135A.12	 Robins buckler proved his chief defence,
 	 And saved him many a bang,
 	 For every blow the Shepherd gave
 	 Made Robins sword cry twang.
 135A.13	 y a sturdy blow the Shepherd gave,
 	 And that bold Robin found,
 	 Till the blood ran trickling from his head;
 	 Then he fell to the ground.
 135A.14	 Arise, arise, thou proud fellow,
 	 And thou shalt have fair play,
 	 If thou wilt yield, before thou go,
 	 That I have won the day.
 135A.15	 A boon, a boon, cried bold Robin;
 	 If that a man thou be,
 	 Then let me take my beaugle-horn,
 	 And blow but blasts three.
 135A.16	 To blow three times three, the Shepherd said,
 	 I will not thee deny;
 	 For if thou shouldest blow till to-morrow morn,
 	 I scorn one foot to fly.
 135A.17	 Then Robin set his horn to his mouth,
 	 And he blew with mickle main,
 	 Until he espied Little John
 	 Come tripping over the plain.
 135A.18	 O who is yonder, thou proud fellow,
 	 That comes down yonder hill?
 	 Yonder is Little John, bold Robin Hoods man,
 	 Shall fight with thee thy fill.
 135A.19	 What is the matter? saies Little John,
 	 Master, come tell to me:
 	 My case is great, saies Robin Hood,
 	 For the Shepherd hath conquered me.
 135A.20	 I am glad of that, cries Little John,
 	 Shepherd, turn thou to me;
 	 For a bout with thee I mean to have,
 	 Either come fight or flee.
 135A.21	 With all my heart, thou proud fellow,
 	 For it never shall be said
 	 That a shepherds hook of thy sturdy look
 	 Will one jot be dismaid.
 135A.22	 So they fell to it, full hardy and sore,
 	 Striving for victory;
 	 I will know, saies John,  re we give ore,
 	 Whether thou wilt fight or flye.
 135A.23	 The Shepherd gave John a sturdy blow,
 	 With his hook under the chin;
 	 Beshrew thy heart, said Little John,
 	 Thou basely dost begin.
 135A.24	 Nay, thats nothing, said the Shepherd;
 	 Either yield to me the day,
 	 Or I will bang thee back and sides,
 	 Before thou goest thy way.
 135A.25	 What? dost thou think, thou proud fellow,
 	 That thou canst conquer me?
 	 Nay, thou shalt know, before thou go,
 	 Ile fight before Ile flee.
 135A.26	 With that to thrash Little John like mad
 	 The Shepherd he begun;
 	 Hold, hold, cryed bold Robin Hood,
 	 And Ile yield the wager won.
 135A.27	 With all my heart, said Little John,
 	 To that I will agree;
 	 For he is the flower of shepherd-swains,
 	 The like I never did see.
 135A.28	 Thus have you heard of Robin Hood,
 	 Also of Little John,
 	 How a shepherd-swain did conquer them;
 	 The like did never none.
