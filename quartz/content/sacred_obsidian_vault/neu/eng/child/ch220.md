 <pre>
 
 220A.1	 OUR king he has a secret to tell,
 	 And ay well keepit it must be:
 	 The English lords are coming down
 	 To dance and win the victory.
 220A.2	 Our king has cryd a noble cry,
 	 And ay well keepit it must be:
 	 Gar saddle ye, and bring to me
 	 The bonny lass of Anglesey.
 220A.3	 Up she starts, as white as the milk,
 	 Between him and his company:
 	 What is the thing I hae to ask,
 	 If I sould win the victory?
 220A.4	 Fifteen ploughs but and a mill
 	 I gie thee till the day thou die,
 	 And the fairest knight in a my court
 	 To chuse thy husband for to be.
 220A.5	 Shes taen the fifteen lord[s] by the hand,
 	 Saying, Will ye come dance with me?
 	 But on the morn at ten oclock
 	 They gave it oer most shamefully.
 220A.6	 Up then rais the fifteenth lord-+--+-
 	 I wat an angry man was he-+--+-
 	 Laid by frae him his belt and sword,
 	 And to the floor gaed manfully.
 220A.7	 He said, My feet shall be my dead
 	 Before she win the victory;
 	 But before twas ten oclock at night
 	 He gaed it oer as shamefully.

 	 He dancd full fast, but tired at last,
 	 And gae it up as shamefullie.
