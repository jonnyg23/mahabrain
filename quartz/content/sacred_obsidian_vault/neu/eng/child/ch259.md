 <h1 align="CENTER">259A: Lord Thomas Stuart</h1>
 <pre>
 
 259A.1	 THOMAS STUART was a lord,
 	 A lord of mickle land;
 	 He used to wear a coat of gold,
 	 But now his grave is green.
 259A.2	 Now he has wooed the young countess,
 	 The Countess of Balquhin,
 	 An given her for a morning-gift
 	 Strathboggie and Aboyne.
 259A.3	 But womens wit is aye willful,
 	 Alas that ever it was sae!
 	 She longed to see the morning-gift
 	 That her gude lord to her gae.
 259A.4	 When steeds were saddled an weel bridled,
 	 An ready for to ride,
 	 There came a pain on that gude lord,
 	 His back, likewise his side.
 259A.5	 He said, Ride on, my lady fair,
 	 May goodness be your guide!
 	 For Im sae sick and weary that
 	 No farther can I ride.
 259A.6	 Now ben did come his father dear,
 	 Wearing a golden band;
 	 Says, Is there nae leech in Edinburgh
 	 Can cure my son from wrang?
 259A.7	 O leech is come, an leech is gane,
 	 Yet, father, Im aye waur;
 	 Theres not a leech in Edinbro
 	 Can death from me debar.
 259A.8	 But be a friend to my wife, father,
 	 Restore to her her own;
 	 Restore to her my morning-gift,
 	 Strathboggie and Aboyne.
 259A.9	 It had been gude for my wife, father,
 	 To me shed born a son;
 	 He would have got my land an rents,
 	 Where they lie out an in.
 259A.10	 It had been gude for my wife, father,
 	 To me shed born an heir;
 	 He would have got my lands an rents,
 	 Where they lie fine and fair.
 259A.11	 The steeds they strave into their stables,
 	 The boys couldnt get them bound;
 	 The hounds lay howling on the leech,
 	 Cause their master was behind.
 259A.12	 I dreamed a dream since late yestreen,
 	 I wish it may be good,
 	 That our chamber was full of swine,
 	 An our bed full of blood.
 259A.13	 I saw a woman come from the West,
 	 Full sore wringing her hands,
 	 And aye she cried, Ohon, alas!
 	 My good lords broken bands.
 259A.14	 As she came by my good lords bower,
 	 Saw mony black steeds an brown:
 	 Im feared it be mony unco lords
 	 Havin my love from town!
 259A.15	 As she came by my gude lords bower,
 	 Saw mony black steeds an grey:
 	 Im feared its mony unco lords
 	 Havin my love to the clay!
