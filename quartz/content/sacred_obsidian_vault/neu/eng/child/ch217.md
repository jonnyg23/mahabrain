 217A.1	 THERE was a troop of merry gentlemen
 	 Was riding atween twa knows,
 	 And they heard the voice of a bonny lass,
 	 In a bught milking her ews.
 217A.2	 Theres ane o them lighted frae off his steed,
 	 And has tyd him to a tree,
 	 And hes gane away to yon ew-bught,
 	 To hear what it might be.
 217A.3	 O pity me, fair maid, he said,
 	 Take pity upon me;
 	 O pity me, and my milk-white steed
 	 Thats trembling at yon tree.
 217A.4	 As for your steed, he shall not want
 	 The best of corn and hay;
 	 But as to you yoursel, kind sir,
 	 Ive naething for to say.
 217A.5	 Hes taen her by the milk-white hand,
 	 And by the green gown-sleeve,
 	 And he as led her into the ew-bught,
 	 Of her friends he speerd nae leave.
 217A.6	 He as put his hand in his pocket,
 	 And given her guineas three:
 	 If I dinna come back in half a year,
 	 Then luke nae mair for me.
 217A.7	 Now show to me the kings hie street,
 	 Now show to me the way;
 	 Now show to me the kings hie street,
 	 And the fair water of Tay.
 217A.8	 She showd to him the kings hie street,
 	 She showd to him the way;
 	 She showd him the way that he was to go,
 	 By the fair water of Tay.
 217A.9	 When she came home, her father said,
 	 Come, tell to me right plain;
 	 I doubt youve met some in the way,
 	 You have not been your lain.
 217A.10	 The night it is baith mist and mirk,
 	 You may gan out and see;
 	 The night is mirk and misty too,
 	 Theres nae body been wi me.
 217A.11	 There was a tod came to your flock,
 	 The like I neer did see;
 	 When he spake, he lifted his hat,
 	 He had a bonny twinkling eee.
 217A.12	 When fifteen weeks were past and gane,
 	 Full fifteen weeks and three,
 	 Then she began to think it lang
 	 For the man wi the twinkling eee.
 217A.13	 It fell out on a certain day,
 	 When she cawd out her fathers ky,
 	 There was a troop of gentlemen
 	 Came merrily riding by.
 217A.14	 Weel may ye sigh and sob, says ane,
 	 Weel may you sigh and see;
 	 Weel may you sigh, and say, fair maid,
 	 Whas gotten this bairn wi thee?
 217A.15	 She turned her sel then quickly about,
 	 And thinking meikle shame,
 	 O no, kind sir, it is na sae,
 	 For it has a dad at hame.
 217A.16	 O hawd your tongue, my bonny lass,
 	 Sae loud as I hear you lee!
 	 For dinna you mind that summer night
 	 I was in the bught wi thee?
 217A.17	 He lighted off his milk-white steed,
 	 And set this fair maid on;
 	 Now caw out your ky, good father, he said,
 	 Shell neer caw them out again.
 217A.18	 I am the laird of Knottington,
 	 Ive fifty plows and three;
 	 Ive gotten now the bonniest lass
 	 That is in the hale country.

 217B.1	 IT was on an evning sae saft and sae clear
 	 A bonny lass was milking the kye,
 	 And by came a troup of gentlemen,
 	 And rode the bonny lassie by.
 217B.2	 Then one of them said unto her,
 	 Bonny lass, prythee shew me the way:
 	 O if I do sae, it may breed me wae,
 	 For langer I dare nae stay.
 	 * * * * *
 217B.3	 But dark and misty was the night
 	 Before the bonny lass came hame:
 	 Now where hae you been, my ae doughter?
 	 I am sure you was nae your lane.
 217B.4	 O father, a tod has come oer your lamb,
 	 A gentleman of high degree,
 	 And ay whan he spake he lifted his hat,
 	 And bonny, bonny blinkit his ee.
 217B.5	 Or eer six months were past and gane,
 	 Six months but and other three,
 	 The lassie begud for to fret and to frown,
 	 And think lang for his blinkin ee.
 217B.6	 O wae be to my fathers shepherd,
 	 An ill death may he die!
 	 He bigged the bughts sae far frae hame,
 	 And trysted a gentleman to me!
 217B.7	 It fell upon another fair evening
 	 The bonny lassie was milking her ky,
 	 And by came the troop of Gentlemen,
 	 And rode the bonny lassie by.
 217B.8	 Then one of them stopt, and said to her,
 	 Whaes aught that baby ye are wi?
 	 That lassie began for to blush, and think,
 	 To a father as good as ye.
 217B.9	 O had your tongue, my bonny may,
 	 Sae loud I hear you lie!
 	 O dinnae you mind the misty night
 	 I was in the bught with thee?
 217B.10	 Now hes come aff his milk-white steed,
 	 And he has taen her hame:
 	 Now let your father bring hame the ky,
 	 You neer mair shall ca them agen.
 217B.11	 I am a lord of castles and towers,
 	 With fifty ploughs of land and three,
 	 And I have gotten the bonniest lass
 	 That is in this countrie.

 	 O haud ye ont again,
 	 For, if ye haud on the kings hieway,
 	 Rank rievers will do ye na harm.
 217C.4	 He took her by the milk-white hand,
 	 And by the gerss-green sleeve,
 	 And he has taiglet wi the fair may,
 	 And of her he askd na leave.
 217C.5	 Whan ance he got her gudwill,

 	 But he poud out a ribbon frae his pouch,
 	 And snooded up the mays hair.
 217C.6	 He put his hand into his pouch,
 	 And gave her guineas three:
 	 If I come na back in twenty weeks,
 	 Ye need na look mair for me.
 217C.7	 But whan the may did gang hame,
 	 Her father did her blame;
 	 Whare hae ye been now, dame? he said
 	 For yeve na been your lane.
 217C.8	 The nicht is misty and mirk, father,
 	 Ye may come to the door and see;
 	 The nicht is misty and mirk, father,
 	 And theres na body wi me.
 217C.9	 But there cam o tod to your flock, father,
 	 The like o him I never saw;
 	 Or he had tane the lambie that he had,
 	 I wad rather he had tane them aw.
 217C.10	 But he seemd to be a gentleman,
 	 Or a man of some pious degree;
 	 For whanever he spak, he lifted up his hat,

 	 Sae loud as I hear ye lee!
 	 Dinna ye mind o yon misty nicht
 	 Whan I was in the bucht wi thee?

 	 And weary will ye be,
 	 Or ye get your dochter again

 	 And they rode by and by.
 217E.2	 O Ill give thee my milk-white steed,
 	 It cost me three hundred pound,
 	 If yell go to yon sheep-bught,

 	 O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom,
 	 The broom o the Cowdenknowes!
 	 And aye sae sweet as the lassie sang,
 	 In the ewe-bught, milking her ewes.
 217M.2	 And aye as she sang the greenwoods rang,
 	 Her voice was sae loud and shrill;
 	 They heard the voice of this well-fard maid
 	 At the other side o the hill.
 217M.3	 My mother she is an ill woman,
 	 And an ill woman is she;
 	 Or than she might have got some other maid
 	 To milk her ewes without me.
 217M.4	 My father was ance a landed laird,
 	 As mony mair have been;
 	 But he held on the gambling trade

 217M.5	 My father drank the brandy and beer,

 	 Kaimd down her yellow hair;
 	 Says, Fair maid, take that, keep it for my sake,
 	 Case frae me ye never get mair.

 	 And gien her guineas three;
 	 Says, Take that, fair maiden, till I return,
 	 Twill pay the nurses fee.
 217M.19	 Then he  lap on his milk-white steed,
 	 And he rade after his men,
 	 And a that they did say to him,

 217M.20	 Ive ridden east, Ive ridden west,
 	 And over the cowdenknowes,
 	 But the bonniest lass that eer I did see,
 	 Was i the ewe-bught, milking her ewes.
 217M.21	 Shes taen her milk-pail on her head,
 	 And she gaed singing hame;

 	 And they woudna bught in for me.
 217M.23	 . . . .
 	 . . . .
 	 Before that hed taen the lamb that he took,
 	 I rather hed taen other three.
 217M.24	 When twenty weeks were come and gane,
 	 And twenty weeks and three,
 	 The lassies colour grew pale and wan,
 	 And she longed this knight to see.
 217M.25	 Says, Wae to the fox came amo our flock!
 	 I wish he had taen them a
 	 Before that hed taen frae me what he took;
 	 Its occasiond my downfa.
 217M.26	 It fell ance upon a time

 	 And they wyled the bonny lassie by.
 217M.27	 But one o them spake as he rode past,
 	 Says, Who owes the bairn ye are wi?

 	 Perhaps to ane as gude as thee.
 217M.28	 O then she did blush as he did pass by,
 	 And dear! but she thought shame,
 	 And all that she did say to him,
 	 Sir, I have a husband at hame.
 217M.29	 Ye lie, ye lie, ye well-fard maid,
 	 Sae loud as I hear you lie!
 	 For dinna ye mind yon misty night,
 	 Ye were in the bught wi me?
 	 O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom,
 	 The broom o the Cowdenknowes!
 	 Aye sae sweet as I heard you sing,
 	 In the ewe-bughts, milking your ewes.
 217M.30	 O well do I mind, kind sir, she said,
 	 As ye rode over the hill;
 	 Ye took frae me my maidenhead,
 	 Fell sair against my will.
 	 O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom,
 	 The broom o the Cowdenknowes!
 	 And aye sae sair as I rue the day
 	 I met you, milking my ewes.
 217M.31	 And aye as ye spake, ye lifted your hat,
 	 Ye had a merry winking ee;
 	 I ken you well to be the man,
 	 Then kind sir, O pity me!
 217M.32	 Win up, win up, fair maiden, he said,

 	 This night yese be my wedded wife,

 217M.33	 He lighted aff his milk-white steed
 	 And set the lassie on;
 	 Ca in your kye, auld man, he did say,
 	 Shell never ca them in again.

 217M.35	 Then he stript her o the robes o grey,

 	 At her daddie speird na leave.
 217N.5	 Now she has hame to her father gane,
 	 Her father did her blame:
 	 O whare hae ye been, my ae dochter?
 	 For ye hae na been your lane.
 217N.6	 O the nicht is mirk, and very, very wet,
 	 Ye may gang to the door and see;
 	 O theres nabody been wi me, father,
 	 Theres nabody been wi me.
 217N.7	 But there cam a tod to your bucht, father,
 	 The like o him I neer saw;
 	 Afore youd gien him the lamb that he took,
 	 Yed rather hae gien them a.
 217N.8	 O wae be to my fathers sheep-hird,
 	 An ill death may he dee!
 	 For bigging the bucht sae nar the road,
 	 Let the Lochinvar to me!
 217N.9	 Shes tane her pig and her cog in her hand,
 	 And shes gane to milk the kye;
 	 But ere she was aware, the Laird o Lochinvar
 	 Cam riding in the way.
 217N.10	 O save thee, O save thee, my bonnie may!
 	 I wish ye may be sound;
 	 O save thee, O save thee, my bonnie may!
 	 What maks thy belly sae round?
 217N.11	 O she has turnd hersel round about,
 	 And she within her thoucht shame:
 	 O its nabodys wills wi me, kind sir,
 	 For I hae a gudeman o my ain.
 217N.12	 Ye lee, ye lee, my bonnie may,
 	 Weel do I ken ye lee!
 	 For dinna ye mind o the three gowd rings
 	 I gied ye o the new moneye?
 217N.13	 O weel do I mind thee, kind sir,
 	 O weel do I mind thee;
 	 For ae when ye spak ye lifted up your hat,
 	 And ye had a bonnie twinklin ee.
 217N.14	 O ye need na toil yoursel, my dear,
 	 Neither to card nor to spin;
 	 For theres ten pieces I gie unto thee;
 	 Keep them for your lying in.
 217N.15	 Now she has hame to her father gane,
 	 As fast as she could hie;
 	 And she was na weel crownd wi joy
 	 Till her auld son gat she.
 217N.16	 But shell na tell the daddie o it
 	 Till father not to mither,
 	 And shell na tell the daddie o it
 	 To sister nor to brither.
 217N.17	 And word is to the Lochinvar,
 	 And word is to him gane,
 	 That sic a tenants dochter
 	 Has born a bastard son:
 217N.18	 And shell na tell the daddie o it
 	 To father nor to mither,
 	 And shell na tell the daddie o it
 	 Till sister nor to brither.
 217N.19	 O weel do I ken the reason o that,
 	 And the reason weel do I ken;
 	 O weel ken I the reason o that;
 	 Its to some o her fathers men.
 217N.20	 But I will awa to Littlejohns house,
 	 Shule them out o the door;
 	 For theres na tenant on a my land
 	 Shall harbour an arrant hure.
 217N.21	 Then out and spak the house-keeper,
 	 Yed better lat her abee;
 	 For an onie harm befa this may,
 	 A the wyte will be on me.
 217N.22	 O he has turnd himsel round about,
 	 Within himsel thoucht he
 	 Better do I loe her little finger
 	 Than a thy haill bodie.
 217N.23	 Gae saddle to me my six coach-mares,
 	 Put a their harness on,
 	 And I will awa to Littlejohns house
 	 For reports o this bastard son.
 217N.24	 Now whan he cam to Littlejohns house,
 	 Littlejohn was at the door:
 	 Ye rascal, ye rogue, ye impudent dog,
 	 Will ye harbour an arrant hure!
 217N.25	 O pardon me, my sovereign liege,
 	 O pardon me, I pray;
 	 Oh that the nicht that she was born
 	 Shed deed the very neist day!
 217N.26	 But he is in to his bonnie lassie gane,
 	 And has bolted the door behind,
 	 And there he has kissd his bonnie lassie sweet,
 	 Its over and over again.
 217N.27	 Ye did weel, ye did weel, my bonnie may,
 	 To keep the secret twixt me and thee;
 	 For I am the laird o the Ochilberry swair,
 	 The lady o t Ill mak thee.
 217N.28	 Come doun, come duun, now gentlemen a,
 	 And set this fair lady on;
 	 Mither, ye may milk the ewes as ye will,
 	 For shell neer milk them again.
 217N.29	 For I am the laird o the Ochilberry swair,
 	 O thirty plows and three,
 	 And I hae gotten the bonniest may
 	 Thats in a the south countrie.
