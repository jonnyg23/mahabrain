 <pre>
 
 47A.1	RRrrTWAS on a night, an evening bright,
 	When the dew began to fa,
 	Lady Margaret was walking up and down,
 	Looking oer her castle wa.
 47A.2	She looked east and she looked west,
 	To see what she could spy,
 	When a gallant knight came in her sight,
 	And to the gate drew nigh.
 47A.3	You seem to be no gentleman,
 	You wear your boots so wide;
 	But you seem to be some cunning hunter,
 	You wear the horn so syde.
 47A.4	I am no cunning hunter, he said,
 	Nor neer intend to be;
 	But I am come to this castle
 	To seek the love of thee.
 	And if you do not grant me love,
 	This night for thee Ill die.
 47A.5	If you should die for me, sir knight,
 	Theres few for you will meane;
 	For mony a better has died for me,
 	Whose graves are growing green.
 47A.6	[But ye maun read my riddle, she said,
 	And answer my questions three;
 	And but ye read them right, she said,
 	Gae stretch ye out and die.]
 47A.7	Now what is the flower, the ae first flower,
 	Springs either on moor or dale?
 	And what is the bird, the bonnie bonnie bird,
 	Sings on the evening gale?
 47A.8	The primrose is the ae first flower
 	Springs either on moor or dale,
 	And the thristlecock is the bonniest bird
 	Sings on the evening gale.
 47A.9	[But whats the little coin, she said,
 	Wald buy my castle bound?
 	And whats the little boat, she said,
 	Can sail the world all round?]
 47A.10	O hey, how mony small pennies
 	Make thrice three thousand pound?
 	Or hey, how mony salt fishes
 	Swim a the salt sea round?
 47A.11	I think you maun be my match, she said,
 	My match and something mair;
 	You are the first eer got the grant
 	Of love frae my fathers heir.
 47A.12	My father was lord of nine castles,
 	My mother lady of three;
 	My father was lord of nine castles,
 	And theres nane to heir but me.
 47A.13	And round about a thae castles
 	You may baith plow and saw,
 	And on the fifteenth day of May
 	The meadows they will maw.
 47A.14	O hald your tongue, Lady Margaret, he said,
 	For loud I hear you lie;
 	Your father was lord of nine castles,
 	Your mother was lady of three;
 	Your father was lord of nine castles,
 	But ye fa heir to but three.
 47A.15	And round about a thae castles
 	You may baith plow and saw,
 	But on the fifteenth day of May
 	The meadows will not maw.
 47A.16	I am your brother Willie, he said,
 	I trow ye ken na me;
 	I came to humble your haughty heart,
 	Has gard sae mony die.
 47A.17	If ye be my brother Willie, she said,
 	As I trow weel ye be,
 	This night Ill neither eat nor drink,
 	But gae alang wi thee.
 47A.18	O hold your tongue, Lady Margaret, he said,
 	Again I hear you lie;
 	For yeve unwashen hands and yeve unwashen feet,
 	To gae to clay wi me.
 47A.19	For the wee worms are my bedfellows,
 	And cauld clay is my sheets,
 	And when the stormy winds do blow,
 	My body lies and sleeps.

 	Appeard in a ladys hall,
 	As she was walking up and down,
 	Looking oer her castle wall.
 47B.2	God make you safe and free, fair maid,
 	God make you safe and free!
 	O sae fa you, ye courteous knight,
 	What are your wills wi me?
 47B.3	My wills wi you are not sma, lady,
 	My wills wi you nae sma,
 	And since theres nane your bower within,
 	Yese hae my secrets a.
 47B.4	For here am I a courtier,
 	A courtier come to thee,
 	And if ye winna grant your love,
 	All for your sake Ill dee.
 47B.5	If that ye dee for me, sir knight,
 	Few for you will make meen;
 	For mony gude lords done the same,
 	Their graves are growing green.
 47B.6	O winna ye pity me, fair maid,
 	O winna ye pity me?
 	O winna ye pity a courteous knight,
 	Whose love is laid on thee?
 47B.7	Ye say ye are a courteous knight,
 	But I think ye are nane;
 	I think yere but a millar bred,
 	By the colour o your claithing.
 47B.8	You seem to be some false young man,
 	You wear your hat sae wide;
 	You seem to be some false young man,
 	You wear your boots sae side.
 47B.9	Indeed I am a courteous knight,
 	And of great pedigree;
 	Nae knight did mair for a lady bright
 	Than I will do for thee.
 47B.10	O Ill put smiths in your smithy,
 	To shoe for you a steed,
 	And Ill put tailors in your bower,
 	To make for you a weed.
 47B.11	I will put cooks in your kitchen,
 	And butlers in your ha,
 	And on the tap o yourn fathers castle
 	Ill big gude corn and saw.
 47B.12	If ye be a courteous knight,
 	As I trust not ye be,
 	Yell answer some o the sma questions
 	That I will ask at thee.
 47B.13	What is the fairest flower, tell me,
 	That grows in mire or dale?
 	Likewise, which is the sweetest bird
 	Sings next the nightingale?
 	Or whats the finest thing, she says,
 	That king or queen can wile?
 47B.14	The primrose is the fairest flower
 	That grows in mire or dale;
 	The mavis is the sweetest bird
 	Next to the nightingale;
 	And yellow gowds the finest thing
 	That king or queen can wale.
 47B.15	Ye hae asked many questions, lady,
 	Ive you as many told;
 	But how many pennies round
 	Make a hundred pounds in gold?
 47B.16	How many of the small fishes
 	Do swim the salt seas round?
 	Or whats the seemliest sight youll see
 	Into a May morning?
 	* * * * *
 47B.17	Berry-brown ale and a birken speal,
 	And wine in a horn green;
 	A milk-white lace in a fair maids dress
 	Looks gay in a May morning.
 47B.18	Monys the questions Ive askd at thee,
 	And yeve answerd them a;
 	Ye are mine, and I am thine,
 	Amo the sheets sae sma.
 47B.19	You may be my match, kind sir,
 	You may be my match and more;
 	There neer was ane came sic a length
 	Wi my fathers heir before.
 47B.20	My fathers lord o nine castles,
 	My mother shes lady ower three,
 	And there is nane to heir them all,
 	No never a ane but me;
 	Unless it be Willie, my ae brother,
 	But hes far ayont the sea.
 47B.21	If your fathers laird o nine castles,
 	Your mother lady ower three,
 	I am Willie your ae brother,
 	Was far beyond the sea.
 47B.22	If ye be Willie, my ae brother,
 	As I doubt sair ye be,
 	But if its true ye tell me now,
 	This night Ill gang wi thee.
 47B.23	Yeve ower ill washen feet, Janet,
 	And ower ill washen hands,
 	And ower coarse robes on your body,
 	Alang wi me to gang.
 47B.24	The worms they are my bed-fellows,
 	And the cauld clay my sheet,
 	And the higher that the wind does blaw,
 	The sounder I do sleep.
 47B.25	My bodys buried in Dumfermline,
 	And far beyond the sea,
 	But day nor night nae rest coud get,
 	All for the pride o thee.
 47B.26	Leave aff your pride, jelly Janet, he says,
 	Use it not ony mair;
 	Or when ye come where I hae been
 	You will repent it sair.
 47B.27	Cast aff, cast aff, sister, he says,
 	The gowd lace frae your crown;
 	For if ye gang where I hae been,
 	Yell wear it laigher down.
 47B.28	When yere in the gude church set,
 	The gowd pins in your hair,
 	Ye take mair delight in your feckless dress
 	Than ye do in your morning prayer.
 47B.29	And when ye walk in the church-yard,
 	And in your dress are seen,
 	There is nae lady that sees your face
 	But wishes your grave were green.
 47B.30	Youre straight and tall, handsome withall,
 	But your pride owergoes your wit,
 	But if ye do not your ways refrain,
 	In Piries chair yell sit.
 47B.31	In Piries chair youll sit, I say,
 	The lowest seat o hell;
 	If ye do not amend your ways,
 	Its there that ye must dwell.
 47B.32	Wi that he vanishd frae her sight,
 	Wi the twinkling o an eye;
 	Naething mair the lady saw
 	But the gloomy clouds and sky.

 	Ask on, ask on, lady, he said,
 	What may your asking be?
 47C.7	Whats the first thing in flower, she said,

 	Or what is the finest thing, she says,
 	That king or queen can wile?
 47C.8	The primrose is the first in flower
 	That springs in mire or dale;
 	The thristle-throat is the next that sings

 	Ive you as many told;
 	But how many pennies round

 	When he is fighting keen.

 	You may be my match and more;
 	There neer was one came such a length

 	Your mothers lady of three;
 47C.14	Your fathers heir of nine castles,
 	And you are heir to three;
 	For I am William, thy ae brother,
 	That died beyond the sea.
 47C.15	If ye be William, my ae brother,
 	This night, O well is me!
 	If ye be William, my ae brother,
 	This night Ill go with thee.
 47C.16	For no, for no, jelly Janet, he says,
 	For no, that cannot be;
 	Youve oer foul feet and ill washen hands
 	To be in my company.

 	And the cold clay is my sheet,
 	And the higher that the winds do blow,
 	The sounder I do sleep.
 47C.18	Leave off your pride, jelly Janet, he says,
 	Use it not any more;
 	Or when you come where I have been
 	You will repent it sore.
 47C.19	When you go in at yon church door,
 	The red gold on your hair,
 	More will look at your yellow locks
 	Than look on the Lords prayer.
 47C.20	When you go in at yon church door,
 	The red gold on your crown;
 	When you come where I have been,
 	Youll wear it laigher down.
 47C.21	The jolly hind squire, he went away
 	In the twinkling of an eye,
 	Left the lady sorrowful behind,
 	With many bitter cry.
