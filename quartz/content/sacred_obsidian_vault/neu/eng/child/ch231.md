 <h1 align="CENTER">231A: The Earl of Errol</h1>
 <pre>
 
 231A.1	 THERE was a jury sat at Perth,
 	 In the merry month of May,
 	 Betwixt the noble Duke of Perth
 	 But and Sir Gilbert Hay.
 231A.2	 My lord Kingside has two daughters,
 	 They are proper, straight and tall;
 	 But my lord Carnegie he has two
 	 That far excells them all.
 231A.3	 Then Errol he has dressd him,
 	 As very well he could;
 	 Im sure there was not one cloth-yard
 	 But what was trimmed with gold.
 231A.4	 Ane asking, ane asking, my lord Carnegie,
 	 Ane asking Ive to thee;
 	 Im come to court your daughter Jean,
 	 My wedded wife to be.
 231A.5	 My daughter Jean was wed yestreen,
 	 To one of high degree,
 	 But where Jean got one guinea of gold
 	 With Kate Ill give thee three.
 231A.6	 Full fifteen hundred pounds
 	 Had Jean Carnegie,
 	 But three fifteen hundred pounds
 	 With Kate Ill gie to thee.
 231A.7	 Then Errol he has wed her,
 	 And fairly brought her hame;
 	 There was nae peace between them twa
 	 Till they sundered oer again.
 231A.8	 When bells were rung, and mess was sung,
 	 And a man bound to bed,
 	 The Earl of Errol and his countess
 	 In one chamber was laid.
 231A.9	 Early in the morning
 	 My lord Carnegie rose,
 	 The Earl of Errol and his countess,
 	 And theyve put on their clothes.
 231A.10	 Up spake my lord Carnegie;
 	 Kate, is your toucher won?
 	 Ye may ask the Earl of Errol,
 	 If he be your good-son.
 231A.11	 What need I wash my petticoat
 	 And hing it on a pin?
 	 For I am as leal a maid yet
 	 As yestreen when I lay down.
 231A.12	 What need I wash my apron
 	 And hing it on the door?
 	 Its baith side and wide enough,
 	 Hangs even down before.
 231A.13	 Up spake my lord Carnegie;
 	 O Kate, what do ye think?
 	 Well beguile the Earl of Errol
 	 As lang as hes in drink.
 231A.14	 O what will ye beguile him wi?
 	 Or what will ye do than?
 	 Ill swear before a justice-court
 	 That hes no a sufficient man.
 231A.15	 Then Errol he cam down the stair,
 	 As bold as oney rae:
 	 Go saddle to me my Irish coach,
 	 To Edinbro Ill go.
 231A.16	 When he came to Edinbro,
 	 He lighted on the green;
 	 There were four-and-twenty maidens
 	 A dancing in a ring.
 231A.17	 There were four-and-twenty maidens
 	 A dancing in a row;
 	 The fatest and the fairest
 	 To bed wi him must go.
 231A.18	 Hes taen his Peggy by the hand,
 	 And he led her thro the green,
 	 And twenty times he kissd her there,
 	 Before his ain wifes een.
 231A.19	 Hes taen his Peggy by the hand,
 	 And hes led her thro the hall,
 	 And twenty times hes kissd her there,
 	 Before his nobles all.
 231A.20	 Look up, look up, my Peggy lass,
 	 Look up, and think nae shame;
 	 Ten hundred pounds Ill gie to you
 	 To bear to me a son.
 231A.21	 Hes keepit his Peggy in his room
 	 Three quarter of a year,
 	 And just at the nine months end
 	 She a son to him did bear.
 231A.22	 Now if ye be Kate Carnegie,
 	 And I Sir Gilbert Hay,
 	 Ill make your father sell his lands
 	 Your toucher for to pay.
 231A.23	 To make my father sell his lands,
 	 It wad be a great sin,
 	 To toucher oney John Sheephead
 	 That canna toucher win.
 231A.24	 Now hold your tongue, ye whorish bitch,
 	 Sae loud as I hear ye lie!
 	 For yonder sits Lord Errols son,
 	 Upon his mothers knee;
 	 For yonder sits Lord Errols son,
 	 Altho hes no by thee.
 231A.25	 You may take hame your daughter Kate,
 	 And set her on the glen;
 	 For Errol canna please her,
 	 Nor nane o Errols men;
 	 For Errol canna please her,
 	 Nor twenty of his men.
 231A.26	 The ranting and the roving,
 	 The thing we a do ken,
 	 The lady lost her right that night,
 	 The first night she lay down;
 	 And the thing we ca the ranting o t,
 	 The lady lies her lane.

 	 For the pearting . . .
 	 Lady Earell lyes her lane.
 231B.2	 Earell is a bonny place,

 231B.8	 Little did Lord Earell think,
 	 Whan he sat down to dine,
 	 That his lady was on to Edinburgh,
 	 Nor what was in her mind.
 231B.9	 Till his best servant came
 	 For to lat him ken

 231B.12	 As lang as they ca ye Kate Carnegie,

 231B.13	 For to gar my father sell Kinnaird,

 231C.1	 ERROLL its a bonny place,
 	 It stands upon a plain;
 	 A bad report this ladies raisd,
 	 That Erroll is nae a man.
 231C.2	 But it fell ance upon a day
 	 Lord Erroll went frae hame,
 	 And he is on to the hunting gane,
 	 Single man alane.
 231C.3	 But he hadna been frae the town
 	 A mile but barely twa,
 	 Till his lady is on to Edinburgh,
 	 To gain him at the law.
 231C.4	 O Erroll he kent little o that
 	 Till he sat down to dine,
 	 And as he was at dinner set
 	 His servant loot him ken.
 231C.5	 Now saddle to me the black, the black,
 	 Go saddle to me the brown,
 	 And I will on to Edinburgh,
 	 Her errands there to ken.
 231C.6	 She wasna well thro Aberdeen,
 	 Nor passd the well o Spa,
 	 Till Erroll he was after her,
 	 The verity to shaw.
 231C.7	 She wasna well in edinburgh,
 	 Nor even thro the town,
 	 Till Erroll he was after her,
 	 Her errands there to ken.
 231C.8	 When he came to the court-house,
 	 And lighted on the green,
 	 This lord was there in time enough
 	 To hear her thus compleen:
 231C.9	 What needs me wash my apron,
 	 Or drie t upon a door?
 	 What needs I eek my petticoat,
 	 Hings even down afore?
 231C.10	 What needs me wash my apron,
 	 Or hing it upon a pin?
 	 For lang will gang but and ben
 	 Or I hear my young sons din.
 231C.11	 They ca you Kate Carnegie, he says,
 	 And my names Gilbert Hay;
 	 Ill gar your father sell his land,
 	 Your tocher down to pay.
 231C.12	 To gar my father sell his land
 	 For that would be a sin,
 	 To such a noughtless heir as you,
 	 That canno get a son.
 231C.13	 Then out it speaks him Lord Brechen,
 	 The best an lord ava;
 	 I never saw a lady come
 	 Wi sic matters to the law.
 231C.14	 Then out it speaks another lord,
 	 The best in a the town;
 	 Yell wyle out fifeteen maidens bright
 	 Before Lord Erroll come:
 	 And he has chosen a tapster lass,
 	 And Meggie was her name.
 231C.15	 They kept up this fair maiden
 	 Three quarters of a year,
 	 And then at that three quarters end
 	 A young son she did bear.
 231C.16	 They hae gien to Meggie then
 	 Five ploughs but and a mill,
 	 And they hae gien her five hundred pounds,
 	 For to bring up her chill.
 231C.17	 There was no lord in Edinburgh
 	 But to Meggie gae a ring;
 	 And there was na a boy in a the town
 	 But on Katie had a sang.
 231C.18	 Kinnaird, take hame your daughter,
 	 And set her to the glen,
 	 For Erroll canna pleasure her,
 	 Nor nane o Errolls men.
 231C.19	 Seven years on Errolls table
 	 There stand clean dish and speen,
 	 And every day the bell is rung,
 	 Cries, Lady, come and dine.

 	 The thing they ca the danting o t,

 231D.2	 O Errols place is a bonny place,
 	 It stands upon yon plain;
 	 But whats the use of Errols place?
 	 Hes no like other men.
 231D.3	 As I cam in by yon canal,
 	 And by yon bowling-green,
 	 I might hae pleased the best Carnegy
 	 That ever bore that name.
 231D.4	 As sure s your name is Kate Carnegy,
 	 And mine is Gibbie Hay,
 	 Ill gar your father sell his land,
 	 Your tocher for to pay.
 231D.5	 To gar my father sell his land,
 	 Would it not be a sin,

 	 And Errol he has followed her,

 231D.7	 Then out it spake her sister,
 	 Whose name was Lady Jane;
 	 Had I been Lady Errol, she says,

 231E.7	 As thou was Kate Carnegie,

 231E.8	 Now he may take her back again,
 	 Do wi her what he can,
 	 For Errol canna please her,

 231E.9	 Go fetch to me a pint of wine,
