 7A.1	OH did ye ever hear o brave Earl Bran?
       Refrain:	Ay lally, o lilly lally
 	He courted the kings daughter of fair England.
       Refrain:	All i the night sae early
 7A.2	She was scarcely fifteen years of age
 	Till sae boldly she came to his bedside.
 7A.3	O Earl Bran, fain wad I see
 	A pack of hounds let loose on the lea.
 7A.4	O lady, I have no steeds but one,
 	And thou shalt ride, and I will run.
 7A.5	O Earl Bran, my father has two,
 	And thou shall have the best o them a.
 7A.6	They have ridden oer moss and moor,
 	And they met neither rich nor poor.
 7A.7	Until they met with old Carl Hood;
 	He comes for ill, but never for good.
 7A.8	Earl Bran, if ye love me,
 	Seize this old carl, and gar him die.
 7A.9	O lady fair, it wad be sair,
 	To slay an old man that has grey hair.
 7A.10	O lady fair, Ill no do sae;
 	Ill gie him a pound, and let him gae.
 7A.11	O where hae ye ridden this lee lang day?
 	Or where hae ye stolen this lady away?
 7A.12	I have not ridden this lee lang day.
 	Nor yet have I stolen this lady away.
 7A.13	She is my only, my sick sister,
 	Whom I have brought from Winchester.
 7A.14	If she be sick, and like to dead,
 	Why wears she the ribbon sae red?
 7A.15	If she be sick, and like to die,
 	Then why wears she the gold on high?
 7A.16	When he came to his ladys gate,
 	Sae rudely as he rapped at it.
 7A.17	O wheres the lady o this ha?
 	Shes out with her maids to play at the ba.
 7A.18	Ha, ha, ha! ye are a mistaen:
 	Gae count your maidens oer again.
 7A.19	I saw her far beyond the moor,
 	Away to be the Earl o Brans whore.
 7A.20	The father armed fifteen of his best men,
 	To bring his daughter back again.
 7A.21	Oer her left shoulder the lady looked then:
 	O Earl Bran, we both are tane.
 7A.22	If they come on me ane by ane,
 	Ye may stand by and see them slain.
 7A.23	But if they come on me one and all,
 	Ye may stand by and see me fall.
 7A.24	They have come on him ane by ane,
 	And he has killed them all but ane.
 7A.25	And that ane came behind his back,
 	And hes gien him a deadly whack.
 7A.26	But for a sae wounded as Earl Bran was,
 	He has set his lady on her horse.
 7A.27	They rode till they came to the water o Doune,
 	And then he alighted to wash his wounds.
 7A.28	O Earl Bran, I see your hearts blood!
 	Tis but the gleat o my scarlet hood.
 7A.29	They rode till they came to his mothers gate,
 	And sae rudely as he rapped at it.
 7A.30	O my sons slain, my sons put down,
 	And a for the sake of an English loun.
 7A.31	O say not sae, my dear mother,
 	But marry her to my youngest brother.
 	* * * * *
 7A.32	This has not been the death o ane,
 	But its been that of fair seventeen.

 7B.1	RISE up, rise up, now, Lord Douglas, she says,
 	And put on your armour so bright;
 	Let it never be said that a daughter of thine
 	Was married to a lord under night.
 7B.2	Rise up, rise up, my seven bold sons,
 	And put on your armour so bright,
 	And take better care of your youngest sister,
 	For your eldests awa the last night.
 7B.3	Hes mounted her on a milk-white steed,
 	And himself on a dapple grey,
 	With a bugelet horn hung down by his side,
 	And lightly they rode away.
 7B.4	Lord William lookit oer his left shoulder,
 	To see what he could see,
 	And there he spyd her seven brethren bold,
 	Come riding over the lee.
 7B.5	Light down, light down, Lady Margret, he said,
 	And hold my steed in your hand,
 	Until that against your seven brethren bold,
 	And your father, I mak a stand.
 7B.6	She held his steed in her milk-white hand,
 	And never shed one tear,
 	Until that she saw her seven brethren fa,
 	And her father hard fighting, who lovd her so dear.
 7B.7	O hold your hand, Lord William! she said,
 	For your strokes they are wondrous sair;
 	True lovers I can get many a ane,
 	But a father I can never get mair.
 7B.8	O shes taen out her handkerchief,
 	It was o the holland sae fine,
 	And aye she dighted her fathers bloody wounds,
 	That were redder than the wine.
 7B.9	O chuse, O chuse, Lady Margret, he said,
 	O whether will ye gang or bide?
 	Ill gang, Ill gang, Lord William, she said,
 	For ye have left me no other guide.
 7B.10	Hes lifted her on a milk-white steed,
 	And himself on a dapple grey,
 	With a bugelet horn hung down by his side,
 	And slowly they baith rade away.
 7B.11	O they rade on, and on they rade,
 	And a by the light of the moon,
 	Until they came to yon wan water,
 	And there they lighted down.
 7B.12	They lighted down to tak a drink
 	Of the spring that ran sae clear,
 	And down the stream ran his gude hearts blood,
 	And sair she gan to fear.
 7B.13	Hold up, hold up, Lord William, she says,
 	For I fear that you are slain;
 	Tis naething but the shadow of my scarlet cloak,
 	That shines in the water sae plain.
 7B.14	O they rade on, and on they rade,
 	And a by the light of the moon,
 	Until they cam to his mothers ha door,
 	And there they lighted down.
 7B.15	Get up, get up, lady mother, he says,
 	Get up, and let me in!
 	Get up, get up, lady mother, he says,
 	For this night my fair lady Ive win.
 7B.16	O mak my bed, lady mother, he says,
 	O mak it braid and deep,
 	And lay Lady Margret close at my back,
 	And the sounder I will sleep.
 7B.17	Lord William was dead lang ere midnight,
 	Lady Margret lang ere day,
 	And all true lovers that go thegither,
 	May they have mair luck than they!
 7B.18	Lord William was buried in St. Marys kirk,
 	Lady Margret in Marys quire;
 	Out o the ladys grave grew a bonny red rose,
 	And out o the knights a briar.
 7B.19	And they twa met, and they twa plat,
 	And fain they wad be near;
 	And a the warld might ken right weel
 	They were twa lovers dear.
 7B.20	But bye and rade the Black Douglas,
 	And wow but he was rough!
 	For he pulld up the bonny brier,
 	And flangt in St. Marys Loch.

 7C.1	RISE up, rise up, my seven brave sons,
 	And dress in your armour so bright;
 	Earl Douglas will hae Lady Margaret awa
 	Before that it be light.
 7C.2	Arise, arise, my seven brave sons,
 	And dress in your armour so bright;
 	It shall never be said that a daughter of mine
 	Shall go with an earl or a knight.
 7C.3	O will ye stand, fair Margaret, he says,
 	And hold my milk-white steed,
 	Till I fight your father and seven brethren,
 	In yonder pleasant mead?
 7C.4	She stood and held his milk-white steed,
 	She stood trembling with fear,
 	Until she saw her seven brethren fall,
 	And her father that loved her dear.
 7C.5	Hold your hand, Earl Douglas, she says,
 	Your strokes are wonderous sair;
 	I may get sweethearts again enew,
 	But a father Ill neer get mair.
 7C.6	She took  out a handkerchief
 	Was made o the cambrick fine,
 	And aye she wiped her fathers bloody wounds,
 	And the blood sprung up like wine.
 7C.7	Will ye go, fair Margaret? he said,
 	Will ye now go, or bide?
 	Yes, Ill go, sweet William, she said,
 	For yeve left me never a guide.
 7C.8	If I were to go to my mothers house,
 	A welcome guest I would be;
 	But for the bloody deed thats done this day
 	Ill rather go with thee.
 7C.9	He lifted her on a milk-white steed
 	And himself on a dapple gray;
 	They drew their hats out over their face,
 	And they both went weeping away.
 7C.10	They rode, they rode, and they better rode,
 	Till they came to yon water wan;
 	They lighted down to gie their horse a drink
 	Out of the running stream.
 7C.11	I am afraid, Earl Douglas, she said,
 	I am afraid ye are slain;
 	I think I see your bonny hearts blood
 	Running down the water wan.
 7C.12	Oh no, oh no, fair Margaret, he said,
 	Oh no, I am not slain;
 	It is but the scad of my scarlet cloak
 	Runs down the water wan.
 7C.13	He mounted her on a milk-white steed
 	And himself on a dapple gray,
 	And they have reached Earl Douglas gates
 	Before the break of day.
 7C.14	O rise, dear mother, and make my bed,
 	And make it braid and wide,
 	And lay me down to take my rest,
 	And at my back my bride.
 7C.15	She has risen and made his bed,
 	She made it braid and wide;
 	She laid him down to take his rest,
 	And at his back his bride.
 7C.16	Lord William died ere it was day,
 	Lady Margaret on the morrow;
 	Lord William died through loss of blood and wounds,
 	Fair Margaret died with sorrow.
 7C.17	The one was buried in Marys kirk,
 	The other in Marys quire;
 	The one sprung up a bonnie bush,
 	And the other a bonny brier.
 7C.18	These twa grew, and these twa threw,
 	Till they came to the top,
 	And when they could na farther gae,
 	They coost the lovers knot.

 	Two chooses Ill make thee;
 	Whether to go back to your mother again,
 	Or go along with me.
 7D.8	For to go home to my mother again,
 	An unwelcome guest Id be;
 	But since my fate has ordered it so,
 	Ill go along with thee.
 7D.9	He has mounted her on a milk-white steed,
 	Himself on the dapple gray,
 	And blawn his horn baith loud and shill,
 	And it sounded far on their way.
 7D.10	They rode oer hill, they rode oer dale,
 	They rode oer mountains so high,
 	Until they came to that beautiful place
 	Where Sir Williams mother did lie.
 7D.11	Rise up, rise up, lady mother, he said,
 	Rise up, and make much o your own;
 	Rise up, rise up, lady mother, he said,
 	For his brides just new come home.
 7D.12	Sir Willian he died in the middle o the night,
 	Lady Margaret died on the morrow;
 	Sir William he died of pure pure love,
 	Lady Margaret of grief and sorrow.

 7[I.7]	She took out a handkerchief of holland so fine
 	And wipd her fathers bloody wound,
 	Which ran more clear than the red wine,
 	And forked on the cold ground.
 7[I.8]	O chuse you, chuse you, Margret, he said,
 	Whether you will go or bide!
 	I must go with you, Lord William, she said,
 	Since youve left me no other guide.
 7[I.9]	He lifted her on a milk-white steed,
 	And himself on a dapple grey,
 	With a blue gilded horn hanging by his side,
 	And they slowly both rode away.
 7[I.10]	Away they rode, and better they rode,
 	Till they came to yonder sand,
 	Till once they came to yon river side,
 	And ther they lighted down.
 7[I.11]	They lighted down to take a drink
 	Of the spring that ran so clear,
 	And there she spyd his bonny hearts blood,
 	A running down the stream.
 7[I.12]	Hold up, hold up, Lord William, she says,
 	For I fear that you are slain;
 	Tis nought but the shade of my scarlet clothes,
 	That is sparkling down the stream.
 7[I.13]	He lifted her on a milk-white steed,
 	And himself on a dapple grey,
 	With a blue gilded horn hanging by his side,
 	And slowly they rode away.
 7[I.14]	Ay they rode, and better they rode,
 	Till they came to his mothers bower;
 	Till once they came to his mothers bower,
 	And down they lighted there.
 7[I.15]	O mother, mother, make my bed,
 	And make it saft and fine,
 	And lay my lady close at my back,
 	That I may sleep most sound.
 7[I.16]	Lord William he died eer middle o the night,
 	Lady Margret long before the morrow;
 	Lord William he died for pure true love,
 	And Lady Margret died for sorrow.
 7[I.17]	Lord William was buryd in Lady Marys kirk,
 	The other in Saint Marys quire;
 	Out of Williams grave sprang a red rose,
 	And out of Margrets a briar.
 7[I.18]	And ay they grew, and ay they threw,
 	As they wad fain been near;
 	And by this you may ken right well
 	They were twa lovers dear.
