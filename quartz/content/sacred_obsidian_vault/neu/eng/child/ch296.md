 <h1 align="CENTER">296A: Walter Lesly</h1>
 <pre>
 
 296A.1	 On the second of October, a Monday at noon,
 	 In came Walter Lesly, to see his proper one;
 	 He sent a chair down by her side, and gently sat her by,
 	 Says, Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?
 296A.2	 Hes taen a glass into his hand, inviting her to drink,
 	 But little knew she his meaning, or what the rogue did think;
 	 Nor what the rogue did think, to steal the maid away;
 	 Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?
 296A.3	 When they had taen a glass or two, and all were making merry,
 	 In came Geordy Lesly, and forth he did her carry;
 	 Then upon high horseback sae hards he did her tye,
 	 Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?
 296A.4	 Her mother she came to the door, the saut tears on her cheek,
 	 She coudna see her daughter, it was for dust and reek;
 	 It was for dust and reek, the swords they glancd sae high;
 	 And will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?
 296A.5	 When they came to the ale-house, the people there were busy;
 	 A bridal-bed it was well made, and supper well made ready;
 	 When the supper down was set, baith plum-pudding and pie,
 	 And will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?
 296A.6	 When they had eaten and well drunken, and a man bound for bed,
 	 The laddie and the lassie in ae chamber were laid;
 	 He quickly stript her to the smock, and gently laid her bye,
 	 Says, Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?
 296A.7	 But Walter being weary, he fell fast asleep,
 	 And then the lassie thought it fit to start up till her feet;
 	 To start up till her feet, and her petticoats to tye,
 	 Well go no more to Conland, the winter-time to lye.
 296A.8	 Then over moss and over muir sae cleverly she ran,
 	 And over hill and over dale, without stockings or shoon;
 	 The men pursued her full fast, wi mony shout and cry,
 	 Says, Will ye go to Conland, the winter-time to lye.
 296A.9	 Wae to the dubs o Duffus land, that eer they were sae deep;
 	 Theyve trachled a our horsemen and gart our captain sleep;
 	 And gart our captain sleep, and the lassie win away,
 	 And shell go no more to Conland, the winter-time to lye.
 296A.10	 Id rather be in Duffus land, selling at the ale,
 	 Before I was wi Lesly, for a his auld meal;
 	 For a his auld meal, and sae mony comes to buy;
 	 Ill go no more to Conland the winter-time to lye.
 296A.11	 Id rather be in Duffus land, draggin at the ware,
 	 Before I was wi Lesly, for a his yellow hair;
 	 For a his yellow hair, and sae wells he can it tye;
 	 Ill go no more to Conland, this winter-time to lye.
 296A.12	 It was not for her beauty, nor yet her gentle bluid,
 	 But for her mithers dollars, of them he had great need;
 	 Of them he had great need, now he maun do them by,
 	 For shell go no more to Conland, this winter-time to lye.
