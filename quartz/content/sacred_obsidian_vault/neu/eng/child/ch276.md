 <h1 align="CENTER">276A: The Friar in the Well</h1>
 <pre>
 
 276A.1	 As I lay musing all alone,
 	 fa, la, la, la, la
 	 A pretty jeast I thought upon;
 	 fa, la, la, la, la
 	 Then listen a while, and I will you tell
 	 Of a fryer that loved a bonny lass well.
 	 fa, la, la, la, la
 	 fa, la, la, lang-tre-down-dilly
 276A.2	 He came to the maid when she went to bed,
 	 Desiring to have her maidenhead,
 	 But she deny d his desire,
 	 And told him that she feard hell-fire.
 276A.3	 Tush, quoth the fryer, Thou needst not doubt
 	 If thou wert in hell I could sing thee out:
 	 Then, quoth the maid, Thou shalt have thy request;
 	 The fryer was glad as a fox in his nest.
 276A.4	 But one thing, quoth she, I do desire,
 	 Before you have what you require;
 	 Before that you shall do the thing,
 	 An angel of mony thou shalt me bring.
 276A.5	 Tush, quoth the fryer, we shall agree,
 	 No mony shall part my love and me;
 	 Before that I will see thee lack,
 	 Ile pawn the grey gown from my back.
 276A.6	 The maid bethought her of a wile
 	 How she the fryer might bequile;
 	 While he was gone, the truth to tell,
 	 She hung a cloth before the well.
 276A.7	 The fryer came, as his covenant was,
 	 With money to his bonny lass;
 	 Good morrow, fair maid! Good morrow! quoth she.
 	 Here is the mony I promised thee.
 276A.8	 thankt the man, and she took his mony:
 	 Now let us go to t, quoth he, Sweet hony:
 	 O stay, quoth she, Some respite make,
 	 My father comes, he will me take.
 276A.9	 Alas! quoth the fryer, where shall I run,
 	 To hide me till that he be gone?
 	 Behinde the cloath run thou, quoth she,
 	 And there my father cannot thee see.
 276A.10	 Behind the cloath the fryer crept,
 	 And into the well on the sudden he leapt;
 	 Alas, quoth he, i am in the well!
 	 No matter, quoth she, if thou wert in hell.
 276A.11	 Thou sayst thou couldst sing me out of hell,
 	 Now prithee sing thy self out of the well:
 	 The fryer sung with a pittiful sound,
 	 Oh help me out, or I shall be dround!
 276A.12	 I trow, quoth she, your courage is coold.
 	 Quoth the fryer, I was never so foold,
 	 I never was serv d so before.
 	 Then take heed, quoth she, Thou comst there no more.
 276A.13	 Quoth he, For sweet Saint Francis sake
 	 On his disciple some pitty take:
 	 Quoth she, Saint Francis never taught
 	 His scholars to tempt young maids to naught.
 276A.14	 The fryer did entreat her still
 	 That she should help him out of the well;
 	 She heard him make such pittious moan
 	 She helpd him out, and bid him be gone.
 276A.15	 Quoth he, Shall I have my mony again,
 	 Which thou from me hast beforehand tane?
 	 Good sir, said she, Theres no such matter;
 	 Ile make you pay for fouling my water.
 276A.16	 The fryer went all along the street,
 	 Droping wet, like a new-washd sheep;
 	 Both old and young commended the maid
 	 That such a witty prank had plaid.

 <h3 align="CENTER">276B: The Friar in the Well</h3>
 <pre>
 
 276B.1	 O HEARKEN and hear, and I will you tell
 	 Sing, Faldidae, faldidadi
 	 Of a friar that loved a fair maiden well.
 	 Sing, Faldi dadi di di (bis)
 276B.2	 The friar he came to this maidens bedside,
 	 And asking for her maidenhead.
 276B.3	 O I would grant you your desire,
 	 If twerena for fear o hells burning fire.
 276B.4	 O hells burning fire ye need have no doubt;
 	 Altho you were in, I could whistle you out.
 276B.5	 O if I grant to you this thing,
 	 Some money you unto me must bring.
 276B.6	 He brought her the money, and did it down tell;
 	 She had a white cloth spread over the well.
 276B.7	 Then the fair maid cried out that her master was come;
 	 O, said the friar, Then where shall I run?
 276B.8	 O ye will go in behind yon screen,
 	 And then by my master ye winna be seen.
 276B.9	 n in behind the screen she him sent.
 	 But he fell into the well by accident.
 276B.10	 Then the friar cried out with a piteous moan,
 	 O help! O help me! or else I am gone.
 276B.11	 Ye said ye wad whistle me out o hell;
 	 Now whistle your ain sel out o the well.
 276B.12	 She helped him out and bade him be gone;
 	 The friar he asked his money again.
 276B.13	 As for your money, there is no much matter
 	 To make you pay more for jumbling our water.
 276B.14	 Then all who hear it commend this fair maid
 	 For the nimble trick to the friar she played.
 276B.15	 friar he walked on the street,
 	 And shaking his lugs like a well-washen sheep.
