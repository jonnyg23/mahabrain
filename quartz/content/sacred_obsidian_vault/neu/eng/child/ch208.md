 <pre>
 
 208A.1	 OUR king has wrote a lang letter,
 	 And sealed it owre with gold;
 	 He sent to my lord Dunwaters,
 	 To read it if he could.
 208A.2	 He has not sent it with a boy, with a boy,
 	 Nor with anie Scotch lord;
 	 But hes sent it with the noblest knight
 	 Eer Scotland could afford.
 208A.3	 The very first line that my lord did read,
 	 He gave a smirkling smile;
 	 Before he had the half ot read,
 	 The tears from his eyes did fall.
 208A.4	 Come saddle to me my horse, he said,
 	 Come saddle to me with speed;
 	 For I must away to fair London town,
 	 For me was neer more need.
 208A.5	 Out and spoke his lady gay,
 	 In child-bed where she lay:
 	 I would have you make your will, my lord Dunwaters,
 	 Before you go away.
 208A.6	 I leave to you, my eldest son,
 	 My houses and my land;
 	 I leave to you, my second son,
 	 Ten thousand pounds in hand.
 208A.7	 I leave to you, my lady gay-+--+-
 	 You are my wedded wife-+--+-
 	 I leave to you, the third of my estate;
 	 Thatll keep you in a ladys life.
 208A.8	 They had not rode a mile but one,
 	 Till his horse fell owre a stane:
 	 Its warning gude eneuch, my lord Dunwaters said,
 	 Alive Ill neer come hame.
 208A.9	 When they came into fair London town,
 	 Into the courtiers hall,
 	 The lords and knichts in fair London town
 	 Did him a traitor call.
 208A.10	 A traitor! a traitor! says my lord,
 	 A traitor! how can that be,
 	 An it was na for the keeping of five thousand men
 	 To fight for King Jamie?
 208A.11	 O all you lords and knichts in fair London town,
 	 Come out and see me die;
 	 O all you lords and knichts into fair London town,
 	 Be kind to my ladie.
 208A.12	 Theres fifty pounds in my richt pocket,
 	 Divide it to the poor;
 	 Theres other fifty pounds in my left pocket,
 	 Divide it from door to door.

 	 And he sealed it up with gold,
 	 And he sent it to Lord Derwentwater,
 	 For to read it if he could.
 208B.2	 The first two lines that he did read,
 	 They made him for to smile;
 	 But the next two lines he looked upon
 	 Made the tears from his eyes to fall.
 208B.3	 Oh, then cried out his lady fair,
 	 As she in child-bed lay,
 	 Make your will, make your will, Lord Derwentwater,
 	 Before that you go away.
 208B.4	 Then heres for thee, my lady fair,
 	 . . . .
 	 A thousand pounds of beaten gold,
 	 To lead you a ladys life.
 208B.5	 . . . .
 	 . .  his milk-white steed,
 	 The ring dropt from his little finger,
 	 And his nose it began to bleed.
 208B.6	 He rode, and he rode, and he rode along,
 	 Till he came to Westminster Hall,
 	 Where all the lords of Englands court
 	 A traitor did him call.
 208B.7	 Oh, why am I a traitor? said he;
 	 Indeed, I am no such thing;
 	 I have fought the battles valiantly
 	 Of James, our noble king.
 208B.8	 O then stood up an old gray-headed man,
 	 With a pole-axe in his hand:
 	 Tis your head, tis your head, Lord Derwentwater,
 	 Tis your head that I demand.
 208B.9	 . . . .
 	 His eyes with weeping sore,
 	 He laid his head upon the block,
 	 And words spake never more.

 208E.1	 THE king wrote a letter to my lord Derwentwater,
 	 And he sealed it with gold;
 	 He sent it to my Lord Derwentwater,
 	 To read it if he could.
 208E.2	 He sent it by no boy,
 	 He sent it by no slave,
 	 But he sent it by as true a knight
 	 As heart could wish or have.
 208E.3	 The very first line that he looked upon
 	 Made him for to laugh and to smile;
 	 The very next line that he looked upon,
 	 The tears from his eyes did fall.
 208E.4	 He called to his stable-boy
 	 To saddle his bonny grey steed,
 	 That I unto loving London
 	 May ride away with speed.
 208E.5	 His wife heard him say so,
 	 In childbed as she lay;
 	 Says she, My lord Derwentwater,
 	 Make thy will before thou goest away.
 208E.6	 Its to my little son I give
 	 My houses and my land,
 	 And to my little daughter
 	 Ten thousand pounds in hand.
 208E.7	 And unto thee, my lady gay,
 	 Who is my wedded wife,
 	 The third part of my estate thou shalt have,
 	 To maintain thee through thy life.
 208E.8	 He set his foot in the level stirrup,
 	 And mounted his bonny grey steed;
 	 The gold rings from his fingers did break,
 	 And his nose began for to bleed.
 208E.9	 He had not ridden past a mile or two,
 	 When his horse stumbled over a stone;
 	 These are tokens enough, said my lord Derwentwater,
 	 That I shall never return.
 208E.10	 He rode and he rode till he came to merry London,
 	 And near to that famous hall;
 	 The lords and knights of merry London,

 	 To read and understand.
 208F.2	 Now he has sent it by no boy,
 	 No boy, nor yet a slave,
 	 But one of Englands fairest knights,
 	 The one that he would have.
 208F.3	 When first he on the letter lookd,
 	 Then he began to smile;
 	 But ere he read it to an end,
 	 The tears did trickling fall.
 208F.4	 He calld upon his saddle-groom
 	 To saddle his milk-white steed,
 	 For I unto London must go,
 	 For me there is much need.
 208F.5	 Out then speaks his gay lady,
 	 In child-bed where she lay:
 	 Make your will, make your will, my knight,
 	 For fear ye rue the day.
 208F.6	 Ill leave unto my eldest son

 	 To maintain a ladys life.
 208F.8	 He kissd her on the pillow soft,
 	 In child-bed where she lay,
 	 And bade farewell, neer to return,
 	 Unto his lady gay.
 208F.9	 He put his foot in the stirup,
 	 His nose began to bleed;
 	 The ring from s finger burst in two
 	 When he mounted on his steed.
 208F.10	 He had not rode a mile or two
 	 Till his horse stumbled down;
 	 A token good, said Lord Arnwaters,
 	 Ill never reach London town.
 208F.11	 But when into Westminster Hall,
 	 Amongst the nobles all,
 	 A traitor, a traitor, Lord Arnwaters,
 	 A traitor, they did him call.
 208F.12	 A traitor? a traitor how call ye me?
 	 And a traitor how can I be
 	 For keeping seven thousand valiant men
 	 To fight for  brave Jamie?
 208F.13	 Up then came a brave old man,
 	 With a broad ax in his hand:
 	 Your life, your life, Lord Arnwaters,
 	 Your lifes at my command.
 208F.14	 My life, my life, my brave old man,
 	 My life Ill give to thee,
 	 And the coat of green thats on my back
 	 You shall have for your fee.
 208F.15	 Theres fifty pounds in one pocket,
 	 Pray dealt among the poor;
 	 Theres fifty and four in the other pocket,
 	 Pray dealt from door to door.
 208F.16	 Theres one thing more I have to say,
 	 This day before I die;
 	 To beg the lords and nobles all
 	 To be kind to my lady.

 208H.8	 He had not gone but half a mile
 	 When it began to rain;
 	 Now this is a token, his lordship said,

 208H.9	 When he unto London came,

 <h3 align="CENTER">208I: Lord Dernwentwater</h3>
 <pre>
 
 208I.1	 KING GEORGE he did a letter write,
 	 And sealed it up with gold,
 	 And sent it to Lord Derwentwater,
 	 To read it if he could.
 208I.2	 He sent his letter by no post,
 	 He sent it by no page,
 	 But sent it by a gallant knight
 	 As eer did combat wage.
 208I.3	 The first line that my lord lookd on
 	 Struck him with strong surprise;
 	 The second, more alarming still,
 	 Made tears fall from his eyes.
 208I.4	 He called up his stable-groom,
 	 Saying, Saddle me well my steed,
 	 For I must up to London go,
 	 Of me there seems great need.
 208I.5	 His lady, hearing what he said,
 	 As she in child-bed lay,
 	 Cryd, My dear lord, pray make your will
 	 Before you go away.
 208I.6	 Ill leave to thee, my eldest son,
 	 My houses and my land;
 	 Ill leave to thee, my younger son,
 	 Ten thousand pounds in hand.
 208I.7	 Ill leave to thee, my lady gay,
 	 My lawful married wife,
 	 A third part of my whole estate,
 	 To keep thee a ladys life.
 208I.8	 He knelt him down by her bed-side,
 	 And kissed her lips so sweet;
 	 The words that passd, alas! presaged
 	 They never more should meet.
 208I.9	 Again he calld his stable-groom,
 	 Saying, Bring me out my steed,
 	 For I must up to London go,
 	 With instant haste and speed.
 208I.10	 He took the reins into his hand,
 	 Which shook with fear and dread;
 	 The rings from off his fingers dropt,
 	 His nose gushd out and bled.
 208I.11	 He had but ridden miles two or three
 	 When stumbling fell his steed;
 	 Ill omens these, Derwentwater said,
 	 That I for James must bleed.
 208I.12	 As he rode up Westminster street,
 	 In sight of the White Hall,
 	 The lords and ladies of London town
 	 A traitor they did him call.
 208I.13	 A traitor! Lord Derwentwater said,
 	 A traitor how can I be,
 	 Unless for keeping five hundred men
 	 Fighting for King Jemmy?
 208I.14	 Then started forth a grave old man,
 	 With a broad-mouthd axe in hand:
 	 Thy head, thy head, Lord Derwentwater,
 	 Thy heads at my command.
 208I.15	 My head, my head, thou grave old man,
 	 My head I will give thee;
 	 Heres a coat of velvet on my back
 	 Will surely pay thy fee.
 208I.16	 But give me leave, Derwentwater said,
 	 To speak words two or three;
 	 Ye lords and ladies of London town,
 	 Be kind to my lady.
 208I.17	 Heres a purse of fifty sterling pounds,
 	 Pray give it to the poor;
 	 Heres one of forty-five beside
 	 You may dole from door to door.
 208I.18	 He laid his head upon the block,
 	 The axe was sharp and strong,
 	 . . . .
