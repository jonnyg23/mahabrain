 <pre>
 
 241A.1	 THE Laird of Leys is on to Edinbrugh,
 	 To shaw a fit o his follie;
 	 He drest himsel in the crimson-brown,
 	 An he provd a rantin laddie.
 241A.2	 Ben came a weel-faird lass,
 	 Says, Laddie, how do they ca ye?
 	 They ca me this, an they ca me that,
 	 Ye wudna ken fat they ca me;
 	 But whan Im at home on bonnie Deeside
 	 They ca me The Rantin Laddie.
 241A.3	 They sought her up, they sought her down,
 	 They sought her in the parlour;
 	 She couldna be got but whar she was,
 	 In the bed wi The Rantin Laddie.
 241A.4	 Tell me, tell me, Baron of Leys,
 	 Ye tell me how they ca ye!
 	 Your gentle blood moves in my side,
 	 An I dinna ken how they ca ye.
 241A.5	 They ca me this, an they ca me that,
 	 Ye couldna ken how they ca me;
 	 But whan Im at home on bonnie Deeside
 	 They ca me The Rantin Laddie.
 241A.6	 Tell me, tell me, Baron of Leys,
 	 Ye tell mo how they ca ye!
 	 Your gentle blood moves in my side,
 	 An I dinna ken how to ca ye.
 241A.7	 Baron of Leys, it is my stile,
 	 Alexander Burnett they ca me;
 	 Whan Im at hame on bonnie Deeside
 	 My name is The Rantin Laddie.
 241A.8	 Gin your name be Alexander Burnett,
 	 Alas that ever I saw ye!
 	 For ye hae a wife and bairns at hame,
 	 An alas for lyin sae near ye!
 241A.9	 But Ise gar ye be headit or hangt,
 	 Or marry me the morn,
 	 Or else pay down ten thousand crowns
 	 For giein o me the scorn.
 241A.10	 For my head, I canna want;
 	 I love my lady dearly;
 	 But some o my lands I maun lose in the case,
 	 Alas for lyin sae near ye!
 241A.11	 Word has gane to the Lady of Leys
 	 That the laird he had a bairn;
 	 The warst word she said to that was,
 	 I wish I had it in my arms.
 241A.12	 For I will sell my jointure-lands-+--+-
 	 I am broken an Im sorry-+--+-
 	 An Ill sell a, to my silk gowns,
 	 An get hame my rantin laddie.

 <h3 align="CENTER">241B: The Baron o Leys</h3>
 <pre>
 
 241B.1	 THE Laird o Leys is to London gane;
 	 He was baith full and gawdie;
 	 For he shod his steed wi siller guid,
 	 And hes playd the ranting laddie.
 241B.2	 He hadna been in fair London
 	 A twalmonth and a quarter,
 	 Till he met wi a weel-faurd may,
 	 Wha wishd to know how they cad him.
 241B.3	 They ca me this, and they ca me that,
 	 And theyre easy how theyve cad me;
 	 But whan Im at hame on bonnie Deeside
 	 They ca me The Ranting Laddie.
 241B.4	 Awa wi your jesting, sir, she said,
 	 I trow youre a ranting laddie;
 	 But something swells atween my sides,
 	 And I maun ken how they ca thee.
 241B.5	 They ca me this, and they ca me that,
 	 And theyre easy how they ca me;
 	 The Baron o Leys my title is,
 	 And Sandy Burnet they ca me.
 241B.6	 Tell down, tell down ten thousand crowns,
 	 Or ye maun marry me the morn;
 	 Or headit of hangit ye sall be,
 	 For ye sanna gie me the scorn.
 241B.7	 My heads the thing I canna weel want;
 	 My lady she loves me dearlie;
 	 Nor yet hae I means ye to maintain;
 	 Alas for the lying sae near thee!
 241B.8	 But words gane doun to the Lady o Leys
 	 That the Baron had got a babie:
 	 The waurst o news! my lady she said,
 	 I wish I had hame my laddie.
 241B.9	 But Ill sell aff my jointure-house,
 	 Tho na mair I sud be a ladie;
 	 Ill sell a to my silken goun,
 	 And bring hame my rantin laddie.
 241B.10	 So she is on to London gane,
 	 And she paid the money on the morn;
 	 She paid it doun and brought him hame,
 	 And gien them a the scorn.

 	 Till he gat a lady wi bairn.
 241C.2	 But it fell ance upon a day
 	 The lady mournd fu sairlie;
 	 Says, Whos the man has me betrayed?
 	 It gars me wonder and fairlie.
 241C.3	 Then to the fields to him she went,
 	 Saying, Tell me what they ca thee;
 	 Or else Ill mourn and rue the day,
 	 Crying, alas that ever I saw thee!
 241C.4	 Some cas me this, some cas me that,
 	 I carena fat befa me;
 	 For when Im at the schools o France
 	 An awkward fellow they ca me.
 241C.5	 Waes me now, ye awkward fellow,
 	 And alas that ever I saw thee!
 	 Wi you Im in love, sick, sick in love,
 	 And I kenna well fat they ca thee.
 241C.6	 Some cas me this, some cas me that,
 	 What name does best befa me;
 	 For when I walk in Edinburgh streets
 	 The Curling Buckle they ca me.
 241C.7	 O waes me now, O Curling Buckle,
 	 And alas that ever I saw thee!
 	 For Im in love, sick, sick in love,
 	 And I kenna well fat they ca thee.

 	 But when Im in Scotlands kings high court
 	 Clatter the Speens they ca me.

 	 I carena what they ca me;
 	 But when wi the Earl o Murray I ride
 	 Its Scour the Brass they ca me.
 241C.11	 O waes me now, O Scour the Brass,
 	 And alas that ever I saw thee!
 	 For Im in love, sick, sick in love,
 	 Amd I kenna well fat to ca thee.

 	 Whatever name best befas me;
 	 But when I walk thro Saint Johnstones town
 	 George Burnett they ca me.
 241C.13	 O waes me, O waes me, George Burnett,
 	 And alas that ever I saw thee!
 	 For Im in love, sick, sick in love,
 	 And I kenna well fat to ca thee.

 	 Whatever name best befas me;
 	 But when I am on bonny Dee side
 	 The Baron o Leys they ca me.
 241C.15	 O weal is me now, O Baron o Leys,
 	 This day that ever I saw thee!
 	 Theres gentle blood within my sides,
 	 And now [I] ken fat they ca thee.
 241C.16	 But yell pay down ten thousand crowns,
 	 Or marry me the morn;
 	 Else Ill cause you be headed or hangd
 	 For gieing me the scorn.
 241C.17	 My head is a thing I cannot well want;
 	 My lady loves me sae dearly;
 	 But Ill deal the gold right liberally
 	 For lying ae night sae near thee.
 241C.18	 When word had gane to the Lady o Leys
 	 The baron had gotten a bairn,
 	 She clapped her hands, and this did say,
 	 I wish he were in my arms!
 241C.19	 O weal is me now, O Baron o Leys,
 	 For ye hae pleased me sairly;
 	 Frae our house is banishd the vile reproach
 	 That disturbed us late and early.
 241C.20	 When she looked ower her castle-wa,
 	 To view the woods sae rarely,
 	 There she spied the Baron o Leys
 	 Ride on his steed sae rarely.
 241C.21	 Then forth she went her baron to meet,
 	 Says, Yere welcome to me, fairly!
 	 Yese hae spice-cakes, and seed-cakes sweet,
 	 And claret to drink sae rarely.
