 <h1 align="CENTER">295A: The Brown Girl</h1>
 <pre>
 
 295A.1	 I am as brown as brown can be,
 	 My eyes as black as a sloe;
 	 I am as brisk as a nightingale,
 	 And as wilde as any doe.
 295A.2	 My love has sent me a love-letter,
 	 Not far from yonder town,
 	 That he could not fancy me,
 	 Because I was so brown.
 295A.3	 I sent him his letter back again,
 	 For his love I valud not,
 	 Whether that he could fancy me
 	 Or whether he could not.
 295A.4	 He sent me his letter back again,
 	 That he lay dangerous sick,
 	 That I might then go speedily
 	 To give him up his faith.
 295A.5	 Now you shall hear what love she had
 	 Then for this love-sick man;
 	 She was a whole long summers day
 	 In a mile a going on.
 295A.6	 When she came to her loves bed-side,
 	 Where he lay dangerous sick,
 	 She could not for laughing stand
 	 Upright upon her feet.
 295A.7	 She had a white wand all in her hand,
 	 And smoothd it all on his breast;
 	 In faith and troth come pardon me,
 	 I hope your souls at rest.
 295A.8	 Ill do as much for my true-love
 	 As other maidens may;
 	 Ill dance and sing on my loves grave
 	 A whole twelvemonth and a day.

 <h3 align="CENTER">295B: The Brown Girl</h3>
 <pre>
 
 295B.1	 I am as brown as brown can be,
 	 And my eyes as black as sloe;
 	 I am as brisk as brisk can be,
 	 And wild as forest doe.
 295B.2	 My love he was so high and proud,
 	 His fortune too so high,
 	 He for another fair pretty maid
 	 Me left and passed me by.
 295B.3	 Me did he send a love-letter,
 	 He sent it from the town,
 	 Saying no more he loved me,
 	 For that I was so brown.
 295B.4	 I sent his letter back again,
 	 Saying his love I valued not,
 	 Whether that he would fancy me,
 	 Whether that he would not.
 295B.5	 When that six months were overpassd,
 	 Were overpassd and gone,
 	 Then did my lover, once so bold,
 	 Lie on his bed and groan.
 295B.6	 When that six months were overpassd,
 	 Were gone and overpassd,
 	 O then my lover, once so bold,
 	 With love was sick at last.
 295B.7	 First sent he for the doctor-man:
 	 You, doctor, me must cure;
 	 The pains that now do torture me
 	 I can not long endure.
 295B.8	 Next did he send from out the town,
 	 O next did send for me;
 	 He sent for me, the brown, brown girl
 	 Who once his wife should be.
 295B.9	 O neer a bit the doctor-man
 	 His sufferings could relieve;
 	 O never an one but the brown, brown girl
 	 Who could his life reprieve.
 295B.10	 Now you shall hear what love she had
 	 For this poor love-sick man,
 	 How all one day, a summers day,
 	 She walked and never ran.
 295B.11	 When that she came to his bedside,
 	 Where he lay sick and weak,
 	 O then for laughing she could not stand
 	 Upright upon her feet.
 295B.12	 You flouted me, you scouted me,
 	 And many another one;
 	 Now the reward is come at last,
 	 For all that you have done.
 295B.13	 The rings she took from off her hands,
 	 The rings by two and three:
 	 O take, O take these golden rings,
 	 By them remember me.
 295B.14	 She had a white wand in her hand,
 	 She strake him on the breast:
 	 My faith and troth I give back to thee,
 	 So may thy soul have rest.
 295B.15	 Prithee, said he, Forget, forget,
 	 Prithee forget, forgive;
 	 O grant me yet a little space,
 	 That I may be well and live.
 295B.16	 O never will I forget, forgive,
 	 So long as I have breath;
 	 Ill dance above your green, green grave
 	 Where you do lie beneath.
