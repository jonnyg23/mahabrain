 	 And words gane to the ha,
 	 That Marie Hamilton gangs wi bairn
 	 To the hichest Stewart of a.
 173A.2	 Hes courted her in the kitchen,
 	 Hes courted her in the ha,
 	 Hes courted her in the laigh cellar,
 	 And that was warst of a.
 173A.3	 Shes tyed it in her apron
 	 And shes thrown it in the sea;
 	 Says, Sink ye, swim ye, bonny wee babe!
 	 Youl neer get mair o me.
 173A.4	 Down them cam the auld queen,
 	 Goud tassels tying her hair:
 	 O marie, wheres the bonny wee babe
 	 That I heard greet sae sair?
 173A.5	 There never was a babe intill my room,
 	 As little designs to be;
 	 It was but a touch o my sair side,
 	 Come oer my fair bodie.
 173A.6	 O Marie, put on your robes o black,
 	 Or else your robes o brown,
 	 For ye maun gang wi me the night,
 	 To see fair Edinbro town.
 173A.7	 I winna put on my robes o black,
 	 Nor yet my robes o brown;
 	 But Ill put on my robes o white,
 	 To shine through Edinbro town.
 173A.8	 When she gaed up the Cannogate,
 	 She laughd loud laughters three;
 	 But whan she cam down the Cannogate
 	 The tear blinded her ee.
 173A.9	 When she gaed up the Parliament stair,
 	 The heel cam aff her shee;
 	 And lang or she cam down again
 	 She was condemnd to dee.
 173A.10	 When she cam down the Cannogate,
 	 The Cannogate sae free,
 	 Many a ladie lookd oer her window,
 	 Weeping for this ladie.
 173A.11	 Ye need nae weep for me, she says,
 	 Ye need nae weep for me;
 	 For had I not slain mine own sweet babe,
 	 This death I wadna dee.
 173A.12	 Bring me a bottle of wine, she says,
 	 The best that eer ye hae,
 	 That I may drink to my weil-wishers,
 	 And they may drink to me.
 173A.13	 Heres a health to the jolly sailors,
 	 That sail upon the main;
 	 Let them never let on to my father and mother
 	 But what Im coming hame.
 173A.14	 Heres a health to the jolly sailors,
 	 That sail upon the sea;
 	 Let them never let on to my father and mother
 	 That I cam here to dee.
 173A.15	 Oh little did my mother think,
 	 The day she cradled me,
 	 What lands I was to travel through,
 	 What death I was to dee.
 173A.16	 Oh little did my father think,
 	 The day he held up me,
 	 What lands I was to travel through,
 	 What death I was to dee.
 173A.17	 Last night I washd the queens feet,
 	 And gently laid her down;
 	 And a the thanks Ive gotten the nicht
 	 To be hangd in Edinbro town!
 173A.18	 Last nicht there was four Maries,
 	 The nicht therel be but three;
 	 There was Marie Seton, and Marie Beton,
 	 And Marie Carmichael, and me.

 173C.1	 THERE lived a lord into the west,
 	 And he had dochters three,
 	 And the youngest o them is to the kings court,
 	 To learn some courtesie.
 173C.2	 She was not in the kings court
 	 A twelvemonth and a day,
 	 Till she was neither able to sit nor gang,
 	 Wi the gaining o some play.
 173C.3	 She went to the garden,
 	 To pull the leaf aff the tree,
 	 To tak this bonnie babe frae her breast,
 	 But alas it would na do!
 173C.4	 She rowed it in her handkerchief,
 	 And threw it in the sea:
 	 O sink ye, swim ye, wee wee babe!
 	 Yell get nae mair o me.
 173C.5	 Word is to the kitchen gane,
 	 And word is to the ha,
 	 That Mary Myle she goes wi child
 	 To the highest Steward of a.
 173C.6	 Down and came the queen hersell,
 	 The queen hersell so free:
 	 O mary Myle, whare is the child
 	 That I heard weep for thee?
 173C.7	 O hold your tongue now, Queen, she says,
 	 O hold your tongue so free!
 	 For it was but a shower o the sharp sickness,
 	 I was almost like to die.
 173C.8	 O busk ye, busk ye, Mary Myle,
 	 O busk, and go wi me;
 	 O busk ye, busk ye, Mary Mile,
 	 Its Edinburgh town to see.
 173C.9	 Ill no put on my robes o black,
 	 No nor yet my robes [o] brown;
 	 But Ill put on my golden weed,

 173C.10	 When she went up the Cannongate-side,
 	 The Cannongate-side so free,
 	 Oh there she spied some ministers lads,
 	 Crying Och and alace for me!
 173C.11	 Dinna cry och and alace for me!
 	 Dinna cry o[c]h and alace for me!
 	 For its all for the sake of my innocent babe
 	 That I come here to die.

 	 Before that she came down again,
 	 She was condemned to die.
 173C.13	 O all you gallant sailors,
 	 That sail upon the sea,
 	 Let neither my father nor mother know
 	 The death I am to die!
 173C.14	 O all you gallant sailors,

 	 What lands I was to travel in,
 	 What death I was to die.
 173C.16	 Little did my father know,
 	 When he held up my head,
 	 What lands I was to travel in,
 	 What was to be my deid.
 173C.17	 Yestreen I made Queen Marys bed,
 	 Kembed doun her yellow hair;
 	 Is this the reward I am to get,
 	 To tread this gallows-stair!

 173D.1	 THERE lives a knight into the north,
 	 And he had daughters three;
 	 The ane of them was a barbers wife,
 	 The other a gay ladie.
 173D.2	 And the youngest of them is to Scotland gane,
 	 The queens Mary to be,
 	 And a that they could say or do,
 	 Forbidden she woudna be.
 173D.3	 The princes bed it was sae saft,
 	 The spices they were sae fine,
 	 That out of it she couldna lye
 	 While she was scarse fifteen.
 173D.4	 Shes gane to the garden gay
 	 To pu of the savin tree;
 	 But for a that she could say or do,
 	 The babie it would not die.
 173D.5	 Shes rowed it in her handkerchief,
 	 She threw it in the sea;
 	 Says, Sink ye, swim ye, my bonnie babe!
 	 For yell get nae mair of me.
 173D.6	 Queen Mary came tripping down the stair,
 	 Wi the gold strings in her hair:
 	 O whares the little babie, she says,
 	 That I heard greet sae sair?
 173D.7	 O hold your tongue, Queen Mary, my dame,
 	 Let all those words go free!
 	 It was mysell wi a fit o the sair colic,
 	 I was sick just like to die.
 173D.8	 O hold your tongue, Mary Hamilton,
 	 Let all those words go free!
 	 O where is the little babie
 	 That I heard weep by thee?
 173D.9	 I rowed it in my handkerchief,
 	 And threw it in the sea;
 	 I bade it sink, I bade it swim,
 	 It would get nae mair o me.
 173D.10	 O wae be to thee, Marie Hamilton,
 	 And an ill deid may you die!
 	 For if ye had saved the babies life
 	 It might hae been an honour to thee.
 173D.11	 Busk ye, busk ye, Marie Hamilton,
 	 O busk ye to be a bride!
 	 For I am going to Edinburgh toun,
 	 Your gay wedding to bide.
 173D.12	 You must not put on your robes of black,
 	 Nor yet your robes of brown;
 	 But you must put on your yellow gold stuffs,
 	 To shine thro Edinburgh town.
 173D.13	 I will not put on my robes of black,
 	 Nor yet my robes of brown;
 	 But I will put on my yellow gold stuffs,
 	 To shine thro Edinburgh town,
 173D.14	 As she went up the Parliament Close,
 	 A riding on her horse,
 	 There she saw many a coblers lady,
 	 Sat greeting at the cross.
 173D.15	 O what means a this greeting?
 	 Im sure its nae for me;
 	 For Im come this day to Edinburgh town
 	 Weel wedded for to be.
 173D.16	 When she gaed up the Parliament stair,
 	 She gied loud lauchters three;
 	 But ere that she came down again,
 	 She was condemned to die.
 173D.17	 O little did my mother think,
 	 The day she prinned my gown,
 	 That I was to come sae far frae hame
 	 To be hangid in Edinburgh town.
 173D.18	 O whatll my poor father think,
 	 As he comes thro the town,
 	 To see the face of his Molly fair
 	 Hanging on the gallows-pin!
 173D.19	 Heres a health to the marineres,
 	 That plough the raging main!
 	 Let neither my mother nor father know
 	 But Im coming hame again!
 173D.20	 Heres a health to the sailors,
 	 That sail upon the sea!
 	 Let neither my mother nor father ken
 	 That I came here to die!
 173D.21	 Yestreen the queen had four Maries,
 	 This night shell hae but three;
 	 There was Mary Beaton, and Mary Seaton,
 	 And Mary Carmichael, and me.
 173D.22	 O hald your tongue, Mary Hamilton,
 	 Let all those words go free!
 	 This night eer ye be hanged
 	 Ye shall gang hame wi me.
 173D.23	 O hald your tongue, Queen Mary, my dame,
 	 Let all those words go free!
 	 For since I have come to Edinburgh toun,
 	 Its hanged I shall be,
 	 And it shall neer be said that in your court
