 <h1 align="CENTER">70A: Willie and Lady Maisry</h1>
 <pre>
 
 70A.1	WILLIE was a widows son,
 	And he wore a milk-white weed, O
 	And weel could Willie read and write,
 	Far better ride on steed. O
 70A.2	Lady Margerie was the first lady
 	That drank to him the wine,
 	And aye as the healths gade round and round,
 	Laddy, your love is mine.
 70A.3	Lady Margerie was the first ladye
 	That drank to him the beer,
 	And aye as the healths gade round and round,
 	Laddy, youre welcome here.
 70A.4	You must come into my bower
 	When the evening bells do ring,
 	And you must come into my bower
 	When the evening mass doth sing.
 70A.5	Hes taen four and twenty braid arrows,
 	And laced them in a whang,
 	And hes awa to Lady Margeries bower,
 	As fast as he can gang.
 70A.6	He set ae foot on the wall,
 	And the other on a stane,
 	And hes killed a the kings life-guards,
 	And hes killed them every man.
 70A.7	Oh open, open, Lady Margerie,
 	Open and let me in;
 	The weet weets a my yellow hair,
 	And the dew draps on my chin.
 70A.8	With her feet as white as sleet
 	She strode her bower within,
 	And with her fingers long and small
 	Shes looten Sweet Willie in.
 70A.9	Shes louten down unto her foot
 	To loose Sweet Willies shoon;
 	The buckles were sa stiff they wudna lowse,
 	The blood had frozen in.
 70A.10	O Willie, Willie, I fear that thou
 	Has bred me dule and sorrow;
 	The deed that thou has dune this nicht
 	Will kythe upon the morrow.
 70A.11	In then came her father dear,
 	And a broad sword by his gare,
 	And hes gien Willie, the widows son,
 	A deep wound and a sair.
 70A.12	Lye yont, lye yont, Willie, she says,
 	Your sweat weets a my side;
 	Lye yont, lie yont, Willie, she says,
 	For your sweat I downa bide.
 70A.13	She turned her back unto the wa,
 	Her face unto the room,
 	And there she saw her auld father,
 	Walking up and down.
 70A.14	Woe be to you, father, she said,
 	And an ill deed may you die!
 	For yeve killd Willie, the widows son
 	And he would have married me.
 70A.15	She turned her back unto the room,
 	Her face unto the wa,
 	And with a deep and heavy sich
 	Her heart it brak in twa.

 <h3 align="CENTER">70B: Willie and Lady Maisry</h3>
 <pre>
 
 70B.1	SWEET WILLIE was a widows son,
 	And milk-white was his weed;
 	It sets him weel to bridle a horse,
 	And better to saddle a steed, my dear,
 	And better to saddle a steed.
 70B.2	But he is on to Maisrys bower-door,
 	And tirled at the pin:
 	Ye sleep ye, wake ye, Lady Maisry,
 	Yell open, let me come in.
 70B.3	O who is this at my bower-door,
 	Sae well that knows my name?
 	It is your ain true-love, Willie,
 	If ye love me, lat me in.
 70B.4	Then huly, huly raise she up,
 	For fear o making din,
 	Then in her arms lang and bent,
 	She caught sweet Willie in.
 70B.5	She leand her low down to her toe,
 	To loose her true-loves sheen,
 	But cauld, cauld were the draps o bleed
 	Fell fae his trusty brand.
 70B.6	What frightfu sight is that, my love?
 	A frightfu sight to see!
 	What bluid is this on your sharp brand?
 	O may ye not tell me?
 70B.7	As I came thro the woods this night,
 	The wolf maist worried me;
 	O shoud I slain the wolf, Maisry?
 	Or shoud the wolf slain me?
 70B.8	They hadna kissd, nor love clapped,
 	As lovers when they meet,
 	Till up it starts her auld father,
 	Out o his drowsy sleep.
 70B.9	O whats become o my house-cock,
 	Sae crouse at ane did craw?
 	I wonder as much at my bold watch,
 	Thats nae shooting ower the wa.
 70B.10	My gude house-cock, my only son,
 	Heir ower my land sae free,
 	If ony ruffian hae him slain,
 	High hanged shall he be.
 70B.11	Then hes on to Maisrys bower-door,
 	And tirled at the pin:
 	Ye sleep ye, wake ye, daughter Maisry,
 	Yell open, lat me come in.
 70B.12	Between the curtains and the wa
 	She rowd her true-love then,
 	And huly went she to the door,
 	And let her father in.
 70B.13	Whats become o your maries, Maisry,
 	Your bower it looks sae teem?
 	Whats become o your green claithing,
 	Your beds they are sae thin?
 70B.14	Gude forgie you, father, she said,
 	I wish ye bet for sin;
 	Sae aft as ye hae dreaded me,
 	But never found me wrang.
 70B.15	He turnd him right and round about,
 	As hed been gaun awa;
 	But sae nimbly as he slippet in
 	Behind a screen sae sma.
 70B.16	Maisry, thinking a dangers past,
 	She to her love did say,
 	Come, love, and take your silent rest;
 	My auld fathers away.
 70B.17	Then baith lockd in each others arms,
 	They fell full fast asleep,
 	When up it starts her auld father,
 	And stood at their bed-feet.
 70B.18	I think I hae the villain now
 	That my dear son did slay;
 	But I shall be revengd on him
 	Before I see the day.
 70B.19	Then hes drawn out a trusty brand,
 	And stroakd it oer a stray,
 	And thro and thro Sweet Willies middle
 	Hes gart cauld iron gae.
 70B.20	Then up it wakend Lady Maisry,
 	Out o her drowsy sleep,
 	And when she saw her true-love slain,
 	She straight began to weep.
 70B.21	O gude forgie you now, father, she said,
 	I wish ye bet for sin;
 	For I never lovd a love but ane,
 	In my arms yeve him slain.
 70B.22	This night hes slain my gude bold watch,
 	Thirty stout men and twa;
 	Likewise hes slain your ae brother,
 	To me was worth them a.
 70B.23	If he has slain my ae brither,
 	Himsell had a the blame,
 	For mony a day he plots contrivd,
 	To hae Sweet Willie slain.
 70B.24	And tho hes slain your gude bold watch,
 	He might hae been forgien;
 	They came on him in armour bright,
 	When he was but alane.
 70B.25	Nae meen was made for this young knight,
 	In bower where he lay slain,
 	But a was for sweet Maisry bright,
 	In fields where she ran brain.
