 <pre>
 
 39A.1	O I FORBID you, maidens a,
 	That wear gowd on your hair,
 	To come or gae by Carterhaugh,
 	For young Tam Lin is there.
 39A.2	Theres nane that gaes by Carterhaugh
 	But they leave him a wad,
 	Either their rings, or green mantles,
 	Or else their maidenhead.
 39A.3	Janet has kilted her green kirtle
 	A little aboon her knee,
 	And she has broded her yellow hair
 	A little aboon her bree,
 	And shes awa to Carterhaugh,
 	As fast as she can hie.
 39A.4	When she came to Carterhaugh
 	Tam Lin was at the well,
 	And there she fand his steed standing,
 	But away was himsel.
 39A.5	She had na pud a double rose,
 	A rose but only twa,
 	Till up then started young Tam Lin,
 	Says, Lady, thous pu nae mae.
 39A.6	Why pus thou the rose, Janet,
 	And why breaks thou the wand?
 	Or why comes thou to Carterhaugh
 	Withoutten my command?
 39A.7	Carterhaugh, it is my ain,
 	My daddie gave it me;
 	Ill come and gang by Carterhaugh,
 	And ask nae leave at thee.
 	* * * * *
 39A.8	Janet has kilted her green kirtle
 	A little aboon her knee,
 	And she has snooded her yellow hair
 	A little aboon her bree,
 	And she is to her fathers ha,
 	As fast as she can hie.
 39A.9	Four and twenty ladies fair
 	Were playing at the ba,
 	And out then cam the fair Janet,
 	Ance the flower amang them a.
 39A.10	Four and twenty ladies fair
 	Were playing at the chess,
 	And out then cam the fair Janet,
 	As green as onie glass.
 39A.11	Out then spak an auld grey knight,
 	Lay oer the castle wa,
 	And says, Alas, fair Janet, for thee
 	But well be blamed a.
 39A.12	Haud your tongue, ye auld facd knight,
 	Some ill death may ye die!
 	Father my bairn on whom I will,
 	Ill father nane on thee.
 39A.13	Out then spak her father dear,
 	And he spak meek and mild;
 	And ever alas, sweet Janet, he says,
 	I think thou gaes wi child.
 39A.14	If that I gae wi child, father,
 	Mysel maun bear the blame;
 	Theres neer a laird about your ha
 	Shall get the bairns name.
 39A.15	If my love were an earthly knight,
 	As hes an elfin grey,
 	I wad na gie my ain true-love
 	For nae lord that ye hae.
 39A.16	The steed that my true-love rides on
 	Is lighter than the wind;
 	Wi siller he is shod before,
 	Wi burning gowd behind.
 39A.17	Janet has kilted her green kirtle
 	A little aboon her knee,
 	And she has snooded her yellow hair
 	A little aboon her bree,
 	And shes awa to Carterhaugh,
 	As fast as she can hie.
 39A.18	When she cam to Carterhaugh,
 	Tam Lin was at the well,
 	And there she fand his steed standing,
 	But away was himsel.
 39A.19	She has na pud a double rose,
 	A rose but only twa,
 	Till up then started young Tam Lin,
 	Says Lady, thou pus nae mae.
 39A.20	Why pus thou the rose, Janet,
 	Amang the groves sae green,
 	And a to kill the bonie babe
 	That we gat us between?
 39A.21	O tell me, tell me, Tam Lin, she says,
 	Fors sake that died on tree,
 	If eer ye was in holy chapel,
 	Or chirstendom did see?
 39A.22	Roxbrugh he was my grandfather,
 	Took me with him to bide,
 	And ance it fell upon a day
 	That wae did me betide.
 39A.23	And ance it fell upon a day,
 	A cauld day and a snell,
 	When we were frae the hunting come,
 	That frae my horse I fell;
 	The Queen o Fairies she caught me,
 	In yon green hill to dwell.
 39A.24	And pleasant is the fairy land,
 	But, an eerie tale to tell,
 	Ay at the end of seven years
 	We pay a tiend to hell;
 	I am sae fair and fu o flesh,
 	Im feard it be mysel.
 39A.25	But the night is Halloween, lady,
 	The morn is Hallowday;
 	Then win me, win me, an ye will,
 	For weel I wat ye may.
 39A.26	Just at the mirk and midnight hour
 	The fairy folk will ride,
 	And they that wad their true-love win,
 	At Miles Cross they maun bide.
 39A.27	But how shall I thee ken, Tam Lin,
 	Or how my true-love know,
 	Amang sae mony unco knights
 	The like I never saw?
 39A.28	O first let pass the black, lady,
 	And syne let pass the brown,
 	But quickly run to the milk-white steed,
 	Pu ye his rider down.
 39A.29	For Ill ride on the milk-white steed,
 	And ay nearest the town;
 	Because I was an earthly knight
 	They gie me that renown.
 39A.30	My right hand will be glovd, lady,
 	My left hand will be bare,
 	Cockt up shall my bonnet be,
 	And kaimd down shall my hair,
 	And thaes the takens I gie thee,
 	Nae doubt I will be there.
 39A.31	Theyll turn me in your arms, lady,
 	Into an esk and adder;
 	But hold me fast, and fear me not,
 	I am your bairns father.
 39A.32	Theyll turn me to a bear sae grim,
 	And then a lion bold;
 	But hold me fast, and fear me not,
 	As ye shall love your child.
 39A.33	Again theyll turn me in your arms
 	To a red het gaud of airn;
 	But hold me fast, and fear me not,
 	Ill do to you nae harm.
 39A.34	And last theyll turn me in your arms
 	Into the burning gleed;
 	Then throw me into well water,
 	O throw me in wi speed.
 39A.35	And then Ill be your ain true-love,
 	Ill turn a naked knight;
 	Then cover me wi your green mantle,
 	And cover me out o sight.
 39A.36	Gloomy, gloomy was the night,
 	And eerie was the way,
 	As fair Jenny in her green mantle
 	To Miles Cross she did gae.
 39A.37	About the middle o the night
 	She heard the bridles ring;
 	This lady was as glad at that
 	As any earthly thing.
 39A.38	First she let the black pass by,
 	And syne she let the brown;
 	But quickly she ran to the milk-white steed,
 	And pud the rider down.
 39A.39	Sae weel she minded whae he did say,
 	And young Tam Lin did win;
 	Syne coverd him wi her green mantle,
 	As blythes a bird in spring.
 39A.40	Out then spak the Queen o Fairies,
 	Out of a bush o broom:
 	Them that has gotten young Tam Lin
 	Has gotten a stately groom.
 39A.41	Out then spak the Queen o Fairies,
 	And an angry woman was she:
 	Shame betide her ill-fard face,
 	And an ill death may she die,
 	For shes taen awa the boniest knight
 	In a my companie.
 39A.42	But had I kend, Tam Lin, she says,
 	What now this night I see,
 	I wad hae taen out thy twa grey een,
 	And put in twa een o tree.

 39D.1	O ALL you ladies young and gay,
 	Who are so sweet and fair,
 	Do not go into Chasters wood,
 	For Tomlin will be there.
 39D.2	Fair Margret sat in her bonny bower,
 	Sewing her silken seam,
 	And wished to be in Chasters wood,
 	Among the leaves so green.
 39D.3	She let her seam fall to her foot,
 	The needle to her toe,
 	And she has gone to Chasters wood,
 	As fast as she could go.
 39D.4	When she began to pull the flowers,
 	She pulld both red and green;
 	Then by did come, and by did go,
 	Said, Fair maid, let aleene.
 39D.5	O why pluck you the flowers, lady,
 	Or why climb you the tree?
 	Or why come ye to Chasters wood
 	Without the leave of me?
 39D.6	O I will pull the flowers, she said,
 	Or I will break the tree,
 	For Chasters wood it is my own,
 	Ill no ask leave at thee.
 39D.7	He took her by the milk-white hand,
 	And by the grass green sleeve,
 	And laid her low down on the flowers,
 	At her he asked no leave.
 39D.8	The lady blushed, and sourly frowned,
 	And she did think great shame;
 	Says, if you are a gentleman,
 	You will tell me your name.
 39D.9	First they did call me Jack, he said,
 	And then they called me John,
 	But since I lived in the fairy court
 	Tomlin has always been my name.
 39D.10	So do not pluck that flower, lady,
 	That has these pimples gray;
 	They would destroy the bonny babe
 	That weve got in our play.
 39D.11	O tell me, Tomlin, she said,
 	And tell it to me soon,
 	Was you ever at good church-door,
 	Or got you christendoom?
 39D.12	O I have been at good church-door,
 	And aff her yetts within;
 	I was the Laird of Fouliss son,
 	The heir of all this land.
 39D.13	But it fell once upon a day,
 	As hunting I did ride,
 	As I rode east and west yon hill
 	There woe did me betide.
 39D.14	O drowsy, drowsy as I was!
 	Dead sleep upon me fell;
 	The Queen of Fairies she was there,
 	And took me to hersell.
 39D.15	The Elfins is a pretty place,
 	In which I love to dwell,
 	But yet at every seven years end
 	The last here goes to hell;
 	And as I am ane o flesh and blood,
 	I fear the next be mysell.
 39D.16	The morn at even is Halloween;
 	Our fairy court will ride,
 	Throw England and Scotland both,
 	Throw al the world wide;
 	And if ye would me borrow,
 	At Rides Cross ye may bide.
 39D.17	You may go into the Miles Moss,
 	Between twelve hours and one;
 	Take holy water in your hand,
 	And cast a compass round.
 39D.18	The first court that comes along,
 	Youll let them all pass by;
 	The next court that comes along,
 	Salute them reverently.
 39D.19	The next court that comes along
 	Is clad in robes of green,
 	And its the head court of them all,
 	For in it rides the queen.
 39D.20	And I upon a milk-white steed,
 	With a gold star in my crown;
 	Because I am an earthly man
 	Im next to the queen in renown.
 39D.21	Then seize upon me with a spring,
 	Then to the ground Ill fa,
 	And then youll hear a rueful cry
 	That Tomlin is awa.
 39D.22	Then Ill grow in your arms two
 	Like to a savage wild;
 	But hold me fast, let me not go,
 	Im father of your child.
 39D.23	Ill grow into your arms two
 	Like an adder or a snake;
 	But hold me fast, let me not go,
 	Ill be your earthly maick.
 39D.24	Ill grow into your arms two
 	Like iron in strong fire;
 	But hold me fast, let me not go,
 	Then youll have your desire.
 39D.25	She rid down to Miles Cross,
 	Between twelve hours and one,
 	Took holy water in her hand,
 	And cast a compass round.
 39D.26	The first court that came along,
 	She let them all pass by;
 	The next court that came along
 	Saluted reverently.
 39D.27	The next court that came along
 	Were clad in robes of green,
 	When Tomlin, on a milk-white steed,
 	She saw ride with the queen.
 39D.28	She seized him in her arms two,
 	He to the ground did fa,
 	And then she heard a ruefull cry
 	Tomlin is now awa.
 39D.29	He grew into her arms two
 	Like to a savage wild;
 	She held him fast, let him not go,
 	The father of her child.
 39D.30	He grew into her arms two
 	Like an adder or a snake;
 	She held him fast, let him not go,
 	He was her earthly maick.
 39D.31	He grew into her arms two
 	Like iron in hot fire;
 	She held him fast, let him not go,
 	He was her hearts desire.
 39D.32	Then sounded out throw elphin court,
 	With a loud shout and a cry,
 	That the pretty maid of Chasters wood
 	That day had caught her prey.
 39D.33	O stay, Tomlin, cried Elphin Queen,
 	Till I pay you your fee;
 	His father has lands and rents enough,
 	He wants no fee from thee.
 39D.34	O had I known at early morn
 	Tomlin would from me gone,
 	I would have taken out his heart of flesh
 	Put in a heart of stone.

 	For Tam-a-line hes there.
 39G.2	Even about that knights middle

 	And a maid returns again.
 39G.3	Lady Margaret sits in her bower door,

 39G.4	She hadna poud a rose, a rose,

 39G.5	O why pou ye the rose, the rose?

 39G.6	I will pou the rose, the rose,

 39G.7	Hes taen her by the milk-white hand,

 39G.9	She turnd her right and round about,

 	But naething heard she, nor naething saw,
 	As a the woods grew dim.
 39G.10	Seven days she tarried there,

 39G.11	When she came to her fathers court,

 39G.16	Shes taen her mantle her about,

 39G.19	O why pou ye the pile, Margaret,

 39G.23	O tell me, tell me, Tam-a-Line,
 	O tell, an tell me true,

 39G.24	O I hae been at gude church-door,

 39G.32	Yell do you down to Miles-corse,

 39G.44	Then she has done her to Miles-corse,
 	Between twall hours an ane,
 	And filled her hands o holy water,
 	And kiest her compass roun.

 	Till I pay you your fee:
 	His father wants not lands nor rents,
 	Hell ask nae fee frae thee.
 39G.51	Gin I had kent yestreen, yestreen,

 	When fairy folk will ride,
 	And they that wad their true-love win,

 	Or how shall I thee knaw,
 	Amang so many unearthly knights,
 	The like I never saw?
 39I.36	The first company that passes by,

 	The next company that passes by,
 	Say na, and do right sae;

 	Then Ill be ane o thae.
 39I.37	First let pass the black, Janet,

 	But grip ye to the milk-white steed,
 	And pu the rider down.
 39I.38	For I ride on the milk-white steed,

 39I.40	Theyll turn me in your arms, Janet,
 	An adder and a snake;
 	But had me fast, let me not pass,
 	Gin ye wad be my maik.
 39I.41	Theyll turn me in your arms, Janet,
 	An adder and an ask;
 	Theyll turn me in your arms, Janet,
 	A bale that burns fast.
 39I.42	Theyll turn me in your arms, Janet,
 	A red-hot gad o airn;
 	But haud me fast, let me not pass,
 	For Ill do you no harm.
 39I.43	First dip me in a stand o milk,
 	And then in a stand o water;
 	But had me fast, let me not pass,
 	Ill be your bairns father.
 39I.44	And next theyll shape me in your arms
 	A tod but and an eel;
 	But had me fast, nor let me gang,
 	As you do love me weel.
 39I.45	Theyll shape me in your arms, Janet,

 	And last theyll shape me in your arms
 	A mother-naked man;
 	Cast your green mantle over me,
 	Ill be myself again.
 39I.46	Gloomy, gloomy, was the night,
 	And eiry was the way,
 	As fair Janet, in her green mantle,
 	To Miles Cross she did gae.
 39I.47	About the dead hour o the night
 	She heard the bridles ring,
 	And Janet was as glad o that
 	As any earthly thing.
 39I.48	And first gaed by the black black steed,
 	And then gaed by the brown;
 	But fast she gript the milk-white steed,
 	And pud the rider down.
 39I.49	She pud him frae the milk-white steed,
 	And loot the bridle fa,
 	And up there raise an erlish cry,
 	Hes won amang us a!
 39I.50	They shaped him in fair Janets arms
 	An esk but and an adder;
 	She held him fast in every shape,
 	To be her bairns father.
 39I.51	They shaped him in her arms at last
 	A mother-naked man,
 	She wrapt him in her green mantle,
 	And sae her true love wan.
 39I.52	Up then spake the Queen o Fairies,
 	Out o a bush o broom:
 	She that has borrowd young Tamlane
 	Has gotten a stately groom.
 39I.53	Up then spake the Queen o Fairies,
 	Out o a bush o rye:
 	Shes taen awa the bonniest knight
 	In a my cumpanie.
 39I.54	But had I kennd, Tamlane, she says,
 	A lady wad borrowd thee
 	I wad taen out thy twa grey een,
 	Put in twa een o tree.
 39I.55	Had I but kennd, Tamlane, she says,
 	Before ye came frae hame,
 	I wad taen out your heart o flesh,
 	Put in a heart o stane.
 39I.56	Had I but had the wit yestreen
 	That I hae coft the day,
 	Id paid my kane seven times to hell
 	Ere youd been won away.
