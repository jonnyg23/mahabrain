 	 But for to meet your brother Jhon,
 	 Upon the braes of Yarrow,
 214A.7	 As he gade down yon dowy den,
 	 Sorrow went him before, O;
 	 Nine well-wight men lay waiting him,
 	 Upon the braes of Yarrow.
 214A.8	 I have your sister to my wife,
 	 Ye think me an unmeet marrow;
 	 But yet one foot will I never flee
 	 Now frae the braes of Yarrow.
 214A.9	 Than four he killd and five did wound,
 	 That was an unmeet marrow!
 	 And he had weel nigh wan the day
 	 Upon the braes of Yarrow.
 214A.10	 Bot a cowardly loon came him behind,
 	 Our Lady lend him sorrow!
 	 And wi a rappier pierced his heart,
 	 And laid him low on Yarrow.
 214A.11	 Now Douglas to his sisters gane,
 	 Wi meikle dule and sorrow:
 	 Gae to your luve, sister, he says,
 	 Hes sleeping sound on Yarrow.
 214A.12	 As she went down yon dowy den,
 	 Sorrow went her before, O;
 	 She saw her true-love lying slain
 	 Upon the braes of Yarrow.
 214A.13	 She swoond thrice upon his breist
 	 That was her dearest marrow;
 	 Said, Ever alace and wae the day
 	 Thou wentst frae me to Yarrow!
 214A.14	 She kist his mouth, she kaimed his hair,
 	 As she had done before, O ;

 214C.6	 Hold your tongue, my lady fair,
 	 For what needs a this sorrow?
 	 For Ill be hame gin the clock strikes nine,

 214J.1	 IN Thoro town there lives a maid,
 	 I am sure she has no marrow;
 	 For she has forsaken both lords and knights,
 	 And loved a servant-lad in Galla.
 214J.2	 Evening and morning her page he ran,
 	 Her page he ran wi sorrow,
 	 With letters bound, just frae the town,
 	 To the servant-lad in Galla.
 214J.3	 Her father he got word of that,
 	 And hes bred all her sorrow;
 	 He sent him forth to fight wi nine,
 	 In the dowie glens of Yarrow.
 214J.4	 She washd his face, she combd his hair,
 	 She thought he had no marrow;
 	 Wi a thrusty rapier by his side,
 	 She sent him forth to Yarrow.
 214J.5	 Shes taen fareweel of him that day,
 	 As she had done before, O,
 	 And shes comd back to her bonny bower,

 214J.6	 He wanderd up, he wandred down,
 	 His heart was full of sorrow;
 	 There he spied nine gentlemen,
 	 Watering their steeds in Yarrow.
 214J.7	 O come away, young man, they said,
 	 Im sure yer no our marrow;

 	 Thats no an equal marrow;
 	 Yet for my loves sake Ill venture my life,
 	 In the dowie glens of Yarrow.
 214J.9	 Five was wounded, and four was slain,
 	 Amongst them a he had no marrow;
 	 Hes mounted on his horse again,
 	 Cries, I have won the bonny lass of Thorro!
 214J.10	 Up then spake her father dear-+--+-

 214J.15	 Shes washd hin in the clear well-strand,
 	 Shes dryd him wi the holland,
 	 And aye she sighd, and said, Alass!
 	 For my love I had him chosen.
 214J.16	 His hair it was three quarters long,
 	 Three quarters long and yellow;
 	 And shes rapt it round her middle small,
 	 And brought it home to Thorro.
 214J.17	 O hold your tongue, my daughter dear,
 	 And talk no more of sorrow;
 	 Ill soon wed you on a better match

 214J.18	 O you may wed a your seven sons,

 	 And she refused nine noble men

 	 Would get the Rose of Yarrow.
 214L.3	 Quoth he, Youre nine, an Im but ane,

 214L.4	 She kissed his lips, and combed his hair,
