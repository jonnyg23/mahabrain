 <pre>
 
 99A.1	O JOHNEY was as brave a knight
 	As ever saild the sea,
 	An hes done him to the English court,
 	To serve for meat and fee.
 99A.2	He had nae been in fair England
 	But yet a little while,
 	Untill the kingis ae daughter
 	To johney proves wi chil.
 99A.3	O words come to the king himsel,
 	In his chair where he sat,
 	That his ae daughter was wi bairn
 	To Jack, the Little Scott.
 99A.4	Gin this be true that I do hear,
 	As I trust well it be,
 	Ye pit her into prison strong,
 	An starve her till she die.
 99A.5	O Johneys on to fair Scotland,
 	A wot he went wi speed,
 	An he has left the kingis court,
 	A wot good was his need.
 99A.6	O it fell once upon a day
 	That Johney he thought lang,
 	An hes gane to the good green wood,
 	As fast as he coud gang.
 99A.7	O whare will I get a bonny boy,
 	To rin my errand soon,
 	That will rin into fair England,
 	An haste him back again?
 99A.8	O up it starts a bonny boy,
 	Gold yallow was his hair,
 	I wish his mither meickle joy,
 	His bonny love mieckle mair.
 99A.9	O here am I, a bonny boy,
 	Will rin your errand soon;
 	I will gang into fair England,
 	An come right soon again.
 99A.10	O whan he came to broken briggs,
 	He bent his bow and swam;
 	An whan he came to the green grass growan,
 	He slaikid his shoone an ran.
 99A.11	Whan he came to yon high castzel,
 	He ran it roun about,
 	An there he saw the kings daughter,
 	At the window looking out.
 99A.12	O heres a sark o silk, lady,
 	Your ain han sewd the sleeve;
 	Your bidden come to fair Scotlan,
 	Speer nane o your parents leave.
 99A.13	Ha, take this sark o silk, lady,
 	Your ain han swed the gare;
 	Youre bidden come to good green wood,
 	Love Johney waits you there.
 99A.14	Shes turnd her right and roun about,
 	The tear was in her ee:
 	How can I come to my true-love,
 	Except I had wings to flee?
 99A.15	Here am I kept wi bars and bolts,
 	Most grievous to behold;
 	My breast-plates o the sturdy steel,
 	Instead of the beaten gold.
 99A.16	But tak this purse, my bonny boy,
 	Ye well deserve a fee,
 	An bear this letter to my love,
 	An tell him what you see.
 99A.17	Then quickly ran the bonny boy
 	Again to Scotlan fair,
 	An soon he reachd Pitnachtons towrs,
 	An soon found Johney there.
 99A.18	He pat the letter in his han
 	An taul him what he sa,
 	But eer he half the letter read,
 	He loote the tears doun fa.
 99A.19	O I will gae back to fair Englan,
 	Tho death shoud me betide,
 	An I will relieve the damesel
 	That lay last by my side.
 99A.20	Then out it spake his father dear,
 	My son, you are to blame;
 	An gin your catchd on English groun,
 	I fear youll neer win hame.
 99A.21	Then out it spake a valiant knight,
 	Johnys best friend was he;
 	I can commaun five hunder men,
 	An Ill his surety be.
 99A.22	The firstin town that they came till,
 	They gard the bells be rung;
 	An the nextin town that they came till,
 	They gard the mess be sung.
 99A.23	The thirdin town that they came till,
 	They gard the drums beat roun;
 	The king but an his nobles a,
 	Was startld at the soun.
 99A.24	Whan they came to the kings palace
 	They rade it roun about,
 	An there they saw the king himsel,
 	At the window looking out.
 99A.25	Is this the Duke o Albany,
 	Or James, the Scottish king?
 	Or are ye some great foreign lord,
 	Thats come a visiting?
 99A.26	Im nae the Duke of Albany,
 	Nor James, the Scottish king;
 	But Im a valiant Scottish knight,
 	Pitnachton is my name.
 99A.27	O if Pitnachton be your name,
 	As I trust well it be,
 	The morn, or I tast meat or drink,
 	You shall be hanged hi.
 99A.28	Then out it spake the valiant knight
 	That came brave Johney wi;
 	Behold five hunder bowmen bold,
 	Will die to set him free.
 99A.29	Then out it spake the king again,
 	An a scornfu laugh laugh he;
 	I have an Italian i my house
 	Will fight you three by three.
 99A.30	O grant me a boon, brave Johney cried;
 	Bring your Italian here;
 	Then if he fall beneath my sword,
 	Ive won your daughter dear.
 99A.31	Then out it came that Italian,
 	An a gurious ghost was he;
 	Upo the point o Johneys sword
 	This Italian did die.
 99A.32	Out has he drawn his lang, lang bran,
 	Struck it across the plain:
 	Is there any more o your English dogs
 	That you want to be slain?
 99A.33	A clark, a clark, the king then cried,
 	To write her tocher free;
 	A priest, a priest, says Love Johney,
 	To marry my love and me.
 99A.34	Im seeking nane o your gold, he says,
 	Nor of your silver clear;
 	I only seek your daughter fair,
 	Whose love has cost her dear.

 99B.1	JOHNNYRRrrS into England gane,
 	Three quarters of a year;
 	Johnnys into England gane,
 	The kings banner to bear.
 99B.2	He had na been in England lang,
 	But and a little while,
 	Untill the kings daughter
 	To Johnny gaes wi child.
 99B.3	Word is to the kitchin gane,
 	And word is to the ha,
 	And word is to the kings palace,
 	Amang the nobles a.
 99B.4	Words gane to the kings palace,
 	The palace where she sat,
 	That his ae daughter gaes wi child
 	To Jock, the Little Scot.
 99B.5	If she be wi child, he says,
 	As I trow well she be,
 	Ill put her into strang prison,
 	And hang her till she die.
 99B.6	But up and spak young Johnny,
 	And O he spake in time:
 	Is there never a bony boy here
 	Will rin my errand soon?
 99B.7	That will gae to yon castle,
 	And look it round about?
 	And there hell see a fair lady,
 	The window looking out.
 99B.8	Up then spak a bony boy,
 	And a bony boy was he:
 	Ill run thy errand, Johnny, he said,
 	Untill the day I die.
 99B.9	Put on your gown o silk, madam,
 	And on your hand a glove,
 	And gang into the good green-wood,
 	To Johnny, your true-love.
 99B.10	The fetters they are on my feet,
 	And O but they are cauld!
 	My bracelets they are sturdy steel,
 	Instead of beaten gold.
 99B.11	But I will write a lang letter,
 	And seal it tenderlie,
 	And I will send to my true-love,
 	Before that I do die.
 99B.12	The first look that Johnny lookd,
 	A loud laughter gae he;
 	But the next look that Johnny gae,
 	The tear blinded his ee.
 99B.13	He says, Ill into England gae,
 	Whatever may betide,
 	And a to seek a fair woman
 	That sud hae been my bride.
 99B.14	But up and speaks his father,
 	And O he spak in time:
 	If that ye into England gae,
 	Im feerd ye neer come hame.
 99B.15	But up then speaks our gude Scotch king,
 	And a brisk young man was he:
 	Hes hae five hunder o my life-guard,
 	To bear him companie.
 99B.16	When Johnny was on saddle set,
 	And seemly for to see,
 	There was not a married man
 	Into his companie.
 99B.17	When Johnny sat on saddle-seat,
 	And seemly to behold,
 	The hair that hang on Johnnys head
 	Was like the threads o gold.
 99B.18	When he cam to . . .
 	He gard the bells a ring,
 	Untill the king and a his court
 	Did marvel at the thing.
 99B.19	Is this the brave Argyle, he said,
 	Thats landed and come hame?
 	Is this the brave Argyle, he said,
 	Or James, our Scottish king?
 99B.20	Its no the brave Argyle, they said,
 	Thats landed and come hame;
 	But it is a brave young Scottish knight,
 	McNaughtan is his name.
 99B.21	If McNaughtan be his name, he says,
 	As I trow weel it be,
 	The fairest lady in a my court
 	Gangs wi child to thee.
 99B.22	If that she be wi child, he says,
 	As I wat weel she be,
 	Ill mak it lord o a my land,
 	And her my gay lady.
 99B.23	I have a champion in my court
 	Will fight you a by three;
 	But up then speaks a brisk young man,
 	And a brisk young man was he:
 	I will fight to my lifes end,
 	Before poor Johnny die.
 99B.24	The king but and his nobles a
 	Went out into the plain,
 	The queen but and her maidens a,
 	To see young Johnny slain.
 99B.25	The first wound that Johnny gae the champion
 	Was a deep wound and sair;
 	The next wound that he gae the champion,
 	He never spak mair.
 99B.26	A priest, a priest, young Johnny cries,
 	To wed me and my love;
 	A clerk, a clerk, the king he cried,
 	To sign her tocher gude.
 99B.27	Ill hae nane o your goud, he says,
 	Ill hae nane o your gear,
 	But a I want is my true-love,
 	For I hae bought her dear.
 99B.28	He took out a little goat-horn,
 	And blew baith loud and shill;
 	The victrys into Scotland gane,
 	Tho sair against their will.

 <h3 align="CENTER">99C: Johnie Scott</h3>
 <pre>
 
 99C.1	O JOHNIERRrrS to the hunting gone,
 	Unto the woods sae wild,
 	And Earl Percys old daughter
 	To Johnie goes with child.
 99C.2	O word is to the kitchen gone,
 	And word is to the ha,
 	And word is to the highest towers,
 	Amang the nobles a.
 99C.3	If she be with child, her father said,
 	As woe forbid it be,
 	Ill put her into a prison strong,
 	And try the veritie.
 99C.4	But if she be with child, her mother said,
 	As woe forbid it be,
 	Ill put her intil a dungeon dark,
 	And hunger her till she die.
 99C.5	Then she has wrote a braid letter,
 	And sealed it wi her hand,
 	And sent T to the merry green wood,
 	Wi her own boy at command.
 99C.6	The first line of the letter he read,
 	His heart was full of joy;
 	But he had not read a line past two
 	Till the salt tears blind his eye.
 99C.7	O I must up to England go,
 	What ever me betide,
 	For to relieve that fair ladie
 	That lay last by my side.
 99C.8	Out and spak his father then,
 	And he spak all in time:
 	Johnie, if ye to England go,
 	I fear yell neer return.
 99C.9	But out and spak his uncle then,
 	And he spak bitterlie:
 	Five hundred of my good life-guards
 	Shall go along with thee.
 99C.10	When they were mounted on their steeds,
 	They were comely to behold;
 	The hair that hung owre Johnies shoulders
 	Was like the yellow gold.
 99C.11	The first town that they came to,
 	They made the bells to ring;
 	And when they rode the town all owre,
 	They made the trumpets sound.
 99C.12	When they came to Earl Percys gates,
 	They rode them round about,
 	And who saw he but his own true-love,
 	At a window looking out!
 99C.13	The doors they are bolted with iron and steel,
 	The windows round about;
 	My feet they are in fetters strong;
 	And how can I get out?
 99C.14	My garters they are of the lead,
 	And oh but they be cold!
 	My breast-plates of the beaten steel,
 	Instead of beaten gold.
 99C.15	But when they came to Earl Percys yett,
 	They tirled at the pin;
 	None was so ready as Earl Percy
 	To open and let them in.
 99C.16	Art thou the King of Aulsberry,
 	Or art thou the King of Spain?
 	Or art thou one of our gay Scots lords,
 	McNachtan by thy name?
 99C.17	Im not the King of Aulsberry,
 	Nor yet the King of Spain;
 	But I am one of our gay Scots lords,
 	Johnie Scot I am called by name.
 99C.18	If Johnnie Scot be thy name, he said,
 	As I trow weel it be,
 	The fairest lady in a our court
 	Gaes big with child to thee.
 99C.19	If she be with child, fair Johnie said,
 	As I trow weel she be,
 	Ill make it heir owre a my land,
 	And her my gay ladie.
 99C.20	But if she be with child, her father said,
 	As I trow weel she be,
 	Tomorrow morn again eight o clock
 	High hanged thou shalt be.
 99C.21	But out and spak his uncle then,
 	And he spak bitterlie:
 	Before that we see Johnie Scot slain,
 	Well a fight till we die.
 99C.22	But is there ever a Tailliant about your court,
 	That will fight duels three?
 	Before that I be hanged or slain,
 	On the Tailliants sword Ill die.
 99C.23	But some is to the good green wood,
 	And some is to the plain,
 	Either to see fair Johnie hanged,
 	Or else to see him slain.
 99C.24	And they began at eight o clock of the morning,
 	And they fought on till three,
 	Till the Tailliant, like a swallow swift,
 	Owre Johnies head did flee.
 99C.25	But Johnie being a clever young boy,
 	He wheeled him round about,
 	And on the point of Johnies broad sword
 	The Tailliant he slew out.
 99C.26	A priest, a priest, fair Johnie cried,
 	To wed my love and me;
 	A clerk, a clerk, her father cried,
 	To sum the tocher free.
 99C.27	Ill have non of your gold, fair Johnie said,
 	Nor none of your white monie;
 	But I will have my own fair bride,
 	For I vow that Ive bought her dear.
 99C.28	Hes taen his true-love by the hand,
 	He led her up the plain:
 	Have you any more of your English dogs
 	You want for to have slain?
 99C.29	He took a little horn out of his pocket,
 	He blew it baith loud and shill,
 	And honours into Scotland gone,
 	In spite of Englands skill.

 <h3 align="CENTER">99D: Johnie Scott</h3>
 <pre>
 
 99D.1	O JOHNNIE Scot walks up and down
 	Among the woods sae wild;
 	Who but the Earl of Percys ae daughter
 	To him goes big with child!
 99D.2	O word is to the kitchen gone,
 	And words gone to the hall,
 	And word is to King Henry gane,
 	And amongst his nobles all.
 99D.3	O Johnnies called his waiting-man,
 	His name was Germanie:
 	O thou must to fair England go,
 	Bring me that fair ladie.
 99D.4	He rode till he came to Earl Percys gate,
 	He tirled at the pin;
 	O who is there? said the proud porter,
 	But I daurna let thee in.
 99D.5	So he rade up, and he rode down,
 	Till he rode it round about;
 	Then he saw her at a wee window,
 	Where she was looking out.
 99D.6	O thou must go to Johnnie Scot,
 	Unto the woods so green,
 	In token of thy silken shirt,
 	Thine own hand sewed the seam.
 99D.7	How can I go to Johnnie Scot?
 	Or how can I get out?
 	My breast plates o the hard, hard iron,
 	With fetters round about.
 99D.8	But I will write a lang letter,
 	And give it unto thee,
 	And thou must take that to Johnnie Scot,
 	See what answer he sends to me.
 99D.9	When Johnnie looked the letter upon
 	A sorry man was he;
 	He had not read one line but two
 	Till the saut tear did blind his ee.
 99D.10	O I must to fair England go,
 	Whatever me betide,
 	All for to fight for that gay ladie
 	That last lay by my side.
 99D.11	O out and spoke his father then,
 	And he spoke well in time:
 	O if you to fair England go,
 	I doubt your coming home.
 99D.12	O no, O no, said good King James,
 	Before such a thing shall be,
 	Ill send five hundred of my life-guards,
 	To bear Johnnie company.
 99D.13	When they were all on saddle set,
 	Most pleasant to behold,
 	The hair that hung over Johnnies neck
 	Was like the links of gold.
 99D.14	When they were all marching away,
 	Most beautiful to see,
 	There was not so much as a married man
 	In Johnnies company.
 99D.15	O Johnnie was the foremost man
 	In the company that did ride;
 	King James he was the second man,
 	Wi his rapier by his side.
 99D.16	They rode till they came to Earl Percys yate,
 	They tirled at the pin:
 	O who is there? said the proud porter;
 	But I daurnot let thee in.
 99D.17	Is it the Duke of York, he said,
 	Or James, our Scotish king?
 	Or is it one of the Scotish lords,
 	From hunting new come home?
 99D.18	Its not the Duke of York, he said,
 	Nor James, our Scotish king;
 	But it is one of the Scotish lords,
 	Earl Hector is my name.
 99D.19	When Johnnie came before the king,
 	He fell low down on his knee:
 	O the brawest lady in a my court
 	With child goes big to thee.
 99D.20	O if she be with child, Johnnie said,
 	As I trew well she be,
 	I will make it heir of all my land,
 	And her my gay ladie.
 99D.21	But if she be with child, said the king,
 	As I trew well she be,
 	Before the morn at ten o clock
 	High hanged thou shalt be.
 99D.22	O no, O no, said good King James,
 	Before such a thing shall be,
 	Before that Johnnie Scot be hanged,
 	Well a fight till we die.
 99D.23	But there is a Talliant in my court,
 	Of men he will fight five;
 	Go bring them out to the green wood,
 	See wha will gain the prize.
 99D.24	Lords and ladies flocked all,
 	They flocked all amain,
 	They flocked all to the green wood,
 	To see poor Johnnie slain.
 99D.25	This Talliant he could find no way
 	To be poor Johnnies dead,
 	But, like unto a swallow swift,
 	He jumped oer Johnnies head.
 99D.26	But Johnnie was a clever man,
 	Cunning and crafty withal,
 	And up on the top of his braid sword
 	He made this Talliant fall.
 99D.27	A priest, a priest, then Johnnie cried,
 	To marry my love and me;
 	A clerk, a clerk, her father cried,
 	To sum the tocher free.
 99D.28	Ill take none of your gold, Johnnie said,
 	Nor none of your other gear,
 	But Ill just have my own true-love,
 	This day Ive won her dear.

 99E.1	MCNAUCHTONRRrrS unto England gane,
 	The kings banner to bear:
 	O do you see yon castle, boy?
 	Its walled round about;
 	There you will spy a fair ladye,
 	In the window looking out.
 99E.2	Here is a silken sark, fair lady,
 	Thine own hand sewed the sleeve,
 	And thou must go to yon green wood,
 	To Johnnie thy true-love.
 99E.3	The castle it is high, my boy,
 	And walled round about;
 	My feet are in the fetters strong,
 	And how can I get out?
 99E.4	My garters o the gude black iron,
 	And they are very cold;
 	My breast plates of the sturdy steel,
 	Instead of beaten gold.
 99E.5	But had I paper, pen and ink,
 	And candle at my command,
 	Its I would write a lang letter
 	To John in fair Scotland.
 99E.6	The first line that Johnnie looked on,
 	A loud, loud lauch leuch he;
 	The second line that Johnnie looked on,
 	The tear did blind his ee.
 99E.7	Says, I must unto England go,
 	Whatever me betide,
 	For to relieve my own fair lady,
 	That lay last by my side.
 99E.8	Then up and spoke Johnnies auld mither,
 	A well spoke woman was she:
 	If you do go to England, Johnnie,
 	I may take farewell o thee.
 99E.9	Then up and spoke Johnnies old father,
 	A well spoke man was he:
 	Its twenty-four of my gay troop
 	Shall go along with thee.
 99E.10	When Johnie was on saddle set,
 	Right comely to be seen,
 	There was not so much as a married man
 	In Johnies companie;
 	There was not so much as a married man,
 	Not a one only but ane.
 99E.11	The first gude toun that Johnie came to,
 	He made the bells be rung;
 	The next gude toun that Johnie came to,
 	He made the psalms be sung.
 99E.12	The next gude toun that Johnie came to,
 	He made the drums beat round,
 	Till the king and all his merry men
 	A-marvelled at the sound.
 99E.13	Are you the Duke of Mulberry,
 	Or James, our Scotish king?
 	Are you the Duke of Mulberry,
 	From Scotland new come home?
 99E.14	Im not the Duke of Mulberry,
 	Nor James, our Scotish king;
 	But I am a true Scotishman,
 	McNaughtoun is my name.
 99E.15	If McNaughtoun be your name, he said,
 	As I trew well it be,
 	The fairest lady in a my court
 	She goes with child to thee.
 99E.16	If McNauchton be your name, he said,
 	As I trew well it be,
 	Tomorrow morn by eight o clock
 	O hanged you shall be.
 99E.17	O Johnie had a bonnie little boy,
 	His name was Germany:
 	Before that we be all hanged, my sovereign,
 	Well fight you till we die.
 99E.18	Say on, say on, my bonnie little boy,
 	It is well spoken of thee,
 	For there is a campioun in my court
 	Shall fight you three by three.
 99E.19	Next morning about eight oclock
 	The king and his merry men,
 	The queen and all her maidens fair,
 	Came whistling down the green,
 	To see the cruel fight begin,
 	And see poor Johnnie slain.
 99E.20	y fought on, and Johnie fought on,
 	Wi swords of tempered steel,
 	Until the drops of red, red blood
 	Ran prinkling down the field.
 99E.21	They fought on, and Johnie fought on,
 	They fought so manfullie
 	They left not a man alive in all the kings court,
 	Not a man only but three.
 99E.22	A priest, a priest, poor Johnie cries,
 	To wed my love and me;
 	A clerk, a clerk, the king did cry,
 	To write her portion free.
 99E.23	Ill have none of your gold, he says,
 	Nor none of your white money,
 	But I will have mine own fair lady,
 	Who has been dear to me.
 99E.24	Johnie put a horn unto his mouth,
 	He blew it wondrous schill;
 	The sound is unto Scotland gane,
 	Sair against all their will.
 99E.25	He put his horn to his mouth,
 	He blew it ower again,
 	And aye the sound the horn cried,
 	McNaughtouns cure to them!

 	And word has to the king himsell,
 	In the chamber where he sat,
 	That his ae daughter gaes wi bairn

 99F.2	Word has to the kitchen gane,
 	And word has to the ha,
 	And word has to the queen hersell,
 	In the chamber where she sat,

 99F.3	O if she be wi bairn, he says,
 	As I trew well she be,
 	Well put her in a prison strang,
 	And try her verity.
 99F.4	O if she be wi bairn, she says,
 	As I trew weel she be,

 	And hunger her till she die.
 99F.5	Now she has written a letter,
 	And sealed it with her hand,
 	And sent it unto Johnie Scot,
 	To come at her command.
 99F.6	The first lang line that he looked to,
 	He laughed at the same;

 99F.7	Once more to England I must go,
 	May God be my sure guide!
 	And all to see that lady fair
 	That last lay by my side.
 99F.8	Then out bespoke our Scotish king,
 	And he spoke manfullie:
 	I and three thousand of my guards
 	Will bear you companye.
 99F.9	They all were mounted on horseback,
 	So gallantly they rode;
 	The hair that hung owre Johnies shoulders
 	Was like the links of goud.
 99F.10	When they came to the king of Englands gate,
 	They knocked at the pin;
 	So ready was the king himsell
 	To open and let them in.
 99F.11	Are you the Duke [of York], he says,
 	Or are ye the King of Spain?
 	Or are ye some of the gay Scots boys,
 	From hunting now come hame?
 99F.12	I am not the Duke of York, he says,
 	Nor yet the King of Spain;
 	But I am one of the gay Scots boys,
 	From hunting just come hame.
 99F.13	If you are one of the Scots boys,
 	As I trew weel you be,
 	The fairest lady in my hall
 	Gaes big wi child to thee.
 99F.14	Then if she be wi bairn, he says,
 	As I trew weel she be,

 	And her my fair ladye.
 99F.15	If she be wi bairn, her father says,
 	As I trew weel she be,
 	Before the morn at ten oclock
 	High hanged thou shall be.
 99F.16	Then out bespake our Scotish king,
 	And he spoke manfullie:
 	Before that Johnie Scott be slain,
 	Well all fight till we die.
 99F.17	I have a Talliant in my house
 	Well fight your men by three;
 	Bring out your trooper, Johnie says,
 	For fain I would him see.
 99F.18	Some gade unto the high mountain,
 	Some gade unto the plain,
 	Some at high windows looked out,
 	To see poor Johnie slain.
 99F.19	The Talliant he fought on a while,
 	Thinking of Johnie would retire,
 	And then he, like a swallow swifte,
 	Owre Johnies head did flee.
 99F.20	But Johnie was a clever man,
 	And turned about with speed,
 	And on the edge of his broadsword
 	He slew the Talliant dead.
 99F.21	Then he has brought the lady out,
 	And sat her on a dapple-gray,
 	And being mounted on before,
 	They briskly rode away.
 99F.22	Now the honour unto Scotland came,
 	In spite of Englands skill;
 	The honour unto Scotland came
 	In spite of Englands will.

 99G.4	The king did write a long letter,
 	Sealed it with his own hand,
 	And he sent it to Johnie Scot,
 	To speak at his command.
 99G.5	When Johnie read this letter long,

 99G.6	Out and spak his mother dear,

 99G.7	Out and spoke a Scotish prince,

 99G.17	Johnie took sword into his hand,
 	And walked cross the plain;
 	There was many a weeping lady there,
 	To see young Johnie slain.
 99G.18	The Talliant, never knowing this,
 	Now hell be Johnies dead,
 	But, like unto a swallow swift,
 	He flew out owre his head.
 99G.19	Johnie was a valliant man,
 	Weel taught in war was he,
 	And on the point of his broad sword
 	The Talliant stickit he.
 99G.20	Johnie took sword into his hand,
 	And walked cross the plain:
 	Are there here any moe of your English dogs
 	Thats wanting to be slain?
 99G.21	A priest, a priest, young Johnie cries,
 	To wed my bride and me;
 	A clerk, a clerk, her father cried,

 99G.22	Im wanting none of your gold, he says,
 	As little of your gear;
 	But give me just mine own true-love,
 	I think Ive won her dear.
 99G.23	Johnie sets horn into his mouth,

 99L.11	When Johnnie came to the kings bower
 	He tinkled at the ring;
 	Who was so ready as the king himself
 	To let proud Johnnie in!
 99L.12	Are ye the Duke of Marlborough, he said,
 	Or James, our Scottish king?
 	Or are you my bastard son,
 	From Scotland new come home?
 99L.13	Im not the Duke of Marlborough, he said,
 	Nor James, our Scottish king;
 	But I am just a good Scotch lad,
 	And Johnnie Scotts my name.
 99L.14	If you be Johnnie Scott, says he,
 	As I suppose you be,
 	The fairest flower in all England
 	Is big with child by thee.
 99L.15	If she be big with child, said he,
 	As I hope her to be,
 	Ill make it heir of all my lands,
 	And she my gay lady.
 99L.16	O no, then the king he crys,
 	Theres no such thing will be;
 	There is an Italian in my court,
 	And by his hands yell die.
 99L.17	Ill stand my ground, says Johnnie Scott,
 	Ill stand it till I die;
 	Ill stand my ground, says Johnnie Scott,
 	One foot Id scorn to fly.
 99L.18	When the Italian was brought out,
 	A fearsome sight was he;
 	Between his brows three womens spang,
 	His shoulders was yards three.
 99L.19	As Johnnie, being a crafty lad,
 	Well tried at the sword was he,
 	Upon the point of his broad sword
 	He made the Italian die.

 99[S.13]	Instead of silken stays, my boy,
 	With steel Im lacd about;
 	My feet are bound with fetters strong,
 	And how can I get out?
 99[S.14]	But tell him he must stay at home,
 	Nor venture here for me;
 	Else an Italian in our court
 	Must fight him till he die.
 99[S.15]	When Johny he got wit o that,
 	An angry man was he:
 	But I will gae wi a my men
 	My dearest dear to see.
 99[S.16]	But up then spake a noble lord,
 	A noble lord was he;
 	The best of a my merry men
 	Shall bear you company.
 99[S.17]	But up then spake his auld mother,
 	I wat wi meikle pain;
 	If ye will gae to London, son,
 	Yel neer come back again.
 99[S.18]	But Johny turnd him round about,
 	I wat wi meikle pride:
 	But I will gae to London town,
 	Whatever may betide.
 99[S.19]	When they were a on horseback set,
 	How comely to behold!
 	For a the hairs o Johnys head
 	Did shine like threads o gold.
 99[S.20]	The first ae town that they gaed through,
 	They gart the bells be rung,
 	But the neist town that they gaed through
 	They gart the mass be sung.
 99[S.21]	But when they gaed to London town
 	The trumpets loud were blown,
 	Which made the king and a his court
 	To marvel at the sound.
 99[S.22]	Is this the Duke of Morebattle?
 	Or James the Scottish king?
 	No, sire, Im a Scottish lord,
 	McNaughten is my name.
 99[S.23]	If you be that young Scottish lord,
 	As I believe you be,
 	The fairest lady in my court
 	She gaes wi child by thee.
 99[S.24]	And if she be with child by me,
 	As I think sae may be,
 	It shall be heir of a my land,
 	And she my gay lady.
 99[S.25]	O no, O no, the king replyd,
 	That thing can never be,
 	Fore ere the morn at ten o clock
 	Ill slay thy men an thee.
 99[S.26]	A bold Italian in  my court
 	Has vanquishd Scotchmen three,
 	And ere the morn at ten o clock
 	Im sure he will slay thee.
 99[S.27]	But up the spake young Johnys boy,
 	A clever boy was he;
 	O master, ere that you be slain,
 	Theres mae be slain than thee.
 99[S.28]	The king and all his court appeard
 	Neist morning on the plain,
 	The queen and all her ladies came
 	To see youn[g] Johny slain.
 99[S.29]	Out then stepd the Italian bold,
 	And they met on the green;
 	Between his shoulders was an ell,
 	A span between his een.
 99[S.30]	When Johny in the list appeard,
 	Sae young and fair to see,
 	A prayer staw frae ilka heart,
 	A tear frae ilka ee.
 99[S.31]	And lang they fought, and sair they fought,
 	Wi swords o temperd steel,
 	Until the blood like draps o rain
 	Came trickling to their heal.
 99[S.32]	But Johny was a wannle youth,
 	And that he weel did show;
 	For wi a stroke o his broad sword
 	He clove his head in two.
 99[S.33]	A priest, a priest! then Johny cryd,
 	To wed my love and me;
 	A clerk, a clerk! the king replyd,
 	To write her tocher free.

 99[T].1	Johnnys gane up to fair England
 	Three quarters of a year,
 	And Johnys gane up to fair England,
 	The kings broad banner to bear.
 99[T.2]	He had not been in fair England,
 	Even but a little while,
 	When that the kings ae dochter
 	To Johnny gaes wi child.
 99[T.3]	And word is gane to the kitchen,
 	And words gane to the ha,
 	And words gane to the high, high court,
 	Amang the nobles a.
 99[T.4]	And word is gane unto the king,
 	In the chair where he sat,
 	That his ae dochters wi bairn
 	To John the little Scott.
 99[T.5]	If that I thought she is wi bairn,
 	As I true weel she be,
 	Ill put her up in high prison,
 	And hunger her till she die.
 99[T.6]	There is a silken sark, Johnny,
 	My ain sell sewed the gare,
 	And if ye come to tak me hence
 	Ye need nae taken mare.
 99[T.7]	For I am up in high prison,
 	And O but it is cold!
 	My garters are o the cold, cold iron,
 	In place o the beaten gold.
 99[T.8]	Is this the Duke o York? they said,
 	Or James the Scottish king?
 	Or is it John the little Scott,
 	Frae Scotland new come hame?
 99[T.9]	I have an Italian in my bower,
 	This day he has eaten three;
 	Before I either eat or sleep
 	The fourth man ye shall be.
 99[T.10]	. . . . . . .
 	. . . . . . .
 	Between his een there was two spans,
 	His shoulders ells were three.
 99[T.11]	Johnny drew forth his good braid glaive
 	And slate it on the plain:
 	Is there any more of your Italian dogs
 	That wanteth to be slain?
 99[T.12]	A clerk, a clerk! her father cryd
 	To register this deed;
 	A priest, a priest! her mother cryd,
 	To marry them wi speed.
