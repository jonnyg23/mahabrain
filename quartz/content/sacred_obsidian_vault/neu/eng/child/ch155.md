 155E.1	 YESTERDAY was brave Hallowday,
 	 And, above all days of the year,
 	 The schoolboys all got leave to play,
 	 And little Sir Hugh was there.
 155E.2	 He kicked the ball with his foot,
 	 And kepped it with his knee,
 	 And even in at the Jews window
 	 He gart the bonnie ba flee.
 155E.3	 Out then came the Jews daughter:

 155E.11	 A schoolboy walking in the garden
 	 Did grievously hear him moan;
 	 He ran away to the deep draw-well,
 	 And fell down on his knee.
 155E.12	 Says, Bonnie Sir Hugh, and pretty Sir Hugh,
 	 I pray you speak to me!
 	 If you speak to any body in this world,

 155E.21	 And go to the back of Maitland town,
 	 Bring me my winding sheet;
 	 For its at the back of Maitland town
 	 That you and I shall meet.
 155E.22	 O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom,
 	 The broom that makes full sore,
 	 A womans mercy is very little,
 	 But a mans mercy is more.

 	 Was little Sir Hugh again.
 155F.4	 She took him by the milk-white han,
 	 An led him through many a hall,
 	 Until they came to one stone chamber,
 	 Where no man might hear his call.

 155F.10	 She says, Sir Hugh, if you be here,
 	 As I suppose you be,
 	 If ever the dead or quick arose,
 	 Arise and spake to me.
 155F.11	 Yes, mother dear, I am here,
 	 I know I have staid very long;
 	 But a little penknife was stuck in my heart,
 	 Till the stream ran down full strong.
 155F.12	 And mother dear, when you go home,
 	 Tell my playfellows all
 	 That I lost my life by leaving them,
 	 When playing that game of ball.
 155F.13	 And ere another day is gone,
 	 My winding-sheet prepare,
 	 And bury me in the green churchyard,
 	 Where the flowers are bloomin fair.
 155F.14	 Lay my Bible at my head,
 	 My Testament at my feet;

 155J.1	 IT rains, it rains in merry Scotland,
 	 Both little, great and small,
 	 And all the schoolfellows in merry Scotland
 	 Must needs go play at ball.
 155J.2	 They tossd the ball so high, so high,
 	 With that it came down so low;
 	 They tossd it over the old Jews gates,
 	 And broke the old Jews window.
 155J.3	 The old Jews daughter she came out,
 	 Was clothed all in green:
 	 Come hither, come hither, you young Sir Hugh,

 155J.4	 I dare not come, nor I will not come,
 	 Without my schoolfellows come all;
 	 For I shall be beaten when I go home

 155J.5	 She  ticed him with an apple so red,
 	 And likewise with a fig;
 	 She threw him over the dresser-board,
 	 And sticked him like a pig.
 155J.6	 The first came out the thickest of blood,
 	 The second came out so thin,
 	 The third came out the childs heart-blood,
 	 Where all his life lay in.
 155J.7	 O spare my life! O spare my life!
 	 O spare my life! said he;
 	 If ever I live to be a young man,

 155J.10	 She went up Lincoln and down Lincoln,

 	 It hails, it rains, both great and small,
 	 And all the little children in Merry-Cock land
 	 They have need to play at ball.
 155K.2	 They tossd the ball so high,
 	 They tossd the ball so low,
 	 Amongst all the Jews cattle,
 	 And amongst the Jews below.
 155K.3	 Out came one of the Jews daughters,
 	 Dressed all in green;
 	 Come, my sweet Saluter,
 	 And fetch the ball again.
 155K.4	 I durst not come, I must not come,
 	 Unless all my little playfellows come along;
 	 For if my mother sees me at the gate,
 	 Shell cause my blood to fall.
 155K.5	 She showd me an apple as green as grass,
 	 She showd me a gay gold ring;
 	 She showd me a cherry as red as blood,
 	 And so she enticd me in
 155K.6	 She took me in the parlor,
 	 She took me in the kitchen,
 	 And there I saw my own dear nurse,
 	 A picking of a chicken.
 155K.7	 She laid me down to sleep,
 	 With a Bible at my head and a Testament at my feet;
 	 And if my playfellows come to quere for me,
 	 Tell them I am asleep.

 155L.1	 IT rains, it hails in merry Lincoln,
 	 It rains both great and small,
 	 And all the boys and girls today
 	 Do play at pat the ball.
 155L.2	 They patted the ball so high, so high,
 	 They patted the ball so low,
 	 They patted it into the Jews garden,
 	 Where all the Jews do go.
 155L.3	 Then out it spake the Jews daughter,
 	 As she leant over the wall;
 	 Come hither, come hither, my pretty playfellow,
 	 And Ill give you your  ball.
 155L.4	 She tempted him [in] with apple so red,
 	 But that wouldnt tempt him in;
 	 She tempted him in with sugar so sweet,
 	 And so she got him in.
 155L.5	 Then she put forth her lilly-white hand,
 	 And led him through the hall:
 	 This way, this way, my pretty play-fellow,
 	 And you shall have your ball.
 155L.6	 She led him on through one chamber,
 	 And so she did through nine,
 	 Until she came to her own chamber,
 	 Where she was wont to dine,
 	 And she laid him on a dressing-board,
 	 And sticket him like a swine.
 155L.7	 Then out it came the thick, thick blood,
 	 And out it came the thin,
 	 And out it came the bonnie hearts blood,
 	 There was no more within.

 155M.1	 DOWN in merry, merry Scotland
 	 It rained both hard and small;
 	 Two little boys went out one day,
 	 All for to play with a ball.
 155M.2	 They tossed it up so very, very high,
 	 They tossed it down so low;
 	 They tossed it into the Jews garden,
 	 Where the flowers all do blow.
 155M.3	 Out came one of the Jews daughters,
 	 Dress d in green all:
 	 If you come here, my fair pretty lad,
 	 You shall have your ball.
 155M.4	 She showed him an apple as green as grass;
 	 The next thing was a fig;
 	 The next thing a cherry as red as blood,
 	 And that would tice him in.
 155M.5	 set him on a golden chair,
 	 And gave him sugar sweet;
 	 Laid him on some golden chest of drawers,
 	 Stabbed him like a sheep.

 155N.1	 IT was on a May, on a midsummers day,
 	 When it rained, it did rain small;
 	 And little Harry Hughes and his playfellows all
 	 Went out to play the ball.
 155N.2	 He knocked it up, and he knocked it down,
 	 He knocked it oer and oer;
 	 The very first kick little Harry gave the ball,
 	 He broke the dukes windows all.
 155N.3	 She came down, the youngest dukes daughter,
 	 She was dressed in green:
 	 Come back, come back, my pretty little boy,
 	 And play the ball again.
 155N.4	 I wont come back, and I darent come back,
 	 Without my playfellows all;
 	 And if my mother she should come in,
 	 Shed make it the bloody ball.
 155N.5	 She took an apple out of her pocket,
 	 And rolled it along the plain;
 	 Little Harry Hughes picked up the apple,
 	 And sorely rued the day.
 155N.6	 She takes him by the lily-white hand,
 	 And leads him from hall to hall,
 	 Until she came to a little dark room,
 	 That no one could hear him call.
 155N.7	 She sat herself on a golden chair,
 	 Him on another close by,
 	 And theres where she pulled out her little penknife,
 	 That was both sharp and fine.
 155N.8	 Little Harry Hughes had to pray for his soul,
 	 For his days were at an end;
 	 She stuck her penknife in little Harrys heart,
 	 And first the blood came very thick, and then came very thin.
 155N.9	 She rolled him in a quire of tin,
 	 That was in so many a fold;
 	 She rolled him from that to a little draw-well,
 	 That was fifty fathoms deep.
 155N.10	 Lie there, lie there, little Harry, she cried,
 	 And God forbid you to swim,
 	 If you be a disgrace to me,
 	 Or to any of my friends.
 155N.11	 The day passed by, and the night came on,
 	 And every scholar was home,
 	 And every mother had her own child,
 	 But poor Harrys mother had none.
 155N.12	 She walked up and down the street,
 	 With a little sally rod in her hand,
 	 And God directed her to the little draw-well,
 	 That was fifty fathoms deep.
 155N.13	 If you be there, little Harry, she said,
 	 And God forbid you to be,
 	 Speak one word to your own dear mother,
 	 That is looking all over for thee.
 155N.14	 This I am, dear mother, he cried,
 	 And lying in great pain,
 	 With a little penknife lying close to my heart,
 	 And the dukes daughter has me slain.
 155N.15	 Give my blessing to my schoolfellows all,
 	 And tell them to be at the church,
 	 And make my grave both large and deep,
 	 And my coffin of hazel and green birch.
 155N.16	 Put my Bible at my head,
 	 My busker (?) at my feet,
 	 My little prayer-book at my right side,
 	 And sound will be my sleep.
