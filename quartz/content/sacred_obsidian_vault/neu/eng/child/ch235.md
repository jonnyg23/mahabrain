 	 Beholding his grooms a coming;
 	 She knew by their livery and raiment so rare
 	 That their last voyage was from London.
 235A.3	 My grooms all, yell be well in call,
 	 Hold all the stables shining;
 	 With a bretther o degs yell clear up my nags,
 	 Sin my gude lord Aboyne is a coming.
 235A.4	 My minstrels all, be well in call,
 	 Hold all my galleries ringing;
 	 With music springs yell try well your strings,
 	 Sin my gude lords a coming.
 235A.5	 My cooks all, be well in call,
 	 Wi pots and spits well ranked;
 	 And nothing shall ye want that ye call for,
 	 Sin my gude Lord Aboynes a coming.
 235A.6	 My chamber-maids, yell dress up my beds,
 	 Hold all my rooms in shining;
 	 With Dantzic waters yell sprinkle my walls,
 	 Sin my good lords a coming.
 235A.7	 Her shoes was of the small cordain,
 	 Her stockings silken twisting;
 	 Cambrick so clear was the pretty ladys smock,
 	 And her stays o the braided sattin.
 235A.8	 Her coat was of the white sarsenent,
 	 Set out wi silver quiltin,
 	 And her gown was o the silk damask,
 	 Set about wi red gold walting.
 235A.9	 Her hair was like the threads of gold,
 	 Wi the silk and sarsanet shining,
 	 Wi her fingers sae white, and the gold rings sae grite,
 	 To welcome her lord from London.
 235A.10	 Sae stately she steppit down the stair,
 	 And walkit to meet him coming;
 	 Said, O yer welcome, my bonny lord,
 	 Yer thrice welcome home from London!
 235A.11	 If this be so that ye let me know,
 	 Yell come kiss me for my coming,
 	 For the morn should hae been my bonny wedding-day
 	 Had I stayed the night in London.
 235A.12	 Then she turned her about wi an angry look,
 	 O for such a sorry woman!
 	 If this be so that ye let me know,
 	 Gang kiss your ladies in London.
 235A.13	 Then he looked ower his left shoulder
 	 To the worthie companie wi him;
 	 Says he, Isna this an unworthy welcome
 	 The weve got, comin from London!

 	 Youll see if hell hae me with him;
 	 And nothing shall he be troubled with me
 	 But myself and my waiting-woman.
 235A.16	 Ive asked it already, lady, he says,
 	 And your humble servant, madam;
 	 But one single mile he winna lat you ride
 	 Wi his company and him to London.
 235A.17	 A year and mare she lived in care,
 	 And docters wi her dealin,
 	 And with a crack her sweet heart brack,
 	 And the letters is on to London.
 235A.18	 When the letters he got, they were all sealed in black,
 	 And he fell in a grievous weeping;
 	 He said, She is dead whom I loved best
 	 If I had but her heart in keepin.
 235A.19	 Then fifteen o the finest lords
 	 That London could afford him,
 	 From their hose to their hat, they were all clad in black,
 	 For the sake of her corpse, Margaret Irvine.
 235A.20	 The furder he gaed, the sorer he wept,
 	 Come keping her corpse, Margaret Irvine.
 	 Until that he came to the yetts of Aboyne,
 	 Where the corpse of his lady was lying.

 	 For if I had staid another day in town
 	 Tomorrow I would hae been married in Lunnon.
 235H.5	 She turned about wi a very saucy look,
 	 As saucy as eer did a woman;
 	 Says, If a be true that Ive heard of you,
 	 You may go back and kiss your whores in Lunnon.
 235H.6	 Go call on Jack, my waiting-man, he said,
 	 Go saddle and make him ready;
 	 For I maun away to the Bughts o Gight,
 	 To speak to the Marquess of Huntly.
 235H.7	 He had not been at the Bughts of the Gight,
 	 Nor the horses yet weel bated,
 	 Until that the letters came ta him
 	 That his lady was newly streeket.
 235H.8	 Waes me, my dear! waes me! he said,
 	 It waes me for my coming;
 	 For I wad rather lost a the Bughts o the Gight
 	 Or I had lost my bonny Peggy Irvine.

 <h3 align="CENTER">235I: The Earl of Aboyne</h3>
 <pre>
 
 235I.1	 THE Earl of Aboyne to London has gone,
 	 And all his nobles with him;
 	 For all the braw ribbands he wore at his hat,
 	 He has left his lady behind him.
 235I.2	 She has to her high castle gane,
 	 To see if she saw him coming;
 	 And who did she spy but her own servant Jack,
 	 Coming riding home again from London.
 235I.3	 What news, what news, my own servant Jack?
 	 What news have you got from London?
 	 Good news, good news, my lady, he says,
 	 For the Earl of Aboyne he is coming.
 235I.4	 She has to her kitchen-maid gane:
 	 Set your pots and your pans all a boiling;
 	 Have every thing fine for gentry to dine,
 	 For the Earl of Aboyne he is coming.
 235I.5	 Stable-grooms all, pray be well employed,
 	 Set your stable-bells all a ringing;
 	 Let your hecks be overlaid with the finest of good hay,
 	 For the Earl of Aboyne he is coming.
 235I.6	 She has to her low gates gane,
 	 To see if she saw him coming,
 	 And long seven miles before they came to town
 	 She heard their bridles ringing.
 235I.7	 Come kiss me, come kiss me, madam, he says,
 	 Come kiss me for my coming,
 	 For the morn should hae been my wedding-day
 	 Had I staid any longer in London.
 235I.8	 Shes turned about with an angry look,
 	 Says, Woes me for thy coming!
 	 If the morn should hae been your wedding-day
 	 Go back and kiss your whores in London.
 235I.9	 Theyve turned their horses heads around,
 	 Their faces all for London;
 	 With their hands to their hats they all rode off,
 	 And theyre all away to London.

 <h3 align="CENTER">235J: The Earl of Aboyne</h3>
 <pre>
 
 235J.1	 THE Earl of Aboyne has up to London gone,
 	 And all his nobles with him,
 	 And three broad letters he sent into his love
 	 He would wed another woman in London.
 235J.2	 She has turned the honey month about,
 	 To see if he was coming,
 	 And lang three miles ere he came to the town
 	 She heard his bridle ringing.
 235J.3	 Shes went down unto the close and shes taen him from his horse,
 	 Says, Yere welcome home from London!
 	 If I be as welcome, dear Peggy, as you say,
 	 Come kiss me for my coming.
 235J.4	 Come kiss me, come kiss me, dear Peggy, he said,
 	 Come kiss me for my coming,
 	 For tomorrow should have been my wedding-day
 	 Had I tarried any longer in London.
 235J.5	 She has turned herself round about,
 	 And she was an angry woman:
 	 If tomorrow should have been your wedding-day,
 	 You may kiss with your sweethearts in London.
 235J.6	 Go saddle me my steed, he said,
 	 Saddle and make him ready;
 	 For I must away to the bonny Bog of Keith,
 	 For to visit the Marquis of Huntley.
 235J.7	 Go ask him, go ask, dear Thomas, she said,
 	 Go ask if hell take me with him;
 	 Ive asked him once, and Ill ask him no more,
 	 For yell never ride a mile in his company.
 235J.8	 Go make to me my bed, she said,
 	 Make it soft and narrow;
 	 For since my true lover has slighted me so,
 	 I will die for him ere morrow.
 235J.9	 She has called her waiting-man,
 	 And Jean her gentlewoman:
 	 Go bring to me a glass of red wine,
 	 For Im as sick as any woman.
 235J.10	 The bed it was not made nor well laid down,
 	 Nor yet the curtains drawn on,
 	 Till stays and gown and all did burst,
 	 And its alace for bonny Peggy Irvine!
 235J.11	 The Earl of Aboyne was not at the Bog of Keith,
 	 Nor met wi the Marquis of Huntley,
 	 Till three broad etters were sent after him
 	 That his pretty Peggy Irvine had left him.
 235J.12	 He gave such a rap on the table where he sat
 	 It made all the room for to tremble:
 	 I would rather I had lost all the rents of Aboyne
 	 Than have lost my pretty Peggy Irvine.
