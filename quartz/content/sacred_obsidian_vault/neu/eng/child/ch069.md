 	Until the day we married be.
 69A.3	For in it will come my seven brothers,
 	And a their torches burning bright;
 	Theyll say, We hae but ae sister,

 	And lowly, lowly lift the gin,
 	And you may say, your oth to save,

 	And yel ty up baith your een,
 	An ye may say, your oth to save,
 	That ye saw na Sandy sen late yestreen.
 69A.6	Yele take me in your armes twa,
 	Yele carrey me ben into your bed,
 	And ye may say, your oth to save,
 	In your bower-floor I never tread.
 69A.7	She has taen the sourde fray his scabbord,
 	And lowly, lowly lifted the gin;
 	She was to swear, her oth to save,
 	She never let Clerk Sanders in.
 69A.8	She has tain a napkin in her hand,
 	And she tyd up baith her eeen;
 	She was to swear, her oth to save,
 	She saw na him sene late yestreen.
 69A.9	She has taen him in her armes twa,
 	And carried him ben into her bed;
 	She was to swear, her oth to save,
 	He never in her bower-floor tread.
 69A.10	In and came her seven brothers,
 	And all their torches burning bright;
 	Says thay, We hae but ae sister,
 	And see there her lying wi a knight.
 69A.11	Out and speaks the first of them,

 	Out an speaks the fourth of them,
 	It wear a sin to kill a sleeping man.
 69A.13	Out an speaks the fifth of them,

 	And he has striped it throw the straw,
 	And throw and throw Clarke Sanders body
 	A wat he has gard cold iron gae.
 69A.16	Sanders he started, an Margret she lapt,
 	Intill his arms whare she lay,
 	And well and wellsom was the night,
 	A wat it was between these twa.
 69A.17	And they lay still, and sleeped sound,
 	Untill the day began to daw;
 	And kindly till him she did say
 	Its time, trew-love, ye wear awa.
 69A.18	They lay still, and sleeped sound,
 	Untill the sun began to shine;
 	She lookt between her and the wa,
 	And dull and heavy was his eeen.
 69A.19	She thought it had been a loathsome sweat,
 	A wat it had fallen this twa between;
 	But it was the blood of his fair body,
 	A wat his life days wair na lang.
 69A.20	O Sanders, Ile do for your sake
 	What other ladys would na thoule;
 	When seven years is come and gone,
 	Theres near a shoe go on my sole.
 69A.21	O Sanders, Ile do for your sake
 	What other ladies would think mare;
 	When seven years is come and gone,
 	Thers nere a comb go in my hair.
 69A.22	O Sanders, Ile do for your sake
 	What other ladies would think lack;
 	When seven years is come an gone,
 	Ile wear nought but dowy black.
 69A.23	The bells gaed clinking throw the towne,
 	To carry the dead corps to the clay,
 	An sighing says her May Margret,
 	A wat I bide a doulfou day.
 69A.24	In an come her father dear,
 	Stout steping on the floor;
 	. . . . .
 	. . . . .
 69A.25	Hold your toung, my doughter dear,
 	Let all your mourning a bee;
 	Ile carry the dead corps to the clay,
 	An Ile come back an comfort thee.
 69A.26	Comfort well your seven sons,
 	For comforted will I never bee;
 	For it was neither lord nor loune
 	That was in bower last night wi mee.

 69E.1	AN ensign and a lady gay,
 	As they were walking on a green,
 	The ensign said to the lady gay,
 	Will you tak me to your bower at een?
 69E.2	I have seven bluidy brithers,
 	Och and to you they have nae good will;
 	And if they catch you in my bower,
 	Theyll value not your bluid to spill.
 69E.3	O you may take me on your back,
 	And carry me to your chamber-bed,
 	That I may swear, and avow richt clear,
 	That your flowery bower I did never tread.
 69E.4	O take a napkin from your pocket,
 	And with it blindfold my een,
 	That I may swear, and avow richt clear,
 	That your flowery bower I have never seen.

 69E.7	They were not well into their bed,
 	Nor were they scarsely fallen asleep,
 	Till in there came her seven bluidy brithers,
 	And placed themselves at the ensigns feet.
 69E.8	Said the first one to the second,
 	Och it is long since this love began;
 	Said the second unto the third,
 	Its a sin to kill a sleeping man.

 69E.11	Out then spoke the seventh bluidy brither,
 	Aye and an angry man was he:
 	Altho there was no more men alive,
 	The ensigns butcher I will be.
 69E.12	Hes taen out his rusty broad-sword,
 	And ran it three times along his throat,
 	And thro and thro the ensigns body
 	The tempered steel it went thro and thro.
 69E.13	O I have dreamed a dream, she said,
 	And such an dreams cannot be good;
 	I dreamed my bower was full of swine,
 	And the ensigns clothes all dipped in blood.
 69E.14	I have dreamed another dream,
 	And such an dreams are never good;
 	That I was combing down my yellow hair,
 	And dipping it in the ensigns blood.
 69E.15	O hold your tongue, my sister dear,
 	And of your weeping let a be;
 	For I will get you a better match
 	Than eer the ensign, what was he?
 69E.16	So woe be to you, my seven bluidy brithers,
 	Aye and an ill death may you die!
 	For you durst not fight him in battle-field,
 	But you killed him sleeping in bed wi me.
 69E.17	Ill do more for my loves sake
 	That other lovers would not incline;
 	Seven years shall come and go
 	Before I wash this face of mine.
 69E.18	I will do for my loves sake
 	What other lovers would not repair;
 	Seven years shall come and go
 	Before I comb down my yellow hair.
 69E.19	Ill do more for my loves sake,
 	What other lovers will not do;
 	Seven years shall come and go
 	Before I cast off stocking and shoe.
 69E.20	I will do for my loves sake
 	What other lovers they will be slack;
 	Seven years shall come and go
 	Before I cast off my robes of black.
 69E.21	Go make to me a high, high tower,
 	Be sure you make it stout and strong,
 	And on the top put an honours gate,
 	That my loves ghost may go out and in.

 69G.4	Yell take my brand I bear in hand,
 	And wi the same yell lift the gin;
 	Then ye may swear, and save your oath,
 	That ye neer let Clerk Sandy in.
 69G.5	Yell take that kurchie on your head,
 	And wi the same tie up your een;
 	And ye will swear, and save your oath,
 	Ye saw not Sandy sin yestreen.
 69G.6	Yell lift me in your arms twa,
 	And carry me unto your bed;
 	Then ye may swear, and save your oath,
 	Clerk Sandy in your bower neer tread.
 69G.7	Shes taen the brand he bare in hand,
 	And wi the same lifted the gin;
 	It was to swear, and save her oath,
 	She never loot Clerk Sandy in.
 69G.8	Shes taen the kurchie frae her head,
 	And wi the same tied up her een;
 	It was to swear, and save her oath,
 	She saw not Sandy sin yestreen.
 69G.9	Shes taen him in her arms twa,
 	And shes carried him to her bed;
 	It was to swear, and save her oath,
 	Clerk Sandie in her bower neer tread.
 69G.10	They hadna kissd, nor love clapped,
 	Like other lovers when they meet,
 	Till in a quarters space and less
 	These two lovers fell sound asleep.
 69G.11	Then in it came her seven brothers,
 	And a their torches burning bright;
 	They said, We hae but ae sister,
 	And here shes lying wi a knight.
 69G.12	O out it speaks the first o them,
 	We will awa and lat them be;
 	Then out it speaks the second o them,
 	His father has nae mair but he.
 69G.13	Out it speaks the third o them,
 	For he was standing on the birk:
 	Nae sweeter coud twa lovers lye,
 	Tho theyd been married in a kirk.
 69G.14	Then out it speaks the fourth o them,
 	Mair fair and lovely is his buke:
 	Our sister dear we cannot blame,
 	Altho in him she pleasure took.
 69G.15	Then out it speaks the fifth o them,
 	It were a sin to do them ill;
 	Then out it spake the sixth o them,
 	Its hard a sleeping man to kill.
 69G.16	But out it speaks the seventh o them,
 	I wish an ill death mat he dee!
 	I wear the sharp brand by my side
 	That soon shall gar Clerk Sandy die.
 69G.17	Then hes taen out his trusty brand,
 	And he has stroakd it ower a strae;
 	And thro and thro Clerk Sandys middle
 	I wat hes gart it come and gae.
 69G.18	The lady slept by her loves side
 	Until the dawning o the day,
 	But what was dune she naething knew,
 	For when she wakd these words did say:
 69G.19	Awake, awake, now Clerk Sandy,
 	Awake, and turn you unto me;
 	Yere nae sae keens ye were at night,
 	When you and I met on the lee.
 69G.20	O then she calld her chamber-maid
 	To bring her coal and candle seen:
 	I fear Clerk Sandys dead eneuch,
 	I had a living man yestreen.
 69G.21	They hae lifted his body up,
 	They hae searched it round and round,
 	And even anent his bonny heart
 	Discovered the deadly wound.
 69G.22	She wrung her hands, and tore her hair,
 	And wrung her hands most bitterlie:
 	This is my fause brothers, I fear,
 	This night hae used this crueltie.
 69G.23	But I will do for my loves sake
 	Woud nae be done by ladies rare;
 	For seven years shall hae an end
 	Or eer a kame gang in my hair.
 69G.24	O I will do for my loves sake
 	What other ladies woud think lack;
 	For seven years shall hae an end
 	Or eer I wear but dowie black.
 69G.25	And I will do for my loves sake
 	What other ladies woudna thole;
 	Seven years shall hae an end
 	Or eer a shoe gang on my sole.
 69G.26	In it came her father dear,
 	And he was belted in a brand;
 	Sae softly as he trad the floor,
 	And in her bower did stately stand.
 69G.27	Says, Hold your tongue, my daughter dear,
 	And yell lat a your mourning be;
 	Ill wed you to a higher match
 	Or eer his fathers son coud be.
 69G.28	Wed well, wed well your seven sons;
 	I wish ill wedded they may be,
 	Sin they hae killd him Clerk Sandy!
 	For wedded shall I never be.
 69G.29	His corpse was laid in the cauld clay,
 	The bells went tinkling thro the town;
 	Alas! alas! said the lady gay,
 	That eer I heard that waefu soun!
 69G.30	When she had sitten intill her bower
 	A twalmonth lang and weary day,
 	Even below her bower-window
 	She heard a ghaist to knock an cry.
 69G.31	She says, Yere thief or bauld robber,
 	Or biggin come to burn or brake;
 	Or are you ony masterfu man,
 	That is come seeking ony make?
 69G.32	I am not thief nor bauld robber,
 	Nor bigging come to burn nor brake;
 	Nor am I ony masterfu man,
 	That is come seeking ony make;
 	But Im Clerk Sandy, your first love,
 	And wants wi you again to speak.
 69G.33	Gin yere Clerk Sandy, my first love,
 	And wants wi me to speak again,
 	Tell me some o the love tokens
 	That you and I had last between.
 69G.34	O mind not ye, ye gay lady,
 	Sin last I was in bower wi thee,
 	That in it came your seven brethren,
 	The youngest gart me sairly dree?
 	Then sighd and said the gay lady,
 	Sae true a tale as ye tell me.
 69G.35	Sae painfully she clam the wa,
 	She clam the wa up after him;
 	Twas not for want of stockings nor sheen,
 	But hadna time to put them on;
 	And in the midst o gude greenwood,
 	Twas there she lost the sight o him.
 69G.36	The lady sat, and mourning there,
 	Until she coudna weep nae mair;
 	At length the cloks and wanton flies
 	They biggit in her yellow hair.
 69G.37	O had your peace, my dearest dear,
 	For I am come to mak you wise;
 	Or this night nine nights come and gang,
 	We baith shall be in Paradise.
