 <h1 align="CENTER">92A: Bonny Bee Hom</h1>
 <pre>
 
 92A.1	BY Arthurs Dale as late I went
 	I heard a heavy moan;
 	I heard a ladie lammenting sair,
 	And ay she cried Ohone!
 92A.2	Ohon, alas! what shall I do,
 	Tormented night and day!
 	I never loved a love but ane,
 	And now hes gone away.
 92A.3	But I will do for my true-love
 	What ladies woud think sair;
 	For seven year shall come and go
 	Ere a kaim gang in my hair.
 92A.4	There shall neither a shoe gang on my foot,
 	Nor a kaim gang in my hair,
 	Nor eer a coal nor candle-light
 	Shine in my bower nae mair.
 92A.5	She thought her love had been on the sea,
 	Fast sailling to Bee Hom;
 	But he was in a quiet chamer,
 	Hearing his ladies moan.
 92A.6	Be husht, be husht, my ladie dear,
 	I pray thee mourn not so;
 	For I am deep sworn on a book
 	To Bee Hom for to go.
 92A.7	She has gien him a chain of the beaten gowd,
 	And a ring with a ruby stone:
 	As lang as this chain your body binds,
 	Your blude can never be drawn.
 92A.8	But gin this ring shoud fade or fail,
 	Or the stone shoud change its hue,
 	Be sure your love is dead and gone,
 	Or she has proved untrue.
 92A.9	He had no been at Bonny Bee Hom
 	A twelve month and a day,
 	Till, looking on his gay gowd ring,
 	The stone grew dark and gray.
 92A.10	O ye take my riches to Bee Hom,
 	And deal them presentlie,
 	To the young that canna, the auld that maunna,
 	And the blind that does not see.
 92A.11	Now death has come into his bower,
 	And split his heart in twain;
 	So their twa souls flew up to heaven,
 	And there shall ever remain.

 <h3 align="CENTER">92B: Bonny Bee Hom</h3>
 <pre>
 
 92B.1	IN Lauderdale I chancd to walk,
 	And heard a ladys moan,
 	Lamenting for her dearest dear,
 	And aye she cried, Ohon!
 92B.2	Sure never a maid that eer drew breath
 	Had harder fate than me;
 	Id never a lad but one on earth,
 	They forcd him to the sea.
 92B.3	The ale shall neer be brewin o malt,
 	Neither by sea nor land,
 	That ever mair shall cross my hause,
 	Till my love comes to hand.
 92B.4	A handsome lad, wi shoulders broad,
 	Gold yellow was his hair;
 	None of our Scottish youths on earth
 	That with him could compare.
 92B.5	She thought her love was gone to sea,
 	And landed in Bahome;
 	But he was in a quiet chamber,
 	Hearing his ladys moan.
 92B.6	Why make ye all this moan, lady?
 	Why make ye all this moan?
 	For Im deep sworn on a book,
 	I must go to Bahome.
 92B.7	Traitors false for to subdue
 	Oer seas Ill make me boun,
 	That have trepand our kind Scotchmen,
 	Like dogs to ding them down.
 92B.8	Weell, take this ring, this royal thing,
 	Whose virtue is unknown;
 	As langs this rings your body on,
 	Your blood shall neer be drawn.
 92B.9	But if this ring shall fade or stain,
 	Or change to other hue,
 	Come never mair to fair Scotland,
 	If yere a lover true.
 92B.10	Then this couple they did part,
 	With a sad heavy moan;
 	The wind was fair, the ship was rare,
 	They landed in Bahome.
 92B.11	But in that place they had not been
 	A month but barely one,
 	Till he lookd on his gay gold ring,
 	And riven was the stone.
 92B.12	Time after this was not expird
 	A month but scarcely three,
 	Till black and ugly was the ring,
 	And the stone was burst in three.
 92B.13	Fight on, fight on, you merry men all,
 	With you Ill fight no more;
 	I will gang to some holy place,
 	Pray to the King of Glore.
 92B.14	Then to the chapel he is gone,
 	And knelt most piteouslie,
 	For seven days and seven nights,
 	Till blood ran frae his knee.
 92B.15	Yell take my jewels thats in Bahome,
 	And deal them liberallie,
 	To young that cannot, and old that mannot,
 	The blind that does not see.
 92B.16	Give maist to women in child-bed laid,
 	Can neither fecht nor flee;
 	I hope shes in the heavens high,
 	That died for love of me.
 92B.17	The knights they wrang their white fingers,
 	The ladies tore their hair;
 	The women that neer had children born,
 	In swoon they down fell there.
 92B.18	But in what way the knight expird,
 	No tongue will eer declare;
 	So this doth end my mournful song,
 	From me yell get nae mair.
