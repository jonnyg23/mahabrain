 <h1 align="CENTER">124A: The Jolly Pindar of Wakefield</h1>
 <pre>
 
 124A.1	 IN Wakefield there lives a jolly pinder,
 	 In Wakefield, all on a green;
 	 In Wakefield, all on a green;
 124A.2	 There is neither knight nor squire, said the pinder,
 	 Nor baron that is so bold,
 	 Nor baron that is so bold,
 	 Dare make a trespasse to the town of Wakefield,
 	 But his pledge goes to the pinfold.
 	 But his pledge goes to the pinfold.
 124A.3	 All this beheard three witty young men,
 	 Twas Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John;
 	 With that they spyed the jolly pinder,
 	 As he sate under a thorn.
 124A.4	 Now turn again, turn again, said the pinder,
 	 For a wrong way have you gone;
 	 For you have forsaken the king his highway,
 	 And made a path over the corn.
 124A.5	 O that were great shame, said jolly Robin,
 	 We being three, and thou but one:
 	 The pinder leapt back then thirty good foot,
 	 Twas thirty good foot and one.
 124A.6	 He leaned his back fast unto a thorn,
 	 And his foot unto a stone,
 	 And there he fought a long summers day,
 	 A summers day so long,
 	 Till that their swords, on their broad bucklers,
 	 Were broken fast unto their hands.
 	 * * * * *
 124A.7	 Hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said Robin Hood,
 	 And my merry men euery one;
 	 For this is one of the best pinders
 	 That ever I tryd with sword.
 124A.8	 And wilt thou forsake thy pinder his craft,
 	 And live in [the] green wood with me?
 	 . . . .
 	 . . . .
 124A.9	 At Michaelmas next my covnant comes out,
 	 When every man gathers his fee;
 	 Ile take my blew blade all in my hand,
 	 And plod to the green wood with thee.
 124A.10	 Hast thou either meat or drink, said Robin Hood,
 	 For my merry men and me?
 	 . . . .
 	 . . . .
 124A.11	 I have both bread and beef, said the pinder,
 	 And good ale of the best;
 	 And that is meat good enough, said Robin Hood,
 	 For such unbidden guest.
 124A.12	 wilt thou forsake the pinder his craft,
 	 And go to the green wood with me?
 	 Thou shalt have a livery twice in the year,
 	 The one green, the other brown [shall be].
 124A.13	 If Michaelmas day were once come and gone
 	 And my master had paid me my fee,
 	 Then would I set as little by him
 	 As my master doth set by me.

 	 For my merrymen and me?

 	 Thats cheere good enoughe, said Robin,
 	 For any such vnbidden guest.
 124B.4	 But wilt be my man? said good Robin,
 	 And come and dwell with me?
 	 And twise in a yeere thy clothing [shall] be changed
 	 If my man thou wilt bee,
 	 The tone shall be of light Lincolne greene,
 	 The tother of Picklory.
 124B.5	 Att Michallmas comes a well good time,
 	 When men haue gotten in their fee;
 	 Ile sett as litle by my master
 	 As he now setts by me,
 	 Ile take my benbowe in my hande,
 	 And come into the grenwoode to thee.
