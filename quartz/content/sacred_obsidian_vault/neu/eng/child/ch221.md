 	 And swords flew in the skies,
 	 And droop and drowsie was the blood
 	 Ran our yon lilly braes.
 221B.14	 The blood ran our the lilly bank,
 	 And our the lilly brae,
 	 And sighing said the bonny bride,
 	 A, waes me for foul play!
 221B.15	 My blessing on your heart, sweet thing,
 	 Wae to your wilfu will!
 	 So many a gallant gentlemans blood
 	 This day as yeve garred spill.
 221B.16	 But a you that is norland men,

 221G.2	 Long time she lood him very well,
 	 But they changed her mind away,
 	 And now she goes anothers bride,

 	 For losing of a lady fair
 	 That he did love so true.
 221G.6	 But if I were young Lochinvar,

 221G.15	 Did he eer see such pretty men
 	 As were there in array?
 	 O yes, said he, a+e Fairy Court

 	 And by the grass-green sleeve,
 	 Pulld her on horseback him behind,
 	 At her friends askd nae leave.
 221G.20	 Syne rode the water with great speed,
 	 And merrily the knows;
 	 There fifty from the bridal came-+--+-
 	 Indeed it was nae mows-+--+-
 221G.21	 Thinking to take the bride again,
 	 Thro strangth if that they may;
 	 But still he gart the trumpet sound
 	 The voice of foul play.
 221G.22	 There were four and twenty ladies fair
 	 All walking on the lea;
 	 He gave to them the bonny bride,
 	 And bade them boun their way.
 221G.23	 They splintered the spears in pieces now,
 	 And the blades flew in the sky,
 	 But the bonny laird of Lochinvar
 	 Has gained the victory.
 221G.24	 Many a wife- and widows son
 	 Lay gasping on the ground,

 	 And all the rest of her kin,
 	 And he has told the lass hersel,
 	 And her kind favour has won.
 221H.4	 At length the laird of Laughenwaur
 	 Came frae the English border,
 	 And all to court that pretty girl,
 	 Well mounted in good order.
 221H.5	 He told her father, so did he her mother,
 	 As I heard people say,
 	 But he ner told the lass hersel,
 	 Till on her wedding-day.
 221H.6	 But when the wedding-day was fixed,
 	 And married for to be,
 	 Then Lamington came to the town,
 	 The bridegroom for to see.
 221H.7	 O are ye come for sport, sir?  he said,
 	 Or are ye come for play?
 	 Or are ye for a sight o my bonny bride,
 	 Upon her wedding-day?
 221H.8	 Am neither come for sport, sir, he said,
 	 Nor am I come for play,
 	 But if I had one word o the bride
 	 Id mount and go away.
 221H.9	 There was a cup of the good red wine
 	 Was filled out them between,
 	 And aye she drank to Lammington,
 	 Who her true-love had been.
 221H.10	 Hes taen her by the milk-white hand,
 	 And by the grass-green sleeve;
 	 Hes mounted her behind him then,
 	 At the bridegroom speered no leave.
 221H.11	 The blood ran down by Cowden banks,
 	 And down by Cowden brae,
 	 And aye they gaured the piper play
 	 It was a foul, foul play.
 221H.12	 Ye gentlemen of Lochenwaur,
 	 Thats laigh in England born,
 	 Come ner to Scotland to court a wife,
 	 Or be sure yel get the scorn.
 221H.13	 Thell keep ye up, and tamper ye at,
 	 Until yer wedding-day,
 	 And theyl gie ye frogs instead o fish,
 	 And theyll play ye a foul play.

 221I.1	 IN Bordershellin there did dwell
 	 A comely, handsome may,
 	 And Lochinvar he courted her,
 	 And stole her heart away.
 221I.2	 She loved him but owre weel,
 	 And his love drew away;
 	 Another man then courted her,
 	 And set the wedding-day,
 221I.3	 They set the wedding-day so plain,
 	 As plain as it might be;
 	 She sent a letter to her former love,
 	 The wedding to come see.
 221I.4	 When Lochinvar the letter read,
 	 He sent owre a his land
 	 For four and twenty beltit knichts,
 	 To come at his command.
 221I.5	 They all came to his hand, I say,
 	 Upon that wedding-day;
 	 He set them upon milk-white steeds,
 	 And put them in array.
 221I.6	 He set them in array, I say,
 	 Most pleasant to be seen,
 	 And hes awa to the wedding-house,
 	 A single man his lane.
 221I.7	 And when he was to the wedding-house come,
 	 They wee all sitten down;
 	 Baith gentlemen and knichts was there,
 	 And lords of high renown.
 221I.8	 They saluted him, baith auld and young,
 	 Speired how he had spent the day,
 	 And what young Lankashires was yon
 	 They saw all in array.
 221I.9	 But he answerd them richt scornfullie,
 	 Upon their wedding-day;
 	 He says, Its been some Fairy Court
 	 Yeve seen all in array.
 221I.10	 Then rose up the young bridegroom,
 	 And an angry man was he:
 	 Lo, art thou come to fight, young man?
 	 Indeed Ill fight wi thee.
 221I.11	 O I am not come to fight, he sayd,
 	 But good fellowship to hae,
 	 And for to drink the wine sae red,
 	 And then Ill go away.
 221I.12	 Then they filld him up a brimming glass,
 	 And drank it between them twa:
 	 Now one word of your bonnie bride,
 	 And then Ill go my wa.
 221I.13	 But some were friends, and some were faes,
 	 Yet nane o them was free
 	 To let the bride on her wedding-day
 	 Gang out o their companie.
 221I.14	 But he took her by the milk-white hand,
 	 And by the grass-green sleeve,
 	 And set her on a milk-white steed,
 	 And at nane o them speerd he leave.
 221I.15	 Then the blood ran down the Caylin bank,
 	 And owre the Caylin brae;
 	 The auld folks knew something o the sport,
 	 Which gart them cry, Foul play!
 221I.16	 Ye lusty lads of Limberdale,
 	 Tho ye be English born,
 	 Come nae mair to Scotland to court a maid,
 	 For fear ye get the scorn.
 221I.17	 For fear that ye do get the scorn
 	 Upon your wedding-day;
 	 Least ye catch frogs instead of fish,
 	 And then yell cat foul play.

 221J.1	 THERE was a lass, as I heard say,
 	 Lived low down in a glen;
 	 Her name was Catharine Johnson,
 	 Weel known to many men.
 221J.2	 Doun cam the laird o Lamingtoun,
 	 Doun frae the South Countrie,
 	 And he is for this bonnie lass,
 	 Her bridegroom for to be.
 221J.3	 Hes askd her father and mother,
 	 The chief of a her kin,
 	 And then he askd the bonnie lass,
 	 And did her favour win.
 221J.4	 Doun cam an Ehglish gentleman,
 	 Doun frae the English border;
 	 He is for this bonnie lass,
 	 To keep his house in order.
 221J.5	 He askd her father and mother,
 	 As I do them say,
 	 But he never askd the lass hersell,
 	 Till on her wedding-day.
 221J.6	 But she has wrote a lang letter,
 	 And sealed it wi her hand,
 	 And sent it to Lord Lamington,
 	 To let him understand.
 221J.7	 The first line o the letter he read,
 	 He was baith glad and fain;
 	 But or he read the letter owre
 	 He was baith pale and wan.
 221J.8	 Then he has sent a messenger,
 	 And out through all his land,
 	 And four-and-twenty armed men
 	 Was all at his command.
 221J.9	 But he has left his merry men,
 	 Left them on the lea;
 	 And hes awa to the wedding-house,
 	 To see what he could see.
 221J.10	 But when he came to the wedding-house,
 	 As I do understand,
 	 There were four-and-twenty belted knights
 	 Sat at a table round.
 221J.11	 They rose all for to honour him,
 	 For he was of high renown;
 	 They rose all for to welcome him,
 	 And bade him to sit doun.
 221J.12	 O meikle was the good red wine
 	 In silver cups did flow,
 	 But aye she drank to Lamingtoun,
 	 For with him would she go.
 221J.13	 O meikle was the good red wine
 	 In silver cups gaed round,
 	 At length they began to whisper words,
 	 None could them understand.
 221J.14	 O came ye here for sport, young man?
 	 Or cam ye here for play?
 	 Or cam ye for our bonnie bride,
 	 On this her wedding-day?
 221J.15	 I came not here for sport, he said,
 	 Neither did I for play;
 	 But for one word o your bonnie bride
 	 Ill mount and ride away.
 221J.16	 They set her maids behind her,
 	 To hear what they would say,
 	 But the first question he askd at her
 	 Was always [answered] nay;
 	 The next question he askd at her
 	 Was, Mount and come away.
 221J.17	 Its up the Couden bank,
 	 And doun the Couden brae;
 	 And aye she made the trumpet sound,
 	 Its a weel won play.
 221J.18	 O meikle was the blood was shed
 	 Upon the Couden brae;
 	 And aye she made the trumpet sound,
 	 Its a fair play.
 221J.19	 Come, all ye English gentlemen,
 	 That is of England born,
 	 Come nae doun to Scotland,
 	 For fear ye get the scorn.
 221J.20	 Theyll feed ye up wi flattering words,
 	 And thats fair play;
 	 And theyll dress ye frogs instead o fish,
 	 Just on your wedding-day.

 221K.1	 THERE lives a lass in yonder dale,
 	 In yon bonny borrows-town,
 	 Her name it is Catherine Jeffrey,
 	 She is loved by mony a ane.
 221K.2	 Lord Lochinvar has courted her
 	 These twelve months and a day;
 	 With flattering words and fair speeches
 	 He has stown her heart away.
 221K.3	 There came a knight from south sea-bank,
 	 From north England I mean,
 	 He alighted at her fathers yetts,
 	 His stile is Lord Lymington.
 221K.4	 He has courted her father and moth
 	 Her kinsfolk ane and aye,
 	 But he never told the lady hersell
 	 Till he set the wedding-day.
 221K.5	 Prepare, prepare, my daughter dear,
 	 Prepare, to you I say;
 	 For the night it is good Wednesday night,
 	 And the morn is your wedding-day.
 221K.6	 O tell to me, father, she said,
 	 O tell me who it is wi;
 	 For Ill never wed a man on earth
 	 Till I know what he be.
 221K.7	 Hes come a knight from the south sea-bank,
 	 From north England I mean,
 	 For when he lighted  at my yetts,
 	 His stile is Lord Lymington.
 221K.8	 O where will I get a bonny boy
 	 Will win baith meet and fee,
 	 And will run on to Lochinvar
 	 And come again to me?
 221K.9	 O here am I, a bonny boy
 	 That will win baith hose and sheen,
 	 And will run on to Lochinvar,
 	 And come right seen again.
 221K.10	 Where ye find the brigs broken,
 	 Bend your bow and swim;
 	 Where ye find the grass growing,
 	 Slack your bow and run.
 221K.11	 When ye come on to Lochinvar,
 	 Byde not to chap nor ca,
 	 But set your bent bow to your breast
 	 And lightly loup the wa.
 221K.12	 Bid him mind the words he last spake,
 	 When we sendered on the lee;
 	 Bid him saddle and ride full fast,
 	 If he be set for me.
 221K.13	 Where he found the brigs broken,
 	 He bent his bow and swam;
 	 Where he found the grass growing,
 	 He slackt his bow and ran.
 221K.14	 When he came on to Lochinvar,
 	 Ge did not chap nor ca;
 	 He set his bentbow till his breast
 	 And lightly leapt the wa.
 221K.15	 What news? what news, my bonny boy?
 	 What news have ye to me?
 	 Bad news, bad news, my lord, he said,
 	 Your lady awa will be.
 221K.16	 Your bidden mind the words ye last spake,
 	 When we sendered on the lee;
 	 Your bidden saddle and ride full fast,
 	 Gin ye set for her be.
 221K.17	 When he came to her fathers yetts,
 	 There he alighted down;
 	 The cups of gold of good red wine
 	 Were going roun and roun.
 221K.18	 Now came ye here for sport? they said,
 	 Or came ye here for play?
 	 Or for a sight of our bonny bride,
 	 And then to boun your way?
 221K.19	 I came not here for sport, he says,
 	 Nor came I here for play,
 	 But if I had a sight of your bonny bride
 	 Then I will boun my way.
 221K.20	 When Lymington he called on her,
 	 She would not come at a,
 	 But Lochinvar he called on her,
 	 And she was not sweer to draw.
 221K.21	 He has taen her by the milk-white hand,
 	 And by her silken sleeve,
 	 He has mounted her high him behind,
 	 He spiered nae mair their leave.
 221K.22	 And aye she scoffed and scorned them,
 	 And aye she rode away,
 	 And aye she gart the trumpet sound
 	 The voice of foul play,
 	 To take the bride frae her bridegroom
 	 Upon her wedding-day.
 221K.23	 As they came in by Foudlin dyke,
 	 And in by Foudlin stane,
 	 There were mony gallant Englishmen
 	 Lay gasping on the green.
 221K.24	 Now a you that are English lords,
 	 And are in England born,
 	 Come never here to court your brides,
 	 For fear ye get the scorn.
 221K.25	 For aye theyll scoff and scorn you,
 	 And aye theyll ride away;
 	 Theyll gie you frogs instead of fish,
 	 And call it foul play.
