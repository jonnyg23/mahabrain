 <h1 align="CENTER">93A: Lamkin</h1>
 <pre>
 
 93A.1	ITS Lamkin was a mason good
 	As ever built wi stane;
 	He built Lord Wearies castle,
 	But payment got he nane.
 93A.2	O pay me, Lord Wearie,
 	come, pay me my fee:
 	I canna pay you, Lamkin,
 	For I maun gang oer the sea.
 93A.3	O pay me now, Lord Wearie,
 	Come, pay me out o hand:
 	I canna pay you, Lamkin,
 	Unless I sell my land.
 93A.4	O gin ye winna pay me,
 	I here sall mak a vow,
 	Before that ye come hame again,
 	ye sall hae cause to rue.
 93A.5	Lord Wearie got a bonny ship,
 	to sail the saut sea faem;
 	Bade his lady weel the castle keep,
 	ay till he should come hame.
 93A.6	But the nourice was a fause limmer
 	as eer hung on a tree;
 	She laid a plot wi Lamkin,
 	whan her lord was oer the sea.
 93A.7	She laid a plot wi Lamkin,
 	when the servants were awa,
 	Loot him in at a little shot-window,
 	and brought him to the ha.
 93A.8	O whares a the men o this house,
 	that ca me Lamkin?
 	Theyre at the barn-well thrashing;
 	twill be lang ere they come in.
 93A.9	And whares the women o this house,
 	that ca me Lamkin?
 	Theyre at the far well washing;
 	twill be lang ere they come in.
 93A.10	And whares the bairns o this house,
 	that ca me Lamkin?
 	Theyre at the school reading;
 	twill be night or they come hame.
 93A.11	O whares the lady o this house,
 	that cas me Lamkin?
 	Shes up in her bower sewing,
 	but we soon can bring her down.
 93A.12	Then Lamkins tane a sharp knife,
 	that hang down by his gaire,
 	And he has gien the bonny babe
 	A deep wound and a sair.
 93A.13	Then Lamkin he rocked,
 	and the fause nourice sang,
 	Till frae ilkae bore o the cradle
 	the red blood out sprang.
 93A.14	Then out it spak the lady,
 	as she stood on the stair:
 	What ails my bairn, nourice,
 	that hes greeting sae sair?
 93A.15	O still my bairn, nourice,
 	O still him wi the pap!
 	He winna still, lady,
 	for this nor for that.
 93A.16	O still my bairn, nourice,
 	O still him wi the wand!
 	He winna still, lady,
 	for a his fathers land.
 93A.17	O still my bairn, nourice,
 	O still him wi the bell!
 	He winna still, lady,
 	till ye come down yoursel.
 93A.18	O the firsten step she steppit,
 	she steppit on a stane;
 	But the neisten step she steppit,
 	she met him Lamkin.
 93A.19	O mercy, mercy, Lamkin,
 	hae mercy upon me!
 	Though youve taen my young sons life,
 	Ye may let mysel be.
 93A.20	O sall I kill her, nourice,
 	or sall I lat her be?
 	O kill her, kill her, Lamkin,
 	for she neer was good to me.
 93A.21	O scour the bason, nourice,
 	and mak it fair and clean,
 	For to keep this ladys hearts blood,
 	For shes come o noble kin.
 93A.22	There need nae bason, Lamkin,
 	lat it run through the floor;
 	What better is the hearts blood
 	o the rich than o the poor?
 93A.23	But ere three months were at an end,
 	Lord Wearie came again;
 	But dowie, dowie was his heart
 	when first he came hame.
 93A.24	O whas blood is this, he says,
 	That lies in the chamer?
 	It is your ladys hearts blood;
 	tis as clear as the lamer.
 93A.25	And whas blood is this, he says,
 	That lies in my ha?
 	It is your young sons hearts blood;
 	tis the clearest ava.
 93A.26	O sweetly sang the black-bird
 	that sat upon the tree;
 	But sairer grat Lamkin,
 	when he was condemnd to die.
 93A.27	And bonny sang the mavis,
 	Out o the thorny brake;
 	But sairer grat the nourice,
 	when she was tied to the stake.

 93B.1	BALANKIN was as gude a mason
 	as eer picked a stane;
 	He built up Prime Castle,
 	but payment gat nane.
 93B.2	The lord said to his lady,
 	when he was going abroad,
 	O beware of Balankin,
 	for he lyes in the wood.
 93B.3	The gates they were bolted,
 	baith outside and in;
 	At the sma peep of a window
 	Blankin crap in.
 93B.4	Good morrow, good morrow,
 	said Lambert Linkin:
 	Good morrow to yoursell, sir,
 	said the false nurse to him.
 93B.5	O where is your good lord?
 	said Lambert Linkin:
 	Hes awa to New England,
 	to meet with his king.
 93B.6	O where is his auld son?
 	said Lambert Linkin:
 	Hes awa to buy pearlings,
 	Gin our lady lye in.
 93B.7	Then shell never wear them,
 	said Lambert Linkin:
 	And that is nae pity,
 	said the false nurse to him.
 93B.8	O where is your lady?
 	said Lambert Linkin:
 	Shes in her bower sleeping,
 	said the false nurse to him.
 93B.9	How can we get at her?
 	said Lambert Linkin:
 	Stab the babe to the heart,
 	wi a silver bokin.
 93B.10	That would be a pity,
 	said Lambert Linkin:
 	No pity, no pity,
 	said the false nurse to him.
 93B.11	Balankin he rocked,
 	and the false nurse she sang,
 	Till all the tores of the cradle
 	wi the red blood down ran.
 93B.12	O still my babe, nurice,
 	O still him wi the knife!
 	Hell no be still, lady,
 	tho I lay doun my life.
 93B.13	O still my babe, nurice,
 	O still him wi the kame!
 	Hell be no still, lady,
 	till his daddy come hame.
 93B.14	O still my babe, nurice,
 	O still him wi the bell!
 	Hell no be still, lady,
 	till ye come doun yoursell.
 93B.15	Its how can I come down,
 	this cauld winter nicht,
 	Without eer a coal,
 	or a clear candle-licht?
 93B.16	Theres two smocks in your coffer,
 	as white as a swan;
 	Put one of them about you,
 	it will shew you licht down.
 93B.17	She took ane o them about her,
 	and came tripping doun;
 	But as soon as she viewed,
 	Balankin was in.
 93B.18	Good morrow, good morrow,
 	said Lambert Linkin:
 	Good morrow to yoursell, sir,
 	said the lady to him.
 93B.19	O save my life, Balankin,
 	till my husband come back,
 	And Ill gie you as much red gold
 	as youll hold in your hat.
 93B.20	Ill not save your life, lady,
 	till your husband come back,
 	Tho you would give me as much red gold
 	as I could hold in a sack.
 93B.21	Will I kill her? quo Balankin,
 	will I kill her, or let her be?
 	You may kill her, said the false nurse,
 	She was neer good to me;
 	And yell be laird of the castle,
 	and Ill be ladie.
 93B.22	Then he cut aff her head
 	fram her lily breast-bane,
 	And he hungt up in the kitchen,
 	it made a the ha shine.
 93B.23	The lord sat in England,
 	a drinking the wine:
 	I wish a may be weel
 	with my lady at hame;
 	For the rings of my fingers
 	there now burst in twain!
 93B.24	He saddled his horse,
 	and he came riding doun,
 	But as soon as he viewed,
 	Balankin was in.
 93B.25	He had na weel stepped
 	twa steps up the stair,
 	Till he saw his pretty young son
 	lying dead on the floor.
 93B.26	He had not weel stepped
 	other twa up the stair,
 	Till he saw his pretty lady
 	lying dead in despair.
 93B.27	He hanged Balankin
 	out over the gate,
 	And he burnt the fause nurice,
 	being under the grate.

 93C.1	LAMERLINKIN, as gude a mason
 	as eer laid a stane,
 	Built a house to Lord Arran,
 	but entrance had nane.
 93C.2	Says the lord to his lady,
 	when going abroad,
 	Take care of Lamerlinkin,
 	wha bides in the wood.
 93C.3	I care not for Lamkin,
 	nor none of his kin;
 	My house is plastered outside,
 	and bolted within.
 93C.4	The gates they were locked,
 	baith outside and in,
 	But there was a wee hole
 	that let Lamkin creep in.
 93C.5	Good woman, good woman,
 	said Lamerlinkin:
 	Good woman, good woman,
 	said the fause nurse to him.
 93C.6	Wheres the lord o this house?
 	is he not within?
 	Hes up in Old England,
 	hes dining wi the king.
 93C.7	Wheres the lady of this house?
 	or is she not within?
 	Shes up in her high room,
 	and cannot come down.
 93C.8	Where is the maids o this house?
 	or are they not within?
 	They are at the well washing,
 	and cannot get in.
 93C.9	Where is the men o this house?
 	or are they not within?
 	They are at the barn threshing,
 	and cannot win hame.
 93C.10	O what will I do,
 	to mak her come doun?
 	Well kill her auld son,
 	to mak her come doun.
 93C.11	He took out a pen-knife,
 	baith pointed and sharp,
 	And he stabbed the babie
 	three times in the heart.
 93C.12	Lamerlinkin did rock,
 	and the fause nurse did sing;
 	Ower the four-cornered cradle
 	the red blood did spring.
 93C.13	O please my babie, nurse,
 	O please him wi wands!
 	Hell no be pleased, madam,
 	for a his fathers lands.
 93C.14	O please my babie, nurse,
 	O please him wi keys!
 	Hell no be pleased, madam,
 	let me do what I please.
 93C.15	O please my babie, nurse,
 	O please him with bells!
 	Hell no be pleased, madam,
 	till you come down yoursell.
 93C.16	How can I come doun
 	this cold frosty night,
 	Without coal or candle
 	for to shew me light?
 93C.17	The gold rings on your finger
 	are bright as the sun;
 	You may see to cum doun the stair
 	with the light o them.
 93C.18	O then she came doun the stair,
 	stepping step by step;
 	So ready was Lamkin
 	to grip her in his lap.
 93C.19	Save my life, Lamkin,
 	till five minutes break,
 	And Ill give thee gold,
 	the fu o a peck.
 93C.20	Ill no save your life,
 	till five minutes break,
 	Tho thou should give me gold,
 	the fu of a sack.
 93C.21	O Jeany, O Jeany,
 	O scour the bason clean,
 	That your ladys noble blood
 	may be kepped clean.
 93C.22	O no, no, no, Lambkin,
 	my heart will be sare;
 	O take my life, Lambkin,
 	let my lady go.
 	* * * * *
 93C.23	He sent for the false nurse,
 	to give her her fee;
 	All the fee that he gave her
 	was to hang her on a tree.
 93C.24	sent for Lamerlinkin,
 	to give him his hire;
 	All the hire that he gave him
 	was to burn him in the fire.

 93D.1	SAID the lord to his lady,
 	Beware of Rankin;
 	For I am going to England,
 	to wait on the king.
 93D.2	No fears, no fears,
 	said the lady, said she,
 	For the doors shall be bolted,
 	and the windows pindee.
 93D.3	Go bar all the windows,
 	both outside and in;
 	Dont leave a window open,
 	to let Bold Rankin in.
 93D.4	She has barred all the windows,
 	both outside and in;
 	But she left one of them open,
 	to let Bold Rankin in.
 93D.5	O where is the master of this house?
 	said Bold Rankin;
 	Hes up in Old England.
 	said the false nurse to him.
 93D.6	O where is the mistress of this house?
 	said Bold Rankin;
 	Shes up in the chamber sleeping,
 	said the false nurse to him.
 93D.7	O how shall we get her down?
 	said Bold Rankin;
 	By piercing the baby,
 	said the false nurse to him.
 93D.8	Go please the baby, nursy,
 	go please it with a bell;
 	It will not be pleased, madam,

 93D.9	How can I come down stairs,

 	to shew me the light?
 93D.10	There is a silver bolt
 	lies on the chest-head;
 	Give it to the baby,
 	give it sweet milk and bread.
 93D.11	She rammed the silver bolt
 	up the babys nose,
 	Till the blood it came trinkling
 	down the babys fine clothes.
 93D.12	Go please the baby, nursie,
 	go please it with the bell:
 	It will not please, madam,

 93D.14	The first step she stepit,
 	she steppit on a stone;
 	And the next step she stepit,
 	she met Bold Rankin.
 93D.15	O rankin, O Rankin,

 	And I will give you as many guineas
 	as you can carry on your back.
 93D.16	What care I for as many guineas

 93D.17	O will I kill her, nursie,

 	O kill her, said the false nurse,
 	She was never good to me.
 93D.18	Go scour the bason, lady,
 	both outside and in,
 	To hold your mothers hearts blood,

 93D.19	To hold my mothers hearts blood

 93D.20	Go scour the bason, servants,

 	and gar the blood to shed.
 93D.24	Shes none of my comrades,

 	Ram in the knife, Bold Rankin,
 	and gar the blood rin.
 93D.25	O will I kill her, nursy,

 	O kill her, said the false nurse,

 93D.26	I wish my wife and family

 	For the silver buttons of my coat

 93D.27	As Betsy was looking
 	oer her window so high,
 	She saw her dear father
 	come riding by.
 93D.28	O father, dear father,
 	dont put the blame on me
 	It was false nurse and Rankin
 	that killed your lady.
 93D.29	O wasnt that an awful sight,
 	when he came to the stair,
 	To see his fairest lady
 	lie bleeding there!
 93D.30	The false nurse was burnt
 	on the mountain hill-head,
 	And Rankin was boiled
 	in a pot full of lead.

 93E.1	LAMBKIN was as good a mason
 	as ever laid stone;
 	He builded Lord Montgomerys castle,
 	but payment got none.
 93E.2	He builded the castle
 	without and within;
 	But he left an open wake
 	for himself to get in.
 93E.3	Lord Montgomery said to his lady,
 	when he went abroad,
 	Take care of Bold Lambkin,
 	for he is in the wood.
 93E.4	Gar bolt the gate, nourice,
 	without and within,
 	Leave not the wake open,
 	to let Bold Lambkin in.
 93E.5	She bolted the gates,
 	without and within,
 	But she left the wake open,
 	to let Bold Lambkin in.
 93E.6	Gude morrow, gude morrow,
 	says Bold Lambkin then;
 	Gude morrow, gude morrow,
 	says the false nurse to him.
 93E.7	Where is Lord Montgomery?
 	or where is he gone?
 	He is gone up to England,
 	to wait on the king!
 93E.8	Where are the servants?
 	and where are they gone?
 	They are all up to England,
 	to wait upon him.
 93E.9	Where is your lady?
 	or where is she gone?
 	She is in her bower sitting,
 	and sewing her seam.
 93E.10	O what shall we do
 	for to make her come down?
 	Well kill the pretty baby,
 	thats sleeping so sound.
 93E.11	Lambkin he rocked,
 	and the false nurse she sung,
 	And she stabbed the babe to the heart
 	with a silver bodkin.
 93E.12	O still my babe, nourice,
 	O still him with the pap:
 	Hell no be stilled, madam,
 	for this nor for that.
 93E.13	O still my babe, nourice,
 	go still him with the keys:
 	Hell no be stilled, madam,

 93E.14	O still my babe, nourice,
 	go still him with the bell:
 	Hell no be stilled, madam,
 	till you come down yoursel.
 93E.15	How can I come down,
 	this cold winter night,
 	When theres neither coal burning,
 	nor yet candle-light?
 93E.16	The sark on your back
 	is whiter than the swan;
 	Come down the stair, lady,
 	by the light of your hand.
 93E.17	The lady she cam down
 	the stair trip for trap;
 	Who so ready as Bold Lambkin
 	to meet her in the dark?
 93E.18	Gude morrow, gude morrow,
 	said Bold Lambkin then;
 	Gude morrow, gude morrow,
 	said the lady to him.
 93E.19	O where is Lord Montgomery?
 	or where is he gone?
 	O he is up to England,

 93E.20	O where are your servants?
 	or where are they gone?
 	They are all up to England,

 93E.21	Ill give you as much gold, Lambkin,
 	as youll put in a peck,
 	If youll spare my life
 	till my lord comes back.
 93E.22	Tho you would [give] me as much
 	as I could put in a sack,
 	I would not spare thy life
 	till thy lord comes back.
 93E.23	Lord Montgomery sate in England,
 	drinking with the king;
 	The buttons flew off his coat,
 	all in a ring.
 93E.24	God prosper, God prosper
 	my lady and son!
 	For before I get home
 	they will all be undone.

 93F.1	SAID my lord to his ladye,

 93F.2	Said my lord to his ladye,
 	as he rode away,
 	Take care of Long Lankyn,
 	who lies in the clay.
 93F.3	Let the doors be all bolted,
 	and the windows all pinned,
 	And leave not a hole
 	for a mouse to creep in.
 93F.4	Then he kissed his fair ladye,
 	and he rode away;
 	He must be in London
 	before break of day.
 93F.5	The doors were all bolted,
 	and the windows were pinned,
 	All but one little window,
 	where Long Lankyn crept in.
 93F.6	Where is the lord of this house?

 	He is gone to fair London,
 	said the false nurse to him.
 93F.7	Where is the ladye of this house?

 93F.8	Where is the heir of this house?

 93F.9	Well prick him, and prick him,

 93F.10	So she pricked him and pricked,
 	all over with a pin,
 	And the nurse held a basin
 	for the blood to run in.
 93F.11	Oh nurse, how you sleep!
 	Oh nurse, how you snore!
 	And you leave my little son Johnstone
