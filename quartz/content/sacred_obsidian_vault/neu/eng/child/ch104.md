 <h1 align="CENTER">104A: Prince Heathen</h1>
 <pre>
 
 104A.1	LADY MARGERY MAY sits in her bower,
 	Sewing at her seem;
 	By there comes a heathen knight,
 	From her her maidenhead has tane.
 104A.2	He has put her in a tower strong,
 	With double locks on fifty doors:
 	Lady Margery May, will you ga now?
 	O ye heathen knight, not yet for you.
 104A.3	I am asking, you heathen knight;
 	What I am asking will you grant to me?
 	Will ye let one of your waitmen
 	A drink of your well bring to me?
 104A.4	Meat nor drink you shall never get,
 	Nor out of that shall you never come,
 	Meat nor drink shall you never get,
 	Until you bear to me daughter or son.
 104A.5	Thus time drew on, and further on,
 	For travail came this young lady to;
 	She travailed up, so did she down,
 	But lighter could she never be.
 104A.6	An asking, an asking, you heathen knight;
 	An asking will you grant to me?
 	Will you give me a scread of silk,
 	For to row your young son wi?
 104A.7	He took the horse-sheet in his hand,
 	The tears came twinkling down:
 	Lady Margaret May, will ye ga now?
 	O ye heathen knight, not yet for you.
 104A.8	Ill wash my young son with the milk,
 	I will dry my young son with the silk;
 	For hearts will break, and bands will bow;
 	So dear will I love my lady now!

 <pre>
 
 104B.1	LADY MARGARET sat in her bower-door,
 	Sewing at her silken seem,
 	When by it came Prince Heathen then,
 	An gae to her a gay gold ring.
 104B.2	He turnd about, an gied a bow;
 	She said, Begone, I love na you;
 	When he sware by his yellow hair
 	That he woud gar her greet fu sair.
 104B.3	But she sware by her milk-white skin
 	Prince Heathen shoud gar her greet nane:
 	But she sware by her milk-white skin
 	Prince Heathen shoud gar her greet nane:
       Refrain:	O bonny may, winna ye greet now?
 	Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.
 104B.4	Hes taen her in his arms twa,
 	Laid her between him an the wa,
 	An ere he let her free again,
 	Her maidenhead frae her hes taen.
       Refrain:	O bonny may, winna ye greet now?
 	Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.
 104B.5	I killd your father in his bed,
 	And your gay mother by his side,
 	And your seven brothers, ane by ane,
 	And they were seven pretty men.
       Refrain:	O bonny may, winna ye greet now?
 	Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.
 104B.6	Ill put you in a vault o stone,
 	Where five an thirty locks hing on;
 	Naebody there then shall you see,
 	For I will keep the keys wi me.
       Refrain:	O bonny may, winna ye greet now?
 	Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.
 104B.7	Hes put her in a vault o stone,
 	Where five an thirty locks hing on;
 	Naebody there coud eer her see,
 	Prince Heathen kept the keys him wi.
       Refrain:	But ae she cried, What shall I do!
 	The heathenish dog has gart me rue.
 104B.8	Prince heathen from the mountains came,
 	Attended by his armed men,
 	And hes gane to the bonny may,
 	And to the prison where she lay:
       Refrain:	O bonny may, what do you now?
 	Ye heathenish dog, dying for you.
 104B.9	Ill take you out upon the green,
 	Where women ye shall neer see ane,
 	But only me and my young men,
 	Till ye bring daughter hame or son.
       Refrain:	O bonny may, what do you now?
 	Ye heathenish dog, dying for you.
 104B.10	Hes taen her out upon the green,
 	Where she saw women never ane,
 	But only him and s merry young men,
 	Till she brought hame a bonny young son.
       Refrain:	O bonny may, what do you now?
 	Ye heathenish dog, dying for you.
 104B.11	A drink, a drink, frae Prince Heathens hand,
 	Though it were frae yon cauld well strong!
 	O neer a drap, Prince Heathen, said one,
 	Till ye row up your bonny young son.
 	How can I row up my bonny young son.
 	When I hae naething to row him in?
 104B.12	I will lend you my horses sheet,
 	That will row him baith head and feet.
 	As soons she took it in her han,
 	Tears oer her cheeks down rapping ran.
       Refrain:	O bonny may, ye do greet now:
 	Ye heathenish dog, but nae for you.
 104B.13	But a is for my bonny young son;
 	Your sheets are rough to row him in;
 	Ohon, alas, sair may I rue
 	That eer I saw such rogues as you!
 104B.14	Yell row my young son in the silk,
 	An ye will wash him wi the milk,
 	An lay my lady very saft,
 	That I may see her very aft.
 	When hearts are broken, bands will bow;
 	Sae wells he loved his lady now!
