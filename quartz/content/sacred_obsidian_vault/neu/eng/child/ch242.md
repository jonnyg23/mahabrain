 <h1 align="CENTER">242A: The Coble o Cargin</h1>
 <pre>
 
 242A.1	 DAVID DRUMMONDRRrrS destinie,
 	 Gude man o appearance o Cargill;
 	 I wat his blude rins in the flude,
 	 Sae sair against his parents will.
 242A.2	 She was the lass o Balathy toun,
 	 And he the butler o Stobhall,
 	 And mony a time she wauked late
 	 To bore the coble o Cargill.
 242A.3	 His bed was made in Kercock ha,
 	 Of gude clean sheets and of [the] hay;
 	 He wudna rest ae nicht therein,
 	 But on the prude waters he wud gae.
 242A.4	 His bed was made in Balathy toun,
 	 Of the clean sheets and of the strae;
 	 But I wat it was far better made
 	 Into the bottom o bonnie Tay.
 242A.5	 She bored the coble in seven pairts,
 	 I wat her heart might hae been fu sair;
 	 For there she got the bonnie lad lost
 	 Wi the curly locks and the yellow hair.
 242A.6	 He put his foot into the boat,
 	 He little thocht o ony ill;
 	 But before that he was mid-waters,
 	 The weary coble began to fill.
 242A.7	 Woe be to the lass o Balathy toun,
 	 I wat an ill death may she die!
 	 For she bored the coble in seven pairts,
 	 And let the waters perish me.
 242A.8	 Oh, help, oh help, I can get nane,
 	 Nae help o man can to me come!
 	 This was about his dying words,
 	 When he was choaked up to the chin.
 242A.9	 Gae tell my father and my mother
 	 It was naebody did me this ill;
 	 I was a-going my ain errands,
 	 Lost at the coble o bonnie Cargill.
 242A.10	 She bored the boat in seven pairts,
 	 I wat she bored it wi gude will;
 	 And there they got the bonnie lads corpse,
 	 In the kirk-shot o bonnie Cargill.
 242A.11	 Oh a the keys o bonnie Stobha
 	 I wat they at his belt did hing;
 	 But a the keys of bonnie Stobha
 	 They now ly low into the stream.
 242A.12	 A braver page into his age
 	 Neer set a foot upon the plain;
 	 His father to his mother said,
 	 Oh, sae soon as weve wanted him!
 242A.13	 I wat they had mair luve than this
 	 When they were young and at the scule;
 	 But for his sake she wauked late,
 	 And bored the coble o bonnie Cargill.
 242A.14	 Theres neer a clean sark gae on my back,
 	 Nor yet a kame gae in my hair;
 	 Theres neither coal nor candle-licht
 	 Shall shine in my bouir foe evir mair.
 242A.15	 At kirk nor market Ise neer be at,
 	 Nor yet a blythe blink in my ee;
 	 Theres neer a ane shall say to anither,
 	 Thats the lassie gard the young man die.
 242A.16	 Between the yates o bonnie Stobha
 	 And the kirk-style o bonnie Cargill,
 	 There is mony a man and mothers son
 	 That was at my loves burial.
