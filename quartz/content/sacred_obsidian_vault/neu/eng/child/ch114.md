 114A.1	 JOHNY he has risen up i the morn,
 	 Calls for water to wash his hands;
 	 But little knew he that his bloody hounds
 	 Were bound in iron bands. bands

 114A.2	 Johnys mother has gotten word o that,
 	 And care-bed she has taen:
 	 O Johny, for my benison,
 	 I beg youl stay at hame;
 	 For the wine so red, and the well baken bread,
 	 My Johny shall want nane.
 114A.3	 There are seven forsters at Pickeram Side,
 	 At Pickeram where they dwell,
 	 And for a drop of thy hearts bluid
 	 They wad ride the fords of hell.
 114A.4	 Johny hes gotten word of that,
 	 And hes turnd wondrous keen;
 	 Hes put off the red scarlett,
 	 And hes put on the Lincolm green.
 114A.5	 With a sheaf of arrows by his side,
 	 And a bent bow in his hand,
 	 Hes mounted on a prancing steed,
 	 And he has ridden fast oer the strand.
 114A.6	 Hes up i Braidhouplee, and down i Bradyslee,
 	 And under a buss o broom,
 	 And there he found a good dun deer,
 	 Feeding in a buss of ling.
 114A.7	 Johny shot, and the dun deer lap,
 	 And she lap wondrous wide,
 	 Until they came to the wan water,
 	 And he stemd her of her pride.
 114A.8	 He as taen out the little pen-knife,
 	 Twas full three quarters long,
 	 And he has taen out of that dun deer
 	 The liver bot and the tongue.
 114A.9	 They eat of the flesh, and they drank of the blood,
 	 And the blood it was so sweet,
 	 Which caused Johny and his bloody hounds
 	 To fall in a deep sleep.
 114A.10	 By then came an old palmer,
 	 And an ill death may he die!
 	 For hes away to Pickram Side,
 	 As fast as he can drie.
 114A.11	 What news, what news? says the Seven Forsters,
 	 What news have ye brought to me?
 	 I have noe news, the palmer said,
 	 But what I saw with my eye.
 114A.12	 High up i Bradyslee, low down i Bradisslee,
 	 And under a buss of scroggs,
 	 O there I spied a well-wight man,
 	 Sleeping among his dogs.
 114A.13	 His coat it was of light Lincolm,
 	 And his breeches of the same,
 	 His shoes of the American leather,
 	 And gold buckles tying them.
 114A.14	 Up bespake the Seven Forsters,
 	 Up bespake they ane and a:
 	 O that is Johny o Cockleys Well,
 	 And near him we will draw.
 114A.15	 O the first y stroke that they gae him,
 	 They struck him off by the knee;
 	 Then up bespake his sisters son:
 	 O the next ll gar him die!
 114A.16	 O some they count ye well-wight men,
 	 But I do count ye nane;
 	 For you might well ha wakend me,
 	 And askd gin I wad be taen.
 114A.17	 The wildest wolf in aw this wood
 	 Wad not ha done so by me;
 	 Shed ha wet her foot ith wan water,
 	 And sprinkled it oer my brae,
 	 And if that wad not ha wakend me,
 	 She wad ha gone and let me be.
 114A.18	 O bows of yew, if ye be true,
 	 In London, where ye were bought,
 	 Fingers five, get up belive,
 	 Manhuid shall fail me nought.
 114A.19	 He has killd the Seven Forsters,
 	 He has killd them all but ane,
 	 And that wan scarce to Pickeram Side,
 	 To carry the bode-words hame.
 114A.20	 Is there never a boy in a this wood
 	 That will tell what I can say;
 	 That will go to Cockleys Well,
 	 Tell my mither to fetch me away?
 114A.21	 There was a boy into that wood,
 	 That carried the tidings away,
 	 And many ae was the well-wight man
 	 At the fetching o Johny away.

 114F.19	 O is there na a bonnie bird
 	 Can sing as I can say,
 	 Could flee away to my mothers bower,
 	 And tell to fetch Johnie away?
 114F.20	 The starling flew to his mothers window-stane,
 	 It whistled and it sang,
 	 And aye the ower-word o the tune
 	 Was, Johnie tarries lang!
 114F.21	 They made a rod o the hazel-bush,
 	 Another o the slae-thorn tree,
 	 And mony, mony were the men
 	 At fetching our Johnie.
 114F.22	 Then out and spake his auld mother,
 	 And fast her teirs did fa;
 	 Ye wad nae be warnd, my son Johnie,
 	 Frae the hunting to bide awa.
 114F.23	 Aft hae I brought to Breadislee
 	 The less gear and the mair,
 	 But I neer brought to Breadislee
 	 What grieved my heart sae sair.
 114F.24	 But wae betyde that silly auld carle,
 	 An ill death shall he die;
 	 For the highest tree on Merriemass
 	 Shall be his mornings fee.
 114F.25	 Now Johnies gude bend bow is broke,
 	 And his gude graie dogs are slain,
 	 And his bodie lies dead in Durrisdeer,
 	 And his hunting it is done.

 	 Nae news, nae news, ye seven foresters,
 	 But what your eyes will see.
 114H.13	 As I gaed i yon rough thick hedge,
 	 Amang yon bramly scroggs,
 	 The fairest youth that eer I saw
 	 Lay sleeping between his dogs.
 114H.14	 The sark that was upon his back
 	 Was o the cambric fine;
 	 The belt that was around his middle
 	 Wi pearlins it did shine.
 114H.15	 Then out it speaks the first forester:
 	 Whether this be true or no,
 	 O if its Johnnie o Cocklesmuir,
 	 Nae forder need we go.
 114H.16	 Out it spake the second forester,
 	 A fierce fellow was he:
 	 Betide me life, betide me death,
 	 This youth well go and see.
 114H.17	 As they gaed in yon rough thick hedge,
 	 And down yon forest gay,
 	 They came to that very same place
 	 Where John o Cockis he lay.
 114H.18	 The first an shot they shot at him,
 	 They wounded him in the thigh;
 	 Out spake the first foresters son:
 	 By the next shot he maun die.
 114H.19	 O stand ye true, my trusty bow,
 	 And stout steel never fail!
 	 Avenge me now on all my foes,
 	 Who have my life i bail.
 114H.20	 Then Johnnie killd six foresters,
 	 And wounded the seventh sair;
 	 Then drew a stroke at the stane-auld man,
 	 That words he neer spake mair.
 114H.21	 His mothers parrot in window sat,
 	 She whistled and she sang,
 	 And aye the owerturn o the note,
 	 Young Johnnies biding lang.
 114H.22	 When this reached the kings own ears,
 	 It grievd him wondrous sair;
 	 Says, Id rather theyd hurt my subjects all
 	 Than Johnnie o Cocklesmuir.
 114H.23	 But where are all my wall-wight men,
 	 That I pay meat and fee,
 	 Will gang the morn to Johnnies castle,
 	 See how the cause may be.
 114H.24	 Then hes calld Johnnie up to court,
 	 Treated him handsomelie,
 	 And now to hunt in the Brides Braidmuir,
 	 For life has license free.
