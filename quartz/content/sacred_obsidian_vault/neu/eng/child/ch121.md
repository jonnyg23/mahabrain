 	 Yeffe y bryng eny pottys ayen,
 	 And eney weyffe well hem chepe.

 	 Op he hem toke of hes care,
 	 And sende hem to the screffeys weyffe.
 121A.37	 Thereof sche was foll fayne,
 	 Gereamarsey, SER, than seyde sche;
 	 When ye com to thes contre ayen,
 	 Y schall bey of the[y] pottys, so mot y the.

 	 The potter cowed of corteysey,
 	 And sone the screffe he gret.
