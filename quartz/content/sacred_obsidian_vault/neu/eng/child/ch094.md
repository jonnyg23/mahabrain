 <pre>
 
 94.1	ABOUT Yule, when the wind blew cule,
 	And the round tables began,
 	A there is cum to our kings court
 	Mony a well-favourd man.
 94.2	The queen luikt owre the castle-wa,
 	Beheld baith dale and down,
 	And then she saw Young Waters
 	Cum riding to the town.
 94.3	His footmen they did rin before,
 	His horsemen rade behind;
 	Ane mantel of the burning gowd
 	Did keip him frae the wind.
 94.4	Gowden-graithd his horse before,
 	And siller-shod behind;
 	The horse Young Waters rade upon
 	Was fleeter than the wind.
 94.5	Out then spake a wylie lord,
 	Unto the queen said he,
 	O tell me whas the fairest face
 	Rides in the company?
 94.6	Ive sene lord, and Ive sene laird,
 	And knights of high degree,
 	But a fairer face than Young Waters
 	Mine eyne did never see.
 94.7	Out then spack the jealous king,
 	And an angry man was he:
 	O if he had been twice as fair,
 	You micht have excepted me.
 94.8	Youre neither laird nor lord, she says,
 	Bot the king that wears the crown;
 	There is not a knight in fair Scotland
 	But to thee maun bow down.
 94.9	For a that she could do or say,
 	Appeasd he wad nae bee,
 	Bot for the words which she had said,
 	Young Waters he maun dee.
 94.10	They hae taen Young Waters,
 	And put fetters to his feet;
 	They hae taen Young Waters,
 	And thrown him in dungeon deep.
 94.11	Aft I have ridden thro Stirling town
 	In the wind bot and the weit;
 	Bot I neir rade thro Stirling town
 	Wi fetters at my feet.
 94.12	t have I ridden thro Stirling town
 	In the wind bot and the rain;
 	Bot I neir rade thro Stirling town
 	Neir to return again.
 94.13	They hae taen to the heiding-hill
 	His young son in his craddle,
 	And they hae taen to the heiding-hill
 	His horse bot and his saddle.
 94.14	They hae taen to the heiding-hill
 	His lady fair to see,
 	And for the words the queen had spoke
 	Young Waters he did dee.
