 <p align="CENTER">THE PIXIES OF DARTMOOR.</p>
 <p><br>
 THERE is a celebrated piskie haunt at Costellas in Cornwall (says Mrs Bray),
 where they have been seen sitting in a ring--the men smoking after .the most
 approved fashion of the Dutch burgomaster, and the women spinning, perhaps in
 emulation of the frugal vrow.</p>
 <p>I never heard of this place. Like the rest of the "good
 people," piskies are fond of music, and the sound of their "harp and pipe and
 symphony," is occasionally heard at nightfall. It is said that a man once
 passing one of the piskie rings, and hearing them dancing and singing within
 it, threw a large stone into the midst of the circle, when the music at once
 ceased and a dreadful shriek arose.</p>
 <p>The appearance of <i>the pixies</i> of Dartmoor is said to
 resemble that of a bale or bundle of rags. In this shape they decoy children
 to their unreal pleasure. A woman, on the northern borders of the moor, was
 returning home late on a dark evening, accompanied by two children, and
 carrying a third in her arms, when, on arriving at her own door, she found one
 missing. Her neighbours, with lanthorns, immediately set out in quest of the
 lost child; whom they found sitting under a large oak-tree, well known to be a
 favourite haunt of the pixies. He declared that he had been led away by two
 large bundles of rags, which had remained with him until the lights appeared,
 when they immediately vanished. [a]</p>
 <p>The pixies of Dartmoor, notwithstanding their darker
 character, aided occasionally in household work. A washer-woman was one
 morning greatly surprised, on coming down-stairs, to find all her clothes
 neatly washed and folded. She watched the next evening, and observed a pixie
 in the act of performing this kind office for her: but she was ragged and mean
 in appearance, and Betty's gratitude was sufficiently great to- induce her to
 prepare a yellow petticoat and a red cap for the obliging pixie.</p>

 banks of the Tamar and the Tavy, the reader is referred to Mrs Bray's
