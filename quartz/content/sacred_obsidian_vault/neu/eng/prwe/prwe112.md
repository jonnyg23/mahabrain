 <p align="CENTER">THE SUICIDE'S SPEARMAN.</p>
 <p>A FAMILY of the name of Spearman has lived in Cornwall
 for many ages, their native centre having been somewhere between Ludgvan and
 St Ives.</p>
 <p>Years long ago, an unfortunate man, weary of life,
 destroyed himself; and the rude laws of a remote age, carrying out, as they
 thought, human punishments even after death, decreed that the body should be
 buried at the four cross-roads, and quicklime poured on the corpse.</p>
 <p>Superstition stepped in, and somewhat changed the order
 of burial. To prevent the dead man from "walking," and becoming a terror to
 all his neighbours, the coffin was to be turned upside down, and a spear was
 to be driven through it and the body, so as to pin it to the ground.</p>
 <p>It was with some difficulty that a man could be found to
 perform this task. At length, however, a blacksmith undertook it. He made
 the spear; and after the coffin was properly placed, he drove his
 spear-headed iron bar through it. From that day he was called "the
 spearman," and his descendants have never lost the name.</p>
 <p>In making a new road not many years since, the coffin and
 spear were found, and removed. From that time several old men and women have
 declared that the self-murderer "walks the earth."</p>
