 <p align="CENTER">THE CROWZA STONES.</p>
 <p>ST JUST, from his home in Penwith, being weary of having
 little to do, except offering prayers for the tinners and fishermen, went on
 a visit to the hospitable St Keverne, who had fixed his hermitage in a
 well-selected spot, not far from the Lizard headland. The holy brothers
 rejoiced together, and in full feeding and deep drinking they pleasantly
 passed the time. St Just gloried in the goodly chalice from which he drank
 the richest of wines, and envied St Keverne the possession of a cup of such
 rare value. Again and again did he pledge St Keverne; their holy bond of
 brotherhood was to be for ever; Heaven was to witness the purity of their
 friendship, and to the world they were to become patterns of ecclesiastical
 love.</p>
 <p>The time came when St Just felt he must return to his
 flock; and repeating over again his vows, and begging St Keverne to return
 his visit, he departed--St Keverne sending many a blessing after his good
 brother.</p>
 <p>The Saint of the west had not left his brother of the
 south many hours before the latter missed his cup. Diligent search was made
 in every corner of his dwelling, but no cup could be found. At length St
 Keverne could not but feel that he had been robbed of his treasure by his
 western friend. That one in whom he had placed such confidence--one to whom
 be had opened his heart, and to whom he had shown the most unstinting
 hospitality--should have behaved so treacherously, overcame the serenity of
 the good man. His rage was excessive. After the first burst was over, and
 reason reasserted her power, St Keverne felt that his wisest course was to
 pursue the thief; inflict summary punishment on him, and recover his cup.
 The thought was followed by a firm resolve, and away St Keverne started in
 pursuit of St Just. Passing over Crowza Down, some of the boulders of
 "Ironstone" which are scattered over the surface caught his eye, and
 presently he whipped a few of these stone pebbles into his pockets, and
 hastened onward.</p>
 <p>When he drew near Tre-men-keverne he spied St Just. St
 Keverne worked himself up into a boiling rage, and toiled with increased
 speed up the hill, hallooing to the saintly thief; who pursued his way for
 some time in the well-assumed quiet of conscious innocence.</p>
 <p>Long and loud did St Keverne call on St Just to stop, but
 the latter was deaf to all calls of the, kind--on he went, quickening,
 however, his pace a little.</p>
 <p>At length St Keverne came within a stone's throw of the
 dissembling culprit, and calling him a thief--adding thereto some of the
 most choice epithets from his holy vocabulary--taking a stone from his
 pocket, he let it fly after St Just.</p>
 <p>The stone falling heavily by the side of St Just
 convinced him that he had to deal with an awkward enemy, and that he had
 best make all the use he could of his legs. He quietly untied the chalice,
 which he had fastened to his girdle, and let it fall to the ground. Then,
 still as if unconscious of his follower, he set off to run as fast as his
 ponderous body would allow his legs to carry him. St Keverne came up to
 where his cup glistened in the sunshine. He had recovered his treasure, he
 should get no good out of the false friend, and he was sadly jaded with his
 long run. Therefore he took, one by one, the stones from his pockets--he
 hurled them, fairly aimed, after the retreating culprit, and cursed him as
 he went.</p>
 <p>There the pebbles remained where they fell,--the
 peculiarity of the stone being in all respects unlike anything around, but
 being clearly the Crowza stones,--attesting the truth of the legend; and
 their weights, each one 'being several hundred pounds, proving the power of
 the giant saint.</p>
 <p>Many have been the attempts made to remove these stones.
 They are carried away easily enough by day, but they ever return to the spot
 on which they now repose, at night.</p>
