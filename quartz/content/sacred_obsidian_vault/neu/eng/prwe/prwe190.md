 <p align="CENTER">"WHO ARE THE KNOCKERS ?"</p>
 <p>CHARLES KINGSLEY in his "Yeast: a Problem," asks this
 question--Tregarra answers,--"They are <i>the ghosts, </i>the miners hold,
 <i>of the old Jews that crucjfled our Lord, and were sent for slaves by the
 Roman emperors to work the mines: </i>and we find their old smelting-houses,
 which we call <i>Jews' houses, </i>and their blocks at the bottom of the
 great bogs, which we call <i>Jews' tin: </i>and then a town among us too,
 which we call <i>Market Jew, </i>but the old name was Marazion, that means
 the bitterness of Zion, they tell me; and bitter work it was for them, no
 doubt, poor souls ! We used to break into old shafts and adits which they
 had made, and find flue old stag's-horn pick-axes, that crumbled to pieces
 when we brought them to grass. And they say that if a man will listen of a
 still night about these shafts, he may hear the ghosts of them at work,
 knocking and picking, as clear as if there was a man at work in the next
 level."</p>
 <p>In <i>Notes and Queries </i>will be found some learned
 discussions on the question of the Jews working the Cornish tin mines, as
 though it were merely one of tradition. That the Jews farmed the tin mines
 of Cornwall and Devonshire is an historical fact, of which we have evidence
 in charters granted by several of our kings, especially by King John. Carew
 in his "Survey of Cornwall" gives some account of their mode of dealing with
 the tinners. Hence the terms "Jews' houses," given to old and rude smelting
 works,--many of which I have seen,--and hence the name of "Jews' tin," given
 to the old blocks of tin, specimens of which may be seen in the <i>Museum of
 Practical Geology, </i>and in the museum of the <i>Royal Institution of
 Cornwall, </i>at Truro. <i>"Atall Sarazin" </i>is another term applied to
 some of the old waste-heaps of the ancient tin mines. -</p>
 <p>"The Jews," says Whitaker (" Origin of Arianism," p. <i>
 334), </i>"denominated themselves, and were denominated by the Britons of
 Cornwall, <i>Saracens, </i>as the genuine progeny of Sarah." Be this as it
 may, I have often heard in the mining villages--from twenty to thirty years
 since--a man coming from a distant parish, called <i>"a foreignerer;" </i>a
 man from a distant country, termed <i>"an outlandish man;" </i>and any one
 not British born, designated as "a <i>Saracen."</i></p>
 
 <p>But this has led me away from the knockers, who are in some
 districts called also <i>"the buccas" </i>Many a time have I been seriously
 informed by the miners themselves that these sprites have been heard working
 away in the remote parts of a lode, repeating the blows of the miner's pick
 or sledge with great precision. Generally speaking, the knockers work upon
 productive lodes only; and they have often kindly indicated to the trusting
 miners, where they might take good tribute pitches.</p>
 <p>To Wesley, Cornwall owes a deep debt. He found the country
 steeped in the darkness of superstitious ignorance, and he opened a new
 light upon it. Associated with the spread of Wesleyan Methodism, has been
 the establishment of schools; and under the influence of religion and
 education, many of the superstitions have faded away. We rarely hear of the
 knockers now; but the following occurrence will show that the knockers have
 not entirely left the land:-- </p>
 <p>One Saturday night I had retired to rest, having first seen
 that all the members of the household had gone to their bedrooms. These were
 my daughters, two female servants, and an old woman, named Mary, who was
 left, by the proprietor, in charge of the house which I occupied.</p>
 <p>I had been some time in bed, when I distinctly heard a
 bedroom door open, and footsteps which, after moving about for some time in
 the passage or landing, from which the bedrooms opened, slowly and carefully
 descended the stairs. I heard a movement in the kitchen below, and the
 footsteps again ascended the stairs, and went into one of the bedrooms. This
 noise contiued so long, and was so regularly repeated, that I began to fear
 lest one of the children were taken suddenly ill. Yet I felt assured, if it
 was so, one of the servants would call me. Therefore I lay still and
 listened until I fell asleep.</p>
 <p>On the Sunday morning, when I descended to the breakfast
 room, I asked the eldest of the two servants what had occasioned so much
 going up and down stairs in the night. She declared that no one had left
 their bedrooms after they had retired to them. I then inquired of the
 younger girl, and of each of my daughters as they made their appearance. No
 one had left their rooms--they had not heard any noises. My youngest
 daughter, who had been, after this inquiry of mine, for some minutes alone
 with the youngest servant, came laughing to me,--</p>
 <p>"Papa, Nanny says the house is haunted, and that they have
 often heard strange noises in it."</p>
 <p>So I called Nancy; but all I could learn from her was that
 noises, like that of men going up and down stairs,--of threshing corn, and
 of "beating the borer" (a mining operation), were not uncommon.</p>
 <p>We all laughed over papa's ghost during the breakfast, and
 by and by old Mary made her appearance.</p>
 <p>"Yes," she said, "it is quite true, as Nanny as a told you.
 I have often heard all sorts of strange noises; but I b'lieve they all come
 from the lode of tin which runs under the house. <i>Wherever there is a lode
 of tin, you are sure to hear strange noises."</i></p>
 
 <p>"What, Mary I was it the knockers I heard last night ?"
 "Yes; 'twas the knackers, down working upon the tin--no doubt of it."</p>
 <p>This was followed by a long explanation, and numerous
 stories of mines in the Lelant and St Ives district, in which the knockers
 had been often heard.</p>
 <p>After a little time, Mary, imagining, I suppose, that the
 your ladies might not like to sleep in a house beneath which the knockers
 were at work, again came with her usual low courtesy into the parlour.</p>
 <p>"Beg pardon, sir," says she; "but none of the young ladies
 need be afraid. There are no spirits in the house; it is very nearly a new
 one, and no one has ever died in the house."</p>
 <p>This makes a distinct difference between the ghost of the
 departed and those gnomes who are doomed to toil in the earth's dark
 recesses.[a] The Cornish knocker does not appear to be the <i>"cobal" </i>of
 German miners. The former are generally kindly, and often serve the
 industrious miner; the latter class are always malicious, and, I believe,
 are never heard but when mischief is near.</p>
 <p>[a] "Some are sent, like the spirit
 Gathon in Cornwall, to work the will of his master in the mines."--Mrs
 <i>Bray's Tradilians of Devonshire.</i></p>
 
 <p>Who was the spirit Gathon ?</p>
 <p>"The miner starts as he hears the
 mischievous Gathon answering blow for blow the stroke of his pickaxe, or
 deluding him with false fires, noises, and flames."--A <i>
 Guide to the Coasts of Devon and Cornwall. Mackenzie
 Walcott, M.A.</i></p>
 
 <p>Carne, in his "Tales of the West,"
 alludes to this :-- "The miners have their full share of the superstitious
 feelings of the country, and often hear with alarm the noises, as it were,
 of other miners at work deep underground, and at no great distance. The of
 the barrows, the sound of the pickaxes, and the fall of the earth and
 stones, are distinctly heard through the night,--often, no doubt, the echo
 of their own labour; sometimes continued long after that labonr has ceased,
 and occasionally voices seem to mingle with them. Gilbert believed that he
 was peculiarly exposed to these visitations;
 he had an instinctive
 shrinking from the place where the accident had happened; and, when left
 alone there, it was in vain that he plied his toil with desperate energy to
 divert his thoughts. Another person appeared to work very near him: he
 stayed the lifted pick and listened. The blow of the other fell distinctly,
 and the rich ore followed it in a loud rollinng; he checked the loaded
 barrow that he was wheeling; still that of the un­known workman went on, and
 came nearer and nearer, and then there followed a loud, faint cry, that
 thrilled through every nerve of the lonely man, for it seemed like the voice
 of his brother. These sounds as ceased on a sudden, and those which his own
 toll caused were the only ones heard, till, after an interval, without any
 warning, they began again at times more near, and again passing away to a
 distance."--The <i>Tale of the Miner.</i></p>
