 <p align="CENTER">THE SPECTRAL COACH.[a]</p>
 <p>"You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know<br>
 The superstitius, idle-headed eld<br>
 Received and did deliver to our age<br>
 This tale of Herne the Hunter for a truth."</p>
 <p>-- MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR.</p>
 <p>HE old vicarage-house at Talland, as seen from the Looe
 road, its low roof and gray walls peeping prettily from between the dense
 boughs of ash and elm that environed it, was as picturesque an object as you
 could desire to see. The' seclusion of its situation was enhanced by the
 character of the house itself. It was an odd-looking, old-fashioned
 building, erected apparently in an age when asceticism and self-denial were
 more in vogue than at present, with a stern disregard of the comfort of the
 inhabitant, and in utter contempt of received principles of taste. As if not
 secure enough in its retirement, a high wall, enclosing a courtelage in
 front, effectually protected its inmates from the prying passenger, and only
 revealed the upper part of the house, with its small Gothic windows, its
 slated roof, and heavy chimneys partly hidden by the evergreen shrubs which
 grew in the enclosure. Such was it until its removal a few years since; and
 such was it as it lay sweetly in the shadows of an autumnal evening one
 hundred and thirty years ago, when a stranger in the garb of a country
 labourer knocked hesitatingly at the wicket-gate which conducted to the
 court. After a little delay a servant-girl appeared, and finding that the
 countryman bore a message to the vicar, admitted him within the walls, and
 conducted him along a paved passage to the little, low, damp parlour where
 sat the good man. The Rev. Mr Dodge was in many respects a remarkable man.</p>
 <p>You would have judged as much of him as he sat before the
 fire in his high-back chair, in an attitude of thought, arranging, it may
 have been, the heads of his next Sabbath's discourse. His heavy eyebrows
 throwing into shade his spacious eyes, and indeed the whole contour of his
 face, marked him as a man of great firmness of character and of much moral
 and personal courage. His suit of sober black and full-bottomed periwig also
 added to his dignity, and gave him an appearance of greater age. He was then
 verging on sixty. The time and the place gave him abundant exercise for the
 qualities we have mentioned, for many of his parishioners obtained their
 livelihood by the contraband trade, and were mostly men of unscrupulous and
 daring character, little likely to bear with patience reflections on the
 dishonesty of their calling. Nevertheless, the vicar was fearless in
 reprehending it, and his frank exhortations were, at least, listened to on
 account of the simple honesty of the man, and his well-known kindness of
 heart. The eccentricity of his life, too, had a wonderful effect in
 procuring him the respect, not to say the awe, of a people superstitious in
 a more than ordinary degree. Ghosts in those days had more freedom accorded
 them, or had more business with the visible world, than at present; and the
 parson was frequently required by his parishioners to- draw from the uneasy
 spirit the dread secret which troubled it, or by the aid of the solemn
 prayers of the Church to set it at rest for ever. Mr Dodge had a fame as an
 exorcist, which was not confined to the bounds of his parish, nor limited to
 the age in which he lived.</p>
 <p>"Well, my good man, what brings you hither?" said the
 clergyman to the messenger.</p>
 <p>"A letter, may it please your reverence, from Mr Mills of
 Lanreath," said the countryman, handing him a letter.</p>
 <p>Mr Dodge opened it and read as follows</p>
 <p>"My DEAR BROTHER D0DGE,-- I have ventured to trouble you,
 at the earnest request of my parishioners, with a matter, of which some
 particulars have doubtless reached you, and which has caused, and is
 causing, much terror in my neighbourhood. For its fuller explication, I will
 be so tedious as to recount to you the whole of this strange story as it has
 reached my ears, for as yet I have not satisfied my eyes of its truth. It
 has been told me by men of honest and good report (witnesses of a portion of
 what they relate), with such strong assurances that it behoves us to look
 more closely into the matter. There is in the neighbourhood of this village
 a barren bit of moor which had no owner, or rather more than one, for the
 lords of the adjoining manors debated its ownership between themselves, and
 both determined to take it from the poor, who have for many years past
 regarded it as a common, And truly, it is little to the credit of these
 gentlemen, that they should strive for a thing so worthless as scarce to
 bear the cost of law, and yet of no mean value to poor labouring people. The
 two litigants, however, contested it with as much violence as if it had been
 a field of great price, and especially one, an old man (whose thoughts
 should have been less set on earthly possessions, which he was soon to
 leave), had so set his heart on the success of his suit, that the loss of
 it, a few years back, is said to have much hastened his death. Nor, indeed,
 after death, if current reports are worthy of credit, does he quit his claim
 to it; for at night-time his apparition is seen on the moor, to the great
 terror of the neighbouring villagers. A public path leads by at no great
 distance from the spot, and on divers occasions has the labourer, returning
 from his work, been frightened nigh unto lunacy by sight and sounds of a
 very dreadful character. The appearance is said to be that of a man habited
 in black, driving a carriage drawn by headless horses. This is, I avow, very
 marvellous to believe, but it has had so much credible testimony, and has
 gained so many believers in my parish, that some steps seem necessary to
 allay the excitement it causes. I have been applied to for this purpose, and
 my present business is to ask your assistance in this matter, either to
 reassure the minds of the country people, if it be only a simple terror; or,
 if there be truth in it, to set the troubled spirit of the man at rest. My
 messenger, who is an industrious, trustworthy man, will give you more
 information if it be needed, for, from report, lie is acquainted with most
 of the circumstances, and will bring back your advice and promise of
 assistance.</p>
 <p>"Not doubting of your help herein, I do, with my very
 hearty commendation, commit you to God's protection and blessing, and am,</p>
 <p>"Your very loving brother,</p>
 <p>"ABRAHAM MILLS."</p>
 <p>This remarkable note was read and re-read, while the
 countryman sat watching its effects on the parson's countenance, and was
 surprised that it changed not from its usual sedate and settled character.
 Turning at length to the man, Mr Dodge inquired, "Are you, then, acquainted
 with my good friend Mills?"</p>
 <p>"I should know him, sir," replied the messenger "having
 been sexton to the parish for fourteen years, and being, with my family,
 much beholden to the kindness of the rector."</p>
 <p>"You are also not without some knowledge of the
 circumstances related in this letter. Have you been an eye-witness to any of
 those strange sights?"</p>
 <p>"For myself, sir, I have been on the road at all hours of
 the night and day, and never did I see anything which I could call worse
 than myself. One night my wife and I were awoke by the rattle of wheels,
 which was also heard by some of our neighbours, and we are all assured that
 it could have been no other than the black coach. We have every day such
 stories told in the villages by so many creditable persons, that it would
 not be proper in a plain, ignorant man like me to doubt it."</p>
 <p>"And how far," asked the clergyman, "is the moor from
 Lanreath?"</p>
 <p>"About two miles, and please your reverence. The whole
 parish is so frightened, that few will venture far after nightfall, font has
 of late come much nearer the village. A man who is esteemed a sensible and
 pious man by many, though an Anabaptist in principle, went a few weeks back
 to the moor ('tis called Blackadon) at midnight, in order to lay the spirit,
 being requested thereto by his neighbours, and he was so alarmed at what he
 saw, that he hath been somewhat mazed ever since."</p>
 <p>"A fitting punishment for his presumption, if it hath not
 quite demented him," said the parson. "These persons are like those
 addressed by St Chrysostom, fitly called the golden-mouthed, who said,
 'Miserable wretches that ye be! ye cannot expel a flea, much less a devil!'
 It will be well if it serves no other purpose but to bring back these stray
 sheep to the fold of the Church. So this story has gained much belief in the
 parish </p>
 <p>"</p>
 <p>"Most believe it, sir, as rightly they should, what hath so
 many witnesses," said the sexton, "though there be some, chiefly young men,
 who set up for being wiser than their fathers, and refuse to credit it,
 though it be sworn to on the book."</p>
 <p>" If those things are disbelieved, friend," said the parson,
 "and without inquiry, which your disbeliever is ever the first to shrink
 from, of what worth is human testimony? That ghosts have returned to the
 earth, either for the discovery of murder, or to make restitution for other
 injustice committed in the flesh, or compelled thereto by the incantations
 of sorcery, or to communicate tidings from another world, has been testified
 to in all ages, and many are the accounts which have been left us both in
 sacred and profane authors. Did not Brutus, when in Asia, as is related by
 Plutarch, see "-- Just at this moment the parson's handmaid announced that a
 person waited on him in the kitchen,--or the good clergyman would probably
 have detailed all those cases in history, general and biblical, with which
 his reading had acquainted him, not much, we fear, to the edification and
 comfort of the sexton, who had to return to Lanreath, a long and dreary
 road, after nightfall. So, instead, he directed the girl to take him with
 her, and give him such refreshment as he needed, and in the meanwhile he
 prepared a note in answer to Mr Mills, informing him that on the morrow he
 was to visit some sick persons in his parish, but that on the following
 evening he should be ready to proceed with him to the moor.</p>
 <p>On the night appointed the two clergymen left the
 Lanreath rectory on horseback, and reached the moor at eleven o'clock. Bleak
 and dismal did it look by day, but then there was the distant landscape
 dotted over with pretty homesteads to relieve its desolation. Now, nothing
 was seen but the black patch of sterile moor on which they stood, nothing
 heard but the wind as it swept in gusts across the bare hill, and howled
 dismally through a stunted grove of trees that grew in a glen below them,
 except the occasional baying of dogs from the farmhouses in the distance.
 That they felt at ease, is more than could be expected of them; but as it
 would have shown a lack of faith in the protection of Heaven, which it would
 have been unseemly in men of their holy calling to exhibit, they managed to
 conceal from each other their uneasiness. Leading their horses, they trod to
 and fro through the damp fern and heath with firmness in their steps, and
 upheld each other by remarks on the power of that Great Being whose
 ministers they were, and the might of whose name they were there to make
 manifest. Still slowly and dismally passed the time as they conversed, and
 anon stopped to look through the darkness for the approach of their ghostly
 visitor. In vain. Though the night was as dark and murky as ghost could
 wish, the coach and its driver came not.</p>
 <p>After a considerable stay, the two clergymen consulted
 together, and determined that it was useless to watch any longer for that
 night, but that they would meet on some other, when perhaps it might please
 his ghostship to appear. Accordingly, with a few words of leave-taking, they
 separated, Mr Mills for the rectory, and Mr Dodge, by a short ride across
 the moor, which shortened his journey by half a mile, for the vicarage at
 Talland.</p>
 <p>The vicar rode on at an ambling pace, which his good mare
 sustained up bill and down dale without urging. At the bottom of a deep
 valley, however, about a mile from Blackadon, the animal became very uneasy,
 pricked up her ears, snorted, and moved from side to side of the road, as if
 something stood in the path before her. The parson tightened the reins, and
 applied whip and spur to her sides, but the animal, usually docile, became
 very unruly, made several attempts to turn, and, when prevented, threw
 herself upon her haunches. Whip and spur were applied again and again, to no
 other purpose than to add to the horse's terror. To the rider nothing was
 apparent which could account for the sudden restiveness of his beast. He
 dismounted, and attempted in turns to lead or drag her, but both were
 impracticable, and attended with no small risk of snapping the reins. She
 was remounted with great difficulty, and another attempt was made to urge
 her forward, with the like want of success. At length the eccentric
 clergyman, judging it to be some special signal from Heaven, which it would
 be dangerous to neglect, threw the reins on the neck of his steed, which,
 wheeling suddenly round, started backward in a direction towards the moor,
 at a pace which rendered the parson's seat neither a pleasant nor a safe
 one. In an astonishingly short space of time they were once more a
 Blackadon.</p>
 <p>By this time the bare outline of the moor was broken by a
 large black group of objects, which the darkness of the night prevented the
 parson from defining. On approaching this unaccountable appearance, the mare
 was seized with fresh fury, and it was with considerable difficulty that she
 could be brought to face this new cause of fright. In the pauses of the
 horse's prancing, the vicar discovered to his horror the much-dreaded
 spectacle of the black coach and the headless steeds, and, terrible to
 relate, his friend Mr Mills lying prostrate on the ground before the sable
 driver. Little time was left him to call up his courage for this fearful
 emergency; for just as the vicar began to give utterance to the earnest
 prayers which struggled to his lips, the spectre shouted, "Dodge is come! I
 must begone!" and forthwith leaped into his chariot, and 'disappeared
 across the moor.</p>
 <p>The fury of the mare now subsided, and Mr Dodge was
 enabled to approach his friend, who was lying motionless and speechless,
 with his face buried in the heather.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile the rector's horse, which bad taken fright at
 the apparition, and had thrown his rider to the ground on or near the spot
 where we have left him lying, made homeward at a furious speed, and stopped
 not until he had reached his stable door. The sound of his hoofs as he
 galloped madly through the village awoke the cottagers, many of whom had
 been some hours in their beds. Many eager faces, staring with affright,
 gathered round the rectory, and added, by their various conjectures, to the
 terror and apprehensions of the family.</p>
 <p>The villagers, gathering courage as their numbers
 increased, agreed to go in search of the missing clergyman, and started off
 in a compact body, a few on horseback, but the greater number on foot, in
 the direction of Blackadon. There they discovered their rector, supported in
 the arms of Parson Dodge, and recovered so far as to be able to speak. Still
 there was a wildness in his eye, and an incoherency in his speech, that
 showed that his reason was, at least, temporarily unsettled by the fright.
 In this condition he was taken to his home, followed by his reverend
 companion.</p>
 <p>Here ended this strange adventure; for Mr Mills soon
 completely regained his reason, Parson Dodge got safely back to Talland, and
 from that time to this nothing has been heard or seen of the black ghost or
 his chariot. [b]</p>

 Esq.</p>
 <p>[b] The Parson Dodge, whose
 advesture is related, was vicar of Tallaud from 1713 till his death. So that
 the name as well as the story is true to tradition. Bond (" History of East
 and west Love ") says of him: "About a century since the Rev. Richard Dodge
 was vicar of this parish of Talland, and was, by traditionary account, a
 very singular man. He had the reputation of being deeply skilled in the
 black art, and would raise ghosts, or send them into the Dead Sea, at the
 nod of his head. The common people, not only in his own parish, but
 throughout the neighbourhood, stood in the greatest awe of him, and to meet
 him on the highway at midnight produced the utmost horror; he was then
 driving shout the evil spirits; many of them were seen, in all sorts of
 shapes, flying and running before him, as he pursuing them with his whip in
 a most daring manner. Not unfrequently he would be seen in the churchyard at
 dead of night to the terror of passers by. He was a worthy man, and much
 respected, but had his eccentricities."</p>
