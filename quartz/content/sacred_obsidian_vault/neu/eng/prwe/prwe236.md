 THE GAME OF HURLING.</p>
 <p>THE
 game of " Hurling"  was, until a recent period, played in the
 parishes to the west of Penzance on the Sunday afternoon. The game was
 usually between two parishes, sometimes between Burian and Sancreed, or
 against St Leven and Sennen, or the higher side of the parish played
 against the lower side.</p>
 <p>The run was from Burian Cross in the Church-town, to
 the Pipers in Boloeit. All the gentry from the surrounding parishes would
 meet at Boloeit to see the ball brought in.</p>
 <p>"Hurling matches" are peculiar to Cornwall. They are
 trials of skill between two parties, consisting of a considerable number
 of men, forty to sixty a side, and often between two parishes. These
 exercises have their name from "hurling" a wooden ball, about three inches
 in diameter, covered with a plate of silver, which is sometimes gilt, and
 has commonly a motto, " Gware wheag yeo gware teag," "Fair play is good
 play." The success depends on catching the ball dexterously when thrown
 up, or <i>dealt, </i>and carrying it off expeditiously, in spite of all
 opposition from the adverse party; or, if that be impossible, throwing it
 into the hands of a partner, who in his turn, exerts his efforts to convey
 it to his own goal, which is often three or four miles' distance. This
 sport, therefore, requires a nimble hand, a quick eye, a swift foot, and
 skill in wrestling; as well as strength, good wind, and lungs. Formerly it
 was practised annually by those who attended corporate bodies in surveying
 the bounds of parishes; but from the many accidents that usually attended
 that game, it is now scarcely ever practised. Silver prizes used to be
 awarded to the victor in the games. A correspondent at St Ives writes :--
 </p>
 <p>HURLING THE SILVER BALL--This old custom is still
 observed at St Ives. The custom is also kept up at St Colomb and St
 Blazey, on the anniversary of the dedication of the church. St Ives Feast
 is governed by the Candlemas-day, it being the nearest Sunday next before
 that day. On the Monday after, the inhabitants assemble on the beach, when
 the ball, which is left in the custody of the mayor for the time being, is
 thrown from the churchyard to the crowd. The sides are formed in this way,
 --</p>
 <p>Toms, Wills, and Jans,<br>
 Take off all's on the san's--</p>
 <p>that is, all those of the name of Thomas, John, or
 William are ranged on one side, those of any other <i>Christian </i>name
 on the other; of late years the odd names outnumbered the Toms, Wills, and
 Jans. There is a pole erected on the beach, and each side strives to get
 the oftenest at the "goold," <i>i.e., </i>the pole the other side as
 manfully striving to keep them out, and to send their opponents as great a
 distance from the pole as possible. The tradition is, that the contest
 used to be between the parishes of Ludgvan, Lelant, audi St Ives,--St
 lves, then being part of the <i>living </i>of Ludgvan,--and that they
 used to have a friendly hurling at Ludgvan, and that afterwards the
 contest was between Lelant and St Ives. A stone near to Captain Perry's
 house is, shown, where the two parishes used to meet at the feast, and the
 struggle' was to throw the ball into the parish church, the successful
 party keeping the ball, the unsuccessful buying a new one. St Ives is said
 to have out. numbered the Lelant folks, so that they gave up the contest,
 and the ball was left with St Ives. Thus much is certain--that the feasts
 of St lves, Lelant, and Ludgvan fall properly on one Sunday, though a
 misunderstanding has arisen, Lelant claiming to be governed by the day
 before Candlemas-day,. which will alter the three every seven years.</p>
 <p>The game of hurling is now but rarely played, and the
 Sabbath is never broken by that or by any other game.</p>
