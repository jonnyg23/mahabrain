 THE ELFIN CREED OF CORNWALL.</p>

 Elves, urchins, goblins all, and little

 "I do wander everywhere, <br>
 Swifter than the moone's sphere; <br>
 And I serve the fairy queen, <br>
 To dew her orbs upon the green."<br>

 "By the moon we sport and play;<br>
 With the night begins our day;<br>
 As we dance the dew doth fall--<br>
 Trip it little urchins all;<br>
 Lightly as the little bee,<br>
 Two by two, and three by three,<br>
 And about go we, and about go we."<br>

 Because thou prizest things that are<br>
 Curious and unfamiliar."<br>
 <i>Oberon's Feast </i>.-- Robert Herrick.</p>
 <p>ln the "Fairy Mythology" of Thomas Keightley, I must refer
 all those who are desirous of examining the metamorphoses which this family of
 spiritual beings undergo, in passing from one country to another. My business
 is with the Cornish branch of this extensive family, and I shall be in a
 position to show that, notwithstanding Mr Keightley has entirely excluded
 Cornwall from consideration, there exists, even to the present day, a
 remarkable fairy mythology in that county. Between thirty and forty years
 since, ere yet the influences of our practical education had disturbed the
 poetical education of the people, every hill and valley, every tree, shrub,
 and flower was peopled with spiritual creations, deriving their
 characteristics from the physical peculiarities amidst which they were born.
 Extending over the whole district which was formerly known as Danmonium, [a] --
 embracing not only Cornwall, but Devonshire, to the eastern edge of Dartmoor,
 -- we find a mythology, which varies but little in its main features. Beyond an
 imaginary line, drawn in a north-westerly direction from the mouth of the
 Teign to the rise of the Torridge, the curiously wild and distinguishing
 superstitions of the "Cornwallers" [b] fade away, and we have those which are
 common to Somersetshire and the more fertile counties of mid-England.</p>
 <p>The Piscy or Pixy of East Devon and Somersetshire is a
 different creature from his cousin of a similar name in Cornwall. The former
 is a mischievous, but in all respects a very harmless creation, who appears to
 live a rollicking life amidst the luxuriant scenes of those beautiful
 counties. The latter, the piskies of Cornwall, appear to have their wits
 sharpened by their necessities, and may be likened to the keen and cunning
 "Arab" boy of the London streets, as seen in contrast with the clever child
 who has been reared in every comfort of a well-regulated home. A gentleman,
 well known in the literary world of London, very recently told me, that he
 once saw in Devonshire a troop of fairies. It was a breezy summer afternoon,
 and these beautiful little creatures were floating on the circling zephyrs up
 the side of a sunlit hill, and fantastically playing</p>
 <p>"Where oxlips and the nodding violet grow."</p>
 <p>They are truly the fairies of " Midsummer Night's Dream."
 They haunt the most rural and romantic' spots, and they gather</p>
 <p>"On hill, in dale, forest, or mead, <br>
 By paved fountain, or by rushy brook,<br>
 Or on the beached margent of the sea,<br>
 To dance their ringlets to the whistling wind."</p>
 <p>No such fairies are ever met with on Dartmoor. A few,
 judging from Mrs Bray's tales, [c]may have been tempted into the lovely valley
 of the Tavy, but certainly they never crossed the Tamar. The darker shades in
 the character of the Cornish fairy almost dispose me to conclude that they
 belong to an older family than those of Devonshire.</p>
 <p>It should be understood that there are in Cornwall five
 varieties of the fairy family, clearly distinguishable --</p>
 <p>1. The Small People.</p>
 <ol>
 <p>2. The Spriggans.</p>
 <p>3. Piskies, or Pigseys.</p>
 <p>4. The Buccas, Bockles, or Knockers.</p>
 <p>5. The Browneys.</p>
 </ol>
 <p>Of the Small People I have heard two accounts. Indeed, it
 is by no means clear that the tradition of their origin does not apply to the
 whole five branches of this ancient family. The Small People are believed by
 some to be the spirits of the people who inhabited Cornwall many thousands of
 years ago--long, long before the birth of Christ. That they were not good
 enough to inherit the joys of heaven, but hat they were too good to be
 condemned to eternal fires. They were said to be "poor innocents" (this phrase
 is now applied to silly children). When they first came into this land, they
 were much larger than they are now, but ever since the birth of Christ they
 have been getting smaller and smaller. Eventually they will turn into muryans
 (ants), and at last be lost from the face of the earth. These Small People are
 exceedingly playful amongst themselves, but they are usually demure when they
 know that any human eye sees them. They commonly aid those people to whom they
 take a fancy, and, frequently, they have been known to perform the most
 friendly acts towards men and women. The above notion corresponds with the
 popular belief in Ireland, which is, "that the fairies are a portion of the
 fallen angels, who, being less guilty than the rest, were not driven to hell,
 but were suffered to dwell on earth." [d] In Cornwall, as in Wales, another
 popular creed is, that the- fairies are Druids becoming--because they will
 not give up their idolatries--smaller and smaller. These Small People in many
 things closely resemble the Elves of Scandinavia.</p>
 <p>The <i>Spriggans</i> are quite a different class of beings.
 In some respects they appear to be offshoots from the-family of the Trolls of
 Sweden and Denmark. The Spriggans are found only about the cairns, coits, or
 cromlechs, burrows, or detached stones, with which it is unlucky for mortals
 to meddle. A correspondent writes: "This is known, that they were a remarkably
 mischievous arid thievish tribe. If ever a house was robbed, a child stolen,
 cattle carried away, or a building demolished, it was the work of the
 Spriggans. Whatever commotion took place in earth, air, or water, it was all
 put down as the work of these spirits. Wherever the giants have been, there
 the Spriggans have been also. It is usually considered that they are the
 ghosts of the giants; certainly, from many of their feats, we must suppose
 them to possess giant's strength. The Spriggans have the charge of buried
 treasure."</p>
 <p>The <i>Piskie</i>.--This fairy is a most mischievous and
 very unsociable sprite. His favourite fun is to entice people into the bogs by
 appearing like the light from a cottage window, or as a man carrying a
 lantern. The Piskie partakes, in many respects, of the character of the
 Spriggan. So wide-spread were their depredations, and so annoying their
 tricks, that it at one time was necessary to select persons whose acuteness
 and ready tact were a match for these quick-witted wanderers, and many a
 clever man has become famous for his power to give charms against Pigseys. it
 does not appear, however, that anything remarkable was required of the clever
 man. "No Pigsey could harm a man if his coat were inside-out, and it became a
 very common practice for persons who had to go from village to village by
 night, to wear their jacket or cloak so turned, ostensibly to prevent the dew
 from taking the shine off the cloth, but in reality to render them safe from
 the Pigseys." [e]</p>
 <p>They must have been a merry lot, since to "laugh like a
 Piskie" is a popular saying. These little fellows were great plagues to the
 farmers, riding their colts and chasing their cows.</p>
 <p>The <i>Buccas or Knockers</i>.--These are the sprites of
 the mines, and correspond to the Kobals of the German mines, the Duergars, and
 the Trolls. They are said to be the souls of the Jews who formerly worked the
 tin-mines of Cornwall. They are not allowed to rest because of their wicked
 practices as tinners, and they share in, the general curse which ignorant
 people believe still hangs on this race.</p>
 <p>The <i>Browney</i>.--This spirit was purely of the
 household. Kindly and good, he devoted his every care to benefit the family
 with whom he had taken up his abode. The Browney has fled, owing to his being
 brought into very close contact with the schoolmaster, and he is only summoned
 now upon the occasion of the swarming of the bees. When this occurs, mistress
 or maid seizes a bell-metal, or a tin pan, and, beating it, she calls
 "Browney, Browney!" as loud as she can until the good Browney compels the
 bees to settle.</p>
 <p>Mr Thorns has noticed that in Cornwall "the moths which
 some regard as departed souls, others as fairies, are called <i>Pisgies</i>."
 This is somewhat too generally expressed; the belief respecting the moth, so
 far as I know, is confined to one or two varieties only. Mr Couch informs us
 that the local name, around Polperro, of the weasel is <i>Fairy</i>. So that
 we have evidence of some sort of metempsychosis amongst the elf family. Moths,
 ants, and weasels it would seem are the forms taken by those wandering
 spirits.</p>
 <p>We read in Bishop Corbet, whose work was published in 1648,
 and was reprinted many years after by Bishop Percy--</p>
 <p>"The fairies<br>
 Were of the old profession;<br>
 Their songs were Ave Ma vies,<br>
 Their dances were procession.<br>
 But now, alas they all are dead,<br>
 Or gone beyond the seas,<br>
 Or, further, for religion fled,<br>
 Or else they take their ease."</p>
 <p>Other writers have supposed that at the time of the
 Reformation the fairies departed from the land. This hypothesis is not
 warranted by evidence. It is possible that they may have taken pos.. session
 of some of the inferior creatures, but they are certainly still to be found in
 those regions which lie beyond the reach of the railway-giant, with his fiery
 mouth, or of that electric spirit who, travelling on his mysterious wires, can
 beat the wildest elf that ever mounted "night-steeds."</p>

 the limits of Devon where the ancient eastern boundary was, between the Belgae
 and Durotriges on the east, and Danmonii on the west, ancient Cornwall will
 have included all Devon, as well as what is west of the Tamar."--Camden's,

 the Saxons."--Camden's: <i>Brtannia</i>, vol i, p. cxxxix.</p>

 <p>[e] The Cornish had formerly a great
 belief in piskays or fairies. If a traveller happened to lose his way, he
 immediately concluded he was "piskay led." To dispel the charm with which the
 "piskay-led" traveller was entangled, nothing was deemed sufficient but that
 of his turning one of his garments inside-out. This generally fell upon one of
 his stockings; and if this precaution bad been taken before the commencement
 of the journey, it was fully believed that no such delusion would have
 happened--<i>Drew and Hitchins' History of Cornwall</i>, p. 97</p>
