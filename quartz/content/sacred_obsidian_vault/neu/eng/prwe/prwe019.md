 <p align="CENTER">THE GIANT BOLSTER.</p>
 <p><br>
 HIS mighty man held especial possession of the hill formerly known as <i>Carne
 Bury-anacht</i> or <i>Bury-anack</i>, [a] "the sparstone grave," sometimes
 called <i>St Agnes' Ball</i> and <i>St Agnes' Pestis</i>, but which is now
 named, from the use made of the hill during the long war, St Agnes' Beacon. He
 has left his name to a very interesting, and undoubtedly most ancient
 earthwork, which still exists at the base of the hill, and evidently extended
 from Trevaunance Porth to Chapel Porth, enclosing the most important tin
 district in St Agnes. This is constantly called "The Bolster."</p>
 <p>Bolster must have been of enormous size: since it is stated
 that he could stand with one foot on St Agnes' Beacon and the other on Carn
 Brea; these hills being distant, as the bird flies, six miles, [b] his
 immensity will be clear to all. In proof of this, there still exists, in the
 valley running upwards from Chapel Porth, a stone in which may yet be seen the
 impression of the giant's fingers. On one occasion, Bolster, when enjoying his
 usual stride from the Beacon to Carn Brea, felt thirsty, and stooped to drink
 out of the well at Chapel Porth, resting, while he did so, on the
 above-mentioned stone. We hear but little of the wives of our giants; but
 Bolster had a wife, who was made to labour hard by her tyrannical husband. On
 the top of St Agnes' Beacon there yet exist the evidences of the useless
 labours to which this unfortunate giantess was doomed, in grouped masses of
 small stones. These, it is said, have all been gathered from an estate at the
 foot of the hill, immediately adjoining the village of St Agnes. This farm is
 to the present day remarkable for its freedom from stones, though situated
 amidst several others, which, like most lands reclaimed from the moors of this
 district, have stones in abundance mixed with the soil. Whenever Bolster was
 angry with his wife, he compelled her to pick stones, and to carry them in her
 apron to the top of the hill. There is some confusion in the history of this
 giant, and of the blessed St Agnes to whom the church is dedicated. They are
 supposed to have lived at the same time, which, according to our views, is
 scarcely probable, believing, as we do, that no giants existed long after
 their defeat at Plymouth by Brutus and Corineus. There may have been an
 earlier saint of the same name; or may not Saint Enns or Anns, the popular
 name of this parish, indicate some other lady?</p>
 <p>Be this as it may, the giant Bolster became deeply in love
 with St Agnes, who is reputed to have been singularly beautiful, and a pattern
 woman of virtue. The giant allowed the lady no repose. He followed her
 incessantly, proclaiming his love, and filling the air with the tempests of
 his sighs and groans. St Agnes lectured Bolster in vain on the impropriety of
 his conduct, he being already a married man. This availed not; her prayers to 
 him to relieve her from his importunities were also in vain. The persecuted
 lady, finding there was no release for her, while this monster existed,
 resolved to be rid of him at any cost, and eventually succeeded by the
 following stratagem:-- Agnes appeared at length to be persuaded of the
 intensity of the giant's love, but she told him she required yet one small
 proof more. There exists at Chapel Porth a hole in the cliff at the
 termination of the valley. If Bolster would fill this hole with his blood the
 lady would no longer look coldly on him. This huge bestrider-of-the-hills
 thought that it was an easy thing which was required of him, and felt that he
 could fill many such holes and be none the weaker for the loss of blood.
 Consequently, stretching his great arm across the hole, he plunged a knife
 into a vein, and a torrent of gore issued forth. Roaring and seething the
 blood fell to the bottom, and the giant expected in a few minutes to see the
 test of his devotion made evident, in the filling of the hole. It required
 much more blood than Bolster had supposed; still it must in a short time be
 filled, so he bled on. Hour after hour the blood flowed from the vein, yet the
 hole was not filled. Eventually the giant fainted from exhaustion. The
 strength of life within his mighty frame enabled him to rally, yet he had no
 power to lift himself from the ground, and he was unable to stanch the wound
 which he had made. Thus it was, that after many throes, the giant Bolster died
 !</p>
 <p>The cunning saint, in proposing this task to Bolster, was
 well aware that the hole opened at the bottom into the sea, and that as
 rapidly as the blood flowed into the hole it ran from it, and did</p>
 <p>"The multitudinous seas incarnadine,<br>
 Making the green one red."</p>
 <p>Thus the lady got rid of her hated lover; Mrs Bolster was
 released, and the district freed from the presence of a tyrant. The hole at
 Chapel Porth still retains the evidences of the truth of this tradition, in
 the red stain which marks the track down which flowed the giant's blood.</p>
 <p>There is another tradition, in some respects resembling
 this one, respecting a giant who dwelt at Goran, on the south Coast.</p>
