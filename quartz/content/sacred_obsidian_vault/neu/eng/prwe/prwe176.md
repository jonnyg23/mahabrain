 <p align="CENTER">THE LORD OF PENGERSWICK AN ENCHANTER.</p>
 <p>THE Lord of Pengerswick came from some Eastern clime,
 bringing with him a foreign lady of great beauty. She was considered by all
 an "outlandish" woman; and by many declared to be a "Saracen." [a]<i> </i>No
 one, beyond the selected servants, was ever allowed within the walls of
 Pengerswick Castle; and they, it was said, were bound by magic spells. No
 one dared tell of anything transacted within the walls; consequently all.
 was conjecture amongst the neighbouring peasantry, miners, and fishermen.
 Certain it was, they said, that Pengerswick would shut himself up for days
 together in his chamber, burning strange things, which sent their strong
 odours,--not only to every part of the castle,--</p>
 <p>
 but for miles around the country. Often at night, and especially in
 stormy weather, Pengerswick was heard for hours together calling up the
 spirits, by reading from his books in some unknown tongue. On those
 occasions his voice would roll through the halls louder than the surging
 waves which beat against the neighbouring rocks, the spirits replying like
 the roar of thunder. Then would all the servants rush in fright from the
 building, and remain crowded together, even in the most tempestuous night,
 in one of the open courts. Fearful indeed would be the strife between the
 man and the demons ; and it sometimes happened that the spirits were too
 powerful for the enchanter. He was, however, constantly and carefully
 watched by his wife; and whenever the strife became too serious, her harp
 was heard making the softest, the sweetest music. At this the spirits fled;
 and they were heard passing through the air towards the Land's-End, moaning
 like the soughing of a depart­ing storm. The lights would then be
 extinguished in the enchanter's tower, and all would be peace. The servants
 would return to their apartments with a feeling of perfect confidence. They
 feared their master, but their mistress inspired them with love. Lady
 Pengers­wick was never seen beyond the grounds surrounding the castle. She
 sat all day in lonely state and pride in her tower, the lattice-window of
 her apartment being high on the seaward side. Her voice accompanying the
 music of her harp was rarely heard, hut when she warbled the soft love
 strains of her Eastern land. Often at early dawn the very fishes of the
 neighbouring bay would raise their heads above the surface of the waters,
 enchanted by the music and the voice; and it is said that the mermaids from
 the Lizard, and many of the strange spirits of the waters, would come near
 to Pengerswick cove, drawn by the same influence. On moonlight nights the
 air has often seemed to be full of sound, and yet the lady's voice was
 seldom louder than that of a warbling bird. On these occasions, men have
 seen thousands of spirits gliding up and down the moonbeams, and floating
 idly on the silvered waves, listening to, and sometimes softly echoing, the
 words which Lady Pengerswick sang. Long did this strange pair inhabit this
 lonely castle; and although the Lord of Pengerswick frequently rode abroad
 on a most magnificent horse--which had the reputation of being of Satanic
 origin, it was at once so docile to its master and so wild to any other
 person,--yet he made no acquaintance with any of the neighbour­ing gentry.
 He was feared by all, and yet they respected him for many of the good deeds
 performed by him. He completely enthralled the Giants of the Mount; and
 before he disappeared from Cornwall,
 they died, owing, it was said, to grief and want of food.</p>
 <p>
  Where the Lord of Pengerswick
 came from, no one knew; he, with his lady, with two attendants, who never
 spoke in any but an Eastern tongue, which was understood by none around
 them, made their appearance one winter's day, mounted on beautiful horses,
 evidently from Arabia or some distant land.</p>
 <p>
  They soon--having gold in abundance--got
 possession of a cottage; and in a marvellously short time the castle, which
 yet bears his name, was rebuilt by this lord. Many affirm that the lord by
 the force of his enchantments, and the lady by the spell of her voice,
 compelled the spirits of the earth and air to work for them; and that three
 nights were sufficient to rear an enormous pile, of which but one tower now
 remains.</p>
 <p>
  Their coming was sudden and mysterious;
 their going was still more so. Years had rolled on, and the people around
 were familiarised with those strange neighbours, from whom also they derived
 large profits, since they paid whatsoever price was demanded for any article
 which they required. One day a stranger was seen in Market-Jew, whose face
 was bronzed by long exposure to an Eastern sun. No one knew him; and he
 eluded the anxious inquiries of the numerous gossips, who were especially
 anxious to learn something of this man, who, it was surmised by every one,
 must have some connection with Pengerswick or his lady; yet no one could
 assign any reason for such a supposition. Week after week passed away, and
 the stranger remained in the town, giving no sign. Wonder was on every old
 woman's lips, and expressed in every old man's eyes; but they had to wonder
 on. One thing, it was said, had been noticed; and this seemed to confirm the
 suspicions of the people. The stranger wandered out on dark nights--spent
 them, it was thought on the sea-shore; and some fishermen said they had seen
 him seated on the rock at the entrance of the valley of
 Pengerswic'k. It was thought that the lord kept more at home than usual, and of late
 no one had heard his incantation songs and sounds; neither had they heard
 the harp of the lady. A very tempestuous night, singular for its gloom--
 when even the ordinary light, which, on the darkest night, is evident to the
 traveller in the open country, it did not exist--appears to have brought
 things to their climax. There was a sudden alarm in Market-Jew, a red glare
 in the eastern sky, and presently a burst of flames above the hill, and St
 Michael's Mount was illuminated in a remarkable manner.
 Pengerswick
 Castle was on fire; the servants fled in terror; but neither the lord nor his
 lady could be found. From that day to the present they were lost to all.</p>
 <p>
  The interior of the castle was entirely
 destroyed; not a vestige of furniture, books, or anything belonging to the
 "Enchanter" could be found. He and everything belonging to him had vanished,
 and, strange to tell, from that night the bronzed stranger was never again
 seen. The inhabitants of Market-Jew naturally crowded to the fire; and when
 all was over they returned to their homes, speculating on the strange
 occurrences of the night. Two of the oldest people always declared that,
 when the flames were at the highest, they saw two men and a lady floating in
 the midst of the lire, and that they ascended from amidst the falling walls,
 passed through the air like lightning, and disappeared.</p>
