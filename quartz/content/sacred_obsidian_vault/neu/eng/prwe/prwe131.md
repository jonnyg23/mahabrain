 ST GERMAN'S WELL.</p>
 <p>THE good St German was, it would appear, sent into
 Cornwall in the reign of the Emperor Valentinian, mainly to suppress the
 Pelagian heresy. The inhabitants of the shores of the Tamar had long been
 schooled into -the belief in original sin, and they would not endure its
 denial from the lips of a stranger. In this they were supported by the
 monks, who had already a firm footing in the land, and who taught the people
 implicit obedience to their religious instructors, faith in election, and
 that all human efforts were unavailing, unless supported by priestly aid. St
 German was a man with vast powers of endurance. He preached his doctrines of
 freewill, and of the value of good works, notwithstanding the outcry raised
 against him. His miracles were of the most remarkable character, and
 sufficiently impressive to convince a large body of the Cornish people that
 he was an inspired priest. St German raised a beautiful church, and built a
 monastic house for the relief of poor people. Yet notwithstanding the
 example of the pure life of the saint, and his unceasing study to do good, a
 large section of the priests and the people never ceased to persecute him.
 To all human endurance there is a limit, and even that of the saint weakened
 eventually, before the never-ceasing annoyances -by which he was hemmed in.</p>
 <p>One Sabbath morning the priest attended as usual to his
 Christian duties, when he was interrupted by a brawl amongst the outrageous
 people, who had come in from all parts of 'the country with a determination
 to drive him from the place of his adoption. The holy man prayed for his
 persecutors, and he entreated them to calm their angry passions and listen
 to his healing words. But no words could convey any healing balm to their
 stormy hearts. At length his brethren, fearing that his life was in danger,
 begged him to fly, and eventually he left the church by a small door near
 the altar, while some of the monks endeavoured to tranquillise the people.
 St German went, a sad man, to the cliffs at the Rame head, and there alone
 he wept in agony at the failure of his labours. So intense was the
 soul-suffering of this holy man, that the rocks felt the power of
 spirit-struggling, and wept with him. The eyes of man, a spiritual creation,
 dry after the outburst of sorrow, but when the gross forms of matter are
 compelled to sympathise with spiritual sorrow, they remain for ever under
 the influence; and from that day the tears of the cliffs have continued to
 fall, and the Well of St German attests to this day of the saint's agony.
 The saint was not allowed to remain in concealment long. The crowd of
 opposing priests and the peasantry were on his track. Hundreds were on the
 hill, and arming themselves with stones, they descended with shouts,
 determined to destroy him. St German prayed to God for deliverance, and
 immediately a rush, as of thunder, was heard upon the hills--a chariot
 surrounded by flames, and flashing light in all directions, was seen rapidly
 approaching. The crowd paused, fell back, and the flaming car passed on to
 where St German knelt. There were two bright angels in the chariot; they
 lifted the persecuted saint from the ground, and placing him between them,
 ascended into the air.</p>
 <p>"Curse your persecutors," said the angels. The saint
 cursed them; and from that time all holiness left the church he had built.
 The saint was borne to other lands, and lived to effect great good. On the
 rocks the burnt tracts of the chariot wheels were long to be seen, and the
 Well of Tears still flows.</p>
