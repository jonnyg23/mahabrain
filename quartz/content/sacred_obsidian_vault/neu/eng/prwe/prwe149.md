 <p align="CENTER">THE WELL AT ALTAR-NUN.</p>
 <p>CURE OF INSANITY.</p>
 <p>MONGST the numerous holy wells which exist in Cornwall,
 that of Alternosi, or Altar-Nun, is the only one, as far as I can learn,
 which possessed the virtue of curing the insane.</p>
 <p>We are told that Saint Nunne or Nuanita was the daughter
 of an Earl of Cornwall, and the mother of St David; that the holy well,
 which is situated about a mile from the cathedral of St David, was dedicated
 to her; and that she bestowed on the waters of the Cornish well those
 remarkable powers, which were not given to the Welsh one, from her fondness
 for the county of her birth.</p>
 <p>Carew, in his "Survey of Cornwall," thus describes the
 practice :-- </p>
 <p>"The water running from St Nun's well fell into a square and
 enclosed walled plot, which might be filled at what depth they listed. Upon
 this wall was the frantic person put to stand, his back towards the pool,
 and from thence, with a sudden blow in the breast, tumbled headlong into the
 pond; where a strong fellow, provided for the nonce, took him, and tossed
 him up and down, amongst and athwart the water, till the patient, by
 foregoing his' strength, had somewhat forgot his fury. Then was he conveyed
 to the church, and certain masses said over him; upon which handling, if his
 right wits returned, St Nun had the thanks; but if there appeared small
 amendment, he was bowssened again and again, while there remained in him any
 hope of life or recovery."</p>
 <p>The 2d of March is dedicated to St Nun, and the influence
 of the water is greatly exalted on that day.</p>
 <p>Although St Nun's well has been long famous, and the
 celebrity of its waters extended far, yet there was a belief prevailing
 amidst the uneducated, that the sudden shock produced by suddenly plunging
 an insane person into water was most effective in producing a return to
 reason.</p>
 <p>On one occasion, a woman of weak mind, who was suffering
 under the influence of a religious monomania, consulted me on the benefit
 she might hope to receive from electricity. The burden of her
 ever-melancholy tale was, that "she had lost her God; "and she told me, with
 a strange mixture of incoherence and reason, that her conviction was, that a
 sudden shock would cure her. She had herself proposed to her husband and
 friends that they should take her to a certain rock on St Michael's Mount,
 stand her on it, with her back to the sea, when "the waters were the
 strongest, at the flowing of the tide;" and after having prayed with her,
 give her the necessary blow on the chest, and thus plunge her into the
 waters below. I know not that the experiment was ever made in the case of
 this poor woman, but I have heard of several instances where this sudden
 plunge had been tried as a cure for insanity.</p>
 <p>Mr T. Q. Couch thus describes the present condition of
 this well in a paper on "Well-Worship: " [a]</p>
 <p>"On the western side of the beautiful valley through
 which flows the Trelawney River, and near Hobb's Park, in the parish of
 Pelynt, Cornwall, is St Nun's, or St Ninnie's Well. Its position was, until
 lately, to be discovered by the oak-tree matted with ivy, and the thicket of
 willow and bramble which grew upon its roof. The front of the well is of a
 pointed form, and has a rude entrance about four feet high, and spanned
 above by a single flat stone, which leads into a grotto with arched roof.
 The walls on the interior are draped with luxuriant fronds of spleenwort,
 hart's-tongue, and a rich undercovering of liverwort. At the further end of
 the floor is a round granite basin, with a deeply moulded brim, and
 ornamented on' its circumference with a series of rings, each enclosing a
 cross or a ball. The water weeps into it from an opening at the back, and
 escapes again by a hole in the bottom. This interesting piece of antiquity
 has been protected by a tradition which we could wish to attach to some of
 our cromlechs and circles in danger of spoliation."</p>
 <p>According to the narrative given by Mr Bond in his "History
 of Looe," the sacred</p>
 <p>protection given must have been limited in time, as the
 following story will prove :-- </p>
 <p>"KIPPISCOMBE LANE,</p>
 <p>Probably so called from a consecrated well on the right
 hand .side of the road. The titular saint of this well is supposed to have
 been St Cuby, now corrupted into Keby's Well. The spring flows Into a
 circular basin or reservoir of granite, or of some stone like it, two feet
 four inches at its extreme diameter at top, and about two feet high. It
 appears to have been neatly carved and ornamented in its lower part with the
 figure of a griffin, and round the edge with dolphins, now much defaced. The
 water was formerly carried off by a drain or hole at the bottom, like those
 usually seen in fonts and piscinas. This basin (which I take to be an old
 font) was formerly much respected by the neighbours, who conceived some
 great misfortune would befall the person who should attempt to remove it
 from where it stood, and that it required immense power to remove it. A
 daring fellow, however (says a story), once went with a team of oxen for the
 express purpose of removing it. On his arrival at the spot, one of the oxen
 fell down dead, which so alarmed the fellow that he desisted from the
 attempt he was about to make. There are several loose stones scattered round
 this basin or reservoir, perhaps the remains of some building which formerly
 enclosed it--a small chapel likely. The last time I saw this reservoir, it
 had been taken many feet from where it used to stand, and a piece of the
 brim of it had been recently struck off ?'</p>
