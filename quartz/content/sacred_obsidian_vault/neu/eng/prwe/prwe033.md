 <p align="CENTER">THE SPRIGGAN'S CHILD, AS TOLD BY A CORNISH DROLL.</p>
 <p><br>
 I'LL tell you a tale, an you've patience to hear an, <br>
 'Bout the Spriggans, that swarm round Partinney still-- <br>
 You knew Janey Tregeer, who lives in Brea Vean,</p>
 <p>In the village just under the Chapel Hill.<br>
 One arternoon she went out for to reap,<br>
 And left the child in the cradle asleep:<br>
 Janey took good care to cover the fire;-- <br>
 Turn'd down the brandis on the baking.ire (iron),<br>
 Swept up the ashes on the hearthstone,<br>
 And so left the child in the house all alone--<br>
 The boys had all on 'em gone away,<br>
 Some to work and some to play.<br>
 Janey work'd in the field as gay as a lark,<br>
 And when she came home it was nearly dark;<br>
 The furst thing she saw when she open'd the door<br>
 Was the cradle upset--all the straw on the floor.</p>
 <p>But no child in sight--<br>
 She search'd all round --<br>
 Still no child was found:<br>
 And it got dark night.<br>
 So great was Jane's fright,<br>
 That for more than an hour<br>
 She hadn't the power <br>
 To strike a light.</p>
 <ul>
 </ul>
 <p>However, she kindled the fire at last,<br>
 And threw in a faggot to make a blast.<br>
 As she stoop'd over the wood.corner stone, <br>
 She heard a sound 'tween a cry and a moan --<br>
 It clearly came from a bundle of ferns--<br>
 The two bigger boy's bed--<br>
 And there, sure enough, as frighten'd she turns, <br>
 Janey saw the child's head.</p>
 <p>'Twas very queer. How the child got there, <br>
 Nobody could say;Yet ever since that day, the <br>
 And blinking and peeping, when it ought to be sleeping,<br>
 But seldom it closed its eyes. <br>
 Jane said for a child it look'd too wise --<br>
 That, she thought it a changeling<br>
 She didn't disguise--<br>
 And often and often the gave it a beating,<br>
 To stop--but she couldn't--its cussed bleating.<br>
  </p>
 <p>Janey resolved to work the spell,<br>
 And whene'er she could stay, <br>
 She bath'd the brat in the Chapel Well --<br>
 Which he thought rare play. </p>
 <p>On the three first Wednesdays in flow'ry May<br>
 She plunged it deep at the dawn of day--<br>
 Pass'd it slowly three times against the sun,<br>
 Went three times round,--and when all was clone,<br>
 The imp of a child roar'd aloud for fun. <br>
 No tongue can tell<br>
 The trouble it gave her<br>
 To dip the shaver, <br>
 And work the spell.</p>
 <p>From Brea to Chapel-Uny is a mile or more,<br>
 And surely it tried Janey's patience sore<br>
 To trudge forth and back from the Chapel Well,<br>
 With this brat on her back, to work the spell.<br>
 <br>
 She wish'd it dead; but it wouldn't die:<br>
 It ate its bread, it would pine and cry;<br>
 And Janey was nearly beside herself<br>
 With this plague of her life--this wicked elf.</p>
 
 <p>Well, one rainy day,--as it rains in May,-- <br>
 Janey set out with the child in her arms<br>
 Once more to work the holy charms.<br>
 When very close to the top of the hill, <br>
 Where she was sure there was nobody near,<br>
 She heard the strangest voice in her ear,<br>
 Saying these words, quite clear and shrill --<br>
 <i>
 "Tredrill Tredrill! thy wife and children greet thee well."</i></p>
 
 <p>Oh, Janey's heart-strings were like to crack,<br>
 When up spake the thing in her arms, good lack!--<br>
 " For wife or child little care I,<br>
 They may laugh,<br>
 Or they may cry,--<br>
 While milk I quaff;<br>
 When I am dry--<br>
 Get of my pap my fill<br>
 Whenever I will,<br>
 On the dowdy's back ride,<br>
 With my legs astride,<br>
 When we work the spell<br>
 At the Chapel Well"</p>
 <i>
 </i>
 <p>Janey dropp'd the cussed thing on the ground,<br>
 And turn'd round, and round, and round;<br>
 You may be sure she was in a fright<br>
 To hear the sound, and nobody in sight,<br>
 And to hear a child talkMonths before it could walk.<br>
 She has said o'er and -o'er, <br>
 And I am sure you can't wonder,<br>
 'Twouldn't frighten her more,<br>
 Had the rocks burst asunder,<br>
 And the earth belch'd forth thunder,</p>
 <i>
 </i>
 <p>When Janey at length got over the fright<br>
 From hearing the sound and nobody in sight,<br>
 And the brat which lay crying, as if it was dying,<br>
 Talking out like a man of his wife and his child,<br>
 She felt all bedazzled as if she was wild--<br>
 Took the brat by the arm, flung it over her shoulder--<br>
 Wouldn't believe it her child if the parson had told her--<br>
 Thought the devil was in it,<br>
 As she ran the hill down,<br>
 Without -stopping a minute<br>
 Till she came to Brea -town.</p>
 <p>The old women came out, and all on 'em agreed <br>
 'Twas the strangest thing that ever they seed; <br>
 They stood in a row, and each one had a word --<br>
 'Twas the wonderfull'st story that ever they heard; <br>
 'Twas a Spriggan's brat--they were all sure of that--<br>
 No more like Jane's child than an old ram-cat. <br>
 She must beat it black, she must beat it blue, <br>
 Bruise its body all o'er with the heel of her shoe--<br>
 Then lay it alone beneath the church stile, <br>
 And keep out of hearing and sight for a while--<br>
 When every one said, as every one thought, <br>
 That Janey's child would again be brought:<br>
 Some said 'twould be living--some said 'twould be dead - <br>
 But the Spriggan's base brat she no longer need dread.</p>
 <i>
 </i>
 <p>Jane beat the babe black,<br>
 And she beat the babe blue,<br>
 On the ashes' pile before the door;<br>
 And she would have beaten it ten times more,<br>
 But out of her hand she lost her shoe,<br>
 Struck away all at once - by she couldn't tell who.</p>
 <i>
 </i>
 <p>The brat bad roar'd--it could roar no more--<br>
 So they carried it off to the old church stile,<br>
 And laid it under the stones--some swore<br>
 That when placed on the earth it was seen to smile --<br>
 Then all turn'd back, and kept far out of sight<br>
 And Janey declared she was almost wild:<br>
 But they kept her back till the turn o' the night,<br>
 When she rush'd to the stile and found her own child</p>
 <p>'Twas there, sure enough, her own dear child<br>
 But when first she saw it,<br>
 She did not know it-- It look'd so frighten'd--it seem'd so
 wild.</p>
 <i>
 </i>
 <p>Then the old women said,<br>
 If it keeps its wits,<br>
 We're sadly afraid<br>
 The poor babe will have fits.</p>
 <p>A friend writes me:-- "I saw an account in a newspaper the other
 day of an Irishwoman who was brought before the magistrates, in New York, for
 causing the death of a child by making it stand on <i>hot coals</i>, to try if
 it were her own truly begotten child, or a changeling. I think the notion was,
 that her own child</p>
 <p>would stand fire, but an imp would either die, to all <i>
 appearance</i>, or be spirited away. This is much worse than the plan of the
 woman of Brea Vean, who put the brat on the ashes' pile, and beat it black with
 the broom." [a]</p>

 in all its chief features, similar to this story, even to the beating hint
 without mercy. "Icelandic Legends. Collected by John Arnason: Translated by
