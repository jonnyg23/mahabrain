 <p align="CENTER">PENGERSWICK CASTLE.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">
 <b> </b>THIS castellated
 building--for it does not now admit of being called a castle,
 notwithstanding its embattled turrets and its machicolated gate--is
 situated in a hollow running down to Pengerswick Cove, in the Mount's Bay,
 where there never could have been anything to defend; and certainly there is
 nothing to induce any one to incur the cost of such a building.</p>
 <p>Mr Milliton, in the reign of Henry VIII., slew in the
 streets of London a man in a drunken brawl. He fled, and went to sea. It is
 not known to what part of the world he went, but we are told that he became
 excessively rich; so rich, indeed, that "when he loaded his ass with his
 gold, the weight was so great as to break the poor animal's back." Returning
 to his country, and not daring to appear in any of the large towns, he
 bought the manor of Pengerswick, and built this castle, to defend himself;
 in the event of his being approached by any of the officers of the law.</p>
 <p>A miserable man, Milliton is said to have lived in a
 secret chamber in this tower, and <b>to </b>have been visited only by his
 most trusted friends. Deeply deploring the crime that had condemned him to
 seclusion from the world, he spent his dreary hours in ornamenting his
 dwelling. His own story is supposed to be told in the painting of an
 overladen ass in one room, with a black-letter legend, importing that a
 miser is like an ass loaded with riches, who, without attending to his
 golden burden, feeds on thistles. There is also a carving of water wearing a
 hollow in a stone, and under it the word "Perseverance." Of the death of
 Milliton we have no account.</p>
 <p>There is very little doubt but that Pengerswick Castle is
 very much older than the time of Milliton; indeed tradition informs us that
 he purchased the place. The legends previously given, and others in my
 possession, refer to a much earlier period. The castle was, it is said,
 surrounded by trees; but John Hals, who inherited the property, had all the
 timber cut down and sold.</p>
