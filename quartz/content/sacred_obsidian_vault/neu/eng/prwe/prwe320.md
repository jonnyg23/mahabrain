 <p align="CENTER">A FAIRY CAUGHT</p>
 <p>THE following, communicated to me on the 8th of August, is
 too good to be lost. I therefore give it in my correspondent's own words :--
 </p>
 <p>"I heard last week of three fairies having been seen in
 Zennor very recently. A man who lived at the foot of Trendreen hill, in
 the valley of Treridge, I think, was cutting furze on the hill. Near the
 middle of the day he saw one of the small people, not more than a foot
 long, stretched at full length and fast asleep, on a bank of griglans
 (heath), [a] surrounded by high brakes of furze. The man took off his
 furze cuff, and slipped the little man into it, without his waking up;
 went down to the house; took the little fellow out of the cuff on the
 hearthstone, when he awakened, and seemed quite pleased and at home,
 beginning to play with the children, who were well pleased with the
 small body, and called him Bobby Griglans.</p>
 <b>
 </b><p>"The old people were very careful not to let Bob out
 of the house, or be seen by the neighbours, as he promised to show the man
 where the crocks of gold were buried on the hill. A few days after he was
 brought from the hill, all the neighbours came with their horses (according
 to custom) to bring home the winter's reek of furze, which had to he brought
 down the hill in trusses on the backs of the horses. That Bob might be safe
 and out of sight, he and the children were shut up in the barn. Whilst the
 furzecarriera were in to dinner, the prisoners contrived to get out, to have
 a 'courant' round the furze-reek, when they saw a little man and woman, not
 much larger than Bob, searching into every hole and corner among the trusses
 that were dropped round the unfinished reek. The little woman was wringing
 her hands and crying, 'O my dear and tender Skillywidden, wherever canst ah
 (thou) be gone to? shall I ever east eyes on thee again?' 'Go 'e back,' says
 Bob to the children; 'my father and mother are come here too.' He then cried
 out, 'Here I am, mammy !' By the time the words were out of his mouth, the
 little man and woman, with their precious Skillywidden, were nowhere to be
 seen, snd there has been no sight nor sign of them since. The children got a
 sound thrashing for letting Skillywidden escape."</p>
 <p>[a] Quite recently I heard, in St
 Agnes, heath-flowers called "the blowth of the griglans ?</p>
