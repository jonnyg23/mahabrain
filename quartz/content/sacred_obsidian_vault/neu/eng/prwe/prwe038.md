 <p align="CENTER">THE FAIRY REVELS ON THE "GUMP", ST. JUST.</p>
 <p><br>
 LONG has the Gump been the reputed playground of the Small People. Many of the
 good old people were permitted to witness their revels, and for years they
 have delighted their grandchildren with tales of the songs they have heard,
 and of the sights they have seen. To many of their friends those fairies have
 given small but valuable presents; but woe to the man or woman who would dare
 to intrude upon the ground occupied by them at the time of their high
 festivals. There was a covetous old hunks in St Just--never mind his name, he
 was severely punished, let that suffice--well, this old fellow had heard so
 much of the riches displayed by the little people, when holding holiday on the
 Gump, that he resolved to get some of the treasures. He learned all he could
 learn from his neighbours, but kept his intention to himself. It was during
 the harvest-moon--the night was a softened day--and everything abroad on
 such a night should have been in harmony with its quiet brilliancy. But here
 was a dark soul passing along, making a small eclipse with his black shadow.
 The old man stole towards the rendezvous of the "good people," as some were
 fond of calling them, anxiously looking out for the treasures which he
 coveted. At length, when he had not advanced far on the Gump, he heard music
 of the most ravishing kind. Its influence was of a singularly mysterious
 character. As the notes were solemn and slow, or quick and gay, the old man
 was moved from tears to laughter; and on more than- one occasion he was
 compelled to dance in obedience to the time. Notwithstanding that he was
 almost bewildered by the whirling motion to which he was compelled, the old
 man "kept his wits awake," and waited his opportunity to seize some fairy
 treasure; but as yet nothing remarkable had presented itself. The music
 appeared to surround him, and, as he thought, to come closer to him than it
 was at first; and although its sound led him to believe that the musicians
 were on the surface, he was impressed with an idea that they were realty
 beneath the earth Eventually there was a crash of sound, startling beyond
 description, and the hill before him opened. All was now ablaze with
 variously-coloured lights. Every blade of grass was hung with lamps, and every
 furze bush was illuminated with stars Out from the opening in the hill marched
 a host of spriggans, as if to clear the road. Then came an immense number of
 musicians playing on every kind of instrument. These were followed by troop
 after troop of soldiers, each troop bearing aloft their banner, which appeared
 to spread itself, to display its blazonry, without the assistance of any
 breeze. All these arranged themselves in order over the ground, some here and
 some there. One thing was not at all to our friend's liking; several hundreds
 of the most grotesque of the spriggans placed themselves so as to enclose the
 spot on which he was standing. Yet, as they were none of them higher than his
 shoe-tie, he thought he could "squash" them easily with his foot if they were
 up to any mischief and so he consoled himself. This vast array having disposed
 of themselves, first came a crowd of servants bearing vessels of silver and
 vessels of gold, goblets cut out of diamonds, rubies, and other precious
 stones. There were others laden, almost to overflowing, with the richest
 meats, pastry, preserves, and fruits. Presently the ground was covered with
 tables and everything was arranged in the most systematic order,--each party
 failing back as they disposed of their burdens.</p>
 <p>The brilliancy of the scene nearly overpowered the old man;
 but, when he was least prepared for it, the illumination became a thousand
 times more intense. Out of the hill were crowding thousands upon thousands of
 lovely ladies and gentlemen, arrayed in the most costly attire. He thought
 there would be no end to the coming crowd. By and by, however, the music
 suddenly changed, and the harmonious sounds which fell upon his ears appeared
 to give new life to every sense. His eyes were clearer, his ears quicker, and
 his sense of smell more exquisite.</p>
 <p>The odours of flowers, more delicious than any he had eves
 smelt, filled the air. He saw, without any disturbing medium, the brilliant
 beauty of the thousands of ladies who were now upon the Gump; and their voices
 were united in one gush of song, which was clear as silver bells--a hymeneal
 symphony of the utmost delicacy. The words were in a language unknown to him,
 but he saw they were directed towards a new group now emerging from the hill.</p>
 <p>First came a great number of female children clothed in the
 whitest gauze, strewing flowers on the Gump. These were not dead or cut
 flowers, for the moment they touched the ground they took root and grew. These
 were followed by an equally large number of boys, holding in their hands
 shells which appeared to be strung like harps, and from which they brought
 forth murmurs of melody, such as angels only could hope to hear and live. Then
 came--and there was no end to their coming--line upon line of little men
 clothed in green and gold, and by and by a forest of banners, which, at a
 signal, were all furled. Then, seated on thrones, carried upon a platform
 above the heads of the men, came a young prince and princess who blazed with
 beauty and jewels, as if they were suns amidst a skyey host of stars. There
 was much ceremonial marching to and fro, but eventually the platform was
 placed upon a mound on the Gump, which was now transformed into a hillock of
 roses and lilies; and around this all the ladies and gentlemen walked, bowing,
 and each one saying something to the princess and the prince,--passing onward
 and taking their seats at the tables. Although no man could count the number
 of this fairy host, there was no confusion; all the ladies and gentlemen
 found, as if by instinct, their places. When all were seated, a signal was
 given by the prince; servants in splendid liveries placed tables crowded with
 gold-plate and good things on the platform, and every one, the prince and
 princess included, began to feast with a will. Well, thought the old man, now
 is my time; if I could only crawl up to the prince's table, I should have a
 catch sure enough, and become a rich man for life. With his greedy mind fixed
 on this one object, and unobservant of everything else, he crouched down, as
 though by, so doing he could escape observation, and very slowly and
 stealthily advanced amongst the revellers. He never saw that thousands of
 spriggans had thrown little strings about him, and that they still held the
 ends of the threads. The presence of this selfish old mortal did not in any
 way discompose the assembly; they ate and drank and were as merry as though no
 human eye was looking on them. The old man was wondrous cautious lest he
 should disturb the feasters, consequently a long time was spent in getting, as
 he desired, to the back of the mound. At length he reached the desired spot,
 and, to his surprise, all was dark and gloomy behind him, but in front of the
 mound all was a blaze of light. Crawling like a serpent on his belly,
 trembling with anxiety, the old man advanced close to the prince and princess.
 He was somewhat startled to find, as he looked out over the mound, that every
 one of the thousands of eyes in that multitude was fixed on his. He gazed a
 while, all the time screwing his courage up; then, as a boy who would catch a
 butterfly, he took off his hat and carefully raised it, so as to cover the
 prince, the princess, and their costly table, and, when about to close it upon
 them, a shrill whistle was heard, the old man's hand was fixed powerless in
 the air, and everything became dark around him.</p>
 <p>Whir! whir! whir! as if a flight of bees were passing
 him, buzzed in his ears. Every limb, from head to foot, was as if stuck full
 of pins and pinched with tweezers. He could not move, he was changed to the
 ground. By some means he had rolled down the mound, and lay on his back with
 his arms outstretched, arms and legs being secured by magic chains to the
 earth; therefore, although he suffered great agony, he could not stir, and,
 strange enough, his tongue appeared tied by cords, so that he could not call.
 He had lain, no one can tell how long, in this sad plight, when he felt as if
 a number of insects were running over him, and by the light of the moon he saw
 standing on his nose one of the spriggans, who looked exceedingly like a small
 dragon-fly. This little monster stamped and jumped with great delight; and
 having had his own fun upon the elevated piece of humanity, he laughed most
 outrageously, and shouted, "Away, away, I smell the day!" Upon this the army
 of small people, who had taken possession of the old man's body, moved quickly
 away, and left our discomfited hero alone on the Gump. Bewildered, or, as he
 said, bedevilled, he lay still to gather up his thoughts. At length the sun
 arose, and then he found that he had been tied to the ground by myriads of
 gossamer webs, which were now covered with dew, and glistened like diamonds in
 the sunshine.</p>
 <p>He shook himself, and was free. He rose wet, cold, and
 ashamed. Sulkily he made his way to his home. It was a long time before,his
 friends could learn from the old man where he had passed the night, but, by
 slow degrees, they gathered the story I have related to you.</p>
