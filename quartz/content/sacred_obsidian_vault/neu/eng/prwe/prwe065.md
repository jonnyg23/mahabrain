 <p align="CENTER">ROMANCES OF THE ROCKS.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">CROMLECH AND DRUID STONES.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">"Among the rocks and stones, methinks I see<br>
 More than the heedless impress that belongs<br>
 To lonely nature's casual work: they bear<br>
 A semblance strange of power intelligent,<br>
 And of design not wholly worn away."<br>
 - <i>The Excursion</i> - WORDSWORTH</p>
 <p align="CENTER">"Surely there is a hidden power that reigns<br>
 'Mid the lone majesty of untamed nature,<br>
 Controlling sober reason."<br>
 -- <i>Caractacus</i>.--WILLIAM MASON.</p>
 <p>IT is a common belief amongst the peasantry over every part
 of Cornwall, that no human power can remove any of those stones which have
 been rendered sacred to them by traditionary romance. Many a time have I been
 told that certain stones had been removed by day, but that they always
 returned by night to their original positions, and that the parties who had
 dared to tamper with those sacred stones were punished in some way. When the
 rash commander of a revenue cutter landed with a party of his men and
 overturned the Logan Rock, to prove the folly of the prevalent superstition,
 he did but little service in dispelling an old belief; but proved himself to
 be a fool for his pains.</p>
 <p>I could desire, for the preservation of many of our Celtic
 remains, that we could impress the educated classes with a similar reverence
 for the few relics which are left to us of an ancient and a peculiar people,
 of whose history we know so little, and from whose remains we might, by
 careful study, learn so much. Those poised stones and perforated rocks must be
 of high antiquity, for we find the Anglo-Saxons making laws to prevent the
 British people from pursuing their old pagan practices. [a]</p>
 <p>The geologist, looking upon the Logan stones and other
 curiously-formed rock masses, dismisses at once from his mind the idea of
 their having been formed by the hand of man, and hastily sets aside the
 tradition that the Druid ever employed them, or that the old Celt ever
 regarded them with reverence. There cannot be a doubt but that many huge
 masses of granite are, by atmospheric causes, now slowly passing into the
 condition required for the formation of a Logan rock. It is <i>possible</i>
 that in some cases the "weathering" may have gone on so uniformly around the
 stone, as to poise it so exactly that the thrust of a child will shake a mass
 many tons in weight.</p>
 <p>The result, however, of my own observations, made with much
 curiosity and considerable care, has been to convince me, that in by far the
 greatest number of instances the disintegration, though general around the
 line of a "bed-way" or horizontal joint, has gone on rapidly on the side
 exposed to the beat of the weather, while the opposite extremity has been but
 slightly worn; consequently, the stones have a tendency to be depressed on the
 sheltered side. With a little labour man could correct this natural defect,
 and with a little skill make a poised stone. We have incontrovertible evidence
 that certain poised stones have been regarded, through long periods of time,
 as of a sacred character. Whether these stones were used by the Druids, or
 merely that the ignorant people supposed them to have some peculiar virtue, I
 care not. The earliest inhabitants of Cornwall, probably Celts, [b] were
 possessed with some idea that these stones were connected with the mysteries
 of existence; and from father to son, for centuries, notwithstanding the
 introduction of Christianity, these stones have maintained their sacred
 character. Therefore, may we not infer that the leaders of the people availed
 themselves of this feeling; and finding many rocks of a gigantic size, upon
 which nature had begun the work, they completed them, and used the mighty
 moving masses to impress with terror--the principle by which they ruled--the
 untaught, but poetically constituted, minds of the people. Dr Borlase has been
 laughed at for finding rock-basins, the works of the Druids, in every granitic
 mass. At the same time, those who laugh have failed to examine those
 rock-masses with unprejudiced care, and hence they have erred as wildly as did
 the Cornish antiquary, but in a contrary direction. Hundreds of depressions
 are being formed by the winds and rains upon the faces of the granite rocks.
 With these no Druid ever perplexed himself or his people. But there are
 numerous hollows to be found in large flat rocks which have unmistakably been
 formed, if not entirely, partly by the hands of man. The Sacrificing Rock, or
 Cam Brea, is a remarkable example. The larger hollows on the Men-rock, in
 Constantine, several basins in the Logan Rock group, and at Cam Boscawen, may
 be referred to as other examples. With these remarks, I proceed to notice a
 few of the most remarkable rock-masses with which tradition has associated
 some tale.</p>

 common in England, and probably in Scotland also, as the Anglo-Saxon laws
 repeatedly denounce similar superstitious practices."--<i>The Archaeology and
 Prehistoric Annals of Scotland</i>, p. 97. DANIEL WILSON.</p>

 to occupy the primeval districts of Cornwall, and preserved, almost to our own
 day, a distinct dialect of the Celtic tongue."--<i>Prehistoric Annals a
