 <p align="CENTER">THE GIANTS AT PLAY.</p>
 <p><br>
 IN several parts of Cornwall there are evidences that these Titans were a
 sportive race. Huge rocks are preserved to show where they played at
 trap-ball, at hurling, and other athletic games. The giants of Trecrobben and
 St Michael's Mount often met for a game at bob-buttons. The Mount was the
 "bob," on which flat masses of granite were placed to serve as buttons, and
 Trecrobben Hill was the "mit," or the spot from which the throw was made. This
 order was sometimes reversed. On the outside of St Michael's Mount, many a
 granite slab which had been knocked off the "bob" is yet to be 'found; and
 numerous piles of rough cubical masses of the same rock, said to be the
 granite of Trecrobben Hill, [a] show how eagerly the game was played.</p>
 <p>Trecrobben Hill was well chosen by the giants as the site
 of their castle. From it they surveyed the country on every side and friend or
 enemy was seen at a considerable distance as he approached the guarded spot.
 It is as clear as tradition can make it, that Trecrobben was the centre of a
 region full of giants. On Lescudjack Hill, close to Penzance, there is "The
 Giant's Round," evidently the scene of many a sanguinary conflict, since the
 Cornish antiquarian authority Borlase informs us, that Lesgudzhek signifies
 the "Castle of the Bloody Field." On the cairn at Gulval are several
 impressions on the rocks, all referable to the giants. In Madron there is the
 celebrated "Giant's Cave;" and the well-known Lanyon cromlech is reported by
 some to be the " Giant's Coit," while others declare it to be the " Giant's
 Table." Cairn Gaiva, again, is celebrated for its giant; and, indeed, every
 hill within sight has some monument preserving the memory of those, "the
 Titans fierce."</p>
 <p>[a] Mr O. Halliwell, who carefully
 followed in the" Footsteps of the Giants," referring to this game as played by
 them, says:-- "Doubtlessly the Giant's Chair on Trink Hill was frequently used
 during the progress of the game, nor is it improbable that the Giant's Well was
 also in requisition. Here, then, were at hand opportunities for rest and
 refreshment--the circumstances of the various traditions agreeing well with,
 and, in fact, demonstrating the truth of each other."</p>
