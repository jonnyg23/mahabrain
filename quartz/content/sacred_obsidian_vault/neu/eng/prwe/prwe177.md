 <p align="CENTER">THE WITCH OF FRADDAM AND THE ENCHANTER
 OF PENGERSWICK.</p>
 <p>AGAIN and again had the Lord of Pengerswick reversed the
 spells of the Witch of Fraddam, who was reported to be the most powerful
 weird woman in the west country. She bad been thwarted so many times by this
 "white witch," that she resolved to destroy him by some magic more potent
 than anything yet heard of. It is said that she betook herself to Kynance
 Cove, and that there she raised the devil by her incantations, and that she
 pledged her soul to him in return for the aid he promised. The enchanter's
 famous mare was to be seduced to drink from a tub of poisoned water placed
 by the road-side, the effect of which was to render her in the highest
 degree restive, and cause her to fling her rider. The wounded Lord of
 Pengerswick was, in his agony, to be drenched by the old witch, with some
 hell-broth, brewed in the blackest night, under the most evil aspects of the
 stars; by this he would be in her power for ever, and she might torment him
 as she pleased. The devil felt certain of securing the soul of the witch of
 Fraddam, but he was less certain of securing that of the enchanter. They
 say, indeed, that the sorcery which Pengerswick learned in the East was so
 potent, that the devil feared him. However, as the proverb is, he held with
 the hounds and ran with the hare. The witch collected with the utmost care
 all the deadly things she could obtain, with which to brew her famous drink.
 In the darkest night, in the midst of the wildest storms, amidst the
 flashings of lightnings and the bellowings of the thunder, the witch was
 seen riding on her black ram-cat over the moors and mountains in search of
 her poisons. At</p>
 <p>length all was complete--the horse-drink was boiled, the
 hell-broth was brewed. It was in March, about the time of the equinox; the
 night was dark, and the King of Storms was abroad. The witch planted her tub
 of drink in a dark lane, through which she knew the Lord of Pengerswick must
 pass, and near to it she sat, croning over her crock of broth. The
 witch-woman had not long to wait; amidst the hurrying winds was heard the
 heavy tramp of the enchanter's mare, and soon she perceived the outline of
 man and horse defined sharply against the line of lurid light which
 stretched along the western horizon. On they came; the witch was scarcely
 able to contain herself--her joy and her fears, struggling one with the
 other, almost overpowered her. On came the horse and her rider they neared
 the tub of drink; the mare snorted loudly, and her eyes flashed fire as she
 looked at the black tub by the road-side. Pengerswick bent him over the
 horse's neck and whispered into her ear; she turns round, and flinging out
 her heels, with one kick she scattered all to the wild winds. The tub flew
 before the blow; it rushed against the crock, which it overturned, and
 striking against the legs of the old Witch of Fraddam, she fell along with
 the tub, which assumed the shape of a coffin. Her terror was extreme she who
 thought to have unhorsed the conjurer, found herself in a carriage for which
 she did not bargain. The enchanter raised his voice and gave utterance to
 some wild words in an unknown tongue, at which even his terrible mare
 trembled. A whirlwind arose, and the devil was in the midst of it. He took
 the coffin in which lay the terrified witch high into the air, and the crock
 followed them. The derisive laughter of Pengerswick, and the savage neighing
 of the horse, were heard above the roar of the winds. At length, with a
 satisfied tone, he exclaimed, "She is settled till the day of doom," gave
 the mare the spurs, and rode rapidly home.</p>
 <p>The Witch of Fraddâm still floats up and down, over the
 seas, around the coast, in her coffin, followed by the crock, which seems
 like a punt in attendance on a jolly-boat. She still works mischief,
 stirring up the sea with her ladle and broom till the waves swell into
 mountains, which heave off from their 'crests so much mist and fciam, that
 these wild wanderers of the winds can scarcely be seen through the mist. Woe
 to the mariner who sees the witch !</p>
 <p>The Lord of Pengerswick alone had power over her. He had
 but to stand on his tower, and blow three blasts on his trumpet, to summon
 her to the shore, and compel her to peace.</p>
