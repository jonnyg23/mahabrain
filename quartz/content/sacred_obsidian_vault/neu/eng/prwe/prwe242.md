 <p align="CENTER">THE DUKE OF RESTORMEL</p>
 <p>
  A VERY singular custom
 formerly prevailed at Lostwithiel, in Cornwall, on Easter Sunday. The
 freeholders of the town and manor having assembled together, either in
 person or by their deputies, one among them, each in his turn, gaily
 attired and gallantly mounted, with a sceptre in his hand, a crown on his
 head, and a sword borne before him, and respectfully attended by all the
 rest on horseback, rode through the principal street in solemn state to
 the church. At the churchyard stile, the curate, or other minister,
 approached to meet him in reverential pomp, and then conducted him to
 church to hear divine service. On leaving the church, he repaired, with
 the same pomp and retinue, to a house previously prepared for his
 reception. Here a feast, suited to the dignity he had assumed, awaited him
 and his suite; and, being, placed at the head of the table, he was served,
 kneeling, with all the rites and ceremonies that a real prince might
 expect. This ceremony ended with the dinner; the prince being voluntarily
 disrobed, and descending from his momentary exaltation, to mix with common
 mortals. On the origin of this custom but one opinion can be reasonably
 entertained, though it may be difficult to trace the precise period of its
 commencement. It seems to have originated in the actual appearance of the
 prince, who resided at Restormel Castle in former ages; but, on the
 removal of royalty, this mimic grandeur stepped forth as its' shadowy
 representative, and continued for many generations as a memorial to
 posterity of the princely magnificence with which Lostwithiel had formerly
 been honoured. [a]</p>
 <p>This custom is now almost forgotten, and Lostwithiel
 has little to disturb its quiet.</p>
