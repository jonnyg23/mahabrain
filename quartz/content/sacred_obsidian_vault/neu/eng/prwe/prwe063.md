 <p align="CENTER">THE OLD MAN OF CURY</p>
 <p>MORE than a hundred years since, on a fine summer day, when
 the sun shone brilliantly from a cloudless sky, an old man from the parish of
 Cury, or, as it was called in olden time, Corantyn, was walking on the sands
 in one of the coves near the Lizard Point. The old man was meditating, or at
 least he was walking onward, either thinking deeply, or not thinking at all
 --.that is, he was "lost in thought "--when suddenly he came upon a rock on
 which was sitting a beautiful girl with fair hair, so long that it covered her
 entire person. On the in-shore side of the rock was a pool of the most
 transparent water, which had been left by the receding tide in the sandy
 hollow the waters had scooped out. This young creature was so absorbed in her
 occupation,--arranging her hair in the watery mirror, or in admiration of her
 own lovely face, that she was unconscious of an intruder.</p>
 <p>The old man stood looking at her for some time ere he made up
 his mind how to act. At length he resolved to speak to the maiden. "What
 cheer, young one?" he said; "what art thee doing there by thyself then, this
 time o' day?" As soon as she heard the voice, she slid off the rock entirely
 under the water.</p>
 <p>The old man could not tell what to make of it. He thought the
 girl would drown herself, so he ran on to the rock to render her assistance,
 conceiving that in her fright at being found naked by a man she had fallen
 into the pool, and possibly it was deep enough to drown her. He looked into
 the water, and, sure enough, he could make out the head and shoulders of a
 woman, and long hair floating like fine sea-weeds all over the pond, hiding
 what appeared to him to be a fish's tail. He could not, however, see anything
 distinctly, owing to the abundance of hair floating around the figure. The old
 man had heard of mermaids from the fishermen of Gunwalloe; so he conceived
 this lady must be one, and he was at first very much frightened. He saw that
 the young lady was quite as much terrified as he was, and that, from shame or
 fear, she endeavoured to hide herself in the crevices of the rock, and bury
 herself under the sea-weeds.</p>
 <p>Summoning courage, at last the old man addressed her, "Don't
 'e be afraid, my dear. You needn't mind me. I wouldn't do ye any harm. I 'm an
 old man, and wouldn't hurt ye any more than your grandfather."</p>
 <p>After he had talked in this soothing strain for some time, the
 young lady took courage, and raised her head above the water. She was crying
 bitterly, and, as soon as she could speak, she begged the old man to go away.</p>
 <p>"I must know, my dearie, something about ye, now I have caught
 ye. It is not every day that an old man catches a merry-maid, and I have heard
 some strange tales of you water-ladies. Now, my dear, don't 'e be afraid, I
 would not hurt a single hair of that beautiful head. How came ye here?" After
 some further coaxing she told the old man the following story:-- She and her
 husband and little ones had been busy at sea all the morning, and they were
 very tired with swimming in the hot sun; so the merman proposed that they
 should retire to a cavern, which they were in the habit of visiting in Kynance
 Cove. Away they all swam, and entered the cavern at mid-tide. As there was
 some nice soft weed, and the cave was deliciously cool, the merman was
 disposed to sleep, and told them not to wake him until the rise of the tide.
 He was soon fast asleep, snoring most lustily. The children crept out and were
 playing on the lovely sands; so the mermaid thought she should like to look at
 the world a little. She looked with delight on the children rolling to and fro
 in the shallow waves, and she laughed heartily at the crabs fighting in their
 own funny way. "The scent from the flowers came down over the cliffs so
 sweetly," said she, "that I longed to get nearer the lovely things which
 yielded those rich odours, and I floated on from rock to rock until I came to
 this one; and finding that I could not proceed any further, I thought I would
 seize the opportunity of dressing my hair." She passed her fingers through
 those beautiful locks, and shook out a number of small crabs, and much broken
 sea-weed. She went on to say that she had sat on the rock amusing herself
 until the voice of a mortal terrified her, and until then she had no idea that
 the sea was so far out, and a long dry bar of sand between her and it. "What
 shall I do? what shall I do? Oh! I'd give the world to get out to sea! Oh
 ! oh! what shall I do?"</p>
 <p>The old man endeavoured to console her; but his attempts were
 in vain. She told him her husband would "carry on" most dreadfully if he awoke
 and found her absent, and he would be certain of awaking at the turn of the
 tide, as that was his dinnertime. He was very savage when he was hungry, and
 would as soon eat the children as not, if there was no other food at hand. He
 was also dreadfully jealous, and if she was not at his side 's'hen he awoke,
 he would at once suspect her of having run off with some other merman. She
 begged the old man to bear her out to sea. If he would but do so, she would
 procure him any three things he would wish for. Her entreaties at length
 prevailed; and, according to her desire, the old man knelt down on the rock
 with his back towards her. She clasped her fair arms around his neck, and
 locked her long finny fingers together on his throat. He got up from the rock
 with his burthen, and carried the mermaid thus across the sands. As she rode
 in this way, she asked the old man to tell her what he desired.</p>
 <p>"I will not wish," said he, "for silver and gold, but give me
 the power to do good to my neighbours: first, to break the spells of
 witchcraft; next, to charm away diseases; and thirdly, to discover thieves,
 and restore stolen goods."</p>
 <p>All this she promised he should possess; but he must come to a
 half-tide rock on another day, and she would instruct him how to accomplish
 the three things he desired. They had reached the water, and taking her comb
 from her hair, she gave it to the old man, telling him he had but to comb the
 water and call her at any time, and she would come to him. The mermaid
 loosened her grasp, and sliding off the old man's back into the sea, she waved
 him a kiss and disappeared. At the appointed time the old man was at the
 half-tide rock,--known to the present time as the Mermaid's Rock,--and duly
 was he instructed in many mysteries. Amongst others, he learned to break the
 spells of witches from man or beast; to prepare a vessel of water, in which to
 show to any one who had property stolen the face of the thief; to charm
 shingles, tetters, St Antony's fire, and St Vitus's dance; and he learnt also
 all the mysteries of bramble leaves, and the like.</p>
 <p>The mermaid had a woman's curiosity, and she persuaded her old
 friend to take her to some secret place, from which she could see more of the
 dry land, and of the funny people who lived on it, "and had their tails split,
 so that they could walk." On taking the mermaid back to the sea, she wished
 her friend to visit her abode, and promised even to make him young if he would
 do so, which favour the old gentleman respectfully declined. A family, well
 known in Cornwall, have for some generations exercised the power of charming,
 &amp;c. They account for the possession of this power in the manner related. Some
 remote great-grandfather was the individual who received the mermaid's 'comb,
 which they retain to the present day, and show us evidence- of the truth of
 their being supernaturally endowed. Some people are unbelieving enough to say
 the comb is only a part of a shark's jaw. Sceptical people are never lovable
 people.</p>
