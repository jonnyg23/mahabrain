 <p align="CENTER">MERRYMAIDS AND MERRYMEN.</p>
 <p>THE "merry-maids" of the Cornish fishermen and sailors
 possess the well-recognised features of the mermaid. The Breton ballad, quoted
 by Mr Keightley, relating to the Morgan (<i>sea-women</i>) and the Morverch
 (sea-daughters), peculiarly adapts itself to the Cornish merry.maid.</p>
 <p>"Fisher, hast thou seen the mermaid combing her hair, 
 yellow as gold, by the noontide sun, at the edge of the water?"</p>
 <p>"I have seen the fair mermaid; I have also heard her
 singing her songs plaintive as the waves."</p>
 <p>The Irish legends make us acquainted with the amours of men
 with those sea-sirens. We learn that the Merrows, or Moruachs, came
 occasionally from the sea, and interested themselves in the affairs of man.
 Amongst the fragments which have been gathered, here a pebble and there a
 pebble, along the Western coast, will be found similar narratives.</p>
 <p>The sirens of the Aegean Sea--probably the parents of the
 medieval mermaid--possess in a pre-eminent degree the beauty and the
 falsehood of all the race. Like all other things, even those mythical
 creations take colour from that they work in, like the dyer's hand. The
 Italian mermaid is the true creature of the romance of the sunny South; while
 the lady of our own southern seas, although she possesses much in common with
 her Mediterranean sister, has less poetry, but more human sympathy. - The
 following stories, read in connection with those given by Mr Keightley and by
 Mr Croker, will show this. [a]</p>
 <p>'When, five-and-thirty years since, I spent several nights
 in a fisherman's cottage on a south-western coast, I was treated to many a
 "long yarn" respecting mermaids seen by the father and his sons in the
 southern ocean. The appearance of those creatures on our own shores, they
 said, was rare; but still they knew they had been seen. From them I learned of
 more than one family who have received mysterious powers from the sea-nymphs;
 and I have since heard that members of those families still live, and that 
 they intimate to their credulous friends their firm belief that this power,
 which they say has been transmitted to them, was derived, by some one of their
 ancestors, from merman or mer-maiden.</p>
 <p>Usually those creatures are associated with some
 catastrophe; but they are now and then spoken of as the benefactors of man.</p>
 <p>One word more. The story of "<i>The Mermaid's Vengeance</i>"
 has been produced from three versions of evidently the same legend, which
 differed in many respects one from the other, yet agreeing in the main with
 each other. The first I heard at the Lizard, or rather at Coverach; the second
 in Sennen Cove, near the Land's End; the third at Perranzabaloe. I have
 preferred the last locality, as being peculiarly fitted for the home of a
 mermaid story, and because the old man who told the tale there was far more
 graphic in his incidents; and these were strung more closely together than
 either of the other stories. [b]</p>

 Legends," by Crofton Croker.</p>
 <p>[b] The following extract from a
 letter from an esteemed correspondent shows the existence of a belief in
 those fabled creations of the ocean amongst an extensive class of the
 labouring population of Cornwall. There is so much that is characteristic in
 my correspondent's letter that it is worth preserving as supporting the
 evidence of the existing belief:" </p>
 <p>I had the chance of seeing what
 many of our natives firmly beleved to be that family. Some fourteen years
 ago I found myself, with about fifty emigrants in the Gulf of St Lawrence,
 on beard the old tub Resolution, Captain Davies, commander. We were
 surounded in a fog so thick that you might cut it like a cheese, almost all
 the way from the Banks to Anticosti. One morning, soon after sunrise, when
 near that island, the fog as thick as night overhead, at times would rise
 and fall on the shore like the tantalising stage curtain. All at once there
 was a clear opening right through the dense clouds which rested on the
 water, that gave us a glimpse of the shore, with the rocks covered with what
 to us appeared very strange creatures. In a minute, the hue and cry from
 stem to stern, among all the cousin Johnnys, was 'What are they, you? What
 are they, you!' Somebody gave the word mermaids. Old men, women, and
 children, that hadn't been out of their bunks for weeks, tore on deck to see
 the mermaids, when, alas! the curtain dropped, or rather closed, and the
 fair were lost to sight, but to memory dear: for, all the way to Quebec,
 those not lucky enough to see the sight bothered the others out of their
 lives to know how they looked, and if we saw the comb and glass in their
 hands. The captain might as well save his breath as tell them that the
 creatures they saw on the rocks were seals, walruses, and sea-calves. 'Not
 <i>yet, Captain</i> dear, you won't come that over me at all; no, not by a
 long chalk! no, not at all, I can tell'e! I know there are mermaids in the
 sea; have heard many say so who have sees them too! but as for sea-calves,
 I ain't such a calf nor donkey neither as to believe ut. There may be a few
 of what we call soils (seals) for all I know; perhaps so, but the rest were
 flier-maidens.' No doubt, centuries hence, this story of the mermaidens will
 be handed down with many additions, in the log-huts of the Western States."</p>
