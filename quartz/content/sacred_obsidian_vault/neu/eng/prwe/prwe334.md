 <p align="CENTER">THE GIANT OF NANCLEDRY; AND
 TREBIGGAN THE GIANT</p>
 <p>FROM time to time, in. Cornwall and other places, bones
 of a large size have been found, and very exaggerated accounts of these
 finds have beets published. Some years since it was currently reported that
 the bones of a giant had been discovered in Wendron, and they were said to
 be "prodigious.</p>
 <p>I have endeavoured to trace this matter. And now I have
 evidence to show that the whole affair was greatly exaggerated. The
 following extracts from letters will place the whole matter in its true
 light :-- </p>
 <p>"The discovery under the chancel window at Wendron, in the
 beginning of the year 1855, consisted simply of a <i>large collection of
 bones</i>, plainly human, at the depth of less <i>than two feet</i> beneath
 the floor! This accounted in a great measure for the extraordinary dampness
 of this part of the church, and which it was in part my object to get rid
 of.</p>
 <p>"Many of these bones, especially the femoral and crural,
 were certainly of an unusual magnitude, as compared with others which from
 time to time had been disinterred in the churchyard when a grave had been
 dug. I cannot state with any degree of certainty whether the dimensions of
 the largest bones were accurately measured.</p>
 <p>"Being desirous to re-inter the bones found in the
 chancel of Wendron as nearly as possible in the same place, though at a
 considerable depth, we came at length (after the removal of much damp soil)
 to a perfect stone sarcophagus, as far as I recollect about six feet in
 length. The upper lid of this was not to be found. In the said sarcophagus,
 containing little more than dust, we laid all the gigantic bones which had
 been discovered."</p>
 <p>Another correspondent informs me, that closer inquiry has
 probably connected these bones with a well known man.</p>
 <p>The curate of the parish informs me "that there is a
 brass in the church to the memory of 'Metheruny,' attached to the collegiate
 establishment of Glaseney in the time of Henry VIII., which he supposed to
 refer to a grave situated in the spot where the relics referred to by Mr.
 Boraston were found. Mr. Mime also told me, that among the published
 engravings of Holbein's portraits was a fine one of this 'Metheruny,'
 respecting whom are some interesting particulars in King's 'Monumenta
 Antiqua,' Dugdale's 'Monasticon,' and Bulase's 'Cornwall.'"</p>
