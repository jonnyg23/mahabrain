 <p align="CENTER">JAHN TERGAGLE THE STEWARD.</p>
 <p><br>
 THERE are numerous versions of this legend, and sundry statements I made as to
 the man who is supposed to have achieved the no very envious immortality which
 he enjoys.</p>
 <p>One or two of these may interest the reader.</p>
 <p>The following very characteristic narrative, from a
 much-esteemed correspondent, gives several incidents which have not a place in
 the legend as I have related it, which comprehends the explanation given for
 the appearance of Tregeagle at so many different parts of the county.</p>
 <p>The Tregeagle, of whom mention occurs in the writings of
 Cornish legendary authors, was a real person: a member of a respectable
 family, resident during the seventeenth century at Trevorder, in the parish of
 St Breock, and identical probably with a John Tregeagle whose tombstone may
 yet be seen in the parish church there, close to the chancel.</p>
 <p>Lingering one day amid the venerable arches of that same
 church, the narrator, a native of the parish, encountered, near a small
 transept called the Trevorder aisle, the sexton, a man then perhaps of about
 eighty years of age. The conversation turning not unnaturally on the
 "illustrious dead," the narrator was gratified in receiving from the lips of
 the old man the following characteristic specimen of folk-lore, the greater
 part of which has remained clearly imprinted in his memory after a Iapse of
 many years; though [he thinks he has had to supply the very last sentence of
 all from the general popular tradition] here and there he may have had to
 supply a few expressions:</p>
 <p>"Theess Jahn Tergagle, I 'ye a heerd mun tell, sir, he was
 a steward to a lord. [a]</p>
 <p>"And a man came fore to the court and paid ax rent: and
 Jahn Tergagle didn't put no cross to az name in the books.</p>
 <p>"And after that Tergagle daied: and the lord came down to
 look after az rents: and when he zeed the books, he zeed this man's name that
 there wasn't no cross to ut.</p>
 <p>"And he rent for the man, and axed 'n for az rent: and the
 man said he'd apaid az rent: and the lord said he hadn't, there warn't no
 cross to az name in the books, and he tould 'n that he 'd have the law for 'ii
 if he didn't pay.</p>
 <p>"And the man, he didn't know what to do: and he went yore
 to the minister of Simonward; [b] and the minister axed 'n if he'd a got
 faith: and the man, he hadn't got faith, and he was obliged for to come
 homewards again.</p>
 <p>"And after that the 'Zaizes was coming naigh, and he was
 becoming afeerd, sure enough: and he went yore to the minister again, and
 tould'n he'd a got faith; the minister might do whatever a laiked.</p>
 <p>"And the minister draed a ring out on the floor: and he
 caaled out dree times, Jahn Tergagle, Jahn Tergagle, Jahn Tergagle I and (I
 've a heerd the ould men tell ut, sir) theess Jahn Tergagle stood before mun
 in the middle of the ring.</p>
 <p>"And he went yore wi' mun to the Ezaizes, and gave ax
 evidence and tould how this man had a paid az rent; and the lord he was cast.</p>
 <p>"And after that they was come back to their own house,
 theess Jahn</p>
 <p>Tergagle he gave mun a brave deal of trouble; he was knackin'
 about the place, and wouldn't laive mun alone at all.</p>
 <p>"And they went yore to the minister, and axed he for to lay
 un. "And the minister zaid, thicky [c] was their look-out; they'd a brought'n
 up, and they was to gett 'n down again the best way they could. And I 've a
 heerd the ould men tell ut, sir. The minister he got dree hunderd pound for a
 layin' of un again.</p>
 <p>"And first, a was bound to the old epping-stock [d] up to
 Churchtown; [e] and after that a was bound to the ould oven in T'evurder;
 James Wyatt down to Wadebridge, he was there when they did open ut.</p>
 <p>"And after that a was bound to Dozmary Pool; and they do say
 that there he ez now emptying of it out with a lampet.shell, with a hole in
 the bottom of ut."</p>
 <p>This is a very ancient idea, and was one of the torments of
 the classical Tartarus.The treacherous daughters of Danaus being condemned
 therein to empty Leth with a bottomless vessel:-- </p>
 <p>"Et Danai proles Veneris quae numma laesit,<br>
 In cava Lethaeas solia portat aquas."</p>
 <p>Dosmare Pool is a small lake or tarn on the Bodmin Moors, a
 fit representative of Lethe, with its black water and desolate environs.--J.
 C. H.</p>
 <p>Another correspondent to whom I am much indebted for valuable
 notes on the folk-lore of the Land's End district, sends me the following
 version:</p>
 <p>You may know the story better than I do; however, I 'll
 give you the west-country version. A man in the neighbourhood of Redruth, I
 think (I have almost forgotten the story), lent a sum of money to another
 without receiving bond or note, and the transaction was witnessed by Tregagle,
 who died before the money was paid back. When the lender demanded the money,
 the borrower denied having received it. He was brought into a court of
 justice, when the man denied on oath that he ever borrowed the money, and
 declared that if Tregagle saw any such thing take place, he wished that
 Tregagle would come and declare it. The words were no sooner out of his mouth
 than Tregagle stood before him, and told him that it was easy to bring him,
 but that he should not find it so easy to put him away. Tregagle followed the
 man day and night, wouldn't let him have a moment's rest, until he got all the
 parsons, conjurors, and other wise men together, to lay him. The wise ones
 accomplished this for a short time by binding the spirit to empty Dosmery (or
 Dorsmery) Pool with a crogan (limpet-shell). He soon finished the job and came
 to the man again, who sent for Parson Corker, of Burrian, who was a noted hand
 for laying spirits, driving the devil from the bedside of old villains, and
 other kinds of jobs of the same kind. When the parson came into the room with
 the spirit and the man, the first thing the parson did was to draw a circle
 and place the man to stand within it; the spirit took the form of a black
 bull, and (roared as you may still hear Tregagle roar in Genvor Cove before a
 northerly storm) did all he could to get at the man with his horns and hoofs.
 The parson continued reading all the time. At first the reading seemed to make
 him more furious, but little by little he became as gentle as a lamb, and
 allowed the parson to do what he would with him, and consented at last to go
 to Genvor Cove (in Escols Cliff), and make a truss of sand, which he was to
 carry above a certain rock in Escols Cliff. He was many years trying, without
 being able to accomplish this piece of work, until it came to a very cold
 winter, when Tregagle, by taking water from the stream near by, and pouring
 oyer the sand, caused it to freeze together, so that he finished the task,
 came back 'to the man, and would have torn him in pieces, but the man happened 
 to have a child in his arms, so the spirit couldn't harm him. The man sent for
 the parson without delay; Parson Corker couldn't manage him alone, this time;
 had to get some more parsons to help,--very difficult job;--bound Tregagle
 at last to the same task, and not to go near the fresh water. He is still
 there, making his truss of sand and spinning sand ropes to bind it. What some
 people take to be the "<i>calling of the northern cleves</i>" (cliffs) is the
 roaring of Tregagle because there is a storm coming from the north to scatter
 his sand. [f] W. B.</p>

 <p>[f] In connection with the incident
 given of Tregeagle and the child, the following is interesting--</p>
 <p>I find in the <i>Temple Bar</i>
 Magazine for January 1862, "The Autobiography of an Evil Spirit," professing
 to be an examination of a strange story related by Dr Justinus Kerner. In
 this a woman is possessed by a devil or sometimes by devils. "Sometimes a
 legion of fiends appeared to take possession of her, and the clamour on such
 occasions is compared to that of a pack of hounds. Amid all these horrors
 her confinement occurred, which was the means of procuring her some respite,
 as the demon appeared to have no power over her while her innocent babe was
 in her arms." T,, this the author adds the following note:-- </p>
 <p>This ancient general and beautiful
 superstition is graphically illustrated in the legend of Swardowski, the
 Polish Faust. Satan, weary of the services the magician is continually
 requiring at his hands, decoys him to a house in Cracow, where, for some
 unexplained reason, he expects to have him at a disadvantage. Put on his
 guard by the indiscretion of a flock of ravens and owls, who cannot suppress
 their satisfaction at seeing him enter the house, Swardowski snatches a
 new-born child from the cradle and paces the room with it in his arms. In
 rushes the devil, as terrible as horns, tail, and hoofs can make hint; but
 confronted with the infant, recoils and collapses <i>instanter</i>. This
 suggests to him the propriety of resorting to "moral suasion;" and after a
 while he thus addresses the magician,--" Thou art a gentleman and knowest
 that <i>verbum nobile debet esse stabile</i>." Swardowski feels that he
 cannot break his word of honour as a gentleman, replaces the child in the
 cradle, and flies up the chimney with his companion. In the Confusion of his
 faculties, however, the demon would seem to have mistaken the way; at all
 events, the pair fly upwards instead of downwards,--Swardowski lustily
 intoning a hymn till suddenly he finds his companion gone, and himself fixed
 at an immeasurable height in the air, and hears a voice above him saying,
 "Thus shalt thou hang until the day of judgment!" He has, however, changed
 one of his disciples into a spider, and is in the habit of letting him down
 to collect the news of earth. When, therefore, we see any floating threads
 of gossamer, we may suspect that "a chiel's amang us taking notes," though
 it is not equally probable that he will ever "prent them."</p>
