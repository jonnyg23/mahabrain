 YEARS since--the time is past now--the green outside the gate at the end of
 Trezidder Lane was a favourite place with the Small Folks on which to hold
 their fairs. One might often see the rings in the grass which they made in
 dancing, where they footed it. Mr Trezillian was returning late one night from
 Penzance; when he came near the gate, he saw a number of little creatures
 spinning round and round. The sight made him light-headed, but he could not
 resist the desire to be amongst them, so he got off his horse. In a moment
 they were all over him like a swarm of bees, and he felt as if they were
 sticking needles and pins into him. His horse ran ofl and he didn't know what
 to do, till, by good luck, he thought of what he had often heard, so he turned
 his glove inside out, threw it amongst the Small Folk, and ere the glove
 reached the ground they were all gone. Mr Trezillian had now to find his
 horse, and the Small Folk, still determining to lead him a dance, bewildered
 him. He was piskie-led, and he could not find out where be was until broad
 daylight. Then he saw he was not a hundred yards from the place at which he
 had left his horse. On looking round the spot where he had seen the Small Folk
 dancing, be found a pair of very small silver knee-buckles of a most ancient
 shape, which, no doubt, some little gentleman must have lost when he was
 punishing the farmer. Those who knew the families will well remember the
 little silver buckles, which were kept for some time at Trezidder and some
 time at Raftra.</p>
 <p>Down in Penberth Cove lived an old woman who was an especial
 favourite with these little people. She was a good old creature, and had been
 for many years bedridden. These Small Folk were her only company. Her
 relations dropped in once a day, rendered her the little aid she required, and
 left food by the bed-side. But day by day, and all the day long, the Small
 Folk vied with each other to amuse her. The men, she related, were for the
 most part dressed in green, with a red or a blue cap and a feather--"They
 look for all the world like little sodgers." As for the ladies--you should
 have heard the old woman tell of the gay ladies, with their feathers, hooped
 petticoats with furbelows, trains, and fans, and what saucy little creatures
 they were with the men! No sooner was the old woman left alone than in they
 came and began their frolics, dancing over the rafters and key-beams, swinging
 by the cobwebs like rope-dancers, catching the, mice and riding them in and
 out through the holes in the thatch. When one party got tired another party
 came, and by daylight, and even by moonlight, the old bedridden creature never
 wanted amusement.</p>
