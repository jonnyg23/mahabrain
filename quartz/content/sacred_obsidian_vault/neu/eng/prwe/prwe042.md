 <p align="CENTER">THE FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER.</p>
 <p><br>
 NOT many years since a farmer lived in Bosfrancan in St Burrien, who had a
 very fine red-and-white cow called Daisey. The cow was always fat, with her
 dewlaps and udder sweeping the grass. Daisey held her milk from calf to calf;
 had an udder like a bucket, yet she would never yield more than a gallon or so
 of milk, when one might plainly see that she had still at least two gallons
 more in her udder. All at once, when the milk was in full flow, she would give
 a gentle bleat, <i>cock up</i> her ears, and the milk would stop at once. If
 the milkmaid tried to get any more from her after that, she would up foot,
 kick the bucket, and spill all the milk, yet stand as still as a stock, and
 keep chewing her cud all the time. Everybody would have thought the cow
 bewitched, if she hadn't been always fat and held her milk all the year round;
 besides, everything prospered with the farmer, and all the other cows had more
 milk than any of the neighbours. No one could tell what the deuce could be the
 matter with Daisey; and they tried to drive her to Burrien Church-town fair,
 that they might, be rid of her, as she was always fit for the butchers. All
 the men and boys on the farm couldn't get her to Church-town. As fast as they
 drove her up Alsie Lane, she would take down Cotneywilley, through by the
 Crean, down the Bottoms, and up the Gilley, and be in the field again before
 the men and boys would be half way home.</p>
 <p>One midsummer's day in the evening, the maid was later than
 usual milking, as she had been down to Penberth to the <i>games</i>. The stars
 were beginning to blink when she finished her task. Daisey was the last cow
 milked, and the bucket was so full she could scarcely lift it to her head.
 Before rising from the milking-stool, the maid plucked up a handful of grass
 and clover to put in the head of her hat, that she might carry the bucket the
 steadier. She had no sooner placed the hat on her head, than she saw hundreds
 and thousands of Small People. swarming in all directions about the cow, and
 dipping their hands into the milk, taking it out on the clover blossoms and
 sucking them. The grass and clover, all in blossom, reached to the cow's
 belly. Hundreds of the little creatures ran up the long grass and clover
 stems, with buttercups, lady's smocks, convolvuluses, and foxglove flowers, to
 catch the milk that Daisey let flow from her four teats, like a shower, among
 them. Right under the cow's udder the maid saw one much larger than the others
 lying on his back, with his heels cocked up to the cow's belly. She knew he
 must be a Piskie, because he was laughing, with his mouth open from ear to
 ear. The little ones were running up and down his legs, filling their cups,
 and emptying them into the Piskie's mouth. Hundreds of others were on Daisey's
 back, scratching her rump, and tickling her round the horns and behind the
 ears. Others were smoothing down every hair of her shining coat into its
 place.</p>
 <p>The milkmaid wasn't much startled to see them, as she had
 so often heard of fairies, and rather wished to see them. She could have
 stayed for hours, she said, to look at them dancing about among the clover,
 which they hardly bent any more than the dew-drops.</p>
 <p>The cows were in the field called Park-an-Ventan, close
 under the house. Her mistress came out into the garden between the field and
 the house, and called to know what was~ keeping the maid so long. When the
 maid told what she had seen, her mistress said she couldn't believe her unless
 she had found a four-leaved grass. Then the maid thought of the handful of
 grass in the head of her hat. In looking it over by the candlelight, she found
 a bunch of three-leaved grass, and one stem with four leaves. They knew that
 it was nothing strange that she should see the Small People, but they didn't
 know what plan to take to get rid of them, so that they might have the whole
 of Daisey's milk, till the mistress told her mother about it. Her mother was a
 very notable old dame, who lived in Church-town. The old woman knew all about
 witches, fairies, and such things; was noted for being a sharp, careful old
 body; for when she happened to break the eye of her stocking darning-needle,
 she would take it to the blacksmith that he might put a new eye to it. The
 smith always charged her twopence. She would rather pay that than throw it
 away.</p>
 <p>Our Betty told her daughter that everybody knowed that the
 Small People couldn't abide the smell of fish, nor the savour of salt or
 grease; and advised her to rub the cow's udder with fish brine to drive the
 Small People away. Well, she did what her mammy told her to do. Better she had
 let it alone. From that time Daisey would yield all her milk, but she hadn't
 the half; nor quarter, so much as before, but took up her udder, so that one
 could hardly see it below her flanks. Every evening, as soon as the stars
 began to twinkle, the cow would go round the fields bleating and crying as if
 she had lost her calf; she became hair-pitched, and pined away to skin and
 bone before the next Burrien fair, when she was driven to Church-town and sold
 for next to nothing. I don't know what became of her afterwards; but nothing
 throve with the farmer, after his wife had driven the Small People away, as it
 did before.</p>
