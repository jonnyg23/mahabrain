 <p align="CENTER">MADGY FIGGY'S CHAIR.</p>
 <p>ALL those who have visited the fine piles of rocks in th
 vicinity of the so-called "St Levan," Land's-End, callec Tol-Pedden-Penwith,
 - and infinitely finer than anything immediately surrounding the most
 western promontory itself,--cannot have failed to notice the arrangement of
 cubical masses of granite piled one upon the other, known as the <i>Chair
 Ladder.</i></p>
 
 <p>This remarkable pile presents to the beat of the Atlantic
 waves a sheer face of cliff of very considerable height, standing up like a
 huge basaltic column, or a pillar built by the Titans, the horizontal joints
 representing so many steps in the so-called " Ladder.<sup>"</sup></p>
 
 <p>On the top is placed a stone of somewhat remarkable
 shape, which is by no great effort of the imagination converted into a
 chair. There it was that Madgy Figgy, one of the most celebrated of the St
 Levan and Burian witches, was in the habit of seating herself when she
 desired to call up to her aid the spirits of the storm. Often has she been
 seen swinging herself to and fro on this dizzy height when a storm has been
 coming home upon the shores, and richly-laden vessels have been struggling
 with the winds. From this spot she poured forth her imprecations on man and
 beast, and none whom she had offended could escape those withering spells;
 and from this " chair," which will ever bear her name, Madgy Figgy would
 always take her flight. Often, starting like some huge bird, mounted on a
 stem of ragwort, Figgy has headed a band of inferior witches, and gone off
 rejoicing in their iniquities to Wales or Spain.</p>
 <p>This old hag lived in a cottage not far from Raftra, and
 she and all her gang, which appears to have been, a pretty numerous crew,
 were notorious wreckers. On one occasion, Madgy from her seat of storms
 lured a Portuguese Indiaman into Perloe Cove, and drowned all the
 passengers. As they were washed on shore, the bodies were stripped of
 everything valuable, and buried by Figgy and her husband in the green
 hollow, which may yet he seen just above Perloe Cove, marking the graves
 with a rough stone placed at the head of the corpse. The spoils on this
 occasion must have been large, for all the women were supplied for years
 with rich dresses, and costly jewels were seen decking the red arms of the
 girls who laboured in the fields. For a long time gems and gold continued to
 be found on the sands. Howbeit, amongst the bodies thrown ashore was one of
 a lady richly dressed, with chains of gold about her. "Rich and rare were
 the gems she wore," and not only so, but valuable treasure was fastened
 around her, she evidently hoping, if saved, to secure some of her property.
 This body, like all the others, was stripped; but Figgy said there was a
 mark on it which boded them evil, and she would not allow any of the gold or
 gems to be divided, as it would be sure to bring bad luck if it were
 separated. A dreadful quarrel ensued, and bloodshed was threatened; but the
 diabolical old Figgy was more than a match for any of the men, and the power
 of her impetuous will was superior to them all.</p>
 <p>Everything of value, therefore, belonging to this lady
 was gathered into a heap, and placed in a chest in Madgy Figgy's hut. They
 buried the Portuguese lady the same evening; and after dark a light was seen
 to rise from the grave, pass along the cliffs, and seat itself in Madgy's
 chair at Tol-Pedden. Then, after some hours, it descended, passed back
 again, and, entering the cottage, rested upon the chest. This curious
 phenomenon continued for more than three months,--nightly,--much to the
 alarm of all but Figgy, who said she knew all about it, and it would be all
 right in time. One day a strange-looking and strangely-attired man arrived
 at the cottage. Figgy's man (her husband) was at home alone. To him the
 stranger addressed himself by signs,--he could not speak English, so he
 does not appear to have spoken at all,--and expressed a wish to be led to
 the graves. Away they went, but the foreigner did not appear to require a
 guide. He at once selected the grave of the lady, and sitting down upon it,
 he gave vent to his pent-up sorrows. He sent Figgy's man away, and remained
 there till night, when the light arose from the grave more brilliant than
 ever, and proceeded directly to the hut, resting as usual on the chest,
 which was now covered up with old sails, and all kinds of fishermen's
 lumber.</p>
 <p>The foreigner swept these things aside, and opened the
 chest. He selected everything belonging to the lady, refusing to take any of
 the other valuables. He rewarded the wreckers with costly gifts, and left
 them--no one knowing from whence he came nor whither he went. Madgy Figgy
 was now truly triumphant. "One witch knows another witch, dead or living,"
 she would say; "and the African would have been the death of us if we hadn't
 kept the treasure, whereas now we have good gifts, and no gainsaying 'em."
 Some do say they have seen the light in Madgy Figgy's chair since those
 times.</p>
