 <p align="CENTER">THE AGE OF THE GIANTS.</p>
 <p><br>
  </p>
 <p>"Eald ents geweorc<br>
 Idiu stodon."--<i>The Wanderer. Exeter Book.</i></p>
 
 <p>"The old works of giants<br>
 Stood desolate."--THOMAS WRIGHT.</p>
 <p>IN wandering over some of the uncultivated tracts which
 still maintain their wildness, austerely and sullenly, against the march of
 cultivation, we are certain of finding rude masses of rock which have some
 relation to the giants. The giant's hand, or the giant's chair, or, it may be,
 the giant's punch-bowl, excites your curiosity. What were the mental
 peculiarities of the people who fixed so permanently those names on fantastic
 rock-masses? What are the conditions--mental or otherwise--necessary for
 the preservation of these ideas? are questions which I have often asked
 myself when wandering amidst the Tors of Dartmoor, and when seated upon the
 granite masses which spread themselves so strangely, yet so picturesquely,
 over Cam Brea and other rocky hills' in Cornwall. When questions of this kind
 are continually recurring, the mind naturally works out some reply, which
 satisfies at least itself; and it consequently not unfrequently reposes
 contentedly on a fallacy as baseless as the giant-spectre of the mountain
 mists. This may possibly be the condition at which I have arrived, and many of
 my readers may smile at my dreams. It is not in my nature to work without some
 hypothesis; but I endeavour to hold it as loosely as possible, that it may be
 yielded up readily the moment a more promising theory is born, whoever may be
 its parent--wherever its birthplace.</p>
 <p>Giants, and every form of giant-idea, belong to the wilds
 of nature. I have never discovered the slightest indication of the existence
 of a tradition of giants, of the true legendary type, in a fertile valley or
 in a well-cultivated plain. Wherever there yet linger the faint shadows of the
 legendary giant, there the country still retains much of its native wildness,
 and the inhabitants have, to a great extent, preserved their primitive
 character In other words, they have nurtured a gloomy imagination, and
 permitted ignorance to continue its melancholy delusions. The untaught mind,
 in every age, looks upon the grander phenomena of nature with feelings of
 terror, and endeavours to explain them by the aid of those errors which have
 been perpetuated from father to son since the days when the priests of
 superstition sought to rule the minds of men by exciting their fears.</p>
 <p>I shall have to tell, by and by, the story of a so-called
 giant, who could bestride the lovely river which flows through the luxuriant
 valley of Tavistock, where, also, the inquiring traveller is shown his grave.
 The giant's grave in Penrith churchyard is familiar to me; and in or near many
 a picturesque village, shadowed by noble trees, and surrounded by
 richly-clothed fields, I can point to mounds, and to stones, which are said to
 be the resting-places of giants. These, however, will invariably be found to
 be rude monuments to ordinary men, who were possessed of more wealth,
 intelligence, courage, or strength than their fellows: men who have been the
 objects of hero-worship, but whose names have perished amidst the wrecks of
 time. It may be argued that these village giants are creations of the same
 character as those of the true legendary type, and that both result from
 analogous operations in the human mind. It may be so; but how vastly different
 must have been the constitution of those minds to which we owe the creations
 of the Titans of our mountains and the large men of our lowlands. Had I the
 learning necessary for the task of showing that our legendary giant is of
 Oriental origin, I have not the required leisure to pursue that inquiry to its
 end; and I leave it to abler men, contenting myself, and, let me hope,
 satisfying my readers, by studying the subject in its more simple aspects.</p>
 <p>I find, over a tract of country extending, from the eastern
 edge of Dartmoor to the Land's End--and even beyond it, to the Scilly Islands
 -- curious relics of the giants. This district is in many respects a peculiar
 one. The physical features of the country are broadly marked; and, even after
 the civilising influences of centuries, wild nature contests with man, and
 often maintains her supremacy. On one hand we see industry taking possession
 of the hills, and holding them firm in its ameliorating grasp; on the other,
 we find the sterile moor and the rock-spread region still resisting
 successfully the influences of man and his appliances. When I travel into
 other parts of the British Isles, and reach a district having the same general
 features, I usually discover some outstanding memory of the giants, often, it
 must be admitted, faint and ill-defined. The giant Tarquin, almost forgotten
 amidst the whir of spindles, "who had his dwelling in a well-fortified castle
 near Manchester, on the site of what is yet known by the name of Castlefield,"
 and Carados--</p>
 <p>"A mighty giant, just pull'd down,</p>
 <p>Who lived near Shrewsbury's fair town"--</p>
 <p>may be quoted as examples of the fading myths. [a]</p>
 <p>I therefore draw the conclusion that those large masses of
 humanity--of whom Saturn devouring his own children would seem to be the
 parental type--can exist only in the memories of those races who are born and
 live amidst the sublime phenomena of nature.</p>
 <p>On the rugged mountain, overspread with rocks which appear
 themselves to be the ruins of some Cyclopean hail, amidst which the tempests
 play, still harmless in their fury;--here, where the breezes of spring and
 summer whistle as with some new delight--where the autumnal winds murmur the
 wildest music, or make the saddest wail; and the winter storms, as if joyous
 in their strength, shout in voices of thunder from cairn to cairn;--here does
 the giant dwell! On the beetling cliff, where coming tern-pests delight to
 send those predicating moanings, which tell of the coming war of winds and
 waves;--on rocks which have frowned for ages on the angry sea, and in caverns
 which mock, by repeating, the sounds of air and water--be they joyous as the
 voice of birds, or wild and solemn as the howl of savages above the dead; --
 here does the giant dwell!</p>
 <p>In the valley, too, has he sometimes fixed his home; but
 the giant has usually retired from business when he leaves the hills. Even
 here we miss not the old associations. Huge boulders are spread on every side;
 rock-masses are overgrown with furze, ferns, mosses, and heaths; and torrents
 rush from the hills, bringing, as it were, their native music with them.
 Wherever, indeed, the giants have made a home, we find a place remarkable for
 the grand scale on which the works of nature are displayed.</p>
 <p>The giants of Danmonium--as that region was once named to
 which I have confined my inquiries--will be found to be a marked race. They
 appear to bear about them the characteristics of the giants of the East. They
 have the peculiarities which may be studied in those true Oriental Titans, Gog
 and Magog, who still preside so grimly and giantly at our City feasts. They
 have none of that stony, cold-hearted character which marks the giants of
 Scandinavia; and although Mr Keightley [b] would connect the mighty Thor with
 the no less mighty giants of the Arabian stories, I think, it can be shown
 that all those of the West of England resemble their Northern brethren only in
 the manner in which the sensual monsters succumb to the slightest exercise of
 thought.</p>
 <p>Mr J. O. HaIliwell appears to have been a little surprised
 at discovering, during a very short residence in the West of Cornwall, that
 the Land's End district was "anciently the chosen land of the giants;" that
 it was "beyond all other the favourite abode and the land of the English
 giants." Peculiarly fitted for the inquiry as Mr Halliwell is, by his
 life-long studies, it is to be regretted that he spent so brief a period
 amidst "what still remains of these memorials of a Titan race." [c]</p>
 <p>Who were the giants? Whence came they? [d] I asked myself
 these questions when, seated in the Giant's Chair, I have looked down upon a
 wide expanse of" furzy downs," over which were scattered in picturesque
 confusion vast masses of granite rocks, every one of them standing in
 monumental grandeur, inscribed by the finger of tradition with memorials of
 this mighty race. Did Cormelian and Cormoran really build St Michael's Mount?
 Did Thunderbore walk the land, inspiring terror by his extreme ugliness? Did
 Bolster persecute the blessed St Agnes, until she was compelled by stratagem
 to destroy him? Did, indeed, our British Titans play at quoits and marbles
 with huge rocks? Is it a fact that all the giants died of grief after
 Corineus overthrew Gog Magog on Plymouth Hoe? Let us, if only for amusement --
 and to give to a light work some appearance of Research--examine a few
 antiquated authorities, who may be said--n their own way.--indirectly to
 answer those questions.</p>
 <p>M. Pezron, D.D., and abbot of <i>La Chamoye</i> wrote a
 strange book, "The Antiquities of Nations," which in 1706 was "Englished by Mr
 Jones." [e]</p>
 <p>In his Epistle Dedicatory to Charles Lord Halifax, speaking
 of the "Famous Pezron," Mr Jones asks, "Was there ever any before him that
 attempted to Trace the Origin of the <i>Celtae</i>, who with Great Probability
 of Truth, were the same People, and spoke the same Language, as our Ancient <i>
 Britain's</i> did, and their Descendants continue to do to this Day, so high
 as <i>Gomer</i> and the <i>Gomarians</i>?"</p>
 <p>This authority, with a great display of learning, proves
 that Gomer, the eldest son of Japhet, was the chief of the Gomarians, and that
 these Gomarians afterwards were called Galatians, or Gauls. We further learn
 from him that a section of the Gomarians were called Sacae, and that the Sacae
 went into Phrygia, and afterwards assumed the name of TITANS. This race, "and
 especially the Princes that commanded them, exceeded all others in Bulk and
 Strength of Body; and hence it is that they have been looked upon to be
 terrible people, and, as it were, Giants. The Scripture itself, the Rule of
 Truth, even gives such an Idea as this, of those famous and potent men, who,
 according to it, ruled over all the Earth. <i>Judith</i>, speaking of them in
 her fine Song, called them <i>Giants</i> the sons of the <i>Titans</i>. [f]
 And the Prophet Isaiah informs us, also, that these Giants were anciently
 Masters of the World."</p>
 <p>This mighty race dwelt in mountains, woods, and rough and
 inaccessible places, and "they lay in the Hollows of Valleys, and the like
 Places of Shelter and retirement, because they had no Houses in those Times."
 The learned abbot proceeds, exerting all his powers to prove that the Titans
 were the true Celtae--that a people of Greece were the descendants of the
 Titans--that Gomerwas "the true stock of the Gauls "--and that Magog, his
 brother, "is also looked upon to be the Origin of the <i>Scythians</i>, or
 People of <i>Great Tartary</i>." [g]</p>
 <p>To seize on another authority, who appears to connect the
 Oriental with the British cromlech, and through those the people whose remains
 they cover, we will quote Dr E. D. Clarke, who describes [h] a Cyclopean
 structure visited by him near Kiel, consisting of three upright stones,
 supporting horizontally an enormous slab of granite. After mentioning several
 cromlechs of a similar character, and other "stupendous vestiges of Cyclopean
 architecture," he says--" There is nothing Gothic about them--nothing
 denoting the <i>Cimbri</i> or the <i>Franks</i>, or the old <i>Saxons</i> --
 but rather the ancient <i>Gaulish</i>, the ancient British, and the ancient
 irish; and if this be admitted, they were <i>Titan-Celts</i>:</p>
 <p>the GIANTS of the <i>sacred</i>, and the CYCLOPS of the <i>
 heathen</i> historians." I am informed that Mr Christy has lately examined
 several cromlechs in Algeria; beneath each he found a human skeleton.</p>
 <p>Such may be presumed to be the sources from which sprang
 the giants of Cornwall, whose Iabours--of which relics still remain--prove
 them to have been a race by the side of whom</p>
 <p>"In stature the tall Amazon</p>
 <p>Had stood a pigmy's height."</p>
 <p>Everything they have left us informs us that they were men
 who</p>
 <p>"Would have ta'en<br>
 Achilles by the hair, and bent his neck,<br>
 Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel." [i]</p>
 <p>With these evidences, who then dares say that the <i>
 Samotheans</i>, who, under the reign of <i>Bardus</i>, people this island,
 were not subdued by <i>Albion</i>, a giant son of Neptune, "who called the
 land after his own name, and reigned forty-four years." [j] Let us not forget
 the evidence also given by Milton in his "Lycidas," when he asks, in his
 poetic sorrow, if his friend</p>
 <p>"Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old,<br>
 Where the great Vision of the guarded Mount<br>
 Looks towards Namancos and Bayona's hold."</p>
 <p>Bellerian was the name formerly given to the promontory of
 the Land's End. It was the home of a mighty giant, after whom, in all
 probability, the headland was called. [k]</p>
 <p>Tradition throws a faint light back into those remote ages,
 and informs us that Cyclopean walls, vast earthworks, and strangely-piled
 masses of rock, which still remain, imperishable monuments of animal power, in
 various parts of the ancient Danmonium, were the works of the giants. With the
 true history of Jack the Giant-Killer--of him of the Bean-Stalk--and some
 others, we are all acquainted. We listened to those histories ere yet the dark
 seed of that troublesome weed--doubt--had germinated. They were poured forth
 from loving lips into believing ears; and often in the sleep of innocency have
 we buried our heads in the maternal bosom to hide the horrid visage of some
 Cormoran Blunderbore, or Thunderbore, and escape the giant's toils. By this
 process the stories were imprinted on memory's tablets with an indelible ink,
 and for long years, the spunge and water--which is employed by the pioneers in
 the great March of Intellect--has been used almost in vain. Notwithstanding the
 influences which have been brought to bear, with no kindly spirit, upon the
 old-world tales, we have still lingering, though in ruins, the evidences by
 which they were supported. Mr Thomas Wright, in his "Memoir on the Local
 Legends of Shropshire," quotes from (and translates his quotation) an
 Anglo-Saxon poem, which bears the title of "The Ruin," in the "Exeter Book .</p>
 <p>"Wondrous is this waIl.stone, <br>
 The fates have broken it, <br>
 Have burst the burgh.place; <br>
 The work of giants is perishing."</p>
 <p>From the Land's End [l] to the eastern edge of Dartmoor,
 the perishing works of the giants--wondrous wall-stones--are yet to be
 found. In many instances the only records by which we can mark the homes of
 the giants are the names which yet cling to the rocks on the hills where they
 dwelt. The Giant's Cradle, on Trecrobben Hill, reminds us of the great man's
 infancy, as does also the Giant's Spoon, which is near it. The giant of
 Trecrobben was, beyond question, a temperate one, as the Giant's Well, without
 the walls of his castle, incontestibly proves. But what shall we say of his
 neighbour, who dwelt at Beersheba, where the Giant's Bowl is still suggestive
 of imbibitions deep. The monumental mass of granite on Dartmoor, known as <i>
 Bowerman's Nose</i>, may. hand down to us the resting-place and name of a
 giant whose nose was the index of his vice; though Carrington, in his poem. of
 " Dartmoor," supposes these rocks to be</p>
 <p>"A granite god,-- <br>
 To whom, in days long flown, the suppliant knee<br>
 In trembling homage bow'd."</p>
 <p>Let those, however, who are curious in this problem visit the
 granite idol; when, ' as Carrington assures us, he will find that. the
 inhabitants of</p>
 <p>"The hamlets near <br>
 Have legends rude connected with the spot <br>
 (Wild swept by every wind), on which he. stands, <br>
 The Giant of the Moor."</p>
 <p>Of the last resting-places of the giants there are many.
 Mardon; on Dartmoor, has a <i>Giant's Grave</i>, [m] and from that rude
 region, travelling westward, we find these graves--proving the mortality of
 even this Titan race--rising on many a moor and mountain, until, crossing the
 sea, we see numerous giants' graves in the Scilly Islands; as though they had
 been the favourite resting-places of the descendants of those who dreamed of
 yet more western lands, beneath the setting sun, which were, even to them,
 "the Islands of the Blest." [n]</p>
 <p>There is scarcely a pile of rocks around our western shore
 upon which the giants have not left their impress. At Tol-Pedden-Penwith we
 have the Giant's Chair; at Cam Boscawen we see the Giant's Pulpit. If we
 advance nearer to the towns, even the small mass of rocks behind
 Street-an-Noan, near Penzance, called Tolcarne, has the mark of the Giant's
 Foot. The priests, however, in the season of their rule, strove to obliterate
 the memories of those great pagans. They converted the footprint at Tolcarne --
 and similar indentations elsewhere--into the mark of the devil's hoof, when
 he stamped in rage at the escape of a sinner, who threw himself from the rock,
 strong in faith, into the arms of the Church. In more recent times, this
 footmark has been attributed to the devil jumping with joy, as he flew off,
 from this spot, with some unfortunate miller, who had lost his soul by mixing
 china clay with his flour. The metamorphosis of ancient giants into modern
 devils is a curious feature in our inquiry. At Lemorna we have the Giant's
 Cave. On Gulval Cairn we find also the giant's mark, which the magic of Sir H.
 Davy's science could not dispel. [o] On Carn Brea are no end of evidences of
 these Titans--the Giant's Hand rivalling in size any of the monstrous
 monuments of the Egyptian gods. Thus, in nearly every part of the country
 where granite rocks prevail, the monuments of the giants may be found~ Why do
 the giants show such a preference for granite? At Looe, indeed, the Giant's
 Hedge is a vast earthwork; but this is an exception, [p] unless the Bolster in
 St Agnes is a giant's work. In pursuing the dim lights which yet remain to
 guide us to the history of the giants, we must not forget the record of the

 <p>[k] Keightley, who of all men should
 have traced this Bellerus to his home, in his "Life of Milton" confuses St
 Michael's Mount and the Land's End, and "conceives the giant Bellerus to have
 been an invention of Milton's." The evidence of the "History of Britain" shows
 with how much diligence the legendary lore which existed in 1678 had been
 sought out by the poet; and his grand epic proves with how much reverence
 Milton studied our own mythology. I could lead the reader to twenty places
 around the Land's End which were not discovered even by Mr J. O. Halliwell
 when rambling "in Western Cornwall by the Footsteps of the Giants," upon which
 Bellerus, although he has not left his name, has left a long-enduring record.

 <p>[n] Mr Augustus Smith, in the Reports
 of the Royal Institution of Cornwall, has described one of the graves opened
 by him during a visit paid by the Cambrian Archeological Society to the Scilly
 Isles. </p>
 <p>Hugh Miller, in his "Scenes and
 Legends of the North of Scotland," tells us a story of the giants of Cromarty,
 which shows us that they were intimately related to the giants of Cornwall.
 Moreover, from him we learn something of the parentage of our giants, for we
 presume the Scottish myth may be applied with equal truth to the Titans of the
 south "Diocletian, king of Syria, say the historians, had thirty-three
 daughters, who, like the daughters of Danaus, killed their husbands on their
 wedding-night. The king, their father, in abhorrence of their crime, crowded
 them all into a ship, which he abandoned to the mercy of the waves, and which
 was drifted by tides and winds, until it arrived on the coast of Britain, then
 an uninhabited island. There they lived solitary, subsisting on roots and
 berries, the natural produce of the soil, until an order of demons, becoming
 enamoured of them, took them for their wives, and a tribe of giants, who must
 be regarded as the true aborigines of the country, if indeed the demons have
 not a prior claim, were the fruits of those marriages. Less fortunate,
 however, than even their prototypes, the Cyclops, the whole tribe was
 extirpated a few years after by Brutus, the parricide, who, with a valour to
 which mere bulk could render no effectual resistance, overthrew Gog, Magog,
 and Termagol, and a whole host of others with names equally terrible." The
 Cromarty legends give accounts of a ponderous stone flung from the point of a
 spindle across Dornoch Firth; and of another yet larger, still to be seen, a
 few miles from Dingwall, which was thrown equally far, and which bears the
 impress of the giant's finger and thumb. Also, they tell us of the
 cailiiach-nore, or great woman, who "front a pannier filled with earth and
 stones, which she carried on her back, formed almost all the hills of
 Ross-shire" The Sutars, as the promontories Cromarty are named, served as the
 work-stools of two giants, who were shoemakers, or soutars, and hence, says
 Hugh Miller, "in process of time the name soutar was transferred by a common
 metonytny from the craftsmen to their stools, the two promontories, and by
 this name they have ever since been distinguished."</p>
