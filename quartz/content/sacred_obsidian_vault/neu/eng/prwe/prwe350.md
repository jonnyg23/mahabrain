 <p align="CENTER">ST NEOT</p>
 <p>THE following account of this celebrated saint, as given
 by Mr Davies Gilbert, will not be without interest :-- "Multitudes
 flocked to him from all parts. He founded a monastery, and repaired to
 Rome for a confirmation, and for blessing at the hands, of the Pope;
 these were readily obtained. He returned to his monastery, where
 frequent visits were made to him by King Alfred, on which occasions he
 admonished and instructed the great founder of English liberty, and
 finally quitted this mortal life on the 31st of July about the year 883,
 in the odour of sanctity so unequivocal that travellers all over
 Cornwall were solaced by its fragrance. Nor did the exertions of our
 saint terminate with his existence on earth; he frequently appeared to
 King Alfred, and sometimes led his armies in the field. But if the tales
 of these times are deserving of any confidence, the nation is really and
 truly indebted to St Neot for one of the greatest blessings ever
 bestowed on it. To his advice, and even to his personal assistance as a
 teacher, we owe the foundation by Alfred of the University at Oxford.</p>
 <p>"The relics of St Neot remained at his monastery
 in Cornwall till about the year 974, when Earl Alric, and his wife
 Ethelfleda, having founded .a religious house at Eynesbury, in
 Huntingdonshire, and being at a loss for some patron saint, adopted
 the expedient of stealing the body of St Neot; which was accordingly
 done and the town retains his name, thus feloniously obtained, up to
 this time. The monastery in Cornwall continued feebly to exist after
 this disaster through the Saxon times; but having lost its
 palladium, it felt the ruiner's hand; and almost immediately after
 the Norman Conquest it was finally suppressed. Yet the memory of the
 local saint is still cherished by the inhabitants of the parish and
 of the neighbourhood--endeared, perhaps,<sub> </sub>by the
 tradition of his diminutive stature, reduced in their imagination to
 fifteen inches of height; and to these feelings we, in all
 probability, owe the preservation of the painted glass, the great
 decoration of this church, and one of the principal works of Art to
 be seen in Cornwall"--<i>Gilbert's Hist, Corn</i>., vol. iii. p.
 262.</p>
