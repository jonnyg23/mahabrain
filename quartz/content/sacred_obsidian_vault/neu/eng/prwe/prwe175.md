 <p align="CENTER">HOW PENGERSWICK BECAME A SORCERER.</p>
 <p>THE first Pengerswick, by whom the castle, which still
 bears his name, was built, was a proud man, and desired to ally himself with
 some of the best families of Cornwall. He wished his son to wed a lady who
 was very much older than himself; who is said to have been connected with
 the Godolphin family. This elderly maiden had a violent desire either for
 the young man or the castle--it is not very clear which. The young
 Pengerswick gave her no return for the manifestations of love which she
 lavished upon him. Eventually, finding that all her attempts to win the
 young man's love were abortive, and that all the love-potions brewed for her
 by the Witch of Fraddam were of no avail, she married the old lord--mainly,
 it is said, to be revenged on the son.</p>
 <p>The witch had a niece who, though poor, possessed
 considerable beauty; she was called Bitha. This young girl was frequently
 employed by her aunt and the lady of Godolphin to aid them in their spells
 on the young Pengerswick, and, as a natural consequence, she fell
 desperately in love with him herself. Bitha ingratiated herself with the
 lady of Pengerswick, now the stepmother of the young man, and was selected
 as her maid. This gave her many opportunities of seeing and speaking to
 young Pengerswick, and her passion increased. The old step dame was still
 passionately fond of the young man, and never let a chance escape her which
 she thought likely to lead to the excitement of passion in his heart towards
 her. In all her attempts she failed. Her love was turned to hate; and having
 seen her stepson in company with Bitha, this hate was quickened by the more
 violent jealousy. Every means which her wicked mind could devise were
 employed to destroy the young man. Bitha had learned from her aunt, the
 Witch of Fraddam, much of her art, and she devoted herself to counteract the
 spells of her mistress.</p>
 <p>The stepmother failing to accomplish her ends, resolved
 to ruin young Pengerswick with his father. She persuaded the old man that
 his son really entertained a violent passion for her, and that she was
 compelled to confine herself to her tower in fear. The aged woman prevailed
 on Lord Pengerswick to hire a gang of outlandish sailors to carry his son
 away and sell him for a slave, giving him to believe that she should herself
 in a short time present him with an heir.</p>
 <p>The young Pengerswick escaped all their plots, and at his
 own good time he disappeared , from the castle, and for a long period was
 never heard of.</p>
 <p>The mistress and maid plotted and counter-plotted to
 secure the old Pengerswick's wealth; and when he was on his death-bed, Bitha
 informed him of the vile practices of his wife, and consoled him with the
 information that he was dying from the effects of poison given him by her.</p>
 <p>The young lord, after long years, returned from some
 Eastern lands with a princess for his wife, learned in all the magic
 sciences of those enchanted lands. He found his stepmother shut up in her
 chamber, with her skin covered with scales like a serpent, [a] from the
 effects of the poisons which she had so often been distilling for the old
 lord and his son. She refused to be seen, and eventually cast herself into
 the sea, to the relief of all parties.</p>
 <p>Bitha fared not much better. She lived on the Downs in St
 Hilary; and from the poisonous fumes she had inhaled, and from her dealings
 with the devil, her skin became of the colour of that of a <i>toad.</i></p>
