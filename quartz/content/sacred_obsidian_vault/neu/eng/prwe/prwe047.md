 <p align="CENTER">THE SMALL PEOPLE'S GARDENS.</p>
 <p><br>
 IF the adventurous traveller who visits the Land's End district will go down
 as far as he can on the south-west side of the Logan Rock Cairn, and look
 over, he will see, in little sheltered places between the cairns, close down
 to the water's edge, beautifully green spots, with here and there some ferns
 and cliff-pinks. These are the gardens of the Small People, or, as they are
 called by the natives, Small Folk. They are beautiful little creatures, who
 appear to pass a life of constant enjoyment amongst their own favourite
 flowers. They are harmless and if man does not meddle with them when they are
 holding their fairs--which are indeed high festivals--the Small Folk never
 interfere with man or anything belonging to him. They are known to do much
 good, especially when they discover a case of oppressed poverty; but they do
 it in their own way. They love to do good for its own sake, and the
 publication of it in any way draws down their censure, and sometimes severe
 anger, on the object whom it was their purpose to serve. To prove that those
 lovely little creatures are no dream, I may quote the words of a native of St
 Levan:</p>
 <p>"As I was saying, when I have been to sea close under the
 cliffs, of a fine summer's night, I have heard the sweetest of music, and seen
 hundreds of little lights moving about amongst what looked like flowers. Ay!
 and they are flowers too, for you may smell the sweet scent far out at sea.
 Indeed, I have heard many of the old men say, that they have smelt the sweet
 perfume, and heard the music from the fairy gardens of the Castle, when more
 than a mile from the shore." Strangely enough, you can find no flowers but the
 sea-pinks in these lovely green places by day, yet they have been described by
 those who have seen them in the midsummer moonlight as being covered with
 flowers of every colour, all of them far more brilliant than any blossoms seen
 in any mortal garden.</p>
