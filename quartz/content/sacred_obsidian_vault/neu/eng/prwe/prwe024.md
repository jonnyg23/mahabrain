 <p align="CENTER">NURSING A FAIRY.</p>
 <p><br>
 A THRIFTY housewife lived on one of the hills between Zennor Church-town and
 St Ives. One night a gentleman came to her cottage, and told her he had marked
 her cleanliness and her care that he had a child whom he desired to have
 brought up with much tenderness, and he had fixed on her. She should be very
 handsomely rewarded for her trouble, and he showed her a considerable quantity
 of golden coin. Well, she agreed, and away she went with the gentleman to
 fetch this child. When they came to the side of Zennor hill, the gentleman
 told the woman he must bindfold her, and she, good, easy soul, having heard of
 such things, fancied this was some rich man's child, and that the residence of
 its mother was not to be known, so she gave herself great credit for cunning
 in quietly submitting. They walked on some considerable distance. When they
 stopped the handkerchief was taken from her eyes, and she found herself in a
 magnificent room, with a table spread with the most expensive luxuries, in the
 way of game, fruits, and wines. She was told to eat, and she did so with some
 awkwardness, and not a little trembling. She was surprised that so large a
 feast should have been spread for so small a party,--only herself and the
 master. At last, having enjoyed luxuries such as she never tasted before or
 since, a silver bell was rung, and a troop of servants came in, bearing a cot
 covered with satin, in which was sleeping the most beautiful babe that human
 eyes ever gazed on. She was told this child was to be committed to her charge;
 she should not want for anything; but she was to obey certain laws. She was
 not to teach the child the Lord's Prayer; she was not to wash it after sundown
 she was to bathe it every morning in water, which she would find in a white
 ewer placed in the child's room this was not to be touched by any one but
 herself, and she was to be careful not to wash her own face in this water. -
 In all other respects she was to treat the child as one of her own children.
 The woman was blinded again, and the child having been placed in her arms,
 away she trudged, guided by the mysterious father. When out on the road, the
 bandage was removed from her eyes, and she found she had a small baby in- her
 arms, not remarkably good.. -looking, with very sharp, piercing eyes, and but
 ordinarily dressed. However, a bargain is a bargain; so she resolved to make
 the best of it, and she presented the babe to her husband, telling him so much
 of the story as she thought it prudent to trust him with. For years the child
 was with this couple. They never wanted for anything; meat, and even wines,
 were provided,--as most people thought,--by wishing for them; clothes,
 ready-made, were on the child's bed when required; and the charmed water was
 always in the magic ewer. The little boy grew active and strong. He was
 remarkably wild, yet very tractable, and he appeared to have a real regard for
 his "big mammy," as he called the woman. Sometimes - she thought the child was
 mad. He would run, and leap, and scream, as though he were playing with scores
 of boys, when no soul was near him. The woman had never seen the father since
 the child had been with them; but ever and anon, money was conveyed to them in
 some mysterious manner. One morning, when washing the boy, this good woman,
 who had often observed how bright the water made the face of the child, was
 tempted to try if it would improve her own beauty. So directing the boy's
 attention to some birds singing on a tree outside the window, she splashed 
 some of the water up into her face. Most of it went into her eye. She closed
 it instinctively, and upon opening it, she saw a number of little people
 gathered round her and playing with the boy. She said not a word, though her
 fear was great; and she continued to see the world of small - people
 surrounding the world of ordinary men and women, being with them, but not of
 them. She now knew who the boy's playmates were, and she often wished to speak
 to the beautiful creatures of the invisible world who were his real
 companions; but she was discreet, and kept silence.</p>
 <p>Curious robberies had been from time to time committed in
 St Ives Market, and although the most careful watch had been kept, the things
 disappeared, and no thief detected. One day our good housewife was at the
 market, and to her surprise she saw the father of her nursling. Without
 ceremony she ran, up to him,--at a moment when he was putting some choice
 fruit by stealth into his pocket,--and spoke to him. "So, thou seest me, dost
 thou?" "To be sure I do, and know 'ee too," replied the woman. "Shut this
 eye," putting his finger on her left eye. "Canst see me now?" "Yes, I tell
 'ee, and know 'ee too," again said the woman.</p>
 <p>" Water for elf; not water for self;<br>
 Yon've lost your eye, your child, and yourself,"</p>
 <p>said the gentleman. From that hour she was blind in the
 right eye. When she got home the boy was gone. She grieved sadly, but she
 never saw him more, and this once happy couple became poor and wretched.</p>
