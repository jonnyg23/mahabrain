 <p align="CENTER">ST SENNEN AND ST JUST.</p>
 <p>THESE saints held rule over adjoining parishes; but, like
 neighbours, not unfrequently they quarrelled. We know not the cause which
 made their angry passions rise; but no doubt the saints were occasionally
 exposed to the influences of the evil principle, which appears to be one of
 the ruling powers of the world. It is not often that we have instances of
 excess of passion in man or woman without some evidence of the evil
 resulting from it. Every tempest in the physical world leaves its mark on
 the face of the earth. Every tempest in the moral world, in a similar
 manner, leaves some scar to tell of its ravages on the soul. A most enduring
 monument in granite tells us of the rage to which those two holy men were
 the victims. As we have said, there is no record of the origin of the duel
 which was fought between St Just and St Sennen; but, in the fury of their
 rage, they tore each a rock from the granite mass, and hurled it onwards to
 destroy his brother. They were so well aimed that both saints must have
 perished had the rocks been allowed to travel as intended. A merciful - hand
 guided them, though in opposite directions, in precisely the same path. The
 huge rocks came together; so severe was the blow of impact that they became
 one mass, and fell to the ground, to remain a monument of the impotent rage
 of two giants.</p>
