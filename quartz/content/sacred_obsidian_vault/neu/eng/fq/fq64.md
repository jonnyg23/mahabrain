 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Artegall doth Sir Burbon aide,<br>
 And blames for changing shield:<br>
 He with the great Grantorto fights,<br>
 And slaieth him in field.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 O
  Sacred hunger of ambitious mindes,<br>
 And impotent desire of men to raine,<br>
 Whom neither dread of God, that deuils bindes,<br>
 Nor lawes of men, that common weales containe,<br>
 Nor bands of nature, that wilde beastes restraine,<br>
 Can keepe from outrage, and from doing wrong,<br>
 Where they may hope a kingdome to obtaine.<br>
 No faith so firme, no trust can be so strong,<br>
 No loue so lasting then, that may enduren long.<p>
 
 Witnesse may <i>Burbon</i> be, whom all the bands,<br>
 Which may a Knight assure, had surely bound,<br>
 Vntill the loue of Lordship and of lands<br>
 Made him become most faithlesse and vnsound:<br>
 And witnesse be <i>Gerioneo</i> found,<br>
 Who for like cause faire <i>Belge</i> did oppresse,<br>
 And right and wrong most cruelly confound:<br>
 And so be now <i>Grantorto</i>, who no lesse<br>
 Then all the rest burst out to all outragiousnesse.</p><p>
 
 Gainst whom Sir <i>Artegall</i>, long hauing since<br>
 Taken in hand th'exploit, being theretoo<br>
 Appointed by that mightie Faerie Prince,<br>
 Great <i>Gloriane</i>, that Tyrant to fordoo,<br>
 Through other great aduentures hethertoo<br>
 Had it forslackt.  But now time drawing ny,<br>
 To him assynd, her high beheast to doo,<br>
 To the sea shore he gan his way apply,<br>
 To weete if shipping readie he mote there descry.</p><p>
 
 Tho when they came to the sea coast, they found<br>
 A ship all readie (as good fortune fell)<br>
 To put to sea, with whom they did compound,<br>
 To passe them ouer, where them list to tell:<br>
 The winde and weather serued them so well,<br>
 That in one day they with the coast did fall;<br>
 Whereas they readie found them to repell,<br>
 Great hostes of men in order martiall,<br>
 Which them forbad to land, and footing did forstall.</p><p>
 
 But nathemore would they from land refraine,<br>
 But when as nigh vnto the shore they drew,<br>
 That foot of man might sound the bottome plaine,<br>
 <i>Talus</i> into the sea did forth issew,<br>
 Though darts from shore and stones they at him threw;<br>
 And wading through the waues with stedfast sway,<br>
 Maugre the might of all those troupes in vew,<br>
 Did win the shore, whence he them chast away,<br>
 And made to fly, like doues, whom the Eagle doth affray.</p><p>
 
 The whyles Sir <i>Artegall</i>, with that old knight<br>
 Did forth descend, there being none them neare,<br>
 And forward marched to a towne in sight.<br>
 By this came tydings to the Tyrants eare,<br>
 By those, which earst did fly away for feare<br>
 Of their arriuall: wherewith troubled sore,<br>
 He all his forces streight to him did reare,<br>
 And forth issuing with his scouts afore,<br>
 Meant them to haue incountred, ere they left the shore.</p><p>
 
 But ere he marched farre, he with them met,<br>
 And fiercely charged them with all his force;<br>
 But <i>Talus</i> sternely did vpon them set,<br>
 And brusht, and battred them without remorse,<br>
 That on the ground he left full many a corse;<br>
 Ne any able was him to withstand,<br>
 But he them ouerthrew both man and horse,<br>
 That they lay scattred ouer all the land,<br>
 As thicke as doth the seede after the sowers hand;</p><p>
 
 Till <i>Artegall</i> him seeing so to rage,<br>
 Willd him to stay, and signe of truce did make:<br>
 To which all harkning, did a while asswage<br>
 Their forces furie, and their terror slake;<br>
 Till he an Herauld cald, and to him spake,<br>
 Willing him wend vnto the Tyrant streight,<br>
 And tell him that not for such slaughters sake<br>
 He thether came, but for to trie the right<br>
 Of fayre <i>Irenaes</i> cause with him in single fight.</p><p>
 
 And willed him for to reclayme with speed<br>
 His scattred people, ere they all were slaine,<br>
 And time and place conuenient to areed,<br>
 In which they two the combat might darraine.<br>
 Which message when <i>Grantorto</i> heard, full fayne<br>
 And glad he was the slaughter so to stay,<br>
 And pointed for the combat twixt them twayne<br>
 The morrow next, ne gaue him longer day;<br>
 So sounded the retraite, and drew his folke away.</p><p>
 
 That night Sir <i>Artegall</i> did cause his tent<br>
 There to be pitched on the open plaine;<br>
 For he had giuen streight commaundement,<br>
 That none should dare him once to entertaine:<br>
 Which none durst breake, though many would right faine<br>
 For fayre <i>Irena</i>, whom they loued deare.<br>
 But yet old <i>Sergis</i> did so well him paine,<br>
 That from close friends, that dar'd not to appeare,<br>
 He all things did puruay, which for them needfull weare.</p><p>
 
 The morrow next, that was the dismall day,<br>
 Appointed for <i>Irenas</i> death before,<br>
 So soone as it did to the world display<br>
 His chearefull face, and light to men restore,<br>
 The heauy Mayd, to whom none tydings bore<br>
 Of <i>Artegals</i> arryuall, her to free,<br>
 Lookt vp with eyes full sad and hart full sore;<br>
 Weening her lifes last howre then neare to bee,<br>
 Sith no redemption nigh she did nor heare nor see.</p><p>
 
 Then vp she rose, and on her selfe did dight<br>
 Most squalid garments, fit for such a day,<br>
 And with dull countenance, and with doleful spright,<br>
 She forth was brought in sorrowfull dismay,<br>
 For to receiue the doome of her decay.<br>
 But comming to the place, and finding there<br>
 Sir <i>Artegall</i>, in battailous array<br>
 Wayting his foe, it did her dead hart cheare,<br>
 And new life to her lent, in midst of deadly feare.</p><p>
 
 Like as a tender Rose in open plaine,<br>
 That with vntimely drought nigh withered was,<br>
 And hung the head, soone as few drops of raine<br>
 Thereon distill, and deaw her daintie face,<br>
 Gins to looke vp, and with fresh wonted grace<br>
 Dispreds the glorie of her leaues gay;<br>
 Such was <i>Irenas</i> countenance, such her case,<br>
 When <i>Artegall</i> she saw in that array,<br>
 There wayting for the Tyrant, till it was farre day.</p><p>
 
 Who came at length, with proud presumpteous gate,<br>
 Into the field, as if he fearelesse were,<br>
 All armed in a cote of yron plate,<br>
 Of great defence to ward the deadly feare,<br>
 And on his head a steele cap he did weare<br>
 Of colour rustie browne, but sure and strong;<br>
 And in his hand an huge Polaxe did beare,<br>
 Whose steale was yron studded, but not long,<br>
 With which he wont to fight, to iustifie his wrong.</p><p>
 
 Of stature huge and hideous he was,<br>
 Like to a Giant for his monstrous hight,<br>
 And did in strength most sorts of men surpas,<br>
 Ne euer any found his match in might;<br>
 Thereto he had great skill in single fight:<br>
 His face was vgly, and his countenance sterne,<br>
 That could haue frayd one with the very sight,<br>
 And gaped like a gulfe, when he did gerne,<br>
 That whether man or monster one could scarse discerne.</p><p>
 
 Soone as he did within the listes appeare,<br>
 With dreadfull looke he <i>Artegall</i> beheld,<br>
 As if he would haue daunted him with feare,<br>
 And grinning griesly, did against him weld<br>
 His deadly weapon, which in hand he held.<br>
 But th'Elfin swayne, that oft had seene like sight,<br>
 Was with his ghastly count'nance nothing queld,<br>
 But gan him streight to buckle to the fight,<br>
 And cast his shield about, to be in readie plight.</p><p>
 
 The trompets sound, and they together goe,<br>
 With dreadfull terror, and with fell intent;<br>
 And their huge strokes full daungerously bestow,<br>
 To doe most dammage, where as most they ment.<br>
 But with such force and furie violent,<br>
 The tyrant thundred his thicke blowes so fast,<br>
 That through the yron walles their way they rent,<br>
 And euen to the vitall parts they past,<br>
 Ne ought could them endure, but all they cleft or brast.</p><p>
 
 Which cruell outrage when as <i>Artegall</i><br>
 Did well auize, thenceforth with warie heed<br>
 He shund his strokes, where euer they did fall,<br>
 And way did giue vnto their gracelesse speed:<br>
 As when a skilfull Marriner doth reed<br>
 A storme approching, that doth perill threat,<br>
 He will not bide the daunger of such dread,<br>
 But strikes his sayles, and vereth his mainsheat,<br>
 And lends vnto it leaue the emptie ayre to beat.</p><p>
 
 So did the Faerie knight himselfe abeare,<br>
 And stouped oft his head from shame to shield;<br>
 No shame to stoupe, ones head more high to reare,<br>
 And much to gaine, a litle for to yield;<br>
 So stoutest knights doen oftentimes in field.<br>
 But still the tyrant sternely at him layd,<br>
 And did his yron axe so nimbly wield,<br>
 That many wounds into his flesh it made,<br>
 And with his burdenous blowes him sore did ouerlade.</p><p>
 
 Yet when as fit aduantage he did spy,<br>
 The whiles the cursed felon high did reare<br>
 His cruell hand, to smite him mortally,<br>
 Vnder his stroke he to him stepping neare,<br>
 Right in the flanke him strooke with deadly dreare,<br>
 That the gore bloud thence gushing grieuously,<br>
 Did vnderneath him like a pond appeare,<br>
 And all his armour did with purple dye;<br>
 Thereat he brayed loud, and yelled dreadfully.</p><p>
 
 Yet the huge stroke, which he before intended,<br>
 Kept on his course, as he did it direct,<br>
 And with such monstrous poise adowne descended,<br>
 That seemed nought could him from death protect:<br>
 But he it well did ward with wise respect,<br>
 And twixt him and the blow his shield did cast,<br>
 Which thereon seizing, tooke no great effect;<br>
 But byting deepe therein did sticke so fast,<br>
 That by no meanes it backe againe he forth could wrast.</p><p>
 
 Long while he tug'd and stroue, to get it out,<br>
 And all his powre applyed thereunto,<br>
 That he therewith the knight drew all about:<br>
 Nathlesse, for all that euer he could doe,<br>
 His axe he could not from his shield vndoe.<br>
 Which <i>Artegall</i> perceiuing, strooke no more,<br>
 But loosing soone his shield, did it forgoe,<br>
 And whiles he combred was therewith so sore,<br>
 He gan at him let driue more fiercely then afore.</p><p>
 
 So well he him pursew'd, that at the last,<br>
 He stroke him with <i>Chrysaor</i> on the hed,<br>
 That with the souse thereof full sore aghast,<br>
 He staggered to and fro in doubtfull sted.<br>
 Againe whiles he him saw so ill bested,<br>
 He did him smite with all his might and maine,<br>
 That falling on his mother earth he fed:<br>
 Whom when he saw prostrated on the plaine,<br>
 He lightly reft his head, to ease him of his paine.</p><p>
 
 Which when the people round about him saw,<br>
 They shouted all for ioy of his successe,<br>
 Glad to be quit from that proud Tyrants awe,<br>
 Which with strong powre did them long time oppresse;<br>
 And running all with greedie ioyfulnesse<br>
 To faire <i>Irena</i>, at her feet did fall,<br>
 And her adored with due humblenesse,<br>
 As their true Liege and Princesse naturall;<br>
 And eke her champions glorie sounded ouer all.</p><p>
 
 Who streight her leading with meete maiestie<br>
 Vnto the pallace, where their kings did rayne,<br>
 Did her therein establish peaceablie,<br>
 And to her kingdomes seat restore agayne;<br>
 And all such persons, as did late maintayne<br>
 That Tyrants part, with close or open ayde,<br>
 He sorely punished with heauie payne;<br>
 That in short space, whiles there with her he stayd,<br>
 Not one was left, that durst her once haue disobayd.</p><p>
 
 During which time, that he did there remaine,<br>
 His studie was true Iustice how to deale,<br>
 And day and night employ'd his busie paine<br>
 How to reforme that ragged common-weale:<br>
 And that same yron man which could reueale<br>
 All hidden crimes, through all that realme he sent,<br>
 To search out those, that vsd to rob and steale,<br>
 Or did rebell gainst lawfull gouernment;<br>
 On whom he did inflict most grieuous punishment.</p><p>
 
 But ere he could reforme it thoroughly,<br>
 He through occasion called was away,<br>
 To Faerie Court, that of necessity<br>
 His course of Iustice he was forst to stay,<br>
 And <i>Talus</i> to reuoke from the right way,<br>
 In which he was that Realme for to redresse.<br>
 But enuies cloud still dimmeth vertues ray.<br>
 So hauing freed <i>Irena</i> from distresse,<br>
 He tooke his leaue of her, there left in heauinesse.</p><p>
 
 Tho as he backe returned from that land,<br>
 And there arriu'd againe, whence forth he set,<br>
 He had not passed farre vpon the strand,<br>
 When as two old ill fauour'd Hags he met,<br>
 By the way side being together set,<br>
 Two griesly creatures; and, to that their faces<br>
 Most foule and filthie were, their garments yet<br>
 Being all rag'd and tatter'd, their disgraces<br>
 Did much the more augment, and made most vgly cases.</p><p>
 
 The one of them, that elder did appeare,<br>
 With her dull eyes did seeme to looke askew,<br>
 That her mis-shape much helpt; and her foule heare<br>
 Hung loose and loathsomely: Thereto her hew<br>
 Was wan and leane, that all her teeth arew,<br>
 And all her bones might through her cheekes be red;<br>
 Her lips were like raw lether, pale and blew,<br>
 And as she spake, therewith she slauered;<br>
 Yet spake she seldom, but thought more, the lesse she sed.</p><p>
 
 Her hands were foule and durtie, neuer washt<br>
 In all her life, with long nayles ouer raught,<br>
 Like puttocks clawes: with th'one of which she scracht<br>
 Her cursed head, although it itched naught;<br>
 The other held a snake with venime fraught,<br>
 On which she fed, and gnawed hungrily,<br>
 As if that long she had not eaten ought;<br>
 That round about her iawes one might descry<br>
 The bloudie gore and poyson dropping lothsomely.</p><p>
 
 Her name was <i>Enuie</i>, knowen well thereby;<br>
 Whose nature is to grieue, and grudge at all,<br>
 That euer she sees doen prays-worthily,<br>
 Whose sight to her is greatest crosse, may fall,<br>
 And vexeth so, that makes her eat her gall.<br>
 For when she wanteth other thing to eat,<br>
 She feedes on her owne maw vnnaturall,<br>
 And of her owne foule entrayles makes her meat;<br>
 Meat fit for such a monsters monsterous dyeat.</p><p>
 
 And if she hapt of any good to heare,<br>
 That had to any happily betid,<br>
 Then would she inly fret, and grieue, and teare<br>
 Her flesh for felnesse, which she inward hid:<br>
 But if she heard of ill, that any did,<br>
 Or harme, that any had, then would she make<br>
 Great cheare, like one vnto a banquet bid;<br>
 And in anothers losse great pleasure take,<br>
 As she had got thereby, and gayned a great stake.</p><p>
 
 The other nothing better was, then shee;<br>
 Agreeing in bad will and cancred kynd,<br>
 But in bad maner they did disagree:<br>
 For what so <i>Enuie</i> good or bad did fynd,<br>
 She did conceale, and murder her owne mynd;<br>
 But this, what euer euill she conceiued,<br>
 Did spred abroad, and throw in th'open wynd.<br>
 Yet this in all her words might be perceiued,<br>
 That all she sought, was mens good name to haue bereaued.</p><p>
 
 For what soeuer good by any sayd,<br>
 Or doen she heard, she would streightwayes inuent,<br>
 How to depraue, or slaunderously vpbrayd,<br>
 Or to misconstrue of a mans intent,<br>
 And turne to ill the thing, that well was ment.<br>
 Therefore she vsed often to resort,<br>
 To common haunts, and companies frequent,<br>
 To hearke what any one did good report,<br>
 To blot the same with blame, or wrest in wicked sort.</p><p>
 
 And if that any ill she heard of any,<br>
 She would it eeke, and make much worse by telling,<br>
 And take great ioy to publish it to many,<br>
 That euery matter worse was for her melling,<br>
 Her name was hight <i>Detraction</i>, and her dwelling<br>
 Was neare to <i>Enuie</i>, euen her neighbour next;<br>
 A wicked hag, and <i>Enuy</i> selfe excelling<br>
 In mischiefe: for her selfe she onely vext;<br>
 But this same both her selfe, and others eke perplext.</p><p>
 
 Her face was vgly, and her mouth distort,<br>
 Foming with poyson round about her gils,<br>
 In which her cursed tongue full sharpe and short<br>
 Appear'd like Aspis sting, that closely kils,<br>
 Or cruelly does wound, whom so she wils:<br>
 A distaffe in her other hand she had,<br>
 Vpon the which she litle spinnes, but spils,<br>
 And faynes to weaue false tales and leasings bad,<br>
 To throw amongst the good, which others had disprad.</p><p>
 
 These two now had themselues combynd in one,<br>
 And linckt together gainst Sir <i>Artegall</i>,<br>
 For whom they wayted as his mortall fone,<br>
 How they might make him into mischiefe fall,<br>
 For freeing from their snares <i>Irena</i> thrall:<br>
 Besides vnto themselues they gotten had<br>
 A monster, which the <i>Blatant beast</i> men call,<br>
 A dreadfull feend of gods and men ydrad,<br>
 Whom they by slights allur'd, and to their purpose lad.</p><p>
 
 Such were these Hags, and so vnhandsome drest:<br>
 Who when they nigh approching, had espyde<br>
 Sir <i>Artegall</i> return'd from his late quest,<br>
 They both arose, and at him loudly cryde,<br>
 As it had bene two shepheards curres, had scryde<br>
 A rauenous Wolfe amongst the scattered flockes.<br>
 And <i>Enuie</i> first, as she that first him eyde,<br>
 Towardes him runs, and with rude flaring lockes<br>
 About her eares, does beat her brest, &amp; forhead knockes.</p><p>
 
 Then from her mouth the gobbet she does take,<br>
 The which whyleare she was so greedily<br>
 Deuouring, euen that halfe-gnawen snake,<br>
 And at him throwes it most despightfully.<br>
 The cursed Serpent, though she hungrily<br>
 Earst chawd thereon, yet was not all so dead,<br>
 But that some life remayned secretly,<br>
 And as he past afore withouten dread,<br>
 Bit him behind, that long the marke was to be read.</p><p>
 
 Then th'other comming neare, gan him reuile,<br>
 And fouly rayle, with all she could inuent;<br>
 Saying, that he had with vnmanly guile,<br>
 And foule abusion both his honour blent,<br>
 And that bright sword, the sword of Iustice lent,<br>
 Had stayned with reprochfull crueltie,<br>
 In guiltlesse blood of many an innocent:<br>
 As for <i>Grandtorto</i>, him with treacherie<br>
 And traynes hauing surpriz'd, he fouly did to die.</p><p>
 
 Thereto the Blatant beast by them set on<br>
 At him began aloud to barke and bay,<br>
 With bitter rage and fell contention,<br>
 That all the woods and rockes nigh to that way,<br>
 Began to quake and tremble with dismay;<br>
 And all the aire rebellowed againe.<br>
 So dreadfully his hundred tongues did bray,<br>
 And euermore those hags them selues did paine,<br>
 To sharpen him, and their owne cursed tongs did straine.</p><p>
 
 And still among most bitter wordes they spake,<br>
 Most shamefull, most vnrighteous, most vntrew,<br>
 That they the mildest man aliue would make<br>
 Forget his patience, and yeeld vengeaunce dew<br>
 To her, that so false sclaunders at him threw.<br>
 And more to make thẽ pierce &amp; wound more deepe,<br>
 She with the sting, which in her vile tongue grew,<br>
 Did sharpen them, and in fresh poyson steepe:<br>
 Yet he past on, and seem'd of them to take no keepe.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Talus</i> hearing her so lewdly raile,<br>
 And speake so ill of him, that well deserued,<br>
 Would her haue chastiz'd with his yron flaile,<br>
 If her Sir <i>Artegall</i> had not preserued,<br>
 And him forbidden, who his heast obserued.<br>
 So much the more at him still did she scold,<br>
 And stones did cast, yet he for nought would swerue<br>
 From his right course, but still the way did hold<br>
 To Faery Court, where what him fell shall else be told.</p><p>
