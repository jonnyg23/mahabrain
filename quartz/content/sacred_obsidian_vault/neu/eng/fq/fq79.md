 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Proud</i> Change <i>(not pleasd, in mortall things,<br>
 beneath the Moone, to raigne)<br>
 Pretends, as well of Gods, as Men,<br>
 to be the Soueraine.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 W
 Hat man that sees the euer-whirling wheele<br>
 Of <i>Change</i>, the which all mortall things doth sway,<br>
 But that therby doth find, &amp; plainly feele,<br>
 How <i>MVTABILITY</i> in them doth play<br>
 Her cruell sports, to many mens decay?<br>
 Which that to all may better yet appeare,<br>
 I will rehearse that whylome I heard say,<br>
 How she at first her selfe began to reare,<br>
 Gainst all the Gods, and th'empire sought from them to beare.<p>
 
 But first, here falleth fittest to vnfold<br>
 Her antique race and linage ancient,<br>
 As I haue found it registred of old,<br>
 In <i>Faery</i> Land mongst records permanent:<br>
 She was, to weet, a daughter by descent<br>
 Of those old <i>Titans</i>, that did whylome striue<br>
 VVith <i>Saturnes</i> sonne for heauens regiment.<br>
 Whom, though high <i>Ioue</i> of kingdome did depriue,<br>
 Yet many of their stemme long after did surviue.</p><p>
 
 And many of them, afterwards obtain'd<br>
 Great power of <i>Ioue</i>, and high authority;<br>
 As <i>Hecaté</i>, in whose almighty hand,<br>
 He plac't all rule and principality,<br>
 To be by her disposed diuersly,<br>
 To Gods, and men, as she them list diuide:<br>
 And drad <i>Bellona</i>, that doth sound on hie<br>
 Warres and allarums vnto Nations wide,<br>
 That makes both heauen &amp; earth to tremble at her pride.</p><p>
 
 So likewise did this <i>Titanesse</i> aspire,<br>
 Rule and dominion to her selfe to gaine;<br>
 That as a Goddesse, men might her admire,<br>
 And heauenly honours yield, as to them twaine.<br>
 At first, on earth she sought it to obtaine;<br>
 Where she such proofe and sad examples shewed<br>
 Of her great power, to many ones great paine,<br>
 That not men onely (whom she soone subdewed)<br>
 But eke all other creatures, her bad dooings rewed.</p><p>
 
 For, she the face of earthly things so changed,<br>
 That all which Nature had establisht first<br>
 In good estate, and in meet order ranged,<br>
 She did pervert, and all their statutes burst:<br>
 And all the worlds faire frame (which none yet durst<br>
 Of Gods or men to alter or misguide)<br>
 She alter'd quite, and made them all accurst<br>
 That God had blest; and did at first prouide<br>
 In that still happy state for euer to abide.</p><p>
 
 Ne shee the lawes of Nature onely brake,<br>
 But eke of Iustice, and of Policie;<br>
 And wrong of right, and bad of good did make,<br>
 And death for life exchanged foolishlie:<br>
 Since which, all liuing wights haue learn'd to die,<br>
 And all this world is woxen daily worse.<br>
 Of pittious worke of <i>MVTABILITIE</i>!<br>
 By which, we all are subiect to that curse,<br>
 And death in stead of life haue sucked from our Nurse.</p><p>
 
 And now, when all the earth she thus had brought<br>
 To her behest, and thralled to her might,<br>
 She gan to cast in her ambitious thought,<br>
 T'attempt the empire of the heauens hight,<br>
 And <i>Ioue</i> himselfe to shoulder from his right.<br>
 And first, she past the region of the ayre,<br>
 And of the fire, whose substance thin and slight,<br>
 Made no resistance, ne could her contraire,<br>
 But ready passage to her pleasure did prepaire.</p><p>
 
 Thence, to the Circle of the Moone she clambe,<br>
 Where <i>Cynthia</i> raignes in euerlasting glory,<br>
 To whose bright shining palace straight she came,<br>
 All fairely deckt with heauens goodly story:<br>
 Whose siluer gates (by which there sate an hory<br>
 Old aged Sire, with hower-glasse in hand,<br>
 Hight <i>Tyme</i>) she entred, were he liefe or sory:<br>
 Ne staide till she the highest stage had scand,<br>
 VVhere <i>Cynthia</i> did sit, that neuer still did stand.</p><p>
 
 Her sitting on an Iuory throne shee found,<br>
 Drawne of two steeds, th'one black, the other white,<br>
 Environd with tenne thousand starres around,<br>
 That duly her attended day and night;<br>
 And by her side, there ran her Page, that hight<br>
 <i>Vesper</i>, whom we the Euening-starre intend:<br>
 That with his Torche, still twinkling like twylight,<br>
 Her lightened all the way where she should wend,<br>
 And ioy to weary wandring trauailers did lend:</p><p>
 
 That when the hardy <i>Titanesse</i> beheld<br>
 The goodly building of her Palace bright,<br>
 Made of the heauens substance, and vp-held<br>
 With thousand Crystall pillors of huge hight,<br>
 Shee gan to burne in her ambitious spright,<br>
 And t'envie her that in such glorie raigned.<br>
 Eftsoones she cast by force and tortious might,<br>
 Her to displace; and to her selfe to haue gained<br>
 The kingdome of the Night, and waters by her wained.</p><p>
 
 Boldly she bid the Goddesse downe descend,<br>
 And let her selfe into that Ivory throne;<br>
 For, shee her selfe more worthy thereof wend,<br>
 And better able it to guide alone:<br>
 Whether to men, whose fall she did bemone,<br>
 Or vnto Gods, whose state she did maligne,<br>
 Or to th'infernall Powers, her need giue lone<br>
 Of her faire light, and bounty most benigne,<br>
 Her selfe of all that rule shee deemed most condigne.</p><p>
 
 But shee that had to her that soueraigne seat<br>
 By highest <i>Ioue</i> assign'd, therein to beare<br>
 Nights burning lamp, regarded not her threat,<br>
 Ne yielded ought for fauour or for feare;<br>
 But with sterne countenaunce and disdainfull cheare,<br>
 Bending her horned browes, did put her back:<br>
 And boldly blaming her for comming there,<br>
 Bade her attonce from heauens coast to pack,<br>
 Or at her perill bide the wrathfull Thunders wrack.</p><p>
 
 Yet nathemore the <i>Giantesse</i> forbare:<br>
 But boldly preacing-on, raught forth her hand<br>
 To pluck her downe perforce from off her chaire;<br>
 And there-with lifting vp her golden wand,<br>
 Threatned to strike her if she did with-stand.<br>
 Whereat the starres, which round about her blazed,<br>
 And eke the Moones bright wagon, still did stand,<br>
 All beeing with so bold attempt amazed,<br>
 And on her vncouth habit and sterne looke still gazed.</p><p>
 
 Meane-while, the lower World, which nothing knew<br>
 Of all that chaunced here, was darkned quite;<br>
 And eke the heauens, and all the heauenly crew<br>
 Of happy wights, now vnpurvaide of light,<br>
 Were much afraid, and wondred at that sight;<br>
 Fearing least <i>Chaos</i> broken had his chaine,<br>
 And brought againe on them eternall night:<br>
 But chiefely <i>Mercury</i>, that next doth raigne,<br>
 Ran forth in haste, vnto the king of Gods to plaine.</p><p>
 
 All ran together with a great out-cry,<br>
 To <i>Ioues</i> faire Palace, fixt in heauens hight;<br>
 And beating at his gates full earnestly,<br>
 Gan call to him aloud with all their might,<br>
 To know what meant that suddaine lack of light.<br>
 The father of the Gods when this he heard,<br>
 Was troubled much at their so strange affright,<br>
 Doubting least <i>Typhon</i> were againe vprear'd,<br>
 Or other his old foes, that once him sorely fear'd.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones the sonne of <i>Maia</i> forth he sent<br>
 Downe to the Circle of the Moone, to knowe<br>
 The cause of this so strange astonishment,<br>
 And why shee did her wonted course forslowe;<br>
 And if that any were on earth belowe<br>
 That did with charmes or Magick her molest,<br>
 Him to attache, and downe to hell to throwe:<br>
 But, if from heauen it were, then to arrest<br>
 The Author, and him bring before his presence prest.</p><p>
 
 The wingd-foot God, so fast his plumes did beat,<br>
 That soone he came where-as the <i>Titanesse</i><br>
 Was striuing with faire <i>Cynthia</i> for her seat:<br>
 At whose strange sight, and haughty hardinesse,<br>
 He wondred much, and feared her no lesse.<br>
 Yet laying feare aside to doe his charge,<br>
 At last, he bade her (with bold stedfastnesse)<br>
 Ceasse to molest the Moone to walke at large,<br>
 Or come before high <i>Ioue</i>, her dooings to discharge.</p><p>
 
 And there-with-all, he on her shoulder laid<br>
 His snaky-wreathed Mace, whose awfull power<br>
 Doth make both Gods and hellish fiends affraid:<br>
 Where-at the <i>Titanesse</i> did sternely lower,<br>
 And stoutly answer'd, that in euill hower<br>
 He from his <i>Ioue</i> such message to her brought,<br>
 To bid her leaue faire <i>Cynthias</i> siluer bower;<br>
 Sith shee his <i>Ioue</i> and him esteemed nought,<br>
 No more then <i>Cynthia's</i> selfe; but all their kingdoms sought.</p><p>
 
 The Heauens Herald staid not to reply,<br>
 But past away, his doings to relate<br>
 Vnto his Lord; who now in th'highest sky,<br>
 VVas placed in his principall Estate,<br>
 VVith all the Gods about him congregate:<br>
 To whom when <i>Hermes</i> had his message told,<br>
 It did them all exceedingly amate,<br>
 Saue <i>Ioue</i>; who, changing nought his count'nance bold,<br>
 Did vnto them at length these speeches wise vnfold;</p><p>
 
 Harken to mee awhile yee heauenly Powers;<br>
 Ye may remember since th'Earths cursed seed<br>
 Sought to assaile the heauens eternall towers,<br>
 And to vs all exceeding feare did breed:<br>
 But how we then defeated all their deed,<br>
 Yee all doe knowe, and them destroied quite;<br>
 Yet not so quite, but that there did succeed<br>
 An off-spring of their bloud, which did alite<br>
 Vpon the fruitfull earth, which doth vs yet despite.</p><p>
 
 Of that bad seed is this bold woman bred,<br>
 That now with bold presumption doth aspire<br>
 To thrust faire <i>Phoebe</i> from her siluer bed,<br>
 And eke our selues from heauens high Empire,<br>
 If that her might were match to her desire:<br>
 Wherefore, it now behoues vs to advise<br>
 What way is best to driue her to retire;<br>
 Whether by open force, or counsell wise,<br>
 Areed ye sonnes of God, as best ye can deuise.</p><p>
 
 So hauing said, he ceast; and with his brow<br>
 (His black eye-brow, whose doomefull dreaded beck<br>
 Is wont to wield the world vnto his vow,<br>
 And euen the highest Powers of heauen to check)<br>
 Made signe to them in their degrees to speake:<br>
 Who straight gan cast their counsell graue and wise.<br>
 Meane-while, th'Earths daughter, thogh she nought did reck<br>
 Of <i>Hermes</i> message; yet gan now advise,<br>
 What course were best to take in this hot bold emprize.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones she thus resolv'd; that whil'st the Gods<br>
 (After returne of <i>Hermes</i> Embassie)<br>
 Were troubled, and amongst themselues at ods,<br>
 Before they could new counsels re-allie,<br>
 To set vpon them in that extasie;<br>
 And take what fortune time and place would lend:<br>
 So, forth she rose, and through the purest sky<br>
 To <i>Ioues</i> high Palace straight cast to ascend,<br>
 To prosecute her plot: Good on-set boads good end.</p><p>
 
 Shee there arriuing, boldly in did pass;<br>
 Where all the Gods she found in counsell close,<br>
 All quite vnarm'd, as then their manner was.<br>
 At sight of her they suddaine all arose,<br>
 In great amaze, ne wist what way to chose.<br>
 But <i>Ioue</i>, all fearelesse, forc't them to aby;<br>
 And in his soueraine throne, gan straight dispose<br>
 Himselfe more full of grace and Maiestie,<br>
 That mote encheare his friends, &amp; foes mote terrifie.</p><p>
 
 That, when the haughty <i>Titanesse</i> beheld,<br>
 All were she fraught with pride and impudence,<br>
 Yet with the sight thereof was almost queld;<br>
 And inly quaking, seem'd as reft of sense,<br>
 And voyd of speech in that drad audience;<br>
 Vntill that <i>Ioue</i> himselfe, her selfe bespake:<br>
 Speake thou fraile woman, speake with confidence,<br>
 Whence art thou, and what doost thou here now make?<br>
 What idle errand hast thou, earths mansion to forsake?</p><p>
 
 Shee, halfe confused with his great commaund,<br>
 Yet gathering spirit of her natures pride,<br>
 Him boldly answer'd thus to his demaund:<br>
 I am a daughter, by the mothers side,<br>
 Of her that is Grand-mother magnifide<br>
 Of all the Gods, great <i>Earth</i>, great <i>Chaos</i> child:<br>
 But by the fathers (be it not envide)<br>
 I greater am in bloud (whereon I build)<br>
 Then all the Gods, though wrongfully from heauen exil'd.</p><p>
 
 For, <i>Titan</i> (as ye all acknowledge must)<br>
 Was <i>Saturnes</i> elder brother by birth-right;<br>
 Both, sonnes of <i>Vranus:</i> but by vniust<br>
 And guilefull meanes, through <i>Corybantes</i> slight,<br>
 The younger thrust the elder from his right:<br>
 Since which, thou <i>Ioue</i>, iniuriously hast held<br>
 The Heauens rule from <i>Titans</i> sonnes by might;<br>
 And them to hellish dungeons downe hast feld:<br>
 Witnesse ye Heauens the truth of all that I haue teld.</p><p>
 
 Whil'st she thus spake, the Gods that gaue good eare<br>
 To her bold words, and marked well her grace,<br>
 Beeing of stature tall as any there<br>
 Of all the Gods, and beautifull of face,<br>
 As any of the Goddesses in place,<br>
 Stood all astonied, like a sort of Steeres;<br>
 Mongst whom, some beast of strange &amp; forraine race,<br>
 Vnwares is chaunc't, far straying from his peeres:<br>
 So did their ghastly gaze bewray their hidden feares.</p><p>
 
 Till hauing pauz'd awhile, <i>Ioue</i> thus bespake;<br>
 VVill neuer mortall thoughts ceasse to aspire,<br>
 In this bold sort, to Heauen claime to make,<br>
 And touch celestiall seates with earthly mire?<br>
 I would haue thought, that bold <i>Procrustes</i> hire,<br>
 Or <i>Typhons</i> fall, or proud <i>Ixions</i> paine,<br>
 Or great <i>Prometheus</i>, tasting of our ire,<br>
 Would haue suffiz'd, the rest for to restraine;<br>
 And warn'd all men by their example to refraine:</p><p>
 
 But now, this off-scum of that cursed fry,<br>
 Dare to renew the like bold enterprize,<br>
 And chalenge th'heritage of this our skie;<br>
 Whom what should hinder, but that we likewise<br>
 Should handle as the rest of her allies,<br>
 And thunder-driue to hell? With that, he shooke<br>
 His Nectar-deawed locks, with which the skyes<br>
 And all the world beneath for terror quooke,<br>
 And eft his burning levin-brond in hand he tooke.</p><p>
 
 But, when he looked on her louely face,<br>
 In which, faire beames of beauty did appeare,<br>
 That could the greatest wrath soone turne to grace<br>
 (Such sway doth beauty euen in Heauen beare)<br>
 He staide his hand: and hauing chang'd his cheare,<br>
 He thus againe in milder wise began;<br>
 But ah! if Gods should striue with flesh yfere,<br>
 Then shortly should the progeny of Man<br>
 Be rooted out, if <i>Ioue</i> should doe still what he can:</p><p>
 
 But thee faire <i>Titans</i> child, I rather weene,<br>
 Through some vaine errour or inducement light,<br>
 To see that mortall eyes haue neuer seene;<br>
 Or through ensample of thy sisters might,<br>
 <i>Bellona</i>; whose great glory thou doost spight,<br>
 Since thou hast seene her dreadfull power belowe,<br>
 Mongst wretched men (dismaide with her affright)<br>
 To bandie Crownes, and Kingdomes to bestowe:<br>
 And sure thy worth, no lesse then hers doth seem to showe.</p><p>
 
 But wote thou this, thou hardy <i>Titanesse</i>,<br>
 That not the worth of any liuing wight<br>
 May challenge ought in Heauens interesse;<br>
 Much lesse the Title of old <i>Titans</i> Right:<br>
 For, we by Conquest of our soueraine might,<br>
 And by eternall doome of Fates decree,<br>
 Haue wonne the Empire of the Heauens bright;<br>
 Which to our selues we hold, and to whom wee<br>
 Shall worthy deeme partakers of our blisse to bee.</p><p>
 
 Then ceasse thy idle claime thou foolish gerle,<br>
 And seeke by grace and goodnesse to obtaine<br>
 That place from which by folly <i>Titan</i> fell;<br>
 There-to thou maist perhaps, if so thou faine<br>
 Haue <i>Ioue</i> thy gratious Lord and Soueraigne.<br>
 So, hauing said, she thus to him replide;<br>
 Ceasse <i>Saturnes</i> sonne, to seeke by proffers vaine<br>
 Of idle hopes t'allure mee to thy side,<br>
 For to betray my Right, before I haue it tride.</p><p>
 
 But thee, ô <i>Ioue</i>, no equall Iudge I deeme<br>
 Of my desert, or of my dewfull Right;<br>
 That in thine owne behalfe maist partiall seeme:<br>
 But to the highest him, that is behight<br>
 Father of Gods and men by equall might;<br>
 To weet, the God of Nature, I appeale.<br>
 There-at <i>Ioue</i> wexed wroth, and in his spright<br>
 Did inly grudge, yet did it well conceale;<br>
 And bade <i>Dan Phoebus</i> Scribe her Appellation seale.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones the time and place appointed were,<br>
 Where all, both heauenly Powers, &amp; earthly wights,<br>
 Before great Natures presence should appeare,<br>
 For triall of their Titles and best Rights:<br>
 That was, to weet, vpon the highest hights<br>
 Of <i>Arlo-hill</i> (Who knowes not <i>Arlo-hill?</i>)<br>
 That is the highest head (in all mens sights)<br>
 Of my old father <i>Mole</i>, whom Shepheards quill<br>
 Renowmed hath with hymnes fit for a rurall skill.</p><p>
 
 And, were it not ill fitting for this file,<br>
 To sing of hilles &amp; woods, mongst warres &amp; Knights,<br>
 I would abate the sternenesse of my stile,<br>
 Mongst these sterne stounds to mingle soft delights;<br>
 And tell how <i>Arlo</i> through <i>Dianaes</i> spights<br>
 (Beeing of old the best and fairest Hill<br>
 That was in all this holy-Islands hights)<br>
 Was made the most vnpleasant, and most ill.<br>
 Meane while, ô <i>Clio</i>, lend <i>Calliope</i> thy quill.</p><p>
 
 Whylome, when <i>IRELAND</i> florished in fame<br>
 Of wealths and goodnesse, far aboue the rest<br>
 Of all that beare the <i>British</i> Islands name,<br>
 The Gods then vs'd (for pleasure and for rest)<br>
 Oft to resort there-to, when seem'd them best:<br>
 But none of all there-in more pleasure found,<br>
 Then <i>Cynthia</i>; that is soueraine Queene profest<br>
 Of woods and forrests, which therein abound,<br>
 Sprinkled with wholsom waters, more thẽ most on ground.</p><p>
 
 But mongst them all, as fittest for her game,<br>
 Either for chace of beasts with hound or boawe,<br>
 Or for to shroude in shade from <i>Phoebus</i> flame,<br>
 Or bathe in fountaines that doe freshly flowe,<br>
 Or from high hilles, or from the dales belowe,<br>
 She chose this <i>Arlo</i>; where shee did resort<br>
 With all her Nymphes enranged on a rowe,<br>
 With whom the woody Gods did oft consort:<br>
 For, with the Nymphes, the Satyres loue to play &amp; sport.</p><p>
 
 Amongst the which, there was a Nymph that hight<br>
 <i>Molanna</i>; daughter of old father <i>Mole</i>,<br>
 And sister vnto <i>Mulla</i>, faire and bright:<br>
 Vnto whose bed false <i>Bregog</i> whylome stole,<br>
 That Shepheard <i>Colin</i> dearely did condole,<br>
 And made her lucklesse loues well knowne to be.<br>
 But this <i>Molanna</i>, were she not so shole,<br>
 Were no lesse faire and beautifull then shee:<br>
 Yet as she is, a fairer flood may no man see.</p><p>
 
 For, first, she springs out of two marble Rocks,<br>
 On which, a groue of Oakes high mounted growes,<br>
 That as a girlond seemes to deck the locks<br>
 Of som faire Bride, brought forth with pompous showes<br>
 Out of her bowre, that many flowers strowes:<br>
 So, through the flowry Dales she tumbling downe,<br>
 Through many woods, and shady coverts flowes<br>
 (That on each side her siluer channell crowne)<br>
 Till to the Plaine she come, whose Valleyes shee doth drowne.</p><p>
 
 In her sweet streames, <i>Diana</i> vsed oft<br>
 (After her sweatie chace and toilesome play)<br>
 To bathe her selfe; and after, on the soft<br>
 And downy grasse, her dainty limbes to lay<br>
 In couert shade, where none behold her may:<br>
 For, much she hated sight of liuing eye.<br>
 Foolish God <i>Faunus</i>, though full many a day<br>
 He saw her clad, yet longed foolishly<br>
 To see her naked mongst her Nymphes in priuity.</p><p>
 
 No way he found to compasse his desire,<br>
 But to corrupt <i>Molanna</i>, this her maid,<br>
 Her to discouer for some secret hire:<br>
 So, her with flattering words he first assaid;<br>
 And after, pleasing gifts for her purvaid,<br>
 Queene-apples, and red Cherries from the tree,<br>
 VVith which he her allured and betraid,<br>
 To tell what time he might her Lady see<br>
 When she her selfe did bathe, that he might secret bee.</p><p>
 
 There-to hee promist, if shee would him pleasure<br>
 With this small boone, to quit her with a better;<br>
 To weet, that where-as shee had out of measure<br>
 Long lov'd the <i>Fanchin</i>, who by nought did set her,<br>
 That he would vndertake, for this to get her<br>
 To be his Loue, and of him liked well:<br>
 Besides all which, he vow'd to be her debter<br>
 For many moe good turnes then he would tell;<br>
 The least of which, this little pleasure should excell.</p><p>
 
 The simple maid did yield to him anone;<br>
 And eft him placed where he close might view<br>
 That neuer any saw, saue onely one;<br>
 VVho, for his hire to so foole-hardy dew,<br>
 Was of his hounds devour'd in Hunters hew.<br>
 Tho, as her manner was on sunny day,<br>
 <i>Diana</i>, with her Nymphes about her, drew<br>
 To this sweet spring; where, doffing her array,<br>
 She bath'd her louely limbes, for <i>Ioue</i> a likely pray.</p><p>
 
 There <i>Faunus</i> saw that pleased much his eye,<br>
 And made his hart to tickle in his brest,<br>
 That for great ioy of some-what he did spy,<br>
 He could him not containe in silent rest;<br>
 But breaking forth in laughter, loud profest<br>
 His foolish thought.  O foolish <i>Faune</i> indeed,<br>
 That couldst not hold thy selfe so hidden blest,<br>
 But wouldest needs thine owne conceit areed.<br>
 Babblers vnworthy been of so diuine a meed.</p><p>
 
 The Goddesse, all abashed with that noise,<br>
 In haste forth started from the guilty brooke;<br>
 And running straight where-as she heard his voice,<br>
 Enclos'd the bush about, and there him tooke,<br>
 Like darred Larke; not daring vp to looke<br>
 On her whose sight before so much he sought.<br>
 Thence, forth they drew him by the hornes, &amp; shooke<br>
 Nigh all to peeces, that they left him nought;<br>
 And then into the open light they forth him brought.</p><p>
 
 Like as an huswife, that with busie care<br>
 Thinks of her Dairie to make wondrous gaine,<br>
 Finding where-as some wicked beast vnware<br>
 That breakes into her Dayr'house, there doth draine<br>
 Her creaming pannes, and frustrate all her paine;<br>
 Hath in some snare or gin set close behind,<br>
 Entrapped him, and caught into her traine,<br>
 Then thinkes what punishment were best assign'd,<br>
 And thousand deathes deuiseth in her vengefull mind:</p><p>
 
 So did <i>Diana</i> and her maydens all<br>
 Vse silly <i>Faunus</i>, now within their baile:<br>
 They mocke and scorne him, and him foule miscall;<br>
 Some by the nose him pluckt, some by the taile,<br>
 And by his goatish beard some did him haile:<br>
 Yet he (poore soule) with patience all did beare;<br>
 For, nought against their wils might countervaile:<br>
 Ne ought he said what euer he did heare;<br>
 But hanging downe his head, did like a Mome appeare.</p><p>
 
 At length, when they had flouted him their fill,<br>
 They gan to cast what penaunce him to giue.<br>
 Some would haue gelt him, but that same would spill<br>
 The Wood-gods breed, which must for euer liue:<br>
 Others would through the riuer him haue driue,<br>
 And ducked deepe: but that seem'd penaunce light;<br>
 But most agreed and did this sentence giue,<br>
 Him in Deares skin to clad; &amp; in that plight,<br>
 To hunt him with their hounds, him selfe saue how hee might.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Cynthia's</i> selfe, more angry then the rest,<br>
 Thought not enough, to punish him in sport,<br>
 And of her shame to make a gamesome iest;<br>
 But gan examine him in straighter sort,<br>
 Which of her Nymphes, or other close consort,<br>
 Him thither brought, and her to him betraid?<br>
 He, much affeard, to her confessed short,<br>
 That 'twas <i>Molanna</i> which her so bewraid.<br>
 Then all attonce their hands vpon <i>Molanna</i> laid.</p><p>
 
 But him (according as they had decreed)<br>
 With a Deeres-skin they couered, and then chast<br>
 With all their hounds that after him did speed;<br>
 But he more speedy, from them fled more fast<br>
 Then any Deere: so sore him dread aghast.<br>
 They after follow'd all with shrill out-cry,<br>
 Shouting as they the heauens would haue brast:<br>
 That all the woods and dales where he did flie,<br>
 Did ring againe, and loud reeccho to the skie.</p><p>
 
 So they him follow'd till they weary were;<br>
 When, back returning to <i>Molann</i>' againe,<br>
 They, by commaund'ment of <i>Diana</i>, there<br>
 Her whelm'd with stones.  Yet <i>Faunus</i> (for her paine)<br>
 Of her beloued <i>Fanchin</i> did obtaine,<br>
 That her he would receiue vnto his bed.<br>
 So now her waues passe through a pleasant Plaine,<br>
 Till with the <i>Fanchin</i> she her selfe doe wed,<br>
 And (both combin'd) themselues in one faire riuer spred.</p><p>
 
 Nath'lesse, <i>Diana</i>, full of indignation,<br>
 Thence-forth abandond her delicious brooke;<br>
 In whose sweet streame, before that bad occasion,<br>
 So much delight to bathe her limbes she tooke:<br>
 Ne onely her, but also quite forsooke<br>
 All those faire forrests about <i>Arlo</i> hid,<br>
 And all that Mountaine, which doth over-looke<br>
 The richest champian that may else be rid,<br>
 And the faire <i>Shure</i>, in which are thousand Salmons bred.</p><p>
 
 Them all, and all that she so deare did way,<br>
 Thence-forth she left; and parting from the place,<br>
 There-on an heauy haplesse curse did lay,<br>
 To weet, that Wolues, where she was wont to space,<br>
 Should harbour'd be, and all those Woods deface,<br>
 And Thieues should rob and spoile that Coast around.<br>
 Since which, those Woods, and all that goodly Chase,<br>
 Doth to this day with Wolues and Thieues abound:<br>
 Which too-too true that lands in-dwellers since haue foũd.</p><p>
