 </p><blockquote> 
 <i>Guyon is of immodest Merth,<br>
 led into loose desire,<br>
 Fights with Cymochles, whiles his bro-<br>
 ther burnes in furious fire.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote> 
 
  
 <p>
 </p><blockquote> 
 A harder lesson, to learne Continence<br>
 In ioyous pleasure, then in grieuous paine:<br>
 or sweetnesse doth allure the weaker sence<br>
 So strongly, that vneathes it can refraine<br>
 From that, which feeble nature couets faine;<br>
 But griefe and wrath, that be her enemies,<br>
 And foes of life, she better can restraine;<br>
 Yet vertue vauntes in both their victories,<br>
 And <i>Guyon</i> in them all shewes goodly maisteries.<p>
  
 Whom bold <i>Cymochles</i> trauelling to find,<br>
 With cruell purpose bent to wreake on him<br>
 The wrath, which <i>Atin</i> kindled in his mind,<br>
 Came to a riuer, by whose vtmost brim<br>
 Wayting to passe, he saw whereas did swim<br>
 A long the shore, as swift as glaunce of eye,<br>
 A litle Gondelay, bedecked trim<br>
 With boughes and arbours wouen cunningly,<br>
 That like a litle forrest seemed outwardly.</p><p>
  
 And therein sate a Ladie fresh and faire,<br>
 Making sweet solace to her selfe alone;<br>
 Sometimes she sung, as loud as larke in aire,<br>
 Sometimes she laught, that nigh her breth was gone,<br>
 Yet was there not with her else any one,<br>
 That might to her moue cause of meriment:<br>
 Matter of merth enough, though there were none<br>
 She could deuise, and thousand waies inuent,<br>
 To feede her foolish humour, and vaine iolliment.</p><p>
  
 Which when farre off <i>Cymochles</i> heard, and saw,<br>
 He loudly cald to such, as were a bord,<br>
 The little barke vnto the shore to draw,<br>
 And him to ferrie ouer that deepe ford:<br>
 The merry marriner vnto his word<br>
 Soone hearkned, and her painted bote streightway<br>
 Turnd to the shore, where that same warlike Lord<br>
 She in receiu'd; but <i>Atin</i> by no way<br>
 She would admit, albe the knight her much did pray.</p><p>
  
 Eftsoones her shallow ship away did slide,<br>
 More swift, then swallow sheres the liquid skie,<br>
 Withouten oare or Pilot it to guide,<br>
 Or winged canuas with the wind to flie,<br>
 Only she turn'd a pin, and by and by<br>
 It cut away vpon the yielding waue,<br>
 Ne cared she her course for to apply:<br>
 For it was taught the way, which she would haue,<br>
 And both from rocks and flats it selfe could wisely saue.</p><p>
  
 And all the way, the wanton Damzell found<br>
 New merth, her passenger to entertaine:<br>
 For she in pleasant purpose did abound,<br>
 And greatly ioyed merry tales to faine,<br>
 Of which a store-house did with her remaine,<br>
 Yet seemed, nothing well they her became;<br>
 For all her words she drownd with laughter vaine,<br>
 And wanted grace in vtt'ring of the same,<br>
 That turned all her pleasance to a scoffing game.</p><p>
  
 And other whiles vaine toyes she would deuize<br>
 As her fantasticke wit did most delight,<br>
 Sometimes her head she fondly would aguize<br>
 With gaudie girlonds, or fresh flowrets dight<br>
 About her necke, or rings of rushes plight;<br>
 Sometimes to doe him laugh, she would assay<br>
 To laugh at shaking of the leaues light,<br>
 Or to behold the water worke, and play<br>
 About her litle frigot, therein making way.</p><p>
  
 Her light behauiour, and loose dalliaunce<br>
 Gaue wondrous great contentment to the knight,<br>
 That of his way he had no souenaunce,<br>
 Nor care of vow'd reuenge, and cruell fight,<br>
 But to weake wench did yeeld his martiall might.<br>
 So easie was to quench his flamed mind<br>
 With one sweet drop of sensuall delight:<br>
 So easie is, t'appease the stormie wind<br>
 Of malice in the calme of pleasant womankind.</p><p>
  
 Diuerse discourses in their way they spent,<br>
 Mongst which <i>Cymochles</i> of her questioned,<br>
 Both what she was, and what that vsage ment,<br>
 Which in her cot she daily practised.<br>
 Vaine man (said she) that wouldest be reckoned<br>
 A straunger in thy home, and ignoraunt<br>
 Of <i>Phædria</i> (for so my name is red)<br>
 Of <i>Phædria</i>, thine owne fellow seruaunt;<br>
 For thou to serue <i>Acrasia</i> thy selfe doest vaunt.</p><p>
  
 In this wide Inland sea, that hight by name<br>
 The <i>Idle lake</i>, my wandring ship I row,<br>
 That knowes her port, and thither sailes by ayme,<br>
 Ne care, ne feare I, how the wind do blow,<br>
 Or whether swift I wend, or whether slow:<br>
 Both slow and swift a like do serue my tourne,<br>
 Ne swelling <i>Neptune</i>, ne loud thundring <i>Ioue</i><br>
 Can chaunge my cheare, or make me euer mourne;<br>
 My litle boat can safely passe this perilous bourne.</p><p>
  
 Whiles thus she talked, and whiles thus she toyd,<br>
 They were farre past the passage, which he spake,<br>
 And come vnto an Island, waste and voyd,<br>
 That floted in the midst of that great lake:<br>
 There her small Gondelay her port did make,<br>
 And that gay paire issuing on the shore<br>
 Disburdned her.  Their way they forward take<br>
 Into the land, that lay them faire before,<br>
 Whose pleasaunce she him shew'd, and plentifull great store.</p><p>
  
 It was a chosen plot of fertile land,<br>
 Emongst wide waues set, like a litle nest,<br>
 As if it had by Natures cunning hand,<br>
 Bene choisely picked out from all the rest,<br>
 And laid forth for ensample of the best:<br>
 No daintie flowre or herbe, that growes on ground,<br>
 No arboret with painted blossomes drest,<br>
 And smelling sweet, but there it might be found<br>
 To bud out faire, and her sweet smels throw all around.</p><p>
  
 No tree, whose braunches did not brauely spring;<br>
 No braunch, whereon a fine bird did not sit:<br>
 No bird, but did her shrill notes sweetly sing;<br>
 No song but did containe a louely dit:<br>
 Trees, braunches, birds, and songs were framed fit,<br>
 For to allure fraile mind to carelesse ease.<br>
 Carelesse the man soone woxe, and his weake wit<br>
 Was ouercome of thing, that did him please;<br>
 So pleased, did his wrathfull purpose faire appease.</p><p>
  
 Thus when she had his eyes and senses fed<br>
 With false delights, and fild with pleasures vaine,<br>
 Into a shadie dale she soft him led,<br>
 And laid him downe vpon a grassie plaine;<br>
 And her sweet selfe without dread, or disdaine,<br>
 She set beside, laying his head disarm'd<br>
 In her loose lap, it softly to sustaine,<br>
 Where soone he slumbred, fearing not be harm'd,<br>
 The whiles with a loue lay she thus him sweetly charm'd.</p><p>
  
 Behold, ô man, that toilesome paines doest take<br>
 The flowres, the fields, and all that pleasant growes,<br>
 How they themselues doe thine ensample make,<br>
 Whiles nothing enuious nature them forth throwes<br>
 Out of her fruitfull lap; how, no man knowes,<br>
 They spring, they bud, they blossome fresh and faire,<br>
 And deck the world with their rich pompous showes;<br>
 Yet no man for them taketh paines or care,<br>
 Yet no man to them can his carefull paines compare.</p><p>
  
 The lilly, Ladie of the flowring field,<br>
 The Flowre-deluce, her louely Paramoure,<br>
 Bid thee to them thy fruitlesse labours yield,<br>
 And soone leaue off this toylesome wearie stoure;<br>
 Loe loe how braue she decks her bounteous boure,<br>
 With silken curtens and gold couerlets,<br>
 Therein to shrowd her sumptuous Belamoure,<br>
 Yet neither spinnes nor cardes, ne cares nor frets,<br>
 But to her mother Nature all her care she lets.</p><p>
  
 Why then dost thou, ô man, that of them all<br>
 Art Lord, and eke of nature Soueraine,<br>
 Wilfully make thy selfe a wretched thrall,<br>
 And wast thy ioyous houres in needlesse paine,<br>
 Seeking for daunger and aduentures vaine?<br>
 What bootes it all to haue, and nothing vse?<br>
 Who shall him rew, that swimming in the maine,<br>
 Will die for thirst, and water doth refuse?<br>
 Refuse such fruitlesse toile, and present pleasures chuse.</p><p>
  
 By this she had him lulled fast a sleepe,<br>
 That of no wordly thing he care did take;<br>
 Then she with liquors strong his eyes did steepe,<br>
 That nothing should him hastily awake:<br>
 So she him left, and did her selfe betake<br>
 Vnto her boat againe, with which she cleft<br>
 The slouthfull waue of that great griesly lake;<br>
 Soone she that Island farre behind her left,<br>
 And now is come to that same place, where first she weft.</p><p>
  
 By this time was the worthy <i>Guyon</i> brought<br>
 Vnto the other side of that wide strond,<br>
 Where she was rowing, and for passage sought:<br>
 Him needed not long call, she soone to hond<br>
 Her ferry brought, where him she byding fond,<br>
 With his sad guide; himselfe she tooke a boord,<br>
 But the <i>Blacke Palmer</i> suffred still to stond,<br>
 Ne would for price, or prayers once affoord,<br>
 To ferry that old man ouer the perlous foord.</p><p>
  
 <i>Guyon</i> was loath to leaue his guide behind,<br>
 Yet being entred, might not backe retyre;<br>
 For the flit barke, obaying to her mind,<br>
 Forth launched quickly, as she did desire,<br>
 Ne gaue him leaue to bid that aged sire<br>
 Adieu, but nimbly ran her wonted course<br>
 Through the dull billowes thicke as troubled mire,<br>
 Whom neither wind out of their seat could forse,<br>
 Nor timely tides did driue out of their sluggish sourse.</p><p>
  
 And by the way, as was her wonted guize,<br>
 Her merry fit she freshly gan to reare,<br>
 And did of ioy and iollitie deuize,<br>
 Her selfe to cherish, and her guest to cheare:<br>
 The knight was courteous, and did not forbeare<br>
 Her honest merth and pleasaunce to partake;<br>
 But when he saw her toy, and gibe, and geare,<br>
 And passe the bonds of modest merimake,<br>
 Her dalliance he despisd, and follies did forsake.</p><p>
  
 Yet she still followed her former stile,<br>
 And said, and did all that mote him delight,<br>
 Till they arriued in that pleasant Ile,<br>
 Where sleeping late she left her other knight.<br>
 But when as <i>Guyon</i> of that land had sight,<br>
 He wist himselfe amisse, and angry said;<br>
 Ah Dame, perdie ye haue not doen me right,<br>
 Thus to mislead me, whiles I you obaid:<br>
 Me litle needed from my right way to haue straid.</p><p>
  
 Faire Sir (quoth she) be not displeasd at all;<br>
 Who fares on sea, may not commaund his way,<br>
 Ne wind and weather at his pleasure call:<br>
 The sea is wide, and easie for to stray;<br>
 The wind vnstable, and doth neuer stay.<br>
 But here a while ye may in safety rest,<br>
 Till season serue new passage to assay;<br>
 Better safe port, then be in seas distrest.<br>
 Therewith she laught, and did her earnest end in iest.</p><p>
  
 But he halfe discontent, mote nathelesse<br>
 Himselfe appease, and issewd forth on shore:<br>
 The ioyes whereof, and happie fruitfulnesse,<br>
 Such as he saw, she gan him lay before,<br>
 And all though pleasant, yet she made much more:<br>
 The fields did laugh, the flowres did freshly spring,<br>
 The trees did bud, and earely blossomes bore,<br>
 And all the quire of birds did sweetly sing,<br>
 And told that gardins pleasures in their caroling.</p><p>
  
 And she more sweet, then any bird on bough,<br>
 Would oftentimes emongst them beare a part,<br>
 And striue to passe (as she could well enough)<br>
 Their natiue musicke by her skilfull art:<br>
 So did she all, that might his constant hart<br>
 Withdraw from thought of warlike enterprize,<br>
 And drowne in dissolute delights apart,<br>
 Where noyse of armes, or vew of martiall guize<br>
 Might not reuiue desire of knightly exercize.</p><p>
  
 But he was wise, and warie of her will,<br>
 And euer held his hand vpon his hart:<br>
 Yet would not seeme so rude, and thewed ill,<br>
 As to despise so courteous seeming part,<br>
 That gentle Ladie did to him impart,<br>
 But fairely tempring fond desire subdewd,<br>
 And euer her desired to depart.<br>
 She list not heare, but her disports poursewd,<br>
 And euer bad him stay, till time the tide renewd.</p><p>
  
 And now by this, <i>Cymochles</i> howre was spent,<br>
 That he awoke out of his idle dreme,<br>
 And shaking off his drowzie dreriment,<br>
 Gan him auize, how ill did him beseeme,<br>
 In slouthfull sleepe his molten hart to steme,<br>
 And quench the brond of his conceiued ire.<br>
 Tho vp he started, stird with shame extreme,<br>
 Ne staied for his Damzell to inquire,<br>
 But marched to the strond, their passage to require.</p><p>
  
 And in the way he with Sir <i>Guyon</i> met,<br>
 Accompanyde with <i>Phædria</i> the faire,<br>
 Eftsoones he gan to rage, and inly fret,<br>
 Crying, Let be that Ladie debonaire,<br>
 Thou recreant knight, and soone thy selfe prepaire<br>
 To battell, if thou meane her loue to gaine:<br>
 Loe, loe alreadie, how the fowles in aire<br>
 Doe flocke, awaiting shortly to obtaine<br>
 Thy carcasse for their pray, the guerdon of thy paine.</p><p>
  
 And therewithall he fiercely at him flew,<br>
 And with importune outrage him assayld;<br>
 Who soone prepard to field, his sword forth drew,<br>
 And him with equall value counteruayld:<br>
 Their mightie strokes their haberieons dismayld,<br>
 And naked made each others manly spalles;<br>
 The mortall steele despiteously entayld<br>
 Deepe in their flesh, quite through the yron walles,<br>
 That a large purple streme adown their giambeux falles.</p><p>
  
 <i>Cymochles</i>, that had neuer met before<br>
 So puissant foe, with enuious despight<br>
 His proud presumed force increased more,<br>
 Disdeigning to be held so long in fight;<br>
 Sir <i>Guyon</i> grudging not so much his might,<br>
 As those vnknightly raylings, which he spoke,<br>
 With wrathfull fire his courage kindled bright,<br>
 Thereof deuising shortly to be wroke,<br>
 And doubling all his powres, redoubled euery stroke.</p><p>
  
 Both of them high attonce their hands enhaunst,<br>
 And both attonce their huge blowes downe did sway;<br>
 <i>Cymochles</i> sword on <i>Guyons</i> shield yglaunst,<br>
 And thereof nigh one quarter sheard away;<br>
 But <i>Guyons</i> angry blade so fierce did play<br>
 On th'others helmet, which as <i>Titan</i> shone,<br>
 That quite it cloue his plumed crest in tway,<br>
 And bared all his head vnto the bone;<br>
 Wherewith astonisht, still he stood, as senselesse stone.</p><p>
  
 Still as he stood, faire <i>Phædria</i>, that beheld<br>
 That deadly daunger, soone atweene them ran;<br>
 And at their feet her selfe most humbly feld,<br>
 Crying with pitteous voice, and count'nance wan;<br>
 Ah well away, most noble Lords, how can<br>
 Your cruell eyes endure so pitteous sight,<br>
 To shed your liues on ground? wo worth the man,<br>
 That first did teach the cursed steele to bight<br>
 In his owne flesh, and make way to the liuing spright.</p><p>
  
 If euer loue of Ladie did empierce<br>
 Your yron brestes, or pittie could find place,<br>
 Withhold your bloudie hands from battell fierce,<br>
 And sith for me ye fight, to me this grace<br>
 Both yeeld, to stay your deadly strife a space.<br>
 They stayd a while: and forth she gan proceed:<br>
 Most wretched woman, and of wicked race,<br>
 That am the author of this hainous deed,<br>
 And cause of death betweene two doughtie knights doe breed.</p><p>
  
 But if for me ye fight, or me will serue,<br>
 Not this rude kind of battell, nor these armes<br>
 Are meet, the which doe men in bale to sterue,<br>
 And dolefull sorrow heape with deadly harmes:<br>
 Such cruell game my scarmoges disarmes:<br>
 Another warre, and other weapons I<br>
 Doe loue, where loue does giue his sweet alarmes,<br>
 Without bloudshed, and where the enemy<br>
 Does yeeld vnto his foe a pleasant victory.</p><p>
  
 Debatefull strife, and cruell enmitie<br>
 The famous name of knighthood fowly shend;<br>
 But louely peace, and gentle amitie,<br>
 And in Amours the passing houres to spend,<br>
 The mightie martiall hands doe most commend;<br>
 Of loue they euer greater glory bore,<br>
 Then of their armes: <i>Mars</i> is <i>Cupidoes</i> frend,<br>
 And is for <i>Venus</i> loues renowmed more,<br>
 Then all his wars and spoiles, the which he did of yore.</p><p>
  
 Therewith she sweetly smyld.  They though full bent,<br>
 To proue extremities of bloudie fight,<br>
 Yet at her speach their rages gan relent,<br>
 And calme the sea of their tempestuous spight,<br>
 Such powre haue pleasing words: such is the might<br>
 Of courteous clemencie in gentle hart.<br>
 Now after all was ceast, the Faery knight<br>
 Besought that Damzell suffer him depart,<br>
 And yield him readie passage to that other part.</p><p>
  
 She no lesse glad, then he desirous was<br>
 Of his departure thence; for of her ioy<br>
 And vaine delight she saw he light did pas,<br>
 A foe of folly and immodest toy,<br>
 Still solemne sad, or still disdainfull coy,<br>
 Delighting all in armes and cruell warre,<br>
 That her sweet peace and pleasures did annoy,<br>
 Troubled with terrour and vnquiet iarre,<br>
 That she well pleased was thence to amoue him farre.</p><p>
  
 Tho him she brought abord, and her swift bote<br>
 Forthwith directed to that further strand;<br>
 The which on the dull waues did lightly flote<br>
 And soone arriued on the shallow sand,<br>
 Where gladsome <i>Guyon</i> salied forth to land,<br>
 And to that Damzell thankes gaue for reward.<br>
 Vpon that shore he spied <i>Atin</i> stand,<br>
 There by his maister left, when late he far'd<br>
 In <i>Phædrias</i> flit barke ouer that perlous shard.</p><p>
  
 Well could he him remember, sith of late<br>
 He with <i>Pyrrochles</i> sharp debatement made;<br>
 Streight gan he him reuile, and bitter rate,<br>
 As shepheards curre, that in darke euenings shade<br>
 Hath tracted forth some saluage beastes trade;<br>
 Vile Miscreant (said he) whither doest thou flie<br>
 The shame and death, which will thee soone inuade?<br>
 What coward hand shall doe thee next to die,<br>
 That art thus foully fled from famous enemie?</p><p>
  
 With that he stiffely shooke his steelehead dart:<br>
 But sober <i>Guyon</i>, hearing him so raile,<br>
 Though somewhat moued in his mightie hart,<br>
 Yet with strong reason maistred passion fraile,<br>
 And passed fairely forth.  He turning taile,<br>
 Backe to the strond retyrd, and there still stayd,<br>
 Awaiting passage, which him late did faile;<br>
 The whiles <i>Cymochles</i> with that wanton mayd<br>
 The hastie heat of his auowd reuenge delayd.</p><p>
  
 Whylest there the varlet stood, he saw from farre<br>
 An armed knight, that towards him fast ran,<br>
 He ran on foot, as if in lucklesse warre<br>
 His forlorne steed from him the victour wan;<br>
 He seemed breathlesse, hartlesse, faint, and wan,<br>
 And all his armour sprinckled was with bloud,<br>
 And soyld with durtie gore, that no man can<br>
 Discerne the hew thereof.  He neuer stood,<br>
 But bent his hastie course towards the idle flood.</p><p>
  
 The varlet saw, when to the flood he came,<br>
 How without stop or stay he fiercely lept,<br>
 And deepe him selfe beduked in the same,<br>
 That in the lake his loftie crest was steept,<br>
 Ne of his safetie seemed care he kept,<br>
 But with his raging armes he rudely flasht,<br>
 The waues about, and all his armour swept,<br>
 That all the bloud and filth away was washt,<br>
 Yet still he bet the water, and the billowes dasht.</p><p>
  
 <i>Atin</i> drew nigh, to weet what it mote bee;<br>
 For much he wondred at that vncouth sight;<br>
 Whom should he, but his owne deare Lord, there see,<br>
 His owne deare Lord <i>Pyrrochles</i>, in sad plight,<br>
 Readie to drowne himselfe for fell despight.<br>
 Harrow now out, and well away, he cryde,<br>
 What dismall day hath lent this cursed light,<br>
 To see my Lord so deadly damnifyde<br>
 <i>Pyrrochles</i>, ô <i>Pyrrochles</i>, what is thee betyde?</p><p>
  
 I burne, I burne, I burne, then loud he cryde,<br>
 O how I burne with implacable fire,<br>
 Yet nought can quench mine inly flaming syde,<br>
 Nor sea of licour cold, nor lake of mire,<br>
 Nothing but death can doe me to respire.<br>
 Ah be it (said he) from <i>Pyrrochles</i> farre<br>
 After pursewing death once to require,<br>
 Or think, that ought those puissant hands may marre:<br>
 Death is for wretches borne vnder vnhappie starre.</p><p>
  
 Perdie, then is it fit for me (said he)<br>
 That am, I weene, most wretched man aliue,<br>
 Burning in flames, yet no flames can I see,<br>
 And dying daily, daily yet reuiue:<br>
 O <i>Atin</i>, helpe to me last death to giue.<br>
 The varlet at his plaint was grieu'd so sore,<br>
 That his deepe wounded hart in two did riue,<br>
 And his owne health remembring now no more,<br>
 Did follow that ensample, which he blam'd afore.</p><p>
  
 Into the lake he lept, his Lord to ayd,<br>
 (So Loue the dread of daunger doth despise)<br>
 And of him catching hold him strongly stayd<br>
 From drowning.  But more happie he, then wise<br>
 Of that seas nature did him not auise.<br>
 The waues thereof so slow and sluggish were,<br>
 Engrost with mud, which did them foule agrise,<br>
 That euery weightie thing they did vpbeare,<br>
 Ne ought mote euer sinke downe to the bottome there.</p><p>
  
 Whiles thus they strugled in that idle waue,<br>
 And stroue in vaine, the one himselfe to drowne,<br>
 The other both from drowning for to saue,<br>
 Lo, to that shore one in an auncient gowne,<br>
 Whose hoarie locks great grauitie did crowne,<br>
 Holding in hand a goodly arming sword,<br>
 By fortune came, led with the troublous sowne:<br>
 Where drenched deepe he found in that dull ford<br>
 The carefull seruant, striuing with his raging Lord.</p><p>
  
 Him <i>Atin</i> spying, knew right well of yore,<br>
 And loudly cald, Helpe helpe, ô <i>Archimage</i>;<br>
 To saue my Lord, in wretched plight forlore;<br>
 Helpe with thy hand, or with thy counsell sage:<br>
 Weake hands, but counsell is most strong in age.<br>
 Him when the old man saw, he wondred sore,<br>
 To see <i>Pyrrochles</i> there so rudely rage:<br>
 Yet sithens helpe, he saw, he needed more<br>
 Then pittie, he in hast approched to the shore.</p><p>
  
 And cald, <i>Pyrrochles</i>, what is this, I see?<br>
 What hellish furie hath at earst thee hent?<br>
 Furious euer I thee knew to bee,<br>
 Yet neuer in this straunge astonishment.<br>
 These flames, these flames (he cryde) do me torment.<br>
 What flames (quoth he) when I thee present see,<br>
 In daunger rather to be drent, then brent?<br>
 Harrow, the flames, which me consume (said hee)<br>
 Ne can be quencht, within my secret bowels bee.</p><p>
  
 That cursed man, that cruell feend of hell,<br>
 <i>Furor</i>, oh <i>Furor</i> hath me thus bedight:<br>
 His deadly wounds within my liuers swell,<br>
 And his whot fire burnes in mine entrails bright,<br>
 Kindled through his infernall brond of spight,<br>
 Sith late with him I batteil vaine would boste;<br>
 That now I weene <i>Ioues</i> dreaded thunder light<br>
 Does scorch not halfe so sore, nor damned ghoste<br>
 In flaming <i>Phlegeton</i> does not so felly roste.</p><p>
  
 Which when as <i>Archimago</i> heard, his griefe<br>
 He knew right well, and him attonce disarmd:<br>
 Then searcht his secret wounds, and made a priefe<br>
 Of euery place, that was with brusing harmd,<br>
 Or with the hidden fire too inly warmd.<br>
 Which done, he balmes and herbes thereto applyde,<br>
 And eue[r]more with mighty spels them charmd,<br>
 That in short space he has them qualifyde,<br>
 And him restor'd to health, that would haue algates dyde.</p><p>
