 <i>Bold Marinell of Britomart,<br>
 Is throwne on the Rich strond:<br>
 Faire Florimell of Arthur is<br>
 Long followed, but not fond.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 VV
 Here is the Antique glory now become,<br>
 That whilome wont in women to appeare?<br>
 Where be the braue atchieuements doen by some?<br>
 Where be the battels, where the shield and speare,<br>
 And all the conquests, which them high did reare,<br>
 That matter made for famous Poets verse,<br>
 And boastfull men so oft abasht to heare?<br>
 Bene they all dead, and laid in dolefull herse?<br>
 Or doen they onely sleepe, and shall againe reuerse?<p>
 
 If they be dead, then woe is me therefore:<br>
 But if they sleepe, ô let them soone awake:<br>
 For all too long I burne with enuy sore,<br>
 To heare the warlike feates, which <i>Homere</i> spake<br>
 Of bold <i>Penthesilee</i>, which made a lake<br>
 Of <i>Greekish</i> bloud so oft in <i>Troian</i> plaine;<br>
 But when I read, how stout <i>Debora</i> strake<br>
 Proud <i>Sisera</i>, and how <i>Camill'</i> hath slaine<br>
 The huge <i>Orsilochus</i>, I swell with great disdaine.</p><p>
 
 Yet these, and all that else had puissaunce,<br>
 Cannot with noble <i>Britomart</i> compare,<br>
 Aswell for glory of great valiaunce,<br>
 As for pure chastitie and vertue rare,<br>
 That all her goodly deeds do well declare.<br>
 Well worthy stock, from which the branches sprong,<br>
 That in late yeares so faire a blossome bare,<br>
 As thee, ô Queene, the matter of my song,<br>
 Whose lignage from this Lady I deriue along.</p><p>
 
 Who when through speaches with the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight,<br>
 She learned had th'estate of <i>Arthegall</i>,<br>
 And in each point her selfe informd aright,<br>
 A friendly league of loue perpetuall<br>
 She with him bound, and <i>Congé</i> tooke withall.<br>
 Then he forth on his iourney did proceede,<br>
 To seeke aduentures, which mote him befall,<br>
 And win him worship through his warlike deed,<br>
 Which alwayes of his paines he made the chiefest meed.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Britomart</i> kept on her former course,<br>
 Ne euer dofte her armes, but all the way<br>
 Grew pensiue through that amorous discourse,<br>
 By which the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight did earst display<br>
 Her louers shape, and cheualrous aray;<br>
 A thousand thoughts she fashioned in her mind,<br>
 And in her feigning fancie did pourtray<br>
 Him such, as fittest she for loue could find,<br>
 Wise, warlike, personable, curteous, and kind.</p><p>
 
 With such selfe-pleasing thoughts her wound she fed,<br>
 And thought so to beguile her grieuous smart;<br>
 But so her smart was much more grieuous bred,<br>
 And the deepe wound more deepe engord her hart,<br>
 That nought but death her dolour mote depart.<br>
 So forth she rode without repose or rest,<br>
 Searching all lands and each remotest part,<br>
 Following the guidaunce of her blinded guest,<br>
 Till that to the sea-coast at length she her addrest.</p><p>
 
 There she alighted from her light-foot beast,<br>
 And sitting downe vpon the rocky shore,<br>
 Bad her old Squire vnlace her lofty creast;<br>
 Tho hauing vewd a while the surges hore,<br>
 That gainst the craggy clifts did loudly rore,<br>
 And in their raging surquedry disdaynd,<br>
 That the fast earth affronted them so sore,<br>
 And their deuouring couetize restraynd,<br>
 Thereat she sighed deepe, and after thus complaynd.</p><p>
 
 Huge sea of sorrow, and tempestuous griefe,<br>
 Wherein my feeble barke is tossed long,<br>
 Far from the hoped hauen of reliefe,<br>
 Why do thy cruell billowes beat so strong,<br>
 And thy moyst mountaines each on others throng,<br>
 Threatning to swallow vp my fearefull life?<br>
 O do thy cruell wrath and spightfull wrong<br>
 At length allay, and stint thy stormy strife,<br>
 Which in these troubled bowels raignes, &amp; rageth rife.</p><p>
 
 For else my feeble vessell crazd, and crackt<br>
 Through thy strong buffets and outrageous blowes,<br>
 Cannot endure, but needs it must be wrackt<br>
 On the rough rocks, or on the sandy shallowes,<br>
 The whiles that loue it steres, and fortune rowes;<br>
 Loue my lewd Pilot hath a restlesse mind<br>
 And fortune Boteswaine no assuraunce knowes,<br>
 But saile withouten starres gainst tide and wind:<br>
 How can they other do, sith both are bold and blind?</p><p>
 
 Thou God of winds, that raignest in the seas,<br>
 That raignest also in the Continent,<br>
 At last blow vp some gentle gale of ease,<br>
 The which may bring my ship, ere it be rent,<br>
 Vnto the gladsome port of her intent:<br>
 Then when I shall my selfe in safety see,<br>
 A table for eternall moniment<br>
 Of thy great grace, and my great ieopardee,<br>
 Great <i>Neptune</i>, I auow to hallow vnto thee.</p><p>
 
 Then sighing softly sore, and inly deepe,<br>
 She shut vp all her plaint in priuy griefe;<br>
 For her great courage would not let her weepe,<br>
 Till that old <i>Glauce</i> gan with sharpe repriefe,<br>
 Her to restraine, and giue her good reliefe,<br>
 Through hope of those, which <i>Merlin</i> had her told<br>
 Should of her name and nation be chiefe,<br>
 And fetch their being from the sacred mould<br>
 Of her immortall wombe, to be in heauen enrold.</p><p>
 
 Thus as she her recomforted, she spyde,<br>
 Where farre away one all in armour bright,<br>
 With hastie gallop towards her did ryde;<br>
 Her dolour soone she ceast, and on her dight<br>
 Her Helmet, to her Courser mounting light:<br>
 Her former sorrow into suddein wrath,<br>
 Both coosen passions of distroubled spright,<br>
 Conuerting, forth she beates the dustie path;<br>
 Loue and despight attonce her courage kindled hath.</p><p>
 
 As when a foggy mist hath ouercast<br>
 The face of heauen, and the cleare aire engrost,<br>
 The world in darkenesse dwels, till that at last<br>
 The watry Southwinde from the seabord cost<br>
 Vpblowing, doth disperse the vapour lo'st,<br>
 And poures it selfe forth in a stormy showre;<br>
 So the faire <i>Britomart</i> hauing disclo'st<br>
 Her clowdy care into a wrathfull stowre,<br>
 The mist of griefe dissolu'd, did into vengeance powre.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones her goodly shield addressing faire,<br>
 That mortall speare she in her hand did take,<br>
 And vnto battell did her selfe prepaire.<br>
 The knight approching, sternely her bespake;<br>
 Sir knight, that doest thy voyage rashly make<br>
 By this forbidden way in my despight,<br>
 Ne doest by others death ensample take,<br>
 I read thee soone retyre, whiles thou hast might,<br>
 Least afterwards it be too late to take thy flight.</p><p>
 
 Ythrild with deepe disdaine of his proud threat,<br>
 She shortly thus; Fly they, that need to fly;<br>
 Words fearen babes. I meane not thee entreat<br>
 To passe; but maugre thee will passe or dy.<br>
 Ne lenger stayd for th'other to reply,<br>
 But with sharpe speare the rest made dearly knowne.<br>
 Strongly the straunge knight ran, and sturdily<br>
 Strooke her full on the brest, that made her downe<br>
 Decline her head, &amp; touch her crouper with her crowne.</p><p>
 
 But she againe him in the shield did smite,<br>
 With so fierce furie and great puissaunce,<br>
 That through his threesquare scuchin percing quite,<br>
 And through his mayled hauberque, by mischaunce<br>
 The wicked steele through his left side did glaunce;<br>
 Him so transfixed she before her bore<br>
 Beyond his croupe, the length of all her launce,<br>
 Till sadly soucing on the sandie shore,<br>
 He tombled on an heape, and wallowd in his gore.</p><p>
 
 Like as the sacred Oxe, that carelesse stands,<br>
 With gilden hornes, and flowry girlonds crownd,<br>
 Proud of his dying honor and deare bands,<br>
 Whiles th'altars fume with frankincense arownd,<br>
 All suddenly with mortall stroke astownd,<br>
 Doth groueling fall, and with his streaming gore<br>
 Distaines the pillours, and the holy grownd,<br>
 And the faire flowres, that decked him afore;<br>
 So fell proud <i>Marinell</i> vpon the pretious shore.</p><p>
 
 The martiall Mayd stayd not him to lament,<br>
 But forward rode, and kept her readie way<br>
 Along the strond, which as she ouer-went,<br>
 She saw bestrowed all with rich aray<br>
 Of pearles and pretious stones of great assay,<br>
 And all the grauell mixt with golden owre;<br>
 Whereat she wondred much, but would not stay<br>
 For gold, or perles, or pretious stones an howre,<br>
 But them despised all; for all was in her powre.</p><p>
 
 Whiles thus he lay in deadly stonishment,<br>
 Tydings hereof came to his mothers eare;<br>
 His mother was the blacke-browd <i>Cymoent</i>,<br>
 The daughter of great <i>Nereus</i>, which did beare<br>
 This warlike sonne vnto an earthly peare,<br>
 The famous <i>Dumarin</i>; who on a day<br>
 Finding the Nymph a sleepe in secret wheare,<br>
 As he by chaunce did wander that same way,<br>
 Was taken with her loue, and by her closely lay.</p><p>
 
 There he this knight of her begot, whom borne<br>
 She of his father <i>Marinell</i> did name,<br>
 And in a rocky caue as wight forlorne,<br>
 Long time she fostred vp, till he became<br>
 A mightie man at armes, and mickle fame<br>
 Did get through great aduentures by him donne:<br>
 For neuer man he suffred by that same<br>
 <i>Rich strond</i> to trauell, whereas he did wonne,<br>
 But that he must do battell with the Sea-nymphes sonne.</p><p>
 
 An hundred knights of honorable name<br>
 He had subdew'd and them his vassals made,<br>
 That through all Farie lond his noble fame<br>
 Now blazed was, and feare did all inuade,<br>
 That none durst passen through that perilous glade.<br>
 And to aduance his name and glorie more,<br>
 Her Sea-god syre she dearely did perswade,<br>
 T'endow her sonne with threasure and rich store,<br>
 Boue all the sonnes, that were of earthly wombes ybore.</p><p>
 
 The God did graunt his daughters deare demaund,<br>
 To doen his Nephew in all riches flow;<br>
 Eftsoones his heaped waues he did commaund,<br>
 Out of their hollow bosome forth to throw<br>
 All the huge threasure, which the sea below<br>
 Had in his greedie gulfe deuoured deepe,<br>
 And him enriched through the ouerthrow<br>
 And wreckes of many wretches, which did weepe,<br>
 And often waile their wealth, which he from them did keepe.</p><p>
 
 Shortly vpon that shore there heaped was,<br>
 Exceeding riches and all pretious things,<br>
 The spoyle of all the world, that it did pas<br>
 The wealth of th'East, and pompe of <i>Persian</i> kings;<br>
 Gold, amber, yuorie, perles, owches, rings,<br>
 And all that else was pretious and deare,<br>
 The sea vnto him voluntary brings,<br>
 That shortly he a great Lord did appeare,<br>
 As was in all the lond of Faery, or elsewheare.</p><p>
 
 Thereto he was a doughtie dreaded knight,<br>
 Tryde often to the scath of many deare,<br>
 That none in equall armes him matchen might,<br>
 The which his mother seeing, gan to feare<br>
 Least his too haughtie hardines might reare<br>
 Some hard mishap, in hazard of his life:<br>
 For thy she oft him counseld to forbeare<br>
 The bloudie battell, and to stirre vp strife,<br>
 But after all his warre, to rest his wearie knife.</p><p>
 
 And for his more assurance, she inquir'd<br>
 One day of <i>Proteus</i> by his mightie spell,<br>
 (For <i>Proteus</i> was with prophecie inspir'd)<br>
 Her deare sonnes destinie to her to tell,<br>
 And the sad end of her sweet <i>Marinell</i>.<br>
 Who through foresight of his eternall skill,<br>
 Bad her from womankind to keepe him well:<br>
 For of a woman he should haue much ill,<br>
 A virgin strange and stout him should dismay, or kill.</p><p>
 
 For thy she gaue him warning euery day,<br>
 The loue of women not to entertaine;<br>
 A lesson too too hard for liuing clay,<br>
 From loue in course of nature to refraine:<br>
 Yet he his mothers lore did well retaine,<br>
 And euer from faire Ladies loue did fly;<br>
 Yet many Ladies faire did oft complaine,<br>
 That they for loue of him would algates dy:<br>
 Dy, who so list for him, he was loues enimy.</p><p>
 
 But ah, who can deceiue his destiny,<br>
 Or weene by warning to auoyd his fate?<br>
 That when he sleepes in most security,<br>
 And safest seemes, him soonest doth amate,<br>
 And findeth dew effect or soone or late.<br>
 So feeble is the powre of fleshly arme.<br>
 His mother bad him womens loue to hate,<br>
 For she of womans force did feare no harme;<br>
 So weening to haue arm'd him, she did quite disarme.</p><p>
 
 This was that woman, this that deadly wound,<br>
 That <i>Proteus</i> prophecide should him dismay,<br>
 The which his mother vainely did expound,<br>
 To be hart-wounding loue, which should assay<br>
 To bring her sonne vnto his last decay.<br>
 So tickle be the termes of mortall state,<br>
 And full of subtile sophismes, which do play<br>
 With double senses, and with false debate,<br>
 T'approue the vnknowen purpose of eternall fate.</p><p>
 
 Too true the famous <i>Marinell</i> it fownd,<br>
 Who through late triall, on that wealthy Strond<br>
 Inglorious now lies in senselesse swownd,<br>
 Through heauy stroke of <i>Britomartis</i> hond.<br>
 Which when his mother deare did vnderstond,<br>
 And heauy tydings heard, whereas she playd<br>
 Amongst her watry sisters by a pond,<br>
 Gathering sweet daffadillyes, to haue made<br>
 Gay girlonds, from the Sun their forheads faire to shade.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones both flowres and girlonds farre away<br>
 She flong, and her faire deawy lockes yrent,<br>
 To sorrow huge she turnd her former play,<br>
 And gamesom merth to grieuous dreriment:<br>
 She threw her selfe downe on the Continent,<br>
 Ne word did speake, but lay as in a swowne,<br>
 Whiles all her sisters did for her lament,<br>
 With yelling outcries, and with shrieking sowne;<br>
 And euery one did teare her girlond from her crowne.</p><p>
 
 Soone as she vp out of her deadly fit<br>
 Arose, she bad her charet to be brought,<br>
 And all her sisters, that with her did sit,<br>
 Bad eke attonce their charets to be sought;<br>
 Tho full of bitter griefe and pensiue thought,<br>
 She to her wagon clombe; clombe all the rest,<br>
 And forth together went, with sorrow fraught.<br>
 The waues obedient to their beheast,<br>
 Them yielded readie passage, and their rage surceast.</p><p>
 
 Great <i>Neptune</i> stood amazed at their sight,<br>
 Whiles on his broad round backe they softly slid<br>
 And eke himselfe mournd at their mournfull plight,<br>
 Yet wist not what their wailing ment, yet did<br>
 For great compassion of their sorrow, bid<br>
 His mightie waters to them buxome bee;<br>
 Eftsoones the roaring billowes still abid,<br>
 And all the griesly Monsters of the See<br>
 Stood gaping at their gate, and wondred them to see.</p><p>
 
 A teme of Dolphins raunged in aray,<br>
 Drew the smooth charet of sad <i>Cymoent</i>;<br>
 They were all taught by <i>Triton</i>, to obay<br>
 To the long raynes, at her commaundement:<br>
 As swift as swallowes, on the waues they went,<br>
 That their broad flaggie finnes no fome did reare,<br>
 Ne bubbling roundell they behind them sent;<br>
 The rest of other fishes drawen weare,<br>
 Which with their finny oars the swelling sea did sheare.</p><p>
 
 Soone as they bene arriu'd vpon the brim<br>
 Of the <i>Rich strond</i>, their charets they forlore,<br>
 And let their temed fishes softly swim<br>
 Along the margent of the fomy shore,<br>
 Least they their finnes should bruze, and surbate sore<br>
 Their tender feet vpon the stony ground:<br>
 And comming to the place, where all in gore<br>
 And cruddy bloud enwallowed they found<br>
 The lucklesse <i>Marinell</i>, lying in deadly swound;</p><p>
 
 His mother swowned thrise, and the third time<br>
 Could scarce recouered be out of her paine;<br>
 Had she not bene deuoyd of mortall slime,<br>
 She should not then haue bene reliu'd againe,<br>
 But soone as life recouered had the raine,<br>
 She made so piteous mone and deare wayment,<br>
 That the hard rocks could scarse from teares refraine,<br>
 And all her sister Nymphes with one consent<br>
 Supplide her sobbing breaches with sad complement.</p><p>
 
 Deare image of my selfe (she said) that is,<br>
 The wretched sonne of wretched mother borne,<br>
 Is this thine high aduauncement, ô is this<br>
 Th'immortall name, with which thee yet vnborne<br>
 Thy Gransire <i>Nereus</i> promist to adorne?<br>
 Now lyest thou of life and honor reft;<br>
 Now lyest thou a lumpe of earth forlorne,<br>
 Ne of thy late life memory is left,<br>
 Ne can thy irreuocable destiny be weft?</p><p>
 
 Fond <i>Proteus</i>, father of false prophecis,<br>
 And they more fond, that credit to thee giue,<br>
 Not this the worke of womans hand ywis,<br>
 That so deepe wound through these deare members driue.<br>
 I feared loue: but they that loue do liue,<br>
 But they that die, doe neither loue nor hate.<br>
 Nath'lesse to thee thy folly I forgiue,<br>
 And to my selfe, and to accursed fate<br>
 The guilt I doe ascribe: deare wisedome bought too late.</p><p>
 
 O what auailes it of immortall seed<br>
 To beene ybred and neuer borne to die?<br>
 Farre better I it deeme to die with speed,<br>
 Then waste in woe and wailefull miserie.<br>
 Who dyes the vtmost dolour doth abye,<br>
 But who that liues, is left to waile his losse:<br>
 So life is losse, and death felicitie.<br>
 Sad life worse then glad death: and greater crosse<br>
 To see friends graue, thẽ dead the graue selfe to engrosse.</p><p>
 
 But if the heauens did his dayes enuie,<br>
 And my short blisse maligne, yet mote they well<br>
 Thus much afford me, ere that he did die<br>
 That the dim eyes of my deare <i>Marinell</i><br>
 I mote haue closed, and him bed farewell,<br>
 Sith other offices for mother meet<br>
 They would not graunt.<br>
 Yet maulgre them farewell, my sweetest sweet;<br>
 Farewell my sweetest sonne, sith we no more shall meet.</p><p>
 
 Thus when they all had sorrowed their fill,<br>
 They softly gan to search his griesly wound:<br>
 And that they might him handle more at will,<br>
 They him disarm'd, and spredding on the ground<br>
 Their watchet mantles frindgd with siluer round,<br>
 They softly wipt away the gelly blood<br>
 From th'orifice; which hauing well vpbound,<br>
 They pourd in soueraine balme, and Nectar good,<br>
 Good both for earthly med'cine, and for heauenly food.</p><p>
 
 Tho when the lilly handed <i>Liagore</i>,<br>
 (This <i>Liagore</i> whylome had learned skill<br>
 In leaches craft, by great <i>Appolloes</i> lore,<br>
 Sith her whylome vpon high <i>Pindus</i> hill,<br>
 He loued, and at last her wombe did fill<br>
 With heauenly seed, whereof wise <i>Pæon</i> sprong)<br>
 Did feele his pulse, she knew their staied still<br>
 Some litle life his feeble sprites emong;<br>
 Which to his mother told, despeire she from her flong.</p><p>
 
 Tho vp him taking in their tender hands,<br>
 They easily vnto her charet beare:<br>
 Her teme at her commaundement quiet stands,<br>
 Whiles they the corse into her wagon reare,<br>
 And strow with flowres the lamentable beare:<br>
 Then all the rest into their coches clim,<br>
 And through the brackish waues their passage sheare;<br>
 Vpon great <i>Neptunes</i> necke they softly swim,<br>
 And to her watry chamber swiftly carry him.</p><p>
 
 Deepe in the bottome of the sea, her bowre<br>
 Is built of hollow billowes heaped hye,<br>
 Like to thicke cloudes, that threat a stormy showre,<br>
 And vauted all within, like to the sky,<br>
 In which the Gods do dwell eternally:<br>
 There they him laid in easie couch well dight;<br>
 And sent in haste for <i>Tryphon</i>, to apply<br>
 Salues to his wounds, and medicines of might:<br>
 For <i>Tryphon</i> of sea gods the soueraine leach is hight.</p><p>
 
 The whiles the <i>Nymphes</i> sit all about him round,<br>
 Lamenting his mishap and heauy plight;<br>
 And oft his mother vewing his wide wound,<br>
 Cursed the hand, that did so deadly smight<br>
 Her dearest sonne, her dearest harts delight.<br>
 But none of all those curses ouertooke<br>
 The warlike Maid, th'ensample of that might,<br>
 But fairely well she thriu'd, and well did brooke<br>
 Her noble deeds, ne her right course for ought forsooke.</p><p>
 
 Yet did false <i>Archimage</i> her still pursew,<br>
 To bring to passe his mischieuous intent,<br>
 Now that he had her singled from the crew<br>
 Of courteous knights, the Prince, and Faery gent,<br>
 Whom late in chace of beautie excellent<br>
 She left, pursewing that same foster strong;<br>
 Of whose foule outrage they impatient,<br>
 And full of fiery zeale, him followed long,<br>
 To reskew her from shame, and to reuenge her wrong.</p><p>
 
 Through thick and thin, through mountaines &amp; through plains,<br>
 Those two great chãpions did attonce pursew<br>
 The fearefull damzell, with incessant paines:<br>
 Who from them fled, as light-foot hare from vew<br>
 Of hunter swift, and sent of houndes trew.<br>
 At last they came vnto a double way,<br>
 Where, doubtfull which to take, her to reskew,<br>
 Themselues they did dispart, each to assay,<br>
 Whether more happie were, to win so goodly pray.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Timias</i>, the Princes gentle Squire,<br>
 That Ladies loue vnto his Lord forlent,<br>
 And with proud enuy, and indignant ire,<br>
 After that wicked foster fiercely went.<br>
 So beene they three three sundry wayes ybent.<br>
 But fairest fortune to the Prince befell,<br>
 Whose chaunce it was, that soone he did repent,<br>
 To take that way, in which that Damozell<br>
 Was fled afore, affraid of him, as feend of hell.</p><p>
 
 At last of her farre off he gained vew:<br>
 Then gan he freshly pricke his fomy steed,<br>
 And euer as he nigher to her drew,<br>
 So euermore he did increase his speed,<br>
 And of each turning still kept warie heed:<br>
 Aloud to her he oftentimes did call,<br>
 To doe away vaine doubt, and needlesse dreed:<br>
 Full myld to her he spake, and oft let fall<br>
 Many meeke wordes, to stay and comfort her withall.</p><p>
 
 But nothing might relent her hastie flight;<br>
 So deepe the deadly feare of that foule swaine<br>
 Was earst impressed in her gentle spright:<br>
 Like as a fearefull Doue, which through the raine,<br>
 Of the wide aire her way does cut amaine,<br>
 Hauing farre off espyde a Tassell gent,<br>
 Which after her his nimble wings doth straine,<br>
 Doubleth her haste for feare to be for-hent,<br>
 And with her pineons cleaues the liquid firmament.</p><p>
 
 With no lesse haste, and eke with no lesse dreed,<br>
 That fearefull Ladie fled from him, that ment<br>
 To her no euill thought, nor euill deed;<br>
 Yet former feare of being fowly shent,<br>
 Carried her forward with her first intent:<br>
 And though oft looking backward, well she vewd,<br>
 Her selfe freed from that foster insolent,<br>
 And that it was a knight, which now her sewd,<br>
 Yet she no lesse the knight feard, then that villein rude.</p><p>
 
 His vncouth shield and straunge armes her dismayd,<br>
 Whose like in Faery lond were seldome seene,<br>
 That fast she from him fled, no lesse affrayd,<br>
 Then of wilde beastes if she had chased beene:<br>
 Yet he her followd still with courage keene,<br>
 So long that now the golden <i>Hesperus</i><br>
 Was mounted high in top of heauen sheene,<br>
 And warnd his other brethren ioyeous,<br>
 To light their blessed lamps in <i>Ioues</i> eternall hous.</p><p>
 
 All suddenly dim woxe the dampish ayre,<br>
 And griesly shadowes couered heauen bright,<br>
 That now with thousand starres was decked fayre;<br>
 Which when the Prince beheld, a lothfull sight,<br>
 And that perforce, for want of lenger light,<br>
 He mote surcease his suit, and lose the hope<br>
 Of his long labour, he gan fowly wyte<br>
 His wicked fortune, that had turnd aslope,<br>
 And cursed night, that reft from him so goodly scope.</p><p>
 
 Tho when her wayes he could no more descry,<br>
 But to and fro at disauenture strayd;<br>
 Like as a ship, whose Lodestarre suddenly<br>
 Couered with cloudes, her Pilot hath dismayd;<br>
 His wearisome pursuit perforce he stayd,<br>
 And from his loftie steed dismounting low,<br>
 Did let him forage.  Downe himselfe he layd<br>
 Vpon the grassie ground, to sleepe a throw;<br>
 The cold earth was his couch, the hard steele his pillow.</p><p>
 
 But gentle Sleepe enuyde him any rest;<br>
 In stead thereof sad sorrow, and disdaine<br>
 Of his hard hap did vexe his noble brest,<br>
 And thousand fancies bet his idle braine<br>
 With their light wings, the sights of semblants vaine:<br>
 Oft did he wish, that Lady faire mote bee<br>
 His Faery Queene, for whom he did complaine:<br>
 Or that his Faery Queene were such, as shee:<br>
 And euer hastie Night he blamed bitterlie.</p><p>
 
 Night thou foule Mother of annoyance sad,<br>
 Sister of heauie death, and nourse of woe,<br>
 Which wast begot in heauen, but for thy bad<br>
 And brutish shape thrust downe to hell below,<br>
 Where by the grim floud of <i>Cocytus</i> slow<br>
 Thy dwelling is, in <i>Herebus</i> blacke hous,<br>
 (Blacke <i>Herebus</i> thy husband is the foe<br>
 Of all the Gods) where thou vngratious,<br>
 Halfe of thy dayes doest lead in horrour hideous.</p><p>
 
 What had th'eternall Maker need of thee,<br>
 The world in his continuall course to keepe,<br>
 That doest all things deface, ne lettest see<br>
 The beautie of his worke?  Indeed in sleepe<br>
 The slouthfull bodie, that doth loue to steepe<br>
 His lustlesse limbes, and drowne his baser mind,<br>
 Doth praise thee oft, and oft from <i>Stygian</i> deepe<br>
 Calles thee, his goddesse in his error blind,<br>
 And great Dame Natures handmaide, chearing euery kind.</p><p>
 
 But well I wote, that to an heauy hart<br>
 Thou art the root and nurse of bitter cares,<br>
 Breeder of new, renewer of old smarts:<br>
 In stead of rest thou lendest rayling teares,<br>
 In stead of sleepe thou sendest troublous feares,<br>
 And dreadfull visions, in the which aliue<br>
 The drearie image of sad death appeares:<br>
 So from the wearie spirit thou doest driue<br>
 Desired rest, and men of happinesse depriue.</p><p>
 
 Vnder thy mantle blacke there hidden lye,<br>
 Light-shonning theft, and traiterous intent,<br>
 Abhorred bloudshed, and vile felony,<br>
 Shamefull deceipt, and daunger imminent;<br>
 Foule horror, and eke hellish dreriment:<br>
 All these I wote in thy protection bee,<br>
 And light doe shonne, for feare of being shent:<br>
 For light ylike is loth'd of them and thee,<br>
 And all that lewdnesse loue, doe hate the light to see.</p><p>
 
 For day discouers all dishonest wayes,<br>
 And sheweth each thing, as it is indeed:<br>
 The prayses of high God he faire displayes,<br>
 And his large bountie rightly doth areed.<br>
 Dayes dearest children be the blessed seed,<br>
 Which darknesse shall subdew, and heauen win;<br>
 Truth is his daughter; he her first did breed,<br>
 Most sacred virgin, without spot of sin.<br>
 Our life is day, but death with darknesse doth begin.</p><p>
 
 O when will day then turne to me againe,<br>
 And bring with him his long expected light?<br>
 O <i>Titan</i>, haste to reare thy ioyous waine:<br>
 Speed thee to spred abroad thy beames bright?<br>
 And chase away this too long lingring night,<br>
 Chase her away, from whence she came, to hell.<br>
 She, she it is, that hath me done despight:<br>
 There let her with the damned spirits dwell,<br>
 And yeeld her roome to day, that can it gouerne well.</p><p>
 
 Thus did the Prince that wearie night outweare,<br>
 In restlesse anguish and vnquiet paine:<br>
 And earely, ere the morrow did vpreare<br>
 His deawy head out of the <i>Ocean</i> maine,<br>
 He vp arose, as halfe in great disdaine,<br>
 And clombe vnto his steed.  So forth he went,<br>
 With heauie looke and lumpish pace, that plaine<br>
 In him bewraid great grudge and maltalent:<br>
 His steed eke seem'd t'apply his steps to his intent.</p><p>
