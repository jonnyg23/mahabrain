 </p><blockquote> 
 <i>The Redcrosse knight is captiue made<br>
 By Gyaunt proud opprest,<br> 
 Prince Arthur meets with Vna great-<br> 
 ly with those newes distrest. </i><p> 
 </p></blockquote> 
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>     
 WHat man so wise, what earthly wit so ware,<br>
 As to descry the crafty cunning traine,<br>
 By which deceipt doth maske in visour faire,<br>
 And cast her colours dyed deepe in graine,<br>
 To seeme like Truth, whose shape she well can faine,<br>
 And fitting gestures to her purpose frame;<br>
 The guiltlesse man with guile to entertaine?<br>
 Great maistresse of her art was that false Dame,<br>
 The false <i>Duessa</i>, cloked with <i>Fidessaes</i> name.<p>
  
 Who when returning from the drery <i>Night</i>,<br>
 She fownd not in that perilous house of <i>Pryde</i>,<br>
 Where she had left, the noble <i>Redcrosse</i> knight,<br>
 Her hoped pray, she would no lenger bide,<br>
 But forth she went, to seeke him far and wide.<br>
 Ere long she fownd, whereas he wearie sate,<br>
 To rest him selfe, foreby a fountaine side,<br>
 Disarmed all of yron-coted Plate,<br>
 And by his side his steed the grassy forage ate.</p><p>
  
 He feedes vpon the cooling shade, and bayes<br>
 His sweatie forehead in the breathing wind,<br>
 Which through the trẽbling leaues full gently playes<br>
 Wherein the cherefull birds of sundry kind<br>
 Do chaunt sweet musick, to delight his mind:<br>
 The Witch approching gan him fairely greet,<br>
 And with reproch of carelesnesse vnkind<br>
 Vpbrayd, for leauing her in place vnmeet,<br>
 With fowle words tempring faire, soure gall with hony sweet.</p><p>
  
 Vnkindnesse past, they gan of solace treat,<br>
 And bathe in pleasaunce of the ioyous shade,<br>
 Which shielded them against the boyling heat,<br>
 And with greene boughes decking a gloomy glade,<br>
 About the fountaine like a girlond made;<br>
 Whose bubbling waue did euer freshly well,<br>
 Ne euer would through feruent sommer fade:<br>
 The sacred Nymph, which therein wont to dwell,<br>
 Was out of <i>Dianes</i> fauour, as it then befell.</p><p>
  
 The cause was this: one day when <i>Phoebe</i> fayre<br>
 With all her band was following the chace,<br>
 This Nymph, quite tyr'd with heat of scorching ayre,<br>
 Sat downe to rest in middest of the race:<br>
 The goddesse wroth gan fowly her disgrace,<br>
 And bad the waters, which from her did flow,<br>
 Be such as she her selfe was then in place.<br>
 Thenceforth her waters waxed dull and slow,<br>
 And all that drunke thereof, did faint and feeble grow.</p><p>
  
 Hereof this gentle knight vnweeting was,<br>
 And lying downe vpon the sandie graile,<br>
 Drunke of the streame, as cleare as cristall glas;<br>
 Eftsoones his manly forces gan to faile,<br>
 And mightie strong was turnd to feeble fraile.<br>
 His chaunged powres at first them selues not felt,<br>
 Till crudled cold his corage gan assaile,<br>
 And chearefull bloud in faintnesse chill did melt,<br>
 Which like a feuer fit through all his body swelt.</p><p>
  
 Yet goodly court he made still to his Dame,<br>
 Pourd out in loosnesse on the grassy grownd,<br>
 Both carelesse of his health, and of his fame:<br>
 Till at the last he heard a dreadfull sownd,<br>
 Which through the wood loud bellowing, did rebownd,<br>
 That all the earth for terrour seemd to shake,<br>
 And trees did tremble. Th'Elfe therewith astownd,<br>
 Vpstarted lightly from his looser make,<br>
 And his vnready weapons gan in hand to take.</p><p>
  
 But ere he could his armour on him dight,<br>
 Or get his shield, his monstrous enimy<br>
 With sturdie steps came stalking in his sight,<br>
 An hideous Geant horrible and hye,<br>
 That with his talnesse seemd to threat the skye,<br>
 The ground eke groned vnder him for dreed;<br>
 His liuing like saw neuer liuing eye,<br>
 Ne durst behold: his stature did exceed<br>
 The hight of three the tallest sonnes of mortall seed.</p><p>
  
 The greatest Earth his vncouth mother was,<br>
 And blustring <i>AEolus</i> his boasted sire, <br>
 Who with his breath, which through the world doth pas,<br>
 Her hollow womb did secretly inspire,<br>
 And fild her hidden caues with stormie yre,<br>
 That she conceiu'd; and trebling the dew time,<br>
 In which the wombes of women do expire,<br>
 Brought forth this monstrous masse of earthly slime,<br>
 Puft vp with emptie wind, and fild with sinfull crime.</p><p>
  
 So growen great through arrogant delight<br>
 Of th'high descent, whereof he was yborne,<br>
 And through presumption of his matchlesse might,<br>
 All other powres and knighthood he did scorne.<br>
 Such now he marcheth to this man forlorne,<br>
 And left to losse: his stalking steps are stayde<br>
 Vpon a snaggy Oke, which he had torne<br>
 Out of his mothers bowelles, and it made<br>
 His mortall mace, wherewith his foemen he dismayde.</p><p>
  
 That when the knight he spide, he gan aduance<br>
 With huge force and insupportable mayne,<br>
 And towardes him with dreadfull fury praunce;<br>
 Who haplesse, and eke hopelesse, all in vaine<br>
 Did to him pace, sad battaile to darrayne,<br>
 Disarmd, disgrast, and inwardly dismayde,<br>
 And eke so faint in euery ioynt and vaine,<br>
 Through that fraile fountaine, which him feeble made,<br>
 That scarsely could he weeld his bootlesse single blade.</p><p>
  
 The Geaunt strooke so maynly mercilesse,<br>
 That could haue ouerthrowne a stony towre,<br>
 And were not heauenly grace, that him did blesse,<br>
 He had beene pouldred all, as thin as flowre:<br>
 But he was wary of that deadly stowre,<br>
 And lightly lept from vnderneath the blow:<br>
 Yet so exceeding was the villeins powre,<br>
 That with the wind it did him ouerthrow,<br>
 And all his sences stound, that still he lay full low.</p><p>
  
 As when that diuelish yron Engin wrought<br>
 In deepest Hell, and framd by <i>Furies</i> skill,<br>
 With windy Nitre and quick Sulphur fraught,<br>
 And ramd with bullet round, ordaind to kill,<br>
 Conceiueth fire, the heauens it doth fill<br>
 With thundring noyse, and all the ayre doth choke,<br>
 That none can breath, nor see, nor heare at will,<br>
 Through smouldry cloud of duskish stincking smoke,<br>
 That th'onely breath him daunts, who hath escapt the stroke.</p><p>
  
 So daunted when the Geaunt saw the knight,<br>
 His heauie hand he heaued vp on hye,<br>
 And him to dust thought to haue battred quight,<br>
 Vntill <i>Duessa</i> loud to him gan crye;<br>
 O great <i>Orgoglio</i>, greatest vnder skye,<br>
 O hold thy mortall hand for Ladies sake,<br>
 Hold for my sake, and do him not to dye,<br>
 But vanquisht thine eternall bondslaue make,<br>
 And me thy worthy meed vnto thy Leman take.</p><p>
  
 He hearkned, and did stay from further harmes,<br>
 To gayne so goodly guerdon, as she spake:<br>
 So willingly she came into his armes,<br>
 Who her as willingly to grace did take,<br>
 And was possessed of his new found make.<br>
 Then vp he tooke the slombred sencelesse corse,<br>
 And ere he could out of his swowne awake,<br>
 Him to his castle brought with hastie forse,<br>
 And in a Dongeon deepe him threw without remorse.</p><p>
  
 From that day forth <i>Duessa</i> was his deare,<br>
 And highly honourd in his haughtie eye,<br>
 He gaue her gold and purple pall to weare,<br>
 And triple crowne set on her head full hye,<br>
 And her endowd with royall maiestye:<br>
 Then for to make her dreaded more of men,<br>
 And peoples harts with awfull terrour tye,<br>
 A monstrous beast ybred in filthy fen<br>
 He chose, which he had kept long time in darksome den.</p><p>
  
 Such one it was, as that renowmed Snake<br>
 Which great <i>Alcides</i> in <i>Stremona</i> slew,<br>
 Long fostred in the filth of <i>Lerna</i> lake,<br>
 Whose many heads out budding euer new,<br>
 Did breed him endlesse labour to subdew:<br>
 But this same Monster much more vgly was;<br>
 For seuen great heads out of his body grew,<br>
 An yron brest, and backe of scaly bras,<br>
 And all embrewd in bloud, his eyes did shine as glas.</p><p>
  
 His tayle was stretched out in wondrous length,<br>
 That to the house of heauenly gods it raught,<br>
 And with extorted powre, and borrow'd strength,<br>
 The euer-burning lamps from thence it braught,<br>
 And prowdly threw to ground, as things of naught;<br>
 And vnderneath his filthy feet did tread<br>
 The sacred things, and holy heasts foretaught.<br>
 Vpon this dreadfull Beast with seuenfold head<br>
 He set the false <i>Duessa</i>, for more aw and dread.</p><p>
  
 The wofull Dwarfe, which saw his maisters fall,<br>
 Whiles he had keeping of his grasing steed,<br>
 And valiant knight become a caytiue thrall,<br>
 When all was past, tooke vp his forlorne weed,<br>
 His mightie armour, missing most at need;<br>
 His siluer shield, now idle maisterlesse;<br>
 His poynant speare, that many made to bleed,<br>
 The ruefull moniments of heauinesse,<br>
 And with them all departes, to tell his great distresse.</p><p>
  
 He had not trauaild long, when on the way<br>
 He wofull Ladie, wofull <i>Vna</i> met,<br>
 Fast flying from the Paynims greedy pray,<br>
 Whilest <i>Satyrane</i> him from pursuit did let:<br>
 Who when her eyes she on the Dwarf had set,<br>
 And saw the signes, that deadly tydings spake,<br>
 She fell to ground for sorrowfull regret,<br>
 And liuely breath her sad brest did forsake,<br>
 Yet might her pitteous hart be seene to pant and quake.</p><p>
  
 The messenger of so vnhappie newes<br>
 Would faine haue dyde: dead was his hart within,<br>
 Yet outwardly some little comfort shewes:<br>
 At last recouering hart, he does begin<br>
 To rub her temples, and to chaufe her chin,<br>
 And euery tender part does tosse and turne:<br>
 So hardly he the flitted life does win,<br>
 Vnto her natiue prison to retourne:<br>
 Then gins her grieued ghost thus to lament and mourne.</p><p>
  
 Ye dreary instruments of dolefull sight,<br>
 That doe this deadly spectacle behold,<br>
 Why do ye lenger feed on loathed light,<br>
 Or liking find to gaze on earthly mould,<br>
 Sith cruell fates the carefull threeds vnfould,<br>
 The which my life and loue together tyde?<br>
 Now let the stony dart of senselesse cold<br>
 Perce to my hart, and pas through euery side,<br>
 And let eternall night so sad [sight] fro me hide.</p><p>
  
 O lightsome day, the lampe of highest <i>Ioue</i>,<br>
 First made by him, mens wandring wayes to guyde,<br>
 When darknesse he in deepest dongeon droue,<br>
 Henceforth thy hated face for euer hyde,<br>
 And shut vp heauens windowes shyning wyde:<br>
 For earthly sight can nought but sorow breed,<br>
 And late repentance, which shall long abyde.<br>
 Mine eyes no more on vanitie shall feed,<br>
 But seeled vp with death, shall haue their deadly meed.</p><p>
  
 Then downe againe she fell vnto the ground;<br>
 But he her quickly reared vp againe:<br>
 Thrise did she sinke adowne in deadly swownd,<br>
 And thrise he her reviu'd with busie paine:<br>
 At last when life recouer'd had the raine,<br>
 And ouer-wrestled his strong enemie,<br>
 With foltring tong, and trembling euery vaine,<br>
 Tell on (quoth she) the wofull Tragedie,<br>
 The which these reliques sad present vnto mine eie.</p><p>
  
 Tempestuous fortune hath spent all her spight,<br>
 And thrilling sorrow throwne his vtmost dart;<br>
 Thy sad tongue cannot tell more heauy plight,<br>
 Then that I feele, and harbour in mine hart:<br>
 Who hath endur'd the whole, can beare each part.<br>
 If death it be, it is not the first wound,<br>
 That launched hath my brest with bleeding smart.<br>
 Begin, and end the bitter balefull stound;<br>
 If lesse, then that I feare, more fauour I haue found.</p><p>
  
 Then gan the Dwarfe the whole discourse declare,<br>
 The subtill traines of <i>Archimago</i> old;<br>
 The wanton loues of false <i>Fidessa</i> faire,<br>
 Bought with the bloud of vanquisht Paynim bold:<br>
 The wretched payre transform'd to treen mould;<br>
 The house of Pride, and perils round about;<br>
 The combat, which he with <i>Sansioy</i> did hould;<br>
 The lucklesse conflict with the Gyant stout,<br>
 Wherein captiu'd, of life or death he stood in doubt.</p><p>
  
 She heard with patience all vnto the end,<br>
 And stroue to maister sorrowfull assay,<br>
 Which greater grew, the more she did contend,<br>
 And almost rent her tender hart in tway;<br>
 And loue fresh coles vnto her fire did lay:<br>
 For greater loue, the greater is the losse.<br>
 Was neuer Ladie loued dearer day,<br>
 Then she did loue the knight of the <i>Redcrosse</i>;<br>
 For whose deare sake so many troubles her did tosse.</p><p>
  
 At last when feruent sorrow slaked was,<br>
 She vp arose, resoluing him to find<br>
 A liue or dead: and forward forth doth pas,<br>
 All as the Dwarfe the way to her assynd:<br>
 And euermore in constant carefull mind<br>
 She fed her wound with fresh renewed bale;<br>
 Long tost with stormes, and bet with bitter wind,<br>
 High ouer hils, and low adowne the dale,<br>
 She wandred many a wood, and measurd many a vale.</p><p>
  
 At last she chaunced by good hap to meet<br>
 A goodly knight, faire marching by the way<br>
 Together with his Squire, arayed meet:<br>
 His glitterand armour shined farre away,<br>
 Like glauncing light of <i>Phoebus</i> brightest ray;<br>
 From top to toe no place appeared bare,<br>
 That deadly dint of steele endanger may:<br>
 Athwart his brest a bauldrick braue he ware,<br>
 That shynd, like twinkling stars, with stons most pretious rare.</p><p>
  
 And in the midst thereof one pretious stone<br>
 Of wondrous worth, and eke of wondrous mights,<br>
 Shapt like a Ladies head, exceeding shone,<br>
 Like <i>Hesperus</i> emongst the lesser lights,<br>
 And stroue for to amaze the weaker sights;<br>
 Thereby his mortall blade full comely hong<br>
 In yuory sheath, ycaru'd with curious slights;<br>
 Whose hilts were burnisht gold, and handle strong<br>
 Of mother pearle, and buckled with a golden tong.</p><p>
  
 His haughtie helmet, horrid all with gold,<br>
 Both glorious brightnesse, and great terrour bred;<br>
 For all the crest a Dragon did enfold<br>
 With greedie pawes, and ouer all did spred<br>
 His golden wings: his dreadfull hideous hed<br>
 Close couched on the beuer, seem'd to throw<br>
 From flaming mouth bright sparkles fierie red,<br>
 That suddeine horror to faint harts did show;<br>
 And scaly tayle was stretcht adowne his backe full low.</p><p>
  
 Vpon the top of all his loftie crest,<br>
 A bunch of haires discolourd diuersly,<br>
 With sprincled pearle, and gold full richly drest,<br>
 Did shake, and seem'd to daunce for iollity,<br>
 Like to an Almond tree ymounted hye<br>
 On top of greene <i>Selinis</i> all alone,<br>
 With blossomes braue bedecked daintily;<br>
 Whose tender locks do tremble euery one<br>
 At euery little breath, that vnder heauen is blowne.</p><p>
  
 His warlike shield all closely couer'd was,<br>
 Ne might of mortall eye be euer seene;<br>
 Not made of steele, nor of enduring bras,<br>
 Such earthly mettals soone consumed bene:<br>
 But all of Diamond perfect pure and cleene<br>
 It framed was, one massie entire mould,<br>
 Hewen out of Adamant rocke with engines keene,<br>
 That point of speare it neuer percen could,<br>
 Ne dint of direfull sword diuide the substance would.</p><p>
  
 The same to wight he neuer wont disclose,<br>
 But when as monsters huge he would dismay,<br>
 Or daunt vnequall armies of his foes,<br>
 Or when the flying heauens he would affray;<br>
 For so exceeding shone his glistring ray,<br>
 That <i>Phoebus</i> golden face it did attaint,<br>
 As when a cloud his beames doth ouer-lay;<br>
 And siluer <i>Cynthia</i> wexed pale and faint,<br>
 As when her face is staynd with magicke arts constraint.</p><p>
  
 No magicke arts hereof had any might,<br>
 Nor bloudie wordes of bold Enchaunters call,<br>
 But all that was not such, as seemd in sight,<br>
 Before that shield did fade, and suddeine fall:<br>
 And when him list the raskall routes appall,<br>
 Men into stones therewith he could transmew,<br>
 And stones to dust, and dust to nought at all;<br>
 And when him list the prouder lookes subdew,<br>
 He would them gazing blind, or turne to other hew.</p><p>
  
 Ne let it seeme, that credence this exceedes,<br>
 For he that made the same, was knowne right well<br>
 To haue done much more admirable deedes.<br>
 It <i>Merlin</i> was, which whylome did excell<br>
 All liuing wightes in might of magicke spell:<br>
 Both shield, and sword, and armour all he wrought<br>
 For this young Prince, when first to armes he fell;<br>
 But when he dyde, the Faerie Queene it brought<br>
 To Faerie lond, where yet it may be seene, if sought.</p><p>
  
 A gentle youth, his dearely loued Squire<br>
 His speare of heben wood behind him bare,<br>
 Whose harmefull head, thrice heated in the fire,<br>
 Had riuen many a brest with pikehead square;<br>
 A goodly person, and could menage faire<br>
 His stubborne steed with curbed canon bit,<br>
 Who vnder him did trample as the aire,<br>
 And chauft, that any on his backe should sit;<br>
 The yron rowels into frothy fome he bit.</p><p>
  
 When as this knight nigh to the Ladie drew,<br>
 With louely court he gan her entertaine;<br>
 But when he heard her answeres loth, he knew<br>
 Some secret sorrow did her heart distraine:<br>
 Which to allay, and calme her storming paine,<br>
 Faire feeling words he wisely gan display,<br>
 And for her humour fitting purpose faine,<br>
 To tempt the cause it selfe for to bewray;<br>
 Wherewith emmou'd, these bleeding words she gan to say.</p><p>
  
 What worlds delight, or ioy of liuing speach<br>
 Can heart, so plung'd in sea of sorrowes deepe,<br>
 And heaped with so huge misfortunes, reach?<br>
 The carefull cold beginneth for to creepe,<br>
 And in my heart his yron arrow steepe,<br>
 Soone as I thinke vpon my bitter bale:<br>
 Such helplesse harmes yts better hidden keepe,<br>
 Then rip vp griefe, where it may not auaile,<br>
 My last left comfort is, my woes to weepe and waile.</p><p>
  
 Ah Ladie deare, quoth then the gentle knight,<br>
 Well may I weene, your griefe is wondrous great;<br>
 For wondrous great griefe groneth in my spright,<br>
 Whiles thus I heare you of your sorrowes treat.<br>
 But wofull Ladie let me you intrete,<br>
 For to vnfold the anguish of your hart:<br>
 Mishaps are maistred by aduice discrete,<br>
 And counsell mittigates the greatest smart;<br>
 Found neuer helpe, who neuer would his hurts impart.</p><p>
  
 O but (quoth she) great griefe will not be tould,<br>
 And can more easily be thought, then said.<br>
 Right so; (quoth he) but he, that neuer would,<br>
 Could neuer: will to might giues greatest aid.<br>
 But griefe (quoth she) does greater grow displaid,<br>
 If then it find not helpe, and breedes despaire.<br>
 Despaire breedes not (quoth he) where faith is staid.<br>
 No faith so fast (quoth she) but flesh does paire.<br>
 Flesh may empaire (quoth he) but reason can repaire.</p><p>
  
 His goodly reason, and well guided speach<br>
 So deepe did settle in her gratious thought,<br>
 That her perswaded to disclose the breach,<br>
 Which loue and fortune in her heart had wrought,<br>
 And said; faire Sir, I hope good hap hath brought<br>
 You to inquere the secrets of my griefe,<br>
 Or that your wisedome will direct my thought,<br>
 Or that your prowesse can me yield reliefe:<br>
 Then heare the storie sad, which I shall tell you briefe.</p><p>
  
 The forlorne Maiden, whom your eyes haue seene<br>
 The laughing stocke of fortunes mockeries,<br>
 Am th'only daughter of a King and Queene,<br>
 Whose parents deare, whilest equall destinies<br>
 Did runne about, and their felicities<br>
 The fauourable heauens did not enuy,<br>
 Did spread their rule through all the territories,<br>
 Which <i>Phison</i> and <i>Euphrates</i> floweth by,<br>
 And <i>Gehons</i> golden waues doe wash continually.</p><p>
  
 Till that their cruell cursed enemy,<br>
 An huge great Dragon horrible in sight,<br>
 Bred in the loathly lakes of <i>Tartary</i>,<br>
 With murdrous rauine, and deuouring might<br>
 Their kingdome spoild, and countrey wasted quight:<br>
 Themselues, for feare into his iawes to fall,<br>
 He forst to castle strong to take their flight,<br>
 Where fast embard in mightie brasen wall,<br>
 He has them now foure yeres besiegd to make thẽ thrall.</p><p>
  
 Full many knights aduenturous and stout<br>
 Haue enterprizd that Monster to subdew;<br>
 From euery coast that heauen walks about,<br>
 Haue thither come the noble Martiall crew,<br>
 That famous hard atchieuements still pursew,<br>
 Yet neuer any could that girlond win,<br>
 But all still shronke, and still he greater grew:<br>
 All they for want of faith, or guilt of sin,<br>
 The pitteous pray of his fierce crueltie haue bin.</p><p>
  
 At last yledd with farre reported praise,<br>
 Which flying fame throughout the world had spred,<br>
 Of doughtie knights, whom Faery land did raise,<br>
 That noble order hight of Maidenhed,<br>
 Forthwith to court of <i>Gloriane</i> I sped,<br>
 Of <i>Gloriane</i> great Queene of glory bright,<br>
 Whose kingdomes seat <i>Cleopolis</i> is red,<br>
 There to obtaine some such redoubted knight,<br>
 That Parents deare from tyrants powre deliuer might.</p><p>
  
 It was my chance (my chance was faire and good)<br>
 There for to find a fresh vnproued knight,<br>
 Whose manly hands imbrew'd in guiltie blood<br>
 Had neuer bene, ne euer by his might<br>
 Had throwne to ground the vnregarded right:<br>
 Yet of his prowesse proofe he since hath made<br>
 (I witnesse am) in many a cruell fight;<br>
 The groning ghosts of many one dismaide<br>
 Haue felt the bitter dint of his auenging blade.</p><p>
  
 And ye the forlorne reliques of his powre,<br>
 His byting sword, and his deuouring speare,<br>
 Which haue endured many a dreadfull stowre,<br>
 Can speake his prowesse, that did earst you beare,<br>
 And well could rule: now he hath left you heare,<br>
 To be the record of his ruefull losse,<br>
 And of my dolefull disauenturous deare:<br>
 O heauie record of the good <i>Redcrosse</i>,<br>
 Where haue you left your Lord, that could so well you tosse?</p><p>
  
 Well hoped I, and faire beginnings had,<br>
 That he my captiue langour should redeeme,<br>
 Till all vnweeting, an Enchaunter bad<br>
 His sence abusd, and made him to misdeeme<br>
 My loyalty, not such as it did seeme;<br>
 That rather death desire, then such despight.<br>
 Be iudge ye heauens, that all things right esteeme,<br>
 How I him lou'd, and loue with all my might,<br>
 So thought I eke of him, and thinke I thought aright.</p><p>
  
 Thenceforth me desolate he quite forsooke,<br>
 To wander, where wilde fortune would me lead,<br>
 And other bywaies he himselfe betooke,<br>
 Where neuer foot of liuing wight did tread,<br>
 That brought not backe the balefull body dead;<br>
 In which him chaunced false <i>Duessa</i> meete,<br>
 Mine onely foe, mine onely deadly dread,<br>
 Who with her witchcraft and misseeming sweete,<br>
 Inueigled him to follow her desires vnmeete.</p><p>
  
 At last by subtill sleights she him betraid<br>
 Vnto his foe, a Gyant huge and tall,<br>
 Who him disarmed, dissolute, dismaid,<br>
 Vnwares surprised, and with mightie mall<br>
 The monster mercilesse him made to fall,<br>
 Whose fall did neuer foe before behold;<br>
 And now in darkesome dungeon, wretched thrall,<br>
 Remedilesse, for aie he doth him hold;<br>
 This is my cause of griefe, more great, then may be told.</p><p>
  
 Ere she had ended all, she gan to faint:<br>
 But he her comforted and faire bespake,<br>
 Certes, Madame, ye haue great cause of plaint,<br>
 That stoutest heart, I weene, could cause to quake.<br>
 But be of cheare, and comfort to you take:<br>
 For till I haue acquit your captiue knight,<br>
 Assure your selfe, I will you not forsake.<br>
 His chearefull words reuiu'd her chearelesse spright,<br>
 So forth they went, the Dwarfe them guiding euer right.</p><p>
