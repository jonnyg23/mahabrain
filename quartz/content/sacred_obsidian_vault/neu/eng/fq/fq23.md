 <i>A chronicle of Briton kings,<br>
 from Brute to Vthers rayne.<br>

 till time of Gloriane.</i><p>

 W
 Ho now shall giue vnto me words and sound,<br>
 Equall vnto this haughtie enterprise?<br>
 Or who shall lend me wings, with which from ground<br>
 Lowly verse may loftily arise,<br>
 And lift it selfe vnto the highest skies?<br>
 More ample spirit, then hitherto was wount,<br>
 Here needes me, whiles the famous auncestries<br>
 Of my most dreaded Soueraigne I recount,<br>
 By which all earthly Princes she doth farre surmount.<p>
  
 Ne vnder Sunne, that shines so wide and faire,<br>
 Whence all that liues, does borrow life and light,<br>
 Liues ought, that to her linage may compaire,<br>
 Which though from earth it be deriued right,<br>
 Yet doth it selfe stretch forth to heauens hight,<br>
 And all the world with wonder ouerspred;<br>
 A labour huge, exceeding farre my might:<br>
 How shall fraile pen, with feare disparaged,<br>
 Conceiue such soueraine glory, and great bountihed?</p><p>
  
 Argument worthy of <i>Moeonian</i> quill,<br>
 Or rather worthy of great <i>Phoebus</i> rote,<br>
 Whereon the ruines of great <i>Ossa</i> hill,<br>
 And triumphes of <i>Phlegræan Ioue</i> he wrote,<br>
 That all the Gods admird his loftie note.<br>
 But if some relish of that heauenly lay<br>
 His learned daughters would to me report,<br>
 To decke my song withall, I would assay,<br>
 Thy name, &amp;ocirc: soueraine Queene, to blazon farre away.</p><p>
  
 Thy name &amp;ocirc: soueraine Queene, thy realme and race,<br>
 From this renowmed Prince deriued arre,<br>
 Who mightily vpheld that royall mace,<br>
 Which now thou bear'st, to thee descended farre<br>
 From mightie kings and conquerours in warre,<br>
 Thy fathers and great Grandfathers of old,<br>
 Whose noble deedes aboue the Northerne starre<br>
 Immortall fame for euer hath enrold;<br>
 As in that old mans booke they were in order told.</p><p>
  
 The land, which warlike Britons now possesse,<br>
 And therein haue their mightie empire raysd,<br>
 In antique times was saluage wildernesse,<br>
 Vnpeopled, vnmanurd, vnprou'd, vnpraysd,<br>
 Ne was it Island then, ne was it paysd<br>
 Amid the <i>Ocean</i> waues, ne was it sought<br>
 Of marchants farre, for profits therein praysd,<br>
 But was all desolate, and of some thought<br>
 By sea to haue bene frõ the <i>Celticke</i> mayn-land brought.</p><p>
  
 Ne did it then deserue a name to haue,<br>
 Till that the venturous Mariner that way<br>
 Learning his ship from those white rocks to saue,<br>
 Which all along the Southerne sea-coast lay,<br>
 Threatning vnheedie wrecke and rash decay,<br>
 For safeties sake that same his sea-marke made,<br>
 And named it <i>Albion</i>.  But later day<br>
 Finding in it fit ports for fishers trade,<br>
 Gan more the same frequent, and further to inuade.</p><p>
  
 But farre in land a saluage nation dwelt,<br>
 Of hideous Giants, and halfe beastly men,<br>
 That neuer tasted grace, nor goodnesse felt,<br>
 But like wild beasts lurking in loathsome den,<br>
 And flying fast as Roebucke through the fen,<br>
 All naked without shame, or care of cold,<br>
 By hunting and by spoiling liued then;<br>
 Of stature huge, and eke of courage bold,<br>
 That sonnes of men amazd their sternnesse to behold.</p><p>
  
 But whence they sprong, or how they were begot,<br>
 Vneath is to assure; vneath to wene<br>
 That monstrous error, which doth some assot,<br>
 That <i>Dioclesians</i> fiftie daughters shene<br>
 Into this land by chaunce haue driuen bene,<br>
 Where companing with feends and filthy Sprights,<br>
 Through vaine illusion of their lust vnclene,<br>
 They brought forth Giants and such dreadfull wights,<br>
 As farre exceeded men in their immeasurd mights.</p><p>
  
 They held this land, and with their filthinesse<br>
 Polluted this same gentle soyle long time:<br>
 That their owne mother loathd their beastlinesse,<br>
 And gan abhorre her broods vnkindly crime,<br>
 All were they borne of her owne natiue slime,<br>
 Vntill that <i>Brutus</i> anciently deriu'd<br>
 From royall stocke of old <i>Assaracs</i> line,<br>
 Driuen by fatall error, here arriu'd,<br>
 And them of their vniust possession depriu'd.</p><p>
  
 But ere he had established his throne,<br>
 And spred his empire to the vtmost shore,<br>
 He fought great battels with his saluage fone;<br>
 In which he them defeated euermore,<br>
 And many Giants left on groning flore;<br>
 That well can witnesse yet vnto this day<br>
 The westerne Hogh, besprincled with the gore<br>
 Of mightie <i>Göemot</i>, whom in stout fray<br>
 <i>Corineus</i> conquered, and cruelly did slay.</p><p>
  
 And eke that ample Pit, yet farre renownd,<br>
 For the large leape, which <i>Debon</i> did compell<br>
 <i>Coulin</i> to make, being eight lugs of grownd;<br>
 Into the which returning backe, he fell:<br>
 But those three monstrous stones doe most excell<br>
 Which that huge sonne of hideous <i>Albion</i>,<br>
 Whose father <i>Hercules</i> in Fraunce did quell,<br>
 Great <i>Godmer</i> threw, in fierce contention,<br>
 At bold <i>Canutus</i>; but of him was slaine anon.</p><p>
  
 In meed of these great conquests by them got,<br>
 <i>Corineus</i> had that Prouince vtmost west,<br>
 To him assigned for his worthy lot,<br>
 Which of his name and memorable gest<br>
 He called <i>Cornewaile</i>, yet so called best:<br>
 And <i>Debons</i> shayre was, that is <i>Deuonshyre</i>:<br>
 But <i>Canute</i> had his portion from the rest,<br>
 The which he cald <i>Canutium</i>, for his hyre;<br>
 Now <i>Cantium</i>, which Kent we commenly inquire.</p><p>
  
 Thus <i>Brute</i> this Realme vnto his rule subdewd,<br>
 And raigned long in great felicitie,<br>
 Lou'd of his friends, and of his foes eschewd,<br>
 He left three sonnes, his famous progeny,<br>
 Borne of faire <i>Inogene</i> of <i>Italy</i>;<br>
 Mongst whom he parted his imperiall state,<br>
 And <i>Locrine</i> left chiefe Lord of <i>Britany</i>.<br>
 At last ripe age bad him surrender late<br>
 His life, and long good fortune vnto finall fate.</p><p>
  
 <i>Locrine</i> was left the soueraine Lord of all;<br>
 But <i>Albanact</i> had all the Northrene part,<br>
 Which of himselfe <i>Albania</i> he did call;<br>
 And <i>Camber</i> did possesse the Westerne quart,<br>
 Which <i>Seuerne</i> now from <i>Logris</i> doth depart:<br>
 And each his portion peaceably enioyd,<br>
 Ne was there outward breach, nor grudge in hart,<br>
 That once their quiet gouernment annoyd,<br>
 But each his paines to others profit still employd.</p><p>
  
 Vntill a nation straung, with visage swart,<br>
 And courage fierce, that all men did affray,<br>
 Which through the world thẽ swarmd in euery part,<br>
 And ouerflow'd all countries farre away,<br>
 Like <i>Noyes</i> great flood, with their importune sway,<br>
 This land inuaded with like violence,<br>
 And did themselues through all the North display:<br>
 Vntill that <i>Locrine</i> for his Realmes defence,<br>
 Did head against them make, and strong munificence.</p><p>
  
 He them encountred, a confused rout,<br>
 Foreby the Riuer, that whylome was hight<br>
 The auncient <i>Abus</i>, where with courage stout<br>
 He them defeated in victorious fight,<br>
 And chaste so fiercely after fearfull flight,<br>
 That forst their Chieftaine, for his safeties sake,<br>
 (Their Chieftaine <i>Humber</i> named was aright)<br>
 Vnto the mightie streame him to betake,<br>
 Where he an end of battell, and of life did make.</p><p>
  
 The king returned proud of victorie,<br>
 And insolent wox through vnwonted ease,<br>
 That shortly he forgot the ieopardie,<br>
 Which in his land he lately did appease,<br>
 And fell to vaine voluptuous disease:<br>
 He lou'd faire Ladie <i>Estrild</i>, lewdly lou'd,<br>
 Whose wanton pleasures him too much did please.<br>
 That quite his hart from <i>Guendolene</i> remou'd,<br>
 Frõ <i>Guendolene</i> his wife, though alwaies faithfull prou'd.</p><p>
  
 The noble daughter of <i>Corineus</i><br>
 Would not endure to be so vile disdaind,<br>
 But gathering force, and courage valorous,<br>
 Encountred him in battell well ordaind,<br>
 In which him vanquisht she to fly constraind:<br>
 But she so fast pursewd, that him she tooke,<br>
 And threw in bands, where he till death remaind;<br>
 Als his faire Leman, flying through a brooke,<br>
 She ouerhent, nought moued with her piteous looke.</p><p>
  
 But both her selfe, and eke her daughter deare,<br>
 Begotten by her kingly Paramoure,<br>
 The faire <i>Sabrina</i> almost dead with feare,<br>
 She there attached, farre from all succoure;<br>
 The one she slew in that impatient stoure,<br>
 But the sad virgin innocent of all,<br>
 Adowne the rolling riuer she did poure,<br>
 Which of her name now <i>Seuerne</i> men do call:<br>
 Such was the end, that to disloyall loue did fall.</p><p>
  
 Then for her sonne, which she to <i>Locrin</i> bore,<br>
 <i>Madan</i> was young, vnmeet the rule of sway,<br>
 In her owne hande the crowne she kept in store,<br>
 Till ryper yeares he raught, and stronger stay:<br>
 During which time her powre she did display<br>
 Through all this realme, the glorie of her sex,<br>
 And first taught men a woman to obay:<br>
 But when her sonne to mans estate did wex,<br>
 She it surrendred, ne her selfe would lenger vex.</p><p>
  
 Tho <i>Madan</i> raignd, vnworthie of his race:<br>
 For with all shame that sacred throne he fild:<br>
 Next <i>Memprise</i>, as vnworthy of that place,<br>
 In which being consorted with <i>Manild</i>,<br>
 For thirst of single kingdome him he kild.<br>
 But <i>Ebranck</i> salued both their infamies<br>
 With noble deedes, and warreyd on <i>Brunchild</i><br>
 In <i>Henault</i>, where yet of his victories<br>
 Braue moniments remaine, which yet that land enuies.</p><p>
  
 An happie man in his first dayes he was,<br>
 And happie father of faire progeny:<br>
 For all so many weekes as the yeare has,<br>
 So many children he did multiply;<br>
 Of which were twentie sonnes, which did apply,<br>
 Their minds to praise, and cheualrous desire:<br>
 Those germans did subdew all Germany,<br>
 Of whom it hight; but in the end their Sire<br>
 With foule repulse from Fraunce was forced to retire.</p><p>
  
 Which blot his sonne succeeding in his seat,<br>
 The second <i>Brute</i>, the second both in name,<br>
 And eke in semblance of his puissance great,<br>
 Right well recur'd, and did away that blame<br>
 With recompence of euerlasting fame.<br>
 He with his victour sword first opened,<br>
 The bowels of wide Fraunce, a forlorne Dame,<br>
 And taught her first how to be conquered;<br>
 Since which, with sundrie spoiles she hath beene ransacked.</p><p>
  
 Let <i>Scaldis</i> tell, and let tell <i>Hania</i>,<br>
 And let the marsh of <i>Estham bruges</i> tell,<br>
 What colour were their waters that same day,<br>
 And all the moore twixt <i>Eluersham</i> and <i>Dell</i>,<br>
 With bloud of <i>Henalois</i>, which therein fell.<br>
 How oft that day did sad <i>Brunchildis</i> see<br>
 The greene shield dyde in dolorous vermell?<br>
 That not <i>Scuith guiridh</i> it mote seeme to bee<br>
 But rather <i>y Scuith gogh</i>, signe of sad crueltee.</p><p>
  
 His sonne king <i>Leill</i> by fathers labour long,<br>
 Enioyd an heritage of lasting peace,<br>
 And built <i>Cairleill</i>, and built <i>Cairleon</i> strong.<br>
 Next <i>Huddibras</i> his realme did not encrease,<br>
 But taught the land from wearie warres to cease.<br>
 Whose footsteps <i>Bladud</i> following in arts<br>
 Exceld at <i>Athens</i> all the learned preace,<br>
 From whence he brought them to these saluage parts,<br>
 And with sweet science mollifide their stubborne harts.</p><p>
  
 Ensample of his wondrous faculty,<br>
 Behold the boyling Bathes at <i>Cairbadon</i>,<br>
 Which seeth with secret fire eternally,<br>
 And in their entrails, full of quicke Brimston,<br>
 Nourish the flames, which they are warm'd vpon,<br>
 That to their people wealth they forth do well,<br>
 And health to euery forreine nation:<br>
 Yet he at last contending to excell<br>
 The reach of men, through flight into fond mischief fell.</p><p>
  
 Next him king <i>Leyr</i> in happie peace long raind,<br>
 But had no issue male him to succeed,<br>
 But three faire daughters, which were well vptraind,<br>
 In all that seemed fit for kingly seed:<br>
 Mongst whom his realme he equally decreed<br>
 To have diuided.  Tho when feeble age<br>
 Nigh to his vtmost date he saw proceed,<br>
 He cald his daughters; and with speeches sage<br>
 Inquyrd, which of them most did loue her parentage.</p><p>
  
 The eldest <i>Gonorill</i> gan to protest,<br>
 That she much more then her owne life him lou'd:<br>
 And <i>Regan</i> greater loue to him profest,<br>
 Then all the world, when euer it were proou'd;<br>
 But <i>Cordeill</i> said she lou'd him, as behoou'd:<br>
 Whose simple answere, wanting colours faire<br>
 To paint it forth, him to displeasance moou'd,<br>
 That in his crowne he counted her no haire,<br>
 But twixt the other twaine his kingdome whole did shaire.</p><p>
  
 So wedded th'one to <i>Maglan</i> king of Scots,<br>
 And th'other to the king of <i>Cambria</i>,<br>
 And twixt them shayrd his realme by equall lots:<br>
 But without dowre the wise <i>Cordelia</i><br>
 Was sent to <i>Aganip</i> of <i>Celtica</i>.<br>
 Their aged Syre, thus eased of his crowne,<br>
 A priuate life led in <i>Albania</i>,<br>
 With <i>Gonorill</i>, long had in great renowne,<br>
 That nought him grieu'd to bene from rule deposed downe.</p><p>
  
 But true it is, that when the oyle is spent,<br>
 The light goes out, and weeke is throwne away;<br>
 So when he had resigned his regiment,<br>
 His daughter gan despise his drouping day,<br>
 And wearie waxe of his continuall stay.<br>
 Tho to his daughter <i>Rigan</i> he repayrd,<br>
 Who him at first well vsed euery way;<br>
 But when of his departure she despayrd,<br>
 Her bountie she abated, and his cheare empayrd.</p><p>
  
 The wretched man gan then auise too late,<br>
 That loue is not, where most it is profest,<br>
 Too truely tryde in his extreamest state;<br>
 At last resolu'd likewise to proue the rest,<br>
 He to <i>Cordelia</i> him selfe addrest,<br>
 Who with entire affection him receau'd,<br>
 As for her Syre and king her seemed best;<br>
 And after all an army strong she leau'd,<br>
 To war on those, which him had of his realme bereau'd.</p><p>
  
 So to his crowne she him restor'd againe,<br>
 In which he dyde, made ripe for death by eld,<br>
 And after wild, it should to her remaine:<br>
 Who peaceably the same long time did weld:<br>
 And all mens harts in dew obedience held:<br>
 Till that her sisters children, woxen strong<br>
 Through proud ambition, against her rebeld,<br>
 And ouercommen kept in prison long,<br>
 Till wearie of that wretched life, her selfe she hong.</p><p>
  
 Then gan the bloudie brethren both to raine:<br>
 But fierce <i>Cundah</i> gan shortly to enuie<br>
 His brother <i>Morgan</i>, prickt with proud disdaine,<br>
 To haue a pere in part of soueraintie,<br>
 And kindling coles of cruell enmitie,<br>
 Raisd warre, and him in battell ouerthrew:<br>
 Whence as he to those woodie hils did flie,<br>
 Which hight of him <i>Glamorgan</i>, there him slew:<br>
 Then did he raigne alone, when he none equall knew.</p><p>
  
 His sonne <i>Riuallo</i> his dead roome did supply,<br>
 In whose sad time bloud did from heauen raine:<br>
 Next great <i>Gurgustus</i>, then faire <i>Cæcily</i><br>
 In constant peace their kingdomes did containe,<br>
 After whom <i>Lago</i>, and <i>Kinmarke</i> did raine,<br>
 And <i>Gorbogud</i>, till farre in yeares he grew:<br>
 Then his ambitious sonnes vnto them twaine<br>
 Arraught the rule, and from their father drew,<br>
 Stout <i>Ferrex</i> and sterne <i>Porrex</i> him in prison threw.</p><p>
  
 But &amp;ocirc:, the greedy thirst of royall crowne,<br>
 That knowes no kinred, nor regardes no right,<br>
 Stird <i>Porrex</i> vp to put his brother downe;<br>
 Who vnto him assembling forreine might,<br>
 Made warre on him, and fell him selfe in fight:<br>
 Whose death t'auenge, his mother mercilesse,<br>
 Most mercilesse of women, <i>VVyden</i> hight,<br>
 Her other sonne fast sleeping did oppresse,<br>
 And with most cruell hand him murdred pittilesse.</p><p>
  
 Here ended <i>Brutus</i> sacred progenie,<br>
 Which had seuen hundred yeares this scepter borne,<br>
 With high renowme, and great felicitie?<br>
 The noble braunch from th'antique stocke was torne<br>
 Through discord, and the royall throne forlorne:<br>
 Thenceforth this Realme was into factions rent,<br>
 Whilest each of <i>Brutus</i> boasted to be borne,<br>
 That in the end was left no moniment<br>
 Of <i>Brutus</i>, nor of Britons glory auncient.</p><p>
  
 Then vp arose a man of matchlesse might,<br>
 And wondrous wit to menage high affaires,<br>
 Who stird with pitty of the stressed plight<br>
 Of this sad Realme, cut into sundry shaires<br>
 By such, as claymd themselues <i>Brutes</i> rightfull haires,<br>
 Gathered the Princes of the people loose,<br>
 To taken counsell of their common cares;<br>
 Who with his wisedom won, him streight did choose<br>
 Their king, and swore him fealty to win or loose.</p><p>
  
 Then made he head against his enimies,<br>
 And <i>Ymner</i> slew, or <i>Logris</i> miscreate;<br>
 Then <i>Ruddoc</i> and proud <i>Stater</i>, both allyes,<br>
 This of <i>Albanie</i> newly nominate,<br>
 And that of <i>Cambry</i> king confirmed late,<br>
 He ouerthrew through his owne valiaunce;<br>
 Whose countreis he redus'd to quiet state,<br>
 And shortly brought to ciuill gouernaunce,<br>
 Now one, which earst were many, made through variaunce.</p><p>
  
 Then made he sacred lawes, which some men say<br>
 Were vnto him reueald in vision,<br>
 By which he freed the Traueilers high way,<br>
 The Churches part, and Ploughmans portion,<br>
 Restraining stealth, and strong extortion;<br>
 The gracious <i>Numa</i> of great <i>Britanie</i>:<br>
 For till his dayes, the chiefe dominion<br>
 By strength was wielded without pollicie;<br>
 Therefore he first wore crowne of gold for dignitie.</p><p>
  
 <i>Donwallo</i> dyde (for what may liue for ay?)<br>
 And left two sonnes, of pearelesse prowesse both;<br>
 That sacked <i>Rome</i> too dearely did assay,<br>
 The recompence of their periured oth,<br>
 And ransackt <i>Greece</i> well tryde, whẽ they were wroth;<br>
 Besides subiected <i>Fraunce</i>, and <i>Germany</i>,<br>
 Which yet their prayses speake, all be they loth,<br>
 And inly tremble at the memory<br>
 Of <i>Brennus</i> and <i>Bellinus</i>, kings of Britany.</p><p>
  
 Next them did <i>Gurgunt</i>, great <i>Bellinus</i> sonne<br>
 In rule succeede, and eke in fathers prayse;<br>
 He Easterland subdewd, and Danmarke wonne,<br>
 And of them both did foy and tribute raise,<br>
 The which was dew in his dead fathers dayes:<br>
 He also gaue to fugitiues of <i>Spayne</i>,<br>
 Whom he at sea found wandring from their wayes,<br>
 A seate in <i>Ireland</i> safely to remayne,<br>
 Which they should hold of him, as subiect to <i>Britayne</i>.</p><p>
  
 After him raigned <i>Guitheline</i> his hayre,<br>
 The iustest man and trewest in his dayes,<br>
 Who had to wife Dame <i>Mertia</i> the fayre,<br>
 A woman worthy of immortall prayse,<br>
 Which for this Realme found many goodly layes,<br>
 And wholesome Statutes to her husband brought;<br>
 Her many deemd to haue beene of the <i>Fayes</i>,<br>
 As was <i>Aegerie</i>, that <i>Numa</i> tought;<br>
 Those yet of her be <i>Mertiã</i> lawes both nam'd &amp; thought.</p><p>
  
 Her sonne <i>Sisillus</i> after her did rayne,<br>
 And then <i>Kimarus</i>, and then <i>Danius</i>;<br>
 Next whom <i>Morindus</i> did the crowne sustaine,<br>
 Who, had he not with wrath outrageous,<br>
 And cruell rancour dim'd his valorous<br>
 And mightie deeds, should matched haue the best:<br>
 As well in that same field victorious<br>
 Against the forreine <i>Morands</i> he exprest;<br>
 Yet liues his memorie, though carcas sleepe in rest.</p><p>
  
 Fiue sonnes he left begotten of one wife,<br>
 All which successiuely by turnes did raine;<br>
 First <i>Gorboman</i> a man of vertuous life;<br>
 Next <i>Archigald</i>, who for his proud disdaine,<br>
 Deposed was from Princedome soueraine,<br>
 And pitteous <i>Elidure</i> put in his sted;<br>
 Who shortly it to him restord againe,<br>
 Till by his death he it recouered;<br>
 But <i>Peridure</i> and <i>Vigent</i> him disthronized.</p><p>
  
 In wretched prison long he did remaine,<br>
 Till they outraigned had their vtmost date,<br>
 And then therein reseized was againe,<br>
 And ruled long with honorable state,<br>
 Till he surrendred Realme and life to fate.<br>
 Then all the sonnes of these fiue brethren raynd<br>
 By dew successe, and all their Nephewes late,<br>
 Euen thrise eleuen descents the crowne retaynd,<br>
 Till aged <i>Hely</i> by dew heritage it gaynd.</p><p>
  
 He had two sonnes, whose eldest called <i>Lud</i><br>
 Left of his life most famous memory,<br>
 And endlesse moniments of his great good:<br>
 The ruin'd wals he did reædifye<br>
 Of <i>Troynouant</i>, gainst force of enimy,<br>
 And built that gate, which of his name is hight,<br>
 By which he lyes entombed solemnly.<br>
 He left two sonnes, too young to rule aright,<br>
 <i>Androgeus</i> and <i>Tenantius</i>, pictures of his might.</p><p>
  
 Whilst they were young, <i>Cassibalane</i> their Eme<br>
 Was by the people chosen in their sted,<br>
 Who on him tooke the royall Diademe,<br>
 And goodly well long time it gouerned,<br>
 Till the prowd <i>Romanes</i> him disquieted,<br>
 And warlike <i>Caesar</i>, tempted with the name<br>
 Of this sweet Island, neuer conquered,<br>
 And enuying the Britons blazed fame,<br>
 (O hideous hunger of dominion) hither came.</p><p>
  
 Yet twise they were repulsed backe againe,<br>
 And twise renforst, backe to their ships to fly,<br>
 The whiles with bloud they all the shore did staine,<br>
 And the gray <i>Ocean</i> into purple dy:<br>
 Ne had they footing found at last perdie,<br>
 Had not <i>Androgeus</i>, false to natiue soyle,<br>
 And enuious of Vncles soueraintie,<br>
 Betrayd his contrey vnto forreine spoyle:<br>
 Nought else, but treason, from the first this lãd did foyle.</p><p>
  
 So by him <i>Caesar</i> got the victory,<br>
 Through great bloudshed, and many a sad assay,<br>
 In which him selfe was charged heauily<br>
 Of hardy <i>Nennius</i>, whom he yet did slay,<br>
 But lost his sword, yet to be seene this day.<br>
 Thenceforth this land was tributarie made<br>
 T'ambitious <i>Rome</i>, and did their rule obay,<br>
 Till <i>Arthur</i> all that reckoning did defray;<br>
 Yet oft the Briton kings against them strongly swayd.</p><p>
  
 Next him <i>Tenantius</i> raigned, then <i>Kimbeline</i>,<br>
 What time th'eternall Lord in fleshly slime<br>
 Enwombed was, from wretched <i>Adams</i> line<br>
 To purge away the guilt of sinfull crime:<br>
 O ioyous memorie of happy time,<br>
 That heauenly grace so plenteously displayd;<br>
 (O too high ditty for my simple rime.)<br>
 Soone after this the <i>Romanes</i> him warrayd;<br>
 For that their tribute he refusd to let be payd.</p><p>
  
 Good <i>Claudius</i>, that next was Emperour,<br>
 An army brought, and with him battell fought,<br>
 In which the king was by a Treachetour<br>
 Disguised slaine, ere any thereof thought:<br>
 Yet ceased not the bloudy fight for ought;<br>
 For <i>Aruirage</i> his brothers place supplide,<br>
 Both in his armes, and crowne, and by that draught<br>
 Did driue the <i>Romanes</i> to the weaker side,<br>
 That they to peace agreed.  So all was pacifide.</p><p>
  
 Was neuer king more highly magnifide,<br>
 Nor dred of <i>Romanes</i>, then was <i>Aruirage</i>,<br>
 For which the Emperour to him allide<br>
 His daughter <i>Genuiss</i>' in marriage:<br>
 Yet shortly he renounst the vassalage<br>
 Of <i>Rome</i> againe, who hither hastly sent<br>
 <i>Vespasian</i>, that with great spoile and rage<br>
 Forwasted all, till <i>Genuissa</i> gent<br>
 Perswaded him to ceasse, and her Lord to relent.</p><p>
  
 He dyde; and him succeeded <i>Marius</i>,<br>
 Who ioyd his dayes in great tranquillity,<br>
 Then <i>Coyll</i>, and after him good <i>Lucius</i>,<br>
 That first receiued Christianitie,<br>
 The sacred pledge of Christes Euangely;<br>
 Yet true it is, that long before that day<br>
 Hither came <i>Ioseph</i> of <i>Arimathy</i>,<br>
 Who brought with him the holy grayle, (they say)<br>
 And preacht the truth, but since it greatly did decay.</p><p>
  
 This good king shortly without issew dide,<br>
 Whereof great trouble in the kingdome grew,<br>
 That did her selfe in sundry parts diuide,<br>
 And with her powre her owne selfe ouerthrew,<br>
 Whilest <i>Romanes</i> dayly did the weake subdew:<br>
 Which seeing stout <i>Bunduca</i>, vp arose,<br>
 And taking armes, the <i>Britons</i> to her drew;<br>
 With whom she marched streight against her foes,<br>
 And them vnwares besides the <i>Seuerne</i> did enclose.</p><p>
  
 There she with them a cruell battell tride,<br>
 Not with so good successe, as she deseru'd;<br>
 By reason that the Captaines on her side,<br>
 Corrupted by <i>Paulinus</i>, from her sweru'd:<br>
 Yet such, as were through former flight preseru'd,<br>
 Gathering againe, her Host she did renew,<br>
 And with fresh courage on the victour seru'd:<br>
 But being all defeated, saue a few,<br>
 Rather then fly, or be captiu'd her selfe she slew.</p><p>
  
 O famous moniment of womens prayse,<br>
 Matchable either to <i>Semiramis</i>,<br>
 Whom antique history so high doth raise,<br>
 Or to <i>Hypsiphil</i>' or to <i>Thomiris</i>:<br>
 Her Host two hundred thousand numbred is;<br>
 Who whiles good fortune fauoured her might,<br>
 Triumphed oft against her enimis;<br>
 And yet though ouercome in haplesse fight,<br>
 She triumphed on death, in enemies despight.</p><p>
  
 Her reliques <i>Fulgent</i> hauing gathered,<br>
 Fought with <i>Seuerus</i>, and him ouerthrew;<br>
 Yet in the chace was slaine of them, that fled:<br>
 So made them victours, whom he did subdew.<br>
 Then gan <i>Carausius</i> tirannize anew,<br>
 And gainst the <i>Romanes</i> bent their proper powre,<br>
 But him <i>Allectus</i> treacherously slew,<br>
 And took on him the robe of Emperoure:<br>
 Nath'lesse the same enioyed but short happy howre:</p><p>
  
 For <i>Asclepiodate</i> him ouercame,<br>
 And left inglorious on the vanquisht playne,<br>
 Without or robe, or rag, to hide his shame.<br>
 Then afterwards he in his stead did rayne;<br>
 But shortly was by <i>Coyll</i> in battell slaine:<br>
 Who after long debate, since <i>Lucies</i> time,<br>
 Was of the <i>Britons</i> first crownd Soueraine:<br>
 Then gan this Realme renewe her passed prime:<br>
 He of his name <i>Coylchester</i> built of stone and lime.</p><p>
  
 Which when the <i>Romanes</i> heard, they hither sent<br>
 <i>Constantius</i>, a man of mickle might,<br>
 With whom king <i>Coyll</i> made an agreement,<br>
 And to him gaue for wife his daughter bright,<br>
 Faire <i>Helena</i>, the fairest liuing wight;<br>
 Who in all godly thewes, and goodly prayse<br>
 Did far excell, but was most famous hight<br>
 For skill in Musicke of all in her dayes,<br>
 Aswell in curious instruments, as cunning layes.</p><p>
  
 Of whom he did great <i>Constantine</i> beget,<br>
 Who afterward was Emperour of <i>Rome</i>;<br>
 To which whiles absent he his mind did set,<br>
 <i>Octauius</i> here lept into his roome,<br>
 And it vsurped by vnrighteous doome:<br>
 But he his title iustifide by might,<br>
 Slaying <i>Traherne</i>, and hauing ouercome<br>
 The <i>Romane</i> legion in dreadfull fight:<br>
 So settled he his kingdome, and confirmd his right.</p><p>
  
 But wanting issew male, his daughter deare<br>
 He gaue in wedlocke to <i>Maximian</i>,<br>
 And him with her made of his kingdome heyre,<br>
 Who soone by meanes thereof the Empire wan,<br>
 Till murdred by the friends of <i>Gratian</i>;<br>
 Then gan the Hunnes and Picts inuade this land,<br>
 During the raigne of <i>Maximinian</i>;<br>
 Who dying left none heire them to withstand,<br>
 But that they ouerran all parts with easie hand.</p><p>
  
 The weary <i>Britons</i>, whose war-hable youth<br>
 Was by <i>Maximian</i> lately led away,<br>
 With wretched miseries, and woefull ruth,<br>
 Were to those Pagans made an open pray,<br>
 And dayly spectacle of sad decay:<br>
 Whom <i>Romane</i> warres, which now foure hundred yeares,<br>
 And more had wasted, could no whit dismay;<br>
 Till by consent of Commons and of Peares,<br>
 They crownd the second <i>Constantine</i> with ioyous teares,</p><p>
  
 Who hauing oft in battell vanquished<br>
 Those spoilefull Picts, and swarming Easterlings,<br>
 Long time in peace his Realme established,<br>
 Yet oft annoyd with sundry bordragings<br>
 Of neighbour Scots, and forrein Scatterlings,<br>
 With which the world did in those dayes abound:<br>
 Which to outbarre, with painefull pyonings<br>
 From sea to sea he heapt a mightie mound,<br>
 Which from <i>Alcluid</i> to <i>Panwelt</i> did that border bound.</p><p>
  
 Three sonnes he dying left, all vnder age;<br>
 By meanes whereof, their vncle <i>Vortigere</i><br>
 Vsurpt the crowne, during their pupillage;<br>
 Which th'Infants tutors gathering to feare,<br>
 Them closely into <i>Armorick</i> did beare:<br>
 For dread of whom, and for those Picts annoyes,<br>
 He sent to <i>Germanie</i>, straunge aid to reare,<br>
 From whence eftsoones arriued here three hoyes<br>
 Of <i>Saxons</i>, whom he for his safetie imployes.</p><p>
  
 Two brethren were their Capitains, which hight<br>
 <i>Hengist</i> and <i>Horsus</i>, well approu'd in warre,<br>
 And both of them men of renowmed might;<br>
 Who making vantage of their ciuill iarre,<br>
 And of those forreiners, which came from farre,<br>
 Grew great, and got large portions of land,<br>
 That in the Realme ere long they stronger arre,<br>
 Then they which sought at first their helping hand,<br>
 And <i>Vortiger</i> enforst the kingdome to aband.</p><p>
  
 But by the helpe of <i>Vortimere</i> his sonne,<br>
 He is againe vnto his rule restord,<br>
 And <i>Hengist</i> seeming sad, for that was donne,<br>
 Receiued is to grace and new accord,<br>
 Through his faire daughters face, &amp; flattring word;<br>
 Soone after which, three hundred Lordes he slew<br>
 Of British bloud, all sitting at his bord;<br>
 Whose dolefull moniments who list to rew,<br>
 Th'eternall markes of treason may at <i>Stonheng</i> vew.</p><p>
  
 By this the sonnes of <i>Constantine</i>, which fled,<br>
 <i>Ambrose</i> and <i>Vther</i> did ripe years attaine,<br>
 And here arriuing, strongly challenged<br>
 The crowne, which <i>Vortiger</i> did long detaine:<br>
 Who flying from his guilt, by them was slaine,<br>
 And <i>Hengist</i> eke soone brought to shamefull death.<br>
 Thenceforth <i>Aurelius</i> peaceably did rayne,<br>
 Till that through poyson stopped was his breath;<br>
 So now entombed lyes at Stoneheng by the heath.</p><p>
  
 After him <i>Vther</i>, which <i>Pendragon</i> hight,<br>
 Succeding There abruptly it did end,<br>
 Without full point, or other Cesure right,<br>
 As if the rest some wicked hand did rend,<br>
 Or th'Authour selfe could not at least attend<br>
 To finish it: that so vntimely breach<br>
 The Prince him selfe halfe seemeth to offend,<br>
 Yet secret pleasure did offence empeach,<br>
 And wonder of antiquitie long stopt his speach.</p><p>
  
 At last quite rauisht with delight, to heare<br>
 The royall Ofspring of his natiue land,<br>
 Cryde out, Deare countrey, &amp;ocirc: how dearely deare<br>
 Ought thy remembraunce, and perpetuall band<br>
 Be to thy foster Childe, that from thy hand<br>
 Did commun breath and nouriture receaue?<br>
 How brutish is it not to vnderstand,<br>
 How much to her we owe, that all vs gaue,<br>
 That gaue vnto vs all, what euer good we haue.</p><p>
  
 But <i>Guyon</i> all this while his booke did read,<br>
 Ne yet has ended: for it was a great<br>
 And ample volume, that doth far excead<br>
 My leasure, so long leaues here to repeat:<br>
 It told, how first <i>Prometheus</i> did create<br>
 A man, of many partes from beasts deriued,<br>
 And then stole fire from heauen, to animate<br>
 His worke, for which he was by <i>Ioue</i> depriued<br>
 Of life him selfe, and hart-strings of an Ægle riued.</p><p>
  
 That man so made, he called <i>Elfe</i>, to weet<br>
 Quick, the first authour of all Elfin kind:<br>
 Who wandring through the world with wearie feet,<br>
 Did in the gardins of <i>Adonis</i> find<br>
 A goodly creature, whom he deemd in mind<br>
 To be no earthly wight, but either Spright,<br>
 Or Angell, th'authour of all woman kind;<br>
 Therefore a <i>Fay</i> he her according hight,<br>
 Of whom all <i>Faeryes</i> spring, and fetch their lignage right.</p><p>
  
 Of these a mightie people shortly grew,<br>
 And puissaunt kings, which all the world warrayd,<br>
 And to them selues all Nations did subdew:<br>
 The first and eldest, which that scepter swayd,<br>
 Was <i>Elfin</i>; him all <i>India</i> obayd,<br>
 And all that now <i>America</i> men call:<br>
 Next him was noble <i>Elfinan</i>, who layd<br>
 <i>Cleopolis</i> foundation first of all:<br>
 But <i>Elfiline</i> enclosd it with a golden wall.</p><p>
  
 His sonne was <i>Elfinell</i>, who ouercame<br>
 The wicked <i>Gobbelines</i> in bloudy field:<br>
 But <i>Elfant</i> was of most renowmed fame,<br>
 Who all of Christall did <i>Panthea</i> build:<br>
 Then <i>Elfar</i>, who two brethren gyants kild,<br>
 The one of which had two heads, th'other three:<br>
 Then <i>Elfinor</i>, who was in Magick skild;<br>
 He built by art vpon the glassy See<br>
 A bridge of bras, whose sound heauẽs thunder seem'd to bee.</p><p>
  
 He left three sonnes, the which in order raynd,<br>
 And all their Ofspring, in their dew descents,<br>
 Euen seuen hundred Princes, which maintaynd<br>
 With mightie deedes their sundry gouernments;<br>
 That were too long their infinite contents<br>
 Here to record, ne much materiall:<br>
 Yet should they be most famous moniments,<br>
 And braue ensample, both of martiall,<br>
 And ciuill rule to kings and states imperiall.</p><p>
  
 After all these <i>Elficleos</i> did rayne,<br>
 The wise <i>Elficleos</i> in great Maiestie,<br>
 Who mightily that scepter did sustayne,<br>
 And with rich spoiles and famous victorie,<br>
 Did high aduaunce the crowne of <i>Faery</i>:<br>
 He left two sonnes, of which faire <i>Elferon</i><br>
 The eldest brother did vntimely dy;<br>
 Whose emptie place the mightie <i>Oberon</i><br>
 Doubly supplide, in spousall, and dominion.</p><p>
  
 Great was his power and glorie ouer all,<br>
 Which him before, that sacred seate did fill,<br>
 That yet remaines his wide memoriall:<br>
 He dying left the fairest <i>Tanaquill</i>,<br>
 Him to succeede therein, by his last will:<br>
 Fairer and nobler liueth none this howre,<br>
 Ne like in grace, ne like in learned skill;<br>
 Therefore they <i>Glorian</i> call that glorious flowre,<br>
 Long mayst thou <i>Glorian</i> liue, in glory and great powre.</p><p>
  
 Beguild thus with delight of nouelties,<br>
 And naturall desire of countreys state,<br>
 So long they red in those antiquities,<br>
 That how the time was fled, they quite forgate,<br>
 Till gentle <i>Alma</i> seeing it so late,<br>
 Perforce their studies broke, and them besought<br>
 To thinke, how supper did them long awaite.<br>
 So halfe vnwilling from their bookes them brought,<br>
 And fairely feasted, as so noble knights she ought.</p><p>
