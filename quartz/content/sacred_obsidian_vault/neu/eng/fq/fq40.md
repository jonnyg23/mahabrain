 <i>Fayre Britomart saues Amoret,<br>
 Duessa discord breedes<br>
 Twixt Scudamour and Blandamour:<br>
 Their fight and warlike deedes.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 
 O
 F louers sad calamities of old,<br>
 Full many piteous stories doe remaine,<br>
 But none more piteous euer was ytold,<br>
 Then that of <i>Amorets</i> hart-binding chaine,<br>
 And this of <i>Florimels</i> vnworthie paine:<br>
 The deare compassion of whose bitter fit<br>
 My softened heart so sorely doth constraine,<br>
 That I with teares full oft doe pittie it,<br>
 And oftentimes doe wish it neuer had bene writ.</p><p>
 
 For from the time that <i>Scudamour</i> her bought<br>
 In perilous fight, she neuer ioyed day,<br>
 A perilous fight when he with force her brought<br>
 From twentie Knights, that did him all assay:<br>
 Yet fairely well he did them all dismay:<br>
 And with great glorie both the shield of loue,<br>
 And eke the Ladie selfe he brought away,<br>
 Whom hauing wedded as did him behoue,<br>
 A new vnknowen mischiefe did from him remoue.</p><p>
 
 For that same vile Enchauntour <i>Busyran</i>,<br>
 The very selfe same day that she was wedded,<br>
 Amidst the bridale feast, whilest euery man<br>
 Surcharg'd with wine, were heedlesse and ill hedded.<br>
 All bent to mirth before the bride was bedded,<br>
 Brought in that mask of loue which late was showen:<br>
 And there the Ladie ill of friends bestedded,<br>
 By way of sport, as oft in maskes is knowen,<br>
 Conueyed quite away to liuing wight vnknowen.</p><p>
 
 Seuen moneths he so her kept in bitter smart,<br>
 Because his sinfull lust she would not serue,<br>
 Vntill such time as noble <i>Britomart</i><br>
 Released her, that else was like to sterue,<br>
 Through cruell knife that her deare heart did kerue.<br>
 And now she is with her vpon the way,<br>
 Marching in louely wise, that could deserue<br>
 No spot of blame, though spite did oft assay<br>
 To blot her with dishonor of so faire a pray.</p><p>
 
 Yet should it be a pleasant tale, to tell<br>
 The diuerse vsage and demeanure daint,<br>
 That each to other made, as oft befell.<br>
 For <i>Amoret</i> right fearefull was and faint,<br>
 Lest she with blame her honor should attaint,<br>
 That euerie word did tremble as she spake,<br>
 And euerie looke was coy, and wondrous quaint,<br>
 And euerie limbe that touched her did quake:<br>
 Yet could she not but curteous coũtenance to her make.</p><p>
 
 For well she wist, as true it was indeed,<br>
 That her liues Lord and patrone of her health<br>
 Right well deserued as his duefull meed,<br>
 Her loue, her seruice, and her vtmost wealth.<br>
 All is his iustly, that all freely dealth:<br>
 Nathlesse her honor dearer then her life,<br>
 She sought to saue, as thing reseru'd from stealth;<br>
 Die had she leuer with Enchanters knife,<br>
 Then to be false in loue, profest a virgine wife.</p><p>
 
 Thereto her feare was made so much the greater<br>
 Through fine abusion of that Briton mayd:<br>
 Who for to hide her fained sex the better,<br>
 And maske her wounded mind, both did and sayd<br>
 Full many things so doubtfull to be wayd,<br>
 That well she wist not what by them to gesse,<br>
 For other whiles to her she purpos made<br>
 Of loue, and otherwhiles of lustfulnesse<br>
 That much she feard his mind would grow to some excesse.</p><p>
 
 His will she feard; for him she surely thought<br>
 To be a man, such as indeed he seemed,<br>
 And much the more, by that he lately wrought,<br>
 When her from deadly thraldome he redeemed,<br>
 For which no seruice she too much esteemed,<br>
 Yet dread of shame, and doubt of fowle dishonor<br>
 Made her not yeeld so much, as due she deemed.<br>
 Yet <i>Britomart</i> attended duly on her,<br>
 As well became a knight, and did to her all honor.</p><p>
 
 It so befell one euening, that they came<br>
 Vnto a Castell, lodged there to bee,<br>
 Where many a knight, and many a louely Dame<br>
 Was then assembled, deeds of armes to see:<br>
 Amongst all which was none more faire then shee,<br>
 That many of them mou'd to eye her sore.<br>
 The custome of that place was such, that hee<br>
 Which had no loue nor lemman there in store,<br>
 Should either winne him one, or lye without the dore.</p><p>
 
 Amongst the rest there was a iolly knight,<br>
 Who being asked for his loue, auow'd<br>
 That fairest <i>Amoret</i> was his by right,<br>
 And offred that to iustifie alowd.<br>
 The warlike virgine seeing his so prowd<br>
 And boastfull chalenge, wexed inlie wroth,<br>
 But for the present did her anger shrowd;<br>
 And sayd, her loue to lose she was full loth,<br>
 But either he should neither of them haue, or both.</p><p>
 
 So foorth they went, and both together giusted;<br>
 But that same younker soone was ouer throwne,<br>
 And made repent, that he had rashly lusted<br>
 For thing vnlawfull, that was not his owne:<br>
 Yet since he seemed valiant, through vnknowne,<br>
 She that no lesse was courteous then stout,<br>
 Cast how to salue, that both the custome showne<br>
 Were kept, and yet that Knight not locked out:<br>
 That seem'd full hard t'accord two things so far in dout.</p><p>
 
 The Seneschall was cal'd to deeme the right,<br>
 Whom she requir'd, that first fayre <i>Amoret</i><br>
 Might be to her allow'd, as to a Knight,<br>
 That did her win and free from chalenge set:<br>
 Which straight to her was yeelded without let.<br>
 Then since that strange Knights loue from him was quitted,<br>
 She claim'd that to her selfe, as Ladies det,<br>
 He as a Knight might iustly be admitted;<br>
 So none should be out shut, sith all of loues were fitted.</p><p>
 
 With that her glistring helmet she vnlaced;<br>
 Which doft, her golden lockes, that were vp bound<br>
 Still in a knot, vnto her heeles downe traced,<br>
 And like a silken veile in compasse round<br>
 About her backe and all her bodie wound;<br>
 Like as the shining skie in summers night,<br>
 What time the dayes with scorching heat abound,<br>
 Is creasted all with lines of firie light,<br>
 That it prodigious seemes in common peoples sight.</p><p>
 
 Such when those Knights and Ladies all about<br>
 Beheld her, all were with amazement smit,<br>
 And euery one gan grow in secret dout<br>
 Of this and that, according to each wit:<br>
 Some thought that some enchantment faygned it;<br>
 Some, that <i>Bellona</i> in that warlike wise<br>
 To them appear'd, with shield and armour fit;<br>
 Some, that it was a maske of strange disguise:<br>
 So diuersely each one did sundrie doubts deuise.</p><p>
 
 But that young Knight, which through her gentle deed<br>
 Was to that goodly fellowship restor'd,<br>
 Ten thousand thankes did yeeld her for her meed,<br>
 And doubly ouercommen, her ador'd:<br>
 So did they all their former strife accord;<br>
 And eke fayre <i>Amoret</i> now freed from feare,<br>
 More franke affection did to her afford,<br>
 And to her bed, which she was wont forbeare,<br>
 Now freely drew, and found right safe assurance theare.</p><p>
 
 Where all that night they of their loues did treat,<br>
 And hard aduentures twixt themselues alone,<br>
 That each the other gan with passion great,<br>
 And griefull pittie priuately bemone.<br>
 The morow next so soone as <i>Titan</i> shone,<br>
 They both vprose, and to their waies them dight:<br>
 Long wandred they, yet neuer met with none,<br>
 That to their willes could them direct aright,<br>
 Or to them tydings tell, that mote their harts delight.</p><p>
 
 Lo thus they rode, till at the last they spide<br>
 Two armed Knights, that toward them did pace,<br>
 And ech of them had ryding by his side<br>
 A Ladie, seeming in so farre a space,<br>
 But Ladies none they were, albee in face<br>
 And outward shew faire semblance they did beare;<br>
 For vnder maske of beautie and good grace,<br>
 Vile treason and fowle falshood hidden were,<br>
 That mote to none but to the warie wise appeare.</p><p>
 
 The one of them the false <i>Duessa</i> hight,<br>
 That now had chang'd her former wonted hew:<br>
 For she could d'on so manie shapes in sight,<br>
 As euer could Cameleon colours new;<br>
 So could she forge all colours, saue the trew.<br>
 The other no whit better was then shee,<br>
 But that such as she was, she plaine did shew;<br>
 Yet otherwise much worse, if worse might bee,<br>
 And dayly more offensiue vnto each degree.</p><p>
 
 Her name was <i>Ate</i>, mother of debate,<br>
 And all dissention, which doth dayly grow<br>
 Amongst fraile men, that many a publike state<br>
 And many a priuate oft doth ouerthrow.<br>
 Her false <i>Duessa</i> who full well did know,<br>
 To be most fit to trouble noble knights,<br>
 Which hunt for honor, raised from below,<br>
 Out of the dwellings of the damned sprights,<br>
 Where she in darknes wastes her cursed daies &amp; nights.</p><p>
 
 Hard by the gates of hell her dwelling is,<br>
 There whereas all the plagues and harmes abound,<br>
 Which punish wicked men, that walke amisse:<br>
 It is a darksome delue farre vnder ground,<br>
 With thornes and barren brakes enuirond round,<br>
 That none the same may easily out win;<br>
 Yet many waies to enter may be found,<br>
 But none to issue forth when one is in:<br>
 For discord harder is to end then to begin.</p><p>
 
 And all within the riuen walls were hung<br>
 With ragged monuments of times forepast,<br>
 All which the sad effects of discord sung:<br>
 There were rent robes, and broken scepters plast,<br>
 Altars defyl'd, and holy things defast,<br>
 Disshiuered speares, and shields ytorne in twaine,<br>
 Great cities ransackt, and strong castles rast,<br>
 Nations captiued, and huge armies slaine:<br>
 Of all which ruines there some relicks did remaine.</p><p>
 
 There was the signe of antique Babylon,<br>
 Of fatall Thebes, of Rome that raigned long,<br>
 Of sacred Salem, and sad Ilion<br>
 For memorie of which on high there hong<br>
 The golden Apple, cause of all their wrong,<br>
 For which the three faire Goddesses did striue:<br>
 There also was the name of <i>Nimrod</i> strong,<br>
 Of <i>Alexander</i>, and his Princes fiue,<br>
 Which shar'd to them the spoiles that he had got aliue.</p><p>
 
 And there the relicks of the drunken fray,<br>
 The which amongst the <i>Lapithees</i> befell,<br>
 And of the bloodie feast, which sent away<br>
 So many <i>Centaures</i> drunken soules to hell,<br>
 That vnder great <i>Alcides</i> furie fell:<br>
 And of the dreadfull discord, which did driue<br>
 The noble <i>Argonauts</i> to outrage fell:<br>
 That each of life sought others to depriue,<br>
 All mindlesse of the Golden fleece, which made them striue.</p><p>
 
 And eke of priuate persons many moe,<br>
 That were too long a worke to count them all;<br>
 Some of sworne friends, that did their faith forgoe;<br>
 Some of borne brethren, prov'd vnnaturall;<br>
 Some of deare louers, foes perpetuall:<br>
 Witnesse their broken bandes there to be seene,<br>
 Their girlonds rent, their bowres despoyled all;<br>
 The moniments whereof there byding beene,<br>
 As plaine as at the first, when they were fresh and greene.</p><p>
 
 Such was her house within; but all without,<br>
 The barren ground was full of wicked weedes,<br>
 Which she her selfe had sowen all about,<br>
 Now growen great, at first of little seedes,<br>
 The seedes of euill wordes, and factious deedes;<br>
 Which when to ripenesse due they growen arre,<br>
 Bring foorth an infinite increase, that breedes<br>
 Tumultuous trouble and contentious iarre,<br>
 The which most often end in bloudshed and in warre.</p><p>
 
 And those same cursed seedes doe also serue<br>
 To her for bread, and yeeld her liuing food:<br>
 For life it is to her, when others sterue<br>
 Through mischieuous debate, and deadly feood,<br>
 That she may sucke their life, and drinke their blood,<br>
 With which she from her childhood had bene fed.<br>
 For she at first was borne of hellish brood,<br>
 And by infernall furies nourished,<br>
 That by her monstrous shape might easily be red.</p><p>
 
 Her face most fowle and filthy was to see,<br>
 With squinted eyes contrarie wayes intended,<br>
 And loathly mouth, vnmeete a mouth to bee,<br>
 That nought but gall and venim comprehended,<br>
 And wicked wordes that God and man offended:<br>
 Her lying tongue was in two parts diuided,<br>
 And both the parts did speake, and both contended;<br>
 And as her tongue, so was her hart discided,<br>
 That neuer thoght one thing, but doubly stil was guided.</p><p>
 
 Als as she double spake, so heard she double,<br>
 With matchlesse eares deformed and distort,<br>
 Fild with false rumors and seditious trouble,<br>
 Bred in assemblies of the vulgar sort,<br>
 That still are led with euery light report.<br>
 And as her eares so eke her feet were odde,<br>
 And much vnlike, th'one long, the other short,<br>
 And both misplast; that when th'one forward yode,<br>
 The other backe retired, and contrarie trode.</p><p>
 
 Likewise vnequall were her handes twaine,<br>
 That one did reach, the other pusht away,<br>
 That one did make, the other mard againe,<br>
 And sought to bring all things vnto decay;<br>
 Whereby great riches gathered manie a day,<br>
 She in short space did often bring to nought<br>
 And their possessours often did dismay.<br>
 For all her studie was and all her thought,<br>
 How she might ouerthrow the things that Concord wrought.</p><p>
 
 So much her malice did her might surpas,<br>
 That euen th'Almightie selfe she did maligne,<br>
 Because to man so mercifull he was,<br>
 And vnto all his creatures so benigne,<br>
 Sith she her selfe was of his grace indigne:<br>
 For all this worlds faire workmanship she tride,<br>
 Vnto his last confusion to bring,<br>
 And that great golden chaine quite to diuide,<br>
 With which it blessed Concord hath together tide.</p><p>
 
 Such was that hag, which with <i>Duessa</i> roade,<br>
 And seruing her in her malitious vse,<br>
 To hurt good knights, was as it were her baude,<br>
 To sell her borrowed beautie to abuse.<br>
 For though like withered tree, that wanteth iuyce,<br>
 She old and crooked were, yet now of late,<br>
 As fresh and fragrant as the floure deluce<br>
 She was become, by chaunge of her estate,<br>
 And made full goodly ioyance to her new found mate.</p><p>
 
 Her mate he was a iollie youthfull knight,<br>
 That bore great sway in armes and chiualrie,<br>
 And was indeed a man of mickle might:<br>
 His name was <i>Blandamour</i>, that did descrie<br>
 His fickle mind full of inconstancie.<br>
 And now himselfe he fitted had right well,<br>
 With two companions of like qualitie,<br>
 Faithlesse <i>Duessa</i>, and false <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
 That whether were more false, full hard it is to tell.</p><p>
 
 Now when this gallant with his goodly crew,<br>
 From farre espide the famous <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
 Like knight aduenturous in outward vew,<br>
 With his faire paragon, his conquests part,<br>
 Approching nigh, eftsoones his wanton hart<br>
 Was tickled with delight, and iesting sayd;<br>
 Lo there Sir <i>Paridel</i>, for your desart,<br>
 Good lucke presents you with yond louely mayd,<br>
 For pitie that ye want a fellow for your ayd.</p><p>
 
 By that the louely paire drew nigh to hond:<br>
 Whom when as <i>Paridel</i> more plaine beheld,<br>
 Albee in heart he like affection fond,<br>
 Yet mindfull how he late by one was feld,<br>
 That did those armes and that same scutchion weld,<br>
 He had small lust to buy his loue so deare,<br>
 But answerd, Sir him wise I neuer held,<br>
 That hauing once escaped perill neare,<br>
 Would afterwards afresh the sleeping euill reare.</p><p>
 
 This knight too late his manhood and his might,<br>
 I did assay, that me right dearely cost,<br>
 Ne list I for reuenge prouoke new fight,<br>
 Ne for light Ladies loue, that soone is lost.<br>
 The hot-spurre youth so scorning to be crost,<br>
 Take then to you this Dame of mine (quoth hee)<br>
 And I without your perill or your cost,<br>
 Will chalenge yond same other for my fee:<br>
 So forth he fiercely prickt, that one him scarce could see.</p><p>
 
 The warlike Britonesse her soone addrest,<br>
 And with such vncouth welcome did receaue<br>
 Her fayned Paramour, her forced guest,<br>
 That being forst his saddle soone to leaue,<br>
 Him selfe he did of his new loue deceaue:<br>
 And made him selfe thensample of his follie.<br>
 Which done, she passed forth not taking leaue,<br>
 And left him now as sad, as whilome iollie,<br>
 Well warned to beware with whom he dar'd to dallie.</p><p>
 
 Which when his other companie beheld,<br>
 They to his succour ran with readie ayd:<br>
 And finding him vnable once to weld,<br>
 They reared him on horsebacke, and vpstayd,<br>
 Till on his way they had him forth conuayd:<br>
 And all the way with wondrous griefe of mynd,<br>
 And shame, he shewd him selfe to be dismayd,<br>
 More for the loue which he had left behynd,<br>
 Then that which he had to Sir <i>Paridel</i> resynd.</p><p>
 
 Nathlesse he forth did march well as he might,<br>
 And made good semblance to his companie,<br>
 Dissembling his disease and euill plight;<br>
 Till that ere long they chaunced to espie<br>
 Two other knights, that towards them did ply<br>
 With speedie course, as bent to charge them new.<br>
 Whom when as <i>Blandamour</i> approching nie,<br>
 Perceiu'd to be such as they seemd in vew,<br>
 He was full wo, and gan his former griefe renew.</p><p>
 
 For th'one of them he perfectly descride,<br>
 To be Sir <i>Scudamour</i>, by that he bore<br>
 The God of loue, with wings displayed wide,<br>
 Whom mortally he hated euermore,<br>
 Both for his worth, that all men did adore,<br>
 And eke because his loue he wonne by right:<br>
 Which when he thought, it grieued him full sore,<br>
 That through the bruses of his former fight,<br>
 He now vnable was to wreake his old despight.</p><p>
 
 For thy, he thus to <i>Paridel</i> bespake,<br>
 Faire Sir, of friendship let me now you pray,<br>
 That as I late aduentured for your sake,<br>
 The hurts whereof me now from battell stay,<br>
 Ye will me now with like good turne repay,<br>
 And iustifie my cause on yonder knight.<br>
 Ah Sir (said <i>Paridel</i>) do not dismay<br>
 Your selfe for this, my selfe will for you fight,<br>
 As ye haue done for me: the left hand rubs the right.</p><p>
 
 With that he put his spurres vnto his steed,<br>
 With speare in rest, and toward him did fare,<br>
 Like shaft out of a bow preuenting speed.<br>
 But <i>Scudamour</i> was shortly well aware<br>
 Of his approch, and gan him selfe prepare<br>
 Him to receiue with entertainment meete.<br>
 So furiously they met, that either bare<br>
 The other downe vnder their horses feete,<br>
 That what of them became, themselues did scarsly weete.</p><p>
 
 As when two billowes in the Irish sowndes,<br>
 Forcibly driuen with contrarie tydes<br>
 Do meete together, each abacke rebowndes<br>
 With roaring rage; and dashing on all sides,<br>
 That filleth all the sea with fome, diuydes<br>
 The doubtfull current into diuers wayes:<br>
 So fell those two in spight of both their prydes,<br>
 But <i>Scudamour</i> himselfe did soone vprayse,<br>
 And mounting light his foe for lying long vpbrayes.</p><p>
 
 Who rolled on an heape lay still in swound,<br>
 All carelesse of his taunt and bitter rayle,<br>
 Till that the rest him seeing lie on ground,<br>
 Ran hastily, to weete what did him ayle.<br>
 Where finding that the breath gan him to fayle,<br>
 With busie care they stroue him to awake,<br>
 And doft his helmet, and vndid his mayle:<br>
 So much they did, that at the last they brake<br>
 His slomber, yet so mazed, that he nothing spake.</p><p>
 
 Which when as <i>Blandamour</i> beheld, he sayd,<br>
 False faitour <i>Scudamour</i>, that hast by slight<br>
 And foule aduantage this good Knight dismayd,<br>
 A Knight much better then thy selfe behight,<br>
 Well falles it thee that I am not in plight<br>
 This day, to wreake the dammage by thee donne:<br>
 Such is thy wont, that still when any Knight<br>
 Is weakned, then thou doest him ouerronne:<br>
 So hast thou to thy selfe false honour often wonne.</p><p>
 
 He little answer'd, but in manly heart<br>
 His mightie indignation did forbeare,<br>
 Which was not yet so secret, but some part<br>
 Thereof did in his frouning face appeare:<br>
 Like as a gloomie cloud, the which doth beare<br>
 An hideous storme, is by the Northerne blast<br>
 Quite ouerblowne, yet doth not passe so cleare,<br>
 But that it all the skie doth ouercast<br>
 With darknes dred, and threatens all the world to wast.</p><p>
 
 Ah gentle knight then false <i>Duessa</i> sayd,<br>
 Why do ye striue for Ladies loue so sore,<br>
 Whose chiefe desire is loue and friendly aid<br>
 Mongst gentle Knights to nourish euermore?<br>
 Ne be ye wroth Sir <i>Scudamour</i> therefore,<br>
 That she your loue list loue another knight,<br>
 Ne do your selfe dislike a whit the more;<br>
 For Loue is free, and led with selfe delight,<br>
 Ne will enforced be with maisterdome or might.</p><p>
 
 So false <i>Duessa</i>, but vile <i>Ate</i> thus;<br>
 Both foolish knights, I can but laugh at both,<br>
 That striue and storme with stirre outrageous,<br>
 For her that each of you alike doth loth,<br>
 And loues another, with whom now she go'th<br>
 In louely wise, and sleepes, and sports, and playes;<br>
 Whilest both you here with many a cursed oth,<br>
 Sweare she is yours, and stirre vp bloudie frayes,<br>
 To win a willow bough, whilest other weares the bayes.</p><p>
 
 Vile hag (sayd <i>Scudamour</i>) why dost thou lye?<br>
 And falsly seekst a vertuous wight to shame?<br>
 Fond knight (sayd she) the thing that with this eye<br>
 I saw, why should I doubt to tell the same?<br>
 Then tell (quoth <i>Blandamour</i>) and feare no blame,<br>
 Tell what thou saw'st, maulgre who so it heares.<br>
 I saw (quoth she) a stranger knight, whose name<br>
 I wote not well, but in his shield he beares<br>
 (That well I wote) the heads of many broken speares.</p><p>
 
 I saw him haue your <i>Amoret</i> at will,<br>
 I saw him kisse, I saw him her embrace,<br>
 I saw him sleepe with her all night his fill,<br>
 All manie nights, and manie by in place,<br>
 That present were to testifie the case.<br>
 Which when as <i>Scudamour</i> did heare, his heart<br>
 Was thrild with inward griefe, as when in chace<br>
 The Parthian strikes a stag with shiuering dart,<br>
 The beast astonisht stands in middest of his smart.</p><p>
 
 So stood Sir <i>Scudamour</i>, when this he heard,<br>
 Ne word he had to speake for great dismay,<br>
 But lookt on <i>Glauce</i> grim, who woxe afeard<br>
 Of outrage for the words, which she heard say,<br>
 Albee vntrue she wist them by assay.<br>
 But <i>Blandamour</i>, whenas he did espie<br>
 His chaunge of cheere, that anguish did bewray,<br>
 He woxe full blithe, as he had got thereby,<br>
 And gan thereat to triumph without victorie.</p><p>
 
 Lo recreant (sayd he) the fruitlesse end<br>
 Of thy vaine boast, and spoile of loue misgotten,<br>
 Whereby the name of knighthood thou dost shend,<br>
 And all true louers with dishonor blotten,<br>
 All things not rooted well, will soone be rotten.<br>
 Fy fy false knight (then false <i>Duessa</i> cryde)<br>
 Vnworthy life that loue with guile hast gotten,<br>
 Be thou, where euer thou do go or ryde,<br>
 Loathed of ladies all, and of all knights defyde.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Scudamour</i> for passing great despight<br>
 Staid not to answer, scarcely did refraine,<br>
 But that in all those knights and ladies sight,<br>
 He for reuenge had guiltlesse <i>Glauce</i> slaine:<br>
 But being past, he thus began amaine;<br>
 False traitour squire, false squire, of falsest knight,<br>
 Why doth mine hand from thine auenge abstaine,<br>
 Whose Lord hath done my loue this foule despight?<br>
 Why do I not it wreake, on thee now in my might?</p><p>
 
 Discourteous, disloyall <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
 Vntrue to God, and vnto man vniust,<br>
 What vengeance due can equall thy desart,<br>
 That hast with shamefull spot of sinfull lust<br>
 Defil'd the pledge committed to thy trust?<br>
 Let vgly shame and endlesse infamy<br>
 Colour thy name with foule reproaches rust.<br>
 Yet thou false Squire his fault shalt deare aby,<br>
 And with thy punishment his penance shalt supply.</p><p>
 
 The aged Dame him seeing so enraged,<br>
 Was dead with feare, nathlesse as neede required,<br>
 His flaming furie sought to haue assuaged<br>
 With sober words, that sufferance desired,<br>
 Till time the tryall of her truth expyred:<br>
 And euermore sought <i>Britomart</i> to cleare.<br>
 But he the more with furious rage was fyred,<br>
 And thrise his hand to kill her did vpreare,<br>
 And thrise he drew it backe: so did at last forbeare.</p><p>
