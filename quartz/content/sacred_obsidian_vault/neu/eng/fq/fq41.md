 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Blandamour winnes false Florimell,<br>
 Paridell for her striues,<br>
 They are accorded: Agape<br>
 doth lengthen her sonnes liues.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 F
 Irebrand of hell first tynd in Phlegeton,<br>
 By thousand furies, and from thence out throwen<br>
 Into this world, to worke confusion,<br>
 And set it all on fire by force vnknowen,<br>
 Is wicked discord, whose small sparkes once blowen<br>
 None but a God or godlike man can slake;<br>
 Such as was <i>Orpheus</i>, that when strife was growen<br>
 Amongst those famous ympes of Greece, did take<br>
 His siluer Harpe in hand, and shortly friends them make.<p>
 
 Or such as that celestiall Psalmist was,<br>
 That when the wicked feend his Lord tormented,<br>
 With heauenly notes, that did all other pas,<br>
 The outrage of his furious fit relented.<br>
 Such Musicke is wise words with time concented,<br>
 To moderate stiffe minds, disposd to striue:<br>
 Such as that prudent Romane well inuented,<br>
 What time his people into partes did riue,<br>
 Them reconcyld againe, and to their homes did driue.</p><p>
 
 Such vs'd wise <i>Glauce</i> to that wrathfull knight,<br>
 To calme the tempest of his troubled thought:<br>
 Yet <i>Blandamour</i> with termes of foule despight,<br>
 And <i>Paridell</i> her scornd, and set at nought,<br>
 As old and crooked and not good for ought.<br>
 Both they vnwise, and warelesse of the euill,<br>
 That by themselues vnto themselues is wrought,<br>
 Through that false witch, and that foule aged dreuill,<br>
 The one a feend, the other an incarnate deuill.</p><p>
 
 With whom as they thus rode accompanide,<br>
 They were encountred of a lustie Knight,<br>
 That had a goodly Ladie by his side,<br>
 To whom he made great dalliance and delight.<br>
 It was to weete the bold Sir <i>Ferraugh</i> hight,<br>
 He that from <i>Braggadocchio</i> whilome reft<br>
 The snowy <i>Florimell</i>, whose beautie bright<br>
 Made him seeme happie for so glorious theft;<br>
 Yet was it in due triall but a wandring weft.</p><p>
 
 Which when as <i>Blandamour</i>, whose fancie light<br>
 Was alwaies flitting as the wauering wind,<br>
 After each beautie, that appeard in sight,<br>
 Beheld, eftsoones it prickt his wanton mind<br>
 With sting of lust, that reasons eye did blind,<br>
 That to Sir <i>Paridell</i> these words he sent;<br>
 Sir knight why ride ye dumpish thus behind,<br>
 Since so good fortune doth to you present<br>
 So fayre a spoyle, to make you ioyous meriment?</p><p>
 
 But <i>Paridell</i> that had too late a tryall<br>
 Of the bad issue of his counsell vaine,<br>
 List not to hearke, but made this faire denyall;<br>
 Last turne was mine, well proued to my paine,<br>
 This now be yours, God send you better gaine.<br>
 Whose scoffed words he taking halfe in scorne,<br>
 Fiercely forth prickt his steed as in disdaine,<br>
 Against that Knight, ere he him well could torne<br>
 By meanes whereof he hath him lightly ouerborne.</p><p>
 
 Who with the sudden stroke astonisht sore,<br>
 Vpon the ground a while in slomber lay;<br>
 The whiles his loue away the other bore,<br>
 And shewing her, did <i>Paridell</i> vpbray;<br>
 Lo sluggish Knight the victors happie pray:<br>
 So fortune friends the bold: whom <i>Paridell</i><br>
 Seeing so faire indeede, as he did say,<br>
 His hart with secret enuie gan to swell,<br>
 And inly grudge at him, that he had sped so well.</p><p>
 
 Nathlesse proud man himselfe the other deemed,<br>
 Hauing so peerelesse paragon ygot:<br>
 For sure the fayrest <i>Florimell</i> him seemed,<br>
 To him was fallen for his happie lot,<br>
 Whose like aliue on earth he weened not:<br>
 Therefore he her did court, did serue, did wooe,<br>
 With humblest suit that he imagine mot,<br>
 And all things did deuise, and all things dooe,<br>
 That might her loue prepare, and liking win theretoo.</p><p>
 
 She in regard thereof him recompenst<br>
 With golden words, and goodly countenance,<br>
 And such fond fauours sparingly dispenst:<br>
 Sometimes him blessing with a light eye-glance,<br>
 And coy lookes tempring with loose dalliance;<br>
 Sometimes estranging him in sterner wise,<br>
 That hauing cast him in a foolish trance,<br>
 He seemed brought to bed in Paradise,<br>
 And prou'd himselfe most foole, in what he seem'd most wise.</p><p>
 
 So great a mistresse of her art she was,<br>
 And perfectly practiz'd in womans craft,<br>
 That though therein himselfe he thought to pas,<br>
 And by his false allurements wylie draft<br>
 Had thousand women of their loue beraft,<br>
 Yet now he was surpriz'd: for that false spright,<br>
 Which that same witch had in this forme engraft,<br>
 Was so expert in euery subtile slight,<br>
 That it could ouerreach the wisest earthly wight.</p><p>
 
 Yet he to her did dayly seruice more,<br>
 And dayly more deceiued was thereby;<br>
 Yet <i>Paridell</i> him enuied therefore,<br>
 As seeming plast in sole felicity:<br>
 So blind is lust, false colours to descry.<br>
 But <i>Ate</i> soone discouering his desire,<br>
 And finding now fit opportunity<br>
 To stirre vp strife, twixt loue and spight and ire,<br>
 Did priuily put coles vnto his secret fire.</p><p>
 
 By sundry meanes thereto she prickt him forth,<br>
 Now with remembrance of those spightfull speaches,<br>
 Now with opinion of his owne more worth,<br>
 Now with recounting of like former breaches<br>
 Made in their friendship, as that Hag him teaches:<br>
 And euer when his passion is allayd,<br>
 She it reuiues and new occasion reaches:<br>
 That on a time as they together way'd,<br>
 He made him open chalenge, and thus boldly sayd.</p><p>
 
 Too boastfull <i>Blandamour</i>, too long I beare<br>
 The open wrongs, thou doest me day by day;<br>
 Well know'st thou, whe˜ we friendship first did sweare,<br>
 The couenant was, that euery spoyle or pray<br>
 Should equally be shard betwixt vs tway:<br>
 Where is my part then of this Ladie bright,<br>
 Whom to thy selfe thou takest quite away?<br>
 Render therefore therein to me my right,<br>
 Or answere for thy wrong, as shall fall out in fight.</p><p>
 
 Exceeding wroth thereat was <i>Blandamour</i>,<br>
 And gan this bitter answere to him make;<br>
 Too foolish <i>Paridell</i>, that fayrest floure<br>
 Wouldst gather faine, and yet no paines wouldst take:<br>
 But not so easie will I her forsake;<br>
 This hand her wonne, this hand shall her defend.<br>
 With that they gan their shiuering speares to shake,<br>
 And deadly points at eithers breast to bend,<br>
 Forgetfull each to haue bene euer others frend.</p><p>
 
 Their firie Steedes with so vntamed forse<br>
 Did beare them both to fell auenges end,<br>
 That both their speares with pitilesse remorse,<br>
 Through shield and mayle, and haberieon did wend,<br>
 And in their flesh a griesly passage rend,<br>
 That with the furie of their owne affret,<br>
 Each other horse and man to ground did send;<br>
 Where lying still a while, both did forget<br>
 The perilous present stownd, in which their liues were set.</p><p>
 
 As when two warlike Brigandines at sea,<br>
 With murdrous weapons arm'd to cruell fight,<br>
 Doe meete together on the watry lea,<br>
 They stemme ech other with so fell despight,<br>
 That with the shocke of their owne heedlesse might,<br>
 Their wooden ribs are shaken nigh a sonder;<br>
 They which from shore behold the dreadfull sight<br>
 Of flashing fire, and heare the ordenance thonder,<br>
 Do greatly stand amaz'd at such vnwonted wonder.</p><p>
 
 At length they both vpstarted in amaze;<br>
 As men awaked rashly out of dreme,<br>
 And round about themselues a while did gaze,<br>
 Till seeing her, that <i>Florimell</i> did seme,<br>
 In doubt to whom she victorie should deeme,<br>
 Therewith their dulled sprights they edgd anew,<br>
 And drawing both their swords with rage extreme,<br>
 Like two mad mastiffes each on other flew,<br>
 And shields did share, &amp; mailes did rash, and helmes did hew.</p><p>
 
 So furiously each other did assayle,<br>
 As if their soules they would attonce haue rent<br>
 Out of their brests, that streames of bloud did rayle<br>
 Adowne, as if their springes of life were spent;<br>
 That all the ground with purple bloud was sprent,<br>
 And all their armours staynd with bloudie gore,<br>
 Yet scarcely once to breath would they relent,<br>
 So mortall was their malice and so sore,<br>
 Become of fayned friendship which they vow'd afore.</p><p>
 
 And that which is for Ladies most befitting,<br>
 To stint all strife, and foster friendly peace,<br>
 Was from those Dames so farre and so vnfitting,<br>
 As that in stead of praying them surcease,<br>
 They did much more their cruelty encrease;<br>
 Bidding them fight for honour of their loue,<br>
 And rather die then Ladies cause release.<br>
 With which vaine termes so much they did the˜ moue,<br>
 That both resolu'd the last extremities to proue.</p><p>
 
 There they I weene would fight vntill this day,<br>
 Had not a Squire, euen he the Squire of Dames,<br>
 By great aduenture trauelled that way;<br>
 Who seeing both bent to so bloudy games,<br>
 And both of old well knowing by their names,<br>
 Drew nigh, to weete the cause of their debate:<br>
 And first laide on those Ladies thousand blames,<br>
 That did not seeke t'appease their deadly hate,<br>
 But gazed on their harmes, not pittying their estate.</p><p>
 
 And then those Knights he humbly did beseech,<br>
 To stay their hands, till he a while had spoken:<br>
 Who lookt a little vp at that his speech,<br>
 Yet would not let their battell so be broken,<br>
 Both greedie fiers on other to be wroken.<br>
 Yet he to them so earnestly did call,<br>
 And them coniur'd by some well knowen token,<br>
 That they at last their wrothfull hands let fall,<br>
 Content to heare him speake, and glad to rest withall.</p><p>
 
 First he desir'd their cause of strife to see:<br>
 They said, it was for loue of <i>Florimell</i>.<br>
 Ah gentle knights (quoth he) how may that bee,<br>
 And she so farre astray, as none can tell.<br>
 Fond Squire, full angry then sayd <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
 Seest not the Ladie there before thy face?<br>
 He looked backe, and her aduizing well,<br>
 Weend as he said, by that her outward grace,<br>
 That fayrest <i>Florimell</i> was present there in place.</p><p>
 
 Glad man was he to see that ioyous sight,<br>
 For none aliue but ioy'd in <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
 And lowly to her lowting thus behight;<br>
 Fayrest of faire, that fairenesse doest excell,<br>
 This happie day I haue to greete you well,<br>
 In which you safe I see, whom thousand late,<br>
 Misdoubted lost through mischiefe that befell;<br>
 Long may you liue in health and happie state.<br>
 She litle answer'd him, but lightly did aggrate.</p><p>
 
 Then turning to those Knights, he gan a new;<br>
 And you Sir <i>Blandamour</i> and <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
 That for this Ladie present in your vew,<br>
 Haue rays'd this cruell warre and outrage fell,<br>
 Certes me seemes bene not aduised well,<br>
 But rather ought in friendship for her sake<br>
 To ioyne your force, their forces to repell,<br>
 That seeke perforce her from you both to take,<br>
 And of your gotten spoyle their owne triumph to make.</p><p>
 
 Thereat Sir <i>Blandamour</i> with countenance sterne,<br>
 All full of wrath, thus fiercely him bespake;<br>
 A read thou Squire, that I the man may learne,<br>
 That dare fro me thinke <i>Florimell</i> to take.<br>
 Not one (quoth he) but many doe partake<br>
 Herein, as thus.  It lately so befell,<br>
 That <i>Satyran</i> a girdle did vptake,<br>
 Well knowne to appertaine to <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
 Which for her sake he wore, as him beseemed well.</p><p>
 
 But when as she her selfe was lost and gone,<br>
 Full many knights, that loued her like deare,<br>
 Thereat did greatly grudge, that he alone<br>
 That lost faire Ladies ornament should weare,<br>
 And gan therefore close spight to him to beare:<br>
 Which he to shun, and stop vile enuies sting,<br>
 Hath lately caus'd to be proclaim'd each where<br>
 A solemne feast, with publike turneying,<br>
 To which all knights with them their Ladies are to bring.</p><p>
 
 And of them all she that is fayrest found,<br>
 Shall haue that golden girdle for reward,<br>
 And of those Knights who is most stout on ground,<br>
 Shall to that fairest Ladie be prefard.<br>
 Since therefore she her selfe is now your ward,<br>
 To you that ornament of hers pertaines,<br>
 Against all those, that chalenge it to gard,<br>
 And saue her honour with your ventrous paines;<br>
 That shall you win more glory, then ye here find gaines.</p><p>
 
 When they the reason of his words had hard,<br>
 They gan abate the rancour of their rage,<br>
 And with their honours and their loues regard,<br>
 The furious flames of malice to asswage.<br>
 Tho each to other did his faith engage,<br>
 Like faithfull friends thenceforth to ioyne in one<br>
 With all their force, and battell strong to wage<br>
 Gainst all those knights, as their professed fone,<br>
 That chaleng'd ought in <i>Florimell</i>, saue they alone.</p><p>
 
 So well accorded forth they rode together<br>
 In friendly sort, that lasted but a while;<br>
 And of all old dislikes they made faire weather,<br>
 Yet all was forg'd and spred with golden foyle,<br>
 That vnder it hidde hate and hollow guyle.<br>
 Ne certes can that friendship long endure,<br>
 How euer gay and goodly be the style,<br>
 That doth ill cause or euill end enure:<br>
 For vertue is the band, that bindeth harts most sure.</p><p>
 
 Thus as they marched all in close disguise,<br>
 Of fayned loue, they chaunst to ouertake<br>
 Two knights, that lincked rode in louely wise,<br>
 As if they secret counsels did partake;<br>
 And each not farre behinde him had his make,<br>
 To weete, two Ladies of most goodly hew,<br>
 That twixt themselues did gentle purpose make<br>
 Vnmindfull both of that discordfull crew,<br>
 The which with speedie pace did after them pursew.</p><p>
 
 Who as they now approched nigh at hand,<br>
 Deeming them doughtie as they did appeare,<br>
 They sent that Squire afore, to vnderstand,<br>
 What mote they be: who viewing them more neare<br>
 Returned readie newes, that those same weare<br>
 Two of the prowest Knights in Faery lond;<br>
 And those two Ladies their two louers deare,<br>
 Couragious <i>Cambell</i>, and stout <i>Triamond</i>,<br>
 With <i>Canacee</i> and <i>Cambine</i> linckt in louely bond.</p><p>
 
 Whylome as antique stories tellen vs,<br>
 Those two were foes the fellonest on ground,<br>
 And battell made the dreddest daungerous,<br>
 That euer shrilling trumpet did resound;<br>
 Though now their acts be no where to be found,<br>
 As that renowmed Poet them compyled,<br>
 With warlike numbers and Heroicke sound,<br>
 Dan <i>Chaucer</i>, well of English vndefyled,<br>
 On Fames eternall beadroll worthie to be fyled.</p><p>
 
 But wicked Time that all good thoughts doth waste,<br>
 And workes of noblest wits to nought out weare,<br>
 That famous moniment hath quite defaste,<br>
 And robd the world of threasure endlesse deare,<br>
 The which mote haue enriched all vs heare.<br>
 O cursed Eld the cankerworme of writs,<br>
 How may these rimes, so rude as doth appeare,<br>
 Hope to endure, sith workes of heauenly wits<br>
 Are quite deuourd, and brought to nought by little bits?</p><p>
 
 Then pardon, O most sacred happie spirit,<br>
 That I thy labours lost may thus reuiue,<br>
 And steale from thee the meede of thy due merit,<br>
 That none durst euer whilest thou wast aliue,<br>
 And being dead in vaine yet many striue:<br>
 Ne dare I like, but through infusion sweete<br>
 Of thine owne spirit, which doth in me suruiue,<br>
 I follow here the footing of thy feete,<br>
 That with thy meaning so I may the rather meete.</p><p>
 
 <i>Cambelloes</i> sister was fayre <i>Canacee</i>,<br>
 That was the learnedst Ladie in her dayes,<br>
 Well seene in euerie science that mote bee,<br>
 And euery secret worke of natures wayes,<br>
 In wittie riddles, and in wise soothsayes,<br>
 In power of herbes, and tunes of beasts and burds;<br>
 And, that augmented all her other prayse,<br>
 She modest was in all her deedes and words,<br>
 And wondrous chast of life, yet lou'd of Knights &amp; Lords.</p><p>
 
 Full many Lords, and many Knights her loued,<br>
 Yet she to none of them her liking lent,<br>
 Ne euer was with fond affection moued,<br>
 But rul'd her thoughts with goodly gouernement,<br>
 For dread of blame and honours blemishment;<br>
 And eke vnto her lookes a law she made,<br>
 That none of them once out of order went,<br>
 But like to warie Centonels well stayd,<br>
 Still watcht on euery side, of secret foes affrayd.</p><p>
 
 So much the more as she refusd to loue,<br>
 So much the more she loued was and sought,<br>
 That oftentimes vnquiet strife did moue<br>
 Amongst her louers, and great quarrels wrought,<br>
 That oft for her in bloudie armes they fought.<br>
 Which whenas <i>Cambell</i>, that was stout and wise,<br>
 Perceiu'd would breede great mischiefe, he bethought<br>
 How to preuent the perill that mote rise,<br>
 And turne both him and her to honour in this wise.</p><p>
 
 One day, when all that troupe of warlike wooers<br>
 Assembled were, to weet whose she should bee,<br>
 All mightie men and dreadfull derring dooers,<br>
 (The harder it to make them well agree)<br>
 Amongst them all this end he did decree;<br>
 That of them all, which loue to her did make,<br>
 They by consent should chose the stoutest three,<br>
 That with himselfe should combat for her sake,<br>
 And of them all the victour should his sister take.</p><p>
 
 Bold was the chalenge, as himselfe was bold,<br>
 And courage full of haughtie hardiment,<br>
 Approued oft in perils manifold,<br>
 Which he atchieu'd to his great ornament:<br>
 But yet his sisters skill vnto him lent<br>
 Most confidence and hope of happie speed,<br>
 Conceiued by a ring, which she him sent,<br>
 That mongst the manie vertues, which we reed,<br>
 Had power to staunch al wounds, that mortally did bleed.</p><p>
 
 Well was that rings great vertue knowen to all,<br>
 That dread thereof, and his redoubted might<br>
 Did all that youthly rout so much appall,<br>
 That none of them durst vndertake the fight;<br>
 More wise they weend to make of loue delight,<br>
 Then life to hazard for faire Ladies looke;<br>
 And yet vncertaine by such outward sight,<br>
 Though for her sake they all that perill tooke,<br>
 Whether she would them loue, or in her liking brooke.</p><p>
 
 Amongst those knights there were three brethren bold,<br>
 Three bolder brethren neuer were yborne,<br>
 Borne of one mother in one happie mold,<br>
 Borne at one burden in one happie morne;<br>
 Thrise happie mother, and thrise happie morne,<br>
 That bore three such, three such not to be fond;<br>
 Her name was <i>Agape</i> whose children werne<br>
 All three as one, the first hight <i>Priamond</i>,<br>
 The second <i>Dyamond</i>, the youngest <i>Triamond</i>.</p><p>
 
 Stout <i>Priamond</i>, but not so strong to strike,<br>
 Strong <i>Diamond</i>, but not so stout a knight,<br>
 But <i>Triamond</i> was stout and strong alike:<br>
 On horsebacke vsed <i>Triamond</i> to fight,<br>
 And <i>Priamond</i> on foote had more delight,<br>
 But horse and foote knew <i>Diamond</i> to wield:<br>
 With curtaxe vsed <i>Diamond</i> to smite,<br>
 And <i>Triamond</i> to handle speare and shield,<br>
 But speare and curtaxe both vsd <i>Priamond</i> in field.</p><p>
 
 These three did loue each other dearely well,<br>
 And with so firme affection were allyde,<br>
 As if but one soule in them all did dwell,<br>
 Which did her powre into three parts diuyde;<br>
 Like three faire branches budding farre and wide,<br>
 That from one roote deriu'd their vitall sap:<br>
 And like that roote that doth her life diuide,<br>
 Their mother was, and had full blessed hap,<br>
 These three so noble babes to bring forth at one clap.</p><p>
 
 Their mother was a Fay, and had the skill<br>
 Of secret things, and all the powres of nature,<br>
 Which she by art could vse vnto her will,<br>
 And to her seruice bind each liuing creature;<br>
 Through secret vnderstanding of their feature.<br>
 Thereto she was right faire, when so her face<br>
 She list discouer, and of goodly stature;<br>
 But she as Fayes are wont, in priuie place<br>
 Did spend her dayes, and lov'd in forests wyld to space.</p><p>
 
 There on a day a noble youthly knight<br>
 Seeking aduentures in the saluage wood,<br>
 Did by great fortune get of her the sight;<br>
 As she sate carelesse by a cristall flood,<br>
 Combing her golden lockes, as seemd her good:<br>
 And vnawares vpon her laying hold,<br>
 That stroue in vaine him long to haue withstood,<br>
 Oppressed her, and there (as it is told)<br>
 Got these three louely babes, that prov'd three cha˜pions bold.</p><p>
 
 Which she with her long fostred in that wood,<br>
 Till that to ripenesse of mans state they grew:<br>
 Then shewing forth signes of their fathers blood,<br>
 They loued armes, and knighthood did ensew,<br>
 Seeking aduentures, where they anie knew.<br>
 Which when their mother saw, she gan to dout<br>
 Their safetie, least by searching daungers new,<br>
 And rash prouoking perils all about,<br>
 Their days mote be abridged through their corage stout.</p><p>
 
 Therefore desirous th'end of all their dayes<br>
 To know, and them t'enlarge with long extent,<br>
 By wondrous skill, and many hidden wayes,<br>
 To the three fatall sisters house she went.<br>
 Farre vnder ground from tract of liuing went,<br>
 Downe in the bottome of the deepe <i>Abysse</i>,<br>
 Where <i>Demogorgon</i> in dull darknesse pent,<br>
 Farre from the view of Gods and heauens blis,<br>
 The hideous <i>Chaos</i> keepes, their dreadfull dwelling is.</p><p>
 
 There she them found, all sitting round about<br>
 The direfull distaffe standing in the mid,<br>
 And with vnwearied fingers drawing out<br>
 The lines of life, from liuing knowledge hid.<br>
 Sad <i>Clotho</i> held the rocke, the whiles the thrid<br>
 By griesly <i>Lachesis</i> was spun with paine,<br>
 That cruell <i>Atropos</i> eftsoones vndid,<br>
 With cursed knife cutting the twist in twaine:<br>
 Most wretched men, whose dayes depend on thrids so vaine.</p><p>
 
 She them saluting, there by them sate still,<br>
 Beholding how the thrids of life they span:<br>
 And when at last she had beheld her fill,<br>
 Trembling in heart, and looking pale and wan,<br>
 Her cause of comming she to tell began.<br>
 To whom fierce <i>Atropos</i>, Bold Fay, that durst<br>
 Come see the secret of the life of man,<br>
 Well worthie thou to be of <i>Ioue</i> accurst,<br>
 And eke thy childrens thrids to be asunder burst.</p><p>
 
 Whereat she sore affrayd, yet her besought<br>
 To graunt her boone, and rigour to abate,<br>
 That she might see her childre˜s thrids forth brought,<br>
 And know the measure of their vtmost date,<br>
 To them ordained by eternall fate.<br>
 Which <i>Clotho</i> graunting, shewed her the same:<br>
 That when she saw, it did her much amate,<br>
 To see their thrids so thin, as spiders frame,<br>
 And eke so short, that seemd their ends out shortly came.</p><p>
 
 She then began them humbly to intreate,<br>
 To draw them longer out, and better twine,<br>
 That so their liues might be prolonged late.<br>
 But <i>Lachesis</i> thereat gan to repine,<br>
 And sayd, Fond dame that deem'st of things diuine<br>
 As of humane, that they may altred bee,<br>
 And chaung'd at pleasure for those impes of thine.<br>
 Not so; for what the Fates do once decree,<br>
 Not all the gods can chaunge, nor <i>Ioue</i> him self can free.</p><p>
 
 Then since (quoth she) the terme of each mans life<br>
 For nought may lessened nor enlarged bee,<br>
 Graunt this, that when ye shred with fatall knife<br>
 His line, which is the eldest of the three,<br>
 Which is of them the shortest, as I see,<br>
 Eftsoones his life may passe into the next;<br>
 And when the next shall likewise ended bee,<br>
 That both their liues may likewise be annext<br>
 Vnto the third, that his may so be trebly wext.</p><p>
 
 They graunted it; and then that carefull Fay<br>
 Departed thence with full contended mynd;<br>
 And comming home, in warlike fresh aray<br>
 Them found all three according to their kynd:<br>
 But vnto them what destinie was assynd,<br>
 Or how their liues were eekt, she did not tell;<br>
 But euermore, when she fit time could fynd,<br>
 She warned them to tend their safeties well,<br>
 And loue each other deare, what euer them befell.</p><p>
 
 So did they surely during all their dayes,<br>
 And neuer discord did amongst them fall;<br>
 Which much augmented all their other praise.<br>
 And now t'increase affection naturall,<br>
 In loue of <i>Canacee</i> they ioyned all:<br>
 Vpon which ground this same great battell grew,<br>
 Great matter growing of beginning small;<br>
 The which for length I will not here pursew,<br>
 But rather will reserue it for a Canto new.</p><p>
