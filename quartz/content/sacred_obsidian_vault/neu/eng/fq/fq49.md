 </p><blockquote> 
 <i>Scudamour doth his conquest tell,<br>
 Of vertuous Amoret:<br>
 Great Venus Temple is describ'd,<br>
 And louers life forth set.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 T
 Rue he it said, what euer man it sayd,<br>
 That loue with gall and hony doth abound,<br>
 But if the one be with the other wayd,<br>
 For euery dram of hony therein found,<br>
 A pound of gall doth ouer it redound.<br>
 That I too true by triall haue approued:<br>
 For since the day that first with deadly wound<br>
 My heart was launcht, and learned to haue loued,<br>
 I neuer ioyed howre, but still with care was moued.<p>
 
 And yet such grace is giuen them from aboue,<br>
 That all the cares and euill which they meet,<br>
 May nought at all their setled mindes remoue,<br>
 But seeme gainst common sence to them most sweet;<br>
 As bosting in their martyrdome vnmeet.<br>
 So all that euer yet I haue endured,<br>
 I count as naught, and tread downe vnder feet,<br>
 Since of my loue at length I rest assured,<br>
 That to disloyalty she will not be allured.</p><p>
 
 Long were to tell the trauell and long toile,<br>
 Through which this shield of loue I late haue wonne,<br>
 And purchased this peerelesse beauties spoile,<br>
 That harder may be ended, then begonne.<br>
 But since ye so desire, your will be donne.<br>
 Then hearke ye gentle knights and Ladies free,<br>
 My hard mishaps, that ye may learne to shonne;<br>
 For though sweet loue to conquer glorious be,<br>
 Yet is the paine thereof much greater then the fee.</p><p>
 
 What time the fame of this renowmed prise<br>
 Flew first abroad, and all mens eares possest,<br>
 I hauing armes then taken, gan auise<br>
 To winne me honour by some noble gest,<br>
 And purchase me some place amongst the best.<br>
 I boldly thought (so young mens thoughts are bold)<br>
 That this same braue emprize for me did rest,<br>
 And that both shield and she whom I behold,<br>
 Might be my lucky lot; sith all by lot we hold.</p><p>
 
 So on that hard aduenture forth I went,<br>
 And to the place of perill shortly came.<br>
 That was a temple faire and auncient,<br>
 Which of great mother <i>Venus</i> bare the name,<br>
 And farre renowmed through exceeding fame;<br>
 Much more then that, which was in <i>Paphos</i> built,<br>
 Or that in <i>Cyprus</i>, both long since this same,<br>
 Though all the pillours of the one were guilt,<br>
 And all the others pauement were with yuory spilt.</p><p>
 
 And it was seated in an Island strong,<br>
 Abounding all with delices most rare,<br>
 And wall'd by nature gainst inuaders wrong,<br>
 That none mote haue accesse, nor inward fare,<br>
 But by one way, that passage did prepare.<br>
 It was a bridge ybuilt in goodly wize,<br>
 With curious Corbes and pendants grauen faire,<br>
 And arched all with porches, did arize<br>
 On stately pillours, fram'd after the Doricke guize.</p><p>
 
 And for defence thereof, on th'other end<br>
 There reared was a castle faire and strong,<br>
 That warded all which in or out did wend,<br>
 And flancked both the bridges sides along,<br>
 Gainst all that would it faine to force or wrong.<br>
 And therein wonned twenty valiant Knights;<br>
 All twenty tride in warres experience long;<br>
 Whose office was, against all manner wights<br>
 By all meanes to maintaine that castels ancient rights.</p><p>
 
 Before that Castle was an open plaine,<br>
 And in the midst thereof a piller placed;<br>
 On which this shield, of many sought in vaine,<br>
 The shield of Loue, whose guerdon me hath graced,<br>
 Was hangd on high with golden ribbands laced;<br>
 And in the marble stone was written this,<br>
 With golden letters goodly well enchaced,<br>
 <i>Blessed the man that well can vse his blis:</i><br>
 <i>VVhose euer be the shield, faire Amoret be his.</i></p><p>
 
 Which when I red, my heart did inly earne,<br>
 And pant with hope of that aduentures hap:<br>
 Ne stayed further newes thereof to learne,<br>
 But with my speare vpon the shield did rap,<br>
 That all the castle ringed with the clap.<br>
 Streight forth issewd a Knight all arm'd to proofe,<br>
 And brauely mounted to his most mishap:<br>
 Who staying nought to question from aloofe,<br>
 Ran fierce at me, that fire glaunst from his horses hoofe.</p><p>
 
 Whom boldly I encountred (as I could)<br>
 And by good fortune shortly him vnseated.<br>
 Eftsoones out sprung two more of equall mould;<br>
 But I them both with equall hap defeated:<br>
 So all the twenty I likewise entreated,<br>
 And left them groning there vpon the plaine.<br>
 Then preacing to the pillour I repeated<br>
 The read thereof for guerdon of my paine,<br>
 And taking downe the shield, with me did it retaine.</p><p>
 
 So forth without impediment I past,<br>
 Till to the Bridges vtter gate I came:<br>
 The which I found sure lockt and chained fast.<br>
 I knockt, but no man aunswred me by name;<br>
 I cald, but no man answerd to my clame.<br>
 Yet I perseuer'd still to knocke and call,<br>
 Till at the last I spide within the same,<br>
 Where one stood peeping through a creuis small,<br>
 To whom I cald aloud, halfe angry therewithall.</p><p>
 
 That was to weet the Porter of the place,<br>
 Vnto whose trust the charge thereof was lent:<br>
 His name was <i>Doubt</i>, that had a double face,<br>
 Th'one forward looking, th'other backeward bent,<br>
 Therein resembling <i>Ianus</i> auncient,<br>
 Which hath in charge the ingate of the yeare:<br>
 And euermore his eyes about him went,<br>
 As if some proued perill he did feare,<br>
 Or did misdoubt some ill, whose cause did not appeare.</p><p>
 
 On th'one side he, on th'other sate <i>Delay</i>,<br>
 Behinde the gate, that none her might espy;<br>
 Whose manner was all passengers to stay,<br>
 And entertaine with her occasions sly,<br>
 Through which some lost great hope vnheedily,<br>
 Which neuer they recouer might againe;<br>
 And others quite excluded forth, did ly<br>
 Long languishing there in vnpittied paine,<br>
 And seeking often entraunce, afterwards in vaine.</p><p>
 
 Me when as he had priuily espide,<br>
 Bearing the shield which I had conquerd late,<br>
 He kend it streight, and to me opened wide.<br>
 So in I past, and streight he closd the gate.<br>
 But being in, <i>Delay</i> in close awaite<br>
 Caught hold on me, and thought my steps to stay,<br>
 Feigning full many a fond excuse to prate,<br>
 And time to steale, the threasure of mans day;<br>
 Whose smallest minute lost, no riches render may.</p><p>
 
 But by no meanes my way I would forslow,<br>
 For ought that euer she could doe or say,<br>
 But from my lofty steede dismounting low,<br>
 Past forth on foote, beholding all the way<br>
 The goodly workes, and stones of rich assay,<br>
 Cast into sundry shapes by wondrous skill,<br>
 That like on earth no where I recken may:<br>
 And vnderneath, the riuer rolling still<br>
 With murmure soft, that seem'd to serue the workmans will.</p><p>
 
 Thence forth I passed to the second gate,<br>
 The <i>Gate of good desert</i>, whose goodly pride<br>
 And costly frame, were long here to relate.<br>
 The same to all stoode alwaies open wide:<br>
 But in the Porch did euermore abide<br>
 An hideous Giant, dreadfull to behold,<br>
 That stopt the entraunce with his spacious stride,<br>
 And with the terrour of his countenance bold<br>
 Full many did affray, that else faine enter would.</p><p>
 
 His name was <i>Daunger</i> dreaded ouer all,<br>
 Who day and night did watch and duely ward,<br>
 From fearefull cowards, entrance to forstall,<br>
 And faint-heart-fooles, whom shew of perill hard<br>
 Could terrifie from Fortunes faire adward:<br>
 For oftentimes faint hearts at first espiall<br>
 Of his grim face, were from approaching scard;<br>
 Vnworthy they of grace, whom one deniall<br>
 Excludes from fairest hope, withouten further triall.</p><p>
 
 Yet many doughty warriours, often tride<br>
 In greater perils to be stout and bold,<br>
 Durst not the sternnesse of his looke abide,<br>
 But soone as they his countenance did behold,<br>
 Began to faint, and feele their corage cold.<br>
 Againe some other, that in hard assaies<br>
 Were cowards knowne, and litle count did hold,<br>
 Either through gifts, or guile, or such like waies,<br>
 Crept in by stouping low, or stealing of the kaies.</p><p>
 
 But I though meanest man of many moe,<br>
 Yet much disdaining vnto him to lout,<br>
 Or creepe betweene his legs, so in to goe,<br>
 Resolu'd him to assault with manhood stout,<br>
 And either beat him in, or driue him out.<br>
 Eftsoones aduauncing that enchaunted shield,<br>
 With all my might I gan to lay about:<br>
 Which when he saw, the glaiue which he did wield<br>
 He gan forthwith t'auale, and way vnto me yield.</p><p>
 
 So as I entred, I did backeward looke,<br>
 For feare of harme, that might lie hidden there;<br>
 And loe his hindparts, whereof heed I tooke,<br>
 Much more deformed fearefull vgly were,<br>
 Then all his former parts did earst appere.<br>
 For hatred, murther, treason, and despight,<br>
 With many moe lay in ambushment there,<br>
 Awayting to entrap the warelesse wight,<br>
 Which did not them preuent with vigilant foresight.</p><p>
 
 Thus hauing past all perill, I was come<br>
 Within the compasse of that Islands space;<br>
 The which did seeme vnto my simple doome,<br>
 The onely pleasant and delightfull place,<br>
 That euer troden was of footings trace.<br>
 For all that nature by her mother wit<br>
 Could frame in earth, and forme of substance base,<br>
 Was there, and all that nature did omit,<br>
 Art playing second natures part, supplyed it.</p><p>
 
 No tree, that is of count, in greenewood growes,<br>
 From lowest Iuniper to Ceder tall,<br>
 No flowre in field, that daintie odour throwes,<br>
 And deckes his branch with blossomes ouer all,<br>
 But there was planted, or grew naturall:<br>
 Nor sense of man so coy and curious nice,<br>
 But there mote find to please it selfe withall;<br>
 Nor hart could wish for any queint deuice,<br>
 But there it present was, and did fraile sense entice.</p><p>
 
 In such luxurious plentie of all pleasure,<br>
 It seem'd a second paradise to ghesse,<br>
 So lauishly enricht with natures threasure,<br>
 That if the happie soules, which doe possesse<br>
 Th'Elysian fields, and liue in lasting blesse,<br>
 Should happen this with liuing eye to see,<br>
 They soone would loath their lesser happinesse,<br>
 And wish to life return'd againe to bee,<br>
 That in this ioyous place they mote haue ioyance free.</p><p>
 
 Fresh shadowes, fit to shroud from sunny ray;<br>
 Faire lawnds, to take the sunne in season dew;<br>
 Sweet springs, in which a thousand Nymphs did play;<br>
 Soft rombling brookes, that gentle slomber drew;<br>
 High reared mounts, the lands about to vew;<br>
 Low looking dales, disloignd from common gaze;<br>
 Delightfull bowres, to solace louers trew;<br>
 False Labyrinthes, fond runners eyes to daze;<br>
 All which by nature made did nature selfe amaze.</p><p>
 
 And all without were walkes and alleyes dight,<br>
 With diuers trees, enrang'd in euen rankes;<br>
 And here and there were pleasant arbors pight,<br>
 And shadie seates, and sundry flowring bankes,<br>
 To sit and rest the walkers wearie shankes,<br>
 And therein thousand payres of louers walkt,<br>
 Praysing their god, and yeelding him great thankes,<br>
 Ne euer ought but of their true loues talkt,<br>
 Ne euer for rebuke or blame of any balkt.</p><p>
 
 All these together by themselves did sport<br>
 Their spotlesse pleasures, and sweet loues content.<br>
 But farre away from these, another sort<br>
 Of louers lincked in true harts consent;<br>
 Which loued not as these, for like intent,<br>
 But on chast vertue grounded their desire,<br>
 Farre from all fraud, or fayned blandishment;<br>
 Which in their spirits kindling zealous fire,<br>
 Braue thoughts and noble deedes did euermore aspire.</p><p>
 
 Such were great <i>Hercules</i>, and <i>Hylas</i> deare;<br>
 Trew <i>Ionathan</i>, and <i>Dauid</i> trustie tryde;<br>
 Stout <i>Theseus</i>, and <i>Pirithous</i> his feare;<br>
 <i>Pylades</i> and <i>Orestes</i> by his syde;<br>
 Myld <i>Titus</i> and <i>Gesippus</i> without pryde;<br>
 <i>Damon</i> and <i>Pythias</i> whom death could not seuer;<br>
 All these and all that euer had bene tyde,<br>
 In bands of friendship, there did liue for euer,<br>
 Whose liues although decay'd, yet loues decayed neuer.</p><p>
 
 Which when as I, that neuer tasted blis,<br>
 Nor happie howre, beheld with gazefull eye,<br>
 I thought there was none other heauen then this;<br>
 And gan their endlesse happinesse enuye,<br>
 That being free from feare and gealosye,<br>
 Might frankely there their loues desire possesse;<br>
 Whilest I through paines and perlous ieopardie,<br>
 Was forst to seeke my lifes deare patronesse:<br>
 Much dearer be the things, which come through hard distresse.</p><p>
 
 Yet all those sights, and all that else I saw,<br>
 Might not my steps withhold, but that forthright<br>
 Vnto that purposd place I did me draw,<br>
 Where as my loue was lodged day and night:<br>
 The temple of great <i>Venus</i>, that is hight<br>
 The Queene of beautie, and of loue the mother,<br>
 There worshipped of euery liuing wight;<br>
 Whose goodly workmanship farre past all other<br>
 That euer were on earth, all were they set together.</p><p>
 
 Not that same famous Temple of <i>Diane</i>,<br>
 Whose hight all <i>Ephesus</i> did ouersee,<br>
 And which all <i>Asia</i> sought with vowes prophane,<br>
 One of the worlds seuen wonders sayd to bee,<br>
 Might match with this by many a degree:<br>
 Nor that, which that wise King of <i>Iurie</i> framed,<br>
 With endlesse cost, to be th'Almighties see;<br>
 Nor all that else through all the world is named<br>
 To all the heathen Gods, might like to this be clamed.</p><p>
 
 I much admyring that so goodly frame,<br>
 Vnto the porch approcht, which open stood;<br>
 But therein sate an amiable Dame,<br>
 That seem'd to be of very sober mood,<br>
 And in her semblant shewed great womanhood:<br>
 Strange was her tyre; for on her head a crowne<br>
 She wore much like vnto a Danisk hood<br>
 Poudred with pearle and stone, and all her gowne<br>
 Enwouen was with gold, that raught full low a downe.</p><p>
 
 On either side of her, two young men stood,<br>
 Both strongly arm'd, as fearing one another;<br>
 Yet were they brethren both of halfe the blood,<br>
 Begotten by two fathers of one mother,<br>
 Though of contrarie natures each to other:<br>
 The one of them hight <i>Loue</i>, the other <i>Hate</i>,<br>
 <i>Hate</i> was the elder, <i>Loue</i> the younger brother;<br>
 Yet was the younger stronger in his state<br>
 Then th'elder, and him maystred still in all debate.</p><p>
 
 Nathlesse that Dame so well them tempred both,<br>
 That she them forced hand to ioyne in hand,<br>
 Albe that <i>Hatred</i> was thereto full loth,<br>
 And turn'd his face away, as he did stand,<br>
 Vnwilling to behold that louely band.<br>
 Yet she was of such grace and vertuous might,<br>
 That her commaundment he could not withstand,<br>
 But bit his lip for felonous despight,<br>
 And gnasht his yron tuskes at that displeasing sight.</p><p>
 
 <i>Concord</i> she cleeped was in common reed,<br>
 Mother of blessed <i>Peace</i>, and <i>Friendship</i> trew;<br>
 They both her twins, both borne of heauenly seed,<br>
 And she her selfe likewise diuinely grew;<br>
 The which right well her workes diuine did shew:<br>
 For strength, and wealth, and happinesse she lends,<br>
 And strife, and warre, and anger does subdew:<br>
 Of litle much, of foes she maketh frends,<br>
 And to afflicted minds sweet rest and quiet sends.</p><p>
 
 By her the heauen is in his course contained,<br>
 And all the world in state vnmoued stands,<br>
 As their Almightie maker first ordained,<br>
 And bound them with inuiolable bands;<br>
 Else would the waters ouerflow the lands,<br>
 And fire deuoure the ayre, and hell them quight,<br>
 But that she holds them with her blessed hands.<br>
 She is the nourse of pleasure and delight,<br>
 And vnto <i>Venus</i> grace the gate doth open right.</p><p>
 
 By her I entring halfe dismayed was,<br>
 But she in gentle wise me entertayned,<br>
 And twixt her selfe and <i>Loue</i> did let me pas;<br>
 But <i>Hatred</i> would my entrance haue restrayned,<br>
 And with his club me threatned to haue brayned,<br>
 Had not the Ladie with her powrefull speach<br>
 Him from his wicked will vneath refrayned;<br>
 And th'other eke his malice did empeach,<br>
 Till I was throughly past the perill of his reach.</p><p>
 
 Into the inmost Temple thus I came,<br>
 Which fuming all with frankensence I found,<br>
 And odours rising from the altars flame.<br>
 Vpon an hundred marble pillors round<br>
 The roofe vp high was reared from the ground,<br>
 All deckt with crownes, &amp; chaynes, and girlands gay,<br>
 And thousand pretious gifts worth many a pound,<br>
 The which sad louers for their vowes did pay;<br>
 And all the ground was strow'd with flowres, as fresh as May.</p><p>
 
 An hundred Altars round about were set,<br>
 All flaming with their sacrifices fire,<br>
 That with the steme thereof the Temple swet,<br>
 Which rould in clouds to heauen did aspire,<br>
 And in them bore true louers vowes entire:<br>
 And eke an hundred brasen caudrons bright,<br>
 To bath in ioy and amorous desire,<br>
 Euery of which was to a damzell hight;<br>
 For all the Priests were damzels, in soft linnen dight.</p><p>
 
 Right in the midst the Goddesse selfe did stand<br>
 Vpon an altar of some costly masse,<br>
 Whose substance was vneath to vnderstand:<br>
 For neither pretious stone, nor durefull brasse,<br>
 For shining gold, nor mouldring clay it was;<br>
 But much more rare and pretious to esteeme,<br>
 Pure in aspect, and like to christall glasse,<br>
 Yet glasse was not, if one did rightly deeme,<br>
 But being faire and brickle, likest glasse did seeme.</p><p>
 
 But it in shape and beautie did excell<br>
 All other Idoles, which the heathen adore<br>
 Farre passing that, which by surpassing skill<br>
 <i>Phidias</i> did make in <i>Paphos</i> Isle of yore,<br>
 With which that wretched Greeke, that life forlore<br>
 Did fall in loue: yet this much fairer shined,<br>
 But couered with a slender veile afore;<br>
 And both her feete and legs together twyned<br>
 Were with a snake, whose head &amp; tail were fast cõbyned.</p><p>
 
 The cause why she was couered with a vele,<br>
 Was hard to know, for that her Priests the same<br>
 From peoples knowledge labour'd to concele.<br>
 But sooth it was not sure for womanish shame,<br>
 Nor any blemish, which the worke mote blame;<br>
 But for, they say, she hath both kinds in one,<br>
 Both male and female, both vnder one name:<br>
 She syre and mother is her selfe alone,<br>
 Begets and eke conceiues, ne needeth other none.</p><p>
 
 And all about her necke and shoulders flew<br>
 A flocke of litle loues, and sports, and ioyes,<br>
 With nimble wings of gold and purple hew;<br>
 Whose shapes seem'd not like to terrestriall boyes,<br>
 But like to Angels playing heauenly toyes;<br>
 The whilest their eldest brother was away,<br>
 <i>Cupid</i> their eldest brother; he enioyes<br>
 The wide kingdome of loue with Lordly sway,<br>
 And to his law compels all creatures to obay.</p><p>
 
 And all about her altar scattered lay<br>
 Great sorts of louers piteously complayning,<br>
 Some of their losse, some of their loues delay,<br>
 Some of their pride, some paragons disdayning,<br>
 Some fearing fraud, some fraudulently fayning,<br>
 As euery one had cause of good or ill.<br>
 Amongst the rest some one through loues constrayning,<br>
 Tormented sore, could not containe it still,<br>
 But thus brake forth, that all the temple it did fill.</p><p>
 
 Great <i>Venus</i>, Queene of beautie and of grace,<br>
 The ioy of Gods and men, that vnder skie<br>
 Doest fayrest shine, and most adorne thy place,<br>
 That with thy smyling looke doest pacifie<br>
 The raging seas, and makst the stormes to flie;<br>
 Thee goddesse, thee the winds, the clouds doe feare,<br>
 And when thou spredst thy mantle forth on hie,<br>
 The waters play and pleasant lands appeare,<br>
 And heauens laugh, &amp; all the world shews ioyous cheare.</p><p>
 
 Then doth the dædale earth throw forth to thee<br>
 Out of her fruitfull lap aboundant flowres,<br>
 And then all liuing wights, soone as they see<br>
 The spring breake forth out of his lusty bowres,<br>
 They all doe learne to play the Paramours;<br>
 First doe the merry birds, thy prety pages<br>
 Priuily pricked with thy lustfull powres,<br>
 Chirpe loud to thee out of their leauy cages,<br>
 And thee their mother call to coole their kindly rages.</p><p>
 
 Then doe the saluage beasts begin to play<br>
 Their pleasant friskes, and loath their wonted food;<br>
 The Lyons rore, the Tygres loudly bray,<br>
 The raging Buls rebellow through the wood,<br>
 And breaking forth, dare tempt the deepest flood,<br>
 To come where thou doest draw them with desire:<br>
 So all things else, that nourish vitall blood,<br>
 Soone as with fury thou doest them inspire,<br>
 In generation seeke to quench their inward fire.</p><p>
 
 So all the world by thee at first was made,<br>
 And dayly yet thou doest the same repayre:<br>
 Ne ought on earth that merry is and glad,<br>
 Ne ought on earth that louely is and fayre,<br>
 But thou the same for pleasure didst prepayre.<br>
 Thou art the root of all that ioyous is,<br>
 Great God of men and women, queene of th'ayre,<br>
 Mother of laughter, and welspring of blisse,<br>
 O graunt that of my loue at last I may not misse.</p><p>
 
 So did he say: but I with murmure soft,<br>
 That none might heare the sorrow of my hart,<br>
 Yet inly groning deepe and sighing oft,<br>
 Besought her to graunt ease vnto my smart,<br>
 And to my wound her gratious help impart.<br>
 Whilest thus I spake, behold with happy eye<br>
 I spyde, where at the Idoles feet apart<br>
 A beuie of fayre damzels close did lye,<br>
 Wayting when as the Antheme should be sung on hye.</p><p>
 
 The first of them did seeme of ryper yeares,<br>
 And grauer countenance then all the rest;<br>
 Yet all the rest were eke her equall peares,<br>
 Yet vnto her obayed all the best.<br>
 Her name was <i>VVomanhood</i>, that she exprest<br>
 By her sad semblant and demeanure wyse:<br>
 For stedfast still her eyes did fixed rest,<br>
 Ne rov'd at randon after gazers guyse,<br>
 Whose luring baytes oftimes doe heedlesse harts entyse.</p><p>
 
 And next to her sate goodly <i>Shamefastnesse</i>,<br>
 Ne euer durst her eyes from ground vpreare,<br>
 Ne euer once did looke vp from her desse,<br>
 As if some blame of euill she did feare,<br>
 That in her cheekes made roses oft appeare:<br>
 And her against sweet <i>Cherefulnesse</i> was placed,<br>
 Whose eyes like twinkling stars in euening cleare,<br>
 Were deckt with smyles, that all sad humors chaced,<br>
 And darted forth delights, the which her goodly graced.</p><p>
 
 And next to her sate sober <i>Modestie</i>,<br>
 Holding her hand vpon her gentle hart;<br>
 And her against sate comely <i>Curtesie</i>,<br>
 That vnto euery person knew her part;<br>
 And her before was seated ouerthwart<br>
 Soft <i>Silence</i>, and submisse <i>Obedience</i>,<br>
 Both linckt together neuer to dispart,<br>
 Both gifts of God not gotten but from thence,<br>
 Both girlonds of his Saints against their foes offence.</p><p>
 
 Thus sate they all a round in seemely rate:<br>
 And in the midst of them a goodly mayd,<br>
 Euen in the lap of <i>VVomanhood</i> there sate,<br>
 The which was all in lilly white arayd,<br>
 With siluer streames amongst the linnen stray'd;<br>
 Like to the Morne, when first her shyning face<br>
 Hath to the gloomy world it selfe bewray'd,<br>
 That same was fayrest <i>Amoret</i> in place,<br>
 Shyning with beauties light, and heauenly vertues grace.</p><p>
 
 Whom soone as I beheld, my hart gan throb,<br>
 And wade in doubt, what best were to be donne:<br>
 For sacrilege me seem'd the Church to rob,<br>
 And folly seem'd to leaue the thing vndonne,<br>
 Which with so strong attempt I had begonne.<br>
 Tho shaking off all doubt and shamefast feare,<br>
 Which Ladies loue I heard had neuer wonne<br>
 Mongst men of worth, I to her stepped neare,<br>
 And by the lilly hand her labour'd vp to reare.</p><p>
 
 Thereat that formost matrone me did blame,<br>
 And sharpe rebuke, for being ouer bold;<br>
 Saying it was to Knight vnseemely shame,<br>
 Vpon a recluse Virgin to lay hold,<br>
 That vnto <i>Venus</i> seruices was sold.<br>
 To whom I thus, Nay but it fitteth best,<br>
 For <i>Cupids</i> man with <i>Venus</i> mayd to hold,<br>
 For ill your goddesse seruices are drest<br>
 By virgins, and her sacrifices let to rest.</p><p>
 
 With that my shield I forth to her did show,<br>
 Which all that while I closely had conceld;<br>
 On which when <i>Cupid</i> with his killing bow<br>
 And cruell shafts emblazond she beheld,<br>
 At sight thereof she was with terror queld,<br>
 And said no more: but I which all that while<br>
 The pledge of faith, her hand engaged held,<br>
 Like warie Hynd within the weedie soyle,<br>
 For no intreatie would forgoe so glorious spoyle.</p><p>
 
 And euermore vpon the Goddesse face<br>
 Mine eye was fixt, for feare of her offence:<br>
 Whom when I saw with amiable grace<br>
 To laugh at me, and fauour my pretence,<br>
 I was emboldned with more confidence;<br>
 And nought for nicenesse nor for enuy sparing,<br>
 In presence of them all forth led her thence:<br>
 All looking on, and like astonisht staring,<br>
 Yet to lay hand on her, not one of all them daring.</p><p>
 
 She often prayd, and often me besought,<br>
 Sometime with tender teares to let her goe,<br>
 Sometime with witching smyles: but yet for nought,<br>
 That euer she to me could say or doe,<br>
 Could she her wished freedome fro me wooe;<br>
 But forth I led her through the Temple gate,<br>
 By which I hardly past with much adoe:<br>
 But that same Ladie which me friended late<br>
 In entrance, did me also friend in my retrate.</p><p>
 
 No lesse did <i>Daunger</i> threaten me with dread,<br>
 When as he saw me, maugre all his powre,<br>
 That glorious spoyle of beautie with me lead,<br>
 Then <i>Cerberus</i>, when <i>Orpheus</i> did recoure<br>
 His Leman from the Stygian Princes boure.<br>
 But euermore my shield did me defend,<br>
 Against the storme of euery dreadfull stoure:<br>
 Thus safely with my loue I thence did wend.<br>
 So ended he his tale, where I this Canto end.</p><p>
