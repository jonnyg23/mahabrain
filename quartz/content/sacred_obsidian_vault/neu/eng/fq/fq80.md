 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Pealing, from</i> Ioue, <i>to</i> Natur's <i>Bar,</i><br>
 <i>bold </i>Alteration<i> pleades<br>
 Large Euidence: but </i>Nature<i> soone<br>
 her righteous Doome arades.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 A
 H! whither doost thou now thou greater Muse<br>
 Me from these woods &amp; pleasing forrests bring?<br>
 And my fraile spirit (that dooth oft refuse<br>
 This too high flight, vnfit for her weake wing)<br>
 Lift vp aloft, to tell of heauens King<br>
 (Thy soueraine Sire) his fortunate successe,<br>
 And victory, in bigger noates to sing,<br>
 Which he obtain'd against that <i>Titanesse</i>,<br>
 That him of heauens Empire sought to dispossesse.<p>
 
 Yet sith I needs must follow thy behest,<br>
 Doe thou my weaker wit with skill inspire,<br>
 Fit for this turne ; and in my sable brest<br>
 Kindle fresh sparks of that immortall fire,<br>
 Which learned minds inflameth with desire<br>
 Of heauenly things: for, who but thou alone,<br>
 That art yborne of heauen and heauenly Sire,<br>
 Can tell things doen in heauen so long ygone:<br>
 So farre past memory of man that may be knowne.</p><p>
 
 Now, at the time that was before agreed,<br>
 The Gods assembled all on <i>Arlo</i> hill;<br>
 As well those that are sprung of heauenly seed,<br>
 As those that all the other world doe fill,<br>
 And rule both sea and land vnto their will:<br>
 Onely th'infernall Powers might not appeare;<br>
 Aswell for horror of their count'naunce ill,<br>
 As for th'vnruly fiends which they did feare;<br>
 Yet <i>Pluto</i> and <i>Proserpina</i> were present there.</p><p>
 
 And thither also came all other creatures,<br>
 What-euer life or motion doe retaine,<br>
 According to their sundry kinds of features;<br>
 That <i>Arlo</i> scarsly could them all containe;<br>
 So full they filled euery hill and Plaine:<br>
 And had not <i>Natures</i> Sergeant (that is <i>Order</i>)<br>
 Them well disposed by his busie paine,<br>
 And raunged farre abroad in euery border,<br>
 They would haue caused much confusion and disorder.</p><p>
 
 Then forth issewed (great goddesse) great dame <i>Nature</i>,<br>
 With goodly port and gracious Maiesty;<br>
 Being far greater and more tall of stature<br>
 Then any of the gods or Powers on hie:<br>
 Yet certes by her face and physnomy,<br>
 Whether she man or woman inly were,<br>
 That could not any creature well descry:<br>
 For, with a veile that wimpled euery where,<br>
 Her head and face was hid, that mote to none appeare</p><p>
 
 That some doe say was so by skill deuized,<br>
 To hide the terror of her vncouth hew,<br>
 From mortall eyes that should be sore agrized;<br>
 For that her face did like a Lion shew,<br>
 That eye of wight could not indure to view:<br>
 But others tell that it so beautious was,<br>
 And round about such beames of splendor threw,<br>
 That it the Sunne a thousand times did pass,<br>
 Ne could be seene, but like an image in a glass.</p><p>
 
 That well may seemen true: for, well I weene<br>
 That this same day, when she on <i>Arlo</i> sat,<br>
 Her garment was so bright and wondrous sheene,<br>
 That my fraile wit cannot deuize to what<br>
 It to compare, nor finde like stuffe to that,<br>
 As those three sacred <i>Saints</i>, though else most wise,<br>
 Yet on mount <i>Thabor</i> quite their wits forgat,<br>
 When they their glorious Lord in strange disguise<br>
 Transfigur'd sawe; his garments so did daze their eyes.</p><p>
 
 In a fayre Plaine vpon an equall Hill,<br>
 She placed was in a pauilion;<br>
 Not such as Craftes-men by their idle skill<br>
 Are wont for Princes states to fashion:<br>
 But th'earth her self of her owne motion,<br>
 Out of her fruitfull bosome made to growe<br>
 Most dainty trees; that, shooting vp anon,<br>
 Did seeme to bow their bloosming heads full lowe,<br>
 For homage vnto her, and like a throne did shew.</p><p>
 
 So hard it is for any liuing wight,<br>
 All her array and vestiments to tell,<br>
 That old <i>Dan Geffrey</i> (in whose gentle spright<br>
 The pure well head of Poesie did dwell)<br>
 In his <i>Foules parley</i> durst not with it mel,<br>
 But it transferd to <i>Alane</i>, who he thought<br>
 Had in his <i>Plaint of kindes</i> describ'd it well:<br>
 Which who will read set forth so as it ought,<br>
 Go seek he out that <i>Alane</i> where he may be sought.</p><p>
 
 And all the earth far vnderneath her feete<br>
 Was dight with flowres, that voluntary grew<br>
 Out of the ground, and sent forth odours sweet;<br>
 Tenne thousand mores of sundry sent and hew,<br>
 That might delight the smell, or please the view:<br>
 The which, the Nymphes, from all the brooks thereby<br>
 Had gathered, which they at her foot-stoole threw;<br>
 That richer seem'd then any tapestry,<br>
 That Princes bowres adorne with painted imagery.</p><p>
 
 And <i>Mole</i> himselfe, to honour her the more,<br>
 Did deck himself in freshest faire attire,<br>
 And his high head, that seemeth alwaies hore<br>
 With hardned frosts of former winters ire,<br>
 He with an Oaken girlond now did tire,<br>
 As if the loue of some new Nymph late seene,<br>
 Had in him kindled youthfull fresh desire,<br>
 And made him change his gray attire to greene;<br>
 Ah gentle <i>Mole</i>! such ioyance hath thee well beseene.</p><p>
 
 Was neuer so great ioyance since the day,<br>
 That all the gods whylome assembled were,<br>
 On <i>Hæmus</i> hill in their diuine array,<br>
 To celebrate the solemne bridall cheare,<br>
 Twixt <i>Peleus</i>, and dame <i>Thetis</i> pointed there;<br>
 Where <i>Phoebus</i> self, that god of Poets hight,<br>
 They say did sing the spousall hymne full cleere,<br>
 That all the gods were rauisht with delight<br>
 Of his celestiall song, &amp; Musicks wondrous might.</p><p>
 
 This great Grandmother of all creatures bred<br>
 Great <i>Nature</i>, euer young yet full of eld,<br>
 Still moouing, yet vnmoued from her sted;<br>
 Vnseene of any, yet of all beheld;<br>
 Thus sitting in her throne as I haue teld,<br>
 Before her came dame <i>Mutabilitie</i>;<br>
 And being lowe before her presence feld,<br>
 With meek obaysance and humilitie,<br>
 Thus gan her plaintif Plea, with words to amplifie;</p><p>
 
 To thee ô greatest goddesse, onely great,<br>
 An humble suppliant loe, I lowely fly<br>
 Seeking for Right, which I of thee entreat;<br>
 Who Right to all dost deale indifferently,<br>
 Damning all Wrong and tortious Iniurie,<br>
 Which any of thy creatures doe to other<br>
 (Oppressing them with power, vnequally)<br>
 Sith of them all thou art the equall mother,<br>
 And knittest each to each, as brother vnto brother.</p><p>
 
 To thee therefore of this same <i>Ioue</i> I plaine,<br>
 And of his fellow gods that faine to be,<br>
 That challenge to themselues the whole worlds raign;<br>
 Of which, the greatest part is due to me,<br>
 And heauen it selfe by heritage in Fee:<br>
 For, heauen and earth I both alike do deeme,<br>
 Sith heauen and earth are both alike to thee;<br>
 And, gods no more then men thou doest esteeme:<br>
 For, euen the gods to thee, as men to gods do seeme.</p><p>
 
 Then weigh, ô soueraigne goddesse, by what right<br>
 These gods do claime the worlds whole souerainty;<br>
 And that is onely dew vnto thy might<br>
 Arrogate to themselues ambitiously:<br>
 As for the gods owne principality,<br>
 Which <i>Ioue</i> vsurpes vniustly; that to be<br>
 My heritage, <i>Ioue's</i> self cannot deny,<br>
 From my great Grandsire <i>Titan</i>, vnto mee,<br>
 Deriv'd by dew descent; as is well knowen to thee.</p><p>
 
 Yet mauger <i>Ioue</i>, and all his gods beside,<br>
 I doe possesse the worlds most regiment;<br>
 As, if ye please it into parts diuide,<br>
 And euery parts inholders to conuent,<br>
 Shall to your eyes appeare incontinent.<br>
 And first, the Earth (great mother of vs all)<br>
 That only seems vnmov'd and permanent,<br>
 And vnto <i>Mutability</i> not thrall;<br>
 Yet is she chang'd in part, and eeke in generall.</p><p>
 
 For, all that from her springs, and is ybredde,<br>
 How-euer fayre it flourish for a time,<br>
 Yet see we soone decay; and, being dead<br>
 To turne again vnto their earthly slime:<br>
 Yet, out of their decay and mortall crime,<br>
 We daily see new creatures to arize;<br>
 And of their Winter spring another Prime,<br>
 Vnlike in forme, and chang'd by strange disguise:<br>
 So turne they still about, and change in restlesse wise.</p><p>
 
 As for her tenants; that is, man and beasts,<br>
 The beasts we daily see massacred dy,<br>
 As thralls and vassalls vnto mens beheasts:<br>
 And men themselues doe change continually,<br>
 From youth to eld, from wealth to pouerty,<br>
 From good to bad, from bad to worst of all.<br>
 Ne doe their bodies only flit and fly:<br>
 But eeke their minds (which they immortall call)<br>
 Still change and vary thoughts, as new occasions fall.</p><p>
 
 Ne is the water in more constant case;<br>
 Whether those same on high, or these belowe.<br>
 For, th'Ocean moueth stil, from place to place;<br>
 And euery Riuer still doth ebbe and flowe:<br>
 Ne any Lake, that seems most still and slowe,<br>
 Ne Poole so small, that can his smoothnesse holde,<br>
 When any winde doth vnder heauen blowe;<br>
 With which, the clouds are also tost and roll'd;<br>
 Now like great Hills; &amp;, streight, like sluces, them vnfold.</p><p>
 
 So likewise are all watry liuing wights<br>
 Still tost, and turned, with continuall change<br>
 Neuer abyding in their stedfast plights.<br>
 The fish, still floting, doe at randon range,<br>
 And neuer rest; but euermore exchange<br>
 Their dwelling places, as the streames them carrie:<br>
 Ne haue the watry foules a certaine grange,<br>
 Wherein to rest, ne in one stead do tarry;<br>
 But flitting still doe flie, and still their places vary.</p><p>
 
 Next is the Ayre: which who feeles not by sense<br>
 (For, of all sense it is the middle meane)<br>
 To flit still? and, with subtill influence<br>
 Of his thin spirit, all creatures to maintaine,<br>
 In state of life?  O weake life! that does leane<br>
 On thing so tickle as th'vnsteady ayre;<br>
 Which euery howre is chang'd, and altred cleane<br>
 With euery blast that bloweth fowle or faire:<br>
 The faire doth it prolong; the fowle doth it impaire.</p><p>
 
 Therein the changes infinite beholde,<br>
 Which to her creatures euery minute chaunce;<br>
 Now, boyling hot: streight, friezing deadly cold:<br>
 Now, faire sun-shine, that makes all skip and daunce:<br>
 Streight, bitter storms and balefull countenance,<br>
 That makes them all to shiuer and to shake:<br>
 Rayne, hayle, and snowe do pay them sad penance,<br>
 And dreadfull thunder-claps (that make them quake)<br>
 With flames &amp; flashing lights that thousand changes make.</p><p>
 
 Last is the fire: which, though it liue for euer,<br>
 Ne can be quenched quite; yet, euery day,<br>
 Wee see his parts, so soone as they do seuer,<br>
 To lose their heat, and shortly to decay;<br>
 So, makes himself his owne consuming pray.<br>
 Ne any liuing creatures doth he breed:<br>
 But all, that are of others bredd, doth slay;<br>
 And, with their death, his cruell life dooth feed;<br>
 Nought leauing, but their barren ashes, without seede.</p><p>
 
 Thus, all these fower (the which the ground-work bee<br>
 Of all the world, and of all liuing wights)<br>
 To thousand sorts of <i>Change</i> we subiect see:<br>
 Yet are they chang'd (by other wondrous slights)<br>
 Into themselues, and lose their natiue mights;<br>
 The Fire to Aire, and th'Ayre to Water sheere,<br>
 And Water into Earth : yet Water fights<br>
 With Fire, and Aire with Earth approaching neere:<br>
 Yet all are in one body, and as one appeare.</p><p>
 
 So, in them all raignes <i>Mutabilitie</i>;<br>
 How-euer these, that Gods themselues do call,<br>
 Of them doe claime the rule and souerainty:<br>
 As, <i>Vesta</i>, of the fire æthereall;<br>
 <i>Vulcan</i>, of this, with vs so vsuall;<br>
 <i>Ops</i>, of the earth; and <i>Iuno</i> of the Ayre;<br>
 <i>Neptune</i>, of Seas; and Nymphes, of Riuers all.<br>
 For, all those Riuers to me subiect are:<br>
 And all the rest, which they vsurp, be all my share.</p><p>
 
 Which to approuen true, as I haue told,<br>
 Vouchsafe, ô goddesse, to thy presence call<br>
 The rest which doe the world in being hold:<br>
 As, times and seasons of the yeare that fall:<br>
 Of all the which, demand in generall,<br>
 Or iudge thy selfe, by verdit of thine eye,<br>
 Whether to me they are not subiect all.<br>
 <i>Nature</i> did yeeld thereto; and by-and-by,<br>
 Bade <i>Order</i> call them all, before her Maiesty.</p><p>
 
 So, forth issew'd the Seasons of the yeare;<br>
 First, lusty <i>Spring</i>, all dight in leaues of flowres<br>
 That freshly budded and new bloosmes did beare<br>
 (In which a thousand birds had built their bowres<br>
 That sweetly sung, to call forth Paramours):<br>
 And in his hand a iauelin he did beare,<br>
 And on his head (as fit for warlike stoures)<br>
 A guilt engrauen morion he did weare;<br>
 That as some did him loue, so others did him feare.</p><p>
 
 Then came the iolly <i>Sommer</i>, being dight<br>
 In a thin silken cassock coloured greene,<br>
 That was vnlyned all, to be more light:<br>
 And on his head a girlond well beseene<br>
 He wore, from which as he had chauffed been<br>
 The sweat did drop; and in his hand he bore<br>
 A boawe and shaftes, as he in forrest greene<br>
 Had hunted late the Libbard or the Bore,<br>
 And now would bathe his limbes, with labor heated sore.</p><p>
 
 Then came the <i>Autumne</i> all in yellow clad,<br>
 As though he ioyed in his plentious store,<br>
 Laden with fruits that made him laugh, full glad<br>
 That he had banisht hunger, which to-fore<br>
 Had by the belly oft him pinched sore.<br>
 Vpon his head a wreath that was enrold<br>
 With eares of corne, of euery sort he bore:<br>
 And in his hand a sickle he did holde,<br>
 To reape the ripened fruits the which the earth had yold.</p><p>
 
 Lastly, came <i>Winter</i> cloathed all in frize,<br>
 Chattering his teeth for cold that did him chill,<br>
 Whil'st on his hoary beard his breath did freese;<br>
 And the dull drops that from his purpled bill<br>
 As from a limbeck did adown distill.<br>
 In his right hand a tipped staffe he held,<br>
 With which his feeble steps he stayed still:<br>
 For, he was faint with cold, and weak with eld;<br>
 That scarse his loosed limbes he hable was to weld.</p><p>
 
 These, marching softly, thus in order went,<br>
 And after them, the Monthes all riding came;<br>
 First, sturdy <i>March</i> with brows full sternly bent,<br>
 And armed strongly, rode vpon a Ram,<br>
 The same which ouer <i>Hellespontus</i> swam:<br>
 Yet in his hand a spade he also hent,<br>
 And in a bag all sorts of seeds ysame,<br>
 Which on the earth he strowed as he went,<br>
 And fild her womb with fruitfull hope of nourishment.</p><p>
 
 Next came fresh <i>Aprill</i> full of lustyhed,<br>
 And wanton as a Kid whose horne new buds:<br>
 Vpon a Bull he rode, the same which led<br>
 <i>Europa</i> floting through th'<i>Argolick</i> fluds:<br>
 His hornes were gilden all with golden studs<br>
 And garnished with garlonds goodly dight<br>
 Of all the fairest flowres and freshest buds<br>
 Which th'earth brings forth, and wet he seem'd in sight<br>
 With waues, through which he waded for his loues delight.</p><p>
 
 Then came faire <i>May</i>, the fayrest mayd on ground,<br>
 Deckt all with dainties of her seasons pryde,<br>
 And throwing flowres out of her lap around:<br>
 Vpon two brethrens shoulders she did ride,<br>
 The twinnes of <i>Leda</i>; which on eyther side<br>
 Supported her like to their soueraine Queene.<br>
 Lord! how all creatures laught, when her they spide,<br>
 And leapt and daunc't as they had rauisht beene!<br>
 And <i>Cupid</i> selfe about her fluttred all in greene.</p><p>
 
 And after her, came iolly <i>Iune</i>, arrayd<br>
 All in greene leaues, as he a Player were;<br>
 Yet in his time, he wrought as well as playd,<br>
 That by his plough-yrons mote right well appeare:<br>
 Vpon a Crab he rode, that him did beare<br>
 With crooked crawling steps an vncouth pase,<br>
 And backward yode, as Bargemen wont to fare<br>
 Bending their force contrary to their face,<br>
 Like that vngracious crew which faines demurest grace.</p><p>
 
 Then came hot <i>Iuly</i> boyling like to fire,<br>
 That all his garments he had cast away:<br>
 Vpon a Lyon raging yet with ire<br>
 He boldly rode and made him to obay:<br>
 It was the beast that whylome did forray<br>
 The Nemaean forrest, till th'<i>Amphytrionide</i><br>
 Him slew, and with his hide did him array;<br>
 Behinde his back a sithe, and by his side<br>
 Vnder his belt he bore a sickle circling wide.</p><p>
 
 The sixt was <i>August</i>, being rich arrayd<br>
 In garment all of gold downe to the ground:<br>
 Yet rode he not, but led a louely Mayd<br>
 Forth by the lilly hand, the which was cround<br>
 With eares of corne, and full her hand was found;<br>
 That was the righteous Virgin, which of old<br>
 Liv'd here on earth, and plenty made abound;<br>
 But, after Wrong was lov'd and Iustice solde,<br>
 She left th'vnrighteous world and was to heauen extold.</p><p>
 
 Next him, <i>September</i> marched eeke on foote;<br>
 Yet was he heauy laden with the spoyle<br>
 Of haruests riches, which he made his boot,<br>
 And him enricht with bounty of the soyle:<br>
 In his one hand, as fit for haruests toyle,<br>
 He held a knife-hook; and in th'other hand<br>
 A paire of waights, with which he did assoyle<br>
 Both more and lesse, where it in doubt did stand,<br>
 And equall gaue to each as Iustice duly scann'd.</p><p>
 
 Then came <i>October</i> full of merry glee:<br>
 For, yet his noule was totty of the must,<br>
 Which he was treading in the wine-fats see,<br>
 And of the ioyous oyle, whose gentle gust<br>
 Made him so frollick and so full of lust:<br>
 Vpon a dreadfull Scorpion he did ride,<br>
 The same which by <i>Dianaes</i> doom vniust<br>
 Slew great <i>Orion:</i> and eeke by his side<br>
 He had his ploughing share, and coulter ready tyde.</p><p>
 
 Next was <i>Nouember</i>, he full grosse and fat,<br>
 As fed with lard, and that right well might seeme;<br>
 For, he had been a fatting hogs of late,<br>
 That yet his browes with sweat, did reek and steem,<br>
 And yet the season was full sharp and breem;<br>
 In planting eeke he took no small delight:<br>
 Whereon he rode, not easie was to deeme;<br>
 For it a dreadfull <i>Centaure</i> was in sight,<br>
 The seed of <i>Saturne</i>, and faire <i>Nais, Chiron</i> hight,</p><p>
 
 And after him, came next the chill <i>December:</i><br>
 Yet he through merry feasting which he made,<br>
 And great bonfires, did not the cold remember;<br>
 His Sauiours birth his mind so much did glad:<br>
 Vpon a shaggy-bearded Goat he rode,<br>
 The same wherewith <i>Dan Ioue</i> in tender yeares,<br>
 They say, was nourisht by th'<i>I[d]oean</i> mayd;<br>
 And in his hand a broad deepe boawle he beares;<br>
 Of which, he freely drinks an health to all his peeres.</p><p>
 
 Then came old <i>Ianuary</i>, wrapped well<br>
 In many weeds to keep the cold away;<br>
 Yet did he quake and quiuer like to quell,<br>
 And blowe his nayles to warme them if he may:<br>
 For, they were numbd with holding all the day<br>
 An hatchet keene, with which he felled wood,<br>
 And from the trees did lop the needlesse spray:<br>
 Vpon an huge great Earth-pot steane he stood;<br>
 From whose wide mouth, there flowed forth the Romane floud.</p><p>
 
 And lastly, came cold <i>February</i>, sitting<br>
 In an old wagon, for he could not ride;<br>
 Drawne of two fishes for the season fitting,<br>
 Which through the flood before did softly slyde<br>
 And swim away: yet had he by his side<br>
 His plough and harnesse fit to till the ground,<br>
 And tooles to prune the trees, before the pride<br>
 Of hasting Prime did make them burgein round:<br>
 So past the twelue Months forth, &amp; their dew places found.</p><p>
 
 And after these, there came the <i>Day</i>, and <i>Night</i>,<br>
 Riding together both with equall pace,<br>
 Th'one on a Palfrey blacke, the other white;<br>
 But <i>Night</i> had couered her vncomely face<br>
 With a blacke veile, and held in hand a mace,<br>
 On top whereof the moon and stars were pight,<br>
 And sleep and darknesse round about did trace:<br>
 But <i>Day</i> did beare, vpon his scepters hight,<br>
 The goodly Sun, encompast all with beames bright.</p><p>
 
 Then came the <i>Howres</i>, faire daughters of high <i>Ioue</i>,<br>
 And timely <i>Night</i>, the which were all endewed<br>
 With wondrous beauty fit to kindle loue;<br>
 But they were Virgins all, and loue eschewed,<br>
 That might forslack the charge to them fore-shewed<br>
 By mighty <i>Ioue</i>; who did them Porters make<br>
 Of heauens gate (whence all the gods issued)<br>
 Which they did dayly watch, and nightly wake<br>
 By euen turnes, ne euer did their charge forsake.</p><p>
 
 And after all came <i>Life</i>, and lastly <i>Death</i>;<br>
 <i>Death</i> with most grim and griesly visage seene,<br>
 Yet is he nought but parting of the breath;<br>
 Ne ought to see, but like a shade to weene,<br>
 Vnbodied, vnsoul'd, vnheard, vnseene.<br>
 But <i>Life</i> was like a faire young lusty boy,<br>
 Such as they faine <i>Dan Cupid</i> to haue beene,<br>
 Full of delightfull health and liuely ioy.<br>
 Deckt all with flowres, and wings of gold fit to employ.</p><p>
 
 When these were past, thus gan the <i>Titanesse</i>;<br>
 Lo, mighty mother, now be iudge and say,<br>
 Whether in all thy creatures more or lesse<br>
 <i>CHANGE</i> doth not raign &amp; beare the greatest sway:<br>
 For, who sees not, that <i>Time</i> on all doth pray?<br>
 But <i>Times</i> do change and moue continually.<br>
 So nothing here long standeth in one stay:<br>
 Wherefore, this lower world who can deny<br>
 But to be subiect still to <i>Mutabilitie?</i></p><p>
 
 Then thus gan <i>Ioue</i>; Right true it is, that these<br>
 And all things else that vnder heauen dwell<br>
 Are chaung'd of <i>Time</i>, who doth them all disseise<br>
 Of being : But, who is it (to me tell)<br>
 That <i>Time</i> himselfe doth moue and still compell<br>
 To keepe his course?  Is not that namely wee<br>
 Which poure that vertue from our heauenly cell,<br>
 That moues them all, and makes them changed be?<br>
 So them we gods doe rule, and in them also thee.</p><p>
 
 To whom, thus <i>Mutability</i>: The things<br>
 Which we see not how they are mov'd and swayd,<br>
 Ye may attribute to your selues as Kings,<br>
 And say they by your secret powre are made:<br>
 But what we see not, who shall vs perswade?<br>
 But were they so, as ye them faine to be,<br>
 Mov'd by your might, and ordred by your ayde;<br>
 Yet what if I can proue, that euen yee<br>
 Your selues are likewise chang'd, and subiect vnto mee?</p><p>
 
 And first, concerning her that is the first,<br>
 Euen you faire <i>Cynthia</i>, whom so much ye make<br>
 <i>Ioues</i> dearest darling, she was bred and nurst<br>
 On <i>Cynthus</i> hill, whence she her name did take:<br>
 Then is she mortall borne, how-so ye crake;<br>
 Besides, her face and countenance euery day<br>
 We changed see, and sundry forms partake,<br>
 Now hornd, now ro&amp;utild;d, now bright, now brown &amp; gray:<br>
 So that <i>as changefull as the Moone</i> men vse to say.</p><p>
 
 Next, <i>Mercury</i>, who though he lesse appeare<br>
 To change his hew, and alwayes seeme as one;<br>
 Yet, he his course doth altar euery yeare,<br>
 And is of late far out of order gone:<br>
 So <i>Venus</i> eeke, that goodly Paragone,<br>
 Though faire all night, yet is she darke all day;<br>
 And <i>Phoebus</i> self, who lightsome is alone,<br>
 Yet is he oft eclipsed by the way,<br>
 And fills the darkned world with terror and dismay.</p><p>
 
 Now <i>Mars</i> that valiant man is changed most:<br>
 For, he some times so far runs out of square,<br>
 That he his way doth seem quite to haue lost,<br>
 And cleane without his vsuall sphere to fare;<br>
 That euen these Star-gazers stonisht are<br>
 At sight thereof, and damne their lying bookes:<br>
 So likewise, grim Sir <i>Saturne</i> oft doth spare<br>
 His sterne aspect, and calme his crabbed lookes:<br>
 So many turning cranks these haue, so many crookes.</p><p>
 
 But you <i>Dan Ioue</i>, that only constant are,<br>
 And King of all the rest, as ye do clame,<br>
 Are you not subiect eeke to this misfare?<br>
 Then let me aske you this withouten blame,<br>
 Where were ye borne? some say in <i>Crete</i> by name,<br>
 Others in <i>Thebes</i>, and others other-where;<br>
 But wheresoeuer they comment the same,<br>
 They all consent that ye begotten were,<br>
 And borne here in this world, ne other can appeare.</p><p>
 
 Then are ye mortall borne, and thrall to me,<br>
 Vnlesse the kingdome of the sky yee make<br>
 Immortall, and vnchangeable to bee;<br>
 Besides, that power and vertue which ye spake,<br>
 That ye here worke, doth many changes take,<br>
 And your owne natures change: for, each of you<br>
 That vertue haue, or this, or that to make,<br>
 Is checkt and changed from his nature trew,<br>
 By others opposition or obliquid view.</p><p>
 
 Besides, the sundry motions of your Spheares,<br>
 So sundry waies and fashions as clerkes faine,<br>
 Some in short space, and some in longer yeares;<br>
 What is the same but alteration plaine?<br>
 Onely the starrie skie doth still remaine:<br>
 Yet do the Starres and Signes therein still moue,<br>
 And euen it self is mov'd, as wizards saine.<br>
 But all that moueth, doth mutation loue:<br>
 Therefore both you and them to me I subiect proue.</p><p>
 
 Then since within this wide great <i>Vniuerse</i><br>
 Nothing doth firme and permanent appeare,<br>
 But all things tost and turned by transuerse:<br>
 What then should let, but I aloft should reare<br>
 My Trophee, and from all, the triumph beare?<br>
 Now iudge then (O thou greatest goddesse trew!)<br>
 According as thy selfe doest see and heare,<br>
 And vnto me addoom that is my dew;<br>
 That is the rule of all, all being rul'd by you.</p><p>
 
 So hauing ended, silence long ensewed,<br>
 Ne <i>Nature</i> to or fro spake for a space,<br>
 But with firme eyes affixt, the ground still viewed.<br>
 Meane while, all creatures, looking in her face,<br>
 Expecting th'end of this so doubtfull case,<br>
 Did hang in long suspence what would ensew,<br>
 To whether side should fall the soueraigne place:<br>
 At length, she looking vp with chearefull view,<br>
 The silence brake, and gaue her doome in speeches few.</p><p>
 
 I well consider all that ye haue sayd,<br>
 And find that all things stedfastnes doe hate<br>
 And changed be: yet being rightly wayd<br>
 They are not changed from their first estate;<br>
 But by their change their being doe dilate:<br>
 And turning to themselues at length againe,<br>
 Doe worke their owne perfection so by fate:<br>
 Then ouer them Change doth not rule and raigne;<br>
 But they raigne ouer change, and doe their states maintaine.</p><p>
 
 Cease therefore daughter further to aspire,<br>
 And thee content thus to be rul'd by me:<br>
 For thy decay thou seekst by thy desire;<br>
 But time shall come that all shall changed bee,<br>
 And from thenceforth, none no more change shall see.<br>
 So was the <i>Titaness</i> put downe and whist,<br>
 And <i>Ioue</i> confirm'd in his imperiall see.<br>
 Then was that whole assembly quite dismist,<br>
 And <i>Natur's</i> selfe did vanish, whither no man wist.</p><p>
