 <i>Britomart chaceth Ollyphant,<br>
 findes Scudamour distrest:<br>
 Assayes the house of Busyrane,<br>
 where Loues spoyles are exprest.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 O
  Hatefull hellish Snake, what furie furst<br>
 Brought thee from balefull house of <i>Proserpine</i>,<br>
 Where in her bosome she thee long had nurst,<br>
 And fostred vp with bitter milke of tine,<br>
 Fowle Gealosie, that turnest loue diuine<br>
 To ioylesse dread, and mak'st the louing hart<br>
 With hatefull thoughts to languish and to pine,<br>
 And feed it selfe with selfe-consuming smart?<br>
 Of all the passions in the mind thou vilest art.<p>
 
 O let him far be banished away,<br>
 And in his stead let Loue for euer dwell,<br>
 Sweet Loue, that doth his golding wings embay<br>
 In blessed Nectar, and pure Pleasures well,<br>
 Vntroubled of vile feare, or bitter fell.<br>
 And ye faire Ladies, that your kingdomes make<br>
 In th'harts of men, them gouerne wisely well,<br>
 And of faire <i>Britomart</i> ensample take,<br>
 That was as trew in loue, as Turtle to her make.</p><p>
 
 Who with Sir <i>Satyrane</i>, as earst ye red,<br>
 Forth ryding from <i>Malbeccoes</i> hostlesse hous,<br>
 Far off aspyde a young man, the which fled<br>
 From an huge Geaunt, that with hideous<br>
 And hatefull outrage long him chaced thus;<br>
 It was that <i>Ollyphant</i>, the brother deare<br>
 Of that <i>Argante</i> vile and vitious,<br>
 From whom the <i>Squire of Dames</i> was reft whylere;<br>
 This all as bad as she, and worse, if worse ought were.</p><p>
 
 For as the sister did in feminine<br>
 And filthy lust exceede all woman kind,<br>
 So he surpassed his sex masculine,<br>
 In beastly vse that I did euer find;<br>
 Whom when as <i>Britomart</i> beheld behind<br>
 The fearefull boy so greedily pursew,<br>
 She was emmoued in her noble mind,<br>
 T'employ her puissaunce to his reskew,<br>
 And pricked fiercely forward, where she him did vew.</p><p>
 
 Ne was Sir <i>Satyrane</i> her far behinde,<br>
 But with like fiercenesse did ensew the chace:<br>
 Whom when the Gyaunt saw, he soone resinde<br>
 His former suit, and from them fled apace;<br>
 They after both, and boldly bad him bace,<br>
 And each did striue the other to out-goe,<br>
 But he them both outran a wondrous space,<br>
 For he was long, and swift as any Roe,<br>
 And now made better speed, t'escape his feared foe.</p><p>
 
 It was not <i>Satyrane</i>, whom he did feare,<br>
 But <i>Britomart</i> the flowre of chastity;<br>
 For he the powre of chast hands might not beare,<br>
 But alwayes did their dread encounter fly:<br>
 And now so fast his feet he did apply,<br>
 That he has gotten to a forrest neare,<br>
 Where he is shrowded in security.<br>
 The wood they enter, and search euery where,<br>
 They searched diuersely, so both diuided were.</p><p>
 
 Faire <i>Britomart</i> so long him followed,<br>
 That she at last came to a fountaine sheare,<br>
 By which there lay a knight all wallowed<br>
 Vpon the grassy ground, and by him neare<br>
 His haberieon, his helmet, and his speare;<br>
 A little off, his shield was rudely throwne,<br>
 On which the winged boy in colours cleare<br>
 Depeincted was, full easie to be knowne,<br>
 And he thereby, where euer it in field was showne.</p><p>
 
 His face vpon the ground did groueling ly,<br>
 As if he had bene slombring in the shade,<br>
 That the braue Mayd would not for courtesy,<br>
 Out of his quiet slomber him abrade,<br>
 Nor seeme too suddeinly him to inuade:<br>
 Still as she stood, she heard with grieuous throb<br>
 Him grone, as if his hart were peeces made,<br>
 And with most painefull pangs to sigh and sob,<br>
 That pitty did the Virgins hart of patience rob.</p><p>
 
 At last forth breaking into bitter plaintes<br>
 He said; ô soueraigne Lord that sit'st on hye,<br>
 And raignst in blis emongst thy blessed Saintes,<br>
 How suffrest thou such shamefull cruelty,<br>
 So long vnwreaked of thine enimy?<br>
 Or hast thou, Lord, of good mens cause no heed?<br>
 Or doth thy iustice sleepe, and silent ly?<br>
 What booteth then the good and righteous deed,<br>
 If goodnesse find no grace, nor righteousnesse no meed?</p><p>
 
 If good find grace, and righteousnesse reward,<br>
 Why then is <i>Amoret</i> in caytiue band,<br>
 Sith that more bounteous creature neuer far'd<br>
 On foot, vpon the face of liuing land?<br>
 Or if that heauenly iustice may withstand<br>
 The wrongfull outrage of vnrighteous men,<br>
 Why then is <i>Busirane</i> with wicked hand<br>
 Suffred, these seuen monethes day in secret den<br>
 My Lady and my loue so cruelly to pen?</p><p>
 
 My Lady and my loue is cruelly pend<br>
 In dolefull darkenesse from the vew of day,<br>
 Whilest deadly torments do her chast brest rend,<br>
 And the sharpe steele doth riue her hart in tway,<br>
 All for she <i>Scudamore</i> will not denay.<br>
 Yet thou vile man, vile <i>Scudamore</i> art sound,<br>
 Ne canst her ayde, ne canst her foe dismay:<br>
 Vnworthy wretch to tread vpon the ground,<br>
 For whom so faire a Lady feeles so sore a wound.</p><p>
 
 There an huge heape of singulfes did oppresse<br>
 His strugling soule, and swelling throbs empeach<br>
 His foltring toung with pangs of drerinesse,<br>
 Choking the remnant of his plaintife speach,<br>
 As if his dayes were come to their last reach.<br>
 Which when she heard, and saw the ghastly fit,<br>
 Threatning into his life to make a breach,<br>
 Both with great ruth and terrour she was smit,<br>
 Fearing least from her cage the wearie soule would flit.</p><p>
 
 Tho stooping downe she him amoued light;<br>
 Who therewith somewhat starting, vp gan looke,<br>
 And seeing him behind a straunger knight,<br>
 Whereas no liuing creature he mistooke,<br>
 With great indignaunce he that sight forsooke,<br>
 And downe againe himselfe disdainefully<br>
 Abiecting, th'earth with his faire forhead strooke:<br>
 Which the bold Virgin seeing, gan apply<br>
 Fit medcine to his griefe, and spake thus courtesly.</p><p>
 
 Ah gentle knight, whose deepe conceiued griefe<br>
 Well seemes t'exceede the powre of patience,<br>
 Yet if that heauenly grace some good reliefe<br>
 You send, submit you to high prouidence,<br>
 And euer in your noble hart prepense,<br>
 That all the sorrow in the world is lesse,<br>
 Then vertues might, and values confidence,<br>
 For who nill bide the burden of distresse,<br>
 Must not here thinke to liue: for life is wretchednesse.</p><p>
 
 Therefore, faire Sir, do comfort to you take,<br>
 And freely read, what wicked felon so<br>
 Hath outrag'd you, and thrald your gentle make.<br>
 Perhaps this hand may helpe to ease your woe,<br>
 And wreake your sorrow on your cruell foe,<br>
 At least it faire endeuour will apply.<br>
 Those feeling wordes so neare the quicke did goe,<br>
 That vp his head he reared easily,<br>
 And leaning on his elbow, these few wordes let fly.</p><p>
 
 What boots it plaine, that cannot be redrest,<br>
 And sow vaine sorrow in a fruitlesse eare,<br>
 Sith powre of hand, nor skill of learned brest,<br>
 Ne worldly price cannot redeeme my deare,<br>
 Out of her thraldome and continuall feare?<br>
 For he the tyraunt, which her hath in ward<br>
 By strong enchauntments and blacke Magicke leare,<br>
 Hath in a dungeon deepe her close embard,<br>
 And many dreadfull feends hath pointed to her gard.</p><p>
 
 There he tormenteth her most terribly,<br>
 And day and night afflicts with mortall paine,<br>
 Because to yield him loue she doth deny,<br>
 Once to me yold, not to be yold againe:<br>
 But yet by torture he would her constraine<br>
 Loue to conceiue in her disdainfull brest;<br>
 Till so she do, she must in doole remaine,<br>
 Ne may by liuing meanes be thence relest:<br>
 What boots it then to plaine, that cannot be redrest?</p><p>
 
 With this sad hersall of his heauy stresse,<br>
 The warlike Damzell was empassiond sore,<br>
 And said; Sir knight, your cause is nothing lesse,<br>
 Then is your sorrow, certes if not more;<br>
 For nothing so much pitty doth implore,<br>
 As gentle Ladies helplesse misery.<br>
 But yet, if please ye listen to my lore,<br>
 I will with proofe of last extremity,<br>
 Deliuer her fro thence, or with her for you dy.</p><p>
 
 Ah gentlest knight aliue, (said <i>Scudamore</i>)<br>
 What huge heroicke magnanimity<br>
 Dwels in thy bounteous brest? what couldst thou more,<br>
 If she were thine, and thou as now am I?<br>
 O spare thy happy dayes, and them apply<br>
 To better boot, but let me dye, that ought;<br>
 More is more losse: one is enough to dy.<br>
 Life is not lost, (said she) for which is bought<br>
 Endlesse renowm, that more then death is to be sought.</p><p>
 
 Thus she at length perswaded him to rise,<br>
 And with her wend, to see what new successe<br>
 Mote him befall vpon new enterprise;<br>
 His armes, which he had vowed to disprofesse,<br>
 She gathered vp and did about him dresse,<br>
 And his forwandred steed vnto him got:<br>
 So forth they both yfere make their progresse,<br>
 And march not past the mountenaunce of a shot.<br>
 Till they arriu'd, whereas their purpose they did plot.</p><p>
 
 There they dismounting, drew their weapons bold<br>
 And stoutly came vnto the Castle gate;<br>
 Whereas no gate they found, them to withhold,<br>
 Nor ward to wait at morne and euening late,<br>
 But in the Porch, that did them sore amate,<br>
 A flaming fire, ymixt with smouldry smoke,<br>
 And stinking Sulphure, that with griesly hate<br>
 And dreadfull horrour did all entraunce choke,<br>
 Enforced them their forward footing to reuoke.</p><p>
 
 Greatly thereat was <i>Britomart</i> dismayd,<br>
 Ne in that stownd wist, how her selfe to beare;<br>
 For daunger vaine it were, to haue assayd<br>
 That cruell element, which all things feare,<br>
 Ne none can suffer to approchen neare:<br>
 And turning backe to <i>Scudamour</i>, thus sayd;<br>
 What monstrous enmity prouoke we heare,<br>
 Foolhardy as th'Earthes children, the which made<br>
 Battell against the Gods? so we a God inuade.</p><p>
 
 Daunger without discretion to attempt,<br>
 Inglorious and beastlike is: therefore Sir knight,<br>
 Aread what course of you is safest dempt,<br>
 And how we with our foe may come to fight.<br>
 This is (quoth he) the dolorous despight,<br>
 Which earst to you I playnd: for neither may<br>
 This fire be quencht by any wit or might,<br>
 Ne yet by any meanes remou'd away,<br>
 So mighty be th'enchauntments, which the same do stay.</p><p>
 
 What is there else, but cease these fruitlesse paines,<br>
 And leaue me to my former languishing;<br>
 Faire <i>Amoret</i> must dwell in wicked chaines,<br>
 And <i>Scudamore</i> here dye with sorrowing.<br>
 Perdy not so; (said she) for shamefull thing<br>
 It were t'abandon noble cheuisaunce,<br>
 For shew of perill, without venturing:<br>
 Rather let try extremities of chaunce,<br>
 Then enterprised prayse for dread to disauaunce.</p><p>
 
 Therewith resolu'd to proue her vtmost might,<br>
 Her ample shield she threw before her face,<br>
 And her swords point directing forward right,<br>
 Assayld the flame, the which eftsoones gaue place,<br>
 And did it selfe diuide with equall space,<br>
 That through she passed; as a thunder bolt<br>
 Perceth the yielding ayre, and doth displace<br>
 The soring clouds into sad showres ymolt;<br>
 So to her yold the flames, and did their force reuolt,</p><p>
 
 Whom whenas <i>Scudamour</i> saw past the fire,<br>
 Safe and vntoucht, he likewise gan assay,<br>
 With greedy will, and enuious desire,<br>
 And bad the stubborne flames to yield him way:<br>
 But cruell <i>Mulciber</i> would not obay<br>
 His threatfull pride, but did the more augment<br>
 His mighty rage, and with imperious sway<br>
 Him forst (maulgre) his fiercenesse to relent,<br>
 And backe retire, all scorcht and pitifully brent.</p><p>
 
 With huge impatience he inly swelt,<br>
 More for great sorrow, that he could not pas,<br>
 Then for the burning torment, which he felt,<br>
 That with fell woodnesse he effierced was,<br>
 And wilfully him throwing on the gras,<br>
 Did beat and bounse his head and brest full sore;<br>
 The whiles the Championesse now entred has<br>
 The vtmost rowme, and past the formest dore,<br>
 The vtmost rowme, abounding with all precious store.</p><p>
 
 For round about, the wals yclothed were<br>
 With goodly arras of great maiesty,<br>
 Wouen with gold and silke so close and nere,<br>
 That the rich metall lurked priuily,<br>
 As faining to be hid from enuious eye;<br>
 Yet here, and there, and euery where vnwares<br>
 It shewd it selfe, and shone vnwillingly;<br>
 Like a discolourd Snake, whose hidden snares<br>
 Through the greene gras his long bright burnisht backe declares.</p><p>
 
 And in those Tapets weren fashioned<br>
 Many faire pourtraicts, and many a faire feate,<br>
 And all of loue, and all of lusty-hed,<br>
 As seemed by their semblaunt did entreat;<br>
 And eke all <i>Cupids</i> warres they did repeate,<br>
 And cruell battels, which he whilome fought<br>
 Gainst all the Gods, to make his empire great;<br>
 Besides the huge massacres, which he wrought<br>
 On mighty kings and kesars, into thraldome brought.</p><p>
 
 Therein was writ, how often thundring <i>Ioue</i><br>
 Had felt the point of his hart-percing dart,<br>
 And leauing heauens kingdome, here did roue<br>
 In straunge disguize, to slake his scalding smart;<br>
 Now like a Ram, faire <i>Helle</i> to peruart,<br>
 Now like a Bull, <i>Europa</i> to withdraw:<br>
 Ah, how the fearefull Ladies tender hart<br>
 Did liuely seeme to tremble, wheh she saw<br>
 The huge seas vnder her t'obay her seruaunts law.</p><p>
 
 Soone after that into a golden showre<br>
 Him selfe he chaung'd faire <i>Danaë</i> to vew,<br>
 And through the roofe of her strong brasen towre<br>
 Did raine into her lap an hony dew,<br>
 The whiles her foolish garde, that little knew<br>
 Of such deceipt, kept th'yron dore fast bard,<br>
 And watcht, that none should enter nor issew;<br>
 Vaine was the watch, and bootlesse all the ward,<br>
 Whenas the God to golden hew him selfe transfard.</p><p>
 
 Then was he turnd into a snowy Swan,<br>
 To win faire <i>Leda</i> to his louely trade:<br>
 O wondrous skill, and sweet wit of the man,<br>
 That her in daffadillies sleeping made,<br>
 From scorching heat her daintie limbes to shade:<br>
 Whiles the proud Bird ruffing his fethers wyde,<br>
 And brushing his faire brest, did her inuade;<br>
 She slept, yet twixt her eyelids closely spyde,<br>
 How towards her he rusht, and smiled at his pryde.</p><p>
 
 Then shewd it, how the <i>Thebane Semelee</i><br>
 Deceiu'd of gealous <i>Iuno</i>, did require<br>
 To see him in his soueraigne maiestee,<br>
 Armd with his thunderbolts and lightning fire,<br>
 Whence dearely she with death bought her desire.<br>
 But faire <i>Alcmena</i> better match did make,<br>
 Ioying his loue in likenesse more entire;<br>
 Three nights in one, they say, that for her sake<br>
 He then did put, her pleasures lenger to partake.</p><p>
 
 Twise was he seene in soaring Eagles shape,<br>
 And with wide wings to beat the buxome ayre,<br>
 Once, when he with <i>Asterie</i> did scape,<br>
 Againe, when as the <i>Troiane</i> boy so faire<br>
 He snatcht from <i>Ida</i> hill, and with him bare:<br>
 Wondrous delight it was, there to behould,<br>
 How the rude Shepheards after him did stare,<br>
 Trembling through feare, least down he fallen should,<br>
 And often to him calling, to take surer hould.</p><p>
 
 In <i>Satyres</i> shape <i>Antiopa</i> he snatcht:<br>
 And like a fire, when he <i>Aegin'</i> assayd:<br>
 A shepheard, when <i>Mnemosyne</i> he catcht:<br>
 And like a Serpent to the <i>Thracian</i> mayd.<br>
 Whiles thus on earth great <i>Ioue</i> these pageaunts playd,<br>
 The winged boy did thrust into his throne,<br>
 And scoffing, thus vnto his mother sayd,<br>
 Lo now the heauens obey to me alone,<br>
 And take me for their <i>Ioue</i>, whiles <i>Ioue</i> to earth is gone.</p><p>
 
 And thou, faire <i>Phoebus</i>, in thy colours bright<br>
 Wast there enwouen, and the sad distresse,<br>
 In which that boy thee plonged, for despight,<br>
 That thou bewray'dst his mothers wantonnesse,<br>
 When she with <i>Mars</i> was meynt in ioyfulnesse:<br>
 For thy, he thrild thee with a leaden dart,<br>
 To loue faire <i>Daphne</i>, which thee loued lesse:<br>
 Lesse she thee lou'd, then was thy iust desart,<br>
 Yet was thy loue her death, &amp; her death was thy smart.</p><p>
 
 So louedst thou the lusty <i>Hyacinct</i>,<br>
 So louedst thou the faire <i>Coronis</i> deare:<br>
 Yet both are of thy haplesse hand extinct,<br>
 Yet both in flowres do liue, and loue thee beare,<br>
 The one a Paunce, the other a sweet breare:<br>
 For griefe whereof, ye mote haue liuely seene<br>
 The God himselfe rending his golden heare,<br>
 And breaking quite his gyrlond euer greene,<br>
 With other signes of sorrow and impatient teene.</p><p>
 
 Both for those two, and for his owne deare sonne,<br>
 The sonne of <i>Climene</i> he did repent,<br>
 Who bold to guide the charet of the Sunne,<br>
 Himselfe in thousand peeces fondly rent,<br>
 And all the world with flashing fier brent;<br>
 So like, that all the walles did seeme to flame.<br>
 Yet cruell <i>Cupid</i>, not herewith content,<br>
 Forst him eftsoones to follow other game,<br>
 And loue a Shepheards daughter for his dearest Dame.</p><p>
 
 He loued <i>Isse</i> for his dear est Dame,<br>
 And for her sake her cattell fed a while,<br>
 And for her sake a cowheard vile became,<br>
 The seruant of <i>Admetus</i> cowheard vile,<br>
 Whiles that from heauen he suffered exile.<br>
 Long were to tell each other louely fit,<br>
 Now like a Lyon, hunting after spoile,<br>
 Now like a Stag, now like a faulcon flit:<br>
 All which in that faire arras was most liuely writ.</p><p>
 
 Next vnto him was <i>Neptune</i> pictured,<br>
 In his diuine resemblance wondrous lyke:<br>
 His face was rugged, and his hoarie hed<br>
 Dropped with brackish deaw; his three-forkt Pyke<br>
 He stearnly shooke, and therewith fierce did stryke<br>
 The raging billowes, that on euery syde<br>
 They trembling stood, and made a long broad dyke,<br>
 That his swift charet might haue passage wyde,<br>
 Which foure great <i>Hippodames</i> did draw in temewise tyde.</p><p>
 
 His sea-horses did seeme to sport amayne,<br>
 And from their nosethrilles blow the brynie streame,<br>
 That made the sparckling waues to smoke agayne,<br>
 And flame with gold, but the white fomy creame,<br>
 Did shine with siluer, and shoot forth his beame.<br>
 The God himselfe did pensiue seeme and sad,<br>
 And hong adowne his head, as he did dreame:<br>
 For priuy loue his brest empierced had,<br>
 Ne ought but deare <i>Bisaltis</i> ay could make him glad.</p><p>
 
 He loued eke <i>Iphimedia</i> deare,<br>
 And <i>Aeolus</i> faire daughter <i>Arne</i> hight.<br>
 For whom he turnd him selfe into a Steare,<br>
 And fed on fodder, to beguile her sight.<br>
 Also to win <i>Deucalions</i> daughter bright,<br>
 He turnd him selfe into a Dolphin fayre;<br>
 And like a winged horse he tooke his flight,<br>
 To snaky-locke <i>Medusa</i> to repayre,<br>
 On whom he got faire <i>Pegasus</i>, that flitteth in the ayre.</p><p>
 
 Next <i>Saturne</i> was, (but who would euer weene,<br>
 That sullein <i>Saturne</i> euer weend to loue?<br>
 Yet loue is sullein, and <i>Saturnlike</i> seene,<br>
 As he did for <i>Erigone</i> it proue,)<br>
 That to a <i>Centaure</i> did him selfe transmoue.<br>
 So proou'd it eke that gracious God of wine,<br>
 When for to compasse <i>Philliras</i> hard loue,<br>
 He turnd himselfe into a fruitfull vine,<br>
 And into her faire bosome made his grapes decline.</p><p>
 
 Long were to tell the amorous assayes,<br>
 And gentle pangues, with which he maked meeke<br>
 The mighty <i>Mars</i>, to learne his wanton playes:<br>
 How oft for <i>Venus</i>, and how often eek<br>
 For many other Nymphes he sore did shreek,<br>
 With womanish teares, and with vnwarlike smarts,<br>
 Priuily moystening his horrid cheek.<br>
 There was he painted full of burning darts,<br>
 And many wide woundes launched through his inner parts.</p><p>
 
 Ne did he spare (so cruell was the Elfe)<br>
 His owne deare mother, (ah why should he so?)<br>
 Ne did he spare sometime to pricke himselfe,<br>
 That he might taste the sweet consuming woe,<br>
 Which he had wrought to many others moe.<br>
 But to declare the mournfull Tragedyes,<br>
 And spoiles, wherewith he all the ground did strow,<br>
 More eath to number, with how many eyes<br>
 High heauen beholds sad louers nightly theeueryes.</p><p>
 
 Kings Queenes, Lords Ladies, Knights &amp; Damzels gent<br>
 Were heap'd together with the vulgar sort,<br>
 And mingled with the raskall rablement,<br>
 Without respect of person or of port,<br>
 To shew Dan <i>Cupids</i> powre and great effort:<br>
 And round about a border was entrayld,<br>
 Of broken bowes and arrowes shiuered short,<br>
 And a long bloudy riuer through them rayld,<br>
 So liuely and so like, that liuing sence it fayld.</p><p>
 
 And at the vpper end of that faire rowme,<br>
 There was an Altar built of pretious stone,<br>
 Of passing valew, and of great renowme,<br>
 On which there stood an Image all alone,<br>
 Of massy gold, which with his owne light shone;<br>
 And wings it had with sundry colours dight,<br>
 More sundry colours, then the proud <i>Pauone</i><br>
 Beares in his boasted fan, or <i>Iris</i> bright,<br>
 When her discolourd bow she spreds through heauens hight.</p><p>
 
 Blindfold he was, and in his cruell fist<br>
 A mortall bow and arrowes keene did hold,<br>
 With which he shot at randon, when him list,<br>
 Some headed with sad lead, some with pure gold;<br>
 (Ah man beware, how thou those darts behold)<br>
 A wounded Dragon vnder him did ly,<br>
 Whose hideous tayle his left foot did enfold,<br>
 And with a shaft was shot through either eye,<br>
 That no man forth might draw, ne no man remedye.</p><p>
 
 And vnderneath his feet was written thus,<br>
 <i>Vnto the Victor of the Gods this bee:</i><br>
 And all the people in that ample hous<br>
 Did to that image bow their humble knee,<br>
 And oft committed fowle Idolatree.<br>
 That wondrous sight faire <i>Britomart</i> amazed,<br>
 Ne seeing could her wonder satisfie,<br>
 But euermore and more vpon it gazed,<br>
 The whiles the passing brightnes her fraile sences dazed.</p><p>
 
 Tho as she backward cast her busie eye,<br>
 To search each secret of that goodly sted,<br>
 Ouer the dore thus written she did spye<br>
 <i>Be bold</i>: she oft and oft it ouer-red,<br>
 Yet could not find what sence it figured:<br>
 But what so were therein or writ or ment,<br>
 She was no whit thereby discouraged<br>
 From prosecuting of her first intent,<br>
 But forward with bold steps into the next roome went.</p><p>
 
 Much fairer, then the former, was that roome,<br>
 And richlier by many partes arayd:<br>
 For not with arras made in painefull loome,<br>
 But with pure gold it all was ouerlayd,<br>
 Wrought with wilde Antickes, which their follies playd,<br>
 In the rich metall, as they liuing were:<br>
 A thousand monstrous formes therein were made,<br>
 Such as false loue doth oft vpon him weare:<br>
 For loue in thousand monstrous formes doth oft appeare.</p><p>
 
 And all about, the glistring walles were hong<br>
 With warlike spoiles, and with victorious prayes,<br>
 Of mighty Conquerours and Captaines strong,<br>
 Which were whilome captiued in their dayes<br>
 To cruell loue, and wrought their owne decayes:<br>
 Their swerds &amp; speres were broke, &amp; hauberques rent;<br>
 And their proud girlonds of tryumphant bayes<br>
 Troden in dust with fury insolent,<br>
 To shew the victors might and mercilesse intent.</p><p>
 
 The warlike Mayde beholding earnestly<br>
 The goodly ordinance of this rich place,<br>
 Did greatly wonder, ne could satisfie<br>
 Her greedy eyes with gazing a long space:<br>
 But more she meruaild that no footings trace,<br>
 Nor wight appear'd, but wastefull emptinesse,<br>
 And solemne silence ouer all that place:<br>
 Straunge thing it seem'd, that none was to possesse<br>
 So rich purueyance, ne them keepe with carefulnesse.</p><p>
 
 And as she lookt about, she did behold,<br>
 How ouer that same dore was likewise writ,<br>
 <i>Be bold</i>, <i>be bold</i>, and euery where <i>Be bold</i>,<br>
 That much she muz'd, yet could not construe it<br>
 By any ridling skill, or commune wit.<br>
 At last she spyde at that roomes vpper end,<br>
 Another yron dore, on which was writ,<br>
 <i>Be not too bold</i>; whereto though she did bend<br>
 Her earnest mind, yet wist not what it might intend.</p><p>
 
 Thus she there waited vntill euentyde,<br>
 Yet liuing creature none she saw appeare:<br>
 And now sad shadowes gan the world to hyde,<br>
 From mortall vew, and wrap in darkenesse dreare;<br>
 Yet nould she d'off her weary armes, for feare<br>
 Of secret daunger, ne let sleepe oppresse<br>
 Her heauy eyes with natures burdein deare,<br>
 But drew her selfe aside in sickernesse,<br>
 And her welpointed weapons did about her dresse.</p><p>
