 </p><blockquote>
 <i>The witches sonne loues Florimell:<br>
 she flyes, he faines to die.<br>
 Satyrane saues the Squire of Dames<br>
 from Gyants tyrannie.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 L
 Ike as an Hynd forth singled from the heard,<br>
 That hath escaped from a rauenous beast,<br>
 Yet flyes away of her owne feet affeard,<br>
 And euery leafe, that shaketh with the least<br>
 Murmure of winde, her terror hath encreast;<br>
 So fled faire <i>Florimell</i> from her vaine feare,<br>
 Long after she from perill was releast:<br>
 Each shade she saw, and each noyse she did heare,<br>
 Did seeme to be the same, which she escapt whyleare.<p>
 
 All that same euening she in flying spent,<br>
 And all that night her course continewed:<br>
 Ne did she let dull sleepe once to relent,<br>
 Nor wearinesse to slacke her hast, but fled<br>
 Euer alike, as if her former dred<br>
 Were hard behind, her readie to arrest:<br>
 And her white Palfrey hauing conquered<br>
 The maistring raines out of her weary wrest,<br>
 Perforce her carried, where euer he thought best.</p><p>
 
 So long as breath, and hable puissance<br>
 Did natiue courage vnto him supply,<br>
 His pace he freshly forward did aduaunce,<br>
 And carried her beyond all ieopardy,<br>
 But nought that wanteth rest, can long aby.<br>
 He hauing through incessant trauell spent<br>
 His force, at last perforce a downe did ly,<br>
 Ne foot could further moue: the Lady gent<br>
 Thereat was suddein strooke with great astonishment.</p><p>
 
 And forst t'alight, on foot mote algates fare,<br>
 A traueller vnwonted to such way:<br>
 Need teacheth her this lesson hard and rare,<br>
 That fortune all in equall launce doth sway,<br>
 And mortall miseries doth make her play.<br>
 So long she trauelled, till at length she came<br>
 To an hilles side, which did to her bewray<br>
 A little valley, subiect to the same,<br>
 All couerd with thick woods, that quite it ouercame.</p><p>
 
 Through the tops of the high trees she did descry<br>
 A litle smoke, whose vapour thin and light,<br>
 Reeking aloft, vprolled to the sky:<br>
 Which, chearefull signe did send vnto her sight,<br>
 That in the same did wonne some liuing wight.<br>
 Eftsoones her steps she thereunto applyde,<br>
 And came at last in weary wretched plight<br>
 Vnto the place, to which her hope did guyde,<br>
 To find some refuge there, and rest her weary syde.</p><p>
 
 There in a gloomy hollow glen she found<br>
 A little cottage, built of stickes and reedes<br>
 In homely wize, and wald with sods around,<br>
 In which a witch did dwell, in loathly weedes,<br>
 And wilfull want, all carelesse of her needes;<br>
 So choosing solitarie to abide,<br>
 Far from all neighbours, that her deuilish deedes<br>
 And hellish arts from people she might hide,<br>
 And hurt far off vnknowne, whom euer she enuide.</p><p>
 
 The Damzell there arriuing entred in;<br>
 Where sitting on the flore the Hag she found,<br>
 Busie (as seem'd) about some wicked gin:<br>
 Who soone as she beheld that suddein stound,<br>
 Lightly vpstarted from the dustie ground,<br>
 And with fell looke and hollow deadly gaze<br>
 Stared on her awhile, as one astound,<br>
 Ne had one word to speake, for great amaze,<br>
 But shewd by outward signes, that dread her sence did daze.</p><p>
 
 At last turning her feare to foolish wrath,<br>
 She askt, what deuill had her thither brought,<br>
 And who she was, and what vnwonted path<br>
 Had guided her, vnwelcomed, vnsought?<br>
 To which the Damzell full of doubtfull thought,<br>
 Her mildly answer'd; Beldame be not wroth<br>
 With silly Virgin by aduenture brought<br>
 Vnto your dwelling, ignorant and loth,<br>
 That craue but rowme to rest, while tempest ouerblo'th.</p><p>
 
 With that adowne out of her Christall eyne<br>
 Few trickling teares she softly forth let fall,<br>
 That like two Orient pearles, did purely shyne<br>
 Vpon her snowy cheeke; and therewithall<br>
 She sighed soft, that none so bestiall,<br>
 Nor saluage hart, but ruth of her sad plight<br>
 Would make to melt, or pitteously appall;<br>
 And that vile Hag, all were her whole delight<br>
 In mischiefe, was much moued at so pitteous sight.</p><p>
 
 And gan recomfort her in her rude wyse,<br>
 With womanish compassion of her plaint,<br>
 Wiping the teares from her suffused eyes,<br>
 And bidding her sit downe, to rest her faint<br>
 And wearie limbs a while.  She nothing quaint<br>
 Nor s'deignfull of so homely fashion,<br>
 Sith brought she was now to so hard constraint,<br>
 Sate downe vpon the dusty ground anon,<br>
 As glad of that small rest, as Bird of tempest gon.</p><p>
 
 Tho gan she gather vp her garments rent,<br>
 And her loose lockes to dight in order dew,<br>
 With golden wreath and gorgeous ornament;<br>
 Whom such whenas the wicked Hag did vew,<br>
 She was astonisht at her heauenly hew,<br>
 And doubted her to deeme an earthly wight,<br>
 But or some Goddesse, or of <i>Dianes</i> crew,<br>
 And thought her to adore with humble spright;<br>
 T'adore thing so diuine as beauty, were but right.</p><p>
 
 This wicked woman had a wicked sonne,<br>
 The comfort of her age and weary dayes,<br>
 A laesie loord, for nothing good to donne,<br>
 But stretched forth in idlenesse alwayes,<br>
 Ne euer cast his mind to couet prayse,<br>
 Or ply him selfe to any honest trade,<br>
 But all the day before the sunny rayes<br>
 He vs'd to slug, or sleepe in slothfull shade:<br>
 Such laesinesse both lewd and poore attonce him made.</p><p>
 
 He comming home at vndertime, there found<br>
 The fairest creature, that he euer saw,<br>
 Sitting beside his mother on the ground;<br>
 The sight whereof did greatly him adaw,<br>
 And his base thought with terrour and with aw<br>
 So inly smot, that as one, which had gazed<br>
 On the bright Sunne vnwares, doth soone withdraw<br>
 His feeble eyne, with too much brightnesse dazed,<br>
 So stared he on her, and stood long while amazed.</p><p>
 
 Softly at last he gan his mother aske,<br>
 What mister wight that was, and whence deriued,<br>
 That in so straunge disguizement there did maske,<br>
 And by what accident she there arriued:<br>
 But she, as one nigh of her wits depriued,<br>
 With nought but ghastly lookes him answered,<br>
 Like to a ghost, that lately is reuiued<br>
 From <i>Stygian</i> shores, where late it wandered;<br>
 So both at her, and each at other wondered.</p><p>
 
 But the faire Virgin was so meeke and mild,<br>
 That she to them vouchsafed to embace<br>
 Her goodly port, and to their senses vild,<br>
 Her gentle speach applide, that in short space<br>
 She grew familiare in that desert place.<br>
 During which time, the Chorle through her so kind<br>
 And curteise vse conceiu'd affection bace,<br>
 And cast to loue her in his brutish mind;<br>
 No loue, but brutish lust, that was so beastly tind.</p><p>
 
 Closely the wicked flame his bowels brent,<br>
 And shortly grew into outrageous fire;<br>
 Yet had he not the hart, nor hardiment,<br>
 As vnto her to vtter his desire;<br>
 His caytiue thought durst not so high aspire,<br>
 But with soft sighes, and louely semblaunces,<br>
 He ween'd that his affection entire<br>
 She should aread; many resemblaunces<br>
  To her he made, and many kind remembraunces.</p><p>
 
 Oft from the forrest wildings he did bring,<br>
 Whose sides empurpled were with smiling red,<br>
 And oft young birds, which he had taught to sing<br>
 His mistresse prayses, sweetly caroled,<br>
 Girlonds of flowres sometimes for her faire hed<br>
 He fine would dight; sometimes the squirell wild<br>
 He brought to her in bands, as conquered<br>
 To be her thrall, his fellow seruant vild;<br>
 All which, she of him tooke with countenance meeke and mild.</p><p>
 
 But past awhile, when she fit season saw<br>
 To leaue that desert mansion, she cast<br>
 In secret wize her selfe thence to withdraw,<br>
 For feare of mischiefe, which she did forecast<br>
 Might by the witch or by her sonne compast:<br>
 Her wearie Palfrey closely, as she might,<br>
 Now well recouered after long repast,<br>
 In his proud furnitures she freshly dight,<br>
 His late miswandred wayes now to remeasure right.</p><p>
 
 And earely ere the dawning day appeard,<br>
 She forth issewed, and on her iourney went;<br>
 She went in perill, of each noyse affeard,<br>
 And of each shade, that did it selfe present;<br>
 For still she feared to be ouerhent,<br>
 Of that vile hag, or her vnciuile sonne:<br>
 Who when too late awaking, well they kent,<br>
 That their faire guest was gone, they both begonne<br>
 To make exceeding mone, as they had bene vndonne.</p><p>
 
 But that lewd louer did the most lament<br>
 For her depart, that euer man did heare;<br>
 He knockt his brest with desperate intent,<br>
 And scratcht his face, and with his teeth did teare<br>
 His rugged flesh, and rent his ragged heare:<br>
 That his sad mother seeing his sore plight,<br>
 Was greatly woe begon, and gan to feare,<br>
 Least his fraile senses were emperisht quight,<br>
 And loue to frenzy turnd, sith loue is franticke hight.</p><p>
 
 All wayes she sought, him to restore to plight,<br>
 With herbs, with charms, with coũsell, &amp; with teares,<br>
 But tears, nor charms, nor herbs, nor counsell might<br>
 Asswage the fury, which his entrails teares:<br>
 So strong is passion, that no reason heares.<br>
 Tho when all other helpes she saw to faile,<br>
 She turnd her selfe backe to her wicked leares<br>
 And by her deuilish arts thought to preuaile,<br>
 To bring her backe againe, or worke her finall bale.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones out of her hidden caue she cald<br>
 An hideous beast, of horrible aspect,<br>
 That could the stoutest courage haue appald;<br>
 Monstrous mishapt, and all his backe was spect<br>
 With thousand spots of colours queint elect,<br>
 Thereto so swift, that it all beasts did pas:<br>
 Like neuer yet did liuing eye detect;<br>
 But likest it to an <i>Hyena</i> was,<br>
 That feeds on womens flesh, as others feede on gras.</p><p>
 
 It forth she cald, and gaue it streight in charge,<br>
 Through thicke and thin her to pursew apace,<br>
 Ne once to stay to rest, or breath at large,<br>
 Till her he had attaind, and brought in place,<br>
 Or quite deuourd her beauties scornefull grace.<br>
 The Monster swift as word, that from her went,<br>
 Went forth in hast, and did her footing trace<br>
 So sure and swiftly, through his perfect scent,<br>
 And passing speede, that shortly he her ouerhent.</p><p>
 
 Whom when the fearefull Damzell nigh espide,<br>
 No need to bid her fast away to flie;<br>
 That vgly shape so sore her terrifide,<br>
 That it she shund no lesse, then dread to die,<br>
 And her flit Palfrey did so well apply<br>
 His nimble feet to her conceiued feare,<br>
 That whilest his breath did strength to him supply,<br>
 From perill free he her away did beare:<br>
 But when his force gan faile, his pace gan wex areare.</p><p>
 
 Which whenas she perceiu'd, she was dismayd<br>
 At that same last extremitie full sore,<br>
 And of her safetie greatly grew afrayd;<br>
 And now she gan approch to the sea shore,<br>
 As it befell, that she could flie no more,<br>
 But yield her selfe to spoile of greedinesse.<br>
 Lightly she leaped, as a wight forlore,<br>
 From her dull horse, in desperate distresse,<br>
 And to her feet betooke her doubtfull sickernesse.</p><p>
 
 Not halfe so fast the wicked <i>Myrrha</i> fled<br>
 From dread of her reuenging fathers hond:<br>
 Nor halfe so fast to saue her maidenhed,<br>
 Fled fearefull <i>Daphne</i> on th'<i>Ægæan</i> strond,<br>
 As <i>Florimell</i> fled from that Monster yond,<br>
 To reach the sea, ere she of him were raught:<br>
 For in the sea to drowne her selfe she fond,<br>
 Rather then of the tyrant to be caught:<br>
 Thereto feare gaue her wings, and neede her courage taught.</p><p>
 
 It fortuned (high God did so ordaine)<br>
 As she arriued on the roring shore,<br>
 In minde to leape into the mighty maine,<br>
 A little boate lay houing her before,<br>
 In which there slept a fisher old and pore,<br>
 The whiles his nets were drying on the sand:<br>
 Into the same she leapt, and with the ore<br>
 Did thrust the shallop from the floting strand:<br>
 So safetie found at sea, which she found not at land.</p><p>
 
 The Monster ready on the pray to sease,<br>
 Was of his forward hope deceiued quight;<br>
 Ne durst assay to wade the perlous seas,<br>
 But greedily long gaping at the sight,<br>
 At last in vaine was forst to turne his flight,<br>
 And tell the idle tidings to his Dame:<br>
 Yet to auenge his deuilish despight,<br>
 He set vpon her Palfrey tired lame,<br>
 And slew him cruelly, ere any reskew came.</p><p>
 
 And after hauing him embowelled,<br>
 To fill his hellish gorge, it chaunst a knight<br>
 To passe that way, as forth he trauelled;<br>
 It was a goodly Swaine, and of great might,<br>
 As euer man that bloudy field did fight;<br>
 But in vaine sheows, that wont yongknights bewitch,<br>
 And courtly seruices tooke no delight,<br>
 But rather ioyd to be, then seemen sich:<br>
 For both to be and seeme to him was labour lich.</p><p>
 
 It was to weete the good Sir <i>Satyrane</i>,<br>
 That raungd abroad to seeke aduentures wilde,<br>
 As was his wont in forrest, and in plaine;<br>
 He was all armd in rugged steele vnfilde,<br>
 As in the smoky forge it was compilde,<br>
 And in his Scutchin bore a Satyres hed:<br>
 He comming present, where the Monster vilde<br>
 Vpon that milke-white Palfreyes carkas fed,<br>
 Vnto his reskew ran, and greedily him sped.</p><p>
 
 There well perceiu'd he, that it was the horse,<br>
 Whereon faire <i>Florimell</i> was wont to ride,<br>
 That of that feend was rent without remorse:<br>
 Much feared he, least ought did ill betide<br>
 To that faire Mayd, the flowre of womens pride;<br>
 For her he dearely loued, and in all<br>
 His famous conquests highly magnifide:<br>
 Besides her golden girdle, which did fall<br>
 From her in flight, he found, that did him sore apall.</p><p>
 
 Full of sad feare, and doubtfull agony,<br>
 Fiercely he flew vpon that wicked feend,<br>
 And with huge strokes, and cruell battery<br>
 Him forst to leaue his pray, for to attend<br>
 Him selfe from deadly daunger to defend:<br>
 Full many wounds in his corrupted flesh<br>
 He did engraue, and muchell bloud did spend,<br>
 Yet might not do him dye, but aye more fresh<br>
 And fierce he still appeard, the more he did him thresh.</p><p>
 
 He wist not, how him to despoile of life,<br>
 Ne how to win the wished victory,<br>
 Sith him he saw still stronger grow through strife,<br>
 And him selfe weaker through infirmity;<br>
 Greatly he grew enrag'd, and furiously<br>
 Hurling his sword away, he lightly lept<br>
 Vpon the beast, that with great cruelty<br>
 Rored, and raged to be vnder-kept:<br>
 Yet he perforce him held, and strokes vpon him hept.</p><p>
 
 As he that striues to stop a suddein flood,<br>
 And in strong banckes his violence enclose,<br>
 Forceth it swell aboue his wonted mood,<br>
 And largely ouerflow the fruitfull plaine,<br>
 That all the countrey seemes to be a Maine,<br>
 And the rich furrowes flote, all quite fordonne:<br>
 The wofull husbandman doth lowd complaine,<br>
 To see his whole yeares labour lost so soone,<br>
 For which to God he made so many an idle boone.</p><p>
 
 So him he held, and did through might amate:<br>
 So long he held him, and him bet so long,<br>
 That at the last his fiercenesse gan abate,<br>
 And meekely stoup vnto the victour strong:<br>
 Who to auenge the implacable wrong,<br>
 Which he supposed donne to <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
 Sought by all meanes his dolour to prolong,<br>
 Sith dint of steele his carcas could not quell:<br>
 His maker with her charmes had framed him so well.</p><p>
 
 The golden ribband, which that virgin wore<br>
 About her sclender wast, he tooke in hand,<br>
 And with it bound the beast, that lowd did rore<br>
 For great despight of that vnwonted band,<br>
 Yet dared not his victour to withstand,<br>
 But trembled like a lambe, fled from the pray,<br>
 And all the way him followd on the strand,<br>
 As he had long bene learned to obay;<br>
 Yet neuer learned he such seruice, till that day.</p><p>
 
 Thus as he led the Beast along the way,<br>
 He spide far off a mighty Giauntesse,<br>
 Fast flying on a Courser dapled gray,<br>
 From a bold knight, that with great hardinesse<br>
 Her hard pursewd, and sought for to suppresse;<br>
 She bore before her lap a dolefull Squire,<br>
 Lying athwart her horse in great distresse,<br>
 Fast bounden hand and foote with cords of wire,<br>
 Whom she did meane to make the thrall of her desire.</p><p>
 
 Which whenas <i>Satyrane</i> beheld, in hast<br>
 He left his captiue Beast at liberty,<br>
 And crost the nearest way, by which he cast<br>
 Her to encounter, ere she passed by:<br>
 But she the way shund nathemore for thy,<br>
 But forward gallopt fast; which when he spyde,<br>
 His mighty speare he couched warily,<br>
 And at her ran: she hauing him descryde,<br>
 Her selfe to fight addrest, and threw her lode aside.</p><p>
 
 Like as a Goshauke, that in foote doth beare<br>
 A trembling Culuer, hauing spide on hight<br>
 An Egle, that with plumy wings doth sheare<br>
 The subtile ayre, stouping with all his might,<br>
 The quarrey throwes to ground with fell despight,<br>
 And to the battell doth her selfe prepare:<br>
 So ran the Geauntesse vnto the fight;<br>
 Her firie eyes with furious sparkes did stare,<br>
 And with blasphemous bannes high God in peeces tare.</p><p>
 
 She caught in hand an huge great yron mace,<br>
 Wherewith she many had of life depriued,<br>
 But ere the stroke could seize his aymed place,<br>
 His speare amids her sun-broad shield arriued;<br>
 Yet nathemore the steele a sunder riued,<br>
 All were the beame in bignesse like a mast,<br>
 Ne her out of the stedfast sadle driued,<br>
 But glauncing on the tempred mettall, brast<br>
 In thousand shiuers, and so forth beside her past.</p><p>
 
 Her Steed did stagger with that puissaunt strooke;<br>
 But she no more was moued with that might,<br>
 Then it had lighted on an aged Oke;<br>
 Or on the marble Pillour, that is pight<br>
 Vpon the top of Mount <i>Olympus</i> hight,<br>
 For the braue youthly Champions to assay,<br>
 With burning charet wheeles it nigh to smite:<br>
 But who that smites it, mars his ioyous play,<br>
 And is the spectacle of ruinous decay.</p><p>
 
 Yet therewith sore enrag'd, with sterne regard<br>
 Her dreadfull weapon she to him addrest,<br>
 Which on his helmet martelled so hard,<br>
 That made him low incline his lofty crest,<br>
 And bowd his battred visour to his brest:<br>
 Wherewith he was so stund, that he n'ote ryde,<br>
 But reeled to and fro from East to West:<br>
 Which when his cruell enimy espyde,<br>
 She lightly vnto him adioyned side to syde;</p><p>
 
 And on his collar laying puissant hand,<br>
 Out of his wauering seat him pluckt perforse,<br>
 Perforse him pluckt, vnable to withstand,<br>
 Or helpe himselfe, and laying thwart her horse,<br>
 In loathly wise like to a carion corse,<br>
 She bore him fast away.  Which when the knight,<br>
 That her pursewed, saw with great remorse,<br>
 He neare was touched in his noble spright,<br>
 And gan encrease his speed, as she encreast her flight.</p><p>
 
 Whom when as nigh approching she espyde,<br>
 She threw away her burden angrily;<br>
 For she list not the battell to abide,<br>
 But made her selfe more light, away to fly:<br>
 Yet her the hardy knight pursewd so nye,<br>
 That almost in the backe he oft her strake:<br>
 But still when him at hand she did espy,<br>
 She turnd, and semblaunce of faire fight did make;<br>
 But when he stayd, to flight againe she did her take.</p><p>
 
 By this the good Sir <i>Satyrane</i> gan wake<br>
 Out of his dreame, that did him long entraunce,<br>
 And seeing none in place, he gan to make<br>
 Exceeding mone, and curst that cruell chaunce,<br>
 Which reft from him so faire a cheuisaunce:<br>
 At length he spide, whereas that wofull Squire,<br>
 Whom he had reskewed from captiuaunce<br>
 Of his strong foe, lay tombled in the myre,<br>
 Vnable to arise, or foot or hand to styre.</p><p>
 
 To whom approching, well he mote perceiue<br>
 In that foule plight a comely personage,<br>
 And louely face, made fit for to deceiue<br>
 Fraile Ladies hart with loues consuming rage,<br>
 Now in the blossome of his freshest age:<br>
 He reard him vp, and loosd his yron bands,<br>
 And after gan inquire his parentage,<br>
 And how he fell into that Gyaunts hands,<br>
 And who that was, which chaced her along the lands.</p><p>
 
 Then trembling yet through feare, the Squire bespake,<br>
 That Geauntesse <i>Argante</i> is behight,<br>
 A daughter of the <i>Titans</i> which did make<br>
 Warre against heauen, and heaped hils on hight,<br>
 To scale the skyes, and put <i>Ioue</i> from his right:<br>
 Her sire <i>Typhoeus</i> was, who mad through merth,<br>
 And drunke with bloud of men, slaine by his might,<br>
 Through incest, her of his owne mother Earth<br>
 Whilome begot, being but halfe twin of that berth.</p><p>
 
 For at that berth another Babe she bore,<br>
 To weet the mighty <i>Ollyphant</i>, that wrought<br>
 Great wreake to many errant knights of yore,<br>
 And many hath to foule confusion brought.<br>
 These twinnes, men say, (a thing far passing thought)<br>
 Whiles in their mothers wombe enclosd they were,<br>
 Ere they into the lightsome world were brought,<br>
 In fleshly lust were mingled both yfere,<br>
 And in that monstrous wise did to the world appere.</p><p>
 
 So liu'd they euer after in like sin,<br>
 Gainst natures law, and good behauioure:<br>
 But greatest shame was to that maiden twin,<br>
 Who not content so fowly to deuoure<br>
 Her natiue flesh, and staine her brothers bowre,<br>
 Did wallow in all other fleshly myre,<br>
 And suffred beasts her body to deflowre:<br>
 So whot she burned in that lustfull fyre,<br>
 Yet all that might not slake her sensuall desyre.</p><p>
 
 But ouer all the countrey she did raunge,<br>
 To seeke young men, to quench her flaming thurst,<br>
 And feed her fancy with delightfull chaunge:<br>
 Whom so she fittest finds to serue her lust,<br>
 Through her maine strength, in which she most doth trust,<br>
 She with her brings into a secret Ile,<br>
 Where in eternall bondage dye he must,<br>
 Or be the vassall of her pleasures vile,<br>
 And in all shamefull sort him selfe with her defile.</p><p>
 
 Me seely wretch she so at vauntage caught,<br>
 After she long in waite for me did lye,<br>
 And meant vnto her prison to haue brought,<br>
 Her lothsome pleasure there to satisfye;<br>
 That thousand deathes me leuer were to dye,<br>
 Then breake the vow, that to faire <i>Columbell</i><br>
 I plighted haue, and yet keepe stedfastly:<br>
 As for my name, it mistreth not to tell;<br>
 Call me the <i>Squyre of Dames</i> that me beseemeth well.</p><p>
 
 But that bold knight, whom ye pursuing saw<br>
 That Geauntesse, is not such, as she seemed,<br>
 But a faire virgin, that in martiall law,<br>
 And deedes of armes aboue all Dames is deemed,<br>
 And aboue many knights is eke esteemed,<br>
 For her great worth; she <i>Palladine</i> is hight:<br>
 She you from death, you me from dread redeemed.<br>
 Ne any may that Monster match in fight,<br>
 But she, or such as she, that is so chaste a wight.</p><p>
 
 Her well beseemes that Quest (quoth <i>Satyrane</i>)<br>
 But read, thou <i>Squyre of Dames</i>, what vow is this,<br>
 Which thou vpon thy selfe hast lately ta'ne?<br>
 That shall I you recount (quoth he) ywis,<br>
 So be ye pleasd to pardon all amis.<br>
 That gentle Lady, whom I loue and serue,<br>
 After long suit and weary seruicis,<br>
 Did aske me, how I could her loue deserue,<br>
 And how she might be sure, that I would neuer swerue.</p><p>
 
 I glad by any meanes her grace to gaine,<br>
 Bad her commaund my life to saue, or spill.<br>
 Eftsoones she bad me, with incessaunt paine<br>
 To wander through the world abroad at will,<br>
 And euery where, where with my power or skill<br>
 I might do seruice vnto gentle Dames,<br>
 That I the same should faithfully fulfill,<br>
 And at the twelue monethes end should bring their names<br>
 And pledges; as the spoiles of my victorious games.</p><p>
 
 So well I to faire Ladies seruice did,<br>
 And found such fauour in their louing hartes,<br>
 That ere the yeare his course had compassid,<br>
 Three hundred pledges for my good desartes,<br>
 And thrise three hundred thanks for my good partes<br>
 I with me brought, and did to her present:<br>
 Which when she saw, more bent to eke my smartes,<br>
 Then to reward my trusty true intent,<br>
 She gan for me deuise a grieuous punishment.</p><p>
 
 To weet, that I my trauell should resume,<br>
 And with like labour walke the world around,<br>
 Ne euer to her presence should presume,<br>
 Till I so many other Dames had found,<br>
 The which, for all the suit I could propound,<br>
 Would me refuse their pledges to afford,<br>
 But did abide for euer chast and sound.<br>
 Ah gentle Squire (quoth he) tell at one word,<br>
 How many foundst thou such to put in thy record?</p><p>
 
 In deed Sir knight (said he) one word may tell<br>
 All, that I euer found so wisely stayd;<br>
 For onely three they were disposd so well,<br>
 And yet three yeares I now abroad haue strayd,<br>
 To find them out.  Mote I (then laughing sayd<br>
 The knight) inquire of thee, what were those three,<br>
 The which thy proffred curtesie denayd?<br>
 Or ill they seemed sure auizd to bee,<br>
 Or brutishly brought vp, that neu'r did fashions see.</p><p>
 
 The first which then refused me (said hee)<br>
 Certes was but a common Courtisane,<br>
 Yet flat refusd to haue a do with mee,<br>
 Because I could not giue her many a Iane.<br>
 (Thereat full hartely laughed <i>Satyrane</i>.)<br>
 The second was an holy Nunne to chose,<br>
 Which would not let me be her Chappellane,<br>
 Because she knew, she said, I would disclose<br>
 Her counsell, if he should her trust in me repose.</p><p>
 
 The third a Damzell was of low degree,<br>
 Whom I in countrey cottage found by chaunce;<br>
 Full little weened I, that chastitee<br>
 Had lodging in so meane a maintenaunce,<br>
 Yet was she faire, and in her countenance<br>
 Dwelt simple truth in seemely fashion.<br>
 Long thus I woo'd her with dew obseruance,<br>
 In hope vnto my pleasure to haue won;<br>
 But was as farre at last, as when I first begon.</p><p>
 
 Safe her, I neuer any woman found,<br>
 That chastity did for it selfe embrace,<br>
 But were for other causes firme and sound;<br>
 Either for want of handsome time and place,<br>
 Or else for feare of shame and fowle disgrace.<br>
 Thus am I hopelesse euer to attaine<br>
 My Ladies loue, in such a desperate case,<br>
 But all my dayes am like to wast in vaine,<br>
 Seeking to match the chaste with th'vnchaste Ladies traine.</p><p>
 
 Perdy, (said <i>Satyrane</i>) thou <i>Squire of Dames</i>,<br>
 Great labour fondly hast thou hent in hand,<br>
 To get small thankes, and therewith many blames,<br>
 That may emongst <i>Alcides</i> labours stand.<br>
 Thence backe returning to the former land,<br>
 Where late he left the Beast, he ouercame,<br>
 He found him not; for he had broke his band,<br>
 And was return'd againe vnto his Dame,<br>
 To tell what tydings of faire <i>Florimell</i> became.</p><p>
