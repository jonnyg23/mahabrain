 <i>Artegall dealeth right betwixt<br>
 two brethren that doe strive,<br>
 Saues Terpine from the gallow tree,<br>

 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 VV
 Ho so vpon him selfe will take the skill<br>
 True Iustice vnto people to diuide,<br>
 Had neede haue mightie hands, for to fulfill<br>
 That, which he doth with righteous doome decide,<br>
 And for to maister wrong and puissant pride,<br>
 For vaine it is to deeme of things aright,<br>
 And makes wrong doers iustice to deride,<br>
 Vnlesse it be perform'd with dreadlesse might.<br>
 For powre is the right hand of Iustice truely hight.<p>
 
 Therefore whylome to knights of great emprise<br>
 The charge of Iustice giuen was in trust,<br>
 That they might execute her iudgements wise,<br>
 And with their might beat downe licentious lust,<br>
 Which proudly did impugne her sentence iust.<br>
 Whereof no brauer president this day<br>
 Remaines on earth, preseru'd from yron rust<br>
 Of rude obliuion, and long times decay,<br>
 Then this of <i>Artegall</i>, which here we haue to say.</p><p>
 
 Who hauing lately left that louely payre,<br>
 Enlincked fast in wedlockes loyall bond,<br>
 Bold <i>Marinell</i> with <i>Florimell</i> the fayre,<br>
 With whom great feast and goodly glee he fond,<br>
 Departed from the Castle of the strond,<br>
 To follow his aduentures first intent,<br>
 Which long agoe he taken had in hond:<br>
 Ne wight with him for his assistance went,<br>
 But that great yron groome, his gard and gouernment.</p><p>
 
 With whom as he did passe by the sea shore,<br>
 He chaunst to come, whereas two comely Squires,<br>
 Both brethren, whom one wombe together bore,<br>
 But stirred vp with different desires,<br>
 Together stroue, and kindled wrathfull fires:<br>
 And them beside two seemely damzels stood,<br>
 By all meanes seeking to asswage their ires,<br>
 Now with faire words; but words did little good,<br>
 Now with sharpe threats; but threats the more increast their mood.</p><p>
 
 And there before them stood a Coffer strong,<br>
 Fast bound on euery side with iron bands,<br>
 But seeming to haue suffred mickle wrong,<br>
 Either by being wreckt vppon the sands,<br>
 Or being carried farre from forraine lands.<br>
 Seem'd that for it these Squires at ods did fall,<br>
 And bent against them selues their cruell hands.<br>
 But euermore, those Damzels did forestall<br>
 Their furious encounter, and their fiercenesse pall.</p><p>
 
 But firmely fixt they were, with dint of sword,<br>
 And battailes doubtfull proofe their rights to try,<br>
 Ne other end their fury would afford,<br>
 But what to them Fortune would iustify.<br>
 So stood they both in readinesse thereby,<br>
 To ioyne the combate with cruell intent;<br>
 When <i>Artegall</i> arriuing happily,<br>
 Did stay a while their greedy bickerment,<br>
 Till he had questioned the cause of their dissent.</p><p>
 
 To whom the elder did this aunswere frame;<br>
 Then weete ye Sir, that we two brethren be,<br>
 To whom our sire, <i>Milesio</i> by name,<br>
 Did equally bequeath his lands in fee,<br>
 Two Ilands, which ye there before you see<br>
 Not farre in sea; of which the one appeares<br>
 But like a little Mount of small degree;<br>
 Yet was as great and wide ere many yeares,<br>
 As that same other Isle, that greater bredth now beares.</p><p>
 
 But tract of time, that all things doth decay,<br>
 And this deuouring Sea, that naught doth spare,<br>
 The most part of my land hath washt away,<br>
 And throwne it vp vnto my brothers share:<br>
 So his encreased, but mine did empaire.<br>
 Before which time I lou'd, as was my lot,<br>
 That further mayd, hight <i>Philtera</i> the faire,<br>
 With whom a goodly doure I should haue got,<br>
 And should haue ioyned bene to her in wedlocks knot.</p><p>
 
 Then did my younger brother <i>Amidas</i><br>
 Loue that same other Damzell, <i>Lucy</i> bright,<br>
 To whom but little dowre allotted was;<br>
 Her vertue was the dowre, that did delight.<br>
 What better dowre can to a dame be hight?<br>
 But now when <i>Philtra</i> saw my lands decay,<br>
 And former liuelod fayle, she left me quight,<br>
 And to my brother did ellope streight way:<br>
 Who taking her from me, his owne loue left astray.</p><p>
 
 She seeing then her selfe forsaken so,<br>
 Through dolorous despaire, which she conceyued,<br>
 Into the Sea her selfe did headlong throw,<br>
 Thinking to haue her griefe by death bereaued.<br>
 But see how much her purpose was deceaued.<br>
 Whilest thus amidst the billowes beating of her<br>
 Twixt life and death, long to and fro she weaued,<br>
 She chaunst vnwares to light vppon this coffer,<br>
 Which to her in that daunger hope of life did offer.</p><p>
 
 The wretched mayd that earst desir'd to die,<br>
 When as the paine of death she tasted had,<br>
 And but halfe seene his vgly visnomie,<br>
 Gan to repent, that she had beene so mad,<br>
 For any death to chaunge life though most bad:<br>
 And catching hold of this Sea-beaten chest,<br>
 The lucky Pylot of her passage sad,<br>
 After long tossing in the seas distrest,<br>
 Her weary barke at last vppon mine Isle did rest.</p><p>
 
 Where I by chaunce then wandring on the shore,<br>
 Did her espy, and through my good endeuour<br>
 From dreadfull mouth of death, which threatned sore<br>
 Her to haue swallow'd vp, did helpe to saue her.<br>
 She then in recompence of that great fauour,<br>
 Which I on her bestowed, bestowed on me<br>
 The portion of that good, which Fortune gaue her,<br>
 Together with her selfe in dowry free;<br>
 Both goodly portions, but of both the better she.</p><p>
 
 Yet in this coffer, which she with her brought,<br>
 Great threasure sithence we did finde contained;<br>
 Which as our owne we tooke, and so it thought.<br>
 But this same other Damzell since hath fained,<br>
 That to her selfe that threasure appertained;<br>
 And that she did transport the same by sea,<br>
 To bring it to her husband new ordained,<br>
 But suffred cruell shipwracke by the way.<br>
 But whether it be so or no, I can not say.</p><p>
 
 But whether it indeede be so or no,<br>
 This doe I say, that what so good or ill<br>
 Or God or Fortune vnto me did throw,<br>
 Not wronging any other by my will,<br>
 I hold mine owne, and so will hold it still.<br>
 And though my land he first did winne away,<br>
 And then my loue (though now it little skill,)<br>
 Yet my good lucke he shall not likewise pray;<br>
 But I will it defend, whilst euer that I may.</p><p>
 
 So hauing sayd, the younger did ensew;<br>
 Full true it is, what so about our land<br>
 My brother here declared hath to you:<br>
 But not for it this ods twixt vs doth stand,<br>
 But for this threasure throwne vppon his strand;<br>
 Which well I proue, as shall appeare by triall,<br>
 To be this maides, with whom I fastned hand,<br>
 Known by good markes, and perfect good espiall,<br>
 Therefore it ought be rendred her without deniall.</p><p>
 
 When they thus ended had, the Knight began;<br>
 Certes your strife were easie to accord,<br>
 Would ye remit it to some righteous man.<br>
 Vnto your selfe, said they, we giue our word,<br>
 To bide what iudgement ye shall vs afford.<br>
 Then for assuraunce to my doome to stand,<br>
 Vnder my foote let each lay downe his sword,<br>
 And then you shall my sentence vnderstand.<br>
 So each of them layd downe his sword out of his hand.</p><p>
 
 Then <i>Artegall</i> thus to the younger sayd;<br>
 Now tell me <i>Amidas</i>, if that ye may,<br>
 Your brothers land the which the sea hath layd<br>
 Vnto your part, and pluckt from his away,<br>
 By what good right doe you withhold this day?<br>
 What other right (quoth he) should you esteeme,<br>
 But that the sea it to my share did lay?<br>
 Your right is good (sayd he) and so I deeme,<br>
 That what the sea vnto you sent, your own should seeme.</p><p>
 
 Then turning to the elder thus he sayd;<br>
 Now <i>Bracidas</i> let this likewise be showne.<br>
 Your brothers threasure, which from him is strayd,<br>
 Being the dowry of his wife well knowne,<br>
 By what right doe you claime to be your owne?<br>
 What other right (quoth he) should you esteeme,<br>
 But that the sea hath it vnto me throwne?<br>
 Your right is good (sayd he) and so I deeme,<br>
 That what the sea vnto you sent, your own should seeme.</p><p>
 
 For equall right in equall things doth stand,<br>
 For what the mighty Sea hath once possest,<br>
 And plucked quite from all possessors hand,<br>
 Whether by rage of waues, that neuer rest,<br>
 Or else by wracke, that wretches hath distrest,<br>
 He may dispose by his imperiall might,<br>
 As thing at randon left, to whom he list.<br>
 So <i>Amidas</i>, the land was yours first hight,<br>
 And so the threasure yours is <i>Bracidas</i> by right.</p><p>
 
 When he his sentence thus pronounced had,<br>
 Both <i>Amidas</i> and <i>Philtra</i> were displeased:<br>
 But <i>Bracidas</i> and <i>Lucy</i> were right glad,<br>
 And on the threasure by that iudgement seased.<br>
 So was their discord by this doome appeased,<br>
 And each one had his right.  Then <i>Artegall</i><br>
 When as their sharpe contention he had ceased,<br>
 Departed on his way, as did befall,<br>
 To follow his old quest, the which him forth did call.</p><p>
 
 So as he trauelled vppon the way,<br>
 He chaunst to come, where happily he spide<br>
 A rout of many people farre away;<br>
 To whom his course he hastily applide,<br>
 To weete the cause of their assemblaunce wide.<br>
 To whom when he approched neare in sight,<br>
 (An vncouth sight) he plainely then descride<br>
 To be a troupe of women warlike dight,<br>
 With weapons in their hands, as ready for to fight.</p><p>
 
 And in the midst of them he saw a Knight,<br>
 With both his hands behinde him pinnoed hard,<br>
 And round about his necke an halter tight,<br>
 As ready for the gallow tree prepard:<br>
 His face was couered, and his head was bar'd,<br>
 That who he was, vneath was to descry;<br>
 And with full heauy heart with them he far'd,<br>
 Grieu'd to the soule, and groning inwardly,<br>
 That he of womens hands so base a death should dy.</p><p>
 
 But they like tyrants, mercilesse the more,<br>
 Reioyced at his miserable case,<br>
 And him reuiled, and reproched sore<br>
 With bitter taunts, and termes of vile disgrace.<br>
 Now when as <i>Artegall</i> arriu'd in place,<br>
 Did aske, what cause brought that man to decay,<br>
 They round about him gan to swarme apace,<br>
 Meaning on him their cruell hands to lay,<br>
 And to haue wrought vnwares some villanous assay.</p><p>
 
 But he was soone aware of their ill minde,<br>
 And drawing backe deceiued their intent;<br>
 Yet though him selfe did shame on womankinde<br>
 His mighty hand to shend, he <i>Talus</i> sent<br>
 To wrecke on them their follies hardyment:<br>
 Who with few sowces of his yron flale,<br>
 Dispersed all their troupe incontinent,<br>
 And sent them home to tell a piteous tale,<br>
 Of their vaine prowesse, turned to their proper bale.</p><p>
 
 But that same wretched man, ordaynd to die,<br>
 They left behind them, glad to be so quit:<br>
 Him <i>Talus</i> tooke out of perplexitie,<br>
 And horrour of fowle death for Knight vnfit,<br>
 Who more then losse of life ydreaded it;<br>
 And him restoring vnto liuing light,<br>
 So brought vnto his Lord, where he did sit,<br>
 Beholding all that womanish weake fight;<br>
 Whom soone as he beheld, he knew, and thus behight.</p><p>
 
 Sir <i>Terpine</i>, haplesse man, what make you here?<br>
 Or haue you lost your selfe, and your discretion,<br>
 That euer in this wretched case ye were?<br>
 Or haue ye yeelded you to proude oppression<br>
 Of womens powre, that boast of mens subiection?<br>
 Or else what other deadly dismall day<br>
 Is falne on you, by heauens hard direction,<br>
 That ye were runne so fondly far astray,<br>
 As for to lead your selfe vnto your owne decay?</p><p>
 
 Much was the man confounded in his mind,<br>
 Partly with shame, and partly with dismay,<br>
 That all astonisht he him selfe did find,<br>
 And little had for his excuse to say,<br>
 But onely thus; Most haplesse well ye may<br>
 Me iustly terme, that to this shame am brought,<br>
 And made the scorne of Knighthod this same day.<br>
 But who can scape, what his owne fate hath wrought?<br>
 The worke of heauens will surpasseth humaine thought.</p><p>
 
 Right true: but faulty men vse oftentimes<br>
 To attribute their folly vnto fate,<br>
 And lay on heauen the guilt of their owne crimes.<br>
 But tell, Sir <i>Terpin</i>, ne let you amate<br>
 Your misery, how fell ye in this state.<br>
 Then sith ye needs (quoth he) will know my shame,<br>
 And all the ill, which chaunst to me of late,<br>
 I shortly will to you rehearse the same,<br>
 In hope ye will not turne misfortune to my blame</p><p>
 
 Being desirous (as all Knights are woont)<br>
 Through hard aduentures deedes of armes to try,<br>
 And after fame and honour for to hunt,<br>
 I heard report that farre abrode did fly,<br>
 That a proud Amazon did late defy<br>
 All the braue Knights, that hold of Maidenhead,<br>
 And vnto them wrought all the villany,<br>
 That she could forge in her malicious head,<br>
 Which some hath put to shame, and many done be dead.</p><p>
 
 The cause, they say, of this her cruell hate,<br>
 Is for the sake of <i>Bellodant</i> the bold,<br>
 To whom she bore most feruent loue of late,<br>
 And wooed him by all the waies she could:<br>
 But when she saw at last, that he ne would<br>
 For ought or nought be wonne vnto her will,<br>
 She turn'd her loue to hatred manifold,<br>
 And for his sake vow'd to doe all the ill<br>
 Which she could doe to Knights, which now she doth fulfill.</p><p>
 
 For all those Knights, the which by force or guile<br>
 She doth subdue, she fowly doth entreate.<br>
 First she doth them of warlike armes despoile,<br>
 And cloth in womens weedes: And then with threat<br>
 Doth them compell to worke, to earne their meat,<br>
 To spin, to card, to sew, to wash, to wring;<br>
 Ne doth she giue them other thing to eat,<br>
 But bread and water, or like feeble thing,<br>
 Them to disable from reuenge aduenturing.</p><p>
 
 But if through stout disdaine of manly mind,<br>
 Any her proud obseruaunce will withstand,<br>
 Vppon that gibbet, which is there behind,<br>
 She causeth them be hang'd vp out of hand;<br>
 In which condition I right now did stand.<br>
 For being ouercome by her in fight,<br>
 And put to that base seruice of her band,<br>
 I rather chose to die in liues despight,<br>
 Then lead that shamefull life, vnworthy of a Knight.</p><p>
 
 How hight that Amazon (sayd <i>Artegall?</i>)<br>
 And where, and how far hence does she abide?<br>
 Her name (quoth he) they <i>Radigund</i> doe call,<br>
 A Princesse of great powre, and greater pride,<br>
 And Queene of Amazons, in armes well tride,<br>
 And sundry battels, which she hath atchieued<br>
 With great successe, that her hath glorifide,<br>
 And made her famous, more then is belieued;<br>
 Ne would I it haue ween'd, had I not late it prieued.</p><p>
 
 Now sure (said he) and by the faith that I<br>
 To Maydenhead and noble knighthood owe,<br>
 I will not rest, till I her might doe trie,<br>
 And venge the shame, that she to Knights doth show.<br>
 Therefore Sir <i>Terpin</i> from you lightly throw<br>
 This squalid weede, the patterne of dispaire,<br>
 And wend with me, that ye may see and know,<br>
 How Fortune will your ruin'd name repaire,<br>
 And knights of Maidenhead, whose praise she would empaire.</p><p>
 
 With that, like one that hopelesse was repryu'd<br>
 From deathes dore, at which he lately lay,<br>
 Those yron fetters, wherewith he was gyu'd,<br>
 The badges of reproch, he threw away,<br>
 And nimbly did him dight to guide the way<br>
 Vnto the dwelling of that Amazone.<br>
 Which was from thence not past a mile or tway:<br>
 A goodly citty and a mighty one,<br>
 The which of her owne name she called <i>Radigone</i>.</p><p>
 
 Where they arriuing, by the watchmen were<br>
 Descried streight; who all the citty warned,<br>
 How that three warlike persons did appeare,<br>
 Of which the one him seem'd a Knight all armed,<br>
 And th'other two well likely to haue harmed.<br>
 Eftsoones the people all to harnesse ran,<br>
 And like a sort of Bees in clusters swarmed:<br>
 Ere long their Queene her selfe, halfe like a man<br>
 Came forth into the rout, and them t'array began.</p><p>
 
 And now the Knights being arriued neare,<br>
 Did beat vppon the gates to enter in,<br>
 And at the Porter, skorning them so few,<br>
 Threw many threats, if they the towne did win,<br>
 To teare his flesh in peeces for his sin.<br>
 Which when as <i>Radigund</i> there comming heard,<br>
 Her heart for rage did grate, and teeth did grin:<br>
 She bad that streight the gates should be vnbard,<br>
 And to them way to make, with weapons well prepard.</p><p>
 
 Soone as the gates were open to them set,<br>
 They pressed forward, entraunce to haue made.<br>
 But in the middle way they were ymet<br>
 With a sharpe showre of arrowes, which them staid,<br>
 And better bad aduise, ere they assaid<br>
 Vnknowen perill of bold womens pride.<br>
 Then all that rout vppon them rudely laid,<br>
 And heaped strokes so fast on euery side,<br>
 And arrowes haild so thicke, that they could not abide.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Radigund</i> her selfe, when she espide<br>
 Sir <i>Terpin</i>, from her direfull doome acquit,<br>
 So cruell doale amongst her maides dauide,<br>
 T'auenge that shame, they did on him commit;<br>
 All sodainely enflam'd with furious fit,<br>
 Like a fell Lionesse at him she flew,<br>
 And on his head-peece him so fiercely smit,<br>
 That to the ground him quite she ouerthrew,<br>
 Dismayd so with the stroke, that he no colours knew.</p><p>
 
 Soone as she saw him on the ground to grouell,<br>
 She lightly to him leapt, and in his necke<br>
 Her proud foote setting, at his head did leuell,<br>
 Weening at once her wrath on him to wreake,<br>
 And his contempt, that did her iudg'ment breake.<br>
 As when a Beare hath seiz'd her cruell clawes<br>
 Vppon the carkasse of some beast too weake,<br>
 Proudly stands ouer, and a while doth pause,<br>
 To heare the piteous beast pleading her plaintiffe cause.</p><p>
 
 Whom when as <i>Artegall</i> in that distresse<br>
 By chaunce beheld, he left the bloudy slaughter,<br>
 In which he swam, and ranne to his redresse.<br>
 There her assayling fiercely fresh, he raught her<br>
 Such an huge stroke, that it of sence distraught her:<br>
 And had she not it warded warily,<br>
 It had depriu'd her mother of a daughter.<br>
 Nathlesse for all the powre she did apply,<br>
 It made her stagger oft, and stare with ghastly eye.</p><p>
 
 Like to an Eagle in his kingly pride,<br>
 Soring through his wide Empire of the aire,<br>
 To weather his brode sailes, by chaunce hath spide<br>
 A Goshauke, which hath seized for her share<br>
 Vppon some fowle, that should her feast prepare;<br>
 With dreadfull force he flies at her byliue,<br>
 That with his souce, which none enduren dare,<br>
 Her from the quarrey he away doth driue,<br>
 And from her griping pounce the greedy prey doth riue.</p><p>
 
 But soone as she her sence recouer'd had,<br>
 She fiercely towards him her selfe gan dight,<br>
 Through vengeful wrath &amp; sdeignfull pride half mad:<br>
 For neuer had she suffred such despight.<br>
 But ere she could ioyne hand with him to fight,<br>
 Her warlike maides about her flockt so fast,<br>
 That they disparted them, maugre their might,<br>
 And with their troupes did far a sunder cast:<br>
 But mongst the rest the fight did vntill euening last.</p><p>
 
 And euery while that mighty yron man,<br>
 With his strange weapon, neuer wont in warre,<br>
 Them sorely vext, and courst, and ouerran,<br>
 And broke their bowes, and did their shooting marre,<br>
 That none of all the many once did darre<br>
 Him to assault, nor once approach him nie,<br>
 But like a sort of sheepe dispersed farre<br>
 For dread of their deuouring enemie,<br>
 Through all the fields and vallies did before him flie.</p><p>
 
 But when as daies faire shinie-beame, yclowded<br>
 With fearefull shadowes of deformed night,<br>
 Warn'd man and beast in quiet rest be shrowded,<br>
 Bold <i>Radigund</i> with sound of trumpe on hight,<br>
 Causd all her people to surcease from fight,<br>
 And gathering them vnto her citties gate,<br>
 Made them all enter in before her sight,<br>
 And all the wounded, and the weake in state,<br>
 To be conuayed in, ere she would once retrate.</p><p>
 
 When thus the field was voided all away,<br>
 And all things quieted, the Elfin Knight<br>
 Weary of toile and trauell of that day,<br>
 Causd his pauilion to be richly pight<br>
 Before the city gate, in open sight;<br>
 Where he him selfe did rest in safety,<br>
 Together with sir <i>Terpin</i> all that night:<br>
 But <i>Talus</i> vsde in times of ieopardy<br>
 To keepe a nightly watch, for dread of treachery.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Radigund</i> full of heart-gnawing griefe,<br>
 For the rebuke, which she sustain'd that day,<br>
 Could take no rest, ne would receiue reliefe,<br>
 But tossed in her troublous minde, what way<br>
 She mote reuenge that blot, which on her lay.<br>
 There she resolu'd her selfe in single fight<br>
 To try her Fortune, and his force assay,<br>
 Rather then see her people spoiled quight,<br>
 As she had seene that day a disauenterous sight.</p><p>
 
 She called forth to her a trusty mayd,<br>
 Whom she thought fittest for that businesse,<br>
 Her name was <i>Clarin</i>, and thus to her sayd;<br>
 Goe damzell quickly, doe thy selfe addresse,<br>
 To doe the message, which I shall expresse.<br>
 Goe thou vnto that stranger Faery Knight,<br>
 Who yesterday droue vs to such distresse,<br>
 Tell, that to morrow I with him will fight,<br>
 And try in equall field, whether hath greater might.</p><p>
 
 But these conditions doe to him propound,<br>
 That if I vanquishe him, he shall obay<br>
 My law, and euer to my lore be bound;<br>
 And so will I, if me he vanquish may,<br>
 What euer he shall like to doe or say.<br>
 Goe streight, and take with thee, to witnesse it,<br>
 Sixe of thy fellowes of the best array,<br>
 And beare with you both wine and iuncates fit,<br>
 And bid him eate, henceforth he oft shall hungry sit.</p><p>
 
 The Damzell streight obayd, and putting all<br>
 In readinesse, forth to the Towne-gate went;<br>
 Where sounding loud a Trumpet from the wall,<br>
 Vnto those warlike Knights she warning sent.<br>
 Then <i>Talus</i> forth issuing from the tent,<br>
 Vnto the wall his way did fearelesse take,<br>
 To weeten what that trumpets sounding ment:<br>
 Where that same Damzell lowdly him bespake,<br>
 And shew'd, that with his Lord she would emparlaunce make.</p><p>
 
 So he them streight conducted to his Lord,<br>
 Who, as he could, them goodly well did greete,<br>
 Till they had told their message word by word:<br>
 Which he accepting well, as he could weete,<br>
 Them fairely entertaynd with curt'sies meete,<br>
 And gaue them gifts and things of deare delight.<br>
 So backe againe they homeward turnd their feete.<br>
 But <i>Artegall</i> him selfe to rest did dight,<br>
 That he mote fresher be against the next daies fight.</p><p>
