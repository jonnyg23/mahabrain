 <i>Paridell rapeth Hellenore:<br>
 Malbecco her pursewes:<br>
 Findes emongst Satyres, whence with him<br>
 To turne she doth refuse.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 T
 He morow next, so soone as <i>Phoebus</i> Lamp<br>
 Bewrayed had the world with early light,<br>
 And fresh <i>Aurora</i> had the shady damp<br>
 Out of the goodly heauen amoued quight,<br>
 Faire <i>Britomart</i> and that same <i>Faerie</i> knight<br>
 Vprose, forth on their iourney for to wend:<br>
 But <i>Paridell</i> complaynd, that his late fight<br>
 With <i>Britomart</i>, so sore did him offend,<br>
 That ryde he could not, till his hurts he did amend.<p>
 
 So forth they far'd, but he behind them stayd,<br>
 Maulgre his host, who grudged grieuously,<br>
 To house a guest, that would be needes obayd,<br>
 And of his owne him left not liberty:<br>
 Might wanting measure moueth surquedry.<br>
 Two things he feared, but the third was death;<br>
 That fierce young mans vnruly maistery;<br>
 His money, which he lou'd as liuing breath;<br>
 And his faire wife, whom honest long he kept vneath.</p><p>
 
 But patience perforce he must abie,<br>
 What fortune and his fate on him will lay,<br>
 Fond is the feare, that findes no remedie;<br>
 Yet warily he watcheth euery way,<br>
 By which he feareth euill happen may:<br>
 So th'euill thinkes by watching to preuent;<br>
 Ne doth he suffer her, nor night, nor day,<br>
 Out of his sight her selfe once to absent.<br>
 So doth he punish her and eke himselfe torment.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Paridell</i> kept better watch, then hee,<br>
 A fit occasion for his turne to find:<br>
 False loue, why do men say, thou canst not see,<br>
 And in their foolish fancie feigne thee blind,<br>
 That with thy charmes the sharpest sight doest bind,<br>
 And to thy will abuse?  Thou walkest free,<br>
 And seest euery secret of the mind;<br>
 Thou seest all, yet none at all sees thee;<br>
 All that is by the working of thy Deitee.</p><p>
 
 So perfect in that art was <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
 That he <i>Malbeccoes</i> halfen eye did wyle,<br>
 His halfen eye he wiled wondrous well,<br>
 And <i>Hellenors</i> both eyes did eke beguyle,<br>
 Both eyes and hart attonce, during the whyle<br>
 That he there soiourned his wounds to heale;<br>
 That <i>Cupid</i> selfe it seeing, close did smyle,<br>
 To weet how he her loue away did steale,<br>
 And bad, that none their ioyous treason should reueale.</p><p>
 
 The learned louer lost no time nor tyde,<br>
 That least auantage mote to him afford,<br>
 Yet bore so faire a saile, that none espyde<br>
 His secret drift, till he her layd abord.<br>
 When so in open place, and commune bord,<br>
 He fortun'd her to meet, with commune speach<br>
 He courted her, yet bayted euery word,<br>
 That his vngentle hoste n'ote him appeach<br>
 Of vile vngentlenesse, or hospitages breach.</p><p>
 
 But when apart (if euer her apart)<br>
 He found, then his false engins fast he plyde,<br>
 And all the sleights vnbosomd in his hart;<br>
 He sigh'd, he sobd, he swownd, he perdy dyde,<br>
 And cast himselfe on ground her fast besyde:<br>
 Tho when againe he him bethought to liue,<br>
 He wept, and wayld, and false laments belyde,<br>
 Saying, but if she Mercie would him giue<br>
 That he mote algates dye, yet did his death forgiue.</p><p>
 
 And otherwhiles with amorous delights,<br>
 And pleasing toyes he would her entertaine,<br>
 Now singing sweetly, to surprise her sprights,<br>
 Now making layes of loue and louers paine,<br>
 Bransles, Ballads, virelayes, and verses vaine;<br>
 Oft purposes, oft riddles he deuysd,<br>
 And thousands like, which flowed in his braine,<br>
 With which he fed her fancie, and entysd<br>
 To take to his new loue, and leaue her old despysd.</p><p>
 
 And euery where he might, and euery while<br>
 He did her seruice dewtifull, and sewed<br>
 At hand with humble pride, and pleasing guile,<br>
 So closely yet, that none but she it vewed,<br>
 Who well perceiued all, and all indewed.<br>
 Thus finely did he his false nets dispred,<br>
 With which he many weake harts had subdewed<br>
 Of yore, and many had ylike misled:<br>
 What wonder then, if she were likewise carried?</p><p>
 
 No fort so fensible, no wals so strong,<br>
 But that continuall battery will riue,<br>
 Or daily siege through dispuruayance long,<br>
 And lacke of reskewes will to parley driue;<br>
 And Peece, that vnto parley eare will giue,<br>
 Will shortly yeeld it selfe, and will be made<br>
 The vassall of the victors will byliue:<br>
 That stratageme had oftentimes assayd<br>
 This crafty Paramoure, and now it plaine displayd.</p><p>
 
 For through his traines he her intrapped hath,<br>
 That she her loue and hart hath wholy sold<br>
 To him, without regard of gaine, or scath,<br>
 Or care of credite, or of husband old,<br>
 Whom she hath vow'd to dub a faire Cucquold.<br>
 Nought wants but time and place, which shortly shee<br>
 Deuized hath, and to her louer told.<br>
 It pleased well.  So well they both agree;<br>
 So readie rype to ill, ill wemens counsels bee.</p><p>
 
 Darke was the Euening, fit for louers stealth,<br>
 When chaunst <i>Malbecco</i> busie be elsewhere,<br>
 She to his closet went, where all his wealth<br>
 Lay hid: thereof she countlesse summes did reare,<br>
 The which she meant away with her to beare;<br>
 The rest she fyr'd for sport, or for despight;<br>
 As <i>Hellene</i>, when she saw aloft appeare<br>
 The <i>Troiane</i> flames, and reach to heauens hight<br>
 Did clap her hands, and ioyed at that dolefull sight.</p><p>
 
 This second <i>Hellene</i>, faire Dame <i>Hellenore</i>,<br>
 The whiles her husband ranne with sory haste,<br>
 To quench the flames, which she had tyn'd before,<br>
 Laught at his foolish labour spent in waste;<br>
 And ranne into her louers armes right fast;<br>
 Where streight embraced, she to him did cry,<br>
 And call aloud for helpe, ere helpe were past;<br>
 For loe that Guest would beare her forcibly,<br>
 And meant to rauish her, that rather had to dy.</p><p>
 
 The wretched man hearing her call for ayd,<br>
 And readie seeing him with her to fly,<br>
 In his disquiet mind was much dismayd:<br>
 But when againe he backward cast his eye,<br>
 And saw the wicked fire so furiously<br>
 Consume his hart, and scorch his Idoles face,<br>
 He was therewith distressed diuersly,<br>
 Ne wist he how to turne, nor to what place;<br>
 Was neuer wretched man in such a wofull cace.</p><p>
 
 Ay when to him she cryde, to her he turnd,<br>
 And left the fire; loue money ouercame:<br>
 But when he marked, how his money burnd,<br>
 He left his wife; money did loue disclame:<br>
 Both was he loth to loose his loued Dame,<br>
 And loth to leaue his liefest pelfe behind,<br>
 Yet sith he n'ote saue both, he sau'd that same,<br>
 Which was the dearest to his donghill mind,<br>
 The God of his desire, the ioy of misers blind.</p><p>
 
 Thus whilest all things in troublous vprore were,<br>
 And all men busie to suppresse the flame,<br>
 The louing couple need no reskew feare,<br>
 But leasure had, and libertie to frame<br>
 Their purpost flight, free from all mens reclame;<br>
 And Night, the patronesse of loue-stealth faire,<br>
 Gaue them safe conduct, till to end they came:<br>
 So bene they gone yfeare, a wanton paire<br>
 Of louers loosely knit, where list them to repaire.</p><p>
 
 Soone as the cruell flames yslaked were,<br>
 <i>Malbecco</i> seeing, how his losse did lye,<br>
 Out of the flames, which he had quencht whylere<br>
 Into huge waues of griefe and gealosye<br>
 Full deepe emplonged was, and drowned nye,<br>
 Twixt inward doole and felonous despight;<br>
 He rau'd, he wept, he stampt, he lowd did cry,<br>
 And all the passions, that in man may light,<br>
 Did him attonce oppresse, and vex his caytiue spright.</p><p>
 
 Long thus he chawd the cud of inward griefe,<br>
 And did consume his gall with anguish sore,<br>
 Still when he mused on his late mischiefe,<br>
 Then still the smart thereof increased more,<br>
 And seem'd more grieuous, then it was before:<br>
 At last when sorrow he saw booted nought,<br>
 Ne griefe might not his loue to him restore,<br>
 He gan deuise, how her he reskew mought,<br>
 Ten thousand wayes he cast in his confused thought.</p><p>
 
 At last resoluing, like a pilgrim pore,<br>
 To sea[r]ch her forth, where so she might be fond,<br>
 And bearing with him treasure in close store,<br>
 The rest he leaues in ground: so takes in hond<br>
 To seeke her endlong, both by sea and lond.<br>
 Long he her sought, he sought her farre and nere,<br>
 And euery where that he mote vnderstond,<br>
 Of knights and ladies any meetings were,<br>
 And of eachone he met, he tydings did inquere.</p><p>
 
 But all in vaine, his woman was too wise,<br>
 Euer to come into his clouch againe,<br>
 And he too simple euer to surprise<br>
 The iolly <i>Paridell</i>, for all his paine.<br>
 One day, as he forpassed by the plaine<br>
 With weary pace, he farre away espide<br>
 A couple, seeming well to be his twaine,<br>
 Which houed close vnder a forrest side,<br>
 As if they lay in wait, or else themselues did hide.</p><p>
 
 Well weened he, that those the same mote bee,<br>
 And as he better did their shape auize,<br>
 Him seemed more their manner did agree;<br>
 For th'one was armed all in warlike wize,<br>
 Whom, to be <i>Paridell</i> he did deuize;<br>
 And th'other all yclad in garments light,<br>
 Discolour'd like to womanish disguise,<br>
 He did resemble to his Ladie bright;<br>
 And euer his faint hart much earned at the sight.</p><p>
 
 And euer faine he towards them would goe,<br>
 But yet durst not for dread approchen nie,<br>
 But stood aloofe, vnweeting what to doe;<br>
 Till that prickt forth with loues extremitie,<br>
 That is the father of fowle gealosy,<br>
 He closely nearer crept, the truth to weet:<br>
 But, as he nigher drew, he easily<br>
 Might scerne, that it was not his sweetest sweet,<br>
 Ne yet her Belamour, the partner of his sheet.</p><p>
 
 But it was scornefull <i>Braggadocchio</i>,<br>
 That with his seruant <i>Trompart</i> houerd there,<br>
 Sith late he fled from his too earnest foe:<br>
 Whom such when as <i>Malbecco</i> spyed clere,<br>
 He turned backe, and would haue fled arere;<br>
 Till <i>Trompart</i> ronning hastily, him did stay,<br>
 And bad before his soueraine Lord appere:<br>
 That was him loth, yet durst he not gainesay,<br>
 And comming him before, low louted on the lay.</p><p>
 
 The Boaster at him sternely bent his browe,<br>
 As if he could haue kild him with his looke,<br>
 That to the ground him meekely made to bowe,<br>
 And awfull terror deepe into him strooke,<br>
 That euery member of his bodie quooke.<br>
 Said he, thou man of nought, what doest thou here,<br>
 Vnfitly furnisht with thy bag and booke,<br>
 Where I expected one with shield and spere,<br>
 To proue some deedes of armes vpon an equall pere.</p><p>
 
 The wretched man at his imperious speach,<br>
 Was all abasht, and low prostrating, said;<br>
 Good Sir, let not my rudenesse be no breach<br>
 Vnto your patience, ne be ill ypaid;<br>
 For I vnwares this way by fortune straid,<br>
 A silly Pilgrim driuen to distresse,<br>
 That seeke a Lady,---There he suddein staid,<br>
 And did the rest with grieuous sighes suppresse,<br>
 While teares stood in his eies, few drops of bitternesse.</p><p>
 
 What Ladie, man? (said <i>Trompart</i>) take good hart,<br>
 And tell thy griefe, if any hidden lye;<br>
 Was neuer better time to shew thy smart,<br>
 Then now, that noble succour is thee by,<br>
 That is the whole worlds commune remedy.<br>
 That cheareful word his weake hart much did cheare,<br>
 And with vaine hope his spirits faint supply,<br>
 That bold he said; ô most redoubted Pere,<br>
 Vouchsafe with mild regard a wretches cace to heare.</p><p>
 
 Then sighing sore, It is not long (said he)<br>
 Sith I enioyd the gentlest Dame aliue;<br>
 Of whom a knight, no knight at all perdee,<br>
 But shame of all, that doe for honor striue,<br>
 By treacherous deceipt did me depriue;<br>
 Through open outrage he her bore away,<br>
 And with fowle force vnto his will did driue,<br>
 Which all good knights, that armes do beare this day,<br>
 Are bound for to reuenge, and punish if they may.</p><p>
 
 And you most noble Lord, that can and dare<br>
 Redresse the wrong of miserable wight,<br>
 Cannot employ your most victorious speare<br>
 In better quarrell, then defence of right,<br>
 And for a Ladie gainst a faithlesse knight;<br>
 So shall your glory be aduaunced much,<br>
 And all faire Ladies magnifie your might,<br>
 And eke my selfe, albe I simple such,<br>
 Your worthy paine shall well reward with guerdon rich.</p><p>
 
 With that out of his bouget forth he drew<br>
 Great store of treasure, therewith him to tempt;<br>
 But he on it lookt scornefully askew,<br>
 As much disdeigning to be so misdempt,<br>
 Or a war-monger to be basely nempt;<br>
 And said; Thy offers base I greatly loth,<br>
 And eke thy words vncourteous and vnkempt;<br>
 I tread in dust thee and thy money both,<br>
 That, were it not for shame,---So turned from him wroth.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Trompart</i>, that his maisters humor knew,<br>
 In lofty lookes to hide an humble mind,<br>
 Was inly tickled with that golden vew,<br>
 And in his eare him rounded close behind:<br>
 Yet stoupt he not, but lay still in the wind,<br>
 Waiting aduauntage on the pray to sease;<br>
 Till <i>Trompart</i> lowly to the ground inclind,<br>
 Besought him his great courage to appease,<br>
 And pardon simple man, that rash did him displease.</p><p>
 
 Bigge looking like a doughtie Doucepere,<br>
 At last he thus; Thou clod of vilest clay,<br>
 I pardon yield, and with thy rudenesse beare;<br>
 But weete henceforth, that all that golden pray,<br>
 And all that else the vaine world vaunten may,<br>
 I loath as doung, ne deeme my dew reward:<br>
 Fame is my meed, and glory vertues pray.<br>
 But minds of mortall men are muchell mard,<br>
 And mou'd amisse with massie mucks vnmeet regard.</p><p>
 
 And more, I graunt to thy great miserie<br>
 Gratious respect, thy wife shall backe be sent,<br>
 And that vile knight, who euer that he bee,<br>
 Which hath thy Lady reft, and knighthood shent,<br>
 By <i>Sanglamort</i> my sword, whose deadly dent<br>
 The bloud hath of so many thousands shed,<br>
 I sweare, ere long shall dearely it repent;<br>
 Ne he twixt heauen and earth shall hide his hed,<br>
 But soone he shall be found, and shortly doen be ded.</p><p>
 
 The foolish man thereat woxe wondrous blith,<br>
 As if the word so spoken, were halfe donne,<br>
 And humbly thanked him a thousand sith,<br>
 That had from death to life him newly wonne.<br>
 Tho forth the Boaster marching, braue begonne<br>
 His stolen steed to thunder furiously,<br>
 As if he heauen and hell would ouerronne,<br>
 And all the world confound with cruelty,<br>
 That much <i>Malbecco</i> ioyed in his iollity.</p><p>
 
 Thus long they three together traueiled,<br>
 Through many a wood, and many an vncouth way,<br>
 To seeke his wife, that was farre wandered:<br>
 But those two sought nought, but the present pray,<br>
 To weete the treasure, which he did bewray,<br>
 On which their eies and harts were wholly set,<br>
 With purpose, how they might it best betray;<br>
 For sith the houre, that first he did them let<br>
 The same behold, therewith their keene desires were whet.</p><p>
 
 It fortuned as they together far'd,<br>
 They spide, where <i>Paridell</i> came pricking fast<br>
 Vpon the plaine, the which himselfe prepar'd<br>
 To giust with that braue straunger knight a cast,<br>
 As on aduenture by the way he past:<br>
 Alone he rode without his Paragone;<br>
 For hauing filcht her bels, her vp he cast<br>
 To the wide world, and let her fly alone,<br>
 He nould be clogd.  So had he serued many one.</p><p>
 
 The gentle Lady, loose at randon left,<br>
 The greene-wood long did walke, and wander wide<br>
 At wilde aduenture, like a forlorne weft,<br>
 Till on a day the <i>Satyres</i> her espide<br>
 Straying alone withouten groome or guide;<br>
 Her vp they tooke, and with them home her led,<br>
 With them as housewife euer to abide,<br>
 To milk their gotes, and make them cheese and bred,<br>
 And euery one as commune good her handeled.</p><p>
 
 That shortly she <i>Malbecco</i> has forgot,<br>
 And eke Sir <i>Paridell</i>, all were he deare;<br>
 Who from her went to seeke another lot,<br>
 And now by fortune was arriued here,<br>
 Where those two guilers with <i>Malbecco</i> were:<br>
 Soone as the old man saw Sir <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
 He fainted, and was almost dead with feare,<br>
 Ne word he had to speake, his griefe to tell,<br>
 But to him louted low, and greeted goodly well.</p><p>
 
 And after asked him for <i>Hellenore</i>,<br>
 I take no keepe of her (said <i>Paridell</i>)<br>
 She wonneth in the forrest there before.<br>
 So forth he rode, as his aduenture fell;<br>
 The whiles the Boaster from his loftie sell<br>
 Faynd to alight, something amisse to mend;<br>
 But the fresh Swayne would not his leasure dwell,<br>
 But went his way; whom when he passed kend,<br>
 He vp remounted light, and after faind to wend.</p><p>
 
 Perdy nay (said <i>Malbecco</i>) shall ye not:<br>
 But let him passe as lightly, as he came:<br>
 For litle good of him is to be got,<br>
 And mickle perill to be put to shame.<br>
 But let vs go to seeke my dearest Dame,<br>
 Whom he hath left in yonder forrest wyld:<br>
 For of her safety in great doubt I am,<br>
 Least saluage beastes her person haue despoyld:<br>
 Then all the world is lost, and we in vaine haue toyld.</p><p>
 
 They all agree, and forward them addrest:<br>
 Ah but (said craftie <i>Trompart</i>) weete ye well,<br>
 That yonder in that wastefull wildernesse<br>
 Huge monsters haunt, and many dangers dwell;<br>
 Dragons, and Minotaures, and feendes of hell,<br>
 And many wilde woodmen, which robbe and rend<br>
 All trauellers; therefore aduise ye well,<br>
 Before ye enterprise that way to wend:<br>
 One may his iourney bring too soone to euill end.</p><p>
 
 <i>Malbecco</i> stopt in great astonishment,<br>
 And with pale eyes fast fixed on the rest,<br>
 Their counsell crau'd, in daunger imminent.<br>
 Said <i>Trompart</i>, You that are the most opprest<br>
 With burden of great treasure, I thinke best<br>
 Here for to stay in safetie behind;<br>
 My Lord and I will search the wide forrest.<br>
 That counsell pleased not <i>Malbeccoes</i> mind;<br>
 For he was much affraid, himselfe alone to find.</p><p>
 
 Then is it best (said he) that ye doe leaue<br>
 Your treasure here in some securitie,<br>
 Either fast closed in some hollow greaue,<br>
 Or buried in the ground from ieopardie,<br>
 Till we returne againe in safetie:<br>
 As for vs two, least doubt of vs ye haue,<br>
 Hence farre away we will blindfolded lie,<br>
 Ne priuie be vnto your treasures graue.<br>
 It pleased: so he did, Then they march forward braue.</p><p>
 
 Now when amid the thickest woods they were,<br>
 They heard a noyse of many bagpipes shrill,<br>
 And shrieking Hububs them approching nere,<br>
 Which all the forrest did with horror fill:<br>
 That dreadfull sound the boasters hart did thrill,<br>
 With such amazement, that in haste he fled,<br>
 Ne euer looked backe for good or ill,<br>
 And after him eke fearefull <i>Trompart</i> sped;<br>
 The old man could not fly, but fell to ground halfe ded.</p><p>
 
 Yet afterwards close creeping, as he might,<br>
 He in a bush did hide his fearefull hed,<br>
 The iolly <i>Satyres</i> full of fresh delight,<br>
 Came dauncing forth, and with them nimbly led<br>
 Faire <i>Hellenore</i>, with girlonds all bespred,<br>
 Whom their May-lady they had newly made:<br>
 She proud of that new honour, which they red,<br>
 And of their louely fellowship full glade,<br>
 Daunst liuely, and her face did with a Lawrell shade.</p><p>
 
 The silly man that in the thicket lay<br>
 Saw all this goodly sport, and grieued sore,<br>
 Yet durst he not against it doe or say,<br>
 But did his hart with bitter thoughts engore,<br>
 To see th'vnkindnesse of his <i>Hellenore</i>.<br>
 All day they daunced with great lustihed,<br>
 And with their horned feet the greene grasse wore,<br>
 The whiles their Gotes vpon the brouzes fed,<br>
 Till drouping <i>Phoebus</i> gan to hide his golden hed.</p><p>
 
 Tho vp they gan their merry pypes to trusse,<br>
 And all their goodly heards did gather round,<br>
 But euery <i>Satyre</i> first did giue a busse<br>
 To <i>Hellenore</i>: so busses did abound.<br>
 Now gan the humid vapour shed the ground<br>
 With perly deaw, and th'Earthes gloomy shade<br>
 Did dim the brightnesse of the welkin round,<br>
 That euery bird and beast awarned made,<br>
 To shrowd themselues, whiles sleepe their senses did inuade.</p><p>
 
 Which when <i>Malbecco</i> saw, out of his bush<br>
 Vpon his hands and feete he crept full light,<br>
 And like a Gote emongst the Gotes did rush,<br>
 That through the helpe of his faire hornes on hight,<br>
 And misty dampe of misconceiuing night,<br>
 And eke through likenesse of his gotish beard,<br>
 He did the better counterfeite aright:<br>
 So home he marcht emongst the horned heard,<br>
 That none of all the <i>Satyres</i> him espyde or heard.</p><p>
 
 At night, when all they went to sleepe, he vewd,<br>
 Whereas his louely wife emongst them lay,<br>
 Embraced of a <i>Satyre</i> rough and rude,<br>
 Who all the night did minde his ioyous play:<br>
 Nine times he heard him come aloft ere day,<br>
 That all his hart with gealosie did swell;<br>
 But yet that nights ensample did bewray,<br>
 That not for nought his wife them loued so well,<br>
 When one so oft a night did ring his matins bell.</p><p>
 
 So closely as he could, he to them crept,<br>
 When wearie of their sport to sleepe they fell,<br>
 And to his wife, that now full soundly slept,<br>
 He whispered in her eare, and did her tell,<br>
 That it was he, which by her side did dwell,<br>
 And therefore prayd her wake, to heare him plaine.<br>
 As one out of a dreame not waked well,<br>
 She turned her, and returned backe againe:<br>
 Yet her for to awake he did the more constraine.</p><p>
 
 At last with irkesome trouble she abrayd;<br>
 And then perceiuing, that it was indeed<br>
 Her old <i>Malbecco</i>, which did her vpbrayd,<br>
 With loosenesse of her loue, and loathly deed,<br>
 She was astonisht with exceeding dreed,<br>
 And would haue wakt the <i>Satyre</i> by her syde;<br>
 But he her prayd, for mercy, or for meed,<br>
 To saue his life, ne let him be descryde,<br>
 But hearken to his lore, and all his counsell hyde.</p><p>
 
 Tho gan he her perswade, to leaue that lewd<br>
 And loathsome life, of God and man abhord,<br>
 And home returne, where all should be renewd<br>
 With perfect peace, and bandes of fresh accord,<br>
 And she receiu'd againe to bed and bord,<br>
 As if no trespasse euer had bene donne:<br>
 But she it all refused at one word,<br>
 And by no meanes would to his will be wonne,<br>
 But chose emongst the iolly <i>Satyres</i> still to wonne.</p><p>
 
 He wooed her, till day spring he espyde;<br>
 But all in vaine: and then turnd to the heard,<br>
 Who butted him with hornes on euery syde,<br>
 And trode downe in the durt, where his hore beard<br>
 Was fowly dight, and he of death afeard.<br>
 Early before the heauens fairest light<br>
 Out of the ruddy East was fully reard,<br>
 The heardes out of their foldes were loosed quight,<br>
 And he emongst the rest crept forth in sory plight.</p><p>
 
 So soone as he the Prison dore did pas,<br>
 He ran as fast, as both his feete could beare,<br>
 And neuer looked, who behind him was,<br>
 Ne scarsely who before: like as a Beare<br>
 That creeping close, amongst the hiues to reare<br>
 An hony combe, the wakefull dogs espy,<br>
 And him assayling, sore his carkasse teare,<br>
 That hardly he with life away does fly,<br>
 Ne stayes, till safe himselfe he see from ieopardy.</p><p>
 
 Ne stayd he, till he came vnto the place,<br>
 Where late his treasure he entombed had,<br>
 Where when he found it not (for <i>Trompart</i> bace<br>
 Had it purloyned for his maister bad:)<br>
 With extreme fury he became quite mad,<br>
 And ran away, ran with himselfe away:<br>
 That who so straungely had him seene bestad,<br>
 With vpstart haire, and staring eyes dismay,<br>
 From Limbo lake him late escaped sure would say.</p><p>
 
 High ouer hilles and ouer dales he fled,<br>
 As if the wind him on his winges had borne,<br>
 Ne banck nor bush could stay him, when he sped<br>
 His nimble feet, as treading still on thorne:<br>
 Griefe, and despight, and gealosie, and scorne<br>
 Did all the way him follow hard behind,<br>
 And he himselfe himselfe loath'd so forlorne,<br>
 So shamefully forlorne of womankind;<br>
 That as a Snake, still lurked in his wounded mind.</p><p>
 
 Still fled he forward, looking backward still,<br>
 Ne stayd his flight, nor fearefull agony,<br>
 Till that he came vnto a rockie hill,<br>
 Ouer the sea, suspended dreadfully,<br>
 That liuing creature it would terrify,<br>
 To looke adowne, or vpward to the hight:<br>
 From thence he threw himselfe dispiteously,<br>
 All desperate of his fore-damned spright,<br>
 That seem'd no helpe for him was left in liuing sight.</p><p>
 
 But through long anguish, and selfe-murdring thought<br>
 He was so wasted and forpined quight,<br>
 That all his substance was consum'd to nought,<br>
 And nothing left, but like an aery Spright,<br>
 That on the rockes he fell so flit and light,<br>
 That he thereby receiu'd no hurt at all,<br>
 But chaunced on a craggy cliff to light;<br>
 Whence he with crooked clawes so long did crall,<br>
 That at the last he found a caue with entrance small.</p><p>
 
 Into the same he creepes, and thenceforth there<br>
 Resolu'd to build his balefull mansion,<br>
 In drery darkenesse, and continuall feare<br>
 Of that rockes fall, which euer and anon<br>
 Threates with huge ruine him to fall vpon,<br>
 That he dare neuer sleepe, but that one eye<br>
 Still ope he keepes for that occasion;<br>
 Ne euer rests he in tranquillity,<br>
 The roring billowes beat his bowre so boystrously.</p><p>
 
 Ne euer is he wont on ought to feed,<br>
 But toades and frogs, his pasture poysonous,<br>
 Which in his cold complexion do breed<br>
 A filthy bloud, or humour rancorous,<br>
 Matter of doubt and dread suspitious,<br>
 That doth with curelesse care consume the hart,<br>
 Corrupts the stomacke with gall vitious,<br>
 Croscuts the liuer with internall smart,<br>
 And doth transfixe the soule with deathes eternall dart.</p><p>
 
 Yet can he neuer dye, but dying liues,<br>
 And doth himselfe with sorrow new sustaine,<br>
 That death and life attonce vnto him giues.<br>
 And painefull pleasure turnes to pleasing paine.<br>
 There dwels he euer, miserable swaine,<br>
 Hatefull both to him selfe, and euery wight;<br>
 Where he through priuy griefe, and horrour vaine,<br>
 Is woxen so deform'd, that he has quight<br>
 Forgot he was a man, and <i>Gealosie</i> is hight.</p><p>
