 <i>Guyon does Furor bind in chaines,<br>

 <p>
 </p><blockquote> 
 I
 N braue pursuit of honorable deed,<br>
 There is I know not what great difference<br>
 Betweene the vulgar and the noble seed,<br>
 Which vnto things of valorous pretence<br>
 Seemes to be borne by natiue influence;<br>
 As feates of armes, and loue to entertaine,<br>
 But chiefly skill to ride, seemes a science<br>
 Proper to gentle bloud; some others faine<br>
 To menage steeds, as did this vaunter; but in vaine.<p>
  
 But he the rightfull owner of that steed,<br>
 Who well could menage and subdew his pride,<br>
 The whiles on foot was forced for to yeed,<br>
 With that blacke Palmer, his most trusty guide;<br>
 Who suffred not his wandring feet to slide.<br>
 But when strong passion, or weake fleshlinesse<br>
 Would from the right way seeke to draw him wide,<br>
 He would through temperance and stedfastnesse,<br>
 Teach him the weake to strengthen, &amp; the strõg suppresse.</p><p>
  
 It fortuned forth faring on his way,<br>
 He saw from farre, or seemed for to see<br>
 Some troublous vprore or contentious fray,<br>
 Whereto he drew in haste it to agree.<br>
 A mad man, or that feigned mad to bee,<br>
 Drew by the haire along vpon the ground,<br>
 A handsome stripling with great crueltee,<br>
 Whom sore he bett, and gor'd with many a wound,<br>
 That cheekes with teares, and sides with bloud did all abound.</p><p>
  
 And him behind, a wicked Hag did stalke,<br>
 In ragged robes, and filthy disaray,<br>
 Her other leg was lame, that she no'te walke,<br>
 But on a staffe her feeble steps did stay;<br>
 Her lockes, that loathly were and hoarie gray,<br>
 Grew all afore, and loosely hong vnrold,<br>
 But all behind was bald, and worne away,<br>
 That none thereof could euer taken hold,<br>
 And eke her face ill fauourd, full of wrinckles old.</p><p>
  
 And euer as she went, her tongue did walke<br>
 In foule reproch, and termes of vile despight,<br>
 Prouoking him by her outrageous talke,<br>
 To heape more vengeance on that wretched wight;<br>
 Sometimes she raught him stones, wherwith to smite,<br>
 Sometimes her staffe, though it her one leg were,<br>
 Withouten which she could not go vpright;<br>
 Ne any euill meanes she did forbeare,<br>
 That might him moue to wrath, and indignation reare.</p><p>
  
 The noble <i>Guyon</i> mou'd with great remorse,<br>
 Approching, first the Hag did thrust away,<br>
 And after adding more impetuous forse,<br>
 His mightie hands did on the madman lay,<br>
 And pluckt him backe; who all on fire streightway,<br>
 Against him turning all his fell intent,<br>
 With beastly brutish rage gan him assay,<br>
 And smot, and bit, and kickt, and scratcht, and rent,<br>
 And did he wist not what in his auengement.</p><p>
  
 And sure he was a man of mickle might,<br>
 Had he had gouernance, it well to guide:<br>
 But when the franticke fit inflamd his spright,<br>
 His force was vaine, and strooke more often wide,<br>
 Then at the aymed marke, which he had eide:<br>
 And oft himselfe he chaunst to hurt vnwares,<br>
 Whilst reason blent through passion, nought descride,<br>
 But as a blindfold Bull at randon fares,<br>
 And where he hits, nought knowes, &amp; whom he hurts, nought cares.</p><p>
  
 His rude assault and rugged handeling<br>
 Straunge seemed to the knight, that aye with foe<br>
 In faire defence and goodly menaging<br>
 Of armes was wont to fight, yet nathemoe<br>
 Was he abashed now not fighting so,<br>
 But more enfierced through his currish play,<br>
 Him sternely grypt, and haling to and fro,<br>
 To ouerthrow him strongly did assay,<br>
 But ouerthrew himselfe vnwares, and lower lay.</p><p>
  
 And being downe the villein sore did beat,<br>
 And bruze with clownish fistes his manly face:<br>
 And eke the Hag with many a bitter threat,<br>
 Still cald vpon to kill him in the place.<br>
 With whose reproch and odious menace<br>
 The knight emboyling in his haughtie hart,<br>
 Knit all his forces, and gan soone vnbrace<br>
 His grasping hold: so lightly did vpstart,<br>
 And drew his deadly weapon, to maintain his part.</p><p>
  
 Which when the Palmer saw, he loudly cryde,<br>
 Not so, ô <i>Guyon</i>, neuer thinke that so<br>
 That Monster can be maistred or destroyd:<br>
 He is not, ah, he is not such a foe,<br>
 As steele can wound, or strength can ouerthroe.<br>
 That same is <i>Furor</i>, cursed cruell wight,<br>
 That vnto knighthood workes much shame and woe;<br>
 And that same Hag, his aged mother, hight<br>
 <i>Occasion</i>, the root of all wrath and despight.</p><p>
  
 With her, who so will raging <i>Furor</i> tame,<br>
 Must first begin, and well her amenage:<br>
 First her restraine from her reprochfull blame,<br>
 And euill meanes, with which she doth enrage<br>
 Her franticke sonne, and kindles his courage,<br>
 Then when she is withdrawen, or strong withstood,<br>
 It's eath his idle furie to asswage,<br>
 And calme the tempest of his passion wood;<br>
 The bankes are ouerflowen, when stopped is the flood.</p><p>
  
 Therewith Sir <i>Guyon</i> left his first emprise,<br>
 And turning to that woman, fast her hent<br>
 By the hoare lockes, that hong before her eyes,<br>
 And to the ground her threw: yet n'ould she stent<br>
 Her bitter rayling and foule reuilement,<br>
 But still prouokt her sonne to wreake her wrong;<br>
 But nathelesse he did her still torment,<br>
 And catching hold of her vngratious tong,<br>
 Thereon an yron lock did fasten firme and strong.</p><p>
  
 Then when as vse of speach was from her reft,<br>
 With her two crooked handes she signes did make,<br>
 And beckned him, the last helpe she had left:<br>
 But he that last left helpe away did take,<br>
 And both her hands fast bound vnto a stake,<br>
 That she note stirre. Then gan her sonne to flie<br>
 Full fast away, and did her quite forsake;<br>
 But <i>Guyon</i> after him in haste did hie,<br>
 And soone him ouertooke in sad perplexitie.</p><p>
  
 In his strong armes he stiffely him embraste,<br>
 Who him gainstriuing, nought at all preuaild:<br>
 For all his power was vtterly defaste,<br>
 And furious fits at earst quite weren quaild:<br>
 Oft he re'nforst, and oft his forces fayld,<br>
 Yet yield he would not, nor his rancour slacke.<br>
 Then him to ground he cast, and rudely hayld,<br>
 And both his hands fast bound behind his backe,<br>
 And both his feet in fetters to an yron racke.</p><p>
  
 With hundred yron chaines he did him bind,<br>
 And hundred knots that did him sore constraine:<br>
 Yet his great yron teeth he still did grind,<br>
 And grimly gnash, threatning reuenge in vaine:<br>
 His burning eyen, whom bloudie strakes did staine,<br>
 Stared full wide, and threw forth sparkes of fire,<br>
 And more for ranck despight, then for great paine,<br>
 Shakt his long lockes, colourd like copper-wire,<br>
 And bit his tawny beard to shew his raging ire.</p><p>
  
 Thus when as <i>Guyon Furor</i> had captiu'd,<br>
 Turning about he saw that wretched Squire,<br>
 Whom that mad man of life nigh late depriu'd,<br>
 Lying on ground, all soild with bloud and mire:<br>
 Whom when as he perceiued to respire,<br>
 He gan to comfort, and his wounds to dresse.<br>
 Being at last recured, he gan inquire,<br>
 What hard mishap him brought to such distresse,<br>
 And made that caitiues thral, the thral of wretchednesse.</p><p>
  
 With hart then throbbing, and with watry eyes,<br>
 Faire Sir (quoth he) what man can shun the hap,<br>
 That hidden lyes vnwares him to surpryse?<br>
 Misfortune waites aduantage to entrap<br>
 The man most warie in her whelming lap.<br>
 So me weake wretch, of many weakest one,<br>
 Vnweeting, and vnware of such mishap,<br>
 She brought to mischiefe through occasion,<br>
 Where this same wicked villein did me light vpon.</p><p>
  
 It was a faithlesse Squire, that was the sourse<br>
 Of all my sorrow, and of these sad teares,<br>
 With whom from tender dug of commune nourse,<br>
 Attonce I was vpbrought, and eft when yeares<br>
 More rype vs reason lent to chose our Peares,<br>
 Our selues in league of vowed loue we knit:<br>
 In which we long time without gealous feares,<br>
 Or faultie thoughts continewd, as was fit;<br>
 And for my part I vow, dissembled not a whit.</p><p>
  
 It was my fortune commune to that age,<br>
 To loue a Ladie faire of great degree,<br>
 The which was borne of noble parentage,<br>
 And set in highest seat of dignitee,<br>
 Yet seemd no lesse to loue, then loued to bee:<br>
 Long I her seru'd, and found her faithfull still,<br>
 Ne euer thing could cause vs disagree:<br>
 Loue that two harts makes one, makes eke one will:<br>
 Each stroue to please, and others pleasure to fulfill.</p><p>
  
 My friend, hight <i>Philemon</i>, I did partake<br>
 Of all my loue and all my priuitie;<br>
 Who greatly ioyous seemed for my sake,<br>
 And gratious to that Ladie, as to mee,<br>
 Ne euer wight, that mote so welcome bee,<br>
 As he to her, withouten blot or blame,<br>
 Ne euer thing, that she could thinke or see,<br>
 But vnto him she would impart the same:<br>
 O wretched man, that would abuse so gentle Dame.</p><p>
  
 At last such grace I found, and meanes I wrought,<br>
 That I that Ladie to my spouse had wonne;<br>
 Accord of friends, consent of parents sought,<br>
 Affiance made, my happinesse begonne,<br>
 There wanted nought but few rites to be donne,<br>
 Which mariage make; that day too farre did seeme:<br>
 Most ioyous man, on whom the shining Sunne,<br>
 Did shew his face, my selfe I did esteeme,<br>
 And that my falser friend did no lesse ioyous deeme.</p><p>
  
 But ere that wished day his beame disclosd,<br>
 He either enuying my toward good,<br>
 Or of himselfe to treason ill disposd<br>
 One day vnto me came in friendly mood,<br>
 And told for secret how he vnderstood<br>
 That Ladie whom I had to me assynd,<br>
 Had both distaind her honorable blood,<br>
 And eke the faith, which she to me did bynd;<br>
 And therfore wisht me stay, till I more truth should fynd.</p><p>
  
 The gnawing anguish and sharpe gelosy,<br>
 Which his sad speech infixed in my brest,<br>
 Ranckled so sore, and festred inwardly,<br>
 That my engreeued mind could find no rest,<br>
 Till that the truth thereof I did outwrest,<br>
 And him besought by that same sacred band<br>
 Betwixt vs both, to counsell me the best.<br>
 He then with solemne oath and plighted hand<br>
 Assur'd, ere long the truth to let me vnderstand.</p><p>
  
 Ere long with like againe he boorded mee,<br>
 Saying, he now had boulted all the floure,<br>
 And that it was a groome of base degree,<br>
 Which of my loue was partner Paramoure:<br>
 Who vsed in a darksome inner bowre<br>
 Her oft to meet: which better to approue,<br>
 He promised to bring me at that howre,<br>
 When I should see, that would me nearer moue,<br>
 And driue me to withdraw my blind abused loue.</p><p>
  
 This gracelesse man for furtherance of his guile,<br>
 Did court the handmayd of my Lady deare,<br>
 Who glad t'embosome his affection vile,<br>
 Did all she might, more pleasing to appeare.<br>
 One day to worke her to his will more neare,<br>
 He woo'd her thus: <i>Pryene</i> (so she hight)<br>
 What great despight doth fortune to thee beare,<br>
 Thus lowly to abase thy beautie bright,<br>
 That it should not deface all others lesser light?</p><p>
  
 But if she had her least helpe to thee lent,<br>
 T'adorne thy forme according thy desart,<br>
 Their blazing pride thou wouldest soone haue blent,<br>
 And staynd their prayses with thy least good part;<br>
 Ne should faire <i>Claribell</i> with all her art,<br>
 Though she thy Lady be, approch thee neare;<br>
 For proofe thereof, this euening, as thou art,<br>
 Aray thy selfe in her most gorgeous geare,<br>
 That I may more delight in thy embracement deare.</p><p>
  
 The Maidẽ proud through prayse, and mad through loue<br>
 Him hearkned to, and soone her selfe arayd,<br>
 The whiles to me the treachour did remoue<br>
 His craftie engin, and as he had sayd,<br>
 Me leading, in a secret corner layd,<br>
 The sad spectatour of my Tragedie;<br>
 Where left, he went, and his owne false part playd,<br>
 Disguised like that groome of base degree,<br>
 Whom he had feignd th'abuser of my loue to bee.</p><p>
  
 Eftsoones he came vnto th'appointed place,<br>
 And with him brought <i>Priene</i>, rich arayd,<br>
 In <i>Claribellaes</i> clothes.  Her proper face<br>
 I not descerned in that darkesome shade,<br>
 But weend it was my loue, with whom he playd.<br>
 Ah God, what horrour and tormenting griefe<br>
 My hart, my hands, mine eyes, and all assayd?<br>
 Me liefer were ten thousand deathes priefe,<br>
 Then wound of gealous worme, and shame of such repriefe.</p><p>
  
 I home returning, fraught with fowle despight,<br>
 And chawing vengeance all the way I went,<br>
 Soone as my loathed loue appeard in sight,<br>
 With wrathfull hand I slew her innocent;<br>
 That after soone I dearely did lament:<br>
 For when the cause of that outrageous deede<br>
 Demaunded, I made plaine and euident,<br>
 Her faultie Handmayd, which that bale did breede,<br>
 Confest, how <i>Philemon</i> her wrought to chaunge her weede.</p><p>
  
 Which when I heard, with horrible affright<br>
 And hellish fury all enragd, I sought<br>
 Vpon my selfe that vengeable despight<br>
 To punish: yet it better first I thought,<br>
 To wreake my wrath on him, that first it wrought.<br>
 To <i>Philemon</i>, false faytour <i>Philemon</i><br>
 I cast to pay, that I so dearely bought;<br>
 Of deadly drugs I gaue him drinke anon,<br>
 And washt away his guilt with guiltie potion.</p><p>
  
 Thus heaping crime on crime, and griefe on griefe,<br>
 To losse of loue adioyning losse of frend,<br>
 I meant to purge both with a third mischiefe,<br>
 And in my woes beginner it to end:<br>
 That was <i>Pryene</i>; she did first offend,<br>
 She last should smart: with which cruell intent,<br>
 When I at her my murdrous blade did bend,<br>
 She fled away with ghastly dreriment,<br>
 And I pursewing my fell purpose, after went.</p><p>
  
 Feare gaue her wings, and rage enforst my flight;<br>
 Through woods and plaines so long I did her chace,<br>
 Till this mad man, whom your victorious might<br>
 Hath now fast bound, me met in middle space,<br>
 As I her, so he me pursewd apace,<br>
 And shortly ouertooke: I breathing yre,<br>
 Sore chauffed at my stay in such a cace,<br>
 And with my heat kindled his cruell fyre;<br>
 Which kindled once, his mother did more rage inspyre.</p><p>
  
 Betwixt them both, they haue me doen to dye,<br>
 Through wounds, &amp; strokes, &amp; stubborne handeling,<br>
 That death were better, then such agony,<br>
 As griefe and furie vnto me did bring;<br>
 Of which in me yet stickes the mortall sting,<br>
 That during life will neuer be appeasd.<br>
 When he thus ended had his sorrowing,<br>
 Said <i>Guyon</i>, Squire, sore haue ye beene diseasd;<br>
 But all your hurts may soone through tẽperance be easd.</p><p>
  
 Then gan the Palmer thus, most wretched man,<br>
 That to affections does the bridle lend;<br>
 In their beginning they are weake and wan,<br>
 But soone through suff'rance grow to fearefull end;<br>
 Whiles they are weake betimes with them contend:<br>
 For when they once to perfect strength do grow,<br>
 Strong warres they make, and cruell battry bend<br>
 Gainst fort of Reason, it to ouerthrow:<br>
 Wrath, gelosie, griefe, loue this Squire haue layd thus low.</p><p>
  
 Wrath, gealosie, griefe, loue do thus expell:<br>
 Wrath is a fire, and gealosie a weede,<br>
 Griefe is a flood, and loue a monster fell;<br>
 The fire of sparkes, the weede of little seede,<br>
 The flood of drops, the Monster filth did breede:<br>
 But sparks, seed, drops, and filth do thus delay;<br>
 The sparks soone quench, the springing seed outweed,<br>
 The drops dry vp, and filth wipe cleane away:<br>
 So shall wrath, gealosie, griefe, loue dye and decay.</p><p>
  
 Vnlucky Squire (said <i>Guyon</i>) sith thou hast<br>
 Falne into mischiefe through intemperaunce,<br>
 Henceforth take heede of that thou now hast past,<br>
 And guide thy wayes with warie gouernaunce,<br>
 Least worse betide thee by some later chaunce.<br>
 But read how art thou nam'd, and of what kin.<br>
 <i>Phedon</i> I hight (quoth he) and do aduaunce<br>
 Mine auncestry from famous <i>Coradin</i>,<br>
 Who first to rayse our house to honour did begin.</p><p>
  
 Thus as he spake, lo far away they spyde<br>
 A varlet running towards hastily,<br>
 Whose flying feet so fast their way applyde,<br>
 That round about a cloud of dust did fly,<br>
 Which mingled all with sweate, did dim his eye.<br>
 He soone approched, panting, breathlesse, whot,<br>
 And all so soyld, that none could him descry;<br>
 His countenaunce was bold, and bashed not<br>
 For <i>Guyons</i> lookes, but scornefull eyglaunce at him shot.</p><p>
  
 Behind his backe he bore a brasen shield,<br>
 On which was drawen faire, in colours fit,<br>
 A flaming fire in midst of bloudy field,<br>
 And round about the wreath this word was writ,<br>
 <i>Burnt I do burne.</i>  Right well beseemed it,<br>
 To be the shield of some redoubted knight;<br>
 And in his hand two darts exceeding flit,<br>
 And deadly sharpe he held, whose heads were dight<br>
 In poyson and in bloud, of malice and despight.</p><p>
  
 When he in presence came, to <i>Guyon</i> first<br>
 He boldly spake, Sir knight, if knight thou bee,<br>
 Abandon this forestalled place at erst,<br>
 For feare of further harme, I counsell thee,<br>
 Or bide the chaunce at thine owne ieoperdie.<br>
 The knight at his great boldnesse wondered,<br>
 And though he scornd his idle vanitie,<br>
 Yet mildly him to purpose answered;<br>
 For not to grow of nought he it coniectured.</p><p>
  
 Varlet, this place most dew to me I deeme,<br>
 Yielded by him, that held it forcibly.<br>
 But whence should come that harme, which thou doest seeme<br>
 To threat to him, that minds his chaunce t'abye?<br>
 Perdy (said he) here comes, and is hard by<br>
 A knight of wondrous powre, and great assay,<br>
 That neuer yet encountred enemy,<br>
 But did him deadly daunt, or fowle dismay;<br>
 Ne thou for better hope, if thou his presence stay.</p><p>
  
 How hight he then (said <i>Guyon</i>) and from whence?<br>
 <i>Pyrrhochles</i> is his name, renowmed farre<br>
 For his bold feats and hardy confidence,<br>
 Full oft approu'd in many a cruell warre,<br>
 The brother of <i>Cymochles</i>, both which arre<br>
 The sonnes of old <i>Acrates</i> and <i>Despight</i>,<br>
 <i>Acrates</i> sonne of <i>Phlegeton</i> and <i>Iarre</i>;<br>
 But <i>Phlegeton</i> is sonne of <i>Herebus</i> and <i>Night</i>;<br>
 But <i>Herebus</i> sonne of <i>Aeternitie</i> is hight.</p><p>
  
 So from immortall race he does proceede,<br>
 That mortall hands may not withstand his might,<br>
 Drad for his derring do, and bloudy deed;<br>
 For all in bloud and spoile is his delight.<br>
 His am I <i>Atin</i>, his in wrong and right,<br>
 That matter make for him to worke vpon,<br>
 And stirre him vp to strife and cruell fight.<br>
 Fly therefore, fly this fearefull stead anon,<br>
 Least thy foolhardize worke thy sad confusion.</p><p>
  
 His be that care, whom most it doth concerne,<br>
 (Said he) but whither with such hasty flight<br>
 Art thou now bound? for well mote I discerne<br>
 Great cause, that carries thee so swift and light.<br>
 My Lord (quoth he) me sent, and streight behight<br>
 To seeke <i>Occasion</i>, where so she bee:<br>
 For he is all disposd to bloudy fight,<br>
 And breathes out wrath and hainous crueltie;<br>
 Hard is his hap, that first fals in his ieopardie.</p><p>
  
 Madman (said then the Palmer) that does seeke<br>
 <i>Occasion</i> to wrath, and cause of strife;<br>
 She comes vnsought, and shonned followes eke.<br>
 Happy, who can abstaine, when Rancour rife<br>
 Kindles Reuenge, and threats his rusty knife;<br>
 Woe neuer wants, where euery cause is caught,<br>
 And rash <i>Occasion</i> makes vnquiet life.<br>
 Then loe, where bound she sits, whõ thou hast sought,<br>
 (Said <i>Guyon</i>,) let that message to thy Lord be brought.</p><p>
  
 That when the varlet heard and saw, streight way<br>
 He wexed wondrous wroth, and said, Vile knight,<br>
 That knights &amp; knighthood doest with shame vpbray,<br>
 And shewst th'ensãple of thy childish might,<br>
 With silly weake old woman thus to fight.<br>
 Great glory and gay spoile sure hast thou got,<br>
 And stoutly prou'd thy puissaunce here in sight;<br>
 That shall <i>Pyrrochles</i> well requite, I wot,<br>
 And with thy bloud abolish so reprochfull blot.</p><p>
  
 With that one of his thrillant darts he threw,<br>
 Headed with ire and vengeable despight;<br>
 The quiuering steele his aymed end well knew,<br>
 And to his brest it selfe intended right:<br>
 But he was warie, and ere it empight<br>
 In the meant marke, aduaunst his shield atweene,<br>
 On which it seizing, no way enter might,<br>
 But backe rebounding, left the forckhead keene;<br>
 Eftsoones he fled away, and might no where be seene.</p><p>
