 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Both Scudamour and Arthegall<br>
 Doe fight with Britomart:<br>
 He sees her face; doth fall in loue,<br>
 and soone from her depart.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 VV
 Hat equall torment to the griefe of mind,<br>
 And pyning anguish hid in gentle hart,<br>
 That inly feeds it selfe with thoughts vnkind,<br>
 And nourisheth her owne consuming smart?<br>
 What medicine can any Leaches art<br>
 Yeeld such a sore, that doth her grieuance hide,<br>
 And will to none her maladie impart?<br>
 Such was the wound that <i>Scudamour</i> did gride;<br>
 For which <i>Dan Phebus</i> selfe cannot a salue prouide.<p> 
 
 Who hauing left that restlesse house of <i>Care</i>,<br>
 The next day, as he on his way did ride,<br>
 Full of melancholie and sad misfare,<br>
 Through misconceipt; all vnawares espide<br>
 An armed Knight vnder a forrest side,<br>
 Sitting in shade beside his grazing steede;<br>
 Who soone as them approaching he descride,<br>
 Gan towards them to pricke with eger speede,<br>
 That seem'd he was full bent to some mischieuous deede.</p><p>
 
 Which <i>Scudamour</i> perceiuing, forth issewed<br>
 To haue rencountred him in equall race;<br>
 But soone as th'other nigh approaching, vewed<br>
 The armes he bore, his speare he gan abase,<br>
 And voide his course: at which so suddain case<br>
 He wondred much. But th'other thus can say;<br>
 Ah gentle <i>Scudamour</i>, vnto your grace<br>
 I me submit, and you of pardon pray,<br>
 That almost had against you trespassed this day.</p><p>
 
 Whereto thus <i>Scudamour</i>, Small harme it were<br>
 For any knight, vpon a ventrous knight<br>
 Without displeasance for to proue his spere.<br>
 But reade you Sir, sith ye my name haue hight,<br>
 What is your owne, that I mote you requite?<br>
 Certes (sayd he) ye mote as now excuse<br>
 Me from discouering you my name aright:<br>
 For time yet serues that I the same refuse,<br>
 But call ye me the <i>Saluage Knight</i>, as others vse.</p><p>
 
 Then this, Sir <i>Saluage Knight</i> (quoth he) areede;<br>
 Or doe you here within this forrest wonne,<br>
 That seemeth well to answere to your weede?<br>
 Or haue ye it for some occasion donne?<br>
 That rather seemes, sith knowen armes ye shonne.<br>
 This other day (sayd he) a stranger knight<br>
 Shame and dishonour hath vnto me donne;<br>
 On whom I waite to wreake that foule despight,<br>
 When euer he this way shall passe by day or night.</p><p>
 
 Shame be his meede (quoth he) that meaneth shame.<br>
 But what is he, by whom ye shamed were?<br>
 A stranger knight, sayd he, vnknowne by name,<br>
 But knowne by fame, and by an Hebene speare,<br>
 With which he all that met him, downe did beare.<br>
 He in an open Turney lately held,<br>
 Fro me the honour of that game did reare;<br>
 And hauing me all wearie earst, downe feld,<br>
 The fayrest Ladie reft, and euer since withheld.</p><p>
 
 When <i>Scudamour</i> heard mention of that speare,<br>
 He wist right well, that it was <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
 The which from him his fairest loue did beare.<br>
 Tho gan he swell in euery inner part,<br>
 For fell despight, and gnaw his gealous hart,<br>
 That thus he sharply sayd; Now by my head,<br>
 Yet is not this the first vnknightly part,<br>
 Which that same knight, whom by his launce I read,<br>
 Hath doen to noble knights, that many makes him dread.</p><p>
 
 For lately he my loue hath fro me reft,<br>
 And eke defiled with foule villanie<br>
 The sacred pledge, which in his faith was left,<br>
 In shame of knighthood and fidelitie;<br>
 The which ere long full deare he shall abie.<br>
 And if to that auenge by you decreed<br>
 This hand may helpe, or succour ought supplie,<br>
 It shall not fayle, when so ye shall it need.<br>
 So both to wreake their wrathes on <i>Britomart</i> agreed.</p><p>
 
 Whiles thus they communed, lo farre away<br>
 A Knight soft ryding towards them they spyde,<br>
 Attyr'd in forraine armes and straunge aray:<br>
 Whõ when they nigh approcht, they plaine descryde<br>
 To be the same, for whom they did abyde.<br>
 Sayd then Sir <i>Scudamour</i>, Sir <i>Saluage</i> knight<br>
 Let me this craue, sith first I was defyde,<br>
 That first I may that wrong to him requite:<br>
 And if I hap to fayle, you shall recure my right.</p><p>
 
 Which being yeelded, he his threatfull speare<br>
 Gan fewter, and against her fiercely ran.<br>
 Who soone as she him saw approaching neare<br>
 With so fell rage, her selfe she lightly gan<br>
 To dight, to welcome him, well as she can:<br>
 But entertaind him in so rude a wise,<br>
 That to the ground she smote both horse and man;<br>
 Whence neither greatly hasted to arise,<br>
 But on their common harmes together did deuise.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Artegall</i> beholding his mischaunce,<br>
 New matter added to his former fire;<br>
 And eft auentring his steeleheaded launce,<br>
 Against her rode, full of despiteous ire,<br>
 That nought but spoyle and vengeance did require.<br>
 But to himselfe his felonous intent<br>
 Returning, disappointed his desire,<br>
 Whiles vnawares his saddle he forwent,<br>
 And found himselfe on ground in great amazement.</p><p>
 
 Lightly he started vp out of that stound,<br>
 And snatching forth his direfull deadly blade,<br>
 Did leape to her, as doth an eger hound<br>
 Thrust to an Hynd within some couert glade,<br>
 Whom without perill he cannot inuade.<br>
 With such fell greedines he her assayled,<br>
 That though she mounted were, yet he her made<br>
 To giue him ground, (so much his force preuayled)<br>
 And shun his mightie strokes, gainst which no armes auayled.</p><p>
 
 So as they coursed here and there, it chaunst<br>
 That in her wheeling round, behind her crest<br>
 So sorely he her strooke, that thence it glaunst<br>
 Adowne her backe, the which it fairely blest<br>
 From foule mischance; ne did it euer rest,<br>
 Till on her horses hinder parts it fell;<br>
 Where byting deepe, so deadly it imprest,<br>
 That quite it chynd his backe behind the sell,<br>
 And to alight on foote her algates did compell.</p><p>
 
 Like as the lightning brond from riuen skie,<br>
 Throwne out by angry <i>Ioue</i> in his vengeance,<br>
 With dreadfull force falles on some steeple hie;<br>
 Which battring, downe it on the church doth glance,<br>
 And teares it all with terrible mischance.<br>
 Yet she no whit dismayd, her steed forsooke,<br>
 And casting from her that enchaunted lance,<br>
 Vnto her sword and shield her soone betooke;<br>
 And therewithall at him right furiously she strooke.</p><p>
 
 So furiously she strooke in her first heat,<br>
 Whiles with long fight on foot he breathlesse was,<br>
 That she him forced backward to retreat,<br>
 And yeeld vnto her weapon way to pas:<br>
 Whose raging rigour neither steele nor bras<br>
 Could stay, but to the tender flesh it went,<br>
 And pour'd the purple bloud forth on the gras;<br>
 That all his mayle yriv'd, and plates yrent,<br>
 Shew'd all his bodie bare vnto the cruell dent.</p><p>
 
 At length when as he saw her hastie heat<br>
 Abate, and panting breath begin to fayle,<br>
 He through long sufferance growing now more great,<br>
 Rose in his strength, and gan her fresh assayle,<br>
 Heaping huge strokes, as thicke as showre of hayle,<br>
 And lashing dreadfully at euery part,<br>
 As if he thought her soule to disentrayle.<br>
 Ah cruell hand, and thrise more cruell hart,<br>
 That workst such wrecke on her, to whom thou dearest art.</p><p>
 
 What yron courage euer could endure,<br>
 To worke such outrage on so faire a creature?<br>
 And in his madnesse thinke with hands impure<br>
 To spoyle so goodly workmanship of nature,<br>
 The maker selfe resembling in her feature?<br>
 Certes some hellish furie, or some feend<br>
 This mischiefe framd, for their first loues defeature,<br>
 To bath their hands in bloud of dearest freend,<br>
 Thereby to make their loues beginning, their liues end.</p><p>
 
 Thus long they trac'd, and trauerst to and fro,<br>
 Sometimes pursewing, and sometimes pursewed,<br>
 Still as aduantage they espyde thereto:<br>
 But toward th'end Sir <i>Arthegall</i> renewed<br>
 His strength still more, but she still more decrewed.<br>
 At last his lucklesse hand he heau'd on hie,<br>
 Hauing his forces all in one accrewed,<br>
 And therewith stroke at her so hideouslie,<br>
 That seemed nought but death mote be her destinie.</p><p>
 
 The wicked stroke vpon her helmet chaunst,<br>
 And with the force, which in it selfe it bore,<br>
 Her ventayle shard away, and thence forth glaunst<br>
 A downe in vaine, ne harm'd her any more.<br>
 With that her angels face, vnseene afore,<br>
 Like to the ruddie morne appeard in sight,<br>
 Deawed with siluer drops, through sweating sore;<br>
 But somewhat redder, then beseem'd aright,<br>
 Through toylesome heate and labour of her weary fight.</p><p>
 
 And round about the same, her yellow heare<br>
 Hauing through stirring loosd their wonted band,<br>
 Like to a golden border did appeare,<br>
 Framed in goldsmithes forge with cunning hand:<br>
 Yet goldsmithes cunning could not vnderstand<br>
 To frame such subtile wire, so shinie cleare.<br>
 For it did glister like the golden sand,<br>
 The which <i>Pactolus</i> with his waters shere,<br>
 Throwes forth vpon the riuage round about him nere.</p><p>
 
 And as his hand he vp againe did reare,<br>
 Thinking to worke on her his vtmost wracke,<br>
 His powrelesse arme benumbd with secret feare<br>
 From his reuengefull purpose shronke abacke,<br>
 And cruell sword out of his fingers slacke<br>
 Fell downe to ground, as if the steele had sence,<br>
 And felt some ruth, or sence his hand did lacke,<br>
 Or both of them did thinke, obedience<br>
 To doe to so diuine a beauties excellence.</p><p>
 
 And he himselfe long gazing thereupon,<br>
 At last fell humbly downe vpon his knee,<br>
 And of his wonder made religion,<br>
 Weening some heauenly goddesse he did see,<br>
 Or else vnweeting, what it else might bee;<br>
 And pardon her besought his errour frayle,<br>
 That had done outrage in so high degree:<br>
 Whilest trembling horrour did his sense assayle,<br>
 And made ech member quake, and manly hart to quayle.</p><p>
 
 Nathelesse she full of wrath for that late stroke,<br>
 All that long while vpheld her wrathfull hand,<br>
 With fell intent, on him to bene ywroke,<br>
 And looking sterne, still ouer him did stand,<br>
 Threatning to strike, vnlesse he would withstand:<br>
 And bad him rise, or surely he should die.<br>
 But die or liue for nought he would vpstand<br>
 But her of pardon prayd more earnestlie,<br>
 Or wreake on him her will for so great iniurie.</p><p>
 
 Which when as <i>Scudamour</i>, who now abrayd,<br>
 Beheld, whereas he stood not farre aside,<br>
 He was therewith right wondrously dismayd,<br>
 And drawing nigh, when as he plaine descride<br>
 That peerelesse paterne of Dame natures pride,<br>
 And heauenly image of perfection,<br>
 He blest himselfe, as one sore terrifide,<br>
 And turning his feare to faint deuotion,<br>
 Did worship her as some celestiall vision.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Glauce</i>, seeing all that chaunced there,<br>
 Well weeting how their errour to assoyle,<br>
 Full glad of so good end, to them drew nere,<br>
 And her salewd with seemely belaccoyle,<br>
 Ioyous to see her safe after long toyle.<br>
 Then her besought, as she to her was deare,<br>
 To graunt vnto those warriours truce a whyle;<br>
 Which yeelded, they their beuers vp did reare,<br>
 And shew'd themselues to her, such as indeed they were.</p><p>
 
 When <i>Britomart</i> with sharpe auizefull eye<br>
 Beheld the louely face of <i>Artegall</i>,<br>
 Tempred with sternesse and stout maiestie,<br>
 She gan eftsoones it to her mind to call,<br>
 To be the same which in her fathers hall<br>
 Long since in that enchaunted glasse she saw.<br>
 Therewith her wrathfull courage gan appall,<br>
 And haughtie spirits meekely to adaw,<br>
 That her enhaunced hand she downe can soft withdraw.</p><p>
 
 Yet she it forst to haue againe vpheld,<br>
 As fayning choler, which was turn'd to cold:<br>
 But euer when his visage she beheld,<br>
 Her hand fell downe, and would no longer hold<br>
 The wrathfull weapon gainst his countnance bold:<br>
 But when in vaine to fight she oft assayd,<br>
 She arm'd her tongue, and thought at him to scold;<br>
 Nathlesse her tongue not to her will obayd,<br>
 But brought forth speeches myld, when she would haue missayd.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Scudamour</i> now woxen inly glad,<br>
 That all his gealous feare he false had found,<br>
 And how that Hag his loue abused had<br>
 With breach of faith and loyaltie vnsound,<br>
 The which long time his grieued hart did wound,<br>
 He thus bespake; Certes Sir <i>Artegall</i>,<br>
 I ioy to see you lout so low on ground,<br>
 And now become to liue a Ladies thrall,<br>
 That whylome in your minde wont to despise them all.</p><p>
 
 Soone as she heard the name of <i>Artegall</i>,<br>
 Her hart did leape, and all her hart-strings tremble,<br>
 For sudden ioy, and secret feare withall,<br>
 And all her vitall powres with motion nimble,<br>
 To succour it, themselues gan there assemble,<br>
 That by the swift recourse of flushing blood<br>
 Right plaine appeard, though she it would dissemble,<br>
 And fayned still her former angry mood,<br>
 Thinking to hide the depth by troubling of the flood.</p><p>
 
 When <i>Glauce</i> thus gan wisely all vpknit;<br>
 Ye gentle Knights, whom fortune here hath brought,<br>
 To be spectators of this vncouth fit,<br>
 Which secret fate hath in this Ladie wrought,<br>
 Against the course of kind, ne meruaile nought,<br>
 Ne thenceforth feare the thing that hethertoo<br>
 Hath troubled both your mindes with idle thought,<br>
 Fearing least she your loues away should woo,<br>
 Feared in vaine, sith meanes ye see there wants theretoo.</p><p>
 
 And you Sir <i>Artegall</i>, the saluage knight,<br>
 Henceforth may not disdaine, that womans hand<br>
 Hath conquered you anew in second fight:<br>
 For whylome they haue conquerd sea and land,<br>
 And heauen it selfe, that nought may them withstand,<br>
 Ne henceforth be rebellious vnto loue,<br>
 That is the crowne of knighthood, and the band<br>
 Of noble minds deriued from aboue,<br>
 Which being knit with vertue, neuer will remoue.</p><p>
 
 And you faire Ladie knight, my dearest Dame,<br>
 Relent the rigour of your wrathfull will,<br>
 Whose fire were better turn'd to other flame;<br>
 And wiping out remembrance of all ill,<br>
 Graunt him your grace, but so that he fulfill<br>
 The penance, which ye shall to him empart:<br>
 For louers heauen must passe by sorrowes hell.<br>
 Thereat full inly blushed <i>Britomart</i>;<br>
 But <i>Artegall</i> close smyling ioy'd in secret hart.</p><p>
 
 Yet durst he not make loue so suddenly,<br>
 Ne thinke th'affection of her hart to draw<br>
 From one to other so quite contrary:<br>
 Besides her modest countenance he saw<br>
 So goodly graue, and full of princely aw,<br>
 That it his ranging fancie did refraine,<br>
 And looser thoughts to lawfull bounds withdraw;<br>
 Whereby the passion grew more fierce and faine,<br>
 Like to a stubborne steede whom strong hand would restraine.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Scudamour</i> whose hart twixt doubtfull feare<br>
 And feeble hope hung all this while suspence,<br>
 Desiring of his <i>Amoret</i> to heare<br>
 Some gladfull newes and sure intelligence,<br>
 Her thus bespake; But Sir without offence<br>
 Mote I request you tydings of my loue,<br>
 My <i>Amoret</i>, sith you her freed fro thence,<br>
 Where she captiued long, great woes did proue;<br>
 That where ye left, I may her seeke, as doth behoue.</p><p>
 
 To whom thus <i>Britomart</i>, Certes Sir knight,<br>
 What is of her become, or whether reft,<br>
 I can not vnto you aread a right.<br>
 For from that time I from enchaunters theft<br>
 Her freed, in which ye her all hopelesse left,<br>
 I her preseru'd from perill and from feare,<br>
 And euermore from villenie her kept:<br>
 Ne euer was there wight to me more deare<br>
 Then she, ne vnto whom I more true loue did beare.</p><p>
 
 Till on a day as through a desert wyld<br>
 We trauelled, both wearie of the way<br>
 We did alight, and sate in shadow myld;<br>
 Where fearelesse I to sleepe me downe did lay.<br>
 But when as I did out of sleepe abray,<br>
 I found her not, where I her left whyleare,<br>
 But thought she wandred was, or gone astray.<br>
 I cal'd her loud, I sought her farre and neare;<br>
 But no where could her find, nor tydings of her heare.</p><p>
 
 When <i>Scudamour</i> those heauie tydings heard,<br>
 His hart was thrild with point of deadly feare;<br>
 Ne in his face or bloud or life appeard,<br>
 But senselesse stood, like to a mazed steare,<br>
 That yet of mortall stroke the stound doth beare.<br>
 Till <i>Glauce</i> thus; Faire Sir, be nought dismayd<br>
 With needelesse dread, till certaintie ye heare:<br>
 For yet she may be safe though somewhat strayd;<br>
 Its best to hope the best, though of the worst affrayd.</p><p>
 
 Nathlesse he hardly of her chearefull speech<br>
 Did comfort take, or in his troubled sight<br>
 Shew'd change of better cheare: so sore a breach<br>
 That sudden newes had made into his spright;<br>
 Till <i>Britomart</i> him fairely thus behight;<br>
 Great cause of sorrow certes Sir ye haue:<br>
 But comfort take: for by this heauens light<br>
 I vow, you dead or liuing not to leaue,<br>
 Till I her find, and wreake on him that her did reaue.</p><p>
 
 Therewith he rested, and well pleased was.<br>
 So peace being confirm'd amongst them all,<br>
 They tooke their steeds, and forward thence did pas<br>
 Vnto some resting place, which mote befall,<br>
 All being guided by Sir <i>Artegall</i>.<br>
 Where goodly solace was vnto them made,<br>
 And dayly feasting both in bowre and hall,<br>
 Vntill that they their wounds well healed had,<br>
 And wearie limmes recur'd after late vsage bad.</p><p>
 
 In all which time, Sir <i>Artegall</i> made way<br>
 Vnto the loue of noble <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
 And with meeke seruice and much suit did lay<br>
 Continuall siege vnto her gentle hart;<br>
 Which being whylome launcht with louely dart,<br>
 More eath was new impression to receiue,<br>
 How euer she her paynd with womanish art<br>
 To hide her wound, that none might it perceiue:<br>
 Vaine is the art that seekes it selfe for to deceiue.</p><p>
 
 So well he woo'd her, and so well he wrought her,<br>
 With faire entreatie and sweet blandishment,<br>
 That at the length vnto a bay he brought her,<br>
 So as she to his speeches was content<br>
 To lend an eare, and softly to relent.<br>
 At last through many vowes which forth he pour'd,<br>
 And many othes, she yeelded her consent<br>
 To be his loue, and take him for her Lord,<br>
 Till they with mariage meet might finish that accord.</p><p>
 
 Tho when they had long time there taken rest,<br>
 Sir <i>Artegall</i>, who all this while was bound<br>
 Vpon an hard aduenture yet in quest,<br>
 Fit time for him thence to depart it found,<br>
 To follow that, which he did long propound;<br>
 And vnto her his congee came to take.<br>
 But her therewith full sore displeasd he found,<br>
 And loth to leaue her late betrothed make,<br>
 Her dearest loue full loth so shortly to forsake.</p><p>
 
 Yet he with strong perswasions her asswaged,<br>
 And wonne her will to suffer him depart;<br>
 For which his faith with her he fast engaged,<br>
 And thousand vowes from bottome of his hart<br>
 That all so soone as he by wit or art<br>
 Could that atchieue, whereto he did aspire,<br>
 He vnto her would speedily reuert:<br>
 No longer space thereto he did desire,<br>
 But till the horned moone three courses did expire.</p><p>
 
 With which she for the present was appeased,<br>
 And yeelded leaue, how euer malcontent<br>
 She inly were, and in her mind displeased.<br>
 So early in the morrow next he went<br>
 Forth on his way, to which he was ybent.<br>
 Ne wight him to attend, or way to guide,<br>
 As whylome was the custome ancient<br>
 Mongst Knights, when on aduentures they did ride,<br>
 Saue that she algates him a while accompanide.</p><p>
 
 And by the way she sundry purpose found<br>
 Of this or that, the time for to delay,<br>
 And of the perils whereto he was bound,<br>
 The feare whereof seem'd much her to affray:<br>
 But all she did was but to weare out day.<br>
 Full oftentimes she leaue of him did take;<br>
 And eft againe deuiz'd some what to say,<br>
 Which she forgot, whereby excuse to make:<br>
 So loth she was his companie for to forsake.</p><p>
 
 At last when all her speeches she had spent,<br>
 And new occasion fayld her more to find,<br>
 She left him to his fortunes gouernment,<br>
 And backe returned with right heauie mind,<br>
 To <i>Scudamour</i>, who she had left behind:<br>
 With whom she went to seeke faire <i>Amoret</i>,<br>
 Her second care, though in another kind;<br>
 For vertues onely sake, which doth beget<br>
 True loue and faithfull friendship, she by her did set.</p><p>
 
 Backe to that desert forrest they retyred,<br>
 Where sorie <i>Britomart</i> had lost her late;<br>
 There they her sought, and euery where inquired,<br>
 Where they might tydings get of her estate;<br>
 Yet found they none.  But by what haplesse fate,<br>
 Or hard misfortune she was thence conuayd,<br>
 And stolne away from her beloued mate,<br>
 Were long to tell; therefore I here will stay<br>
 Vntill another tyde, that I it finish may.</p><p>
