 </p><blockquote> 
 <i>Calidore sees the Graces daunce,<br>
 To Colins melody:<br>
 The whiles his Pastorell is led,<br>
 [I]nto captiuity.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 W
 Ho now does follow the foule <i>Blatant Beast</i>,<br>
 Whilest <i>Calidore</i> does follow that faire Mayd,<br>
 Vnmyndfull of his vow and high beheast,<br>
 Which by the Faery Queene was on him layd,<br>
 That he should neuer leaue, nor be delayd<br>
 From chacing him, till he had it attchieued?<br>
 But now entrapt of loue, which him betrayd,<br>
 He mindeth more, how he may be relieued<br>
 With grace from her, whose loue his heart hath sore engrieued.<p>
 
 That from henceforth he meanes no more to sew<br>
 His former quest, so full of toile and paine;<br>
 Another quest, another game in vew<br>
 He hath, the guerdon of his loue to gaine:<br>
 With whom he myndes for euer to remaine,<br>
 And set his rest amongst the rusticke sort,<br>
 Rather then hunt still after shadowes vaine<br>
 Of courtly fauour, fed with light report,<br>
 Of euery blaste, and sayling alwaies on the port.</p><p>
 
 Ne certes mote he greatly blamed be,<br>
 From so high step to stoupe vnto so low.<br>
 For who had tasted once (as oft did he)<br>
 The happy peace, which there doth ouerflow,<br>
 And prou'd the perfect pleasures, which doe grow<br>
 Amongst poore hyndes, in hils, in woods, in dales,<br>
 Would neuer more delight in painted show<br>
 Of such false blisse, as there is set for stales,<br>
 T'entrap vnwary fooles in their eternall bales.</p><p>
 
 For what hath all that goodly glorious gaze<br>
 Like to one sight, which <i>Calidore</i> did vew?<br>
 The glaunce whereof their dimmed eies would daze,<br>
 That neuer more they should endure the shew<br>
 Of that sunne-shine, that makes them looke askew.<br>
 Ne ought in all that world of beauties rare,<br>
 (Saue onely <i>Glorianaes</i> heauenly hew<br>
 To which what can compare?) can it compare;<br>
 The which as commeth now, by course I will declare.</p><p>
 
 One day as he did raunge the fields abroad,<br>
 Whilest his faire <i>Pastorella</i> was elsewhere,<br>
 He chaunst to come, far from all peoples troad,<br>
 Vnto a place, whose pleasaunce did appere<br>
 To passe all others, on the earth which were:<br>
 For all that euer was by natures skill<br>
 Deuized to worke delight, was gathered there,<br>
 And there by her were poured forth at fill,<br>
 As if this to adorne, she all the rest did pill.</p><p>
 
 It was an hill plaste in an open plaine,<br>
 That round about was bordered with a wood<br>
 Of matchlesse hight, that seem'd th'earth to disdaine;<br>
 In which all trees of honour stately stood,<br>
 And did all winter as in sommer bud,<br>
 Spredding pauilions for the birds to bowre,<br>
 Which in their lower braunches sung aloud;<br>
 And in their tops the soring hauke did towre,<br>
 Sitting like King of fowles in maiesty and powre.</p><p>
 
 And at the foote thereof, a gentle flud<br>
 His siluer waues did softly tumble downe,<br>
 Vnmard with ragged mosse or filthy mud;<br>
 Ne mote wylde beastes, ne mote the ruder clowne<br>
 Thereto approch, ne filth mote therein drowne:<br>
 But Nymphes and Faeries by the bancks did sit,<br>
 In the woods shade, which did the waters crowne,<br>
 Keeping all noysome things away from it,<br>
 And to the waters fall tuning their accents fit.</p><p>
 
 And on the top thereof a spacious plaine<br>
 Did spred it selfe, to serue to all delight,<br>
 Either to daunce, when they to daunce would faine,<br>
 Or else to course about their bases light;<br>
 Ne ought there wanted, which for pleasure might<br>
 Desired be, or thence to banish bale:<br>
 So pleasauntly the hill with equall hight,<br>
 Did seeme to ouerlooke the lowly vale;<br>
 Therefore it rightly cleeped was mount <i>Acidale</i>.</p><p>
 
 They say that <i>Venus</i>, when she did dispose<br>
 Her selfe to pleasaunce, vsed to resort<br>
 Vnto this place, and therein to repose<br>
 And rest her selfe, as in a gladsome port,<br>
 Or with the Graces there to play and sport;<br>
 That euen her owne Cytheron, though in it<br>
 She vsed most to keepe her royall court,<br>
 And in her soueraine Maiesty to sit,<br>
 She in regard hereof refusde and thought vnfit.</p><p>
 
 Vnto this place when as the Elfin Knight<br>
 Approcht, him seemed that the merry sound<br>
 Of a shrill pipe he playing heard on hight,<br>
 And many feete fast thumping th'hollow ground,<br>
 That through the woods their Eccho did rebound.<br>
 He nigher drew, to weete what mote it be;<br>
 There he a troupe of Ladies dauncing found<br>
 Full merrily, and making gladfull glee,<br>
 And in the midst a Shepheard piping he did see.</p><p>
 
 He durst not enter into th'open greene,<br>
 For dread of them vnwares to be descryde,<br>
 For breaking of their daunce, if he were seene;<br>
 But in the couert of the wood did byde,<br>
 Beholding all, yet of them vnespyde.<br>
 There he did see, that pleased much his sight,<br>
 That euen he him selfe his eyes enuyde,<br>
 An hundred naked maidens lilly white,<br>
 All raunged in a ring, and dauncing in delight.</p><p>
 
 All they without were raunged in a ring,<br>
 And daunced round ; but in the midst of them<br>
 Three other Ladies did both daunce and sing,<br>
 The whilest the rest them round about did hemme,<br>
 And like a girlond did in compasse stemme:<br>
 And in the middest of those same three, was placed<br>
 Another Damzell, as a precious gemme,<br>
 Amidst a ring most richly well enchaced,<br>
 That with her goodly presence all the rest much graced.</p><p>
 
 Looke how the Crowne, which <i>Ariadne</i> wore<br>
 Vpon her yuory forehead that same day<br>
 That <i>Theseus</i> her vnto his bridale bore,<br>
 When the bold <i>Centaures</i> made that bloudy fray<br>
 With the fierce <i>Lapithes</i>, which did them dismay;<br>
 Being now placed in the firmament,<br>
 Through the bright heauen doth her beams display,<br>
 And is vnto the starres an ornament,<br>
 Which round about her moue in order excellent.</p><p>
 
 Such was the beauty of this goodly band,<br>
 Whose sundry parts were here too long to tell:<br>
 But she that in the midst of them did stand,<br>
 Seem'd all the rest in beauty to excell,<br>
 Crownd with a rosie girlond, that right well<br>
 Did her beseeme. And euer, as the crew<br>
 About her daunst, sweet flowres, that far did smell,<br>
 And fragrant odours they vppon her threw;<br>
 But most of all, those three did her with gifts endew.</p><p>
 
 Those were the Graces, daughters of delight,<br>
 Handmaides of <i>Venus</i>, which are wont to haunt<br>
 Vppon this hill, and daunce there day and night:<br>
 Those three to men all gifts of grace do graunt,<br>
 And all, that <i>Venus</i> in her selfe doth vaunt,<br>
 Is borrowed of them.  But that faire one,<br>
 That in the midst was placed parauaunt,<br>
 Was she to whom that shepheard pypt alone,<br>
 That made him pipe so merrily, as neuer none.</p><p>
 
 She was to weete that iolly Shepheards lasse,<br>
 Which piped there vnto that merry rout:<br>
 That iolly shepheard, which there piped, was<br>
 Poore <i>Colin Clout</i> (who knowes not <i>Colin Clout</i>?)<br>
 He pypt apace, whilest they him daunst about.<br>
 Pype iolly shepheard, pype thou now apace<br>
 Vnto thy loue, that made thee low to lout;<br>
 Thy Loue is present there with thee in place,<br>
 Thy Loue is there aduaunst to be another Grace.</p><p>
 
 Much wondred <i>Calidore</i> at this straunge sight,<br>
 Whose like before his eye had neuer seene,<br>
 And standing long astonished in spright,<br>
 And rapt with pleasaunce, wist not what to weene;<br>
 Whether it were the traine of beauties Queene,<br>
 Or Nymphes, or Faeries, or enchaunted show,<br>
 With which his eyes mote haue deluded beene.<br>
 Therefore resoluing, what it was, to know,<br>
 Out of the wood he rose, and toward them did go.</p><p>
 
 But soone as he appeared to their vew,<br>
 The vanisht all away out of his sight,<br>
 And cleane were gone, which way he neuer knew;<br>
 All saue the shepheard, who for fell despight<br>
 Of that displeasure, broke his bag-pipe quight,<br>
 And made great mone for that vnhappy turne.<br>
 But <i>Calidore</i>, though no lesse sory wight,<br>
 For that mishap, yet seeing him to mourne,<br>
 Drew neare, that he the truth of all by him mote learne.</p><p>
 
 And first him greeting, thus vnto him spake;<br>
 Haile iolly shepheard, which thy ioyous dayes<br>
 Here leadest in this goodly merry make,<br>
 Frequented of these gentle Nymphes alwayes,<br>
 Which to thee flocke, to heare thy louely layes;<br>
 Tell me, what mote these dainty Damzels be,<br>
 Which here with thee doe make their pleasant playes?<br>
 Right happy thou, that mayst them freely see:<br>
 But why when I them saw, fled they away from me?</p><p>
 
 Not I so happy, answerd then that swaine,<br>
 As thou vnhappy, which them thence didst chace,<br>
 Whom by no meanes thou canst recall againe;<br>
 For being gone, none can them bring in place,<br>
 But whom they of them selues list so to grace.<br>
 Right sory I, (saide then Sir <i>Calidore</i>,)<br>
 That my ill fortune did them hence displace.<br>
 But since things passed none may now restore,<br>
 Tell, me what were they all, whose lacke thee grieues so sore.</p><p>
 
 Tho gan that shepheard thus for to dilate;<br>
 Then wote thou shepheard, whatsoeuer thou bee,<br>
 That all those Ladies, which thou sawest late,<br>
 Are <i>Venus</i> Damzels, all within her fee,<br>
 But differing in honour and degree:<br>
 They all are Graces, which on her depend,<br>
 Besides a thousand more, which ready bee<br>
 Her to adorne, when so she forth doth wend:<br>
 But those three in the midst, doe chiefe on her attend.</p><p>
 
 They are the daughters of sky-ruling <i>Ioue</i>,<br>
 By him begot of faire <i>Eurynome</i>,<br>
 The Oceans daughter, in this pleasant groue,<br>
 As he this way comming from feastfull glee,<br>
 Of <i>Thetis</i> wedding with <i>Æacidee</i>,<br>
 In sommers shade himselfe here rested weary.<br>
 The first of them hight mylde <i>Euphrosyne</i>,<br>
 Next faire <i>Aglaia</i>, last <i>Thalia</i> merry:<br>
 Sweete Goddesses all three which me in mirth do cherry.</p><p>
 
 These three on men all gracious gifts bestow,<br>
 Which decke to body or adorne the mynde,<br>
 To make them louely or well fauoured show,<br>
 As comely carriage, entertainement kynde,<br>
 Sweete semblaunt, friendly offices that bynde,<br>
 And all the complements of curtesie:<br>
 They teach vs, how to each degree and kynde<br>
 We should our selues demeane, to low, to hie;<br>
 To firends, to foes, which skill men call Ciuility.</p><p>
 
 Therefore they alwaies smoothly seeme to smile,<br>
 That we likewise should mylde and gentle be,<br>
 And also naked are, that without guile<br>
 Or false dissemblaunce all them plaine may see,<br>
 Simple and true from couert malice free:<br>
 And eeke them selues so in their daunce they bore,<br>
 That two of them still fr[ow]ard seem'd to bee,<br>
 But one still towards shew'd her selfe afore;<br>
 That good should from vs goe, then come in greater store.</p><p>
 
 Such were those Goddesses, which ye did see;<br>
 But that fourth Mayd, which there amidst thẽ traced,<br>
 Who can aread, what creature mote she bee,<br>
 Whether a creature, or a goddesse graced<br>
 With heauenly gifts from heuen first enraced?<br>
 But what so sure she was, she worthy was,<br>
 For be the fourth with those three other placed:<br>
 Yet was she certes but a countrey lasse,<br>
 Yet she all other countrey lasses farre did passe.</p><p>
 
 So farre as doth the daughter of the day,<br>
 All other lesser lights in light excell,<br>
 So farre doth she in beautyfull array,<br>
 Aboue all other lasses beare the bell,<br>
 Ne lesse in vertue that beseemes her well,<br>
 Doth she exceede the rest of all her race;<br>
 For which the Graces that here wont to dwell,<br>
 Haue for more honor brought her to this place,<br>
 And graced her so much to be another Grace.</p><p>
 
 Another Grace she well deserues to be,<br>
 In whom so many Graces gathered are,<br>
 Excelling much the meane of her degree;<br>
 Diuine resemblaunce, beauty soueraine rare,<br>
 Firme Chastity, that spight ne blemish dare;<br>
 All which she with such courtesie doth grace,<br>
 That all her peres cannot with her compare,<br>
 But quite are dimmed, when she is in place.<br>
 She made me often pipe and now to pipe apace.</p><p>
 
 Sunne of the world, great glory of the sky,<br>
 That all the earth doest lighten with thy rayes,<br>
 Great <i>Gloriana</i>, greatest Maiesty,<br>
 Pardon thy shepheard, mongst so many layes,<br>
 As he hath sung of thee in all his dayes,<br>
 To make one minime of thy poore handmayd,<br>
 And vnderneath thy feete to place her prayse;<br>
 That when thy glory shall be farre displayd<br>
 To future age of her this mention may be made.</p><p>
 
 When thus that shepherd ended had his speach,<br>
 Sayd <i>Calidore</i> ; Now sure it yrketh mee,<br>
 That to thy blisse I made this luckelesse breach,<br>
 As now the author of thy bale to be,<br>
 Thus to bereaue thy Loues deare sight from thee:<br>
 But gentle Shepheard pardon thou my shame,<br>
 Who rashly sought that, which I mote not see.<br>
 Thus did the courteous Knight excuse his blame,<br>
 And to recomfort him, all comely meanes did frame.</p><p>
 
 In such discourses they together spent<br>
 Long time, as fit occasion forth them led;<br>
 With which the Knight him selfe did much content,<br>
 And with delight his greedy fancy fed,<br>
 Both of his words, which he with reason red;<br>
 And also of the place, whose pleasures rare<br>
 With such regard his sences rauished,<br>
 That thence, he had no will away to fare,<br>
 But wisht, that with that shepheard he mote dwelling share.</p><p>
 
 But that enuenimd sting, the which of yore,<br>
 His poysnous point deepe fixed in his hart<br>
 Had left, now gan afresh to rancle sore,<br>
 And to renue the rigour of his smart:<br>
 Which to recure, no skill of Leaches art<br>
 Mote him auaile, but to returne againe<br>
 To his wounds worker, that with louely dart<br>
 Dinting his brest, had bred his restlesse paine,<br>
 Like as the wounded Whale to shore flies froõ the maine.</p><p>
 
 So taking leaue of that same gentle swaine,<br>
 He backe returned to his rusticke wonne,<br>
 Where his faire <i>Pastorella</i> did remaine:<br>
 To whome in sort, as he at first begonne,<br>
 He daily did apply him selfe to donne<br>
 All dewfull seruice voide of thoughts imp[u]re:<br>
 Ne any paines ne perill did he shonne,<br>
 By which he might her to his loue allure,<br>
 And liking in her yet vntamed heart procure.</p><p>
 
 And euermore the shepheard <i>Coridon</i>,<br>
 What euer thing he did her to aggrate,<br>
 Did striue to match with strong contention,<br>
 And all his paines did closely emulate;<br>
 Whether it were to caroll, as they sate<br>
 Keeping their sheepe, or games to exercize,<br>
 Or to present her with their labours late;<br>
 Through which if any grace chaunst to arize<br>
 To him, the Shepheard streight with iealousie did frize.</p><p>
 
 One day as they all three together went<br>
 To the greene wood, to gather strawberies,<br>
 There chaunst to them a dangerous accident;<br>
 A Tigre forth out of the wood did rise,<br>
 That with fell clawes full of fierce gourmandize,<br>
 And greedy mouth, wide gaping like hell gate,<br>
 Did runne at <i>Pastorell</i>, her to surprize:<br>
 Whom she beholding, now all desolate<br>
 Gan cry to them aloud, to helpe ere all too late.</p><p>
 
 Which <i>Coridon</i> first hearing, ran in hast<br>
 To reskue her, but when he saw the feend,<br>
 Through cowherd feare he fled away as fast,<br>
 Ne durst abide the daunger of the end;<br>
 His life he steemed dearer then his frend.<br>
 But <i>Calidore</i> soone comming to her ayde,<br>
 When he the beast saw ready now to rend<br>
 His Loues deare spoile, in which his heart was prayde,<br>
 He ran at him enrag[e]d in stead of being frayde.</p><p>
 
 He had no weapon, but his shepheards hooke,<br>
 To serue the vengeaunce of his wrathfull will;<br>
 With which so sternely he the monster strooke,<br>
 That to the ground astonished he fell;<br>
 Whence ere he could recou'r, he did him quell,<br>
 And hewing off his head, [he] it presented<br>
 Before the feete of the faire <i>Pastorell</i>;<br>
 Who scarcely yet from former feare exempted,<br>
 A thousand times him thankt, that had her death preuented.</p><p>
 
 From that day forth she gan him to affect,<br>
 And daily more her fauour to augment;<br>
 But <i>Coridon</i> for cowherdize reiect,<br>
 Fit to keepe sheepe, vnfit for loues content:<br>
 The gentle heart scornes base disparagement.<br>
 Yet <i>Calidore</i> did not despise him quight,<br>
 But vsde him friendly for further intent,<br>
 That by his fellowship, he colour might<br>
 Both his estate, and loue from skill of any wight.</p><p>
 
 So well he wood her, and so well he wrought her,<br>
 With humble seruice, and with daily sute,<br>
 That at the last vnto his will he brought her;<br>
 Which he so wisely well did prosecute,<br>
 That of his loue he reapt the timely frute,<br>
 And ioyed long in close felicity:<br>
 Till fortune fraught with malice, blinde, and brute,<br>
 That enuies louers long prosperity,<br>
 Blew vp a bitter storme of foule aduersity.</p><p>
 
 It fortuned one day, when <i>Calidore</i><br>
 Was hunting in the woods (as was his trade)<br>
 A lawlesse people, <i>Brigants</i> hight of yore,<br>
 That neuer vsde to liue by plough nor spade,<br>
 But fed on spoile and booty, which they made<br>
 Vpon their neighbours, which did nigh them border,<br>
 The dwelling of these shepheards did inuade,<br>
 And spoyld their houses, and them selues did murder;<br>
 And droue away their flocks, with other much disorder.</p><p>
 
 Amongst the rest, the which they then did pray,<br>
 They spoyld old <i>Melibee</i> of all he had,<br>
 And all his people captiue led away;<br>
 Mongst which this lucklesse mayd away was lad,<br>
 Faire <i>Pastorella</i>, sorrowfull and sad,<br>
 Most sorrowfull, most sad, that euer sigh't,<br>
 Now made the spoile of theeues and <i>Brigants</i> bad,<br>
 Which was the conquest of the gentlest Knight,<br>
 That euer liu'd, and th'onely glory of his might.</p><p>
 
 With them also was taken <i>Coridon</i>,<br>
 And carried captiue by those theeues away;<br>
 Who in the couert of the night, that none<br>
 Mote them descry, nor reskue from their pray,<br>
 Vnto their dwelling did them close conuay.<br>
 Their dwelling in a little Island was,<br>
 Couered with shrubby woods, in which no way<br>
 Appeard for people in nor out to pas,<br>
 Nor any footing fynde for ouergrowen gras.</p><p>
 
 For vnderneath the ground their way was made,<br>
 Through hollow caues, that no man mote discouer<br>
 For the thicke shrubs, which did them alwaies shade<br>
 From view of liuing wight, and couered ouer:<br>
 But darkenesse dred and daily night did houer<br>
 Through all the inner parts, wherein they dwelt,<br>
 Ne lightned was with window, nor with louer,<br>
 But with continuall candlelight, which delt<br>
 A doubtfull sense of things, not so well seene, as felt.</p><p>
 
 Hither those <i>Brigants</i> brought their present pray,<br>
 And kept them with continuall watch and ward,<br>
 Meaning so soone, as they conuenient may,<br>
 For slaues to sell them, for no small reward,<br>
 To merchants, which them kept in bondage hard,<br>
 Or sold againe. Now when faire <i>Pastorell</i><br>
 Into this place was brought, and kept with gard<br>
 Of griesly theeues, she thought her self in hell,<br>
 Where with such damned fiends she should in darknesse dwell.</p><p>
 
 But for to tell the dolefull dreriment,<br>
 And pittifull complaints, which there she made,<br>
 Where day and night she nought did but lament<br>
 Her wretched life, shut vp in deadly shade,<br>
 And waste her goodly beauty, which did fade<br>
 Like to a flowre, that feeles no heate of sunne,<br>
 Which may her feeble leaues with comfort glade.<br>
 But what befell her in that theeuish wonne,<br>
 Will in an other Canto better be begonne.</p><p>
