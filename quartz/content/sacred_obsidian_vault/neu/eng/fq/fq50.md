 </p><blockquote> 
 <i>Marinells former wound is heald,<br>
 he comes to Proteus hall,<br>
 Where Thames doth the Medway wedd,<br>
 and feasts the Sea-gods all.</i><p>

 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 B
 Vt ah for pittie that I haue thus long<br>
 Left a fayre Ladie languishing in payne:<br>
 Now well away, that I haue doen such wrong,<br>
 To let faire <i>Florimell</i> in bands remayne,<br>
 In bands of loue, and in sad thraldomes chayne;<br>
 From which vnlesse some heauenly powre her free<br>
 By miracle, not yet appearing playne,<br>
 She lenger yet is like captiu'd to bee:<br>
 That euen to thinke thereof, it inly pitties mee.<p>
 
 Here neede you to remember, how erewhile<br>
 Vnlouely <i>Proteus</i>, missing to his mind<br>
 That Virgins loue to win by wit or wile,<br>
 Her threw into a dongeon deepe and blind,<br>
 And there in chaynes her cruelly did bind,<br>
 In hope thereby her to his bent to draw:<br>
 For when as neither gifts nor graces kind<br>
 Her constant mind could moue at all he saw,<br>
 He thought her to compell by crueltie and awe.</p><p>
 
 Deepe in the bottome of an huge great rocke<br>
 The dongeon was, in which her bound he left,<br>
 That neither yron barres, nor brasen locke<br>
 Did neede to gard from force, or secret theft<br>
 Of all her louers, which would her haue reft.<br>
 For wall'd it was with waues, which rag'd and ror'd<br>
 As they the cliffe in peeces would haue cleft;<br>
 Besides ten thousand monsters foule abhor'd<br>
 Did waite about it, gaping griesly all begor'd.</p><p>
 
 And in the midst thereof did horror dwell,<br>
 And darkenesse dredd, that neuer viewed day,<br>
 Like to the balefull house of lowest hell,<br>
 In which old <i>Styx</i> her aged bones alway,<br>
 Old <i>Styx</i> the Grandame of the Gods, doth lay.<br>
 There did this lucklesse mayd seuen months abide,<br>
 Ne euer euening saw, ne mornings ray,<br>
 Ne euer from the day the night descride,<br>
 But thought it all one night, that did no houres diuide.</p><p>
 
 And all this was for loue of <i>Marinell</i>,<br>
 Who her despysd (ah who would her despyse?)<br>
 And wemens loue did from his hart expell,<br>
 And all those ioyes that weake mankind entyse.<br>
 Nathlesse his pride full dearely he did pryse;<br>
 For of a womans hand it was ywroke,<br>
 That of the wound he yet in languor lyes,<br>
 Ne can be cured of that cruell stroke<br>
 Which <i>Britomart</i> him gaue, when he did her prouoke.</p><p>
 
 Yet farre and neare the Nymph his mother sought,<br>
 And many salues did to his sore applie,<br>
 And many herbes did vse.  But when as nought<br>
 She saw could ease his rankling maladie,<br>
 At last to <i>Tryphon</i> she for helpe did hie,<br>
 (This <i>Tryphon</i> is the seagods surgeon hight)<br>
 Whom she besought to find some remedie:<br>
 And for his paines a whistle him behight<br>
 That of a fishes shell was wrought with rare delight.</p><p>
 
 So well that Leach did hearke to her request,<br>
 And did so well employ his carefull paine,<br>
 That in short space his hurts he had redrest,<br>
 And him restor'd to healthfull state againe:<br>
 In which he long time after did remaine<br>
 There with the Nymph his mother, like her thrall;<br>
 Who sore against his will did him retaine,<br>
 For feare of perill, which to him mote fall,<br>
 Through his too ventrous prowesse proued ouer all.</p><p>
 
 It fortun'd then, a solemne feast was there<br>
 To all the Sea-gods and their fruitfull seede,<br>
 In honour of the spousalls, which then were<br>
 Betwixt the <i>Medway</i> and the <i>Thames</i> agreed.<br>
 Long had the <i>Thames</i> (as we in records reed)<br>
 Before that day her wooed to his bed;<br>
 But the proud Nymph would for no worldly meed,<br>
 Nor no entreatie to his loue be led;<br>
 Till now at last relenting, she to him was wed.</p><p>
 
 So both agreed, that this their bridale feast<br>
 Should for the Gods in <i>Proteus</i> house be made;<br>
 To which they all repayr'd, both most and least,<br>
 Aswell which in the mightie Ocean trade,<br>
 As that in riuers swim, or brookes doe wade.<br>
 All which not if an hundred tongues to tell,<br>
 And hundred mouthes, and voice of brasse I had,<br>
 And endlesse memorie, that mote excell,<br>
 In order as they came, could I recount them well.</p><p>
 
 Helpe therefore, O thou sacred imp of <i>Ioue</i>,<br>
 The noursling of Dame <i>Memorie</i> his deare,<br>
 To whom those rolles, layd vp in heauen aboue,<br>
 And records of antiquitie appeare,<br>
 To which no wit of man may comen neare;<br>
 Helpe me to tell the names of all those floods,<br>
 And all those Nymphes, which then assembled were<br>
 To that great banquet of the watry Gods,<br>
 And all their sundry kinds, and all their hid abodes.</p><p>
 
 First came great <i>Neptune</i> with his threeforkt mace,<br>
 That rules the Seas, and makes them rise or fall;<br>
 His dewy lockes did drop with brine apace,<br>
 Vnder his Diademe imperiall:<br>
 And by his side his Queene with coronall,<br>
 Faire <i>Amphitrite</i>, most diuinely faire,<br>
 Whose yuorie shoulders weren couered all,<br>
 As with a robe, with her owne siluer haire,<br>
 And deckt with pearles, which th'Indian seas for her prepaire.</p><p>
 
 These marched farre afore the other crew;<br>
 And all the way before them as they went,<br>
 <i>Triton</i> his trompet shrill before them blew,<br>
 For goodly triumph and great iollyment,<br>
 That made the rockes to roare, as they were rent.<br>
 And after them the royall issue came,<br>
 Which of them sprung by lineall descent:<br>
 First the Sea-gods, which to themselues doe clame<br>
 The powre to rule the billowes, and the waues to tame.</p><p>
 
 <i>Phorcys</i>, the father of that fatall brood,<br>
 By whom those old Heroes wonne such fame;<br>
 And <i>Glaucus</i>, that wise southsayes vnderstood;<br>
 And tragicke <i>Inoes</i> sonne, the which became<br>
 A God of seas through his mad mothers blame,<br>
 Now hight <i>Palemon</i>, and is saylers frend;<br>
 Great <i>Brontes</i>, and <i>Astraeus</i>, that did shame<br>
 Himselfe with incest of his kin vnkend;<br>
 And huge <i>Orion</i>, that doth tempests still portend.</p><p>
 
 The rich <i>Cteatus</i>, and <i>Eurytus</i> long;<br>
 <i>Neleus</i> and <i>Pelias</i> louely brethren both;<br>
 Mightie <i>Chrysaor</i>, and <i>Caicus</i> strong;<br>
 <i>Eurypulus</i>, that calmes the waters wroth;<br>
 And faire <i>Euphaemus</i>, that vpon them go'th<br>
 As on the ground, without dismay or dread:<br>
 Fierce <i>Eryx</i>, and <i>Alebius</i> that know'th<br>
 The waters depth, and doth their bottome tread;<br>
 And sad <i>Asopus</i>, comely with his hoarie head.</p><p>
 
 There also some most famous founders were<br>
 Of puissant Nations, which the world possest;<br>
 Yet sonnes of <i>Neptune</i>, now assembled here:<br>
 Ancient <i>Ogyges</i>, even th'auncientest,<br>
 And <i>Inachus</i> renowmd aboue the rest;<br>
 <i>Phoenix</i>, and <i>Aon</i>, and <i>Pelasgus</i> old,<br>
 Great <i>Belus</i>, <i>Phoeax</i>, and <i>Agenor</i> best;<br>
 And mightie <i>Albion</i>, father of the bold<br>
 And warlike people, which the <i>Britaine</i> Islands hold.</p><p>
 
 For <i>Albion</i> the sonne of <i>Neptune</i> was,<br>
 Who for the proofe of his great puissance,<br>
 Out of his <i>Albion</i> did on dry-foot pas<br>
 Into old <i>Gall</i>, that now is cleeped <i>France</i>,<br>
 To fight with <i>Hercules</i>, that did aduance<br>
 To vanquish all the world with matchlesse might,<br>
 And there his mortall part by great mischance<br>
 Was slaine: but that which is th'immortall spright<br>
 Liues still: and to this feast with <i>Neptunes</i> seed was dight.</p><p>
 
 But what doe I their names seeke to reherse,<br>
 Which all the world haue with their issue fild?<br>
 How can they all in this so narrow verse<br>
 Contayned be, and in small compasse hild?<br>
 Let them record them, that are better skild,<br>
 And know the moniments of passed times:<br>
 Onely what needeth, shall be here fulfild,<br>
 T'expresse some part of that great equipage,<br>
 Which from great <i>Neptune</i> do deriue their parentage.</p><p>
 
 Next came the aged <i>Ocean</i>, and his Dame,<br>
 Old <i>Tethys</i>, th'oldest two of all the rest,<br>
 For all the rest of those two parents came,<br>
 Which afterward both sea and land possest:<br>
 Of all which <i>Nereus</i> th'eldest, and the best,<br>
 Did first proceed, then which none more vpright,<br>
 Ne more sincere in word and deed profest;<br>
 Most voide of guile, most free from fowle despight,<br>
 Doing him selfe, and teaching others to doe right.</p><p>
 
 Thereto he was expert in prophecies,<br>
 And could the ledden of the Gods vnfold,<br>
 Through which, when <i>Paris</i> brought his famous prise<br>
 The faire Tindarid lasse, he him fortold,<br>
 That her all <i>Greece</i> with many a champion bold<br>
 Should fetch againe, and finally destroy<br>
 Proud <i>Priams</i> towne. So wise is <i>Nereus</i> old,<br>
 And so well skild; nathlesse he takes great ioy<br>
 Oft-times amõgst the wanton Nymphs to sport and toy.</p><p>
 
 And after him the famous riuers came,<br>
 Which doe the earth enrich and beautifie:<br>
 The fertile Nile, which creatures new doth frame;<br>
 Long Rhodanus, whose sourse springs from the skie;<br>
 Faire Ister, flowing from the mountaines hie;<br>
 Diuine Scamander, purpled yet with blood<br>
 Of Greekes and Troians, which therein did die;<br>
 Pactolus glistring with his golden flood,<br>
 And Tygris fierce, whose streames of none may be withstood.</p><p>
 
 Great Ganges, and immortall Euphrates,<br>
 Deepe Indus, and Maeander intricate,<br>
 Slow Peneus, and tempestuous Phasides,<br>
 Swift Rhene, and Alpheus still immaculate:<br>
 Ooraxes, feared for great <i>Cyrus</i> fate;<br>
 Tybris, renowmed for the Romaines fame,<br>
 Rich Oranochy, though but knowen late;<br>
 And that huge Riuer, which doth beare his name<br>
 Of warlike Amazons, which doe possesse the same.</p><p>
 
 Ioy on those warlike women, which so long<br>
 Can from all men so rich a kingdome hold;<br>
 And shame on you, ô men, which boast your strong<br>
 And valiant hearts, in thoughts lesse hard and bold,<br>
 Yet quaile in conquest of that land of gold.<br>
 But this to you, ô Britons, most pertaines,<br>
 To whom the right hereof it selfe hath sold;<br>
 The which for sparing litle cost or paines,<br>
 Loose so immortall glory, and so endlesse gaines.</p><p>
 
 Then was there heard a most celestiall sound,<br>
 Of dainty musicke, which did next ensew<br>
 Before the spouse: that was <i>Arion</i> crownd;<br>
 Who playing on his harpe, vnto him drew<br>
 The eares and hearts of all that goodly crew,<br>
 That euen yet the Dolphin, which him bore<br>
 Through the AEgaean seas from Pirates vew,<br>
 Stood still by him astonisht at his lore,<br>
 And all the raging seas for ioy forgot to rore.</p><p>
 
 So went he playing on the watery plaine.<br>
 Soone after whom the louely Bridegroome came,<br>
 The noble Thamis, with all his goodly traine,<br>
 But him before there went, as best became<br>
 His auncient parents, namely th'auncient Thame.<br>
 But much more aged was his wife then he,<br>
 The Ouze, whom men doe Isis rightly name;<br>
 Full weake and crooked creature seemed she,<br>
 And almost blind through eld, that scarce her way could see.</p><p>
 
 Therefore on either side she was sustained<br>
 Of two smal grooms, which by their names were hight<br>
 The <i>Churne</i>, and <i>Charwell</i>, two small streames, which pained<br>
 Them selues her footing to direct aright,<br>
 Which fayled oft through faint and feeble plight:<br>
 But <i>Thame</i> was stronger, and of better stay;<br>
 Yet seem'd full aged by his outward sight,<br>
 With head all hoary, and his beard all gray,<br>
 Deawed with siluer drops, that trickled downe alway.</p><p>
 
 And eke he somewhat seem'd to stoupe afore<br>
 With bowed backe, by reason of the lode,<br>
 And auncient heauy burden, which he bore<br>
 Of that faire City, wherein make abode<br>
 So many learned impes, that shoote abrode,<br>
 And with their braunches spred all Britany,<br>
 No lesse then do her elder sisters broode.<br>
 Ioy to you both, ye double noursery<br>
 Or Arts, but Oxford thine doth <i>Thame</i> most glorify.</p><p>
 
 But he their sonne full fresh and iolly was,<br>
 All decked in a robe of watchet hew,<br>
 On which the waues, glittering like Christall glas,<br>
 So cunningly enwouen were, that few<br>
 Could weenen, whether they were false or trew.<br>
 And on his head like to a Coronet<br>
 He wore, that seemed strange to common vew,<br>
 In which were many towres and castels set,<br>
 That it encompast round as with a golden fret.</p><p>
 
 Like as the mother of the Gods, they say,<br>
 In her great iron charet wonts to ride,<br>
 When to <i>Ioues</i> pallace she doth take her way;<br>
 Old <i>Cybele</i>, arayd with pompous pride,<br>
 Wearing a Diademe embattild wide<br>
 With hundred turrets, like a Turribant.<br>
 With such an one was Thamis beautifide;<br>
 That was to weet the famous Troynouant,<br>
 In which her kingdomes throne is chiefly resiant.</p><p>
 
 And round about him many a pretty Page<br>
 Attended duely, ready to obay;<br>
 All little Riuers, which owe vassallage<br>
 To him, as to their Lord, and tribute pay:<br>
 The chaulky Kenet, and the Thetis gray,<br>
 The morish Cole, and the soft sliding Breane,<br>
 The wanton Lee, that oft doth loose his way,<br>
 And the still Darent, in whose waters cleane<br>
 Ten thousand fishes play, and decke his pleasant streame.</p><p>
 
 Then came his neighbour flouds, which nigh him dwell,<br>
 And water all the English soile throughout;<br>
 They all on him this day attended well;<br>
 And with meet seruice waited him about;<br>
 Ne none disdained low to him to lout:<br>
 No not the stately Seuerne grudg'd at all,<br>
 Ne storming Humber, though he looked stout;<br>
 But both him honor'd as their principall,<br>
 And let their swelling waters low before him fall.</p><p>
 
 There was the speedy Tamar, which deuides<br>
 The Cornish and the Deuonish confines;<br>
 Through both whose borders swiftly downe it glides,<br>
 And meeting Plim, to Plimmouth thence declines:<br>
 And Dart, nigh chockt with sands of tinny mines.<br>
 But Auon marched in more stately path,<br>
 Proud of his Adamants, with which he shines<br>
 And glisters wide, as als' of wondrous Bath,<br>
 And Bristow faire, which on his waues he builded hath.</p><p>
 
 And there came Stoure with terrible aspect,<br>
 Bearing his sixe deformed heads on hye,<br>
 That doth his course through Blandford plains direct,<br>
 And washeth Winborne meades in season drye.<br>
 Next him went Wylibourne with passage slye,<br>
 That of his wylinesse his name doth take,<br>
 And of him selfe doth name the shire thereby;<br>
 And Mole, that like a nousling Mole doth make<br>
 His way still vnder ground, till Thamis he ouertake.</p><p>
 
 Then came the Rother, decked all with woods<br>
 Like a wood God, and flowing fast to Rhy:<br>
 And Sture, that parteth with his pleasant floods<br>
 The Easterne Saxons from the Southerne ny,<br>
 And Clare, and Harwitch both doth beautify:<br>
 Him follow'd Yar, soft washing Norwitch wall,<br>
 And with him brought a present ioyfully<br>
 Of his owne fish vnto their festiuall,<br>
 Whose like none else could shew, the which they Ruffins call.</p><p>
 
 Next these the plenteous Ouse came far from land,<br>
 By many a city, and by many a towne,<br>
 And many riuers taking vnder hand<br>
 Into his waters, as he passeth downe,<br>
 The Cle, the Were, the Grant, the Sture, the Rowne.<br>
 Thence doth by Huntingdon and Cambridge flit;<br>
 My mother Cambridge, whom as with a Crowne<br>
 He doth adorne, and is adorn'd of it<br>
 With many a gentle Muse, and many a learned wit.</p><p>
 
 And after him the fatall Welland went,<br>
 That if old sawes proue true (which God forbid)<br>
 Shall drowne all Holland with his excrement,<br>
 And shall see Stamford, though now homely hid,<br>
 Then shine in learning, more then euer did<br>
 Cambridge or Oxford, Englands goodly beames.<br>
 And next to him the <i>Nene</i> downe softly slid;<br>
 And bounteous Trent, that in him selfe enseames<br>
 Both thirty sorts of fish, and thirty sundry streames.</p><p>
 
 Next these came Tyne, along whose stony bancke<br>
 That Romaine Monarch built a brasen wall,<br>
 Which mote the feebled Britons strongly flancke<br>
 Against the Picts, that swarmed ouer all,<br>
 Which yet thereof Gualseuer they doe call:<br>
 And Twede the limit betwixt Logris land<br>
 And Albany: And Eden though but small,<br>
 Yet often stainde with bloud of many a band<br>
 Of Scots and English both, that tyned on his strand.</p><p>
 
 Then came those sixe sad brethren, like forlorne,<br>
 That whilome were (as antique fathers tell)<br>
 Sixe valiant Knights, of one faire Nymphe yborne,<br>
 Which did in noble deedes of armes excell,<br>
 And wonned there, where now Yorke people dwell;<br>
 Still Vre, swift Werfe, and Oze the most of might,<br>
 High Swale, vnquiet Nide, and troublous Skell;<br>
 All whom a Scythian king, that Humber hight,<br>
 Slew cruelly, and in the riuer drowned quight.</p><p>
 
 But past not long, ere <i>Brutus</i> warlicke sonne<br>
 <i>Locrinus</i> them aueng'd, and the same date,<br>
 Which the proud Humber vnto them had donne,<br>
 By equall dome repayd on his owne pate:<br>
 For in the selfe same riuer, where he late<br>
 Had drenched them, he drowned him againe;<br>
 And nam'd the riuer of his wretched fate;<br>
 Whose bad condition yet it doth retaine,<br>
 Oft tossed with his stormes, which therein still remaine.</p><p>
 
 These after, came the stony shallow Lone,<br>
 That to old Loncaster his name doth lend;<br>
 And following Dee, which Britons long ygone<br>
 Did call diuine, that doth by Chester tend;<br>
 And Conway which out of his streame doth send<br>
 Plenty of pearles to decke his dames withall,<br>
 And Lindus that his pikes doth most commend,<br>
 Of which the auncient Lincolne men doe call;<br>
 All these together marched toward <i>Proteus</i> hall.</p><p>
 
 Ne thence the Irishe Riuers absent were:<br>
 Sith no lesse famous then the rest they bee,<br>
 And ioyne in neighbourhood of kingdome nere,<br>
 Why should they not likewise in loue agree,<br>
 And ioy likewise this solemne day to see?<br>
 They saw it all, and present were in place;<br>
 Though I them all according their degree,<br>
 Cannot recount, nor tell their hidden race,<br>
 Nor read the saluage c&amp;utilds;treis, thorough which they pace.</p><p>
 
 There was the Liffy rolling downe the lea,<br>
 The sandy Slane, the stony Aubrian,<br>
 The spacious Shenan spreading like a sea,<br>
 The pleasant Boyne, the fishy fruitfull Ban,<br>
 Swift Awniduff, which of the English man<br>
 Is cal'de Blacke water, and the Liffar deep,<br>
 Sad Trowis, that once his people ouerran,<br>
 Strong Allo tombling from Slewlogher steep,<br>
 And Mulla mine, whose waues I whilom taught to weep.</p><p>
 
 And there the three renowmed brethren were,<br>
 Which that great Gyant <i>Blomius</i> begot,<br>
 Of the faire Nimph <i>Rheusa</i> wandring there.<br>
 One day, as she to shunne the season whot,<br>
 Vnder Slewbloome in shady groue was got,<br>
 This Gyant found her, and by force deflowr'd:<br>
 Whereof conceiuing, she in time forth brought<br>
 These three faire sons, which being thẽce forth powrd<br>
 In three great riuers ran, and many countreis scowrd.</p><p>
 
 The first, the gentle Shure that making way<br>
 By sweet Clonmell, adornes rich Waterford;<br>
 The next, the stubborne Newre, whose waters gray<br>
 By faire Kilkenny and Rosseponte boord,<br>
 The third, the goodly Barow, which doth hoord<br>
 Great heapes of Salmons in his deepe bosome:<br>
 All which long sundred, doe at last accord<br>
 To ioyne in one, ere to the sea they come,<br>
 So flowing all from one, all one at last become.</p><p>
 
 There also was the wide embayed Mayre,<br>
 The pleasaunt Bandon crownd with many a wood,<br>
 The spreading Lee, that like an Island fayre<br>
 Encloseth Corke with his deuided flood;<br>
 And balefull Oure, late staind with English blood:<br>
 With many more, whose names no tongue can tell.<br>
 All which that day in order seemly good<br>
 Did on the Thamis attend, and waited well<br>
 To doe their duefull seruice, as to them befell.</p><p>
 
 Then came the Bride, the louely <i>Medua</i> came,<br>
 Clad in a vesture of vnknowen geare,<br>
 And vncouth fashion, yet her well became;<br>
 That seem'd like siluer, sprinckled here and theare<br>
 With glittering spangs, that did like starres appeare,<br>
 And wau'd vpon, like water Chamelot,<br>
 To hide the metall, which yet euery where<br>
 Bewrayd it selfe, to let men plainely wot,<br>
 It was no mortall worke, that seem'd and yet was not.</p><p>
 
 Her goodly lockes adowne her backe did flow<br>
 Vnto her waste, with flowres bescattered,<br>
 The which ambrosiall odours forth did throw<br>
 To all about, and all her shoulders spred<br>
 As a new spring; and likewise on her hed<br>
 A Chapelet of sundry flowers she wore,<br>
 From vnder which the deawy humour shed,<br>
 Did tricle downe her haire, like to the hore<br>
 Congealed litle drops, which doe the morne adore.</p><p>
 
 On her two pretty handmaides did attend,<br>
 One cald the <i>Theise</i>, the other cald the <i>Crane</i>;<br>
 Which on her waited, things amisse to mend,<br>
 And both behind vpheld her spredding traine;<br>
 Vnder the which, her feet appeared plaine,<br>
 Her siluer feet, faire washt against this day:<br>
 And her before there paced Pages twaine,<br>
 Both clad in colours like, and like array,<br>
 The <i>Doune</i> &amp; eke the <i>Frith</i>, both which prepard her way.</p><p>
 
 And after these the Sea Nymphs marched all,<br>
 All goodly damzels, deckt with long greene haire,<br>
 Whom of their sire <i>Nereides</i> men call,<br>
 All which the Oceans daughter to him bare<br>
 The gray eyde <i>Doris</i>: all which fifty are;<br>
 All which she there on her attending had.<br>
 Swift <i>Proto</i>, milde <i>Eucrate</i>, <i>Thetis</i> faire,<br>
 Soft <i>Spio</i>, sweete <i>Eudore</i>, <i>Sao</i> sad,<br>
 Light <i>Doto</i>, wanton <i>Glauce</i>, and <i>Galene</i> glad.</p><p>
 
 White hand <i>Eunica</i>, proud <i>Dynamene</i>,<br>
 Ioyous <i>Thalia</i>, goodly <i>Amphitrite</i>,<br>
 Louely <i>Pasithee</i>, kinde <i>Eulimene</i>,<br>
 Lifht goote <i>Cymothoe</i>, and sweete <i>Melite</i>,<br>
 Fairest <i>Pherusa</i>, <i>Phao</i> lilly white,<br>
 Wondred <i>Agaue</i>, <i>Poris</i>, and <i>Nesæa</i>,<br>
 With <i>Erato</i> that doth in loue delite,<br>
 And <i>Panopæ</i>, and wise <i>Protomedæa</i>,<br>
 And snowy neckd <i>Doris</i>, and milkewhite <i>Galathæa</i>.</p><p>
 
 Speedy <i>Hippothoe</i>, and chaste <i>Actea</i>,<br>
 Large <i>Lisianassa</i>, and <i>Pronæa</i> sage,<br>
 <i>Euagore</i>, and light <i>Pontoporea</i>,<br>
 And she, that with her least word can asswage<br>
 The surging seas, when they do sorest rage,<br>
 <i>Cymodoce</i>, and stout <i>Autonoe</i>,<br>
 And <i>Neso</i>, and <i>Eione</i> well in age,<br>
 And seeming still to smile, <i>Glauconome</i>,<br>
 And she that hight of many heastes <i>Polynome</i>,</p><p>
 
 Fresh <i>Alimeda</i>, deckt with girlond greene;<br>
 <i>Hyponeo</i>, with salt bedewed wrests:<br>
 <i>Laomedia</i>, like the christall sheene;<br>
 <i>Liagore</i>, much praisd for wise behests;<br>
 And <i>Psamathe</i>, for her brode snowy brests;<br>
 <i>Cymo</i>, <i>Eupompe</i>, and <i>Themiste</i> iust;<br>
 And she that vertue loues and vice detests<br>
 <i>Euarna</i>, and <i>Menippe</i> true in trust,<br>
 And <i>Nemertea</i> learned well to rule her lust.</p><p>
 
 All these the daughters of old <i>Nereus</i> were,<br>
 Which haue the sea in charge to them assinde,<br>
 To rule his tides, and surges to vprere,<br>
 To bring forth stormes, or fast them to vpbinde,<br>
 And sailers saue from wreckes of wrathfull winde.<br>
 And yet besides three thousand more there were<br>
 Of th'Oceans seede, but <i>Ioues</i> and <i>Phoebus</i> kinde;<br>
 The which in floods and fountaines doe appere,<br>
 And all mankinde do nourish with their waters clere.</p><p>
 
 The which, more eath it were for mortall wight,<br>
 To tell the sands, or count the starres on hye,<br>
 Or ought more hard, then thinke to reckon right.<br>
 But well I wote, that these which I descry,<br>
 Were present at this great solemnity:<br>
 And there amongst the rest, the mother was<br>
 Of luckelesse <i>Marinell Cymodoce</i>.<br>
 Which, for my Muse her selfe now tyred has,<br>
 Vnto an other Canto I will ouerpas.</p><p>
