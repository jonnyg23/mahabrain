 <i>Guyon, by Palmers gouernance,<br>

 <p>
 </p><blockquote> 
 N
 Ow gins this goodly frame of Temperance<br>
 Fairely to rise, and her adorned hed<br>
 To pricke of highest praise forth to aduance,<br>
 Formerly grounded, and fast setteled<br>
 On firme foundation of true bountihed;<br>
 And this braue knight, that for that vertue fights,<br>
 Now comes to point of that same perilous sted,<br>
 Where Pleasure dwelles in sensuall delights,<br>
 Mõgst thousand dangers, &amp; ten thousand magick mights.<p>
  
 Two dayes now in that sea he sayled has,<br>
 Ne euer land beheld, ne liuing wight,<br>
 Ne ought saue perill, still as he did pas:<br>
 Tho when appeared the third <i>Morrow</i> bright,<br>
 Vpon the waues to spred her trembling light,<br>
 An hideous roaring farre away they heard,<br>
 That all their senses filled with affright,<br>
 And streight they saw the raging surges reard<br>
 Vp to the skyes, that them of drowning made affeard.</p><p>
  
 Said then the Boteman, Palmer stere aright,<br>
 And keepe an euen course; for yonder way<br>
 We needes must passe (God do vs well acquight,)<br>
 That is the <i>Gulfe of Greedinesse</i>, they say,<br>
 That deepe engorgeth all this worldes pray:<br>
 Which hauing swallowd vp excessiuely,<br>
 He soone in vomit vp againe doth lay,<br>
 And belcheth forth his superfluity,<br>
 That all the seas for feare do seeme away to fly.</p><p>
  
 On th'other side an hideous Rocke is pight,<br>
 Of mightie <i>Magnes</i> stone, whose craggie clift<br>
 Depending from on high, dreadfull to sight,<br>
 Ouer the waues his rugged armes doth lift,<br>
 And threatneth downe to throw his ragged rift<br>
 On who so commeth nigh; yet nigh it drawes<br>
 All passengers, that none from it can shift:<br>
 For whiles they fly that Gulfes deuouring iawes,<br>
 They on this rock are rent, and sunck in helplesse wawes.</p><p>
  
 Forward they passe, and strongly he them rowes,<br>
 Vntill they nigh vnto that Gulfe arriue,<br>
 Where streame more violent and greedy growes:<br>
 Then he with all his puissance doth striue<br>
 To strike his oares, and mightily doth driue<br>
 The hollow vessell through the threatfull waue,<br>
 Which gaping wide, to swallow them aliue,<br>
 In th'huge abysse of his engulfing graue,<br>
 Doth rore at them in vaine, and with great terror raue.</p><p>
  
 They passing by, that griesly mouth did see,<br>
 Sucking the seas into his entralles deepe,<br>
 That seem'd more horrible then hell to bee,<br>
 Or that darke dreadfull hole of <i>Tartare</i> steepe,<br>
 Through which the damned ghosts doen often creepe<br>
 Backe to the world, bad liuers to torment:<br>
 But nought that falles into this direfull deepe,<br>
 Ne that approcheth nigh the wide descent,<br>
 May backe returne, but is condemned to be drent.</p><p>
  
 On th'other side, they saw that perilous Rocke,<br>
 Threatning it selfe on them to ruinate,<br>
 On whose sharpe clifts the ribs of vessels broke,<br>
 And shiuered ships, which had bene wrecked late,<br>
 Yet stuck, with carkasses exanimate<br>
 Of such, as hauing all their substance spent<br>
 In wanton ioyes, and lustes intemperate,<br>
 Did afterwards make shipwracke violent,<br>
 Both of their life, and fame for euer fowly blent.</p><p>
  
 For thy, this hight <i>The Rocke of</i> vile <i>Reproch</i>,<br>
 A daungerous and detestable place,<br>
 To which nor fish nor fowle did once approch,<br>
 But yelling Meawes, with Seagulles hoarse and bace,<br>
 And Cormoyrants, with birds of rauenous race,<br>
 Which still sate waiting on that wastfull clift,<br>
 For spoyle of wretches, whose vnhappie cace,<br>
 After lost credite and consumed thrift,<br>
 At last them driuen hath to this despairefull drift.</p><p>
  
 The Palmer seeing them in safetie past,<br>
 Thus said; Behold th'ensamples in our sights,<br>
 Of lustfull luxurie and thriftlesse wast:<br>
 What now is left of miserable wights,<br>
 Which spent their looser daies in lewd delights,<br>
 But shame and sad reproch, here to be red,<br>
 By these rent reliques, speaking their ill plights?<br>
 Let all that liue, hereby be counselled,<br>
 To shunne <i>Rocke of Reproch</i>, and it as death to dred.</p><p>
  
 So forth they rowed, and that <i>Ferryman</i><br>
 With his stiffe oares did brush the sea so strong,<br>
 That the hoare waters from his frigot ran,<br>
 And the light bubbles daunced all along,<br>
 Whiles the salt brine out of the billowes sprong.<br>
 At last farre off they many Islands spy,<br>
 On euery side floting the floods emong:<br>
 Then said the knight, Loe I the land descry,<br>
 Therefore old Syre thy course do thereunto apply.</p><p>
  
 That may not be, said then the <i>Ferryman</i><br>
 Least we vnweeting hap to be fordonne:<br>
 For those same Islands, seeming now and than,<br>
 Are not firme land, nor any certein wonne,<br>
 But straggling plots, which to and fro do ronne<br>
 In the wide waters: therefore are they hight<br>
 The <i>wandring Islands</i>.  Therefore doe them shonne;<br>
 For they haue oft drawne many a wandring wight<br>
 Into most deadly daunger and distressed plight.</p><p>
  
 Yet well they seeme to him, that farre doth vew,<br>
 Both faire and fruitfull, and the ground dispred<br>
 With grassie greene of delectable hew,<br>
 And the tall trees with leaues apparelled,<br>
 Are deckt with blossomes dyde in white and red,<br>
 That mote the passengers thereto allure;<br>
 But whosoeuer once hath fastened<br>
 His foot thereon, may neuer it recure,<br>
 But wandreth euer more vncertein and vnsure.</p><p>
  
 As th'Isle of <i>Delos</i> whylome men report<br>
 Amid th'<i>Aegæan</i> sea long time did stray,<br>
 Ne made for shipping any certaine port,<br>
 Till that <i>Latona</i> traueiling that way,<br>
 Flying from <i>Iunoes</i> wrath and hard assay,<br>
 Of her faire twins was there deliuered,<br>
 Which afterwards did rule the night and day;<br>
 Thenceforth it firmely was established,<br>
 And for <i>Apolloes</i> honor highly herried.</p><p>
  
 They to him hearken, as beseemeth meete,<br>
 And passe on forward: so their way does ly,<br>
 That one of those same Islands, which doe fleet<br>
 In the wide sea, they needes must passen by,<br>
 Which seemd so sweet and pleasant to the eye,<br>
 That it would tempt a man to touchen there:<br>
 Vpon the banck they sitting did espy<br>
 A daintie damzell, dressing of her heare,<br>
 By whom a litle skippet floting did appeare.</p><p>
  
 She them espying, loud to them can call,<br>
 Bidding them nigher draw vnto the shore;<br>
 For she had cause to busie them withall;<br>
 And therewith loudly laught: But nathemore<br>
 Would they once turne, but kept on as afore:<br>
 Which when she saw, she left her lockes vndight,<br>
 And running to her boat withouten ore,<br>
 From the departing land it launched light,<br>
 And after them did driue with all her power and might.</p><p>
  
 Whom ouertaking, she in merry sort<br>
 Them gan to bord, and purpose diuersly,<br>
 Now faining dalliance and wanton sport,<br>
 Now throwing forth lewd words immodestly;<br>
 Till that the Palmer gan full bitterly<br>
 Her to rebuke, for being loose and light:<br>
 Which not abiding, but more scornefully<br>
 Scoffing at him, that did her iustly wite,<br>
 She turnd her bote about, and from them rowed quite.</p><p>
  
 That was the wanton <i>Phoedria</i>, which late<br>
 Did ferry him ouer the <i>Idle lake</i>:<br>
 Whom nought regarding, they kept on their gate,<br>
 And all her vaine allurements did forsake,<br>
 When them the wary Boateman thus bespake;<br>
 Here now behoueth vs well to auyse,<br>
 And of our safetie good heede to take;<br>
 For here before a perlous passage lyes,<br>
 Where many Mermayds haunt, making false melodies.</p><p>
  
 But by the way, there is a great Quicksand,<br>
 And a whirlepoole of hidden ieopardy,<br>
 Therefore, Sir Palmer, keepe an euen hand;<br>
 For twixt them both the narrow way doth ly.<br>
 Scarse had he said, when hard at hand they spy<br>
 That quicksand nigh with water couered;<br>
 But by the checked waue they did descry<br>
 It plaine, and by the sea discoloured:<br>
 It called was the quicksand of <i>Vnthriftyhed</i>.</p><p>
  
 They passing by, a goodly Ship did see,<br>
 Laden from far with precious merchandize,<br>
 And brauely furnished, as ship might bee,<br>
 Which through great disauenture, or mesprize,<br>
 Her selfe had runne into that hazardize;<br>
 Whose mariners and merchants with much toyle,<br>
 Labour'd in vaine, to haue recur'd their prize,<br>
 And the rich wares to saue from pitteous spoyle,<br>
 But neither toyle nor trauell might her backe recoyle.</p><p>
  
 On th'other side they see that perilous Poole,<br>
 That called was the <i>VVhirlepoole of decay</i>,<br>
 In which full many had with haplesse doole<br>
 Beene suncke, of whom no memorie did stay:<br>
 Whose circled waters rapt with whirling sway,<br>
 Like to a restlesse wheele, still running round,<br>
 Did couet, as they passed by that way,<br>
 To draw their boate within the vtmost bound<br>
 Of his wide <i>Labyrinth</i>, and then to haue them dround.</p><p>
  
 But th'heedfull Boateman strongly forth did stretch<br>
 His brawnie armes, and all his body straine,<br>
 That th'vtmost sandy breach they shortly fetch,<br>
 Whiles the dred daunger does behind remaine.<br>
 Suddeine they see from midst of all the Maine,<br>
 The surging waters like a mountaine rise,<br>
 And the great sea puft vp with proud disdaine,<br>
 To swell aboue the measure of his guise,<br>
 As threatning to deuoure all, that his powre despise.</p><p>
  
 The waues come rolling, and the billowes rore<br>
 Outragiously, as they enraged were,<br>
 Or wrathfull <i>Neptune</i> did them driue before<br>
 His whirling charet, for exceeding feare:<br>
 For not one puffe of wind there did appeare,<br>
 That all the three thereat woxe much afrayd,<br>
 Vnweeting, what such horrour straunge did reare.<br>
 Eftsoones they saw an hideous hoast arrayd,<br>
 Of huge Sea monsters, such as liuing sence dismayd.</p><p>
  
 Most vgly shapes, and horrible aspects,<br>
 Such as Dame Nature selfe mote feare to see,<br>
 Or shame, that euer should so fowle defects<br>
 From her most cunning hand escaped bee;<br>
 All dreadfull pourtraicts of deformitee:<br>
 Spring-headed <i>Hydraes</i>, and sea-shouldring Whales,<br>
 Great whirlpooles, which all fishes make to flee,<br>
 Bright Scolopendraes, arm'd with siluer scales,<br>
 Mighty <i>Monoceroses</i>, with immeasured tayles.</p><p>
  
 The dreadfull Fish, that hath deseru'd the name<br>
 Of Death, and like him lookes in dreadfull hew,<br>
 The griesly Wasserman, that makes his game<br>
 The flying ships with swiftnesse to pursew,<br>
 The horrible Sea-satyre, that doth shew<br>
 His fearefull face in time of greatest storme,<br>
 Huge <i>Ziffius</i>, whom Mariners eschew<br>
 No lesse, then rockes, (as trauellers informe,)<br>
 And greedy <i>Rosmarines</i> with visages deforme.</p><p>
  
 All these, and thousand thousands many more,<br>
 And more deformed Monsters thousand fold,<br>
 With dreadfull noise, and hollow rombling rore,<br>
 Came rushing in the fomy waues enrold,<br>
 Which seem'd to fly for feare, them to behold:<br>
 Ne wonder, if these did the knight appall;<br>
 For all that here on earth we dreadfull hold,<br>
 Be but as bugs to fearen babes withall,<br>
 Compared to the creatures in the seas entrall.</p><p>
  
 Feare nought, (then said the Palmer well auiz'd;)<br>
 For these same Monsters are not these in deed,<br>
 But are into these fearefull shapes disguiz'd<br>
 By that same wicked witch, to worke vs dreed,<br>
 And draw from on this iourney to proceede.<br>
 Tho lifting vp his vertuous staffe on hye,<br>
 He smote the sea, which calmed was with speed,<br>
 And all that dreadfull Armie fast gan flye<br>
 Into great <i>Tethys</i> bosome, where they hidden lye.</p><p>
  
 Quit from that daunger, forth their course they kept,<br>
 And as they went, they heard a ruefull cry<br>
 Of one, that wayld and pittifull[y] wept,<br>
 That through the sea the resounding plaints did fly:<br>
 At last they in an Island did espy<br>
 A seemely Maiden, sitting by the shore,<br>
 That with great sorrow and sad agony,<br>
 Seemed some great misfortune to deplore,<br>
 And lowd to them for succour called euermore.</p><p>
  
 Which <i>Guyon</i> hearing, streight his Palmer bad,<br>
 To stere the boate towards that dolefull Mayd,<br>
 That he might know, and ease her sorrow sad:<br>
 Who him auizing better, to him sayd;<br>
 Faire Sir, be not displeasd, if disobayd:<br>
 For ill it were to hearken to her cry;<br>
 For she is inly nothing ill apayd,<br>
 But onely womanish fine forgery,<br>
 Your stubborne hart t'affect with fraile infirmity.</p><p>
  
 To which when she your courage hath inclind<br>
 Through foolish pitty, then her guilefull bayt<br>
 She will embosome deeper in your mind,<br>
 And for your ruine at the last awayt.<br>
 The knight was ruled, and the Boateman strayt<br>
 Held on his course with stayed stedfastnesse,<br>
 Ne euer shruncke, ne euer sought to bayt<br>
 His tyred armes for toylesome wearinesse,<br>
 But with his oares did sweepe the watry wildernesse.</p><p>
  
 And now they nigh approched to the sted,<br>
 Where as those Mermayds dwelt: it was a still<br>
 And calmy bay, on th'one side sheltered<br>
 With the brode shadow of an hoarie hill,<br>
 On th'other side an high rocke toured still,<br>
 That twixt them both a pleasaunt port they made,<br>
 And did like an halfe Theatre fulfill:<br>
 There those fiue sisters had continuall trade,<br>
 And vsd to bath themselues in that deceiptfull shade.</p><p>
  
 They were faire Ladies, till they fondly striu'd<br>
 With th'<i>Heliconian</i> maides for maistery;<br>
 Of whom they ouer-comen, were depriu'd<br>
 Of their proud beautie, and th'one moyity<br>
 Transform'd to fish, for their bold surquedry,<br>
 But th'vpper halfe their hew retained still,<br>
 And their sweet skill in wonted melody;<br>
 Which euer after they abusd to ill,<br>
 T'allure weake trauellers, whom gotten they did kill.</p><p>
  
 So now to <i>Guyon</i>, as he passed by,<br>
 Their pleasaunt tunes they sweetly thus applide;<br>
 O thou faire sonne of gentle Faery,<br>
 That art in mighty armes most magnifide<br>
 Aboue all knights, that euer battell tride,<br>
 O turne thy rudder hither-ward a while:<br>
 Here may thy storme-bet vessell safely ride;<br>
 This is the Port of rest from troublous toyle,<br>
 The worlds sweet In, from paine &amp; wearisome turmoyle.</p><p>
  
 With that the rolling sea resounding soft,<br>
 In his big base them fitly answered,<br>
 And on the rocke the waues breaking aloft,<br>
 A solemne Meane vnto them measured,<br>
 The whiles sweet <i>Zephirus</i> lowd whisteled<br>
 His treble, a straunge kinde of harmony;<br>
 Which <i>Guyons</i> senses softly tickeled,<br>
 That he the boateman bad row easily,<br>
 And let him heare some part of their rare melody.</p><p>
  
 But him the Palmer from that vanity,<br>
 With temperate aduice discounselled,<br>
 That they it past, and shortly gan descry<br>
 The land, to which their course they leueled;<br>
 When suddeinly a grosse fog ouer spred<br>
 With his dull vapour all that desert has,<br>
 And heauens chearefull face enueloped,<br>
 That all things one, and one as nothing was,<br>
 And this great Vniuerse seemd one confused mas.</p><p>
  
 Thereat they greatly were dismayd, ne wist<br>
 How to direct their way in darkenesse wide,<br>
 But feard to wander in that wastfull mist,<br>
 For tombling into mischiefe vnespide.<br>
 Worse is the daunger hidden, then descride.<br>
 Suddeinly an innumerable flight<br>
 Of harmefull fowles about them fluttering, cride,<br>
 And with their wicked wings them oft did smight,<br>
 And sore annoyed, groping in that griesly night.</p><p>
  
 Euen all the nation of vnfortunate<br>
 And fatall birds about them flocked were,<br>
 Such as by nature men abhorre and hate,<br>
 The ill-faste Owle, deaths dreadfull messengere,<br>
 The hoars Night-rauen, trump of dolefull drere,<br>
 The lether-winged Bat, dayes enimy,<br>
 The ruefull Strich, still waiting on the bere,<br>
 The Whistler shrill, that who so heares, doth dy,<br>
 The hellish Harpies, prophets of sad destiny.</p><p>
  
 All those, and all that else does horrour breed,<br>
 About them flew, and fild their sayles with feare:<br>
 Yet stayd they not, but forward did proceed,<br>
 Whiles th'one did row, and th'other stifly steare;<br>
 Till that at last the weather gan to cleare,<br>
 And the faire land it selfe did plainly show.<br>
 Said then the Palmer, Lo where does appeare<br>
 The sacred soile, where all our perils grow;<br>
 Therefore, Sir knight, your ready armes about you throw.</p><p>
  
 He hearkned, and his armes about him tooke,<br>
 The whiles the nimble boate so well her sped,<br>
 That with her crooked keele the land she strooke,<br>
 Then forth the noble <i>Guyon</i> sallied,<br>
 And his sage Palmer, that him gouerned;<br>
 But th'other by his boate behind did stay.<br>
 They marched fairly forth, of nought ydred,<br>
 Both firmely armd for euery hard assay,<br>
 With constancy and care, gainst daunger and dismay.</p><p>
  
 Ere long they heard an hideous bellowing<br>
 Of many beasts, that roard outrageously,<br>
 As if that hungers point, or <i>Venus</i> sting<br>
 Had them enraged with fell surquedry;<br>
 Yet nought they feard, but past on hardily,<br>
 Vntill they came in vew of those wild beasts:<br>
 Who all attonce, gaping full greedily,<br>
 And rearing fiercely their vpstarting crests,<br>
 Ran towards, to deuoure those vnexpected guests.</p><p>
  
 But soone as they approcht with deadly threat,<br>
 The Palmer ouer them his staffe vpheld,<br>
 His mighty staffe, that could all charmes defeat:<br>
 Eftsoones their stubborne courages were queld,<br>
 And high aduaunced crests downe meekely feld,<br>
 In stead of fraying, they them selues did feare,<br>
 And trembled, as them passing they beheld:<br>
 Such wondrous powre did in that staffe appeare,<br>
 All monsters to subdew to him, that did it beare.</p><p>
  
 Of that same wood it fram'd was cunningly,<br>
 Of which <i>Caduceus</i> whilome was made,<br>
 <i>Caduceus</i> the rod of <i>Mercury</i>,<br>
 With which he wonts the <i>Stygian</i> realmes inuade,<br>
 Through ghastly horrour, and eternall shade;<br>
 Th'infernall feends with it he can asswage,<br>
 And <i>Orcus</i> tame, whom nothing can perswade,<br>
 And rule the <i>Furyes</i>, when they most do rage:<br>
 Such vertue in his staffe had eke this Palmer sage.</p><p>
  
 Thence passing forth, they shortly do arriue,<br>
 Whereas the Bowre of <i>Blisse</i> was situate;<br>
 A place pickt out by choice of best aliue,<br>
 That natures worke by art can imitate:<br>
 In which what euer in this worldly state<br>
 Is sweet, and pleasing vnto liuing sense,<br>
 Or that may dayntiest fantasie aggrate,<br>
 Was poured forth with plentifull dispence,<br>
 And made there to abound with lauish affluence.</p><p>
  
 Goodly it was enclosed round about,<br>
 Aswell their entred guestes to keepe within,<br>
 As those vnruly beasts to hold without;<br>
 Yet was the fence thereof but weake and thin;<br>
 Nought feard their force, that fortilage to win,<br>
 But wisedomes powre, and temperaunces might,<br>
 By which the mightiest things efforced bin:<br>
 And eke the gate was wrought of substaunce light,<br>
 Rather for pleasure, then for battery or fight.</p><p>
  
 Yt framed was of precious yuory,<br>
 That seemd a worke of admirable wit;<br>
 And therein all the famous history<br>
 Of <i>Iason</i> and <i>Medæa</i> was ywrit;<br>
 Her mighty charmes, her furious louing fit,<br>
 His goodly conquest of the golden fleece,<br>
 His falsed faith, and loue too lightly flit,<br>
 The wondred <i>Argo</i>, which in venturous peece<br>
 First through the <i>Euxine</i> seas bore all the flowr of 
 <i>Greece</i>.</p><p>
  
 Ye might haue seene the frothy billowes fry<br>
 Vnder the ship, as thorough them she went,<br>
 That seemd the waues were into yuory,<br>
 Or yuory into the waues were sent;<br>
 And other where the snowy substaunce sprent<br>
 With vermell, like the boyes bloud therein shed,<br>
 A piteous spectacle did represent,<br>
 And otherwhiles with gold besprinkeled;<br>
 Yt seemd th'enchaunted flame, which did <i>Creüsa</i> wed.</p><p>
  
 All this, and more might in that goodly gate<br>
 Be red; that euer open stood to all,<br>
 Which thither came: but in the Porch there sate<br>
 A comely personage of stature tall,<br>
 And semblaunce pleasing, more then naturall,<br>
 That trauellers to him seemd to entize;<br>
 His looser garment to the ground did fall,<br>
 And flew about his heeles in wanton wize,<br>
 Not fit for speedy pace, or manly exercize.</p><p>
  
 They in that place him <i>Genius</i> did call:<br>
 Not that celestiall powre, to whom the care<br>
 Of life, and generation of all<br>
 That liues, pertaines in charge particulare,<br>
 Who wondrous things concerning our welfare,<br>
 And straunge phantomes doth let vs oft forsee,<br>
 And oft of secret ill bids vs beware:<br>
 That is our Selfe, whom though we do not see,<br>
 Yet each doth in him selfe it well perceiue to bee.</p><p>
  
 Therefore a God him sage Antiquity<br>
 Did wisely make, and good <i>Agdistes</i> call:<br>
 But this same was to that quite contrary,<br>
 The foe of life, that good enuyes to all,<br>
 That secretly doth vs procure to fall,<br>
 Through guilefull semblaunts, which he makes vs see.<br>
 He of this Gardin had the gouernall,<br>
 And Pleasures porter was deuizd to bee,<br>
 Holding a staffe in hand for more formalitee.</p><p>
  
 With diuerse flowres he daintily was deckt,<br>
 And strowed round about, and by his side<br>
 A mighty Mazer bowle of wine was set,<br>
 As if it had to him bene sacrifide;<br>
 Wherewith all new-come guests he gratifide:<br>
 So did he eke Sir <i>Guyon</i> passing by:<br>
 But he his idle curtesie defide,<br>
 And ouerthrew his bowle disdainfully;<br>
 And broke his staffe, with which he charmed semblants sly.</p><p>
  
 Thus being entred, they behold around<br>
 A large and spacious plaine, on euery side<br>
 Strowed with pleasauns, whose faire grassy ground<br>
 Mantled with greene, and goodly beautifide<br>
 With all the ornaments of <i>Floraes</i> pride,<br>
 Wherewith her mother Art, as halfe in scorne<br>
 Of niggard Nature, like a pompous bride<br>
 Did decke her, and too lauishly adorne,<br>
 When forth from virgin bowre she comes in th'early morne.</p><p>
  
 Thereto the Heauens alwayes Iouiall,<br>
 Lookt on them louely, still in stedfast state,<br>
 Ne suffred storme nor frost on them to fall,<br>
 Their tender buds or leaues to violate,<br>
 Nor scorching heat, nor cold intemperate<br>
 T'afflict the creatures, which therein did dwell,<br>
 But the milde air with season moderate<br>
 Gently attempred, and disposd so well,<br>
 That still it breathed forth sweet spirit &amp; holesome smell.</p><p>
  
 More sweet and holesome, then the pleasaunt hill<br>
 Of <i>Rhodope</i>, on which the Nimphe, that bore<br>
 A gyaunt babe, her selfe for griefe did kill;<br>
 Or the Thessalian <i>Tempe</i>, where of yore<br>
 Faire <i>Daphne Phoebus</i> hart with loue did gore;<br>
 Or <i>Ida</i>, where the Gods lou'd to repaire,<br>
 When euer they their heauenly bowres forlore;<br>
 Or sweet <i>Parnasse</i>, the haunt of Muses faire;<br>
 Or <i>Eden</i> selfe, if ought with <i>Eden</i> mote compaire.</p><p>
  
 Much wondred <i>Guyon</i> at the faire aspect<br>
 Of that sweet place, yet suffred no delight<br>
 To sincke into his sence, nor mind affect,<br>
 But passed forth, and lookt still forward right,<br>
 Bridling his will, and maistering his might:<br>
 Till that he came vnto another gate,<br>
 No gate, but like one, being goodly dight<br>
 With boughes and braunches, which did broad dilate<br>
 Their clasping armes, in wanton wreathings intricate.</p><p>
  
 So fashioned a Porch with rare deuice,<br>
 Archt ouer head with an embracing vine,<br>
 Whose bounches hanging downe, seemed to entice<br>
 All passers by, to tast their lushious wine,<br>
 And did themselues into their hands incline,<br>
 As freely offering to be gathered:<br>
 Some deepe empurpled as the <i>Hyacint</i>,<br>
 Some as the Rubine, laughing sweetly red,<br>
 Some like faire Emeraudes, not yet well ripened.</p><p>
  
 And them amongst, some were of burnisht gold,<br>
 So made by art, to beautifie the rest,<br>
 Which did themselues emongst the leaues enfold,<br>
 As lurking from the vew of couetous guest,<br>
 That the weake bowes, with so rich load opprest,<br>
 Did bow adowne, as ouer-burdened.<br>
 Vnder that Porch a comely dame did rest,<br>
 Clad in faire weedes, but fowle disordered,<br>
 And garments loose, that seemd vnmeet for womanhed.</p><p>
  
 In her left hand a Cup of gold she held,<br>
 And with her right the riper fruit did reach,<br>
 Whose sappy liquor, that with fulnesse sweld,<br>
 Into her cup she scruzd, with daintie breach<br>
 Of her fine fingers, without fowle empeach,<br>
 That so faire wine-presse made the wine more sweet:<br>
 Thereof she vsd to giue to drinke to each,<br>
 Whom passing by she happened to meet:<br>
 It was her guise, all Straungers goodly so to greet.</p><p>
  
 So she to <i>Guyon</i> offred it to tast;<br>
 Who taking it out of her tender hond,<br>
 The cup to ground did violently cast,<br>
 That all in peeces it was broken fond,<br>
 And with the liquor stained all the lond:<br>
 Whereat <i>Excesse</i> exceedingly was wroth,<br>
 Yet no'te the same amend, ne yet withstond,<br>
 But suffered him to passe, all were she loth;<br>
 Who nought regarding her displeasure forward goth.</p><p>
  
 There the most daintie Paradise on ground,<br>
 It selfe doth offer to his sober eye,<br>
 In which all pleasures plenteously abound,<br>
 And none does others happinesse enuye:<br>
 The painted flowres, the trees vpshooting hye,<br>
 The dales for shade, the hilles for breathing space,<br>
 The trembling groues, the Christall running by;<br>
 And that, which all faire workes doth most aggrace,<br>
 The art, which all that wrought, appeared in no place.</p><p>
  
 One would haue thought, (so cunningly, the rude,<br>
 And scorned parts were mingled with the fine,)<br>
 That nature had for wantonesse ensude<br>
 Art, and that Art at nature did repine;<br>
 So striuing each th'other to vndermine,<br>
 Each did the others worke more beautifie;<br>
 So diff'ring both in willes, agreed in fine:<br>
 So all agreed through sweete diuersitie,<br>
 This Gardin to adorne with all varietie.</p><p>
  
 And in the midst of all, a fountaine stood,<br>
 Of richest substaunce, that on earth might bee,<br>
 So pure and shiny, that the siluer flood<br>
 Through euery channell running one might see;<br>
 Most goodly it with curious imageree<br>
 Was ouer-wrought, and shapes of naked boyes,<br>
 Of which some seemd with liuely iollitee,<br>
 To fly about, playing their wanton toyes,<br>
 Whilest others did them selues embay in liquid ioyes.</p><p>
  
 And ouer all, of purest gold was spred,<br>
 A trayle of yuie in his natiue hew:<br>
 For the rich mettall was so coloured,<br>
 That wight, who did not well auis'd it vew,<br>
 Would surely deeme it to be yuie trew:<br>
 Low his lasciuious armes adown did creepe,<br>
 That themselues dipping in the siluer dew,<br>
 Their fleecy flowres they tenderly did steepe,<br>
 Which drops of Christall seemd for wantones to weepe.</p><p>
  
 Infinit streames continually did well<br>
 Out of this fountaine, sweet and faire to see,<br>
 The which into an ample lauer fell,<br>
 And shortly grew to so great quantitie,<br>
 That like a little lake it seemd to bee;<br>
 Whose depth exceeded not three cubits hight,<br>
 That through the waues one might the bottom see,<br>
 All pau'd beneath with Iaspar shining bright,<br>
 That seemd the fountaine in that sea did sayle vpright.</p><p>
  
 And all the margent round about was set,<br>
 With shady Laurell trees, thence to defend<br>
 The sunny beames, which on the billowes bet,<br>
 And those which therein bathed, mote offend.<br>
 As <i>Guyon</i> hapned by the same to wend,<br>
 Two naked Damzelles he therein espyde,<br>
 Which therein bathing, seemed to contend,<br>
 And wrestle wantonly, ne car'd to hyde,<br>
 Their dainty parts from vew of any, which them eyde.</p><p>
  
 Sometimes the one would lift the other quight<br>
 Aboue the waters, and then downe againe<br>
 Her plong, as ouer maistered by might,<br>
 Where both awhile would couered remaine,<br>
 And each the other from to rise restraine;<br>
 The whiles their snowy limbes, as through a vele,<br>
 So through the Christall waues appeared plaine:<br>
 Then suddeinly both would themselues vnhele,<br>
 And th'amarous sweet spoiles to greedy eyes reuele.</p><p>
  
 As that faire Starre, the messenger of morne,<br>
 His deawy face out of the sea doth reare:<br>
 Or as the <i>Cyprian</i> goddesse, newly borne<br>
 Of th'Oceans fruitfull froth, did first appeare:<br>
 Such seemed they, and so their yellow heare<br>
 Christalline humour dropped downe apace.<br>
 Whom such when <i>Guyon</i> saw, he drew him neare,<br>
 And somewhat gan relent his earnest pace,<br>
 His stubborne brest gan secret pleasaunce to embrace.</p><p>
  
 The wanton Maidens him espying, stood<br>
 Gazing a while at his vnwonted guise;<br>
 Then th'one her selfe low ducked in the flood,<br>
 Abasht, that her a straunger did avise:<br>
 But th'other rather higher did arise,<br>
 And her two lilly paps aloft displayd,<br>
 And all, that might his melting hart entise<br>
 To her delights, she vnto him bewrayd:<br>
 The rest hid vnderneath, him more desirous made.</p><p>
  
 With that, the other likewise vp arose,<br>
 And her faire lockes, which formerly were bownd<br>
 Vp in one knot, he low adowne did lose:<br>
 Which flowing long and thick, her cloth'd arownd,<br>
 And th'yuorie in golden mantle gownd:<br>
 So that faire spectacle from him was reft,<br>
 Yet that, which reft it, no lesse faire was fownd:<br>
 So hid in lockes and waues from lookers theft,<br>
 Nought but her louely face she for his looking left.</p><p>
  
 Withall she laughed, and she blusht withall,<br>
 That blushing to her laughter gaue more grace,<br>
 And laughter to her blushing, as did fall:<br>
 Now when they spide the knight to slacke his pace,<br>
 Them to behold, and in his sparkling face<br>
 The secret signes of kindled lust appeare,<br>
 Their wanton meriments they did encreace,<br>
 And to him beckned, to approch more neare,<br>
 And shewd him many sights, that courage cold could reare.</p><p>
  
 On which when gazing him the Palmer saw,<br>
 He much rebukt those wandring eyes of his,<br>
 And counseld well, him forward thence did draw.<br>
 Now are they come nigh to the <i>Bowre of blis</i><br>
 Of her fond fauorites so nam'd amis:<br>
 When thus the Palmer; Now Sir, well auise;<br>
 For here the end of all our trauell is:<br>
 Here wonnes <i>Acrasia</i>, whom we must surprise,<br>
 Else she will slip away, and all our drift despise.</p><p>
  
 Etfsoones they heard a most melodious sound,<br>
 Of all that mote delight a daintie eare,<br>
 Such as attonce might not on liuing ground,<br>
 Saue in this Paradise, be heard elswhere:<br>
 Right hard it was, for wight, which did it heare,<br>
 To read, what manner musicke that mote bee:<br>
 For all that pleasing is to liuing eare,<br>
 Was there consorted in one harmonee,<br>
 Birdes, voyces, instruments, windes, waters, all agree.</p><p>
  
 The ioyous birdes shrouded in chearefull shade,<br>
 Their notes vnto the voyce attempred sweet;<br>
 Th'Angelicall soft trembling voyces made<br>
 To th'instruments diuine respondence meet:<br>
 The siluer sounding instruments did meet<br>
 With the base murmure of the waters fall:<br>
 The waters fall with difference discreet,<br>
 Now soft, now loud, vnto the wind did call:<br>
 The gentle warbling wind low answered to all.</p><p>
  
 There, whence that Musick seemed heard to bee,<br>
 Was the faire Witch her selfe now solacing,<br>
 With a new Louer, whom through sorceree<br>
 And witchcraft, she from farre did thither bring:<br>
 There she had him now layd a slombering,<br>
 In secret shade, after long wanton ioyes:<br>
 Whilst round about them pleasauntly did sing<br>
 Many faire Ladies, and lasciuious boyes,<br>
 That euer mixt their song with light licentious toyes.</p><p>
  
 And all that while, right ouer him she hong,<br>
 With her false eyes fast fixed in his sight,<br>
 As seeking medicine, whence she was stong,<br>
 Or greedily depasturing delight:<br>
 And oft inclining downe with kisses light,<br>
 For feare of waking him, his lips bedewd,<br>
 And through his humid eyes did sucke his spright,<br>
 Quite molten into lust and pleasure lewd;<br>
 Wherewith she sighed soft, as if his case she rewd.</p><p>
  
 The whiles some one did chaunt this louely lay;<br>
 Ah see, who so faire thing doest faine to see,<br>
 In springing flowre the image of thy day;<br>
 Ah see the Virgin Rose, how sweetly shee<br>
 Doth first peepe forth with bashfull modestee,<br>
 That fairer seemes, the lesse ye see her may;<br>
 Lo see soone after, how more bold and free<br>
 Her bared bosome she doth broad display;<br>
 Loe see soone after, how she fades, and falles away.</p><p>
  
 So passeth, in the passing of a day,<br>
 Of mortall life the leafe, the bud, the flowre,<br>
 Ne more doth flourish after first decay,<br>
 That earst was sought to decke both bed and bowre,<br>
 Of many a Ladie, and many a Paramowre:<br>
 Gather therefore the Rose, whilest yet is prime,<br>
 For soone comes age, that will her pride deflowre:<br>
 Gather the Rose of love, whilest yet is time,<br>
 Whilest louing thou mayst loued be with equall crime.</p><p>
  
 He ceast, and then gan all the quire of birdes<br>
 Their diuerse notes t'attune vnto his lay,<br>
 As in approuance of his pleasing words.<br>
 The constant paire heard all, that he did say,<br>
 Yet swarued not, but kept their forward way,<br>
 Through many couert groues, and thickets close,<br>
 In which they creeping did at last display<br>
 That wanton Ladie, with her louer lose,<br>
 Whose sleepie head she in her lap did soft dispose.</p><p>
  
 Vpon a bed of Roses she was layd,<br>
 As faint through heat, or dight to pleasant sin,<br>
 And was arayd, or rather disarayd,<br>
 All in a vele of silke and siluer thin,<br>
 That hid no whit her alablaster skin,<br>
 But rather shewd more white, if more might bee:<br>
 More subtile web <i>Arachne</i> can not spin,<br>
 Nor the fine nets, which oft we wouen see<br>
 Of scorched deaw, do not in th'aire more lightly flee.</p><p>
  
 Her snowy brest was bare to readie spoyle<br>
 Of hungry eies, which n'ote therewith be fild,<br>
 And yet through languour of her late sweet toyle,<br>
 Few drops, more cleare then Nectar, forth distild,<br>
 That like pure Orient perles adowne it trild,<br>
 And her faire eyes sweet smyling in delight,<br>
 Moystened their fierie beames, with which she thrild<br>
 Fraile harts, yet quenched not; like starry light<br>
 Which sparckling on the silent waues, does seeme more bright.</p><p>
  
 The young man sleeping by her, seemd to bee<br>
 Some goodly swayne of honorable place,<br>
 That certes it great pittie was to see<br>
 Him his nobilitie so foule deface;<br>
 A sweet regard, and amiable grace,<br>
 Mixed with manly sternnesse did appeare<br>
 Yet sleeping, in his well proportiond face,<br>
 And on his tender lips the downy heare<br>
 Did now but freshly spring, and silken blossomes beare.</p><p>
  
 His warlike armes, the idle instruments<br>
 Of sleeping praise, were hong vpon a tree,<br>
 And his braue shield, full of old moniments,<br>
 Was fowly ra'st, that none the signes might see;<br>
 Ne for them, ne for honour cared hee,<br>
 Ne ought, that did to his aduauncement tend,<br>
 But in lewd loues, and wastfull luxuree,<br>
 His dayes, his goods, his bodie he did spend:<br>
 O horrible enchantment, that him so did blend.</p><p>
  
 The noble Elfe, and carefull Palmer drew<br>
 So nigh them, minding nought, but lustfull game,<br>
 That suddein forth they on them rusht, and threw<br>
 A subtile net, which onely for the same<br>
 The skilfull Palmer formally did frame.<br>
 So held them vnder fast, the whiles the rest<br>
 Fled all away for feare of fowler shame.<br>
 The faire Enchauntresse, so vnwares opprest,<br>
 Tryde all her arts, &amp; all her sleights, thence out to wrest.</p><p>
  
 And eke her louer stroue: but all in vaine;<br>
 For that same net so cunningly was wound,<br>
 That neither guile, nor force might it distraine.<br>
 They tooke them both, &amp; both them strongly bound<br>
 In captiue bandes, which there they readie found:<br>
 But her in chaines of adamant he tyde;<br>
 For nothing else might keepe her safe and sound;<br>
 But <i>Verdant</i> (so he hight) he soone vntyde,<br>
 And counsell sage in steed thereof to him applyde.</p><p>
  
 But all those pleasant bowres and Pallace braue,<br>
 <i>Guyon</i> broke downe, with rigour pittilesse;<br>
 Ne ought their goodly workmanship might saue<br>
 Them from the tempest of his wrathfulnesse,<br>
 But that their blisse he turn'd to balefulnesse:<br>
 Their groues he feld, their gardins did deface,<br>
 Their arbers spoyle, their Cabinets suppresse,<br>
 Their banket houses burne, their buildings race,<br>
 And of the fairest late, now made the fowlest place.</p><p>
  
 Then led they her away, and eke that knight<br>
 They with them led, both sorrowfull and sad:<br>
 The way they came, the same retourn'd they right,<br>
 Till they arriued, where they lately had<br>
 Charm'd those wild-beasts, that rag'd with furie mad.<br>
 Which now awaking, fierce at them gan fly,<br>
 As in their mistresse reskew, whom they lad;<br>
 But them the Palmer soone did pacify.<br>
 Then <i>Guyon</i> askt, what meant those beastes, which there did 
 ly.</p><p>
  
 Said he, These seeming beasts are men indeed,<br>
 Whom this Enchauntresse hath transformed thus,<br>
 Whylome her louers, which her lusts did feed,<br>
 Now turned into figures hideous,<br>
 According to their mindes like monstruous.<br>
 Sad end (quoth he) of life intemperate,<br>
 And mournefull meed of ioyes delicious:<br>
 But Palmer, if it mote thee so aggrate,<br>
 Let them returned be vnto their former state.</p><p>
  
 Streight way he with his vertuous staffe them strooke,<br>        
 And streight of beasts they comely men became;<br>
 Yet being men they did vnmanly looke,<br>
 And stared ghastly, some for inward shame,<br>
 And some for wrath, to see their captiue Dame:<br>
 But one aboue the rest in speciall,<br>
 That had an hog beene late, hight <i>Grille</i> by name,<br>
 Repined greatly, and did him miscall,<br>
 That had from hoggish forme him brought to naturall.</p><p>
  
 Said <i>Guyon</i>, See the mind of beastly man,<br>
 That hath so soone forgot the excellence<br>
 Of his creation, when he life began,<br>
 That now he chooseth, with vile difference,<br>
 To be a beast, and lacke intelligence.<br>
 To whom the Palmer thus, The donghill kind<br>
 Delights in filth and foule incontinence:<br>
 Let <i>Grill</i> be <i>Grill</i>, and haue his hoggish mind,<br>
 But let vs hence depart, whilest wether serues and wind.</p><p>
