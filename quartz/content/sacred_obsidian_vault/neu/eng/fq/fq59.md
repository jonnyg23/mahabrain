 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Britomart comes to Isis Church,<br>
 Where shee strange visions sees:<br>
 She fights with Radigund, her slaies,<br>
 And Artegall thence frees.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 N
 Ought is on earth more sacred or diuine,<br>
 That Gods and men doe equally adore,<br>
 Then this same vertue, that doth right define:<br>
 For th'heuens thẽselues, whence mortal men implore<br>
 Right in their wrongs, are rul'd by righteous lore<br>
 Of highest Ioue, who doth true iustice deale<br>
 To his inferiour Gods, and euermore<br>
 Therewith containes his heauenly Common-weale,<br>
 The skill whereof to Princes hearts he doth reueale.<p>
 
 Well therefore did the antique world inuent,<br>
 That Iustice was a God of soueraine grace,<br>
 And altars vnto him, and temples lent,<br>
 And heauenly honours in the highest place;<br>
 Calling him great <i>Osyris</i>, of the race<br>
 Of th'old Ægyptian Kings, that whylome were;<br>
 With fayned colours shading a true case:<br>
 For that <i>Osyris</i>, whilest he liued here,<br>
 The iustest man aliue, and truest did appeare.</p><p>
 
 His wife was <i>Isis</i>, whom they likewise made<br>
 A Goddesse of great powre and souerainty<br>
 And in her person cunningly did shade<br>
 That part of Iustice, which is Equity,<br>
 Whereof I haue to treat here presently.<br>
 Vnto whose temple when as <i>Britomart</i><br>
 Arriued, shee with great humility<br>
 Did enter in, ne would that night depart;<br>
 But <i>Talus</i> mote not be admitted to her part.</p><p>
 
 There she receiued was in goodly wize<br>
 Of many Priests, which duely did attend<br>
 Vppon the rites and daily sacrifize,<br>
 All clad in linnen robes with siluer hemd;<br>
 And on their heads with long locks comely kemd,<br>
 They wore rich Mitres shaped like the Moone,<br>
 To shew that <i>Isis</i> doth the Moone portend;<br>
 Like as <i>Osyris</i> signifies the Sunne.<br>
 For that they both like race in equall iustice runne.</p><p>
 
 The Championesse them greeting, as she could,<br>
 Was thence by them into the Temple led;<br>
 Whose goodly building when she did behould,<br>
 Borne vppon stately pillours, all dispred<br>
 With shining gold, and arched ouer hed,<br>
 She wondred at the workemans passing skill,<br>
 Whose like before she neuer saw nor red;<br>
 And thereuppon long while stood gazing still,<br>
 But thought, that she thereon could neuer gaze her fill.</p><p>
 
 Thence forth vnto the Idoll they her brought,<br>
 The which was framed all of siluer fine,<br>
 So well as could with cunning hand be wrought,<br>
 And clothed all in garments made of line,<br>
 Hemd all about with fringe of siluer twine.<br>
 Vppon her head she wore a Crowne of gold,<br>
 To shew that she had powre in things diuine;<br>
 And at her feete a Crocodile was rold,<br>
 That with her wreathed taile her middle did enfold.</p><p>
 
 One foote was set vppon the Crocodile,<br>
 And on the ground the other fast did stand,<br>
 So meaning to suppresse both forged guile,<br>
 And open force: and in her other hand<br>
 She stretched forth a long white sclender wand.<br>
 Such was the Goddesse; whom when <i>Britomart</i><br>
 Had long beheld, her selfe vppon the land<br>
 She did prostrate, and with right humble hart,<br>
 Vnto her selfe her silent prayers did impart.</p><p>
 
 To which the Idoll as it were inclining,<br>
 Her wand did moue with amiable looke,<br>
 By outward shew her inward sence defining.<br>
 Who well perceiuing, how her wand she shooke,<br>
 It as a token of good fortune tooke.<br>
 By this the day with dampe was ouercast,<br>
 And ioyous light the house of <i>Ioue</i> forsooke:<br>
 Which when she saw, her helmet she vnlaste,<br>
 And by the altars side her selfe to slumber plaste.</p><p>
 
 For other beds the Priests there vsed none,<br>
 But on their mother Earths deare lap did lie,<br>
 And bake their sides vppon the cold hard stone,<br>
 T'enure them selues to sufferaunce thereby<br>
 And proud rebellious flesh to mortify.<br>
 For by the vow of their religion<br>
 They tied were to stedfast chastity,<br>
 And continence of life, that all forgon,<br>
 They mote the better tend to their deuotion.</p><p>
 
 Therefore they mote not taste of fleshly food,<br>
 Ne feed on ought, the which doth bloud containe,<br>
 Ne drinke of wine, for wine they say is blood,<br>
 Euen the bloud of Gyants, which were slaine,<br>
 By thundring Ioue in the Phlegrean plaine.<br>
 For which the earth (as they the story tell)<br>
 Wroth with the Gods, which to perpetuall paine<br>
 Had damn'd her sonnes, which gainst them did rebell,<br>
 With inward griefe and malice did against them swell.</p><p>
 
 And of their vitall bloud, the which was shed<br>
 Into her pregnant bosome, forth she brought<br>
 The fruitfull vine, whose liquor blouddy red<br>
 Hauing the mindes of men with fury fraught,<br>
 Mote in them stirre vp old rebellious thought,<br>
 To make new warre against the Gods againe:<br>
 Such is the powre of that same fruit, that nought<br>
 The fell contagion may thereof restraine,<br>
 Ne within reasons rule, her madding mood containe.</p><p>
 
 There did the warlike Maide her selfe repose,<br>
 Vnder the wings of <i>Isis</i> all that night,<br>
 And with sweete rest her heauy eyes did close,<br>
 After that long daies toile and weary plight.<br>
 Where whilest her earthly parts with soft delight<br>
 Of sencelesse sleepe did deeply drowned lie,<br>
 There did appeare vnto her heauenly spright<br>
 A wondrous vision, which did close implie<br>
 The course of all her fortune and posteritie.</p><p>
 
 Her seem'd, as she was doing sacrifize<br>
 To <i>Isis</i>, deckt with Mitre on her hed,<br>
 And linnen stole after those Priestes guize,<br>
 All sodainely she saw transfigured<br>
 Her linnen stole to robe of scarlet red,<br>
 And Moone-like Mitre to a Crowne of gold,<br>
 That euen she her selfe much wondered<br>
 At such a chaunge, and ioyed to behold<br>
 Her selfe, adorn'd with gems and iewels manifold.</p><p>
 
 And in the midst of her felicity,<br>
 An hideous tempest seemed from below,<br>
 To rise through all the Temple sodainely,<br>
 That from the Altar all about did blow<br>
 The holy fire, and all the embers strow<br>
 Vppon the ground, which kindled priuily,<br>
 Into outragious flames vnwares did grow,<br>
 That all the Temple put in ieopardy<br>
 Of flaming, and her selfe in great perplexity.</p><p>
 
 With that the Crocodile, which sleeping lay<br>
 Vnder the Idols feete in fearelesse bowre,<br>
 Seem'd to awake in horrible dismay,<br>
 As being troubled with that stormy stowre;<br>
 And gaping greedy wide, did streight deuoure<br>
 Both flames and tempest: with which growen great,<br>
 And swolne with pride of his owne peerelesse powre,<br>
 He gan to threaten her likewise to eat;<br>
 But that the Goddesse with her rod him backe did beat.</p><p>
 
 Tho turning all his pride to humblesse meeke,<br>
 Him selfe before her feete he lowly threw,<br>
 And gan for grace and loue of her to seeke:<br>
 Which she accepting, he so neare her drew,<br>
 That of his game she soone enwombed grew,<br>
 And forth did bring a Lion of great might;<br>
 That shortly did all other beasts subdew.<br>
 With that she waked, full of fearefull fright,<br>
 And doubtfully dismayd through that so vncouth sight.</p><p>
 
 So thereuppon long while she musing lay,<br>
 With thousand thoughts feeding her fantasie,<br>
 Vntill she spide the lampe of lightsome day,<br>
 Vp-lifted in the porch of heauen hie.<br>
 Then vp she rose fraught with melancholy,<br>
 And forth into the lower parts did pas;<br>
 Whereas the Priestes she found full busily<br>
 About their holy things for morrow Mas:<br>
 Whom she saluting faire, faire resaluted was.</p><p>
 
 But by the change of her vnchearefull looke,<br>
 They might perceiue, she was not well in plight;<br>
 Or that some pensiuenesse to heart she tooke.<br>
 Therefore thus one of them, who seem'd in sight<br>
 To be the greatest, and the grauest wight,<br>
 To her bespake; Sir Knight it seemes to me,<br>
 That thorough euill rest of this last night,<br>
 Or ill apayd, or much dismayd ye be,<br>
 That by your change of cheare is easie for to see.</p><p>
 
 Certes (sayd she) sith ye so well haue spide<br>
 The troublous passion of my pensiue mind,<br>
 I will not seeke the same from you to hide,<br>
 But will my cares vnfolde, in hope to find<br>
 Your aide, to guide me out of errour blind.<br>
 Say on (quoth he) the secret of your hart:<br>
 For by the holy vow, which me doth bind,<br>
 I am adiur'd, best counsell to impart<br>
 To all, that shall require my comfort in their smart.</p><p>
 
 Then gan she to declare the whole discourse<br>
 Of all that vision, which to her appeard,<br>
 As well as to her minde it had recourse.<br>
 All which when he vnto the end had heard,<br>
 Like to a weake faint-hearted man he fared,<br>
 Through great astonishment of that strange sight;<br>
 And with long locks vp-standing, stifly stared<br>
 Like one adawed with some dreadfull spright.<br>
 So fild with heauenly fury, thus he her behight.</p><p>
 
 Magnificke Virgin, that in queint disguise<br>
 Of British armes doest maske thy royall blood,<br>
 So to pursue a perillous emprize,<br>
 How coul[d]st thou weene, through that disguized hood,<br>
 To hide thy state from being vnderstood?<br>
 Can from th'immortall Gods ought hidden bee?<br>
 They doe thy linage, and thy Lordly brood;<br>
 They doe thy sire, lamenting sore for thee;<br>
 They doe thy loue, forlorne in womens thraldome see.</p><p>
 
 The end whereof, and all the long euent,<br>
 They doe to thee in this same dreame discouer.<br>
 For that same Crocodile doth represent<br>
 The righteous Knight, that is thy faithfull louer.<br>
 Like to <i>Osyris</i> in all iust endeuer.<br>
 For that same Crocodile <i>Osyris</i> is,<br>
 That vnder <i>Isis</i> feete doth sleepe for euer:<br>
 To shew that clemence oft in things amis,<br>
 Restraines those sterne behests, and cruell doomes of his.</p><p>
 
 That Knight shall all the troublous stormes asswage,<br>
 And raging flames, that many foes shall reare,<br>
 To hinder thee from the iust heritage<br>
 Of thy sires Crowne, and from thy countrey deare.<br>
 Then shalt thou take him to thy loued fere,<br>
 And ioyne in equall portion of thy realme:<br>
 And afterwards a sonne to him shalt beare,<br>
 That Lion-like shall shew his powre extreame.<br>
 So blesse thee God, and giue thee ioyance of thy dreame</p><p>
 
 All which when she vnto the end had heard,<br>
 She much was eased in her troublous thought,<br>
 And on those Priests bestowed rich reward:<br>
 And royall gifts of gold and siluer wrought,<br>
 She for a present to their Goddesse brought.<br>
 Then taking leaue of them, she forward went,<br>
 To seeke her loue, where he was to be sought;<br>
 Ne rested till she cam without relent<br>
 Vnto the land of Amazons, as she was bent.</p><p>
 
 Whereof when newes to <i>Radigund</i> was brought,<br>
 Not with amaze, as women wonted bee,<br>
 She was confused in her troublous thought,<br>
 But fild with courage and with ioyous glee,<br>
 As glad to heare of armes, the which now she<br>
 Had long surceast, she bad to open bold,<br>
 That she the face of her new foe might see.<br>
 But when they of that yron man had told,<br>
 Which late her folke had slaine, she bad thẽ forth to hold.</p><p>
 
 So there without the gate (as seemed best)<br>
 She caused her Pauilion be pight;<br>
 In which stout <i>Britomart</i> her selfe did rest,<br>
 Whiles <i>Talus</i> watched at the dore all night.<br>
 All night likewise, they of the towne in fright,<br>
 Vppon their wall good watch and ward did keepe.<br>
 The morrow next, so soone as dawning light<br>
 Bad doe away the dampe of drouzie sleepe,<br>
 The warlike Amazon out of her bowre did peepe.</p><p>
 
 And caused streight a Trumpet loud to shrill,<br>
 To warne her foe to battell soone be prest:<br>
 Who long before awoke (for she ful ill<br>
 Could sleepe all night, that in vnquiet brest<br>
 Did closely harbour such a iealous guest)<br>
 Was to the battell whilome ready dight.<br>
 Eftsoones that warriouresse with haughty crest<br>
 Did forth issue, all ready for the fight:<br>
 On th'other side her foe appeared soone in sight.</p><p>
 
 But ere they reared hand, the Amazone<br>
 Began the streight conditions to propound,<br>
 With which she vsed still to tye her fone;<br>
 To serue her so, as she the rest had bound.<br>
 Which when the other heard, she sternly frownd<br>
 For high disdaine of such indignity,<br>
 And would no lenger treat, but bad them sound.<br>
 For her no other termes should euer tie<br>
 Then what prescribed were by lawes of cheualrie.</p><p>
 
 The Trumpets sound, and they together run<br>
 With greedy rage, and with their faulchins smot;<br>
 Ne either sought the others strokes to shun,<br>
 But through great fury both their skill forgot,<br>
 And practicke vse in armes: ne spared not<br>
 Their dainty parts, which nature had created<br>
 So faire and tender, without staine or spot,<br>
 For other vses, then they them translated;<br>
 Which they now hackt &amp; hewd, as if such vse they hated,</p><p>
 
 As when a Tygre and a Lionesse<br>
 Are met at spoyling of some hungry pray,<br>
 Both challenge it with equall greedinesse:<br>
 But first the Tygre clawes thereon did lay;<br>
 And therefore loth to loose her right away,<br>
 Doth in defence thereof full stoutly stond:<br>
 To which the Lion strongly doth gainesay,<br>
 That she to hunt the beast first tooke in hond;<br>
 And therefore ought it haue, where euer she it fond.</p><p>
 
 Full fiercely layde the Amazon about,<br>
 And dealt her blowes vnmercifully sore:<br>
 Which <i>Britomart</i> withstood with courage stout,<br>
 And them repaide againe with double more.<br>
 So long they fought, that all the grassie flore<br>
 Was fild with bloud, which from their sides did flow,<br>
 And gushed through their armes, that all in gore<br>
 They trode, and on the ground their liues did strow,<br>
 Like fruitles seede, of which vntimely death should grow.</p><p>
 
 At last proud <i>Radigund</i> with fell despight,<br>
 Hauing by chaunce espide aduantage neare,<br>
 Let driue at her with all her dreadfull might,<br>
 And thus vpbrayding sayd; This token beare<br>
 Vnto the man, whom thou doest loue so deare;<br>
 And tell him for his sake thy life thou gauest.<br>
 Which spitefull words she sore engrieu'd to heare,<br>
 Thus answer'd; Lewdly thou my loue deprauest,<br>
 Who shortly must repent that now so vainely brauest.</p><p>
 
 Nath'lesse that stroke so cruell passage found,<br>
 That glauncing on her shoulder plate, it bit<br>
 Vnto the bone, and made a griesly wound,<br>
 That she her shield through raging smart of it<br>
 Could scarse vphold; yet soone she it requit.<br>
 For hauing force increast through furious paine,<br>
 She her so rudely on the helmet smit,<br>
 That it empierced to the very braine,<br>
 And her proud person low prostrated on the plaine.</p><p>
 
 Where being layd, the wrothfull Britonesse<br>
 Stayd not, till she came to her selfe againe,<br>
 But in reuenge both of her loues distresse,<br>
 And her late vile reproch, though vaunted vaine,<br>
 And also of her wound, which sore did paine,<br>
 She with one stroke both head and helmet cleft.<br>
 Which dreadfull sight, when all her warlike traine<br>
 There present saw, each one of sence bereft,<br>
 Fled fast into the towne, and her sole victor left.</p><p>
 
 But yet so fast they could not home retrate,<br>
 But that swift <i>Talus</i> did the formost win;<br>
 And pressing through the preace vnto the gate,<br>
 Pelmell with them attonce did enter in.<br>
 There then a piteous slaughter did begin:<br>
 For all that euer came within his reach,<br>
 He with his yron flale did thresh so thin,<br>
 That he no worke at all left for the leach:<br>
 Like to an hideous storme, which nothing may empeach.</p><p>
 
 And now by this the noble Conqueresse<br>
 Her selfe came in, her glory to partake;<br>
 Where though reuengefull vow she did professe,<br>
 Yet when she saw the heapes, which he did make,<br>
 Of slaughtred carkasses, her heart did quake<br>
 For very ruth, which did it almost riue,<br>
 That she his fury willed him to slake:<br>
 For else he sure had left not one aliue,<br>
 But all in his reuenge of spirite would depriue.</p><p>
 
 Tho when she had his execution stayd,<br>
 She for that yron prison did enquire,<br>
 In which her wretched loue was captiue layd:<br>
 Which breaking open with indignant ire,<br>
 She entred into all the partes entire.<br>
 Where when she saw that lothly vncouth sight,<br>
 Of men disguiz'd in womanishe attire,<br>
 Her heart gan grudge, for very deepe despight<br>
 Of so vnmanly maske, in misery misdight.</p><p>
 
 At last when as to her owne Loue she came,<br>
 Whom like disguize no lesse deformed had,<br>
 At sight thereof abasht with secrete shame,<br>
 She turnd her head aside, as nothing glad,<br>
 To haue beheld a spectacle so bad:<br>
 And then too well beleeu'd, that which tofore<br>
 Iealous suspect as true vntruely drad,<br>
 Which vaine conceipt now nourishing no more,<br>
 She sought with ruth to salue his sad misfortunes sore.</p><p>
 
 Not so great wonder and astonishment,<br>
 Did the most chast <i>Penelope</i> possesse,<br>
 To see her Lord, that was reported drent,<br>
 And dead long since in dolorous distresse,<br>
 Come home to her in piteous wretchednesse,<br>
 After long trauell of full twenty yeares,<br>
 That she knew not his fauours likelynesse,<br>
 For many scarres and many hoary heares,<br>
 But stood long staring on him, mongst vncertaine feares.</p><p>
 
 Ah my deare Lord, what sight is this (quoth she)<br>
 What May-game hath misfortune made of you?<br>
 Where is that dreadfull manly looke? where be<br>
 Those mighty palmes, the which ye wont t'embrew<br>
 In bloud of Kings, and great hoastes to subdew?<br>
 Could ought on earth so wondrous change haue wrought,<br>
 As to haue robde you of that manly hew?<br>
 Could so great courage stouped haue to ought?<br>
 Then farewell fleshly force; I see thy pride is nought.</p><p>
 
 Thenceforth she streight into a bowre him brought,<br>
 And causd him those vncomely weedes vndight;<br>
 And in their steede for other rayment sought,<br>
 Whereof there was great store, and armors bright,<br>
 Which had bene reft from many a noble Knight;<br>
 Whom that proud Amazon subdewed had,<br>
 Whilest Fortune fauourd her successe in fight,<br>
 In which when as she him anew had clad,<br>
 She was reuiu'd, and ioyd much in his semblance glad.</p><p>
 
 So there a while they afterwards remained,<br>
 Him to refresh, and her late wounds to heale:<br>
 During which space she there as Princess rained,<br>
 And changing all that forme of common weale,<br>
 The liberty of women did repeale,<br>
 Which they had long vsurpt; and them restoring<br>
 To mens subiection, did true Iustice deale:<br>
 That all they as a Goddesse her adoring,<br>
 Her wisedome did admire, and hearkned to her loring.</p><p>
 
 For all those Knights, which long in captiue shade<br>
 Had shrowded bene, she did from thraldome free;<br>
 And magistrates of all that city made,<br>
 And gaue to them great liuing and large fee:<br>
 And that they should for euer faithfull bee,<br>
 Made them sweare fealty to <i>Artegall</i>.<br>
 Who when him selfe now well recur'd did see,<br>
 He purposd to proceed, what so be fall,<br>
 Vppon his first aduenture, which him forth did call.</p><p>
 
 Full sad and sorrowfull was <i>Britomart</i><br>
 For his departure, her new cause of griefe;<br>
 Yet wisely moderated her owne smart,<br>
 Seeing his honor, which she tendred chiefe,<br>
 Consisted much in that aduentures priefe.<br>
 The care whereof, and hope of his successe<br>
 Gaue vnto her great comfort and reliefe,<br>
 That womanish complaints she did represse,<br>
 And tempred for the time her present heauinesse.</p><p>
 
 There she continu'd for a certaine space,<br>
 Till through his want her woe did more increase:<br>
 Then hoping that the change of aire and place<br>
 Would change her paine, and sorrow somewhat ease,<br>
 She parted thence, her anguish to appease.<br>
 Meane while her noble Lord sir <i>Artegall</i><br>
 Went on his way, ne euer howre did cease,<br>
 Till he redeemed had that Lady thrall:<br>
 That for another Canto will more fitly fall.</p><p>
