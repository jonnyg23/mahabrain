 <p>A Vision vpon this
 conceipt of the
 <i>Faery Queene.</i></p></center>
 
 <blockquote>ME
 thought I saw the graue where <i>Laura</i> lay
 <br>Within that Temple, where the vestall
 flame
 <br>Was wont to burne, and passing by
 that way,
 <br>To see that buried dust of liuing
 fame,
 <br>Whose tombe faire loue, and fairer
 vertue kept,
 <br>All suddenly I saw the Faery Queene:
 <br>At whose approch the soule of <i>Petrarke</i>
 wept,
 <br>And from thenceforth those graces
 were not seene.
 <br>For they this Queene attended, in
 whose steed
 <br>Obliuion laid him downe on <i>Lauras</i>
 herse:
 <br>Hereat the hardest stones were seene
 to bleed,
 <br>And grones of buried ghostes the
 heuens did perse.
 <br>Where <i>Homers</i> spright did
 tremble all for griefe,
 <br>And curst th'accesse of that celestiall
 theife.

 <blockquote><i>THe
 prayse of meaner wits this worke like profit brings,</i>
 <br><i>As doth the Cuckoes song delight
 when Philumena sings.</i>
 <br><i>If thou hast formed right true
 vertues face herein:</i>
 <br><i>Vertue her selfe can best discerne,
 to whom they writen bin.</i>
 <br><i>If thou hast beauty praysd, let
 her sole looks diuine</i>
 <br><i>Iudge if ought therein be amis,
 and mend it by her meine.</i>
 <br><i>If Chastitie want ought, or Temperaunce
 her dew,</i>
 <br><i>Behold her Princely mind aright,
 and write thy Queene anew.</i>
 <br><i>Meane while she shall perceiue,
 how far her vertues sore</i>
 <br><i>Aboue the reach of all that liue,
 or such as wrote of yore:</i>
 <br><i>And thereby will excuse and fauour
 thy good will:</i>
 <br><i>Whose vertue can not be exprest,
 but by an Angels quill.</i>
 <br><i>Of me no lines are lou'd, nor
 letters are of price,</i>
 <br><i>Of all which speak our English
 tongue, but those of thy deuice.</i></blockquote>

 <br><i>Those trustie mates, that loued
 thee so well,</i>

 gaue thee the bell.</i>

 <br><i>So moughtst thou now in these

 <br><i>delight the daintie eares of
 higher powers.</i>
 <br><i>And so mought they in their deepe
 skanning skill</i>
 <br><i>Alow and grace our Collyns flowing
 quill.</i>
 </p><p><i> And fare befall that </i>Faery

 <br><i>in whose faire eyes loue linckt

 </p><p><i> But (iolly Shepheard) though

 <br><i>thou feast the humour of the

 <br><i>Let not conceipt thy setled sence
 beguile,</i>
 <br><i>ne daunted be through enuy or

 <br><i>Subiect thy dome to her Empyring

 disguisde.
 <br>But this deuise <i>Vlysses</i> soone
 did spy,
 <br>And brought him forth, the chaunce
 of warre to try.
 <p> When <i>Spencer</i> saw the
 fame was spredd so large
 <br>Through Faery land of their renowned
 Queene:
 <br>Loth that his Muse should take so
 great a charge,
 <br>As in such haughty matter to be
 seene,
 <br>To seeme a Shepeheard then he made
 his choice,
 <br>But <i>Sidney</i> heard him sing,
 and knew his voice.
 </p><p> And as <i>Vlysses</i> brought
 faire <i>Thetis</i> sonne
 <br>From his retyred life to menage
 armes:
 <br>So <i>Spencer</i> was by <i>Sidneys</i>
 speaches wonne,
 <br>To blaze her fame not fearing future
 harmes:
 <br>For well he knew, his Muse would
 soone be tyred
 <br>In her high praise, that all the
 world admired.
 </p><p> Yet as <i>Achilles</i> in those
 warlike frayes,
 <br>Did win the palme from all the <i>Grecian</i>
 Peeres:
 <br>So <i>Spencer</i> now to his immortall

 <blockquote>REdoubted
 Lord, in whose corageous mind
 <br>The flowre of cheualry now bloosming
 faire,
 <br>Doth promise fruite worthy the noble
 kind
 <br>Which of their praises haue left
 you the haire;
 <br>To you this humble present I prepare,
 <br>For loue of vertue and of Martiall
 praise;
 <br>To which though nobly ye inclined
 are,
 <br>As goodlie well ye shew'd in late
 assaies,
 <br>Yet braue ensample of long passed
 daies,
 <br>In which trew honor ye may fashioned
 see,
 <br>To like desire of honor may ye raise,
 <br>And fill your mind with magnanimitee.
 <br>Receiue it, Lord, therefore, as
 it was ment,
 <br>For honor of your name and high
 descent.</blockquote>
