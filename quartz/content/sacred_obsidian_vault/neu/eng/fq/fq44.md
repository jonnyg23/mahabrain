 <i>The Ladies for the Girdle striue<br>
 of famous Florimell:<br>
 Scudamour comming to Cares house,<br>
 doth sleepe from him expell.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 I
 T hath bene through all ages euer seene,<br>
 That with the praise of armes and cheualrie,<br>
 The prize of beautie still hath ioyned beene;<br>
 And that for reasons speciall priuitie:<br>
 For either doth on other much relie.<br>
 For he me seemes most fit the faire to serue,<br>
 That can her best defend from villenie;<br>
 And she most fit his seruice doth deserue,<br>
 That fairest is and from her faith will neuer swerue.<p>
 
 So fitly now here commeth next in place,<br>
 After the proofe of prowesse ended well,<br>
 The controuerse of beauties soueraine grace;<br>
 In which to her that doth the most excell,<br>
 Shall fall the girdle of faire <i>Florimell</i>:<br>
 That many wish to win for glorie vaine,<br>
 And not for vertuous vse, which some doe tell<br>
 That glorious belt did in it selfe containe,<br>
 Which Ladies ought to loue, and seeke for to obtaine.</p><p>
 
 That girdle gaue the vertue of chast loue,<br>
 And wiuehood true, to all that did it beare;<br>
 But whosoeuer contrarie doth proue,<br>
 Might not the same about her middle weare.<br>
 But it would loose, or else a sunder teare.<br>
 Whilome it was (as Faeries wont report)<br>
 Dame <i>Venus</i> girdle, by her steemed deare,<br>
 What time she vsd to liue in wiuely sort;<br>
 But layd aside, when so she vsd her looser sport.</p><p>
 
 Her husband <i>Vulcan</i> whylome for her sake,<br>
 When first he loued her with heart entire,<br>
 This pretious ornament they say did make,<br>
 And wrought in <i>Lemno</i> with vnquenched fire:<br>
 And afterwards did for her loues first hire,<br>
 Giue it to her, for euer to remaine,<br>
 Therewith to bind lasciuious desire,<br>
 And loose affections streightly to restraine;<br>
 Which vertue it for euer after did retaine.</p><p>
 
 The same one day, when she her selfe disposd<br>
 To visite her beloued Paramoure,<br>
 The God of warre, she from her middle loosd,<br>
 And left behind her in her secret bowre,<br>
 On <i>Acidalian</i> mount, where many an howre<br>
 She with the pleasant <i>Graces</i> wont to play.<br>
 There <i>Florimell</i> in her first ages flowre<br>
 Was fostered by those <i>Graces</i>, (as they say)<br>
 And brought with her fro˜ thence that goodly belt away.</p><p>
 
 That goodly belt was <i>Cestus</i> hight by name,<br>
 And as her life by her esteemed deare.<br>
 No wonder then, if that to winne the same<br>
 So many Ladies sought, as shall appeare;<br>
 For pearelesse she was thought, that did it beare.<br>
 And now by this their feast all being ended,<br>
 The iudges which thereto selected were,<br>
 Into the Martian field adowne descended,<br>
 To deeme this doutfull case, for which they all cõtended.</p><p>
 
 But first was question made, which of those Knights<br>
 That lately turneyd, had the wager wonne:<br>
 There was it iudged by those worthie wights,<br>
 That <i>Satyrane</i> the first day best had donne:<br>
 For he last ended, hauing first begonne.<br>
 The second was to <i>Triamond</i> behight,<br>
 For that he sau'd the victour from fordonne:<br>
 For <i>Cambell</i> victour was in all mens sight,<br>
 Till by mishap he in his foemens hand did light.</p><p>
 
 The third dayes prize vnto that straunger Knight,<br>
 Whom all men term'd Knight of the Hebene speare,<br>
 To <i>Britomart</i> was giuen by good right;<br>
 For that with puissant stroke she downe did beare<br>
 The <i>Saluage</i> Knight, that victour was whileare,<br>
 And all the rest, which had the best afore,<br>
 And to the last vnconquer'd did appeare;<br>
 For last is deemed best.  To her therefore<br>
 The fayrest Ladie was adiudgd for Paramore.</p><p>
 
 But thereat greatly grudged <i>Arthegall</i>,<br>
 And much repynd, that both of victors meede,<br>
 And eke of honour she did him forestall.<br>
 Yet mote he not withstand, what was decreede;<br>
 But inly thought of that despightfull deede<br>
 Fit time t'awaite auenged for to bee.<br>
 This being ended thus, and all agreed,<br>
 Then next ensew'd the Paragon to see<br>
 Of beauties praise, and yeeld the fayrest her due fee.</p><p>
 
 Then first <i>Cambello</i> brought vnto their view<br>
 His faire <i>Cambina</i>, couered with a veale;<br>
 Which being once withdrawne, most perfect hew<br>
 And passing beautie did eftsoones reueale,<br>
 That able was weake harts away to steale.<br>
 Next did Sir <i>Triamond</i> vnto their sight<br>
 The face of his deare <i>Canacee</i> vnheale;<br>
 Whose beauties beame eftsoones did shine so bright,<br>
 That daz'd the eyes of all, as with exceeding light.</p><p>
 
 And after her did <i>Paridell</i> produce<br>
 His false <i>Duessa</i>, that she might be seene;<br>
 Who with her forged beautie did seduce<br>
 The hearts of some, that fairest her did weene;<br>
 As diuerse wits affected diuers beene.<br>
 Then did Sir <i>Ferramont</i> vnto them shew<br>
 His <i>Lucida</i>, that was full faire and sheene,<br>
 And after these an hundred Ladies moe<br>
 Appear'd in place, the which each other did outgoe.</p><p>
 
 All which who so dare thinke for to enchace,<br>
 Him needeth sure a golden pen I weene,<br>
 To tell the feature of each goodly face.<br>
 For since the day that they created beene,<br>
 So many heauenly faces were not seene<br>
 Assembled in one place: ne he that thought<br>
 For <i>Chian</i> folke to pourtraict beauties Queene,<br>
 By view of all the fairest to him brought,<br>
 So many faire did see, as here he might haue sought.</p><p>
 
 At last the most redoubted <i>Britonesse</i>,<br>
 Her louely <i>Amoret</i> did open shew;<br>
 Whose face discouered, plainely did expresse<br>
 The heauenly pourtraict of bright Angels hew.<br>
 Well weened all, which her that time did vew,<br>
 That she should surely beare the bell away,<br>
 Till <i>Blandamour</i>, who thought he had the trew<br>
 And very <i>Florimell</i>, did her display:<br>
 The sight of whom once seene did all the rest dismay.</p><p>
 
 For all afore that seemed fayre and bright,<br>
 Now base and contemptible did appeare,<br>
 Compar'd to her, that shone as Phebes light,<br>
 Amongst the lesser starres in euening cleare.<br>
 All that her saw with wonder rauisht weare,<br>
 And weend no mortall creature she should bee,<br>
 But some celestiall shape, that flesh did beare:<br>
 Yet all were glad there <i>Florimell</i> to see;<br>
 Yet thought that <i>Florimell</i> was not so faire as shee.</p><p>
 
 As guilefull Goldsmith that by secret skill,<br>
 With golden foyle doth finely ouer spred<br>
 Some baser metall, which commend he will<br>
 Vnto the vulgar for good gold insted,<br>
 He much more goodly glosse thereon doth shed,<br>
 To hide his falshood, then if it were trew:<br>
 So hard, this Idole was to be ared,<br>
 That <i>Florimell</i> her selfe in all mens vew<br>
 She seem'd to passe: so forged things do fairest shew.</p><p>
 
 Then was that golden belt by doome of all<br>
 Graunted to her, as to the fayrest Dame.<br>
 Which being brought, about her middle small<br>
 They thought to gird, as best it her became;<br>
 But by no meanes they could it thereto frame.<br>
 For euer as they fastned it, it loos'd<br>
 And fell away, as feeling secret blame.<br>
 Full oft about her wast she it enclos'd;<br>
 And it as oft was from about her wast disclos'd.</p><p>
 
 That all men wondred at the vncouth sight,<br>
 And each one thought, as to their fancies came.<br>
 But she her selfe did thinke it doen for spight,<br>
 And touched was with secret wrath and shame<br>
 Therewith, as thing deuiz'd her to defame.<br>
 Then many other Ladies likewise tride,<br>
 About their tender loynes to knit the same;<br>
 But it would not on none of them abide,<br>
 But when they thought it fast, eftsoones it was vntide.</p><p>
 
 Which when that scornefull <i>Squire of Dames</i> did vew,<br>
 He lowdly gan to laugh, and thus to iest;<br>
 Alas for pittie that so faire a crew,<br>
 As like can not be seene from East to West,<br>
 Cannot find one this girdle to inuest.<br>
 Fie on the man, that did it first inuent,<br>
 To shame vs all with this, <i>Vngirt vnblest</i>.<br>
 Let neuer Ladie to his loue assent,<br>
 That hath this day so many so vnmanly shent.</p><p>
 
 Thereat all Knights gan laugh, and Ladies lowre:<br>
 Till that at last the gentle <i>Amoret</i><br>
 Likewise assayd, to proue that girdles powre;<br>
 And hauing it about her middle set,<br>
 Did find it fit, withouten breach or let.<br>
 Whereat the rest gan greatly to enuie:<br>
 But <i>Florimell</i> exceedingly did fret,<br>
 And snatching from her hand halfe angrily<br>
 The belt againe, about her bodie gan it tie.</p><p>
 
 Yet nathemore would it her bodie fit;<br>
 Yet nathelesse to her, as her dew right,<br>
 It yeelded was by them, that iudged it:<br>
 And she her selfe adiudged to the Knight,<br>
 That bore the Hebene speare, as wonne in fight.<br>
 But <i>Britomart</i> would not thereto assent,<br>
 Ne her owne <i>Amoret</i> forgoe so light<br>
 For that strange Dame, whose beauties wonderment<br>
 She lesse esteem'd, then th'others vertuous gouernment.</p><p>
 
 Whom when the rest did see her to refuse,<br>
 They were full glad, in hope themselues to get her:<br>
 Yet at her choice they all did greatly muse.<br>
 But after that the Iudges did arret her<br>
 Vnto the second best, that lou'd her better;<br>
 That was the <i>Saluage</i> Knight: but he was gone<br>
 In great displeasure, that he could not get her.<br>
 Then was she iudged <i>Triamond</i> his one;<br>
 But <i>Triamond</i> lou'd <i>Canacee</i>, and other none.</p><p>
 
 Tho vnto <i>Satyran</i> she was adiudged,<br>
 Who was right glad to gaine so goodly meed:<br>
 But <i>Blandamour</i> thereat full greatly grudged,<br>
 And litle prays'd his labours euill speed,<br>
 That for to winne the saddle, lost the steed.<br>
 Ne lesse thereat did <i>Paridell</i> complaine,<br>
 And thought t'appeale from that, which was decreed,<br>
 To single combat with Sir <i>Satyrane</i>.<br>
 Thereto him <i>Ate</i> stird, new discord to maintaine.</p><p>
 
 And eke with these, full many other Knights<br>
 She through her wicked working did incense,<br>
 Her to demaund, and chalenge as their rights,<br>
 Deserued for their perils recompense.<br>
 Amongst the rest with boastfull vaine pretense<br>
 Stept <i>Braggadochio</i> forth, and as his thrall<br>
 Her claym'd, by him in battell wonne long sens:<br>
 Whereto her selfe he did to witnesse call;<br>
 Who being askt, accordingly confessed all.</p><p>
 
 Thereat exceeding wroth was <i>Satyran</i>;<br>
 And wroth with <i>Satyran</i> was <i>Blandamour</i>;<br>
 And wroth with <i>Blandamour</i> was <i>Eriuan</i>;<br>
 And at them both Sir <i>Paridell</i> did loure.<br>
 So all together stird vp strifull stoure,<br>
 And readie were new battell to darraine.<br>
 Each one profest to be her paramoure,<br>
 And vow'd with speare and shield it to maintaine;<br>
 Ne Iudges powre, ne reasons rule mote them restraine.</p><p>
 
 Which troublous stirre when <i>Satyrane</i> auiz'd:<br>
 He gan to cast how to appease the same,<br>
 And to accord them all, this meanes deuiz'd:<br>
 First in the midst to set that fayrest Dame,<br>
 To whom each one his chalenge should disclame,<br>
 And he himselfe his right would eke releasse:<br>
 Then looke to whom she voluntarie came,<br>
 He should without disturbance her possesse:<br>
 Sweete is the loue that comes alone with willingnesse.</p><p>
 
 They all agreed, and then that snowy Mayd<br>
 Was in the middest plast among them all;<br>
 All on her gazing wisht, and vowd, and prayd,<br>
 And to the Queene of beautie close did call,<br>
 That she vnto their portion might befall.<br>
 Then when she long had lookt vpon each one,<br>
 As though she wished to haue pleasd them all,<br>
 At last to <i>Braggadochio</i> selfe alone<br>
 She came of her accord, in spight of all his fone.</p><p>
 
 Which when they all beheld they chaft and rag'd,<br>
 And woxe nigh mad for very harts despight,<br>
 That from reuenge their willes they scarse asswag'd:<br>
 Some thought from him her to haue reft by might;<br>
 Some proffer made with him for her to fight.<br>
 But he nought car'd for all that they could say:<br>
 For he their words as wind esteemed light.<br>
 Yet not fit place he thought it there to stay,<br>
 But secretly from thence that night her bore away.</p><p>
 
 They which remaynd, so soone as they perceiu'd,<br>
 That she was gone, departed thence with speed,<br>
 And follow'd them, in mind her to haue reau'd<br>
 From wight vnworthie of so noble meed.<br>
 In which poursuit how each one did succeede,<br>
 Shall else be told in order, as it fell.<br>
 But now of <i>Britomart</i> it here doth neede,<br>
 The hard aduentures and strange haps to tell;<br>
 Since with the rest she went not after <i>Florimell</i>.</p><p>
 
 For soone as she them saw to discord set,<br>
 Her list no longer in that place abide;<br>
 But taking with her louely <i>Amoret</i>,<br>
 Vpon her first aduenture forth did ride,<br>
 To seeke her lou'd, making blind Loue her guide.<br>
 Vnluckie Mayd to seeke her enemie!<br>
 Vnluckie Mayd to seeke him farre and wide,<br>
 Whom, when he was vnto her selfe most nie,<br>
 She through his late disguizeme˜t could him not descrie.</p><p>
 
 So much the more her griefe, the more her toyle:<br>
 Yet neither toyle nor griefe she once did spare,<br>
 In seeking him, that should her paine assoyle;<br>
 Whereto great comfort in her sad misfare<br>
 Was <i>Amoret</i>, companion of her care:<br>
 Who likewise sought her louer long miswent,<br>
 The gentle <i>Scudamour</i>, whose hart whileare<br>
 That stryfull hag with gealous discontent<br>
 Had fild, that he to fell reueng was fully bent.</p><p>
 
 Bent to reuenge on blamelesse <i>Britomart</i><br>
 The crime, which cursed <i>Ate</i> kindled earst,<br>
 The which like thornes did pricke his gealous hart,<br>
 And through his soule like poysned arrow perst,<br>
 That by no reason it might be reuerst,<br>
 For ought that <i>Glauce</i> could or doe or say.<br>
 For aye the more that she the same reherst,<br>
 The more it gauld, and grieu'd him night and day,<br>
 That nought but dire reuenge his anger mote defray.</p><p>
 
 So as they trauelled, the drouping night<br>
 Couered with cloudie storme and bitter showre,<br>
 That dreadfull seem'd to euery liuing wight,<br>
 Vpon them fell, before her timely howre;<br>
 That forced them to seeke some couert bowre,<br>
 Where they might hide their heads in quiet rest,<br>
 And shrowd their persons from that stormie stowre.<br>
 Not farre away, not meete for any guest<br>
 They spide a little cottage, like some poore mans nest.</p><p>
 
 Vnder a steepe hilles side it placed was,<br>
 There where the mouldred earth had cav'd the banke;<br>
 And fast beside a little brooke did pas<br>
 Of muddie water, that like puddle stanke;<br>
 By which few crooked sallowes grew in ranke:<br>
 Whereto approaching nigh, they heard the sound<br>
 Of many yron hammers beating ranke,<br>
 And answering their wearie turnes around,<br>
 That seemed some blacksmith dwelt in that desert grou˜d.</p><p>
 
 There entring in, they found the goodman selfe,<br>
 Full busily vnto his worke ybent;<br>
 Who was to weet a wretched wearish elfe,<br>
 With hollow eyes and rawbone cheekes forspent,<br>
 As if he had in prison long bene pent:<br>
 Full blacke and griesly did his face appeare,<br>
 Besmeard with smoke that nigh his eye-sight blent;<br>
 With rugged beard, and hoarie shagged heare,<br>
 The which he neuer wont to combe, or comely sheare.</p><p>
 
 Rude was his garment, and to rags all rent,<br>
 Ne better had he, ne for better cared:<br>
 With blistred hands emongst the cinders brent,<br>
 And fingers filthie, with long nayles vnpared,<br>
 Right fit to rend the food, on which he fared.<br>
 His name was <i>Care</i>; a blacksmith by his trade,<br>
 That neither day nor night from working spared,<br>
 But to small purpose yron wedges made;<br>
 Those be vnquiet thoughts, that carefull minds inuade.</p><p>
 
 In which his worke he had sixe seruants prest,<br>
 About the Andvile standing euermore,<br>
 With huge great hammers, that did neuer rest<br>
 From heaping stroakes, which thereon soused sore:<br>
 All sixe strong groomes, but one then other more:<br>
 For by degrees they all were disagreed;<br>
 So likewise did the hammers which they bore,<br>
 Like belles in greatnesse orderly succeed,<br>
 That he which was the last, the first did farre exceede.</p><p>
 
 He like a monstrous Gyant seem'd in sight,<br>
 Farre passing <i>Bronteus</i>, or <i>Pynacmon</i> great,<br>
 The which in <i>Lipari</i> doe day and night<br>
 Frame thunderbolts for <i>Ioues</i> auengefull threate.<br>
 So dreadfully he did the anduile beat,<br>
 That seem'd to dust he shortly would it driue:<br>
 So huge his hammer and so fierce his heat,<br>
 That seem'd a rocke of Diamond it could riue,<br>
 And rend a sunder quite, if he thereto list striue.</p><p>
 
 Sir <i>Scudamour</i> there entring, much admired<br>
 The manner of their worke and wearie paine;<br>
 And hauing long beheld, at last enquired<br>
 The cause and end thereof: but all in vaine;<br>
 For they for nought would from their worke refraine,<br>
 Ne let his speeches come vnto their eare.<br>
 And eke the breathfull bellowes blew amaine,<br>
 Like to the Northren winde, that none could heare:<br>
 Those <i>Pensifenesse</i> did moue; and <i>Sighes</i> the bellows weare.</p><p>
 
 Which when that warriour saw, he said no more,<br>
 But in his armour layd him downe to rest:<br>
 To rest he layd him downe vpon the flore,<br>
 (Whylome for ventrous Knights the bedding best)<br>
 And thought his wearie limbs to haue redrest.<br>
 And that old aged Dame, his faithfull Squire,<br>
 Her feeble ioynts layd eke a downe to rest;<br>
 That needed much her weake age to desire,<br>
 After so long a trauell, which them both did tire.</p><p>
 
 There lay Sir <i>Scudamour</i> long while expecting,<br>
 When gentle sleepe his heauie eyes would close;<br>
 Oft chaunging sides, and oft new place electing,<br>
 Where better seem'd he mote himselfe repose;<br>
 And oft in wrath he thence againe vprose;<br>
 And oft in wrath he layd him downe againe.<br>
 But wheresoeuer he did himselfe dispose,<br>
 He by no meanes could wished ease obtaine:<br>
 So euery place seem'd painefull, and ech changing vaine.</p><p>
 
 And euermore, when he to sleepe did thinke,<br>
 The hammers sound his senses did molest;<br>
 And euermore, when he began to winke,<br>
 The bellowes noyse disturb'd his quiet rest,<br>
 Ne suffred sleepe to settle in his brest.<br>
 And all the night the dogs did barke and howle<br>
 About the house, at sent of stranger guest:<br>
 And now the crowing Cocke, and now the Owle<br>
 Lowde shriking him afflicted to the very sowle.</p><p>
 
 And if by fortune any litle nap<br>
 Vpon his heauie eye-lids chaunst to fall,<br>
 Eftsoones one of those villeins him did rap<br>
 Vpon his headpeece with his yron mall;<br>
 That he was soone awaked therewithall,<br>
 And lightly started vp as one affrayd;<br>
 Or as if one him suddenly did call.<br>
 So oftentimes he out of sleepe abrayd,<br>
 And then lay musing long, on that him ill apayd.</p><p>
 
 So long he muzed, and so long he lay,<br>
 That at the last his wearie sprite opprest<br>
 With fleshly weaknesse, which no creature may<br>
 Long time resist, gaue place to kindly rest,<br>
 That all his senses did full soone arrest:<br>
 Yet in his soundest sleepe, his dayly feare<br>
 His ydle braine gan busily molest,<br>
 And made him dreame those two disloyall were:<br>
 The things that day most minds, at night doe most appeare.</p><p>
 
 With that, the wicked carle the maister Smith<br>
 A paire of redwhot yron tongs did take<br>
 Out of the burning cinders, and therewith<br>
 Vnder his side him nipt, that forst to wake,<br>
 He felt his hart for very paine to quake,<br>
 And started vp auenged for to be<br>
 On him, the which his quiet slomber brake:<br>
 Yet looking round about him none could see;<br>
 Yet did the smart remaine, though he himselfe did flee.</p><p>
 
 In such disquiet and hartfretting payne,<br>
 He all that night, that too long night did passe.<br>
 And now the day out of the Ocean mayne<br>
 Began to peepe aboue this earthly masse,<br>
 With pearly dew sprinkling the morning grasse:<br>
 Then vp he rose like heauie lumpe of lead,<br>
 That in his face, as in a looking glasse,<br>
 The signes of anguish one mote plainely read,<br>
 And ghesse the man to be dismayd with gealous dread.</p><p>
 
 Vnto his lofty steede he clombe anone,<br>
 And forth vpon his former voiage fared,<br>
 And with him eke that aged Squire attone;<br>
 Who whatsoeuer perill was prepared,<br>
 Both equall paines and equall perill shared:<br>
 The end whereof and daungerous euent<br>
 Shall for another canticle be spared.<br>
 But here my wearie teeme nigh ouer spent<br>
 Shall breath it selfe awhile, after so long a went.</p><p>
