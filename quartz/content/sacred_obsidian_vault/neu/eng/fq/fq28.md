 <i>The Redcrosse knight to Britomart<br>
 describeth Artegall: <br>
 The wondrous myrrhour, by which she<br>
 in loue with him did fall.</i><p>

 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 H
 Ere haue I cause, in men iust blame to find,<br>
 That in their proper prayse too partiall bee,<br>
 And not indifferent to woman kind,<br>
 To whom no share in armes and cheualrie<br>
 They do impart, ne maken memorie<br>
 Of their braue gestes and prowesse martiall;<br>
 Scarse do they spare to one or two or three,<br>
 Rowme in their writs; yet the same writing small<br>
 Does all their deeds deface, and dims their glories all.<p>
 
 But by record of antique times I find,<br>
 That women wont in warres to beare most sway,<br>
 And to all great exploits them selues inclind:<br>
 Of which they still the girlond bore away,<br>
 Till enuious Men fearing their rules decay,<br>
 Gan coyne streight lawes to curb their liberty;<br>
 Yet sith they warlike armes haue layd away:<br>
 They haue exceld in artes and pollicy,<br>
 That now we foolish men that prayse gin eke t'enuy.</p><p>
 
 Of warlike puissaunce in ages spent,<br>
 Be thou faire <i>Britomart</i>, whose prayse I write,<br>
 But of all wisedome be thou precedent,<br>
 O soueraigne Queene, whose prayse I would endite,<br>
 Endite I would as dewtie doth excite;<br>
 But ah my rimes too rude and rugged arre,<br>
 When in so high an obiect they do lite,<br>
 And striuing, fit to make, I feare do marre:<br>
 Thy selfe thy prayses tell, and make them knowen farre.</p><p>
 
 She trauelling with <i>Guyon</i> by the way,<br>
 Of sundry things faire purpose gan to find,<br>
 T'abridg their iourney long, and lingring day;<br>
 Mongst which it fell into that Faeries mind,<br>
 To aske this Briton Mayd, what vncouth wind,<br>
 Brought her into those parts, and what inquest<br>
 Made her dissemble her disguised kind:<br>
 Faire Lady she him seemd, like Lady drest,<br>
 But fairest knight aliue, when armed was her brest.</p><p>
 
 Thereat she sighing softly, had no powre<br>
 To speake a while, ne ready answere make,<br>
 But with hart-thrilling throbs and bitter stowre,<br>
 As if she had a feuer fit, did quake,<br>
 And euery daintie limbe with horrour shake;<br>
 And euer and anone the rosy red,<br>
 Flasht through her face, as it had been a flake<br>
 Of lightning, through bright heauen fulmined;<br>
 At last the passion past she thus him answered.</p><p>
 
 Faire Sir, I let you weete, that from the howre<br>
 I taken was from nourses tender pap,<br>
 I haue beene trained vp in warlike stowre,<br>
 To tossen speare and shield, and to affrap<br>
 The warlike ryder to his most mishap;<br>
 Sithence I loathed haue my life to lead,<br>
 As Ladies wont, in pleasures wanton lap,<br>
 To finger the fine needle and nyce thread;<br>
 Me leuer were with point of foemans speare be dead.</p><p>
 
 All my delight on deedes of armes is set,<br>
 To hunt out perils and aduentures hard,<br>
 By sea, by land, where so they may be met,<br>
 Onely for honour and for high regard,<br>
 Without respect of richesse or reward.<br>
 For such intent into these parts I came,<br>
 Withouten compasse, or withouten card,<br>
 Far fro my natiue soyle, that is by name<br>
 The greater <i>Britaine</i>, here to seeke for prayse and fame.</p><p>
 
 Fame blazed hath, that here in Faery lond<br>
 Do many famous Knightes and Ladies wonne,<br>
 And many straunge aduentures to be fond,<br>
 Of which great worth and worship may be wonne;<br>
 Which I to proue, this voyage haue begonne.<br>
 But mote I weet of you, right curteous knight,<br>
 Tydings of one, that hath vnto me donne<br>
 Late foule dishonour and reprochfull spight,<br>
 The which I seeke to wreake, and <i>Arthegall</i> he hight.</p><p>
 
 The word gone out, she backe againe would call,<br>
 As her repenting so to haue missayd,<br>
 But that he it vp-taking ere the fall,<br>
 Her shortly answered; Faire martiall Mayd<br>
 Certes ye misauised beene, t'vpbrayd<br>
 A gentle knight with so vnknightly blame:<br>
 For weet ye well of all, that euer playd<br>
 At tilt or tourney, or like warlike game,<br>
 The noble <i>Arthegall</i> hath euer borne the name.</p><p>
 
 For thy great wonder were it, if such shame<br>
 Should euer enter in his bounteous thought,<br>
 Or euer do, that mote deseruen blame:<br>
 The noble courage neuer weeneth ought,<br>
 That may vnworthy of it selfe be thought.<br>
 Therefore, faire Damzell, be ye well aware,<br>
 Least that too farre ye haue your sorrow sought:<br>
 You and your countrey both I wish welfare,<br>
 And honour both; for each of other worthy are.</p><p>
 
 The royall Mayd woxe inly wondrous glad,<br>
 To heare her Loue so highly magnifide,<br>
 And ioyd that euer she affixed had,<br>
 Her hart on knight so goodly glorifide,<br>
 How euer finely she it faind to hide:<br>
 The louing mother, that nine monethes did beare,<br>
 In the deare closet of her painefull side,<br>
 Her tender babe, it seeing safe appeare,<br>
 Doth not so much reioyce, as she reioyced theare.</p><p>
 
 But to occasion him to further talke,<br>
 To feed her humour with his pleasing stile,<br>
 Her list in strifull termes with him to balke,<br>
 And thus replide, How euer, Sir, ye file<br>
 Your curteous tongue, his prayses to compile,<br>
 It ill beseemes a knight of gentle sort,<br>
 Such as ye haue him boasted, to beguile<br>
 A simple mayd, and worke so haynous tort,<br>
 In shame of knighthood, as I largely can report.</p><p>
 
 Let be therefore my vengeaunce to disswade,<br>
 And read, where I that faytour false may find.<br>
 Ah, but if reason faire might you perswade,<br>
 To slake your wrath, and mollifie your mind,<br>
 (Said he) perhaps ye should it better find:<br>
 For hardy thing it is, to weene by might,<br>
 That man to hard conditions to bind,<br>
 Or euer hope to match in equall fight,<br>
 Whose prowesse paragon saw neuer liuing wight.</p><p>
 
 Ne soothlich is it easie for to read,<br>
 Where now on earth, or how he may be found;<br>
 For he ne wonneth in one certaine stead,<br>
 But restlesse walketh all the world around,<br>
 Ay doing things, that to his fame redound,<br>
 Defending Ladies cause, and Orphans right,<br>
 Where so he heares, that any doth confound<br>
 Them comfortlesse, through tyranny or might:<br>
 So is his soueraine honour raisde to heauens hight.</p><p>
 
 His feeling words her feeble sence much pleased,<br>
 And softly sunck into her molten hart;<br>
 Hart that is inly hurt, is greatly eased<br>
 With hope of thing, that may allegge his smart;<br>
 For pleasing words are like to Magick art,<br>
 That doth the charmed Snake in slomber lay:<br>
 Such secret ease felt gentle <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
 Yet list the same efforce with faind gainesay;<br>
 So dischord oft in Musick makes the sweeter lay.</p><p>
 
 And said, Sir knight, these idle termes forbeare,<br>
 And sith it is vneath to find his haunt,<br>
 Tell me some markes, by which he may appeare,<br>
 If chaunce I him encounter parauaunt;<br>
 For perdie one shall other slay, or daunt:<br>
 What shape, what shield, what armes, what steed, what sted,<br>
 And what so else his person most may vaunt?<br>
 All which the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight to point ared,<br>
 And him in euery part before her fashioned.</p><p>
 
 Yet him in euery part before she knew,<br>
 How euer list her now her knowledge faine,<br>
 Sith him whilome in <i>Britaine</i> she did vew,<br>
 To her reuealed in a mirrhour plaine,<br>
 Whereof did grow her first engraffed paine;<br>
 Whose root and stalke so bitter yet did tast,<br>
 That but the fruit more sweetnesse did containe,<br>
 Her wretched dayes in dolour she mote wast,<br>
 And yield the pray of loue to lothsome death at last.</p><p>
 
 By strange occasion she did him behold,<br>
 And much more strangely gan to loue his sight,<br>
 As it in bookes hath written bene of old.<br>
 In <i>Deheubarth</i> that now South-wales is hight,<br>
 What time king <i>Ryence</i> raign'd, and dealed right,<br>
 The great Magitian <i>Merlin</i> had deuiz'd,<br>
 By his deepe science, and hell-dreaded might,<br>
 A looking glasse, right wondrously aguiz'd,<br>
 Whose vertues through the wyde world soone were solemniz'd.</p><p>
 
 It vertue had, to shew in perfect sight,<br>
 What euer thing was in the world contaynd,<br>
 Betwixt the lowest earth and heauens hight,<br>
 So that it to the looker appertaynd;<br>
 What euer foe had wrought, or frend had faynd,<br>
 Therein discouered was, ne ought mote pas,<br>
 Ne ought in secret from the same remaynd;<br>
 For thy it round and hollow shaped was,<br>
 Like to the world it selfe, and seem'd a world of glas.</p><p>
 
 Who wonders not, that reades so wonderous worke?<br>
 But who does wonder, that has red the Towre,<br>
 Wherein th'Ægyptian <i>Phao</i> long did lurke<br>
 From all mens vew, that none might her discoure,<br>
 Yet she might all men vew out of her bowre?<br>
 Great <i>Ptolomæe</i> it for his lemans sake<br>
 Ybuilded all of glasse, by Magicke powre,<br>
 And also it impregnable did make;<br>
 Yet when his loue was false, he with a peaze it brake.</p><p>
 
 Such was the glassie globe that <i>Merlin</i> made,<br>
 And gaue vnto king <i>Ryence</i> for his gard,<br>
 That neuer foes his kingdome might inuade,<br>
 But he it knew at home before he hard<br>
 Tydings thereof, and so them still debar'd.<br>
 It was a famous Present for a Prince,<br>
 And worthy worke of infinite reward,<br>
 That treasons could bewray, and foes conuince;<br>
 Happie this Realme, had it remained euer since.</p><p>
 
 One day it fortuned, faire <i>Britomart</i><br>
 Into her fathers closet to repayre;<br>
 For nothing he from her reseru'd apart,<br>
 Being his onely daughter and his hayre;<br>
 Where when she had espyde that mirrhour fayre,<br>
 Her selfe a while therein she vewd in vaine;<br>
 Tho her auizing of the vertues rare,<br>
 Which thereof spoken were, she gan againe<br>
 Her to bethinke of, that mote to her selfe pertaine.</p><p>
 
 But as it falleth, in the gentlest harts<br>
 Imperious Loue hath highest set his throne,<br>
 And tyrannizeth in the bitter smarts<br>
 Of them, that to him buxome are and prone:<br>
 So thought this Mayd (as maydens vse to done)<br>
 Whom fortune for her husband would allot,<br>
 Not that she lusted after any one;<br>
 For she was pure from blame of sinfull blot,<br>
 Yet wist her life at last must lincke in that same knot.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones there was presented to her eye<br>
 A comely knight, all arm'd in complete wize,<br>
 Through whose bright ventayle lifted vp on hye<br>
 His manly face, that did his foes agrize,<br>
 And friends to termes of gentle truce entize,<br>
 Lookt foorth, as <i>Phoebus</i> face out of the east,<br>
 Betwixt two shadie mountaines doth arize;<br>
 Portly his person was, and much increast<br>
 Through his Heroicke grace, and honorable gest.</p><p>
 
 His crest was couered with a couchant Hound,<br>
 And all his armour seem'd of antique mould,<br>
 But wondrous massie and assured sound,<br>
 And round about yfretted all with gold,<br>
 In which there written was with cyphers old,<br>
 <i>Achilles armes, which Arthegall did win</i>.<br>
 And on his shield enueloped seuenfold<br>
 He bore a crowned litle Ermilin,<br>
 That deckt the azure field with her faire pouldred skin.</p><p>
 
 The Damzell well did vew his personage,<br>
 And liked well, ne further fastned not,<br>
 But went her way; ne her vnguilty age<br>
 Did weene, vnwares, that her vnlucky lo t<br>
 Lay hidden in the bottome of the pot;<br>
 Of hurt vnwist most daunger doth redound:<br>
 But the false Archer, which that arrow shot<br>
 So slyly, that she did not feele the wound,<br>
 Did smyle full smoothly at her weetlesse wofull stound.</p><p>
 
 Thenceforth the feather in her loftie crest,<br>
 Ruffed of loue, gan lowly to auaile,<br>
 And her proud portance, and her princely gest,<br>
 With which she earst tryumphed, now did quail<br>
 Sad, solemne, sowre, and full of fancies fraile<br>
 She woxe; yet wist she neither how, nor why,<br>
 She wist not, silly Mayd, what she did aile,<br>
 Yet wist, she was not well at ease perdy,<br>
 Yet thought it was not loue, but some melancholy.</p><p>
 
 So soone as Night had with her pallid hew<br>
 Defast the beautie of the shining sky,<br>
 And reft from men the worlds desired vew,<br>
 She with her Nourse adowne to sleepe did lye;<br>
 But sleepe full farre away from her did fly:<br>
 In stead thereof sad sighes, and sorrowes deepe<br>
 Kept watch and ward about her warily,<br>
 That nought she did but wayle, and often steepe<br>
 He daintie couch with teares, which closely she did weepe.</p><p>
 
 And if that any drop of slombring rest<br>
 Did chaunce to still into her wearie spright,<br>
 When feeble nature felt her selfe opprest,<br>
 Streight way with dreames, and with fantasticke sight<br>
 Of dreadfull things the same was put to flight,<br>
 That oft out of her bed she did astart,<br>
 As one with vew of ghastly feends affright:<br>
 Tho gan she to renew her former smart,<br>
 And thinke of that faire visage, written in her hart.</p><p>
 
 One night, when she was tost with such vnrest,<br>
 Her aged Nurse, whose name was <i>Glauce</i> hight,<br>
 Feeling her leape out of her loathed nest,<br>
 Betwixt her feeble armes her quickly keight,<br>
 And downe againe in her warme bed her dight;<br>
 Ah my deare daughter, ah my dearest dread,<br>
 What vncouth fit (said she) what euill plight<br>
 Hath thee opprest, and with sad drearyhead<br>
 Chaunged thy liuely cheare, and liuing made thee dead?</p><p>
 
 For not of nought these suddeine ghastly feares<br>
 All night afflict thy naturall repose,<br>
 And all the day, when as thine equall peares,<br>
 Their fit disports with faire delight doe chose,<br>
 Thou in dull corners doest thy selfe inclose,<br>
 Ne tastest Princes pleasures, ne doest spred<br>
 Abroad thy fresh youthes fairest flowre, but lose<br>
 Both leafe and fruit, both too vntimely shed,<br>
 As one in wilfull bale for euer buried.</p><p>
 
 The time, that mortall men their weary cares<br>
 Do lay away, and all wilde beastes do rest,<br>
 And euery riuer eke his course forbeares<br>
 Then doth this wicked euill thee infest,<br>
 And riue with thousand throbs thy thrilled brest;<br>
 Like an huge <i>Aetn'</i> of deepe engulfed griefe,<br>
 Sorrow is heaped in thy hollow chest,<br>
 Whence forth it breakes in sighes and anguish rife,<br>
 As smoke and sulphure mingled with confused strife.</p><p>
 
 Aye me, how much I feare, least loue it bee;<br>
 But if that loue it be, as sure I read<br>
 By knowen signes and passions, which I see,<br>
 Be it worthy of thy race and royall sead,<br>
 Then I auow by this most sacred head<br>
 Of my deare foster child, to ease thy griefe,<br>
 And win thy will: Therefore away doe dread;<br>
 For death nor daunger from thy dew reliefe<br>
 Shall me debarre, tell me therefore my liefest liefe.</p><p>
 
 So hauing said, her twixt her armes twaine<br>
 She straightly straynd, and colled tenderly,<br>
 And euery trembling ioynt, and euery vaine<br>
 She softly felt, and rubbed busily,<br>
 To doe the frosen cold away to fly;<br>
 And her faire deawy eies with kisses deare<br>
 She oft did bath, and oft againe did dry;<br>
 And euer her importund, not to feare<br>
 To let the secret of her hart to her appeare.</p><p>
 
 The Damzell pauzd, and then thus fearefully;<br>
 Ah Nurse, what needeth thee to eke my paine?<br>
 Is not enough, that I alone doe dye,<br>
 But it must doubled be with death of twaine?<br>
 For nought for me but death there doth remaine.<br>
 O daughter deare (said she) despaire no whit;<br>
 For neuer sore, but might a salue obtaine:<br>
 That blinded God, which hath ye blindly smit,<br>
 Another arrow hath your louers hart to hit.</p><p>
 
 But mine is not (quoth she) like others wound;<br>
 For which no reason can find remedy.<br>
 Was neuer such, but mote the like be found,<br>
 (Said she) and though no reason may apply<br>
 Salue to your sore, yet loue can higher stye,<br>
 Then reasons reach, and oft hath wonders donne.<br>
 But neither God of loue, nor God of sky<br>
 Can doe (said she) that, which cannot be donne.<br>
 Things oft impossible (quoth she) seeme, ere begonne.</p><p>
 
 These idle words (said she) doe nought asswage<br>
 My stubborne smart, but more annoyance breed,<br>
 For no no vsuall fire, no vsuall rage<br>
 It is, ô Nurse, which on my life doth feed,<br>
 And suckes the bloud, which from my hart doth bleed.<br>
 But since thy faithfull zeale lets me not hyde<br>
 My crime, (if crime it be) I will it reed.<br>
 Nor Prince, nor pere it is, whose loue hath gryde<br>
 My feeble brest of late, and launched this wound wyde.</p><p>
 
 Nor man it is, nor other liuing wight;<br>
 For then some hope I might vnto me draw,<br>
 But th'only shade and semblant of a knight,<br>
 Whose shape or person yet I neuer saw,<br>
 Hath me subiected to loues cruell law:<br>
 The same one day, as me misfortune led,<br>
 I in my fathers wondrous mirrhour saw,<br>
 And pleased with that seeming goodly-hed,<br>
 Vnwares the hidden hooke with baite I swallowed.</p><p>
 
 Sithens it hath infixed faster hold<br>
 Within my bleeding bowels, and so sore<br>
 Now ranckleth in this same fraile fleshly mould,<br>
 That all mine entrailes flow with poysnous gore,<br>
 And th'vlcer groweth daily more and more;<br>
 Ne can my running sore find remedie,<br>
 Other then my hard fortune to deplore,<br>
 And languish as the leafe falne from the tree,<br>
 Till death make one end of my dayes and miserie.</p><p>
 
 Daughter (said she) what need ye be dismayd,<br>
 Or why make ye such Monster of your mind?<br>
 Of much more vncouth thing I was affrayd;<br>
 Of filthy lust, contrarie vnto kind:<br>
 But this affection nothing straunge I find;<br>
 For who with reason can you aye reproue,<br>
 To loue the semblant pleasing most your mind,<br>
 And yield your heart, whence ye cannot remoue?<br>
 No guilt in you, but in the tyranny of loue.</p><p>
 
 Not so th'<i>Arabian Myrrhe</i> did set her mind;<br>
 Nor so did <i>Biblis</i> spend her pining hart,<br>
 But lou'd their natiue flesh against all kind,<br>
 And to their purpose vsed wicked art:<br>
 Yet playd <i>Pasiphaë</i> a more monstrous part,<br>
 That lou'd a Bull, and learnd a beast to bee;<br>
 Such shamefull lusts who loaths not, which depart<br>
 From course of nature and of modestie?<br>
 Sweet loue such lewdnes bands from his faire companie.</p><p>
 
 But thine my Deare (welfare thy heart my deare)<br>
 Though strange beginning had, yet fixed is<br>
 On one, that worthy may perhaps appeare;<br>
 And certes seemes bestowed not amis:<br>
 Ioy thereof haue thou and eternall blis.<br>
 With that vpleaning on her elbow weake,<br>
 Her alablaster brest she soft did kis,<br>
 Which all that while she felt to pant and quake,<br>
 As it an Earth-quake were; at last she thus bespake.</p><p>
 
 Beldame, your words doe worke me litle ease;<br>
 For though my loue be not so lewdly bent,<br>
 As those ye blame, yet may it nought appease<br>
 My raging smart, ne ought my flame relent,<br>
 But rather doth my helpelesse griefe augment.<br>
 For they, how euer shamefull and vnkind,<br>
 Yet did possesse their horrible intent:<br>
 Short end of sorrowes they thereby did find;<br>
 So was their fortune good, though wicked were their mind.</p><p>
 
 But wicked fortune mine, though mind be good,<br>
 Can haue no end, nor hope of my desire,<br>
 But feed on shadowes, whiles I die for food,<br>
 And like a shadow wexe, whiles with entire<br>
 Affection, I doe languish and expire.<br>
 I fonder, then <i>Cephisus</i> foolish child,<br>
 Who hauing vewed in a fountaine shere<br>
 His face, was with the loue thereof beguild;<br>
 I fonder loue a shade, the bodie farre exild.</p><p>
 
 Nought like (quoth she) for that same wretched boy<br>
 Was of himselfe the idle Paramoure;<br>
 Both loue and louer, without hope of ioy,<br>
 For which he faded to a watry flowre.<br>
 But better fortune thine, and better howre,<br>
 Which lou'st the shadow of a warlike knight;<br>
 No shadow, but a bodie hath in powre:<br>
 That bodie, wheresoeuer that it light,<br>
 May learned be by cyphers, or by Magicke might.</p><p>
 
 But if thou may with reason yet represse<br>
 The growing euill, ere it strength haue got,<br>
 And thee abandond wholly doe possesse,<br>
 Against it strongly striue, and yield thee not,<br>
 Till thou in open field adowne be smot.<br>
 But if the passion mayster thy fraile might,<br>
 So that needs loue or death must be thy lot,<br>
 Then I auow to thee, by wrong or right<br>
 To compasse thy desire, and find that loued knight.</p><p>
 
 Her chearefull words much cheard the feeble spright<br>
 Of the sicke virgin, that her downe she layd<br>
 In her warme bed to sleepe, if that she might;<br>
 And the old-woman carefully displayd<br>
 The clothes about her round with busie ayd;<br>
 So that at last a little creeping sleepe<br>
 Surprisd her sense: she therewith well apayd,<br>
 The drunken lampe downe in the oyle did steepe,<br>
 And set her by to watch, and set her by to weepe.</p><p>
 
 Earely the morrow next, before that day<br>
 His ioyous face did to the world reueale,<br>
 They both vprose and tooke their readie way<br>
 Vnto the Church, their prayers to appeale,<br>
 With great deuotion, and with litle zeale:<br>
 For the faire Damzell from the holy herse<br>
 Her loue-sicke hart to other thoughts did steale;<br>
 And that old Dame said many an idle verse,<br>
 Out of her daughters hart fond fancies to reuerse.</p><p>
 
 Returned home, the royall Infant fell<br>
 Into her former fit; for why, no powre<br>
 Nor guidance of her selfe in her did dwell.<br>
 But th'aged Nurse her calling to her bowre,<br>
 Had gathered Rew, and Sauine, and the flowre<br>
 Of <i>Camphara</i>, and Calamint, and Dill,<br>
 All which she in a earthen Pot did poure,<br>
 And to the brim with Colt wood did it fill,<br>
 And many drops of milke and bloud through it did spill.</p><p>
 
 Then taking thrise three haires from off her head,<br>
 Them trebly breaded in a threefold lace,<br>
 And round about the pots mouth, bound the thread,<br>
 And after hauing whispered a space<br>
 Certaine sad words, with hollow voice and bace,<br>
 She to the virgin said, thrise said she it;<br>
 Come daughter come, come; spit vpon my face,<br>
 Spit thrise vpon me, thrise vpon me spit;<br>
 Th'vneuen number for this businesse is most fit.</p><p>
 
 That sayd, her round about she from her turnd,<br>
 She turned her contrarie to the Sunne,<br>
 Thrise she her turnd contrary, and returnd,<br>
 All contrary, for she the right did shunne,<br>
 And euer what she did, was streight vndonne.<br>
 So thought she to vndoe her daughters loue:<br>
 But loue, that is in gentle brest begonne,<br>
 No idle charmes so lightly may remoue,<br>
 That well can witnesse, who by triall it does proue.</p><p>
 
 Ne ought it mote the noble Mayd auayle,<br>
 Ne slake the furie of her cruell flame,<br>
 But that she still did waste, and still did wayle,<br>
 That through long languour, and hart-burning brame<br>
 She shortly like a pyned ghost became,<br>
 Which long hath waited by the Stygian strond.<br>
 That when old <i>Glauce</i> saw, for feare least blame<br>
 Of her miscarriage should in her be fond,<br>
 She wist not how t'amend, nor how it to withstond.</p><p>
