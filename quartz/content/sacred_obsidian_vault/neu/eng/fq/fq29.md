 <i>Merlin bewrayes to Britomart,<br>
 the state of Artegall. <br>
 And shewes the famous Progeny<br>
 which from them springen shall.</i> <p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 M
 Ost sacred fire, that burnest mightily<br>
 In liuing brests, ykindled first aboue,<br>
 Emongst th'eternall spheres and lamping sky,<br>
 And thence pourd into men, which men call Loue;<br>
 Not that same, which doth base affections moue<br>
 In brutish minds, and filthy lust inflame,<br>
 But that sweet fit, that doth true beautie loue,<br>
 And choseth vertue for his dearest Dame,<br>
 Whence spring all noble deeds and neuer dying fame:<p>
 
 Well did Antiquitie a God thee deeme,<br>
 That ouer mortall minds hast so great might,<br>
 To order them, as best to thee doth seeme,<br>
 And all their actions to direct aright;<br>
 The fatall purpose of diuine foresight,<br>
 Thou doest effect in destined descents,<br>
 Through deepe impression of thy secret might,<br>
 And stirredst vp th'Heroes high intents,<br>
 Which the late world admyres for wondrous monimẽts.</p><p>
 
 But thy dread darts in none doe triumph more,<br>
 Ne brauer proofe in any, of thy powre<br>
 Shew'dst thou, then in this royall Maid of yore,<br>
 Making her seeke an vnknowne Paramoure,<br>
 From the worlds end, through many a bitter stowre:<br>
 From whose two loynes thou afterwards did rayse<br>
 Most famous fruits of matrimoniall bowre,<br>
 Which through the earth haue spred their liuing prayse,<br>
 That fame in trompe of gold eternally displayes.</p><p>
 
 Begin then, ô my dearest sacred Dame,<br>
 Daughter of <i>Phoebus</i> and of <i>Memorie</i>,<br>
 That doest ennoble with immortall name<br>
 The warlike Worthies, from antiquitie,<br>
 In thy great volume of Eternitie:<br>
 Begin, ô <i>Clio</i>, and recount from hence<br>
 My glorious Soueraines goodly auncestrie,<br>
 Till that by dew degrees and long pretence,<br>
 Thou haue it lastly brought vnto her Excellence.</p><p>
 
 Full many wayes within her troubled mind,<br>
 Old <i>Glauce</i> cast, to cure this Ladies griefe:<br>
 Full many waies she sought, but none could find,<br>
 Nor herbes, nor charmes, nor counsell, that is chiefe<br>
 And choisest med'cine for sicke harts reliefe:<br>
 For thy great care she tooke, and greater feare,<br>
 Least that it should her turne to foule repriefe,<br>
 And sore reproch, when so her father deare<br>
 Should of his dearest daughters hard misfortune heare.</p><p>
 
 At last she her auisd, that he, which made<br>
 That mirrhour, wherein the sicke Damosell<br>
 So straungely vewed her straunge louers shade,<br>
 To weet, the learned <i>Merlin</i>, well could tell,<br>
 Vnder what coast of heauen the man did dwell,<br>
 And by what meanes his loue might best be wrought:<br>
 For though beyond the <i>Africk Ismaell</i>,<br>
 Or th'Indian <i>Peru</i> he were, she thought<br>
 Him forth through infinite endeuour to haue sought.</p><p>
 
 Forthwith themselues disguising both in straunge<br>
 And base attyre, that none might them bewray,<br>
 To <i>Maridunum</i>, that is now by chaunge<br>
 Of name <i>Cayr-Merdin</i> cald, they tooke their way:<br>
 There the wise <i>Merlin</i> whylome wont (they say)<br>
 To make his wonne, low vnderneath the ground,<br>
 In a deepe delue, farre from the vew of day,<br>
 That of no liuing wight he mote be found,<br>
 When so he counseld with his sprights encõpast round.</p><p>
 
 And if thou euer happen that same way<br>
 To trauell, goe to see that dreadfull place:<br>
 It is an hideous hollow caue (they say)<br>
 Vnder a rocke that lyes a little space<br>
 From the swift <i>Barry</i>, tombling downe apace,<br>
 Emongst the woodie hilles of <i>Dyneuowre</i>:<br>
 But dare thou not, I charge, in any cace,<br>
 To enter into that same balefull Bowre,<br>
 For fear the cruell Feends should thee vnwares deuowre.</p><p>
 
 But standing high aloft, low lay thine eare,<br>
 And there such ghastly noise of yron chaines,<br>
 And brasen Caudrons thou shalt rombling heare,<br>
 Which thousand sprights with long enduring paines<br>
 Doe tosse, that it will stonne thy feeble braines,<br>
 And oftentimes great grones, and grieuous stounds,<br>
 When too huge toile and labour them constraines:<br>
 And oftentimes loud strokes, and ringing sounds<br>
 From vnder that deepe Rocke most horribly rebounds.</p><p>
 
 The cause some say is this: A litle while<br>
 Before that <i>Merlin</i> dyde, he did intend,<br>
 A brasen wall in compas to compile<br>
 About <i>Cairmardin</i>, and did it commend<br>
 Vnto these Sprights, to bring to perfect end.<br>
 During which worke the Ladie of the Lake,<br>
 Whom long he lou'd, for him in hast did send,<br>
 Who thereby forst his workemen to forsake,<br>
 Them bound till his returne, their labour not to slake.</p><p>
 
 In the meane time through that false Ladies traine,<br>
 He was surprisd, and buried vnder beare,<br>
 Ne euer to his worke returnd againe:<br>
 Nath'lesse those feends may not their worke forbeare,<br>
 So greatly his commaundement they feare,<br>
 But there doe toyle and trauell day and night,<br>
 Vntill that brasen wall they vp doe reare:<br>
 For <i>Merlin</i> had in Magicke more insight,<br>
 Then euer him before or after liuing wight.</p><p>
 
 For he by words could call out of the sky<br>
 Both Sunne and Moone, and make them him obay:<br>
 The land to sea, and sea to maineland dry,<br>
 And darkesome night he eke could turne to day:<br>
 Huge hostes of men he could alone dismay,<br>
 And hostes of men of meanest things could frame,<br>
 When so him list his enimies to fray:<br>
 That to this day for terror of his fame,<br>
 The feends do quake, when any him to them does name.</p><p>
 
 And sooth, men say that he was not the sonne<br>
 Of mortall Syre, or other liuing wight,<br>
 But wondrously begotten, and begonne<br>
 By false illusion of a guilefull Spright,<br>
 On a faire Ladie Nonne, that whilome hight<br>
 <i>Matilda</i>, daughter to <i>Pubidius</i>,<br>
 Who was the Lord of <i>Mathrauall</i> by right,<br>
 And coosen vnto king <i>Ambrosius</i>:<br>
 Whence he indued was with skill so maruellous.</p><p>
 
 They here ariuing, staid a while without,<br>
 Ne durst aduenture rashly in to wend,<br>
 But of their first intent gan make new dout<br>
 For dread of daunger, which it might portend:<br>
 Vntill the hardie Mayd (with loue to frend)<br>
 First entering, the dreadfull Mage there found<br>
 Deepe busied bout worke of wondrous end,<br>
 And writing strange characters in the ground,<br>
 With which the stubborn feends he to his seruice bound.</p><p>
 
 He nought was moued at their entrance bold:<br>
 For of their comming well he wist afore,<br>
 Yet list them bid their businesse to vnfold,<br>
 As if ought in this world in secret store<br>
 Were from him hidden, or vnknowne of yore.<br>
 Then <i>Glauce</i> thus, Let not it thee offend,<br>
 That we thus rashly through thy darkesome dore,<br>
 Vnwares haue prest: for either fatall end,<br>
 Or other mightie cause vs two did hither send.</p><p>
 
 He bad tell on; and then she thus began.<br>
 Now haue three Moones with borrow'd brothers light,<br>
 Thrice shined faire, and thrice seem'd dim and wan,<br>
 Sith a sore euill, which this virgin bright<br>
 Tormenteth, and doth plonge in dolefull plight,<br>
 First rooting tooke; but what thing it mote bee,<br>
 Or whence it sprong, I cannot read aright:<br>
 But this I read, that but if remedee<br>
 Thou her afford, full shortly I her dead shall see.</p><p>
 
 Therewith th'Enchaunter softly gan to smyle<br>
 At her smooth speeches, weeting inly well,<br>
 That she to him dissembled womanish guyle,<br>
 And to her said, Beldame, by that ye tell,<br>
 More need of leach-craft hath your Damozell,<br>
 Then of my skill: who helpe may haue elsewhere,<br>
 In vaine seekes wonders out of Magicke spell.<br>
 Th'old woman wox half blanck, those words to heare;<br>
 And yet was loth to let her purpose plaine appeare.</p><p>
 
 And to him said, If any leaches skill,<br>
 Or other learned meanes could haue redrest<br>
 This my deare daughters deepe engraffed ill,<br>
 Certes I should be loth thee to molest:<br>
 But this sad euill, which doth her infest,<br>
 Doth course of naturall cause farre exceed,<br>
 And housed is within her hollow brest,<br>
 That either seemes some cursed witches deed,<br>
 Or euill spright, that in her doth such torment breed.</p><p>
 
 The wisard could no lenger beare her bord,<br>
 But brusting forth in laughter, to her sayd;<br>
 <i>Glauce</i>, what needs this colourable word,<br>
 To cloke the cause, that hath it selfe bewrayd?<br>
 Ne ye faire <i>Britomartis</i>, thus arayd,<br>
 More hidden are, then Sunne in cloudy vele;<br>
 Whom thy good fortune, hauing fate obayd,<br>
 Hath hither brought, for succour to appele;<br>
 The which the powres to thee are pleased to reuele.</p><p>
 
 The doubtfull Mayd, seeing her selfe descryde,<br>
 Was all abasht, and her pure yuory<br>
 Into a cleare Carnation suddeine dyde;<br>
 As faire <i>Aurora</i> rising hastily,<br>
 Doth by her blushing tell, that she did lye<br>
 All night in old <i>Tithonus</i> frosen bed,<br>
 Whereof she seemes ashamed inwardly.<br>
 But her old Nourse was nought dishartened,<br>
 But vauntage made of that, which <i>Merlin</i> had ared.</p><p>
 
 And sayd, Sith then thou knowest all our griefe,<br>
 (For what doest not thou know?) of grace I pray,<br>
 Pitty our plaint, and yield vs meet reliefe.<br>
 With that the Prophet still awhile did stay,<br>
 And then his spirite thus gan forth display;<br>
 Most noble Virgin, that by fatall lore<br>
 Hast learn'd to loue, let no whit thee dismay<br>
 The hard begin, that meets thee in the dore,<br>
 And with sharpe fits thy tender hart oppresseth sore.</p><p>
 
 For so must all things excellent begin,<br>
 And eke enrooted deepe must be that Tree,<br>
 Whose big embodied braunches shall not lin,<br>
 Till they to heauens hight forth stretched bee.<br>
 For from thy wombe a famous Progenie<br>
 Shall spring, out of the auncient <i>Troian</i> blood,<br>
 Which shall reuiue the sleeping memorie<br>
 Of those same antique Peres, the heauens brood,<br>
 Which <i>Greece</i> and <i>Asian</i> riuers stained with their blood.</p><p>
 
 Renowmed kings, and sacred Emperours,<br>
 Thy fruitfull Ofspring, shall from thee descend;<br>
 Braue Captaines, and most mighty warriours,<br>
 That shall their conquests through all lands extend,<br>
 And their decayed kingdomes shall amend:<br>
 The feeble Britons, broken with long warre,<br>
 They shall vpreare, and mightily defend<br>
 Against their forrein foe, that comes from farre,<br>
 Till vniuersall peace compound all ciuill iarre.</p><p>
 
 It was not, <i>Britomart</i>, thy wandring eye,<br>
 Glauncing vnwares in charmed looking glas,<br>
 But the streight course of heauenly destiny,<br>
 Led with eternall prouidence, that has<br>
 Guided thy glaunce, to bring his will to pas:<br>
 Ne is thy fate, ne is thy fortune ill,<br>
 To loue the prowest knight, that euer was.<br>
 Therefore submit thy wayes vnto his will,<br>
 And do by all dew meanes thy destiny fulfill.</p><p>
 
 But read (said <i>Glauce</i>) thou Magitian<br>
 What meanes shall she out seeke, or what wayes take?<br>
 How shall she know, how shall she find the man?<br>
 Or what needs her to toyle, sith fates can make<br>
 Way for themselues, their purpose to partake?<br>
 Then <i>Merlin</i> thus; Indeed the fates are firme,<br>
 And may not shrinck, though all the world do shake:<br>
 Yet ought mens good endeuours them confirme,<br>
 And guide the heauenly causes to their constant terme.</p><p>
 
 The man whom heauens haue ordaynd to bee<br>
 The spouse of <i>Britomart</i>, is <i>Arthegall</i>:<br>
 He wonneth in the land of <i>Fayeree</i>,<br>
 Yet is no <i>Fary</i> borne, ne sib at all<br>
 To Elfes, but sprong of seed terrestriall,<br>
 And whilome by false <i>Faries</i> stolne away,<br>
 Whiles yet in infant cradle he did crall;<br>
 Ne other to himselfe is knowne this day,<br>
 But that he by an Elfe was gotten of a <i>Fay</i>.</p><p>
 
 But sooth he is the sonne of <i>Gorlois</i>,<br>
 And brother vnto <i>Cador</i> Cornish king,<br>
 And for his warlike feates renowmed is,<br>
 From where the day out of the sea doth spring,<br>
 Vntill the closure of the Euening.<br>
 From thence, him firmely bound with faithfull band,<br>
 To this his natiue soyle thou backe shalt bring,<br>
 Strongly to aide his countrey, to withstand<br>
 The powre of forrein Paynims, which inuade thy land.</p><p>
 
 Great aid thereto his mighty puissaunce,<br>
 And dreaded name shall giue in that sad day:<br>
 Where also proofe of thy prow valiaunce<br>
 Thou then shalt make, t'increase thy louers pray.<br>
 Long time ye both in armes shall beare great sway,<br>
 Till thy wombes burden thee from them do call,<br>
 And his last fate him from thee take away,<br>
 Too rathe cut off by practise criminall<br>
 Of secret foes, that him shall make in mischiefe fall.</p><p>
 
 Where thee yet shall he leaue for memory<br>
 Of his late puissaunce, his Image dead,<br>
 That liuing him in all actiuity<br>
 To thee shall represent. He from the head<br>
 Of his coosin <i>Constantius</i> without dread<br>
 Shall take the crowne, that was his fathers right,<br>
 And therewith crowne himselfe in th'others stead:<br>
 Then shall he issew forth with dreadfull might,<br>
 Against his Saxon foes in bloudy field to fight.</p><p>
 
 Like as a Lyon, that in drowsie caue<br>
 Hath long time slept, himselfe so shall he shake,<br>
 And comming forth, shall spred his banner braue<br>
 Ouer the troubled South, that it shall make<br>
 The warlike <i>Mertians</i> for feare to quake:<br>
 Thrise shall he fight with them, and twise shall win,<br>
 But the third time shall faire accordaunce make:<br>
 And if he then with victorie can lin,<br>
 He shall his dayes with peace bring to his earthly In.</p><p>
 
 His sonne, hight <i>Vortipore</i>, shall him succeede<br>
 In kingdome, but not in felicity;<br>
 Yet shall he long time warre with happy speed,<br>
 And with great honour many battels try:<br>
 But at the last to th'importunity<br>
 Of froward fortune shall be forst to yield.<br>
 But his sonne <i>Malgo</i> shall full mightily<br>
 Auenge his fathers losse, with speare and shield,<br>
 And his proud foes discomfit in victorious field.</p><p>
 
 Behold the man, and tell me <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
 If ay more goodly creature thou didst see;<br>
 How like a Gyaunt in each manly part<br>
 Beares he himselfe with portly maiestee,<br>
 That one of th'old <i>Heroes</i> seemes to bee:<br>
 He the six Islands, comprouinciall<br>
 In auncient times vnto great Britainee,<br>
 Shall to the same reduce, and to him call<br>
 Their sundry kings to do their homage seuerall.</p><p>
 
 All which his sonne <i>Careticus</i> awhile<br>
 Shall well defend, and <i>Saxons</i> powre suppresse,<br>
 Vntill a straunger king from vnknowne soyle<br>
 Arriuing, him with multitude oppresse;<br>
 Great <i>Gormond</i>, hauing with huge mightinesse<br>
 Ireland subdewd, and therein fixt his throne,<br>
 Like a swift Otter, fell through emptinesse,<br>
 Shall ouerswim the sea with many one<br>
 Of his Norueyses, to assist the Britons fone.</p><p>
 
 He in his furie all shall ouerrunne,<br>
 And holy Church with faithlesse hands deface,<br>
 That thy sad people vtterly fordonne,<br>
 Shall to the vtmost mountaines fly apace:<br>
 Was neuer so great wast in any place,<br>
 Nor so fowle outrage doen by liuing men:<br>
 For all thy Cities they shall sacke and race,<br>
 And the greene grasse, that groweth, they shall bren,<br>
 That euen the wild beast shall dy in starued den.</p><p>
 
 Whiles thus thy Britons do in languour pine,<br>
 Proud <i>Etheldred</i> shall from the North arise,<br>
 Seruing th'ambitious will of <i>Augustine</i>,<br>
 And passing <i>Dee</i> with hardy enterprise,<br>
 Shall backe repulse the valiaunt <i>Brockwell</i> twise,<br>
 And <i>Bangor</i> with massacred Martyrs fill;<br>
 But the third time shall rew his foolhardise:<br>
 For <i>Cadwan</i> pittying his peoples ill,<br>
 Shall stoutly him defeat, and thousand <i>Saxons</i> kill.</p><p>
 
 But after him, <i>Cadwallin</i> mightily<br>
 On his sonne <i>Edwin</i> all those wrongs shall wreake;<br>
 Ne shall auaile the wicked sorcery<br>
 Of false <i>Pellite</i>, his purposes to breake,<br>
 But him shall slay, and on a gallowes bleake<br>
 Shall giue th'enchaunter his vnhappy hire;<br>
 Then shall the Britons, late dismayd and weake,<br>
 From their long vassalage gin to respire,<br>
 And on their Paynim foes auenge their ranckled ire.</p><p>
 
 Ne shall he yet his wrath so mitigate,<br>
 Till both the sonnes of <i>Edwin</i> he haue slaine,<br>
 <i>Offricke</i> and <i>Osricke</i>, twinnes vnfortunate,<br>
 Both slaine in battell vpon Layburne plaine,<br>
 Together with the king of <i>Louthiane</i>,<br>
 Hight <i>Adin</i>, and the king of <i>Orkeny</i>,<br>
 Both ioynt partakers of the fatall paine:<br>
 But <i>Penda</i>, fearefull of like desteny,<br>
 Shall yield him selfe his liegeman, and sweare fealty.</p><p>
 
 Him shall he make his fatall Instrument,<br>
 T'afflict the other <i>Saxons</i> vnsubdewd;<br>
 He marching forth with fury insolent<br>
 Against the good king <i>Oswald</i>, who indewd<br>
 With heauenly powre, and by Angels reskewd,<br>
 All holding crosses in their hands on hye,<br>
 Shall him defeate withouten bloud imbrewd:<br>
 Of which, that field for endlesse memory,<br>
 Shall <i>Heuenfield</i> be cald to all posterity.</p><p>
 
 Where at <i>Cadwallin</i> wroth, shall forth issew,<br>
 And an huge hoste into Northumber lead,<br>
 With which he godly <i>Oswald</i> shall subdew,<br>
 And crowne with martyrdome his sacred head.<br>
 Whose brother <i>Oswin</i>, daunted with like dread,<br>
 With price of siluer shall his kingdome buy,<br>
 And <i>Penda</i>, seeking him adowne to tread,<br>
 Shall tread adowne, and do him fowly dye,<br>
 But shall with gifts his Lord <i>Cadwallin</i> pacify.</p><p>
 
 Then shall <i>Cadwallin</i> dye, and then the raine<br>
 Of <i>Britons</i> eke with him attonce shall dye;<br>
 Ne shall the good <i>Cadwallader</i> with paine,<br>
 Or powre, be hable it to remedy,<br>
 When the full time prefixt by destiny,<br>
 Shalbe expird of <i>Britons</i> regiment.<br>
 For heauen it selfe shall their successe enuy,<br>
 And them with plagues and murrins pestilent<br>
 Consume, till all their warlike puissaunce be spent.</p><p>
 
 Yet after all these sorrowes, and huge hills<br>
 Of dying people, during eight yeares space,<br>
 <i>Cadwallader</i> not yielding to his ills,<br>
 From <i>Armoricke</i>, where long in wretched cace<br>
 He liu'd, returning to his natiue place,<br>
 Shalbe by vision staid from his intent:<br>
 For th'heauens haue decreed, to displace<br>
 The <i>Britons</i>, for their sinnes dew punishment,<br>
 And to the <i>Saxons</i> ouer-giue their gouernment.</p><p>
 
 Then woe, and woe, and euerlasting woe,<br>
 Be to the Briton babe, that shalbe borne,<br>
 To liue in thraldome of his fathers foe;<br>
 Late King, now captiue, late Lord, now forlorne,<br>
 The worlds reproch, the cruell victors scorne,<br>
 Banisht from Princely bowre to wastfull wood:<br>
 O who shall helpe me to lament, and mourne<br>
 The royall seed, the antique <i>Troian</i> blood,<br>
 Whose Empire lenger here, then euer any stood.</p><p>
 
 The Damzell was full deepe empassioned,<br>
 Both for his griefe, and for her peoples sake,<br>
 Whose future woes so plaine he fashioned,<br>
 And sighing sore, at length him thus bespake;<br>
 Ah but will heauens fury neuer slake,<br>
 Nor vengeaunce huge relent it selfe at last?<br>
 Will not long misery late mercy make,<br>
 But shall their name for euer be defast,<br>
 And quite from of th'earth their memory be rast?</p><p>
 
 Nay but the terme (said he) is limited,<br>
 That in this thraldome <i>Britons</i> shall abide,<br>
 And the iust reuolution measured,<br>
 That they as Straungers shalbe notifide.<br>
 For twise foure hundreth yeares shalbe supplide,<br>
 Ere they to former rule restor'd shalbee,<br>
 And their importune fates all satisfide:<br>
 Yet during this their most obscuritee,<br>
 Their beames shall oft breake forth, that men them faire may see.</p><p>
 
 For <i>Rhodoricke</i>, whose surname shalbe Great,<br>
 Shall of him selfe a braue ensample shew,<br>
 That Saxon kings his friendship shall intreat;<br>
 And <i>Howell Dha</i> shall goodly well indew<br>
 The saluage minds with skill of iust and trew;<br>
 Then <i>Griffyth Conan</i> also shall vp reare<br>
 His dreaded head, and the old sparkes renew<br>
 Of natiue courage, that his foes shall feare,<br>
 Least backe againe the kingdome he from them should beare.</p><p>
 
 Ne shall the Saxons selues all peaceably<br>
 Enioy the crowne, which they from Britons wonne<br>
 First ill, and after ruled wickedly:<br>
 For ere two hundred yeares be full outronne,<br>
 There shall a Rauen far from rising Sunne,<br>
 With his wide wings vpon them fiercely fly,<br>
 And bid his faithlesse chickens ouerronne<br>
 The fruitfull plaines, and with fell cruelty,<br>
 In their auenge, tread downe the victours surquedry.</p><p>
 
 Yet shall a third both these, and thine subdew;<br>
 There shall a Lyon from the sea-bord wood<br>
 Of <i>Neustria</i> come roring, with a crew<br>
 Of hungry whelpes, his battailous bold brood,<br>
 Whose clawes were newly dipt in cruddy blood,<br>
 That from the Daniske Tyrants head shall rend<br>
 Th'vsurped crowne, as if that he were wood,<br>
 And the spoile of the countrey conquered<br>
 Emongst his young ones shall diuide with bountyhed.</p><p>
 
 Tho when the terme is full accomplishid,<br>
 There shall a sparke of fire, which hath long-while<br>
 Bene in his ashes raked vp, and hid,<br>
 Be freshly kindled in the fruitfull Ile<br>
 Of <i>Mona</i>, where it lurked in exile;<br>
 Which shall breake forth into bright burning flame,<br>
 And reach into the house, that beares the stile<br>
 Of royall maiesty and soueraigne name;<br>
 So shall the Briton bloud their crowne againe reclame.</p><p>
 
 Thenceforth eternall vnion shall be made<br>
 Betweene the nations different afore,<br>
 And sacred Peace shall louingly perswade<br>
 The warlike minds, to learne her goodly lore,<br>
 And ciuile armes to exercise no more:<br>
 Then shall a royall virgin raine, which shall<br>
 Stretch her white rod ouer the <i>Belgicke</i> shore,<br>
 And the great Castle smite so sore with all,<br>
 That it shall make him shake, and shortly learne to fall.</p><p>
 
 But yet the end is not.  There <i>Merlin</i> stayd,<br>
 As ouercomen of the spirites powre,<br>
 Or other ghastly spectacle dismayd,<br>
 That secretly he saw, yet note discoure:<br>
 Which suddein fit, and halfe extatick stoure<br>
 When the two fearefull women saw, they grew<br>
 Greatly confused in behauioure;<br>
 At last the fury past, to former hew<br>
 Hee turnd againe, and chearefull looks as earst did shew.</p><p>
 
 Then, when them selues they well instructed had<br>
 Of all, that needed them to be inquird,<br>
 They both conceiuing hope of comfort glad,<br>
 With lighter hearts vnto their home retird;<br>
 Where they in secret counsell close conspird,<br>
 How to effect so hard an enterprize,<br>
 And to possesse the purpose they desird:<br>
 Now this, now that twixt them they did deuise,<br>
 And diuerse plots did frame, to maske in strange disguise.</p><p>
 
 At last the Nourse in her foolhardy wit<br>
 Conceiu'd a bold deuise, and thus bespake;<br>
 Daughter, I deeme that counsell aye most fit,<br>
 That of the time doth dew aduauntage take;<br>
 Ye see that good king <i>Vther</i> now doth make<br>
 Strong warre vpon the Paynim brethren, hight<br>
 <i>Octa</i> and <i>Oza</i>, whom he lately brake<br>
 Beside <i>Cayr Verolame</i>, in victorious fight,<br>
 That now all <i>Britanie</i> doth burne in armes bright.</p><p>
 
 That therefore nought our passage may empeach,<br>
 Let vs in feigned armes our selues disguize,<br>
 And our weake hands (whom need new strength shall teach)<br>
 The dreadfull speare and shield to exercize:<br>
 Ne certes daughter that same warlike wize<br>
 I weene, would you misseeme; for ye bene tall,<br>
 And large of limbe, t'atchieue an hard emprize,<br>
 Ne ought ye want, but skill, which practize small<br>
 Will bring, and shortly make you a mayd Martiall.</p><p>
 
 And sooth, it ought your courage much inflame,<br>
 To heare so often, in that royall hous,<br>
 From whence to none inferiour ye came,<br>
 Bards tell of many women valorous<br>
 Which haue full many feats aduenturous<br>
 Performd, in paragone of proudest men:<br>
 The bold <i>Bunduca</i>, whose victorious<br>
 Exploits made <i>Rome</i> to quake, stout <i>Guendolen</i>,<br>
 Renowmed <i>Martia</i>, and redoubted <i>Emmilen</i>.</p><p>
 
 And that, which more then all the rest may sway,<br>
 Late dayes ensample, which these eyes beheld,<br>
 In the last field before <i>Meneuia</i><br>
 Which <i>Vther</i> with those forrein Pagans held,<br>
 I saw a <i>Saxon</i> Virgin, the which feld<br>
 Great <i>Vlfin</i> thrise vpon the bloudy plaine,<br>
 And had not <i>Carados</i> her hand withheld<br>
 From rash reuenge, she had him surely slaine,<br>
 Yet <i>Carados</i> himselfe from her escapt with paine.</p><p>
 
 Ah read, (quoth <i>Britomart</i>) how is she hight?<br>
 Faire <i>Angela</i> (quoth she) men do her call,<br>
 No whit lesse faire, then terrible in fight:<br>
 She hath the leading of a Martiall<br>
 And mighty people, dreaded more then all<br>
 The other <i>Saxons</i>, which do for her sake<br>
 And loue, themselues of her name <i>Angles</i> call.<br>
 Therefore faire Infant her ensample make<br>
 Vnto thy selfe, and equall courage to thee take.</p><p>
 
 Her harty words so deepe into the mynd<br>
 Of the young Damzell sunke, that great desire<br>
 Of warlike armes in her forthwith they tynd,<br>
 And generous stout courage did inspire,<br>
 That she resolu'd, vnweeting to her Sire,<br>
 Aduent'rous knighthood on her selfe to don,<br>
 And counseld with her Nourse, her Maides attire<br>
 To turne into a massy habergeon,<br>
 And bad her all things put in readinesse anon.</p><p>
 
 Th'old woman nought, that needed, did omit;<br>
 But all things did conueniently puruay:<br>
 It fortuned (so time their turne did fit)<br>
 A band of Britons ryding on forray<br>
 Few dayes before, had gotten a great pray<br>
 Of Saxon goods, emongst the which was seene<br>
 A goodly Armour, and full rich aray,<br>
 Which long'd to <i>Angela</i>, the Saxon Queene,<br>
 All fretted round with gold, and goodly well beseene.</p><p>
 
 The same, with all the other ornaments,<br>
 King <i>Ryence</i> caused to be hanged hy<br>
 In his chiefe Church, for endlesse moniments<br>
 Of his successe and gladfull victory:<br>
 Of which her selfe auising readily,<br>
 In th'euening late old <i>Glauce</i> thither led<br>
 Faire <i>Britomart</i>, and that same Armory<br>
 Downe taking, her therein appareled,<br>
 Well as she might, and with braue bauldrick garnished.</p><p>
 
 Beside those armes there stood a mighty speare,<br>
 Which <i>Bladud</i> made by Magick art of yore,<br>
 And vsd the same in battell aye to beare;<br>
 Sith which it had bin here preseru'd in store,<br>
 For his great vertues proued long afore:<br>
 For neuer wight so fast in sell could sit,<br>
 But him perforce vnto the ground it bore:<br>
 Both speare she tooke, and shield, which hong by it:<br>
 Both speare &amp; shield of great powre, for her purpose fit.</p><p>
 
 Thus when she had the virgin all arayd,<br>
 Another harnesse, which did hang thereby,<br>
 About her selfe she dight, that the young Mayd<br>
 She might in equall armes accompany,<br>
 And as her Squire attend her carefully:<br>
 Tho to their ready Steeds they clombe full light,<br>
 And through back wayes, that none might them espy,<br>
 Couered with secret cloud of silent night,<br>
 Themselues they forth conuayd, &amp; passed forward right.</p><p>
 
 Ne rested they, till that to Faery lond<br>
 They came, as <i>Merlin</i> them directed late:<br>
 Where meeting with this <i>Redcrosse</i> knight, she fond<br>
 Of diuerse things discourses to dilate,<br>
 But most of <i>Arthegall</i>, and his estate.<br>
 At last their wayes so fell, that they mote part<br>
 Then each to other well affectionate,<br>
 Friendship professed with vnfained hart,<br>
 The <i>Redcrosse</i> knight diuerst, but forth rode <i>Britomart</i>.</p><p>
