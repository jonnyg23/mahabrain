 </p><blockquote> 
 <i>Guyon findes Mammon in a delue,<br>
 Sunning his threasure hore:<br>
 Is by him tempted, &amp; led downe,<br>
 To see his secret store.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote> 
 
  
 <p>
 </p><blockquote> 
 A
 S Pilot well expert in perilous waue,<br>
 That to a stedfast starre his course hath bent,<br>
 When foggy mistes, or cloudy tempests haue<br>
 The faithfull light of that faire lampe yblent,<br>
 And couer'd heauen with hideous dreriment,<br>
 Vpon his card and compas firmes his eye,<br>
 The maisters of his long experiment,<br>
 And to them does the steddy helme apply,<br>
 Bidding his winged vessell fairely forward fly.<p>
  
 So <i>Guyon</i> hauing lost his trusty guide,<br>
 Late left beyond that <i>Ydle lake</i>, proceedes<br>
 Yet on his way, of none accompanide;<br>
 And euermore himselfe with comfort feedes,<br>
 Of his owne vertues, and prayse-worthy deedes.<br>
 So long he yode, yet no aduenture found,<br>
 Which fame of her shrill trompet worthy reedes:<br>
 For still he traueild through wide wastfull ground,<br>
 That nought but desert wildernesse shew'd all around.</p><p>
  
 At last he came vnto a gloomy glade,<br>
 Couer'd with boughes &amp; shrubs from heauens light,<br>
 Whereas he sitting found in secret shade<br>
 An vncouth, saluage, and vnciuile wight,<br>
 Of griesly hew, and fowle ill fauour'd sight;<br>
 His face with smoke was tand, and eyes were bleard,<br>
 His head and beard with sout were ill bedight,<br>
 His cole-blacke hands did seeme to haue beene seard<br>
 In smithes fire-spitting forge, and nayles like clawes appeard.</p><p>
  
 His yron coate all ouergrowne with rust,<br>
 Was vnderneath enueloped with gold,<br>
 Whose glistring glosse darkned with filthy dust,<br>
 Well it appeared, to haue beene of old<br>
 A worke of rich entayle, and curious mould,<br>
 Wouen with antickes and wild Imagery:<br>
 And in his lap a masse of coyne he told,<br>
 And turned vpsidowne, to feede his eye<br>
 A couetous desire with his huge threasury.</p><p>
  
 And round about him lay on euery side<br>
 Great heapes of gold, that neuer could be spent:<br>
 Of which some were rude owre, not purifide<br>
 Of <i>Mulcibers</i> deuouring element;<br>
 Some others were new driuen, and distent<br>
 Into great Ingoes, and to wedges square;<br>
 Some in round plates withouten moniment;<br>
 But most were stampt, and in their metall bare<br>
 The antique shapes of kings and kesars straunge &amp; rare.</p><p>
  
 Soone as he <i>Guyon</i> saw, in great affright<br>
 And hast he rose, for to remoue aside<br>
 Those pretious hils from straungers enuious sight,<br>
 And downe them poured through an hole full wide,<br>
 Into the hollow earth, them there to hide.<br>
 But <i>Guyon</i> lightly to him leaping, stayd<br>
 His hand, that trembled, as one terrifyde;<br>
 And though him selfe were at the sight dismayd,<br>
 Yet him perforce restraynd, and to him doubtfull sayd.</p><p>
  
 What art thou man, (if man at all thou art)<br>
 That here in desert hast thine habitaunce,<br>
 And these rich heapes of wealth doest hide apart<br>
 From the worldes eye, and from her right vsaunce?<br>
 Thereat with staring eyes fixed askaunce,<br>
 In great disdaine, he answerd; Hardy Elfe,<br>
 That darest vew my direfull countenaunce,<br>
 I read thee rash, and heedlesse of thy selfe,<br>
 To trouble my still seate, and heapes of pretious pelfe.</p><p>
  
 God of the world and worldlings I me call,<br>
 Great <i>Mammon</i>, greatest god below the skye,<br>
 That of my plenty poure out vnto all,<br>
 And vnto none my graces do enuye:<br>
 Riches, renowme, and principality,<br>
 Honour, estate, and all this worldes good,<br>
 For which men swinck and sweat incessantly,<br>
 Fro me do flow into an ample flood,<br>
 And in the hollow earth haue their eternall brood.</p><p>
  
 Wherefore if me thou deigne to serue and sew,<br>
 At thy commaund lo all these mountaines bee;<br>
 Or if to thy great mind, or greedy vew<br>
 All these may not suffise, there shall to thee<br>
 Ten times so much be numbred francke and free.<br>
 <i>Mammon</i> (said he) thy godheades vaunt is vaine,<br>
 And idle offers of thy golden fee;<br>
 To them, that couet such eye-glutting gaine,<br>
 Proffer thy giftes, and fitter seruaunts entertaine.</p><p>
  
 Me ill besits, that in der-doing armes,<br>
 And honours suit my vowed dayes do spend,<br>
 Vnto thy bounteous baytes, and pleasing charmes,<br>
 With which weake men thou witchest, to attend:<br>
 Regard of worldly mucke doth fowly blend,<br>
 And low abase the high heroicke spright,<br>
 That ioyes for crownes and kingdomes to contend;<br>
 Faire shields, gay steedes, bright armes be my delight:<br>
 Those be the riches fit for an aduent'rous knight.</p><p>
  
 Vaine glorious Elfe (said he) doest not thou weet,<br>
 That money can thy wantes at will supply?<br>
 Sheilds, steeds, and armes, &amp; all things for thee meet<br>
 It can puruay in twinckling of an eye;<br>
 And crownes and kingdomes to thee multiply.<br>
 Do not I kings create, and throw the crowne<br>
 Sometimes to him, that low in dust doth ly?<br>
 And him that raignd, into his rowme thrust downe,<br>
 And whom I lust, do heape with glory and renowne?</p><p>
  
 All otherwise (said he) I riches read,<br>
 And deeme them roote of all disquietnesse;<br>
 First got with guile, and then preseru'd with dread,<br>
 And after spent with pride and lauishnesse,<br>
 Leauing behind them griefe and heauinesse.<br>
 Infinite mischiefes of them do arize,<br>
 Strife; and debate, bloudshed, and bitternesse,<br>
 Outrageous wrong, and hellish couetize,<br>
 That noble heart as great dishonour doth despize.</p><p>
  
 Ne thine be kingdomes, ne the scepters thine;<br>
 But realmes and rulers thou doest both confound,<br>
 And loyall truth to treason doest incline;<br>
 Witnesse the guiltlesse bloud pourd oft on ground,<br>
 The crowned often slaine, the slayer cround,<br>
 The sacred Diademe in peeces rent,<br>
 And purple robe gored with many a wound;<br>
 Castles surprizd, great cities sackt and brent:<br>
 So mak'st thou kings, &amp; gaynest wrongfull gouernement.</p><p>
  
 Long were to tell the troublous stormes, that tosse<br>
 The priuate state, and make the life vnsweet:<br>
 Who swelling sayles in Caspian sea doth crosse,<br>
 And in frayle wood on <i>Adrian</i> gulfe doth fleet,<br>
 Doth not, I weene, so many euils meet.<br>
 Then <i>Mammon</i> wexing wroth, And why then, said,<br>
 Are mortall men so fond and vndiscreet,<br>
 So euill thing to seeke vnto their ayd,<br>
 And hauing not complaine, and hauing it vpbraid?</p><p>
  
 Indeede (quoth he) through fowle intemperaunce,<br>
 Frayle men are oft captiu'd to couetise:<br>
 But would they thinke, with how small allowaunce<br>
 Vntroubled Nature doth her selfe suffise,<br>
 Such superfluities they would despise,<br>
 Which with sad cares empeach our natiue ioyes:<br>
 At the well head the purest streames arise:<br>
 But mucky filth his braunching armes annoyes,<br>
 And with vncomely weedes the gentle waue accloyes.</p><p>
  
 The antique world, in his first flowring youth,<br>
 Found no defect in his Creatours grace,<br>
 But with glad thankes, and vnreproued truth,<br>
 The gifts of soueraigne bountie did embrace:<br>
 Like Angels life was then mens happy cace;<br>
 But later ages pride, like corn-fed steed,<br>
 Abusd her plenty, and fat swolne encreace<br>
 To all licentious lust, and gan exceed<br>
 The measure of her meane, and naturall first need.</p><p>
  
 Then gan a cursed hand the quiet wombe<br>
 Of his great G[r]andmother with steele to wound,<br>
 And the hid treasures in her sacred tombe,<br>
 With Sacriledge to dig.  Therein he found<br>
 Fountaines of gold and siluer to abound,<br>
 Of which the matter of his huge desire<br>
 And pompous pride eftsoones he did compound;<br>
 Then auarice gan through his veines inspire<br>
 His greedy flames, and kindled life-deuouring fire.</p><p>
  
 Sonne (said he then) let be thy bitter scorne,<br>
 And leaue the rudenesse of that antique age<br>
 To them, that liu'd therein in state forlorne;<br>
 Thou that doest liue in later times, must wage<br>
 Thy workes for wealth, and life for gold engage.<br>
 If then thee list my offred grace to vse,<br>
 Take what thou please of all this surplusage;<br>
 If thee list not, leaue haue thou to refuse:<br>
 But thing refused, do not afterward accuse.</p><p>
  
 Me list not (said the Elfin knight) receaue<br>
 Thing offred, till I know it well be got,<br>
 Ne wote I, but thou didst these goods bereaue<br>
 From rightfull owner by vnrighteous lot,<br>
 Or that bloud guiltinesse or guile them blot.<br>
 Perdy (quoth he) yet neuer eye did vew,<br>
 Ne toung did tell, ne hand these handled not,<br>
 But safe I haue them kept in secret mew,<br>
 From heauens sight, and powre of all which thẽ pursew.</p><p>
  
 What secret place (quoth he) can safely hold<br>
 So huge a masse, and hide from heauens eye?<br>
 Or where hast thou thy wonne, that so much gold<br>
 Thou canst preserue from wrong and robbery?<br>
 Come thou (quoth he) and see.  So by and by<br>
 Through that thicke couert he him led, and found<br>
 A darkesome way, which no man could descry,<br>
 That deepe descended through the hollow ground,<br>
 And was with dread and horrour compassed around.</p><p>
  
 At length they came into a larger space,<br>
 That stretcht it selfe into an ample plaine,<br>
 Through which a beaten broad high way did trace,<br>
 That streight did lead to <i>Plutoes</i> griesly raine:<br>
 By that wayes side, there sate infernall Payne,<br>
 And fast beside him sat tumultuous Strife:<br>
 The one in hand an yron whip did straine,<br>
 The other brandished a bloudy knife,<br>
 And both did gnash their teeth, &amp; both did threaten life.</p><p>
  
 On thother side in one consort there sate,<br>
 Cruell Reuenge, and rancorous Despight,<br>
 Disloyall Treason, and hart-burning Hate,<br>
 But gnawing Gealosie out of their sight<br>
 Sitting alone, his bitter lips did bight,<br>
 And trembling Feare still to and fro did fly,<br>
 And found no place, where safe he shroud him might,<br>
 Lamenting Sorrow did in darknesse lye,<br>
 And Shame his vgly face did hide from liuing eye.</p><p>
  
 And ouer them sad Horrour with grim hew,<br>
 Did alwayes sore, beating his yron wings;<br>
 And after him Owles and Night-rauens flew,<br>
 The hatefull messengers of heauy things,<br>
 Of death and dolour telling sad tidings;<br>
 Whiles sad <i>Celeno</i>, sitting on a clift,<br>
 A song of bale and bitter sorrow sings,<br>
 That hart of flint a sunder could haue rift:<br>
 Which hauing ended, after him she flyeth swift.</p><p>
  
 All these before the gates of <i>Pluto</i> lay,<br>
 By whom they passing, spake vnto them nought.<br>
 But th'Elfin knight with wonder all the way<br>
 Did feed his eyes, and fild his inner thought.<br>
 At last him to a litle dore he brought,<br>
 That to the gate of Hell, which gaped wide,<br>
 Was next adioyning, ne them parted ought:<br>
 Betwixt them both was but a litle stride,<br>
 That did the house of Richesse from hell-mouth diuide.</p><p>
  
 Before the dore sat selfe-consuming Care,<br>
 Day and night keeping wary watch and ward,<br>
 For feare least Force or Fraud should vnaware<br>
 Breake in, and spoile the treasure there in gard:<br>
 Ne would he suffer Sleepe once thither-ward<br>
 Approch, albe his drowsie den were next;<br>
 For next to death is Sleepe to be compard:<br>
 Therefore his house is vnto his annext;<br>
 Here Sleep, there Richesse, &amp; Hel-gate thẽ both betwext.</p><p>
  
 So soone as <i>Mammon</i> there arriu'd, the dore<br>
 To him did open, and affoorded way;<br>
 Him followed eke Sir <i>Guyon</i> euermore,<br>
 Ne darkenesse him, ne daunger might dismay.<br>
 Soone as he entred was, the dore streight way<br>
 Did shut, and from behind it forth there lept<br>
 An vgly feend, more fowle then dismall day,<br>
 The which with monstrous stalke behind him stept,<br>
 And euer as he went, dew watch vpon him kept.</p><p>
  
 Well hoped he, ere long that hardy guest,<br>
 If euer couetous hand, or lustfull eye,<br>
 Or lips he layd on thing, that likt him best,<br>
 Or euer sleepe his eye-strings did vntye,<br>
 Should be his pray.  And therefore still on hye<br>
 He ouer him did hold his cruell clawes,<br>
 Threatning with greedy gripe to do him dye<br>
 And rend in peeces with his rauenous pawes,<br>
 If euer he transgrest the fatall <i>Stygian</i> lawes.</p><p>
  
 That houses forme within was rude and strong,<br>
 Like an huge caue, hewne out of rocky clift,<br>
 From whose rough vaut the ragged breaches hong,<br>
 Embost with massy gold of glorious gift,<br>
 And with rich metall loaded euery rift,<br>
 That heauy ruine they did seeme to threat;<br>
 And ouer them <i>Arachne</i> high did lift<br>
 Her cunning web, and spred her subtile net,<br>
 Enwrapped in fowle smoke and clouds more blacke then Iet.</p><p>
  
 Both roofe, and floore, and wals were all of gold,<br>
 But ouergrowne with dust and old decay,<br>
 And hid in darkenesse, that none could behold<br>
 The hew thereof: for vew of chearefull day<br>
 Did neuer in that house it selfe display,<br>
 But a faint shadow of vncertain light;<br>
 Such as a lamp, whose life does fade away:<br>
 Or as the Moone cloathed with clowdy night,<br>
 Does shew to him, that walkes in feare and sad affright.</p><p>
  
 In all that rowme was nothing to be seene,<br>
 But huge great yron chests and coffers strong,<br>
 All bard with double bends, that none could weene<br>
 Them to efforce by violence or wrong;<br>
 On euery side they placed were along.<br>
 But all the ground with sculs was scattered,<br>
 And dead mens bones, which round about were flong,<br>
 Whose liues, it seemed, whilome there were shed,<br>
 And their vile carcases now left vnburied.</p><p>
  
 They forward passe, ne <i>Guyon</i> yet spoke word,<br>
 Till that they came vnto an yron dore,<br>
 Which to them opened of his owne accord,<br>
 And shewd of richesse such exceeding store,<br>
 As eye of man did neuer see before;<br>
 Ne euer could within one place be found,<br>
 Though all the wealth, which is, or was of yore,<br>
 Could gathered be through all the world around,<br>
 And that aboue were added to that vnder ground.</p><p>
  
 The charge thereof vnto a couetous Spright<br>
 Commaunded was, who thereby did attend,<br>
 And warily awaited day and night,<br>
 From other couetous feends it to defend,<br>
 Who it to rob and ransacke did intend.<br>
 Then <i>Mammon</i> turning to that warriour, said;<br>
 Loe here the worldes blis, loe here the end,<br>
 To which all men do ayme, rich to be made:<br>
 Such grace now to be happy, is before thee laid.</p><p>
  
 Certes (said he) I n'ill thine offred grace,<br>
 Ne to be made so happy do intend:<br>
 Another blis before mine eyes I place,<br>
 Another happinesse, another end.<br>
 To them, that list, these base regardes I lend:<br>
 But I in armes, and in atchieuements braue,<br>
 Do rather choose my flitting houres to spend,<br>
 And to be Lord of those, that riches haue,<br>
 Then them to haue my selfe, and be their seruile sclaue.</p><p>
  
 Thereat the feend his gnashing teeth did grate,<br>
 And grieu'd, so long to lacke his greedy pray;<br>
 For well he weened, that so glorious bayte<br>
 Would tempt his guest, to take thereof assay:<br>
 Had he so doen, he had him snatcht away,<br>
 More light then Culuer in the Faulcons fist.<br>
 Eternall God thee saue from such decay.<br>
 But whenas <i>Mammon</i> saw his purpose mist,<br>
 Him to entrap vnwares another way he wist.</p><p>
  
 Thence forward he him led, and shortly brought<br>
 Vnto another rowme, whose dore forthright,<br>
 To him did open, as it had beene taught:<br>
 Therein an hundred raunges weren pight,<br>
 And hundred fornaces all burning bright;<br>
 By euery fornace many feends did bide,<br>
 Deformed creatures, horrible in sight,<br>
 And euery feend his busie paines applide,<br>
 To melt the golden metall, ready to be tride.</p><p>
  
 One with great bellowes gathered filling aire,<br>
 And with forst wind the fewell did inflame;<br>
 Another did the dying bronds repaire<br>
 With yron toungs, and sprinckled oft the same<br>
 With liquid waues, fiers <i>Vulcans</i> rage to tame,<br>
 Who maistring them, renewd his former heat;<br>
 Some scumd the drosse, that from the metall came;<br>
 Some stird the molten owre with ladles great;<br>
 And euery one did swincke, and euery one did sweat.</p><p>
  
 But when as earthly wight they present saw,<br>
 Glistring in armes and battailous aray,<br>
 From their whot worke they did themselues withdraw<br>
 To wonder at the sight: for till that day,<br>
 They neuer creature saw, that came that way.<br>
 Their staring eyes sparckling with feruent fire,<br>
 And vgly shapes did nigh the man dismay,<br>
 That were it not for shame, he would retire,<br>
 Till that him thus bespake their soueraigne Lord &amp; sire.</p><p>
  
 Behold, thou Faeries sonne, with mortall eye,<br>
 That liuing eye before did neuer see:<br>
 The thing, that thou didst craue so earnestly,<br>
 To weet, whence all the wealth late shewd by mee,<br>
 Proceeded, lo now is reueald to thee.<br>
 Here is the fountaine of the worldes good:<br>
 Now therefore, if thou wilt enriched bee,<br>
 Auise thee well, and chaunge thy wilfull mood,<br>
 Least thou perhaps hereafter wish, and be withstood.</p><p>
  
 Suffise it then, thou Money God (quoth hee)<br>
 That all thine idle offers I refuse.<br>
 All that I need I haue; what needeth mee<br>
 To couet more, then I haue cause to vse?<br>
 With such vaine shewes thy worldlings vile abuse:<br>
 But giue me leaue to follow mine emprise.<br>
 <i>Mammon</i> was much displeasd, yet no'te he chuse,<br>
 But beare the rigour of his bold mesprise,<br>
 And thence him forward led, him further to entise.</p><p>
  
 He brought him through a darksome narrow strait,<br>
 To a broad gate, all built of beaten gold:<br>
 The gate was open, but therein did wait<br>
 A sturdy villein, striding stiffe and bold,<br>
 As if that highest God defie he would;<br>
 In his right hand an yron club he held,<br>
 But he himselfe was all of golden mould,<br>
 Yet had both life and sence, and well could weld<br>
 That cursed weapon, when his cruell foes he queld.</p><p>
  
 <i>Disdayne</i> he called was, and did disdaine<br>
 To be so cald, and who so did him call:<br>
 Sterne was his looke, and full of stomacke vaine,<br>
 His portaunce terrible, and stature tall,<br>
 Far passing th'hight of men terrestriall;<br>
 Like an huge Gyant of the <i>Titans</i> race,<br>
 That made him scorne all creatures great and small,<br>
 And with his pride all others powre deface:<br>
 More fit amongst blacke fiendes, then men to haue his place.</p><p>
  
 Soone as those glitterand armes he did espye,<br>
 That with their brightnesse made that darknesse light,<br>
 His harmefull club he gan to hurtle hye,<br>
 And threaten batteill to the Faery knight;<br>
 Who likewise gan himselfe to batteill dight,<br>
 Till <i>Mammon</i> did his hasty hand withhold,<br>
 And counseld him abstaine from perilous fight:<br>
 For nothing might abash the villein bold,<br>
 Ne mortall steele emperce his miscreated mould.</p><p>
  
 So hauing him with reason pacifide,<br>
 And the fiers Carle commaunding to forbeare,<br>
 He brought him in.  The rowme was large and wide,<br>
 As it some Gyeld or solemne Temple weare:<br>
 Many great golden pillours did vpbeare<br>
 The massy roofe, and riches huge sustayne,<br>
 And euery pillour decked was full deare<br>
 With crownes and Diademes, &amp; titles vaine,<br>
 Which mortall Princes wore, whiles they on earth did rayne.</p><p>
  
 A route of people there assembled were,<br>
 Of euery sort and nation vnder skye,<br>
 Which with great vprore preaced to draw nere<br>
 To th'vpper part, where was aduaunced hye<br>
 A stately siege of soueraigne maiestye;<br>
 And thereon sat a woman gorgeous gay,<br>
 And richly clad in robes of royaltye,<br>
 That neuer earthly Prince in such aray<br>
 His glory did enhaunce, and pompous pride display.</p><p>
  
 Her face right wondrous faire did seeme to bee,<br>
 That her broad beauties beam great brightnes threw<br>
 Through the dim shade, that all men might it see:<br>
 Yet was not that same her owne natiue hew,<br>
 But wrought by art and counterfetted shew,<br>
 Thereby more louers vnto her to call;<br>
 Nath'lesse most heauenly faire in deed and vew<br>
 She by creation was, till she did fall;<br>
 Thenceforth she sought for helps, to cloke her crime withall.</p><p>
  
 There, as in glistring glory she did sit,<br>
 She held a great gold chaine ylincked well,<br>
 Whose vpper end to highest heauen was knit,<br>
 And lower part did reach to lowest Hell;<br>
 And all that preace did round about her swell,<br>
 To catchen hold of that long chaine, thereby<br>
 To clime aloft, and others to excell:<br>
 That was <i>Ambition</i>, rash desire to sty,<br>
 And euery lincke thereof a step of dignity.</p><p>
  
 Some thought to raise themselues to high degree,<br>
 By riches and vnrighteous reward,<br>
 Some by close shouldring, some by flatteree;<br>
 Others through friends, others for base regard;<br>
 And all by wrong wayes for themselues prepard.<br>
 Those that were vp themselues, kept others low,<br>
 Those that were low themselues, held others hard,<br>
 Ne suffred them to rise or greater grow,<br>
 But euery one did striue his fellow downe to throw.</p><p>
  
 Which whenas <i>Guyon</i> saw, he gan inquire,<br>
 What meant that preace about that Ladies throne,<br>
 And what she was that did so high aspire.<br>
 Him <i>Mammon</i> answered; That goodly one,<br>
 Whom all that folke with such contention,<br>
 Do flocke about, my deare my daughter is;<br>
 Honour and dignitie from her alone,<br>
 Deriued are, and all this worldes blis<br>
 For which ye men do striue: few get, but many mis.</p><p>
  
 And faire <i>Philotime</i> she rightly hight,<br>
 The fairest wight that wonneth vnder skye,<br>
 But that this darksome neather world her light<br>
 Doth dim with horrour and deformitie,<br>
 Worthy of heauen and hye felicitie,<br>
 From whence the gods haue her for enuy thrust:<br>
 But sith thou hast found fauour in mine eye,<br>
 Thy spouse I will her make, if that thou lust,<br>
 That she may thee aduance for workes and merites iust.</p><p>
  
 Gramercy <i>Mammon</i> (said the gentle knight)<br>
 For so great grace and offred high estate;<br>
 But I, that am fraile flesh and earthly wight,<br>
 Vnworthy match for such immortall mate<br>
 My selfe well wote, and mine vnequall fate;<br>
 And were I not, yet is my trouth yplight,<br>
 And loue auowd to other Lady late,<br>
 That to remoue the same I haue no might:<br>
 To chaunge loue causelesse is reproch to warlike knight.</p><p>
  
 <i>Mammon</i> emmoued was with inward wrath;<br>
 Yet forcing it to faine, him forth thence led<br>
 Through griesly shadowes by a beaten path,<br>
 Into a gardin goodly garnished<br>
 With hearbs and fruits, whose kinds mote not be red:<br>
 Not such, as earth out of her fruitfull woomb<br>
 Throwes forth to men, sweet and well sauoured,<br>
 But direfull deadly blacke both leafe and bloom,<br>
 Fit to adorne the dead, and decke the drery toombe.</p><p>
  
 There mournfull <i>Cypresse</i> grew in greatest store,<br>
 And trees of bitter <i>Gall</i>, and <i>Heben</i> sad,<br>
 Dead sleeping <i>Poppy</i>, and blacke <i>Hellebore</i>,<br>
 Cold <i>Coloquintida</i>, and <i>Tetra</i> mad,<br>
 Mortall <i>Samnitis</i>, and <i>Cicuta</i> bad,<br>
 With which th'vniust <i>Atheniens</i> made to dy<br>
 Wise <i>Socrates</i>, who thereof quaffing glad<br>
 Pourd out his life, and last Philosophy<br>
 To the faire <i>Critias</i> his dearest Belamy.</p><p>
  
 The <i>Gardin</i> of <i>Proserpina</i> this hight;<br>
 And in the midst thereof a siluer seat,<br>
 With a thicke Arber goodly ouer dight,<br>
 In which she often vsd from open heat<br>
 Her selfe to shroud, and pleasures to entreat.<br>
 Next thereunto did grow a goodly tree,<br>
 With braunches broad dispred and body great,<br>
 Clothed with leaues, that none the wood mote see<br>
 And loaden all with fruit as thicke as it might bee.</p><p>
  
 Their fruit were golden apples glistring bright,<br>
 That goodly was their glory to behold,<br>
 On earth like neuer grew, ne liuing wight<br>
 Like euer saw, but they from hence were sold;<br>
 For those, which <i>Hercules</i> with conquest bold<br>
 Got from great <i>Atlas</i> daughters, hence began,<br>
 And planted there, did bring forth fruit of gold:<br>
 And those with which th'<i>Eubæan</i> young man wan<br>
 Swift <i>Atalanta</i>, when through craft he her out ran.</p><p>
  
 Here also sprong that goodly golden fruit,<br>
 With which <i>Acontius</i> got his louer trew,<br>
 Whom he had long time sought with fruitlesse suit:<br>
 Here eke that famous golden Apple grew,<br>
 The which emongst the gods false <i>Ate</i> threw;<br>
 For which th'<i>Idæan</i> Ladies disagreed,<br>
 Till partiall <i>Paris</i> dempt it <i>Venus</i> dew,<br>
 And had of her, faire <i>Helen</i> for his meed,<br>
 That many noble <i>Greekes</i> and <i>Troians</i> made to bleed.</p><p>
  
 The warlike Elfe much wondred at this tree,<br>
 So faire and great, that shadowed all the ground,<br>
 And his broad braunches, laden with rich fee,<br>
 Did stretch themselues without the vtmost bound<br>
 Of this great gardin, compast with a mound,<br>
 Which ouer-hanging, they themselues did steepe,<br>
 In a blacke flood which flow'd about it round;<br>
 That is the riuer of <i>Cocytus</i> deepe,<br>
 In which full many soules do endlesse waile and weepe.</p><p>
  
 Which to behold, he clomb vp to the banke,<br>
 And looking downe, saw many damned wights,<br>
 In those sad waues, which direfull deadly stanke,<br>
 Plonged continually of cruell Sprights,<br>
 That with their pitteous cryes, and yelling shrights,<br>
 They made the further shore resounden wide:<br>
 Emongst the rest of those same ruefull sights,<br>
 One cursed creature, he by chaunce espide,<br>
 That drenched lay full deepe, vnder the Garden side.</p><p>
  
 Deepe was he drenched to the vpmost chin,<br>
 Yet gaped still, as coueting to drinke<br>
 Of the cold liquor, which he waded in,<br>
 And stretching forth his hand, did often thinke<br>
 To reach the fruit, which grew vpon the brincke:<br>
 But both the fruit from hand, and floud from mouth<br>
 Did flie abacke, and made him vainely swinke:<br>
 The whiles he steru'd with hunger and with drouth<br>
 He daily dyde, yet neuer throughly dyen couth.</p><p>
  
 The knight him seeing labour so in vaine,<br>
 Askt who he was, and what he ment thereby:<br>
 Who groning deepe, thus answerd him againe;<br>
 Most cursed of all creatures vnder skye,<br>
 Lo <i>Tantalus</i>, I here tormented lye:<br>
 Of whom high <i>Ioue</i> wont whylome feasted bee,<br>
 Lo here I now for want of food doe dye:<br>
 But if that thou be such, as I thee see,<br>
 Of grace I pray thee, giue to eat and drinke to mee.</p><p>
  
 Nay, nay, thou greedie <i>Tantalus</i> (quoth he)<br>
 Abide the fortune of thy present fate,<br>
 And vnto all that liue in high degree,<br>
 Ensample be of mind intemperate,<br>
 To teach them how to vse their present state.<br>
 Then gan the cursed wretch aloud to cry,<br>
 Accusing highest <i>Ioue</i> and gods ingrate,<br>
 And eke blaspheming heauen bitterly,<br>
 As authour of vniustice, there to let him dye.</p><p>
  
 He lookt a little further, and espyde<br>
 Another wretch, whose carkasse deepe was drent<br>
 Within the riuer, which the same did hyde:<br>
 But both his hands most filthy feculent,<br>
 Aboue the water were on high extent,<br>
 And faynd to wash themselues incessantly;<br>
 Yet nothing cleaner were for such intent,<br>
 But rather fowler seemed to the eye;<br>
 So lost his labour vaine and idle industry.</p><p>
  
 The knight him calling, asked who he was,<br>
 Who lifting vp his head, him answerd thus:<br>
 I <i>Pilate</i> am the falsest Iudge, alas,<br>
 And most vniust, that by vnrighteous<br>
 And wicked doome, to Iewes despiteous<br>
 Deliuered vp the Lord of life to die,<br>
 And did acquite a murdrer felonous;<br>
 The whiles my hands I washt in puritie,<br>
 The whiles my soule was soyld with foule iniquitie.</p><p>
  
 Infinite moe, tormented in like paine<br>
 He there beheld, too long here to be told:<br>
 Ne <i>Mammon</i> would there let him long remaine,<br>
 For terrour of the tortures manifold,<br>
 In which the damned soules he did behold,<br>
 But roughly him bespake.  Thou fearefull foole,<br>
 Why takest not of that same fruit of gold,<br>
 Ne sittest downe on that same siluer stoole,<br>
 To rest thy wearie person, in the shadow coole.</p><p>
  
 All which he did, to doe him deadly fall<br>
 In frayle intemperance through sinfull bayt;<br>
 To which if he inclined had at all,<br>
 That dreadfull feend, which did behind him wayt,<br>
 Would him haue rent in thousand peeces strayt:<br>
 But he was warie wise in all his way,<br>
 And well perceiued his deceiptfull sleight,<br>
 Ne suffred lust his safetie to betray;<br>
 So goodly did beguile the Guyler of the pray.</p><p>
  
 And now he has so long remained there,<br>
 That vitall powres gan wexe both weake and wan,<br>
 For want of food, and sleepe, which two vpbeare,<br>
 Like mightie pillours, this fraile life of man,<br>
 That none without the same enduren can.<br>
 For now three dayes of men were full outwrought,<br>
 Since he this hardie enterprize began:<br>
 For thy great <i>Mammon</i> fairely he besought,<br>
 Into the world to guide him backe, as he him brought.</p><p>
  
 The God, though loth, yet was constraind t'obay,<br>
 For lenger time, then that, no liuing wight<br>
 Below the earth, might suffred be to stay:<br>
 So backe againe, him brought to liuing light.<br>
 But all so soone as his enfeebled spright<br>
 Gan sucke this vitall aire into his brest,<br>
 As ouercome with too exceeding might,<br>
 The life did flit away out of her nest,<br>
 And all his senses were with deadly fit opprest.</p><p>
