 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Prince Arthur takes the enterprize<br>
 for Belgee for to fight:<br>
 Gerioneos Seneschall<br>
 he slayes in Belges right.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 S
 Ome Clarkes doe doubt in their deuicefull art,<br>
 Whether this heauenly thing, whereof I treat,<br>
 To weeten <i>Mercie</i>, be of Iustice part,<br>
 Or drawne forth from her by diuine extreate.<br>
 This well I wote, that sure she is as great,<br>
 And meriteth to haue as high a place,<br>
 Sith in th'Almighties euerlasting seat<br>
 She first was bred, and borne of heauenly race;<br>
 From thence pour'd down on men, by influence of grace.<p>
 
 For if that Vertue be of so great might,<br>
 Which from iust verdict will for nothing start,<br>
 But to preserue inuiolated right,<br>
 Oft spilles the principall, to saue the part;<br>
 So much more then is that of powre and art,<br>
 That seekes to saue the subiect of her skill,<br>
 Yet neuer doth from doome of right depart:<br>
 As it is greater prayse to saue, then spill,<br>
 And better to reforme, then to cut off the ill.</p><p>
 
 Who then can thee, <i>Mercilla</i>, throughly prayse,<br>
 That herein doest all earthly Princes pas?<br>
 What heauenly Muse shall thy great honour rayse<br>
 Vp to the skies, whence first deriu'd it was,<br>
 And now on earth it selfe enlarged has,<br>
 From th'vtmost brinke of the <i>Armericke</i> shore,<br>
 Vnto the margent of the <i>Molucas</i>?<br>
 Those Nations farre thy iustice doe adore:<br>
 But thine owne people do thy mercy prayse much more.</p><p>
 
 Much more it praysed was of those two knights;<br>
 The noble Prince, and righteous <i>Artegall</i>,<br>
 When they had seene and heard her doome a rights<br>
 Against <i>Duessa</i>, damned by them all;<br>
 But by her tempred without griefe or gall,<br>
 Till strong constraint did her thereto enforce.<br>
 And yet euen then ruing her wilfull fall,<br>
 With more then needfull naturall remorse,<br>
 And yeelding the last honour to her wretched corse.</p><p>
 
 During all which, those knights continu'd there,<br>
 Both doing and receiuing curtesies,<br>
 Of that great Ladie, who with goodly chere<br>
 Them entertayn'd, fit for their dignities,<br>
 Approuing dayly to their noble eyes<br>
 Royall examples of her mercies rare,<br>
 And worthie paterns of her clemencies;<br>
 Which till this day mongst many liuing are,<br>
 Who them to their posterities doe still declare.</p><p>
 
 Amongst the rest, which in that space befell,<br>
 There came two Springals of full tender yeares,<br>
 Farre thence from forrein land, where they did dwell,<br>
 To seeke for succour of her and of her Peares<br>
 With humble prayers and intreatfull teares;<br>
 Sent by their mother, who a widow was,<br>
 Wrapt in great dolours and in deadly feares,<br>
 By a strong Tyrant, who inuaded has<br>
 Her land, and slaine her children ruefully alas.</p><p>
 
 Her name was <i>Belgæ</i>, who in former age<br>
 A Ladie of great worth and wealth had beene,<br>
 And mother of a frutefull heritage,<br>
 Euen seuenteene goodly sonnes; which who had seene<br>
 In their first flowre, before this fatall teene<br>
 Them ouertooke, and their faire blossomes blasted,<br>
 More happie mother would her surely weene,<br>
 Then famous <i>Niobe</i>, before she tasted<br>
 <i>Latonaes</i> childrens wrath, that all her issue wasted.</p><p>
 
 But this fell Tyrant, through his tortious powre,<br>
 Had left her now but fiue of all that brood:<br>
 For twelue of them he did by times deuoure,<br>
 And to his Idols sacrifice their blood,<br>
 Whylest he of none was stopped, nor withstood.<br>
 For soothly he was one of matchlesse might,<br>
 Of horrible aspect, and dreadfull mood,<br>
 And had three bodies in one wast empight,<br>
 And th'armes and legs of three, to succour him in fight.</p><p>
 
 And sooth they say, that he was borne and bred<br>
 Of Gyants race, the sonne of <i>Geryon</i>,<br>
 He that whylome in Spaine so sore was dred,<br>
 For his huge powre and great oppression,<br>
 Which brought that land to his subiection,<br>
 Through his three bodies powre, in one combynd;<br>
 And eke all strangers in that region<br>
 Arryuing, to his kyne for food assynd;<br>
 The fayrest kyne aliue, but of the fiercest kynd.</p><p>
 
 For they were all, they say, of purple hew,<br>
 Kept by a cowheard, hight <i>Eurytion</i>,<br>
 A cruell carle, the which all strangers slew,<br>
 Ne day nor night did sleepe, t'attend them on,<br>
 But walkt about them euer and anone,<br>
 With his two headed dogge, that <i>Orthrus</i> hight;<br>
 <i>Orthrus</i> begotten by great <i>Typhaon</i>,<br>
 And foule <i>Echidna</i>, in the house of night;<br>
 But <i>Hercules</i> them all did ouercome in fight.</p><p>
 
 His sonne was this, <i>Geryoneo</i> hight,<br>
 Who after that his monstrous father fell<br>
 Vnder <i>Alcides</i> club, streight tooke his flight<br>
 From that sad land, where he his syre did quell,<br>
 And came to this, where <i>Belge</i> then did dwell,<br>
 And flourish in all wealth and happinesse,<br>
 Being then new made widow (as befell)<br>
 After her Noble husbands late decesse;<br>
 Which gaue beginning to her woe and wretchednesse.</p><p>
 
 Then this bold Tyrant, of her widowhed<br>
 Taking aduantage, and her yet fresh woes,<br>
 Himselfe and seruice to her offered,<br>
 Her to defend against all forrein foes,<br>
 That should their powre against her right oppose.<br>
 Whereof she glad, now needing strong defence,<br>
 Him entertayn'd, and did her champion chose:<br>
 Which long he vsd with carefull diligence,<br>
 The better to confirme her fearelesse confidence.</p><p>
 
 By meanes whereof, she did at last commit<br>
 All to his hands, and gaue him soueraine powre<br>
 To doe, what euer he thought good or fit.<br>
 Which hauing got, he gan forth from that howre<br>
 To stirre vp strife, and many a Tragicke stowre,<br>
 Giuing her dearest children one by one<br>
 Vnto a dreadfull Monster to deuoure,<br>
 And setting vp an Idole of his owne,<br>
 The image of his monstrous parent <i>Geryone</i>.</p><p>
 
 So tyrannizing, and oppressing all,<br>
 The woefull widow had no meanes now left,<br>
 But vnto gratious great <i>Mercilla</i> call<br>
 For ayde, against that cruell Tyrants theft,<br>
 Ere all her children he from her had reft.<br>
 Therefore these two, her eldest sonnes she sent,<br>
 To seeke for succour of this Ladies gieft:<br>
 To whom their sute they humbly did present,<br>
 In th'hearing of full many Knights and Ladies gent.</p><p>
 
 Amongst the which then fortuned to bee<br>
 The noble Briton Prince, with his braue Peare;<br>
 Who when he none of all those knights did see<br>
 Hastily bent, that enterprise to heare,<br>
 Nor vndertake the same, for cowheard feare,<br>
 He stepped forth with courage bold and great,<br>
 Admyr'd of all the rest in presence there,<br>
 And humbly gan that mightie Queene entreat,<br>
 To graunt him that aduenture for his former feat.</p><p>
 
 She gladly graunted it: then he straight way<br>
 Himselfe vnto his iourney gan prepare,<br>
 And all his armours readie dight that day,<br>
 That nought the morrow next mote stay his fare.<br>
 The morrow next appear'd, with purple hayre<br>
 Yet dropping fresh out of the <i>Indian</i> fount,<br>
 And bringing light into the heauens fayre,<br>
 When he was readie to his steede to mount<br>
 Vnto his way, which now was all his care and count.</p><p>
 
 Then taking humble leaue of that great Queene,<br>
 Who gaue him roiall giftes and riches rare,<br>
 As tokens of her thankefull mind beseene,<br>
 And leauing <i>Artegall</i> to his owne care;<br>
 Vpon his voyage forth he gan to fare,<br>
 With those two gentle youthes, which him did guide,<br>
 And all his way before him still prepare.<br>
 Ne after him did <i>Artegall</i> abide,<br>
 But on his first aduenture forward forth did ride.</p><p>
 
 It was not long, till that the Prince arriued<br>
 Within the land, where dwelt that Ladie sad,<br>
 Whereof that Tyrant had her now depriued,<br>
 And into moores and marshes banisht had,<br>
 Out of the pleasant soyle, and citties glad,<br>
 In which she wont to harbour happily:<br>
 But now his cruelty so sore she drad,<br>
 That to those fennes for fastnesse she did fly,<br>
 And there her selfe did hyde from his hard tyranny.</p><p>
 
 There he her found in sorrow and dismay,<br>
 All solitarie without liuing wight;<br>
 For all her other children, through affray,<br>
 Had hid themselues, or taken further flight:<br>
 And eke her selfe through sudden strange affright,<br>
 When one in armes she saw, began to fly;<br>
 But when her owne two sonnes she had in sight,<br>
 She gan take hart, and looke vp ioyfully:<br>
 For well she wist this knight came, succour to supply.</p><p>
 
 And running vnto them with greedy ioyes,<br>
 Fell straight about their neckes, as they did kneele,<br>
 And bursting forth in teares; Ah my sweet boyes,<br>
 (Sayd she) yet now I gin new life to feele,<br>
 And feeble spirits, that gan faint and reele,<br>
 Now rise againe, at this your ioyous sight.<br>
 Alreadie seemes that fortunes headlong wheele<br>
 Begins to turne, and sunne to shine more bright,<br>
 Then it was wont, through comfort of this noble knight.</p><p>
 
 Then turning vnto him; And you Sir knight<br>
 (Said she) that taken haue this toylesome paine<br>
 For wretched woman, miserable wight,<br>
 May you in heauen immortall guerdon gaine<br>
 For so great trauell, as you doe sustaine:<br>
 For other meede may hope for none of mee,<br>
 To whom nought else, but bare life doth remaine,<br>
 And that so wretched one, as ye do see<br>
 Is liker lingring death, then loathed life to bee.</p><p>
 
 Much was he moued with her piteous plight,<br>
 And low dismounting from his loftie steede,<br>
 Gan to recomfort her all that he might,<br>
 Seeking to driue away deepe rooted dreede,<br>
 With hope of helpe in that her greatest neede.<br>
 So thence he wished her with him to wend,<br>
 Vnto some place, where they mote rest and feede,<br>
 And she take comfort, which God now did send:<br>
 Good hart in euils doth the euils much amend.</p><p>
 
 Ay me (sayd she) and whether shall I goe?<br>
 Are not all places full of forraine powres?<br>
 My pallaces possessed of my foe,<br>
 My cities sackt, and their sky-threating towres<br>
 Raced, and made smooth fields now full of flowres?<br>
 Onely these marishes, and myrie bogs,<br>
 In which the fearefull ewftes do build their bowres,<br>
 Yeeld me an hostry mongst the croking frogs,<br>
 And harbour here in safety from those rauenous dogs.</p><p>
 
 Nathlesse (said he) deare Ladie with me goe,<br>
 Some place shall vs receiue, and harbour yield;<br>
 If not, we will it force, maugre your foe,<br>
 And purchase it to vs with speare and shield:<br>
 And if all fayle, yet farewell open field:<br>
 The earth to all her creatures lodging lends.<br>
 With such his chearefull speaches he doth wield<br>
 Her mind so well, that to his will she bends<br>
 And bynding vp her locks and weeds, forth with him wends.</p><p>
 
 They came vnto a Citie farre vp land,<br>
 The which whylome that Ladies owne had bene;<br>
 But now by force extort out of her hand,<br>
 By her strong foe, who had defaced cleene<br>
 Her stately towres, and buildings sunny sheene;<br>
 Shut vp her hauen, mard her marchants trade,<br>
 Robbed her people, that full rich had beene,<br>
 And in her necke a Castle huge had made,<br>
 The which did her cõmaund, without needing perswade.</p><p>
 
 That Castle was the strength of all that state,<br>
 Vntill that state by strength was pulled downe,<br>
 And that same citie, so now ruinate,<br>
 Had bene the keye of all that kingdomes crowne;<br>
 Both goodly Castle, and both goodly Towne,<br>
 Till that th'offended heauens list to lowre<br>
 Vpon their blisse, and balefull fortune frowne.<br>
 When those gainst states and kingdomes do coniure,<br>
 Who then can thinke their hedlong ruine to recure.</p><p>
 
 But he had brought it now in seruile bond,<br>
 And made it beare the yoke of inquisition,<br>
 Stryuing long time in vaine it to withstond;<br>
 Yet glad at last to make most base submission,<br>
 And life enioy for any composition.<br>
 So now he hath new lawes and orders new<br>
 Imposd on it, with many a hard condition,<br>
 And forced it, the honour that is dew<br>
 To God, to doe vnto his Idole most vntrew.</p><p>
 
 To him he hath, before this Castle greene,<br>
 Built a faire Chappell, and an Altar framed<br>
 Of costly Iuory, full rich beseene,<br>
 On which that cursed Idole farre proclamed,<br>
 He hath set vp, and him his God hath named;<br>
 Offring to him in sinfull sacrifice<br>
 The flesh of men, to Gods owne likenesse framed,<br>
 And powring forth their bloud in brutishe wize,<br>
 That any yron eyes to see it would agrize.</p><p>
 
 And for more horror and more crueltie,<br>
 Vnder that cursed Idols altar stone;<br>
 An hideous monster doth in darknesse lie,<br>
 Whose dreadfull shape was neuer seene of none<br>
 That liues on earth; but vnto those alone<br>
 The which vnto him sacrificed bee.<br>
 Those he deuoures, they say, both flesh and bone:<br>
 What else they haue, is all the Tyrants fee;<br>
 So that no whit of them remayning one may see.</p><p>
 
 There eke he placed a strong garrisone,<br>
 And set a Seneschall of dreaded might,<br>
 That by his powre oppressed euery one,<br>
 And vanquished all ventrous knights in fight;<br>
 To whom he wont shew all the shame he might,<br>
 After that them in battell he had wonne.<br>
 To which when now they gan approch in sight,<br>
 The Ladie counseld him the place to shonne,<br>
 Whereas so many knights had fouly bene fordonne.</p><p>
 
 Her fearefull speaches nought he did regard,<br>
 But ryding streight vnder the Castle wall,<br>
 Called aloud vnto the watchfull ward,<br>
 Which there did wayte, willing them forth to call<br>
 Into the field their Tyrants Seneschall.<br>
 To whom when tydings thereof came, he streight<br>
 Cals for his armes, and arming him withall,<br>
 Eftsoones forth pricked proudly in his might,<br>
 And gan with courage fierce addresse him to the fight.</p><p>
 
 They both encounter in the middle plaine,<br>
 And their sharpe speares doe both together smite<br>
 Amid their shields, with so huge might and maine,<br>
 That seem'd their soules they wold haue ryuen quight<br>
 Out of their breasts, with furious despight.<br>
 Yet could the Seneschals no entrance find<br>
 Into the Princes shield, where it empight;<br>
 So pure the mettall was, and well refynd,<br>
 But shiuered all about, and scattered in the wynd.</p><p>
 
 Not so the Princes, but with restlesse force,<br>
 Into his shield it readie passage found,<br>
 Both through his haberieon, and eke his corse:<br>
 Which tombling downe vpon the senselesse ground,<br>
 Gaue leaue vnto his ghost from thraldome bound,<br>
 To wander in the griesly shades of night.<br>
 There did the Prince him leaue in deadly swound,<br>
 And thence vnto the castle marched right,<br>
 To see if entrance there as yet obtaine he might.</p><p>
 
 But as he nigher drew, three knights he spyde,<br>
 All arm'd to point, issuing forth a pace,<br>
 Which towards him with all their powre did ryde,<br>
 And meeting him right in the middle race,<br>
 Did all their speares attonce on him enchace.<br>
 As three great Culuerings for battrie bent,<br>
 And leueld all against one certaine place,<br>
 Doe all attonce their thunders rage forth rent,<br>
 That makes the wals to stagger with astonishment:</p><p>
 
 So all attonce they on the Prince did thonder;<br>
 Who from his saddle swarued nought asyde,<br>
 Ne to their force gaue way, that was great wonder,<br>
 But like a bulwarke, firmely did abyde;<br>
 Rebutting him, which in the midst did ryde,<br>
 With so huge rigour, that his mortall speare<br>
 Past through his shield, &amp; pierst through either syde,<br>
 That downe he fell vppon his mother deare,<br>
 And powred forth his wretched life in deadly dreare.</p><p>
 
 Whom when his other fellowes saw, they fled<br>
 As fast as feete could carry them away;<br>
 And after them the Prince as swiftly sped,<br>
 To be aueng'd of their vnknightly play.<br>
 There whilest they entring, th'one did th'other stay,<br>
 The hindmost in the gate he ouerhent,<br>
 And as he pressed in, him there did slay:<br>
 His carkasse tumbling on the threshold, sent<br>
 His groning soule vnto her place of punishment.</p><p>
 
 The other which was entred, laboured fast<br>
 To sperre the gate; but that same lumpe of clay,<br>
 Whose grudging ghost was thereout fled and past,<br>
 Right in the middest of the threshold lay,<br>
 That it the Posterne did from closing stay:<br>
 The whiles the Prince hard preased in betweene,<br>
 And entraunce wonne. Streight th'other fled away,<br>
 And ran into the Hall, where he did weene<br>
 Him selfe to saue: but he there slew him at the skreene.</p><p>
 
 Then all the rest which in that Castle were,<br>
 Seeing that sad ensample them before,<br>
 Durst not abide, but fled away for feare,<br>
 And them conuayd out at a Posterne dore.<br>
 Long sought the Prince, but when he found no more<br>
 T'oppose against his powre, he forth issued<br>
 Vnto that Lady, where he her had lore,<br>
 And her gan cheare, with what she there had vewed,<br>
 And what she had not seene, within vnto her shewed.</p><p>
 
 Who with right humble thankes him goodly greeting,<br>
 For so great prowesse, as he there had proued,<br>
 Much greater then was euer in her weeting,<br>
 With great admiraunce inwardly was moued,<br>
 And honourd him, with all that her behoued.<br>
 Thenceforth into that Castle he her led,<br>
 With her two sonnes, right deare of her beloued,<br>
 Where all that night them selues they cherished,<br>
 And from her balefull minde all care he banished.</p><p>
