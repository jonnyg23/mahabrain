 <i>Arthur and Artegall catch Guyle<br>
 whom Talus doth dismay,<br>
 They to Mercillaes pallace come,<br>
 and see her rich array.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 W
 Hat Tygre, or what other saluage wight<br>
 Is so exceeding furious and fell,<br>
 As Wrong, when it hath arm'd it selfe with might?<br>
 Not fit mongst men, that doe with reason mell,<br>
 But mongst wyld beasts and saluage woods to dwell;<br>
 Where still the stronger doth the weake deuoure,<br>
 And they that most in boldnesse doe excell,<br>
 Are dreadded most, and feared for their powre:<br>
 Fit for <i>Adicia</i>, there to build her wicked bowre.<p>
 
 There let her wonne farre from resort of men,<br>
 Where righteous <i>Artegall</i> her late exyled;<br>
 There let her euer keepe her damned den,<br>
 Where none may be with her lewd parts defyled,<br>
 Nor none but beasts may be of her despoyled:<br>
 And turne we to the noble Prince, where late<br>
 We did him leaue, after that he had foyled<br>
 The cruell Souldan, and with dreadfull fate<br>
 Had vtterly subuerted his vnrighteous state.</p><p>
 
 Where hauing with Sir <i>Artegall</i> a space<br>
 Well solast in that Souldans late delight,<br>
 They both resoluing now to leaue the place,<br>
 Both it and all the wealth therein behight<br>
 Vnto that Damzell in her Ladies right,<br>
 And so would haue departed on their way.<br>
 But she them woo'd by all the meanes she might,<br>
 And earnestly besought, to wend that day<br>
 With her, to see her Ladie thence no farre away.</p><p>
 
 By whose entreatie both they ouercommen,<br>
 Agree to goe with her, and by the way,<br>
 (As often falles) of sundry things did commen.<br>
 Mongst which that Damzell did to them bewray<br>
 A straunge aduenture, which not farre thence lay;<br>
 To weet a wicked villaine, bold and stout,<br>
 Which wonned in a rocke not farre away,<br>
 That robbed all the countrie there about,<br>
 And brought the pillage home, whence none could get it out.</p><p>
 
 Thereto both his owne wylie wit, (she sayd)<br>
 And eke the fastnesse of his dwelling place,<br>
 Both vnassaylable, gaue him great ayde:<br>
 For he so crafty was to forge and face,<br>
 So light of hand, and nymble of his pace,<br>
 So smooth of tongue, and subtile in his tale.<br>
 That could deceiue one looking in his face;<br>
 Therefore by name <i>Malengin</i> they him call,<br>
 Well knowen by his feates, and famous ouer all.</p><p>
 
 Through these his slights he many doth confound,<br>
 And eke the rocke, in which he wonts to dwell,<br>
 Is wondrous strong, and hewen farre vnder ground<br>
 A dreadfull depth, how deepe no man can tell;<br>
 But some doe say, it goeth downe to hell.<br>
 And all within, it full of wyndings is,<br>
 And hidden wayes, that scarse an hound by smell<br>
 Can follow out those false footsteps of his,<br>
 Ne none can backe returne, that once are gone amis.</p><p>
 
 Which when those knights had heard, their harts gan earne,<br>
 To vnderstand that villeins dwelling place,<br>
 And greatly it desir'd of her to learne,<br>
 And by which way they towards it should trace.<br>
 Were not (sayd she) that it should let your pace<br>
 Towards my Ladies presence by you ment,<br>
 I would you guyde directly to the place.<br>
 Then let not that (said they) stay your intent;<br>
 For neither will one foot, till we that carle haue hent.</p><p>
 
 So froth they past, till they apporched ny<br>
 Vnto the rocke, where was the villains won:<br>
 Which when the Damzell neare at hand did spy,<br>
 She warn'd the knights thereof: who thereupon<br>
 Gan to aduize, what best were to be done.<br>
 So both agreed, to send that mayd afore,<br>
 Where she might sit nigh to the den alone,<br>
 Wayling, and raysing pittifull vprore,<br>
 As if she did some great calamitie deplore.</p><p>
 
 With noyse whereof when as the caytiue carle<br>
 Should issue forth, in hope to find some spoyle,<br>
 They in awayt would closely him ensnarle,<br>
 Ere to his den he backward could recoyle,<br>
 And so would hope him easily to foyle.<br>
 The Damzell straight went, as she was directed,<br>
 Vnto the rocke, and there vpon the soyle<br>
 Hauing her selfe in wretched wize abiected,<br>
 Gan weepe and wayle, as if great griefe had her affected.</p><p>
 
 The cry whereof entring the hollow caue,<br>
 Eftsoones brought forth the villaine, as they ment,<br>
 With hope of her some wishfull boot to haue.<br>
 Full dreadfull wight he was, as euer went<br>
 Vpon the earth, with hollow eyes deepe pent,<br>
 And long curld locks, that downe his shoulders shagged,<br>
 And on his backe an vncouth vestiment<br>
 Made of straunge stuffe, but all to worne and ragged,<br>
 And vnderneath his breech was all to torne and iagged.</p><p>
 
 And in his hand an huge long staffe he held,<br>
 Whose top was arm'd with many an yron hooke,<br>
 Fit to catch hold of all that he could weld,<br>
 Or in the compasse of his clouches tooke;<br>
 And euer round about he cast his looke.<br>
 Als at his backe a great wyde net he bore,<br>
 With which he seldome fished at the brooke,<br>
 But vsd to fish for fooles on the dry shore,<br>
 Of which he in faire weather wont to take great store.</p><p>
 
 Him when the damzell saw fast by her side,<br>
 So vgly creature, she was nigh dismayd,<br>
 And now for helpe aloud in earnest cride.<br>
 But when the villaine saw her so affrayd,<br>
 He gan with guilefull words her to perswade,<br>
 To banish feare, and with <i>Sardonian</i> smyle<br>
 Laughing on her, his false intent to shade,<br>
 Gan forth to lay his bayte her to beguyle,<br>
 That from her self vnwares he might her steale the whyle.</p><p>
 
 Like as the fouler on his guilefull pype<br>
 Charmes to the birds full many a pleasant lay,<br>
 That they the whiles may take lesse heedie keepe,<br>
 How he his nets doth for their ruine lay:<br>
 So did the villaine to her prate and play,<br>
 And many pleasant trickes before her show,<br>
 To turne her eyes from his intent away:<br>
 For he in slights and iugling feates did flow,<br>
 And of legierdemayne the mysteries did know.</p><p>
 
 To which whilest she lent her intentiue mind,<br>
 He suddenly his net vpon her threw,<br>
 That ouersprad her like a puffe of wind;<br>
 And snatching her soone vp, ere well she knew,<br>
 Ran with her fast away vnto his mew,<br>
 Crying for helpe aloud.  But when as ny<br>
 He came vnto his caue, and there did vew<br>
 The armed knights stopping his passage by,<br>
 He threw his burden downe, and fast away did fly.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Artegall</i> him after did pursew,<br>
 The whiles the Prince there kept the entrance still:<br>
 Vp to the rocke he ran, and thereon flew<br>
 Like a wyld Gote, leaping from hill to hill,<br>
 And dauncing on the craggy cliffes at will;<br>
 That deadly daunger seem'd in all mens sight,<br>
 To tempt such steps, where footing was so ill:<br>
 Ne ought auayled for the armed knight,<br>
 To thinke to follow him, that was so swift and light.</p><p>
 
 Which when he saw, his yron man he sent,<br>
 To follow him; for he was swift in chace.<br>
 He him pursewd, where euer that he went,<br>
 Both ouer rockes, and hilles, and euery place,<br>
 Where so he fled, he followd him apace:<br>
 So that he shortly forst him to forsake<br>
 The hight, and downe descend vnto the base.<br>
 There he him courst a fresh, and soone did make<br>
 To leaue his proper forme, and other shape to take.</p><p>
 
 Into a Foxe himselfe he first did tourne;<br>
 But he him hunted like a Foxe full fast:<br>
 Then to a bush himselfe he did transforme,<br>
 But he the bush did beat, till that at last<br>
 Into a bird it chaung'd, and from him past,<br>
 Flying from tree to tree, from wand to wand:<br>
 But he then stones at it so long did cast,<br>
 That like a stone it fell vpon the land,<br>
 But he then tooke it vp, and held fast in his hand.</p><p>
 
 So he it brought with him vnto the knights,<br>
 And to his Lord Sir <i>Artegall</i> it lent,<br>
 Warning him hold it fast, for feare of slights.<br>
 Who whilest in hand it gryping hard he hent,<br>
 Into a Hedgehogge all vnwares it went,<br>
 And prickt him so, that he away it threw.<br>
 Then gan it runne away incontinent,<br>
 Being returned to his former hew:<br>
 But <i>Talus</i> soone him ouertooke, and backward drew.</p><p>
 
 But when as he would to a snake againe<br>
 Haue turn'd himselfe, he with his yron flayle<br>
 Gan driue at him, with so huge might and maine,<br>
 That all his bones, as small as sandy grayle<br>
 He broke, and did his bowels disentrayle;<br>
 Crying in vaine for helpe, when helpe was past.<br>
 So did deceipt the selfe deceiuer fayle,<br>
 There they him left a carrion outcast;<br>
 For beasts and foules to feede vpon for their repast.</p><p>
 
 Thence forth they passed with that gentle Mayd,<br>
 To see her Ladie, as they did agree.<br>
 To which when she approched, thus she sayd;<br>
 Loe now, right noble knights, arriu'd ye bee<br>
 Nigh to the place, which ye desir'd to see:<br>
 There shall ye see my souerayne Lady Queene<br>
 Most sacred wight, most debonayre and free,<br>
 That euer yet vpon this earth was seene,<br>
 Or that with Diademe hath euer crowned beene.</p><p>
 
 The gentle knights reioyced much to heare<br>
 The prayses of that Prince so manifold:<br>
 And passing litle further, commen were,<br>
 Where they a stately pallace did behold,<br>
 Of pompous show, much more then she had told;<br>
 With many towres, and tarras mounted hye,<br>
 And all their tops bright glistering with gold,<br>
 That seemed to outshine the dimmed skye,<br>
 And with their brightnesse daz'd the straunge beholders eye.</p><p>
 
 There they alighting, by that Damzell were<br>
 Directed in, and shewed all the sight:<br>
 Whose porch, that most magnificke did appeare,<br>
 Stood open wyde to all men day and night;<br>
 Yet warded well by one of mickle might,<br>
 That sate thereby, with gyantlike resemblance,<br>
 To keepe out guyle, and malice, and despight,<br>
 That vnder shew oftimes of fayned semblance,<br>
 Are wont in Princes courts to worke great scath and hindrance.</p><p>
 
 His name was <i>Awe</i>; by whom they passing in<br>
 Went vp the hall, that was a large wyde roome,<br>
 All full of people making troublous din,<br>
 And wondrous noyse, as if that there were some,<br>
 Which vnto them was dealing righteous doome.<br>
 By whom they passing, through the thickest preasse,<br>
 The marshall of the hall to them did come;<br>
 His name hight <i>Order</i>, who commaunding peace,<br>
 Them guyded through the throng, that did their clamors ceasse.</p><p>
 
 They ceast their clamors vpon them to gaze;<br>
 Whom seeing all in armour bright as day,<br>
 Straunge there to see, it did them much amaze,<br>
 And with vnwonted terror halfe affray,<br>
 For neuer saw they there the like array.<br>
 Ne euer was the name of warre there spoken,<br>
 But ioyous peace and quietnesse alway,<br>
 Dealing iust iudgements, that mote not be broken<br>
 For any brybes, or threates of any to be wroken.</p><p>
 
 There as they entred at the Scriene, they saw<br>
 Some one, whose tongue was for his trespasse vyle<br>
 Nayld to a post, adiudged so by law:<br>
 For that therewith he falsely did reuyle,<br>
 And foule blaspheme that Queene for forged guyle,<br>
 Both with bold speaches, which he blazed had,<br>
 And with lewd poems, which he did compyle;<br>
 For the bold title of a Poet bad<br>
 He on himselfe had ta'en, and rayling rymes had sprad.</p><p>
 
 Thus there he stood, whylest high ouer his head,<br>
 There written was the purport of his sin,<br>
 In cyphers strange, that few could rightly read,<br>
 BON FONT: but <i>bon</i> that once had written bin,<br>
 Was raced out, and <i>Mal</i> was now put in.<br>
 So now <i>Malfont</i> was plainely to be red;<br>
 Eyther for th'euill, which he did therein,<br>
 Or that he likened was to a welhed<br>
 Of euill words, and wicked sclaunders by him shed.</p><p>
 
 They passing by, were guyded by degree<br>
 Vnto the presence of that gratious Queene:<br>
 Who sate on high, that she might all men see,<br>
 And might of all men royally be seene:<br>
 Vpon a throne of gold full bright and sheene,<br>
 Adorned all with gemmes of endlesse price,<br>
 As either might for wealth haue gotten bene,<br>
 Or could be fram'd by workmans rare deuice;<br>
 And all embost with Lyons and with Flourdelice.</p><p>
 
 All ouer her a cloth of state was spred,<br>
 Not of rich tissew, nor of cloth of gold,<br>
 Nor of ought else, that may be richest red,<br>
 But like a cloud, as likest may be told,<br>
 That her brode spreading wings did wyde vnfold;<br>
 Whose skirts were bordred with bright sunny beams,<br>
 Glistring like gold, amongst the plights enrold,<br>
 And here and there shooting forth siluer streames,<br>
 Mongst which crept litle Angels through the glittering gleames.</p><p>
 
 Seemed those litle Angels did vphold<br>
 The cloth of state, and on their purpled wings<br>
 Did beare the pendants, through their nimblesse bold:<br>
 Besides a thousand more of such, as sings<br>
 Hymnes to high God, and carols heauenly things,<br>
 Encompassed the throne, on which she sate:<br>
 She Angel-like, the heyre of ancient kings<br>
 And mightie Conquerors, in royall state,<br>
 Whylest kings and kesars at her feet did them prostrate.</p><p>
 
 Thus she did sit in souerayne Maiestie,<br>
 Holding a Scepter in her royall hand,<br>
 The sacred pledge of peace and clemencie,<br>
 With which high God had blest her happie land,<br>
 Maugre so many foes, which did withstand.<br>
 But at her feet her sword was likewise layde,<br>
 Whose long rest rusted the bright steely brand;<br>
 Yet when as foes enforst, or friends sought ayde,<br>
 She could it sternely draw, that all the world dismayde.</p><p>
 
 And round about, before her feet there sate<br>
 A beuie of faire Virgins clad in white,<br>
 That goodly seem'd t'adorne her royall state,<br>
 All louely daughters of high <i>Ioue</i>, that hight,<br>
 <i>Litae</i>, by him begot in loues delight,<br>
 Vpon the righteous <i>Themis</i>: those they say<br>
 Vpon <i>Ioues</i> iudgement seat wayt day and night,<br>
 And when in wrath he threats the worlds decay,<br>
 They doe his anger calme, and cruell vengeance stay.</p><p>
 
 They also doe by his diuine permission<br>
 Vpon the thrones of mortall Princes tend,<br>
 And often treat for pardon and remission<br>
 To suppliants, through frayltie which offend.<br>
 Those did vpon <i>Mercillaes</i> throne attend:<br>
 Iust <i>Dice</i>, wise <i>Eunomie</i>, myld <i>Eirene</i>,<br>
 And them amongst, her glorie to commend,<br>
 Sate goodly <i>Temperance</i> in garments clene,<br>
 And sacred <i>Reuerence</i>, yborne of heauenly strene,</p><p>
 
 Thus did she sit in royall rich estate,<br>
 Admyr'd of many, honoured of all,<br>
 Whylest vnderneath her feete, there as she sate,<br>
 An huge great Lyon lay, that mote appall<br>
 An hardie courage, like captiued thrall,<br>
 With a strong yron chaine and coller bound,<br>
 That once he could not moue, nor quich at all;<br>
 Yet did he murmure with rebellious sound,<br>
 And softly royne, when saluage choler gan redound.</p><p>
 
 So sitting high in dreaded souerayntie,<br>
 Those two strange knights were to her presence brought;<br>
 Who bowing low before her Maiestie,<br>
 Did to her myld obeysance, as they ought,<br>
 And meekest boone, that they imagine mought.<br>
 To whom she eke inclyning her withall,<br>
 As a faire stoupe of her high soaring thought,<br>
 A chearefull countenance on them let fall,<br>
 Yet tempred with some maiestie imperiall.</p><p>
 
 As the bright sunne, what time his fierie teme<br>
 Towards the westerne brim begins to draw,<br>
 Gins to abate the brightnesse of his beme,<br>
 And feruour of his flames somewhat adaw:<br>
 So did this mightie Ladie, when she saw<br>
 Those two strange knights such homage to her make,<br>
 Bate somewhat of that Maiestie and awe,<br>
 That whylome wont to doe so many quake,<br>
 And with more myld aspect those two to entertake.</p><p>
 
 Now at that instant, as occasion fell,<br>
 When these two stranger knights arriu'd in place,<br>
 She was about affaires of common wele,<br>
 Dealing of Iustice with indifferent grace,<br>
 And hearing pleas of people meane and base.<br>
 Mongst which as then, there was for to be heard<br>
 The tryall of a great and weightie case,<br>
 Which on both sides was then debating hard:<br>
 But at the sight of these, those were a while debard.</p><p>
 
 But after all her princely entertayne,<br>
 To th'hearing of that former cause in hand,<br>
 Her selfe eftsoones she gan conuert againe;<br>
 Which that those knights likewise mote vnderstand,<br>
 And witnesse forth aright in forrain land,<br>
 Taking them vp vnto her stately throne,<br>
 Where they mote heare the matter throughly scand<br>
 On either part, she placed th'one on th'one,<br>
 The other on the other side, and neare them none.</p><p>
 
 Then was there brought, as prisoner to the barre,<br>
 A Ladie of great countenance and place,<br>
 But that she it with foule abuse did marre;<br>
 Yet did appeare rare beautie in her face,<br>
 But blotted with condition vile and base,<br>
 That all her other honour did obscure,<br>
 And titles of nobilitie deface:<br>
 Yet in that wretched semblant, she did sure<br>
 The peoples great compassion vnto her allure.</p><p>
 
 Then vp arose a person of deepe reach,<br>
 And rare in-sight, hard matters to reuele;<br>
 That well could charme his tongue, and time his speach<br>
 To all assayes; his name was called <i>Zele</i>:<br>
 He gan that Ladie strongly to appele<br>
 Of many haynous crymes, by her enured,<br>
 And with sharpe reasons rang her such a pele,<br>
 That those, whom she to pitie had allured,<br>
 He now t'abhorre and loath her person had procured.</p><p>
 
 First gan he tell, how this that seem'd so faire<br>
 And royally arayd, <i>Duessa</i> hight,<br>
 That false <i>Duessa</i>, which had wrought great care,<br>
 And mickle mischiefe vnto many a knight,<br>
 By her beguyled, and confounded quight:<br>
 But not for those she now in question came,<br>
 Though also those mote question'd be aright,<br>
 But for vyld treasons, and outrageous shame,<br>
 Which she against the dred <i>Mercilla</i> oft did frame.</p><p>
 
 For she whylome (as ye mote yet right well<br>
 Remember) had her counsels false conspyred,<br>
 With faithlesse <i>Blandamour</i> and <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
 (Both two her paramours, both by her hyred,<br>
 And both with hope of shadowes vaine inspyred.)<br>
 And with them practiz'd, how for to depryue<br>
 <i>Mercilla</i> of her crowne, by her aspyred,<br>
 That she might it vnto her selfe deryue,<br>
 And tryumph in their blood, whom she to death did dryue.</p><p>
 
 But through high heauens grace, which fauour not<br>
 The wicked driftes of trayterous desynes,<br>
 Gainst loiall Princes, all this cursed plot,<br>
 Ere proofe it tooke, discouered was betymes,<br>
 And th'actours won the meede meet for their crymes.<br>
 Such be the meede of all, that by such mene<br>
 Vnto the type of kingdomes title clymes.<br>
 But false <i>Duessa</i> now vntitled Queene,<br>
 Was brought to her sad doome, as here was to be seene.</p><p>
 
 Strongly did <i>Zele</i> her haynous fact enforce,<br>
 And many other crimes of foule defame<br>
 Against her brought, to banish all remorse,<br>
 And aggrauate the horror of her blame.<br>
 And with him to make part against her, came<br>
 Many graue persons, that against her pled;<br>
 First was a sage old Syre, that had to name<br>
 The <i>Kingdomes care</i>, with a white siluer hed,<br>
 That many high regards and reasons gainst her red.</p><p>
 
 Then gan <i>Authority</i> her to appose<br>
 With peremptorie powre, that made all mute;<br>
 And then the law of <i>Nations</i> gainst her rose,<br>
 And reasons brought, that no man could refute;<br>
 Next gan <i>Religion</i> gainst her to impute<br>
 High Gods beheast, and powre of holy lawes;<br>
 Then gan the Peoples cry and Commons sute,<br>
 Importune care of their owne publicke cause;<br>
 And lastly <i>Iustice</i> charged her with breach of lawes.</p><p>
 
 But then for her, on the contrarie part,<br>
 Rose many aduocates for her to plead:<br>
 First there came <i>Pittie</i>, with full tender hart,<br>
 And with her ioyn'd <i>Regard</i> of womanhead;<br>
 And then came <i>Daunger</i> threatning hidden dread,<br>
 And high alliance vnto forren powre;<br>
 Then came <i>Nobilitie</i> of birth, that bread<br>
 Great ruth through her misfortunes tragicke stowre;<br>
 And lastly <i>Griefe</i> did plead, and many teares forth powre.</p><p>
 
 With the neare touch whereof in tender hart<br>
 The Briton Prince was sore empassionate,<br>
 And woxe inclined much vnto her part,<br>
 Through the sad terror of so dreadfull fate,<br>
 And wretched ruine of so high estate,<br>
 That for great ruth his courage gan relent.<br>
 Which when as <i>Zele</i> perceiued to abate,<br>
 He gan his earnest feruour to augment,<br>
 And many fearefull obiects to them to present.</p><p>
 
 He gan t'efforce the euidence anew,<br>
 And new accusements to produce in place:<br>
 He brought forth that old hag of hellish hew,<br>
 The cursed <i>Ate</i>, brought her face to face,<br>
 Who priuie was, and partie in the case:<br>
 She, glad of spoyle and ruinous decay,<br>
 Did her appeach, and to her more disgrace,<br>
 The plot of all her practise did display,<br>
 And all her traynes, and all her treasons forth did lay.</p><p>
 
 Then brought he forth, with griesly grim aspect,<br>
 Abhorred <i>Murder</i>, who with bloudie knyfe<br>
 Yet dropping fresh in hand did her detect,<br>
 And there with guiltie bloudshed charged ryfe:<br>
 Then brought he forth <i>Sedition</i>, breeding stryfe<br>
 In troublous wits, and mutinous vprore:<br>
 Then brought he forth <i>Incontinence</i> of lyfe,<br>
 Euen foule <i>Adulterie</i> her face before,<br>
 And lewd <i>Impietie</i>, that her accused sore.</p><p>
 
 All which when as the Prince had heard and seene,<br>
 His former fancies ruth he gan repent,<br>
 And from her partie eftsoones was drawen cleene.<br>
 But <i>Artegall</i> with constant firme intent,<br>
 For zeale of Iustice was against her bent.<br>
 So was she guiltie deemed of them all.<br>
 Then <i>Zele</i> began to vrge her punishment,<br>
 And to their Queene for iudgement loudly call,<br>
 Vnto <i>Mercilla</i> myld for Iustice gainst the thrall.</p><p>
 
 But she, whose Princely breast was touched nere<br>
 With piteous ruth of her so wretched plight,<br>
 Though plaine she saw by all, that she did heare,<br>
 That she of death was guiltie found by right,<br>
 Yet would not let iust vengeance on her light;<br>
 But rather let in stead thereof to fall<br>
 Few perling drops from her faire lampes of light;<br>
 The which she couering with her purple pall<br>
 Would haue the passion hid, and vp arose withall.</p><p>
