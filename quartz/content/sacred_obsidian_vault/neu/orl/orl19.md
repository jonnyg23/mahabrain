 The closest path, amid the forest gray,<br>

 Of that sore weight upon his shoulders born.<br>
 The place he knew not, and mistook the way,<br>
 And hid himself again in sheltering thorn.<br>
 Secure and distant was his mate, that through<br>
 The greenwood shade with lighter shoulders flew.</td></tr>

 So far was Cloridan advanced before,<br>

 Exclaimed) “so far beside myself, and blind,<br>

 Nor know when I deserted thee or where?”</td></tr>

 And word and the tread of foemen, as in chase:<br>
 Lastly Medoro by his voice is known,<br>
 Disarmed, on foot, ’mid many horse, alone.</td></tr>

 Nor from the cherished load his shoulders frees.<br>
 Wearied, at length, the burden he bestowed<br>
 Upon the grass, and stalked about his load.</td></tr>

 And for her offspring watch, amid her ire.</td></tr>

 Fits, and directs it with so true an eye,<br>

 And lays the warrior dead upon the plain.</td></tr>

 Together, all the others of the band<br>

 Enwreaths, and drags him to himself amain;<br>

 Takes pity on the boy, and does not slay.</td></tr>

 With love and pity he all over burned.</td></tr>

 The warriors, in a moment slips and flies.<br>
 Cloridan who beholds the deed, at sight<br>
 Of young Medoro’s fall, springs forth to fight;</td></tr>

 Returned to seek Medoro on the mead.</td></tr>

 It stanched his life-blood, and his strength renewed;</td></tr>

 And after followed whither pleased the maid,<br>
 Who was to stay with him, by pity led,<br>
 Beneath the courteous shepherd’s humble shed.</td></tr>

 Was briefly healed by the Catàyan maid;<br>
