 None could Astolpho have found any where<br>

 Duke Aymon’s daughter for this pleasure sent.<br>

 Rogero on his journey, long and strange.</td></tr>

 Astolpho says on her he will bestow<br>
 His Rabican; so passing swift of kind,<br>

 Was drawn, he left the feathered shaft behind;<br>

 Of Galaphron was wont to bear in flight;<br>

 Was touched, fell headlong hurtling from his horse.</td></tr>

 Backed by Astolpho, and ascending slow,<br>

 Fearing the gale and rock, till he is through<br>

 Hoists every sail, and shoots before the wind.</td></tr>

 Bradamant, when departed was the peer,<br>
 Remained distressed in mind; since in what way<br>

 Here standing in suspense, by chance she spied<br>
 A churl, that came towards her on the plain,<br>

 As best he might, and laid on Rabicane;<br>
 She next behind her bade the peasant guide<br>
 (One courser loaded and one loose) the twain.<br>
 Two were the steeds; for she had that before,<br>
 On which his horse from Pinnabel she bore.</td></tr>

 And, sure to be bewildered, wend the pair:<br>

 Where she believes the place of meeting lies.</td></tr>

 She here and there, as she her way pursued,<br>
 Turned, but found none to question of the road;<br>
 She saw at mid-day, issuing from the wood,<br>
 A fort, nor far removed was the abode,<br>

 And to the lady like Mount Alban showed;<br>
 And was Mount Alban sure; in which repair<br>
 One of her brothers and her mother were.</td></tr>

 She, when she recognized the place, became<br>
 Sadder at heart than I have power to say.<br>
 If she delays, discovered is the dame,<br>
 Nor thence will be allowed to wend her way:<br>

 Which so consumes her, she will be the prey,<br>
 Nor see Rogero more, nor compass aught<br>
 Which was at Vallombrosa to be wrought.</td></tr>

 Some deal she doubted: then to turn her steed,<br>
 Resolved upon Mount Alban’s castle near;<br>

 Her course anew towards the abbey steer.<br>

 Alardo named, ere she had time to hide.</td></tr>

 As the enamoured maid compares in thought<br>

 Which time will never from her mind efface.</td></tr>

 Because she could not go, one in her stead<br>

 That there he for love would be baptised;<br>

 What might their bridal bring to happy end.</td></tr>

 Old Callitrephia’s daughter, from the crew;<br>

 A damsel she in all her secrets versed.</td></tr>

 As that which might suffice to make him sane.<br>

 How at Angelica’s persuasive prayer,<br>
 He to his farm had carried young Medore,<br>
 Grievously wounded with an arrow; where,<br>
 In little space she healed the angry sore.<br>
 But while she exercised this pious care,<br>
 Love in her heart the lady wounded more,<br>
 And kindled from small spark so fierce a fire,<br>
 She burnt all over, restless with desire:</td></tr>

 Nor thinking she of mightiest king was born,<br>
 Who ruled in the east, nor of her heritage,<br>
 Forced by too puissant love, had thought no scorn<br>
 To be the consort of a poor foot-page.<br>

 The gem, which, in reward for harbourage,<br>
 To her extended in that kind abode,<br>

 Which, at a single stroke, lopt off the head;<br>
 When, satiate with innumerable blows,<br>
 That cruel hangman Love his hate had fed.<br>
 Orlando studied to conceal his woes;<br>
 And yet the mischief gathered force and spread,<br>
 And would break out parforce in tears and sighs,<br>
 Would he, or would be not, from mouth and eyes.</td></tr>

 When he can give the rein to raging woe,<br>
 Alone, by other’s presence unreprest,<br>
 From his full eyes the tears descending flow,<br>
 In a wide stream, and flood his troubled breast.<br>
 ’Mid sob and groan, he tosses to and fro<br>
 About his weary bed, in search of rest;<br>
 And vainly shifting, harder than a rock<br>
 And sharper than a nettle found its flock.</td></tr>

 Amid the pressure of such cruel pain,<br>
 It past into the wretched sufferer’s head,<br>
 That oft the ungrateful lady must have lain,<br>
 Together with her leman, on that bed:<br>
 Nor less he loathed the couch in his disdain,<br>
 Nor from the down upstarted with less dread,<br>
 Than churl, who, when about to close his eyes,<br>
 Springs from the turf, if he a serpent spies.</td></tr>

 In him, forthwith, such deadly hatred breed<br>
 That bed, that house, that swain, he will not stay<br>
 Till the morn break, or till the dawn succeed,<br>
 Whose twilight goes before approaching day.<br>
 In haste, Orlando takes his arms and steed,<br>
 And to the deepest greenwood wends his way.<br>
 And, when assured that he is there alone,<br>
 Gives utterance to his grief in shriek and groan.</td></tr>

 Never from tears, never from sorrowing,<br>
 He paused; nor found he peace by night and day:<br>
 He fled from town, in forest harbouring,<br>
 And in the open air on hard earth lay.<br>
 He marvelled at himself, how such a spring<br>
 Of water from his eyes could stream away,<br>
 And breath was for so many sobs supplied;<br>
 And thus ofttimes, amid his mourning, cried.</td></tr>

 And which I scatter from so full a vein.<br>
 Of tears my ceaseless sorrow lacked supplies;<br>

 Driven by the fire within me, now would gain<br>
 A vent; and it is this which I expend,<br>
 And which my sorrows and my life will end.</td></tr>

 Its sorrow: Love, who with his pinions blows<br>
 The fire about my heart, creates this gale.<br>
 Love, by what miracle does thou contrive,<br>
 It wastes not in the fire thou keep’st alive?</td></tr>

 Slain by that most ungrateful lady’s spite,<br>
 Whose faithlessness inflicted such a wound.<br>

 Which in this hell, tormented, walks its round,<br>
 To be, but in its shadow left above,<br>
 A warning to all such as thrust in love.”</td></tr>

 All night about the forest roved the count,<br>

 By his unhappy fortune to the fount,<br>
 Where his inscription young Medoro wrought.<br>

 Inflamed his fury so, in him was nought<br>
 But turned to hatred, phrensy, rage, and spite;<br>

 Into the sky, in tiny fragments sped.<br>
 Wo worth each sapling and the caverned rock,<br>
 Where Medore and Angelica were read!<br>
 So scathed, that they to shepherd or to flock<br>
 Thenceforth shall never furnish shade or bed.<br>
 And that sweet fountain, late so clear and pure,<br>
 From such tempestuous wrath was ill secure.</td></tr>

 Cast without cease into the beauteous source;<br>

 Never again was clear the troubled course.<br>
 At length, for lack of breath, compelled to stop,<br>
 (When he is bathed in sweat, and wasted force,<br>
 Serves not his fury more) he falls, and lies<br>
 Upon the mead, and, gazing upward, sighs.</td></tr>

 Wearied and woe-begone, he fell to ground,<br>
 And turned his eyes toward heaven; nor spake he aught.<br>
 Nor ate, nor slept, till in his daily round<br>
 The golden sun had broken thrice, and sought<br>
 His rest anew; nor ever ceased his wound<br>
 To rankle, till it marred his sober thought.<br>
 At length, impelled by phrensy, the fourth day,<br>
 He from his limbs tore plate and mail away.</td></tr>

 Here was his helmet, there his shield bestowed;<br>
 His arms far off; and, farther than the rest,<br>
 His cuirass; through the greenwood wide was strowed<br>
 All his good gear, in fine; and next his vest<br>
 He rent; and, in his fury, naked showed<br>
 His shaggy paunch, and all his back and breast.<br>
 And ’gan that phrensy act, so passing dread,<br>
 Of stranger folly never shall be said.</td></tr>

 And beech, and mountain-ash, and elm-tree hoar.<br>
 He did what fowler, ere he spreads his net,<br>
 Does, to prepare the champaigne for his lore,<br>
 By stubble, rush, and nettle-stalk; and broke,<br>
 Like these, old sturdy trees and stems of oak.</td></tr>

 Leaving their flocks beneath the greenwood tree,<br>

 If I o’erpass this bound, may irksome be;<br>
 And I my story will delay to end,<br>
 Rather than by my tediousness offend.</td></tr>
