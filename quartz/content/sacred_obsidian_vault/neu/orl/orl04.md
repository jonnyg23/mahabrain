 Mounted upon the wizard’s winged steed.<br>

 Scarped smooth upon four parts, the mountain bare<br>

 Not long within his gate the enchanter stayed,<br>

 Against the foe, who seemed a man, arrayed<br>
 In arms, with him the horse is on the wing.<br>

 Who, with small cause for fear, beheld him bring<br>
 Nor mace, nor rested lance, nor bitting sword,<br>
 Wherewith the corselet might be bruised or gored.</td></tr>

 On his left arm alone his shield he took,<br>
 Covered all o’er with silk of crimson hue;<br>

 No empty fiction wrought by magic lore,<br>
 But natural was the steed the wizard pressed;<br>

 Hight hippogryph. In wings and beak and crest,<br>
 Formed like his sire, as in the feet before;<br>
 But like the mare, his dam, in all the rest.<br>

 Drawn by enchantment from his distant lair,<br>

 Saddle and bit, and gallop to the goal;<br>

 All shifts of manege, course and caracole;<br>
 He with such labour wrought. This only real,<br>
 Where all the rest was hollow and ideal.</td></tr>

 This truth by him with fictions was combined,<br>
 Whose sleight passed red for yellow, black for white:<br>
 But all his vain enchantments could not blind<br>
 The maid, whose virtuous ring assured her sight:<br>
 Yet she her blows discharges at the wind;<br>
 And spurring here and there prolongs the fight.<br>
 So drove or wheeled her steed, and smote at nought,<br>
 And practised all she had before been taught.</td></tr>

 Unweeting the defence, towards her wends.<br>

 She bites, and at a snap the prisoner dies.</td></tr>

 To cat and mouse, in battles fought before,<br>
 I liken the magician and his foes;<br>

 For, with the ring, the maid against him goes;<br>
 Firm and attentive still, and watching sore,<br>
 Lest upon her the wizard should impose:<br>
 And as she sees him bare the wondrous shield,<br>
 Closes her eyes and falls upon the field.</td></tr>

 Not that the shining metal could offend,<br>
 As wont those others, from its cover freed;<br>

 For she no sooner on the grassy mead<br>
 Had laid her head, than wheeling widely round,<br>
 The flying courser pitched upon the ground.</td></tr>

 Already cased again, the shield was hung,<br>

 He all his battles fought, on earth had laid:</td></tr>

 Girt round about him for such a purpose, wore;<br>
 Because he deemed she was no less to be<br>
 Mastered and bound than those subdued before.<br>
 Him hath the dame already flung; by me<br>
 Excused with reason, if he strove not more.<br>
 For fearful were the odds between that bold<br>
 And puissant maid, and warrior weak and old!</td></tr>

 Intending to behead the fallen foe,<br>
 She lifts her conquering hand; but in mid space,<br>
 When she beholds his visage, stops the blow,<br>

 A venerable sire, with sorrowing face;<br>
 Whose hair and wrinkles speak him, to her guess,<br>
 Of years six score and ten, or little less.</td></tr>

 Who shall deliver her from death and shame,<br>

 With dower, well suited to a royal dame;<br>

 A like emprize were worthier of your spear<br>
 Than wandering through these woods in lowly guise.<br>

 Rinaldo mused awhile, and then replied,<br>

 And quenched within her arms his fond desire?<br>
 Cursed be the law by which the dame is tried!<br>
 Cursed he who would permit a doom so dire!<br>
 Perish (such fate were just!) who cruel proves!<br>
 Not she that life bestows on him who loves.</td></tr>

 For this my praise the lady well might claim,<br>
 If manifest were not that gentle deed.<br>
 My every thought is turned to aid the dame.<br>
 Grant me but one to guide my steps, and lead<br>
 Quickly to where the foul accuser stands,<br>
 I trust in God to loose Geneura’s bands.</td></tr>

 When the new dawn, with streaks of red and white,<br>
 Broke in the east, and cleared the hemisphere,<br>
 Rinaldo took his steed and armour bright:<br>
 A squire that abbey furnished to the peer.<br>
 With him, for many leagues and miles, the knight<br>
 Pricked through the dismal forest dark and drear;<br>
 While they towards the Scottish city ride,<br>
 Where the poor damsel’s cause is to be tried.</td></tr>

 Loud lamentations nigh the road were heard.<br>
 Towards a neighbouring vale, whence came the sound,<br>
 This his Bayardo, that his hackney spurred;<br>
 And viewed, between two grisly ruffians there,<br>
 A girl, who seemed at distance passing fair.</td></tr>

 But woe begone and weeping was the maid<br>
 As ever damsel dame, or wight was seen;<br>
 Hard by the barbarous twain prepared the blade,<br>
 To deluge with that damsel’s blood the green.<br>
 She to delay her death awhile essayed,<br>
 Until she pity moved with mournful mien.<br>
 This when Rinaldo near approaching eyes,<br>
 He thither drives with threats and furious cries.</td></tr>

 The ruffians turn their backs and take to flight<br>
 As soon as they the distant succour view,<br>
 And squat within a valley out of sight:<br>
 Nor cares the good Rinaldo to pursue.<br>
 To her approaching, sues Mount Alban’s knight,<br>
 To say what on her head such evil drew;<br>
 And, to save time, commands his squire to stoop,<br>
 And take the damsel on his horse’s croup.</td></tr>

 And as the lady nearer he surveyed,<br>
 Her wise behaviour marked and beauty’s bloom;<br>
 Though her fait countenance was all dismayed,<br>
 And by the fear of death o’erspread with gloom.<br>
 Again to know, the gentle knight essayed,<br>
 Who had prepared for her so fell a doom;<br>
 And she began to tell in humble tone<br>
 What to another canto I postpone.</td></tr>
