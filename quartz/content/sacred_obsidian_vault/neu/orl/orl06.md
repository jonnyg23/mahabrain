 Make a cool shelter from the noontide hour.<br>

 Their flight, and safely amorous descants sing.</td></tr>

 Amid red roses and white lilies there,<br>

 Feed at their ease, or ruminating lie;<br>
 While, swarming in those wilds, from tuft or steep<br>
 Dun deer or nimble goat, disporting, leap.</td></tr>

 But held him, lest he should remount the air;<br>

 Catches the gales which blow from hill or sea,<br>

 No ramble his in square or market-place!<br>
 Three thousand miles, without repose, he went,<br>

 Meanwhile the courser by the myrtle’s side,<br>
 Whom he left stabled in the cool retreat,<br>
 Started at something in the wood descried,<br>
 Scared by I know not what; and in his heat<br>
 So made the myrtle shake where he was tied,<br>
 He brought a shower of leaves about his feet;<br>
 He made the myrtle shake and foliage fall,<br>
 But, struggling, could not loose himself withal.</td></tr>

 Is heard to hiss and bubble, sing and seethe:<br>
 So the offended myrtle inly pined,<br>
 Groaned, murmured, and at last unclosed its rind:</td></tr>

 Griefs of my own inflict sufficient wound:<br>

 Whence came the voice, and, in unused surprise,<br>
 Stands, when he finds it issues from the tree;<br>
 And swiftly to remove the courser hies.<br>

 In answer to the groaning myrtle, cries;<br>
 “Pardon! and, whatsoe’er thou art, be good,<br>
 Spirit of man, or goddess of the wood!</td></tr>

 When he was nigh the city-walls, so bright,<br>
 The world has not their equal, he the straight<br>
 And spacious way deserts, the way which dight<br>
 Across the plain, conducted to the gate;<br>
 And by that safer road upon the right,<br>
 Strains now against the mountain; but, in wait,<br>
 Encounters soon the crowd of evil foes,<br>
 Who furiously the Child’s advance oppose.</td></tr>

 Was never yet beheld a stranger band,<br>
 Of mien more hideous, or more monstrous shape.<br>
 Formed downwards from neck like men, he scanned<br>
 Some with the head of cat, and some of ape;<br>
 With hoof of goat that other stamped the sand;<br>
 While some seemed centaurs, quick in fight and rape;<br>
 Naked, or mantled in outlandish skin.<br>
 These doting sires, those striplings bold in sin.</td></tr>

 This gallops on a horse without a bit;<br>
 This backs the sluggish ass, or bullock slow;<br>
 These mounted on the croup of centaur sit:<br>
 Those perched on eagle, crane, or estridge, go.<br>
 Some male, some female, some hermaphrodit’,<br>
 These drain the cup and those the bungle blow.<br>
 One bore a corded ladder, one a hook,<br>
 One a dull file, or bar of iron shook.</td></tr>

 The captain of this crew, which blocked the road,<br>
 Appeared, with monstrous paunch and bloated face;<br>
 Who a slow tortoise for a horse bestrode,<br>
 That passing sluggishly with him did pace:<br>
 Down looked, some here, some there, sustained the load,<br>
 For he was drunk, and kept him in his place.<br>
 Some wipe his brows and chin from sweat which ran,<br>
 And others with their vests his visage fan.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXIV.</td><td>
 One, with a human shape and feet, his crest,<br>
 Fashioned like hound, in neck and ears and head,<br>
 Bayed at the gallant Child with angry quest,<br>
 To turn him to the city whence he fled.<br>
 “That will I never, while of strength possessed<br>
 To brandish this,” the good Rogero said:<br>
 With that his trenchant faulchion he displayed,<br>
 And pointed at him full the naked blade.</td></tr>

 That monster would have smote him with a spear,<br>
 But swiftly at his foe Rogero sprung,<br>
 Thrust at his paunch, and drove his faulchion sheer<br>
 Through his pierced back a palm; his buckler flung<br>
 Before him, and next sallied there and here:<br>
 But all too numerous was the wicked throng.<br>
 Now grappled from behind, now punched before,<br>
 He stands, and plies the crowd with warfare sore.</td></tr>

 One to the teeth, another to the breast,<br>
 Of that foul race he cleft; since no one steeled<br>
 In mail, his brows with covering helmet dressed,<br>
 Or fought, secured by corslet or by shield;<br>
 Yet is he so upon all quarters pressed,<br>
 That it would need the Child, to clear the field,<br>
 And to keep off the wicked crew which swarms,<br>
 More than Briareus’ hundred hands and arms.</td></tr>

 If he had thought the magic shield to show,<br>
 (I speak of that the necromancer bore,<br>
 Which dazed the sight of the astonished foe,<br>
 Left at his saddle by the wizard Moor)<br>
 That hideous band, in sudden overthrow,<br>
 Blinded by this, had sunk the knight before.<br>
 But haply he despised such mean as vile,<br>
 And would prevail by valour, not by guile.</td></tr>

 This as it may: the Child would meet his fate,<br>
 Ere by so vile a band be prisoner led;<br>
 When, lo! forth-issuing from the city’s gate,<br>
 Whose wall appeared like shining gold I said,<br>
 Two youthful dames, not born in low estate,<br>
 If measured by their mien and garb, nor bred<br>
 By swain, in early wants and troubles versed;<br>
 But amid princely joys in palace nursed!</td></tr>

 On unicorn was seated either fair,<br>
 A beast than spotless ermine yet more white;<br>
 So lovely were the damsels, and so rare<br>
 Their garb, and with such graceful fashion dight,<br>
 That he who closely viewed the youthful pair,<br>
 Would need a surer sense than mortal sight,<br>
 To judge between the two. With such a mien<br>
 Embodied Grace and Beauty would be seen.</td></tr>

 Into the mead rode this and the other dame,<br>
 Where the foul crew opposed the Child’s retreat.<br>
 The rabble scattered as the ladies came,<br>
 Who with extended hand the warrior greet.<br>
 He, with a kindling visage, red with shame,<br>
 Thanked the two damsels for their gentle feat;<br>
 And was content upon their will to wait,<br>
 With them returning to that golden gate.</td></tr>

 Above, a cornice round the gateway goes,<br>
 Somedeal projecting from the colonnade,<br>
 In which is not a single part but glows,<br>
 With rarest gems of India overlaid.<br>
 Propp’d at four points, the portal did repose<br>
 On columns of one solid diamond made.<br>
 Whether what met the eye was false or true,<br>
 Was never sight more fair or glad to view.</td></tr>

 Upon the sill and through the columns there,<br>
 Ran young and wanton girls, in frolic sport;<br>
 Who haply yet would have appeared more fair,<br>
 Had they observed a woman’s fitting port.<br>
 All are arrayed in green, and garlands wear<br>
 Of the fresh leaf. Him these in courteous sort,<br>
 With many proffers and fair mien entice,<br>
 And welcome to this opening Paradise:</td></tr>

 For so with reason I this place may call,<br>
 Where, it is my belief, that Love had birth;<br>
 Where life is spent in festive game and ball,<br>
 And still the passing moments fleet in mirth.<br>
 Here hoary-headed Thought ne’er comes at all,<br>
 Nor finds a place in any bosom. Dearth,<br>
 Nor yet Discomfort, never enter here,<br>
 Where Plenty fills her horn throughout the year.</td></tr>

 Here, where with jovial and unclouded brow,<br>
 Glad April seems to wear a constant smile,<br>
 Troop boys and damsels: One, whose fountains flow,<br>
 On the green margin sings in dulcet style;<br>
 Others, the hill or tufted tree below,<br>
 In dance, or no mean sport the hours beguile.<br>
 While this, who shuns the revellers’ noisy cheer,<br>
 Tells his love sorrows in his comrade’s ear.</td></tr>

 Above the laurel and pine-tree’s height,<br>
 Through the tall beech and shaggy fir-tree’s spray,<br>
 Sport little loves, with desultory flight:<br>
 These, at their conquests made, rejoiced and gay:<br>
 These, with the well-directed shaft, take sight<br>
 At hearts, and those spread nets to catch their prey:<br>
 One wets his arrows in the brook which winds,<br>
 And one on whirling stone the weapon grinds.</td></tr>

 To good Rogero here was brought a steed,<br>
 Puissant and nimble, all of sorel hue;<br>
 Who was caparisoned with costly weed,<br>
 Broidered with gold, and jewels bright to view.<br>
 That other winged horse, which, at his need,<br>
 Obedient to the Moorish wizard flew,<br>
 The friendly damsels to a youth consigned,<br>
 Who led him at a slower pace behind.</td></tr>

 You will the prowess of your arm assay.</td></tr>

 To the other shore, a giantess in frame;<br>

 In arms of gold: but I awhile delay<br>
