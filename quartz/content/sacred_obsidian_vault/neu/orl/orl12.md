 Orlando, full of rage, pursues a knight<br>

 Had raised a dome, Rogero there to stay.<br>
 Here too Rogero comes; where getting sight<br>

 Amid the paynim host, finds Isabel.</i></small></td></tr>

 He suddenly dismounts, and thundering fares<br>
 Through the inmost palace, seeking still his foe,<br>
 And here and there in restless rage repairs,<br>
 Till he has seen each bower, each galleried row;<br>

 Having first vainly searched each room below.<br>

 Roland, when he round that strange dome had paced<br>
 Four times or six, still vainly seeking, said<br>
 Within himself, at last, “I here might waste<br>
 My time and trouble, still in vain delayed,<br>
 While haply her the robber whom I chased<br>
 Has far away, through other gate conveyed.”<br>
 So thinking, from the house he issued out<br>
 Into the mead which girt the dome about.</td></tr>

 While Roland wanders round the sylvan Hall,<br>
 Still holding close his visage to the ground,<br>
 To see if recent print or trace withal<br>
 Can, right or left, upon the turf be found,<br>
 He from a neighbouring window hears a call,<br>
 And looks, and thinks he hears that voice’s sound,<br>
 And thinks he sees the visage by which he<br>
 Was so estranged from what he wont to be.</td></tr>

 These words repeated once, and yet again,<br>

 But tempered with high hope. Sometimes the peer<br>
 Stopt in his search and heard a voice complain,<br>

 Returning to Rogero, left, I said,<br>

 Following the giant and the dame who fled,<br>

 I say that he arrived where Roland dread<br>
 Arrived before him, if I rightly read.<br>
 The giant through the golden portal passed,<br>
 Rogero close behind, who followed fast.</td></tr>

 As soon as he his foot has lifted o’er<br>
 The threshold, he through court and gallery spies;<br>
 Nor sees the giant or the lady more,<br>
 And vainly glances here and there his eyes.<br>
 He up and down returns with labour sore,<br>
 Yet not for that his longing satisfies;<br>
 Nor can imagine where the felon thief<br>
 Has hid himself and dame in space so brief.</td></tr>

 After four times or five he so had wound<br>
 Above, below, through bower and gallery fair,<br>

 Searched even to the space beneath the stair.<br>
 At length, in hope they in the woodlands round<br>
 Might be, he sallied; but the voice, which there<br>
 Roland recalled, did him no less recall,<br>
 And made as well return within the Hall.</td></tr>

 He spake, of those who through the palace strayed.<br>
 To all of them the vision, seen apart,<br>
 Seemed that which each had singly most at heart.</td></tr>

 Now of that ring so wondrous repossessed,<br>

 Preserved from spell when it the finger pressed,)<br>

 Her way to her fair Indian realm anew.</td></tr>

 Atlantes old. The damsel doubts withal<br>

 Her face, unveiled to the Circassian’s eye:<br>

 Escaping from the keen pursuer’s chase.<br>

 Observes, and at their wonder laughs unseen.</td></tr>

 In the mid wood, where they the maid did lose,<br>

 Angelica thus, viewless and alone,<br>

 On her departure from the grassy fount.<br>

 For having robbed Orlando of his casque.</td></tr>
