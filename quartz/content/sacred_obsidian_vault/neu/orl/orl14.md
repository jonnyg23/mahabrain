 Proud and untamed; and who would not forbear<br>
 To scale the lofty firmament till night,<br>
 Could he in this wide world descry the stair.<br>
 He stood not, he, to mark the bulwark’s plight<br>
 Nor if the fosse of certain bottom were.<br>
 He past, ran,—rather flew across the moat,<br>
 Plunging in filth and water to his throat.</td></tr>

 Dripping and foul with water and with weeds,<br>
 ’Mid fire and stone, and arbalests, and bows,<br>
 On drives the chief; as through the marshy reeds,<br>
 The wild-swine of our own Mallea goes;<br>
 Who makes large day-light wheresoe’er he speeds,<br>
 Parting the sedge with breast and tusk and nose.<br>
 The paynim, safe in buckler lifted high,<br>
 Scorns not the wall alone, but braves the sky.</td></tr>

 Rodomont has no sooner gained the shore,<br>
 Than on the wooden bartizan he stands,<br>
 Within the city walls, a bridge that bore<br>
 (Roomy and large) king Charles’s Christian bands.<br>
 Here many a scull is riven, here men take more<br>
 Than monkish tonsure at the warrior’s hands:<br>
 Heads fly and arms; and to the ditch a flood<br>
 Runs streaming from the wall of crimson blood.</td></tr>

 He drops the shield; and with two-handed sway<br>
 Wielding his sword, duke Arnulph he offends.<br>
 Who came from whence, into the briny bay,<br>
 The water of the rapid Rhine descends.<br>
 No better than the sulphur keeps away<br>
 The advancing flame, the wretch his life defends.<br>
 He his last shudder gives, and tumbles dead;<br>
 Cleft downwards, a full palm from neck and head.</td></tr>

 At one back-stroke sir Spineloccio true,<br>
 Anselmo, Prando, and Oldrado fell;<br>
 The narrow place and thickly-swarming crew<br>
 Make the wide-circling blow so fully tell.<br>
 The first half Flemings were, the residue<br>
 Are Normans, who the list of slaughter swell.<br>
 Orghetto of Maganza, he from brow<br>
 To breast divides, and thence to paunch below.</td></tr>

 Down from the wall Andropono and Moschine<br>
 He cast into the ditch: a priest the first;<br>
 The second, but a worshipper of wine,<br>
 Drained, at a draught, whole runlets in his thirst;<br>
 Aye wonted simple water to decline,<br>
 Like viper’s blood or venom: now immersed<br>
 In this, he perishes amid that slaughter;<br>
 And, what breeds most affliction, dies by water.</td></tr>

 Lewis the Provencal is cleft in two;<br>

 The crowd, by Rodomont of Sarza led,<br>
 The ladders lift, and many places scale.<br>
 Here the Parisians make no further head,<br>
 Who find their first defense of small avail<br>
 Full well they know that danger more to dread<br>
 Within awaits the foemen who assail;<br>
 Because between the wall and second mound<br>
 A fosse descends, wide, horrid, and profound.</td></tr>

 Besides, that ours, with those upon the height,<br>
 War from below, like valiant men and stout,<br>
 New files succeed to those who fall in fight,<br>
 Where, on the interior summit, stand the rout,<br>
 Who gall with lances, and a whistling flight<br>
 Of darts, the mighty multitude without;<br>
 Many of whom, I ween, that post would shun,<br>
 If it were not for royal Ulien’s son.</td></tr>

 But he still heartened some, and chid the rest,<br>
 And forced them forward to their sore alarm.<br>
 One paynim’s head he cleft, and other’s breast,<br>
 Who turned about to fly; and of the swarm<br>
 Some shoved and pushed and to the encounter prest,<br>
 Close-grappled by the collar, hair, or arm:<br>
 And downwards from the wall such numbers threw,<br>
 The ditch was all to narrow for the crew.</td></tr>

 While so the foes descend, or rather fling<br>
 Themselves into the perilous profound;<br>
 And thence by many ladders try to spring<br>
 Upon the summit of the second mound,<br>
 King Rodomont, as if he had a wing<br>
 Upon his every member, from the ground<br>
 Upraised his weight, and vaulted clean across,<br>
 Loaded with all his arms, the yawning fosse.</td></tr>

 The moat of thirty feet, not less, he cleared,<br>
 As dexterously as leaps the greyhound fleet,<br>
 Nor at his lighting louder noise was heard<br>
 Than if he had worn felt beneath his feet.<br>
 He now of this, now that, the mantle sheared;<br>
 As though of pewter, not of iron beat,<br>
 Or rather of soft rind their arms had been:<br>
 So matchless was his force and sword so keen!</td></tr>

 This while, not idle, those of ours had laid<br>
 Snares in the inner moat, a well-charged mine:<br>
 Where broom and thick fascines, all over paid<br>
 With swarthy pitch, in plenty intertwine.<br>
 Though they from bank to bank that hollow line,<br>
 Filling the bottom well-nigh to the brink;<br>
 And countless vessels the defenders sink.</td></tr>

 The town, should pay their daring folly dear,<br>

 The inner bulwark’s platform) when they hear<br>
 The appointed signal which their comrades raise,<br>
 Set, at fit points, the wildfire in a blaze.</td></tr>

 For that the moat was full from side to side,<br>
 The scattered flames united into one,<br>
 And mounted to such height, they well-nigh dried<br>
 The watery bosom of the moon; a dun<br>
 And dismal cloud above extending wide,<br>
 Dimmed every glimpse of light, and hid the sun:<br>
 A fearful crash, with a continued sound,<br>
 Like a long peal of thunder, shook the ground.</td></tr>

 A horrid concert, a rude harmony<br>
 Of deep lament, and yell and shriek, which came<br>
 From those poor wretches in extremity,<br>
 Perishing through their furious leader’s blame,<br>
 Was heard, as in strange concord, to agree<br>
 With the fierce crackling of the murderous flame.<br>
 No more of this, no more!—Here, sir, I close<br>
 My canto, hoarse, and needing short repose.</td></tr>
