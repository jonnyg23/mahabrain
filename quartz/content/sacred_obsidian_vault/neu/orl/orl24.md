 So said Sir Odoric; and after showed<br>

 To melt a heart that with resentment glowed,<br>

 Moves a hard heart, Sir Odoric now exprest.</td></tr>

 Whether or no to venge such infamy,<br>
 Youthful Zerbino doubted: the review<br>

 The recollection of the amity<br>
 So long maintained between them, with the dew<br>
 Of pity cooled the fury in his mind,<br>

 If to the vultures he her carcase threw:<br>
 He diverse punishments awhile revolved,<br>
 And thus the warrior finally resolved.</td></tr>

 He to his comrades turned him round, and said:<br>

 To give him life and liberty consent;<br>

 “Often has Love turned upside down a brain<br>
 Of sounder wit than that to him assigned,<br>

 Pardon his offences; I the pain<br>
 Of these should justly suffer, who was blind;<br>
 Blind when I gave him such a trust, nor saw<br>
