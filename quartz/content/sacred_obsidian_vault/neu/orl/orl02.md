 The good Rogero, nigh becomes the prey<br>
 Of Pinabel, who drops the damsel brave<br>
 Into the dungeon of a living grave.</i></small></td></tr>

 I<small>NJURIOUS</small> L<small>OVE</small>, why still to mar accord<br>
 Between desires has been thy favourite feat?<br>

 Two hearts should with a different measure beat?<br>
 Thou wilt not let me take the certain ford,<br>
 Dragging me where the stream is deep and fleet.<br>

 Thou to Rinaldo show’st the damsel fair,<br>

 Paid back with deepest hate her amorous flame,<br>

 Scorned in his turn, and his reward the same.<br>
 By the changed damsel in such sort abhorred,<br>

 He to the Pagan cries: “Forego thy theft,<br>

 I am not wont to let my own be reft.<br>
 And he who seeks it dearly pays the deed.<br>
 More—I shall take from thee yon lovely weft;<br>
 To leave thee such a prize were foul misdeed;<br>

 Were ill, methinks, relinquished to a thief.”</td></tr>

 “Thou liest,” the haughty Saracen retorts,<br>
 As proud, and burning with as fierce a flame,<br>

 Best proved by valiant deeds: though, for the dame,<br>

 As two fierce dogs will sometimes stand at gaze,<br>
 Whom hate or other springs of strife inspire,<br>
 And grind their teeth, while each his foe surveys<br>
 With sidelong glance and eyes more red than fire,<br>
 Then either falls to bites, and hoarsely bays,<br>
 While their stiff bristles stand on end with ire:<br>
 So from reproach and menace to the sword<br>
 Pass Sacripant and Clermont’s angry lord.</td></tr>

 Thus kindling into wrath the knights engage:<br>
 One is on foot, the other on his horse:<br>
 Small gain to this; for inexperienced page<br>
 Would better rein his charger in the course.<br>
 For such Bayardo’s sense, he will not wage<br>
 War with his master, or put out his force.<br>

 Rebellious to the rein or goading spur.</td></tr>

 He, when the king would urge him, takes the rest,<br>
 Or, when he curbs him, runs in giddy rings;<br>

 And now the furious Saracen distressed,<br>
 Sees ’tis no time to tame the beast, and springs,<br>
 With one hand on the pummel, to the ground;<br>
 Clear of the restless courser at a bound.</td></tr>

 As soon as Sacripant, with well-timed leap,<br>
 Is from the fury of Bayardo freed,<br>
 You may believe the battle does not sleep<br>
 Between those champions, matched in heart and deed.<br>
 Their sounding blades such changeful measure keep,<br>
 The hammer-strokes of Vulcan with less speed<br>
 Descend in that dim cavern, where he heats,<br>
 And Jove’s red thunders on his anvil beats.</td></tr>

 Sometimes they lunge, then feign the thrust and parry:<br>
 Deep masters of the desperate game they play;<br>
 Or rise upon the furious stroke, and carry<br>
 Their swords aloft, or stoop and stand at bay.<br>
 Again they close, again exhausted tarry;<br>
 Now hide, now show themselves, and now give way,<br>
 And where one knight an inch of ground has granted,<br>
 His foeman’s foot upon that inch is planted.</td></tr>

 When, lo! Rinaldo, now impatient grown,<br>
 Strikes full at Sacripant with lifted blade;<br>
 And he puts forth his buckler made of bone,<br>
 And well with strong and stubborn steel inlaid:<br>
 Though passing thick, Fusberta cleaves it: groan<br>
 Greenwood, and covert close, and sunny glade.<br>
 The paynim’s arm rings senseless with the blow,<br>

 When the fair damsel saw, with timid eye,<br>
 Such ruin follow from the faulchion’s sway,<br>
 She, like the criminal, whose doom is nigh,<br>
 Changed her fair countenance through sore dismay,<br>
 And deemed that little time was left to fly<br>
 If she would not be that Rinaldo’s prey,<br>
 Rinaldo loathed by her as much, as he<br>
 Doats on the scornful damsel miserably.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XII.</td><td>
 So turned her horse into the gloomy chase,<br>
 And drove him through rough path and tangled ally,<br>
 And oftentimes bent back her bloodless face,<br>
 And saw Rinaldo from each thicket sally.<br>
 Nor flying long had urged the frantic race,<br>
 Before she met a hermit in a valley.<br>
 Devotion in his aspect was expressed,<br>
 And his long beard descended on his breast.</td></tr>

 Wasted he was as much by fasts as age,<br>
 And on an ass was mounted, slow and sure;<br>
 His visage warranted that never sage<br>
 Had conscience more precise or passing pure.<br>
 Though in his arteries time had stilled the rage<br>
 Of blood, and spake him feeble and demure,<br>
 At sight of the delighted damsel, he<br>
 Was inly stirred for very charity.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XIV.</td><td>
 The lady prayed that kindly friar, that he<br>
 Would straight conduct her to some haven near,<br>
 For that she from the land of France might flee,<br>
 And never more of loathed Rinaldo hear.<br>
 The hermit, who was skilled in sorcery,<br>
 Ceased not to soothe the gentle damsel’s fear.<br>
 And with the promise of deliverance, shook<br>
 His pocket, and drew forth a secret book.</td></tr>

 This opened, quick and mighty marvel wrought;<br>
 For not a leaf is finished by the sage,<br>
 Before a spirit, by his bidding brought,<br>
 Waits his command in likeness of a page:<br>
 He, by the magic writ constrained and taught,<br>
 Hastes where the warriors face to face engage,<br>
 In the cool shade—but not in cool disport—<br>
 And steps between, and stops their battle short.</td></tr>

 “In courtesy,” he cried, “let either show<br>
 What his foe’s death to either can avail,<br>
 And what the guerdon conquest will bestow<br>
 On him who in the battle shall prevail,<br>
 If Roland, though he has not struck a blow,<br>
 Or snapt in fight a single link of mail,<br>
 To Paris-town conveys the damsel gay,<br>
 Who has engaged you in this bitter fray.</td></tr>

 “Within an easy mile I saw the peer<br>
 Pricking to Paris with that lady bright;<br>
 Riding, in merry mood, with laugh and jeer,<br>
 And mocking at your fierce and fruitless fight.<br>
 Sure it were better, while they yet are near,<br>
 To follow peer and damsel in their flight:<br>
 For should he once in Paris place his prize<br>
 The lady never more shall meet your eyes.”</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XVIII.</td><td>
 You might have seen those angry cavaliers<br>
 Change at the demon’s tale for rage and shame;<br>
 And curse themselves as wanting eyes and ears,<br>
 To let their rival cheat them of the dame.<br>
 Towards his horse the good Rinaldo steers,<br>
 Breathing forth piteous sighs which seem of flame;<br>
 And, if he joins Orlando—ere they part—<br>
 Swears in his fury he will have his heart.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XIX.</td><td>
 So, passing where the prompt Bayardo stood,<br>
 Leaps on his back, and leaves, as swift as wind,<br>
 Without farewell, his rival in the wood;<br>
 Much less invites him to a seat behind.<br>
 The goaded charger, in his heat of blood,<br>
 Forces whate’er his eager course confined,<br>
 Ditch, river, tangled thorn, or marble block;<br>
 He swims the river, and he clears the rock.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XX.</td><td>
 Let it not, sir, sound strangely in your ear<br>
 Rinaldo took the steed thus readily,<br>
 So long and vainly followed far and near;<br>
 For he, endued with reasoning faculty,<br>
 Had not in vice lured on the following peer,<br>
 But fled before his cherished lord, that he<br>
 Might guide him whither went the gentle dame,<br>
 For whom, as he had heard, he nursed a flame.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXI.</td><td>
 For when Angelica, in random dread,<br>
 From the pavilion winged her rapid flight,<br>
 Bayardo marked the damsel as she fled,<br>
 His saddle lightened of Mount Alban’s knight;<br>
 Who then on foot an equal combat sped,<br>
 Matched with a baron of no meaner might;<br>
 And chased the maid by woods, and floods, and strands,<br>
 In hopes to place her in the warrior’s hands.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXII.</td><td>
 And, with desire to bring him to the maid,<br>
 Gallopped before him still with rampant play;<br>
 But would not let his master mount, afraid<br>
 That he might make him take another way.<br>
 So luring on Rinaldo through the shade,<br>
 Twice brought him to his unexpected prey;<br>
 Twice foiled in his endeavour: once by bold<br>
 Ferrau; then Sacripant, as lately told.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXIII.</td><td>
 Now good Bayardo had believed the tiding<br>
 Of that fair damsel, which produced the accord;<br>
 And in the devil’s cunning tale confiding,<br>
 Renewed his wonted service to his lord.<br>
 Behold Rinaldo then in fury riding,<br>
 And pushing still his courser Paris-ward!<br>
 Though he fly fast, the champion’s wishes go<br>
 Faster; and wind itself had seemed too slow.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXIV.</td><td>
 At night Rinaldo rests his steed, with pain<br>
 To meet Anglante’s lord he burned so sore;<br>
 And lent such credit to the tidings vain<br>
 Of the false courier of that wizard hoar:<br>
 And that day and the next, with flowing rein,<br>
 Rode, till the royal city rose before<br>
 His eyes; where Charlemagne had taken post,<br>
 With the sad remnant of his broken host.</td></tr>

 He, for he fears the Afric king’s pursuit,<br>
 And sap and siege, upon his vassals calls<br>
 To gather in fresh victual, and recruit<br>
 And cleanse their ditches, and repair their walls.<br>
 And what may best annoy the foes, and suit<br>
 For safety, without more delay forestalls;<br>
 And plans an embassy to England, thence<br>
 To gather fresher forces for defence.</td></tr>

 For he is bent again to try the fate<br>
 Of arms in tented field, though lately shamed;<br>
 And send Rinaldo to the neighbouring state<br>
 Of Britain, which was after England named.<br>
 Ill liked the Paladin to cross the strait;<br>
 Not that the people or the land he blamed,<br>
 But that King Charles was sudden; nor a day<br>
 Would grant the valiant envoy for delay.</td></tr>

 Rinaldo never executed thing<br>
 Less willingly, prevented in his quest<br>
 Of that fair visage he was following,<br>
 Whose charms his heart had ravished from his breast.<br>
 Yet, in obediance to the christian king,<br>
 Prepared himself to do the royal hest.<br>
 To Calais the good envoy wends with speed,<br>
 And the same day embarks himself and steed.</td></tr>

 Stirred up the waves; and, ’mid the gathering gloom,<br>

 That topmast-high the flashing waters flew.</td></tr>

 Passing in vice the villains of his race.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LIX.</td><td>
 With aspect changing still, the beauteous dame<br>
 Hears what the mournful Maganzese narrates;<br>
 And, at first mention of Rogero’s name,<br>
 Her radiant face with eager joy dilates.<br>
 But, full of pity, kindles into flame<br>
 As Pinabel his cruel durance states.<br>
 Nor finds she, though twice told, the story stale;<br>
 But makes him oft repeat and piece his tale.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LX.</td><td>
 And, after, when she deemed that all was clear,<br>
 Cried to the knight, “Repose upon my say.<br>
 To thee may my arrival well be dear,<br>
 And thou as fortunate account this day.<br>
 Straight wend me to the keep, sir cavalier,<br>
 Which holds a jewel of so rich a ray:<br>
 Nor shalt thou grudge thy labour and thy care,<br>
 If envious Fortune do but play me fair.”</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXI.</td><td>
 The knight replied, “Then nought to me remains<br>
 But that I yonder mountain-passes show;<br>
 And sure ’tis little loss to lose my pains,<br>
 Where every thing is lost I prize below.<br>
 But you would climb yon cliffs, and for your gains<br>
 Will find a prison-house, and be it so!<br>
 Whate’er betide you, blame yourself alone;<br>
 You go forewarned to meet a fate foreshown.”</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXII.</td><td>
 So said, the cavalier remounts his horse,<br>
 And serves the gallant damsel as a guide;<br>
 Who is prepared Rogero’s gaol to force,<br>
 Or to be slain, or in his prison stied.<br>
 When lo! a messenger, in furious course,<br>
 Called to the dame to stay, and rode and cried.<br>
 This was the post who told Circassa’s lord<br>
 What valiant hand had stretched him on the sward.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXIII.</td><td>
 The courier, who so plied his restless heel,<br>
 News of Narbonne and of Montpelier bore:<br>
 How both had raised the standard of Castile,<br>
 All Acquamorta siding with the Moor;<br>
 And how Marseilles’ disheartened men appeal<br>
 To her, who should protect her straightened shore;<br>
 And how, through him, her citizens demand<br>
 Counsel and comfort at their captain’s hand.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXIV.</td><td>
 This goodly town, with many miles of plain,<br>
 Which lie ’twixt Var and Rhone, upon the sea,<br>
 To her was given by royal Charlemagne:<br>
 Such trust he placed in her fidelity.<br>
 Still wont with wonder on the tented plain<br>
 The prowess of that valiant maid to see.<br>
 And now the panting courier, as I said,<br>
 Rode from Marseilles to ask the lady’s aid.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXV.</td><td>
 Whether or not she should the call obey,<br>
 The youthful damsel doubts some little space;<br>
 Strong in one balance Fame and Duty weigh,<br>
 But softer thoughts both Fame and Duty chase:<br>
 And she, at length, resolved the emprize to assay,<br>
 And free Rogero from the enchanted place:<br>
 Or, should her valour in the adventure fail,<br>
 Would with the cherished lover share his jail.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXVI.</td><td>
 And did with such excuse that post appay,<br>
 He was contented on her will to wait:<br>
 Then turned the bridle to resume her way<br>
 With Pinabel, who seemed no whit elate.<br>
 Since of that line he knows the damsel gay,<br>
 Held in such open and such secret hate;<br>
 And future trouble to himself foresees,<br>
 Were he detected as a Maganzese.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXVII.</td><td>
 For ’twixt Maganza’s and old Clermont’s line<br>
 There was an ancient and a deadly feud:<br>
 And oft to blows the rival houses came,<br>
 And oft in civil blood their hands embrued.<br>
 And hence some treason to this gentle dame<br>
 In his foul heart, the wicked County brewed;<br>
 Or, as the first occasion served, would stray<br>
 Out of the road, and leave her by the way.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXVIII.</td><td>
 And so the traitor’s troubled fancy rack<br>
 Fear, doubt, and his own native, rancorous mood,<br>
 That unawares he issued from the track,<br>
 And found himself within a gloomy wood:<br>
 Where a rough mountain reared its shaggy back,<br>
 Whose stony peak above the forest stood;<br>
 The daughter of Dodona’s duke behind,<br>
 Dogging his footsteps through the thicket blind.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXIX.</td><td>
 He, when he saw himself within the brake,<br>
 Thought to abandon his unweeting foe;<br>
 And to the dame—“ ’Twere better that we make<br>
 For shelter ere the gathering darkness grow;<br>
 And, yonder mountain past, (save I mistake)<br>
 A tower is seated in the vale below.<br>
 Do you expect me then, while from the peak<br>
 I measure the remembered place I seek.”</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXX.</td><td>
 So said, he pushed his courser up the height<br>
 Of that lone mountain; in his evil mind<br>
 Revolving, as he went, some scheme or sleight<br>
 To rid him of the gentle dame behind.<br>
 When lo! a rocky cavern met his sight,<br>
 Amid those precipices dark and blind:<br>
 Its sides descended thirty yards and more,<br>
 Worked smooth, and at the bottom was a door.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXXI.</td><td>
 A void was at the bottom, where a wide<br>
 Portal conducted to an inner room:<br>
 From thence a light shone out on every side,<br>
 As of a torch illumining the gloom.<br>
 Fair Bradamant pursued her faithless guide,<br>
 Suspended there, and pondering on her doom:<br>
 And came upon the felon where he stood,<br>
 Fearing lest she might lose him in the wood.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXXII.</td><td>
 When her approach the County’s first intent<br>
 Made vain, the wily traitor sought to mend<br>
 His toils, and some new stratagem invent<br>
 To rid her thence, or bring her to her end.<br>
 And so to meet the approaching lady went,<br>
 And showed the cave, and prayed her to ascend;<br>
 And said that in its bottom he had seen<br>
 A gentle damsel of bewitching mien.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXXIII.</td><td>
 Who, by her lovely semblance and rich vest,<br>
 Appeared a lady of no mean degree;<br>
 But melancholy, weeping, and distressed,<br>
 As one who pined there in captivity;<br>
 And that when he towards the entrance pressed,<br>
 To learn who that unhappy maid might be,<br>
 One on the melancholy damsel flew,<br>
 And her within that inner cavern drew.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXXIV.</td><td>
 The beauteous Bradamant, who was more bold<br>
 Than wary, gave a ready ear; and, bent<br>
 To help the maid, imprisoned in that hold,<br>
 Sought but the means to try the deep descent.<br>
 Then, looking round, descried an elm-tree old,<br>
 Which furnished present means for her intent;<br>
 And from the tree, with boughs and foliage stored,<br>
 Lopt a long branch, and shaped it with her sword.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXXV.</td><td>
 The severed end she to the count commended,<br>
 Then, grasping it, hung down that entrance steep.<br>
 With her feet foremost, by her arms suspended:<br>
 When asking if she had the skill to leap,<br>
 The traitor, with a laugh, his hands extended.<br>
 And plunged his helpless prey into the deep.<br>
 “And thus,” exclaimed the ruffian, “might I speed<br>
 With thee each sucker of thy cursed seed!”</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXXVI.</td><td>
 But not, as was the will of Pinabel,<br>
 Such cruel lot fair Bradamant assayed;<br>
 For striking on the bottom of the cell,<br>
 The stout elm-bough so long her weight upstayed,<br>
 That, though it split and splintered where it fell,<br>
 It broked her fall, and saved the gentle maid.<br>
 Some while astounded there the lady lay,<br>
 As the ensuing canto will display.</td></tr>
