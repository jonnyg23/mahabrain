 H<small>OW</small> many enchantresses among us! oh,<br>
 How many enchanters are there, though unknown!<br>
 Who for their love make man or woman glow,<br>
 Changing them into figures not their own.<br>
 Nor this by help of spirits from below,<br>
 Nor observation of the stars is done:<br>
 But these on hearts with fraud and falsehood plot,<br>
 Binding them with indissoluble knot.</td></tr>

 Who with Angelica’s, or rather who<br>
 Were fortified with Reason’s ring, would see<br>
 Each countenance, exposed to open view,<br>
 Unchanged by art or by hypocrisy.<br>
 This now seems fair and good, whose borrowed hue<br>
 Removed, would haply foul and evil be.<br>
 Well was it for Rogero that he wore<br>
 The virtuous ring which served the truth to explore!</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">III.</td><td>
 Rogero, still dissembling, as I said,<br>
 Armed, to the gate on Rabican did ride;<br>
 Found the guard unprepared, not let his blade,<br>
 Amid that crowd, hang idle at his side:<br>
 He passed the bridge, and broke the palisade,<br>
 Some slain, some maimed; then t’wards the forest hied;<br>
 But on that road small space had measured yet,<br>
 When he a servant of the fairy met.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">IV.</td><td>
 He on his fist a ravening falcon bore,<br>
 Which he made fly for pastime every day;<br>
 Now on the champaign, now upon the shore<br>
 Of neighbouring pool, which teemed with certain prey;<br>
 And rode a hack which simple housings wore,<br>
 His faithful dog, companion of his way.<br>
 He, marking well the haste with which he hies,<br>
 Conjectures truly what Rogero flies.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">V.</td><td>
 Towards him came the knave, with semblance haught,<br>
 Demanding whither in such haste he sped:<br>
 To him the good Rogero answers naught.<br>
 He hence assured more clearly that he fled,<br>
 Within himself to stop the warrior thought,<br>
 And thus, with his left arm extended, said:<br>
 “What, if I suddenly thy purpose balk,<br>
 And thou find no defence against this hawk?”</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">VI.</td><td>
 Then flies his bird, who works so well his wing,<br>
 Rabican cannot distance him in flight:<br>
 The falconer from his back to ground did spring,<br>
 And freed him from the bit which held him tight;<br>
 Who seemed an arrow parted from the string,<br>
 And terrible to foe, with kick and bite;<br>
 While with such haste behind the servant came,<br>
 He sped as moved by wind, or rather flame.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">VII.</td><td>
 Nor will the falconer’s dog appear more slow;<br>
 But hunts Rogero’s courser, as in chace<br>
 Of timid hare the pard is wont to go.<br>
 Not to stand fast the warrior deems disgrace,<br>
 And turns towards the swiftly-footed foe,<br>
 Whom he sees wield a riding-wand, place<br>
 Of other arms, to make his dog obey.<br>
 Rogero scorns his faulchion to display.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">VIII.</td><td>
 The servant made at him, and smote him sore;<br>
 The dog his left foot worried; while untied<br>
 From rein, the lightened horse three times and more<br>
 Lashed from the croup, nor missed his better side.<br>
 The hawk, oft wheeling, with her talons tore<br>
 The stripling, and his horse so terrified,<br>
 The courser, by the whizzing sound dismayed,<br>
 Little the guiding hand or spur obeyed.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">IX.</td><td>
 Constrained at length, his sword Rogero drew<br>
 To clear the rabble, who his course delay;<br>
 And in the animals’ or villain’s view<br>
 Did now its point, and now its edge display.<br>
 But with more hinderance and vexatious crew<br>
 Swarm here and there, and wholly block the way;<br>
 And that dishonour will ensue and loss,<br>
 Rogero sees, if him they longer cross.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">X.</td><td>
 He knew each little that he longer stayed,<br>
 Would bring the fay and followers on the trail;<br>
 Already drums were beat, and trumpets brayed,<br>
 And larum-bells rang loud in every vale.<br>
 An act too foul it seemed to use his blade<br>
 On dog, and knave unfenced with arms or mail:<br>
 A better and shorter way it were<br>
 The buckler, old Atlantes’ work, to bare.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XI.</td><td>
 He raised the crimson cloth in which he wore<br>
 The wondrous shield, enclosed for many a day;<br>
 Its beams, as proved a thousand times before,<br>
 Work as they wont, when on the sight they play;<br>
 Senseless the falconer tumbles on the moor;<br>
 Drop dog and hackney; drop the pinions gay,<br>
 Which poised in air the bird no longer keep:<br>
 Then glad Rogero leaves a prey to sleep.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XII.</td><td>
 In the mean time, Alcina, who had heard<br>
 How he had forced the gate, and, in the press,<br>
 Slaughtered a mighty number of her guard,<br>
 Remained nigh dead, o’erwhelmed with her distress:<br>
 She tore her vesture, and her visage marred,<br>
 And cursed her want of wit and wariness.<br>
 Then made forthwith her meiny sound to arms,<br>
 And round herself arrayed her martial swarms.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XIII.</td><td>
 Divided next, one squadron by the way<br>
 Rogero took, she sent; the bands were two:<br>
 She at the port embarked the next array,<br>
 And straight to sea dispatched the warlike crew.<br>
 With this good squadron went the desperate fay,<br>
 And darked by loosened sails the billows grew;<br>
 For so desire upon her bosom preyed,<br>
 Of troops she left her city unpurveyed.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XIV.</td><td>
 Without a guard she left her palace there,<br>
 Which to Melissa, prompt her time to seize,<br>
 To loose her vassals that in misery were,<br>
 Afforded all convenience and full ease;<br>
 —To range, at leisure, through the palace fair,<br>
 And so examine all her witcheries;<br>
 To raze the seal, burn images, and loose<br>
 Or cancel hag-knot, rhomb, or magic noose.</td></tr>

 Thence, through the fields, fast hurrying from that dome,<br>
 The former lovers changed, a mighty train,<br>
 Some into rock or tree, to fountain some,<br>
 Or beast, she made assume their shapes again:<br>
 And these, when they anew are free to roam,<br>
 Follow Rogero’s footsteps to the reign<br>
 Of Logistilla’s sage; and from that bourn<br>
 To Scythia, Persia, Greece, and Ind return.</td></tr>

 They to their several homes dispatched, repair,<br>
 Bound by a debt which never can be paid:<br>
 The English duke, above the rest her care,<br>
 Of these, was first in human form arrayed:<br>
 For much his kindred and the courteous prayer<br>
 Of good Rogero with Melissa weighed.<br>
 Beside his prayers, the ring Rogero gave;<br>
 That him she by its aid might better save.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XVII.</td><td>
 Thus by Rogero’s suit the enchantress won,<br>
 To his first shape transformed the youthful peer;<br>
 But good Melissa deemed that nought was done<br>
 Save she restored his armour, and that spear<br>
 Of gold, which whensoe’er at tilt he run,<br>
 At the first touch unseated cavalier;<br>
 Once Argalìa’s, next Astolpho’s lance,<br>
 And source of mighty fame to both in France.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XVIII.</td><td>
 The sage Melissa found this spear of gold,<br>
 Which now Alcina’s magic palace graced,<br>
 And other armour of the warrior bold,<br>
 Of which he was in that ill dome uncased.<br>
 She climbed the courser of the wizard old,<br>
 And on the croup, at ease, Astolpho placed:<br>
 And thus, an hour before Rogero came,<br>
 Repaired to Logistilla, knight and dame.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XIX.</td><td>
 Meantime, through rugged rocks, and shagged with thorn,<br>
 Rogero wends, to seek the sober fay;<br>
 From cliff to cliff, from path to path forlorn,<br>
 A rugged, lone, inhospitable way:<br>
 Till he, with labour huge oppressed and worn,<br>
 Issued at noon upon a beach, that lay<br>
 ’Twixt sea and mountain, open to the south,<br>
 Deserted, barren, bare, and parched with drouth.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XX.</td><td>
 The sunbeams on the neighbouring mountain beat<br>
 And glare, reflected from the glowing mass<br>
 So fiercely, sand and air both boil with heat,<br>
 In mode that might have more than melted glass.<br>
 The birds are silent in their dim retreat,<br>
 Nor any note is heard in wood or grass,<br>
 Save the bough-perched Cicala’s wearying cry,<br>
 Which deafens hill and dale, and sea and sky.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXI.</td><td>
 The heat and thirst and labour which he bore<br>
 By that drear sandy way beside the sea,<br>
 Along the unhabited and sunny shore,<br>
 Were to Rogero grievous company:<br>
 Bur for I may not still pursue this lore,<br>
 Nor should you busied with one matter be,<br>
 Rogero I abandon in this heat,<br>
 For Scotland; to pursue Rinaldo’s beat.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXII.</td><td>
 By king, by daughter, and by all degrees,<br>
 To Sir Rinaldo was large welcome paid;<br>
 And next the warrior, at his better ease,<br>
 The occasion of his embassy displayed:<br>
 ‘That he from thence and England, subsidies<br>
 Of men was seeking, for his monarch’s aid,<br>
 In Charles’s name;’ and added, in his care,<br>
 The justest reasons to support his prayer.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXIII.</td><td>
 The king made answer, that ‘without delay,<br>
 Taxed to the utmost of his power and might,<br>
 His means at Charlemagne’s disposal lay,<br>
 For the honour of the empire and the right.<br>
 And that, within few days, he in array<br>
 Such horsemen, as he had in arms, would dight;<br>
 And, save that he was now waxed old, would lead<br>
 The expedition he was prayed to speed.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXIV.</td><td>
 ‘Nor like consideration would appear<br>
 Worthy to stop him, but that he possessed<br>
 A son, and for such charge that cavalier,<br>
 Measured by wit and force, was worthiest.<br>
 Though not within the kingdom was the peer,<br>
 It was his hope (as he assured his guest)<br>
 He would, while yet preparing was the band,<br>
 Return, and find it mustered to his hand.’</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXV.</td><td>
 So sent through all his realm, with expedition,<br>
 His treasures, to levy men and steeds;<br>
 And ships prepared, and warlike ammunition,<br>
 And money, stores and victual for their needs.<br>
 Meantime the good Rinaldo on his mission,<br>
 Leaving the courteous king, to England speeds;<br>
 He brought him on his way to Berwick’s town,<br>
 And was observed to weep when he was gone.</td></tr>

 The wind sat in the poop; Rinaldo good<br>
 Embarked and bade farewell to all; the sheet<br>
 Still loosening to the breeze, the skipper stood,<br>
 Till where Thames’ waters, waxing bitter, meet<br>
 Salt ocean: wafted thence by tide of flood,<br>
 Through a sure channel to fair London’s seat,<br>
 Safely the mariners their course explore,<br>
 Making their way, with aid of sail and oar.</td></tr>

 The Emperor Charles, and he, King Otho grave,<br>
 Who was with Charles, by siege in Paris pressed,<br>

 And countersigns had given, dispatched to crave<br>
 What foot and horse were by the land possessed.<br>
 The whole to be to Calais’ port conveyed;<br>
 That it to France and Charles might furnish aid.</td></tr>

 In Britain, or the isles which round her lay,<br>
 To assemble near the sea he fixed a day.</td></tr>

 But here, sir, it behoves me shift my ground,<br>
 Like him that makes the sprightly viol ring,<br>
 Who often changes chord and varies sound,<br>
 And now a graver strikes, now sharper string:<br>
 Thus I:—who did to good Rinaldo bound<br>
 My tale, Angelica remembering;<br>
 Late left, where saved from him by hasty flight,<br>
 She had encountered with an anchorite.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXX.</td><td>
 Awhile I will pursue her story: I<br>
 Told how the maid of him with earnest care,<br>
 Enquired, how she towards the shore might fly:<br>
 Who of the loathed Rinaldo has such fear,<br>
 She dreads, unless she pass the sea, to die,<br>
 As insecure in Europe, far or near,<br>
 But she was by the hermit kept in play,<br>
 Because he pleasure took with her to stay.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXXI.</td><td>
 His heart with love of that rare beauty glowed,<br>
 And to his frozen marrow pierced the heat;<br>
 Who, after, when he saw that she bestowed<br>
 Small care on him, and thought but of retreat,<br>
 His sluggish courser stung with many a goad;<br>
 But with no better speed he plied his feet.<br>
 Ill was his walk, and worse his trot; nor spur<br>
 Could that dull beast to quicker motion stir:</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXXII.</td><td>
 And for the flying maid was far before,<br>
 And he would soon have ceased to track her steed,<br>
 To the dark cave recurred the hermit hoar,<br>
 And conjured up of fiends a grisly breed:<br>
 One he selected out of many more,<br>
 And first informed the demon of his need;<br>
 Then in the palfrey bade him play his part,<br>
 Who with the lady bore away his heart:</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXXIII.</td><td>
 And as sagacious dog on mountain tried<br>
 Before, accustomed fox or hare to chase,<br>
 If he behold the quarry choose one side,<br>
 The other takes, and seems to slight the trace:<br>
 But at the turn arriving, is espied,<br>
 Already tearing what he crossed to face;<br>
 So her the hermit by a different road<br>
 Will meet, wherever she her palfrey goad.</td></tr>

 What was the friar’s design I well surmise;<br>
 And you shall know; but in another page.<br>
 Angelica now slow, now faster, flies,<br>
 Nought fearing this: while conjured by the sage,<br>
 The demon covered in the courser lies;<br>
 As fire sometimes will hide its smothered rage:<br>
 Then blazes with devouring flame and heat,<br>
 Unquenchable, and scarce allows retreat.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXXV.</td><td>
 After the flying maid had shaped her course<br>
 By the great sea which laves the Gascon shore,<br>
 Still keeping to the rippling waves her horse,<br>
 Where best the moistened sand the palfrey bore,<br>
 Him, plunged into the brine, the fiend perforce<br>
 Dragged, till he swam amid the watery roar.<br>
 Nor what to do the timid damsel knew,<br>
 Save that she closer to her saddle grew.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXXVI.</td><td>
 She cannot, howsoe’er the rein she ply,<br>
 Govern the horse, who swims the surge to meet:<br>
 Her raiment she collects and holds it high;<br>
 And, not to wet them, gathers up her feet.<br>
 Her tresses, which the breeze still wantonly<br>
 Assaults, dishevelled on her shoulders beat.<br>
 The louder winds are hushed, perchance in duty,<br>
 Intent, like ocean, on such sovereign beauty.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXXVII.</td><td>
 Landward in vain her eyes the damsel bright<br>
 Directs, which water face and breast with tears,<br>
 And ever sees, decreasing to her sight,<br>
 The beach she left, which less and less appears.<br>

 After a mighty sweep, the lady bears<br>
 To shore, where rock and cavern shag the brink,<br>
 As night upon the land begins to sink.</td></tr>

 When in that desert, which but to descry<br>
 Bred fear in the beholder, stood the maid<br>
 Alone, as Phœbus, plunged in ocean, sky<br>

 Might leave whoever had the form surveyed,<br>

 Resemblance, coloured in the living rock.</td></tr>
