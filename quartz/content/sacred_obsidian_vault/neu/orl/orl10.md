 Another love assails Bireno’s breast,<br>

 O<small>F</small> all the loves, of all fidelity<br>
 Yet proved, of all the constant hearts and true,<br>
 Of all the lovers, in felicity<br>
 Or sorrow faithful found, a famous crew,<br>

 Rather than second: if this be not due,<br>

 Of truer love, in present times or old.</td></tr>

 And this she by so many proofs and clear,<br>

 To man, though he her open heart explored:<br>

 And they in mutual love deserve reward,<br>
 Bireno as himself, nay, he above<br>
 Himself, I say, should kind Olympia love.</td></tr>

 And what is sweet to taste, touch, hear, and see,<br>
 And life and fame, and all beside; if aught<br>
 More precious can in truth be styled, or thought.</td></tr>

 And when you shall have heard the impiety,<br>

 Heaps promises and vows, aye prompt to swear,<br>
 Which afterwards all winds disperse in air.</td></tr>

 Of those in the first flower of youth beware,<br>

 A daughter they have found (above was said)<br>
 Of the proud king who ruled the Friesland state;<br>
 That with Bireno’s brother was to wed,<br>
 As far as rumour tells; but to relate<br>

 The sight of food so passing delicate;<br>

 For other’s sake, a foolish courtesy.</td></tr>

 Than that which on Bireno’s bosom fed,<br>

 The fate of her unhappy father dead,<br>
 He saw her bathed in ceaseless tears deplore:<br>
 And, as cold water, on the cauldron shed,<br>
 Shops short the bubbling wave, which boiled before;<br>
 So was the raging rife Olympia blew<br>
 Within his breast, extinguished by a new.</td></tr>

 Nor feels Bireno mere satiety;<br>
 He loathes her so, he ill endures her sight;<br>

 For other such his fickle appetite!<br>
 Yet till the day prefixed to satisfy<br>
 His fond desire, so feigns the wary knight,<br>
 Olympia less to love than to adore<br>
 He seems, and but her pleasure to explore.</td></tr>

 And if the other he too much caress,<br>
 Who cannot but caress her, there are none<br>

 Whom Fortune’s wheel beats down in changeful run,<br>
 Was never blamed; with glory oftener paid;<br>
 —So much the more, a young—a harmless maid.</td></tr>

 Almighty God! how fallible and vain<br>
 Is human judgment, dimmed by clouds obscure!<br>

 Have loosed his vessel from the port secure,<br>

 For Zealand through the deep, with meery cheer.</td></tr>

 As soon as they were harboured in a hight,<br>
 Olympia landed and the board was spread;<br>

 Supt, unsuspecting any cause for dread.<br>

 In pleasant place, repaired, and went to bed.<br>

 The fear and late sea sorrow, which had weighed<br>
 So long upon the dame and broke her rest,<br>

 Removed from noise, and, for her tranquil breast<br>

 No sheltered bear or dormouse sleeps more sound.</td></tr>

 The lover false, who, hatching treason lies,<br>
 Stole from his bed in silence, when he knew<br>
 She slept: his clothes he in a bundle ties,<br>
 Nor other raiment on his body threw.<br>

 As if on new-born wings, towards his crew;<br>
 Who, roused, unmoor without a cry, as he<br>
 Commands, and loosen thence and put to sea.</td></tr>

 Behind the land was left; and there to pine<br>
 Olympia, who yet slept the woods among;<br>
 Till from her gilded wheels the frosty rhine<br>
 Aurora upon earth beneath had flung;<br>
 And the old woe, beside the tumbling brine,<br>
 Lamenting, halcyons mournful descant sung;<br>
 When she, ’twixt sleep and waking, made a strain<br>
 To reach her loved Bireno, but in vain.</td></tr>

 She no one found: the dame her arm withdrew;<br>
 She tried again, yet no one found; she spread<br>
 Both arms, now here, now there, and sought anew;<br>
 Now either leg; but yet no better sped.<br>
 Fear banished sleep; she oped her eyes: in view<br>
 Was nothing: she no more her widowed bed<br>
 Would keep, but from the couch in fury sprung,<br>
 And headlong forth from the pavilion flung.</td></tr>

 And seaward ran, her visage tearing sore,<br>
 Presaging, and now certain of her plight:<br>
 She beat her bosom, and her tresses tore,<br>
 And looked (the moon was shining) if she might<br>
 Discover any thing beside the shore;<br>
 Nor, save the shore, was any thing in sight.<br>
 She calls Bireno, and the caverns round,<br>
 Pitying her grief, Bireno’s name rebound.</td></tr>

 On the far shore there rose a rock; below<br>
 Scooped by the breaker’s beating frequently:<br>
 The cliff was hollowed underneath, in show<br>
 Of arch, and overhung the foaming sea.<br>
 Olympia (MIND such vigour did bestow)<br>
 Sprang up the frowning crest impetuously,<br>
 And, at a distance, stretched by favouring gale,<br>
 Thence saw her cruel lord’s departing sail.</td></tr>

 Saw it, or seemed to see: for ill her eyes,<br>
 Things through the air, yet dim and hazy, view.<br>
 She falls, all-trembling, on the ground, and lies<br>
 With face than snow more cold and white in hue:<br>
 But when she has again found strength to rise,<br>
 Guiding her voice towards the bark which flew,<br>
 Calling with all her might, the unhappy dame<br>
 Calls often on her cruel consort’s name.</td></tr>

 Where unavailing was the feeble note,<br>
 She wept and clapt her hands in agony.<br>
 “Without its freight,” she cried, “thy ship does float.<br>
 —Where, cruel, dost thou fly so swiftly?—Me<br>
 Receive as well:—small hinderance to thy boat,<br>
 Which bears my spirit, would my body be.”<br>
 And she her raiment waving in her hand,<br>
 Signed to the frigate to return to land.</td></tr>

 But the loud wind which, sweeping ocean, bears<br>
 The faithless stripling’s sail across the deep,<br>
 Bears off as well the shriek, and moan, and prayers<br>
 Of sad Olympia, sorrowing on the steep.<br>
 Thrice, cruel to herself, the dame prepares<br>
 From the high rock amid the waves to leap.<br>
 But from the water lifts at length her sight,<br>
 And there returns where she had passed the night.</td></tr>

 Stretched on the bed, upon her face she lay,<br>
 Bathing it with her tears. “Last night in thee<br>

 That I was born! What here remains to me<br>
 To do? What can be done?—Alone, betrayed—<br>
 Who will console me, who afford me aid?</td></tr>
