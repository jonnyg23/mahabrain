 Informed of all—already with that maid<br>

 Had on that day equipt a demon, borne<br>

 It suddenly came into Leo’s mind<br>
 The knight of whom she parlayed was that same,<br>

 To fall, albeit unpushed, to ground again.<br>

 Begirt, he lay reclined in plate and chain.<br>
 A pillow of his buckler had he made,<br>
 Where the white unicorn was seen pourtraid.</td></tr>

 There thinking what an injury he had done<br>
 To his lady love—how ingrate, how untrue<br>

 His cheeks, the tears unceasing ran, and through<br>
 The passion that so wrapt his troubled sprite,<br>
 Nor Leo nor Melissa heard the knight.</td></tr>

 Nor therefore interrupts he his lament,<br>
 Nor checks his sighs, nor checks his trickling tears.<br>

 Lights from his courser, and towards him steers:<br>

 Love is the cause; but yet from nought appears<br>
 Who is the person that such grief hath bred;<br>
 For by Rogero this remains unsaid.</td></tr>

 Is liked his sudden presence in that place;<br>

 And lest he should his wish for death withstand.</td></tr>

 Him with the sweetest words young Leo plied,<br>
 And with the warmest love that he could show,<br>

 But that there is deliverance from his woe,<br>
 So that the cause be known; nor he bereft<br>
 Of hope should ever be, so life be left.</td></tr>

 Thy deadly foeman I had reason due.<br>

 With friends, with following, and with life itself.</td></tr>

 He said; and with such forceful prayer appealed;<br>

 So here so there Rogero plied his sword,<br>
 He more than once the paynim’s armour bored.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXI.</td><td>
 When Rodomont beholds in that fierce close<br>
 His widely crimsoned arms, nor can restrain<br>
 The greater portion of those griding blows<br>
 From biting to the quick, through plate and chain,<br>
 He with more fury, with more rage o’erflows,<br>
 Than in mid winter the tempestrous main<br>
 Flings down his shield, and with both hands outright<br>
 Lays at Rogero’s helm with all his might.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXII.</td><td>
 With that excessive force, wherewith the gin,<br>
 Erected in two barges upon Po,<br>
 And raised by men and wheels, with deafening din<br>
 Descends upon the sharpened piles below,<br>
 With all his might he smote the paladin<br>
 With either hand; was never direr blow:<br>
 Him the charmed helmet helped, or—such its force—<br>
 The stroke would have divided man and horse.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXIII.</td><td>
 As if about to fall, the youthful lord<br>
 Twice nodded, opening legs and arms; anew<br>
 Rodomont smote, in that he would afford<br>
 His foe no time his spirits to renew:<br>
 Then threatened other stroke; but that fine sword<br>
 Bore not such hammering, and in shivers flew;<br>
 And the bold Saracen, bereft of brand<br>
 Was in the combat left with unarmed hand.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXIV.</td><td>
 But not for this doth Rodomont refrain:<br>
 He swoops upon the Child, unheeding aught:<br>
 So sore astounded is Rogero’s brain;<br>
 So wholly overclouded is his thought.<br>
 But him the paynim well awakes again,<br>
 Whom by the neck he with strong arm has caught,<br>
 And gripes and grapples with such mighty force,<br>
 He falls on earth, pulled headlong from his horse.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXV.</td><td>
 Yet leaps from earth as nimbly, moved by spleen<br>
 Far less than shame; for on his gentle bride<br>
 He turned his eyes, and that fair face serene<br>
 Now troubled the disdainful warrior spied.<br>
 She in sore doubt her champion’s fall had seen;<br>
 And well nigh at that sight the lady died.<br>
 Rogero, quickly to revenge the affront,<br>
 Clutches his sword and faces Rodomont.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXVI.</td><td>
 He at Rogero rode, who that rude shock<br>
 Shunned warily, retiring from his ground,<br>
 And, as he past, the paynim’s bridle took<br>
 With his left had, and turned his courser round;<br>
 While with his right he at his rider struck,<br>
 Whom he in belly, flank and breast would wound;<br>
 And twice sore anguish felt the monarch, gored<br>
 In flank and thigh, by good Rogero’s sword.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXVII.</td><td>
 Rodomont, grasping still in that close fight<br>
 The hilt and pommel of his broken blade,<br>
 Layed at Rogero’s helmet with such might,<br>
 That him another stroke might have dismaid:<br>
 But good Rogero, who should win of right,<br>
 Seizing his arm, the king so rudely swayed,<br>
 Bringing his left his better hand to speed,<br>
 That he pulled down the paynim from his steed.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXVIII.</td><td>
 Through force or skill, so fell the Moorish lord,<br>
 He stood his match, I rather ought to say<br>
 Fell on his feet; because Rogero’s sword<br>
 Gave him, ’twas deemed, advantage in the fray.<br>
 Rogero stands aloof, with wary ward<br>
 As fain to keep the paynim king at bay.<br>
 For the wise champion will not let a wight<br>
 So talk and bulky close with him in fight;</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXIX.</td><td>
 Rogero flank and thigh dyed red beheld,<br>
 And other wounds; and hoped he would have failed<br>
 By little and by little, as it welled;<br>
 So that he finally should have prevailed.<br>
 His hilt and pommel in his fist yet held<br>
 The paynim, which with all his might he scaled<br>
 At young Rogero; whom he smote so sore,<br>
 The stripling never was so stunned before.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXX.</td><td>
 In the helmet-cheek and shoulder-bone below<br>
 The Child was smit, and left so sore astound,<br>
 He, tripping still and staggering to and fro,<br>
 Scarce kept himself from falling to the ground.<br>
 Rodomont fain would close upon his foe;<br>
 But his foot fails him, weakened by the wound,<br>
 Which pierced his thigh: he overtasked his might;<br>
 And on his kneepan fell the paynim knight.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXXI.</td><td>
 Rogero lost no time, and with fierce blows<br>
 Smote him in face and bosom with his brand;<br>
 Hammered, and held the Saracen so close,<br>
 To ground he bore that champion with his hand.<br>
 But he so stirred himself, again he rose:<br>
 He gripes Rogero so, fast locked they stand.<br>
 Seconding their huge vigour by address,<br>
 They circle one another, shake, and press.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXXII.</td><td>
 His wounded thigh and gaping flank had sore<br>
 Weakened the vigour of the Moorish king:<br>
 Rogero had address; had mickle lore;<br>
 Was greatly practised in the wrestlers’ ring:<br>
 He marked his vantage, nor from strife forbore;<br>
 And, where he saw the blood most freely spring,<br>
 And where most wounded was the warrior, prest<br>
 The paynim with his feet, his arms, and breast.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXXIII.</td><td>
 Rodomont filled with spite and rage, his foe<br>
 Takes by the neck and shoulders, and now bends<br>
 Towards him, and now pushes from him; now<br>
 Raises from earth, and on his chest suspends;<br>
 Whirls here and there and grapples; and to throw<br>
 The stripling sorely in that strife contends.<br>
 Collected in himself, Rogero wrought,<br>
 To keep his vantage taxing strength and thought.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXXIV.</td><td>
 So shifting oft his hold, about the Moor<br>
 His arms the good and bold Rogero wound;<br>
 Against his left flank shoved his breast, and sore<br>
 Strained him with all his strength engirdled round.<br>
 At once he past his better leg before<br>
 Rodomont’s knees and pushed, and from the ground<br>
 Uplifted high in air the Moorish lord;<br>
 Then hurled him down head foremost on the sward.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXXV.</td><td>
 Such was the shock wherewith King Rodomont<br>
 With battered head and spine the champion smote,<br>
 That, issuing from his wounds as from a font,<br>
 Streams of red blood the crimsoned herbage float.<br>
 Rogero, holding Fortune by the front,<br>
 Lest he should rise, with one hand griped his throat,<br>
 With one a dagger at his eyes addrest;<br>
 And with his knees the paynim’s belly prest.</td></tr>

 As sometimes where they work the golden vein<br>
 Within Pannonian or Iberian cave,<br>
 In unexpected ruin whelm the train<br>
 By impious avarice there condemned to slave,<br>
 So with the load they lie opprest, with pain<br>
 A passage can their prisoned spirit have:<br>
 No less opprest the doughty paynim lay,<br>
 Pinned to the ground in that disastrous fray.</td></tr>

 Rogero at his vizor doth present<br>
 His naked poniard’s point, with threatening cry,<br>
 That he will slay him, save he yields, content<br>
 To let him live, if he for grace apply.<br>
 But Rodomont, who rather than be shent<br>
 For the least deed of shame, preferred to die,<br>
 Writhed, struggled, and with all his vigour tried<br>
 To pull Rogero down, and nought replied.</td></tr>

 As mastiff that below the deer-hound lies,<br>
 Fixed by the gullet fast, with holding bite,<br>
 Sorely bestirs himself and vainly tries,<br>
 With lips besmeared with foam and eyes alight,<br>
 And cannot from beneath the conqueror rise,<br>
 Who foils his foe by force, and not despite;<br>
 So vainly strives the monarch of Argier<br>
 To rise from underneath the cavalier.</td></tr>

 Yet Rodomont so twists and strives, he gains<br>
 The freedom of his better arm anew;<br>
 And with the right hand, which his poniard strains,<br>
 For he had drawn his deadly dagger too,<br>
 Would wound Rogero underneath the reins:<br>
 But now the wary youth the error knew<br>
 Through which he might have died, by his delay<br>
 That impious Saracen forthwith to slay;</td></tr>

 And smiting twice or thrice his horrid front,<br>
 Raising as high as he could raise in air<br>
 His dagger, buried it in Rodomont;<br>
 And freed himself withal from further care.<br>
 Loosed from the more than icy corse, to font<br>
 Of fetid Acheron, and hell’s foul repair,<br>
 The indignant spirit fled, blaspheming loud;<br>
 Erewhile on earth so haughty and so proud.</td></tr>
