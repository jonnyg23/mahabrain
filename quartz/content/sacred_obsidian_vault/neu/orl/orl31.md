 Rinaldo and Dudon fight; then friendship make,<br>

 The following day they met a cavalier,<br>
 Towards evening, with a lady by his side;<br>

 Whose ground a bar of silver did divide.<br>

 Young Richardetto to the joust defend:<br>
 He, prompt for battle, wheeled his courser round,<br>
 And for the tourney took sufficient ground.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">IX.</td><td>
 Between those knights no further parley past:<br>
 Without more question, charged the martial two.<br>
 Rinaldo with the friendly troop stood fast,<br>
 And looked to see what issue would ensue.<br>
 “Him from his saddle will I quickly cast,<br>
 If firm the footing, and mine arm prove true”;<br>
 Within himself young Richardetto cries:<br>
 But that encounter ends in other wise.</td></tr>

 Him underneath the vizor’s sight offends<br>

 But falls himself astounded on the mead;<br>
 Sore handled, and unhorsed by such a stroke,<br>
 His buckler in the cruel shock is broke.</td></tr>

 His lance Guichardo levelled, when he spied<br>
 Outstretched upon the field, the brethren two;<br>

 “For this third course to me is justly due”:<br>

 All to be foremost in the joust contend,<br>

 Saying, “ ’Tis time that we to Paris wend;<br>
 For us too long the tourney will detain,<br>
 If I expect till each his course has run,<br>
 And ye are all unseated, one by one.”</td></tr>

 So spake the knight, yet spake not in a tone<br>
 To be o’erheard in what he inly said;<br>
 Who thus foul scorn would to the rest have done.<br>
 Both now had wheeled, and fierce encounter made.<br>
 In the career Rinaldo was not thrown,<br>
 Who all the banded kinsmen much outweighed;<br>
 Their spears like brittle glass to pieces went,<br>
 But not an inch the champions backward bent.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XIV.</td><td>
 The chargers such a rough encounter made,<br>
 That on his crupper sank each staggering horse:<br>
 Rinaldo’s rose so quick, he might be said<br>
 Scarcely to interrupt his rapid course:<br>
 The stranger’s broke his spine and shoulder-blade;<br>
 That other shocked him with such desperate force.<br>
 When his lord sees him slain, he leaves his seat,<br>
 And in an instant springs upon his feet;</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XV.</td><td>
 And to his foe, that having wheeled anew,<br>
 Approached with hand unarmed, the warrior cried:<br>
 “Sir, to the goodly courser whom ye slew,<br>
 Because, whenas he lived, he was my pride,<br>
 I deem, I ill should render honour due,<br>
 If thus unvenged by my good arm he died;<br>
 And so fall on, and do as best ye may,<br>
 For we parforce must meet in new assay.”</td></tr>

 To him Rinaldo, “If we for thy horse<br>
 Have to contend in fight, and nought beside,<br>
 Take comfort, for I ween that with no worse<br>
 Thou, in his place, by me shalt be supplied.”<br>
 —“Thou errest if thou deem’st his loss the source<br>
 Of my regret” (the stranger knight replied);<br>
 “But I, since thou divinest not my speech,<br>
 To thee my meaning will more plainly teach.</td></tr>

 “I should esteem it were a foul misdeed,<br>
 Unless I proved thee also with the brand.<br>

 Better or worse than me, would understand:<br>
 Then, as it please, afoot or on thy steed,<br>
 Attack me, so it be with arms in hand.<br>
 I am content all vantage to afford;<br>
 Such my desire to try thee with the sword!”</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XVIII.</td><td>
 Not long Rinaldo paused: he cried, “I plight<br>
 My promise not to balk thee of the fray;<br>
 And, for I deem thou art a valiant knight,<br>
 And lest thou umbrage take at mine array,<br>
 These shall go on before, nor other wight,<br>
 Beside a page, to hold my horse, shall stay.”<br>
 So spake Mount Alban’s lord; and to his band,<br>
 To wend their way the warrior gave command.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XIX.</td><td>
 To that king paladin with praise replied<br>
 The stranger peer; alighting on the plain,<br>
 Rinaldo to the valet, at his side,<br>
 Consigned the goodly steed Bayardo’s rein,<br>
 And when his banner he no longer spied,<br>
 Now widely distant with the warrior’s train,<br>
 His buckler braced, his biting faulchion drew,<br>
 And to the field defied the knight anew.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XX.</td><td>
 And now each other they in fight assail:<br>
 Was never seen a feller strife in show.<br>
 Neither believes his foeman can avail,<br>
 Long, in that fierce debate, against his blow:<br>
 But when they knew, well neighed in doubtful scale,<br>
 That they were fitly matched, for weal or woe,<br>
 They laid their fury and their pride apart,<br>
 And for their vantage practised every art.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXI.</td><td>
 Their cruel and despiteous blows resound,<br>
 Re-echoing wide, what time the valiant twain<br>
 With cantlets of their shields now strew the ground,<br>
 Now with their faulchions sever plate and chain.<br>
 Yet more behoves to parry than to wound,<br>
 If either knight his footing would maintain;<br>
 For the first fault in fence, by either made,<br>
 Will with eternal mischief be appaid.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXII.</td><td>
 One hour and more than half another, stood<br>
 The knights in battle; and the golden sun<br>
 Already was beneath the tumbling flood,<br>
 And the horizon veiled with darkness dun:<br>
 Nor yet had they reposed, nor interlude<br>
 Had been, since that despiteous fight begun,<br>
 ’Twixt these, whom neither ire nor rancour warms,<br>
 But simple thirst of fame excites to arms.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXIII.</td><td>
 Rinaldo in himself revolving weighed<br>
 Who was the stranger knight, so passing stout;<br>
 That not alone him bravely had gainsaid,<br>
 But oft endangered in that deadly bout;<br>
 And has so harassed with his furious blade,<br>
 He of its final issue stands in doubt.<br>
 —He that the strife was ended would be fain,<br>
 So that his knightly honour took no stain.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXIV.</td><td>
 The stranger knight, upon the other side,<br>
 As little of his valiant foeman knew;<br>
 Nor in that lord Mount Alban’s chief descried,<br>
 In warfare so renowned all countries through.<br>
 And upon whom, with such small cause defied,<br>
 His faulchion he in deadly combat drew.<br>
 He was assured he could not have in fight<br>
 Experience of a more redoubted wight.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXV.</td><td>
 He gladly would be quit of the emprize<br>
 He undertook to venge his courser’s fall;<br>
 And, could he, without blame, a mean devise,<br>
 Would fain withdraw from that disastrous brawl.<br>
 So overcast already were the skies,<br>
 Their cruel strokes well nigh fell harmless all.<br>
 Both blindly strike; more blindly yet those lords<br>
 Parry the stroke, who scarce discern their swords.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXVI.</td><td>
 He of Mount Alban is the first to say,<br>
 They should not combat darkling, on the plain;<br>
 But should their duel till such time delay<br>
 As slow Arcturus should have turned his wain.<br>
 (And adds,) as safely as himself might stay<br>
 The foe in his pavilion, of his train<br>
 As duly tended, honoured, and well seen,<br>
 As he in any place had ever been.</td></tr>

 To pray him has Rinaldo little need:<br>
 He courteously accepts him for his host;<br>
 And thither the united warriors speed,<br>
 Where lies Mount Alban’s troop in chosen post.<br>
 From his attendant squire a goodly steed,<br>
 With sumptuous housings gorgeously embossed,<br>
 Rinaldo takes, with tempered sword and spear,<br>
 And these bestows upon the cavalier.</td></tr>

 For Montalbano’s lord the stranger guest,<br>
 The baron recognised, with whom he came;<br>
 Because, before they reached their place of rest,<br>
 The paladin had chanced himself to name;<br>
 And (for they brethren were) with love opprest,<br>
 His tenderness him wholly overcame;<br>
 And touched with kind affection, at his heart,<br>
 From his full eyes the tears of pleasure start.</td></tr>

 Guido the savage was that cavalier,<br>

 Long sailed the sea, as I erewhile have said;<br>

 By Pinnabel, the felon knight, delaid;<br>
 Seized by that traitor, and by him detained,<br>
 To enforce the wicked law he had ordained.</td></tr>

 Upraised his visage from the watery floor,<br>
