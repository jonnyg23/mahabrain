 Marphisa with Rogero moved her horse<br>

 If ever you remember to have viewed,<br>

 Not so Sir Richardet and Aldigier,<br>
 Varied the dance between those squadrons twain;<br>
 For, heedless of the Moors, each cavalier<br>
 Had but an eye to false Maganza’s train.<br>
 The brother of Rinaldo, Charles’s peer,<br>
 Much courage added to much might and main;<br>
 And these were now redoubled by the spite,<br>
 Which against false Maganza warmed the knight.</td></tr>

 This cause made him who in his fury shared,<br>
 Good Buovo’s bastard, seems a lion fell;<br>
 He, without pause, each trusty helmet pared<br>
 With his good blade, or crushed it like the shell<br>
 Of brittle egg: and who would not have dared—<br>
 Would not have shown a Hector’s worth as well,<br>
 Having two such companions in the stower,<br>
 Of warlike wights the very choice and flower?</td></tr>

 Marphisa, waging all the while the fight,<br>
 On her companions often turned to gaze,<br>
 And as she marked their rivalry in might,<br>
 Admiring, upon all bestowed her praise;<br>
 But when she on Rogero fixed her sight,<br>
 Deemed him unparalleled; and in amaze,<br>
 At times believed that Paladin was Mars,<br>
 Who left his heaven to mix in mortal wars.</td></tr>

 Like paper, not like stubborn plate and shell.<br>

 Half dropt on this, and half on the other side.</td></tr>

 With the same downright stroke, he overbore<br>
 The horse and rider, bleeding in the dust;<br>
 The heads of others from their shoulders bore,<br>
 And parted from the hips the bleeding bust.<br>
 He often at a blow cleft five and more;<br>
 And—but I doubt who hears me might distrust<br>
 What of a seeming falsehood bears the impress—<br>
 I would say more; but I parforce say less.</td></tr>

 Good Turpin, he who knows that he tells true,<br>
 And leaves men to believe what they think right,<br>
 Says of Rogero wondrous things, which you<br>
 Hearing related, would as falsehoods slight.<br>
 Thus, with Marphisa matched, that hostile crew<br>
 Appears like ice, and she like burning light.<br>
 Nor her Rogero with less marvel eyes,<br>
 That she had marked his valour with surprise.</td></tr>

 The pair ensued, by whom with cruel blade<br>
 Most deadly signs of prowess should be shown,<br>
 Mid that vile herd, on sinew, flesh and bone.</td></tr>

 To rout each hostile squadron, filled with dread,<br>
 Sufficed the soul and valour of the four;<br>

 By trot or amble they set little store;<br>

 How wretched is the poor foot-soldier’s trade.</td></tr>

 The conqueror’s prize remained both field and prey;<br>
 Nor was there footman left nor muleteer;<br>
 The Moor took this, Maganza took that way;<br>
 One leaves the prisoners, and one leaves the gear.<br>

 The four united each captive cavalier;<br>
 Nor were less diligent to free from chains<br>
 The prisoned pages, and unload the wains.</td></tr>

 But Richardetto drives, and Vivian,<br>
 Between the Child and paynim in that course.<br>
 This warrior at the king of Argier ran,<br>
 And from Rogero severed him by force;<br>
 That (it was Vivian) in Rogero’s hand,<br>
 Now from the blow recovered, placed his brand.</td></tr>

 As soon as to himself the Child returns,<br>
 And is by Vivian armed with sword again,<br>
 To venge the injury that stripling burns,<br>
 And runs at Rodomont with flowing rein,<br>
 Like lion, whom a bull upon his horns<br>
 Has lifted, though he feels this while no pain,<br>
 So him his heat of blood, disdain, and ire,<br>
 To venge that cruel outrage goad and fire.</td></tr>

 Rogero storms upon the paynim’s crest;<br>
 And, could that knight recover his own brand,<br>
 Which by foul felony (as erst exprest)<br>
 Was ravished from the youthful warrior’s hand,<br>
 I well believe that the descending pest<br>
 Rodomont’s iron casque will ill withstand;<br>
 That casque which Babel’s king bade forge, who sought<br>
 To war on Heaven in his presumptuous thought.</td></tr>

 Discord, believing nothing could ensue<br>
 But stir, and strife, and combat on that head;<br>

 Might now again with her securely tread.<br>
 Let them depart; and mark we where in front<br>
 Rogero has sore wounded Rodomont.</td></tr>

 Rogero’s blow was levelled with such spite,<br>
 That this upon Frontino’s crupper made<br>
 The helmet and the shell of iron smite,<br>
 In which that Saracen his limbs arrayed;<br>
 And he, three times or four, to left and right,<br>
 —As if about to fall—head-foremost, swayed;<br>
 And would have lost withal his trusty brand,<br>
 But that the hilt was fastened to his hand.</td></tr>

 Marphisa needed young Rogero’s aid.</td></tr>

 Marphisa’s martial steed, in turning short,<br>
 Where a firm footing that soft mead denied,<br>
 On the moist surface slipt, and in such sort,<br>
 That he fell, helpless, on his better side;<br>
 And, as he rose in haste and lacked support,<br>
 Athwart by furious Brigliador was plied;<br>
 On which the paynim, little courteous, came;<br>
 So that he fell anew beneath the dame.</td></tr>

 He saw unhorsed, deferred no more his aid;<br>
 Who for that deed had leisure; since, astound,<br>

 And, cleft like stalk, his head on earth had laid,<br>
 Had he his trusty Balisarda born,<br>
 Or Mandricardo other helmet worn.</td></tr>

 With other magic and with mickle art.</td></tr>

 Except in due obedience to the rein,<br>
 Now took a leap, possest by that ill sprite,<br>
 Thirty feet long and sixteen feet in height.</td></tr>

 It was a mighty leap, yet not so wide<br>
 As to make any rider void the sell.<br>
 Seeing herself so high in air, loud cried,<br>
 (Yielding herself for dead) that bonnibel.<br>
 Her palfrey, with the Daemon for his guide,<br>
 After his leap, runs, goaded by the spell<br>
 (The maid still screaming) such a furious course,<br>
 An arrow had not reached the flying horse.</td></tr>

 Pursued King Rodomont and Doralice.</td></tr>

 For at too great a distance was the foe.<br>
 Rogero, who beheld the war deferred,<br>
 Rather like lion roared than sighed: well know<br>
 Those two their coursers they should vainly gore,<br>
 Following Frontino and good Brigliador.</td></tr>

 Ere Charlemagne bring all beneath his sway.<br>

 Where these, they deem, will be their certain prey.<br>

 In good or evil fortune, everywhere.<br>

 No doubt in him, nor any of the rest.</td></tr>

 And so Sir Richardet as well: but low<br>
 On earth lies Aldigier, and there must rest.<br>
 The two first champions towards Paris go,<br>
 And the two others next pursue that quest.<br>

 Of wondrous and of superhuman gest,<br>
 Wrought to the damage of the Christian king,<br>
 By those two couples of whose worth I sing.</td></tr>
