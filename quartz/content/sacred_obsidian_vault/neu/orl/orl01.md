 On foot the Spaniard left not Aymon’s son;<br>

 Their courser brings to where the way divides.</td></tr>

 Knew not by which she might her palfrey goad,<br>

 The recent print of hoofs on either road),<br>

 Sunk in the stream; and since he could not think<br>
 Her to retrieve, who late his hopes had crossed.<br>
 He, where the treasure fell, descends the brink<br>
 Of that swift stream, and seeks the morion lost.<br>
 But the casque lies so bedded in the sands,<br>

 So lingered, where the troubled waters roll,<br>
 Breast-high, from the mid river rose upright,<br>
 The apparition of an angry knight.</td></tr>

 Armed at all points he was, except his head,<br>
 And in his better hand a helmet bore:<br>
 The very casque, which in the river’s bed<br>
 Ferrau sought vainly, toiling long and sore.<br>
 Upon the Spanish knight he frowned, and said:<br>
 “Thou traitor to thy word, thou perjured Moor,<br>
 Why grieve the goodly helmet to resign,<br>
 Which, due to me long since, is justly mine?</td></tr>

 After my other arms his helmet bright.<br>
 If Fortune now compel thee to forego<br>
 The prize, and do my will in thy despite,<br>
 Grieve not at this, but rather grieve that thou<br>
 Art found a perjured traitor to thy vow.</td></tr>

 To win and wear it more to thy renown.<br>

 Rinaldo’s such, or yet a fairer crown;<br>
 Almontes’, or Mambrino’s iron masque:<br>
 Make one of these, by force of arms, thine own.<br>

 Where (such thy promise) it has long been owed.”</td></tr>

 Of that grim shade, uprising from the tide,<br>
 And vanished was his fresh and healthful hue,<br>
 While on his lips the half-formed accents died.<br>

 Nor having time his falsehood to excuse,<br>
 And knowing well how true the phantom’s lore,<br>
 Stood speechless; such remorse the words infuse.<br>

 Never in fight, or foray would he use<br>
 Helmet but that which good Orlando bore<br>
 From Aspramont, where bold Almontes paid<br>
 His life a forfeit to the Christian blade.</td></tr>

 Bounding across the path, his gallant steed,<br>
 And, “Stay, Bayardo mine,” Rinaldo cried,<br>
 “Too cruel care the loss of thee does breed.”<br>

 Deaf to his prayer, but flew with better speed.<br>
 Furious, in chase of him, Rinaldo hies.<br>

 One day and night, and half the following day,<br>

 Then enters a deep wood, whose branches play,<br>
 Moved lightly by the freshening breeze which blows.<br>
 Through this two clear and murmuring rivers stray:<br>
 Upon their banks a fresher herbage grows;<br>
 While the twin streams their passage slowly clear,<br>
 Make music with the stones, and please the ear.</td></tr>

 Weening removed the way by which she wends,<br>
 A thousand miles from loathed Rinaldo’s beat,<br>

 Wearied with that long flight and summer’s heat.<br>

 Roving the banks in search of lusty grass.</td></tr>

 Behold! at hand a thicket she surveys<br>
 Gay with the flowering thorn and vermeil rose:<br>
 The tuft reflected in the stream which strays<br>
 Beside it, overshadowing oaks enclose.<br>
 Hollow within, and safe from vulgar gaze,<br>
 It seemed a place constructed for repose;<br>
 With bows so interwoven, that the light<br>
 Pierced not the tangled screen, far less the sight.</td></tr>

 Within soft moss and herbage form a bed;<br>

 Ere, as she weened, a courser’s tramp she knew.<br>
 Softly she rises, and the river near,<br>
 Armed cap-à-piè, beholds a cavalier.</td></tr>

 And sits so motionless, so lost in care,<br>

 When a loud noise within the greenwood shade<br>
 Beside him, rang in his astounded ears,<br>
 And sore against his will the monarch stayed.<br>
 He donned his helm (his other arms he wears),<br>
 Aye wont to rove in steel, with belted blade,<br>
 Replaced the bridle on his courser fleet,<br>
 Grappled his lance, and sprang into his seat.</td></tr>

 With the bold semblance of a valiant knight,<br>
 Behold a warrior threads the forest hoar.<br>
 The stranger’s mantle was of snowy white,<br>
 And white alike the waving plume he wore.<br>
 Balked of his bliss, and full of fell despite,<br>
 The monarch ill the interruption bore,<br>
 And spurred his horse to meet him in mid space,<br>
 With hate and fury glowing in his face.</td></tr>

 Him he defies to fight, approaching nigh,<br>
 And weens to make him stoop his haughty crest:<br>
 The other knight, whose worth I rate as high,<br>
 His warlike prowess puts to present test;<br>
 Cuts short his haughty threats and angry cry,<br>
 And spurs, and lays his levelled lance in rest.<br>
 In tempest wheels Circassia’s valiant peer,<br>
 And at his foeman’s head each aims his spear.</td></tr>

 Not brindled bulls or tawny lions spring<br>
 To forest warfare with such deadly will<br>
 As those two knights, the stranger and the king.<br>
 Their spears alike the opposing bucklers thrill:<br>
 The solid ground, at their encountering,<br>
 Trembles from fruitful vale to naked hill:<br>
 And well it was the mail in which they dressed<br>
 Their bodies was of proof, and saved the breast.</td></tr>

 Nor swerved the chargers from their destined course;<br>
 Who met like rams, and butted head to head.<br>
 The warlike Saracen’s ill-fated horse,<br>
 Well valued while alive, dropt short and dead:<br>
 The stranger’s, too, fell senseless; but perforce<br>
 Was roused by rowel from his grassy bed.<br>
 That of the paynim king, extended straight,<br>
 Lay on his battered lord with all his weight.</td></tr>

 But endlong by the readiest path is gone,<br>
 And measures, pricking frith and forest through,<br>
 A mile, or little less, in furious heat,<br>
 Ere the foiled Saracen regains his feet.</td></tr>

 There, where the deafening bolt had beat him down,<br>
 Nigh his death-stricken cattle, wakes aghast,<br>
 And sees the distant pine without its crown,<br>
 Which he saw clad in leafy honours last;<br>
 So rose the paynim knight with troubled face,<br>
 The maid spectatress of the cruel case.</td></tr>

 He sighs and groans, yet not for mischief sore<br>
 Endured in wounded arm or foot which bled;<br>
 But for mere shame, and never such before<br>
 Or after, dyed his cheek so deep a red,<br>
 And if he rued his fall, it grieved him more<br>
 His dame should lift him from his courser dead.<br>
 He speechless had remained, I ween, if she<br>
 Had not his prisoned tongue and voice set free.</td></tr>

 “Grieve not,” she said, “sir monarch, for thy fall;<br>
 But let the blame upon thy courser be!<br>
 To whom more welcome had been forage, stall,<br>
 And rest, than further joust and jeopardy;<br>
 And well thy foe the loser may I call,<br>

 Who is the first to quit his ground, if aught<br>
 Angelica of fighting fields be taught.”</td></tr>

 Had he seen warrior pass, by whom were borne<br>
 A shield and crest of white; in search of whom<br>
 Through the wide forest pricked the weary groom.</td></tr>

 King Sacripant made answer, “As you see,<br>

 Then tell the warrior’s name, that I may be<br>
 Informed whose valour foiled me in the fray.”<br>
 To him the groom,—“That which you ask of me<br>
 I shall relate to you without delay:<br>
 Know that you were in combat prostrate laid<br>
 By the tried valour of a gentle maid.</td></tr>

 Nor the redoubted virgin’s name I veil:<br>
 ’Twas Bradamant who marred what praise of old<br>
 Your prowess ever won with sword and mail.”<br>
 This said, he spurred again, his story told,<br>
 And left him little gladdened by the tale.<br>
 He recks not what he says or does, for shame,<br>
 And his flushed visage kindles into flame.</td></tr>

 Upon the croup bestowed that damsel sweet,<br>
 Reserved to gladder use in safer seat.</td></tr>

 Two miles they had not rode before they hear<br>
 The sweeping woods which spread about them, sound<br>
 With such loud crash and trample, far and near,<br>
 The forest seemed to tremble all around;<br>
 And shortly after see a steed appear,<br>
 With housings wrought in gold and richly bound;<br>
 Who clears the bush and stream, with furious force<br>
 And whatsoever else impedes his course.</td></tr>

 The bold Circassian lighted, and applied<br>
 His hand to seize him by the flowing rein,<br>
 Who, swiftly turning, with his heels replied,<br>
 For he like lightning wheeled upon the plain.<br>
 Woe to the king! but that he leaps aside,<br>
 For should he smite, he would not lash in vain.<br>
 Such are his bone and sinew, that the shock<br>
 Of his good heels had split a metal rock.</td></tr>

 With gentle blandishment and humble mood;<br>
 As the dog greets his lord with frolic glee,<br>
 Whom, some short season past, he had not viewed.<br>
 For good Bayardo had in memory<br>
 Albracca, where her hands prepared his food,<br>
 What time the damsel loved Rinaldo bold;<br>
 Rinaldo, then ungrateful, stern, and cold.</td></tr>

 With her left hand she takes him by the bit,<br>
 And with the other pats his sides and chest:<br>
 While the good steed (so marvellous his wit),<br>
 Lamb-like, obeyed the damsel and caressed.<br>
 Meantime the king, who sees the moment fit,<br>
 Leapt up, and with his knees the courser pressed.<br>
 While on the palfrey, eased of half his weight,<br>
 The lady left the croup, and gained the seat.</td></tr>

 Sounding in arms a man on foot espies,<br>
 And glows with sudden anger and despite;<br>

 Her more than life esteems the youthful knight,<br>
 While she from him, like crane from falcon, flies.<br>

 Whose wonderous waters different moods inspire.<br>
 Both spring in Arden, with rare virtue fraught:<br>
 This fills the heart with amorous desire:<br>

 Their love, and change for ice their former fire.<br>
 Rinaldo drank the first, and vainly sighs;<br>
 Angelica the last, and hates and flies.</td></tr>

 To Sacripant, and prayed him not to wait<br>
 The near approach of the detested knight,<br>
 But through the wood with her pursue his flight.</td></tr>

 Sufficient to make yonder champion flee?<br>
 Already are Albracca’s fights forgot,<br>
 And that dread night I singly stood for thee?<br>
 That night when I, though naked, was thy shield<br>
 Against King Agrican and all his field?”</td></tr>

 What ’tis she does; Rinaldo is too nigh:<br>
 And from afar that furious cavalier<br>
 Threats the bold Saracen with angry cry,<br>
 As soon as the known steed and damsel dear,<br>
 Whose charms such flame had kindled, meet his eye.<br>
 But what ensued between the haughty pair<br>
 I in another canto shall declare.</td></tr>
