 O feeble and unstable minds of men!<br>

 All thoughts we lightly change, but mostly when<br>
 These from some lover’s quarrel take their date.<br>

 Of Graecian wine two barrels had they drained;<br>

 From travellers seized a day or two before.</td></tr>

 Experience, which can make the foolish wise,<br>

 She washed, as said, and gladly did decline<br>
 Her neck to that unthinking pagan’s brand;<br>

 Of faith, so struck with cruel steel and hand,<br>

 This made three bounds, and thence in accents clear<br>

 So rare a way was taken by the dame.<br>

 Thy plighted faith, and chaste and holy name,<br>

 Thousands and thousands of long years and more!<br>

 His eyes from heaven did the Creator bend,<br>
 At the stupendous and unequalled feat,<br>

 So spake the Sire; and cleared the ambient air,<br>

 That second Breuse sans pity did remain;<br>

 Lamented sore his error, sad at soul.</td></tr>

 Within ten days, or shorter time, was placed<br>

 Its top, who, whensoever any knight<br>
 Approached the bridge, was wont his lord to warn,<br>
 Sounding a signal on his bugle-horn.</td></tr>

 Him from the adverse bank that king defied:<br>

 And, should one but a little swerve aside,<br>
 (Peril unparalleled!) the horse will go<br>
 Into the deep and dangerous stream below.</td></tr>

 The pagan had imagined, as a pain,<br>
 That, risking oft to tumble in the course,<br>
 Head-first into that stream, where he must drain<br>
 Huge draughts of water in his fall, parforce,<br>

 Water, as well as wine, could wash away.</td></tr>

 For, from the time that rage possest his sprite,<br>
 He had gone naked forth in sun and shade.<br>
 Had he been born on hot Syene’s site,<br>
 Or sands where worship is to Ammon paid,<br>
 Or nigh those hills, whence Nile’s full waters spin,<br>
 Orlando had not borne a dingier skin.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LX.</td><td>
 Nigh buried in their sockets are his eyes,<br>
 Spare in his visage, and as dry as bone:<br>
 Dishevelled is his hair in woeful wise,<br>
 With frightful beard his cheek is overgrown:<br>
 No sooner is he seen, than backward flies<br>
 Angelica, who, trembling sore, is flown:<br>
 She shrieking loud, all trembling and dismaid,<br>
 Betakes her to her youthful guide for aid.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXI.</td><td>
 When crazed Orlando was of her aware,<br>
 To seize the damsel he upsprang in haste;<br>
 So pleased the wretched count her visage fair,<br>
 So quickly was his mood inflamed: effaced<br>
 In him all ancient recollections are,<br>
 How she by him was whilom served and graced.<br>
 Behind her speech the count and hunts that dame,<br>
 As questing dog pursues the sylvan game.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXII.</td><td>
 The youth, that sees him chase his love who fled,<br>
 His courser spurs, and in pursuit is gone.<br>
 With naked faulchion after him he sped,<br>
 And cut and thrust at Roland as he run.<br>
 He from his shoulders hoped to cleave his head,<br>
 But found the madman’s skin as hard as bone;<br>
 Yea, harder far than steel, nor to be harmed;<br>
 So good Orlando at his birth was charmed.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXIII.</td><td>
 When on his back Orlando felt him beat,<br>
 He turned, and turning on his youthful foe,<br>
 Smote with clenched fist, and force which nought can meet,<br>
 —Smote on his horse’s head, a fearful blow;<br>
 And, with skull smashed like glass, that courser fleet<br>
 Was by the madman’s furious stroke laid low.<br>
 In the same breath Orlando turned anew,<br>
 And chased the damsel that before him flew.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXIV.</td><td>
 At speed Angelica impelled her mare.<br>
 And whipt and spurred her evermore; whom slow<br>
 She would esteem, albeit that palfrey were<br>
 Yet faster than a shaft dismist from bow:<br>
 Her ring she thought upon, and this the fair<br>
 Placed in her mouth; nor failed its virtue now;<br>
 For putting it between her lips, like light<br>
 Extinguished by a puff, she past from sight.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXV.</td><td>
 Was it through fear, or was she, while she stript<br>
 This from her finger, shaken in her seat;<br>
 Or was it rather, that her palfrey tript,<br>
 (For neither this nor that I surely weet)<br>
 Angelica, while ’twixt her lips she slipt<br>
 The virtuous ring, and hid her visage sweet,<br>
 Her stirrups lost; and, tumbling form the sell,<br>
 Reversed upon the sand that lady fell.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXVI.</td><td>
 If but two inches short had fallen his prey,<br>
 Upon her would have pounced Orlando near;<br>
 Who would have crushed her in his furious way,<br>
 But that kind Fortune saved her from the peer.<br>
 Let her by other theft herself purvey<br>
 With other palfrey, as she did whilere;<br>
 For never will she have this courser more,<br>
 Who chased by swift Orlando scours the shore.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXVII.</td><td>
 Doubt not that she another will provide;<br>
 And follow we in mad Orlando’s rear;<br>
 Whose rage and fury nevermore subside,<br>
 Wroth that Angelica should disappear:<br>
 After that beast along the sands he hied,<br>
 Aye gaining on the mare in this career.<br>
 Now, now he touches her, and lo! The mane<br>
 He grasps, and now secures her by the rein.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXVIII.</td><td>
 Orlando seizes her with that delight<br>
 That other man might seize a damsel fair;<br>
 The bit and bridle he adjusts aright,<br>
 Springs on her back, and o’er the sea-beach bare<br>
 For many miles impels the palfrey’s flight,<br>
 Without repose or pause, now here, now there:<br>
 Nor ever sell or bridle be displaced,<br>
 Nor let her grass or heartening forage taste.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXIX.</td><td>
 As in this course to o’erleap a ditch he sought,<br>
 Head over heels, she with her rider went:<br>
 Nor harmed was he, nor felt that tumble aright;<br>
 But she, with shoulder slipt, lay foully shent.<br>
 Long how to bear her thence Orlando thought,<br>
 And in the end upon his shoulders hent.<br>
 He from the bottom climbed, thus loaded sore,<br>
 And carried her three bow-shots’ length and more.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXX.</td><td>
 Next, for he felt that weight too irksome grow,<br>
 He put her down, to lead her by the rein;<br>
 Who followed him with limping gait and slow,<br>
 “Come on,” Orlando cried, and cried in vain;<br>
 And, could the palfrey at a gallop go,<br>
 This ill would satisfy his mood insane.<br>
 The halter from her head he last unloosed,<br>
 Wherewith her hind off-foot the madman noosed.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXXI.</td><td>
 ’Tis thus he comforts and drags on that mare,<br>
 That she may follow with more ease, so led;<br>
 Who whiles despoiled of flesh, and whiles of hair,<br>
 Is scathed by stones which that ill road o’erspread.<br>
 At length the misused beast, with wear and tear<br>
 Of the rude rocks, and suffering sore, lies dead.<br>
 Orlando nought the slaughtered mare regards,<br>
 Nor anywise his headlong course retards.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXXII.</td><td>
 To drag that palfrey ceased he not, though dead,<br>
 Continuing still his course towards the west,<br>
 And all this while sacked hamlet, farm, and stead,<br>
 Whenever he by hunger was distrest;<br>
 And aye to glut himself with meat, and bread,<br>
 And fruit, he every one by force opprest.<br>
 One by his hand was slain, one foully shent;<br>
 Seldom he stopt, and ever onward went.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXXIII.</td><td>
 As much, or little less, would do the knight<br>
 By his own love, did not that damsel hide;<br>
 Because the wretch discerns not black from white,<br>
 And harms where he would help. A curse betide<br>
 The wonder-working ring, and eke the wight<br>
 Who gave it to that lady, full or pride!<br>
 Since Roland, but for this, would venge the scorn<br>
 He and a thousand more from her had borne.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXXIV.</td><td>
 Would that of her Orlando were possest,<br>
 And of all women that are above ground!<br>
 For one and all are ingrates at the best,<br>
 Nor is in all an ounce of goodness found.<br>
 But it is meet I let my hearer rest<br>
 Ere my strained chords return a faltering sound,<br>
 And that he may less tedious deem the rhyme,<br>
 Defer my story till another time.</td></tr>
