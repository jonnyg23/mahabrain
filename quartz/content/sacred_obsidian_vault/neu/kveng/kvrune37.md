 <p>ILMARINEN, metal-worker,<br> Wept one day, and then a second,<br> Wept the third from morn till evening,<br> O'er the death of his companion,<br> Once the Maiden of the Rainbow;<br> Did not swing his heavy hammer,<br> Did not touch its copper handle,<br> Made no sound within his smithy,<br> Made no blow upon his anvil,<br> Till three months had circled over;<br> Then the blacksmith spake as follows:<br> "Woe is me, unhappy hero!<br> Do not know how I can prosper;<br> Long the days, and cold, and dreary,<br> Longer still the nights, and colder;<br> I am weary in the evening,<br> In the morning still am weary,<br> Have no longing for the morning,<br> And the evening is unwelcome;<br> Have no pleasure in the future,<br> All my pleasures gone forever,<br> With my faithful life-companion<br> Slaughtered by the hand of witchcraft!<br> Often will my heart-strings quiver<br> When I rest within my chamber,<br> When I wake at dreamy midnight,<br> Half-unconscious, vainly searching<br> For my noble wife departed."</p> 
 <p>Wifeless lived the mourning blacksmith,<br> Altered in his form and features;<br> Wept one month and then another,<br> Wept three months in full succession.<br> Then the magic metal-worker<br> Gathered gold from deeps of ocean,<br> Gathered silver from the mountains,<br> Gathered many heaps of birch-wood.<br> Filled with faggots thirty sledges,<br> Burned the birch-wood into ashes,<br> Put the ashes in the furnace,<br> Laid the gold upon the embers,<br> Lengthwise laid a piece of silver<br> Of the size of lambs in autumn,<br> Or the fleet-foot hare in winter;<br> Places servants at the bellows,<br> Thus to melt the magic metals.<br> Eagerly the servants labor,<br> Gloveless, hatless, do the workmen<br> Fan the flames within the furnace.</p> 
 <p>Ilmarinen, magic blacksmith,<br> Works unceasing at his forging,<br> Thus to mould a golden image,<br> Mould a bride from gold and silver;<br> But the workmen fail their master,<br> Faithless stand they at the bellows.<br> Wow the artist, Ilmarinen,<br> Fans the flame with force of magic,<br> Blows one day, and then a second,<br> Blows the third from morn till even;<br> Then he looks within the furnace,<br> Looks around the oven-border,<br> Hoping there to see an image<br> Rising from the molten metals.</p> 
 <p>Comes a lambkin from the furnace,<br> Rising from the fire of magic,<br> Wearing hair of gold and copper,<br> Laced with many threads of silver;<br> All rejoice but Ilmarinen<br> At the beauty of the image.<br> This the language of the blacksmith:<br> "May the wolf admire thy graces;<br> I desire a bride of beauty<br> Born from molten gold and silver!"</p> 
 <p>Ilmarinen, the magician,<br> To the furnace threw the lambkin;<br> Added gold in great abundance,<br> And increased the mass of silver,<br> Added other magic metals,<br> Set the workmen at the bellows;<br> Zealously the servants labor,<br> Gloveless, hatless, do the workmen<br> Fan the flames within the furnace.</p> 
 <p>Ilmarinen, wizard-forgeman,<br> Works unceasing with his metals,<br> Moulding well a golden image,<br> Wife of molten gold and silver;<br> But the workmen fail their master,<br> Faithless do they ply the bellows.</p> 
 <p>Now the artist, Ilmarinen,<br> Fans the flames by force of magic;<br> Blows one day, and then a second,<br> Blows a third from morn till evening,<br> When he looks within the furnace,<br> Looks around the oven-border,<br> Hoping there, to see an image<br> Rising from the molten metals.<br> From the flames a colt arises,<br> Golden-maned and silver-headed,<br> Hoofs are formed of shining copper.<br> All rejoice but Ilmarinen<br> At the wonderful creation;<br> This the language of the blacksmith;<br> "Let the bears admire thy graces;<br> I desire a bride of beauty<br> Born of many magic metals."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the wonder-forger<br> Drives the colt back to the furnace,<br> Adds a greater mass of silver,<br> And of gold the rightful measure,<br> Sets the workmen at the bellows.<br> Eagerly the servants labor,<br> Gloveless, hatless, do the workmen<br> Fan the flames within the furnace.</p> 
 <p>Ilmarinen, the magician,<br> Works unceasing at his witchcraft,<br> Moulding well a golden maiden,<br> Bride of molten gold and silver;<br> But the workmen fail their master,<br> Faithlessly they ply the bellows.</p> 
 <p>Now the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Fans the flames with magic powers,<br> Blows one day, and then a second,<br> Blows a third from morn till even;<br> Then he looks within his furnace,<br> Looks around the oven-border,<br> Trusting there to see a maiden<br> Coming from the molten metals.<br> From the fire a virgin rises,<br> Golden-haired and silver-headed,<br> Beautiful in form and feature.<br> All are filled with awe and wonder,<br> But the artist and magician.<br> Ilmarinen, metal-worker,<br> Forges nights and days unceasing,<br> On the bride of his creation;<br> Feet he forges for the maiden,<br> Hands and arms, of gold and silver;<br> But her feet are not for walking,<br> Neither can her arms embrace him.<br> Ears he forges for the virgin,<br> But her ears are not for hearing;<br> Forges her a mouth of beauty,<br> Eyes he forges bright and sparkling;<br> But the magic mouth is speechless,<br> And the eyes are not for seeing.<br> Spake the artist, Ilmarinen:<br> "This, indeed, a priceless maiden,<br> Could she only speak in wisdom,<br> Could she breathe the breath of Ukko!"</p> 
 <p>Thereupon he lays the virgin<br> On his silken couch of slumber,<br> On his downy place of resting.<br> Ilmarinen heats his bath-room,<br> Makes it ready for his service,<br> Binds together silken brushes,<br> Brings three cans of crystal water,<br> Wherewithal to lave the image,<br> Lave the golden maid of beauty.<br> When this task had been completed,<br> Ilmarinen, hoping, trusting,<br> Laid his golden bride to slumber,<br> On his downy couch of resting;<br> Ordered many silken wrappings,<br> Ordered bear-skins, three in number,<br> Ordered seven lambs-wool blankets,<br> Thus to keep him warm in slumber,<br> Sleeping by the golden image<br> Re had forged from magic metals.<br> Warm the side of Ilmarinen<br> That was wrapped in furs and blankets;<br> Chill the parts beside the maiden,<br> By his bride of gold and silver;<br> One side warm, the other lifeless,<br> Turning into ice from coldness.<br> Spake the artist, Ilmarinen:<br> "Not for me was born this virgin<br> From the magic molten metals;<br> I shall take her to Wainola,<br> Give her to old Wainamoinen,<br> As a bride and life-companion,<br> Comfort to him in his dotage."</p> 
 <p>Ilmarinen, much disheartened,<br> Takes the virgin to Wainola,<br> To the plains of Kalevala,<br> To his brother speaks as follows:<br> "O, thou ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Look with favor on this image;<br> Make the maiden fair and lovely,<br> Beautiful in form and feature,<br> Suited to thy years declining!"</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br> Looked in wonder on the virgin,<br> On the golden bride of beauty,<br> Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<br> "Wherefore dost thou bring this maiden,<br> Wherefore bring to Wainamoinen<br> Bride of molten gold and silver?<br> Spake in answer Ilmarinen:<br> "Wherefore should I bring this image,<br> But for purposes the noblest?<br> I have brought her as companion<br> To thy life in years declining,<br> As a joy and consolation,<br> When thy days are full of trouble!"<br> Spake the good, old Wainamoinen:<br> "Magic brother, wonder-forger,<br> Throw the virgin to the furnace,<br> To the flames, thy golden image,<br> Forge from her a thousand trinkets.<br> Take the image into Ehstland,<br> Take her to the plains of Pohya,<br> That for her the mighty powers<br> May engage in deadly contest,<br> Worthy trophy for the victor;<br> Not for me this bride of wonder,<br> Neither for my worthy people.<br> I shall never wed an image<br> Born from many magic metals,<br> Never wed a silver maiden,<br> Never wed a golden virgin."<br> Then the hero of the waters<br> Called together all his people,<br> Spake these words of ancient wisdom:<br> "Every child of Northland, listen,<br> Whether poor, or fortune-favored:<br> Never bow before an image<br> Born of molten gold and silver:<br> Never while the sunlight brightens,<br> Never while the moonlight glimmers,<br> Choose a maiden of the metals,<br> Choose a bride from gold created<br> Cold the lips of golden maiden,<br> Silver breathes the breath of sorrow."</p>
