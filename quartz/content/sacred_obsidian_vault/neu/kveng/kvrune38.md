 <p>ILMARINEN, the magician,<br> The eternal metal-artist,<br> Lays aside the golden image,<br> Beauteous maid of magic metals;<br> Throws the harness on his courser,<br> Binds him to his sledge of birch-wood,<br> Seats himself upon the cross-bench,<br> Snaps the whip above the racer,<br> Thinking once again to journey<br> To the mansions of Pohyola,<br> There to woo a bride in honor,<br> Second daughter of the Northland.</p> 
 <p>On he journeyed, restless, northward,<br> Journeyed one day, then a second,<br> So the third from morn till evening,<br> When he reached a Northland-village<br> On the plains of Sariola.</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Standing in the open court-yard,<br> Spied the hero, Ilmarinen,<br> Thus addressed the metal-worker:<br> "Tell me how my child is living,<br> How the Bride of Beauty prospers,<br> As a daughter to thy mother."</p> 
 <p>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Head bent down and brow dejected,<br> Thus addressed the Northland hostess:<br> "O, thou dame of Sariola,<br> Do not ask me of thy daughter,<br> Since, alas I in Tuonela<br> Sleeps the Maiden of the Rainbow,<br> Sleeps in death the Bride, of Beauty,<br> Underneath the fragrant heather,<br> In the kingdom of Manala.<br> Come I for a second daughter,<br> For the fairest of thy virgins.<br> Beauteous hostess of Pohyola,<br> Give to me thy youngest maiden,<br> For my former wife's compartments,<br> For the chambers of her sister."</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<br> Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<br> "Foolish was the Northland-hostess,<br> When she gave her fairest virgin,<br> In the bloom of youth and beauty<br> To the blacksmith of Wainola,<br> Only to be led to Mana,<br> Like a lambkin to the slaughter!<br> I shall never give my daughter,<br> Shall not give my youngest maiden<br> Bride of thine to be hereafter,<br> Life-companion at thy fireside.<br> Sooner would I give the fair one<br> To the cataract and whirlpool,<br> To the river of Manala,<br> To the waters of Tuoni!"</p> 
 <p>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Drew away his head, disdainful,<br> Shook his sable locks in anger,<br> Entered to the inner court-room,<br> Where the maiden sat in waiting,<br> Spake these measures to the daughter:<br> "Come with me, thou bright-eyed maiden,<br> To the cottage where thy sister<br> Lived and lingered in contentment,<br> Baked for me the toothsome biscuit,<br> Brewed for me the beer of barley,<br> Kept my dwelling-place in order."</p> 
 <p>On the floor a babe was lying,<br> Thus he sang to Ilmarinen:<br> "Uninvited, leave this mansion,<br> Go, thou stranger, from this dwelling;<br> Once before thou camest hither,<br> Only bringing pain and trouble,<br> Filling all our hearts with sorrow.<br> Fairest daughter of my mother,<br> Do not give this suitor welcome,<br> Look not on his eyes with pleasure,<br> Nor admire his form and features.<br> In his mouth are only wolf-teeth,<br> Cunning fox-claws in his mittens,<br> In his shoes art only bear-claws,<br> In his belt a hungry dagger;<br> Weapons these of blood and murder,<br> Only worn by the unworthy."</p> 
 <p>Then the daughter spake as follows<br> To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:<br> "Follow thee this maid will never,<br> Never heed unworthy suitors;<br> Thou hast slain the Bride of Beauty,<br> Once the Maiden of the Rainbow,<br> Thou wouldst also slay her sister.<br> I deserve a better suitor,<br> Wish a truer, nobler husband,<br> Wish to ride in richer sledges,<br> Have a better home-protection;<br> Never will I sweep the cottage<br> And the coal-place of a blacksmith."</p> 
 <p>Then the hero, Ilmarinen,<br> The eternal metal-artist,<br> Turned his head away, disdainful,<br> Shook his sable locks in anger,<br> Quickly seized the trembling maiden,<br> Held her in his grasp of iron,<br> Hastened from the court of Louhi<br> To his sledge upon the highway.<br> In his sleigh he seats the virgin,<br> Snugly wraps her in his far-robes,<br> Snaps his whip above the racer,<br> Gallops on the high-road homeward;<br> With one hand the reins be tightens,<br> With the other holds the maiden.<br> Speaks the virgin-daughter, weeping:<br> We have reached the lowland-berries,<br> Here the herbs of water-borders;<br> Leave me here to sink and perish<br> As a child of cold misfortune.<br> Wicked Ilmarinen, Iisten!<br> If thou dost not quickly free me,<br> I will break thy sledge to pieces,<br> Throw thy fur-robes to the north-winds."<br> Ilmarinen makes this answer:<br> "When the blacksmith builds his snow-sledge,<br> All the parts are hooped with iron;<br> Therefore will the beauteous maiden<br> Never beat my sledge to fragments."</p> 
 <p>Then the silver-tinselled daughter<br> Wept and wailed in bitter accents,<br> Wrung her hands in desperation,<br> Spake again to Ilmarinen:<br> "If thou dost not quickly free me,<br> I shall change to ocean-salmon,<br> Be a whiting of the waters."</p> 
 <p>"Thou wilt never thus escape me,<br> As a pike I'll fleetly follow."</p> 
 <p>Then the maiden of Pohyola<br> Wept and wailed in bitter accents,<br> Wrung her hands in desperation,<br> Spake again to Ilmarinen;<br> "If thou dost not quickly free me,<br> I shall hasten to the forest,<br> Mid the rocks become an ermine!"</p> 
 <p>"Thou wilt never thus escape me,<br> As a serpent I will follow."</p> 
 <p>Then the beauty of the Northland,<br> Wailed and wept in bitter accents,<br> Wrung her hands in desperation,<br> Spake once more to Ilmarinen:<br> "Surely, if thou dost not free me,<br> As a lark I'll fly the ether,<br> Hide myself within the storm-clouds."</p> 
 <p>"Neither wilt thou thus escape me,<br> As an eagle I will follow."</p> 
 <p>They had gone but little distance,<br> When the courser shied and halted,<br> Frighted at some passing object;<br> And the maiden looked in wonder,<br> In the snow beheld some foot-prints,<br> Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<br> Who has run across our highway?"<br> "'Tis the timid hare", he answered.<br> Thereupon the stolen maiden<br> Sobbed, and moaned, in deeps of sorrow,<br> Heavy-hearted, spake these measures:<br> "Woe is me, ill-fated virgin!<br> Happier far my life hereafter,<br> If the hare I could but follow<br> To his burrow in the woodlands!<br> Crook-leg's fur to me is finer<br> Than the robes of Ilmarinen."</p> 
 <p>Ilmarinen, the magician,<br> Tossed his head in full resentment,<br> Galloped on the highway homeward,<br> Travelled but a little distance,<br> When again his courser halted,<br> Frighted at some passing stranger.<br> Quick the maiden looked and wondered,<br> In the snow beheld some foot-prints,<br> Spake these measures to the blacksmith:<br> Who has crossed our snowy pathway?"</p> 
 <p>"'Tis a fox", replied the minstrel.<br> Thereupon the beauteous virgin<br> Moaned again in depths of anguish,<br> Sang these accents, heavy-hearted:<br> "Woe is me, ill-fated maiden!<br> Happier far my life hereafter,<br> With the cunning fox to wander,<br> Than with this ill-mannered suitor;<br> Reynard's fur to me is finer<br> Than the robes of Ilmarinen."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the metal-worker<br> Shut his lips in sore displeasure,<br> Hastened on the highway homeward;<br> Travelled but a little distance,<br> When again his courser halted.</p> 
 <p>Quick the maiden looked in wonder,<br> in the snow beheld some foot-prints,<br> Spake these words to the magician:<br> Who again has crossed our pathway?"</p> 
 <p>"'Tis the wolf", said Ilmarinen.<br> Thereupon the fated daughter<br> Fell again to bitter weeping,<br> And Intoned these words of sorrow:<br> "Woe is me, a hapless maiden!<br> Happier far my life hereafter,<br> Brighter far would be my future,<br> If these tracks I could but follow;<br> On the wolf the hair is finer<br> Than the furs of Ilmarinen,<br> Faithless suitor of the Northland."</p> 
 <p>Then the minstrel of Wainola<br> Closed his lips again in anger,<br> Shook his sable locks, resentful,<br> Snapped the whip above the racer,<br> And the steed flew onward swiftly,<br> O'er the way to Kalevala,<br> To the village of the blacksmith.</p> 
 <p>Sad and weary from his journey,<br> Ilmarinen, home-returning,<br> Fell upon his couch in slumber,<br> And the maiden laughed derision.</p> 
 <p>In the morning, slowly waking,<br> Head confused, and locks dishevelled,<br> Spake the wizard, words as follow:<br> "Shall I set myself to singing<br> Magic songs and incantations?<br> Shall I now enchant this maiden<br> To a black-wolf on the mountains,<br> To a salmon of the ocean?<br> Shall not send her to the woodlands,<br> All the forest would be frighted;<br> Shall not send her to the waters,<br> All the fish would flee in terror;<br> This my sword shall drink her life-blood,<br> End her reign of scorn and hatred."</p> 
 <p>Quick the sword feels his intention,<br> Quick divines his evil purpose,<br> Speaks these words to Ilmarinen:<br> "Was not born to drink the life-blood<br> Of a maiden pure and lovely,<br> Of a fair but helpless virgin."<br> Thereupon the magic minstrel,<br> Filled with rage, began his singing;<br> Sang the very rocks asunder,<br> Till the distant hills re-echoed;<br> Sang the maiden to a sea-gull,<br> Croaking from the ocean-ledges,<br> Calling from the ocean-islands,<br> Screeching on the sandy sea-coast,<br> Flying to the winds opposing.<br> When his conjuring had ended,<br> Ilmarinen joined his snow-sledge,<br> Whipped his steed upon a gallop,<br> Hastened to his ancient smithy,<br> To his home in Kalevala.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br> Comes to meet him on the highway,<br> Speaks these words to the magician:<br> "Ilmarinen, worthy brother,<br> Wherefore comest heavy-hearted<br> From the dismal Sariola?<br> Does Pohyola live and prosper?<br> Spake the minstrel, Ilmarinen:<br> "Why should not Pohyola prosper?<br> There the Sampo grinds unceasing,<br> Noisy rocks the lid in colors;<br> Grinds one day the flour for eating,<br> Grinds the second flour for selling,<br> Grinds the third day flour for keeping;<br> Thus it is Pohyola prospers.<br> While the Sampo is in Northland,<br> There is plowing, there is sowing,<br> There is growth of every virtue,<br> There is welfare never-ending."<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Ilmarinen, artist-brother,<br> Where then is the Northland-daughter,<br> Far renowned and beauteous maiden,<br> For whose hand thou hast been absent?<br> These the words of Ilmarinen:<br> "I have changed the hateful virgin<br> To a sea-gull on the ocean;<br> Now she calls above the waters,<br> Screeches from the ocean-islands;<br> On the rocks she calls and murmurs<br> Vainly calling for a suitor."</p>
