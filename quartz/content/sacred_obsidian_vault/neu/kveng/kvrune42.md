 <p>WAINAMOINEN, old and truthful,<br> With the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> With the reckless son of Lempo,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<br> On the sea's smooth plain departed,<br> On the far-extending waters,<br> To the village, cold and dreary,<br> To the never-pleasant Northland,<br> Where the heroes fall and perish.<br> Ilmarinen led the rowers<br> On one side the magic war-ship,<br> And the reckless Lemminkainen<br> Led the rowers on the other.<br> Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<br> Laid his hand upon the rudder,<br> Steered his vessel o'er the waters,<br> Through the foam and angry billows<br> To Pohyola's place of landing,<br> To the cylinders of copper,<br> Where the war-ships lie at anchor.</p> 
 <p>When they had arrived at Pohya,<br> When their journey they had ended,<br> On the land they rolled their vessel,<br> On the copper-banded rollers,<br> Straightway journeyed to the village,<br> Hastened to the halls and hamlets<br> Of the dismal Sariola.</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<br> Thus addressed the stranger-heroes:<br> Magic heroes of Wainola,<br> What the tidings ye are bringing<br> To the people of my village?"</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel.<br> Gave this answer to the hostess:<br> "All the hosts of Kalevala<br> Are inquiring for the Sampo,<br> Asking for the lid in colors;<br> Hither have these heroes journeyed<br> To divide the priceless treasure.<br> Thus the hostess spake in answer:<br> "No one would divide a partridge,<br> Nor a squirrel, with three heroes;<br> Wonderful the magic Sampo,<br> Plenty does it bring to Northland;<br> And the colored lid re-echoes<br> From the copper-bearing mountains,<br> From the stone-berg of Pohyola,<br> To the joy of its possessors."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Thus addressed the ancient Louhi:<br> "If thou wilt not share the Sampo,<br> Give to us an equal portion,<br> We will take it to Wainola,<br> With its lid of many colors,<br> Take by force the hope of Pohya."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the Northland hostess<br> Angry grew and sighed for vengeance;<br> Called her people into council,<br> Called the hosts of Sariola,<br> Heroes with their trusted broadswords,<br> To destroy old Wainamoinen<br> With his people of the Northland.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,<br> Hastened to his harp of fish-bone,<br> And began his magic playing;<br> All of Pohya stopped and listened,<br> Every warrior was silenced<br> By the notes of the magician;<br> Peaceful-minded grew the soldiers,<br> All the maidens danced with pleasure,<br> While the heroes fell to weeping,<br> And the young men looked in wonder.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen plays unceasing,<br> Plays the maidens into slumber,<br> Plays to sleep the young and aged,<br> All of Northland sleeps and listens.<br> Wise and wondrous Wainamoinen,<br> The eternal bard and singer,<br> Searches in his pouch of leather,<br> Draws therefrom his slumber-arrows,<br> Locks the eyelids of the sleepers,<br> Of the heroes of Pohyola,<br> Sings and charms to deeper slumber<br> All the warriors of the Northland.<br> Then the heroes of Wainola<br> Hasten to obtain the Sampo,<br> To procure the lid in colors<br> From the copper-bearing mountains.<br> From behind nine locks of copper,<br> In the stone-berg of Pohyola.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Then began his wondrous singing,<br> Sang in gentle tones of magic,<br> At the entrance to the mountain,<br> At the border of the stronghold;<br> Trembled all the rocky portals,<br> And the iron-banded pillars<br> Fell and crumbled at his singing.</p> 
 <p>Ilmarinen, magic blacksmith,<br> Well anointed all the hinges,<br> All the bars and locks anointed,<br> And the bolts flew back by magic,<br> All the gates unlocked in silence,<br> Opened for the great magician.<br> Spake the minstrel Wainamoinen:<br> "O thou daring Lemminkainen,<br> Friend of mine in times of trouble,<br> Enter thou within the mountain,<br> Bring away the wondrous Sampo,<br> Bring away the lid in colors!"</p> 
 <p>Quick the reckless Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Ever ready for a venture,<br> Hastens to the mountain-caverns,<br> There to find the famous Sampo,<br> There to get the lid in colors;<br> Strides along with conscious footsteps,<br> Thus himself he vainly praises:<br> "Great am I and full of glory,<br> Wonder-hero, son of Ukko,<br> I will bring away the Sampo,<br> Turn about the lid in colors,<br> Turn it on its magic hinges!"</p> 
 <p>Lemminkainen finds the wonder,<br> Finds the Sampo in the mountain,<br> Labors long with strength heroic,<br> Tugs with might and main to turn it;<br> Motionless remains the treasure,<br> Deeper sinks the lid in colors,<br> For the roots have grown about it,<br> Grown nine fathoms deep in sand-earth.</p> 
 <p>Lived a mighty ox in Northland,<br> Powerful in bone and sinew,<br> Beautiful in form and color,<br> Horns the length of seven fathoms,<br> Mouth and eyes of wondrous beauty.</p> 
 <p>Lemminkainen, reckless hero,<br> Harnesses the ox in pasture,<br> Takes the master-plow of Pohya,<br> Plows the roots about the Sampo,<br> Plows around the lid in colors,<br> And the sacred Sampo loosens,<br> Falls the colored lid in silence.<br> Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<br> Brings the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Brings the daring Lemminkainen,<br> Lastly brings the magic Sampo,<br> From the stone-berg of Pohyola,<br> From the copper-bearing mountain,<br> Hides it in his waiting vessel,<br> In the war-ship of Wainola.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen called his people,<br> Called his crew of men and maidens,<br> Called together all his heroes,<br> Rolled his vessel to the water,<br> Into billowy deeps and dangers.<br> Spake the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:<br> "Whither shall we take the Sampo,<br> Whither take the lid in colors,<br> From the stone-berg of Pohyola,<br> From this evil spot of Northland?"</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, wise and faithful,<br> Gave this answer to the question:<br> "Thither shall we take the Sampo,<br> Thither take the lid in colors,<br> To the fog-point on the waters,<br> To the island forest-covered;<br> There the treasure may be hidden,<br> May remain in peace for ages,<br> Free from trouble, free from danger,<br> Where the sword will not molest it."</p> 
 <p>Then the minstrel, Wainamoinen,<br> Joyful, left the Pohya borders,<br> Homeward sailed, and happy-hearted,<br> Spake these measures on departing:<br> "Turn, O man-of-war, from Pohya,<br> Turn thy back upon the strangers,<br> Turn thou to my distant country!<br> Rock, O winds, my magic vessel,<br> Homeward drive my ship, O billows,<br> Lend the rowers your assistance,<br> Give the oarsmen easy labor,<br> On this vast expanse of waters!<br> Give me of thine oars, O Ahto,<br> Lend thine aid, O King of sea-waves,<br> Guide as with thy helm in safety,<br> Lay thy hand upon the rudder,<br> And direct our war-ship homeward;<br> Let the hooks of metal rattle<br> O'er the surging of the billows,<br> On the white-capped waves' commotion."</p> 
 <p>Then the master, Wainamoinen,<br> Guided home his willing vessel;<br> And the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> With the lively Lemminkainen,<br> Led the mighty host of rowers,<br> And the war-ship glided homeward<br> O'er the sea's unruffled surface,<br> O'er the mighty waste of waters.<br> Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "Once before I rode these billows,<br> There were viands for the heroes,<br> There was singing for the maidens;<br> But to-day I hear no singing,<br> Hear no songs upon the vessel,<br> Hear no music on the waters."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,<br> Answered thus wild Lemminkainen:<br> "Let none sing upon the blue-sea,<br> On the waters, no rejoicing;<br> Singing would prolong our journey,<br> Songs disturb the host of rowers;<br> Soon will die the silver sunlight,<br> Darkness soon will overtake us,<br> On this evil waste of waters,<br> On this blue-sea, smooth and level."<br> These the words of Lemminkainen:<br> "Time will fly on equal pinions<br> Whether we have songs or silence;<br> Soon will disappear the daylight,<br> And the night as quickly follow,<br> Whether we be sad or joyous."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, the magician,<br> O'er the blue backs of the billows,<br> Steered one day, and then a second,<br> Steered the third from morn till even,<br> When the wizard, Lemminkainen,<br> Once again addressed the master:<br> "Why wilt thou, O famous minstrel,<br> Sing no longer for thy people,<br> Since the Sampo thou hast captured,<br> Captured too the lid in colors?"<br> These the words of Wainamoinen:<br> "'Tis not well to sing too early!<br> Time enough for songs of joyance<br> When we see our home-land mansions,<br> When our journeyings have ended!"<br> Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "At the helm, if I were sitting,<br> I would sing at morn and evening,<br> Though my voice has little sweetness;<br> Since thy songs are not forthcoming<br> Listen to my wondrous singing!"</p> 
 <p>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Raised his voice above the waters,<br> O'er the sea his song resounded;<br> But his measures were discordant,<br> And his notes were harsh and frightful.<br> Sang the wizard, Lemminkainen,<br> Screeched the reckless Kaukomieli,<br> Till the mighty war-ship trembled;<br> Far and wide was heard his singing,<br> Heard his songs upon the waters,<br> Heard within the seventh village,<br> Heard beyond the seven oceans.</p> 
 <p>Sat a crane within the rushes,<br> On a hillock clothed in verdure,<br> And the crane his toes was counting;<br> Suddenly he heard the singing<br> Of the wizard, Lemminkainen;<br> And the bird was justly frightened<br> At the songs of the magician.<br> Then with horrid voice, and screeching,<br> Flew the crane across the broad-sea<br> To the lakes of Sariola,<br> O'er Pohyola's hills and hamlets,<br> Screeching, screaming, over Northland,<br> Till the people of the darkness<br> Were awakened from their slumbers.</p> 
 <p>Louhi hastens to her hurdles,<br> Hastens to her droves of cattle,<br> Hastens also to her garners,<br> Counts her herds, inspects her store-house;<br> Undisturbed she finds her treasures.</p> 
 <p>Quick she journeys to the entrance<br> To the copper-bearing mountain,<br> Speaks these words as she approaches:<br> "Woe is me, my life hard-fated,<br> Woe to Louhi, broken-hearted!<br> Here the tracks of the destroyers,<br> All my locks and bolts are broken<br> By the hands of cruel strangers!<br> Broken are my iron hinges,<br> Open stand the mountain-portals<br> Leading to the Northland-treasure.<br> Has Pohyola lost her Sampo?"</p> 
 <p>Then she hastened to the chambers<br> Where the Sampo had been grinding;<br> But she found the chambers empty,<br> Lid and Sampo gone to others,<br> From the stone-berg of Pohyola,<br> From behind nine locks of copper,<br> In the copper-bearing mountain.</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<br> Angry grew and cried for vengeance;<br> As she found her fame departing,<br> Found her-strength fast disappearing,<br> Thus addressed the sea-fog virgin:<br> "Daughter of the morning-vapors,<br> Sift thy fogs from distant cloud-land,<br> Sift the thick air from the heavens,<br> Sift thy vapors from the ether,<br> On the blue-back of the broad-sea,<br> On the far extending waters,<br> That the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Friend of ocean-wave and billow,<br> May not baffle his pursuers!</p> 
 <p>"Should this prayer prove unavailing,<br> Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,<br> Raise thy head above the billows,<br> And destroy Wainola's heroes,<br> Sink them to thy deep sea-castles,<br> There devour them at thy pleasure;<br> Bring thou back the golden Sampo<br> To the people of Pohyola!</p> 
 <p>"Should these words be ineffective,<br> Ukko, mightiest of rulers,<br> Golden king beyond the welkin,<br> Sitting on a throne of silver,<br> Fill thy skies with heavy storm-clouds,<br> Call thy fleetest winds about thee,<br> Send them o'er the seven broad-seas,<br> There to find the fleeing vessel,<br> That the ancient Wainamoinen<br> May not baffle his pursuers!"</p> 
 <p>Quick the virgin of the vapors<br> Breathed a fog upon the waters,<br> Made it settle on the war-ship<br> Of the, heroes of the Northland,<br> Held the minstrel, Wainamoinen,<br> Anchored in the fog and darkness;<br> Bound him one day, then a second,<br> Then a third till dawn of morning,<br> In the middle of the blue-sea,<br> Whence he could not flee in safety<br> From the wrath of his pursuers.</p> 
 <p>When the third night had departed,<br> Resting in the sea, and helpless,<br> Wainamoinen spake as follows,<br> "Not a man of strength and courage,<br> Not the weakest of the heroes,<br> Who upon the sea will suffer,<br> Sink and perish in the vapors,<br> Perish in the fog and darkness!"</p> 
 <p>With his sword he smote the billows,<br> From his magic blade flowed honey;<br> Quick the vapor breaks, and rises,<br> Leaves the waters clear for rowing;<br> Far extend the sky and waters,<br> Large the ring of the horizon,<br> And the troubled sea enlarges.</p> 
 <p>Time had journeyed little distance,<br> Scarce a moment had passed over,<br> When they heard a mighty roaring,<br> Heard a roaring and a rushing<br> Near the border of the vessel,<br> Where the foam was shooting skyward<br> O'er the boat of Wainamoinen.<br> Straightway youthful Ilmarinen<br> Sank in gravest apprehension,<br> From his cheeks the blood departed;<br> Pulled his cap down o'er his forehead,<br> Shook and trembled with emotion.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Casts his eyes upon the waters<br> Near the broad rim of his war-ship;<br> There perceives an ocean-wonder<br> With his head above the sea-foam.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, brave and mighty,<br> Seizes quick the water-monster,<br> Lifts him by his ears and questions:<br> "Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,<br> Why art rising from the blue-sea?<br> Wherefore dost thou leave thy castle,<br> Show thyself to mighty heroes,<br> To the heroes of Wainola?"</p> 
 <p>Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,<br> Ocean monster, manifested<br> Neither pleasure, nor displeasure,<br> Was not in the least affrighted,<br> Did not give the hero answer.</p> 
 <p>Whereupon the ancient minstrel,<br> Asked the second time the monster,<br> Urgently inquired a third time:<br> "Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,<br> Why art rising from the waters,<br> Wherefore dost thou leave the blue-sea?<br> Iku-Turso gave this answer:<br> For this cause I left my castle<br> Underneath the rolling billows:<br> Came I here with the intention<br> To destroy the Kalew-heroes,<br> And return the magic Sampo<br> To the people of Pohyola.<br> If thou wilt restore my freedom,<br> Spare my life, from pain and sorrow,<br> I will quick retrace my journey,<br> Nevermore to show my visage<br> To the people of Wainola,<br> Never while the moonlight glimmers<br> On the hills of Kalevala!"</p> 
 <p>Then the singer, Wainamoinen,<br> Freed the monster, Iku-Turso,<br> Sent him to his deep sea-castles,<br> Spake these words to him departing:<br> "Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,<br> Nevermore arise from ocean,<br> Nevermore let Northland-heroes<br> See thy face above the waters I<br> Nevermore has Iku-Turso<br> Risen to the ocean-level;<br> Never since have Northland sailors<br> Seen the head of this sea-monster.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br> Onward rowed his goodly vessel,<br> Journeyed but a little distance,<br> Scarce a moment had passed over,<br> When the King of all creators,<br> Mighty Ukko of the heavens,<br> Made the winds blow full of power,<br> Made the storms arise in fury,<br> Made them rage upon the waters.<br> From the west the winds came roaring,<br> From the north-east came in anger,<br> Winds came howling from the south-west,<br> Came the winds from all directions,<br> In their fury, rolling, roaring,<br> Tearing branches from the lindens,<br> Hurling needles from the pine-trees,<br> Blowing flowers from the heather,<br> Grasses blowing from the meadow,<br> Tearing up the very bottom<br> Of the deep and boundless blue-sea.<br> Roared the winds and lashed the waters<br> Till the waves were white with fury;<br> Tossed the war-ship high in ether,<br> Tossed away the harp of fish-bone,<br> Magic harp of Wainamoinen,<br> To the joy of King Wellamo,<br> To the pleasure of his people,<br> To the happiness of Ahto,<br> Ahto, rising from his caverns,<br> On the floods beheld his people<br> Carry off the harp of magic<br> To their home below the billows.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Heavy-hearted, spake these measures:<br> "I have lost what I created,<br> I have lost the harp of joyance;<br> Now my strength has gone to others,<br> All my pleasure too departed,<br> All my hope and comfort vanished!<br> Nevermore the harp of fish-bone<br> Will enchant the hosts of Suomi!"</p> 
 <p>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Sorrow-laden, spake as follows:<br> "Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<br> Would that I had never journeyed<br> On these waters filled with dangers,<br> On the rolling waste before me,<br> In this war-ship false and feeble.<br> Winds and storms have I encountered,<br> Wretched days of toil and trouble,<br> I have witnessed in the Northland;<br> Never have I met such dangers<br> On the land, nor on the ocean,<br> Never in my hero life-time!"</p> 
 <p>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Spake and these the words he uttered:<br> "Weep no more, my goodly comrades,<br> In my bark let no one murmur;<br> Weeping cannot mend disaster,<br> Tears can never still misfortune,<br> Mourning cannot save from evil.</p> 
 <p>"Sea, command thy warring forces,<br> Bid thy children cease their fury!<br> Ahto, still thy surging billows!<br> Sink, Wellamo, to thy slumber,<br> That our boat may move in safety.<br> Rise, ye storm-winds, to your kingdoms,<br> Lift your heads above the waters,<br> To the regions of your kindred,<br> To your people and dominions;<br> Cut the trees within the forest,<br> Bend the lindens of the valley,<br> Let our vessel sail in safety!"</p> 
 <p>Then the reckless Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome wizard, Kaukomieli,<br> Spake these words in supplication:<br> "Come, O eagle, Turyalander,<br> Bring three feathers from thy pinions,<br> Three, O raven, three, O eagle,<br> To protect this bark from evil!"</p> 
 <p>All the heroes of Wainola<br> Call their forces to the rescue,<br> And repair the sinking vessel.<br> By the aid of master-magic,<br> Wainamoinen saved his war-ship,<br> Saved his people from destruction,<br> Well repaired his ship to battle<br> With the roughest seas of Northland;<br> Steers his mighty boat in safety<br> Through the perils of the whirlpool,<br> Through the watery deeps and dangers.</p>
