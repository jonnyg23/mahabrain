 <p>LEMMINKAINEN, full of joyance,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Took provisions in abundance,<br> Fish and butter, bread and bacon,<br> Hastened to the Isle of Refuge,<br> Sailed away across the oceans,<br> Spake these measures on departing:<br> "Fare thee well, mine Island-dwelling,<br> I must sail to other borders,<br> To an island more protective,<br> Till the second summer passes;<br> Let the serpents keep the island,<br> Lynxes rest within the glen-wood,<br> Let the blue-moose roam the mountains,<br> Let the wild-geese cat the barley.<br> Fare thee well, my helpful mother!<br> When the warriors of the Northland,<br> From the dismal Sariola,<br> Come with swords, and spears, and cross-bows,<br> Asking for my head in vengeance,<br> Say that I have long departed,<br> Left my mother's Island-dwelling,<br> When the barley had been garnered."</p> 
 <p>Then he launched his boat of copper,<br> Threw the vessel to the waters,<br> From the iron-banded rollers,<br> From the cylinders of oak-wood,<br> On the masts the sails he hoisted,<br> Spread the magic sails of linen,<br> In the stern the hero settled<br> And prepared to sail his vessel,<br> One hand resting on the rudder.</p> 
 <p>Then the sailor spake as follows,<br> These the words of Lemminkainen:<br> "Blow, ye winds, and drive me onward,<br> Blow ye steady, winds of heaven,<br> Toward the island in the ocean,<br> That my bark may fly in safety<br> To my father's place of refuge,<br> To the far and nameless island!"</p> 
 <p>Soon the winds arose as bidden,<br> Rocked the vessel o'er the billows,<br> O'er the blue-back of the waters,<br> O'er the vast expanse of ocean;<br> Blew two months and blew unceasing,<br> Blew a third month toward the island,<br> Toward his father's Isle of Refuge.</p> 
 <p>Sat some maidens on the seaside,<br> On the sandy beach of ocean,<br> Turned about in all directions,<br> Looking out upon the billows;<br> One was waiting for her brother,<br> And a second for her father,<br> And a third one, anxious, waited<br> For the, coming of her suitor;<br> There they spied young Lemminkainen,<br> There perceived the hero's vessel<br> Sailing o'er the bounding billows;<br> It was like a hanging cloudlet,<br> Hanging twixt the earth and heaven.</p> 
 <p>Thus the island-maidens wondered,<br> Thus they spake to one another:<br> "What this stranger on the ocean,<br> What is this upon the waters?<br> Art thou one of our sea-vessels?<br> Wert thou builded on this island?<br> Sail thou straightway to the harbor,<br> To the island-point of landing<br> That thy tribe may be discovered."</p> 
 <p>Onward did the waves propel it,<br> Rocked his vessel o'er the billows,<br> Drove it to the magic island,<br> Safely landed Lemminkainen<br> On the sandy shore and harbor.</p> 
 <p>Spake he thus when he had landed,<br> These the words that Ahti uttered:<br> "Is there room upon this island,<br> Is there space within this harbor,<br> Where my bark may lie at anchor,<br> Where the sun may dry my vessel?"</p> 
 <p>This the answer of the virgins,<br> Dwellers on the Isle of Refuge:<br> "There is room within this harbor,<br> On this island, space abundant,<br> Where thy bark may lie at anchor,<br> Where the sun may dry thy vessel;<br> Lying ready are the rollers,<br> Cylinders adorned with copper;<br> If thou hadst a hundred vessels,<br> Shouldst thou come with boats a thousand,<br> We would give them room in welcome."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<br> Rolled his vessel in the harbor,<br> On the cylinders of copper,<br> Spake these words when he had ended:<br> "Is there room upon this island,<br> Or a spot within these forests,<br> Where a hero may be hidden<br> From the coming din of battle,<br> From the play of spears and arrows?<br> Thus replied the Island-maidens:<br> "There are places on this island,<br> On these plains a spot befitting<br> Where to hide thyself in safety,<br> Hero-son of little valor.<br> Here are many, many castles,<br> Many courts upon this island;<br> Though there come a thousand heroes,<br> Though a thousand spearmen. follow,<br> Thou canst hide thyself in safety."<br> Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<br> "Is there room upon this island,<br> Where the birch-tree grows abundant,<br> Where this son may fell the forest,<br> And may cultivate the fallow? "<br> Answered thus the Island-maidens:<br> "There is not a spot befitting,<br> Not a place upon the island,<br> Where to rest thy wearied members,<br> Not the smallest patch of birch-wood,<br> Thou canst bring to cultivation.<br> All our fields have been divided,<br> All these woods have been apportioned,<br> Fields and forests have their owners."</p> 
 <p>Lemminkainen asked this question,<br> These the words of Kaukomieli:<br> "Is there room upon this island,<br> Worthy spot in field or forest,<br> Where to Sing my songs of magic,<br> Chant my gathered store of wisdom,<br> Sing mine ancient songs and legends?"<br> Answered thus the Island-maidens:<br> "There is room upon this island,<br> Worthy place in these dominions,<br> Thou canst sing thy garnered wisdom,<br> Thou canst chant thine ancient legends,<br> Legends of the times primeval,<br> In the forest, in the castle,<br> On the island-plains and pastures."</p> 
 <p>Then began the reckless minstrel<br> To intone his wizard-sayings;<br> Sang he alders to the waysides,<br> Sang the oaks upon the mountains,<br> On the oak-trees sang be branches,<br> On each branch he sang an acorn,<br> On the acorns, golden rollers,<br> On each roller, sang a cuckoo;<br> Then began the cuckoos, calling,<br> Gold from every throat came streaming,<br> Copper fell from every feather,<br> And each wing emitted silver,<br> Filled the isle with precious metals.<br> Sang again young Lemminkainen,<br> Conjured on, and sang, and chanted,<br> Sang to precious stones the sea-sands,<br> Sang the stones to pearls resplendent,<br> Robed the groves in iridescence,<br> Sang the island full of flowers,<br> Many-colored as the rainbow.<br> Sang again the magic minstrel,<br> In the court a well he conjured,<br> On the well a golden cover,<br> On the lid a silver dipper,<br> That the boys might drink the water,<br> That the maids might lave their eyelids.<br> On the plains he conjured lakelets,<br> Sang the duck upon the waters,<br> Golden-cheeked and silver-headed,<br> Sang the feet from shining copper;<br> And the Island-maidens wondered,<br> Stood entranced at Ahti's wisdom,<br> At the songs of Lemminkainen,<br> At the hero's magic power.</p> 
 <p>Spake the singer, Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:<br> "I would sing a wondrous legend,<br> Sing in miracles of sweetness,<br> If within some hall or chamber,<br> I were seated at the table.<br> If I sing not in the castle,<br> In some spot by walls surrounded<br> Then I sing my songs to zephyrs,<br> Fling them to the fields and forests."<br> Answered thus the Island-maidens:<br> "On this isle are castle-chambers,<br> Halls for use of magic singers,<br> Courts complete for chanting legends,<br> Where thy singing will be welcome,<br> Where thy songs will not be scattered<br> To the forests of the island,<br> Nor thy wisdom lost in ether."</p> 
 <p>Straightway Lemminkainen journeyed<br> With the maidens to the castle;<br> There he sang and conjured pitchers<br> On the borders of the tables,<br> Sang and conjured golden goblets<br> Foaming with the beer of barley;<br> Sang he many well-filled vessels,<br> Bowls of honey-drink abundant,<br> Sweetest butter, toothsome biscuit,<br> Bacon, fish, and veal, and venison,<br> All the dainties of the Northland,<br> Wherewithal to still his hunger.<br> But the proud-heart, Lemminkainen,<br> Was not ready for the banquet,<br> Did not yet begin his feasting,<br> Waited for a knife of silver,<br> For a knife of golden handle;<br> Quick he sang the precious metals,<br> Sang a blade from purest silver,<br> To the blade a golden handle,<br> Straightway then began his feasting,<br> Quenched his thirst and stilled his hunger,<br> Charmed the maidens on the island.</p> 
 <p>Then the minstrel, Lemminkainen,<br> Roamed throughout the island-hamlets,<br> To the joy of all the virgins,<br> All the maids of braided tresses;<br> Wheresoe'er he turned his footsteps,<br> There appeared a maid to greet him;<br> When his hand was kindly offered,<br> There his band was kindly taken;<br> When he wandered out at evening,<br> Even in the darksome places,<br> There the maidens bade him welcome;<br> There was not an island-village<br> Where there were not seven castles,<br> In each castle seven daughters,<br> And the daughters stood in waiting,<br> Gave the hero joyful greetings,<br> Only one of all the maidens<br> Whom he did not greet with pleasure.</p> 
 <p>Thus the merry Lemminkainen<br> Spent three summers in the ocean,<br> Spent a merry time in refuge,<br> In the hamlets on the island,<br> To the pleasure of the maidens,<br> To the joy of all the daughters;<br> Only one was left neglected,<br> She a poor and graceless spinster,<br> On the isle's remotest border,<br> In the smallest of the hamlets.</p> 
 <p>'Then he thought about his journey<br> O'er the ocean to his mother,<br> To the cottage of his father.<br> There appeared the slighted spinster,<br> To the Northland son departing,<br> Spake these words to Lemminkainen:<br> "O, thou handsome Kaukomieli,<br> Wisdom-bard, and magic singer,<br> Since this maiden thou hast slighted,<br> May the winds destroy thy vessel,<br> Dash thy bark to countless fragments<br> On the ocean-rocks and ledges!"</p> 
 <p>Lemminkainen's thoughts were homeward,<br> Did not heed the maiden's murmurs,<br> Did not rise before the dawning<br> Of the morning on the island,<br> To the pleasure of the maiden<br> Of the much-neglected hamlet.<br> Finally at close of evening,<br> He resolved to leave the island,<br> He resolved to waken early,<br> Long before the dawn of morning;<br> Long before the time appointed,<br> He arose that he might wander<br> Through the hamlets of the island,<br> Bid adieu to all the maidens,<br> On the morn of his departure.<br> As he wandered hither, thither,<br> Walking through the village path-ways<br> To the last of all the hamlets;<br> Saw he none of all the castle-,<br> Where three dwellings were not standing;<br> Saw he none of all the dwellings<br> Where three heroes were not watching;<br> Saw he none of all the heroes,<br> Who was not engaged in grinding<br> Swords, and spears, and battle-axes,<br> For the death of Lemminkainen.<br> And these words the hero uttered:<br> "Now alas! the Sun arises<br> From his couch within the ocean,<br> On the frailest of the heroes,<br> On the saddest child of Northland;<br> On my neck the cloak of Lempo<br> Might protect me from all evil,<br> Though a hundred foes assail me,<br> Though a thousand archers follow."</p> 
 <p>Then he left the maids ungreeted,<br> Left his longing for the daughters<br> Of the nameless Isle of Refuge,<br> With his farewell-words unspoken,<br> Hastened toward the island-harbor,<br> Toward his magic bark at anchor;<br> But he found it burned to ashes,<br> Sweet revenge had fired his vessel,<br> Lighted by the slighted spinster.<br> Then he saw the dawn of evil,<br> Saw misfortune hanging over,<br> Saw destruction round about him.<br> Straightway he began rebuilding<br> Him a magic sailing-vessel,<br> New and wondrous, full of beauty;<br> But the hero needed timber,<br> Boards, and planks, and beams, and braces,<br> Found the smallest bit of lumber,<br> Found of boards but seven fragments,<br> Of a spool he found three pieces,<br> Found six pieces of the distaff;<br> With these fragments builds his vessel,<br> Builds a ship of magic virtue,<br> Builds the bark with secret knowledge,<br> Through the will of the magician;<br> Strikes one blow, and builds the first part,<br> Strikes a second, builds the centre,<br> Strikes a third with wondrous power,<br> And the vessel is completed.</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the ship he launches,<br> Sings the vessel to the ocean,<br> And these words the hero utters:<br> "Like a bubble swim these waters,<br> Like a flower ride the billows;<br> Loan me of thy magic feathers,<br> Three, O eagle, four, O raven,<br> For protection to my vessel,<br> Lest it flounder in the ocean!"</p> 
 <p>Now the sailor, Lemminkainen,<br> Seats himself upon the bottom<br> Of the vessel he has builded,<br> Hastens on his journey homeward,<br> Head depressed and evil-humored,<br> Cap awry upon his forehead,<br> Mind dejected, heavy-hearted,<br> That he could not dwell forever<br> In the castles of the daughters<br> Of the nameless Isle of Refuge.</p> 
 <p>Spake the minstrel, Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:<br> "Leave I must this merry island,<br> Leave her many joys and pleasures,<br> Leave her maids with braided tresses,<br> Leave her dances and her daughters,<br> To the joys of other heroes;<br> But I take this comfort with me:<br> All the maidens on the island,<br> Save the spinster who was slighted,<br> Will bemoan my loss for ages,<br> Will regret my quick departure;<br> They will miss me at the dances,<br> In the halls of mirth and joyance,<br> In the homes of merry maidens,<br> On my father's Isle of Refuge."</p> 
 <p>Wept the maidens on the island,<br> Long lamenting, loudly calling<br> To the hero sailing homeward:<br> "Whither goest, Lemminkainen,<br> Why depart, thou best of heroes?<br> Dost thou leave from inattention,<br> Is there here a dearth of maidens,<br> Have our greetings been unworthy?"</p> 
 <p>Sang the magic Lemminkainen<br> To the maids as he was sailing,<br> This in answer to their calling:<br> "Leaving not for want of pleasure,<br> Do not go from dearth of women<br> Beautiful the island-maidens,<br> Countless as the sands their virtues.<br> This the reason of my going,<br> I am longing for my home-land,<br> Longing for my mother's cabins,<br> For the strawberries of Northland,<br> For the raspberries of Kalew,<br> For the maidens of my childhood,<br> For the children of my mother."</p> 
 <p>Then the merry Lemminkainen<br> Bade farewell to all the island;<br> Winds arose and drove his vessel<br> On the blue-back of the ocean,<br> O'er the far-extending waters,<br> Toward the island of his mother.<br> On the shore were grouped the daughters<br> Of the magic Isle of Refuge,<br> On the rocks sat the forsaken,<br> Weeping stood the island-maidens,<br> Golden daughters, loud-lamenting.<br> Weep the maidens of the island<br> While the sail-yards greet their vision,<br> While the copper-beltings glisten;<br> Do not weep to lose the sail-yards,<br> Nor to lose the copper-beltings;<br> Weep they for the loss of Ahti,<br> For the fleeing Kaukomieli<br> Guiding the departing vessel.<br> Also weeps young Lemminkainen,<br> Sorely weeps, and loud-lamenting,<br> Weeps while he can see the island,<br> While the island hill-tops glisten;<br> Does not mourn the island-mountains,<br> Weeps he only for the maidens,<br> Left upon the Isle of Refuge.</p> 
 <p>Thereupon sailed Kaukomieli<br> On the blue-back of the ocean;<br> Sailed one day, and then a second,<br> But, alas! upon the third day,<br> There arose a mighty storm-wind,<br> And the sky was black with fury.<br> Blew the black winds from the north-west,<br> From the south-east came the whirlwind,<br> Tore away the ship's forecastle,<br> Tore away the vessel's rudder,<br> Dashed the wooden hull to pieces.<br> Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<br> Headlong fell upon the waters;<br> With his head he did the steering,<br> With his hands and feet, the rowing;<br> Swam whole days and nights unceasing,<br> Swam with hope and strength united,<br> Till at last appeared a cloudlet,<br> Growing cloudlet to the westward,<br> Changing to a promontory,<br> Into land within the ocean.</p> 
 <p>Swiftly to the shore swam Ahti,<br> Hastened to a magic castle,<br> Found therein a hostess baking,<br> And her daughters kneading barley,<br> And these words the hero uttered:<br> "O, thou hostess, filled with kindness,<br> Couldst thou know my pangs of hunger,<br> Couldst thou guess my name and station,<br> Thou wouldst hasten to the storehouse,<br> Bring me beer and foaming liquor,<br> Bring the best of thy provisions,<br> Bring me fish, and veal, and bacon,<br> Butter, bread, and honeyed biscuits,<br> Set for me a wholesome dinner,<br> Wherewithal to still my hunger,<br> Quench the thirst of Lemminkainen.<br> Days and nights have I been swimming,<br> Buffeting the waves of ocean,<br> Seemed as if the wind protected,<br> And the billows gave me shelter,"</p> 
 <p>Then the hostess, filled with kindness,<br> Hastened to the mountain storehouse,<br> Cut some butter, veal, and bacon,<br> Bread, and fish, and honeyed biscuit,<br> Brought the best of her provisions,<br> Brought the mead and beer of barley,<br> Set for him a toothsome dinner,<br> Wherewithal to still his hunger,<br> Quench the thirst of Lemminkainen.</p> 
 <p>When the hero's feast had ended,<br> Straightway was a magic vessel<br> Given by the kindly hostess<br> To the weary Kaukomieli,<br> Bark of beauty, new and hardy,<br> Wherewithal to aid the stranger<br> In his journey to his home-land,<br> To the cottage of his mother.</p> 
 <p>Quickly sailed wild Lemminkainen<br> On the blue-back of the ocean;<br> Sailed he days and nights unceasing,<br> Till at last he reached the borders<br> Of his own loved home and country;<br> There beheld he scenes familiar,<br> Saw the islands, capes, and rivers,<br> Saw his former shipping-stations,<br> Saw he many ancient landmarks,<br> Saw the mountains with their fir-trees,<br> Saw the pine-trees on the hill-tops,<br> Saw the willows in the lowlands;<br> Did not see his father's cottage,<br> Nor the dwellings of his mother.<br> Where a mansion once had risen,<br> There the alder-trees were growing,<br> Shrubs were growing on the homestead,<br> Junipers within the court-yard.<br> Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "In this glen I played and wandered,<br> On these stones I rocked for ages,<br> On this lawn I rolled and tumbled,<br> Frolicked on these woodland-borders,<br> When a child of little stature.<br> Where then is my mother's dwelling,<br> Where the castles of my father?<br> Fire, I fear, has found the hamlet,<br> And the winds dispersed the ashes."</p> 
 <p>Then he fell to bitter weeping,<br> Wept one day and then a second,<br> Wept the third day without ceasing;<br> Did not mourn the ancient homestead,<br> Nor the dwellings of his father;<br> Wept he for his darling mother,<br> Wept he for the dear departed,<br> For the loved ones of the island.</p> 
 <p>Then he saw the bird of heaven,<br> Saw an eagle flying near him,<br> And he asked the bird this question:<br> "Mighty eagle, bird majestic,<br> Grant to me the information,<br> Where my mother may have wandered,<br> Whither I may go and find her!"</p> 
 <p>But the eagle knew but little,<br> Only knew that Ahti's people<br> Long ago together perished;<br> And the raven also answered<br> That his people had been scattered<br> By the, swords, and spears, and arrows,<br> Of his enemies from Pohya.<br> Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<br> "Faithful mother, dear departed,<br> Thou who nursed me in my childhood,<br> Art thou dead and turned to ashes,<br> Didst thou perish for my follies,<br> O'er thy head are willows weeping,<br> Junipers above thy body,<br> Alders watching o'er thy slumbers?<br> This my punishment for evil,<br> This the recompense of folly!<br> Fool was I, a son unworthy,<br> That I measured swords in Northland<br> With the landlord of Pohyola,<br> To my tribe came fell destruction,<br> And the death of my dear mother,<br> Through my crimes and misdemeanors."</p> 
 <p>Then the ministrel <i>[sic]</i> looked about him,<br> Anxious, looked in all directions,<br> And beheld some gentle foot-prints,<br> Saw a pathway lightly trodden<br> Where the heather had been beaten.<br> Quick as thought the path he followed,<br> Through the meadows, through the brambles,<br> O'er the hills, and through the valleys,<br> To a forest, vast and cheerless;<br> Travelled far and travelled farther,<br> Still a greater distance travelled,<br> To a dense and hidden glenwood,<br> In the middle of the island;<br> Found therein a sheltered cabin,<br> Found a small and darksome dwelling<br> Built between the rocky ledges,<br> In the midst of triple pine-trees;<br> And within he spied his mother,<br> Found his gray-haired mother weeping.</p> 
 <p>Lemminkainen loud rejoices,<br> Cries in tones of joyful greetings,<br> These the words that Ahti utters:<br> "Faithful mother, well-beloved,<br> Thou that gavest me existence,<br> Happy I, that thou art living,<br> That thou hast not yet departed<br> To the kingdom of Tuoni,<br> To the islands of the blessed,<br> I had thought that thou hadst perished,<br> Hadst been murdered by my foemen,<br> Hadst been slain with bows and arrows.<br> Heavy are mine eyes from weeping,<br> And my checks are white with sorrow,<br> Since I thought my mother slaughtered<br> For the sins I had committed!"<br> Lemminkainen's mother answered:<br> "Long, indeed, hast thou been absent,<br> Long, my son, hast thou been living<br> In thy father's Isle of Refuge,<br> Roaming on the secret island,<br> Living at the doors of strangers,<br> Living in a nameless country,<br> Refuge from the Northland foemen."<br> Spake the, hero, Lemminkainen:<br> "Charming is that spot for living,<br> Beautiful the magic island,<br> Rainbow-colored was the forest,<br> Blue the glimmer of the meadows,<br> Silvered were, the pine-tree branches,<br> Golden were the heather-blossoms;<br> All the woodlands dripped with honey,<br> Eggs in every rock and crevice,<br> Honey flowed from birch and sorb-tree,<br> Milk in streams from fir and aspen,<br> Beer-foam dripping from the willows,<br> Charming there to live and linger,<br> All their edibles delicious.<br> This their only source of trouble:<br> Great the fear for all the maidens,<br> All the heroes filled with envy,<br> Feared the coming of the stranger;<br> Thought that all the island-maidens,<br> Thought that all the wives and daughters,<br> All the good, and all the evil,<br> Gave thy son too much attention;<br> Thought the stranger, Lemminkainen,<br> Saw the Island-maids too often;<br> Yet the virgins I avoided,<br> Shunned the good and shunned the evil,<br> Shunned the host of charming daughters,<br> As the black-wolf shuns the sheep-fold,<br> As the hawk neglects the chickens."</p>
