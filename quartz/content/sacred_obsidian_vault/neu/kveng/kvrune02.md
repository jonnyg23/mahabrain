 <p>THEN arose old Wainamoinen,<br> With his feet upon the island,<br> On the island washed by ocean,<br> Broad expanse devoid of verdure;<br> There remained he many summers,<br> There he lived as many winters,<br> On the island vast and vacant,<br> Well considered, long reflected,<br> Who for him should sow the island,<br> Who for him the seeds should scatter;<br> Thought at last of Pellerwoinen,<br> First-born of the plains and prairies,<br> When a slender boy, called Sampsa,<br> Who should sow the vacant island,<br> Who the forest seeds should scatter.<br> Pellerwoinen, thus consenting,<br> Sows with diligence the island,<br> Seeds upon the lands he scatters,<br> Seeds in every swamp and lowland,<br> Forest seeds upon the loose earth,<br> On the firm soil sows the acorns,<br> Fir-trees sows he on the mountains,<br> Pine-trees also on the hill-tops,<br> Many shrubs in every valley,<br> Birches sows he in the marshes,<br> In the loose soil sows the alders,<br> In the lowlands sows the lindens,<br> In the moist earth sows the willow,<br> Mountain-ash in virgin places,<br> On the banks of streams the hawthorn,<br> Junipers in hilly regions;<br> This the work of Pellerwoinen,<br> Slender Sampsa, in his childhood.<br> Soon the fertile seeds were sprouting,<br> Soon the forest trees were growing,<br> Soon appeared the tops of fir-trees,<br> And the pines were far outspreading;<br> Birches rose from all the marshes,<br> In the loose soil grew the alders,<br> In the mellow soil the lindens;<br> Junipers were also growing,<br> Junipers with clustered berries,<br> Berries on the hawthorn branches.</p> 
 <p>Now the hero, Wainamoinen,<br> Stands aloft to look about him,<br> How the Sampsa-seeds are growing,<br> How the crop of Pellerwoinen;<br> Sees the young trees thickly spreading,<br> Sees the forest rise in beauty;<br> But the oak-tree has not sprouted,<br> Tree of heaven is not growing,<br> Still within the acorn sleeping,<br> Its own happiness enjoying.<br> Then he waited three nights longer,<br> And as many days he waited,<br> Waited till a week had vanished,<br> Then again the work examined;<br> But the oak-tree was not growing,<br> Had not left her acorn-dwelling.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient hero,<br> Spies four maidens in the distance,<br> Water-brides, he spies a fifth-one,<br> On the soft and sandy sea-shore,<br> In the dewy grass and flowers,<br> On a point extending seaward,<br> Near the forests of the island.<br> Some were mowing, some were raking,<br> Raking what was mown together,<br> In a windrow on the meadow.</p> 
 <p>From the ocean rose a giant,<br> Mighty Tursas, tall and hardy,<br> Pressed compactly all the grasses,<br> That the maidens had been raking,<br> When a fire within them kindles,<br> And the flames shot up to heaven,<br> Till the windrows burned to ashes,<br> Only ashes now remaining<br> Of the grasses raked together.<br> In the ashes of the windrows,<br> Tender leaves the giant places,<br> In the leaves he plants an acorn,<br> From the acorn, quickly sprouting,<br> Grows the oak-tree, tall and stately,<br> From the ground enriched by ashes,<br> Newly raked by water-maidens;<br> Spread the oak-tree's many branches,<br> Rounds itself a broad corona,<br> Raises it above the storm-clouds;<br> Far it stretches out its branches,<br> Stops the white-clouds in their courses,<br> With its branches hides the sunlight,<br> With its many leaves, the moonbeams,<br> And the starlight dies in heaven.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<br> Thought awhile, and well considered,<br> How to kill the mighty oak-tree,<br> First created for his pleasure,<br> How to fell the tree majestic,<br> How to lop its hundred branches.<br> Sad the lives of man and hero,<br> Sad the homes of ocean-dwellers,<br> If the sun shines not upon them,<br> If the moonlight does not cheer them<br> Is there not some mighty hero,<br> Was there never born a giant,<br> That can fell the mighty oak-tree,<br> That can lop its hundred branches?<br> Wainamoinen, deeply thinking,<br> Spake these words soliloquizing:<br> "Kapé, daughter of the Ether,<br> Ancient mother of my being,<br> Luonnotar, my nurse and helper,<br> Loan to me the water-forces,<br> Great the powers of the waters;<br> Loan to me the strength of oceans,<br> To upset this mighty oak-tree,<br> To uproot this tree of evil,<br> That again may shine the sunlight,<br> That the moon once more may glimmer."</p> 
 <p>Straightway rose a form from oceans,<br> Rose a hero from the waters,<br> Nor belonged he to the largest,<br> Nor belonged he to the smallest,<br> Long was he as man's forefinger,<br> Taller than the hand of woman;<br> On his head a cap of copper,<br> Boots upon his feet were copper,<br> Gloves upon his hands were copper,<br> And its stripes were copper-colored,<br> Belt around him made of copper,<br> Hatchet in his belt was copper;<br> And the handle of his hatchet<br> Was as long as hand of woman,<br> Of a finger's breadth the blade was.<br> Then the trusty Wainamoinen<br> Thought awhile and well considered,<br> And his measures are as follow:<br> "Art thou, sir, divine or human?<br> Which of these thou only knowest;<br> Tell me what thy name and station.<br> Very like a man thou lookest,<br> Hast the bearing of a hero,<br> Though the length of man's first finger,<br> Scarce as tall as hoof of reindeer."</p> 
 <p>Then again spake Wainamoinen<br> To the form from out the ocean:<br> "Verily I think thee human,<br> Of the race of pigmy-heroes,<br> Might as well be dead or dying,<br> Fit for nothing but to perish."</p> 
 <p>Answered thus the pigmy-hero,<br> Spake the small one from the ocean<br> To the valiant Wainamoinen<br> "Truly am I god and hero,<br> From the tribes that rule the ocean;<br> Come I here to fell the oak-tree,<br> Lop its branches with my hatchet."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<br> Answers thus the sea-born hero:<br> "Never hast thou force sufficient,<br> Not to thee has strength been given,<br> To uproot this mighty oak-tree,<br> To upset this thing of evil,<br> Nor to lop its hundred branches."</p> 
 <p>Scarcely had he finished speaking,<br> Scarcely had he moved his eyelids,<br> Ere the pigmy full unfolding,<br> Quick becomes a mighty giant.<br> With one step he leaves the ocean,<br> Plants himself, a mighty hero,<br> On the forest-fields surrounding;<br> With his head the clouds he pierces,<br> To his knees his beard extending,<br> And his locks fall to his ankles;<br> Far apart appear his eyeballs,<br> Far apart his feet are stationed.<br> Farther still his mighty shoulders.<br> Now begins his axe to sharpen,<br> Quickly to an edge he whets it,<br> Using six hard blocks of sandstone,<br> And of softer whetstones, seven.<br> Straightway to the oak-tree turning,<br> Thither stalks the mighty giant,<br> In his raiment long and roomy,<br> Flapping in the winds of heaven;<br> With his second step he totters<br> On the land of darker color;<br> With his third stop firmly planted,<br> Reaches he the oak-tree's branches,<br> Strikes the trunk with sharpened hatchet,<br> With one mighty swing he strikes it,<br> With a second blow he cuts it;<br> As his blade descends the third time,<br> From his axe the sparks fly upward,<br> From the oak-tree fire outshooting;<br> Ere the axe descends a fourth time,<br> Yields the oak with hundred branches,<br> Shaking earth and heaven in falling.<br> Eastward far the trunk extending,<br> Far to westward flew the tree-tops,<br> To the South the leaves were scattered,<br> To the North its hundred branches.<br> Whosoe'er a branch has taken,<br> Has obtained eternal welfare;<br> Who secures himself a tree-top,<br> He has gained the master magic;<br> Who the foliage has gathered,<br> Has delight that never ceases.<br> Of the chips some had been scattered,<br> Scattered also many splinters,<br> On the blue back of the ocean,<br> Of the ocean smooth and mirrored,<br> Rocked there by the winds and waters,<br> Like a boat upon the billows;<br> Storm-winds blew them to the Northland,<br> Some the ocean currents carried.</p> 
 <p>Northland's fair and slender maiden,<br> Washing on the shore a head-dress,<br> Beating on the rocks her garments,<br> Rinsing there her silken raiment,<br> In the waters of Pohyola,<br> There beheld the chips and splinters,<br> Carried by the winds and waters.<br> In a bag the chips she gathered,<br> Took them to the ancient court-yard,<br> There to make enchanted arrows,<br> Arrows for the great magician,<br> There to shape them into weapons,<br> Weapons for the skilful archer,<br> Since the mighty oak has fallen,<br> Now has lost its hundred branches,<br> That the North may see the sunshine,<br> See the gentle gleam of moonlight,<br> That the clouds may keep their courses,<br> May extend the vault of heaven<br> Over every lake and river,<br> O'er the banks of every island.</p> 
 <p>Groves arose in varied beauty,<br> Beautifully grew the forests,<br> And again, the vines and flowers.<br> Birds again sang in the tree-tops,<br> Noisily the merry thrushes,<br> And the cuckoos in the birch-trees;<br> On the mountains grew the berries,<br> Golden flowers in the meadows,<br> And the herbs of many colors,<br> Many kinds of vegetation;<br> But the barley is not growing.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<br> Goes away and well considers,<br> By the borders of the waters,<br> On the ocean's sandy margin,<br> Finds six seeds of golden barley,<br> Even seven ripened kernels,<br> On the shore of upper Northland,<br> In the sand upon the sea-shore,<br> Hides them in his trusty pouches,<br> Fashioned from the skin of squirrel,<br> Some were made from skin of marten;<br> Hastens forth the seeds to scatter,<br> Quickly sows the barley kernels,<br> On the brinks of Kalew-waters,<br> On the Osma-hills and lowlands.</p> 
 <p>Hark! the titmouse wildly crying,<br> From the aspen, words as follow:<br> "Osma's barley will not flourish,<br> Not the barley of Wainola,<br> If the soil be not made ready,<br> If the forest be not levelled,<br> And the branches burned to ashes."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,<br> Made himself an axe for chopping,<br> Then began to clear the forest,<br> Then began the trees to level,<br> Felled the trees of all descriptions,<br> Only left the birch-tree standing<br> For the birds a place of resting,<br> Where might sing the sweet-voiced cuckoo,<br> Sacred bird in sacred branches.<br> Down from heaven came the eagle,<br> Through the air be came a-flying,<br> That he might this thing consider;<br> And he spake the words that follow:<br> "Wherefore, ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Hast thou left the slender birch-tree,<br> Left the birch-tree only standing?"<br> Wainamoinen thus made answer:<br> "Therefore is the birch left standing,<br> That the birds may liest within it,<br> That the eagle there may rest him,<br> There may sing the sacred cuckoo."<br> Spake the eagle, thus replying:<br> Good indeed, thy hero-judgment,<br> That the birch-tree thou hast left us,<br> Left the sacred birch-tree standing,<br> As a resting-place for eagles,<br> And for birds of every feather,<br> Even I may rest upon it."<br> Quickly then this bird of heaven,<br> Kindled fire among the branches;<br> Soon the flames are fanned by north-winds,<br> And the east-winds lend their forces,<br> Burn the trees of all descriptions,<br> Burn them all to dust and ashes,<br> Only is the birch left standing.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,<br> Brings his magic grains of barley,<br> Brings he forth his seven seed-grains,<br> Brings them from his trusty pouches,<br> Fashioned from the skin of squirrel,<br> Some were made from skin of marten.<br> Thence to sow his seeds he hastens,<br> Hastes the barley-grains to scatter,<br> Speaks unto himself these measures:<br> "I the seeds of life am sowing,<br> Sowing through my open fingers,<br> From the hand of my Creator,<br> In this soil enriched with ashes,<br> In this soil to sprout and flourish.<br> Ancient mother, thou that livest<br> Far below the earth and ocean,<br> Mother of the fields and forests,<br> Bring the rich soil to producing,<br> Bring the seed-grains to the sprouting,<br> That the barley well may flourish.<br> Never will the earth unaided,<br> Yield the ripe nutritious barley;<br> Never will her force be wanting,<br> If the givers give assistance,<br> If the givers grace the sowing,<br> Grace the daughters of creation.<br> Rise, O earth, from out thy slumber,<br> From the slumber-land of ages,<br> Let the barley-grains be sprouting,<br> Let the blades themselves be starting,<br> Let the verdant stalks be rising,<br> Let the ears themselves be growing,<br> And a hundredfold producing,<br> From my plowing and my sowing,<br> From my skilled and honest labor.<br> Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,<br> Thou O Father of the heavens,<br> Thou that livest high in Ether,<br> Curbest all the clouds of heaven,<br> Holdest in the air thy counsel,<br> Holdest in the clouds good counsel,<br> From the East dispatch a cloudlet,<br> From the North-east send a rain-cloud,<br> From the West another send us,<br> From the North-west, still another,<br> Quickly from the South a warm-cloud,<br> That the rain may fall from heaven,<br> That the clouds may drop their honey,<br> That the ears may fill and ripen,<br> That the barley-fields may rustle."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon benignant Ukko,<br> Ukko, father of the heavens,<br> Held his counsel in the cloud-space,<br> Held good counsel in the Ether;<br> From the East, he sent a cloudlet,<br> From the North-east, sent a rain-cloud,<br> From the West another sent he,<br> From the North-west, still another,<br> Quickly from the South a warm-cloud;<br> Joined in seams the clouds together,<br> Sewed together all their edges,<br> Grasped the cloud, and hurled it earthward.<br> Quick the rain-cloud drops her honey,<br> Quick the rain-drops fall from heaven,<br> That the ears may quickly ripen,<br> That the barley crop may rustle.<br> Straightway grow the seeds of barley,<br> From the germ the blade unfolding,<br> Richly colored ears arising,<br> From the rich soil of the fallow,<br> From the work of Wainamoinen.</p> 
 <p>Here a few days pass unnoted<br> And as many nights fly over.<br> When the seventh day had journeyed,<br> On the morning of the eighth day,<br> Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,<br> Went to view his crop of barley,<br> How his plowing, how his sowing,<br> How his labors were resulting;<br> Found his crop of barley growing,<br> Found the blades were triple-knotted,<br> And the ears he found six-sided.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<br> Turned his face, and looked about him,<br> Lo! there comes a spring-time cuckoo,<br> Spying out the slender birch-tree,<br> Rests upon it, sweetly singing:<br> "Wherefore is the silver birch-tree<br> Left unharmed of all the forest? "<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Therefore I have left the birch-tree,<br> Left the birch-tree only growing,<br> Home for thee for joyful singing.<br> Call thou here, O sweet-voiced cuckoo,<br> Sing thou here from throat of velvet,<br> Sing thou here with voice of silver,<br> Sing the cuckoo's golden flute-notes;<br> Call at morning, call at evening,<br> Call within the hour of noontide,<br> For the better growth of forests,<br> For the ripening of the barley,<br> For the richness of, the Northland,<br> For the joy of Kalevala."</p>
