 <p>AHTI, hero of the Islands,<br> Wild magician, Lemminkainen,<br> Also known as Kaukomieli,<br> Hastened from the great carousal,<br> From the banquet-halls of Louhi,<br> From the ever-darksome Northland,<br> From the dismal Sariola.<br> Stormful strode he from the mansion,<br> Hastened like the smoke of battle,<br> From the court-yard of Pohyola,<br> Left his crimes and misdemeanors<br> In the halls of ancient Louhi.<br> Then he looked in all directions,<br> Seeking for his tethered courser,<br> Anxious looked in field and stable,<br> But he did not find his racer;<br> Found a black thing in the fallow,<br> Proved to be a clump of willows.<br> Who will well advise the hero,<br> Who will give him wise directions,<br> Guide the wizard out of trouble,<br> Give his hero-locks protection,<br> Keep his magic head from danger<br> From the warriors of Northland?</p> 
 <p>Noise is beard within the village,<br> And a din from other homesteads,<br> From the battle-hosts of Louhi,<br> Streaming from the doors and window,<br> Of the homesteads of Pohyola.</p> 
 <p>Thereupon young Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome Islander and hero,<br> Changing both his form and features,<br> Clad himself in other raiment,<br> Changing to another body,<br> Quick became a mighty eagle,<br> Soared aloft on wings of magic,<br> Tried to fly to highest heaven,<br> But the moonlight burned his temples,<br> And the sunshine singed his feathers.</p> 
 <p>Then entreating, Lemminkainen,<br> Island-hero, turned to Ukko,<br> This the prayer that Ahti uttered:<br> "Ukko, God of love and mercy,<br> Thou the Wisdom of the heavens,<br> Wise Director of the lightning,<br> Thou the Author of the thunder,<br> Thou the Guide of all the cloudlets,<br> Give to me thy cloak of vapor,<br> Throw a silver cloud around me,<br> That I may in its protection<br> Hasten to my native country,<br> To my mother's Island-dwelling,<br> Fly to her that waits my coming,<br> With a mother's grave forebodings."</p> 
 <p>Farther, farther, Lemminkainen<br> Flew and soared on eagle-pinions,<br> Looked about him, backwards, forwards,<br> Spied a gray-hawk soaring near him,<br> In his eyes the fire of splendor,<br> Like the eyes of Pohyalanders,<br> Like the eyes of Pohya's spearmen,<br> And the gray-hawk thus addressed him:<br> "Ho! There! hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Art thou thinking of our combat<br> With the, hero-heads of Northland?"</p> 
 <p>Thus the Islander made answer,<br> These the words of Kaukomieli:<br> "O thou gray-hawk, bird of beauty,<br> Fly direct to Sariola,<br> Fly as fast as wings can bear thee;<br> When thou hast arrived in safety,<br> On the plains of darksome Northland,<br> Tell the archers and the spearmen,<br> They will never catch the eagle,<br> In his journey from Pohyola,<br> To his Island-borne and fortress."</p> 
 <p>Then the Ahti-eagle hastened<br> Straightway to his mother's cottage,<br> In his face the look of trouble,<br> In his heart the pangs of sorrow.<br> Ahti's mother ran to meet him,<br> When she spied him in the pathway,<br> Walking toward her island-dwelling;<br> These the words the mother uttered:<br> "Of my sons thou art the bravest,<br> Art the strongest of my children;<br> Wherefore then comes thine annoyance,<br> On returning from Pohyola?<br> Wert thou worsted at the banquet,<br> At the feast and great carousal?<br> At thy cups, if thou wert injured,<br> Thou shalt here have better treatment<br> Thou shalt have the cup thy father<br> Brought me from the hero-castle."<br> Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "Worthy mother, thou that nursed me,<br> If I had been maimed at drinking,<br> I the landlord would have worsted,<br> Would have slain a thousand heroes,<br> Would have taught them useful lessons."<br> Lemminkainen's mother answered:<br> "Wherefore then art thou indignant,<br> Didst thou meet disgrace and insult,<br> Did they rob thee of thy courser?<br> Buy thou then a better courser<br> With the riches of thy mother,<br> With thy father's horded treasures."<br> Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<br> "Faithful mother of my being,<br> If my steed had been insulted,<br> If for him my heart was injured,<br> I the landlord would have punished,<br> Would have punished all the horsemen,<br> All of Pohya's strongest riders."<br> Lemminkainen's mother answered:<br> "Tell me then thy dire misfortune,<br> What has happened to my hero,<br> On his journey to Pohyola?<br> Have the Northland maidens scorned thee,<br> Have the women ridiculed thee?<br> If the maidens scorned thy presence.<br> If the women gave derision,<br> There are others thou canst laugh at,<br> Thou canst scorn a thousand women."<br> Said the reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "Honored mother, fond and faithful,<br> If the Northland dames had scorned me<br> Or the maidens laughed derision,<br> I the maidens would have punished,<br> Would have scorned a thousand women."<br> Lemminkainen's mother answered:<br> "Wherefore then are thou indignant,<br> Thus annoyed, and heavy-hearted,<br> On returning from Pohyola?<br> Was thy feasting out of season,<br> Was the banquet-beer unworthy,<br> Were thy dreams of evil import<br> When asleep in darksome Northland?"<br> This is Lemminkainen's answer:<br> "Aged women may remember<br> What they dream on beds of trouble;<br> I have seen some wondrous visions,<br> Since I left my Island-cottage.<br> My beloved, helpful mother,<br> Fill my bag with good provisions,<br> Flour and salt in great abundance,<br> Farther must thy hero wander,<br> He must leave his home behind him,<br> Leave his pleasant Island-dwelling,<br> Journey from this home of ages;<br> Men are sharpening their broadswords,<br> Sharpening their spears and lances,<br> For the death of Lemminkainen."</p> 
 <p>Then again the mother questioned,<br> Hurriedly she asked the reason:<br> "Why the men their swords were whetting,<br> Why their spears are being sharpened."</p> 
 <p>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:<br> "Therefore do they whet their broadswords,<br> Therefore sharpen they their lances:<br> It is for thy son's destruction,<br> At his heart are aimed their lances.<br> In the court-yard of Pohyola,<br> There arose a great contention,<br> Fierce the battle waged against me;<br> But I slew the Northland hero,<br> Killed the host of Sariola;<br> Quick to arms rose Louhi's people,<br> All the spears and swords of Northland<br> Were directed at thy hero;<br> All of Pohya turned against me,<br> Turned against a single foeman."<br> This the answer of the mother:<br> "I had told thee this beforehand,<br> I had warned thee of this danger,<br> And forbidden thee to journey<br> To the hostile fields of Northland.<br> Here my hero could have lingered,<br> Passed his life in full contentment,<br> Lived forever with his mother,<br> With his mother for protection,<br> In the court-yard with his kindred;<br> Here no war would have arisen,<br> No contention would have followed.<br> Whither wilt thou go, my hero,<br> Whither will my loved one hasten,<br> To escape thy fierce pursuers,<br> To escape from thy misdoings,<br> From thy sins to bide in safety,<br> From thy crimes and misdemeanors,<br> That thy head be not endangered,<br> That thy body be not mangled,<br> That thy locks be not outrooted?"<br> Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "Know I not a spot befitting,<br> Do not know a place of safety,<br> Where to hide from my pursuers,<br> That will give me sure protection<br> From the crimes by me committed.<br> Helpful mother of my being,<br> Where to flee wilt thou advise me?"<br> This the answer of the mother:<br> "I do not know where I can send thee;<br> Be a pine-tree on the mountain,<br> Or a juniper in lowlands?<br> Then misfortune may befall thee;<br> Often is the mountain pine-tree<br> Cut in splints for candle-lighters;<br> And the juniper is often<br> Peeled for fence-posts for the pastures.<br> Go a birch-tree to the valleys,<br> Or an elm-tree to the glenwood?<br> Even then may trouble find thee,<br> Misery may overtake thee;<br> Often is the lowland birch-tree<br> Cut to pieces in the ware-house;<br> Often is the elm-wood forest<br> Cleared away for other plantings.<br> Be a berry on the highlands,<br> Cranberry upon the heather,<br> Strawberry upon the mountains,<br> Blackberry along the fences?<br> Even there will trouble find thee,<br> There misfortune overtake thee,<br> For the berry-maids would pluck thee,<br> Silver-tinselled girls would get thee.<br> Be a pike then in the ocean,<br> Or a troutlet in the rivers?<br> Then would trouble overtake thee,<br> Would become thy life-companion;<br> Then the fisherman would catch thee,<br> Catch thee in his net of flax-thread,<br> Catch thee with his cruel fish-hook.<br> Be a wolf then in the forest,<br> Or a black-bear in the thickets?<br> Even then would trouble find thee,<br> And disaster cross thy pathway;<br> Sable hunters of the Northland<br> Have their spears and cross-bows ready<br> To destroy the wolf and black-bear."<br> Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "Know I well the worst of places,<br> Know where Death will surely follow,<br> Where misfortune's eye would find me;<br> Since thou gavest me existence,<br> Gavest nourishment in childhood,<br> Whither shall I flee for safety,<br> Whither hide from death and danger?<br> In my view is fell destruction,<br> Dire misfortune 'hovers o'er me;<br> On the morrow come the spearmen,<br> Countless warriors from Pohya,<br> Ahti's head their satisfaction."<br> This the answer of the mother:<br> "I can name a goodly refuge,<br> Name a land of small dimensions,<br> Name a distant ocean-island,<br> Where my son may live in safety.<br> Thither archers never wander,<br> There thy head cannot be severed;<br> But an oath as strong as heaven,<br> Thou must swear before thy mother;<br> Thou wilt not for sixty summers<br> Join in war or deadly combat,<br> Even though thou wishest silver,<br> Wishest gold and silver treasures."<br> Spake the grateful Lemminkainen:<br> "I will swear an oath of honor,<br> That I'll not in sixty summers<br> Draw my sword in the arena,<br> Test the warrior in battle;<br> I have wounds upon my shoulders,<br> On my breast two scars of broadsword,<br> Of my former battles, relies,<br> Relies of my last encounters,<br> On the battle-fields of Northland,<br> In the wars with men and heroes."<br> Lemminkainen's mother answered:<br> "Go thou, take thy father's vessel,<br> Go and bide thyself in safety,<br> Travel far across nine oceans;<br> In the tenth, sail to the centre,<br> To the island, forest-covered,<br> To the cliffs above the waters,<br> Where thy father went before thee,<br> Where he hid from his pursuers,<br> In the times of summer conquests,<br> In the darksome days of battle;<br> Good the isle for thee to dwell in,<br> Goodly place to live and linger;<br> Hide one year, and then a second,<br> In the third return in safety<br> To thy mother's island dwelling,<br> To thy father's ancient mansion,<br> To my hero's place of resting."</p>
