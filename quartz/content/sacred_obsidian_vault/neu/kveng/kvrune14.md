 <p>LEMMINKAINEN, much disheartened,<br> Deeply thought and long considered,<br> What to do, what course to follow,<br> Whether best to leave the wild-moose<br> In the fastnesses of Hisi,<br> And return to Kalevala,<br> Or a third time hunt the ranger,<br> Hoping thus to bring him captive,<br> Thus return at last a victor<br> To the forest home of Louhi,<br> To the joy of all her daughters,<br> To the wood-nymph's happy fireside.</p> 
 <p>Taking courage Lemminkainen<br> Spake these words in supplication:<br> "Ukko, thou O God above me,<br> Thou Creator of the heavens,<br> Put my snow-shoes well in order,<br> And endow them both with swiftness,<br> That I rapidly may journey<br> Over marshes, over snow-fields,<br> Over lowlands, over highlands,<br> Through the realms of wicked Hisi,<br> Through the distant plains of Lapland,<br> Through the paths of Lempo's wild-moose,<br> To the forest hills of Juutas.<br> To the snow-fields shall I journey,<br> Leave the heroes to the woodlands,<br> On the way to Tapiola,<br> Into Tapio's wild dwellings.</p> 
 <p>"Greeting bring I to the mountains,<br> Greeting to the vales and uplands,<br> Greet ye, heights with forests covered,<br> Greet ye, ever-verdant fir-trees,<br> Greet ye, groves of whitened aspen,<br> Greetings bring to those that greet you,<br> Fields, and streams, and woods of Lapland.<br> Bring me favor, mountain-woodlands,<br> Lapland-deserts, show me kindness,<br> Mighty Tapio, be gracious,<br> Let me wander through thy forests,<br> Let me glide along thy rivers,<br> Let this hunter search thy snow-fields,<br> Where the wild-moose herds in numbers<br> Where the bounding reindeer lingers.</p> 
 <p>"O Nyrikki, mountain hero,<br> Son of Tapio of forests,<br> Hero with the scarlet head-gear,<br> Notches make along the pathway,<br> Landmarks upward to the mountains,<br> That this hunter may not wander,<br> May not fall, and falling perish<br> In the snow-fields of thy kingdom,<br> Hunting for the moose of Hisi,<br> Dowry for the pride of Northland.</p> 
 <p>"Mistress of the woods, Mielikki,<br> Forest-mother, formed in beauty,<br> Let thy gold flow out abundant,<br> Let thy silver onward wander,<br> For the hero that is seeking<br> For the wild-moose of thy kingdom;<br> Bring me here thy keys of silver,<br> From the golden girdle round thee;<br> Open Tapio's rich chambers,<br> And unlock the forest fortress,<br> While I here await the booty,<br> While I hunt the moose of Lempo.</p> 
 <p>"Should this service be too menial<br> Give the order to thy servants,<br> Send at once thy servant-maidens,<br> And command it to thy people.<br> Thou wilt never seem a hostess,<br> If thou hast not in thy service,<br> Maidens ready by the hundreds,<br> Thousands that await thy bidding,<br> Who thy herds may watch and nurture,<br> Tend the game of thy dominions.</p> 
 <p>"Tall and slender forest-virgin,<br> Tapio's beloved daughter,<br> Blow thou now thy honey flute-notes,<br> Play upon thy forest-whistle,<br> For the hearing of thy mistress,<br> For thy charming woodland-mistress,<br> Make her hear thy sweet-toned playing,<br> That she may arise from slumber.<br> Should thy mistress not awaken<br> At the calling of thy flute-notes,<br> Play again, and play unceasing,<br> Make the golden tongue re-echo."</p> 
 <p>Wild and daring Lemminkainen<br> Steadfast prays upon his journey,<br> Calling on the gods for succor,<br> Hastens off through fields and moorlands,<br> Passes on through cruel brush-wood,<br> To the colliery of Hisi,<br> To the burning fields of Lempo;<br> Glided one day, then a second,<br> Glided all the next day onward,<br> Till he came to Big-stone mountain,<br> Climbed upon its rocky summit,<br> Turned his glances to the north-west,<br> Toward the Northland moors and marshes;<br> There appeared the Tapio-mansion.<br> All the doors were golden-colored,<br> Shining in the gleam of sunlight<br> Through the thickets on the mountains,<br> Through the distant fields of Northland.</p> 
 <p>Lemminkainen, much encouraged,<br> Hastens onward from his station<br> Through the lowlands, o'er the uplands,<br> Over snow-fields vast and vacant,<br> Under snow-robed firs and aspens,<br> Hastens forward, happy-hearted,<br> Quickly reaches Tapio's court-yards,<br> Halts without at Tapio's windows,<br> Slyly looks into her mansion,<br> Spies within some kindly women,<br> Forest-dames outstretched before him,<br> All are clad in scanty raiment,<br> Dressed in soiled and ragged linens.<br> Spake the stranger Lemminkainen:<br> "Wherefore sit ye, forest-mothers,<br> In your old and simple garments,<br> In your soiled and ragged linen?<br> Ye, forsooth! are too untidy,<br> Too unsightly your appearance<br> In your tattered gowns appareled.<br> When I lived within the forest,<br> There were then three mountain castles,<br> One of horn and one of ivory,<br> And the third of wood constructed;<br> In their walls were golden windows,<br> Six the windows in each castle,<br> Through these windows I discovered<br> All the host of Tapio's mansion,<br> Saw its fair and stately hostess;<br> Saw great Tapio's lovely daughter,<br> Saw Tellervo in her beauty,<br> With her train of charming maidens;<br> All were dressed in golden raiment,<br> Rustled all in gold and silver.<br> Then the forest's queenly hostess,<br> Still the hostess of these woodlands,<br> On her arms wore golden bracelets,<br> Golden rings upon her fingers,<br> In her hair were sparkling, jewels,<br> On her bead were golden fillets,<br> In her ears were golden ear-rings,<br> On her neck a pearly necklace,<br> And her braidlets, silver-tinselled.</p> 
 <p>"Lovely hostess of the forest,<br> Metsola's enchanting mistress,<br> Fling aside thine ugly straw-shoes,<br> Cast away the shoes of birch-bark,<br> Doff thy soiled and ragged linen,<br> Doff thy gown of shabby fabric,<br> Don the bright and festive raiment,<br> Don the gown of merry-making,<br> While I stay within thy borders,<br> While I seek my forest-booty,<br> Hunt the moose of evil Hisi.<br> Here my visit will be irksome,<br> Here thy guest will be ill-humored,<br> Waiting in thy fields and woodlands,<br> Hunting here the moose of Lempo,<br> Finding not the Hisi-ranger,<br> Shouldst thou give me no enjoyment,<br> Should I find no joy, nor respite.<br> Long the eve that gives no pleasure,<br> Long the day that brings no guerdon!</p> 
 <p>"Sable-bearded god of forests,<br> In thy hat and coat of ermine,<br> Robe thy trees in finest fibers,<br> Deck thy groves in richest fabrics,<br> Give the fir-trees shining silver,<br> Deck with gold the slender balsams,<br> Give the spruces copper belting,<br> And the pine-trees silver girdles,<br> Give the birches golden flowers,<br> Deck their stems with silver fret-work,<br> This their garb in former ages,<br> When the days and nights were brighter,<br> When the fir-trees shone like sunlight,<br> And the birches like the moonbeams;<br> Honey breathed throughout the forest,<br> Settled in the glens and highlands<br> Spices in the meadow-borders,<br> Oil out-pouring from the lowlands.</p> 
 <p>"Forest daughter, lovely virgin,<br> Golden maiden, fair Tulikki,<br> Second of the Tapio-daughters,<br> Drive the game within these borders,<br> To these far-extending snow-fields.<br> Should the reindeer be too sluggish,<br> Should the moose-deer move too slowly<br> Cut a birch-rod from the thicket,<br> Whip them hither in their beauty,<br> Drive the wild-moose to my hurdle,<br> Hither drive the long-sought booty<br> To the hunter who is watching,<br> Waiting in the Hisi-forests.</p> 
 <p>"When the game has started hither,<br> Keep them in the proper highway,<br> Hold thy magic hands before them,<br> Guard them well on either road-side,<br> That the elk may not escape thee,<br> May not dart adown some by-path.<br> Should, perchance, the moose-deer wander<br> Through some by-way of the forest,<br> Take him by the ears and antlers,<br> Hither lead the pride of Lempo.</p> 
 <p>"If the path be filled with brush-wood<br> Cast the brush-wood to the road-side;<br> If the branches cross his pathway,<br> Break the branches into fragments;<br> Should a fence of fir or alder<br> Cross the way that leads him hither.<br> Make an opening within it,<br> Open nine obstructing fences;<br> If the way be crossed by streamlets,<br> If the path be stopped by rivers,<br> Make a bridge of silken fabric,<br> Weaving webs of scarlet color,<br> Drive the deer-herd gently over,<br> Lead them gently o'er the waters,<br> O'er the rivers of thy forests,<br> O'er the streams of thy dominions.</p> 
 <p>"Thou, the host of Tapio's mansion,<br> Gracious host of Tapiola,<br> Sable-bearded god of woodlands,<br> Golden lord of Northland forests,<br> Thou, O Tapio's worthy hostess,<br> Queen of snowy woods, Mimerkki,<br> Ancient dame in sky-blue vesture,<br> Fenland-queen in scarlet ribbons,<br> Come I to exchange my silver,<br> To exchange my gold and silver;<br> Gold I have, as old as moonlight,<br> Silver of the age of sunshine,<br> In the first of years was gathered,<br> In the heat and pain of battle;<br> It will rust within my pouches,<br> Soon will wear away and perish,<br> If it be not used in trading."</p> 
 <p>Long the hunter, Lemminkainen,<br> Glided through the fen and forest,<br> Sang his songs throughout the woodlands,<br> Through three mountain glens be sang them,<br> Sang the forest hostess friendly,<br> Sang he, also, Tapio friendly,<br> Friendly, all the forest virgins,<br> All of Metsola's fair daughters.</p> 
 <p>Now they start the herds of Lempo,<br> Start the wild-moose from his shelter,<br> In the realms of evil Hisi,<br> Tapio's highest mountain-region;<br> Now they drive the ranger homeward,<br> To the open courts of Piru,<br> To the hero that is waiting,<br> Hunting for the moose of Juutas.</p> 
 <p>When the herd had reached the castle,<br> Lemminkainen threw his lasso<br> O'er the antlers of the blue-moose,<br> Settled on the neck and shoulders<br> Of the mighty moose of Hisi.<br> Then the hunter, Kaukomieli,<br> Stroked his captive's neck in safety,<br> For the moose was well-imprisoned.</p> 
 <p>Thereupon gay Lemminkainen<br> Filled with joyance spake as follows:<br> "Pride of forests, queen of woodlands,<br> Metsola's enchanted hostess,<br> Lovely forest dame, Mielikki,<br> Mother-donor of the mountains,<br> Take the gold that I have promised,<br> Come and take away the silver;<br> Spread thy kerchief well before me,<br> Spread out here thy silken neck-wrap,<br> Underneath the golden treasure,<br> Underneath the shining silver,<br> that to earth it may not settle,<br> Scattered on the snows of winter."</p> 
 <p>Then the hero went a victor<br> To the dwellings of Pohyola,<br> And addressed these words to Louhi:<br> "I have caught the moose of Hisi,<br> In the Metsola-dominions,<br> Give, O hostess, give thy daughter,<br> Give to me thy fairest virgin,<br> Bride of mine to be hereafter."</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<br> Gave this answer to the suitor:<br> "I will give to thee my daughter,<br> For thy wife my fairest maiden,<br> When for me thou'lt put a bridle<br> On the flaming horse of Hisi,<br> Rapid messenger of Lempo,<br> On the Hisi-plains and pastures."</p> 
 <p>Nothing daunted, Lemminkainen<br> Hastened forward to accomplish<br> Louhi's second test of heroes,<br> On the cultivated lowlands,<br> On the sacred fields and forests.<br> Everywhere he sought the racer,<br> Sought the fire-expiring stallion,<br> Fire out-shooting from his nostrils.<br> Lemminkainen, fearless hunter,<br> Bearing in his belt his bridle,<br> On his shoulders, reins and halter,<br> Sought one day, and then a second,<br> Finally, upon the third day,<br> Went he to the Hisi-mountain,<br> Climbed, and struggled to the summit;<br> To the east he turned his glances,<br> Cast his eyes upon the sunrise,<br> There beheld the flaming courser,<br> On the heath among the far-trees.<br> Lempo's fire-expiring stallion<br> Fire and mingled smoke, out-shooting<br> From his mouth, and eyes, and nostrils.</p> 
 <p>Spake the daring Lemminkainen,<br> This the hero's supplication:<br> "Ukko, thou O God above me,<br> Thou that rulest all the storm-clouds,<br> Open thou the vault of heaven,<br> Open windows through the ether,<br> Let the icy rain come falling,<br> Lot the heavy hailstones shower<br> On the flaming horse of Hisi,<br> On the fire-expiring stallion."</p> 
 <p>Ukko, the benign Creator,<br> Heard the prayer of Lemminkainen,<br> Broke apart the dome of heaven,<br> Rent the heights of heaven asunder,<br> Sent the iron-hail in showers,<br> Smaller than the heads of horses,<br> Larger than the heads of heroes,<br> On the flaming steed of Lempo,<br> On the fire-expiring stallion,<br> On the terror of the Northland.</p> 
 <p>Lemminkainen, drawing nearer,<br> Looked with care upon the courser,<br> Then he spake the words that follow:<br> "Wonder-steed of mighty Hisi,<br> Flaming horse of Lempo's mountain,<br> Bring thy mouth of gold, assenting,<br> Gently place thy head of silver<br> In this bright and golden halter,<br> In this silver-mounted bridle.<br> I shall never harshly treat thee,<br> Never make thee fly too fleetly,<br> On the way to Sariola,<br> On the tracks of long duration,<br> To the hostess of Pohyola,<br> To her magic courts and stables,<br> Will not lash thee on thy journey;<br> I shall lead thee gently forward,<br> Drive thee with the reins of kindness,<br> Cover thee with silken blankets."</p> 
 <p>Then the fire-haired steed of Juutas,<br> Flaming horse of mighty Hisi,<br> Put his bead of shining silver,<br> In the bright and golden bead-stall,<br> In the silver-mounted bridle.<br> Thus the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Easy bridles Lempo's stallion,<br> Flaming horse of evil Piru;<br> Lays the bits within his fire-mouth,<br> On his silver head, the halter,<br> Mounts the fire-expiring courser,<br> Brandishes his whip of willow,<br> Hastens forward on his journey,<br> Bounding o'er the hills and mountains,<br> Dashing through the valleys northward,<br> O'er the snow-capped hills of Lapland,<br> To the courts of Sariola.</p> 
 <p>Then the hero, quick dismounting,<br> Stepped within the court of Louhi,<br> Thus addressed the Northland hostess:<br> "I have bridled Lempo's fire-horse,<br> I have caught the Hisi-racer,<br> Caught the fire-expiring stallion,<br> In the Piru plains and pastures,<br> Ridden him within thy borders;<br> I have caught the moose of Lempo,<br> I have done what thou demandest;<br> Give, I pray thee, now thy daughter,<br> Give to me thy fairest maiden,<br> Bride of mine to be forever."</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Made this answer to the suitor:<br> "I will only give my daughter,<br> Give to thee my fairest virgin,<br> Bride of thine to be forever,<br> When for me the swan thou killest<br> In the river of Tuoni,<br> Swimming in the black death-river,<br> In the sacred stream and whirlpool;<br> Thou canst try one cross-bow only,<br> But one arrow from thy quiver."</p> 
 <p>Then the reckless Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Braved the third test of the hero,<br> Started out to hunt the wild-swan,<br> Hunt the long-necked, graceful swimmer,<br> In Tuoni's coal-black river,<br> In Manala's lower regions.<br> Quick the daring hunter journeyed,<br> Hastened off with fearless footsteps,<br> To the river of Tuoni,<br> To the sacred stream and whirlpool,<br> With his bow upon his shoulder,<br> With his quiver and one arrow.</p> 
 <p>Nasshut, blind and crippled shepherd,<br> Wretched shepherd of Pohyola,<br> Stood beside the death-land river,<br> Near the sacred stream and whirlpool,<br> Guarding Tuonela's waters,<br> Waiting there for Lemminkainen,<br> Listening there for Kaukomieli,<br> Waiting long the hero's coming.<br> Finally he hears the footsteps<br> Of the hero on his journey,<br> Hears the tread of Lemminkainen,<br> As he journeys nearer, nearer,<br> To the river of Tuoni,<br> To the cataract of death-land,<br> To the sacred stream and whirlpool.<br> Quick the wretched shepherd, Nasshut,<br> From the death-stream sends a serpent,<br> Like an arrow from a cross-bow,<br> To the heart of Lemminkainen,<br> Through the vitals of the hero.</p> 
 <p>Lemminkainen, little conscious,<br> Hardly knew that be was injured,<br> Spake these measures as he perished.<br> "Ah! unworthy is my conduct,<br> Ah! unwisely have I acted,<br> That I did not heed my mother,<br> Did not take her goodly counsel,<br> Did not learn her words of magic.<br> Oh I for three words with my mother,<br> How to live, and bow to suffer,<br> In this time of dire misfortune,<br> How to bear the stings of serpents,<br> Tortures of the reed of waters,<br> From the stream of Tuonela!</p> 
 <p>"Ancient mother who hast borne me,<br> Who hast trained me from my childhood,<br> Learn, I pray thee, where I linger,<br> Where alas! thy son is lying,<br> Where thy reckless hero suffers.<br> Come, I pray thee, faithful mother,<br> Come thou quickly, thou art needed,<br> Come deliver me from torture,<br> From the death-jaws of Tuoni,<br> From the sacred stream and whirlpool."</p> 
 <p>Northland's old and wretched shepherd,<br> Nasshut, the despised protector<br> Of the flocks of Sariola,<br> Throws the dying Lemminkainen,<br> Throws the hero of the islands,<br> Into Tuonela's river,<br> To the blackest stream of death-land,<br> To the worst of fatal whirlpools.<br> Lemminkainen, wild and daring,<br> Helpless falls upon the waters,<br> Floating down the coal-black current,<br> Through the cataract and rapids<br> To the tombs of Tuonela.</p> 
 <p>There the blood-stained son of death-land,<br> There Tuoni's son and hero,<br> Cuts in pieces Lemminkainen,<br> Chops him with his mighty hatchet,<br> Till the sharpened axe strikes flint-sparks<br> From the rocks within his chamber,<br> Chops the hero into fragments,<br> Into five unequal portions,<br> Throws each portion to Tuoni,<br> In Manala's lowest kingdom,<br> Speaks these words when he has ended:<br> "Swim thou there, wild Lemminkainen,<br> Flow thou onward in this river,<br> Hunt forever in these waters,<br> With thy cross-bow and thine arrow,<br> Shoot the swan within this empire,<br> Shoot our water-birds in welcome!"<br> Thus the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Thus the handsome Kaukomieli,<br> The untiring suitor, dieth<br> In the river of Tuoni,<br> In the death-realm of Manala.</p>
