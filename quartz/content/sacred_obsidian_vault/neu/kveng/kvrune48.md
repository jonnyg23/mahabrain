 <p>WAINAMOINEN, the enchanter,<br> The eternal wisdom-singer,<br> Long reflected, well considered,<br> How to weave the net of flax-yarn,<br> Weave the fish-net of the fathers.<br> Spake the minstrel of Wainola:<br> "Who will plow the field and fallow,<br> Sow the flax, and spin the flax-threads,<br> That I may prepare the fish-net,<br> Wherewith I may catch the Fire-pike,<br> May secure the thing of evil?"</p> 
 <p>Soon they found a fertile island,<br> Found the fallow soil befitting,<br> On the border of the heather,<br> And between two stately oak-trees.<br> They prepared the soil for sowing.<br> Searching everywhere for flax-seed,<br> Found it in Tuoni's kingdom,<br> In the keeping of an insect.<br> Then they found a pile of ashes,<br> Where the fire had burned a vessel;<br> In the ashes sowed the seedlings<br> Near the Alue-lake and border,<br> In the rich and loamy fallow.<br> There the seed took root and flourished,<br> Quickly grew to great proportions,<br> In a single night in summer.<br> Thus the flax was sowed at evening,<br> Placed within the earth by moonlight;<br> Quick it grew, and quickly ripened,<br> Quick Wainola's heroes pulled it,<br> Quick they broke it on the hackles,<br> Hastened with it to the waters,<br> Dipped it in the lake and washed it;<br> Quickly brought it borne and dried it.<br> Quickly broke, and combed, and smoothed it,<br> Brushed it well at early morning,<br> Laid it into laps for spinning<br> Quick the maidens twirl the spindles,<br> Spin the flaxen threads for weaving,<br> In a single night in summer.<br> Quick the sisters wind and reel it,<br> Make it ready for the needle.<br> Brothers weave it into fish-nets,<br> And the fathers twist the cordage,<br> While the mothers knit the meshes,<br> Rapidly the mesh-stick circles;<br> Soon the fish-net is completed,<br> In a single night in summer.<br> As the magic net is finished,<br> And in length a hundred fathoms,<br> On the rim three hundred fathoms.<br> Rounded stones are fastened to it,<br> Joined thereto are seven float-boards.</p> 
 <p>Now the young men take the fish-net,<br> And the old men cheer them onward,<br> Wish them good-luck at their fishing.<br> Long they row and drag the flax-seine,<br> Here and there the net is lowered;<br> Now they drag it lengthwise, sidewise,<br> Drag it through the slimy reed-beds;<br> But they do not catch the Fire-pike,<br> Only smelts, and luckless red-fish,<br> Little fish of little value.<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "O thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Let us go ourselves a-fishing,<br> Let us catch the fish of evil!"</p> 
 <p>To the fishing went the brothers,<br> Magic heroes of the Northland,<br> Pulled the fish-net through the waters,<br> Toward an island in the deep-sea<br> Then they turn and drag the fish-net<br> Toward a meadow jutting seaward;<br> Now they drag it toward Wainola,<br> Draw it lengthwise, sidewise, crosswise,<br> Catching fish of every species,<br> salmon, trout, and pike, and whiting,<br> Do not catch the evil Fire-fish.</p> 
 <p>Then the master, Wainamoinen,<br> Made additions to its borders,<br> Made it many fathoms wider,<br> And a hundred fathoms longer,<br> Then these words the hero uttered<br> "Famous blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Let us go again a-fishing,<br> Row again the magic fish-net,<br> Drag it well through all the waters,<br> That we may obtain the Fire-pike!"</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the Northland heroes<br> Go a second time a-fishing,<br> Drag their nets across the rivers,<br> Lakelets, seas, and bays, and inlets,<br> Catching fish of many species,<br> But the Fire-fish is not taken.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient singer,<br> Long reflecting, spake these measures:<br> "Dear Wellamo, water-hostess,<br> Ancient mother with the reed-breast,<br> Come, exchange thy water-raiment,<br> Change thy coat of reeds and rushes<br> For the garments I shall give thee,<br> Light sea-foam, thine inner vesture,<br> And thine outer, moss and sea-grass,<br> Fashioned by the wind's fair daughters,<br> Woven by the flood's sweet maidens;<br> I will give thee linen vestments<br> Spun from flax of softest fiber,<br> Woven by the Moon's white virgins,<br> Fashioned by the Sun's bright daughters<br> Fitting raiment for Wellamo!</p> 
 <p>"Ahto, king of all the waters,<br> Ruler of a thousand grottoes,<br> Take a pole of seven fathoms,<br> Search with this the deepest waters,<br> Rummage well the lowest bottoms;<br> Stir up all the reeds and sea-weeds,<br> Hither drive a school of gray-pike,<br> Drive them to our magic fish-net,<br> From the haunts in pike abounding,<br> From the caverns, and the trout-holes,<br> From the whirlpools of the deep-sea,<br> From the bottomless abysses,<br> Where the sunshine never enters,<br> Where the moonlight never visits,<br> And the sands are never troubled."</p> 
 <p>Rose a pigmy from the waters,<br> From the floods a little hero,<br> Riding on a rolling billow,<br> And the pigmy spake these measures:<br> "Dost thou wish a worthy helper,<br> One to use the pole and frighten<br> Pike and salmon to thy fish-nets?"</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<br> Answered thus the lake-born hero:<br> "Yea, we need a worthy helper,<br> One to hold the pole, and frighten<br> Pike and salmon to our fish-nets."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the water-pigmy<br> Cut a linden from the border,<br> Spake these words to Wainamoinen:<br> "Shall I scare with all my powers,<br> With the forces of my being,<br> As thou needest shall I scare them?"<br> Spake the minstrel, Wainamoinen:<br> "If thou scarest as is needed,<br> Thou wilt scare with all thy forces,<br> With the strength of thy dominions."</p> 
 <p>Then began the pigmy-hero,<br> To affright the deep-sea-dwellers;<br> Drove the fish in countless numbers<br> To the net of the magicians.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Drew his net along the waters,<br> Drew it with his ropes of flax-thread,<br> Spake these words of magic import:<br> "Come ye fish of Northland waters<br> To the regions of my fish-net,<br> As my hundred meshes lower."</p> 
 <p>Then the net was drawn and fastened,<br> Many were the gray-pike taken<br> By he master and magician.<br> Wainamoinen, happy-hearted,<br> Hastened to a neighboring island,<br> To a blue-point in the waters,<br> Near a red-bridge on the headland;<br> Landed there his draught of fishes,<br> Cast the pike upon the sea-shore,<br> And the Fire-pike was among them,<br> Cast the others to the waters.<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "May I touch thee with my fingers,<br> Using not my gloves of iron,<br> Using not my blue-stone mittens?<br> This the Sun-child hears and answers:<br> "I should like to carve the Fire-fish,<br> I should like this pike to handle,<br> If I had the knife of good-luck."</p> 
 <p>Quick a knife falls from the heavens,<br> From the clouds a magic fish-knife,<br> Silver-edged and golden-headed,<br> To the girdle of the Sun-child;<br> Quick he grasps the copper handle,<br> Quick the hero carves the Fire-pike,<br> Finds therein the tortured lake-trout;<br> Carves the lake-trout thus discovered.<br> Finds therein the fated whiting;<br> Carves the whiting, finds a blue-ball<br> In the third cave of his body.<br> He, the blue-ball quick unwinding,<br> Finds within a ball of scarlet;<br> Carefully removes the cover,<br> Finds the ball of fire within it,<br> Finds the flame from heaven fallen,<br> From the heights of the seventh heaven,<br> Through nine regions of the ether.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen long reflected<br> How to get the magic fire-ball<br> To Wainola's fireless hearth-stones,<br> To his cold and cheerless dwellings.<br> Quick he snatched the fire of heaven<br> From the fingers of the Sun-child.<br> Wainamoinen's beard it singes,<br> Burns the brow of Ilmarinen,<br> Burns the fingers of the blacksmith.<br> Rolling forth it hastens westward,<br> Hastens to the Alue shore-lines,<br> Burns the juniper and alder,<br> Burns the and heath and meadow,<br> Rises to the lofty linden,<br> Burns the firs upon the mountains;<br> Hastens onward, onward, onward,<br> Burns the islands of the Northland,<br> Burns the Sawa fields and forests,<br> Burns the dry lands of Karyala.</p> 
 <p>Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<br> Hastens through the fields and fenlands,<br> Tracks the ranger to the glen-wood,<br> Finds the Fire-child in an elm-tree,<br> Sleeping in a bed of fungus.</p> 
 <p>Thereupon wise Wainamoinen<br> Wakes the child and speaks these measures:<br> "Wicked fire that God created,<br> Flame of Ukko from the heavens,<br> Thou hast gone in vain to sea-caves,<br> To the lakes without a reason;<br> Better go thou to my village,<br> To the hearth-stones of my people;<br> Hide thyself within my chimneys,<br> In mine ashes sleep and linger.<br> In the day-time I will use thee<br> To devour the blocks of birch-wood;<br> In the evening I will hide thee<br> Underneath the golden circle."</p> 
 <p>Then he took the willing Panu,<br> Took the willing fire of Ukko,<br> Laid it in a box of tinder,<br> In the punk-wood of a birch-tree,<br> In a vessel forged from copper;<br> Carried it with care and pleasure<br> To the fog-point in the waters,<br> To the island forest covered.<br> Thus returned the fire to Northland,<br> To the chambers of Wainola,<br> To the hearths of Kalevala.</p> 
 <p>Ilmarinen, famous blacksmith,<br> Hastened to the deep-sea's margin,<br> Sat upon the rock of torture,<br> Feeling pain the flame had given,<br> Laved his wounds with briny water,<br> Thus to still the Fire-child's fury,<br> Thus to end his persecutions.</p> 
 <p>Long reflecting, Ilmarinen<br> Thus addressed the flame of Ukko:<br> "Evil Panu from the, heavens,<br> Wicked son of God from ether,<br> Tell me what has made thee angry,<br> Made thee burn my weary members,<br> Burn my beard, and face, and fingers,<br> Made me suffer death-land tortures?<br> Spake again young Ilmarinen:<br> "How can I wild Panu conquer,<br> How shall I control his conduct,<br> Make him end his evil doings?<br> Come, thou daughter from Pohyola,<br> Come, white virgin of the hoar-frost,<br> Come on shoes of ice from Lapland,<br> Icicles upon thy garments,<br> In one band a cup of white-frost,<br> In the other hand an ice-spoon;<br> Sprinkle snow upon my members,<br> Where the Fire-child has been resting,<br> Let the hoar-frost fall and settle.</p> 
 <p>"Should this prayer be unavailing,<br> Come, thou son of Sariola,<br> Come, thou child of Frost from Pohya,<br> Come, thou Long-man from the ice-plains,<br> Of the height of stately pine-trees,<br> Slender as the trunks of lindens,<br> On thy hands the gloves of Hoar-frost,<br> Cap of ice upon thy forehead,<br> On thy waist a white-frost girdle;<br> Bring the ice-dust from Pohyola,<br> From the cold and sunless village.<br> Rain is crystallized in Northland,<br> Ice in Pohya is abundant,<br> Lakes of ice and ice-bound rivers,<br> Frozen smooth, the sea of ether.<br> Bounds the hare in frosted fur-robe,<br> Climbs the bear in icy raiment,<br> Ambles o'er the snowy mountains.<br> Swans of frost descend the rivers,<br> Ducks of ice in countless numbers<br> Swim upon thy freezing waters,<br> Near the cataract and whirlpool.<br> Bring me frost upon thy snow-sledge,<br> Snow and ice in great abundance,<br> From the summit of the wild-top,<br> From the borders of the mountains.<br> With thine ice, and snow, and hoar-frost<br> Cover well mine injured members<br> Where wild Panu has been resting,<br> Where the child of Fire has lingered.</p> 
 <p>"Should this call be ineffective,<br> Ukko, God of love and mercy,<br> First and last of the creators,<br> From the east send forth a snow-cloud,<br> From the west despatch a second,<br> Join their edges well together,<br> Let there be no vacant places,<br> Let these clouds bring snow and<br> Lay the healing balm of Ukko<br> On my burning, tortured tissues,<br> Where wild Panu has been resting."<br> Thus the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Stills the pains by fire engendered,<br> Stills the agonies and tortures<br> Brought him by the child of evil,<br> Brought him by the wicked Panu.</p>
