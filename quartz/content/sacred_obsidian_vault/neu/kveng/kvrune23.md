 <p>Now the bride must be instructed,<br> Who will teach the Maid of Beauty,<br> Who instruct the Rainbow-daughter?<br> Osmotar, the wisdom-maiden,<br> Kalew's fair and lovely virgin,<br> Osmotar will give instructions<br> To the bride of Ilmarinen,<br> To the orphaned bride of Pohya,<br> Teach her how to live in pleasure,<br> How to live and reign in glory,<br> Win her second mother's praises,<br> Joyful in her husband's dwelling.</p> 
 <p>Osmotar in modest accents<br> Thus the anxious bride addresses;<br> "Maid of Beauty, lovely sister,<br> Tender plant of Louhi's gardens,<br> Hear thou what thy sister teaches,<br> Listen to her sage instructions:<br> Go thou hence, my much beloved,<br> Wander far away, my flower,<br> Travel on enwrapped in colors,<br> Glide away in silks and ribbons,<br> From this house renowned and ancient,<br> From thy father's halls and court-yards<br> Haste thee to thy husband's village,<br> Hasten to his mother's household;<br> Strange, the rooms in other dwellings,<br> Strange, the modes in other hamlets.</p> 
 <p>"Full of thought must be thy going,<br> And thy work be well considered,<br> Quite unlike thy home in Northland,<br> On the meadows of thy father,<br> On the high-lands of thy brother,<br> Singing through thy mother's fenlands,<br> Culling daisies with thy sister.<br> "When thou goest from thy father<br> Thou canst take whatever pleases,<br> Only three things leave behind thee:<br> Leave thy day-dreams to thy sister,<br> Leave thou kindness for thy mother,<br> To thy brother leave thy labors,<br> Take all else that thou desirest.<br> Throw away thine incantations,<br> Cast thy sighing to the pine-trees,<br> And thy maidenhood to zephyrs,<br> Thy rejoicings to the couches,<br> Cast thy trinkets to the children,<br> And thy leisure to the gray-beards,<br> Cast all pleasures to thy playmates,<br> Let them take them to the woodlands,<br> Bury them beneath the mountain.</p> 
 <p>"Thou must hence acquire new habits,<br> Must forget thy former customs,<br> Mother-love must be forsaken,<br> Thou must love thy husband's mother,<br> Lower must thy head be bended,<br> Kind words only must thou utter.</p> 
 <p>"Thou must hence acquire new habits,<br> Must forget thy former customs,<br> Father-love must be forsaken,<br> Thou must love thy husband's father,<br> Lower must thy head be bended,<br> Kind words only must thou utter.</p> 
 <p>"Thou must hence acquire new habits,<br> Must forget thy former customs,<br> Brother-love must be forsaken,<br> Thou must love thy husband's brother,<br> Lower must thy head be bended,<br> Kind words only must thou utter.</p> 
 <p>"Thou must hence acquire new habits<br> Must forget thy former customs,<br> Sister-love must be forsaken,<br> Thou must love thy husband's sister,<br> Lower must thy head be bended,<br> Kind words only must thou utter.</p> 
 <p>"Never in the course of ages,<br> Never while the moonlight glimmers,<br> Wickedly approach thy household,<br> Nor unworthily, thy servants,<br> Nor thy courts with indiscretion;<br> Let thy dwellings sing good manners,<br> And thy walls re-echo virtue.<br> After mind the hero searches.<br> And the best of men seek honor,<br> Seek for honesty and wisdom;<br> If thy home should be immoral,<br> If thine inmates fail in virtue,<br> Then thy gray-beards would be black-dogs<br> In sheep's clothing at thy firesides;<br> All thy women would be witches,<br> Wicked witches in thy chambers,<br> And thy brothers be as serpents<br> Crawling through thy husband's mansion;<br> All thy sisters would be famous<br> For their evil thoughts and conduct.</p> 
 <p>"Equal honors must be given<br> To thy husband's friends and kindred;<br> Lower must thy head be bended,<br> Than within thy mother's dwelling,<br> Than within thy father's guest-room,<br> When thou didst thy kindred honor.<br> Ever strive to give good counsel,<br> Wear a countenance of sunshine,<br> Bear a head upon thy shoulders<br> Filled with wise and ancient sayings;<br> Open bright thine eyes at morning<br> To behold the silver sunrise,<br> Sharpen well thine ears at evening,<br> Thus to hear the rooster crowing;<br> When he makes his second calling,<br> Straightway thou must rise from slumber,<br> Let the aged sleep in quiet;<br> Should the rooster fail to call thee,<br> Let the moonbeams touch thine eyelids,<br> Let the Great Bear be thy keeper<br> Often go thou and consult them,<br> Call upon the Moon for counsel,<br> Ask the Bear for ancient wisdom,<br> From the stars divine thy future;<br> When the Great Bear faces southward,<br> When his tail is pointing northward,<br> This is time to break with slumber,<br> Seek for fire within the ashes,<br> Place a spark upon the tinder,<br> Blow the fire through all the fuel.<br> If no spark is in the ashes,<br> Then go wake thy hero-husband,<br> Speak these words to him on waking:<br> 'Give me fire, O my beloved,<br> Give a single spark, my husband,<br> Strike a little fire from flintstone,<br> Let it fall upon my tinder.'</p> 
 <p>"From the spark, O Bride of Beauty,<br> Light thy fires, and heat thine ovens,<br> In the holder, place the torch-light,<br> Find thy pathway to the stables,<br> There to fill the empty mangers;<br> If thy husband's cows be lowing,<br> If thy brother's steeds be neighing,<br> Then the cows await thy coming,<br> And the steeds for thee are calling,<br> Hasten, stooping through the hurdles,<br> Hasten through the yards and stables,<br> Feed thy husband's cows with pleasure,<br> Feed with care the gentle lambkins,<br> Give the cows the best of clover,<br> Hay, and barley, to the horses,<br> Feed the calves of lowing mothers,<br> Feed the fowl that fly to meet thee.</p> 
 <p>"Never rest upon the haymow,<br> Never sleep within the hurdles,<br> When the kine are fed and tended,<br> When the flocks have all been watered;<br> Hasten thence, my pretty matron,<br> Like the snow-flakes to thy dwelling,<br> There a crying babe awaits thee,<br> Weeping in his couch neglected,<br> Cannot speak and tell his troubles,<br> Speechless babe, and weeping infant,<br> Cannot say that he is hungry,<br> Whether pain or cold distresses,<br> Greets with joy his mother's footsteps.<br> Afterward repair in silence<br> To thy husband's rooms and presence,<br> Early visit thou his chambers,<br> In thy hand a golden pitcher,<br> On thine arm a broom of birch-wood,<br> In thy teeth a lighted taper,<br> And thyself the fourth in order.<br> Sweep thou then thy hero's dwelling,<br> Dust his benches and his tables,<br> Wash the flooring well with water.</p> 
 <p>"If the baby of thy sister<br> Play alone within his corner,<br> Show the little child attention,<br> Bathe his eyes and smoothe his ringlets,<br> Give the infant needed comforts;<br> Shouldst thou have no bread of barley,<br> In his hand adjust some trinket.</p> 
 <p>"Lastly, when the week has ended,<br> Give thy house a thorough cleansing,<br> Benches, tables, walls, and ceilings;<br> What of dust is on the windows,<br> Sweep away with broom of birch-twigs,<br> All thy rooms must first be sprinkled,<br> at the dust may not be scattered,<br> May not fill the halls and chambers.<br> Sweep the dust from every crevice,<br> Leave thou not a single atom;<br> Also sweep the chimney-corners,<br> Do not then forget the rafters,<br> Lest thy home should seem untidy,<br> Lest thy dwelling seem neglected.</p> 
 <p>"Hear, O maiden, what I tell thee,<br> Learn the tenor of my teaching:<br> Never dress in scanty raiment,<br> Let thy robes be plain and comely,<br> Ever wear the whitest linen,<br> On thy feet wear tidy fur-shoes,<br> For the glory of thy husband,<br> For the honor of thy hero.<br> Tend thou well the sacred sorb-tree,<br> Guard the mountain-ashes planted<br> In the court-yard, widely branching;<br> Beautiful the mountain-ashes,<br> Beautiful their leaves and flowers,<br> Still more beautiful the berries.<br> Thus the exiled one demonstrates<br> That she lives to please her husband,<br> Tries to make her hero happy.</p> 
 <p>"Like the mouse, have ears for hearing,<br> Like the hare, have feet for running,<br> Bend thy neck and turn thy visage<br> Like the juniper and aspen,<br> Thus to watch with care thy goings,<br> Thus to guard thy feet from stumbling,<br> That thou mayest walk in safety.</p> 
 <p>"When thy brother comes from plowing,<br> And thy father from his garners,<br> And thy husband from the woodlands,<br> From his chopping, thy beloved,<br> Give to each a water-basin,<br> Give to each a linen-towel,<br> Speak to each some pleasant greeting.</p> 
 <p>"When thy second mother hastens<br> To thy husband's home and kindred,<br> In her hand a corn-meal measure,<br> Haste thou to the court to meet her,<br> Happy-hearted, bow before her,<br> Take the measure from her fingers,<br> Happy, bear it to thy husband.</p> 
 <p>"If thou shouldst not see distinctly<br> What demands thy next attention,<br> Ask at once thy hero's mother:<br> 'Second mother, my beloved,<br> Name the task to be accomplished<br> By thy willing second daughter,<br> Tell me how to best perform it.'</p> 
 <p>"This should be the mother's answer:<br> 'This the manner of thy workings,<br> Thus thy daily work accomplish:<br> Stamp with diligence and courage,<br> Grind with will and great endurance,<br> Set the millstones well in order,<br> Fill the barley-pans with water,<br> Knead with strength the dough for baking,<br> Place the fagots on the fire-place,<br> That thy ovens may be heated,<br> Bake in love the honey-biscuit,<br> Bake the larger loaves of barley,<br> Rinse to cleanliness thy platters,<br> Polish well thy drinking-vessels.</p> 
 <p>"If thou hearest from the mother,<br> From the mother of thy husband,<br> That the cask for meal is empty,<br> Take the barley from the garners,<br> Hasten to the rooms for grinding.<br> When thou grindest in the chambers,<br> Do not sing in glee and joyance,<br> Turn the grinding-stones in silence,<br> To the mill give up thy singing,<br> Let the side-holes furnish music;<br> Do not sigh as if unhappy,<br> Do not groan as if in trouble,<br> Lest the father think thee weary,<br> Lest thy husband's mother fancy<br> That thy groans mean discontentment,<br> That thy sighing means displeasure.<br> Quickly sift the flour thou grindest,<br> Take it to the casks in buckets,<br> Bake thy hero's bread with pleasure,<br> Knead the dough with care and patience,<br> That thy biscuits may be worthy,<br> That the dough be light and airy.</p> 
 <p>"Shouldst thou see a bucket empty,<br> Take the bucket on thy shoulder,<br> On thine arm a silver-dipper,<br> Hasten off to fill with water<br> From the crystal river flowing;<br> Gracefully thy bucket carry,<br> Bear it firmly by the handles,<br> Hasten houseward like the zephyrs,<br> Hasten like the air of autumn;<br> Do not tarry near the streamlet,<br> At the waters do not linger,<br> That the father may not fancy,<br> Nor the ancient dame imagine,<br> That thou hast beheld thine image,<br> Hast admired thy form and features,<br> Hast admired thy grace and beauty<br> In the mirror of the fountain,<br> In the crystal streamlet's eddies.</p> 
 <p>"Shouldst thou journey to the woodlands,<br> There to gather aspen-fagots,<br> Do not go with noise and bustle,<br> Gather all thy sticks in silence,<br> Gather quietly the birch-wood,<br> That the father may not fancy,<br> And the mother not imagine,<br> That thy calling came from anger,<br> And thy noise from discontentment.</p> 
 <p>"If thou goest to the store-house<br> To obtain the flour of barley,<br> Do not tarry on thy journey,<br> On the threshold do not linger,<br> That the father may not fancy,<br> And the mother not imagine,<br> That the meal thou hast divided<br> With the women of the village.</p> 
 <p>"If thou goest to the river,<br> There to wash thy birchen platters,<br> There to cleanse thy pans and buckets,<br> Lest thy work be done in neatness,<br> Rinse the sides, and rinse the handles,<br> Rinse thy pitchers to perfection,<br> Spoons, and forks, and knives, and goblets,<br> Rinse with care thy cooking-vessels,<br> Closely watch the food-utensils,<br> That the dogs may not deface them,<br> That the kittens may not mar them,<br> That the eagles may not steal them,<br> That the children may not break them;<br> Many children in the village,<br> Many little heads and fingers,<br> That will need thy careful watching,<br> Lest they steal the things of value.</p> 
 <p>"When thou goest to thy bathing,<br> Have the brushes ready lying<br> In the bath-room clean and smokeless;<br> Do not, linger in the water,<br> At thy bathing do not tarry,<br> That the father may not fancy,<br> And the mother not imagine,<br> Thou art sleeping on the benches,<br> Rolling in the laps of comfort.</p> 
 <p>"From thy bath, when thou returnest,<br> To his bathing tempt the father,<br> Speak to him the words that follow:<br> 'Father of my hero-husband,<br> Clean are all the bath-room benches,<br> Everything in perfect order;<br> Go and bathe for thine enjoyment,<br> Pour the water all-sufficient,<br> I will lend thee needed service.'</p> 
 <p>"When the time has come for spinning,<br> When the hours arrive for weaving,<br> Do not ask the help of others,<br> Look not in the stream for knowledge,<br> For advice ask not the servants,<br> Nor the spindle from the sisters,<br> Nor the weaving-comb from strangers.<br> Thou thyself must do the spinning,<br> With thine own hand ply the shuttle,<br> Loosely wind the skeins of wool-yarn,<br> Tightly wind the balls of flax-thread,<br> Wind them deftly in the shuttle<br> Fit the warp upon the rollers,<br> Beat the woof and warp together,<br> Swiftly ply the weaver's shuttle,<br> Weave good cloth for all thy vestments,<br> Weave of woolen, webs for dresses<br> From the finest wool of lambkins,<br> One thread only in thy weaving.</p> 
 <p>"Hear thou what I now advise thee:<br> Brew thy beer from early barley,<br> From the barley's new-grown kernels,<br> Brew it with the magic virtues,<br> Malt it with the sweets of honey,<br> Do not stir it with the birch-rod,<br> Stir it with thy skilful fingers;<br> When thou goest to the garners,<br> Do not let the seed bring evil,<br> Keep the dogs outside the brew-house,<br> Have no fear of wolves in hunger,<br> Nor the wild-beasts of the mountains,<br> When thou goest to thy brewing,<br> Shouldst thou wander forth at midnight.</p> 
 <p>"Should some stranger come to see thee,<br> Do not worry for his comfort;<br> Ever does the worthy household<br> Have provisions for the stranger,<br> Bits of meat, and bread, and biscuit,<br> Ample for the dinner-table;<br> Seat the stranger in thy dwelling,<br> Speak with him in friendly accents,<br> Entertain the guest with kindness,<br> While his dinner is preparing.<br> When the stranger leaves thy threshold,<br> When his farewell has been spoken,<br> Lead him only to the portals,<br> Do not step without the doorway,<br> That thy husband may not fancy,<br> And the mother not imagine,<br> Thou hast interest in strangers.</p> 
 <p>"Shouldst thou ever make a journey<br> To the centre of the village,<br> There to gain some needed object,<br> While thou speakest in the hamlet,<br> Let thy words be full of wisdom,<br> That thou shamest not thy kindred,<br> Nor disgrace thy husband's household.</p> 
 <p>"Village-maidens oft will ask thee,<br> Mothers of the hamlet question:<br> 'Does thy husband's mother greet thee<br> As in childhood thou wert greeted,<br> In thy happy home in Pohya?'<br> Do not answer in negation,<br> Say that she has always given<br> Thee the best of her provisions,<br> Given thee the kindest greetings,<br> Though it be but once a season.</p> 
 <p>"Listen well to what I tell thee:<br> As thou goest from thy father<br> To thy husband's distant dwelling,<br> Thou must not forget thy mother,<br> Her that gave thee life and beauty,<br> Her that nurtured thee in childhood,<br> Many sleepless nights she nursed thee;<br> Often were her wants neglected,<br> Numberless the times she rocked thee;<br> Tender, true, and ever faithful,<br> Is the mother to her daughter.<br> She that can forget her mother,<br> Can neglect the one that nursed her,<br> Should not visit Mana's castle,<br> In the kingdom of Tuoni;<br> In Manala she would suffer,<br> Suffer frightful retribution,<br> Should her mother be forgotten;<br> Should her dear one be neglected,<br> Mana's daughters will torment her,<br> And Tuoni's sons revile her,<br> They will ask her much as follows:<br> 'How couldst thou forget thy mother,<br> How neglect the one that nursed thee?<br> Great the pain thy mother suffered,<br> Great the trouble that thou gavest<br> When thy loving mother brought thee<br> Into life for good or evil,<br> When she gave thee earth-existence,<br> When she nursed thee but an infant,<br> When she fed thee in thy childhood,<br> When she taught thee what thou knowest,<br> Mana's punishments upon thee,<br> Since thy mother is forgotten!'"<br> On the floor a witch was sitting,<br> Near the fire a beggar-woman,<br> One that knew the ways of people,<br> These the words the woman uttered:<br> "Thus the crow calls in the winter:<br> 'Would that I could be a singer,<br> And my voice be full of sweetness,<br> But, alas! my songs are worthless,<br> Cannot charm the weakest creature;<br> I must live without the singing<br> Leave the songs to the musicians,<br> Those that live in golden houses,<br> In the homes of the beloved;<br> Homeless therefore I must wander,<br> Like a beggar in the corn-fields,<br> And with none to do me honor.'</p> 
 <p>"Hear now, sister, what I tell thee,<br> Enter thou thy husband's dwelling,<br> Follow not his mind, nor fancies,<br> As my husband's mind I followed;<br> As a flower was I when budding,<br> Sprouting like a rose in spring-time,<br> Growing like a slender maiden,<br> Like the honey-gem of glory,<br> Like the playmates of my childhood,<br> Like the goslings of my father,<br> Like the blue-ducks of my mother,<br> Like my brother's water-younglings,<br> Like the bullfinch of my sister;<br> Grew I like the heather-flower,<br> Like the berry of the meadow,<br> Played upon the sandy sea-shore,<br> Rocked upon the fragrant upland,<br> Sang all day adown the valley,<br> Thrilled with song the hill and mountain,<br> Filled with mirth the glen and forest,<br> Lived and frolicked in the woodlands.</p> 
 <p>"Into traps are foxes driven<br> By the cruel pangs of hunger,<br> Into traps, the cunning ermine;<br> Thus are maidens wooed and wedded,<br> In their hunger for a husband.<br> Thus created is the virgin,<br> Thus intended is the daughter,<br> Subject to her hero-husband,<br> Subject also to his mother.</p> 
 <p>"Then to other fields I hastened,<br> Like a berry from the border,<br> Like a cranberry for roasting,<br> Like a strawberry for dinner;<br> All the elm-trees seemed to wound me,<br> All the aspens tried to cut me,<br> All the willows tried to seize me,<br> All the forest tried to slay me.<br> Thus I journeyed to my husband,<br> Thus I travelled to his dwelling,<br> Was conducted to his mother.<br> Then there were, as was reported,<br> Six compartments built of pine-wood,<br> Twelve the number of the chambers,<br> And the mansion filled with garrets,<br> Studding all the forest border,<br> Every by-way filled with flowers<br> Streamlets bordered fields of barley,<br> Filled with wheat and corn, the islands,<br> Grain in plenty in the garners,<br> Rye unthrashed in great abundance,<br> Countless sums of gold and silver,<br> Other treasures without number.<br> When my journey I had ended,<br> When my hand at last was given,<br> Six supports were in his cabin,<br> Seven poles as rails for fencing.<br> Filled with anger were the bushes,<br> All the glens disfavor showing,<br> All the walks were lined with trouble,<br> Evil-tempered were the forests,<br> Hundred words of evil import,<br> Hundred others of unkindness.<br> Did not let this bring me sorrow,<br> Long I sought to merit praises,<br> Long I hoped to find some favor,<br> Strove most earnestly for kindness;<br> When they led me to the cottage,<br> There I tried some chips to gather,<br> Knocked my head against the portals<br> Of my husband's lowly dwelling.</p> 
 <p>"At the door were eyes of strangers,<br> Sable eyes at the partition,<br> Green with envy in his cabin,<br> Evil heroes in the back-ground,<br> From each mouth the fire was streaming,<br> From each tongue the sparks out-flying,<br> Flying from my second father,<br> From his eyeballs of unkindness.<br> Did not let this bring me trouble,<br> Tried to live in peace and pleasure,<br> In the homestead of my husband<br> In humility I suffered,<br> Skipped about with feet of rabbit,<br> Flew along with steps of ermine,<br> Late I laid my head to slumber,<br> Early rose as if a servant,<br> Could not win a touch of kindness,<br> Could not merit love nor honor,<br> Though I had dislodged the mountains,<br> Though the rocks had I torn open.</p> 
 <p>"Then I turned the heavy millstone,<br> Ground the flour with care and trouble,<br> Ground the barley-grains in patience,<br> That the mother might be nourished,<br> That her fury-throat might swallow<br> What might please her taste and fancy,.<br> From her gold-enamelled platters,<br> From the corner of her table.</p> 
 <p>"As for me, the hapless daughter,<br> All my flour was from the siftings<br> On the table near the oven,<br> Ate I from the birchen ladle;<br> Oftentimes I brought the mosses<br> Gathered in the lowland meadows,<br> Baked them into loaves for eating;<br> Brought the water from the river,<br> Thirsty, sipped it from the dipper,<br> Ate of fish the worst in Northland,<br> Only smelts, and worthless swimmers,<br> Rocking in my boat of birch-bark<br> Never ate I fish or biscuit<br> From my second mother's fingers.</p> 
 <p>"Blades I gathered in the summers,<br> Twisted barley-stalks in winter,<br> Like the laborers of heroes,<br> Like the servants sold in bondage.<br> In the thresh-house of my husband,<br> Evermore to me was given<br> Flail the heaviest and longest,<br> And to me the longest lever,<br> On the shore the strongest beater,<br> And the largest rake in haying;<br> No one thought my burden heavy,<br> No one thought that I could suffer,<br> Though the best of heroes faltered,<br> And the strongest women weakened.</p> 
 <p>"Thus did I, a youthful housewife,<br> At the right time, all my duties,<br> Drenched myself in perspiration,<br> Hoped for better times to follow;<br> But I only rose to labor,<br> Knowing neither rest nor pleasure.<br> I was blamed by all the household,<br> With ungrateful tongues derided,<br> Now about my awkward manners,<br> Now about my reputation,<br> Censuring my name and station.<br> Words unkind were heaped upon me,<br> Fell like hail on me unhappy,<br> Like the frightful flash of lightning,<br> Like the heavy hail of spring-time.<br> I did not despair entirely,<br> Would have lived to labor longer<br> Underneath the tongue of malice,<br> But the old-one spoiled Lay temper,<br> Roused my deepest ire and hatred<br> Then my husband grew a wild-bear,<br> Grew a savage wolf of Hisi.</p> 
 <p>"Only then I turned to weeping,<br> And reflected in my chamber,<br> Thought of all my former pleasures<br> Of the happy days of childhood,<br> Of my father's joyful firesides,<br> Of my mother's peaceful cottage,<br> Then began I thus to murmur:<br> 'Well thou knowest, ancient mother,<br> How to make thy sweet bud blossom,<br> How to train thy tender shootlet;<br> Did not know where to ingraft it,<br> Placed, alas! the little scion<br> In the very worst of places,<br> On an unproductive hillock,<br> In the hardest limb of cherry,<br> Where it could not grow and flourish,<br> There to waste its life, in weeping,<br> Hapless in her lasting sorrow.<br> Worthier had been my conduct<br> In the regions that are better,<br> In the court-yards that are wider,<br> In compartments that are larger,<br> Living with a loving husband,<br> Living with a stronger hero.<br> Shoe of birch-bark was my suitor,<br> Shoe of Laplanders, my husband;<br> Had the body of a raven,<br> Voice and visage like the jackdaw,<br> Mouth and claws were from the black-wolf,<br> The remainder from the wild-bear.<br> Had I known that mine affianced<br> Was a fount of pain and evil,<br> To the hill-side I had wandered,<br> Been a pine-tree on the highway,<br> Been a linden on the border,<br> Like the black-earth made my visage,<br> Grown a beard of ugly bristles,<br> Head of loam and eyes of lightning,<br> For my ears the knots of birches,<br> For my limbs the trunks of aspens.'</p> 
 <p>"This the manner of my singing<br> In the hearing of my husband,<br> Thus I sang my cares and murmurs<br> Thus my hero near the portals<br> Heard the wail of my displeasure,<br> Then he hastened to my chamber;<br> Straightway knew I by his footsteps,<br> Well concluded be was angry,<br> 'Knew it by his steps implanted;<br> All the winds were still in slumber,<br> Yet his sable locks stood endwise,<br> Fluttered round his bead in fury,<br> While his horrid mouth stood open;<br> To and fro his eyes were rolling,<br> In one hand a branch of willow,<br> In the other, club of alder;<br> Struck at me with might of malice,<br> Aimed the cudgel at my forehead.</p> 
 <p>"When the evening had descended,<br> When my husband thought of slumber<br> Took he in his hand a whip-stalk,<br> With a whip-lash made of deer-skin,<br> Was not made for any other,<br> Only made for me unhappy.</p> 
 <p>"When at last I begged for mercy,<br> When I sought a place for resting,<br> By his side I courted slumber,<br> Merciless, my husband seized me,<br> Struck me with his arm of envy,<br> Beat me with the whip of torture,<br> Deer-skin-lash and stalk of birch-wood.<br> From his couch I leaped impulsive,<br> In the coldest night of winter,<br> But the husband fleetly followed,<br> Caught me at the outer portals,<br> Grasped me by my streaming tresses,<br> Tore my ringlets from my forehead,<br> Cast in curls upon the night-winds<br> To the freezing winds of winter.<br> What the aid that I could ask for,<br> Who could free me from my torment?<br> Made I shoes of magic metals,<br> Made the straps of steel and copper,<br> Waited long without the dwelling,<br> Long I listened at the portals,<br> Hoping he would end his ravings,<br> Hoping he would sink to slumber,<br> But he did not seek for resting,<br> Did not wish to still his fury.<br> Finally the cold benumbed me;<br> As an outcast from his cabin,<br> I was forced to walk and wander,<br> When I, freezing, well reflected,<br> This the substance of my thinking:<br> 'I will not endure this torture,<br> Will not bear this thing forever,<br> Will not bear this cruel treatment,<br> Such contempt I will not suffer<br> In the wicked tribe of Hisi,<br> In this nest of evil Piru.'</p> 
 <p>"Then I said, 'Farewell forever!'<br> To my husband's home and kindred,<br> To my much-loved home and husband;<br> Started forth upon a journey<br> To my father's distant hamlet,<br> Over swamps and over snow-fields,<br> Wandered over towering mountains,<br> Over hills and through the valleys,<br> To my brother's welcome meadows,<br> To my sister's home and birthplace.</p> 
 <p>"There were rustling withered pine-trees.<br> Finely-feathered firs were fading,<br> Countless ravens there were cawing,<br> All the jackdaws harshly singing,<br> This the chorus of the ravens:<br> 'Thou hast here a home no longer,<br> This is not the happy homestead<br> Of thy merry days of childhood.'</p> 
 <p>"Heeding not this woodland chorus,<br> Straight I journeyed to the dwelling<br> Of my childhood's friend and brother,<br> Where the portals spake in concord,<br> And the hills and valleys answered,<br> This their saddened song and echo:<br> 'Wherefore dost thou journey hither,<br> Comest thou for joy or sorrow,<br> To thy father's old dominions?<br> Here unhappiness awaits thee,<br> Long departed is thy father,<br> Dead and gone to visit Ukko,<br> Dead and gone thy faithful mother,<br> And thy brother is a stranger,<br> While his wife is chill and heartless!'</p> 
 <p>"Heeding not these many warnings,<br> Straightway to my brother's cottage<br> Were my weary feet directed,<br> Laid my hand upon the door-latch<br> Of my brother's dismal cottage,<br> But the latch was cold and lifeless.<br> When I wandered to the chamber,<br> When I waited at the doorway,<br> There I saw the heartless hostess,<br> But she did not give me greeting,<br> Did not give her hand in welcome;<br> Proud, alas! was I unhappy,<br> Did not make the first advances,<br> Did not offer her my friendship,<br> And my hand I did not proffer;<br> Laid my hand upon the oven,<br> All its former warmth departed!<br> On the coal I laid my fingers,<br> All the latent heat had left it.<br> On the rest-bench lay my brother,<br> Lay outstretched before the fire-place,<br> Heaps of soot upon his shoulders,<br> Heaps of ashes on his forehead.<br> Thus the brother asked the stranger,<br> Questioned thus his guest politely:<br> 'Tell me what thy name and station,<br> Whence thou comest o'er the waters!'<br> This the answer that I gave him:<br> Hast thou then forgot thy sister,<br> Does my brother not remember,<br> Not recall his mother's daughter<br> We are children of one mother,<br> Of one bird were we the fledgelings,<br> In one nest were hatched and nurtured.'</p> 
 <p>"Then the brother fell to weeping,<br> From his eyes great tear-drops flowing,<br> To his wife the brother whispered,<br> Whispered thus unto the housewife.<br> 'Bring thou beer to give my sister,<br> Quench her thirst and cheer her spirits.'</p> 
 <p>"Full of envy, brought the sister<br> Only water filled with evil,<br> Water for the infant's eyelids,<br> Soap and water from the bath-room.</p> 
 <p>"To his wife the brother whispered,<br> Whispered thus unto the housewife:<br> 'Bring thou salmon for my sister,<br> For my sister so long absent,<br> Thus to still her pangs of hunger.'</p> 
 <p>"Thereupon the wife obeying,<br> Brought, in envy, only cabbage<br> That the children had been eating,<br> And the house-dogs had been licking,<br> Leavings of the black-dog's breakfast.</p> 
 <p>"Then I left my brother's dwelling,<br> Hastened to the ancient homestead,<br> To my mother's home deserted;<br> Onward, onward did I wander,<br> Hastened onward by the cold-sea,<br> Dragged my body on in anguish,<br> To the cottage-doors of strangers,<br> To the unfamiliar portals,<br> For the care of the neglected,<br> For the needy of the village,<br> For the children poor and orphaned.</p> 
 <p>"There are many wicked people,<br> Many slanderers of women,<br> Many women evil-minded,<br> That malign their sex through envy.<br> Many they with lips of evil,<br> That belie the best of maidens,<br> Prove the innocent are guilty<br> Of the worst of misdemeanors,<br> Speak aloud in tones unceasing,<br> Speak, alas! with wicked motives,<br> Spread the follies of their neighbors<br> Through the tongues of self-pollution.<br> Very few, indeed, the people<br> That will feed the poor and hungry,<br> That will bid the stranger welcome;<br> Very few to treat her kindly,<br> Innocent, and lone, and needy,<br> Few to offer her a shelter<br> From the chilling storms of winter,<br> When her skirts with ice are stiffened,<br> Coats of ice her only raiment!</p> 
 <p>"Never in my days of childhood,<br> Never in my maiden life-time,<br> Never would believe the story<br> Though a hundred tongues had told<br> Though a thousand voices sang it,<br> That such evil things could happen,<br> That such misery could follow,<br> Such misfortune could befall one<br> Who has tried to do her duty,<br> Who has tried to live uprightly,<br> Tried to make her people happy."</p> 
 <p>Thus the young bride was instructed,<br> Beauteous Maiden of the Rainbow,<br> Thus by Osmotar, the teacher.</p>
