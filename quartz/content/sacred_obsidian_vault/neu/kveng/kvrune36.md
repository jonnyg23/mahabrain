 <p>KULLERWOINE.N, wicked wizard,<br> In his purple-colored stockings,<br> Now prepares himself for battle;<br> Grinds a long time on his broadsword,<br> Sharpens well his trusty weapon,<br> And his mother speaks as follows:<br> "Do not go, my son beloved,<br> Go not to the wars, my hero,<br> Struggle not with hostile spearsmen.<br> Whoso goes to war for nothing,<br> Undertakes a fearful combat,<br> Undertakes a fatal issue;<br> Those that war without a reason<br> Will be slaughtered for their folly,<br> Easy prey to bows and arrows.<br> Go thou with a goat to battle,<br> Shouldst thou go to fight the roebuck,<br> 'Tis the goat that will be vanquished,<br> And the roebuck will be slaughtered;<br> With a frog thou'lt journey homeward,<br> Victor, with but little honor!"<br> These the words of Kullerwoinen:<br> "Shall not journey through the marshes,<br> Shall not sink upon the heather,<br> On the home-land of the raven,<br> Where the eagles scream at day-break.<br> When I yield my life forever,<br> Bravely will I fall in battle,<br> Fall upon the field of glory,<br> Beautiful to die in armor,<br> And the clang and clash of armies,<br> Beautiful the strife for conquest!<br> Thus Kullervo soon will hasten<br> To the kingdom of Tuoni,<br> To the realm of the departed,<br> Undeformed by wasting sickness."<br> This the answer of the mother:<br> "If thou diest in the conflict,<br> Who will stay to guard thy father,<br> Who will give thy sire protection?"<br> These the words of Kullerwoinen:<br> "Let him die upon the court-yard,<br> Sleeping out his life of sorrow!"</p> 
 <p>"Who then will protect thy mother,<br> Be her shield in times of danger?"</p> 
 <p>"Let her die within the stable,<br> Or the cabin where she lingers!"</p> 
 <p>"Who then will defend thy brother,<br> Give him aid in times of trouble?"</p> 
 <p>"Let him die within the forest,<br> Sleep his life away unheeded!"</p> 
 <p>"Who will comfort then thy sister,<br> Who will aid her in affliction?"</p> 
 <p>"Let her sink beneath the waters,<br> Perish in the crystal fountain,<br> Where the brook flows on in beauty,<br> Like a silver serpent winding<br> Through the valley to the ocean!"</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the wild Kullervo<br> Hastens from his home to battle,<br> To his father speaks, departing:<br> "Fare thou well, my aged father!<br> Wilt thou weep for me, thy hero,<br> When thou hearest I have perished,<br> Fallen from thy tribe forever,<br> Perished on the field of glory?"<br> Thus the father speaks in answer:<br> "I shall never mourn the downfall<br> Of my evil son, Kullervo;<br> Shall not weep when thou hast perished;<br> Shall beget a second hero<br> That will do me better service,<br> That will think and act in wisdom."<br> Kullerwoinen gives this answer:<br> "Neither shall I mourn thy downfall,<br> Shall not weep when thou hast perished;<br> I shall make a second father,<br> Make the head from loam and sandstone,<br> Make the eyes from swamp-land berries,<br> Make the beard from withered sea-grass,<br> Make the feet from roots of willow,<br> Make the form from birch-wood fungus."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the youth, Kullervo,<br> To his brother speaks as follows:<br> "Fare thou well, beloved brother!<br> Wilt thou weep for me departed,<br> Shouldst thou hear that I have perished,<br> Fallen on the field of battle?"<br> This the answer of the brother:<br> "I shall never mourn the downfall<br> Of my brother, Kullerwoinen,<br> Shall not weep when thou hast perished;<br> I shall find a second brother '<br> Find one worthier and wiser!"<br> This is Kullerwoinen's answer:<br> "Neither shall I mourn thy downfall,<br> Shall not weep when thou hast perished;<br> I shall form a second brother,<br> Make the head from dust and ashes,<br> Make the eyes from pearls of ocean,<br> Make the beard from withered verdure,<br> Make the form from pulp of birch-wood."<br> To his sister speaks Kullervo:<br> "Fare thou well, beloved sister!<br> Surely thou wilt mourn my downfall,<br> Weep for me when I have perished,<br> When thou hearest I have fallen<br> In the heat and din of battle,<br> Fallen from thy race forever!"<br> But the sister makes this answer:<br> "Never shall I mourn thy downfall,<br> Shall not weep when thou hast perished;<br> I shall seek a second brother,<br> Seek a brother, purer, better,<br> One that will not shame his sister!"<br> Kullerwoinen thus makes answer:<br> "Neither shall I mourn thee fallen,<br> Shall not weep when thou hast perished;<br> I shall form a second sister,<br> Make the head from whitened marble,<br> Make the eyes from golden moonbeams,<br> Make the tresses from the rainbow,<br> Make the ears from ocean-flowers,<br> And her form from gold and silver.</p> 
 <p>"Fare thou well, beloved mother,<br> Mother, beautiful and faithful!<br> Wilt thou weep when I have perished,<br> Fallen on the field of glory,<br> Fallen from thy race forever?"<br> Thus the mother speaks in answer:<br> "Canst not fathom love maternal,<br> Canst not smother her affection;<br> Bitterly I'll mourn thy downfall,<br> I would weep if thou shouldst perish,<br> Shouldst thou leave my race forever;<br> I would weep in court or cabin,<br> Sprinkle all these fields with tear-drops,<br> Weep great rivers to the ocean,<br> Weep to melt the snows of Northland,<br> Make the hillocks green with weeping,<br> Weep at morning, weep at evening,<br> Weep three years in bitter sorrow<br> O'er the death of Kullerwoinen!"</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the wicked wizard<br> Went rejoicing to the combat;<br> In delight to war he hastened<br> O'er the fields, and fens, and fallows,<br> Shouting loudly on the heather,<br> Singing o'er the hills and mountains,<br> Rushing through the glens and forests,<br> Blowing war upon his bugle.</p> 
 <p>Time had gone but little distance,<br> When a messenger appearing,<br> Spake these words to Kullerwoinen:<br> "Lo! thine aged sire has perished,<br> Fallen from thy race forever;<br> Hasten home and do him honor,<br> Lay him in the lap of Kalma."<br> Kullerwoinen inade this answer:<br> "Has my aged father perished,<br> There is home a sable stallion<br> That will take him to his slumber,<br> Lay him in the lap of Kalma."</p> 
 <p>Then Kullervo journeyed onward,<br> Calling war upon his bugle,<br> Till a messenger appearing,<br> Brought this word to Kullerwoinen:<br> "Lo! thy brother too has perished,<br> Dead he lies within the forest,<br> Manalainen's trumpet called him;<br> Home return and do him honor,<br> Lay him in the lap of Kalma."<br> Kullerwoinen thus replying:<br> "Has my hero-brother perished,<br> There is home a sable stallion<br> That will take him' to his slumber,<br> Lay him in the lap of Kalma."</p> 
 <p>Young Kullervo journeyed onward<br> Over vale and over mountain,<br> Playing on his reed of battle,<br> Till a messenger appearing<br> Brought the warrior these tidings:<br> "Lo! thy sister too has perished,<br> Perished in the crystal fountain,<br> Where the waters flow in beauty,<br> Like a silver serpent winding<br> Through the valley to the ocean;<br> Home return and do her honor,<br> Lay her in the lap of Kalma."<br> These the words of Kullerwoinen:<br> "Has my beauteous sister perished,<br> Fallen from my race forever,<br> There is home a sable filly<br> That will take her to her resting,<br> Lay her in the lap of Kalma."</p> 
 <p>Still Kullervo journeyed onward,<br> Through the fens he went rejoicing,<br> Sounding war upon his bugle,<br> Till a messenger appearing<br> Brought to him these words of sorrow:<br> "Lo! thy mother too has perished,<br> Died in anguish, broken-hearted;<br> Home return and do her honor,<br> Lay her in the lap of Kalma."<br> These the measures of Kullervo:<br> "Woe is me, my life hard-fated,<br> That my mother too has perished,<br> She that nursed me in my cradle,<br> Made my couch a golden cover,<br> Twirled for me the spool and spindle!<br> Lo! Kullervo was not present<br> When his mother's life departed;<br> May have died upon the mountains,<br> Perished there from cold and hunger.<br> Lave the dead form of my mother<br> In the crystal waters flowing;<br> Wrap her in the robes of ermine,<br> Tie her hands with silken ribbon,<br> Take her to the grave of ages,<br> Lay her in the lap of Kalma.<br> Bury her with songs of mourning,<br> Let the singers chant my sorrow;<br> Cannot leave the fields of battle<br> While Untamo goes unpunished,<br> Fell destroyer of my people."</p> 
 <p>Kullerwoinen journeyed onward,<br> Still rejoicing, to the combat,<br> Sang these songs in supplication:<br> "Ukko, mightiest of rulers,<br> Loan to me thy sword of battle,<br> Grant to me thy matchless weapon,<br> And against a thousand armies<br> I will war and ever conquer."</p> 
 <p>Ukko, gave the youth his broadsword,<br> Gave his blade of magic powers<br> To the wizard, Kullerwoinen.<br> Thus equipped, the mighty hero<br> Slew the people of Untamo,<br> Burned their villages to ashes;<br> Only left the stones and ovens,<br> And the chimneys of their hamlets.</p> 
 <p>Then the conqueror, Kullervo,<br> Turned his footsteps to his home-land,<br> To the cabin of his father '<br> To his ancient fields and forests.<br> Empty did he find the cabin,<br> And the forests were deserted;<br> No one came to give him greeting,<br> None to give the hand of welcome;<br> Laid his fingers on the oven,<br> But he found it cold and lifeless;<br> Then he knew to satisfaction<br> That his mother lived no longer;<br> Laid his hand upon the fire-place,<br> Cold and lifeless were the hearth-stones;<br> Then he knew to satisfaction<br> That his sister too had perished;<br> Then he sought the landing-places,<br> Found no boats upon the rollers;<br> Then he knew to satisfaction<br> That his brother too had perished;<br> Then he looked upon the fish-nets,<br> And he found them torn and tangled;<br> And he knew to satisfaction<br> That his father too had perished.</p> 
 <p>Bitterly he wept and murmured,<br> Wept one day, and then a second,<br> On the third day spake as follows:<br> "Faithful mother, fond and tender,<br> Why hast left me here to sorrow<br> In this wilderness of trouble?<br> But thou dost not hear my calling,<br> Though I sing in magic accents,<br> Though my tear-drops speak lamenting,<br> Though my heart bemoans thine absence.</p> 
 <p>From her grave awakes the mother,<br> To Kullervo speaks these measures:<br> "Thou has still the dog remaining,<br> He will lead thee to the forest;<br> Follow thou the faithful watcher,<br> Let him lead thee to the woodlands,<br> To the farthest woodland border,<br> To the caverns of the wood-nymphs;<br> Kullerwoinen's Victory and Death<br> There the forest maidens linger,<br> They will give thee food and shelter,<br> Give my hero joyful greetings."</p> 
 <p>Kullerwoinen, with his watch-dog,<br> Hastens onward through the forest,<br> Journeys on through fields and fallows;<br> Journeys but a little distance,<br> Till be comes upon the summit<br> Where he met his long-lost sister;<br> Finds the turf itself is weeping,<br> Finds the glen-wood filled with sorrow,<br> Finds the heather shedding tear-drops,<br> Weeping are the meadow-flowers,<br> O'er the ruin of his sister.</p> 
 <p>Kullerwoinen, wicked wizard,<br> Grasps the handle of his broadsword,<br> Asks the blade this simple question:<br> "Tell me, O my blade of honor,<br> Dost thou wish to drink my life-blood,<br> Drink the blood of Kullerwoinen?"</p> 
 <p>Thus his trusty sword makes answer,<br> Well divining his intentions:<br> Why should I not drink thy life-blood,<br> Blood of guilty Kullerwoinen,<br> Since I feast upon the worthy,<br> Drink the life-blood of the righteous?"</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the youth, Kullervo,<br> Wicked wizard of the Northland,<br> Lifts the mighty sword of Ukko,<br> Bids adieu to earth and heaven;<br> Firmly thrusts the hilt in heather,<br> To his heart he points the weapon,<br> Throws his weight upon his broadsword,<br> Pouring out his wicked life-blood,<br> Ere be journeys to Manala.<br> Thus the wizard finds destruction,<br> This the end of Kullerwoinen,<br> Born in sin, and nursed in folly.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> As he hears the joyful tidings,<br> Learns the death of fell Kullervo,<br> Speaks these words of ancient wisdom:<br> "O, ye many unborn nations,<br> Never evil nurse your children,<br> Never give them out to strangers,<br> Never trust them to the foolish!<br> If the child is not well nurtured,<br> Is not rocked and led uprightly,<br> Though he grow to years of manhood,<br> Bear a strong and shapely body,<br> He will never know discretion,<br> Never eat. the bread of honor,<br> Never drink the cup of wisdom."</p>
