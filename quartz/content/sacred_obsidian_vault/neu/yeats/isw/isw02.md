 <h3 align="CENTER">THE OLD AGE OF QUEEN MAEVE.</h3>
 <p>Maeve the great queen was pacing to and fro,<br>
 Between the walls covered with beaten bronze,<br>
 In her high house at Cruachan; the long hearth,<br>
 Flickering with ash and hazel, but half showed<br>
 Where the tired horse-boys lay upon the rushes,<br>
 Or on the benches underneath the walls,<br>
 In comfortable sleep; all living slept<br>
 But that great queen, who more than half the night<br>
 Had paced from door to fire and fire to door.<br>
 Though now in her old age, in her young age<br>
 She had been beautiful in that old way<br>
 That's all but gone; for the proud heart is gone<br>
 And the fool heart of the counting-house fears all<br>
 But soft beauty and indolent desire.<br>
 She could have called over the rim of the world<br>
 Whatever woman's lover had hit her fancy,<br>
 And yet had been great bodied and great limbed,<br>
 Fashioned to be the mother of strong children;<br>
 And she'd had lucky eyes and a high heart,<br>
 And wisdom that caught fire like the dried flax, <a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 3</font></a><br>
 At need, and made her beautiful and fierce,<br>
 Sudden and laughing.<br>
                           O unquiet heart,<br>
 Why do you praise another, praising her,<br>
 As if there were no tale but your own tale<br>
 Worth knitting to a measure of sweet sound?<br>
 Have I not bid you tell of that great queen<br>
 Who has been buried some two thousand years?</p>
 <p>When night was at its deepest, a wild goose<br>
 Cried from the porter's lodge, and with long clamour<br>
 Shook the ale horns and shields upon their hooks;<br>
 But the horse-boys slept on, as though some power<br>
 Had filled the house with Druid heaviness;<br>
 And wondering who of the many changing Sidhe<br>
 Had come as in the old times to counsel her.,<br>
 Maeve walked, yet with slow footfall being old,<br>
 To that small chamber by the outer gate.<br>
 The porter slept although he sat upright<br>
 With still and stony limbs and open eyes.<br>
 Maeve waited, and when that ear-piercing noise <a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 4</font></a><br>
 Broke from his parted lips and broke again,<br>
 She laid a hand on either of his shoulders,<br>
 And shook him wide awake, and bid him say<br>
 Who of the wandering many-changing ones<br>
 Had troubled his sleep. But all he had to say<br>
 Was that, the air being heavy and the dogs<br>
 More still than they had been for a good month,<br>
 He had fallen asleep, and, though he had dreamed nothing,<br>
 He could remember when he had had fine dreams.<br>
 It was before the time of the great war<br>
 Over the White-Horned Bull, and the Brown Bull.</p>
 <p>She turned away; he turned again to sleep<br>
 That no god troubled now, and, wondering<br>
 What matters were afoot among the Sidhe,<br>
 Maeve walked through that great hall, and with a sigh<br>
 Lifted the curtain of her sleeping room,<br>
 Remembering that she too had seemed divine<br>
 To many thousand eyes, and to her own <a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a><br>
 One that the generations had long-waited<br>
 That work too difficult for mortal hands<br>
 Might be accomplished. Bunching the curtain up<br>
 She saw her husband Ailell sleeping there,<br>
 And thought of days when he'd had a straight body,<br>
 And of that famous Fergus, Nessa's husband,<br>
 Who had been the lover of her middle life.</p>
 <p>Suddenly Ailell spoke out of his sleep,<br>
 And not with his own voice or a man's voice,<br>
 But with the burning, live, unshaken voice<br>
 Of those that it may be can never age.<br>
 He said, 'High Queen of Cruachan and Mag Ai<br>
 A king of the Great Plain would speak with you.'<br>
 And with glad voice Maeve answered him, 'What King<br>
 Of the far wandering shadows has come to me?<br>
 As in the old days when they would come and go<br>
 About my threshold to counsel and to help.'<br>
 The parted lips replied, 'I seek your help,<br>
 For I am Aengus and I am crossed in love.' <a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 6</font></a><br>
 'How may a mortal whose life gutters out<br>
 Help them that wander with hand clasping hand<br>
 By rivers where nor rain nor hail has dimmed<br>
 Their haughty images, that cannot fade<br>
 Although their beauty's like a hollow dream.'</p>
 <p>'I come from the undimmed rivers to bid you call<br>
 The children of the Maines out of sleep,<br>
 And set them digging into Anbual's hill.<br>
 We shadows, while they uproot his earthy house,<br>
 Will overthrow his shadows and carry off<br>
 Caer, his blue eyed daughter that I love.<br>
 I helped your fathers when they built these walls<br>
 And I would have your help in my great need,<br>
 Queen of high Cruachan.'<br>
                               'I obey your will<br>
 With speedy feet and a most thankful heart:<br>
 For you have been, O Aengus of the birds,<br>
 Our giver of good counsel and good luck.'<br>
 And with a groan, as if the mortal breath<br>
 Could but awaken sadly upon lips <a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 7</font></a><br>
 That happier breath had moved, her husband turned<br>
 Face downward, tossing in a troubled sleep;<br>
 But Maeve, and not with a slow feeble foot,<br>
 Came to the threshold of the painted house,<br>
 Where her grandchildren slept, and cried aloud,<br>
 Until the pillared dark began to stir<br>
 With shouting and the clang of unhooked arms.</p>
 <p>She told them of the many-changing ones;<br>
 And all that night, and all through the next day<br>
 To middle night, they dug into the hill.<br>
 At middle night great cats with silver claws,<br>
 Bodies of shadow and blind eyes like pearls,<br>
 Came up out of the hole, and red-eared hounds<br>
 With long white bodies came out of the air<br>
 Suddenly, and ran at them and harried them.</p>
 <p>The Maines' children dropped their spades, and stood<br>
 With quaking joints and terror strucken faces,<br>
 Till Maeve called out, 'These are but common men. <a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 8</font></a><br>
 The Maines' children have not dropped their spades<br>
 Because Earth crazy for its broken power<br>
 Casts up a show and the winds answer it<br>
 With holy shadows.' Her high heart was glad,<br>
 And when the uproar ran along the grass<br>
 She followed with light footfall in the midst,<br>
 Till it died out where an old thorn tree stood.</p>
 <p>Friend of these many years, you too had stood<br>
 With equal courage in that whirling rout;<br>
 For you, although you've not her wandering heart,<br>
 Have all that greatness, and not hers alone.<br>
 For there is no high story about queens<br>
 In any ancient book but tells of you,<br>
 And when I've heard how they grew old and died<br>
 Or fell into unhappiness I've said;<br>
 'She will grow old and die and she has wept!'<br>
 And when I'd write it out anew, the words,<br>
 Half crazy with the thought, She too has wept!<br>
 Outrun the measure. <a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 9</font></a><br>
                          I'd tell of that great queen<br>
 Who stood amid a silence by the thorn<br>
 Until two lovers came out of the air<br>
 With bodies made out of soft fire. The one<br>
 About whose face birds wagged their fiery wings<br>
 Said, 'Aengus and his sweetheart give their thanks<br>
 To Maeve and to Maeve's household, owing all<br>
 In owing them the bride-bed that gives peace.'<br>
 Then Maeve, 'O Aengus, Master of all lovers,<br>
 A thousand years ago you held high talk<br>
 With the first kings of many pillared Cruachan.<br>
 O when will you grow weary.'<br>
                               They had vanished,<br>
 But out of the dark air over her head there came<br>
 A murmur of soft words and meeting lips.</p>
