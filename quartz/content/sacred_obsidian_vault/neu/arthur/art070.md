SCENE I.</b>  <br> SCENE <i> The Palace.</i> <br>  <i> Mr. </i> Doodle, <i> Mr. </i> Noodle.<br>  <br>  <b> DOODLE</b> .  Sure, such a Day as this was never seen! <br> The Sun himself, on this auspicious Day <br> Shines like a Beau in a new Birth-Day Suit: <br> All Nature, O my <i> Noodle!</i>  grins for Joy. <br> <b> NOODLE</b> .  This Day, O Mr. <i> Doodle</i> !  is a Day <br> Indeed, a Day we never saw before. <br> The mighty <i> Thomas Thumb</i>  victorious comes; <br> Millions of Giants crowd his Chariot Wheels, <br> Who bite their Chains, and frown and foam like Mad-Dogs. <br> He rides, regardless of their ugly Looks. <br> So some Cock-Sparrow in a Farmer's Yard, <br> Hops at the Head of an huge Flock of Turkeys. <br> <b> DOODLE. </b>  When Goody <i> Thumb</i>  first brought this <i> Thomas</i>  forth, <br> The <i> Genius</i>  of our Land triumphant reign'd; <br> Then, then, O <i> Arthur</i> ! did thy <i> Genius</i>  reign. <br> <b> NOODLE</b> .  They tell me, it is whisper'd in the Books <br> Of all our Sages, That this mighty Hero <br> (By <i> Merlin's</i>  Art begot) has not a Bone <br> Within his Skin, but is a Lump of Gristle. <br> <b> DOODLE.</b>   Wou'd <i> Arthur's </i> Subjects were such Gristle, all! <br> He then might break the Bones of ev'ry Foe. <br> <b> NOODLE.</b>   But hark! these Trumpets speak the King's Approach. <br> <b> DOODLE.</b>   He comes most luckily for my Petition! <br>  Let us retire a little.<br>  <br>  <br> <b> SCENE II.</b>  <br> King, Queen, <i> Lord</i>  Grizzle, Doodle, Noodle.<br>  <br>  <b> KING</b> .  Let nothing but a Face of Joy appear; <br> The Man who frowns this Day, shall lose his Head, <br> That he may have no Face to frown again. <br> Smile, <i> Dollalolla;</i> -Ha! what wrinkled Sorrow <br> Sits, like some <i> Mother Demdike</i> , on thy Brow? <br> Whence flow those Tears fast down thy blubber'd Cheeks, <br> Like a swoln Gutter, gushing through the Streets? <br> <b> QUEEN.</b>   Excess of Joy, my Lord, I've heard Folks say, <br> Gives Tears, as often as Excess of Grief. <br> <b> KING.</b>   If it be so, let all Men cry for Joy, <br> 'Till my whole Court be drowned with their Tears; <br> Nay, 'till they overflow my utmost Land, <br> And leave me nothing but the Sea to rule. <br> <b> DOODLE.</b>   My Liege! I've a Petition- <br> <b> KING.</b>   Petition me no Petitions, Sir, to-day; <br> Let other Hours be set apart for Bus'ness. <br> To-day it is our Pleasure to be drunk, <br> And this our Queen shall be as drunk as us. <br> <b> QUEEN.</b>   If the capacious Goblet overflow <br> With <i> Arrack-Punch</i> -'fore <i> George</i> !  I'll see it out; <br> Of <i> Rum</i> , or <i> Brandy</i> , I'll not taste a Drop. <br> <b> KING.</b>   Tho' <i> Rack</i> , in <i> Punch</i> , Eight Shillings be a Quart, <br> And <i> Rum </i> and <i> Brandy </i> be no more than Six, <br> Rather than quarrel, you shall have your Will.<br>            [<i> Trumpets. <br> </i> But, ha! the Warrior comes; <i> Tom Thumb</i>  approaches; <br> The welcome Hero, Giant-killing Lad, <br> Preserver of my Kingdom, is arrived. <br>  <br>  <br> <b> SCENE III.</b>  <br> Tom Thumb, <i> attended; </i> King, Queen, <i> Lord</i>  Grizzle, Doodle, Noodle.<br>  <br>  <b> KING.</b>   O welcome, ever welcome to my Arms, <br> My dear <i> Tom Thumb</i> ! How shall I thank thy Merit? <br> <b> THUMB.</b>   By not b'ing thank'd at all, I'm thank'd enough; <br> My Duty I have done, and done no more. <br> <b> QUEEN.</b>   Was ever such a lovely Creature seen!    [<i> Aside.</i>  <br> <b> KING.</b>    Thy Modesty's a Candle to thy Merit, <br> It shines itself, and shews thy Merit too. <br> Vain Impudence, if it be ever found <br> With Virtue, like the Trumpet in a Consort, <br> Drowns the sweet Musick of the softer Flute. <br> But say, my Boy, where didst thou leave the Giants? <br> <b> THUMB.</b>   My Liege, without the Castle Gates they stand, <br> The Castle Gates too low for their Admittance. <br> <b> KING.</b>   What look they like? <br> <b> THUMB.</b>   Like twenty Things, my Liege; <br> Like twenty thousand Oaks, by Winter's Hand <br> Stripp'd of their Blossoms; like a Range of Houses, <br> When Fire has burnt their Timber all away. <br> <b> KING.</b>   Enough: The vast Idea fills my Soul; <br> I see them, yes, I see them now before me. <br> The monst'rous, ugly, barb'rous Sons of Whores, <br> Which, like as many rav'nous Wolves, of late <br> Frown'd grimly o'er the Land, like Lambs look now. <br> O <i> Thumb</i> , what do we to thy Valour owe! <br> The Princess <i> Huncamunca</i>  is thy Prize. <br> <b> QUEEN.</b>   Ha! Be still, my Soul! <br> <b> THUMB.</b>   Oh, happy, happy Hearing! <br> Witness, ye Stars! cou'd <i> Thumb</i>  have ever set <br> A Bound to his Ambition - it had been <br> The Princess <i> Huncamunca,</i>  in whose Arms <br> Eternity would seem but half an Hour. <br> <b> QUEEN.</b>   Consider, Sir, reward your Soldier's Merit, <br> But give not <i> Huncamunca </i> to <i> Tom Thumb.</i>  <br> <b> KING.</b>   <i> Tom Thumb! </i> Odzooks, my wide extended Realm <br> Knows not a Name so glorious as <i> Tom Thumb. <br> </i> Not <i> Alexander</i> , in his highest Pride, <br> Could boast of Merits greater than <i> Tom Thumb. <br> </i> Not <i> Caesar, Scipio</i> , all the Flow'rs of <i> Rome</i> , <br> Deserv'd their Triumphs better than <i> Tom Thumb. <br> </i> <b> QUEEN.</b>   Tho' greater yet his boasted Merit was, <br>  He shall not have the Pricess, that is Pos'. <br> <b> KING.</b>   Say you so, Madam? We will have a Trial. <br> When I consent, what Pow'r has your Denial? <br> For when the Wife her Husband over-reaches, <br> Give him the Petticoat, and her the Breeches. <br> <b> NOODLE.</b>   Long Health and Happiness attend the General! <br> Long may he live, as now, the publick Joy, <br> While ev'ry Voice is burthen'd with his Praise. <br> <b> THUMB.</b>   Whisper, ye Winds! that <i> Huncamunca's</i>  mine; <br> Ecchoes repeat; that <i> Huncamunca's</i>  mine! <br> The dreadful Bus'ness of the War is over, <br> And Beauty, heav'nly Beauty! crowns the Toil. <br> I've thrown the bloody Garment now aside, <br> And <i> Hymeneal</i>  Sweets invite my Bride. <br> So when some Chimney-Sweeper, all the Day, <br> Has through dark Paths pursu'd the sooty Way, <br> At Night, to wash his Face and Hands he flies, <br> And in his t'other Shirt with his <i> Brickdusta</i>  lies. <br>           [<i> Exeunt all but </i> Grizzle. <br>  <br>  <br> <b> SCENE IV.</b>  <br> <i> Lord </i> Grizzle, <i> Solus.<br>  <br>  </i> <b> GRIZZLE.</b>   See how the cringing Coxcombs fawn upon him! <br> The Sun-shine of a Court can, in a Day, <br> Ripen the vilest Insect to an Eagle: <br> And every little Wretch, who but an Hour <br> Before had scorn'd, and trod him under Feet, <br> Shall lift his Eyes aloft, to gaze at distance, <br> And flatter what they scorn'd. <br>  <br>  <br> <b> SCENE V.</b>  <br> <i> Enter</i>  Queen,  <i> to Lord </i> Grizzle.<br>  <br>  <b> QUEEN.</b>   Well met, My Lord, <br> You are the Man I sought.  Have you not heard <br> (What ev'ry Corner of the Court resounds) <br> That little <i> Thumb</i>  will be a great Man made. <br> <b> GRIZZLE.</b>   I heard it, I confess - for who, alas! <br> Can always stop his Ears - but would my Teeth, <br> By grinding Knives, had first been set on Edge. <br> <b> QUEEN.</b>   Would I had heard at the still Noon of Night <br> The dreadful Cry of Fire in ev'ry Street! <br> Odsbobs! I could almost destroy myself, <br> To think I should a Grand-mother be made <br> By such a Rascal. - Sure, the King forgets, <br> When in a Pudding, by his Mother put, <br> The Bastard, by a Tinker, on a Stall <br> Was dropp'd. - O, good Lord <i> Grizzle</i> ! can I bear <br> To see him, from a Pudding, mount the Throne? <br> <b> GRIZZLE.</b>   Oh Horror! Horror! Horror! cease my Queen, <br> Thy Voice, like twenty Screech-Owls, wracks my Brain. <br> <b> QUEEN.</b>   Then rouze thy Spirit - we may yet prevent <br> This hated Match.- <br> <b> GRIZZLE.</b>   We will. - Not Fate, itself, <br> Should it conspire with <i> Thomas Thumb,</i>  should cause it. <br> I'll swim through Seas; I'll ride upon the Clouds; <br> I'll dig the Earth; I'll blow out ev'ry Fire; <br> I'll rave; I'll rant; I'll rush; I'll rise; I'll roar <br> Fierce as the Man whom smiling Dolphins bore, <br> From the Prosaick to Poetick Shore. <br> I'll tear the Scoundrel into twenty Pieces. <br> <b> QUEEN.</b>   Oh, no! prevent the Match, but hurt him not; <br> For, tho' I would not have him have my Daughter, <br> Yet, can we kill the Man who kill'd the Giants? <br> <b> GRIZZLE.</b>   I tell you Madam, it was all a Trick, <br> He made the Giants first, and then he kill'd them; <br> As Fox-hunters bring Foxes to a Wood, <br> And then with Hounds they drive them out again. <br> <b> QUEEN. </b>  How! Have you seen no Giants? Are there not <br> Now, in the Yard, ten thousand proper Giants? <br> <b> GRIZZLE.</b>   Indeed, I cannot positively tell, <br> But firmly do believe there is not one. <br> <b> QUEEN.</b>   Hence! from my Sight! thou Traytor, hie away; <br> By all my Stars! thou enviest <i> Tom Thumb. <br> </i> Go, Sirrah! go; hie away!hie! - thou art <br> A Setting-Dog - and like one I use thee. <br> <b> GRIZZLE.</b>   Madam, I go. <br> <i> Tom Thumb</i>  shall feel the Vengeance you have rais'd. <br> So when two Dogs are fighting in the Streets, <br> With a third dog, the Dog contending meets, <br> With angry Teeth, he bites him to the Bone, <br> And this Dog smarts for what that Dog had done. <br>             [<i> Exit.</i>  <br>  <br>  <br> <b> SCENE VI.</b>  <br> Queen, <i> Sola. <br>  <br>  </i> <b> QUEEN.</b>   And whither shall I go? - Alack-a-day! <br> I love <i> Tom Thumb - </i> but must not tell him so; <br> For what's a Woman, when her Virtue's gone? <br> A Coat without its Lace; Wig out of Buckle; <br> A Stocking with a Hole in't. - I can't live <br> Without my Virtue, or without <i> Tom Thumb. <br> </i> Then let me weigh them in two equal Scales, <br> In this Scale put my Virtue, that, <i> Tom Thumb. <br> </i> Alas!  <i> Tom Thumb</i>  is heavier than my Virtue. <br> But hold!-Perhaps I may be left a Widow: <br> This Match prevented, then <i> Tom Thumb</i>  is mine, <br> In that dear Hope, I will forget my Pain. <br> So when some Wench to <i> Tothill-Bridewell's</i>  sent, <br> With beating Hemp, and Flogging, she's content; <br> She hopes, in Time, to ease her present Pain; <br> At length is free, and walks the Streets again.<br>            [<i> Exit. <br>  <br> </i>  <br>  <br> <b> ACT II.  SCENE  I.</b>  <br> Huncamunca, Cleora, Mustacha.<br>  <br>  <b> HUNCAMUNCA</b> .

Tom Thumb! </i> wherefore art <br> thou <i> Tom Thumb? <br> </i> Why had'st thou not been born of Royal Blood? <br> Why had not mighty <i> Bantam </i> been thy Father? <br> Or else the King of <i> Brentford,</i>  <i> Old</i>  or <i> New? <br> </i> <b> MUSTACHA.</b>   I am surprized that your Highness can give your <br> self a Moment's uneasiness about that little insignificant Fellow, <br> <i> Tom Thumb. </i> One properer for a Play-thing than a Husband. - <br> Were he my Husband, his Horns should be as long as his Body.- <br> If you had fallen in Love with a Grenadier, I should not have <br> wondered at it. If you had fallen in Love with Something; but to <br> fall in Love with Nothing! <br> <b> HUNCAMUNCA.</b>   Cease, my <i> Mustacha</i> , on your Duty cease. <br> The <i> Zephyr</i> , when in flowry Vales it plays, <br> Is not so soft, so sweet as <i> Thummy's</i>  Breath. <br> The Dove is not so gentle to its Mate. <br> <b> MUSTACHA.</b>   The Dove is every bit as proper for a Husband. <br> Alas! Madam, there's not a Beau about the Court that looks so <br> little like a Man. He is a perfect Butterfly, a Thing without <br> Substance, and almost without Shadow too. <br> <b> HUNCAMUNCA.</b>   This Rudeness is unseasonable; desist, <br> Or I shall think this Railing comes from Love. <br> <i> Tom Thumb's </i> a Creature of that charming Form, <br> That no one can abuse, unless they love him. <br> <b> CLEORA.</b>   Madam, the King. <br>  <br>  <br> <b> SCENE  II.</b>  <br> King, Huncamunca. <br>  <br>  <b> KING.</b>    Let all but <i> Huncamunca</i>  leave the Room.<br>                [<i> Exit </i> Cleora, <i> and </i> Mustacha. <br> Daughter, I have of late observ'd some Grief <br> Unusual in your Countenance, your Eyes <br> That, like two open Windows, us'd to shew <br> The lovely Beauty of the Room within, <br> Have now two Blinds before them - What is the Cause? <br> Say, have you not enough of Meat or Drink? <br> We've giv'n strict Orders not to have you stinted. <br> <b> HUNCAMUNCA.</b>    Alas! my Lord, a tender Maid may want <br> What she can neither eat nor drink - <br> <b> KING.</b>   What's that? <br> <b> HUNCAMUNCA.</b>   Oh! Spare my Blushes, but I mean a Husband. <br> <b> KING.</b>   If that be all, I have provided one, <br> A Husband great in Arms, whose warlike Sword <br> Streams with the yellow Blood of slaughter'd Giants. <br> Whose Name in <i> Terrâ incognitâ</i>  is known,	 <br> Whose Valour, Wisdom, Virtue make a Noise, <br> Great as the Kettle Drums of twenty Armies. <br> <b> HUNCAMUNCA.</b>   Whom does my Royal Father mean? <br> <b> KING.</b>   <i> Tom Thumb. <br> </i> <b> HUNCAMUNCA.</b>   Is it possible? <br> <b> KING.</b>   Ha! the Window-Blinds are gone, <br> A Country Dance of Joys is in your Face, <br> Your Eyes spit Fire, your Cheeks grow red as Beef. <br> <b> HUNCAMUNCA.</b>   O, there's a Magick-musick in that Sound, <br> Enough to turn me into Beef indeed. <br> Yes, I will own, since licens'd by your Word, <br> I'll own <i> Tom Thumb</i>  the Cause of all my Grief. <br> For him I've sigh'd, I've wept, I've gnaw'd my Sheets. <br>  <br>  <br> <b> SCENE III.</b>  <br> King, Huncamunca, Doodle. <br>  <br>  <b> DOODLE.</b>   Oh! fatal News-the great <i> Tom Thumb </i> is dead<i> . <br> </i> <b> KING.</b>   How dead! <br> <b> DOODLE.</b>   Alas! as dead as a Door-Nail. <br> Help, help, the Princess faints! <br> <b> KING.</b>    Fetch her a Dram. <br> <b> HUNCAMUNCA.</b>   Under my Bed you'll find a Quart of Rum. <br>            [<i> Exit </i> Doodle. <br> <b> KING.</b>   How does my pretty Daughter? <br> <b> HUNCAMUNCA.</b>   Thank you, Papa, <br> I'm something better now. <br> <b> KING.</b>   What Slave waits there? <br>            [<i> Enter </i> Slave. <br> Go order the Physicians strait before me, <br> That did attend <i> Tom Thumb </i> -<i>  </i>  now by my Stars, <br> Unless they give a full and true Account <br> Of his Distemper, they shall all be hang'd. <br> <b> DOODLE. </b>  [<i> returns</i> .]   Here is the Bottle, and here is the Glass. <br> I found them both together- <br> <b> KING.</b>   Give them me.<br>            [<i> fills the Glass. <br> </i> Drink it all off, it will do you no harm. <br>  <br>  <br> <b> SCENE IV.</b>  <br> King, Huncamunca, Doodle, Physicians. <br>  <br>  <b> I PHYSICIAN.</b>   We here attend your Majesty's Command. <br> <b> KING.</b>   Of what Distemper did <i> Tom Thumb</i>  demise? <br> <b> I PHYSICAN.</b>   He died, may it please your Majesty, of a  <br> Distemper which <i> Paracelsus</i>  calls the <i> Diaphormane, Hippocrates</i>  the <br> <i> Catecumen, Galen, </i> the <i> Regon</i> -He was taken with a Dizziness in <br> his Head, for which I bled him, and put on Four Blisters-he  <br> then had the Gripes, wherefore I thought it proper to apply <br> a Glister, a Purge, and a Vomit. <br> <b> 2 PHYSICIAN.</b>   Doctor, you mistake the Case; the Distemper <br> was not the <i> Diaphormane,</i>  as you vainly imagine; it was the  <br> <i> Peripilusis</i> -and tho' I approve very much of all that you did-let  <br> me tell you, you did not do half enough-you know he complained  <br> of a Pain in his Arm, I would immediately have cut off his Arm,  <br> and have laid open his Head, to which I would have applied  <br> some <i> Trahifick</i>  Plaister; after that I would have proceeded to my  <br> <i> Catharticks, Emeticks, </i> and <i> Diureticks.</i>  <br> <b> I PHYSICIAN.</b>   In the <i> Peripilusis </i> indeed these Methods are not <br> only wholesome but necessary: but in the <i> Diaphormane</i>  otherwise. <br> <b> 2 PHYSICIAN.</b>   What are the Symptoms of the <i> Diaphormane? <br> </i> <b> I PHYSICIAN.</b>   They are various-very various and uncertain. <br> <b> 2 PHYSICIAN.</b>   Will you tell me that a Man died of the <i> Diaphomane</i>   <br> in one Hour-when the Crisis of that Distemper does not rise till  <br> the Fourth? <br> <b> I PHYSICIAN.</b>   The Symptoms are various, very various and <br> uncertain. <br>  <br>  <br> <b> SCENE V.</b>  <br> <i> [To them.]  </i> Tom Thumb <i> attended. <br>  <br>  </i> <b> THUMB.</b>   Where is the Princess? where's my <i> Huncamunca? <br> </i> Lives she?
