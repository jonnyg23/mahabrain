The attempt is again made - however inadequately - to do for the epic of our own race, and in a form adapted to dramatic presentation, a small measure of that which Richard Wagner achieved in an allied art for the Teutonic legends.<br>                 Excalibur was completed, and in its present form, in the year 1893.  Since then no other than verbal changes have been made.  This is said for the reason that during the last fifteen years several new dramatic versions of the Arthurian epic have appeared, and the correspondences between them and the present attempt must of necessity be somewhat marked.  In every case, however, these are due to the nature of the subject and the compulsion of established and indestructible ideas.<br>  <br>  -- THE AUTHOR<br>  <br>  <center>DRAMATIS PERSONAE</center> <br>  <br>  <b> Arthur Pendragon</b> : afterwards King of England.<br>  Vassals of England:<br>  <b> Uriens</b> , King of Gore,<br>  <b> Nentres</b> , King of Garlot,<br>  <b> Leodegrance</b> , King of Cameliard,<br>  <b> Duke Lucas of the Southfolk,</b> <br>  <b> Duke Brastias of Estsex,</b> <br>  <br>  <b> Rience</b> , King of North Wales,<br>  <br>  English Knights.:<br>  <b> Sir Launcelot du Lake,</b> <br>  <b> Sir Tor,</b> <br>  <b> Sir Pelleas,</b> <br>  <b> Sir Ector,</b> <br>  <b> Sir Breuse saunce Pité,</b> <br>  <br>  <b> The Archbishop of Canterbury.</b> <br>  <b> Sir Kay</b> , the Seneschal.<br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>  <b> Morgan le Fay</b> , Queen of Gore.<br>  <b> Guenever</b> , Daughter of King Leodegrance.<br>  <b> Dame Columbe</b> , Wife to Sir Kay.<br>  <b> Ettard.</b> <br>  <b> Ysed.</b> <br>  <b> Nimue.</b> <br>  Roman Ambassadors, Barons, Knights, Esquires, Citizens, Priests, Monks, Heralds, Pages, and Lake Girls.<br>  <br>  <b> Scene</b> , <i> England and Wales.</i> <br>  <br>  <center><h2 align="CENTER">Excalibur</h2> </center> <br>  <br>  <center><h1 align="CENTER">Prologue</h1> </center> <br>  <br>  <i> The curtains open on impenetrable darkness.</i> <br>  <br>  <b> Merlin</b>  (<i> invisible</i> ).<br>  Pendragon passes; now Pendragon's seed<br>  Shall reign, Pendragon, on Pendragon's throne.<br>  A kingdom passes; now a kingdom's king<br>  Shall raise a kingdom for the King of kings.<br>  <br>  (<i> Merlin's figure becomes faintly visible, poised in mid-air.</i> )<br>  <br>  Morgan le Fay, rise from the riven rock,<br>  Rise through the waters of the Magic Mere,<br>  Merlin, thy master, calls.<br>                                               The night is done.<br>  I hear the trumpets of the trampling day,<br>  I see the glimmer of the torch of dawn<br>  Dance like the northern fires along the sky.<br>  The curse is lifted, England wakes again.<br>  <br>  <b> Angelic Voices</b>  (<i> above</i> ).<br>                                Night passes,<br>                                the darkness breaks:<br>                                see how the curse<br>                                is wafted away!<br>                                Down from Heaven,<br>                                a beam of light,<br>                                Sinks the smile of the Lord.<br>                                England, awake!<br>                                Rouse to the cry!<br>                 Day is at dawn for the land<br>                 for God is aweary of wrath.<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>  Hark!  how the marshalled choristers of God<br>  Proclaim the dawn that burgeons on the world.<br>  Now falls thy kingdom, Morgan, all awrack,<br>  For Uther dies, and England waits a king.<br>  The rune is written: "Now Pendragon's seed<br>  Shall reign, Pendragon, on Pendragon's throne."<br>  Whereby God's kingdom grows in England.<br>                                                              Rise,<br>  Morgan le Fay!

Noon<br>  Was hot upon us, and I lay me down<br>  Beside a fountain in a drowsy wood,<br>  And if I slept I know not, but anon<br>  Deep thunder rolled and I did see in sooth<br>  The forest filled with griffins, gaunt and grim,<br>  And slimy serpents, slavering as they crawled<br>  On scaly bellies through the cringing grass.<br>  High in the midst of all, as he were king,<br>  I saw a beast beyond all mortal ken,<br>  Huge, humped and horrible, with scaly sides<br>  And twisted talons fierce with rending claws.<br>  Winged was he with the pinions of a bat,<br>  And either side his harsh and horny beak<br>  Blazed baleful eyes that blinked and rolled amain,<br>  While over all I saw as on his helm<br>  The Dragon of our House.<br>                                               The while I lay<br>  And marvelled on this strange and grizzly thing,<br>  Meseemed the wood grew thick with myriad knights<br>  From all my kingdom.  Then the raging Beast<br>  Shrilled wonderly: right so the serpent brood<br>  Hurled on my knights, and in such grievous wise<br>  That in a little none was left on live.<br>  And all the forest darkened as the Beast<br>  Went howling onward.  "Now Pendragon's seed<br>  Shall slay Pendragon!"  And I saw him not.<br>  <br>  <b> Sir Launcelot.</b> <br>  By Holy Rood, a grim, ungentle dream.<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>  So thought I, but I saw the Beast again.<br>  <br>  <b> Columbe.</b> <br>  With thine own waking eyes?<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>                                               I saw the Beast.<br>  No word said I unto Sir Ector here<br>  Of that I thought a dream, but on a day,<br>  The while we rode athwart a savage wood,<br>  Sir Ector cried: "Sweet Jesu, be my aid!<br>  What thing is that?"  I looked, and lo, the Beast<br>  Came hurling with the sound of many hounds<br>  Adown a forest path until he spied<br>  A little fountain, where he stayed to drink.<br>  <br>  <b> Sir Launcelot.</b> <br>  And didst thou slay him?<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>                                               Listen, Launcelot.<br>  Certes I pricked full hotly on the Beast,<br>  But when he marked the onset, on he rolled<br>  The while I followed fiercely.  Weary leagues<br>  I tracked him till my steed was clean forspent<br>  And fell beneath me.  Then the Questing Beast<br>  Turned like a labouring carrack, and I dressed<br>  My shield, for I did think a sore debate<br>  Lay twixt us, but the Beast gave tongue and spake:<br>  "Hail, king and father!  Seekest thou for death?<br>  Not now, but after, comes the dolorous day."<br>  Wherewith he vanished like a flash of light,<br>  And so I won disworship of my quest.<br>  <br>  <b> Columbe.</b> <br>  By all the saints of God, an evil Beast!<br>  Wilt quench thy thirst again?

Midnight.</i> <br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>  How silent lie the purple fields of God<br>  Above the troubled earth.  Since time began,<br>  When, by the fiat of Omnipotence,<br>  The howling chaos, without form, and void,<br>  Swelled to this awful vault, the hollow dome<br>  That prisons us upon this little world<br>  Has hung inexorable.  Like a bird<br>  That beats with futile wing against the roof,<br>  The soul soars through the cavernous abyss<br>  To smite impatient pinions 'gainst the sky<br>  And falls back, vanquished.  On the farther side<br>  Of that impenetrable firmament<br>  Lies Wisdom absolute, wherein the saints<br>  And shining angels have a part with God.<br>  Yet we that need so grievously the light<br>  Of knowledge, were it but a slender ray<br>  No larger than should filter through the chink<br>  Of any little star, must live our lives<br>  Unholpen, undirected.<br>                                               What is this<br>  That I have won of wisdom but the blind<br>  And devious gropings of a creeping worm<br>  Hid in the heavy earth?  The world of men<br>  He knows not, as I know not what is hid<br>  Forever by that roof of adamant.<br>  And yet, such learning as I win must serve<br>  To make me master of these little men<br>  Whereof I build a kingdom.  Oh, how frail<br>  The stones that I must work withal, how small<br>  The craft that aids me, and when all is done<br>  How unenduring is the fabric raised.<br>  <br>  I may not think of this, but for the time<br>  As other men, see that which lies to hand,<br>  For wisdom works inaction in the blood<br>  By showing forth the dread futility<br>  Of that we do.  How darkness chills the will<br>  And halts the hand.  Come, disenchanting flame,<br>  Dispel my langour!<br>  <br>  (<i> He kindles the brazier.

Let me rest<br>  Above the world with thee, a little space,<br>  I will not hamper thee.<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                               Were I a boy<br>  All flushed with ardours, I would think a dream<br>  Encountered with me in some dusky pass<br>  Of unsubstantial sleep.<br>  <br>  <b> Nimue.</b> <br>                                               Why stare ye, sir,<br>  And bend your solemn brows upon my face?<br>  Is it so strange a thing to meet a maid<br>  Within thy frowning stronghold?<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                               Wit ye well<br>  You are the only lady of the court<br>  That would forgather with the sorcerer<br>  Upon his tower.

That thou hast the garb<br>  And hungry visage of the sorcerer,<br>  Gray Merlin, I confess.<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                               Where is thy Sword?<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>  I gave it, starling-tongue, to Guenever<br>  In pledge of love, as I would give the world<br>  An' I possessed it.  As I gave my crown,<br>  My kingdom, all!<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                Thou silly, babbling fool,<br>  Look 'round; dost know this place, and dost thou see<br>  The Lady Guenever?<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>                                Speak, sorcerer!<br>  Hast thou through black enchantment reft her hence?<br>  What hast thou done with Guenever?  By God,<br>  An' thou hast harmed her, I will gnaw thy heart<br>  Before thine eyes!<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                Oh, what a thing is man,<br>  When he has cast away the flimsy guise<br>  The world bestows to veil his nakedness.<br>  And I must work with such unhandy tools<br>  As these to carve a kingdom.<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>                                Wil't thou speak?<br>  Or must I cut the truth from out thy maw:<br>  Where is my lady?<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                Hid in Camelot.<br>  Nor has she moved therefrom since I upreared<br>  A mist betwixt ye that ye may not pass.<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>  Thou liest, Merlin, for I lay but now<br>  Upon her breast, within the Magic Mere.<br>  Whence thou didst draw me by malignant spells<br>  To make me serve thee.<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                Since thou didst fall on sleep<br>  Thou hast not seen the Lady Guenever,<br>  But thou hast wantoned with a damnèd witch<br>  Beneath the waters of the lake of hell,<br>  And for an hour of lechery hast sold<br>  Thy maidenhood and lost Excalibur.<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>  I hear thy words, but as the senseless din<br>  Of summer thunder.<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                Thou shalt understand<br>  Their heavy import shortly.  Mark me well:<br>  Such futile treason was not since the day<br>  When Judas sold Christ Jesu.  Thou art he<br>  That bartered England for an harlot's kiss.<br>  My weary eyes, that scarce can mark the course<br>  Upon the dial of the shadow's path,<br>  Saw through the weltering waters of the Mere<br>  Down to the murky depths.  I saw thee crawl<br>  A wanton suppliant at a witch's feet;<br>  I saw thee hang upon her mocking lips<br>  And sell the Sword I bravèd hell to win.<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>  O Merlin, I am as a troubled child<br>  That awakes from noisome dreams.  I cannot see,<br>  I know not what I say.  Give me thy hand<br>  And gentle pardon for unknightly words,<br>  Read me the cursèd riddle!<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                               Endless years<br>  Have I wrought patiently to save this land.<br>  The curse was lifted, and I crowned thee king<br>  And gave thee that which should have made thee lord<br>  Of such a kingdom as were fit for God.<br>  Against thee hurtled all the craft of hell<br>  To gain Excalibur, and thou didst prove<br>  A faithful warder; traitor to thy name<br>  And knightly lineage.  The Sword is gone.<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>  Merlin, I love her as I love my God;<br>  'Twas Guenever!<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                'Twas Morgan, hight le Fay,<br>  Thy sister.<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>                 Jesu, mercy!<br>  <br>  (<i> He falls upon his face.</i> )<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                               For thy sin,<br>  For thine unholy incest, cry to God<br>  For pardon.  Thou shalt pay the penalty<br>  With thine own blood, and I may save thee not<br>  Although I love thee as an only son.<br>  A little time is left us ere the doom<br>  Falls on thee.  Swear to do my will<br>  And we may baffle Morgan, save the State,<br>  And render it into the hand of God.<br>  Swear me, King Arthur, and I win the Sword.<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>  Blast me, Lord God, with lightning, for my sin,<br>  Else will I tear mine eyes from out my face<br>  And sink my body in the cursèd Mere!<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>  Rend not thy body, Arthur, rend thy soul;<br>  For that thou art a perjured, bawdy knave,<br>  Foul with dishonour; yet I know indeed<br>  That thing must lie with God.  I deal with thee<br>  As King of England, I may give no heed<br>  Unto thy soul but only to thy Sword,<br>  The which I will achieve if thou wilt swear.<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>  What shall I do to gain Excalibur?<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>  Wilt thou be sworn?<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>                                Yea, Merlin, I will swear.<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>  Renounce thou by thy knighthood love and lust;<br>  Swear by Christ Jesu's wounds that thou wilt live<br>  A spotless knight, and I will win the Sword.<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>  I cannot, Merlin.<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                What, thou wilt not swear?<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>  I cannot, Merlin.  Lust I fling away,<br>  And, by God's grace, I keep myself from sin<br>  If He will help me.  Love I hold mine own;<br>  For I have sworn an oath to Guenever<br>  And I will keep it if I lose the crown.<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>  Bethink thee, king, for England hangs on this;<br>  Excalibur is gone.  Ambassadors<br>  But lately come from out disdainful Rome<br>  Already are returning to their king<br>  That threats thee with invasion.  Grimly war<br>  Shall compass England with a ring of death<br>  Advancing dauntlessly upon thy throne<br>  Where thou art shrinking in a woman's arms.<br>  What shall they profit thee if thou art bare<br>  Of thy most sure defence, Excalibur?<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>  Forsake thy vision, Merlin: let me go<br>  And hide me in the refuge of my love.<br>  I am not of such metal as a king<br>  Is fashionèd, and I shall fail thee sore<br>  If thou dost wield me.  Give me Guenever,<br>  And let me sink in dim forgetfulness<br>  The while thou find'st a weapon to thy mind.<br>  I may not serve thee.<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                Yet perforce thou shalt;<br>  I know thy temper and it suits me well,<br>  Despite thy softness.  None may save this land<br>  And bring the kingdom of the living God<br>  Upon this earth, but only thou thyself.<br>  Deny thy destiny and hell prevails,<br>  The night descends, and man shall grope in vain<br>  Through murky shadows for the hand of God,<br>  Nor find it ever.  Seize the Sword and reign!<br>  So shall thy name be blazoned on the page<br>  Of God's great chronicle of blessèd saints<br>  That do His service for His people's sake.<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>  Give back my lady and I do thy will;<br>  Yea, Merlin, even to the uttermost<br>  And latest, lingering drop of mine own blood;<br>  Deny me, and I give thee back the crown.<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>  What profits me my wisdom when I wage<br>  Uneven warfare 'gainst hot-headed love<br>  That weighs a beating heart against the world?<br>  Needs must I meet thy humour.  Hear me, boy;<br>  The rune is written.  "Now Pendragon's seed<br>  Shall slay Pendragon for Pendragon's lust."<br>  Read thou the import.  Yet a little while<br>  And Morgan bears a child within whose veins<br>  Runs, dark and turbid, great Pendragon's blood.<br>  By him thou diest, king!<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>                                And in this wise,<br>  For mine own wanton act, the doom shall fall.<br>  So be it, Merlin.  Ye have space to act<br>  And I to do thy bidding, ere the wrath<br>  Of God is on me.  Give me Guenever,<br>  And when I go the crown shall fall again<br>  Unto Pendragon's seed.<br>  <br>  (<i> A long pause.</i> )<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                Yea, that is well.<br>  And in despite of destiny I yield<br>  Unto thine inclination.<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>                                Pledge thy word,<br>  Thine honour, and thine oath to give me her<br>  That I do love, the Lady Guenever,<br>  To make her queen.<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>                                That thing I soothly do,<br>  Wilt thou be sworn?<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>                                Yea, Merlin, I will swear.<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>  Then, by God's wounds and by thy body's faith,<br>  Swear to forsake all lust forevermore,<br>  But live unstainèd and devoid of sin.<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>  By Jesu's Blood and by the faith I owe<br>  Unto my knighthood I do swear the oath.<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>  Come thou with me, the day is not yet lost<br>  Though perilled grievously, for nevermore<br>  May I compel the false and paynim witch<br>  To render up Excalibur.  Be true<br>  Upon thine oath; we may save England yet,<br>  Though hardly.<br>  <br>  (<i> He leads</i>  Arthur<i>  to the brink of the Mere.</i> )<br>  <br>                 Stand thou by me while I call<br>  Upon the loathly witch to hear my voice,<br>  And by the power of the awful spell<br>  That by God's grace I weave around here, yield<br>  The Sword of Joseph to thy waiting hand.<br>  Art ready, boy?<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>                 Here stand I, Merlin: speak!<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>  When thou dost see an arm from out the Mere,<br>  Robed in white samite, lift above the flood,<br>  Grasp thou the proffered hilt.<br>  <br>  <b> King Arthur.</b> <br>                                               I will obey.<br>  <br>  <b> Merlin.</b> <br>  Morgan le Fay, by grace of Him that lives<br>  Lord God of Heaven and Earth, and by the spell<br>  So awful and so potent, of the king<br>  Great Solomon of Israel, obey!<br>  Around the Magic Mere I weave the rune<br>  That locks thee helpless in an iron ring.<br>  From thy duresse thou may'st not win away,<br>  Thou lewd and miscreant fayter, without scathe<br>  Unless ye render ransom.  Yield the Sword<br>  That with mal-engine thou didst win away.<br>  Yield thou the Sword!<br>  <br>  (<i> A sound of wailing rises from the lake.</i> )<br>  <br>                                Must I then ask again?<br>  I give thee warning, lightly yield the Sword,<br>  For if thou haltest till the lifting moon<br>  Mounts skyward by the breadth of half a hand<br>  I'll damn thee down to hell!<br>  <br>  (<i> Clouds obscure the moon and a fierce wind rushes across the lake.  The wailing increases to a shriek.</i> )<br>  <br>                                Yield thou the Sword!<br>  Dost think to fright me with the stour of storm,<br>  And let me my quest with futile din?<br>  Thou art assotted, Morgan.  Yield the Sword!<br>  <br>  (<i> The storm bursts with a tempest of thunder and lighting</i> )<br>  <br>  Ha, ha!  ye fight with weapons weak with rust!<br>  Howl, tempests, 'til ye blast the shrinking earth;<br>  Blaze, all ye lightnings, split the sky in shards<br>  And hurl the reeling stars in torrents down,<br>  Ye cannot move me from a mighty quest.<br>  I bandy words no longer.  Yield the Sword<br>  Before my heart beats thrice within my breast<br>  Or thou art damned!  Yield thou Excalibur!<br>  <br>  (<i> A pale, greenish light rises and illuminates the surface of the lake.  Within Arthur's reach an arm arises, brilliantly lighted, holding Excalibur.  He seizes it and brandishes it in the glare of lightning.  The light vanishes and the moon bursts through the clouds.</i> )<br>  <br>  <b> Angelic Voices.</b> <br>                 Hail, Pendragon!<br>                 Lord of the Sword.<br>                 Crownèd of England<br>                 saviour and king.<br>  Arise!
