B. YEATS</h2>  </center>  <br>  <i> A marble-flagged, pillared room.  Magical instruments in one corner.  A fountain in the centre.</i>  <br> <br> <i> Vivien</i>  (<i> looking down into the fountain</i> ).<br>    Where moves there any beautiful as I,<br>    Save, with the little golden greedy carp,<br>    Gold unto gold, a gleam in its long hair,<br>    My image yonder?     (<i> Spreading her hand over the water.</i> )<br>                    Ah, my beautiful,<br>    What roseate fingers!                  (<i> Turning away.</i> )<br>                         No; nor is there one<br>    Of equal power in spells and secret rites.  <br>    The proudest or most coy of spirit things,<br>    Hide where he will, in wave or wrinkled moon,<br>    Obeys.<br>          Some fierce magician flies or walks<br>    Beyond the gateway--by the sentries now--<br>    Close and more close     I feel him in my heart<br>    Some great one.  No; I hear the wavering steps<br>    Without there of a little, light old man;<br>    I dreamt some great one.<br>    (<i> Catching sight of her image, and spreading her hand over the<br>         water.</i> )<br>                                Ah, my beautiful,<br>    What roseate fingers!<br> <br> (<i> Enter Time as an old pedlar, with a scythe, an hour-glass, and a black<br>              bag.</i> )<br> <br>                      Ha, ha! ha, ha, ha!  <br>    The wrinkled squanderer of human wealth.  <br>    Come here.  Be seated now; I'd buy of you.<br>    Come, father.<br> <br> <i> Time.</i>            Lady, I nor rest nor sit.<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>   Well then, to business; what is in your bag?<br> <br> <i> Time</i>  (<i> putting the bag and hour-glass on the table and<br>         resting on his scythe</i> ).<br>    Grey hairs and crutches, crutches and grey hairs,<br>    Mansions of memories and mellow thoughts<br>    Where dwell the minds of old men having peace,<br>    And--<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>   No; I'll none of these, old Father Wrinkles.<br> <br> <i> Time.</i>   Some day you'll buy them, maybe.<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>                                 Never!<br> <br> <i> Time</i>  (<i> laughing</i> ).                             Never?<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>  Why do you laugh?<br> <br> <i> Time.</i>                    I laugh the last always.<br> <br>          (<i> She lays the hour-glass on one side.  Time rights it again.</i> )<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>   I do not need your scythe.  May that bring peace<br>    To those your "mellow" wares have wearied out.<br>    I'll buy your glass.<br> <br> <i> Time</i>                    My glass I will not sell.<br>    Without my glass I'd be a sorry clown.<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>   Yet whiter beard have you than Merlin had. <br> <br> <i> Time.</i>   No taste have I for slumber 'neath an oak.<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>   When were you born?<br> <br> <i> Time.</i>                        Before your grandam Eve.<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>   Oh, I am weary of that foolish tale.<br>    They say you are a gambler and a player<br>    At chances and at moments with mankind.<br>    I'll play you for your old hour-glass.  (<i> Pointing to the<br>          instruments of magic.</i> )           You see<br>    I keep such things about me; they are food<br>    For antiquarian meditation.              (<i> Brings dice.</i> )<br> <br> <i> Time.</i>                          Ay,<br>   We throw three times.<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>  Three-six.<br> <br> <i> Time.</i>   Four-six.<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>   Five-six.  Ha, Time!<br> <br> <i> Time.</i>   Double sixes!<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>   I lose!  They're loaded dice.  Time always plays<br>    With loaded dice.  Another chance!  Come, father;<br>    Come to the chess, for young girls' wits are better<br>    Than old men's any day, as Merlin found.<br>                       (<i> Places the chess-board on her knees.</i> )<br>    The passing of those little grains is snow<br>    Upon my soul, old Time.<br>                        (<i> She lays the hour-glass on its side.</i> )<br> <br> <i> Time.</i>                     No; thus it stands.<br>                                        (<i> Rights it again.</i> )<br>    For other stakes we play.  You lost the glass.<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>   Then give me triumph in my many plots.<br> <br> <i> Time.</i>   Defeat is death.<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>                 Should my plots fail I'd die.<br>                                                (<i> They play.</i> )<br>    Thus play we first with pawns, poor things and weak:<br>    And then the great ones come, and last the king.<br>    So men in life and I in magic play;<br>    First dreams, and goblins, and the lesser sprites,<br>    And now with Father Time I'm face to face.<br>                                            (<i> They play.</i> )<br>    I trap you.<br> <br> <i> Time.</i>          Check.<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>              I do miscalculate.<br>    I am dull to-day, or you were now all lost.<br>    Chance, and not skill, has favoured you, old father!<br>                                         (<i> She plays.</i> )<br> <br> <i> Time.</i>   Check.<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>   Ah! how bright your eyes.  How swift your moves.<br>    How still it is!  I hear the carp go splash,<br>    And now and then a bubble rise. I hear<br>    A bird walk on the doorstep.                      (<i> She plays</i> ).<br> <br> <i> Time.</i>                           Check once more.<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>   I must be careful now.  I have such plots--<br>    Such war plots, peace plots, love plots--every side;<br>    I cannot go into the bloodless land<br>    Among the whimpering ghosts.<br> <br> <i> Time.</i>                           Mate thus.<br> <br> <i> Vivien.</i>                                   Already?<br>    Chance hath a skill!                   (<i> She dies.</i> )<br>
