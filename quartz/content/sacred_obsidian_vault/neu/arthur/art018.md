Morn arose,<br>  And call'd the Lab'rer from his soft repose.<br>  Thro' all the Region flew Loquacious Fame;<br>  And the glad tydings spread, where'er she came.<br>  Prince <i> Arthur</i> 's Landed, is the general Cry,<br>  Straight to their Arms the chearful <i> Briton</i> s fly.<br>  The great Restorer all prepare to meet,<br>  And warlike Noise resounds in every Street.<br>  His eager Friends impatient of delay,<br>  Had long expected this Auspicious Day.<br>  They knew he was Embark'd to bring them Aid,<br>  And for his quick, and safe Arrival pray'd.<br>  Oft on the Rocks and highest Hills they stood,<br>  And all around the Subject Ocean view'd<br>  With longing Eyes, hoping the sight to gain<br>  Of <i> Arthur</i> 's Conquering Navy on the Main.<br>  And when no Fleet, no <i> Arthur</i>  they descry'd,<br>  They chid the Winds, and interposing Tyde.<br>  With less impatience staid th' <i> Ithacian</i>  Dame,<br>  Till to her Arms her wish'd <i> Ulysses</i>  came.<br>  The <i> Sestian</i>  Maid not with such Passion stood,<br>  To spy her Lover cutting thro' the Flood.<br>  The Zealous Men while adverse <i> Boreas</i>  reign'd,<br>  And from the Coasts Prince <i> Arthur</i> 's Fleet detain'd,<br>  When mild <i> Aurora</i>  with her rosy Light,<br>  Began to streak the dusky Face of Night,<br>  Oft from their Beds, up to the Windows flew,<br>  And thence the Fanes and flying Clouds would view,<br>  To see if yet more favourable Gales<br>  Rose from the South, to swell Prince <i> Arthur</i> 's Sails.<br>  Anxious they look around, but when they find<br>  Their hopes retarded by an adverse Wind,<br>  Their Sorrow in repeated Sighs exprest,<br>  They to their Beds return, but not to Rest.<br>  <br>     Thus they expected <i> Arthur</i> 's powerful Aid,<br>  And such their Sorrow was, their Hopes delay'd.<br>  But now, at last the Prince's Fleet arriv'd,<br>  Raises their Courage, and their Hopes reviv'd.<br>  The joyful Throngs Prince <i> Arthur</i> 's Praise proclaim,<br>  This every Tongue employs, ev'n Children aim,<br>  That scarce have learn'd to speak, to lisp his Name.<br>  Some praise his Stature, and his God-like Face,<br>  His awful Presence, and Majestick Grace,<br>  His Courage some, and Conduct in the Field,<br>  And think great <i> Cæsar</i> 's Fame to his, must yield.<br>  His Clemency and Pity some admire,<br>  And all the Virtues, that his Mind inspire.<br>  The Actions of his Childhood some repeat,<br>  In which they still discover'd something Great.<br>  And now, what they expected he appears,<br>  The Hero promis'd in his tender years.<br>  Others relate the ancient Prophecies,<br>  Wherein was told a Monarch should arise<br>  Of mighty Power, and Universal Fame,<br>  That should to Heav'n advance the <i> British</i>  Name.<br>  Things weigh'd, and well compar'd, they all consent<br>  <i> Arthur</i> 's the Conq'rour, that the Prophets meant.<br>  Some tell their Friends, their Courage to support,<br>  What mighty Guards surround the Prince's Court.<br>  What Succours hir'd were from <i> Germania</i>  brought,<br>  Succours, as oft Victorious, as they fought.<br>  Fierce <i> Alpine</i>  <i> Allobrogs</i>  with slaughter fed,<br>  In Snows and everlasting Winter bred.<br>  Men of stupendous Bulk, pamper'd and cloy'd<br>  With Blood of Nations, which their Arms destroy'd.<br>  Arm'd with broad, flaming Swords, and mighty Spears;<br>  Their Caps were Wolves, their Coats rough Skins of Bears.<br>  Who stretcht on Beds did n'er their Limbs repose,<br>  But from the naked ground still vig'rous rose.<br>  Of Aspect terrible, their squallid Face<br>  Thick, matted Beards with bristly Terrour grace.<br>  None e'er escap'd, that did their Arms provoke,<br>  They Mow whole Squadrons with a single stroke.<br>  This monstrous Kind of Men did Fame invent,<br>  And <i> Arthur</i> 's Troops so dreadful represent,<br>  To raise the <i> Briton</i> s Hearts before deprest,<br>  And strike a Terrour thro' the <i> Saxon</i> 's Breast.<br>  With Joy transported all for Arms declare,<br>  And all the Accoutrements of War prepare.<br>  The Shepherds on the Hills forsake their Flocks,<br>  And leave their brouzing Goats upon the Rocks.<br>  Instead of Crooks, that did their Flocks command,<br>  Long warlike Spears they brandish in their Hand.<br>  The <i> British</i>  Youth their Courage rais'd, rejoyce<br>  To see the Banners fly, and hear the Trumpet's Voice.<br>  The Farmers leave the Hopes their Field afford,<br>  To reap fresh Laurels with their Conquering Sword.<br>  The noise of War does from the Hills rebound,<br>  And midst the Miners Eccho's under ground.<br>  Who straight alarm'd, at nobler Labour Sweat,<br>  And into Swords their glowing Metal beat.<br>  Their Forges, Anvils and wide Bellows breath,<br>  Are all employ'd in various kinds of Death.<br>  Some shape the Halbert, and broad Fauchion's Blade,<br>  And Darts by some, and Arrows Heads are made.<br>  Some forming Battle-Axes heave the Sledge,<br>  Some into Shields strike out a flaming Wedge.<br>  To fashion Helmets some the Hammer ply,<br>  Some labour, Pieces for the Leg and Thigh.<br>  With Lances arm'd, some their hot Coursers rein,<br>  And to the War Curvet along the Plain.<br>  Some with their clenching Gauntlets grasp the Shield,<br>  Shake their long Spears, and rush into the Field.<br>  Across their Shoulders some their Quivers hung,<br>  Their Arrows trim'd, and Bows for Death new strung.<br>  As when black Clouds dark'ning the Summer Sky,<br>  Loaded with Crystal Tempests slowly fly,<br>  Th' Artillery discharg'd with mighty Sound<br>  Th' exploded Hailstones, leap upon the ground,<br>  Thunder amidst the Woods, and from the Hills rebound.<br>  So with the <i> Briton</i> s all the Region swarms,<br>  So thick their Troops, so loud the noise of Arms.<br>  The groaning Earth complains, and trembling feels<br>  The trampling Hoofs, and Chariots fervid Wheels.<br>  <br>     In order now, Celestial Muse, declare<br>  What Troops, and who those ancient <i> Briton</i> s were,<br>  Who for their Country's Liberty combin'd,<br>  And their Brigades with <i> Arthur</i> 's Forces joyn'd.<br>  From Time's dark Prisons set the Hero's free,<br>  And may their glorious Names Immortal be.<br>  <br>     First warlike <i> Cadwall</i>  the <i> Dimetians</i>  Head,<br>  His Forces from the neighbouring Region led.<br>  Their Troops advance from the bleak Northern Shore,<br>  On which the <i> Hybernian</i>  Sea's loud Billows roar.<br>  And where <i> Octopitarum</i>  thro' the Waves<br>  Wedging his Way, the opposing Ocean braves.<br>  Fair <i> Maridunum</i>  pours her Squadrons forth,<br>  Where the fam'd Sorc'rer <i> Merlin</i>  had his Birth.<br>  They came who dwelt round high <i> Plinlimmon</i> 's Sides,<br>  Where <i> Stuccia</i>  flows, and swift <i> Turobius</i>  glides.<br>  <br>     King <i> Meridoe</i>  the <i> Oordovican</i>  leads<br>  Down from the <i> British</i>  Alps, whose snowy Heads<br>  <i> Imaus</i>  like, stand towring in the Air,<br>  And midst the Stars eternal Winter bear.<br>  And from the Soil lav'd by <i> Conovius</i>  Flood,<br>  And <i> Menai</i> 's Banks, where then <i> Segontium</i>  stood.<br>  Great Numbers swarm'd from <i> Mona</i> 's noble Isle,<br>  Deform'd for Aspect, but of fertile Soil.<br>  Where once in shady Groves erected stood,<br>  The <i> Druids</i>  Altars stain'd with humane Blood.<br>  The Troops their March from <i> Mediolanum</i>  take,<br>  From <i> Helen</i> 's Way, and the <i> Tegeian</i>  Lake.<br>  Thro' which fair <i> Deva</i> 's Streams so swiftly pass,<br>  They uncorrupted shun th' impure Embrace.<br>  Here the sublime <i> Mervinian</i>  Mountains rise,<br>  And with sharp-pointed Tops transfix the Skies.<br>  <br>     Next <i> Morogan</i>  the bold, <i> Silures</i>  brought,<br>  None for their Country's Freedom better fought.<br>  They bravely <i> Valens</i>  and his Troops withstood,<br>  And dy'd <i> Sabrina</i> 's Streams with <i> Roman</i>  Blood.<br>  With like Success <i> Veranius</i>  they defeat,<br>  And forc'd his vanquish'd Eagles to retreat.<br>  This cause, as much their Courage did provoke,<br>  To free their Country from the Saxon Yoke.<br>  They take in hast their Swords and Bucklers down,<br>  And march to meet the Prince from every Town.<br>  From all the Cities on the verdant side<br>  Of <i> Nidus</i> , and on <i> Loghor</i> 's Crystal Tyde.<br>  They march from <i> Bovium</i> , and the neighboring Shore,<br>  Thick, as the Waves, that there insulting roar.<br>  Down from the Hilly Lands the <i> Briton</i> s came,<br>  Which now th' Inhabitants <i> Brechinia</i>  name.<br>  Where the black Mount stands lofty in the Air,<br>  And forky <i> Peak</i> , since call'd great <i> Arthur</i> 's Chair.<br>  They march from <i> Bulleum</i> , <i> Haga</i> , and the Lake,<br>  Where when broad Sheets of Ice dissolving crack,<br>  The ratling Noise rebounds from Neighb'ring Hills,<br>  And with loud Thunder all the Region fills.<br>  From <i> Ariconium,</i>  and the flowry Space,<br>  Which wanton <i> Vaga</i> 's winding Arms embrace.<br>  Where <i> Lugus</i>  his transparent Bosom spreads,<br>  And where <i> Liddenus</i>  murmurs thro' the Meads.<br>  Where thick <i> Hesperian</i>  <i> Woods</i>  with Apples crown'd,<br>  Of golden Hue, enrich the Fields around.<br>  Which the most generous <i> British</i>  <i> Wine</i>  produce,<br>  <i> Ausonia</i>  scarce affords a nobler Juice.<br>  They leave the Fields fam'd for the purest Corn,<br>  And the rich Plains that Wooly Flocks adorn,<br>  Which bless the Farmer with a nobler Fleece,<br>  Than what <i> Apulia</i>  boasts, or fertile <i> Greece</i> .<br>  They leave the golden Vale, and happy Ground<br>  Which <i> Dorus</i>  laves, and lofty Woods surround,<br>  The warlike Youth from <i> Venta</i>  came and those<br>  That <i> Muno</i> 's Flood and <i> Isca</i> 's Streams inclose.<br>  With those that round the <i> Oazy</i>  <i> Moor</i>  are bred,<br>  And near the Golden Rocks refulgent Head.<br>  Out from her Gates her Youth fair <i> Isca</i>  pours.<br>  Crown'd with gilt Spires, rich Domes, and lofty Towers.<br>  Where Golden Roofs, and checker'd Floors abound,<br>  Deep Vaults, and spacious Chambers under ground.<br>  A stately Theater the Town o'erlooks,<br>  And noble Works convey the neighb'ring Brooks,<br>  By Conquering <i> Romans</i>  built, that far from home<br>  They might enjoy the Sports and Pomp of <i> Rome</i> .<br>  Such was the ample City's ancient Fame,<br>  Now worn by time it scarce preserves its Name.<br>  Those from <i> Gobanium</i>  march, a Town that stood<br>  On <i> Isca</i> 's and <i> Gevini</i> 's confluent Flood.<br>  In cheerful Troops the stout <i> Cornavians</i>  came,<br>  From the rich Soil we now <i> Salopia</i>  name.<br>  From either side of fair <i> Sabrina</i> 's Tyde,<br>  Whose silver Streams the fruitful Land divide.<br>  From <i> Usocona</i> , end the Towns that lay<br>  On the fam'd <i> Roman</i>  Military way.<br>  From <i> Uriconium</i> , yet a Noble Town, <br>  And old <i> Rutunium</i> , then of good Renown.<br>  <i> Galbut</i>  their Leader at their Head appears<br>  A lovely Youth, and Wise above his Years:<br>  Descended from a Noble ancient Race<br>  Of Heros, who the <i> British</i>  Annals grace.<br>  He by Forefathers Beams Illustrious shone,<br>  Great by their Deeds, but greater by his own.<br>  Zeal for his Country, and the <i> British</i>  Cause,<br>  The generous Youth to glorious Danger draws.<br>  For this he crost the Ocean, to implore<br>  Prince <i> Arthur</i> 's Arms, their Freedom to restore.<br>  The Prince embrac'd him, as his Fav'rite Friend,<br>  And did his Zeal and Vigilance commend.<br>  He staid the dear Companion of his Toil,<br>  Both on the Seas, and on th' <i> Armorick</i>  Soil.<br>  And when the <i> Saxon</i> , and the <i> British</i>  Fleet,<br>  (A dreadful day) did on the Ocean meet,<br>  By <i> Arthur</i> 's side upon the Deck, he stood<br>  Distain'd with scatter'd Brains, and reeking Blood.<br>  The Youth at danger unconcern'd appear'd,<br>  And nothing but his Country's Suff'rings fear'd.<br>  He leap'd out first on the <i> Dimetian</i>  Strand,<br>  And welcom'd <i> Arthur</i>  to his Native Land.<br>  Where taking leave, he to his Country came,<br>  To Head his Men, and win yet greater Fame.<br>  <br>     <i> Devana</i>  sends brave Troops, a noble Town,<br>  For lofty Works, and splendid Structures known.<br>  Where once the <i> Roman</i>  Conquerours did reside,<br>  And envy'd not <i> Italia</i> 's Wealth and Pride.<br>  The bold Inhabitants on <i> Deva</i> 's Bank,<br>  And they who <i> Danus</i> , and <i> Merseia</i>  drank;<br>  With those that had their Seats, along the Soil<br>  Which Briny Riches gives with easie Toil;<br>  Draw out and Muster on the Neighb'ring Plain,<br>  Resolv'd the <i> British</i>  Honour to regain.<br>  <i> Bothan</i>  their Captain was a Warlike Knight,<br>  A brave Asserter of his Country's Right.<br>  A noble, but ungovernable Fire,<br>  (Such is the Hero's) did his Breast inspire.<br>  His honest Rage, his Friends could scarely Rule,<br>  Hot for the Camp, but not for Counsel Cool.<br>  Fit to assist to pull a Tyrant down,<br>  But not to please the Prince that mounts the Throne.<br>  Impatient of Oppression, still he stood<br>  His Country's Mounds, against th' invading Flood.<br>  Impetuous, as a Tempest in its Course,<br>  He not to Conduct trusted, but to Force.<br>  Unskill'd in Court Intreagues, on which the wise<br>  And crafty Statesmen, as his strength, relies;<br>  He still expected that a loud Applause,<br>  Should follow Brav'ry, and a Righteous Cause, <br>   His Country prais'd him; no <i> Britannik</i>  Lord,<br>  Was as his People's Patron more ador'd.<br>  And Now in Arms they throng about their Head,<br>  None to the Prince such numerous Forces led.<br>  <br>     The <i> Corintanians</i> , that the Soil possest,<br>  By fair <i> Darventio</i> 's fruitful Waters blest,<br>  And <i> Repandunum</i> , where clear <i> Trenta's </i> Tide<br>  Do's into <i> Dovo</i> 's silver Bosome glide.<br>  Those near high <i> Peak</i> , in heavenly Waters drown'd,<br>  And in the Dale, which craggy Rocks surround;<br>  Their Zeal and Courage rais'd by loud Alarms,<br>  Forsook their Seats, and Fields, and flew to Arms.<br>  These valiant Men that Fame and Freedom sought,<br>  To join the Prince's Arms <i> Canvallo</i>  brought.<br>  Noble <i> Canvallo</i> , who did with him bring<br>  The Majesty, and Presence of a King.<br>  Of lofty Stature, and a graceful Air,<br>  By's own Sex fear'd, and favour'd by the Fair.<br>  Th' Inglorious Pleasures of the wanton Court,<br>  That drain'd his Wealth, did not the Patriot hurt,<br>  Fit for the Camp, or Business of the State,<br>  But soft Enjoyments Love to both abate.<br>  Alarm'd with Publick Danger, he arose<br>  Like a rous'd Lyon, from his long Repose.<br>  Arm'd, and equip'd with gaeat Magnificence,<br>  He mounts his fiery Turk, bought at a vast Expence.<br>  His princely Train, and splendid Equipage,<br>  Wher'ere he past the Eyes of all engag'd.<br>  <br>     The <i> Atrebatians</i>  From the happy Land,<br>  Which then sublime <i> Gallena</i>  did command.<br>  Where winding <i> Thamisis</i>  does bless the Soil,<br>  The Wealth and Glory of the <i> British</i>  Isle.<br>  In War-like Bands advance to <i> Arthur</i> 's Aid,<br>  And rich <i> Bertudor</i> , as their Head obey'd,<br>  Who still against the Pagan Interest strove,<br>  Rich in Possessions, and his People's Love.<br>  His happy Tenants, and the Farmers round,<br>  His Hospitable House still open found.<br>  Each Week ten Oxen from the Stall he drew,<br>  A hundred Sheep, and forty Swine he slew;<br>  Fat Venison, Fowl, and Fish, an endless Store,<br>  To feed his Guests, his Servants, and the Poor.<br>  He to the Woods, and Forrests was inclin'd,<br>  To hunt the Fox, and chase the flying Hind.<br>  Pleas'd with his Friends, and with his rural Sport,<br>  He wisely shun'd, the Dangers of the Court.<br>  But for the Christian Cause, and publick Peace,<br>  He quits the Forrests, and his Wealth and Ease.<br>  His Helmet brac'd, and on his Arm his Shield,<br>  He march'd before his Troops into the Field.<br>  And that my Verse may to his Name be just,<br>  Of all the Lords <i> Bertudor</i>  was the first,<br>  That to the Camp, his valiant Forces brought,<br>  Tho' not inur'd to War, and tho' remote.<br>  <br>     The <i> Durotriges</i>  from the western Coast,<br>  Where the <i> Britannick</i>  Ocean's Waves are tost.<br>  Their Troops assembled, for the Prince declare,<br>  And march from all the Towns, to meet the War.<br>  From <i> Dornavaria</i> , and the Seats that stand<br>  On <i> Froma</i> 's Stream, and wealthy <i> Blackmoor</i>  Land:<br>  From <i> Vendogladia</i> , and the Tow'rs that rose<br>  On the fat Glebe, where pleasant <i> Stourus</i>  flows.<br>  <i> Sakil</i>  their Leader, and Illustrious Peer,<br>  Was to his Prince, and to his Country dear.<br>  He, their <i> Mæcenas</i>  cheers the <i> British</i>  <i> Bards</i>

Athenian</i>  Sons adore,<br>  The Muses Fav'rite, but the People's more.<br>  To form great Men, his Palace was the School,<br>  His Life good Breeding's, and good Nature's Rule.<br>  To him the needy Men of Wit resort,<br>  And find a Friend in an unletter'd Court.<br>  The Poets Nation, did Obsequious wait<br>  For the kind Dole, divided at his Gate.<br>  <i> Laurus</i>  amisdst the meagre Crowd appear'd,<br>  An old, revolted, unbelieving Bard,<br>  Who throng'd, and shov'd, and prest, and would be heard.<br>  Distinguish'd by his louder craving Tone,<br>  So well to all the Muses Patrons known,<br>  He did the Voice of modest Poets drown.<br>  <i> Sakil</i> 's high Roof, the Muses Palace rung<br>  With endless Cries, and endless Songs he sung.<br>  To bless good <i> Sakil</i>  <i> Laurus</i>  would be first,<br>  But <i> Sakil</i> 's Prince, and <i> Sakil</i> 's God he curst.<br>  <i> Sakil</i>  without distinction threw his Bread,<br>  Despis'd the Flatt'rer, but the Poet

Region fir'd,<br>  With noble Heats, and Martial Thoughts inspir'd.<br>  None in the Field did greater Courage show,<br>  Whether he charg'd, or else sustain'd the Foe.<br>  Yet none more fit in Council to preside,<br>  And in a Storm, the lab'ring State to guide.<br>  A mighty Genius of uncommon Mould,<br>  As <i> Cæsar</i>  Eloquent, as <i> Cæsar</i>  Bold.<br>  He could th' unstable People's Tumults stop,<br>  And a declining Kingdom underprop.<br>  Matur'd by Age, and business of the State,<br>  The hoary Oracle in Council sate.<br>  Where he the <i> British</i>  <i> Nestor</i>  ws esteem'd,<br>  And all his Language, Inspiration seem'd.<br>  This finish'd Statesman, did the Prince perswade<br>  To pass the Seas, the <i> Saxon</i>  to invade.<br>  And at his Landing quick Assistance brought,<br>  And for his Country none more bravely fought.<br>  <br>     The farthest <i> Western</i>  Soil, which with their Wave<br>  The <i> British</i> , and <i> Hibernian</i>  Oceans lave.<br>  From <i> Isca</i> 's Noble Stream, far as the Shore<br>  Where round <i> Bolerium</i> 's Head the Billows roar,<br>  By the <i> Danmonian</i>  <i> Briton</i> s was possest,<br>  And with

Tarbulent, and Bold;<br>  But <i> Tracar</i>  was compos'd, sedate, and cool,<br>  His Passions subject to a stricter Rule.<br>  <i> Ormes</i>  was haughty, inaccessible,<br>  And knew his Riches, and his Sense too well.<br>  <i> Tracar</i>  was courteous, easie of Access,<br>  Of great Humanity, and mild Address.<br>  <i> Ormes</i>  was therefore honour'd not desir'd,<br>  <i> Tracar</i>  belov'd,

to the Prince resort,<br>  Which from that time is call'd great <i> Arthur</i> 's Court.<br>  Five times the Sun had his Diurnal Race<br>  Compleated, when from this delightful place<br>  The pious Prince his Ensigns mov'd, and came<br>  To <i> Glevum</i> , seated on <i> Sabrina</i> 's Stream.<br>  Decamping hence, his arm'd Battalions gain<br>  Prince <i> Arthur</i>  at their Head, the fertile Plain<br>  By easie Marches, where <i> Gallena</i>  stood,<br>  Which <i> Thamisis</i>  laves with its noble Flood.<br>  <br>     Thus stood the <i> Briton</i> s, after his Defeat,<br>  <i> Octa</i>  with Grief did to his Coasts Retreat.<br>  As when by chance a Royal Eagle spies,<br>  From some high Mountains Top, amidst the Skies;<br>  A flight of Swans, obscuring all the Air,<br>  Swift as the Lightning, which he's said to bear,<br>  Upon the Prey his Airy Flight he takes,<br>  And with sharp Pounces vast Destruction makes.<br>  Some fall struck dead, some wounded slowly fly,<br>  While Snowy Clouds of Feathers fill the Sky.<br>  Those that the fierce Invader's Strokes survive,<br>  With all the speed, Fear to their Wings can give;<br>  To their belov'd <i> Cayster</i> 's Banks return,<br>  And in their reedy Seats, their Wounds and Losses mourn.<br>  So far'd the <i> Saxons</i> , and their shatter'd Fleet,<br>  <i> Octa</i>  forthwith Commands his Lords to meet<br>  In Council, where they in long order sate<br>  T'advise, what best might save their threaten'd State.<br>  <br>     <i> Cissa</i>  first spoke, an able Counsellour<br>  Let us assemble all our present power,<br>  And straight advance the <i> Briton</i> s to Attack,<br>  Who to our Arms can small Resistance make.<br>  Sore with their Wounds, and weary with their Toil,<br>  They tempt the <i> Saxons</i>  to an easie Spoil.<br>  Boldly fall on, before their Troops are eas'd,<br>  With Food and Rest, and with Recruits increas'd.<br>  Your Wisdom thus, and Courage will appear,<br>  Who tho defeated, have not learn'd to fear.<br>  The Foe surpriz'd must to your Mercy yield,<br>  Or to their Ships Retreating, quit the Field.<br>  He ceas'd, then <i> Osred</i> , who had always won<br>  By his wise Counsel great Applause, begun:<br>  Our late Defeat has too much Terrour strook,<br>  Thro' all our Troops, too much our Empire shook,<br>  And too much flesh'd the Foe, to let me joyn<br>  In this Advice, my Counsels more incline<br>  To draw into the Field our utmost Power<br>  From all the <i> Saxon</i>  States, and to secure<br>  Our Empire, let us labour to perswade<br>  The <i> Pict</i> , and <i> Scotish</i>  King, to give us Aid.<br>  The Cause and Interest is the same of all,<br>  They and their Gods, if we are crush'd, must fall.<br>  Our Arms united in a numerous Host,<br>  We may before of certain Conquest boast.<br>  The trembling Foe unable to withstand<br>  Such mighty Armies, will forsake the Land.<br>  But if supported with vain hopes they stay,<br>

the shouting Host;<br>  The <i> Briton</i> s rag'd, and thought thier Hero lost;<br>  But he recov'ring from th' amazing Blow,<br>  Collects his Strength to meet the insulting Foe.<br>  His brandish'd Blade fell with prodigious Sway,<br>  And thro' the yielding Cuirasse, forc'd its Way.<br>  The gaping Wound pour'd out a Vital Tyde,<br>  And Crimson Streams his burnish'd Armour dy'd.<br>  <i> Octa</i>  his wounded Body wreaths in Pain,<br>  And viewing on his Limbs the Bloody Stain,<br>  With angry Eyes calls back his Life again.<br>  And then assaults the Foe with doubled Rage,<br>  Who meets his Arms, as eager to engage.<br>  Fresh Strokes, fresh Wounds, they give on either side,<br>  While Vict'ry does for neither Sword decide.<br>  Weak with their Wounds, and with bruis'd Armour pain'd,<br>  An equal, noble Combate they maintain'd.<br>  Feeble and Breathless still they kept the Field,<br>  Unable more their blunted Arms to wield.<br>  <br>     And now the Throng rush'd in, the Combat done<br>  By neither Hero lost, by neither won.<br>  And rending with their Shouts the tortur'd Air,<br>  Back to their Files, the Combatants they bear.<br>  So when two valiant Cocks in <i> Albion</i>  bred,<br>  That from th' insulting Conquerour never fled<br>  A Match in Strength, in Courage, and in Age,<br>  And with keen Weapons arm'd alike Engage;<br>  Each other they assault with furious Beaks,<br>  And their trim'd Plumes distain with bloody Streaks.<br>  Each nimble Warriour from the Pavement bounds,<br>  And wing'd with Death, their Heels deal ghastly Wounds.<br>  By turns they take, by turns fierce Strokes they give,<br>  And with like Hopes and Fears, for Conquest strive.<br>  Both obstinate maintain the Bloody Field,<br>  Both can in Combat dye, but neither yield,<br>  Till with their bleeding Wounds grown weak and faint,<br>  And choak'd with flowing Gore they gasp, and pant.<br>  Disabled on the Crimson Floor they ly,<br>  Both Honour win, but neither Victory.<br>  <br>     Then <i> Morogan</i> , his Javelin in his Hand,<br>  Charg'd the fierce Troops where <i> Ella</i>  did Command.<br>  <i> Wigmunda</i> , first his deadly Weapon felt,<br>  Who on the flowry Banks of <i> Oza</i>  dwelt,<br>  Faln on the ground, the <i> Saxon</i>  groan'd aloud,<br>  And dying, lay deform'd with Dust and Blood.<br>  Next <i> Ethelbright</i>  he slew, the Javelin past,<br>  Thro' the brave Leader's Hand, where sticking fast<br>  He from the Battel fled, and thro' the throng<br>  Complaining loud, trail'd the huge Spear along.<br>  To fight the <i> Briton</i> , <i> Thedred</i>  did advance<br>  And in his Buckler broke his pondrous Lance.<br>  High in the Air the scatter'd pieces flew,<br>  When <i> Morogan</i> , his ample Fauchion drew;<br>  He mist the mighty stroke aim'd at his Crest,<br>  But cleft his Shoulder down into his Chest:<br>  Thro' the prodigious Wound, a Sea of Blood<br>  Spouts from his Veins, and down his Armour flow'd,<br>  Weltring in Gore, upon the Ground he stretcht,<br>  And his last Breath in thick Convulsions fetcht.<br>  Next he his Spear at great <i> Merthellan</i>  throws,<br>  Thro' Breast, and Back, the deadly Weapon goes.<br>  Then warlike <i> Ella</i> , with excessive Rage<br>  All fir'd, advanc'd the <i> Briton</i>  to engage.<br>  As two chaf'd Lyons on a <i> Lybian</i>  Plain,<br>  Contending which shall o'er the Desart reign,<br>  With raging Eyes, and fierce erected Hair,<br>  Scowr o'er the Sands, to meet the horrid War;<br>  So furious <i> Ella</i> , and great <i> Morogan</i> ,<br>  Eager of Conquest, to the Combat ran.<br>  The <i> Saxon</i>  first his massy Javelin flung,<br>  With the vast Stroke, the <i> Briton</i> 's Target rung,<br>  The Temper'd Steel the Weapon did repel,<br>  Which flew aside, and at a Distance fell.<br>  The <i> Briton</i>  next, did his bright Javelin throw,<br>  <i> Ella</i>  his Head inclin'd, eludes the Blow.<br>  <i> Ella</i>  with all his Might his second cast,<br>  Which mist, but stroke the Plume off, as it past<br>  The <i> Briton</i>  stop'd, and lifted from the Field<br>  A pond'rous Stone, which both his Hands did weild,<br>  So vast, that two in our degenerate Days,<br>  Tho Men of Strength, the like can scarcely raise;<br>  With all his Strength he throws the craggy Stone,<br>  Which thro' King <i> Ella</i> 's Leg-piece, crush'd the Bone.<br>  The wounded Warriour fell upon the Plain,<br>  <i> Adda</i>  advanc'd, the Conquerour to Sustain;<br>  While <i> Gomel</i>  with his Men did <i> Ella</i>  bear<br>  From the hot Place of Action, to the Rear,<br>  Where Charioteer, and Steeds, and Chariot stay,<br>  Waiting his coming from the Bloody Day.<br>  Mean time great <i> Morogan</i> , had <i> Adda</i>  slain,<br>  The Spear had thro' his Forehead pierc'd his Brain.<br>  Biting the Ground, th' expiring <i> Saxon</i>  lies,<br>  And Death's unwelcome shade o'erspreads his Eyes.<br>  And with like Courage, and with like Success,<br>  The brave Prince <i> Conan</i>  did the <i> Saxons</i>  press,<br>  Which <i> Osred</i>  led, great Numbers he destroy'd,<br>  Whose putrid Blood, the slipp'ry Field annoy'd.<br>  <i> Sefred</i> , <i> Carantes</i> , <i> Molinoc</i>  he slew,<br>  And <i> Ethelfrid</i> , in Arms surpass'd by few.<br>  <i> Oswy</i> , and <i> Bassa</i> , all of warlike Fame,<br>  And many more, of unrecorded Name.<br>  Thus Valiant <i> Conan</i> , triumph'd in the Field,<br>  And all he met, did to his Courage yield.<br>  Until a sculking, unknown hand, at last<br>  Did unperceiv'd, a pointed Javelin cast:<br>  Deep in his Arm, th' inglorious Weapon goes,<br>  His Wound the Blood upon his Armour shows,<br>  He drew the Steel out, from his bleeding Veins,<br>  And from the Field, retir'd in tort'ring Pains.<br>  <br>     Mean time, out-number'd in another part,<br>  <i> Macoe</i> 's <i> Danmonian</i>  Troops began to start.<br>  <i> Macor</i>  to stop their ignominious Flight,<br>  And give them Spirit to renew the Fight;<br>  Now sharp Reproaches us'd, and bitter Threats,<br>  And now with Prayers he earnestly intreats.<br>  Enrag'd, ashamed, and fearing open Rout,<br>  Exclaiming loud, he wildly flew about.<br>  He stays them with his Hands, and Voice, and Eyes,<br>  And to confirm their sinking Courage, cries,<br>  Whither will my <i> Danmonians</i>  madly run,<br>  And leave behind a Vict'ry almost won?<br>  What pannick Fear does my brave Friends invade?<br>  Till now, you never knew to be afraid.<br>  Think on the Brav'ry you have always shown,<br>  And Laurels you and your great Fathers won.<br>  By their great Deeds, and yours, by <i> Cador</i> 's Name,<br>  By all my Hopes and yours which are the same.<br>  By the <i> Danmonian</i>  Fame, I all conjure<br>  Trust not to Flight, your Arms must you secure.<br>  Who will maintain their Ground, if you recoil?<br>  Thus do you mean to guard your Native Soil?<br>  To what new Seats will you from <i> Albion</i>  fly?<br>  Or will you in the Rocks and Mountains ly?<br>  <i> Briton</i> s return from your inglorous Flight,<br>  Rally your Forces, and renew the Fight.<br>  To Safety, and to Fame the way I'll show,<br>  See, here it lies, across the thickest Foe.<br>  <br>     He said, and straight amidst the Troops he flew,<br>  <i> Osher</i>  the first he met, the first he slew.<br>  He pierc'd his Belly thro' the yielding Shield,<br>  And out his Bowels gush'd upon the Field.<br>  To aid his Friend, constant <i> Eballan</i>  flies,<br>  But wounded by the <i> Briton</i> , with him dies.<br>  Then while <i> Adulphas</i> , <i> Bertham</i> 's Offspring stands,<br>  Poising a pondrous Stone in both his Hands,<br>  The mighty Fragment of a craggy Rock,<br>  And aim'd at <i> Macor</i> 's Head, a deadly Stroke.<br>  Thro' his pierc'd Side the Javelin made its Way,<br>  And buried, in his bleeding Liver lay.<br>  Then you brave Youths, <i> Egbert</i> , and <i> Alopas</i> ,<br>  Both noble Branches of great <i> Horsa</i> 's Race,<br>  Their Age the same, the same their youthful Charms,<br>  Fell in the <i> British</i>  Fields by <i> Macor</i> 's Arms.<br>  This 'twixt the Ribs receiv'd the fatal Dart,<br>  Where transverse Bounds the Breast and Belly part.<br>  Lopt from the Shoulder with a fearful Wound,<br>  T'other's Right Arm lay quivering on the Ground.<br>  <br>     Now the <i> Danmonians</i>   who began to run,<br>  Seeing the Wonders by their Leader done,<br>  With Shame and generous Indignation burn,<br>  And to the War with doubled Rage return.<br>  Then <i> Macor</i>  let his Spear at <i> Redwall</i>  fly<br>  In his bright Chariot, passing swiftly by.<br>  It pass'd his Shield, and went into his Reins,<br>  A Purple Flood, springs from his wounded Veins,<br>  And mixt with Dust, the fervid Wheels detains.<br>  Projected headlong on the Ground he lay,<br>  Fetch'd a deep Groan, and gasp'd his Life away.<br>  With like Success his Men no more afraid,<br>  Of <i> Saxon</i>  Arms, their thickest Files invade.<br>  So when dissolv'd by Summer Rays, the Snow<br>  Do's down the Sides of <i> Alpine</i>  Mountains flow,<br>  Below the several Rills, and Currents joyn,<br>  And different Streams in one great Flood combine.<br>  Then do's the Deluge rear its foaming Head,<br>  O'er-flow the Banks, and o'er the Meadows spread.<br>  No lofty Mounds arrest th' insulting Tide,<br>  But o'er the flowry Vale, the Waves triumphant ride.<br>  So the <i> Danmonian</i>  scatter'd Troops unite,<br>  And with associate Arms, revive the Fight.<br>  <br>     Here to restrain <i> Macor</i> 's victorious Course,<br>  <i> Bartha</i> , oppos'd a fresh collected Force.<br>  From his strong Arm his singing Javelin flew,<br>  And passing thro' his Neck <i> Guitardan</i>  flew.<br>  He hurl'd his Ball of Iron at the Head<br>  Of stout <i> Gomallador</i> , and struck him dead.<br>  His Helm in Pieces flew, his Bones were crash'd.<br>  And from his Scull his Blood and Brains were dash'd.<br>  <i> Macor</i>  incens'd, advances to the Fight,<br>  And pray'd to Heav'n, to guide his Weapon right.<br>  Nor did he pray in vain, th' unerring Dart<br>  Transfixt his Breast, and sunk into his Heart.<br>  Strong <i> Bartha</i>  fell, the Blood his Armour stains,<br>  And shivering Death crept cold along his Veins.<br>  <br>     But to revenge so great a Captain's Fall,<br>  <i> Lothar</i>  aloud does on his <i> Saxons</i>  call.<br>  First Lodoic he flew, who stood the Shock,<br>  Of War before unshaken as a Rock.<br>  Strong <i> Mandubrace</i> , of whom the <i> Briton</i> s tell<br>  Such mighty Deeds, by the brave <i> Saxon</i>  fell.<br>  Beauteous <i> Codunan</i>  the Silurians Pride,<br>  And warlike <i> Hanomer</i>  together dy'd.<br>  Their Leaders brave alike, alike enrag'd,<br>  The <i> Briton</i> s, and the <i> Saxon</i>  close engag'd<br>  An obstinate, and bloody Fight maintain,<br>  And Heaps of Dead, ly thick upon the Plain.<br>  Dark Clouds of Dust thro' th' airy Region fly,<br>  And warlike Noise bounds from the vaulted Sky.<br>  Helms mix with Helms, and Arms with Arms unite<br>  Their bright Reflexion, to oppress the Sight.<br>  Now Man at Man, Squadrons at Squadrons rush,<br>  And Files at Files with Spears protended push.<br>  Swords clash with Swords, Bucklers on Bucklers bray,<br>  And thro' the Field a horrid Din convey.<br>  Slaughter and Death in dreadful Pomp appear,<br>  And Brains, and Gore, the slippery Field besmear:<br>  So when two adverse Tides their Waves advance,<br>  With equal Fury, and with equal Chance;<br>  The foaming Forces, doubtful Fight maintain,<br>  Where both by Turns loose, what by Turns they gain.<br>  On this Side now retreats the vanquish'd Tide,<br>  And on its back th' insulting Billows ride.<br>  Rallying its roaring Troops with swift Career,<br>  It soon returns, and reassumes the War.<br>  The Conquerour before is forc'd to yield,<br>  And rolling back its Waves deserts the Field.<br>  Alternate Conquest, and alternate Flight,<br>  Between the Foes prolong a doubtful Fight.<br>  So thick the Troops, so fast and close were prest,<br>  The wedg'd Battalions standing Breast to Breast,<br>  They scarce have space their Hands or Arms to move,<br>  But like contending Waves each other shove.<br>  Here <i> Macor</i>  urges, presses, and invades,<br>  Here <i> Lothar</i>  stops him with his strong Brigades.<br>  Equal in Arms, in Beauty, and in Age,<br>  But not allow'd each other to engage.<br>  On both the valiant Youths a different Fate,<br>  From a far greater Foe does shortly wait.<br>  <br>     King <i> Cerdick</i>  then advanc'd exclaiming loud<br>  And with his rapid Chariot cuts the Crowd.<br>  And to the Troops that stopt his way, he cry'd<br>  Open to right and left, your Ranks divide,<br>  <i> Macor</i>  and I this Contest will decide.<br>  Nor did the <i> Saxon</i>  Troops his Will oppose,<br>  But open, and an ample Space disclose.<br>  Then leaping to the Ground his pondrous Oak,<br>  Pointed with polish'd Steel, he threatning shook.<br>  At such a Sight th' amaz'd <i> Danmonians</i>  start,<br>  And their chill Blood congeal'd about their Heart.<br>  <i> Macor</i>  undaunted, traverses the Ground,<br>  And at the <i> Saxon</i>  aims a fatal Wound.<br>  Then thro' the Air his Spear projected flew,<br>  And from its Sheath his flaming Sword he drew.<br>  The Buckler's Brims the glancing Weapons raz'd<br>  And flying off, on the right Shoulder graz'd.<br>  Then <i> Cerdick</i> 's Javelin pois'd, and aim'd with Care,<br>  Flew from his Arm, and hissing cut the Air.<br>  Who cry'd out as it went, go swiftly fly,<br>  And the hard Metal of his Armour try.<br>  While <i> Cerdick</i>  thus insults th' impetuous Oak,<br>  Thro' Buckler, Coat of Mail and Cuirass broke,<br>  And pierc'd his Breast where the deep Springs abide,<br>  Whence Life leaps out upon its circ'ling Tide.<br>  The Vital Streams thro' his bruis'd Armour spout,<br>  While he in vain wrests the warm Weapon out.<br>  After the parting Dart, together crowd<br>  From the wide Wound, his Soul, and Life, and Blood.<br>  He fell, his Arms upon his Armour rung,<br>  And Death in cold Embraces round him clung.<br>  Thus fell the brave <i> Danmonian</i>  who had slain,<br>  Such Numbers pil'd on Heaps upon the Plain.<br>  His Friends with Sighs, and Tears upon a Sheild,<br>  Bear his Pale Corps off from the bloody Field.<br>  <br>     <i> Cerdic</i>  his Weapon warm with <i> Macor</i> 's Blood,<br>  Advanc'd with Fury not to be withstood.<br>  With his drawn Sword he does the Foe invade,<br>  And midst their Ranks prodigious Havock made.<br>  The <i> Briton</i> s all enrage'd at <i> Macor</i> 's Fall,<br>  With Showers of Darts the raging <i> Saxon</i>  gaul.<br>  On every Side the Monarch they assail,<br>  With thick Brigades, but cannot yet prevail.<br>  As when a mighty Stag, that long had stood,<br>  The unmolested Monarch of the Wood,<br>  Safe in its Coverts, and protecting Shade,<br>  Against the Foe, that would his Peace invade:<br>  If at an ancient Oak, he stands at last<br>  At Bay, by furious Dogs too closely chas'd;<br>  Fearless he looks and to his clam'rous Foes,<br>  Does his thick Grove of Native Arms oppose.<br>  The Dogs with distant Cries infest his Ears,<br>  And from afar the Huntsmen cast their Spears.<br>  None daring to approach the generous Beast,<br>  Project aloof their Darts against his Breast,<br>  Thus <i> Cerdick</i>  stood, nor dar'd the boldest Knight,<br>  Advance to undertake a closer Fight.<br>  They cast their Darts at distance, and from far<br>  Shower on his brazen Shield a ratling War.<br>  With their loud Cries the ambient Air they rend,<br>  And raging, all their missive Weapons, spend.<br>  <br>     Mean time around, King <i> Cerdick</i> 's Jav'lins flew,<br>  And <i> Arthur</i> s Men, with vast Destruction slew.<br>  <i> Cadwan</i>  he kill'd, whose Arms great Fame had won,<br>  And <i> Vortiger</i>  great <i> Ganumara</i> 's Son.<br>  <br>  Then <i> Vogan</i>  fell and <i> Ottocar</i>  who trace<br>  Their high Descent from <i> Hoel</i> 's ancient Race.<br>  Great Numbers dy'd where the chaf'd <i> Saxon</i>  flew,<br>  And with his Sword cut his wide Passage thro'<br>  So when a generous Bull for Clowns Delight,<br>  Stands with his Line restrain'd prepar'd for Fight.<br>  Hearing the Youths loud Clamours, and the Rage,<br>  Of barking Mastives eager to engage.<br>  He snuffs the Air, and paws the trembling Ground,<br>  Views all the Ring, and proudly walks it round.<br>  Defiance lowring on his brinded Brows,<br>  Around disdainful Looks, the grisly Warriour throws.<br>  His haughty Head inclin'd with easie Scorn,<br>  Th' invading Foe high in the Air is born,<br>  Tost from the Combatant's victorious Horn.<br>  Rais'd to the Clouds, the sprawling Mastives fly,<br>  And add new Monsters to th' affrighted Sky.<br>  The clam'rous Youth, to aid each other call,<br>  On their broad Backs to break their Fav'rites fall.<br>  Some stretcht out on the Field lie dead and some<br>  Dragging their Entrails on, run howling Home.<br>  But if at last on all Sides he's engag'd,<br>  By fresh and fiercer Foes, strait all enrag'd<br>  He flies about, some with his Horns He gores,<br>  Some strikes, and mov'd with Indignation roars.<br>  With Disproportion'd Numbers prest at length,<br>  He breaks his Chain collecting all his Strength.<br>  Then Dogs and Masters scar'd promiscuous fly,<br>  And fal'n in Heaps, the pale Spectators ly.<br>  He walks in Triumph, nods his conquering Head,<br>  And proudly views the Spoils about him spread.<br>  <br>  <i> Hyalca</i>  fell, a Lord of <i> Neustrian</i>  Birth,<br>  Struggling with Death, he bites the hostile Earth.<br>  <i> Rivollan</i>  dies, the brave <i> Armorican</i> ,<br>  Who swifter than a driving Tempest ran.<br>  <i> Mador</i> , not daring <i> Cerdick</i>  to engage<br>  Fled from his Post to scape the Conquerors Rage.<br>  <i> Cerdick</i>  pursu'd him close, exclaiming loud,<br>  And to o'ertake him, breaks th' opposing Crowd.<br>  As when a Lyon on the Mountains spies,<br>  A well grown Stag, his furious Bristles rise,<br>  And yawning horribly, with Hunger prest,<br>  Away he flies to tear the trembling Beast.<br>  He leaps upon him with his dreadful Paws,<br>  And buries in his Sides his fearful Jaws.<br>  So raging <i> Cerdick</i>  flew faln <i> Mador</i>  dies,<br>  And everlasting Night shuts up his Eyes.<br>  <br>     <i> Ludvalla</i> , from the high <i> Silurian</i>  Hills<br>  <i> Eldubert</i>  flew, <i> Poel</i>  <i> Edella</i>  kills,<br>  <i> Chelrick</i>  <i> Adarc</i> , <i> Tudor</i>  pierc'd <i> Alwy</i>  thro',<br>  <i> Oswoll</i>  <i> Pricarden</i> , <i> Oven</i>  <i> Kensey</i>  flew.<br>  <i> Bladoc</i>  kills <i> Athelmar</i>  in single Fight<br>  Of goodly Stature, and a Valiant Knight.<br>  <i>

had reach'd Prince <i> Arthur</i> 's Ear,<br>  That his lov'd <i> Macor</i>  dy'd by <i> Cerdick</i> 's Spear.<br>  No Tydings more his Fury could provoke,<br>  Or strike into his Breast a deeper Stroke.<br>  His Looks reveal'd his Wound, and Grief, and Rage,<br>  His conquering Arms in deep Revenge engage.<br>  With his refulgent Sword he hew'd his way,<br>  Like grass mown down the

at <i> Kenfred</i>  was design'd,<br>  Who stooping down the hissing Death declin'd.<br>  Then at the Conq'rour's Feet he prostrate falls,<br>  And in sad Accents for Compassion calls.<br>  Spare,

this does not depend your Empire's Fate,<br>  Nor can my Life or Death affect your State,<br>  <br>     He said to whom the <i> British</i>  Prince reply'd,<br>  The Silver and the Gold your Cellars hide,<br>  You to your Sons and Daughters must bequeath,<br>  Expect your self, the present Stroke of Death.<br>  That said, he took his Helmet by the Crest,<br>  And drawing back his Head, into his Breast<br>  Up to the Hilts, he plung'd his fatal Sword,<br>  And from the Wound a crimson River pour'd.<br>  <i> Colmar</i>  hard by <i> Odin</i> 's and <i> Frea</i> 's Priest,<br>  Distinguish'd by his Dress, from all the rest,<br>  And by the Garland round his Temples known,<br>  In glitt'ring Arms, and splendid Garments shone.<br>  Up flew his Heels while from the Field he fled,<br>  <i> Nazaleod</i>  set his Foot, upon his Head,<br>  And stroke into the Ground quite thro' his Breast<br>  His pointed Spear, and his rich Spoils possest.<br>  Then <i> Arthur</i>  with his Spear, pierc'd Rufa thro',<br>  Then <i> Osmor</i> , <i> Seward</i>  <i> Ethellar</i>  he flew<br>  <i> Osa</i>  <i> Beorno</i> , <i> Kendred</i> , <i> Ediswall</i> ,<br>  <i> Penda</i> , <i> Kenelmar</i> , <i> Osbert</i> , <i> Ethelbal</i> .<br>  Pale <i> Oswald</i>  fled, the Conq'rour to prevent,<br>  But thro' his Back the swifter Javelin went.<br>  His flaming Sword, did ne'er in vain descend<br>  But sure Destruction did its Sway attend.<br>  The reeking Conquerour in Triumph reign'd,<br>  Glutted with Slaughter, and with Blood distain'd.<br>  Th'unnumber'd Dead, that round the <i> Briton</i>  lay<br>  More than their living Troops, obstruct his way.<br>  To reach their Men, that from his Fury fled,<br>  He climbs their slaughter'd Piles, and scales the Dead.<br>  Sometimes the <i> Saxons</i>  with new Fury burn,<br>  And rallying Squadrons to the War return:<br>  They pour around the Prince their numerous Swarms,<br>  And strive to crush him with unequal Arms.<br>  As when

collected gathers greater Force,<br>  Breaks out in Flames, and with impetuous Course<br>  From the Cloud's gaping Womb in Light'ning flies,<br>  Flashing in ruddy Streaks, along the Skies.<br>  So <i> Arthur</i> 's flaming Sword cuts thro' the Cloud,<br>  Around him spread, and rends th' opposing Crowd.<br>  With daz'ling Arms, he flies upon the Foe,<br>  Flashes amidst the throngs, and terribly Thunders thro'.<br>  <i> Authum</i>  and <i> Alfrid</i> , with fresh Troops sustain,<br>  Their stagg'ring Squadrons, and the War maintain,<br>  To these Prince <i> Arthur</i>  wing'd with Fury flew<br>  And first stout <i> Alfrid</i>  with his Spear he flew.<br>  Thro the left Groin, the Weapon made its Way,<br>  And stretcht along the Ground, the bleeding <i> Saxon</i>  lay.<br>  At <i> Authum</i> 's Crest he dealt a furious Stroke,<br>  The <i> Saxon</i>  totter'd at th' amazing Shock,<br>  And fell upon his Knee, and while he pray'd<br>  And for his Life would many Things have said,<br>  His sever'd Head off, from his Shoulders flies,<br>  And bounded on the Field, his Body lies<br>  At a great Distance, quivering on the Ground,<br>  And Streams of Blood spring from his ghastly Wound.<br>  As when the Summers Soultry Heats, draw forth,<br>  Th'exhaling Moisture from the thirsty Earth,<br>  When scorching Rays the gaping Plains have fry'd,<br>  And from their Banks contracted Streams subside.<br>  If then a Fire invades a spaeious Wood,<br>  Where Ancient Oaks have long securely stood;<br>  The conquering Flames advance with lawless Power,<br>  And with contagious Heat the Trees devour.<br>  The spreading Burning lays the Forrest waste,<br>  And sooty Spoils lie smoaking where it past.<br>  So <i> Arthur</i>  with  resistless Rage around,<br>  Destroys and loads with slaughter'd Heaps the Ground.<br>  Next did the Prince at bold <i> Edburga</i>  aim,<br>  Who from the fertile Banks of <i> Abum</i>  came<br>  Prince <i> Unna</i> 's Son to vast Possessions born,<br>  Broad Flowers of Gold his shining Coat adorn,<br>  The piercing Steel deep in his Bosom sunk,<br>  And Life's pure Stream at the warm Fountain drunk,<br>  His Arms did next valiant <i> Titullan</i>  meet,<br>  Who fell and quiver'd at the Conquerour's Feet.<br>  <i> Osrick</i>  and beauteous <i> Hengist</i>  next appear,<br>  The first his Fauchion slew, the last his Spear.<br>  Next stout <i> Eldanor</i>  did his Fate provoke,<br>  And off his Head flew, at a single Stroke.<br>  And next he threw at <i> Labert</i> , as he fled<br>  The Weapon struck him, as he

engag'd.<br>  Therefore in Arms I did my Limbs disguise,<br>  And undertook this dangerous Enterprize,<br>  That if he rashly sought, so great a Foe,<br>  I might between him, and your fatal Blow,<br>  My Bosom interpose, and in my Heart<br>  To save his dearer Life, receive the Dart.<br>  Or if Occasion were, to intercede,<br>  As now I do, and for his Safety plead.<br>  <br>     I pray by all

feather'd Tempests fly,<br>  Darts hiss at Darts, encountring in the Sky.<br>  A dreadful Noise distracting all the Air,<br>  Came from the hoarce <i> Cerberean</i>  Throat of War.<br>  While Arms on Arms, Bucklers on Bucklers ring,<br>  Swords clash with Swords, and flying Javelins sing.<br>  Some threaten loud, while some for Quarter cry,<br>  And some insult, while some in Torment dy.<br>  As when a Torrent down some Mountain's Side,<br>  To the low Valleys rolls its rapid Tide,<br>  Where mighty Stones and rocky Fragments, high<br>  Within the rude, unfashion'd Channels ly.<br>  O'er abrupt Tracks its Course the Deluge bends,<br>  And roaring down with mighty Falls, descends.<br>  Prodigious Noise th' Aerial Region fills,<br>  The Shepherds hear, and tremble on their Hills.<br>  Or as<br>  When high <i> Vesuvius</i>  stow'd with wealthy Stores,<br>  Preluding to some dire Irruption, roars;<br>  While horrible Convulsions shake its Womb,<br>  And lab'ring Sides, which hidden

's wealthy Farmers quake.<br>  Such was the loud distracting Noise of War,<br>  Such horrid Clamours tore th' afflicted Air,<br>  While the fierce Foes against each other rag'd,<br>  And for <i>

Horse unshaken as a Rock,<br>  Bravely sustain'd th' Invader's thundring Shock.<br>  King <i> Meridoc</i>  who did the Horse command<br>  Confirm'd his Men, to make so brave a stand.<br>  Yet many valiant <i> Briton</i> s <i> Mordred</i>  slew,<br>  First with his Spear he pierc'd brave Jasper thro.<br>  The Valiant <i> Giffith</i>  by unhappy Chance,<br>  Came in his Way, and felt his fatal Launce.<br>  Beneath his Ear, the Weapon pierc'd his Head,<br>  He fell, and in a Moment stretcht out dead.<br>  His furious Arm noble <i> Lodanar</i>  felt<br>  On whose high Crest so fierce a stroke he dealt,<br>  The <i> Briton</i>  stun'd with the prodigious Blow,<br>  Drops the loos'd Reins, and lets his Weapons go.<br>  The frighted Courser thro the Battel Flies,<br>  <i> Lodanor</i>  in the Dust dismounted lies.<br>  The Horses Hoofs in pieces crush his Head,<br>  And deep into the Mire his Bowels tread.<br>  Then with great Fury he at <i> Adel</i>  flew,<br>  And grip'd him with his furious Hand, and drew<br>  The <i> Briton</i>  from his Seat, his fiery Steed<br>  Scours o'er the Field, from his lost Rider freed.<br>  Wrigling and spurning in his Arms the Prey<br>  'Midst loud

mounts, and squeaks amidst the Skies<br>  And faster than he ran before, he flies.<br>  <br>     To fight the <i> Pict</i>  straight <i> Guinan</i>  did advance<br>  But in his Shield broke his projected Launce.<br>  Then at the <i> Briton</i>  <i> Mordred</i> 's Javelin flew<br>  It mist the Rider, but the Courser slew.<br>  Extended on the Ground the groaning Beast,<br>  Th' unhappy Rider with his Weight opprest.<br>  <i> Mordred</i>  dismounts, and with his glitt'ring Dart<br>  Loudly insulting, stabs him to the Heart.<br>  <i> Guinan</i>  a Friend to <i> Meridoc</i>  was dear<br>  Who at his Death enrag'd caught up his Spear,<br>  And shaking it from far, with mighty Rage,<br>  Spurs thro' their Ranks King <i> Mordred</i>  to engage.<br>  The <i> Pictan</i>  Monarch who elated stood,<br>  Like some tall Oak, that overlooks the Wood,<br>  Or some high Tower, which with its lofty Head<br>  Surveys the Towns beneath, around it spread,<br>  Lifts his Gigantick Spear, and cry'd aloud,<br>  To <i> Meridoc</i>  advancing thro' the Crowd,<br>  <i> Briton</i>  come on, and but a Moment stand,<br>  A glorious Fate expect from <i> Mordred</i> 's Hand.<br>  Let not thy Fears

<i> Mordred</i>  threw, aloft the Weapon hist,<br>  <i> Ludar</i>  it slew, but <i> Meridoc</i>  it mist.<br>  Brave <i> Ludar</i>  was a Lord of <i> Neustrian</i>  Blood,<br>  Who long in vain the fair <i> Marinda</i>  woo'd.<br>  To bless him with her Smiles, and heal his Wound,<br>  But from the scornful Maid no Pity found:<br>  Lost in Despair, he left his native Soil,<br>  His Torments to beguile with Martial Toil.<br>  Now wounded by an erring Spear, he lies<br>  Cry'd out <i> Marinda</i> , cruel Fate! and dies.<br>  <br>     Then did the <i> Briton</i> 's second Weapon fly<br>  Which thro' his Armour, pierc'd King <i> Mordred</i> 's Thigh.<br>  Which from the Flesh he strove to draw in vain,<br>  Then flew about wreckt with Tormenting Pain.<br>  Wildly he star'd, and turn'd his Courser's Head,<br>  Aloud he roar'd, and from the Combat fled.<br>  So when a Sword-Fish, urg'd with generous Rage,<br>  Does a vast Whale, in Northern Seas engage.<br>  The Finny Warriors, with a furious Course<br>  To Battel rush, and meet with wondrous Force.<br>  A Noble Fight ensues, and dreadful Strokes<br>  Afflict the Main, and shake the neighb'ring Rocks.<br>  As they advance, they drive high Seas before,<br>  The Monsters bellow, and the Billows roar.<br>  The boiling Sea, with greater Fury raves,<br>  Then when incumbent Storms press on its Waves.<br>  The Surges raging with intestine War,<br>  With high, curl'd Heads, look terrible from far.<br>  The Foam of breaking Waves, in pointed Sleet<br>  Like driven Snow does on the Ocean beat.<br>  At every Shock the dashing

Flies thro' the Foe, himself a fearful War.<br>  With his victorious Sword, which wav'd on high,<br>  Made flaming Bows, and Arches in the Sky.<br>  The Body of their Battel he invades,<br>  And thro' a Sea of Blood victorious wades.<br>  Where'er the Conqu'ror did his progress bend,<br>  Ruin and wide Destruction did attend.<br>  Prodigious Numbers by his Weapons fall,<br>  And on their Gods in vain the <i> Saxons</i>  call.<br>  He made his way, like an impetuous Flood,<br>  Or furious Burning, raging thro' the Wood<br>  Where'er he pass'd the Dead lay thick behind,<br>  As sapless Leaves, spread by a boistrous Wind.<br>  <br>     <i> Ussina</i>  first a valiant Lord did feel<br>  In his left Side, the <i> Briton</i> 's piercing steel.<br>  Next <i> Godred</i>  fell from valiant <i>

left Eye from out its Circle struck,<br>  On the sharp Point, a ghastly Prospect stuck.<br>  Then <i> Ethelrick</i>  a stout west <i> Saxon</i>  Lord,<br>  And <i> Ida</i>  fell, by his victorious Sword.<br>  The first his Head down to his Shoulders cleft,<br>  Fell to the Ground, of Breath and sense bereft.<br>  The heavy Blade falling with oblique Sway,<br>  Half thro' the other's Neck, did make its way.<br>  The Head half sever'd on his Shoulders hung,<br>  And from the Wound a bloody Torrent sprung.<br>  Rolling in Gore upon the Field he lay,<br>  Wildly he star'd, and groan'd his life away,<br>  As when a mighty Tempest from the East,<br>  The Sea assail'd, and on the Billows prest<br>  By Heav'n's Command, that <i> Jacob</i> 's Fav'rite Race,<br>  Might <i> Pharaoh</i> 's Arms

Leaders took their proper Place.<br>  <br>     Then their Attention <i> Octa</i>  did demand,<br>  And leaning on his Scepter with his Hand,<br>  He thus began, Princes, you see the Field<br>  To the victorious <i> Briton</i> s still we yield.<br>  By Sea, and Land we've felt their fatal Arms,<br>  And all our Realm trembles at their Alarms.<br>  Our Heaps of Dead the Field with Horrour crown,<br>  And Seas of <i> Saxon</i>  Blood the Valley drown.<br>  All <i> Albion</i> 's Isle resounds with dying Groans,<br>  White with her Rocks, but whiter with our Bones.<br>  Prince <i> Arthur</i> 's Sword the Field with Ruin spreads,<br>  Like Storms, which from the Trees dishonour'd Heads<br>  Their shady Leaves, and spreading Branches tear,<br>  Cover the Ground, and leave the Forrest bare.<br>  On us th' offended Gods severely frown,<br>  But on the <i> British</i>  Arms look smiling down.<br>  While we oppose the rapid Tide of Fate,<br>  We think to stop what we precipitate,<br>  And learn our Errour, at too dear a Rate.<br>  He said, the <i> Saxon</i>  Chiefs, who found their Host<br>  Feeble, and sunk by frequent Battels lost:<br>  Thinking their Arms unable to oppose,<br>  The rapid Course of their victorious Foes:<br>  Upon <i> Pascentius</i>  straightway cast their Eyes,<br>  As one above the rest accounted wise,<br>  And who the King to Peace did still advise.<br>  <br>     <i> Pascentius</i>  then began.<br>  <i> Octa</i> , the Counsel which at first I gave<br>  From <i> Arthur</i> 's Arms our threaten'd State to save;<br>  What since has happen'd, shows was just and right:<br>  For who can meet the <i> British</i>  Prince in Fight?<br>  Our sinking State, and hard Affairs demand<br>  A Remedy of Force, and near at Hand.<br>  He that in such a Storm, would safely steer,<br>  Must have a Head that's steady, cool, and clear.<br>  'The lab'ring Ship on all sides feels dire shocks,<br>  <i> Charybdis</i>  shun'd, she's dash'd on <i> Scylla</i> 's Rocks.<br>  Tis hard to give a Monarch Counsel where<br>  On either Hand such frightful shelves appear.<br>  Statesmen, in such a Case as this debate<br>  How best to save themselves, and not the state.<br>  But if my Judgment still I must declare,<br>  I would at any Price compose the War.<br>  And till a more effectual can be found,<br>  This as a safe Expedient I propound.<br>  Sore with their Wounds, and sunk with ill success,<br>  The <i> Saxons</i>  strong Desires for Peace express.<br>  This to obtain, we must to <i> Arthur</i>  sue,<br>  And the first Treaty, which we broke, renew.<br>  The Princess <i> Ethelina</i> 's Heav'nly Charms,<br>  Are only stronger, than the <i> Briton</i> 's Arms.<br>  She must be offer'd, as the Prince's Bride,<br>  This once prevail'd, and must again be try'd.<br>  But then you break the Promise, that you made<br>  To <i> Tollo</i> , who'll complain he is betray'd.<br>  Since hence to Peace, our chief Obstructions spring,<br>  I move that <i> Arthur</i> , and th' <i> Albanian</i>  King,<br>  May by their single Arms the strife decide,<br>  And let the Princess be the Conqueror's Bride.<br>  If o'er the <i> Briton</i> s we th' Advantage gain,<br>  And <i> Arthur</i>  by th' <i> Albanian</i>  King is slain.<br>  The <i> Briton</i> s shall repass <i> Sabrina</i> 's Tide,<br>  And in their Rocks, and Hilly Lands abide.<br>  But all the Cities, Castles, and the Land,<br>  That lie on this side, <i> Octa</i>  shall command.<br>  But if King <i> Tollo</i>  slain by <i> Arthur</i> 's Sword,<br>  New Triumphs to the <i> Briton</i>  shall afford;<br>  We'll meet no more their Armies in the Field,<br>  But all our Towns, and conquer'd Places yield.<br>  Those who shall ask it, shall be wafted o'er,<br>  To our old seats along the <i> German</i>  shore:<br>  The <i> Cantian</i>  Kingdom still we will retain,<br>  And in its Limits circumscrib'd remain.<br>  This, as the best Expedient, I propose,<br>  He said, the <i> Saxons</i>  murmur'd their Applause.<br>  <br>     Then <i> Tollo</i>  answer'd with a haughty Air,<br>  Pleas'd with my Fate, I undertake the War.<br>  My Sword and <i> Arthur</i> 's shall the Strife decide,<br>  And let the Princess be the Victor's Bride.<br>  This conquering Arm the <i> Saxon</i>  Realm shall guard,<br>  Repell the Foe, and win the bright Reward.<br>  For if the Foe does not my Sword decline,<br>  The War is ended, with his Fall or mine.<br>  <br>     Th' Assembly rose, and back the Captains went,<br>  Praising King <i> Tollo</i>  much, but fear'd th' Event.<br>  At the first opening of the tender Day,<br>  Six Orators King <i> Octa</i>  sent away.<br>  To <i> Arthur</i> 's Camp, who introduc'd declare,<br>  The Measures taken to compose the War.<br>  The Challenge <i> Arthur</i>  heard with great Delight,<br>  And readily accepts the single Fight.<br>  <br>     Straight to the sacred Temples all repair,<br>  Heav'n to solicite with united Prayer,<br>  That <i> Arthur</i>  in the Combate might succeed,<br>  And vanquish'd <i> Tollo</i> , by his Weapon bleed.<br>  With warmer Zeal, and with more earnest Cries,<br>  The <i> Briton</i> s never importun'd the Skies.<br>  A deep Concern at Heart they all exprest,<br>  And mighty Passions struggled in their Breast.<br>  For if the Prince fell in the Combat, all<br>  Well knew their unsupported State must fall.<br>  <br>     Soon as the Sun had streak'd the Skies with Light,<br>  Prince <i> Arthur</i>  rose; and Arm'd himself for fight.<br>  Peices with silver Studs his Legs encas'd,<br>  And Plates of Gold his warlike Thighs embrac'd.<br>  And on his Head he lac'd his burnish'd Helm,<br>  Whence flashing Brightness did the Sight o'erwhelm.<br>  Like some Celestial Orb his blazing Shield,<br>  Darted amazing Lustre thro' the Field.<br>  And then he girded to his Martial Side,<br>  His faithful Sword, so oft in Battel try'd.<br>  Thus arm'd the Hero mounts his thundring Steed,<br>  Nor <i> Thrace</i> , nor <i> Greece</i>  can boast a nobler Breed.<br>  With his strong Arm he grip'd his trembling Spear,<br>  His very Friends, tho pleas'd, yet seem'd to fear.<br>  And as he spurr'd his Courser, and advanc'd,<br>  Unsufferable Splendour from his Armour glanc'd.<br>  As glorious <i> Michael</i> , when the Foe alarms<br>  The blissful Realms, clad in Celestial Arms,<br>  Bright as the Sun, leads forth th' Angelick Host,<br>  To chase th' Invaders from the Heav'nly Coast,<br>  In such illustrious Arms the Prince was seen,<br>  His warlike Grace was such, and such his Godlike Mien.<br>  <br>     Mean time King <i> Octa</i>  from his Camp proceeds,<br>  High in his Chariot, drawn by milk white Steeds.<br>  And by his Side, <i> Tollo</i> , appear'd in sight,<br>  Compleatly arm'd, and coveting the Fight.<br>  His Coat of Mail was o'er his Shoulders flung,<br>  And by his side his dreadful Fauchion hung.<br>  Like a high Beacon lighted in the Air,<br>  His Buckler flam'd, denouncing horrid War.<br>  In his right Hand he shakes his pondrous Launce,<br>  And on his Steed did to the Lists advance.<br>  The Marshals of the Field had markt out Ground<br>  Fit for the Fight, and fixt high Pales around.<br>  Which with arm'd Troops, on either side were lin'd,<br>  Their Spears stuck in the Ground, their Shields reclin'd.<br>  On either Side the Armies stood in sight,<br>  Drawn up, as they two were design'd for Fight.<br>  <br>     Attended with his Heralds on the Place,<br>  Prince <i> Arthur</i>  first appear'd with Martial Grace.<br>  When <i> Octa</i>  and his Priests advancing near,<br>  Raising his Voice that those around might hear.<br>  His Hand devoutly on his Breast, his Eyes<br>  Fixt in a solemn Manner on the Skies;<br>  To ratifie the Treaty, thus he swore,<br>  Th' Eternal Mind whom Christians do adore,<br>  The God of Truth I here to witness call,<br>  That if this Day by <i> Tollo</i> 's Arms I fall,<br>  We will no more Hostilities repeat,<br>  But o'er Sabrina's Waters will retreat.<br>  We will no more the <i> Saxon</i>  State molest,<br>  But in our Hills and snowy Mountains rest.<br>  But if we find this an auspicious Day,<br>  And by Heaven's Aid, my Arms shall <i> Tollo</i>  slay;<br>  Then if the vanquish'd <i> Saxons</i>  shall restore<br>  The Towns and Lands, which we possest before,<br>  They in the <i> Cantian</i>  Kingdom shall reside,<br>  And unmolested in those Bounds abide.<br>  <br>     Then did King <i> Octa</i>  by an Altar stand,<br>  Rais'd with Green Turf, and on it laid his Hand.<br>  And thus his Idols he invok'd.<br>  <i> Irmansul</i>  <i> God</i>  of Arms, and mighty <i> Jove</i> ,<br>  <i> Tuisco</i> , <i> Odin</i> , all ye Powers above,<br>  And you green Gods, and blew-ey'd Goddesses,<br>  Who rule the spacious Empire of the Seas.<br>  And you tremendous Powers, who all resort,<br>  At <i> Pluto</i> 's Summons, to th' Infernal Court:<br>  Ye rural Gods, who rule the Hills and Woods,<br>  Ye watry Powers, who dive beneath the Floods.<br>  By gloomy <i> Styx</i>  I swear, bear witness all,<br>  That if King <i> Tollo</i>  does in Combate fall,<br>  The Treaty now agreed to, shall be kept,<br>  The <i> Cantian</i>  Kingdom only we except,<br>  All other Lands, our once victorious Sword,<br>  Won from the <i> British</i>  Kings, shall be restor'd.<br>  He who shall Conquerour in the Field remain,<br>  Shall for his Bride fair <i> Ethelina</i>  gain.<br>  <br>     He said, and to confirm the Oath he swore,<br>  He drew his Sword, that by his Side he wore:<br>  And with its Point did his full Veins divide,<br>  And let out from his Arm, the Crimson Tide.<br>  A golden Bowl receiv'd the vital Flood,<br>  Which <i> Octa</i>  took, and drank the flowing Blood.<br>  <br>     <i> Arthur</i>  and <i> Tollo</i>  now themselves prepare,<br>  By a brave Combate to decide the War.<br>  The Martials, Heralds, and the Fecial Priests<br>  The Ceremonies finish'd, clear the Lists.<br>  Then the loud Trumpet's Clangour did invite,<br>  The mighty Warriours to begin the Fight.<br>  Both in their Hands grasping their pointed Launce,<br>  Spur their hot Steeds, and to the War advance.<br>  And now the Combatants approach'd so near,<br>  Their Voices rais'd, they might each other hear.<br>  <br>     Then <i> Tollo</i>  cry'd aloud<br>  Till now distress'd without a Friend or Home,<br>  In forraign Lands, you did an Exile roam,<br>  Here stop your Course, your Soul mean time shall go,<br>  A wandring Exile to the Shades below.<br>  I'll take off with this Sword your gasping Head,<br>  And in your Spoils, fair <i> Ethelina</i>  wed.<br>  Were you brave <i> Hector</i> , or his braver Foe,<br>  Or Godlike <i> Hercules</i> , I'd stand your Blow.<br>  Did you advance, with Thunder in your Hand,<br>  Against your Bolts I would undaunted stand.<br>  But such a mighty Foe I need not fear,<br>  You bear not such a Shield, nor such a Spear.<br>  Oh! that bright <i> Ethelina</i>  now stood by,<br>  To see her Lover, and my Rival dy.<br>  Thus boastful <i> Tollo</i>  did his Choler vent,<br>  And thus in Air his empty Threats were spent.<br>  The pious Prince enrag'd, without Reply,<br>  Shakes his long Spear, and hastes to Victory.<br>  As when a roaming Lyon from a far,<br>  Sees a strong Bull stand threat'ning furious War,<br>  Who flourishes his Horns, looks sowrly round,<br>  And hoarcely bellowing, traverses the Ground.<br>  For want of Foes, he does the Wood provoke,<br>  Runs his curl'd Head against the next tall Oak,<br>  Wishing a nobler Object of his Stroke.<br>  The Lyon fir'd, regards him with Disdain,<br>  And to insult him scowrs along the Plain.<br>  So <i> Arthur</i>  boyling with Heroic Rage,<br>  Springs with a full Carrier, King <i> Tollo</i>  to engage.<br>  Collected in himself th' <i> Albanian</i>  stood,<br>  Like some tall, shady Pine, it self a Wood,<br>  Or a vast Cyclops wading thro' the Flood.<br>  <br>     Then <i> Tollo</i>  first, <i> Arthur</i>  advancing near,<br>  With all his Force casts his long Ashen Spear.<br>  Which <i> Arthur</i>  on his temper'd Buckler took,<br>  While with the vast concern the <i> Briton</i> s shook.<br>  Thro' the first Plate of Brass the Weapon went,<br>  But in the next its dying Force was spent.<br>  Then from his valiant Arm the <i> Briton</i>  threw,<br>  His Javelin, singing thro' the Air it flew.<br>  The yielding Buckler did its Force obey,<br>  And thro' the Plates, and Hide it made its Way.<br>  Thro' the thin Joynts of Steel the Spear did fly,<br>  And wounded, as it past, his mighty Thigh.<br>  The Blood sprung thro' his Armour, from the Wound,<br>  And trickling down the Plate, distain'd the Ground.<br>  <br>     Then did King <i> Tollo</i> 's second Weapon fly,<br>  Which broke within the Buckler's second Ply.<br>  The <i> British</i>  Prince another Weapon threw,<br>  Which, <i> Tollo</i>  stooping, o'er his Shoulders flew.<br>  And falling went so deep upon the Ground,<br>  No Arm, of Force to draw it out, was found.<br>  These Weapons spent, to end the noble Fight,<br>  The furious Warriours from their Steeds alight.<br>  And as they nimbly leapt upon the Ground,<br>  The most undaunted Chiefs that stood around,<br>  So fearful was the Chinck their Armour made,<br>  Started, as Men surpriz'd, and look'd afraid.<br>  Then furious Strokes on either Side they deal,<br>  The ecchoing Air rings with the dreadful Peal.<br>  Pale with the vast Concern both Armies look, <br>  And for their Champion's Life with Terrour shook.<br>  So when two vig'rous Stags, each of his Herd<br>  The haughty Lord, thro' all the Forrest fear'd,<br>  Resolv'd to try which must in Combate yield,<br>  In all their Might advance across the Field;<br>  They nod their lofty Heads, and from a far<br>  Flourish their Horns, preluding to the War.<br>  The Combatants their threatning Head incline,<br>  And with their clashing Horns in Battel joyn,<br>  They rush to combate with amazing Strokes,<br>  And their high Antlets meet with dreadful Shocks.<br>  The mighty Sound runs ratling o'er the Hills,<br>  And Eccho with the fight the Valley fills.<br>  Retiring oft, the Warriours cease to push,<br>  But then with fiercer Rage to Battel rush.<br>  The trembling Herds at Distance gaze, and stay<br>  To know the Conquerour, whom they must obey.<br>  No less concern'd <i> Saxons</i> , and <i> Britons</i>  stand<br>  To see the Victor, who must both command.<br>  <br>     Now <i> Tollo</i>  backwards shrinks, and panting stood<br>  Faint with his Labour, and his Loss of Blood.<br>  The <i> British</i>  Prince enrag'd to see the Fight<br>  So far prolong'd, collecting all his Might,<br>  With double Fury on th' <i> Albanian</i>  prest,<br>  And his bright Sword high rais'd, upon his Crest<br>  It stun'd the Foe, and took his Sense away.<br>  He dropt his Arms, and giddy reel'd about,<br>  The joyful <i> Britons</i>  raise a mighty Shout.<br>  <i> Arthur</i>  on fire, lets not th' Advantage go,<br>  But stepping forward with a back hand blow<br>  Drawn with prodigious Strength, from side to side<br>  Did his wide Throat, and spouting Veins divide.<br>  A crimson River gushing from the Wound,<br>  Ran down his burnish'd Armour to the Ground.<br>  Reeling and tott'ring for a While he stood,<br>  And from his Stomack vomits clotted Blood.<br>  Then down he fell, the Field beneath, and all<br>  the <i> Saxon</i>  Army tremble at his Fall:<br>  Groveling in Death, and smear'd with Gore he lay,<br>  And his dim Eyes scarcely admit the Day.<br>  Rolling in Dust his wounded Body bled,<br>  Away his Soul with Indignation fled.<br>  Convuls'd and quivering for a while he fetcht<br>  A dreadful Groan, and breathless out he stretcht.<br>  As when a Whirlwind with outrageous Force<br>  O'erturns a lofty Oak, that stops its Course,<br>  Its Roots torn up, the Tree's caught from the Ground,<br>  And with the furious Eddy carried round:<br>  Then falling from the Sky, his stately Head,<br>  And shady Limbs, the groaning Hill o'erspread.<br>  So by Prince <i> Arthur</i> 's Arms, King <i> Tollo</i>  slain,<br>  Fell down, and lay extended on the Plain.<br>  <br>  FINIS<br>  <br>  <br>
