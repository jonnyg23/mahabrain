AN HEROICK POEM IN TEN BOOKS</h2>  <h3 align="CENTER">by</h3>  <h2 align="CENTER"> SIR RICHARD BLACKMORE</h2>  <br>  </center>  <b> THE PREFACE</b> <br>    <br>  <br>     <i> To what ill purposes soever Poetry has been abus'd, its true and genuine End is by universal Confession, the Instruction of our Minds, and Regulation of our Manners; for which 'tis furnish'd with so many excellent Advantages.  The Delicacy of its Strains, the Sweetness and Harmony of its Numbers, the lively and admirable manner of its Painting or Representation, and the wonderful Force of its Eloquence, cannot but open the Passages to our Breasts, triumph over our Passions, and leave behind them very deep Impressions.  'Tis in the power of Poetry to insinuate into the inmost Recesses of the Mind, to touch any Spring that moves the Heart, to agitate the Soul with any sort of Affection, and transform it into any Shape or Posture it thinks fit.  'Tis therefore no wonder that so wise a State, as that of </i> Athens<i> , should retain the </i> Poets<i>  on the side of </i> Religion<i>  and the </i> Government<i> .  The Stage there was set up to teach the People the Scheme of their </i> Religion<i> , and those Modes of Worship the Government thought fit to encourage, to convey to them such Ideas of their Deities, and Divine Providence, as might engage their Minds to a Reverence of superiour, invisible Beings, and to observe and admire their Administration of humane Affairs.  The </i> Poets<i>  were look'd on as Divine, not only upon the account of that extraordinary Fury and Heat of Imagination, wherewith they were thought to be inspir'd, but likewise upon the account of their Profession and Imployment, their Business being to represent </i> Vice<i>  as the most odious, and </i> Virtue<i>  as the most desirable thing in the World.<br> <br>      Tragedy was at its first Institution a part of the Ancient Pagans Divine Service, when the </i> Chorus<i>  which originally was so great a part, contain'd many excellent Lessons of </i> Piety<i>  and </i> Morality<i> , and was wholly imploy'd in rectifying their mistakes about the </i> Gods<i> , and their Government of the World, in moderating their Passions, and purging their Minds from Vice and Corruption.  This was the noble Design of the </i> Chorus<i> .  And the Representation of great and illustrious Characters, gradually afterwards introduc'd, their Impious, or their Generous Actions, and the different Event that attended them, was to deter Men from Vice and Impiety, and encourage them to be Generous and Virtuous, be shewing them the Vengeance that at last overtook the one, and the Rewards and Praises that crown'd the other.  The End of Comedy was the same, but pursu'd in another way.  The business of Comedy being to render Vice ridiculous, to expose it to publick Derision and Contempt, and to make Men asham'd of Vile and Sordid Actions.<br> <br>      Tragedy design'd to Scare Men, Comedy to Laugh them out of their Vices.  And 'tis very plain, that Satyr is intended for the same End, the Promotion of Virtue, and exposing of Vice; which it pursues by sharp Reproaches, vehement and bitter Invectives, or by a Courtly, but not less cutting Raillery.  The Odes of the Lyric Poet were chiefly design'd for the Praises of their Gods, their Heroes and extraordianry Persons, to draw Men to an Admiration and Imitation of them.<br> <br>      But above all other kinds, </i> Epick Poetry<i> , as it is first in Dignity, so it mostly conduces to this End.  In an Epick Poem, where Characters of the first Rank and Dignity, Illustrious for their Birth or high Employment are introduc'd, the Fable, the Action, the particular Episodes are so contriv'd and conducted, or at least ought to be, that either Fortitude, Wisdom, Piety, Moderation, Generosity, some or other Nobel and Princely Virtues shall be recommended with the highest Advantage, and their contrary Vices made as odious.  To give Men right and just Conceptions of </i> Religion<i>  and </i> Virtue<i> , to aid their Reason in restraining their Exorbitant Appetites and Impetuous Passions, and to bring their Lives under the Rules and Guidance of true Wisdom, and thereby to promote the publick Good of Mankind, is undoubtedly the End of all Poetry.<br> <br>   </i> <i>    'Tis true indeed, that one End of Poetry is to give Men Pleasure and Delight; but this is but a subordinate, subaltern End, which is it self a Means to the </i> greater<i> , and </i> ultimate<i>  one before mention'd.  A Poet should imploy all his Judgment and Wit, exhaust all the Riches of his Fancy, and abound in Beautiful and Noble Expression, to divert and entertain others; but then it must be with this Prospect, that he may hereby engage their Attention, insinuate more easily into their Minds, and more effectually convey to them wise Instructions.  'Tis below the Dignity of a true Poet to take his Aim at any inferiour End.  They are Men of little Genius, of mean and poor Design, that imploy their Wit for no higher Purpose, than to please the Imagination of vain and wanton People.<br> <br>      I think these Poets, if they must be called so, whose Wit as they manage it, is altogether unuseful are justly reproach'd; but I am sure those others are highly to be condemned, who use all their Wit in </i> Opposition<i>  to Religion, and to the </i> Destruction<i>  of Virtue and good Manners in the World.  There have been in all Ages such ill Men that have perverted the right Use of Poetry, but never so many, or so </i> bold<i>  or </i> mischievous<i>  as in ours.  Our Poets seem engag'd in a general </i> Confederacy<i>  to ruin the End of their own Art, to expose </i> Religion<i>  and </i> Virtue<i> , and bring </i> Vice<i>  and </i> Corruption of Manners<i>  into Esteem and Reputation.  The Poets that write for the Stage (at least a great part of 'em) seem deeply concern'd in this </i> Conspiracy<i> .  These are the </i> Champions<i>  that  charge </i> Religion<i>  with such desperate Resolution, and have given it so many deep and ghastly Wounds.  The Stage was an Outwork or Fort rais'd for the Protection and Security of the Temple, but the Poets that kept it, have revolted, and basely betray'd it, and what is worse, have turn'd all their </i> Force<i>  and discharg'd all their </i> Artillery<i>  against the Place their Duty was to defend.  If any Man thinks this an unjust Charge, I desire him to read any of our modern Comedies, and I believe he will soon be convinc'd of the Truth of what I have said.<br> <br>   </i> <i>    The </i> Man of Sense<i>  and the </i> Fine<i>  Gentleman in the </i> Comedy<i> , who as the chiefest Person propos'd to the Esteem and Imitation of the Audience, is enrich'd with all the Sense and Wit the Poet can bestow; this </i> Extraordinary Person<i>  you will find to be a </i> Derider<i>  of Religion, a great </i> Admirer<i>  of </i> Lucretius<i> , not so much for his </i> Learning<i> , as his </i> Irreligion<i> , a Person wholly </i> Idle<i> , dissolv'd in Luxury, abandon'd to his Pleasures, a great Debaucher of Women, profuse and extravagant in his Expences, and in short, this </i> Finish'd<i>  </i> Gentleman<i>  will appear a </i> Finish'd Libertine<i> .<br> <br>   </i> <i>    The </i> Young Lady<i>  that must support the Character of a </i> Vertuous<i> , </i> Well-manner'd<i>  </i> Sensible<i>  Woman, the most perfect Creature that can be, and the very Flower of her Sex, this </i> Accomplish'd Person<i>  entertains the Audience with confident Discourses, immodest Repartees, and prophane Raillery.  She is throughly instructed in </i> Intreagues<i>  and </i> Assignations<i> , a great </i> Scoffer<i>  at the prudent Reservedness and Modesty of the best of her Sex,  She despises the wise Instructions of her Parents or Guardians, is disobedient to their Authority, and at last, without their </i> Knowledge<i>  or </i> Consent<i> , marries her self to the </i> Fine Gentleman<i>  above mentioned.  And can any one imagine, but that our Young Ladies and Gentlemen are admirably instructed by such </i> Patterns<i>  of </i> Sense<i>  and </i> Virtue<i> ?  If a Clergy-man be introduc'd, as he often is, 'tis seldome for any other purpose, but to abuse him, to expose his very </i> Character<i>  and </i> Profession<i> : He must be a </i> Pimp<i> , a </i> Blockhead<i> , a </i> Hypocrite<i> ; some </i> wretched<i>  </i> Figure<i>  he must make, and almost ever  be so manag'd, as to bring his very </i> Order<i>  into </i> Contempt<i> .  This indeed is a very common, but yet so gross an Abuse of </i> Wit<i> , as was never endur'd on a Pagan Theater, at least in the ancient, primitive Times of </i> Poetry<i> , before its </i> Purity<i>  and </i> Simplicity<i>  became corrupted with the Inventions of after Ages.  </i> Poets<i>  then taught Men to reverence their </i> Gods<i> , and those who serv'd them.  None had so little Regard for his </i> Religion<i> , as to expose it publickly, or if any had, their Govenments were too wise to suffer the Worship of their Gods to be treated on the </i> Stage<i>  with </i> Contempt<i> .<br> <br>   </i> <i>    In our </i> Comedies<i>  the </i> Wives of Citizens<i>  are highly encourag'd to despise their Husbands, and to make great Friendship with some such</i>  Vertuous Gentleman<i>  and </i> Man of Sense<i>  as is above describ'd.  This is their Way of recommending </i> Chastity<i>  and </i> Fidelity<i> .  And that </i> Diligence<i>  and </i> Frugality<i>  may be sufficiently expos'd, tho' the  two </i> Virtues<i>  that chiefly support the </i> Being<i>  of any State, to deter Men from being </i> Industrious<i>  and </i> Wealthy<i> , the </i> Diligent<i> , </i> Thriving<i>  Citizen is made of the most Wretched, Contemptible Thing in the World: and as the Alderman that makes the best </i> Figure<i>  in the </i> City<i> , makes the worst on the </i> Stage<i> , so under the Character of a </i> Justice of Peace<i> , you have all the </i> Prudence<i>  and </i> Virtues<i>  of the </i> Country<i> , most unmercifully insulted over.<br> <br>   </i> <i>    And as these Characters are set up on purpose to ruin all Opinion and Esteem of Virtue, so the Conduct throughout, the </i> Language,<i>  the </i> Fable<i> , and </i> Contrivance<i>  seem evidently design'd for the same</i>  Noble<i>  End.  There are few Fine Conceipts, few Strains of Wit or extraordinary Pieces of Raillery, but are either </i> immodest <i> or </i> irreligious,<i>  and very few </i> Scenes<i>  but have some </i> spiteful<i>  and </i> envious<i>  Stroke at Sobriety and Good Manners, whence the Youth of the Nation have apparently receiv'd very bad Impressions.  The </i> universal<i>  Corruption of Manners and irreligious Disposition of Mind that infects the Kingdom, seems to have been in a great Measure deriv'd from the Stage, or has at least been highly promoted by it.  And 'tis great Pitty that those in whose Power it is, have not yet restrain'd the </i> Licentiousness<i>  of it, and oblig'd the Writers to observe more </i> Decorum<i> .  It were to be wish'd that Poets, as Preachers are in some Countries, were paid and licens'd by the State, and that none were suffer'd to write in Prejudice of </i> Religion<i>  and the </i> Government<i> , but that all such Offenders, as </i> publick Enemies<i>  of Mankind should be silenc'd and duly punish'd.  Sure some Effectual Care should be taken that these Men might not be suffr'd by Debauching our Youth, to help on the </i> Destruction<i>  of a brave Nation.<br> <br>      Some of these </i> Poets<i> , to excuse their Guilt, alledge for themselves, that the </i> Degeneracy<i>  of the </i> Age<i>  makes their leud way of Writing necessary; they pretend the </i> Auditors<i>  will not be pleas'd, unless they are thus entertain'd from the Stage; and to please they say is the chief business of the Poet.  But this is by no means a just Apology; 'tis not true, as was said before, that the Poet's chief business is to please.  His  chief business is to instruct, to make Mankind Wiser and Better; and in order to this, his Care should be to please and entertain the Audience with all the </i> Wit<i>  and </i> Art<i> , he is Master of.  </i> Aristotle<i>  and </i> Horace<i> , and all their </i> Criticks<i>  and </i> Commentators<i> , all Men of Wit and Sense agree, that this is the End of Poetry.  But they say 'tis their </i> Profession<i>  to Write  for the </i> Stage<i> ; and that Poets must Starve if they will not in this way humour the </i> Audience<i> .  The </i> Theater<i>  will be as </i> unfrequented<i> , as the </i> Churches<i> , and the Poet and the Parson </i> equally<i>  neglected. Let the Poet then abandon his Profession, and take up some honest, lawful Calling, where joyning Industry to his great Wit, he may soon get above the Complaints of </i> Poverty<i> , so common among these ingenious Men, and lye under no necessity of prostituting his Wit to any such </i> vile<i>  Purposes as are here censur'd.  This will be a course of Life more Profitable and Honourable to himself, and more </i> useful<i>  to others.  And there are among these</i>  Writers <i> some, who think they might have risen to the </i> highest Dignities<i>  in other Professions, had they imploy'd their Wit in those Ways.  'Tis a mighty Dishonour and Reproach to any Man, that is capable of being useful to the World in any </i> Liberal<i>  and </i> Virtuous<i>  Profession, to lavish out his </i> Life<i>  </i> and<i>  </i> Wit<i>  in propagating </i> Vice <i>  </i> and<i>  </i>  Corruption of Manners<i> , and in battering from the Stage the strongest Entrenchments and best Works of </i> Religion<i>  and </i> Virtue<i> .  Whoever makes this his Choice, when the other was in his Power, may he go off the Stage unpity'd, </i> complaining<i>  of </i> Neglect<i>  and </i> Poverty<i> , the just Punishments of his </i> Irreligion<i>  and </i> Folly.<br> <br>      <i> 'Tis no dishonour to be a </i> true<i>  Poet, if indeed a Man be one; that is, a noble </i> Genius<i>  well cultivated, and employ'd in Writing in such a way, as reaches the End of his Art, and by discouraging Vice, promotes the Good of Mankind.  But 'tis a </i> mighty<i>  Dishonour and Shame, to employ excellent Faculties and abundance of Wit, to humour and please Men in their Vices and Follies.  Such a one is more hateful, as an</i>  ill Man<i> , than valuable, as a </i> good Poet<i> .  The great Enemy of Mankind, notwithstanding his </i> Wit <i> and</i>  Angelick Faculties, <i> is the most </i> odious<i>  Being of the whole Creation.  <br> <br>      Nor is this Abuse confin'd to the Stage, the same Strain runs thro' the other kinds of Poetry.  What monstrous leud and irreligious Books of Poems, as they are call'd, have been of late days publish'd, and what is the greater wonder, receiv'd in a Civiliz'd and Christian Kingdom, with </i> Applause <i> and </i> Reputation<i> ?  The sweetness of the Wit, makes the </i> Poison<i>  go down with Pleasure, and the Contagion spreads without Opposition.  Young Gentlemen and Ladies are generally pleas'd and diverted with </i> Poetry, <i> more than by any other way of Writing; but there are few Poems they can fix on, but they are like to pay too dear for their Entertainment.  Their Fancies are like to be fill'd with impure </i> Ideas<i>  and their Minds engag'd in </i> hurtful<i>  Passions, which are the more lasting, by being convey'd in lively Expressions, and all the Address of an artful Poet.  <br> <br>      For this End among others, I undertook the writing of this Poem, hoping I might be able to please and entertain, not only wthout hurting the Reader, but to his advantage.  I was willing to make one </i> Effort<i>  towards the rescuing the</i>  Muses<i>  out of the hands of these</i>  Ravishers<i> , to restore them to their sweet and chast Mansions, and to engage them in an Employment suitable to their </i> Dignity.  <i> If I succeed not my self in this good Design, I hope at least I shall awaken the Courage and Compassion of some other</i>  brave Adventurers; <i> that may more happily attempt this honorable Work.<br> <br>      To write an Epick Poem is a work of that Difficulty, that no one for near seventeen hundred years past has succeeded in it; and only those two great Wits </i> Homer<i>  and </i> Virgil<i>  before.  That the modern Poets have been so unsuccessful, has not, I  imagin, proceeded so much from want of </i> Genius, <i> as from their Ignorance of the Rules of writing such a Poem; or at least, from their want of attending to them.  Tho' </i> Aristotle<i> 's excellent Rules of Poetry were early publish'd by </i> Victorius<i>  at</i>  Florence<i> , and soon after farther illustrated by the Comments of several </i> Italian Criticks<i> , yet we do not find that </i> Ariosto<i>  or </i> Tasso<i>  either, were very careful to observe them.  And indeed our </i> modern Writers<i>  neither seem to have attended to those incomparable Rules, nor carefully to have consider'd the great </i> Models<i>  that </i> Homer<i>  and </i> Virgil<i>  had left them.  Some Readers that are not vers'd in this matter, imagin every thing written in </i> Heroick Verse<i> , is an </i> Heroick Poem<i> ; but these have not consider'd the </i> Nature<i>  of such a Work, nor look'd into the </i> Criticks<i> , who have written on this Subject.  I shall therefore give the </i> Definition<i>  of an Epick or Heroick Poem, that those that have it not already, may now have a true Idea of its Nature.<br> <br>      An Epick Poem is a feign'd or devis'd Story of an </i> Illustrious Action, <i> related in Verse, in  an </i> Allegorical, Probable, Delightful <i> and</i>  Admirable<i>  manner, to cultivate the Mind with Instructions of Virtue.  'Tis a feign'd or devis'd Discourse; that is, a </i> Fable<i> ; and so it agrees with </i> Tragedy<i>  and </i> Comedy<i> .  The word </i> Fable<i>  at first signified indifferently a true or false Story, therefore</i>  Cicero<i>  for distinction, uses </i> Fictas Fabulas<i>  in his Book</i>  de<i>  </i> Finibus<i> .  But afterwards Custom obtain'd to use the word always for a feign'd Discourse.  And in the first Ages, especially in the Eastern World, great use was made by Learned and Wise Men of these </i> feign'd Discourses, Fables, <i> or</i>  Apologues<i> , to teach the ruder and more unpolish'd Part of Mankind.  </i> Theologians, Philosophers, <i> and great </i> Law-givers<i> , every where fell into this way of instructing and cultivating the People in the Knowledge of Religion, Natural Philosophy, and Moral and Political Virtues.  So </i> Thales, Orpheus, Solon, Homer, <i>  and the rest of the great Men in those Ages have done, and the famous Philosopher </i> Socrates<i>  is by some affirm'd to be the Author of many of the Fables that pass under </i> Æsop'<i> s name.  Most of them made their Fables in Verse, that by the addition of </i> Harmony<i>  and</i>  Numbers<i>  they might the better attain their End.  </i> Strabo<i>  and </i> Plutarch<i>  greatly commend this way of teaching the People; and these Reasons may be given for the usefulness of it.  Naked Philosophical Precepts and Doctrines are of themselves </i> harsh<i>  and </i> dry<i> , hardly attended to, and </i> ungratefully <i> entertain'd.  If the Hearers are </i> rude<i>  and </i> course<i> , or very </i> vicious<i> , there is no hope of gaining them by a </i> grave<i>  and </i> solemn<i>  Discourse of Virtue, and even the better and more civiliz'd Auditors are hardly kept attentive to it.  Man is naturally a lover of </i> Pleasure<i> , and if you would do him Good, it must be, by </i> pleasing <i> him; you must give him </i> Delight<i> , and keep his Mind in a constant agreeable Agitation, else he will not attend to the most useful </i> Counsel<i>  and </i> Instruction<i> .  He is pleas'd already with the </i> Notions <i> and </i> Habitudes<i> , howsoever</i>  false<i>  or </i> vicious<i> , that have the </i> present<i>  Possession of him, and you must give him a great deal of </i> Pleasure<i>  and </i> Entertainment<i>  to engage him to hear you, when you would perswade him to the trouble, of becoming </i> Wiser<i>  and </i> Better.  <i> Now the first Wise Men that undertook to </i> civilize<i>  and </i> polish<i>  the barbarous World, found this way of </i> Fables<i>  especially in Verse, to be mighty </i> Acceptable<i>  to the People: The Contrivance gave them </i> Delight<i> , and the Novelty rais'd their </i> Admiration<i> .  They could learn them perfectly, and repeat them often, by which means the Instructions of Virtue covertly contain'd in them, were inculcated on their Minds</i> .  <br> <br>      <i> And we find, that many Ages after </i> Orpheus, Solon, Homer, <i> &amp;c. </i> the Divine Law-giver<i>  of the </i> Christians<i>  thought fit to teach the People by </i> Apologues, Parables<i>  or </i> Fables, <i> under which he cover'd and disguis'd his Heavenly Instructions.<br> <br>      The Action must be </i> Illustrious<i>  and </i> Important<i> ; Illustrious in respect of the Person, who is the Author of it, who is always some </i> Valiant<i> , or </i> Wise<i> , or </i> Pious<i>  Prince or great Commander: But let his Character be what it will in other respects (for there is no Necessity the </i> Hero<i>  should be a good or a wise Person) 'tis always necessary he should have </i> Courage<i> ; which single Quality is sufficient to make the </i> Hero.<i>   And the Action must be</i>  important<i> , both in respect of its </i> Object<i>  and its </i> End.  <i> 'Tis the Action of some great Person, about some </i> noble<i>  and </i> weighty<i>  Affair</i> .  <i> 'Tis true, there are many other Persons concern'd, but tis the Action of the </i> chief<i>  Person that gives the </i> Being<i>  and </i> Denomination <i> to the Poem.  This Action must be but one; when it ceases, the Poem is ended; and if it be reviv'd, and taken up again, 'tis a new Poem begins.  Action is Motion; and if it ceases cannot be reviv'd, so as to be numerically the same.  There are indeed many other Actions besides the </i> Principal<i>  one, but they all depend on, and have relation to that which is Principal, with the </i> Unity<i>  of which, the </i> Unity<i>  of the Poem stands or falls.  If this principal Action be </i> broken<i> , the Poem is </i> broken<i>  too, if there be any other Action </i> coordinate<i>  and </i> independent<i>  on this, the Poem is </i> monstrous,<i>  and has as many Heads, as there are found </i> independent<i>  Actions.  The Narration therefore of many Actions successively of one great Person, or the History of his Life related in Verse, is by no means an </i> Heroick Poem<i> , any one great action being sufficient for that.  That which makes the </i> Unity<i>  of the Action, is the regular Succession of one </i> Part<i>  or</i>  Episode<i>  to another, not only as </i> Antecedents<i>  and</i>  Consequents<i> , but as it were </i> Causes <i> and</i>  Effects<i> , wherein the Reader may discern that the former </i> Episode<i>  makes the following necessary, and the </i> Connection<i>  between them is such, that they </i> assist<i>  and </i> support<i>  each other, as the </i> Members<i>  of the Body do, no Episode being out of its place, of a </i> disproportion'd<i>  size to the Rest, or that could be spar'd from its place, without </i> maiming, <i> or at least </i> deforming<i>  the Whole.  If this order of the Episodes be preserv'd, and there appears none but what </i> naturally<i>  and </i> probably <i> results from the </i> principal <i>  Action, then the Action may be look'd on as one.  <br> <br>      The Action must be related in an </i> Allegorical<i>  manner; and this Rule is best observ'd, when as </i> Divines<i>  speak; there is both a </i> Literal <i> Sense obvious to every Reader, and that gives him satisfaction enough if he sees no farther; and besides another </i> Mystical<i>  or </i> Typical<i>  Sense, not hard to be discover'd by those Readers that penetrate the matter deeper.  </i> Virgil<i>  seems most happy in this Conduct, whose Poem all along contains this double Sense, </i> Homer<i>  has often only an </i> Allegorical <i> Sense without the </i> Literal<i> , and therefore is not so well accommodated to this Age, as he was not to that of </i> Augustus<i> .  But </i> Ariosto<i>  and </i> Spencer<i> , however </i> great<i>  </i> Wits<i> , not observing this judicious Conduct of </i> Virgil<i> , nor attending to any sober Rules, are hurried on with a </i> boundless, impetuous<i>  Fancy over Hill and Dale, till they are both lost in a Wood of Allegories.  Allegories so </i> wild, unnatural, <i> and </i> extravagant<i> , as greatly displease the Reader.  This way of writing mightily offends in this Age; and 'tis a wonder how it came to please in any.  There is indeed a way of writing purely Allegorical, as when </i> Vices <i> and </i> Virtues <i> are introduc'd as</i>  Persons, <i> the first as </i> Furies<i> , the other as </i> Divine Persons or Goddesses, <i> which still obtains, and is well enough accommodated to the </i> present<i>  Age.  For the </i> Allegory<i>  is presently discern'd, and the Reader is by no means impos'd on, but sees it immediately to be an </i> Allegory<i> , and is both delighted and instructed with it.  The devis'd Story must be related in a </i> probable <i> manner; without this all things will be </i> harsh, unnatural,<i>  and</i>  monstrous<i> ; and consequently most </i> odious<i>  and </i> offensive<i>  to the Judicious.  </i> Probability <i> must be in the </i> Action, <i> the </i> Conduct<i> , the </i> Manners<i> ; and where humane means cannot,</i>  Machines<i>  are introduc'd to support it.  Nothing is more necessary then </i> Probability<i> ; no Rule more chastly to be observ'd.<br> <br>      An Epick Poem must likewise be </i> delightful <i> and </i> admirable<i> ; and to make it so, must concur sublime Thoughts, clear and noble Expression, Purity of Language, a just and due Proportion, Relation, and Dependance between the Parts, and a beautiful and regular Structure and Connection discernable in the </i> Whole<i> .  Without these it will not be capable of giving </i> Delight<i> , or raising</i>  Admiration<i> .  </i> Admiration<i>  is the </i> Formal Object<i>  of an Epick Poem, nothing is to be admitted there, but as it is </i> admirable; <i> and by this it is discriminated from all other sorts of Poetry</i> .<i>   Every </i> kind<i>  endeavours to </i> please<i>  and </i> delight<i> , but this only attempts to please by </i> astonishing <i> and </i> amazing<i>  the Reader</i> .<i>  In an Epick Poem every thing should appear </i> great<i>  and </i> wonderful<i> , the Thoughts cannot be too much </i> Elevated<i> , the Episodes too </i> Noble<i> , the Expression too </i> Magnificent<i> , nor the Action too </i> Wonderful<i>  and </i> Surprising<i> , if Probability be preserv'd.  No Riches of </i> Fancy<i> , no </i> Pomp<i>  of </i> Eloquence<i>  can be laid out too much on such a Work where the </i> Design<i>  is throughout to raise our </i> Admiration<i> .  To render the Action the more </i> Admirable, Homer<i>  and </i> Virgil<i>  have introduc'd the </i> Gods<i> , and engag'd them every where as </i> Parties<i> ; and tho' I cannot say this is </i> Essential<i>  and </i> Necessary<i>  to an Epick Poem, yet 'tis evident, that interesting </i> Heaven<i>  and </i> Hell<i>  in the matter, does mightily raise the Subject, and makes the Action appear more wonderful.  The Pagan Poets had in this a great advantage, their </i> Theology<i>  was such, as would easily mix it self with their Poems, from whence they receiv'd their greatest Beauties.  </i> Homer<i>  indeed to raise his Subject by his frequent</i>  Machines<i> , seems to have debas'd his </i> Religion<i> .  </i> Virgil<i> 's Conduct, in my Opinion, is more careful and chast.  But some of our </i> modern Criticks<i>  have believ'd 'tis scarce possible for a </i> Christian<i>  Poet to make use of this advantage, of introducing </i> Superiour, Indivisible<i>  Powers into the Action, and therefore seem to despair of seeing an </i> Heroick Poem<i>  written now, that shall reach to the </i> Dignity<i>  of those of the Pagans.  They think the </i> Christian Religion<i>  is not so well accommodated to this matter, as the </i> Pagan<i>  was; and that if any Attempt be made this way, </i> Religion<i>  is not so well  accommodated to this matter, as the </i> Pagan<i>  was; and that if any Attempt be made this way, </i> Religion<i>  will </i> suffer<i>  more, than the </i> Poem <i> will gain by it.  </i> My Opinion<i>  has always differ'd from these Gentlemen's, I believe a </i> Christian Poet<i>  has as great advantages as the </i> Pagan<i>  had; and that our </i> Theology<i>  may enter into an Epick Poem, and </i> raise<i>  the Subject without being it self </i> debas'd.  <i> And this indeed was a second Reason why I undertook this Work, so full of </i> Difficulty<i>  and </i> Hazard.<i>   I was willing to give an Instance wherein it might appear, that the Assertion I have advanc'd, is </i> actually<i>  true.<br> <br>      In the Definition which I have given of an Heroick Poem, according to the Sense and Judgment of the </i> best Criticks,<i>  I have said, its End is to convey some Instruction of Virtue.  But of this, I have discours'd at large at the beginning of this </i> Preface<i> , and there is no need of repeating it.</i> <br> <br>      <i> 'Tis not for me to proceed to Censure other Mens Performances of this Kind;  whoever will be at the Pains to read the Commentators on </i> Aristotle<i> , and </i> Horace's<i>  Rules of Poetry; or that will but carefully consider </i> Rapin, Dacier, <i> and </i> Bossu, <i> those great Masters among the </i> French<i> , and the Judicious Remarks of our own </i> excellent Critick Mr. Rymer<i> , who seems to have better consider'd these matters, and to have seen farther into them, than any of the </i> English Nation;<i>  will be soon able to see wherein the Heroick Poems that have been publish'd since </i> Virgil<i>  by the </i> Italian, French, <i>  and </i> English Wits<i>  have been defective, by comparing them with the </i> Rules<i>  of Writing set down by those </i> great Masters.  <i> Whether I have succeeded better, must be left to the determination of the Judicious Reader.  <br> <br>      In this Work I have endeavour'd mostly to form my self on </i> Virgil's Model<i> , which I look on, as the most </i> just<i>  and </i> perfect<i> , and which is most easily accommodated to the present Age, supposing the </i> Christian Religion<i>  in the place of the </i> Pagan<i> .  I do not make any </i> Apology<i>  for my </i> Imitation of Virgil<i>  in so many places of this Poem; for the same great </i> Master<i>  has imitated </i> Homer<i>  as frequently and closely; and I do not find that any of his </i> Criticks<i>  have condemn'd him for his doing so.  Nor is it at all </i> improbable<i> , but that the </i> Greek Poet<i>  himself imitated his Predecessors of the same Nation, tho' no doubt he wonderfully improv'd their Model.  </i> Homer<i>  was not the first Writer of an Epick Poem.  We find </i> Aristotle<i>  in his Book of the Art of Poetry, makes mention of several before him: He tells us of an Epick Poem, intituled, </i> The Little Ilias, <i> and another the </i> Cyprica<i> ; and censures them both, as containing many </i> perfect, distinct, <i>  and </i> independent<i>  Actions.  The last of these Poems is likewise mention'd by </i> Herodotus<i>  in </i> Euterpe<i> , by </i> Athenæus <i> and </i> Pausanias.  <i> And 'tis likely many more such Poems were written before </i> Homer<i> 's time, who might be well suppos'd to have imitated them in what they had done well, as well as to have improv'd them in avoiding many of their Errors.<br> <br>      What </i> Homer<i>  and </i> Virgil<i>  have </i> perform'd<i>  with Honour and universal Applause, I have </i>  attempted:<i>  What they have been </i> able<i> , I have been </i> willing<i>  to do.  If I have not succeeded, my disappointment will be the less, in that Poetry has been so far from being my </i> Business<i>  and </i> Profession<i> , that it has imploy'd but a small part of my Time; and then, but as my </i> Recreation, <i> and the Entertainment of my idle hours.  If this Attempt succeeds so far, as to excite some other Person that has a </i> noble Genius, Leisure, <i> and </i> Application<i> , to Honour his Country with a </i> just Epick Poem, <i> I shall think the </i> Vacancies<i>  and </i> Intervals<i>  that for about two years past, I have had from the Business of my </i> Profession<i> ; which notwithstanding was then greater then at any time before, have been very well imploy'd.<br> <br>   </i> <br> <br>   <br>  <b> PRINCE ARTHUR</b> <br>  <br>  <br>  <b> BOOK I</b>  <br>  <br>     I sing the <i> Briton</i> , and his Righteous Arms, <br>

sentenc'd Criminals Reprieve,<br>  Judgment Arrest, and bid the Rebel live.<br>  Her Charms did once the Sun's swift Chariot stay,<br>  And on the Verge of Heav'n, held back the falling Day.<br>  She makes contentious Winds forget their Strife,<br>  And calls back to the Dead, departed Life.<br>  Charm'd by her Voice, Rivers have stop'd their Course,<br>  And the chill'd Fire laid down its burning Force.<br>  Such is Devotion's Power, which <i> Arthur</i>  knew,<br>  And when distress'd still to this Refuge flew.<br>  Much to his Conduct he, much to his Arms,<br>  But more he trusted to Devotion's Charms.<br>  Of Triumph and Success he rarely fail'd,<br>  For those on Earth, and these in Heav'n prevail'd.<br>  <br>     Now in the silent, shady Cave retir'd,<br>  He with her sacred Fury lay inspir'd.<br>  The Prince being thus entranc'd, a Heav'nly Light<br>  Shoots smiling through the Wood with silent flight:<br>  The Trees admire the Glory on them shed,<br>  And seem'd to start, and humbly bow their Head;<br>  When fresh arriv'd on Earth, with Heav'n's Commands,<br>  Great <i> Raphael</i> 's glorious Form by <i> Arthur</i>  stands.<br>  Celestial Sweetness, Mild and God-like Grace<br>  Ineffable, sat on his blooming Face.<br>  His Cheeks such Beauty shew'd, such Light and Joy his Eyes,<br>  As from full Bliss, fresh Youth, and Strength immortal rise.<br>  The purest piece of Heav'n's Etherial Blue,<br>  In a rich Mantle, from his Shoulders flew.<br>  Celestial Linnen, finely Spun and Wove<br>  On Looms Divine, by all the Skill above,<br>  Bleach'd on th' Empyreal Plains till White as Snow,<br>  Made the long Robe that to his Feet did flow.<br>  Immortal Gold, Illustrious as the Morn,<br>  And dazling Gemms by high Arch Angels worn,<br>  With pond'rous Pearl from Heav'n's bright Eastern Shore,<br>  Adorn the shining Garments that he wore.<br>  A Purple Girdle, from the Morning Sky<br>  New rent, does round his Starry Vesture tye.<br>  Thus he appear'd, and with the Light he gave,<br>  And unknown Fragrancy, fill'd all the Cave.<br>  <br>     Then thus he spake, Hail mine and Heav'n's kind Care,<br>  Hither I come, drawn by thy powerful Prayer.<br>  Know Righteous Prince, th' Almighty does approve,<br>  Your firm Adhesion, and unshaken Love.<br>  Ends Great and Wise lodg'd in his secret Breast,<br>  Obstruct your Wishes, and your Course molest.<br>  Yet still pursue your great and just Intent,<br>  No Force or Arts shall your Design prevent,<br>  Propitious Heav'n Decrees your wish'd Event.<br>  You on these Coasts for happy Ends are thrown,<br>  And after this, expect the British Crown.<br>  Your Friends and Navy on the Ocean lost,<br>  Are all arriv'd safe on th' Armorie Coast:<br>  By the impetuous Tempest beaten back,<br>  But Men and Ships sav'd from the threatn'd Wreck.<br>  You're cast on <i> Hoel</i> 's Land, amidst your Foes,<br>  That hate your Cause, and your just Arms Oppose.<br>  But fear not <i> Hoel</i> 's Power, though now your Foe,<br>  By Hell incens'd, he will not long be so.<br>  Go then directly to his Court, for there,<br>  A Glorious Work demands your Pious Care.<br>  That said, with outstrecht Wings he soars upright,<br>  And through the Winds vast Empire takes his flight.<br>  He cuts the Clouds, and by the Planets flies<br>  Up the steep Crystal Mountains of the Skies.<br>  <br>     And swiftly passing through the Starry Sphears,<br>  Before the Throne he in his place appears,<br>  The Cherub's gone, and with him <i> Arthur</i> 's fears.<br>  Who to his Lords returns, and to their Heart<br>  Courage and Joy, his Words and Looks impart.<br>  His God-like Language does their Fears abate,<br>  And with fresh hopes their troubl'd Breasts dilate.<br>  <br>     Mean time th' Infernal Thrones and Powers resort,<br>  At their great Monarch's Summons to his Court.<br>  Where they in Council meet, and there debate<br>  Important matters, high Designs of State.<br>  Their Prince with Pride extended, mounts his Throne,<br>  Of polish'd Gold, whence horrid splendor shone:<br>  And mingl'd with the Shades tremendous Light,<br>  More dreadful thus, as Fires, that Flame by Night.<br>  In sad Magnificence, and dismal State,<br>  He sits, and round th' Infernal Orders sate.<br>     Then <i> Lucifer</i>  began:<br>  Immortal Potentates, Illustrious Lords,<br>  The <i> British</i>  Youth's ambitious aim affords,<br>  A weighty subject for your high debate;<br>  Who seeks the ruin of your Pow'r and State.<br>  You all have heard, how with a mighty Force<br>  Embark'd, he straight for <i> Albion</i>  steer'd his Course,<br>  King <i> Octa</i>  to attack, our Votary,<br>  And make our Priests from our new Altars fly.<br>  I watch'd, and aided by the Power of <i> Thor</i> ,<br>  I shew'd the Miscreant another Shore.<br>  His Fleet beat back, and haughty purpose crost,<br>  He wanders, Shipwreckt on th' Armoric Coast.<br>  Where faithful <i> Hoel</i>  does the <i> Specter</i>  hold,<br>  Mighty in Arms, and in our Service bold.<br>  Spirits Divine, high Peers of Hell, suggest,<br>  By what sure Plagues he may be more distrest,<br>  His Ruin finish'd, and his Sect opprest.<br>  <br>     That said, a Fury crawls from out her Cell,<br>  The bloodiest Minister of Death and Hell.<br>  A mostrous Shape, a foul and hideous sight,<br>  That did all Hell with her dire looks affright.<br>  Huge, full gorg'd Snakes on her lean Shoulders hung,<br>  And Death's dark Courts with their loud hissing rung.<br>  Her Teeth and Claws were Iron, and her Breath,<br>  Like Subterranean Damps, gave present Death.<br>  Flames worse than Hells, shot from her bloody Eyes,<br>  And Fire and Sword Eternally she Cries.<br>  No certain Shape, no Feature regular,<br>  No Limbs distinct in th' odious Fiend appear.<br>  Her squallid, bloated Belly did arise,<br>  Swoln with black Gore, to a prodigious Size.<br>  Distended vastly, by a mighty Flood<br>  Of slaughter'd Saints, and constant Martyrs Blood.<br>  Part stood out prominent, but part fell down,<br>  And in a swagging heap, lay wallowing on the ground.<br>  A Monster so deform'd, so fierce as this,<br>  It self a Hell, ne'er saw the dark Abyss.<br>  Horrour till now the ugliest Shape esteem'd,<br>  So much out-done, a harmless Figure seem'd.<br>  Envy and Hate, and Malice blush'd to see<br>  Themselves Eclips'd by such Deformity.<br>  Her Feaverish Thirst drinks down a Sea of Blood,<br>  Not of the Impious, but the Just and Good.<br>  'Gainst whom she burns with unextinguish'd Rage,<br>  Nor can th' exhausted World her Wrath asswage.<br>  <br>     Then thus the Fury Persecution spake:<br>  I mighty Prince of Hell, will undertake<br>  This glorious Work, I quickly will inspire<br>  <i> Hoel</i> , with my ungovernable Fire.<br>  Without remorse he shall my Will Obey,<br>  And crush this <i> Briton</i> , now his easie Prey.<br>  <i> Nero</i>  by me rais'd his Illustrious Name,<br>  And <i> Dioclesian</i>  got Immortal Fame.<br>  I their rude, inbred Cruelty refin'd,<br>  And stampt my perfect Image on their Mind.<br>  My flames all Love's course mixture did destroy,<br>  And purg'd off soft Compassion's base alloy;<br>  I form'd and dissiplin'd their untaught Hate,<br>  And rais'd their fierceness to a perfect State.<br>  Where shame, and all reflecting Sense is lost,<br>  And Hell can't purer strains of Malice boast.<br>  Inexorable they all Cries withstood,<br>  Ravish'd with Slaughter, and regal'd with Blood.<br>  Hard marble Rocks might with more ease relent,<br>  And Fire and Plague, learn sooner to repent.<br>  Then Christian Kings my Fury entertain'd,<br>  And taught by me, in Blood and Slaughter reign'd.<br>  With pious Rage and fierce destructive Zeal,<br>  I first inspir'd their Minds, and did reveal<br>  The mystery, how deep Revenge to take,<br>  And slay the Servants for the Master's sake.<br>  How bloody Wrath might with Devotion joyn,<br>  And sacred Zeal with Cruelty combine.<br>  By me the unknown way they understood,<br>  T'attone the Christians God, with Christian Blood.<br>  By me they shook off Fear's and Love's Restraints;<br>  And on God's Altars burnt his slaughter'd Saints.<br>  I made them call, that all remorse might cease,<br>  Murder Compassion, Desolation Peace.<br>  Whilst my Infernal Heats their Breasts inspir'd,<br>  To the vile Sect their own mad Zeal acquir'd,<br>  Wider Destruction, and more fatal Harms,<br>  Then all your <i> Scythian</i> , or your <i> Gothick</i>  Arms.<br>  And <i> Rome</i> , proud <i> Rome</i>  herself, must owe to me<br>  Her present State, and future Dignity.<br>  The greatest Genius this, I e're could find,<br>  And to receive my Image best inclin'd.<br>  I will her Mind inspire, and to her Heart<br>  Immortal hate, to <i> Abel</i> 's Race impart.<br>  These Breasts she empties with her Infant Jaws,<br>  I File her Teeth, and Shape her tender Claws.<br>  I Nurse her on the horrid Alps high Tops,<br>  And feed her hunger with <i> Cerberean</i>  Sops<br>  Dipt in <i> Tartarean</i>  Gall, and Hemlock Juice,<br>  That in her Veins will noble Blood produce.<br>  Fierce Tygers, Dragons, Wolves about her stay,<br>  They grin, and snap, and bite, and snarling play.<br>  I to her Jaws, throw Infants newly Born;<br>  She sucks their Blood, and by her Teeth are torn<br>  Their tender Limbs, while I rejoyce to see<br>  Such noble proofs of growing Cruelty.<br>  To her wide Breast, and vast capacious Soul,<br>  I often Torrents of black Poison rowl:<br>  She drinks the livid Flood, and through her Veins<br>  Mad Fury runs, and wild Distraction reigns.<br>  I'll lead her from the Rocks, her strength full grown,<br>  Fix her high Seat in the Imperial Town,<br>  And give her Scarlet, and a threefold Crown.<br>  No Blood will then her mighty Thirst asswage,<br>  No Ravage cloy her Antichristian Rage.<br>  Her Mitred Sons that never can relent,<br>  From the great <i> Cain</i> , shall prove their high Descent.<br>  Their Deeds of strange Infernal Cruelty,<br>  Shall shew their Race worthy of Him and me.<br>  Lay-Bigots, I with time and labour wrought,<br>  Some inward Grudgings still against me fought:<br>  'Twas hard to raise their hate to a degree,<br>  From struggling Nature, and all Pity free.<br>  But these Church-Zealots, of a truer breed,<br>  Are form'd with Ease, and scarce my Labour need.<br>  Their forward Genius without teaching grows,<br>  And all my hopes, and ev'n my wish out-does.<br>  How often shall thy glorious Sons, O <i> Rome</i> ,<br>  With Martyrs Flames inlighten Christendom?<br>  How often shall they, to deride their God,<br>  Lift up in Prayer, their Hands all full of Blood?<br>  The wasted World shall feel their loud Alarms,<br>  Their blest Massacres, and their hallow'd Arms.<br>  As if their high intent were to Efface,<br>  All Footsteps left of <i> Abel</i> 's hateful Race.<br>  Bloody Tribunals, Rapine, Fire and Sword,<br>  And Desolation, dayly Sport afford.<br>  Mankind they shall with such dire Plagues attack,<br>  As will their Church a holy Desart make.<br>  Such is my Zeal to serve th' infernal State,<br>  And shall this <i> British</i>  Prince escape my Hate?<br>  Forbid it Hell, and here she made a pause;<br>  The Lords in Council gave a loud applause.<br>  The Prince of Darkness leaping from his place,<br>  Did in his Arms, his darling Fiend Embrace.<br>  Her Anger then rose higher, and all Hell<br>  Uneasie seem'd, she grew so terrible.<br>  <br>     She strait contracts her vast dilated Size,<br>  And through Hell's dusky Void, she upward flies.<br>  As when rich Towns great Cost and Art employ<br>  In Fire-works, to express their publick Joy,<br>  For some great Vict'ry won by Land, or Sea,<br>  Or on some Prince's Coronation Day.<br>  The flaming Rockets hizzing fly by Night,<br>  And fill the Sky with unknown Noise and Light.<br>  The Sphears amaz'd stand, or move slowly on,<br>  And wonder how the Day returns so soon,<br>  And what new Stars rise brighter than their own.<br>  So does the Fiend, her Snakes all hissing rise,<br>  Through the thick haggair'd Air, and as she flies<br>  Leaves tracks of Light, cast from her fiery Eyes.<br>  And now arriv'd on the grey Coasts of Day,<br>  Direct to <i> Hoel</i> 's court she takes her way.<br>  Where she alighted, when the Sun had hurl'd<br>  His glorious Orb hence, to the other World.<br>  'Twas then when all things look'd, as if old Night<br>  Had Nature crush'd, and seiz'd her ancient Right,<br>  Whilst Silence, Shades, and Lights around create,<br>  Sad solemn Pomp, t'express her Death-like state.<br>  Winds, and wild Beasts lye in their Dens at rest,<br>  Nor these the Woods, nor those the Seas molest.<br>  The sleeping Vultures drop their prey, the Dove<br>  Ceases her Cooing, and forgets to love.<br>  The Jocond Fairies Dance their silent round,<br>  And with dark Circles mark the trampled ground.<br>  <i> Tartarean</i>  Forms Skim o're the Mountains Heads,<br>  Or lightly sweep along the dewy Meads.<br>  Ghosts leave their Tombs hid Murders to reveal,<br>  Or Treasures which themselves did once conceal.<br>  Visions thro' th' Air, and careless Phantoms stray,<br>  Or round Mens troubled Heads while sleeping play.<br>  <br>     The Fury <i> Alman</i> 's Reverend Shape assumes,<br>  <i> Odin</i> 's High Priest, and so to <i> Hoel</i>  comes.<br>  For the Priest's Form, is fittest to engage<br>  Princes in Blood, and move destructive Rage.<br>  Thus chang'd the Fiend, such is her Craft, appears,<br>  And thus began, just <i> Hoel</i> , all those years<br>  I liv'd, I did with studious Care employ,<br>  How best I might the Christian Crew destroy.<br>  I thy great Soul in this blest Cause engag'd,<br>  Inspir'd with Heats Divine, not yet asswag'd.<br>  I quit <i> Elysian</i>  Pleasures to impart,<br>  What does with greater Joy extend my Heart;<br>  And will do thine, <i> Arthur</i> , Curst be that Name,<br>  Designing Empire, and Illustrious Fame<br>  Embark'd with Arms, fair <i> Albion</i>  to invade,<br>  But by just Heav'n, is thy cheap Captive made.<br>  Pursu'd with Thunder, and in Tempests tost,<br>  At last he's Shipwreckt on this happy Coast.<br>  With his sad Friends he wanders up and down,<br>  Naked, perplext, deserted, and undone.<br>  But yet just Heav'n Decrees him greater Harm,<br>  But saves that Glory for your Zealous Arm.<br>  To take his Life must be your Pious Care,<br>  And with the Gods divided Honour share.<br>  Thus you their En'my, and your own remove,<br>  Secure your Peace, and please the Pow'rs above.<br>  To Christians this can be no Injury,<br>  That call for Torments, and are pleas'd to Dye.<br>  They all seem fond to wear the Martyr's Crown,<br>  And meet the Flames, with greater of their own.<br>  No Rights, no Rules of Justice you invade,<br>  For Ruin's their Profession, Death their Trade.<br>  Go then, and grace the <i> Briton</i> , that comes on<br>  To meet you, and receive the Martyr's Crown.<br>  Remove this Pillar of their Church, and all<br>  The unsupported Roof, will crack and fall.<br>  Take this Defender of their Faith away,<br>  The passive Rabble, tamely will Obey.<br>  Their Lives in Sport you may at leisure take,<br>  They quickly fall, that no Resistance make.<br>  The Gods into your Hands have cast your Foe,<br>  To take his Life will please Heav'n, him, and you.<br>  <br>     That said, she breath'd her Soul into his Breast,<br>  And her wild Fury all his Veins possest.<br>  Infernal Flames Rage in his poison'd Blood,<br>  And his swoln Heart Boils with th' impetuous Flood.<br>  The Fiend her Shape of thicken'd Air dissovles,<br>  And disappears, <i> Hoel</i>  surpriz'd revolves<br>  The welcome message in his Mind, and strait<br>  Commands his Lords and Guards should on him wait,<br>  On the first Shooting of the tender Day,<br>  So eager did he seem to seize the Prey.<br>  <br>     Now was the Eastern Sky-dy'd Purple spread,<br>  For fair <i> Aurora</i> 's Radiant Feet to tread.<br>  She mounts serene, and with mild dawning Light,<br>  Smiles on the lowring, dusky Face of Night;<br>  That to Victorious Day yields up her Seat,<br>  Whilst her black Forces silently Retreat.<br>  As when a Lyon at the dawn of Day,<br>  Rous'd with fierce Hunger up to Hunt his Prey,<br>  Stretches his Limbs out, Yawns, and tries his Paws,<br>  And for sure Death prepares his cruel Jaws.<br>  He stands, and rolls about his Angry Eyes,<br>  Lashing his Sides to make his Fury rise.<br>  Then Scowrs the Hills, Ranges the Forrests o'er,<br>  And Thunders thro the Desart with his hideous Roar.<br>  The Winds all husht sit trembling on the Trees,<br>  And scarcely Whisper out a gentle Breeze.<br>  Wolves dare not Howl, but grinning softly creep,<br>  And Leopards strecht out, feign themselves asleep.<br>  Th' affrighted Herds close in their Covert lye,<br>  And to escape his Rage, with Terrour dye.<br>  Thus <i> Hoel</i> , with infernal Rage possest,<br>  With fierce desire speeds to the bloody Feast.<br>  A deadly Storm does on his Forehead lowr,<br>  Himself his Rage, <i> Arthur</i>  his Hopes devour.<br>  Breathing out Death he march'd, but at mid-day,<br>  He stands by Heav'n arrested in his way.<br>  <br>     The Air serene a black thick Cloud appear'd,<br>  And as it hover'd o'er their Heads, were heard<br>  Celestial Flutes, and Harps divinely Strung,<br>  With Hymns and <i> Hallelujahs</i>  Set and Sung<br>  By the best Masters of the Quire above,<br>  With Bliss transported, and inspir'd with Love.<br>  Whilst <i> Hoel</i>  and his Friends pleas'd, and amaz'd,<br>  Listen'd, and on the Scene descending gaz'd:<br>  The broken Cloud, pours out pure Floods of Light,<br>  Show'rs of Celestial Rays transcendent bright,<br>  And Storms of Splendor, dazling Mortal Sight.<br>  Th' illustrious Tempest does on <i> Hoel</i>  beat,<br>  Who falls astonish'd, headlong from his Seat.<br>  Confounded with unsufferable Day,<br>  Groveling in Glory on the shining Way,<br>  And with bright Ruin overwhelm'd, he lay.<br>  'Twas then, a soft, still Heav'nly Voice, that broke<br>  From out the Cloud, to trembling <i> Hoel</i>  spoke.<br>  'Gainst me, what Fury did thy Arms Engage?<br>  What mov'd thee with inexorable Rage<br>  Vain Man, to persecute my Saints and Me?<br>  In vain thou seek'st to baffle Heav'n's Decree.<br>  Vain is thy Force, and impotent thy Hate,<br>  Too weak thy Arms, to stem the Tyde of Fate.<br>  The Torrent bears thy faint Resistance down,<br>  Retire, or in Eternal Ruin Drown.<br>  <br>     Then <i> Hoel</i>  thus, O tell me, who thou art,<br>  Great Spirit, and thy Will to me impart.<br>  Tell me if Errour has my Feet misled,<br>  What safer Paths I may hereafter tread.<br>  <br>     The Voice reply'd:<br>  I am the Christians <i> God</i> , whom you pursue.<br>  Go meet my Servant <i> Arthur</i> , he shall shew<br>  At large, what thou hast to believe, what do.<br>  The Scene here disappear'd, his Lords come round,<br>  And rais'd reviving <i> Hoel</i>  from the Ground.<br>  Who marches on, the <i> British</i>  Prince to find,<br>  And Act not what himself, but Heav'n design'd.<br>  With anxious Thoughts the Vision he revolves,<br>  And to Obey Heav'n's high Command resolves.<br>  Whilst to his Lords the Vision he relates,<br>  They find themselves advanc'd to <i> Conda</i> 's Gates.<br>  <br>     <i> Arthur</i>  mean time, to whom great <i> Raphael</i> 's word,<br>  Unshaken Hopes, and Courage did afford;<br>  Proceeded on his Way, but sent before<br>  Embassadors to <i> Hoel</i> , to explore<br>  His temper, and the Genius of his Court,<br>  That he just steps might take by their Report.<br>  He chose out to discharge this weighty Trust,<br>  Valiant <i> Pollador</i> , <i> Roderick</i>  the Just;<br>  And Faithful <i> Galbut</i> , Friends that in distress,<br>  (A thing unknown to Courts) their Love express.<br>  Soon after <i> Hoel</i>  had his Entrance made,<br>  At the same City they arriv'd, and staid<br>  But little, for th' admission which they pray'd.<br>  Then <i> Hoel</i>  first the <i> Briton</i> s thus addrest,<br>  Let no sad Thought your pious Prince molest.<br>  A Message sent from Heav'n preventing yours,<br>  To me great Joy, Safety to him procures.<br>  Friendship and Love, fill my enlighten'd Mind,<br>  From Hatred purg'd, from Treachery refin'd.<br>  Return, and let your Valiant Leader know,<br>  His God has to a Friend, transfrom'd his Foe.<br>  Tell him he's safe from all intended Harms,<br>  And that I hast, t' Embrace him in my Arms.<br>  <br>     With Regal Bounty, he to all presents<br>  Rich Swords, and various splendid Ornaments.<br>  To <i> Arthur</i>  sends a Chariot, dazling bright,<br>  That to the Sun return'd redoubled Light.<br>  And Horses of th' <i> Iberian</i>  Noble Race,<br>  That right Descent from the swift <i> Eurus</i>  trace.<br>  Bold, Gen'rous, Sprightly, as th' Illustrious Breed,<br>  That in th' Etherial, blue Enclosures Feed.<br>  That thro Heav'n's Wast, with the Sun's Chariot play,<br>  And govern Time, by carrying round the Day.<br>  Their Furniture of Gold, their Bridles Gold,<br>  And golden Bits, their champing Mouths did hold.<br>  They hast and all their Diligence employ,<br>  To fill Just <i> Arthur</i> 's Mind, with Peace and Joy.<br>  To him returning they impart at large,<br>  The kind, endearing Things they had in Charge.<br>  As when his Sons to <i> Jacob</i>  did relate,<br>  That <i> Joseph</i> , liv'd, and liv'd in Regal State;<br>  Telling of all his Riches, Power, Renown,<br>  <i> Egypt</i> 's Support, and Prop to<i>  Pharoah</i> 's Crown.<br>  Resistless Floods of sudden Pleasure Roll<br>  Along his Veins, and break in on his Soul.<br>  He sinks beneath the pressure of his Joy,<br>  And <i> Joseph</i> 's Life, does almost his destroy.<br>  Then Doubts and Fears, his Joys, high Tyde oppose,<br>  From which Contention fiercer Tempests rose.<br>  While his cross Passions fight with equal Power,<br>  Each Triumphs in his turn, as Conquerour.<br>  The <i> Patriarch</i>  in this Distraction lost,<br>  Is in each Storm with equal Danger tost.<br>  But when the Chariots and rich Train he saw,<br>  He did from thence fresh Life and Vigour draw.<br>  His Breast from all contending Passions freed,<br>  Calm Joy, and unmolested Peace succeed.<br>  Enough the <i> Patriarch</i>  was heard to Cry,<br>  I'll hast to <i> Joseph</i> 's Arms, and in them Dye.<br>  So when Just <i> Arthur</i>  heard the Message first,<br>  His wavering Mind with Fears and wise Distrust,<br>  And rising Tydes of suddain Joy was tost,<br>  Uncertain which strong Passion press'd him most.<br>  But when he saw the Presents <i> Hoel</i>  sent,<br>  His Doubts suppress'd, he grew more Confident.<br>  And his calm Mind eas'd of his anxious Cares,<br>  T' embrace his new, and generous Friend prepares.<br>  <br>     And now advancing Night the Sky invades,<br>  While close pursu'd by the Victorious Shades.<br>  The Rayes that faintly from the Ground recoil,<br>  On the green Fields, let fall their pearly spoil.<br>  When <i> Arthur</i>  to his secret Joys retires,<br>  Where his exhaling Soul to Heav'n aspires,<br>  In sacred Anhelations, and inflam'd Desires.<br>  Fixt Contemplation feeds his Hope and Love,<br>  With rapt'rous Preludes to the Joys above.<br>  His ravish'd Eyes view the unmeasur'd Bliss,<br>  In the next Life enjoy'd, believ'd in this.<br>  So <i> David</i>  often pass'd the silent Night,<br>  And in his Transports felt sublime Delight,<br>  Surpassing all that mighty Monarchs have,<br>  That his own Crown, and all his Triumphs gave.<br>  While baser Birds the humble Valley love,<br>  And sing contented with their little Grove;<br>  The Eagle's generous Pride does noble rise<br>  To Heav'n, and thence does this low World despise.<br>  Scorning a Vulgar Bough, he thinks he sees<br>  Woods in the Clouds, and hanging Groves of Trees.<br>  Thither he hasts, and leaves th' ignoble Brood,<br>  That aim no higher, to their Shrubs and Wood.<br>  If to his Prey he stoops, ashamed he flies<br>  Back to his airy Dwelling in the Skies.<br>  Where in the Clouds he hides his Royal Head,<br>  Safe from the Snares, that watchful Fowlers spread.<br>  So Men of courser Mould, and baser Birth,<br>  Pleas'd with the Dust lye grov'ling on the Earth.<br>  For Food their Souls all foul and bloated, seek<br>  The Damps and Steams, that from its Bowels reek.<br>  While Men divinely Born, still upwards move,<br>  And scorn this World, that courts in vain their Love.<br>  In Flames of Zeal, and Pangs of pure Desire,<br>  These to the Seats of Light and Peace aspire.<br>  Where they converse with the blest Minds above,<br>  And wonder what on Earth invites Mens Love.<br>  This Molehill Earth has lost its former Charms,<br>  Molehill for Bulk, and Stings wherewith it swarms.<br>  With Wonder they observe how Mortals Pride,<br>  Can into Kingdoms this small Heap divide.<br>  How one t' enlarge the Empire he has got,<br>  Invades the Borders of his Neighbour's spot.<br>  How this proud Monarch of a Turf, is vext<br>  With restless cares, to dispossess the next.<br>  As Heav'ns vast Globes that fill the World with Light,<br>  Seem little Balls to distant Mortals sight,<br>  That in the most capacious Planets, we<br>  No room for States, and large Dominions see.<br>  So these more noble Minds advanc'd so high,<br>  Believe the same of us, that from the Sky,<br>  The low-hung Earth's contracted Body Spy.<br>  They keep above free from the fatal Nets,<br>  That for unwary Feet the Tempter sets.<br>  Free from the Earth's dark smoke, and endless Noise,<br>  They dwell in Peace, and feed on Heav'nly Joys.<br>  Such Pleasures <i> Arthur </i> while retir'd, enjoy'd,<br>  And wish'd he ever might be thus employ'd.<br>  <br>     And now th' radiant Gates of th' Eastern Sky,<br>  Unbar'd by bright <i>

quick, and every Tomb<br>  Labours with Life, and grows a fruitful Womb.<br>  <br>     But how the Dead are chang'd, their Bodies more <br>  Unlike each other, than their Souls before!<br>  How

within.<br>  Ugly and Fiend-like, from their Graves they Crawl,<br>  And on the ground, like bloated Vermin, sprawl.<br>  And like them too, their Bodies have their Birth,<br>  From putred Damps and Vapours in the Earth.<br>  So Serpents that entangled lay asleep,<br>  From out their Beds disturb'd, and waken'd creep.<br>  They hiss, and cast their fiery Eyes around,<br>  And with their loathsome Bellies mark the ground.<br>  For flight their poisonous Volumes they display,<br>  And urg'd with Fear and Anguish, hast away.<br>  So this foul Brood are forc'd their Graves to leave,<br>  And to the Ground their grov'ling Bellies cleave.<br>  Earthy and Black, confin'd so long to Night,<br>  They dread the Horrours of the chearful Light.<br>  Amazing change! see, some of these were they,<br>  Whose Heads were Crown'd, whose Hands did Scepters sway.<br>  These did rich Purple, and fine Linnen wear,<br>  And every Meal fed on delicious Fare.<br>  That hideous Thing, that for a Covert seeks,<br>  With hollow Eyes, fal'n Jaws, and ghastly Cheeks,<br>  That monstrous Thing, was once, when kept with Care,<br>  Proud of its Beauty, and look'd wondrous Fair.<br>  Set off with all the Ornaments, that please<br>  The Eye, and pamper'd with Luxurious Ease.<br>  But how the guilty Crowd, wreckt with Despair,<br>  With dismal Cries fill all the Ecchoing Air;<br>  When they the Trumpet's dreadful Summons hear,<br>  And find the Universal Judgment near!<br>  Back to their Graves, the ugly Monsters fly,<br>  And in those Coverts would for ever ly.<br>  They call aloud for Death, and wish they might<br>  Melt to thin Air, be drown'd, and lost in Night.<br>  <br>     But when Blest Minds their Bodies meet, no Pair<br>  Can look more Beautiful, and charming Fair.<br>  The happy Souls shoot swiftly thro' the Sky,<br>  And to the Graves and Sepulchers they fly.<br>  Where they their long forsaken Bodies greet,<br>  Which, like old Friends, they with fresh Pleasure meet.<br>  Bodies, that seem, they are so Pure and Bright,<br>  All thicken'd Glory, close compacted Light;<br>  Purg'd and refin'd from all that's course and gross,<br>  As melted Gold throws off the

Lustre strike,<br>  Were those, that once their Excellence disguis'd,<br>  Liv'd here oppress'd, and like their Lord, despis'd.<br>  Welcom to them this long expected Hour,<br>  Safe by their Judge's  Favour, from his Power.<br>  High Tides of Joy into their Bosoms run,<br>  And Everlasting Life they feel begun.<br>  This shall past Griefs in deep Oblivion drown,<br>  Compleat their Triumphs, and their Virtues Crown.<br>  These in the Spring, great Care and Toil bestow'd,<br>  And water'd with their Tears, the Seed they sow'd.<br>  The Harvest now their happy Hours employs,<br>  In reaping Pleasures and Immortal Joys.<br>  Bright Cherubims descending thro' the Air<br>  To these blest Men with speedy Flight Repair,<br>  Then to the gen'ral Doom aloft they fly,<br>  And on their Wings

 From the fierce Terrour of so bright a Day.<br>  And impious Men in no less Horror fly<br>  To all the Shades, and Coverts they descry.<br>  Mountains and Rocks their fruitless Cries invite,<br>  To fall, and hide them from the Judge's Sight,<br>  For rise they must, and lose their vain Desire,<br>  Caught up in Whirlwinds, and in Storms of Fire.<br>  Before the Judge the Pris'ners stand in

wanton Streams of soft Delights convey<br>  Charm'd Souls, that with the treach'rous Tyde must go,<br>  To the dead Lake of Pain and endless Wo.<br>  How first they lik'd the dark and lonesome Road<br>  That leads to Bliss, and the blest Minds Abode.<br>  How when in Shades they mourn'd, a Heav'nly Ray<br>  Darted a welcome, tho imperfect Day.<br>  How Vertue's guidance they impolor'd and gain'd,<br>  And what blest Converse with her they maintain'd.<br>  How thro' dark Paths she did their Feet conduct,<br>  Correct the wanderers, and the rest instruct.<br>  How by her Aids they bore tempestuous Shocks,<br>  Climb'd o'er opposing Hills, and hanging Rocks<br>  Till they at length the Peaceful Realms did gain,<br>  Where Joys Divine, and endless Transports Reign.<br>  How sweet and fair Crown'd Innocence appears,<br>  No more tost on the Waves of Hopes and Fears?<br>  On mortal Face such Beauties never shone,<br>  Like those of Virtue, seated on her Throne.<br>  <br>     Next this, th' Apostate Angels are accus'd,<br>  That open Force, or secret Arts they us'd<br>  To set their Leader, on th' Eternal's Throne,<br>  Subvert Christ's Empire and advance their own.<br>  That Man by them seduc'd, did first Rebel,<br>  Relinquish'd Heav'n, and to their Party fell.<br>  That they the curst Defection did support,<br>  And new Born Men, to new Rebellions Court.<br>  That they, with indefatigable Care,<br>  Fresh Heats fomented, and renew'd the War.<br>  Whence Plagues and Desolation wide, and vast,<br>  And uncontroll'd Destruction laid all waste<br>  Hence <i> Noah</i> 's

    Next <i> Cain</i> 's Rebellious Offspring are accus'd,<br>  As Heav'n's inveterate Foes, who long abus'd<br>  Goodness Divine, whom Everlasting Love<br>  And Life Eternal, had no Charms to move.<br>  They would no reconciling Terms embrace,<br>  Alike by Threats unchang'd, or Acts of Grace.<br>  They did with Wine and Noise the Method find,<br>  To Calm a Conscious, self-revenging Mind.<br>  To lay asleep th' uneasie Judge within,<br>  Till they with Care and Pains, grew bold in Sin.<br>  For when the sacred Spirit  did convey<br>  Into their Breasts, a secret Heav'nly Ray,<br>  That did, where cherish'd, soon bring on the Day:<br>  With hasty Care they choak'd the new-sprung Light,<br>  Calling to Aid the Shades of Hell, and Night.<br>  Divine Compassion's Force they never felt,<br>  Nor would in Flames of Love Eternal melt.<br>  Their Hearts untouch'd did all Heav'n's strokes repel,<br>  Temper'd, and harden'd in the Forge of Hell.<br>  No Overtures of Peace, no Offers made,<br>  Tho' of an endless Kingdom, could perswade<br>  The unrelenting Rebels, to lay down<br>  Their impious Arms, to take a Heav'nly Crown.<br>  They still asserted with their latest Breath,<br>  Their fixt Confed'racy with Hell, and Death.<br>  'Tis on them charg'd, that others too that fell,<br>  Drawn by their Arts, embark'd for Death and Hell.<br>  They led them to the flowry Banks, and show'd<br>  The flatt'ring Tide, where smiling Pleasures flow'd.<br>  Where the charm'd Voyagers did careless ride,<br>  Bewitching <i> Syren</i> 's singing on their side.<br>  Till the false Flood

The sly Adulterer, that till the late<br>  Approach of Night, and silent Shades did wait,<br>  For the Caresses of the Harlot's Fed,<br>  And at the early dawn of Twilight fled;<br>  Is here upbraided, for his careful flight<br>  Of Mens, whilst he contemn'd th' Almighty's sight.<br>  <br>     Th' audacious Wretch that did Heav'n's Laws deride,<br>  And all its Thunder and dire Threats defy'd;<br>  That did cloy'd Nature to fresh Guilt excite,<br>  Beyond her own ev'n Vicious Appetite:<br>  Anti-Platonic that could pleasure take<br>  In naked Vice, and sinn'd for sinning's sake;<br>  That could abstracted from Enjoyment, sport,<br>  With Guilt, and Vice ev'n in Idea court.<br>  That did himself, so much he lov'd the Fame,<br>  The secret Triumphs of his Lusts proclaim,<br>  Strives in the Crowd to hide his guilty Head,<br>  Whilst his high Charge, and black Indictment's read.<br>  Th' astonish'd Wretch Sinks, Trembles, Dies to see<br>  Enrag'd Omnipotence, and frowning Majesty.<br>  Such deadly Torments on his Bowels feed,<br>  Such Agonies he feels, as far exceed<br>  All Shapes of Horrour, Mortals ever saw,<br>  Poets invent, or troubl'd Fancies draw.<br>  That there's a God, he gives a full Assent,<br>  On the most sure, but saddest Argument.<br>  He can his Being, and his Power attest,<br>  From the Almighty Vengeance in his Breast.<br>  Thus he at last believes, and trembles too,<br>  On the same grounds that tortur'd Spirits do.<br>  The Droll'ry that derided Heav'n's just Cause,<br>  He hears repeated, but without Applause.<br>  His Jests and bold Discourses will not fit<br>  This place, nor pass, ev'n with his Friends, for Wit.<br>  Will he his feeble Arguments produce,<br>  And make them here, renew their former Use?<br>  Will he assert his Innocence, and plead<br>  'Twas only harmless Nature he obey'd?<br>  That he to Vice did not his Mind enslave,<br>  But only pleas'd the Appetites Heav'n gave.<br>  Will he inform the Judge, it cannot be<br>  A Being Good, and Merciful, as He,<br>  Can so much Rigour to his Errors show,<br>  And make a Creature for Eternal Wo?<br>  The Wretch's bold Objections will appear,<br>  His wanton Fancy's wild Capriches here.<br>  Able no more to stifle with their Night,<br>  The Natural Dictates of his inbred Light.<br>  They can't the deadly Stings within controul,<br>  Nor ease the Horrors of his tortur'd Soul.<br>  <br>     And now less hardy Pris'ners are Arraign'd,<br>  That had not this obdurate temper gain'd.<br>  Of such a Pendulous, Distracted Mind,<br>  That oft to Heav'n, and oft to

which the Trav'llers went,<br>  Gave back, and did of their past Toil repent.<br>  But how they now abhor the Cowardize,<br>  That made them almost Conquerors, miss the Prize:<br>  Made them desert a prosperous Cause as lost,<br>  That could so many Spoils, and Triumphs boast.<br>  Curst Sloth, that could perswade them to forsake<br>  Christ's Camp, when such a Kingdom was at Stake.<br>  <br>     Each hears his aggravated Crimes at large,<br>  Devils accuse, and Conscience backs the Charge.<br>  They can't excuse, or hide their Crimes, nor fly,<br>  Nor what's the Refuge of the wretched, dy.<br>  Now let their past Enjoyments Succour give,<br>  Let Wit, and Wine their deadly Fears relieve.<br>  Let their dear Riches their Assistance lend,<br>  Hounour and Pomp th' ambitious Man defend.<br>  Let them solicite with their loudest Cries,<br>  Those Gods, they serv'd, to save their Votaries.<br>  Blest Heav'n, that Man with such a swift Career,<br>  Pursues those Toys which are so useless here.<br>  <br>     The Judge will all his Terrors now assume,<br>  And thus pronounce the Pris'ners dreadful Doom.<br>  For ever cursed Souls from me depart,<br>  As you did oft my Cause, I you desert.<br>  Go, burn in Everlasting Fire, prepar'd<br>  For Devils, take that sad, but just Reward.<br>  Sink to the Bottomless Abyss of Hell,<br>  Where Agonies, and endless Sorrow dwell.<br>  Go to those Mansions of Despair, and lie<br>  In never ceasing Torments, go, and die.<br>  <br>     The Rebels this expected Sentence past,<br>  With Thunder and Tempestuous Fire are chas'd,<br>  To

 Drink up their Blood, and gall with deadly Smart.<br>  His Wrath consumes the wretch, his Power sustains,<br>  And like fierce Poison o'er their Vitals, Reigns.<br>  They waste their Souls in Cries, and howling Moans,<br>  And spend Eternity in fruitless Groans.<br>  <br>     Now the abstrusest Paths of Providence,<br>  That gave the wisest Men so great Offence,<br>  Are so unriddl'd, and made

to <i> Arthur</i>  us'd.<br>  Now <i> Albion</i>  sinks beneath the <i> Saxon</i>  weight,<br>  So <i> Heav'n</i>  Decrees, 'tis so ordain'd  by Fate.<br>  But after ten times the Revolving Sun,<br>  His Crooked Race, has thro' the <i> Zodiack</i>  run,<br>  The Clouds dispell'd, propitious <i> Heav'n</i>  shall smile,<br>  On <i> Uter</i> 's House, and this reviving Isle.<br>  <i> Octa</i>  shall feel just <i> Heav'n</i> 's revenging Stroke,<br>  And <i> Albion</i> 's Youth shall break the <i> Saxon</i>  Yoke.<br>  Mean time, brave Prince, whom universal Love<br>  Attends beneath, and Grace

smiles with a Purple Ray,<br>  Clearing before the Sun the Eastern Way.<br>  Whose radiant Train pours from the Gates of Light,<br>  And the new Day does to new Toil invite.<br>  We the Celestial Message to obey,<br>  On a stout Ship, that in the Haven lay<br>  Ready to Sail, embark and hast away.<br>  The Sky serene, a fresh and prosperous Gale,<br>  Sprang from the Shore, and swell'd out ev'ry Sail.<br>  <i> Albion</i> 's white Cliffs and Towers we quickly lost,<br>  Standing our Course strait to the <i> Neustrian</i> 's Coast.<br>  Where when the Sun twice starting from the East,<br>  Had ran his Race, and reach'd the falling West,<br>  We safe arriv'd at fair <i> Cartinia</i> 's Port,<br>  And took our way from thence to <i> Odar</i> 's Court.<br>  <i> Odar</i> , a Prince indulgent, valiant, good,<br>  Ally'd to <i> Uter</i>  by the Mother's Blood,<br>  The barbarous <i> Goths</i>  Incursions, then withstood.<br>  His beauteous Queen, with Joy the Prince receiv'd,<br>  Her Words our Grief, her Gifts our Wants reliev'd.<br>  Here we to ease our troubled Minds remain'd,<br>  Till <i> Arthur</i>  perfect Strength and Vigour gain'd.<br>  Then taking leave, we straight direct our way<br>  Unto the Camp, where Odar's Forces lay.<br>  <br>     And as we pass'd to mitigate our Grief,<br>  And to our Woes to give Divine Relief.<br>  From his blest Tongue such <i>

Heav'n</i> 's Offspring with divine Contentment blest,<br>  Enjoy the Empire of a guiltless Breast.<br>  Tho' spoil'd by prosp'rous Robbers, still they find,<br>  The large Possessions of a peaceful Mind.<br>  <i> Content</i>  alone can all their wrongs redress,<br>  <i> Content</i> , that other name for <i> Happiness</i> .<br>  Free from Desire, they are as free from want,<br>  And from the Cares, that envied Greatness haunt.<br>  'Tis equal, if our Fortunes should augment,<br>  And stretch themselves to the same vast Extent<br>  With our Desires, or those Desires abate,<br>  Shrink, and Contract themselves, to fit our State.<br>  Pois'd on their own unshaken Base they view,<br>  All the Vicissitudes, that Time can shew.<br>  They, like tall Mountains, are advanc'd so high,<br>  That the low Clouds do all beneath them fly.<br>  Hence while loud Storm's inferiour Seats molest,<br>  They undisturb'd, enjoy soft Peace and Rest.<br>  These Men that suit their Wishes to their State,<br>  And, pleas'd still with themselves, enjoy their Fate:<br>  Whose modest <i> Passions</i>  <i> Reason</i> 's Nod obey,<br>  Are greater <i> Kings</i> , than those who Scepters sway.<br>  They can the Triumphs of a Court despise,<br>  And the rich Toys, that charm deluded Eyes.<br>  They rather choose to tame their Thirst, than have<br>  All the Supplies their Feaverish Drought can crave.<br>  Desires for <i> Freedom</i>  first make humble Suit,<br>  And modestly demand th' unlawful Fruit.<br>  But when set loose, they know not where to stay,<br>  But lawless thro' the World's Dominions stray.<br>  So subterranean <i> Vapours</i> , that contain'd<br>  In some close <i> Cavern</i> , are with Ease restrain'd,<br>  When once releas'd, ungovernable grow,<br>  And prove fierce Storms, which no Resistance know.<br>  Th' unhappy Man, slave to his wild Desire,<br>  By feeding it, foments the raging Fire.<br>  His Gains augment his unextinguish'd Thirst,<br>  With Plenty <i> Poor</i> , and with Abundance <i> Curst</i> .<br>  But greater Minds, which can themselves subdue,<br>  Preserve their Peace, and still their Joys renew.<br>  They never by a Vile, or Impious Course,<br>  Protect their Wealth from rising Tempests force.<br>  They face the Storm, and stand its fiercest Shocks,<br>  Bold as the Winds, unshaken as the Rocks.<br>  No Tempest that invades th' ambitious Breast,<br>  Can the calm Region of their Mind molest.<br>  So Winds, that Rivulets disturb, will play<br>  In harmless Breezes, on the wider Sea.<br>  <br>     Sour <i> Discontent</i>  that quarrels with our Fate,<br>  May give fresh smart, but not the old abate.<br>  Envenom'd with its Sting, each harmless loss,<br>  Grows wondrous sharp, and proves a deadly cross.<br>  Th' uneasie <i> Passion</i> 's disingenious Wit<br>  The Ill reveals, but hides the <i> Benefit</i> .<br>  It makes a Toy press with prodigious weight,<br>  And swells a Molehill, to a Mountain's height.<br>  So melancholy Men lie down, and groan,<br>  Prest with the Burden of themselves alone.<br>  Crusht with Phantastick Mountains, they despair,<br>  Their Heads are grown vast Globes too big to bear.<br>  A little Spark becomes a raging Flame,<br>  And each weak Blast, a Storm too fierce to tame.<br>  So peevish is the quarrelsome Disease,<br>  No prosp'rous Fortune can procure it Ease.<br>  Their Breasts are ne'er from inbred Tempests free,<br>  Restless as Winds, and troubled as the Sea:<br>  The Pleasure now they seek would bring Content;<br>  But when enjoy'd, 'twas somewhat else, they meant.<br>  Some absent <i> Happiness</i>  they still pursue,<br>  Dislike the present Good, and long for New.<br>  The Man now thinks he sees his Bliss, and flies<br>  With greedy Arms to grasp the

back, and mocks his hand.<br>  Sometimes he sees the beck'ning <i> Phantome</i>  here,<br>  That, when he follows, does elsewhere appear.<br>  The Wretch, though Tantaliz'd, and always crost,<br>  Yet still pursues, though still that Labour's lost.<br>  The God-like <i> Arthur</i>  with such pious words,<br>  <i> Divine</i>  Instruction, and Delight affords.<br>  <br>     And while his Language,

Grief, I labour'd to conceal.<br>  This Wonder to the World, as soon as shown,<br>  Is taken up to her Celestial Throne.<br>  Ah! what sad Accents, what a mournful Cry,<br>  What lamentable Sounds will fill the Sky,<br>  When her high Herse, shall from her Palace go<br>  Thro' weeping Throngs, in all the Pomp of Woe.<br>  So sad a Cry did wondring Nile affright,<br>  When <i> Egypt</i> 's first-born Youth were slain by Night.<br>  What Strains of Sorrow will <i> Augusta</i>  show?<br>  What Floods of Tears, sad <i> Thamisis</i> , will flow<br>  Into thy Stream, while gliding by the Dome,<br>  Where fresh erected stands her lofty Tomb.<br>  Son, mind her Presence, what a God-like Air?<br>  What Throngs of Graces in her Eyes appear?<br>  No nobler Genius, no well fashion'd Mind<br>  E'er took a Turn more happily design'd,<br>  From an Etherial Mould more labour'd and refin'd.<br>  Mild as the blest above, without serene<br>  As <i> Eden</i> 's Air, and calm as Heav'n within.<br>  No lovelyer Star adorns the <i> British</i>  Sphear,<br>  Ah! might she longer in her Orb appear,<br>  That her Celestial Influence might Flow<br>  In chearing Streams on all the Isle

of Grief that here swell'd <i> Arthur</i> 's Breast,<br>  Broke Sleeps soft Fetters, and dissolv'd his Rest.<br>  The Airy Objects, that without did wait,<br>  Now rush in by the Senses open Gate.<br>
