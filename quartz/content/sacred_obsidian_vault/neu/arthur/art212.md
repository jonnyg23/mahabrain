 most desolate maid!<br>  Whose beauty seems as peerless as the skies;<br>  Whose sorrows are as early flowers which droop<br>  When frost-charms glitter in their chilly eyes;<br>  Were these the chances strange which drove thee here<br>  All unattended, save by this sad steed?"<br>  <br>  Then, looking up to him, she said: "Fair knight!<br>  Thy voice is soft, and low, and free from guile;<br>  Thy eyes seem full of pity to behold<br>  How I have fallen from my good estate;<br>  For hither fled I through the weary night,<br>  My purpose to escape these savage men,<br>  And come to Guinevere at Camelot;<br>  For then, indeed, some noble knight, intent<br>  On deeds of valour, might adventure forth,<br>  And re-instate me and my sisters dear,<br>  Who now are held in bondage by our foes."<br>  <br>  To which, with eager gladness, said the king:<br>  "Gather thy garments round thee: dry thy tears:<br>  Mount thy good steed, and lead me to the place.<br>  For never yet adventure have I had<br>  So full of wonder, and of promise too;<br>  My heart feels younger, fresh blood through my brains<br>  Rolls madly like a river in the spring;<br>  Now through my mind there ever come and go<br>  Dim visions which the magic mirror threw<br>  When Merlin showed me all my life to be<br>  Stretched out before us like a landscape fair;<br>  Then felt I as I now feel -- never man<br>  Was moved so much, if the intent were small."<br>  <br>  Now high in heaven the lark sang clear and shrill,<br>  While these twain wandered in the trackless woods;<br>  And ever as they went upon their way,<br>  In soft sweet syllables she told him all,<br>  While on her face he looked, and she on his.<br>  And like the moon, which comes while yet 'tis day,<br>  Hanging upon the edge of some dark cloud<br>  Which serves to throw its saddened beauty forth;<br>  So she did place her hands upon her face,<br>  Hiding her eyes, whose brightness shone the more<br>  The more she strove their brightness to conceal.<br>  <br>  "What eyes are these," he asked, "which shine so bright?<br>  These are not eyes, but surely two bright stars<br>  Which glimmer through the mists of coming eve."<br>  "Fair knight," she said, "you blame, but flatter me;<br>  These are but eyes: you do not blame the stars<br>  Because the spirits of the moonlit sea<br>  Do sing to them: the stars are not to blame.<br>  So blame not me; and if my eyes seem bright<br>  To your vain fancy, say it is the gloom<br>  Which makes them seem so, or the happy fate<br>  Which led me to you; and, my heart being full,<br>  My thanks must needs be spoken by my eyes."<br>  <br>  To which the king: "Thine eyes more glorious grow,<br>  And fill me with strange wonder and strange doubts."<br>  Then she, in anxious haste: "Far off I see<br>  A glimmer in the east, it is the moon;<br>  And, see, the trees are fewer, and beyond<br>  The open country; further on the wood,<br>  Where was my father's castle: let us on."<br>  <br>  Then through the daisied meadows, where the flowers,<br>  Whispering "Beware!" looked shyly at the king;<br>  Along the banks of many languid pools,<br>  From which came slimy things to gloat at them;<br>  By gloomy groves, whence came the mocking sound<br>  Of "Cuckoo!  Cuckoo!" all the livelong day;<br>  And round the wave-washed melancholy coast,<br>  O'er which the gathering clouds kept awful watch,<br>  While sea-gulls wheeled and shrieked around the cliffs;<br>  And by the plains where many herons piped,<br>  He went with her; until, at length, they came<br>  Unto the borders of a dismal wood.<br>  She took his hand, and led him to a path<br>  Which ran between two rows of savage pines;<br>  And down this path she went, and he with her.<br>  <br>  Cooing of ringdoves calling to their mates<br>  Betokened that the day was waning fast.<br>  Soon the drear forest and the evening shades<br>  Enfolded them; and night came on apace.<br>  Then dark clouds hemmed the sad and passionful moon,<br>  And not one single ray of gentle light<br>  Lingered amid that weird and awful place.<br>  Ere long they came to where a mountain gorge<br>  Lay coiled beneath a dreadful precipice,<br>  All thick with firs and many a mountain yew,<br>  High in the sky; and as the tempest rose<br>  The branches bent and broke, and thickly fell<br>  Around them; and huge rocks forsook the cliffs<br>  And crashed and thundered down the dismal gorge;<br>  And from afar a noise of waters came<br>  Like the dull rolling moan of many seas;<br>  And leaping cataracts foamed and hissed along,<br>  And tumbled to the plains somewhere below.<br>  <br>  Close to his face he felt her tangled hair<br>  In snake-like folds twining around his neck,<br>  While wan as wintry dawn did seem his face.<br>  Then, when a hollow gust swept down the gorge,<br>  Moaning and mocking like a thing of sin,<br>  In melancholy mood she crept to him,<br>  And hid her cold face close to his, and looked<br>  Into his wildered eyes, and clung to him<br>  And "Arthur!" cried, and all the mountain sides<br>  Echoed "Arthur!"  Then when calmer grown,<br>  Because the storm was passed and it was light,<br>  She murmured "Not far off my land doth lie--<br>  Soft lawns, cool streams, and woodlands wondrous.<br>  Come, prithee, sweet, and let us leave this place."<br>  So ever on they went, until they came<br>  To a rare valley nestled 'mid the hills<br>  Like a sweet thought within a lover's heart;<br>  Wherein there was a little wood all filled<br>  With choicest scents and most delicious sounds,<br>  Which the sad clouds withdrew far off to hear;<br>  While full of love the tender moon came forth.<br>  "All this is mine, and may be thine," said she.<br>  <br>  To which the king, a melancholy man:<br>  "Is this thy father's castle?  Where are they,<br>  Thy brethren seven and thy sad sisters three?<br>  For whose dear sakes, and thine, and to add fame<br>  Unto my name and to the Table Round,<br>  Hither came I, led by thy guileful tongue.<br>  This is no earthly place: these sights and sounds<br>  Are most unholy; prithee, lead me forth<br>  And leave me to myself, and let me go<br>  To my brave knights and to my Guinevere!"<br>  <br>  And even as he spoke this well-loved name <br>  His mind ran back unto the happy day<br>  When all the land was filled with holy joy<br>  Because he called his Guinevere "Dear wife!"<br>  But when he cast his eyes upon the ground<br>  And they met hers which passionately uplooked,<br>  A sickly sadness came and stayed with him.<br>  <br>  Which seeing, she with anxious tone outspoke:<br>  "Now, good sir knight, I trow thou art not pleased,<br>  And wherefore?  For these woods have sights to please,<br>  And all of them are mine; say what thou wilt.<br>  Should'st thou be merry?--then in truth no lack<br>  Of food for merriment shall here be found.<br>  And why not merry?  I am never sad,<br>  Who most have cause to be; for now, alas!<br>  I see thou lov'st me not."<br>  <br>                                          To which the king:<br>  "Woman with flame-like hair and lustful eyes,<br>  Thy pretty syllables and dainty smiles,<br>  Nought heed I; for I know now who thou art.<br>  Not many moons have spent their mellow strength<br>  Since by such arts as thine was Merlin trapped;<br>  But, know thou that I am not one of those<br>  Whose passions are their masters, not their serfs;<br>  Soft arms and speechful eyes and rosy lips<br>  I hold as nothing; therefore let me go!"<br>  <br>  To which the guileful damsel, creeping close,<br>  And twining both her arms about his neck,<br>  And hiding his still face amid her hair,<br>  And pressing her hot lips upon his lips,<br>  With many a tearful start, replied, and said:<br>  "Some there are who are sad, and, yet, therein<br>  Find greater pleasure than in all their joys.<br>  So be it, sweet, with you when you are sad.<br>  And wherefore sad?  Answer, ye moonlit woods!<br>  O sweet!  for thou art sweeter than the dawn,<br>  Sweeter than violets by south winds kissed,<br>  Sweeter than coo of doves when love is young,<br>  Or than the moon when she is in her prime.<br>  I love thee!  For it fell upon a day<br>  That coming up to Camelot at the jousts<br>  (When deeds of daring thick as daisies were)<br>  I saw thee with thy true and goodly knights,<br>  And then I swore that I would make thee mine<br>  Ere the young moon had burnt herself away."<br>  <br>  While this she said, behold the mellow moon<br>  Grew wan and wanner; and the happy stars<br>  Slid from the sky like smiles from some fair face;<br>  All unattended came the simple dawn;<br>  The forest was astir with many sounds--<br>  Birds, brooks, and fairy footfalls everywhere,<br>  And gleeful laughter only half suppressed:<br>  Then high in heaven a lark sang sadly shrill,<br>  Like a lost spirit in a world of woe.<br>  <br>  Then he: "If good things in this place there be,<br>  Or in the heavens above, or earth below,<br>  Who have of knighthood charge, I pray their aid."<br>  Thereat she smiled a weird and hollow smile,<br>  And put her lips close to his clammy brow,<br>  And strove to comfort him with honeyed words.<br>  <br>  To which the king: "Thy tender voice I hear<br>  Sounding like whispers from the underworld;<br>  Thy eyes of flame my weary senses pierce;<br>  Thy snake-like tresses coil around my neck;<br>  Upon my parched lips hot kisses fall;<br>  And soft arms fold me in a fond embrace:-- <br>  But not thy gleeful words, thy eyes of flame,<br>  Nor tangled hair which coils around my neck,<br>  Nor kisses hot, nor arms which fondly twine,<br>  Can make me break mine all-accustomed vows;<br>  For I am cold as stone, and cannot melt<br>  Before the white heat of a woman's love.<br>  <br>            *     *     *     *     *     *<br>  <br>  And thou wilt give me all these wondrous woods,<br>  And make me lord of many tables round!<br>  O wily snakes, that show your speckled sides,<br>  Ye are not wily as a woman's tongue!<br>  Take off thy lips, they seem as hot as flame,<br>  And when they fall upon my haggard face<br>  Do hiss like sparks that fall into a pool.<br>  <br>            *     *     *     *     *     *<br>  <br>  Come forth, O sun!  and cheer me, or I faint.<br>  Afar thou shinest in the happy south,<br>  But shunnest this sad place. O, Guinevere!<br>  Mine own dear wife!  where art thou?  Tristram, too,<br>  The truest knight of all my Table Round;<br>  And thou, most gentle Lady of the Lake,<br>  Who gavest me my sword, and bid me forth<br>  To consecrate the right and cleave the wrong,<br>  Where, too, art thou, when most thy aid I need?"<br>  <br>  Now high in heaven a lark sang very clear.<br>  "Hush!  what!  that sound?  Do'st hear it?  'Tis the lark<br>  Which called me forth to this adventure sad,<br>  And now, perchance, doth come to lead me back,<br>  Sent by the gentle Lady of the Lake."<br>  <br>  And now the birds stopped half-way in their song,<br>  The weird sad voices died amid the woods,<br>  And sudden silence dropped around the place.<br>  A little breeze up-sprang, and tossed her hair<br>  In savage splendour round about her face;<br>  Her lips were cold and bloodless; with both hands<br>  She trust him from her, while with stony eyes<br>  She gazed at him; then, hissing through closed teeth,<br>  "Fool!" turned away and fled among the woods.<br>  <br>  Then high in heaven sang the happy lark,<br>  And dropped and dropped, until it rested safe<br>  Within the spreading branches of an oak.<br>  And, as with eager haste he raised his hands<br>  To catch the bird, he heard a rustling sound,<br>  And, turning round, with wondering eyes he saw<br>  Sir Tristram and the Lady of the Lake.<br>  <br>  She took his hand, and led him forth to where<br>  The silly sea toyed with the tangled weed;<br>  And in this quiet creek a vessel lay.<br>  Embarking here with Tristram, from afar<br>  Up-sprang fair winds; so that in one day's space<br>  He found his wistful knights at Camelot.<br>  And all these wondered where the king had been,<br>  And marvelled howo much older he had grown;<br>  But none knew, save those twain who led him forth,<br>  Sir Tristram and the Lady of the Lake.<br>
