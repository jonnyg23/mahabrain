 <p align="center"> ACT I.<br>     </p>     
 <p align="left"> <br>      SCENE I.--<i> In the edge of a wood a cavalcade has dismounted and the horses      are tethered among the trees. In the background</i>  MERLIN <i> sits alone on      a high place, looking at the towers of Cameliard, which are seen hazily in      the distance. A group of Knights, seated in the foreground under a large oak      tree, have just ended their repast and the attendants bring them beakers of      wine. In this group may be noted </i> SIR LIONEL, SIR ECTOR DE MARIS, SIR BORS      DE GANYS, <i> and</i>  SIR GALAHAULT. KING ARTHUR<i>  and</i>  SIR LAUNCELOT <i> walk      apart in private talk.</i> <br>      <br>      ECTOR. Thou hast not loved, Sir Bors.<br>      <br>      LIONEL.           But <i> I</i>       love, cousin--<br>      As fair a maid as e'er wore taffeta.<br>      By the Round Table, lords, I think no knight<br>      A truer lover! Yet hold I with my brother,<br>      Friendship is nobler.<br>      <br>      ECTOR. Were thy lady here,<br>      Thou durst not say it.<br>      <br>      LIONEL. Why, who tells truth to women?<br>      They love us better for a soft deceit<br>      And feed on lies like sweetmeats.<br>      <br>      ECTOR.                                      There      are friends<br>      Who play the rogue too and are branded false.<br>      But false in love too often is a jest<br>      Or flaunts itself for virtue. Still my faith is<br>      That loyal love is the most goodly fruit<br>      That grows out of men's hearts.<br>      <br>      BORS.                                   But      loyal friendship,<br>      A fruit let fall by angels out of heaven,<br>      A thing to die for!<br>      <br>      GALAHAULT.     Ay, at need; but love<br>      A thing to live for--this is bitterer.<br>      <br>      LIONEL. Call you life bitter?<br>      <br>      GALAHAULT.                   Is      the rind so sweet?<br>      I can conceive a man so weary of life<br>      That he would quaff mandragora to the drains<br>      As revellers drink wine. Do you conceive,<br>      His nearest friend beseeching, such a man<br>      Would forego his carouse? But if his love<br>      Came to him saying "Live, for I bid thee live,"<br>      Though life and love alike were bitterness,<br>      He would pour out the sweet death in the dust.<br>      <br>      BORS. Love seeks a guerdon; friendship is as God,<br>      Who gives and asks no payment.<br>      <br>      GALAHAULT.                         Tut,      ye are boys.<br>      Ye deem of love as children play at arms<br>      And wit not what a slain man is. Heard ye<br>      Never of Arcite and of Palamon<br>      That were good knights of old and as true friends<br>      As e'er faced death together? Yet one day,<br>      Seeing a fair lady in a garden close,<br>      They fell a-wrangling. Faith, they were as twins,<br>      Inseparate from the womb; and yet swift love,<br>      In less space thatn a man might look and say<br>      "Lo there!" hath sundered them.<br>      <br>      BORS.                                    Look      where the King<br>      And Launcelot walk together. Think you that they<br>      Would fall out for a girl?<br>      <br>      GALAHAULT.             Strange      things ere now<br>      Have happened and the memory of men<br>      Outlived them. Yonder, dreaming in the sun,<br>      Behold the towers of Cameliard! Think <i> you</i> <br>      The King, for love of Launcelot, would yield<br>      The white enlacing arms of Guenevere,<br>      Who waits there for the splendor of his coming<br>      To make her Queen of Britain?<br>      <br>      LIONEL.                                 Launcelot      would,<br>      If he were Arthur and Arthur Lancelot.<br>      And yet I think that Arthur's love is thin<br>      And substanceless to that which Launcelot<br>      Bears the mysterious Lady of the Hills<br>      Whom none have ever seen.<br>      <br>      GALAHAULT.                    No      fickle lover<br>      Can prove the glory and the might of love.<br>      The King has loved--and more than twice, I think.<br>      <br>      LIONEL. Ay, he has been a gay dog in his day.<br>      <br>      BORS. He is the sun. If there be spots in him<br>      I will not look upon them.<br>      <br>      LIONEL.                               Nay, brother,<br>      God shield I speak ill of the King. No man<br>      This side of dotage loves him more than I.<br>      I spoke of trivial faults. What one of us,<br>      Unless it be yourself or Launcelot,<br>      Hath not the like to answer? Even the tale<br>      The common tongue hath of the Queen of Orkney--<br>      How is it more? They knew not of the bond<br>      That made their sin more than the heat of youth<br>      Might--<br>      <br>      BORS. Hush! it is half treason but to think<br>      What we give words to.<br>      <br>      ECTOR.              Morgause,      the Queen of Orkney!<br>      A strange dark woman!<br>      <br>      GALAHAULT.             But      a beauteous one.<br>    </p>

 <p align="left"> <br>      ARTHUR. We almost touch our journey's end, my lords.<br>      Expected joy is like a maid that nears<br>      With coy delay and timorous advance,<br>      Eluding our stretched hands. So have I thought<br>      To-day would never reach us; yet it dawns.<br>      And ere the sun sets in the western sea,<br>      Your swords shall serve a Queen.<br>      <br>      ECTOR. Long live the Princess!<br>      <br>      LIONEL. But not as princess long! Long live the Queen!<br>      A beaker to the bride!<br>      <br>      ALL. Long live the Queen!<br>    </p>     
 <p align="center"> <br>      [<i> Enter a</i>  LADY, <i> attended by a</i>  DWARF. <i> She throws <br>      herself at the King's feet</i> .]<br>    </p>     
 <p align="left"> <br>       LADY. If ever you inclined your ear to sorrow,<br>       Be pitiful and hear me!<br>       <br>       ARTHUR.                          Pray you, rise.<br>       <br>       LADY. Nay, I will statue here until you grant my prayer.<br>       <br>       ARTHUR. You wrong yourself. What is your grief?<br>       <br>       LADY. Far back within the impenetrable hills<br>      The mighty Turquine dwells--of those fierce tribes<br>       Who yet acknowledge not our Saviour Christ<br>       But worship barbarous and obscure gods,--<br>       A wicked knave!--a cruel, treacherous villain!--<br>       One whose delight is chiefly to work wrong<br>       To all that call on Mary and her Son!<br>       This unbelieving dog in his foul lair<br>       With momentary tortures racks the bones<br>       Of my true lover. Me, as well, he seized <br>       And set his love on me--if that be love <br>       Which such a beast so names--and swore an oath<br>       To bind us each, if I received him not,<br>       And make my living lord the pillow to<br>       His savage purpose. But I, by God's help,<br>       Beguiled him and escaped; and with this weak<br>       But faithful servitor, through lidless nights<br>       And days that burned like fever in my brain,<br>       Lurked in the caverns of the hills and made <br>       The wild goats my companions.--Now, for thine oath's sake<br>       And in the name of all fair ladies wronged,<br>       O King, I cry you, do me right.<br>       <br>       ARTHUR.                                Now       by <br>       My sword Excalibur, it were great shame<br>       Forever to all knighthood if thy plight<br>       Went unredressed. But I have that in hand<br>       To-day which more imports me than the wrongs<br>       Of all the world. To-day I take a wife.<br>       It were a great dishonor if the feast<br>       Were furnished and bridegroom came not. Therefore<br>       Set on with us to Cameliard. To-morrow<br>       We will set forth with all our chivalry<br>       To hawk at this foul quarry.<br>       <br>       LADY.                                     Oh, my lord,<br>       Think how each lapsing moment the quick groans<br>       Of my chained lover clamor for release.<br>       Wilt thou be like that recreant who said,<br>       "I have a wife and therefore cannot come,"<br>       When the Lord of Heaven bade him? Nay then, I see<br>       You are even as other men, whom I had thought<br>       To be almost divine. I know I come<br>       Unseasonably. Grief hath, my lord, a license<br>       To overpass the bounds of courtesy.--<br>       Oh, is there none in all this chivalry<br>       To piece his prayers to mine?<br>       <br>       LAUNCELOT.                      My       lord the King,<br>       I claim this quest. Go you to Cameliard<br>       And have no care at heart. I, with three others,<br>       Will seek and slay this Turquine, and set free<br>       His mangled captives.<br>       <br>       LADY.                              Thou and but three else?<br>       <br>       LAUNCELOT. It is sufficient.<br>       <br>       LADY.                                Alas,       you do not know<br>       The peril of the enterprise!<br>       <br>       ARTHUR.                               Fear not.<br>       It is Sir Launcelot of the Lake. He wonts not<br>       To fail of his pledged word.--My Launcelot,<br>       I had wished that you should be on my right hand;<br>       But since it may not be--Our Lady speed you!<br>       <br>       LAUNCELOT. Amen. Fair joy be to your bridal, Arthur!<br>       Farewell!--Now who's with me!<br>       <br>       LIONEL.                                    I.<br>       <br>       BORS.                                             I.<br>       <br>       ECTOR.                                               And       I.<br>       <br>       LADY. You are brave men. Come victory or defeat,<br>       I am bound to you forever.<br>       <br>       LAUNCELOT.                         Nay, we do<br>       No more but our mere duties. Lead us on.<br>       I know the mountain paths of old. Armor<br>       And steeds would cumber us. We'll go afoot,<br>       Armed no more heavily than now we stand.<br>       Farewell, my liege! And farewell, gentlemen!<br>       We'll drink your healths ere long in Camelot.<br>     </p>

 <p align="left"> <br>       ARTHUR. Ah, Galahault, with fifty men like that,<br>       I would shape this old world like a putty-ball.--<br>       Set on to Cameliard.<br>     </p>

 <p align="left"> <br>      MESSENGER.              My      lord the King!<br>      King Mark of Cornwall has renounced his fealty <br>      And with a mighty army is encamped<br>      Upon your borders. Sir Godmar, the Lord Marshal,<br>      Has ta'en the field against him, but beseeches<br>      You haste to his relief.<br>      <br>      ARTHUR.                        Now, by my crown,<br>      I will not go. The heavens conspire to block<br>      My progress to the towers that hold my bride.<br>      But stood the Archangel Michael in the way,<br>      This marriage should not wait. We will go on;<br>      To-morrow morn is time enough for Mark. <br>      Sir Galahault, our Queen shall be your charge<br>      Until these wars are over. Come, set on!<br>    </p>

 <p align="left"> <br>       LAUNCELOT. Let me rest here a moment. Nay, go on;<br>       I shall o'ertake you ere you gain the crest.<br>       Cousin, a word with you.<br>     </p>     
 <p align="center"> <br>       [<i> Exeunt all but </i> BORS <i> and</i>  LAUNCELOT.]<br>     </p>     
 <p align="left"> <br>                                              What      blessed chance<br>      Has led me hither?<br>      <br>      BORS.                  Cousin,      you called me back.<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT. Why, but to have you with me, Bors. This place<br>      Is like a sudden scene of other days<br>      That starts up in the middle of a dream;<br>      <br>      BORS. Have you been here ere now?<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT. Ay, and that time<br>      Would stand erect and vivid in my brain<br>      Though all the other puppets of the past<br>      Reeled into smoke. This is the very spot. <br>      I lay here, cousin, even here where this gaunt bramble<br>      Still tugs a meagre life out of the cleft<br>      Where it is rooted,--faint almost to death;<br>      For I had struggled through these cruel hills<br>      Three days without a crust, and my head swam<br>      And my legs wavered under me and would not<br>      Bear me upright. Down these precipitous crags<br>      And o'er these dizzy ledges I could pass<br>      No more than I could leap across yon gulf,<br>      And I lay down and thought of death, as of <br>      A gulf into whose blackness one might leap<br>      And fall forever. A long time lay I so,<br>      Too weak to struggle with impending doom,<br>      And death seemed like to yawn and swallow me.<br>      <br>      BORS. And yet you are not dead. How 'scaped you, then?<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT. God sent a blessed angel to my aid.<br>      There on the peak beyond the gulf I saw her,<br>      Standing against the sky, with garments blown,<br>      The mistress of the winds! An angel, said I?<br>      God was more kind, he sent a woman to me.<br>      <br>      BORS. The Lady of the Hills!<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT.                       Ay,      so I call her,<br>      For other name I know not.<br>      <br>      BORS.                                The      unknown lady,<br>      Whom you have made more famous than a queen!<br>      Here saw you her the first time?<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT.                         And      the last time.<br>      She was attended by a motley Fool,<br>      Who stretched his hand and pointed where I lay.<br>      She saw me and in pity of my case<br>      Sent Master Dagonet--so the Fool was called<br>      But he nowise would tell the lady's name--<br>      To help me down the pass. But she went on<br>      Alone across the summits of the hills<br>      Like some grand free Diana of the North<br>      And passed out of my sight, as daylight fades<br>      Out of the western sky. But I no more<br>      Was faint, and went my way, considering.<br>      <br>      BORS. But could you nowise find out who she was?<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT. Nowise, for Merlin met me thereupon, <br>      And brought me suddenly to Camelot,<br>      Where I was knighted. I had fain delayed<br>      But boy-like shamed to say wherefore my heart<br>      Hung back toward the hills. And so I passed <br>      Away from her and never saw her more.<br>      <br>      BORS. Even here it was you saw her?<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT.                                Ay,      even here.<br>      <br>      BORS. Why, then, should you not meet her here again?<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT. The hope of that is as the morning-star,<br>      The messenger of dawn. And in good sooth<br>      I have a feeling in my heart that soon<br>      My long and lightless service shall have end<br>      And I shall serve her seeing. But our friends<br>      Await us. I shall serve my lady better <br>      With noble actions than with idle dreams. <br>      <br>                                                                         [<i> Exeunt.</i> ]<br>      <br>      SCENE III.--<i> Cameliard.

I did not mean to be an eavesdropper,<br>      But as I entered I was charmed to silence<br>      And could not break in on so sweet a sound<br>      Before the singer ceased.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE.               I      thank you, madam;<br>      I am not in the mood for compliments to-day.<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE.

But I do nothing, save of my free will;<br>      Let the vain gossips babble as they please.<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE. I have just come from the Great Hall. You'll have<br>      A royal ritual, sweetheart,--such a retinue<br>      Of dames and damosels, barons and knights,<br>      As Cæsar's self could hardly muster in Imperial Rome.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. Is Peredure without?<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE. Gods, hear this woman! I tell her of her wedding;<br>      She answers me--"Is Peredure without?"<br>      Ha, ha, ha, ha! Now what would Arthur say<br>      To find himself so hindward in your thoughts?<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. Peredure is not like my other brothers,<br>      Wolf-eyed, thick-bearded, fond of dealing blows.<br>      There's something of the woman in his nature<br>      That makes his manliness a finer thing.<br>      He has the courage of a gentle heart--<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE.

Arthur and he<br>      Are like two almonds in a single shell<br>      That silly maids make matron wishes on.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. I had a strange dream yesternight. Methought<br>      An unknown knight stood by my bed, and as <br>      I lay spell-bound in dim bewilderment,<br>      Cried "I am Launcelot!"--and I awoke.<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE. He came, then, in a dream. I thought he would not<br>      Be so discourteous as to keep away entirely.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. Why talk ye all of Launcelot?<br>      His fame spreads westward over Wales like dawn.<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE. He has the reputation of all virtue.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. And does his reputation top himself?<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE. Sometimes a bonfire imitates the dawn.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. Sometimes, too, dawn is taken for a bonfire;--<br>      I care not. Dawn or bonfire, it is nothing to me.<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE. Nor to me neither, but I chafe<br>      To hear the gabble that they make about him.<br>      Why, child, the world is gone mad at his heels!<br>      They tell of valor that despises odds,<br>      And courtesy that throws prudence to the drains--<br>      Such tales they tell of him! And as for women,<br>      There is not maid nor wife in Camelot<br>      Whose heart is not a spaniel at his feet.<br>      And yet they say he takes no fruit of it<br>      But is as spotless as Saint Dorothy--<br>      With such a tittle-tattle of his purity!--<br>      Bah, when the King and he are in one cry!<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE.

 <p align="left"> <br>       GUENEVERE. How now, sir? You look soberly.<br>       <br>       DAGONET. I? I am as merry as a skull, and that is always grinning, as you       would see if you could but look beneath the skin.<br>       <br>       GUENEVERE. A grim jest, sirrah.<br>       <br>       DAGONET. Ay, it is ill jesting at a wedding. Aristophanes himself, who first       wore motley, would go hang for lack of a laugh. For your good unctuous jest       must have a soil of light hearts or it will not grow; and there is a predisposition       at weddings to solemnity.<br>       <br>       GUENEVERE. Nay, now you are out; for a wedding is a joyous matter.<br>       <br>      DAGONET. But no laughing matter, my lady. For various wise philosophers have      observed that in moments of most exquisite pleasure the expression of the      face is solemn. What signifies a wedding? Harmony. Now the essence of a jest      is contradiction, but that comes after the wedding. So no more jests from      me, my lady, till you have done with eating green cheese, which is excellent      diet for the moonstruck--but I prefer Stilton.<br>       <br>       MORGAUSE. Tell us, then, good Dagonet, what is the most pregnant occasion       of jesting.<br>       <br>      DAGONET. A funeral, for the long faces of the company provoke the merry devil      in the brain as inevitably as a Puritan calls out mockery from the reprobate.      I have known an accidental rasp on a viol to set all the mourners--except      the paid ones--in a titter.<br>       <br>                      [<i> Sings</i> .]       With ribald chalkings on his coat<br>                                Sir       Pompous struts the street,<br>                             And       wanton boys put walnut-shells<br>                                On       stately Tabby's feet.<br>                                             Ri       fol de riddle rol.<br>       <br>       GUENEVERE. Make jests at my funeral, I prithee, Dagonet.<br>       <br>      DAGONET. Death himself is the greatest jester. He is the farce that follows      all tragedies. For is it not supremely ridiculous that I myself, about whom      to-day the universe revolves, may to-morrow be reduced to the level of Alexander      or any common dead body?<br>       <br>       MORGAUSE. Do you make yourself greater than Alexander, Fool?<br>       <br>       DAGONET. Ay, or any other corpse, for I am alive and "a dead lion"--But the       worms have eaten that, too. But here come the King and Queen. I was sent to       announce them, but these lofty matters have made me forget my duty. Philosophy       will undo me yet.<br>     </p>

She must be quiet,<br>       Demure--not have her freedom with the boys.<br>       While they are running on the battlements,<br>       Playing at war or at the chase, she sits<br>       Eating her heart out at embroidery frames<br>       Among old dames that chatter of a world<br>       Where women are put up as merchandise.<br>       --Oh, I have slipped away a thousand times<br>       Into the garden close and scaled the wall<br>       And fled from them to freedom and the hills.<br>       And I have passed the women in the fields,<br>       With stupid faces dulled by long constraint,<br>       Bowing their backs beneath the double burden<br>       Of labor and unkindness--all alike,<br>       Princess and peasant, bondslaves, by their sex!<br>       Ah, the gray crags up whose sheer precipices<br>       I have so often toiled, to throw myself<br>       Panting upon their crests at last and lie<br>       For whole long afternoons upon the hard<br>       Delicious rock in that sweet weariness<br>       That follows effort, with a silent joy<br>       In obstacles that I could overcome.<br>       They never called me girl, those mighty peaks!<br>       They knew no sex,--they took me to their hearts<br>       As if I were a boy. Oh, the wild thrill<br>       That tingled in the veins, when the strong winds<br>       Came howling like a pack of hungry wolves<br>       That make the wintry forests terrible<br>       Beneath the Norland moon! "Shriek on," I cried,<br>       "Rave, howl, roar, bellow, till your split your throats!<br>       You cannot mar the pinnacled repose<br>       Of these huge mountain-tops. They are not women!"<br>       Why, what an idle rage is this!

I go to a new life.<br>       I have ordered a new pair of manacles.<br>       Arthur? As well Arthur as another--<br>       I care not. If I must, I must.

I had thought<br>      I should be greeted with felicitations.<br>      They say, a maid upon her wedding morn<br>      Is timorous, fluttered, casts regretful eyes<br>      --Or so she fancies--on her maidenhood,<br>      And yet is glad withal.

Oh, if<br>      When once the fatal ring is on thy finger,<br>      Thou shouldst encounter some one who should kindle<br>      Thy latent heart to flame. To be caressed<br>      When thou art cold--this is a bitter thing.<br>      But to be fondled by an unloved hand,<br>      When all the soul is in another's arms--<br>      That were a horror and a sacrilege.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE.

As for Arthur,<br>      He is a very princely gentleman,<br>      One whom at least I never shall despise.<br>      <br>      PEREDURE.

I think that wine will never be aught but bitter to me again, and      that I shall hate the perfume of flowers and the melody of lutes and mandolins      as long as I live. Oh, my friends, I am but the husk of what I was, and all      that was savory in me is consumed.<br>      <br>                        [<i> Exit</i>       SERVANT <i> with cups, etc</i> .]<br>      <br>      BORS. Thou'st not been thyself since we were presented to the Queen. I mind      me now how thou didst start then and heave thy sides, as if thou'dst seen      a spirit. What--Galahault--is't possible?<br>      <br>      GALAHAULT. O Bors, Bors, Bors, the maids of Camelot<br>      Say rightly that thou hast not loved; for else<br>      His sorrow were no riddle.<br>      <br>      BORS.                                Nay,      to me<br>      A riddle darker with increasing light.<br>      What, is the Lady of the Hills forgot?<br>      Have human hearts no stronger faith?

What ails that I<br>      Should e'er be false to Arthur? Rest you safe,<br>      I have no lady if it be not she<br>      Whom I have called the Lady of the Hills.<br>      <br>      BORS.

Is't possible <br>      That I betray the King?<br>      <br>      BORS.                         What      name was it<br>      You gave the jester that we met below?<br>      <br>      GALAHAULT. What, here? His name is Dagonet. The Queen<br>      Brought him with her from Cameliard.<br>      <br>      BORS.                                               The      Queen?<br>      Dagonet? By heaven it is as clear as noon.<br>      This is the very Fool that saved his life<br>      For he did call him Dagonet that day<br>      He told the story to me.

Nay, thou hast not loved, <br>      Nor dost not know that when Love enters in,<br>      He enters as a master, not a slave.<br>      <br>      GALAHAULT. True, Launcelot, Love is tameless as wild beasts.<br>      Chains for his limbs but leave his spirit more free<br>      To think the thing it may not act. Hunger<br>      Is his best nourishment and he grows apace<br>      Upon starvation. If he die at all,<br>      He dies of surfeit, not of abstinence.<br>      <br>      BORS.

There is no garden like it in the world.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. I did not guess you were so fond of gardens.<br>      I thought of you with lance and battle-axe<br>      In the forefront of war--yet not as one<br>      That kills his fellows with a savage joy--<br>      But with pale brow where anger never writ<br>      His ugly name in frowns.<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT.               You      thought of me?<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. Who does not think of you? Your fame is blown<br>      Further than Cameliard.<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT.             And      you thought of me<br>      As hard and cruel?<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE.      Never for a breath!<br>      And yet I did not think that you would feel<br>      The strange delicious sweet of such a place.<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT. I never felt it as I do to-day,--<br>      Though I remember, when I was a boy,<br>      There was a beautiful lady who would come<br>      Across the lake and take me in her skiff<br>      And tell me wondrous tales, tales which still make<br>      A low confusèd murmur in my brain<br>      Like the vague undertone of many bees.<br>      I called her "fairy mother" then, but now<br>      Men tell me that she was that Nimue,<br>      The Lady of the Lake, whom Merlin loves.<br>      I know not. I remember only how<br>      I leaned my head over the boat's edge, looking<br>      Deep through the water to another sky,<br>      So clear the water was; and, as I leaned,<br>      My soul went swooning down that crystal space,<br>      Down, down forever, till sinking seemed to turn<br>      To rising, with the sky not far away.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. Tell me more of your life. You must have seen<br>      So much in its young course--have done so much.<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT. Nay, little that I can remember. I am<br>      Strangely unable to distinguish one<br>      Good or ill hap out of the blur of things,<br>      Battles and tourneys, one much like the other,<br>      And lost already in the murmurous past.<br>      I feel as if I were just born to-day<br>      With life before me like this summer air,<br>      Hushed, as in waiting for a bird to sing,<br>      Who yet delays, and all is fresh and fair,<br>      And hope stands flushing like a rosy boy<br>      Upon a threshold which he fears to cross.<br>      But what I fear or what I hope, indeed<br>      I hardly know--and yet I hope and fear.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. But surely some recognizable peak<br>      Soars up among the mountains of your deeds<br>      That you can show me.<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT.            Indeed      there is a height<br>      So near me that it shuts out all my life;<br>      But I have not attained it. One event <br>      I well remember, but it was a vision,<br>      Not an achievement. That was when I first <br>      Beheld you.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. Have you seen me, then, before?<br>      And you remember it and I forget?<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT. I should have died of faintness in the hills<br>      If you had not stood by.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE.             What,      were you he<br>      Whom Dagonet the Fool saved?<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT.                               I am he.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. How strangely are the threads of life inwoven!--<br>      Yet since you will not tell me of your deeds,<br>      Tell me at least for whom you do them.<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT.                                       Ah,      me!<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE.

Queen, that I love is true; and love should be<br>      More joy on earth than Michael hath in heaven.<br>      But I have been too much beloved of Fortune;<br>      And she hath dowered me with all goodly gifts<br>      Only in the end to turn them to a gibe.<br>      For all my feats of arms were done for you,<br>      And if you love me not, it had been better<br>      My mother died a maid--and should you love,<br>      Which yet I dare not hope, our lives must be<br>      Like outcast angels, glorious with shade,<br>      A bitter gladness and a radiant woe.<br>      Ay, for 't is you I love. Love leaped to life<br>      Within me when I saw you in the hills,<br>      As Saint John leaped within his mother's womb<br>      When Mary drew near, childing of the Christ.<br>      Speak to me! Will you outstare marble? God!<br>      I say, I love you. See, I crawl to you!--<br>      I pray you pardon me. I see you are<br>      Too merciful to speak.

Then heal that sorrow, madam, for you may.<br>       <br>       GUENEVERE. He asked me nothing.<br>       <br>       GALAHAULT.                     Nor       would ever ask,<br>       Love is so fearful when it is new-born.<br>       But I plead for him. This is what he would,--<br>       That you should love him and retain him ever<br>       To be your knight, and that you should become<br>       His loyal lady for your whole life long.<br>       Grant this and you will make him richer far<br>       Than if you gave the world.<br>       <br>       GUENEVERE.                   I       have given him all<br>       The world I have, the world of my own thoughts,<br>       Desires and aspirations, hopes and fears.<br>       --You see, I trust you, sir. I know not how<br>       You come upon my dream, like a strange shape<br>       That casts a shadow where no shadows are.<br>       But you are here, although you be but thickened<br>       Out of the air before me, as my thoughts<br>       In like wise now round to a definite orb.<br>       I know that he is mine and I all his,<br>       And that you somehow, strangely, have been part<br>       Of things ill done and mended.<br>       <br>       LAUNCELOT.                         No,       I dream.<br>       It is not she that speaks. Dear God, if this<br>       Be but a dream, oh let me die and find <br>       That heaven is just to dream forever thus.<br>       <br>       GALAHAULT. Gramercy. Now 'tis fit you enter on<br>       Love's service. Kiss him once before me, madam,<br>       For the beginning of true love.<br>       <br>       GUENEVERE.                    Those       yonder, sure,<br>       Would marvel much that we should do such deeds.<br>       <br>       GALAHAULT. No one will see. [<i> Turns away</i> .]<br>       <br>       GUENEVERE. And if they did?--Why, Launcelot,<br>       You tremble like a leaf. Will you not kiss me?<br>       Are you afraid? Nay, then I will kiss you.</p>

 <p align="left"> BORRE. Mamma, I like to talk to you about Gawaine.<br>      <br>      LIONORS. Why, darling?<br>      <br>      BORRE.              Because      you hold me close to you,<br>      And kiss me so.<br>      <br>      LIONORS.       My little innocent wisdom!<br>      <br>      BORRE. Gawaine never kisses me. And yet he is kind;<br>      He gives me sweets and--Oh, mamma, look! look!<br>      The moon--how big it is! It comes right up,<br>      Right up out of the mere, just like Gawaine<br>      When he is swimming. You know, he plunges under<br>      And then his head comes up 'way over yonder,<br>      And then he shakes the drops out of his hair<br>      And wipes his eyes with his fingers. The moon is bald<br>      Like poor old Hugh the gardener. That's why <br>      The water doesn't stick to it.<br>      <br>      LIONORS. [<i> kissing him</i> ]. Sweetheart! See<br>      How still the moonlight lies upon the water!<br>      <br>      BORRE. It's like a silver road.<br>      <br>      LIONORS.                            How      would you like<br>      For you and me to go out hand in hand<br>      As we do i' the meadows, and pluck those flowers<br>      That grow on the waves by moonlight, and so go on<br>      And on and on until we came to Fairyland?<br>      <br>      BORRE. I'm 'fraid we'd get our feet wet.<br>      <br>      LIONORS.                             I'm      afraid we might.<br>      <br>      BORRE. But what's a road for, if you mayn't walk on it?<br>      Mamma, I don't think it's a road at all;<br>      It's a river.<br>      <br>      LIONORS.   A river, love?<br>      <br>      BORRE.                             A      river of shine;<br>      The fairies go swimming in 't.</p>

Come, kiss me.<br>      What do you see out there?<br>      <br>      BORRE.                              My      lord, who lives<br>      I' the sea?<br>      <br>      PEREDURE. Why, the fishes, Borre.<br>      <br>      BORRE.                                            And      the old crabs<br>      With their great ugly claws--I know. But I think<br>      A princess lives there in a crystal palace,<br>      All white and cool, with crabs to guard the gates.<br>      That's why their arms are so long, you know--to catch<br>      The robbers with.<br>      <br>      PEREDURE.       Are there robbers in the sea?<br>      <br>      BORRE. Oh, yes! that's such a pretty story. Mamma,<br>      Tell it to him--you know, the one you told<br>      Last night--about the water-kelpies that tried<br>      To steal the princess' treasure.<br>      <br>      LIONORS.                             Some      other time, Sweetheart.<br>      <br>      BORRE. Oh, please, mamma, please tell it!<br>      <br>      LIONORS.                                                Not<br>      To-night, dear. It grows late, and it is time<br>      For little folk to be abed. Come, Borre,<br>      We'll go find nurse.--Excuse me, pray, my lord;<br>      I will return soon.<br>      <br>      BORRE.                    I don't want to go;<br>      I am not sleepy.<br>      <br>      PEREDURE.      Let me carry him.<br>      Wouldn't you like a ride upon my shoulder?<br>      That's it.

If it be true, as you suspect--<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE.                                       No      fear!<br>      You are very wise and subtle, good my lord,<br>      But trust a woman's wit as subtler still<br>      Where woman's heart's at question. You were there;<br>      Your eyes were fixed, as all eyes, on the Queen;<br>      Yet you nor no man there saw what I saw. <br>      I tell you, when a woman's eyes are lit<br>      With such a light as that I saw in hers<br>      The while she gazed at Launcelot, 'tis small matter<br>      Whether she flinch or falter to the world--<br>      She loves.<br>      <br>      PUBLIUS. Well, let us grant, then, that she loves;<br>      You women sometimes prove absurdly right,<br>      And I incline to trust you.

 <p align="center"> SCENE II.--<i> A street in Camelot. Enter</i>  THE <br>      WATCH.</p>    
 <p align="left"> FIRST WATCHMAN. I say it and I say it again, that the King hath      the strongest arm in the kingdom.<br>      <br>      SECOND WATCHMAN. Not a doubt of that!<br>      <br>      THIRD WATCHMAN. Our King be a powerful fighter.<br>      <br>      FOURTH WATCHMAN. Not but I think our Owen, the blacksmith, would run him hard.<br>      <br>      FIRST WATCHMAN. Oh, you think, do you? You're a fine one to think. Owen, the      blacksmith!<br>      <br>      THIRD WATCHMAN. They as thinks, goes to hell; leastwise Father Aurelian says      so.<br>      <br>      FIRST WATCHMAN. Owen, the blacksmith!<br>      <br>      FOURTH WATCHMAN. Well, I suppose a blacksmith may have muscle in his arm,      as well as a king.<br>      <br>      FIRST WATCHMAN. Ah, there you goes a-supposing. The King, sir, is the King,      and is not to be supposed.<br>      <br>      THIRD WATCHMAN. Ay, 'tis a hanging matter to suppose the King--except for      the Pope. The Pope can suppose anything.<br>      <br>      FIRST WATCHMAN. You go too much to the priests, David. Father Aurelian knows      not everything, though I will not deny that he can say mass quicker than any      priest in Camelot. The Pope cannot touch the King except in the way of cursing,      and it's not likely the Holy Father would curse anybody--unless he were mightily      provoked.<br>      <br>      SECOND WATCHMAN. That's true, neighbor.<br>      <br>      FIRST WATCHMAN. The King is the head in things temporary, and the Pope in      things spirituous.<br>      <br>      SECOND WATCHMAN. And that's true, too.<br>      <br>      FIRST WATCHMAN. And I say again, the King is the strongest man in the kingdom.      Before he was crowned, the pulled the great sword out o' the stone at Canterbury,      where it was fast stuck, so that all the nobles in Britain had tugged away      at it and none o' them so much as budged it. And they say the devil put it      there, but that is not likely, for the Archbishop said that whoever should      pull it out should be king, and it's not to be be believed that the Archbishop      would meddle with the devil. Well, at last the King came, but he was not King      then, but no matter for that; and he heaved away at it and out it came so      sudden that away went His Majesty heels over head backward and was near to      break 's neck. And they call the place Arthur's Feat to this day, because      there Arthur lost his feet. And I say, the King is the strongest man in Britain.<br>      <br>      THIRD WATCHMAN. But that was a magic sword; it vanished afterward.<br>      <br>      FIRST WATCHMAN. Magic! Poh, David, you'll believe anything.<br>      <br>      THIRD WATCHMAN. If it did not vanish, where is it now? Answer me that.<br>      <br>      FIRST WATCHMAN. Masters, we are set here to apprehend benefactors. But I take      it that no benefactors will be in the street at this hour, for there is a      law that no one be abroad after nine o' the clock but the King's watch. Let      us go into Master Howell's tavern. If there be any benefactors they will be      there. <br>      <br>      FOURTH WATCHMAN. Ay, we'll go have a pot of ale. But we must come back anon,      for there might be honest men abroad.<br>      <br>      FIRST WATCHMAN. Truly, and if any honest men be stirring, they will take it      ill that the watch be not by to protect them.<br>      <br>      THIRD WATCHMAN. But 'tis against the law to be out at this time o' the night;      and can a man be a true man and break the law?<br>      <br>      FIRST WATCHMAN. In a case of necessity he may, for necessity knows no law.      And I feel myself a pressing necessity now for strong waters. Come, masters.                                                                                                                           [<i> Exeunt</i> .]</p>

Now who'd a-thought 't 't would a-been your Highness? Ah,      your Highness knows what's what, a-going about in the night, when all honest      folk is a-bed. But it's not for me to say when your Highness should go in      or come out. And I hope your Highness will not forget the watch.<br>      <br>      GALAHAULT [<i> throwing purse</i> ].

He knows what belongs to a gentleman. And      did you hear what he called me? An oracle. That's as much as to say, a man      of parts. Mark Antony was an oracle-he that killed Cæsar in the play. He killed      him oracularly.<br>      <br>      FOURTH WATCHMAN. Not a one of you had come back but for me.

 <p align="left"> MERLIN. Burn, burn, ye leaping flames! And yet in vain.<br>      Ye cannot burn away the prison-bars<br>      That gaol my soul from knowledge. Yet burn on;<br>      A little and a little still I learn.<br>      Yet all the knowledge man can win avails<br>      But to avoid the shock of mighty forces<br>      Which he can neither deviate nor control.<br>      I look out on the rushing of the world<br>      As one who sees the gloom of swirling waters<br>      In the abyss of midnight. On they sweep,<br>      Fatal, resistless, plunging as one mass<br>      From turbulence to booming turbulence.<br>      Whence? Whither? Ye occult unconscious Powers!<br>      How shall I call upon you? By what names?<br>      What incantations?-Fool, what do you here?<br>      <br>      DAGONET. Father Merlin, when will the devils appear?<br>      <br>      MERLIN. What mean you, Fool?<br>      <br>      DAGONET. Were you not conjuring? I cry you mercy, I thought it was an invocation      to Flibbertigibbet. Sir Kaye says that Asmodeus was your father, but the Devil      himself will be saved ere his wits stop leaking.<br>      <br>      MERLIN. I do not take that. How should his wits leak?<br>      <br>      DAGONET. Marry, I am sure his brain's cracked. He put me in the pillory the      other day for making a jest that passed his understanding, but he will be      pilloried with my jest long after I have ceased jesting with his pillory.<br>      <br>      MERLIN. What, were you in the pillory, Dagonet?<br>      <br>      DAGONET. Long enough to feel an imaginary ruff about my neck still. But by      the intercession of the Queen, I was delivered. I hope her issue may be nobler.<br>      <br>      MERLIN. Her issue? Where is the sequence in this?<br>      <br>      DAGONET. That if her issue be no nobler than mine, it will be something scrofulous,      for I was delivered of a galled neck. Father Merlin, can you undo a spell      as well as contrive one?<br>      <br>      MERLIN. Why, Fool?<br>      <br>      DAGONET. The Prince of Cameliard is bewitched; he does nothing but sigh.<br>      <br>      MERLIN. Why, you should be the physician to heal him of that ailment. For      what purpose else does the King keep you?<br>      <br>      DAGONET. Nay, the jester is a physician that heals none but the well. The      sick will have none of him, neither the sick in body nor in wit nor in heart;      for the sick in their bodies desire the sympathy of long faces; and the sick      in their wits think they are mocked, because they do not understand what is      said; and the sick in their hearts speak another language-laughter is bitterness      to them and their recreation is in groans. And Prince Peredure is in the third      of these categories,--he is in love. Indeed, Father Merlin, he is past my      medicining, and I would you would cure him.<br>      <br>      MERLIN. Would you have me cure youth of love? <br>      Then I were a magician indeed.<br>      And yet I know, in part, of what you speak;<br>      And I would counsel you, good Dagonet,<br>      To have an eye upon the Queen of Orkney.<br>      She works with devious indirections, and<br>      This love of Peredure may be to her <br>      A point to rest the lever on, wherewith<br>      She pries at greater matters. Come with me;<br>      I have employment for you. 'T works so, does't?<br>      Fate lays on her a bitter-hearted life;<br>      Even as long ago I prophesied<br>      That woe should whelm her past all woman's woe,<br>      And woe past woman's from her heart should flow<br>      To whelm the world-and Time unwinds it so.<br>      <br>                                                                             [<i> Exeunt</i> .]</p>

Let them have time<br>      To talk and tell old stories in their tents<br>      And they'll forget their hardships, and each soldier<br>      Will presently begin to find himself<br>      Of moment to the State, no mere machine<br>      Useful and used as bows and catapults,<br>      But personal; and Britain thus will grow<br>      A thing wherein he hath a stake himself,<br>      And he will fight the better and submit<br>      More willing to her rule in that his will<br>      By head and heart alike is reinforced.<br>      Have couriers been sent forward?</p>

 <p align="left"> GODMAR.                                                                                               One      at dawn<br>      And one when we encamped.<br>      <br>      ARTHUR.                            How      camest thou here?<br>      <br>      MERLIN. On no enchanted steed; a plain mule brought me.<br>      I set out when your messenger arrived<br>      This morning. I have tidings you must hear<br>      Before your entry.<br>      <br>      ARTHUR.            Well.<br>      <br>      MERLIN.                      The      Emperor<br>      Has sent a special envoy to your court,<br>      Whose undivulged commission, though with care<br>      And shrewdly hid, I have smelled out. In brief,<br>      Rome sends to bully you with warlike threats<br>      To pay the tribute.<br>      <br>      ARTHUR.             You      are my counsellors;<br>      What are your minds on this?<br>      <br>      GODMAR.                          I      am for war. <br>      Here is occasion for new victories <br>      And a world-wider glory. For my part,<br>      I think that peace is when the nation sleeps<br>      And when it wakes, that's war. For men in peace,<br>      Lacking brave emulation and the zeal<br>      Of a great cause, fall to their petty ends<br>      And, letting their high virtues atrophy,<br>      Wallow in lust and avarice, till the heart<br>      And nobler functions rot away and leave<br>      A people like an oyster, all stomach.<br>      Our men are bold with long success, valiant,<br>      Well-disciplined, far better warriors<br>      Than Roman libertines, and mercenaries<br>      That fight with half their hearts. The cause is just;<br>      For while Rome kept her legions in the land,<br>      Defending us from the sea-robbing Jutes<br>      And Saxons and against the mountain hordes<br>      Of barbarous Picts, there was a show of reason<br>      Why she should tax us; now we stand alone<br>      And ask and yield no favors.<br>      <br>      MERLIN.                                 Nor      would I<br>      Advise your Majesty to yield an inch<br>      To this preposterous impudence. And yet<br>      Delay advantages the crescent power,<br>      And we are growing stronger every year<br>      And Rome declining. If we match her now,<br>      Ere long we'll have the odds. Her boundless wealth<br>      Gives her resources which our general<br>      Too lightly weighs. Nor should we overrate<br>      Our own security. We are one in rule<br>      But not in spirit yet, and local feeling<br>      Still outruns national. The Jutes in Kent<br>      Are yet a daily threat. Therefore, my liege,<br>      My counsel is that we meet words with words,<br>      Gain time to expel the aliens from our shores<br>      And discord from our hearts. Indeed I think<br>      The glory of your reign will more consist<br>      In leaving to the world a living State<br>      Than in your victories. And what most imports you<br>      Is to secure by wise executive<br>      The unity and welfare of the realm.<br>      <br>      ARTHUR. You have each spoken well, but I incline<br>      To Godmar's thought. You, Merlin, know full well<br>      The unity of Britain is the heart<br>      And purpose of my life; but I conceive <br>      This war will make the country more at one<br>      Than all our statecraft, for old enmities<br>      Will melt away into one common heart<br>      When Britons fight against a common foe.<br>      Besides, you shall yourself be deputy <br>      At Camelot, and our home management<br>      Shall be no loser. For the Jutes in Kent,<br>      We'll make them our allies, confirm their lands<br>      In fealty to ourself and win them over<br>      With promises o' the richer spoils of Rome.<br>      For I intend to sack her opulent towns<br>      And pay my soldiers from their treasuries;<br>      And this sea-people will supply me ships<br>      And sailors cunning in sea-faring war.<br>      And, more than this, I have ancestral claims<br>      To the imperial crown. We'll not return<br>      Until the Pope has crowned me Emperor.<br>      <br>      GODMAR. No man on earth save Arthur, King of Britain,<br>      Could wield so glorious an enterprise.<br>      <br>      ARTHUR. What say you, Merlin?<br>      <br>      MERLIN.                                       'T      is a noble plan,<br>      Better than mine though something hazardous,<br>      And for a lesser captain foolhardy.<br>      And yet it has a weakness, for I fear<br>      The greatening power and riches of the Jutes.<br>      If Britain ever fall, 't will be by them.<br>      <br>      ARTHUR. They are too dangerous to be enemies;<br>      They must be friends.<br>      <br>      MERLIN.                 My      liege, a word with you in private.<br>      <br>      GODMAR. Sire, permit that I withdraw. [<i> Exit</i> .]<br>      <br>      ARTHUR. What bitter news now, Merlin?<br>      <br>      MERLIN.                                              Be      prepared<br>      For any unexpected blow you will.<br>      I fear your sister has some plot in hand<br>      Which I have not unravelled.<br>      <br>      ARTHUR.                           Morgause      again?<br>      I have a senseless superstitious dread<br>      That from her comes my ruin;--but that's a dream.<br>      I'll not be goblin-ridden. Come within<br>      The tent and tell me more of your suspicion.<br>      <br>                                                                         [<i> Exeunt</i> .]</p>

 <p align="center">  </p>    
 <p align="left"> MORGAUSE. Well?<br>      <br>      LADINAS.                I      have seen them.<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE.                    Seen      them?<br>      <br>      LADINAS.                                From      the arbor<br>      I watched them as they strolled; yet too far off<br>      To hear their words-and yet their words were sweet.<br>      I could tell that although I heard them not,<br>      They leaned so to each other, like a pair<br>      Of rutting deer that rub their heads together<br>      Before they couple. What they said, no doubt,<br>      Had made a pretty song for the King's ear,<br>      Could it have been re-worded.<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE.                          Was      this all you saw?<br>      <br>      LADINAS. Be patient. I have not done yet.<br>      I saw them kiss-and Launcelot looked about<br>      With guilty fear, but Guenevere looked not<br>      But hung upon him motionless and dumb,<br>      Reckless of all the world. Much more I saw,<br>      But to be brief-at last, after what words <br>      I know not, they departed, she with head<br>      Erect, poised firmly on her royal throat,<br>      But he with wild eyes and a haggard face.<br>      I followed them. They went in by the wicket<br>      O' the private stairway of the Queen's apartments.<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE. What say you? In broad noon?<br>      <br>      LADINAS.                               Ay,      in broad noon.<br>      At least, she sins with royal carelessness.<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE. Her royal carelessness! Her royal throat!<br>      Is she the only queen, then, in the world?<br>      Doth she bewitch you, too? Where got she drugs<br>      To make men love her? Do you find her fairer?<br>      Beware, La Rouse! You know how I can hate.<br>      <br>      LADINAS. Fairer? There are three fair ladies in the world,<br>      Iseult of Ireland, Guenevere, and thou-<br>      And thou art first among them. I will not <br>      Deny how beautiful she is, my queen-<br>      Thou art the fairer that she is so fair.<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE. Leave courtly phrases till another time.<br>      What did you when her royalty had passed<br>      Into the palace?<br>      <br>      LADINAS.        I bethought me then<br>      Of Peredure's apartments and the key.<br>      I had no thought to find an use so soon<br>      For that-love-trinket. I ensconced myself<br>      Behind a pillar in the gallery<br>      That overlooks the window of the Queen,--<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE. And there you saw--?<br>      <br>      LADINAS.         Enough! Not all I      would,--<br>      There was a tantalizing incompleteness<br>      In what I saw; something, indeed, as when<br>      One thinks one sees more than one really does<br>      When the wind frolics with the petticoats.<br>      And yet I saw enough to make the Queen<br>      A laughter and a byword to the world.<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE. Ha, ha, ha!<br>      So then my virtuous brother will receive<br>      A douse of dirty water for a welcome,<br>      When he returns to-morrow morn. The pomp<br>      Of his victorious arms will only serve<br>      To pageant out his shame.<br>      <br>      LADINAS.                           I      have set down<br>      A formal notice with the Seneschal<br>      That at high noon to-morrow, when the King<br>      Ascends the throne in the Great Hall to hear<br>      The grievances and quarrels of his knights <br>      And render justice, I shall then appear<br>      And in the presence of the court "impeach<br>      Guenevere, Queen of Britain, Sovran Lady <br>      Of the Most Knightly and Christian Fellowship<br>      Of the Round Table, <i> et cetera</i> , of treason<br>      To the most gracious person of the King<br>      And to the safety of the realm, in living<br>      In shameless license with Sir Launcelot;<br>      And also I impeach for the same cause<br>      Sir Launcelot du Lac, the son of Ban-"<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE. Spare me the legal rigmarole. By this,<br>      The noise is bruited over the whole palace.<br>      <br>      LADINAS. Be sure of that; Sir Kaye will never keep<br>      So rare a bit of scandal to himself.<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE. Why, then we have won the throw. Oh, Ladinas,<br>      You have done that to-day that shall shake thrones!<br>      Launcelot will not tamely yield himself;<br>      Still less will he sit by and see his leman<br>      Dragged from him to the stake. This work of ours<br>      Casts Britain to the pit for the beasts of war<br>      To glut their bloodthirst on.-What's that to us?<br>      This upstart Queen and that false-hearted prig<br>      Who calls himself her husband and my brother-<br>      She lied, my mother, when she said she bore him!<br>      And, if he be her husband, what proves that<br>      But that he is a perjurer?-If she 'scape,<br>      He may be slain; and if they live, the shame<br>      Will daub them till they die. In any case<br>      I have revenge. I could carouse to-night<br>      Till the elves startled in the glens to hear<br>      The echo of my revelry. Come, kiss me!<br>      Oh, Ladinas, I am drunk with merriment.<br>      Again! again! My blood is flames of fire.<br>      <br>      LADINAS. Your lips burn and your cheeks are hot. Morgause!<br>      My pantheress! My splendid devil!</p>

I am<br>      Too gray for envy and too well aware<br>      Of what you do for this play of concealment.<br>      And other things I know; be warned in time,--<br>      Let your intents take wing.<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE.                  You      are too late.<br>      Go to Sir Kaye and ask the news of him.<br>      I do not fear you, Merlin.<br>      <br>      MERLIN.                        Fear      you God?<br>      <br>      MORGAUSE.

I am so glad I am a woman, love.<br>      I have quarrelled with my sex; but now I see<br>      The heart is keener to recoil from wrong <br>      Than to divine the right, for all my life <br>      Was thwarted but I guessed not why. But now<br>      I would not be a man for all the world.<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT. Nay, I must pity you that you are a woman, for so you miss life's      greatest gift-the joy of loving one.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. I would love the woman's way. It is great to be a man, but it is      delicious to be a woman.</p>

 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. Look yonder! How like a visioned memory<br>      Old Merlin glides among the trees.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE.                               He      comes<br>      This way; I will accost him. Merlin, ho,<br>      What have you there?<br>      <br>      MERLIN.                   An      instrument to measure<br>      The motions of the stars.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE.               Then      have you been<br>      In converse with them of the weirds of men;<br>      For you are Destiny's familiar.<br>      <br>      MERLIN.                                   As<br>      The child is of its mother, who unfolds<br>      What shreds of wisdom it may comprehend.<br>      Yon skies, that look so mild, are threatening;<br>      Some evil passes in the dark but what<br>      Its name or form the stars will not declare<br>      Till it unclose its formidable jaws<br>      And fire-like eat its prey and then itself.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. How wisely they look down from their high heaven,<br>      Meeting our baffled eyes with that clear sight<br>      Which no enigmas barrier!

Let all be unforeseen<br>      And then we shall not suffer till our time.<br>      <br>      LAUNCELOT. Speak not so sadly. I seem to have just found out<br>      That human suffering is but a cheap price<br>      We pay for heavenly bliss. Think rather, then, of joy-<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE. The greatest joy is greater still,<br>      When it comes sharp and sudden.--What was that?<br>      <br>      MERLIN. Why, I heard nothing.<br>      <br>      GUENEVERE.    Nothing? And you, my lord?</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. Nothing. [<i> The light in the window is extinguished</i> .]</p>

 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE.                           What      tale?</p>    
 <p align="left"> GALAHAULT. Then you must hear 't from me. Sir Ladinas<br>      Has made a formal accusation, touching <br>      The friendship you have shown for Launcelot,<br>      Which he misconstrues for a lawless love,<br>      Disloyal to the King.</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT.         The      dream is done--<br>      So suddenly--</p>

 <p align="left"> GALAHAULT. I have drained my cup, and now I drink the air. There      is nothing left for me but the ideas of things. What is all this in search      of?</p>

Sir, I grow old and I need younger men<br>      To hold my hands up, like the Hebrew statesman.<br>      You are a man fit for diplomacy<br>      And I would have you for co-laborer<br>      In the affairs of state; but chiefly now<br>      I would have you assist me to undo <br>      This plot against the Queen. Guilty or guiltless,<br>      The credence of her guilt would rend asunder<br>      Our scarce yet welded kingdom.</p>

 <p align="left"> MERLIN.                     So      with me as well<br>      The personal wish chimes with the general good.<br>      For Launcelot, as you know, was in some sort<br>      My foster-son; the Lady of the Lake<br>      Guided his first dream-thinking and myself<br>      Taught his quick-summered youth.--Go, then, about<br>      Among the lords and ladies of the court<br>      And everywhere proclaim her innocence.<br>      Opinion propagates itself; your stout<br>      Maintenance of her honor will convince<br>      Many by its mere confidence and make<br>      A party in her favor. In two hours<br>      Meet me in the laboratory in the tower.</p>    
 <p align="left"> GALAHAULT. Wisely devised; I'll set about it straight.</p>

 <p align="left"> Good morrow to your majesty.</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE.                          Sir      Bors,<br>      You are my friend, I think; you are Launcelot's kinsman;<br>      You know--the world knows--all but Arthur know,<br>      Who comes with an unsuited holiday,<br>      What hangs above our heads. That we are guiltless<br>      Does not secure us from a guilty doom.<br>      We have need now of friends. Our dandies here<br>      Give me scant courtesy. I will not think<br>      That you too hold me cheaply or mistrust<br>      The faultless knighthood of Sir Launcelot.</p>    
 <p align="left"> BORS. I know that Launcelot loves you--with such love<br>      As a true knight may offer when his lady<br>      Is wedded to another. And I would,<br>      In frankness, lady, you had been his bride.<br>      You had been none the less a queen; his father<br>      Was King of Benwick and his father's brother,<br>      My father, Bors, the King of Gaul. We both<br>      Are of as royal blood as Arthur is <br>      And might be kings, but that we love the King.<br>      For him we have resigned our ancient thrones,<br>      Content to be his liegemen, simple knights<br>      Of that Round Table which is the great sign<br>      Of brotherhood and true equality,<br>      Such is the love we bear him; but if he<br>      Should do dishonor to Sir Launcelot<br>      Or thee, whose knight Sir Launcelot is sworn,<br>      Let him take heed. We may resume our crowns.</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. I thank you, sir. You are a noble friend.<br>      Sir Ector de Maris will be with us,<br>      Pelleas, Lionel, and Bleoberis--</p>

There is great devotion<br>      Among them to my brother, and my brother<br>      Loves me as his own soul. He will not fail--</p>    
 <p align="left"> BORS. Alas, my lady, then you have not heard!</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. Heard? What? Has aught--?</p>    
 <p align="left"> BORS.                     Oh,      steel yourself, my Queen,<br>      For I must be the advertisement of woe.<br>      Peredure--</p>

 <p align="left"> BORS. He is dead.</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE.       Dead? my brother--dead!</p>    
 <p align="left"> BORS.                                                          Alas,<br>      It is so--dead, and slain by his own hand.</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. Grief loves to shoot twice at the selfsame mark,--<br>      Ah, like a skilful archer whose first shaft<br>      Hath pierced the centre, sends a second after,<br>      That with unerring niceness splits the first.<br>      Where did he this?</p>    
 <p align="left"> BORS.                  There      were two witnesses,<br>      Merlin and Dagonet. Let him tell the rest.</p>    
 <p align="left"> DAGONET. It happened on this wise, my lady. Your brother was      enamoured of the Queen of Orkney,--but in honorable fashion, for he fancied      her to be as spotless as a Glastonbury nun. And with this he was fallen into      such a melancholy that I feared he would lose his wits. I loved your brother      and in my folly I sought to deliver him. I knew what a false jade was the      theme of his idolatry and, indeed, that she was this six months coddling with      that fine-feathered incontinent French magpie, Sir Ladinas de la Rouse. So      I lay in watch for the couple, thinking that the truth, though a vile-tasting      medicine, would cure him; and yesternight, finding the two together, I brought      Peredure word.</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. You did well, Dagonet; for 'tis far better<br>      To know and suffer than to be deceived<br>      And dote on loathsomeness. I knew myself<br>      Of this infatuation of my brother,<br>      Yet in the thick and tumult of my sorrows<br>      I took no heed of his. You have done well;<br>      No knight of the Round Table sheathes within<br>      His corselet a more true-steeled heart than you<br>      Cloak with your motley.</p>    
 <p align="left"> DAGONET.                  I      thank you for that speech.<br>      I did not this, forgetful of my Queen.<br>      When first I came on Ladinas and Morgause,<br>      Their talk was all of you,--how he had used <br>      A key that she had begged from Peredure,<br>      To gain an entrance to the prince's rooms,<br>      From whence he said, he had seen--</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE.                              I      shall not fail<br>      To recognize this service at its worth.--<br>      Go on! When you told this to Peredure?</p>    
 <p align="left"> DAGONET. Then he was like a man that puts his feet<br>      On ice whose wintry firmness has grown rotten<br>      With the April in the air, and when he thinks<br>      All steadfast, feels it sink from under him.<br>      Away he starts, wild as the tameless horse<br>      Of Tartary, and comes to where they lie.<br>      When I, less swift of foot, came up with him,<br>      I found him standing dumb, with bloody sword,<br>      Over the twitching corpse of that false knight,<br>      His senseless eyes fixed on Morgause, who cowered <br>      Behind the curtains, silent for dismay.<br>      Me she saw not, for ere I crossed the sill,<br>      He threw the hot sword at her feet and fled,<br>      Crying, "She is too fair, she is too fair!"</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. Oh, better were it if his righteous heel<br>      Had stamped that viper out o' the world. Go on!</p>    
 <p align="left"> DAGONET. There is no more to tell. I followed him,<br>      But ere I reached the gardens, he was dead.<br>      I found him lying pallid in the moonlight<br>      And ancient Merlin bending over him.</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. He was too delicate to face the blasts<br>      Of this world's winter. He was all compassion,<br>      All gentleness, all love, all tender heart,<br>      So sensitive of thought that he could scarce<br>      Endure the passing of an aimless sigh,<br>      So frail of spirit that the silent days<br>      Were in themselves too burdensome a load.<br>      So,--let him rest. The jarring of the world<br>      Frets his fine ear no longer.--Gentlemen,<br>      Pray, leave me. I would think of him alone.</p>

Shall I uncage the captive wolves<br>      Of war, to harry the whole land and rend<br>      The offenceless kern, to give my sorrow ease?<br>      It must not be.

 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE.                      Whence      come you?</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT.                Speakest      thou so coldly?<br>      I passed Sir Bors without and Dagonet;<br>      They sent me hither, saying I should find<br>      The Queen here. So, indeed, I do and not<br>      The woman, not the eyes that met my eyes<br>      With proud confession, not the lips that spoke<br>      Quivering but dauntless, saying, "I love thee, Launcelot."<br>      O Guenevere, hast thou forgot so soon<br>      That thou canst speak with this mechanic voice<br>      And look on me so vacantly?</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE.                       Forgot?<br>      I never shall forget.</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT.       Then thou repentest.<br>      Ay, now I see the longing in thy face<br>      That thou hadst ne'er beheld me. Be it so.<br>      I was a selfish monster when I thrust<br>      My love into the forecourt of thy life. ...<br>      And yet--you loved me once. And oh, those hours<br>      When I could feel the warm breath from your lips<br>      Creep o'er my cheek and mingle with my hair!<br>      The sweet long hours whose lingering moments dripped<br>      Like rhythmic water-drops into a pool<br>      With silver parsimony of sweet sound<br>      As if Time grudged each globule! Why, now I see<br>      Tears in your eyes.</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE.      O Launcelot, my king!</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. My own true wife!</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE.               Do      not call back that time<br>      With any farewell cadence in your voice!<br>      And oh, do not reproach yourself, my god,<br>      For opening to me those golden doors!<br>      We lived then.</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT.   There is honey on your lips<br>      As on the Theban child's. I am the bees<br>      That gather it--so.</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE.     Launcelot!--No, no!<br>      I had forgot. Am I, then, like the rest?<br>      Is there so much o' the woman in my veins<br>      That resolution, buttressed in with vows,<br>      Cannot endure the first assault of love?<br>      We have had a radiant dream; we have beheld<br>      The trellises and temples of the south<br>      And wandered in the vineyards of the sun:--<br>      'T is morning now; the vision fades away,<br>      And we must face the barren norland hills.</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. And must this be?</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE.                      Nay,      Launcelot, it is.<br>      How shall we stand alone against the world?</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. More lonely in it than against it!<br>      What's the world to us?</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. The place in which we live.<br>      We cannot slip it from us like a garment,<br>      For it is like the air--if we should flee<br>      To the remotest steppes of Tartary,<br>      Arabia or the sources of the Nile,<br>      Or that dim region lying in the west,<br>      Where Brandan's holy ships found anchorage,<br>      It still is there, nor can it be eluded<br>      Save in the airless emptiness of death.</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. Say rather, like the miasmatic breath<br>      Of swamps that swarm to rankness. In the clear<br>      And unpolluted air of mountain-tops<br>      Freedom and solitude companion. Oh,<br>      Let the dense earth bring forth its venomous growths!<br>      It cannot harm us on the heights.</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE.                           We      must not<br>      Attempt the ascent. The perils are too great<br>      That ward the way.</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. What reck I of the perils<br>      Between me and the graal of my desires?</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. To plunge the land in war! To rend the kingdom!</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. You are worth all the kingdoms in the world.</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. To drag our friends down with us in our fall!</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. We shall not fall. And what is friendship worth<br>      That will not face adversity for us?</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. We rend the holiest bond, the family.</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. We but destroy the false, build up the true.</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. --Think of your childhood's home, your father's hearth,<br>      Helen, your mother, at her household cares,<br>      The sacred bond from which your life began,<br>      Within whose circle boyhood grew to youth--<br>      Knit by the gentle hand of ageless custom<br>      And consecrate with immemorial rites.</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. I think of this; I, too, would have a home.</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. You have the world; the family alone<br>      Is woman's, it alone is her protection,<br>      Her mission and her opportunity.<br>      In it alone she lives, and she defends it,<br>      Even when its knife is in her heart.</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT.                            And      I--<br>      I, too, defend it, when it <i> is</i>  a family,<br>      As I would kneel before the sacred Host<br>      When through the still aisles sounds the sacring-bell.<br>      But if a jester strutted through the forms<br>      And turned the holy Mass into a mock,<br>      Would I still kneel, or would I rise in anger<br>      And make an end of that foul mimicry?</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. Believest thou, then, the power of the Church?<br>      The Church would give our love an ugly name.</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. Faith, I believe and I do not believe.<br>      The shocks of life oft startle us to thought,<br>      Rouse us from acquiescence and reveal<br>      That what we took for credence was but custom.<br>      Though the priests <i> be</i>  the channels of God's grace,<br>      Yet otherwise they are but men; they err<br>      As others, may mistake for falsehood truth,<br>      And holiness for sin.--God help me, sweet,<br>      I cannot reason it--I only know<br>      I love you.</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. You are Arthur's friend. Your love--<br>      Stands this within the honor of your friendship?</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. Mother of God!--Have you no pity?</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. I would I could be pitiful and yet do right.<br>      Alas, how heavy--your tears move me more<br>      Than all--(What am I saying?

Let me not lie<br>      To you, of all--My whole life is a lie.<br>      To one, at least, let it be truth.

The great world<br>      Should have one Lord, as Britain has at last;<br>      There lies the true goal of all polity.<br>      But we, at least, are one; nor only Britain<br>      But many parts of France accept our sway.<br>      'T is fit, at such a joyous consummation,<br>      Wrought with such toil of statecraft and of arms,<br>      To deck our city like a Queen of May<br>      With many-colored flags and summer garlands,<br>      And make the midnight sky to mock the dawn<br>      With the red gleam of bonfires on the hills.</p>

 <p align="left"> KAYE. First, dread my lord, the ambassadors from Rome.</p>    
 <p align="left"> ARTHUR. Let them appear.</p>    
 <p align="left"> [<i> Flourish. Enter </i> PUBLIUS <i> and nine other </i> AMBAS-<br>               SADORS, <i> old men,      bearing each a branch of<br>               olive. They kneel before      the throne.</i> ]</p>    
 <p align="left"> PUBLIUS.                            First      for ourselves we do<br>      This reverence to your Majesty, entreating<br>      Lest we lose favor in your eyes, in that<br>      We do a graceless office. We are but cogs<br>      In the machinery of imperial Rome<br>      And work our master's will.</p>    
 <p align="left"> ARTHUR.                           Rise,      gentlemen,<br>      And let the throne of Britain know your message.</p>    
 <p align="left"> PUBLIUS. [<i> reads</i> ]. "Lucius, the high and mighty Emperor,<br>      Sendeth to Arthur, King of Britain, greeting,<br>      Commanding thee that thou acknowledge him<br>      Thy lord, and that thou send the truage due<br>      Unto the Empire, which thy father paid<br>      And other heretofore thy predecessors,<br>      As is of record. Thou, as a false rebel,<br>      Not knowing him to be thy sovereign,<br>      Withholdest and retainest this just impost,<br>      Contrary to the statutes and decrees,<br>      Made by the noble and worthy Julius Cæsar,<br>      Conqueror of this realm and of the world,<br>      First Emperor of Rome. If thou refuse,<br>      Know thou for certain he shall make strong war<br>      On thee, thy realms and lands, and shall chastise<br>      Thee and thy subjects, making an ensample<br>      Perpetual unto all kings and princes<br>      Not to rebel against that noble empire<br>      Which domineth the universal world."</p>    
 <p align="left"> A YOUNG KNIGHT. Gentlemen, shall this gray-beard insolence<br>      Scoff in our teeth?</p>    
 <p align="left">            [<i> Several      of the younger knights draw their <br>                         swords.</i> ]</p>    
 <p align="left"> ARTHUR. Put up your swords. He dies,<br>      Who touches these old men except with reverence.<br>      Fie, would ye strike the herald in his office<br>      Or run upon unweaponed age?--Go, tell<br>      Your lord, there was a king of Britain once<br>      Who sacked great Rome itself, despite the geese<br>      Cackled to save it. As for this demand,<br>      I know no tribute that I owe to him,<br>      Nor to no earthly prince, Christian nor heathen.<br>      Say furthermore that I myself pretend<br>      In virtue of my lineal descent<br>      From that great Constantine who saw the Cross<br>      Blazoned upon the sky for his device,<br>      And conquered in that sign, who was himself<br>      A Briton, son of Helena, our Queen,<br>      And sprung from immemorial royalty--<br>      From him, I say, I trace my high descent,<br>      From him I hold the sovereignty of Britain<br>      And from him, too, the Iron Crown of Rome.<br>      And I proclaim that Lucius wears that crown<br>      As an usurper and a rebel, and<br>      Demand that he and all that are of Rome<br>      Hasten incontinent to do me homage<br>      As their true Emperor, on pain of all<br>      That shall ensue. For, rest you well assured,<br>      If I invade Italia with my chivalry,<br>      The legioned arms of Rome shall stead you little.<br>      This is my answer. But do not for this<br>      Yourselves be too impetuous of return.<br>      Abide some days in Camelot, my lords;<br>      We shall afford you merry entertainment.</p>    
 <p align="left"> PUBLIUS. Your declaration puts the world at war;<br>      We may not dally in a hostile court.</p>    
 <p align="left">                                           [<i> Exit,      with</i>  AMBASSADORS.]</p>    
 <p align="left"> KAYE [<i> apart</i> ]. My lord, I would have warned you of the      next;<br>      But I could get no audience in the press.<br>      [<i> Aloud, reading</i> .] "Sir Ladinas de la Rouse, a lord of France,<br>      And Knight of the Round Table, doth impeach<br>      Guenevere, Queen of Britain, Sovran Lady<br>      Of the most Knightly and Christian Fellowship<br>      Of the Round Table, <i> et cetera</i> , of treason<br>      To the most gracious person of the King<br>      And to the safety of the realm, in living<br>      In shameless license with Sir Launcelot.<br>      Also he doth impeach for the same cause<br>      Sir Launcelot du Lac, the son of Ban,<br>      Lord of the land of Benwick and the castle<br>      Of Joyous Gard. This charge he undertakes<br>      To prove by evidence irrefragable,<br>      Or else to meet Sir Launcelot in the lists<br>      And whatsoever Knight beside appear<br>      To champion the quarrel of the Queen.<br>      In pledge whereof he offers to the King<br>      The disposition of his life and lands."</p>    
 <p align="left">                                                        [<i> Profound      silence</i> .]</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. This is a grievous charge to make. But why<br>      Comes not the knight according to his bond,<br>      That I may prove his lie upon his head?</p>    
 <p align="left"> MORGAUSE. Because he has been treacherously murdered--<br>      Therefore he comes not, thou dishonored knight!</p>    
 <p align="left"> KAYE. Murdered?</p>    
 <p align="left"> MORGAUSE. Ay, murdered--by Prince Peredure,<br>      The brother of the Queen! A strange concurrence!</p>    
 <p align="left"> MERLIN. How comes it, lady, that you know so much?<br>      Did Dagonet tell you or Sir Bors? They only,<br>      Except myself, have known of this. Be careful;<br>      With too much knowledge you undo yourself.</p>    
 <p align="left"> ARTHUR. Enough! 'T is well, perhaps, that he is dead;<br>      Else this preposterous charge might not be passed<br>      Unquestioned and unpunished.--Is aught else--?</p>    
 <p align="left"> MORGAUSE. Oh, not so fast, my royal brother! La Rouse<br>      Cannot break through his coffin to sustain<br>      His righteous accusation; but I take<br>      That burden on myself. I shall demand<br>      Bors de Ganys, the Lady Lionors<br>      --You should believe her, she was never false <br>      To you--Prince Galahault, who knows full well<br>      What he is loth to answer, Lynette, Laurel,<br>      Dagonet, some others after, to bear witness.<br>      It is the common rumor of the palace.<br>      You cannot honorably, with that respect<br>      You owe the knights and ladies of your court,<br>      Allow yourself so shamelessly to be <br>      Misused and made a jest of. I myself<br>      Have seen Sir Launcelot and the Queen together<br>      When they conceited they were unperceived.<br>      It was but now I--</p>    
 <p align="left"> ARTHUR.             Silence!      One word more<br>      And, royal and our sister though you be,<br>      Your womanhood shall be your shield no longer.<br>      Too much already have we suffered you<br>      To play the spy and weave your deft intrigues<br>      About our footing. Now our slackness ends.<br>      We banish you the court. Go, get you ready!<br>      Sir Kaye will see that, ere the sun is set,<br>      You are far hence in some sequestered castle,<br>      Where you shall have all honor, ceremony,<br>      And revenues appropriate to your state,--<br>      But nevermore be seen at Camelot!</p>    
 <p align="left"> MORGAUSE. Why, be a fool, then, and a wittol, do!<br>      And while you play the rogue in others' couches,<br>      --As you are celebrated for that sport,--<br>      Your dearest friend shall get the realm its heir.<br>      God punishes your wantonness right fitly,<br>      You prince of lechers and of perjurers!<br>      You, flower of chivalry! Ay, for chivalry<br>      Means truth to men, if they are stout enough,<br>      And flattering falsehood to a woman's ear.<br>      Murder and lust are the two spurs of knighthood,<br>      Which stains a Lionors and stabs La Rouse!<br>      --Proud harlot, I shall see your downfall yet.</p>    
 <p align="left">                                        [<i> Exit,      followed by </i> KAYE.]</p>    
 <p align="left"> ARTHUR. My Launcelot, sit thou by my Queen. My lords,<br>      This is my friend--through good or ill report<br>      My friend. Who injures him by word or deed,<br>      Were it but the thin film of an idle breath<br>      Clouding the clear glass of his stainless soul,<br>      He injures me; and but that I am King<br>      And may not, being the State more than myself,<br>      Joust like a simple knight, and but that he,<br>      Our stoutest arm as our most knightly heart,<br>      Needs not my lance to right him, I would slay<br>      With mine own hands the knave that did him wrong.</p>    
 <p align="left">                                                                                 [<i> Turns      to </i> GUENEVERE, <i> who rises.</i> ]</p>    
 <p align="left"> And thou, my noble Queen!--If that I ever<br>      By so much as the sullying of a thought<br>      Dimmed the bright clarity of thine imaged whiteness<br>      Within my soul, may Christ remember it<br>      Against me at the Judgment!</p>    
 <p align="center"> [<i> Advances and kisses her, then turns to the others.</i> ]</p>    
 <p align="left">                                              Good      my lords,<br>      Erase this most unnecessary scene<br>      From your remembrance.</p>    
 <p align="left"> LAUNCELOT. [<i> half aside, partly to </i> GUENEVERE <i> and partly      to himself</i> ]. Be less kingly, Arthur,<br>      Or you will split my heart!--not with remorse--<br>      No, not remorse, only eternal pain!--<br>      Why, so the damned are!</p>    
 <p align="left"> GUENEVERE. [<i> half apart</i> ]. To the souls in hell<br>      It is at least permitted to cry out.</p>
