He ought not to be identified with Myrdin Emrys, or Merlin Ambrosius, who was the <i> vates</i>  of Vortigern, and also apparently of Aurelius Ambrosianus,--the man of Roman descent who superseded Vortigern in the Cymric supremacy, and lost it again about 465.  This Myrdin Emrys was probably also the Merlin of Uther Pendragon and of Arthur.  While the name of the latter is associated with Dinas Emrys, or Fort of Emrys, in the Vale of the Waters--Nant Gwynant, which circles round the rugged grandeur of the southern slopes of Snowdon--that of the former, Merlin Caledonius, is inseparably joined to the wavy, far-spreading , and heather-streaked hills between which the Powsail Burn makes its way to the Tweed in the haugh of Drummelzier.  Out of the two Merlins--the earlier and the later--the romancers of the eleventh and following centuries formed a third or legendary Merlin.  Now the personage appears as a vulgar wizard and soothsayer, master of the art of glamoury, to be finally overcome by a woman's wiles, and kept for ever in hopeless captivity.<br>     The Caledonian Merlin is a sufficiently distinct historical personage.  He was the son of Morvryn, who was descended from Coel Godebawc, the head of one of the main royal lines of the Cymri.  He had a twin-sister Gwendydd.  He was the friend of the Prince Gwenddoleu, a lord or king of the North, and he was present at the decisive battle of Ardderyd in 573, when the contest lay between the Pagan and Christian forces of the time.  Merlin was on the Pagan or losing side.  After the defeat and the death of his leader Gwenddoleu, he fled to the wilds of Drummelzier, in the wood of Caledon.  There he spent some years, reputed insane, probably only heart-broken, and despairing of the Cymric cause and his own fortunes,--perhaps doubting the trustworthiness of his original faith or Nature-worship.  Finally, he is said to have died at the hands--rather stones and clubs--of the herdsmen of a princeling of the district, then incorporated in the kingdom afterwards known as Strathclyde, and ruled over by Rydderch Hael, originally lord of Llanerch, or Lanark.  Merlin's grave is pointed out by tradition near the village of Drummelzier, by the side of the Powsail Burn as it joins the Tweed.  There can be little doubt, looking to external and internal evidence, that this Merlin was the author of certain poems now preserved in the "Four Ancient Books of Wales," and that to him also are to be assigned portions of the Merlinian poems, in which there occur interpolations of a later date.  The poems show a peculiarly delicate feeling for nature and natural objects--tree, hill, and fountain--and they are pervaded by a cry of wailing and despair for the fortunes of the Cymric race.  Many of the lines show the deepest pathos; some of them are incorporated in the following poem.<br>     Merlin's relation to the Christianity of the time is indicated in the poem.  Originally a Nature-worshipper--probably with priestly functions--one who reverenced the powers and objects of Nature, and the sun above all, as the lord and symbol of creative and sustaining power, he was more or less affected by the Christianity of the time, but he never fully embraced it.  If it ever had a hold on him, he appears to have relapsed from it in his later years; although conceptions from the faith which was making progress around him mingled with his original beliefs and pretensions to supernatural power and prophetic insight.  This is the Merlin as depicted in the poem.  It opens immediately after the battle of Ardderyd, when, in doubt and despair, the hopes of his life broken, he had fled to the retreat and shelter afforded by the hills and glens of Upper Tweeddale, where, more than a thousand years afterwards, men whose faith was of quite another type found refuge.  Here, in the centre of the wood of Caledon, frequenting a fountain on the hills, he is said to have lived for some years ere he met his violent fate.  Merlin was to a certain extent contemporary with Kentigern, who is said to have met him on the wilds which he haunted, and sought to convert him to the Christianity of the time, with, however, but partial and temporary effect.  The details of the interview, as given hundreds of years afterwards in the "Scotichronicon," are of course a priestly invention, and wholly untrustworthy.  The character of the Merlin of the poem is, I venture to think, in accordance with all the earliest and genuine information we have regarding him.  His sister Gwendydd, The Dawn,--her affection and companionship in his life and troubles--and his early love, Hwimleian, The Gleam,--have their warrant in the original poems, and in the later ones, still of a very early time, in which reference is made to the Bard and Seer of this semi-historic, semi-mythic epoch of the ancient Cymri.<br>       J.V.  <br> <br> 				PERSONS<br> <br> 	Merlin--Bard, Seer, Wizard.<br> 	Gwendydd (The Dawn)--His twin-sister.<br> 	Hwimleian (The Gleam)--His early love.<br> <br> <br> Merlin (<i> in the Glen, and on Drummelzier Law</i> ).<br> <br> All night I've wandered in the glen, 'mid hum<br> Of hidden waters moving in the gloom,<br> And eerie sounds, strange voices from th' unseen,<br> And things have shaped themselves upon the air,<br> Some mocking me, and some soliciting<br> My evil will;--dim, weird sprites, that pass<br> 'Twixt sky and earth in dark hours ere the morn,--<br> Form after form in crowding mystery,<br> Where none can mark the mien of living thing,<br> Or pause upon a face for love or light;<br> But all that seems to be doth also pass<br> In mockery of show to mortal eye.<br> <br> The hill-top now is gained, and lo!  afar<br> The eastern summits redden with the dawn;<br> The moor around me wakes to growing sound<br> And stir of life, all tremulous before<br> The high on-coming of the lord of day.<br> <br> This morn I bow before thee, lord of light<br> And life!--my hope, my fear, my reverence!<br> Of thee unworthy, and my early vows.<br> Far-gleaming arrows, piercing feeble mists,<br> Herald thine uprise; low down in the vales,<br> That pour their loving tribute to the Tweed,<br> The waters shimmer 'mid the morning's joy;<br> Around me burn-heads croon, and moorland birds<br> Awake, a-wing, pipe brief glad notes to thee,<br> The brightening lord of happy melody.<br> Now part in twain the curtains of the dawn,<br> Each hill-top is aflame, and thou hast set<br> Thyself, full-orbed, in empire o'er the day:--<br> Aglow as in that dawn when first enthroned,<br> The wasting ages taking nought from thee,<br> Nor tainted by the evil of this earth,<br> Thou layest now, as new birth of the morn,<br> Thy strength of glory on the circling hills.<br> I worship thee, O sovereign of the sky,<br> The symbol of the God who is unseen.<br> <br> Inspirer, thou, of life and hope and joy,<br> My pulses beat with thine.  Again I feel<br> The blood that leaps to high ambition's quest,<br> And wakes, as sudden flash, my vanished dream,<br> To hold in leash the powers of all this world,<br> Be lord of nature and of human lives,--<br> Phantasm of youth that beckoned and beguiled<br> To empire and emprise, wild, subtle, vain--<br> As if this feeble hand could pluck from thee,<br> O king of day, thy lofty radiance,<br> And usurp thy throne.<br> <br> To know the soul of things has been my quest,<br> To feel the beating of the inmost heart<br> That pulses through the world,--to know and be<br> As God,--a king o'er kings, with subtler power<br> Than that of lords who rule by force of arm,<br> Or wavering tie of human sympathy,--<br> This, this, the dream that dazzled all my youth;<br> And I have dared and done, in this my quest,<br> What no man knows, seen what no eye hath seen--<br> Weird sights not utterable in mortal words,<br> Strange forms o' morn, shapes in the weather-gleam,<br> That silent move and pass along the rim,<br> Clear-set, of the dim world that engirds the hills.<br> Ay, at grey dawn, I've struggled with the bird<br> Of wrath, until the sun came to mine aid,<br> And smote the hovering shadow, beak and wing.--<br> And now the dream is riven, shatterëd,<br> As when the great west wind in strength has struck<br> The summer heaven; and lo! we see but shreds<br> Of all its gilded towers, and broken shapes<br> Athwart the storm-cleft sky.<br> <br> To stand supreme in mystery of might;<br> To lead the battle on to victory;<br> Mine was the pledge, assurance, and the hope,<br> The inspiration, and the faith of men.<br> Their trusting look to me as on the morn<br> They passed, fiend-blessed, to that green plain that lay<br> Between the Liddel's tide and Carwinelow;<br> This lives for aye deep scarred upon my heart.<br> I see the shock, and hear the frusch of spears,<br> Edge grinding edge, all through the fatal hours;<br> Twice seven armies locked in deadly grip,<br> Until at length that Cross, upraised against<br> The evening sky, shot o'er the struggling hosts<br> One blinding ray, as of the wrath of heaven;<br> And in that hour supreme of fate my power<br> Was stricken, and each sprite grew palsied-pale,<br> And passed away before my 'wildered eye,<br> Dissolved as phantom of the feeble air;<br> And then--was nought but faces of the dead,<br> Upturned, upbraiding, in the gloamin' grey;<br> And all was laid 'neath cover of the shade,<br> And all was hushed save the unheeding stream.<br> <br> My prince, my Gwenddoleu, whose golden torques<br> I wore, and thou, well-lovëd Gwendydd's son,<br> Thou fearless bearer of the white-rimmed shield,<br> Where may I seek you now?  Where are my dead,<br> The dead of Ardderyd?  To me ye come<br> No more; no more again your hands I touch,--<br> To me your eyes glance never light of life!<br> "Hath not the burden been consigned to earth?<br> And every one must give up what he loves."<br> The budding thorn is green, the birch is blest,<br> And sweet the melody and chirp of birds;<br> But ye are still, my Moryen and Mordav!<br> Are ye now spirits of the nerveless clouds<br> That speck the shadowed hills and sweep the moor;<br> That dwell in air, and come, and passing wail,<br> Behold the misery of race and kin,<br> But have no power to stretch a hand in aid<br> Of their fell lot?  Oft I hear a voice<br> A-crying in the night, see glimpsing forms<br> In outbreak of the moon through riven sky.<br> Oh! unavailing wail and stricken arm!<br> Is this your heaven?<br> <br> Or are these seemings of the strainëd sense--<br> The fond heart's quickening of the hopeless dead?<br> And is it so that all are surely gone,<br> As is the creed of that far Orient,<br> Whence my race has sprung--to Nirvana's shade,<br> The formless state where nought is marked or known,<br> No sense, no thought, pain, pleasure, or desire;<br> Where keen emotion hath no quickening,<br> And resolute will, unstrung, can dare no deed<br> Of good or ill, and hath no fate to bear:<br> Where comes not e'en a passing dream to stir<br> The unconscious brain, or glint of memory<br> Across the darkened past; but all is one--<br> An absolute repose, alike for those<br> Once harassed by the pains of earthly life,<br> And souls that lived spell-bound in human bliss,<br> Heroes in battle slain, the weak who passed<br> From cottage couch, the proud from palace-hall,<br> The maiden in her bloom, the mother, child;<br> In the absorbing All are life and death alike,--<br> Close folded in unconscious unity?<br> <br> What, then, this life of ours but pain and wreck!--<br> Mirage that hovers fair o'er youthful sky;<br> Inwoven dream that parts as mist before<br> The sun of noon; mid-life a battle 'gainst<br> Fierce striving powers for issues no one knows<br> Are in their final outcome good or ill,--<br> None seeing whither tends the deed we do<br> In the mysterious process of the world!<br> <br> <br> Gwendydd (<i> The Dawn--his twin-sister--sings; she addresses him as Lallogen, twin-brother</i> ).<br> <br> <br> Lallogen! princely Morvryn's son,<br>    Of olden heroes born,<br> Spirit divine, incarnate god,<br>    To thee I bow this morn!<br> <br> Thou, lord of airy powers, that dwell<br>    In speed of the towering cloud,<br> In far out-flash of the levin fell,<br>    In the croak of the raven brood;<br> <br> In the hurrying mist of the moor,<br>    Thy vassal spirits troop,<br> In the striving blast that tears the pine,<br>    In eagle forms that swoop<br> <br> From their course in the rack of the sky--<br>    Playmates of the stormy gleam--<br> Winging to earth the stroke of fate,<br>    As well to thee may beseem!<br> <br> At thy bidding the wrath of the storm<br>    Suddenly smites earth's rest,<br> And swiftly the burns arise and roar<br>    In awe of thy dread behest.<br> <br> The gentle milkwort bows its head,<br>    Cowering beneath the hour,<br> When thy spirit feels not a bound<br>    To its lust of evil power.<br> <br> All unlovely, O brother, is might,<br>    When slave of the wayward will;<br> And passion that knows but to smite<br>    Is self-accursed with its ill.<br> <br> Once blameless wert thou in thy strength,<br>    As on that eve of old,<br> When Saxons fierce from the Frisian Sea<br>    Crept in the mist's grey fold,<br> <br> And sudden swooped on the Meldon green,<br>    From old Penjacob glen,--<br> Thou and I in the lonely Caer,--<br>    No hope or help from men!<br> <br> At calm upraising of thy hand,<br>    And far gleam of thine eye,<br> The rainbow rose round that airy Caer<br>    In sacred majesty.<br> <br> And we two forms within its rim<br>    Shone god-like on the gaze,<br> And every sieging eye was held<br>    In wild and weird amaze!<br> <br> So arched in splendour Meldon's top,<br>    Our blinded foes dismayed,<br> Paled, fled before the Power of Heaven<br>    In its awesome robe arrayed.<br> <br> Now turn thee from the tempter's thrall,<br>    Dream of one bygone day,--<br> The flickering shade o'er the woodland glade<br>    When thou and I were at play,--<br> <br> And thou touched thy harp to a gentle tune<br>    Of happy melody;<br> The deer stood charmed; the golden leaves<br>    Dropped from the quivering tree.<br> <br> Oh, brother! take that harp once more,<br>    All-thrilling to the gleams<br> That pass now o'er the mountain's brow,<br>    'Mid the music of the streams:<br> <br> As from the heaven's height they come,<br>    Bright messengers to earth:<br> Ethereal love doth shine in them,<br>    They speak a god-like birth.<br> <br> And high they bear our human heart<br>    O'er grief, and fear, and pain:<br> Ah, brother!

this voice once more--this voice to me--<br> The faithless to the truest love on earth!<br> She has conquered death, and calls from th' unseen<br> To me, dim groper after truth and power,<br> Yet missing bliss! man mocked and satisfied<br> With outward show and sensual pageantry.<br> The outer seeming, not the truth itself,<br> Has been my portion; husk, not fruit, was mine,--<br> The trick of art which awes, destroys, but builds<br> Not for the world: when it hath passed, remain<br> The waste of ashes, cowering dread, despair,<br> The glare of power that briefly flames in space,<br> Its whole reward--the dazzling snare whereby<br> The spirit of the world leads captive souls<br> Whose trust is in their strength, divorced from love,<br> And silent working, patient thought and faith,<br> That move the springs of progress and of hope--<br> Not waited on by fame or noisy talk<br> Of buzzing tongues, or clamour of the crowd--<br> Yet in the course of ages moulding men<br> To noble likeness, life of higher grade.<br> The stream of order from th' Eternal Fount<br> Flows free and full, unmeasured in its might,<br> Unthwarted, suffering not disharmony,<br> But thrusting all our rebel strokes aside,<br> And mocking all our puny might to grasp,<br> And turn aside from its unerring aim.<br> One Will there is in heaven and on earth--<br> 'Tis mirrored in the open-visioned soul.<br> Who waits the revelation only knows,<br> Who bows before the Power hath true control.<br> <br> <br> 		Gwendydd.<br> <br> <br> The dew is on the grave that holds my son;<br> The grass upon the mound is green where lies<br> Our Gwenddoleu.
