A dream.  O light upon the wind,<br>  Thine, Gawain, was the voice--are these dim cries<br>  Thine? or doth all that haunts the waste and wild<br>  Mourn, knowing it will go along with me?"<br>  This heard the bold Sir Bedivere and spake:<br>  "O me, my King, let pass whatever will,<br>  Elves, and the harmless glamour of the field;<br>  But in their stead thy name and glory cling<br>  To all high places like a golden cloud<br>  For ever:  but as yet thou shalt not pass.<br>  Light was Gawain in life, and light in death<br>  Is Gawain, for the ghost is as the man;<br>  And care not thou for dreams from him, but rise--<br>  I hear the steps of Modred in the west,<br>  And with him many of thy people, and knights<br>  Once thine, whom thou hast loved, but grosser grown<br>  Than heathen, spitting at their vows and thee.<br>  Right well in heart they know thee for the King.<br>  Arise, go forth and conquer as of old."<br>  <br>     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:<br>  "Far other is this battle in the west<br>  Whereto we move, than when we strove in youth,<br>  And brake the petty kings, and fought with Rome,<br>  Or thrust the heathen from the Roman wall,<br>  And shook him through the north.  Ill doom is mine<br>  To war against my people and my knights.<br>  The king who fights his people fights himself.<br>  And they my knights, who loved me once, the stroke<br>  That strikes them dead is as my death to me.<br>  Yet let us hence, and find or feel a way<br>  Through this blind haze, which ever since I saw<br>  One lying in the dust at Almesbury,<br>  Hath folded in the passes of the world."<br>  <br>     Then rose the King and moved his host by night,<br>  And ever pushed Sir Modred, league by league,<br>  Back to the sunset bound of Lyonnesse--<br>  A land of old upheaven from the abyss<br>  By fire, to sink into the abyss again;<br>  Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt,<br>  And the long mountains ended in a coast<br>  Of ever-shifting sand, and far away<br>  The phantom circle of a moaning sea.<br>  There the pursuer could pursue no more,<br>  And he that fled no further fly the King;<br>  And there, that day when the great light of heaven<br>  Burned at his lowest in the rolling year,<br>  On the waste sand by the waste sea they closed.<br>  Nor ever yet had Arthur fought a fight<br>  Like this last, dim, weird battle of the west.<br>  A deathwhite mist slept over sand and sea:<br>  Whereof the chill, to him who breathed it, drew<br>  Down with his blood, till all his heart was cold<br>  With formless fear; and even on Arthur fell<br>  Confusion, since he saw not whom he fought.<br>  For friend and foe were shadows in the mist,<br>  And friend slew friend not knowing whom he slew;<br>  And some had visions out of golden youth,<br>  And some beheld the faces of old ghosts<br>  Look in upon the battle; and in the mist<br>  Was many a noble deed, many a base,<br>  And chance and craft and strength in single fights,<br>  And ever and anon with host to host<br>  Shocks, and the splintering spear, the hard mail hewn,<br>  Shield-breakings, and the clash of brands, the crash<br>  Of battleaxes on shattered helms, and shrieks<br>  After the Christ, of those who falling down<br>  Looked up for heaven, and only saw the mist;<br>  And shouts of heathen and the traitor knights,<br>  Oaths, insult, filth, and monstrous blasphemies,<br>  Sweat, writhings, anguish, labouring of the lungs<br>  In that close mist, and cryings for the light,<br>  Moans of the dying, and voices of the dead.<br>  <br>     Last, as by some one deathbed after wail<br>  Of suffering, silence follows, or through death<br>  Or deathlike swoon, thus over all that shore,<br>  Save for some whisper of the seething seas,<br>  A dead hush fell; but when the dolorous day<br>  Grew drearier toward twilight falling, came<br>  A bitter wind, clear from the North, and blew<br>  The mist aside, and with that wind the tide<br>  Rose, and the pale King glanced across the field<br>  Of battle:  but no man was moving there;<br>  Nor any cry of Christian heard thereon,<br>  Nor yet of heathen; only the wan wave<br>  Brake in among dead faces, to and fro<br>  Swaying the helpless hands, and up and down<br>  Tumbling the hollow helmets of the fallen,<br>  And shivered brands that once had fought with Rome,<br>  And rolling far along the gloomy shores<br>  The voice of days of old and days to be.<br>  <br>     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere,<br>  And whiter than the mist that all day long<br>  Had held the field of battle was the King:<br>  <br>     "Hearest thou this great voice that shakes the world,<br>  And wastes the narrow realm whereon we move,<br>  And beats upon the faces of the dead,<br>  My dead, as though they had not died for me?--<br>  O Bedivere, for on my heart hath fallen<br>  Confusion, till I know not what I am,<br>  Nor whence I am, nor whether I be King.<br>  Behold, I seem but King among the dead."<br>  <br>     Then spake the bold Sir Bedivere:  "My King,<br>  King everywhere! and so the dead have kings,<br>  There also will I worship thee as King.<br>  Yet still thy life is whole, and still I live<br>  Who love thee; but who hates thee, he that brought<br>  The heathen back among us, yonder stands,<br>  Modred, unharmed, the traitor of thine house."<br>  <br>     Then spake the King:  "My house hath been my doom.<br>  But call not thou this traitor of my house<br>  Who hath but dwelt beneath one roof with me.<br>  My house are rather they who sware my vows,<br>  Yea, even while they brake them, owned me King.<br>  And well for thee, saying in my dark hour,<br>  When all the purport of my throne hath failed,<br>  That quick or dead thou holdest me for King.<br>  King am I, whatsoever be their cry;<br>  And one last act of kinghood shalt thou see<br>  Yet, ere I pass."  And uttering this the King<br>  Made at the man:  then Modred smote his liege<br>  Hard on that helm which many a heathen sword<br>  Had beaten thin; while Arthur at one blow,<br>  Striking the last stroke with Excalibur,<br>  Slew him, and all but slain himself, he fell.<br>  <br>     So all day long the noise of battle rolled<br>  Among the mountains by the winter sea;<br>  Until King Arthur's Table, man by man,<br>  Had fallen in Lyonnesse about their lord,<br>  King Arthur.  Then, because his wound was deep,<br>  The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,<br>  And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,<br>  A broken chancel with a broken cross,<br>  That stood on a dark strait of barren land:<br>  On one side lay the Ocean, and on one<br>  Lay a great water, and the moon was full.<br>  <br>     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:<br>  "The sequel of today unsolders all<br>  The goodliest fellowship of famous knights<br>  Whereof this world holds record.  Such a sleep<br>  They sleep--the men I loved.  I think that we<br>  Shall never more, at any future time,<br>  Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,<br>  Walking about the gardens and the halls<br>  Of Camelot, as in the days that were.<br>  I perish by this people which I made,--<br>  Though Merlin sware that I should come again<br>  To rule once more; but, let what will be, be,<br>  I am so deeply smitten through the helm<br>  That without help I cannot last till morn.<br>  Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,<br>  Which was my pride:  for thou rememberest how<br>  In those old days, one summer noon, an arm<br>  Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,<br>  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,<br>  Holding the sword--and how I rowed across<br>  And took it, and have worn it, like a king;<br>  And, wheresoever I am sung or told<br>  In aftertime, this also shall be known:<br>  But now delay not:  take Excalibur,<br>  And fling him far into the middle mere:<br>  Watch what thou seëst, and lightly bring me word."<br>  <br>     To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:<br>  "It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,<br>  Aidless, alone, and smitten through the helm--<br>  A little thing may harm a wounded man;<br>  Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,<br>  Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word."<br>  <br>     So saying, from the ruined shrine he stept,<br>  And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,<br>  Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,<br>  Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang<br>  Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam.  He, stepping down<br>  By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock,<br>  Came on the shining levels of the lake.<br>  <br>     There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,<br>  And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,<br>  Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth<br>  And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:<br>  For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,<br>  Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work<br>  Of subtlest jewellery.  He gazed so long<br>  That both his eyes were dazzled as he stood,<br>  This way and that dividing the swift mind,<br>  In act to throw:  but at the last it seemed<br>  Better to leave Excalibur concealed<br>  There in the many-knotted waterflags,<br>  That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.<br>  So strode he back slow to the wounded King.<br>  <br>     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:<br>  "Hast thou performed my mission which I gave?<br>  What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"<br>  <br>     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:<br>  "I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,<br>  And the wild water lapping on the crag."<br>  <br>     To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:<br>  "Thou hast betrayed thy nature and thy name,<br>  Not rendering true answer, as beseemed<br>  Thy fëalty, nor like a noble knight:<br>  For surer sign had followed, either hand,<br>  Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.<br>  This is a shameful thing for men to lie.<br>  Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again,<br>  As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing<br>  I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."<br>  <br>     Then went Sir Bedivere the second time<br>  Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,<br>  Counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought;<br>  But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,<br>  How curiously and strangely chased, he smote<br>  His palms together, and he cried aloud:<br>  <br>     "And if indeed I cast the brand away,<br>  Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,<br>  Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,<br>  Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.<br>  What good should follow this, if this were done?<br>  What harm, undone?  Deep harm to disobey,<br>  Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.<br>  Were it well to obey then, if a king demand<br>  An act unprofitable, against himself?<br>  The King is sick, and knows not what he does.<br>  What record, or what relic of my lord<br>  Should be to aftertime, but empty breath<br>  And rumours of a doubt?  But were this kept,<br>  Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,<br>  Some one might show it at a joust of arms,<br>  Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,<br>  Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.<br>  Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps<br>  Upon the hidden bases of the hills."<br>  So might some old man speak in the aftertime<br>  To all the people, winning reverence.<br>  But now much honour and much fame were lost."<br>  <br>     So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,<br>  And hid Excalibur the second time,<br>  And so strode back slow to the wounded King.<br>  <br>     Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:<br>  "What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"<br>  <br>     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:<br>  "I heard the water lapping on the crag,<br>  And the long ripple washing in the reeds."<br>  <br>     To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:<br>  "Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,<br>  Unknightly, traitor-hearted!  Woe is me!<br>  Authority forgets a dying king,<br>  Laid widowed of the power in his eye<br>  That bowed the will.  I see thee what thou art,<br>  For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,<br>  In whom should meet the offices of all,<br>  Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;<br>  Either from lust of gold, or like a girl<br>  Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.<br>  Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,<br>  And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:<br>  But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,<br>  I will arise and slay thee with my hands."<br>  <br>     Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,<br>  And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged<br>  Among the bulrush beds, and clutched the sword,<br>  And strongly wheeled and threw it.  The great brand<br>  Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,<br>  And flashing round and round, and whirled in an arch,<br>  Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,<br>  Seen where the moving isles of winter shock<br>  By night, with noises of the Northern Sea.<br>  So flashed and fell the brand Excalibur:<br>  But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm<br>  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,<br>  And caught him by the hilt, and brandished him<br>  Three times, and drew him under in the mere.<br>  And lightly went the other to the King.<br>  <br>     Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:<br>  "Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.<br>  Speak out:  what is it thou hast heard, or seen?"<br>  <br>     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:<br>  "Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems<br>  Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,<br>  Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,<br>  So great a miracle as yonder hilt.<br>  Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;<br>  But when I looked again, behold an arm,<br>  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,<br>  That caught him by  the hilt, and brandished him<br>  Three times, and drew him under in the mere."<br>  <br>     And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:<br>  "My end draws nigh; 'tis time that I were gone.<br>  Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,<br>  And bear me to the margin; yet I fear<br>  My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die."<br>  <br>     So saying, from the pavement he half rose,<br>  Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,<br>  And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes<br>  As in a picture.  Him Sir Bedivere<br>  Remorsefully regarded through his tears,<br>  And would have spoken, but he found not words;<br>  Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,<br>  O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,<br>  And rising bore him through the place of tombs.<br>  <br>     But, as he walked, King Arthur panted hard,<br>  Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed<br>  When all the house is mute.  So sighed the King,<br>  Muttering and murmuring at his ear, "Quick, quick!<br>  I fear it is too late, and I shall die."<br>  But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,<br>  Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walked,<br>  Larger than human on the frozen hills.<br>  He heard the deep behind him, and a cry<br>  Before.  His own thought drove him like a goad.<br>  Dry clashed his harness in the icy caves<br>  And barren chasms, and all to left and right<br>  The bare black cliff clanged round him, as he based<br>  His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang<br>  Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels--<br>  And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,<br>  And the long glories of the winter moon.<br>  <br>     Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,<br>  Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,<br>  Beneath them; and descending they were ware<br>  That all the decks were dense with stately forms,<br>  Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream--by these<br>  Three Queens with crowns of gold:  and from them rose<br>  A cry that shivered to the tingling stars,<br>  And, as it were one voice, an agony<br>  Of lamentation, like a wind that shrills<br>  All night in a waste land, where no one comes,<br>  Or hath come, since the making of the world.<br>  <br>     Then murmured Arthur, "Place me in the barge."<br>  So to the barge they came.  There those three Queens<br>  Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.<br>  But she, that rose the tallest of them all<br>  And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,<br>  And loosed the shattered casque, and chafed his hands,<br>  And called him by his name, complaining loud,<br>  And dropping bitter tears against a brow<br>  Striped with dark blood:  for all his face was white<br>  And colourless, and like the withered moon<br>  Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;<br>  And all his greaves and cuisses dashed with drops<br>  Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls--<br>  That made his forehead like a rising sun<br>  High from the daïs-throne--were parched with dust;<br>  Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,<br>  Mixed with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.<br>  So like a shattered column lay the King;<br>  Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,<br>  From spur to plume a star of tournament,<br>  Shot through the lists at Camelot, and charged<br>  Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.<br>  <br>     Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere:<br>  "Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?<br>  Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?<br>  For now I see the true old times are dead,<br>  When every morning brought a noble chance,<br>  And every chance brought out a noble knight.<br>  Such times have been not since the light that led<br>  The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.<br>  But now the whole Round Table is dissolved<br>  Which was an image of the mighty world,<br>  And I, the last, go forth companionless,<br>  And the days darken round me, and the years,<br>  Among new men, strange faces, other minds."<br>  <br>     And slowly answered Arthur from the barge:<br>  "The old order changeth, yielding place to new,<br>  And God fulfils himself in many ways,<br>  Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.<br>  Comfort thyself:  what comfort is in me?<br>  I have lived my life, and that which I have done<br>  May He within himself make pure! but thou,<br>  If thou shouldst never see my face again,<br>  Pray for my soul.  More things are wrought by prayer<br>  Than this world dreams of.  Wherefore, let thy voice<br>  Rise like a fountain for me night and day.<br>  For what are men better than sheep or goats<br>  That nourish a blind life within the brain,<br>  If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer<br>  Both for themselves and those who call them friend?<br>  For so the whole round earth is every way<br>  Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.<br>  But now farewell.  I am going a long way<br>  With these thou seëst--if indeed I go<br>  (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)--<br>  To the island-valley of Avilion;<br>  Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,<br>  Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies<br>  Deep-meadowed, happy, fair with orchard lawns<br>  And bowery hollows crowned with summer sea,<br>  Where I will heal me of my grievous wound."<br>  <br>     So said he, and the barge with oar and sail<br>  Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan<br>  That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,<br>  Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood<br>  With swarthy webs.  Long stood Sir Bedivere<br>  Revolving many memories, till the hull<br>  Looked one black dot against the verge of dawn,<br>  And on the mere the wailing died away.<br>  <br>     But when that moan had past for evermore,<br>  The stillness of the dead world's winter dawn<br>  Amazed him, and he groaned, "The King is gone."<br>  And therewithal came on him the weird rhyme,<br>  "From the great deep to the great deep he goes."<br>  <br>     Whereat he slowly turned and slowly clomb<br>  The last hard footstep of that iron crag;<br>  Thence marked the black hull moving yet, and cried,<br>  "He passes to be King among the dead,<br>  And after healing of his grievous wound<br>  He comes again; but--if he come no more--<br>  O me, be yon dark Queens in yon black boat,<br>  Who shrieked and wailed, the three whereat we gazed<br>  On that high day, when, clothed with living light,<br>  They stood before his throne in silence, friends<br>  Of Arthur, who should help him at his need?"<br>  <br>     Then from the dawn it seemed there came, but faint<br>  As from beyond the limit of the world,<br>  Like the last echo born of a great cry,<br>  Sounds, as if some fair city were one voice<br>  Around a king returning from his wars.<br>  <br>     Thereat once more he moved about, and clomb<br>  Even to the highest he could climb, and saw,<br>  Straining his eyes beneath an arch of hand,<br>  Or thought he saw, the speck that bare the King,<br>  Down that long water opening on the deep<br>  Somewhere far off, pass on and on, and go<br>  From less to less and vanish into light.<br>  And the new sun rose bringing the new year.<br>
