A path runs across; on the right side the big rocks stand; on the left the ground is less broken.  It is the first day of May, the wood is all green, and the wild flowers blooming.  There is a sound of running water, and many birds sing in the trees.</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Enter Sir Mordred, Sir Agravaine, and Sir Gawain.</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Curse those little feathered devils, all<br>  The trees are full of them, singing as if <br>  The air were silver sweet with feast bells,<br>  And the world were sweet, and life sweet and free<br>  From hate.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Come, come, my lord, let the birds alone, their notes<br>  Are sweet and limpid like the lives of simple <br>  Men in this world.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Aye, squeeze your stale morals from nature, brother,<br>  For every weather a mood.  As if she had <br>  Not planted in our bloods the heaviness<br>  Of hate, as I do hate Sir Launcelot,<br>  And scorn the white-souled Arthur.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  And I do hate this lusty knight.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Brothers, brothers, stint your noise.  Ye know<br>  And well that had Sir Launcelot not proved<br>  Himself in our behalf, we had been by now<br>  Full cold at the heart-root.  He hath saved us all,<br>  And many a time, has wen-<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Small matter that.  He hath a joy in heat <br>  And struggle.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Small matter very like, and men do hate <br>  The objects of their own ingratitude.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Daily and nightly he is with the queen.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Ye know it not.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Aye, do we.  And the king is shamed--<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Nay, nay, spare that, you care not for Arthur, 'tis<br>  Some privy hate you bear the queen, or grudge<br>  Against Sir Launcelot.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Tush!  'tis all prattle.  Lend me your ear, good brother.<br>  Come, think you not in any of us three<br>  Were stuff for a king?<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Thou king?  Said I not so?  Shame, Mordred, shame!<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Nay, nay, brother Mordred, 'tis the general cause<br>  That moves thee, 'member that, the general cause.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Be not so busy, I pray you, for of this<br>   Will the whole realm be mischieved.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Fall what may, what I have said I have said.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  That I believe, for thou hadst ever a tooth<br>  For all unhappiness.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  King Arthur hath consented to this plan<br>  To take the queen by force and lie in wait<br>  For Launcelot to rescue her.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Take the queen, thou sayest?<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Then some romantic hour to catch the two<br>  Together.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Take the queen?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Hist!  here's two-the first is Idawc<br>  Of Cornwall; 'tis your poetical,<br>  Gapes-at-a-ballad cub-he'll be with us.<br>  And old Sir Kay, sour as curds.  <i> (Enter Idawc and Sir Kay.)</i>   How now<br>  Fair lords?  We speak of the widening reft betwixt<br>  The king and the queen, what think you?<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  'Tis a great tangle, this marriage knot.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  The king consents?  To snare the queen?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Consents, though we had nigh not brought him to it.<br>  He hath a deeming strong as ours, but shuns<br>  The outcome of such publishment of falseness<br>  In the heart of the realm.  'Tis a dreamer, and his world <br>  Peoples itself with airy shapes, and stretches<br>  Rapt vistas for his eye to travel in,<br>  Conversing with visions.  They say he hath<br>  Small ear for the queen but hourly weigheth him<br>  Some cloud-vast enterprise or famous venture,<br>  So that his kingdom is his spouse and not <br>  The queen.  To him she is fair womanhood,<br>  The finer element within the scheme,<br>  And not a woman.  Therefore being human-<br>  <br>  <i> Idawc</i> <br>  True, dost thou--<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  True, most true.  It is no king men see,<br>  But is a mist.<br>  <br>  <i> Idawc</i> <br>  Dost thou remember once at harvest time-<br>  'Twas at the dying twilight, and the moon,<br>  Drowsily waking from the dusky east,<br>  Did shed a glamourous vapour o'er the water,<br>  Bargemen hither, thither ran to light <br>  Their torches, music strummed, and on the bank<br>  Thronged with embarkings for the river pageant-<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Came what-well what is't at the pageant?  Here's <br>  No time for fooling, youth.<br>  <br>  <i> Idawc</i> <br>  Why, on a barge sheathed all in golden samite,<br>  We saw the white queen like fair summer wings<br>  Upon a lotus flower.  There apart<br>  Stood Arthur musing, chin in hand, or gazed <br>  On the stars, and sad dim space, as he would read<br>  Their meaning.  Lo!  one said, "Seest not the queen <br>  Upon yon barge, my lord?"  Arthur turned<br>  Where she did beckon him to look on her,<br>  And said, "White hue on yellow, sure some sign,<br>  Fair virtue thus surmounteth jealousy."<br>  So killed all joyaunce with his moral carp.<br>  But Launcelot beheld her as a vision,<br>  And cried, all dazed with her loveliness,<br>  "God's life, thou'rt fairer than the heaven!"<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Odds, by my beard, 'tis past my patience.<br>  What woman cares to prate of attributes,<br>  Of whys and wherefores and such moral twaddle?<br>  These axioms be poor pudding for their stomachs<br>  When they might hear men sing their beauty's praise-<br>  <br>  <i> Idawc</i> <br>  Fie, my lord!<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Fie not.  The king is blinded with star-dust,<br>  For once I ventured:  "If thou thoughtest more<br>  Of this same fleshly world, my lord,<br>  'Twere better haply for thee and for it."<br>  Said I, "There's holiness as true, I wis,<br>  About the humblest, rushlit cottage door <br>  As at the Portal of the Starry Lamps.<br>  Men's souls need human fellowship to ripen <br>  Them for God, as many twigs do lift <br>  Higher the flame."  Methought in that<br>  I was fair eloquent-<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  And he-mark me it was some ponderable <br>  Stuff he spake-<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  He turned and said, "Here in this life the soul<br>  Is solitary and yearns ever toward<br>  The Solitary, the Great One beyond."<br>  Meaning somewhat I dare say, for he bent<br>  Upon me his wide-dreaming eye<br>  Till I was wildered with their steady burning.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Come, 'tis no time now for remembrances.<br>  Soon come the knights to hear our plot.  They will<br>  Lend hands, for ever trouble-brew draws men.<br>  From diverse causes-<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Aye, some like me for stubborn certainty <br>  Desire to prove at all costs what they know.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Be not too sure.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  For some men rather would be sure and die<br>  Than live in midst of doubtings.  Ah how,<br>  How if this cause splits brothers thus, will all<br>  The court be rent!<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Some for gain-<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Aye, you will reward them, brother.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  I did not say so.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Leave wrangling, they are at hand.<br>  <br>  <i> (Enter knights, Sir Bors, Sir Uriens, Sir Tor, and others.  All wear blank shields.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Good morrow, fair knights!  The time doth press, come,<br>     come,<br>  Ring me round here, and let me speak our plan.<br>  Who here knows not the shame that flares at court,<br>  Open as day?  Think not the king deceived;<br>  He hath a deeming, but he is full loth to speak,<br>  Seeing how ofttimes Sir Launcelot hath served<br>  The king and the queen and saved their worship.<br>  And if we take not Launcelot with the queen<br>  And make accusal, you know the accuser must<br>  Prove't on Sir Launcelot himself; the which <br>  No living wight hath yet done.  But if <br>  We take him-<br>  <br>  <i> Meliagraunce</i> <br>  But, my lord, how may this be done?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Peace, and I will tell you.  This day<br>  Is the queen's maying and even now she rides<br>  To woods and fields.  With her come ten of the Queen's<br>     Knights,<br>  Who ride thus ever near to her, and joust <br>  For her, and wear no manner of arms but hers.<br>  They shall be dressed in green and white, and go<br>  Gathering herbs and flowers to deck themselves<br>  For maying.  There'll be songs-<br>  <br>  <i> Meliagraunce</i> <br>  Well?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Well, I saw them start, and they shall come <br>  This way, and we will take them.<br>  <br>  <i> (Confusion.)</i> <br>  <br>  Nay, nay, stir not, nor mutter discontent,<br>  But hear me.  We will take the queen and hers<br>  To my castle hard by, she will send in secret <br>  Unto Sir Launcelot and he will come.<br>  <br>  <i> Meliagraunce</i> <br>  Aye, he will come, mark you he will come!<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Aye, he will come.  We'll seem to yield, then take<br>  Him later with the queen.  The king himself shall<br>     see it.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Sir Launcelot will come to rescue her,<br>  The king shall be brought, and we shall catch our birds <br>  Together.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Here's Cador and Breuse linked arm in arm, and drunk<br>  As always.  'Tis strange they lack preferment<br>  At court.  Now sure 'twill not be long for them,<br>  Such worthlessness could never fail to be<br>  Rewarded by the state.  Sir Breuse hath bound<br>  A tavern garland on his brow, and look,<br>  Cador hath him a bread-cake for a shield.<br>  <br>  <i> (Enter Cador and Breuse.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Steady, steady!<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  Steady!  We go to make a kingdom now.<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Aye, we be statesmen, and 'twere well to walk<br>  Straight.<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  'Tis a hard matter.<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Keep hold on me, and 'twill be well.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Aye, that's politic.  Ho!  young sops,<br>  What is't in the air?<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  'Tis a new king I scent, methinks.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  We have no time for them, come, come!  Doubt not<br>  But we shall catch our birds together.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Catch them together-how?  Think you the queen<br>  Will bide an hour longer than need be <br>  In thy black walls?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  That I do.  Sir Launcelot hath pained<br>  Himself too much already on her part,<br>  She will keep low to 'scape the scandal.  That,<br>  Or we can hobble up her knights that they<br>  Will not depart so speedily.  The queen <br>  Will not desert them methinks.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Scandal!<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i>  Aye, scandal, 'tis the eye of the matter.<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Scandal, what is scandal?<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  'Tis piety with a bit of news to tell.<br>  A fair garland thou hast, my lord.<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  To keep my memory green, belike.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  The fruit of the vine is within, is't not?  A gallant <br>  Shield hast thou, Cador.  'Twill keep off death.<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Truly it may be.<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  Nay, nay, eat not thy defence, brave lord.  Stand up!<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  'Twere more avail to swallow thy spear, methinks.<br>  'Twould help thee stand.<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  Art thou the king, Sir Mordred, yet-yet?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Silence, thou muddled fool.  Not yet, nor ever!<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  I went to say I could not worship thee.<br>  I serve the fallen angel that the priest<br>  Told me of, naming him not.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Angel?<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  Wine, 'tis a fallen angel.<br>  <br>  <i> Knight</i> <br>  Keen-carved, Sir Garland.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Sure one would listen at thine ear as at<br>  A sea-shell for the empty roaring.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  'Tis no time for such chaffering.  Get them aside,<br>  Good Sir Kay, stop but their noise and I <br>  Were much beholden to you.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  'Twould merit somewhat.  Come, ye princely wits,<br>  Let me but tell my latest dream-'twas that<br>  A shower of wine will fall this Friday next-<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Wine!  Haste thee, Breuse, find one that hath a moat<br>  To sell.  Good Sir Kay, tell more!<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Come then and I will satisfy you.  <i> (They go to the left of the stage.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  My lords, let me speak.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Nay, hear him not, my lords, for he had rather<br>  Corruption bred and rotted at the court<br>  Than he should stir his sluggish feet in struggle.<br>  <br>  <i> Knight</i> <br>  Craven!  Fie!<br>  <br>  <i> Second Knight</i> <br>  We'll hear Sir Gawain.<br>  <br>  <i> Cries</i> <br>  Sir Gawain!  Sir Gawain!  Fie!  Craven!  Sir Gawain!<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Hear me briefly.  My lords, it is a grievous <br>  Thing to wreck a good man's fortune.  God<br>  Will break the evil.  Therefore have we no need<br>  To avenge the king.  That Launcelot is false ye <br>     know<br>  Not yet, but know if he be found so what<br>  Will fall on us.  Shipwreck and storm and split-<br>  Arthur is king, but Launcelot hath lands,<br>  Hath bournes and territories of huge extent<br>  Here in this island, and doth own a realm<br>  In Fraunce, castles and followers.  Let but <br>  Discord raise her head between them two,<br>  And this demesne of Britain will be rent<br>  In twain, racked and overwhelmed; the fellowship<br>  Of the King's Round Table broke, the noblest face<br>  And form of chivalry be felled and gutted<br>  In a civil strife.  And if in truth-<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Hurry, man, art thou old Nestor come<br>  Back from Hell, and windier than ever?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  True, brother.  Come closer, Sir Knights, and ye<br>  Shall see the better justice of our plans.  <i> (They withdraw to left.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Kay (on the right)</i> <br>  Calm thee, calm thee!  Spare thy words.  The world <br>  Hath deafened itself already with much speech.<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse (mounts a rock)</i> <br>  I'll be a king, have I not a crown?<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  But little in it.<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Brains were not missed in a king, good sir.  He is<br>  My friend.<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  I will be an historical king, and marry <br>  Me three wives.<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Nay, sweet friend, when thou art king, wed not.<br>  King married is not king, but the queen's husband.<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  Weep not, thou mayst serve me.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Aye, listen yonder.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  If Launcelot doth then love the queen, hath he<br>  Not championed her more than the saintly Arthur?<br>  If still ye head on this I say I am <br>  Not with you, and depart.<br>  <br>  <i> Bors</i> <br>  Nor will I hear your tales, nor share your counsels.<br>  <br>  <i> Blamor</i> <br>  Nor I be traitor 'gainst the noblest knight<br>  In all the world.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Wilt thou take hence that two?<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Glad were I.  When they be sober they<br>  Will give me thanks.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Go, Cador, and thou Breuse, this man hath found<br>  A fishpond lately dried.  'Twill hold thy wine.<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Come, come, good Sir.  What is't to Friday?  <i> (Exeunt Gawain, Breuse, Cador, Bors,    and Blamor.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  They are like some fishes, my lord, and dread the light.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Let Launcelot and the queen be caught.<br>  <br>  <i> Knight</i> <br>  Ho!  Sir Kay, 'tis the cream, the cake of solid<br>  Sense.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Silence, I pray you.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Have I not told the king to tread on Earth?<br>  Answer me that.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Yea, yea, greybeard.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Once Sir Launcelot changed mail with me<br>  And saved me at a venture.  Odds, at my<br>  Best feasts they cannot eat for love.  I had served<br>  Him for his courtesy-leave out the queen-<br>  And I had fed him fat as the Duke of Dutchmen.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Rattle your keys, Sir Kay, instead of your tongue,<br>  Your jams are sweeter than your words.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Sweeter for thy tongue haply; for it<br>  Hath tasted of more jam than of wise words.<br>  <br>  <i> Tor</i> <br>  The shame burns deep, the purging of the court<br>  Will uplift all the realm and bring to bloom <br>  Again the chaste flower of the earlier days.<br>  <br>  <i> Persaunt</i> <br>  Nay, I dare swear my lady's purity.  Be the truth<br>  As it may, shame unto a man that speaks<br>  Shamefully of a lady and a queen.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  You wear fresh flowers, youth, but they will fade.<br>  <br>  <i> Cries</i> <br>  I am against this thing.  Let it be tried, Cowards!<br>     And I!<br>  <br>  <i> (Confusion, and the taking of sides.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Thus is the whole court rent to many minds,<br>  The venture is dangerous.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Nay, speak to them with that tongue of thine and they<br>  Will follow--<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Fair lords, young knights full of the noble fire<br>  Of youth, put up your swords, hear me!<br>  <br>  <i> (Confusion.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Knights</i> <br>  Sir Mordred!  Fie!  Cowards!  Sir Mordred!<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  My lords, none of us would the queen took hurt<br>  From this we go to do.  Think ye not so.<br>  The thing is this, doubt like a hidden mould<br>  Eats up the peace of the court--sure the thing<br>  Touches us all equally.  Certain<br>  Evil would I rather choose than blank<br>  Uncertainty.<br>  <br>  <i> Knight</i> <br>  And after she is ta'en, my lord, what then?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Then I will feign hot love for her, and threaten<br>  Masteries.  Sir Launcelot will come<br>  And we shall see what door the wind blows in.<br>  <br>  <i> (There is the sound of talk and laughter.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  They come.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  'Tis too late but to prove the thing as planned.<br>  <br>  <i> Persaunt</i> <br>  Would I had kept out of this.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Too late for temperance after the lips are wet.<br>  <br>  <i> (Exeunt all, hiding themselves behind rocks and trees to the left.  Enter the queen with twelve knights and three ladies, all in green and white, wearing wreaths and bearing garlands of flowers.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  But leave, good sirs, this hunting talk<br>  Of falcons, jesses, leash and lure, there's love,<br>  We have not spoke of that, and it is May.<br>  Sing my lord, one of the songs you learned<br>  In your knave service at the court.<br>  <br>  <i> Gareth</i> <br>  'Tis but a kitchen song, my lady, sung<br>  By humble wenches at ring-time.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Sir Knight, if thou wert armed, I'd send thee back<br>  To bring me water in thy helmet all<br>  This way, as penance for thy dulness.<br>  Cannot the humblest woman sing her love,<br>  My lord?  Love maketh any woman as <br>  A queen, I pray you sing.<br>  <br>  <i> Gareth (sings)</i> <br>     The white-thorn blossoms blow,<br>     And sweet buttercups in the grass,<br>     Go woo, my lad, go wooing!<br>     In winter frosts the blood is slow,<br>     But lusty May makes every lass<br>     Come smiling to your wooing.<br>     Weave marigolds within your hair,<br>     Go woo, my lad, go wooing,<br>     For spring makes all the lasses fair<br>     And ready for your wooing!<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  'Tis a fair chaunt.

This is the time<br>  When maids may learn what manner of fortune waiteth <br>  Them, and who their knights haply may be.<br>  Therefore Lyone and Enid and Ygraine,<br>  Bide with me here.  And ye, Sir Knights, shall leave<br>  Us and go on a little space ahead,<br>  And one by one each maid shall search the pond<br>  For her fate's image.<br>  <br>  <i> Lyone</i> <br>  Thou too wilt read thy glass, wilt thou not, my lady?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Nay, nay, I am an aged dame, and all<br>  My ships are in already.

To me she hath been ever fair<br>  And gentle, and to my knights and to all ladies,<br>  A queen among women and a woman among<br>  Queens.  And that Sir Launcelot loves her<br>  I dare say.

I know not wherefore I am racked<br>  With dread.  But now I did see black shapes hurtle<br>  Think upon the gust; the wind doth reek<br>  With pests and fevers, rank and rotten fogs<br>  Come from the sloughs.  This stinking of the air<br>  Liketh me not.  The stars are stubborn, all<br>  This darkness here is much too thick.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  'Tis so.  But now the moon shined clear, now she<br>  Is gone.  The morbid air doth suck up humours<br>  From the glens, a death-sweet perfume that<br>  But half doth please me.  The heaven is silent,<br>  And round the world the mantle of the dusk<br>  Cloaks heavily.  What noise was that?<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  It was the clock at the postern gate that smote.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  What hour, didst thou take count?<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Eleven, my lady.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Think you it a lucky hour?<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Nay, I know not, but I--<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  My lord Sir Launcelot, it was a hapless <br>  Hour that ever we twain met together.<br>  I 'member me the day thou first didst come<br>  To Camelot and the jousts.  Ah, we were young--<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  And I did lack my sword and would have been shamed<br>  Hadst thou not brought it to me wrapped in thy robe.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  And I did see thee fight so strong and seemly.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  And I saw thee, Queen Guenevere, saw thee,<br>  Fairest among all women and all queens.<br>  And then as the rising moon looms like a white<br>  Fire from the world's edge, flaming into heaven,<br>  So burned up love through all my veins.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  And as the streams of Araby do nurse<br>  The myrtle flower, and the wind and the rain lead up<br>  Till it bursts with prisoned sweetness, so hath love<br>  Opened my heart.  And yet to-night have I <br>  Fears lest no good will come of it.<br>  How often have we made our promises,<br>  Made prayers to the cross that never more we fall<br>  In deadly sin--Alas, Sir Launcelot,<br>  An 'twere not for this earthly taint, thou hadst<br>  Succeeded in the quest.<br>  <br>  <i> (The sound of wind and distant thunder without.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Yea, madam, I had seen the Sangreal<br>  But for this stain to blot it from mine eyes.<br>  Once I saw a great clearness in a chamber,<br>  And in the midst a silver table held,<br>  Covered with red samite from my sight,<br>  The cup that bore the blessed blood of God,<br>  With many angels singing nigh.  And then<br>  The holy vessel of the Sangreal passed,<br>  And the fire smote me in the visage that <br>  I might not see, but only stand, my poor<br>  Eyes hungering, my nostrils filled with the sweet<br>  Savour round.  For never did I battle <br>  For God's sake, but only to win worship<br>  Or be better loved of thee.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Many a night--<br>  <br>  <i> (Thunder.  Guenevere goes to the window.)</i> <br>  <br>  The aspect of the heavens groweth perilous.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  How sweet is hearth and fellowship on such<br>  A night.  Together--<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Aye, frightened children cowering with dread.<br>  Hark to the bellowing elements!  Methinks<br>  'Tis all the wrath of the world met here to-night.<br>  Look how the wind heaves darkness past the window!<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Come from the lightning's reach.  'Tis well.  What was't?<br>  Many a night, thou saidst?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Many a night, Sir Launcelot, have I <br>  Lain in the castle of silence, when, slowly<br>  Dropping dew-like round the caves of sleep,<br>  Came dreams and separate lives.  And then I saw<br>  That other life our younger visions painted.<br>  Ah, one soul liveth many lives, my lord,<br>  During our days' short span.  Without this taint<br>  The purity of the court were still unbroke,<br>  And still unmarred were chivalry and worship.<br>  But from our love I fear me there will come<br>  Downfall and woe to many.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Grieve not thus o'ermuch.  Dost not know well<br>  God pardoneth all things sooner than despair?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Methought there must be holiness somehow<br>  When soul drinketh up soul for love.  Somehow--<br>  But since it may not be, we needs must grieve<br>  And make but mournful cheer.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Not so, for all the quest and hoped-for heaven!<br>  Surely God wearies of repentant wretches,<br>  And the prostrate flesh of wailing men cumbers<br>  The path of the world too much already.<br>  Let me stand up till I be dead, I cry,<br>  And if I sin I have eternity<br>  To bide the punishment.  I loved thee, thou<br>  Art near me--<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Beware!  Thou dost o'erleap thyself, as ever<br>  At the moment's heat.  Yet I do love thee sure<br>  No whit less that thou canst forget nice counsel<br>  In fond madness.  Reason speaks to reason<br>  But unto heart only the heart can speak.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Heart calleth heart.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  But who knows not man's heart is but Fate's tool.<br>  And somewhere in the depths of space our separate<br>  Fates call to each other through the void,<br>  And draw them near.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Let us not reck of Fate!<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  And life sweeps by us like a wind of flame,<br>  While we do wait unseeing in the caverns<br>  Of Fate, like blind things in the sea-caves.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Alas, why looms the shade of Fate thus on thee?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  I heard strange stories long ago amid<br>  The leaping shadows of my father's hearth<br>  And sea-howls echoed from the haunted crags,<br>  And oft the dreaded of my Danish forebears,<br>  Wyrd, great goddess of Fate, hath loomed on me,<br>  Hath beckoned out of her marble mist, O Christ,<br>  And I draw on but cannot read her face.<br>  And 'yond her sitteth Darkness in the road.<br>  O God, if Fate be in thy hand, let her<br>  Not come upon me yet!<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Nay, nay, thou art o'erwrought--who knows but I <br>  May drive Fate back from thee with might of love?<br>  Man's will is half his destiny.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  She hath loved long the nations of the North,<br>  Sea-king and thane, how if she wait their daughter?<br>  How if e'en now she smote me from the sun?<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Thou'rt rapt!<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Lo, at the window there, 'tis she!<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  'Tis what?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Wyrd!

To lose a noble friend <br>  Is like a loss of the dear life, is such <br>  A loss; for a man's friends are his life.<br>  Go slow, a day may show the evil, but<br>  The time is longer that makes manifest<br>  The good.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Doth baneful Fate will thus that we must see<br>  To understand, be blind to act?  Oh, would<br>  That I were blind in this.  For well I know<br>  That now indeed is my whole kingdom mischieved.<br>  <br>  <i> (Cries without.)</i> <br>  <br>  There will be war, Sir Launcelot, now, 'twixt me<br>  And thee, thy blood and my blood, cruel strife,<br>  Tearing the vitals of this realm.  Mine arm<br>  Is powerless for seeing what will fall.<br>  Madam, I rejoice to see thee weep,<br>  'Twere best wept sooner when there was some boot<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Then I will out, willy nilly.  King Arthur,<br>  I own the debt I owe to thee, for thou<br>  Didst give me knighthood, and of thee<br>  Have I had honour and much worship.  Yet<br>  In all thy quarrels have I lent what aid<br>  I might in thy behalf, shoulder and heart<br>  Have been thine, buckler and helm and sword,<br>  Vassal and steed, been thine.  Nor have I cast<br>  Green eyes of envy on thy station, nor<br>  Champed a restive bit, hearing thy fame<br>  Exalted, as have some nearer of kin<br>  To thee, I name them not.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Why do ye glare on my nephew Mordred?<br>  But 'tis naught.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  But I did add<br>  Ever what inches I might unto thy stature.<br>  In all thy heat thou canst not yet forget<br>  How many a venture have we had together<br>  Of joy or woe.  Therefore, my lord, for this<br>  Old brotherhood, I pray thee think on me,<br>  And judge not rashly.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Yea, truly must I think on thee, yea, truly,<br>  Bitter or sweet, still must I think on thee.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Nay, think what thou wilt then, on my soul I care<br>  Not.  I cannot sit as thou and weigh<br>  Vantage 'gainst vantage, and knit prudence up,<br>  Search whether't be good or bad or what,<br>  Teach mine eyes to rob their sockets of flight,<br>  And stop mine ears with silence.  'Tis fitter work<br>  For hermits and white hairs, not men.  I know<br>  No honied speech nor do I value aught<br>  The slippered dalliance of the favoured few,<br>  But strike with this arm what harmeth me or them<br>  I love.  'Tis many times I championed her<br>  Whilst thou sat dreaming high emprise or plan<br>  To win wide rumour for thy name.

Either<br>  Way is dangerous.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Nay, hear ye this, if she stay not as queen,<br>  She shall not stay at all.<br>  <br>  <i> Bors</i> <br>  Yea, think ye we will let the queen be burnt?<br>  <br>  <i> Urre</i> <br>  To arms for the queen!<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Silence!<br>  <br>  <i> Cries</i> <br>  To arms, to arms!

'Tis well!<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Lords and vassals of this island realm<br>  Hear me speak.  I will say briefly and<br>  Have done.  My lords, I am a woman, whom<br>  The gods built bigger than their wonted mould,<br>  Wilder, more diverse, waging fiercer war<br>  And conflict 'twixt the good and evil.  He<br>  That hath pinions larger than the common flight<br>  Must needs take greater pains lest they be sullied.<br>  My lord Arthur, I have ever loved<br>  Thee since I came from Cameliard,<br>  My father's land, loved thee as men love saints.<br>  Not with the petty pulsing of the veins,<br>  Nor jealousies nor heat of mad desire,<br>  But at the topmost of my soul's bent.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Is that the love men ask of women--good men?<br>  I know not.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Since thou'rt ideal, they that love thee love<br>  Thee as a mystic symbol, or a bodied <br>  Soul of some dear thing, not as frail man.<br>  Thou hast not known the low brown earth, nor it<br>  Known thee.  So wast thou ever loved, and so<br>  Thou hast loved me, however much thou'st loved.<br>  For thou knowst well, my lord, this is no husband's<br>  Nor no lover's jealousy that moves<br>  Thee in this sifting trial thus, but is<br>  The jealous eye the king bends on the crystal<br>  Perfectness of his long-dreamed-of court.<br>  Thy kingdom is thy spouse, my lord, not I.<br>  I fear I speak o'erboldly.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Nay, 'tis no matter.  Speak.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Then, ah, then--<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Well, well, then--?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  I have loved Sir Launcelot too.  All the pomp <br>  And glory of this world, of sights and sound,<br>  Of summer air and downs of May, of stars<br>  And white dawn leaping over dewy fields,<br>  Of life and love and the little moods men know,<br>  And bossed arms, and chivalry, and jousts,<br>  Of blood and wild, unquenchable revenge,<br>  Of bowers drunk with music and sweet sound,<br>  All this my woman's heart hath found to love<br>  In him, Sir Launcelot.  So have I loved<br>  You both, but differently.  Methinks that God<br>  Hath placed in me such high, opposing tides<br>  That if my soul be shipwrecked he could blame<br>  Me not.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Madam, me seemeth 'twas all love with you.<br>  Were there not other things stirring at court?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  The diverse uses of the world make men<br>  Take love only as a part of the whole <br>  Existence, but women--as a jewel liveth<br>  By the light, so live women by love.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Haply.  And now?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Now--I speak not for the din.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  What if ye be our queen no longer?<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Go with me, thou shalt go with me, my lady!<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Queen no more!<br>  <br>  <i> Cries</i> <br>  With Launcelot!  Queen no more!  With Launcelot!<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Nay, nay, not Launcelot, let that have done.<br>  Steal thou my crown, I go not hence with him<br>  To Joyous Garde, to be his love.  Nay, nay.<br>  I will not so.  Sure life turneth bitter<br>  In the cup, and I must dash it from me.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Where wilt thou turn if thou art queen no longer?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  If he rescue me hence, know ye 'twill be <br>  To the sisters by Boscastle.  There shall I <br>  Be buried from this world, and let my soul<br>  Crowd with its persons my life's stage.  But if<br>  I bide here--<br>  <br>  <i> Cries</i> <br>  Thou'lt burn!  Treason!  <i> (Confusion.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Aye, leave your howling, poor lean curs,<br>  Fattened with this man's collops.  Ah!  Sir Mordred,<br>  Why hast thou been so keen to fill black sails?<br>  Art thou the giant Jubaunce or Goliath?<br>  For I know well who set these on--<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Madam, I pray thee, I am all for peace.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Yea, very like,--my lord Arthur, look--<br>  Thy dove of peace hath need of armour plate<br>  Beneath his quills.<br>  <br>  <i> (She tears off Mordred's cloak.  He stands in his breastplate.)</i> <br>  <br>  Ah, cowards have ever need of steel.  I leave<br>  Thee now to the kind leeches, they will suck<br>  Thy veins dry to a drop.  But who am I <br>  That speak?  <i> (She starts out.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Nay, madam, nay, God's life, nay, dost think--?<br>  Stay, thy cause must still be tried.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Queen no more.  Aye, I have had my hour.<br>  This hour my life hath spoken in full tone.<br>  No more I strive in the world, for I am ashamed<br>  Enough of men already.  May I not<br>  Go hence?  I am all undone methinks.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  'Tis I speak for her.  Sir, what man shall judge her?<br>  My lord kinsmen, close round.<br>  <br>  <i> (The kinsmen surround the queen.

I have heard it oft at court,<br>  At Pentecost, my lord, dost thou remember?<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Nay, I know not, madam, that time is gone.<br>  And now farewell, I may not tarry, fare<br>  Thee well.  I know of thee and me that each<br>  Shall not see other ever more with fleshly eye.<br>  And now I must needs hasten and depart<br>  Back to Camelot and the court and strife.<br>  But afterward shall sail to Avalon,<br>  And change my life from this world.<br>  <br>  <i> (From the chapel come the voices of the nuns singing matins.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Not meet again?<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  No mortal meeting.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Alas!<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Nay, madam, nay, haply thou mayest <br>  Be queen, when all the goodly knights I lost<br>  In diverse quests and ventures will awake<br>  From their long sleep, and form in heaven again<br>  The King's Round Table, perfect at last, and there<br>  With shining arms will joust in Christ's fair courts<br>  For diamonds like suns and carcanets<br>  Of little stars.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Ah, God, all the gall of the world takes not<br>  The dreamer from his dreaming!

The sun sank and the slim<br>  Moon lifted her pale beauty into heaven,<br>  And dome and turret glittered in the light.<br>  Then Mary the Mother of God came and took<br>  My hand, and her voice fell sweet upon my weary<br>  Ear--<br>  <br>  <i> Morwena</i> <br>  Speak to her, boy.<br>  <br>  <i> Dagonet</i> <br>  Alas, I may not for looking on her face!<br>  Hark, there is the nightingale, my lady, Look!<br>  Too--the moon riseth!<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  The moon--<br>  <br>  <i> Dagonet</i> <br>  The moon like a white flame in the trees, like liquid<br>  Silver in among the leaves.

Oh, my lady!  the moon!<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Distantly rose Camelot out<br>  Of the silver plain.<br>  <br>  <i> Dagonet</i> <br>  And the nightingales--<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Aye, all the nightingales in Cameliard<br>  Cannot sing my woes, nor every bird<br>  That sings his tragic plaints of passionate<br>  Mischance can wail my sorrows.<br>  <br>  <i> Morwena</i> <br>  Nay, madam, sit, thou hast not strength to stand.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  I was a woman and I needed love,<br>  I was a queen to long for courts about,<br>  Strong lords and ladies and gay raiment.<br>  I am a weary human thing that needeth<br>  Rest.

And thou?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Thou seest I have found peace.<br>  In Fraunce this twelvemonth gone?<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  When the sly Mordred bore an open front,<br>  With vassals and kinsmen I had saved the king<br>  But he would have it not.

And well<br>  As I have loved thee, I may not see thee<br>  Again, for now mine eye it turneth not<br>  To the worldward but to God, for my soul's health<br>  Lest I be damned.<br>  <br>  <i> Dagonet</i> <br>  My lady, there be worse than thou now saints<br>  In heaven.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Thou art o'erfond, child.  Then, Sir Launcelot,<br>  Much as I have loved thee, for Christ's sake I may <br>  Not see thee.  Therefore I pray that thou<br>  Depart; and pray for me--<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  I have come far to see thee, but I will<br>  Not trouble thee, poor lady, with fond words.<br>  Sithence thou'lt have it so, I go, yet I <br>  Sail never on the sea to Fraunce again<br>  But to a hermitage, and make my prayers<br>  For thy soul's rest and mine.  I pray thee then,<br>  Before I go, madam, kiss me once<br>  And nevermore.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Nay, that may I never do--<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Farewell.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  And for our old love's sake, Sir Launcelot,<br>  Do this; when I am dead, come thou with seven <br>  Knights, and carry me to Glastonbury<br>  Where my lord Arthur lieth.

The wood is dark and, save for a rustle of the leafage now and then, silent.  Presently there comes a light through the trees, which heightens and brightens.  The tramp of footsteps is heard growing gradually louder.  Sir Launcelot and his seven knights enter with the queen's bier on their shoulders, and eight torches burning about her.  Her head rests on a cushion, and on her breast is her crown.  A pall of black samite bordered with gold lilies covers her body.  The knights turn in behind a rocky mound, then reappear among the trees.  Then as they go, every now and then, their torches flash further and further away, smaller and smaller points of light amid the columns of the wood, till the last twinkle is gone and the blackness returns.</i> <br> <br>  <center><br> <br> CURTAIN
