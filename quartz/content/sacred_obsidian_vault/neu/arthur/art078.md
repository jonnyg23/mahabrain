But Sir Tray<br>  Stirred not nor breathed: thereat, alarmed, she seized<br>  And drew the hinder leg: the carcase moved<br>  All over wooden like a piece of wood--<br>  "Dead?" said the Dame, while louder wailed Elaine;<br>  "I see," she said, "thy fasts were all too long,<br>  Thy commons all too short, which shortened thus<br>  Thy days, tho' thou mightst still have cheered mine age<br>  Had I but timelier to the city wonned.<br>  Thither I must again, and that right soon,<br>  For now 'tis meet we lap thee in a shroud,<br>  And lay thee in the vault by Astolat,<br>  Where faithful Tray shall by Sir Hubbard lie."<br>  <br>     Up a by-lane the Undertaker dwelt;<br>  There day by day he plied his merry trade,<br>  And all his undertakings undertook:<br>  Erst knight of Arthur's Court, Sir Waldgrave hight,<br>  A gruesome carle who hid his jests in gloom,<br>  And schooled his lid to counterfeit a tear.<br>  With cheerful hammer he a coffin tapt,<br>  While hollow, hollow, hollow, rang the wood,<br>  And, as he sawed and hammered, thus he sang:<br>  <br>  Wood, hammer, nails, ye build a house for him,<br>  Nails, hammer, wood, ye build a house for me,<br>  Paying the rent, the taxes, and the rates.<br>  <br>  I plant a human acorn in the ground,<br>  And therefrom straightway springs a goodly tree,<br>  Budding for me in bread and beer and beef.<br>  <br>  O Life, dost thou bring Death or Death bring thee?<br>  Which of the twain is bringer, which the brought?<br>  Since men must die that other men may live.<br>  <br>  O Death, for me thou plump'st thine hollow cheeks,<br>  Mak'st of thine antic grin a pleasant smile,<br>  And prank'st full gaily in thy winding-sheet.<br>  <br>     This ditty sang he to a doleful tune<br>  To outer ears that sounded like a dirge,<br>  Or wind that wails across the fields of death.<br>  'Ware of a visitor, he ceased his strain,<br>  But still did ply his saw industrious.<br>  With withered hand on ear, Dame Hubbard stood;<br>  "Vex not mine ears," she grated, "with thine old<br>  And creaking saw!" "I deemed," he said, and sighed,<br>  "Old saws might please thee, as they should the wise."<br>  "Know," said the Dame, "Sir Tray that with me dwelt<br>  Lies on my lonely hearthstone stark and stiff;<br>  Wagless the tail that waved to welcome me."--<br>  Here Waldgrave interposed sepulchral tones,<br>  "Oft have I noted, when the jest went round,<br>  Sad 'twas to see the wag forget his tale--<br>  Sadder to see the tail forget its wag."<br>  "Wherefore," resumed she, "take of fitting stuff,<br>  And make therewith a narrow house for him."<br>  Quoth he, "From yonder deal I'll plane the bark,<br>  So 'twill of Tray be emblematical;<br>  For thou, 'tis plain, must lose a deal of bark,<br>  Since he nor bark nor bite shall practise more."<br>  "And take thou, too," she said, "a coffin-plate,<br>  And be his birth and years inscribed thereon<br>  With letters twain 'S.T.' to mark Sir Tray,<br>  So shall the tomb be known in after-time."<br>  "This too," quoth Waldgrave, "shall be deftly done;<br>  Oft hath the plate been freighted with his bones,<br>  But now his bones must lie beneath the plate."<br>  "Jest'st thou?" Dame Hubbard said, and clutched her crutch,<br>  For ill she brooked light parlance of the dead;<br>  But when she saw Sir Waldgrave, how his face<br>  Was all drawn downward, till the curving mouth<br>  Seemed a horseshoe, while o'er the furrowed cheek,<br>  A wandering tear stole on, like rivulet<br>  In dry ravine down mother Ida's side,<br>  She changed her purpose, smote not, lowered the staff;--<br>  So parted, faring homeward with her grief.<br>  <br>     Nearing her bower, it seemed a sepulchre<br>  Sacred to memory, and almost she thought<br>  A dolorous cry arose, as if Elaine<br>  Did sound a caterwauling requiem.<br>  With hesitating hand she raised the latch,<br>  And on the threshold with reluctant foot<br>  Lingered, as loath to face the scene of woe,<br>  When lo! the body lay not on the hearth,<br>  For there Elaine her flying tail pursued,--<br>  In the Dame's chair Sir Tray alive did sit,<br>  A world of merry meaning in his eye,<br>  And all his face agrin from ear to ear.<br>  <br>     Like one who late hath lost his dearest friend,<br>  And in his sleep doth see that friend again,<br>  And marvels scarce to see him, putting forth<br>  A clasping hand, and feels him warm with life,<br>  And so takes up his friendship's broken thread--<br>  Thus stood the Dame, thus ran she, pattering o'er<br>  The sanded tiles, and clasped she thus Sir Tray,<br>  Unheeding of the grief his jest had wrought<br>  For joy he was not numbered with the dead.<br>  <br>     Anon the Dame, her primal transports o'er,<br>  Bethought her of the wisdom of Sir Tray,<br>  And his fine wit, and then it shameful seemed<br>  That he bareheaded 'neath the sky should go<br>  While empty skulls of fools went thatched and roofed;<br>  "A hat," she cried, "would better fit those brows<br>  Than many a courtier's that I've wotted of;<br>  And thou shalt have one, an' my tender toes<br>  On which the corns do shoot, and these my knees<br>  Wherethro' rheumatic twinges swiftly dart,<br>  Will bear me to the city yet again,<br>  And thou shalt wear the hat as Arthur wore<br>  The Dragon of the great Pendragonship."<br>  Whereat Sir Tray did seem to smile, and smote<br>  Upon the chair-back with approving tail.<br>  <br>     Then up she rose, and to the Hatter's went,--<br>  "Hat me," quoth she, "your very newest hat;"<br>  And so they hatted her, and she returned<br>  Home through the darksome wold, and raised the latch,<br>  And marked, full lighted by the ingle-glow,<br>  Sir Tray, with spoon in hand, and cat on knee,<br>  Spattering the mess about the chaps of Puss.<br>
