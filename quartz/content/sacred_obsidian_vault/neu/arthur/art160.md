<sup> 1</sup> <br>  What vision hast thou seen?"<br>  But Galahad throws his garland down:<br>  "O king, O knights, no monk am I;<br>  Nor yet, my queen, a shepherd-clown;<br>  In wanderings 'neath the open sky<br>  Mine idle days were spent.<br>  <br>  "In grassy ways I set my feet;<br>  I tuned mine ears to chirp and bleat;<br>  I saw a sickle-moon at birth<br>  Over the young green what.<br>  I sate among the kindly beasts<br>  And knew them seasonably glad;<br>  Of balsam-herbs I made my feasts;<br>  A happier man than Galahad<br>  Was never seen on earth.<br>  <br>  "My heart was glad for that I knew<br>  The fallen bole had greened anew,<br>  And sucking things were glad and mad<br>  And gambolled in the dew;<br>  For when new leaves come round the bole,<br>  And every beast hath young unto her,<br>  O king, within the loneliest soul<br>  Are silent place all in flower!"<br>  Answereth Galahad.<br>  <br>  "Shame!  shame!"  cry then the Table Round,<br>  "What!  never a blow, and never a wound?<br>  And never a holy image kissed<br>  In crypts beneath the ground?"<br>  Saith Galahad:  "I think no shame;<br>  The story of the Lord of all<br>  When first on Christmas night He came<br>  Beginneth with a pastoral:<br>  Even your captain, Christ.<br>  <br>  "Have ye not heard of ass and ox<br>  That warmed the stable in the rocks?<br>  Have ye not read of them that kept<br>  Night-watches o'er their flocks?<br>  And shall His humble virgin knight<br>  With herds and shepherds scorn to dwell,<br>  If He who leads all heaven's might<br>  To battle with the crews of hell,<br>  By beasts of burden slept?<br>  <br>  "I am not less a soldier sealed,<br>  Because in life of tilth and field<br>  I saw the light, I heard the call,<br>  That God Himself revealed.<br>  But king, hast thou a perilous quest,<br>  And would'st thou doubt which knight to send?<br>  Mine arm is strong, my heart at rest--<br>  Behold the man!"<br>                           Here hath an end<br>  Sir Galahad's pastoral. <hr>  <a> <b> 1</b>   The text reads <i> feasted</i> , but <i> fasted</i>  is obviously intended. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
