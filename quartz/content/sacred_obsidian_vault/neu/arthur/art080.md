HAWKER</h2>  </center>  <br>  The name Sangraal is derived from <i> San</i> , the breviate of <i> Sanctus</i>  or Saint, <i> Holy</i> , and <i> Graal</i> , the Keltic word for Vessel or Vase.  All that is known of the Origin and History of this mysterious Relique will be rehearsed in the Poem itself.  As in the title, so in the Knightly Names, I have preferred the Keltic to other sources of spelling and sound.--R.S.H.
 <p>  <br> Ho! for the Sangraal! vanish'd Vase of Heaven!<br> That held, like Christ's own heart, an hin [1] of blood!<br> Ho! for the Sangraal! . . .<br> 			How the merry shout<br> Of reckless riders on their rushing steeds,<br> Smote the loose echo from the drowsy rock<br> Of grim Dundagel, thron'd along the sea!<br> <br> "Unclean! unclean! ten cubits and a span, [2]<br> Keep from the wholesome touch of human-kind:<br> Stand at the gate, and beat the leper's bell,<br> But stretch not forth the hand for holy thing,--<br> Unclean, as Egypt at the ebb of Nile!"<br> Thus said the monk, a lean and gnarlèd man;<br> <br> His couch was on the rock, by that wild stream<br> That floods, in cataract, Saint Nectan's Kieve: [3]<br> One of the choir, whose life is Orison.<br> They had their lodges in the wilderness,<br> Or built them cells beside the shadowy sea,<br> And there they dwelt with angels, like a dream:<br> So they unroll'd the volume of the Book,<br> And fill'd the fields of the Evangelist<br> With antique thoughts, that breath'd of Paradise.<br> <br> Uprose they for the Quest--the bounding men<br> Of the siege perilous, and the granite ring--<br> They gathered at the rock, yon ruddy tor; [4]<br> The stony depth where lurked the demon-god,<br> Till Christ, the mighty Master, drave him forth.<br> <br> There stood the knights, stately, and stern, and tall;<br> Tristan, and Perceval, Sir Galahad,<br> And he, the sad Sir Lancelot of the lay:<br> Ah me! that logan [5] of the rocky hills,<br> Pillar'd in storm, calm in the rush of war,<br> Shook, at the light touch of his lady's hand!<br> <br> See! where they move, a battle-shouldering kind!<br> Massive in mould, but graceful: thorough men:<br> Built in the mystic measure of the Cross:--<br> Their lifted arms the transome: and their bulk,<br> The Tree, where Jesu stately stood to die--<br> Thence came their mastery in the field of war:--<br> Ha! one might drive battalions--one, alone!<br> <br> See! now, they pause; for in their midst, the King,<br> Arthur, the Son of Uter, and the Night,<br> Helm'd with Pendragon, with the crested Crown,<br> And belted with the sheath'd Excalibur, [6]<br> That gnash'd his iron teeth, and yearn'd for war!<br> Stern was that look (high natures seldom smile)<br> And in those pulses beat a thousand kings.<br> A glance! and they were husht: a lifted hand!<br> And his eye ruled them like a throne of light.<br> Then, with a voice that rang along the moor,<br> Like the Archangel's trumpet for the dead,<br> He spake--while Tamar sounded to the sea.<br> <br> "Comrades in arms!  Mates of The Table Round!<br> Fair Sirs, my fellows in the bannered ring,<br> Ours is a lofty tryst! this day we meet,<br> Not under shield, with scarf and knightly gage,<br> To quench our thirst of love in ladies' eyes:<br> We shall not mount to-day that goodly throne,<br> The conscious steed, with thunder in his loins,<br> To launch along the field the arrowy spear:<br> Nay, but a holier theme, a mightier Quest--<br> 'Ho! for the Sangraal, vanish'd Vase of God!'<br> <br> "Ye know that in old days, that yellow Jew,<br> Accursèd Herod; and the earth-wide judge,<br> Pilate the Roman--doomster for all lands,<br> Or else the Judgment had not been for all,--<br> Bound Jesu-Master to the world's tall tree,<br> Slowly to die. . . .<br> 			Ha!  Sirs, had we been there,<br> They durst not have assayed their felon deed,<br> Excalibur had cleft them to the spine!<br> <br> Slowly He died, a world in every pang,<br> Until the hard centurion's cruel spear<br> Smote His high heart: and from that severed side,<br> Rush'd the red stream that quencht the wrath of Heaven!<br> <br> "Then came Sir Joseph, hight of Arimathèe,<br> Bearing that awful Vase, the Sangraal!<br> The Vessel of the Pasch, Shere Thursday night,<br> The selfsame Cup, wherein the faithful Wine<br> Heard God, and was obedient unto Blood.<br> Therewith he knelt and gathered blessèd drops<br> From his dear Master's Side that sadly fell,<br> The ruddy dews from the great tree of life:<br> Sweet Lord! what treasures! like the priceless gems<br> Hid in the tawny casket of a king,--<br> A ransom for an army, one by one!<br> <br> "That wealth he cherisht long: his very soul<br> Around his ark: bent as before a shrine!<br> <br> "He dwelt in Orient Syria: God's own land:<br> The ladder foot of heaven--where shadowy shapes<br> In white appparel glided up and down.<br> His home was like a garner, full of corn,<br> And wine and oil; a granary of God!<br> Young men, that no one knew, went in and out,<br> With a far look in their eternal eyes!<br> All things were strange and rare: the Sangraal,<br> As though it clung to some ethereal chain,<br> Brought down high Heaven to earth at Arimathèe.<br> <br> "He lived long centuries and prophesied.<br> A girded pilgrim ever and anon,<br> Cross-staff in hand, and, folded at his side,<br> The mystic marvel of the feast of blood!<br> Once, in old time, he stood in this dear land,<br> Enthrall'd--for lo! a sign! his grounded staff<br> Took root, and branch'd, and bloom'd, like Aaron's rod:<br> Thence came the shrine, the cell; therefore he dwelt,<br> The vassal of the Vase, at Avalon!<br> <br> "This could not last, for evil days came on,<br> And evil men: the garbage of their sin<br> Tainted this land, and all things holy fled.<br> The Sangraal was not: on a summer eve,<br> The silence of the sky brake up in sound!<br> The tree of Joseph glowed with ruddy light:<br> A harmless fire, curved like a molten vase,<br> Around the bush, and from the midst, a voice:<br> Thus hewn by Merlin on a runic stone:--<br> <b> Kirioth : el : Zannah : aulohee : pedah :</b> <br> <br> "Then said the shuddering seer--he heard and knew<br> The unutterable words that glide in Heaven,<br> Without a breath or tongue, from soul to soul--<br> <br> "'The land is lonely now: Anathema!<br> The link that bound it to the silent grasp<br> Of thrilling worlds is gathered up and gone:<br> The glory is departed; and the disk<br> So full of radiance from the touch of God!<br> This orb is darkened to the distant watch<br> Of Saturn and his reapers, when they pause,<br> Amid their sheaves, to count the nightly stars.<br> <br> "'All gone! but not for ever: on a day<br> There shall rise a king from Keltic loins,<br> Of mystic birth and name, tender and true;<br> His vassals shall be noble, to a man:<br> Knights strong in battle till the war is won:<br> Then while the land is husht on Tamar side,<br> So that the warder upon Carradon<br> Shall hear at once the river and the sea--<br> That king shall call a Quest: a kindling cry:<br> 'Ho! for the Sangraal! vanish'd Vase of God!'<br> <br> "'Yea! and it shall be won!  A chosen knight,<br> The ninth from Joseph in the line of blood,<br> Clean as a maid from guile and fleshly sin--<br> He with the shield of Sarras; [7] and the lance,<br> Ruddy and moisten'd with a freshening stain,<br> As from a sever'd wound of yesterday--<br> He shall achieve the Graal: he alone!'"<br> <br> "Thus wrote Bard Merlin on the Runic hide<br> Of a slain deer: rolled in an aumry chest.<br> <br> "And now, fair Sirs, your voices: who will gird<br> His belt for travel in the perilous ways?<br> This thing must be fulfilled:--in vain our land<br> Of noble name, high deed, and famous men;<br> Vain the proud homage of our thrall, the sea,<br> If we be shorn of God.  Ah! loathsome shame!<br> To hurl in battle for the pride of arms:<br> To ride in native tournay, foreign war:<br> To count the stars; to ponder pictured runes,<br> And grasp great knowledge, as the demons do,<br> If we be shorn of God:--we must assay<br> The myth and meaning of this marvellous bowl:<br> It shall be sought and found:--"<br> 				Thus said the King.<br> <br> Then rose a storm of voices; like the sea,<br> When Ocean, bounding, shouts with all his waves.<br> High-hearted men! the purpose and the theme,<br> Smote the fine chord that thrills the warrior's soul<br> With touch and impulse for a deed of fame.<br> <br> Then spake Sir Gauvain, counsellor of the King,<br> A man of Pentecost for words that burn:--<br> <br> "Sirs! we are soldiers of the rock and ring:<br> Our Table Round is earth's most honoured stone;<br> Thereon two worlds of life and glory blend,<br> The boss upon the shield of many a land,<br> The midway link with the light beyond the stars!<br> This is our fount of fame!  Let us arise,<br> And cleave the earth like rivers; like the streams<br> That win from Paradise their immortal name:<br> To the four winds of God, casting the lot.<br> So shall we share the regions, and unfold<br> The shrouded mystery of those fields of air.<br> <br> "Eastward! the source and spring of life and light!<br> Thence came, and thither went, the rush of worlds,<br> When the great cone of space [8] was sown with stars.<br> There rolled the gateway of the double dawn,<br> When the mere God shone down, a breathing man.<br> There, up from Bethany, the Syrian Twelve<br> Watched their dear Master darken into day.<br> Thence, too, will gleam the Cross, the arisen wood: [9]<br> Ah, shuddering sign, one day, of terrible doom!<br> Therefore the Orient is the home of God.<br> <br> "The West! a Galilee: the shore of men;<br> The symbol and the scene of populous life:<br> Full Japhet journeyed thither, Noe's son,<br> The prophecy of increase in his loins.<br> Westward [10] Lord Jesu looked His latest love,<br> His yearning Cross along the peopled sea,<br> The innumerable nations in His soul.<br> Thus came that type and token of our kind,<br> The realm and region of the set of sun,<br> The wide, wide West; the imaged zone of man.<br> <br> "The North! the lair of demons, where they coil,<br> And bound, and glide, and travel to and fro:<br> Their gulph, the underworld, this hollow orb,<br> Where vaulted columns curve beneath the hills,<br> And shoulder us on their arches: there they throng;<br> The portal of their pit, the polar gate,<br> Their fiery dungeon mocked with northern snow:<br> There, doom and demon haunt a native land,<br> Where dreamy thunder mutters in the cloud,<br> Storm broods, and battle breathes, and baleful fires<br> Shed a fierce horror o'er the shuddering North.<br> <br> "But thou! O South Wind, breathe thy fragrant sigh!<br> We follow on thy perfume, breath of heaven!<br> Myriads, in girded albs, for ever young,<br> Their stately semblance of embodied air,<br> Troop round the footstool of the Southern Cross,<br> That pentacle of stars: the very sign<br> That led the Wise Men towards the Awful Child,<br> Then came and stood to rule the peaceful sea.<br> So, too, Lord Jesu from His mighty tomb [11]<br> Cast the dear shadow of his red right hand,<br> To soothe the happy South--the angels' home.<br> <br> "Then let us search the regions, one by one,<br> And pluck this Sangraal from its cloudy cave."<br> <br> So Merlin brought the arrows: graven lots,<br> Shrouded from sight within a quiver'd sheath,<br> For choice and guidance in the perilous path,<br> That so the travellers might divide the lands.<br> They met at Lauds, in good Saint Nectan's cell,<br> For fast, and vigil, and their knightly vow:<br> Then knelt, and prayed, and all received their God.<br> <br> "Now for the silvery arrows!  Grasp and hold!"<br> <br> Sir Lancelot drew the North: that fell domain,<br> Where fleshly man must brook the airy fiend--<br> His battle-foe, the demon--ghastly War!<br> Ho! stout Saint Michael shield them, knight and knave!<br> <br> The South fell softly to Sir Perceval's hand:<br> Some shadowy angel breathed a silent sign,<br> That so that blameless man, that courteous knight,<br> Might mount and mingle with the happy host<br> Of God's white army in their native land.<br> Yea! they shall woo and soothe him, like the dove.<br> <br> But hark! the greeting--"Tristan for the West!"<br> Among the multitudes, his watchful way,<br> The billowy hordes beside the seething sea;<br> But will the glory gleam in loathsome lands?<br> Will the lost pearl shine out among the swine?<br> Woe, father Adam, to thy loins and thee!<br> <br> Sir Galahad holds the Orient arrow's name:<br> His chosen hand unbars the gate of day;<br> There glows that heart, fill'd with his mother's blood,<br> That rules in every pulse, the world of man;<br> Link of the awful Three, with many a star.<br> O! blessèd East!

O Jesu! let me drink and die!</b> <br> <br> So forth they fare, King Arthur and his men,<br> Like stout quaternions of the Maccabee:<br> They halt, and form at craggy Carradon;<br> Fit scene for haughty hope and stern farewell.<br> Lo! the rude altar, and the rough-hewn rock,<br> The grim and ghastly semblance of the fiend,<br> His haunt and coil within that pillar'd home.<br> Hark! the wild echo!  Did the demon breathe<br> That yell of vengeance from the conscious stone?<br> <br> There the brown barrow curves its sullen breast,<br> Above the bones of some dead Gentile's soul:<br> All husht--and calm--and cold--until anon<br> Gleams the old dawn--the well-remembered day--<br> Then may you hear, beneath that hollow cairn,<br> The clash of arms: the muffled shout of war;<br> Blent with the rustle of the kindling dead!<br> <br> They stand--and hush their hearts to hear the King.<br> Then said he, like a prince of Tamar-land--<br> Around his soul, Dundagel and the sea--<br> <br> "Ha! Sirs--ye seek a noble crest to-day,<br> To win and wear the starry Sangraal,<br> The link that binds to God a lonely land.<br> Would that my arm went with you, like my heart!<br> But the true shepherd must not shun the fold:<br> For in this flock are crouching grievous wolves,<br> And chief among them all, my own false kin.<br> Therefore I tarry by the cruel sea,<br> To hear at eve the treacherous mermaid's song,<br> And watch the wallowing monsters of the wave,--<br> 'Mid all things fierce, and wild, and strange, alone!<br> <br> "Ay! all beside can win companionship:<br> The churl may clip his mate beneath the thatch,<br> While his brown urchins nestle at his knees:<br> The soldier give and grasp a mutual palm,<br> Knit to his flesh in sinewy bonds of war:<br> The knight may seek at eve his castle-gate,<br> Mount the old stair, and lift the accustom'd latch,<br> To find, for throbbing brow and weary limb,<br> That paradise of pillows, one true breast:<br> But he, the lofty ruler of the land,<br> Like yonder Tor, first greeted by the dawn,<br> And wooed the latest by the lingering day,<br> With happy homes and hearths beneath his breast,<br> Must soar and gleam in solitary snow.<br> The lonely one is, evermore, the King.<br> So now farewell, my lieges, fare ye well,<br> And God's sweet Mother be your benison!<br> Since by grey Merlin's gloss, this wondrous cup<br> Is, like the golden vase in Aaron's ark,<br> A fount of manha for a yearning world,<br> As full as it can hold of God and heaven,<br> Search the four winds until the balsam breathe,<br> Then grasp, and fold it in your very soul!<br> <br> "I have no son, no daughter of my loins,<br> To breathe, 'mid future men, their father's name:<br> My blood will perish when these veins are dry;<br> Yet am I fain some deeds of mine should live--<br> I would not be forgotten in this land:<br> I yearn that men I know not, men unborn,<br> Should find, amid these fields, King Arthur's fame!<br> Here let them say, by proud Dundagel's walls--<br> 'They brought the Sangraal back by his command,<br> They touched these rugged rocks with hues of God:'<br> So shall my name have worship, and my land.<br> <br> "Ah! native Cornwall! throned upon the hills,<br> Thy moorland pathways worn by Angel feet,<br> Thy streams that march in music to the sea<br> 'Mid Ocean's merry noise, his billowy laugh!<br> Ah me! a gloom falls heavy on my soul--<br> The birds that sung to me in youth are dead;<br> I think, in dreamy vigils of the night,<br> It may be God is angry with my land,<br> Too much athirst for fame, too fond of blood;<br> And all for earth, for shadows, and the dream<br> To glean an echo from the winds of song!<br> <br> "But now, let hearts be high! the Archangel held<br> A tournay with the fiend on Abarim,<br> And good Saint Michael won his dragon-crest!<br> <br> "Be this our cry! the battle is for God!<br> If bevies of foul fiends withstand your path,<br> Nay! if strong angels hold the watch and ward,<br> Plunge in their midst, and shout, 'A Sangraal!'"<br> <br> He ceased; the warriors bent a knightly knee,<br> And touched, with kiss and sign, Excalibur;<br> Then turned, and mounted for their perilous way!<br> <br> That night Dundagel shuddered into storm--<br> The deep foundations shook beneath the sea:<br> Yet there they stood, beneath the murky moon,<br> Above the bastion, Merlin and the King.<br> Thrice waved the sage his staff, and thrice they saw<br> A peopled vision throng the rocky moor.<br> <br> First fell a gloom, thick as a thousand nights,<br> A pall that hid whole armies; and beneath<br> Stormed the wild tide of war; until on high<br> Gleamed red the dragon, and the Keltic glaive<br> Smote the loose battle of the roving Dane!<br> Then yelled a fiercer fight: for brother blood<br> Rushed mingling, and twin dragons fought the field!<br> The grisly shadows of his faithful knights<br> Perplext their lord: and in their midst, behold!<br> His own stern semblance waved a phantom brand,<br> Drooped, and went down the war.  Then cried the King,<br> "Ho! Arthur to the rescue!" and half drew<br> Excalibur; but sank, and fell entranced.<br> <br> A touch aroused the monarch: and there stood<br> He, of the billowy beard and awful eye,<br> The ashes of whole ages on his brow--<br> Merlin the bard, son of a demon-sire!<br> High, like Ben Amram at the thirsty rock,<br> He raised his prophet staff: that runic rod,<br> The stem of Igdrasil [17]--the crutch of Raun--<br> And wrote strange words along the conscious air.<br> <br> Forth gleamed the east, and yet it was not day!<br> A white and glowing horse outrode the dawn;<br> A youthful rider ruled the bounding rein,<br> And he, in semblance of Sir Galahad shone:<br> A vase he held on high; one molten gem,<br> Like massive ruby or the chrysolite:<br> Thence gushed the light in flakes; and flowing, fell<br> As though the pavement of the sky brake up,<br> And stars were shed to sojourn on the hills,<br> From grey Morwenna's stone to Michael's tor,<br> Until the rocky land was like a heaven.<br> <br> Then saw they that the mighty Quest was won!<br> The Sangraal swoon'd along the golden air:<br> The sea breathed balsam, like Gennesaret:<br> The streams were touched with supernatural light:<br> And fonts of Saxon rock, stood, full of God!<br> Altars arose, each like a kingly throne,<br> Where the royal chalice, with its lineal blood,<br> The Glory of the Presence, ruled and reigned.<br> This lasted long: until the white horse fled,<br> The fierce fangs of the libbard in his loins:<br> Whole ages glided in that blink of time,<br> While Merlin and the King, looked, wondering, on.<br> <br> But see! once more the wizard-wand arise,<br> To cleave the air with signals, and a scene.<br> <br> Troops of the demon-north, in yellow garb,<br> The sickly hue of vile Iscariot's hair,<br> Mingle with men, in unseen multitudes!<br> Unscared, they throng the valley and the hill;<br> The shrines were darkened and the chalice void:<br> That which held God was gone: Maran-atha!<br> The awful shadows of the Sangraal, fled!<br> Yet giant-men arose, that seemed as gods,<br> Such might they gathered from the swarthy kind:<br> The myths were rendered up: and one by one,<br> The Fire--the Light--the Air--were tamed and bound<br> Like votive vassals at their chariot-wheel.<br> Then learnt they War: yet not that noble wrath,<br> That brings the generous champion face to face<br> With equal shield, and with a measured brand,<br> To peril life for life, and do or die;<br> But the false valour of the lurking fiend<br> To hurl a distant death from some deep den:<br> To wing with flame the metal of the mine:<br> And, so they rend God's image, reck not who!<br> <br> "Ah! haughty England! lady of the wave!"<br> Thus said pale Merlin to the listening King,<br> "What is thy glory in the world of stars?<br> To scorch and slay: to win demoniac fame,<br> In arts and arms; and then to flash and die!<br> Thou art the diamond of the demon-crown,<br> Smitten by Michael upon Abarim,<br> That fell; and glared, an island of the sea.<br> Ah! native England! wake thine ancient cry;<br> Ho! for the Sangraal! vanish'd Vase of Heaven,<br> That held, like Christ's own heart, an hin of blood!"<br> <br> He ceased; and all around was dreamy night:<br> There stood Dundagel, throned: and the great sea<br> Lay, a strong vassal at his master's gate,<br> And, like a drunken giant, sobb'd in sleep!<br> <br>  </p><hr>  <center><b> Author's Notes</b> </center>   <a> <b> 1</b>   The hin was a Hebrew measure, used for the wine of the sacrifice.<br> <br>  </a><a> <b> 2</b>   The distance at which a leper was commanded to keep from every healthy person.<br> <br>  </a><a> <b> 3</b>   Or cauldron.<br> <br>  </a><a> <b> 4</b>   Routor, the red hill, so named from the heath which blossoms on the hill-side.<br> <br>  </a><a> <b> 5</b>   Logan, or shuddering stone.

As time is <i> mensura motus</i> , so is space <i> mensura loci</i> ; and it signifies that part of God's presence which is measured out to enfold the planetary universe.  The tracery of its outline is a cone.  Every path of a planet is a curve of that conic figure: and as motion is the life of matter, the whirl of space in its allotted courses is the cause of that visible movement of the sun and the solar system towards the star Alcyone as the fixed centre in the cone of space.<br> <br>  </a><a> <b> 9</b>   The "Sign of the Son of Man," the signal of the last day, was understood, in the early ages, to denote the actual Cross of Calvary; which was to be miraculously recalled into existence, and, angel-borne, to announce the advent of the Lord in the sky.<br> <br>  </a><a> <b> 10</b>   Our Lord was crucified with His back towards the east: His face therefore was turned towards the west, which is always, in sacred symbolism, the region of the people.<br> <br>  </a><a> <b> 11</b>   Our Lord was laid in His sepulchre with His head towards the west: His right hand therefore gave symbolic greeting to the region of the south; as His left hand reproached and gave a fatal aspect to the north.<br> <br>  </a><a> <b> 12</b>   The golden-hill, from <i> brun</i> , "a hill" and <i> guillie</i> , "golden:" so called from the yellow gorse with which it is clothed.<br> <br>  </a><a> <b> 13</b>   This appropriate fondling of the knights of Dundagel moves Villemarque to write, "qui me plaise et me charme quand je le trouve couché aux pieds d'Ivan, le mufle allongé sur ses deux pattes croisées, les yeux à demi-ouvert et revant."<br> <br>  </a><a> <b> 14</b>   See Borlase, bk. iii, ch. iii for "Karn-idzek:" touched by the moon at some weird hour of the night, it hooted with oracular sound.<br> <br>  </a><a> <b> 15</b>   Cain and his dog: Dante's version of the man in the moon was a thought of the old simplicity of primeval days.<br> <br>  </a><a> <b> 16</b>   When the cone of space had been traced out and defined, the next act of creation was to replenish it with that first and supernatural element which I have named 'Numyne.'
