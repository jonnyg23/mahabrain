Like another <i> Homer</i> , his Birth is much contended, and many claim the Honour of it.  Some will have him of <i> German</i>  Extraction, Others of <i> French</i> , but the most received Opinion is, that he was an <i> Englishman</i> , born of very honest, but simple Parents, living in the Reign of King <i> Arthur</i> , a <i> British</i>  Monarch of the sixth Century, who was Chief General against the <i> Saxons</i> ;  but whether ever <i> Arthur</i>  existed, is a Point much controverted.<br>  	     However that be, <i> Tom Thumb</i>  is the Hero of the subsequent Opera, and Favourite of <i> Arthur</i> .  He returns about this Time from the Wars, leading a Captive Giantess in Triumph.  The King gives him a most gracious Reception, and in Recompence of his signal Services, bestows on him his Daughter the Princess <i> Huncamunca</i>  in Marriage.  At the same Time, his Majesty conceives a violent Passion for the fair Captive <i> Glumdalca</i> , whose Heart is already devoted to <i> Tom Thumb</i> .  The Queen, who is likewise enamour'd of the Generalissimo <i> Thumb</i> , strenuously opposes the Match agreed to by the King, upon which a great Quarrel arises between their Majesties.  On the other Hand, Lord <i> Grizzle</i> , a Courtier, is passionately fond of the Princess <i> Huncamunca</i> , whose Pretensions her Majesty seems to cherish, as a Means to frustrate the intended Nuptials, and thereby gratify her own Inclinations;  but perceiving her Policy of espousing his Interest does not answer her Design, but on the contrary, adds Fewel to the enflam'd <i> Grizzle</i> , and makes him breathe nothing but Destruction on his Rival, she immediately breaks with <i> Grizzle</i> ;  who, in Return, vows Revenge on <i> Thumb</i> , and also threatens to involve the Nation in the Disappointment of his Love.<br>  	     <i> Tom Thumb</i>  is not content to gain Glory only in the Field, but he likewise gives a singular Mark of Prowess, and Heroick Virtue, soon after his Arrival;  for his Friend <i> Noodle</i>  being arrested, he gallantly assails the Bailiff, and triumphant kills both him and his Follower.<br>  	     <i> Thumb's </i> intended Spouse being of a Disposition, apt for the State of Matrimony, appears in a very sad, and languishing Condition, till the Proposition the King her Royal Father makes of a Husband, when her heavy Melancholy soon dissipates, and she is transported beyond Expression with the Idea of changing her Condition.  Lord <i> Grizzle</i>  paying his Respects at this Juncture, she faintly rejects his Suit, alledging her being promis'd to <i> Thumb</i> ;  and <i> Grizzle</i>  using the Rhetorick of a slighted Lover, detracting from his Rival's Merit, but above all urging his Insufficiency, she is overcome by his prevailing Arguments, and gives her Consent to marry him privately.  Wing'd with the high Thoughts of Possession, <i> Grizzle</i>  flies to fetch the Licence.  In the mean Time <i> Tom Thumb</i>  waits on the Princess to commence his Courtship.  He makes some amorous Speeches, but is told by her Highness, that she is promis'd to another.  <i> Glumdalca</i> , who thinks herself injur'd in her Love by <i> Huncamunca</i> , enters at this Crisis, and a Scene of Contention between the two fair Rivals ensues, but <i> Glumdalca</i>  is defeated, <i> Tom</i>  giving his Preference to <i> Huncamunca</i> .  <i> Glumdalca</i>  is left full of Fury and Resentment.  The King, like a solitary Lover, throws himself in her Way, which occasions a Scene of Groans, finely wrought up.<br>  	     <i> Tom Thumb</i> , who a little before found the Princess wavering in her Love, has now remov'd all her late Difficulties, and the Ceremony is perform'd, which puts an End to a Lover's Anxieties.  <i> Huncamunca</i>  soon after sees <i> Grizzle</i> , and tells thim that, rather than incur his Displeasure, she will marry him likewise; but the incens'd <i> Grizzle</i>  rejects the Proposal with the greatest Contempt, and vows Destruction on <i> Thumb</i> , and the whole Kingdom, which puts <i> Huncamunca</i>  in a terrible Pannick.<br>  	     The Ghost of Gaffer <i> Thumb</i>  appears to <i> Arthur</i> , who is foretold of the Rebellion of<i>  Grizzle</i> .  The Queen having some Presage of this in her Sleep, quits her Bed in Search of <i> Arthur</i> , when a Messenger arrives, who informs their Majesties that <i> Grizzle</i>  is in Arms.  <i> Tom Thumb </i> is appointed to go against him.  <i> Grizzle</i>  with the Rebels appear.  <i> Tom Thumb</i>  marching in Pursuit of them, is told by <i> Merlin</i>  the Manner of his being begot, and withal shews him his Fate.  The two Armies come to an Engagement.  <i> Glumdalca</i>  is slain by <i> Grizzle</i> , and he by <i> Tom Thumb</i> .  The King causes Rejoicings to be made on this Success, but in the midst, a Messenger arrives, that brings Word of <i> Tom Thumb</i> 's being devour'd by a huge Red Cow, as he was bearing off <i> Grizle</i> 's Head to his Majesty.  This News puts a Damp on the King's Liberality, and he is much in Wrath.  The Queen stabs the Messenger, and like Children at the Play of <i> Strike your next Neighbour</i> , etc. they stab at one another all round.<br>  	     But this Scene of Horror is soon transform'd.  <i> Tom Thumb</i>  by Conjuration, is emitted from the Belly of the Cow, and all the rest are rais'd to Life again, by Virtue of <i> Merlin</i> 's Wand, in perfect Harmony with each other.<br>  <br>  Dramatis personae.<br>  MEN.<br>  KING ARTHUR.<br>  TOM THUMB the Great.<br>  GHOST of Gaffer THUMB.<br>  Lord GRIZZLE.<br>  MERLIN.<br>  NOODLE,   <br>  DOODLE,	}  Courtiers.<br>  FOODLE.<br>  BAILIFF.<br>  FOLLOWER.<br>  PARSON.<br>  <br>  WOMEN.<br>  QUEEN DOLLOLOLLA.<br>  HUNCAMUNCA her Daughter.<br>  GLUMDALCA Captive Giantess.<br>  CLEORA,		}	Maids of Honour.<br>  MUSTACHA,		<br>  <br>  COURTIERS, GUARDS, REBELS, DRUMS, TRUMPETS, THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.<br>  <br>  SCENE the Court of KING ARTHUR, and a PLAIN thereabouts.<br>  <br>  THE OPERA OF OPERAS;<br>  OR<br>  <i> Tom Thumb</i>  the Great.<br>  ACT I.
