There are some souls so weighed with life,<br>  So deep in sorrow, so oppressed with ill,<br>  That death comes like a prison-keeper kind<br>  To strike away the chains of their captivity.<br>  The holy Church's covenant of hell and heaven<br>  Is but a prophecy of that unmeasured dark<br>  Wherein the dead find sustenance and life;<br>  And men in their last hour come down unto the strand<br>  With all earth's hills behind them, and the level sea<br>  Ready for new emprise unknown and unexplored.<br>  Death is the hand that sends them from the shore,<br>  And death the wind that swells within their sails.<br>  And unto them that walk with leaden eyes<br>  Viewless and vacant as the staring blind<br>  Through life's harsh country, weary and despaired,<br>  To them, you call it cruelty and hate<br>  To give them vision of th' eternal sea<br>  Which leads into th' unknown? Oh, be assured<br>  That Mercy, queen of heaven, with backward grasp<br>  Beneath her grey-starred gown holds fast a sword,<br>  And unto some poor souls, in gift of gifts,<br>  Brings not fine balsam, but the edge of death.<br>  <br>                     ETARRE<br>  What charge is this; am I then merciful?<br>  Did mercy move me through the days and weeks<br>  Of his imprisonment, when he was cast<br>  To sleep among the nettled dungeon-holds<br>  And pray for sunbeams in a lightless pit?<br>  Did mercy move me when with jest and jeer<br>  You dragged him in the dust of horses' hoofs<br>  Or cast him in the sight of beast and bird<br>  To be their mockery? Freedom I sought.<br>  Slaves can be cruel, and I was worse than slave,<br>  Tormented with the thought that I was strong<br>  And he was weak, yet he with all his cries<br>  Made day a nightmare, and within my breast<br>  Dried up the wells of pity. Idle hope<br>  That I should turn against myself, and walk<br>  On paths of mercy!<br>  <br>                     MARIS<br>                       Slay him and be free.<br>  <br>                     ETARRE<br>  Slay him, and hear the owl at nightfall cry,<br>  And watch the rooks, wind-blown above the towers,<br>  Circle and caw, while all with self-same voice<br>  Say "Murderer?" Slay him, and think the dew<br>  Is born of lamentation, and the wind<br>  Is come on wings funereal and wild<br>  To scream for vengeance from the fiends of hell?<br>  Slay him, you say, and watch the lips of men<br>  Curdle against me, till my frenzied hands<br>  Are clapped above mine ears to hide the sound<br>  Of spoken evil? O unhappy, I,<br>  Laden with unpremeditated wrong<br>  Which will not alter. Oh, unhappy grief!<br>  <br>                     AILEEN<br>  How changed is your contentment, torn aside<br>  To bare the inner sorrow of unrest.<br>  Oh, leave these false pursuings; be at ease<br>  With woven pictures and imagined scenes<br>  And make not real the dreams of tragedy.<br>  <br>                     ETARRE<br>  Dreams, dreams, false shadows, phantoms thoughts,<br>  How I am wearied of their flapping wings<br>  Across the twilight of imagined worlds!<br>  There is a change within me of new hours<br>  And other suns; I could be kind or cruel<br>  With unsuspected tenderness and hate.<br>  There's something born within me, great and strange,<br>  A child of impulse, wakened in my veins.<br>  I'll have no more of dreams; come take this loom<br>  And set it forth to other hands. And now<br>  We'll hearken, Maris, to your deathly plaint.<br>  <br>                     AILEEN<br>  I wish you were not wrought of changeful mood.<br>  But late, you spoke of solitude's content<br>  And wove yourself a golden web of dreams,<br>  And now you're torn it like a tangled fly<br>  Within a spider's mesh that's spun too weak.<br>  <br>                     ETARRE<br>  Too weak it was; I've torn it with a word.<br>  <br>                     AILEEN<br>  And with a word rebuilt it many a time.<br>  <br>                     ETARRE<br>  The spider's dead; he'll weave no more. And now<br>  We'll listen, Maris, to your plea of hate.<br>  <br>                     MARIS<br>  'Tis not in hate I urge it. Well you know<br>  I bear no hate to mightier knights than I.<br>  <br>                     ETARRE<br>  And well you know I loathe your Pelleas<br>  And turn all praise of him to darker speech.<br>  <br>                     MARIS<br>  Still darker speech has gone abroad, to stain<br>  The honour of Etarre and all her knights.<br>  There is a tale now told in other halls,<br>  And false it rings, and yet, alas, is true.<br>  It tells of one lone knight who puts to scorn<br>  Dungeon and steel, a foe who will not fight<br>  Yet always conquers. Men speak hard of you<br>  And call you vampire, sucking might and power<br>  From lovelorn men. If this continues on,<br>  Before the year's end Camelot will hear,<br>  For Arthur's knights ride fast through all this land.<br>  If you would keep untarnished light of fame,<br>  This Pelleas must vanish from the land,<br>  And mouths of men gape empty of ill words.<br>  <br>                     ETARRE<br>  And if they know I slew him?<br>  <br>                     MARIS<br>                                      Not by guile;<br>  By open battle in the sight of men.<br>  <br>                     ETARRE<br>  And who is there in all this land of mine<br>  To battle with Sir Pelleas?<br>  <br>                     MARIS<br>                                  Even I.<br>  For he is fallen from his ancient strength<br>  Till I and he are grown one force in arms.<br>  <br>                     ETARRE<br>  And if he slay you?<br>  <br>                     MARIS<br>                     Then my cause is lost;<br>  I bear the sorrow.<br>  <br>                     ETARRE<br>                  If he will not fight?<br>  <br>                     MARIS<br>  We'll give him open choice to fight or die<br>  And love of you will guide him in his choice.<br>  <br>                     ETARRE<br>  And then he'd slay you! I have seen his spear<br>  Go down the lists and ravish charging steeds<br>  Of their proud burden. I have seen his sword<br>  Shear crest and helm, and leap through buckled steel.<br>  He'd slay you, slay you, and with eager cry<br>  Come throw himself before me, plead for love.<br>  No; other ways there are wherein men die,<br>  And I, the vampire of the strength of men, <br>  Shall know a better counsel.<br>                                     [<i> A horn is heard.</i> ]<br>                                   Hark, a horn!<br>  Go bring me news.

So I.<br>  And here is war with brazen throat and strong<br>  Come crying at my door, and I have slept.<br>  <br>                     AILEEN<br>  Here is no tramping of the hoofs of war;<br>  Some messenger on peaceful journey bent<br>  Craves food and shelter, giving in return<br>  The last hot news of joust at Camelot<br>  And feast of Arthur's knights, the noble tales<br>  Of battle unto giant and to dwarf<br>  In magic wood and isle snake-habited;<br>  Fen-dwelling sorcerers and craggy fiends;<br>  The last sad word of knights no more returned;<br>  Court-news and scandal, like a spider's thread<br>  That waves in th' wind, seeking whereon to build.<br>  <br>                     ETARRE<br>  Whate'er it be, my warders stand at guard<br>  In quick restraint lest any enter in,<br>  And unexpected come, and unannounced.<br>  Where's Maris that he waits so long?<br>  [GAWAINE <i> enters, with helm and shield of</i>  PELLEAS.<br>       <i> The visor is down.</i> ]<br>                                         Who's here?<br>  Pelleas?
