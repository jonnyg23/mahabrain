WEIR MITCHELL</h2>  </center>  <br>  Three days on Gawain's tomb Sir Lancelot wept,<br>  Then drew about him baron, knight, and earl,<br>  And cried, "Alack, fair lords, too late we came,<br>  For now heaven hath its own, and woe is mine:<br>  But 'gainst the black knight Death may none avail.<br>  I will that ye no longer stay for me.<br>  In Arthur's realm I go to seek the Queen,<br>  Nor ever more in earthly lists shall ride."<br>  So, heeding none, seven days he westward rode,<br>  And at the sainted mid-hour of the night<br>  Was 'ware of voices, and above them all<br>  One that he knew, and trembled now to hear.<br>  Rose-hedged before him stood a nunnery's walls,<br>  With gates wide open unto foe or friend.<br>  Unquestioned to the cloister court he came,<br>  And in the moonlight, on the balcony, saw<br>  Beneath the arches nuns and ladies stand,<br>  And in their midst a cowled white face he loved,<br>  Whereat he cried aloud, "Lo, I am here!<br>  Lo, I am here!--I, Lancelot, am here!<br>  Would ye I came?  I could not help but come."<br>  Spake then the Queen, low-voiced as one in pain:<br>  "Oh, call him here, I pray you call him here."<br>  Then lit Sir Lancelot down, and climbed the stair,<br>  And doffed his helm, and stood before the Queen.<br>  But she that had great fear to see his face:<br>  "Oh, sinless sisters, ye that are so dear,<br>  Lo, this is he through whom great ills were wrought;<br>  For by our love, which we have loved too well,<br>  Is slain my lord and many noble knights.<br>  And therefore, wit ye well, Sir Lancelot,<br>  My soul's health waneth; yet through God's good grace<br>  I trust, when death is come, to sit with Christ,<br>  Because in heaven more sinful souls than I<br>  Are saints in heaven; and therefore, Lancelot,<br>  For all the love that ever bound our souls<br>  I do beseech thee hide again thy face.<br>  On God's behalf I bid thee straitly go,<br>  Because my life is as a summer spent;<br>  Yea, go, and keep thy realm from wrack and war,<br>  For, well as I have loved thee, Lancelot,<br>  My heart will no more serve to see thy face;<br>  Nay, not if thou shouldst know love in mine eyes.<br>  In good haste get thee to thy realm again,<br>  And heartily do I beseech thee pray<br>  That I may make amend of time mislived.<br>  And take to thee a wife, for age is long."<br>  "Ah no, sweet madam," said Sir Lancelot,<br>  "That know ye well I may not while I breathe;<br>  But as thou livest, I will live in prayer."<br>  "If thou wilt do so," said the Queen, "so be.<br>  Hold fast thy promise; yet full well I know<br>  The world will bid thee back." -- "And yet," he cried,<br>  "When didst thou know me to a promise false?<br>  Wherefore, my lady dame, sweet Guinevere,<br>  For all my earthly bliss hath been in thee,<br>  If thou wilt no more take of this world's joy,<br>  I too shall cease to know the bliss of life.<br>  I pray thee kiss me once, and nevermore."<br>  "Nay," said the Queen, "that shall I never do.<br>  No more of earthly lips shall I be kissed."<br>  Then like to one stung through with hurt of spears,<br>  Who stares, death-blinded, round the reeling lists,<br>  At gaze he stood, but saw no more the Queen;<br>  And as a man who gropes afoot in dreams,<br>  Deaf, dumb, and sightless, down the gallery stairs<br>  Stumbling he went, with hands outstretched for aid,<br>  And found his horse, and rode, till in a vale<br>  At evening, 'twixt two cliffs, came Bedevere,<br>  And with his woesome story stayed the knight.<br>  At this, Sir Lancelot's heart did almost break<br>  For sorrow, and abroad his arms he cast,<br>  And cried, "Alas! ah, who may trust this world!"<br>  <br>
