The Favour and Approbation it met with, was much greater, and far more Universal, even among great Names, and establish'd, uncontested Judges, than I had ever the Vanity to expect.  Nor was I in the least surpriz'd or troubled, that it met with some Opposers.  For I must have been extreamly ignorant of the nature of Humane Passions, if I had not certainly foreseen, that not only the Design of the Poem, but likewise the </i> Provoking<i>  </i> Preface<i>  to it, must needs have engag'd a </i> Considerable<i>  </i> Party<i> , among whom were several Men of Wit and Parts, to use their utmost Endeavours to sink its Reputation; if indeed it should deserve any.
 </i><p>      Besides, when I consider'd that I was so great a stranger to the  Muses<i> , and by no means free of the </i> Poets Company<i> , having never Kiss'd their Governour's hands, nor made the least Court to the Committee that sits in </i> Convent<i>  </i> Garden;<i>  and that therefore mine was not so much as a </i> Permission Poem<i> , but a pure, </i> downright<i>  </i> Interloper<i> , it was but natural to conclude, that those </i> Gentlemen<i> , who by Assisting, Crying up, Excusing and Complementing one another, carry on their Poetical Trade in a Joynt-stock,  would certainly do what they could to sink and ruin an </i> unlicens'd<i>  </i> Adventurer<i> ; notwithstanding I disturb'd none of their Factorys, nor imported any Goods they had ever dealt in.  I knew that I ran a very great Risk while I was so hardy to venture abroad Naked and Unguarded, when none of the </i> Company<i>  went out without a notable </i> Convoy of Criticks<i>  and </i> Applauders<i> , who were constantly in their Service; Men tho' singly of no great Force, yet when united, considerable for their Numbers.  Accordingly when the Poem came forth they attack'd it, tho' perhaps not with all the Discretion, yet with all the Fury Imaginable; But all their Strokes were lost, and all their Efforts made in vain.  Impartial Readers, with great Generosity, protected the </i> strange<i>  </i> Muse<i>  from their rude Insults; and rescu'd her from their Noise and Violence.  For their Character and Temper, as well as the Grounds and Reasons of their Outcrys and Opposition were so well known, that they could by no means pass for unbyass'd and Disinterested Judges; and therefore all their Attempts either prov'd Unsuccessful, or produc'd a quite contrary Effect, and instead of lessening the Credit of the </i> Poem,<i>  in many Instances they very much advanc'd it.
 </i></p><p>      These  Gentlemen<i>  pretend to be displeas'd with </i> Prince Arthur<i> , because they have discover'd so many Faults in it:  But there is good reason to believe they would have been more displeas'd, if they had discover'd fewer.  But they say, they have very nicely and carefully compar'd this </i> Poem<i>  with </i> Virgil<i> 's, and they find that famous </i> Roman<i>  has abundantly the advantage of </i> Prince Arthur<i> .  This they are Confident of, and are ready to maintain against all Mankind what I must confess, I never in the least doubted of.  But in the mean time, the making of that Comparison, and the very starting of the Debate, is a greater Honour done to the </i> Poem<i>  than could have been expected from the enemys of it.  But they seem to have given it yet a greater Reputation, inasmuch as they have not adventur'd to say or maintain, that either </i> Homer<i>  himself the Prince and Father of the </i> Epick<i>  </i> Poets<i> , or any of his Successors, </i> Virgil<i>  excepted, has shewn a more regular Conduct, or a more perfect Model, how much greater </i> Genius<i>  soever do's appear in their Writings.
 </i></p><p>      After all it must be acknowledg'd, that setting aside abundance of Frivolous, Frolicksom, and Groundless Objections which the Enemys of  Prince Arthur<i>  have made, that several considerable Defects are to be found in that </i> Poem<i> . I was conscious to my self, that the Second and Third Books were too long before I publish'd them, tho' they were not made before the First, as some have imagin'd, but hoping that they would not prove tedious to any impartial Readers, and that it might be an useful Entertainment to many, I was contented to let that </i> Indecorum<i>  pass.  And several Friends to </i> Prince Arthur<i>  did very early convince me, that in several Instances the Descriptions, Digressions, and Similes, were lyable to the same Objection.  I was likewise soon after the Publishing satisfy'd, that I had not well consider'd the Recital made by </i> Lucius<i>  in the Fourth Book; and particularly that it began too high; as likewise of many other Faults and Indecencies of less Importance.
 </i></p><p>      'Tis certain, that none could expect from me an  Epick Poem<i>  in all degrees of Perfection, there is no faultless Writer of that Kind, has ever appear'd in the World, not </i> Virgil<i>  himself excepted, tho' his Poem was a labour'd Piece, the Work of great part of his Life; and after revis'd by two Eminent Criticks </i> Tucca<i>  and </i> Varius.  <i> And as for the great </i> Homer<i> , if any Gentleman is pleas'd to read </i> Rapin<i> 's Comparison of him with </i> Virgil<i> , he will be soon convinc'd that the Poems of this Wonderful Man have many considerable Defects.  But the </i> Criticks<i> , and particularly the famous </i> Longinus<i>  have an Apology that will easily get him off:  They say of Writers of the first Rank, such as </i> Homer<i>  and </i> Demosthenes<i> , that one or two of their extraordinary and admirable Thoughts will Atone for all their Faults, and that a great Man is uncapable of attending with anxious Care to matters of little Importance.
 </i></p><p>      And if a sour, pragmatical  Critick<i>  would spend a Years time in searching after Objections to either of these Authours, he might perhaps find a great deal to say; but nothing that would lessen their Reputation.
 </i></p><p>      The faults in  Prince Arthur<i>  proceeded partly from defect of </i> Judgment<i>  and </i> Genius<i>  equal to, and sufficient for so great and difficult an Undertaking; partly from want of Leisure and Retirement, to consider coolly ever part of that Writing, and partly from the hasty Dispatch of it; it having been Begun, Carry'd on and Compleated, as in the Preface was Suggested, in less than two years time, and by such catches and starts, and in such occasional, uncertain hours, as the Business of my Profession would afford me.  And therefore for the greatest part that </i> Poem <i> was written in </i> Coffee-houses<i> , and in passing up and down the Streets; because I had little leisure elsewhere to apply to it.
 </i></p><p>      Another reason of the Defects that appear in that writing is this, That when I undertook it I had been long a stranger to the Muses.  I had read but little  Poetry<i>  throughout my whole Life, and in fifteen years before, I had not, as I can remember, wrote a hundred Lines in Verse, excepting a Copy of Latine Verses in honour of a Friend's Book.
 </i></p><p>      As this Apology will perhaps take off the severity of the Reader's Censure as to  Prince Arthur<i> , so I hope it may likewise have the same Effect, as to the following </i> Poem<i> ; for all the same things, except the last, can be said to excuse the Defects that shall appear in this.  And if it shall be demanded why it was so hastily publish'd, all that I shall say is this, that the Judicious Reader will soon find in the </i> Poem<i>  it self, the true Reason why I could keep it no longer by me; which if I could have done, it would, perhaps, have appear'd with more Advantages.
 </i></p><p>      The Reasons which induc'd me to make the former, did likewise engage me in this second Attempt in  Epick<i>  Poetry; and among the rest, particularly this, that the young Gentlemen and Ladys who are delighted with Poetry might have a useful, at least a harmless Entertainment, which in our Modern Plays and Poems cannot ordinarily be found.  The Candor of the Age has made my Design in a great measure successful, whereby I am abundantly convinc'd that those Poets are under a great mistake, that think there is no other, but that leud and abominable way of writing which was encourag'd in the late Reigns, that will please the Nation.  This is a meer Pretence of ill Poets, whose Imaginations are fill'd only with base and contemptible </i> Ideas<i> ; Men of a poor and narrow </i> Genius<i> , scarce above the level of Writers of Farce, who would not have Images enough left in their Minds to furnish out a </i> Poem<i> , if the prophane and obscene ones were struck out.  And tho' these mischievous ways of Writing are still endur'd, to the great prejudice of Religion and good Manners, yet if ever the </i> English<i>  Nation recovers it's ancient Vertue, and a just Tast of these Matters, I do not doubt but most of those Writers who have been esteem'd and applauded in the late loose and vicious Times, will be rejected with Indignation and Contempt, as the Dishonour of the Muses, and the Underminers of the Publick Good.  But I am carry'd on to a Subject of which I have spoken enough heretofore.
 </i></p><p>   
 </p><p>      Since the writing of this, I have seen a  Tragedy<i>  call'd the </i> Mourning Bride<i> ; which I think my self oblig'd to take notice of in this place.  This </i> Poem<i>  has receiv'd, and in my Opinion very justly, Universal Applause; being look'd on as the most perfect </i> Tragedy<i>  that has been wrote in this Age.  The </i> Fable<i> , as far as I can judge at first sight, is a very Artful and Masterly Contrivance.  The </i> Characters<i>  are well chosen, and well delineated.  That of </i> Zara<i>  is admirable.  The </i> Passions<i>  are well touch'd, and skillfully wrought up.  The </i> Diction<i>  is Proper, Clear, Beautiful, Noble, and diversify'd agreeably to the variety of the Subject.  Vice, as it ought to be, is punish'd, and Opprest Innocence at last Rewarded.  Nature appears very happily imitated, excepting one or two doubtful Instances, thro' the whole Piece, in all which there are no immodest Images or Expressions, no wild, unnatural Rants, but some few Exceptions being allow'd, all things are Chast, Just,  and Decent.  This </i> Tragedy<i> , as I said before, has mightily obtain'd; and that without the unnatural and foolish mixture of  </i> Farce <i> and</i>  Buffoonry, <i> without so much as a Song, or Dance to make it more agreeable.  By this it appears, that as a sufficient </i> Genius<i>  can recommend it self, and furnish out abundant matter of Pleasure and Admiration without the paultry helps above nam'd, so likewise that the Tast of the Nation is not so far deprav'd, but that a Regular and Chast Play will not only be forgiven, but highly Applauded.  And now there is some reason to hope that our </i> Poets<i>  will follow this excellent Example, and that hereafter no slovenly Writer will be so hardy as to offer to our Publick Audiences his obscene and prophane Pollutions, to the great Offence of all Persons of Vertue and good Sense.  The common pretence that the Audience will not be otherwise pleas'd, is now wholly remov'd; for here is a notorious Instance to the contrary.  And it must be look'd on hereafter as the </i> Poet's<i>  fault, and not the </i> People<i> 's, if we have not better Performances.  All men must now conclude that 'tis for want of Wit and Judgment to support them, that our </i> Poets<i>  for the Stage apply themselves to such low and unworthy ways to recommend their Writings; and therefore I cannot but conceive Great Hopes that every good </i> Genius<i>  for the fuutre will look on it self debas'd by condescending to Write in that leud Manner, that has been of late years introduc'd, and too long Encourag'd.  And if this comes to pass the Writers in the late Reigns will be asham'd of their own Works, and wish they had their </i> Plays<i>  in again, as well as their fulsome Dedications.
 </i></p><p>   
 </p><p>      Some Persons have demanded the Reason, seeing I had a Fancy to be an Author, why I had not written on some useful Subject in Physic or Philosophy:  this they imagin'd would have became me better than the engaging my Thoughts on a Subject so far distant from the Business of my Profession.  I desire these Gentlemen to receive this answer; First, That the writing of this, as well as the former  Poem<i>  was not Business, but Diversion and Recreation; an Innocent Amusement to entertain me in such leisure hours which were usually past away before in Conversation, and unprofitable hearing and telling of News.  But if I had set my self to writing on matters of </i> Physic<i>  or </i> Philosophy<i> , this would not have been a </i> Recreation<i> , but another </i> Business <i> and </i> Labour<i> , for which I was unfit, and that requir'd the Liberty of my Books and Closet, and some sort of Retirement, which the Continual Dutys of my Profession would not allow me.  But I have also another Reason to give to the Persons who ask the Question above mention'd; and that is, that I am so far faln out with all Hyphotheses in </i>  Philosophy<i> , and all Doctrines of Physic which are built upon them, that in such matters I am almost reduc'd to a </i> Sceptical Despair<i> . The </i> Almighty<i> 's </i> Creation<i>  is like his </i> Providence<i> , unsearchable; </i> his<i>  </i> Works<i> , and </i> his<i>  </i> Ways<i>  are equally past finding out; the raising of an Hypotheses in Philosophy obtains little more Credit with me, that the erecting a Scheme in Astrology; and the Judgments and Decisions that are given upon them seem to me alike Precarious and uncertain.  I was once enamour'd with the </i> Cartesian System<i> , but the warmth of my Passion is quite extinguish'd.  It may indeed make a Man capable of entertaining and amusing others, but not of quieting and satisfying himself.  All Knowledge is valuable according to it's degree of Usefulness, as it do's more or less promote the benefit of Mankind, and for this Reason 'tis a great mortification to consider how little the Pains and Time I have bestow'd in Philosophical Enquirys, have contributed to my knowledge in Curing Diseases.  I am now inclin'd to think, that 'tis an Injury to a Man of good sense and natural Sagacity, to be hamper'd with any Hypothesis before he comes to the Practice of Physic.  For this prepossession obstructs the Freedom of his Judgement, puts a strong Byass on his Thoughts, and obliges him to make all the Observations that occur to him in his Practise, to comply with, and humour his pre-conceived Opinions; whereas in Reason, his Observations on Nature should be first made, before any Hypotheses should be establish'd.  A clear and penetrating Understanding, Cultivated and Matur'd by repeated, Diligent Observation, will in my Opinion, make a more able and accomplish'd Physitian, than any </i> Philosophical Scheme<i>  that has yet obtain'd in the World.  And what useful Knowledge, I have gain'd this way in my Profession, may perhaps sometime be made Publick.
 </i></p><p>      I look on my self to have greater obligations to the Studies of Logic and Metaphysicks, wherein I was carefully instructed in the University, which improve and advance our reasoning Faculty, teach us to think clearly and distinctly, to speak pertinently, closely, and justly; and thereby fit a Man for any kind of Business or Profession, than to all the Searches which I have made after the Reasons and Causes of  Natural Phænomena<i> .
 </i></p><p>      I am very sensible, that these Studies are in great Contempt with many Ingenious Men; the subject of much Raillery, and the great Abomination of the  Wits<i> .  But I am likewise very sensible, that these merry Men very rarely become eminently useful in any sort of Profession; for the most part they continue Triflers all their Days; and a meer Jester, when he comes abroad into the World, makes a very mean Figure among Men of Business.  'Tis remarkable that those Idle, and almost illiterate Young Men, that are call'd </i> Wits<i>  in our Universities, are very inconsiderable Things elsewhere; for Mankind will never be perswaded to have those Men, who can only make them laugh, in equal Esteem with those that can do them Good.
 </i></p><p>      Thus much in answer to those who have demanded, Why a Physician instead of communicating his Knowledge and Experience in his Profession, busys himself in Writing Heroic Poems.
 </p><p>   
 </p><p>      As to the following Performance, tho' the  Hero<i>  be the same, yet 'tis another entire Poem, distinct from the former:  For 'tis the Diversity of the Action, and not of the </i> Hero<i> , that diversifies the Poem.  And that the Reader may better observe whence the Action of this takes its Rise, I will tell in short </i> King Arthur<i> '</i> s<i>  Story, as 'tis related by </i> Geofry <i> of </i> Monmouth<i> .  That there was about the end of the Fourth, or the beginning of the Fifth  </i> Century<i> , a King of </i> Britain<i>  nam'd </i> Arthur<i> ; a Prince of extraordinary Qualities, and Famous for his Martial Atchievements, who succeeeded his Father </i> Uter Pendragon<i> , all our Historians agree; and the eminently learned Bishop of </i> Worcester<i>  in his </i> Origines Britannicæ,<i>  do's acknowledge it.  And tho' the above-cited </i> Geofry<i>  of </i> Monmouth<i>  is indeed a Fabulous Author, yet his Authority, especially considering that there was such a Warlike Prince as </i> Arthur<i> , is a sufficient Foundation for an </i> Epick Poem<i> .  This Author says, that after </i> King Arthur<i>  had Conquer'd the </i> Saxons<i> , who being call'd in by </i> Vortigern<i>  to protect him against the Incursions and Depredations of the </i> Scots<i>  and </i> Picts<i> , took the advantage, and settled themselves in this Island; he prepar'd a </i> Royal Navy<i> , Embark'd his </i> Troops<i> , and directed his Course to the Coasts of </i> Norway<i> ; then called, according to </i> Cluverius<i> , </i> Nerigon<i> , or the </i> Western Part<i>  of </i> Scandinavia<i> .  This Kingdom being subdued, he carried his Arms into the Country now call'd </i> Denmark<i> , then inhabited by the </i> Cimbri<i> : And by the Writers of the Age in which </i> Geofry<i>  of </i> Monmouth<i>  liv'd, call'd commonly, but erroneously, </i> Dacia<i> .  This Kingdom he likewise quickly overrun: For it seems nothing could stand before him.  This done, he return'd home in Triumph, and having for a while, entertain'd at his Court with great Splendor and Magnificence, multitudes of </i> Foreign Princes, <i> and Knights famous for Chivalry, who came to signalize their Valour at the </i> Justs <i>  and </i> Tournaments <i> which </i> King Arthur<i>  had proclaim'd; He Embark'd his Army to Invade</i>  Gallia<i> , sate down before </i> Lutetia<i> , once the Capital </i> City<i>  of the </i> Parisij<i> , and in </i> Arthur'<i> s days of the </i> Franci<i> , and soon made himself Master of the Place.  This Expedition, and the Conquest of </i> Lutetia<i> , is the Subject of the following </i> Poem<i> . 
 </i></p><p>      The Model of it is New, and therfore now I hope I shall not be Censur'd for an  Imitator<i> , tho' I must confess, I cannot believe my Imitation of </i> Virgil <i> in the former </i> Poem <i> to be the least dishonour.  Would the famous Sir </i> Godfry Kneller<i>  think it a Reproach if any should say, that his Pencil too nearly follow'd that of </i> Raphael Urbin<i> ?  Or can it be imagin'd, that Sir </i> Christopher Wren<i>  would be offended, if it should be objected to him, that in his building of </i> St. Paul'<i> s </i> Church<i>  he too much imitated </i> Michael Angelo.
 </p><p>      <i> And as I had not my Eye upon any other Model, so I am not conscious to my Self of having us'd any Authour's Thoughts or Expressions, excepting two or three Images taken from </i> Homer<i> , and a few allusions to some </i> Inventions <i> of </i> Milton, <i> whom I took on as a very Extraordinary </i> Genius<i> .  If there be any other Thoughts that are not my own, they are taken from the Sacred Writers of the Bible, which I hope I shall not be condemn'd for.  I have in the </i> Sixth Book<i>  adventur'd on an </i> Allegory<i> , finding </i> Homer<i>  has done the like in his Story of </i> Circe<i> .  His Example, I imagin, as well as the Nature and Design of </i> Epick Poetry<i>  will justify that Attempt, especially since I have not dwelt long upon it.
 </i></p><p>      Whether the  Fable <i> of this </i> Poem<i>  be a </i> regular Contrivance<i> , whether there be but </i> One<i> , </i> Unbroken, Compleat Action, <i> whether the </i> Choice<i> , the </i> Conduct, Connexion, <i> and </i> Extension <i> of the </i> Episodes<i> , and whether the </i> Diction<i>  and </i> Narration <i> be such as the Rules of </i> Epick Poetry<i>  require, must be left to the Decision of the </i> Judicious Reader<i> .  It would be a wild Imagination to think of pleasing all the </i> Criticks<i>  who are no better agreed among themselves.  Till the Rules of Writing are Setled by some </i> Infallible Judge<i>  of </i> Controversys <i> among</i>  Poets, <i> there will be different</i>  Opinions<i>  and disagreeing </i> Sects<i>  in </i> Parnassus<i> , who will always treat and persecute one another as </i> Obstinate Hereticks<i> .  The </i> Essential<i>  and </i> Fundamental<i>  </i> Articles<i> , for want of which a </i> Poet<i>  is justly condemn'd, are very few.  There are Abundance of probable Doctrines which the </i> Schoolmen <i>  of </i>  Parnassus<i>  and the </i> Poets <i> in Speculation may hold affirmatively or negatively, as they please, and yet be look'd on as very </i> good Sons<i>  of the </i> Muses.  <i> If there appears enough in this </i> Poem<i>  to Entertain those </i> candid Readers<i>  who were not displeas'd with the </i> Former<i> , I shall be abundantly satisfy'd, and easily pass by the </i> Censures<i>  of those who are declared Enemys before hand.  The Ingenuous part of Mankind will not fall unmercifully on a </i>  Writer <i> of </i> Epick Poetry<i> , wherein only two Men, I mean </i> Homer<i>  and </i> Virgil<i>  have succeeded.  Whatever </i> Genius<i>  others have discover'd, none have left any Thing that came near to a perfect </i> Model, <i> but these two great Masters:  and I do not think it amiss in this place to make a Comparison between them, with which I shall end this </i> Preface.  
 </p><p>      Homer <i> excels in </i> Genius<i> , </i> Virgil<i>  in </i> Judgment.  Homer<i>  as conscious of his great Riches and Fullness entertains the </i> Reader<i>  with great Splendor and Magnificent Profusion.  </i> Virgil<i> 's</i>  <i> Dishes are well chosen, and tho not Rich and Numerous, yet serv'd up in great Order and Decency.  </i> Homer<i> '</i> s<i>  Imagination is Strong, Vast and Boundless, an unexhausted </i> Treasure<i>  of all kinds of </i> Images;<i>  which made his </i> Admirers<i>  and </i> Commentators <i> in all Ages affirm, that all sorts of Learning were to be found in his </i> Poems.  Virgil's <i> Imagination</i>  <i> is not so Capacious, tho' his </i> Ideas <i> are Clear, Noble, and of great Conformity to their Objects.  </i> Homer<i>  has more of the </i> Poetical Inspiration<i> .  His Fire burns with extraordinary Heat and Vehemence, and often breaks out in Flashes, which Surprise, Dazle and Astonish the </i> Reader<i> : </i> Virgil'<i> s is a clearer and a chaster Flame, which pleases and delights, but never blazes in that extraordinary and surprising manner.  Methinks there is the same Difference between these two great </i> Poets<i> , as there is between their </i> Heros.  Homer'<i> s Hero, </i> Achilles<i> , is Vehement, Raging and Impetuous.  He is always on Fire, and transported with an immoderate and resistless Fury, performs every where </i> Miraculous<i>  </i> Atchievements<i> , and like a rapid Torrent overturns all things in his way.  </i> Æneas,<i>  the Hero of the </i> Latine Poet<i> , is a calm, Sedate Warriour.  He do's not want Courage, neither has he any to spare:  and the </i> Poet<i>  might have allowed him a little more Fire, without overheating him.  As for Invention, 'tis evident the </i> Greek Poet<i>  has mightily the advantage.  Nothing is more Rich and Fertile than </i> Homer<i> '</i> s<i>  Fancy.  He is Full, Abundant, and Diffusive above all others.  </i> Virgil<i>  on the other hand is rather dry, than fruitful.  'Tis plain the </i> Latin Poet<i>  in all his famous </i> Æneis, <i> has very little, if any Design of his own.  The Recital of the </i> Destruction <i> of </i> Troy<i> , and the Story of the </i> Wooden Horse, Macrobius<i>  says, is almost word for word taken from  </i> Pisander. <i>  The Navigation of </i> Æneas; <i> and his Dangers and Adventures by </i> Sea<i> , are drawn from the example of </i> Homer's Ulysses.<i>   His Descent into Hell, which makes the Noble </i> Sixth Book<i> , is likewise in Imitation of the Hero before nam'd.  The Shield of </i> Æneas <i> is form'd by that of </i> Achilles<i> .  The Battels in the </i> Æneis<i>  very much resemble those in the </i> Ilias<i> .  A great many of the Pictures are taken from thence, and abundance of the Warriours are the same with those who fought before the Walls of </i> Troy<i> .
 </i></p><p>      And tho 'tis true the Story of  Æneas <i> and</i>  Dido<i>  is not to be trac'd in </i> Homer<i> 's </i> Works<i> , yet </i> Macrobius <i> tells us in his</i>  Saturnalia, <i> that this likewise is borrow'd from what is said of </i> Jason<i>  and </i> Medea<i>  in the </i> Fourth Book<i>  of </i> Apollonius<i>  his </i> Argonautica<i> .  Those who are willing to see how much </i> Virgil<i>  is indebted to </i> Homer<i> , and the rest of the </i> Greek Poets<i> , and also to the </i> Latins <i>  themselves, as </i> Ennius, Lucretius<i> , </i> Varius<i> , &amp; c. from whom he has taken his Designs, or his particular Images; or whose very Lines he has Translated almost word for word, of  which an Incredible number of Instances may be given, may consult the before nam'd </i> Macrobius<i>  in his </i> Saturnalia, Fulvius Ursinus<i>  his </i> Comparatio Virgilij cum Scriptoribus Græcis &amp; Guellius<i> , his </i> Comments<i>  on this great </i> Poet.  <i> They will then see plainly that </i> Virgil<i> '</i> s<i>  Materials were all borrow'd, tho' the Noble </i> Structure<i>  be his own.  The Excellency of this Extraordinary Man lay in his </i> Judicious Contrivance, Regular Conduct, <i> the </i>  Skilful Accomodation<i>  of other Mens Conceptions to his own Purpose, and in the </i> Propriety, Decency, Beauty <i> and</i>  Majesty <i> of his </i> Expression, <i> which in the finish'd Parts of his </i> Poem<i>  are </i> Admirable <i> and </i> Inimitable.  <i> If therefore the Question be, who had the greater </i> Genius, Homer<i>  or </i> Virgil<i> , there is no doubt but </i> Homer<i>  must be Prefer'd?  But if it be whether </i> Virgil'<i> s be a more Regular, Artful and Judicious </i> Poem <i> than either of </i> Homers, <i> then </i> Virgil<i>  must be acknowledg'd to have the advantage?<br>  </i>

fine, <i> Tartarean</i>  Gold,<br>  Which dismal Glory did around display<br>  Thro' the Dun Air, and made a hideous Day.<br>  The high rais'd Pillars were of <i> Stygian</i>  Jet,<br>  Of <i>

prodigious Bats, and croking Ravens flew.<br>  Poppys the Gardens bore, and Hollioaks,<br>  Henbane, and Nightshade and unwholsom Box.<br>  <br>     Hither the summon'd Spirits did resort,<br>  And with their numbers fill'd their Prince's Court.<br>  Th' Assembly made a murm'ring hollow sound,<br>  Like that of Torrents rolling under ground;<br>  But all the busy Spirits, when they saw<br>  Their Monarch enter, with a silent Awe<br>  Attentive waited, he ascends his Throne,<br>  Which high erected o'er the Assembly shone.<br>  Then with a frowning Look yet haughty Air<br>  He thus began.

Then <i> Rimmon</i>  rose up from his Place,<br>  Of noble Stature, and Majestic Grace.<br>  In Eloquence and soft perswasive charms<br>  He much excell'd, but little car'd for Arms.<br>  No Seraph of a vaster Genius fell<br>  From the blest Regions to the Gulph of Hell.<br>  No Lord, that in th' Infernal Council sate<br>  Sustain'd with greater skill a high debate,<br>  Or seem'd more fit for Business of the State.<br>  None spoke with so much Ease, and such Address,<br>  None Business better knew, or lov'd it less.<br>  Dissolv'd in Luxury, in Sloth and Ease,<br>  He War declin'd, and pleaded still for Peace.<br>  No nobler Presence in the Court appear'd,<br>  None by the Senators was better heard.<br>  They knew his falshood, yet th' attentive throng<br>  Lov'd the soft Music of his charming Tongue.<br>  <br>     Who thus begun.

The Synod gave a loud Applause,<br>  And with this Counsel pleas'd, their Monarch rose.<br>  <br>     Mean time the <i> Gallic</i>  Monarch took th' alarm,<br>  And gave Command for all his Men to

important Message in his Mind revolv'd.<br>  He in the greatest Straights could ever find<br>  Unshaken Courage, and a present Mind.<br>  If happy or unhappy Tydings came,<br>  His Godlike Temper ever was the same.<br>  In Storms of State he was a steady Guide,<br>  Still ply'd the Helm, and stem'd th' impetuous Tyde.<br>  No Change of Looks his inward Care confest,<br>  And when he suffer'd most, he show'd it least.<br>  Oft from the lowest Ebb his Waters came<br>  Back to their Channel with a nobler Stream.<br>  His sick'ning Orb would oft disturb the Sight<br>  With faded Glory, and expiring Light:<br>  But would as often with a suddain Blaze<br>  Break out, and shine with more illustrious Rays:<br>  Oft thrust from Heav'n it left its starry Sphere<br>  Sunk down, and hung below in Cloudy

break,<br>  I'll lead my Squadrons <i> Clotar</i>  to invade,<br>  And if my Arms by Heav'n's propitious Aid,<br>  Against the <i> Gallic</i>  Forces shall succed,<br>  I'll reach <i> Britannia</i>  with the utmost Speed,<br>  To calm those Heats which interrupt her Peace,<br>  And find fit Med'cines for the sharp Disease.<br>  <br>     Now had <i> Aurora</i>  on the Face of Night<br>  Pour'd from her Golden Urn fresh Streams of Light.<br>  That fin'd and clear'd the Air, while down to Hell<br>  The shady Dregs precipitated fell.<br>  Then with Heroic Eagerness and Hast<br>  King <i>

when it came<br>  Red from the Forge, did scarce more fiercely flame.<br>  Then his long Spear he grip'd, which shone from far<br>  Bright, as if pointed with the Morning Star.<br>  When first into his Hand King <i> Arthur</i>  took<br>  The pondrous Ash, the trembling Weapon shook,<br>  As if 'twas conscious what a bloody Lake,<br>  What vast Destruction 'twas about to make.<br>  With Martial

Clouds of Smoke his working Nostrils blow,<br>  And Streams of Fire out from his Eyeballs flow.<br>  His eager Looks his inward Heat express,<br>  And all his quiv'ring Limbs his Joy confess.<br>  He

Th' affrighted Stream with unaccustom'd hast<br>  By its arm'd Banks, and Iron Margin past.<br>  Amidst the numerous Hosts the River flow'd<br>  Like a vast Serpent, gliding thro' a Wood.<br>  <br>     The valiant <i> Briton</i>  wav'd his flaming Sword,<br>  And full of Rage his fiery Courser spur'd;<br>  The wound resented by the generous Beast<br>  He plung'd amidst the Waves, and with his Breast<br>  He all th' opposing Waters did divide,<br>  And made his way across th' impetuous Tyde.<br>  As when (so Poets feign) lascivious <i> Jove</i>  <br>  Forsaking Heav'n became a Bull for Love,<br>  The Thund'ring Beast with mighty Vigor bore<br>  Across the Tyde his Mistress to the Shore.<br>  So <i> Arthur</i> 's Steed the River's fury braves<br>  Carrying a nobler Passion thro' the Waves.<br>  Thro' Showers of Arrows which around him flew,<br>  And Storms of Darts which <i> Gallic</i>  Warriours threw<br>  The mighty King advanc'd, and from the Stream<br>  Bright as the Morning Sun in Triumph came.<br>  With such a Lustre, and with such a Force<br>  He rose, prepar'd to run his glorious Course.<br>  Had those who liv'd in antient times descry'd<br>  This Warriour rising from the foaming tide,<br>  They would have thought that <i> Mars</i>  himself had come,<br>  As well as <i> Venus,</i>  from the Water's Womb.<br>  Fir'd with th' Example of th' intrepid King<br>  The <i> British</i>  Youth with Shouts did onward spring.<br>  All to the Banks advanc'd, and with their Swords<br>  High lifted up they leap'd to cross the Fords.<br>  While thus the <i> Britons</i>  boldly pass'd the Tyde,<br>  The <i> Gallic</i>  Troops rang'd on the other Side<br>  Cast Clouds of Darts from near, and from afar,<br>  To beat off from the Banks the wading War.<br>  A ratling Storm down on the River pours,<br>  And bearded Death descends in feather'd Showrs.<br>  Some Rocky Fragments hurl against the Foe,<br>  Some massy Spears, some glitt'ring Jav'lins throw.<br>  While thus they strove th' Aggressor to repel,<br>  Many great <i> Britons</i>  by their Weapons fell.<br>  Who mingled with the Waves their flowing Blood,<br>  And turn'd the Crystal to a Purple Flood.<br>  Coursers, dismounted Riders, Jav'lins, Helms,<br>  And massy Shields the swelling Tyde o'erwhelms.<br>  Spears, Arrows, Bows, and Plumes of various Dy<br>  Upon the rapid Waters floating ly,<br>  And Darts their Fury spent, still on the Current fly.<br>  <br>     First his impetuous Dart <i> Olcanor</i>  cast<br>  Which thro' <i> Comara</i> 's shining Buckler past:<br>  Then thro' his temper'd Breastplate made its Way,<br>  And buried deep within his Bosom lay.<br>  From the wide Wound warm crimson Streams of Blood<br>  Sprang out, and down the <i> Briton</i> 's Armour flow'd:<br>  Backwards he fell of Sense and Breath bereft,<br>  And his hot Steed without a Rider left.<br>  The generous Courser now without a Guide,<br>  Did with the spacious Breast the Flood divide,<br>  And climbing up the Banks with loosen'd Reins,<br>  Flew wild about, and scowr'd along the Plains.<br>  <br>     Then mighty <i> Stuffa</i>  threw his massy Spear,<br>  Which with its Errand pleas'd, sung thro' the Air.<br>  He aim'd it full at <i> Goran</i> 's shining Crest,<br>  But missing him, it struck his Courser's breast.<br>  A Crimson Torrent spouted from the Wound,<br>  And deeply tinctur'd all the Flood around.<br>  The Steed tho' tortur'd with the goring Spear,<br>  Would fain the Warriour thro' the Water bear.<br>  He heav'd his lab'ring Limbs, stretcht every Vein,<br>  Did every Muscle, every Sinew strain;<br>  His Mouth out-foam'd the Waves, his Eye balls star'd,<br>  And working Nostrils Death at hand declar'd:<br>  Then faint with toil and vast expence of blood,<br>  He with his Rider sunk beneath the Flood.<br>  <br>     Then was at <i> Belon</i> 's head a pondrous Stone<br>  By the strong Arm of raging <i> Bofar</i>  thrown.<br>  It lighted on the <i> Briton</i> 's Breast, beneath<br>  The Paps, and from his Body struck his breath.<br>  He straightway headlong fell, and <i> Esia</i> 's Wave<br>  Involv'd the <i> Briton</i>  in a liquid Grave. <br>  Next <i> Robar</i>  fell of <i> Berta</i> 's noble Line,<br>  Too bold the greatest Dangers to decline:<br>  Now an inglorious Spear at random cast,<br>  His Naval pierc'd, and thro' his Bowels past.<br>  He honour'd by his Birth <i> Sabrina</i> 's Stream,<br>  And by his Death rais'd silver <i> Esia</i> 's fame.<br>  Here <i> Dolan</i>  to surmount the rising Banks,<br>  Stuck fast his Spurs within his Courser's Flanks;<br>  The Steed against the Bank with fury sprung<br>  That high above the Water's Margin hung;<br>  But fell down backward headlong to the Flood,<br>  And lab'ring lay, and choaking in the Mud.<br>  Then <i> Arton,</i>  <i> Gamal</i> , and <i> Ormellan</i>  dy'd,<br>  And with their Bodys swell'd the troubled tyde.<br>  Next <i> Blanadoc</i>  for Arts and Courage known,<br>  And <i> Holan,</i>  wise <i> Testador</i> 's Valiant Son,<br>  And many more amidst the Waves were slain,<br>  Who strove to make the Shore, but strove in vain.<br>  <br>     Mean time their Friends had gain'd the adverse Banks,<br>  And march'd in Battle rang'd against the <i> Franks</i> .<br>  Near to the Hills, the <i> Franks</i>  retreating back,<br>  In order drawn, waited the Foe's Attack.<br>  Then Valiant <i> Arthur</i>  to his <i> Britons</i>  cry'd,<br>  Now, Fellow Soldiers, no remaining Tyde<br>  Is left to Guard the Foe; here, <i> Britons,</i>  see<br>  The way is plain that leads to Victory.<br>  He said. And straight he spur'd his fiery Steed,<br>  And thunder'd thro' the Plain with eager speed.<br>  As when a Falcon from the Airy brow<br>  Of some high Hill descrys the Game below,<br>  To truss the Prey so strong, so swift he flys,<br>  As if some Engine shot him thro' the Skys.<br>  So <i> Arthur</i>  with a noble Ardor past<br>  T' engage the Foe, and the first Spear he cast<br>  To Death's unwelcome Shades stout <i> Hago</i>  sent;<br>  The fatal Weapon thro' his Buckler went,<br>  Broke thro' his Armour oft in Battle try'd,<br>  And pass'd his Body thro' from Side to Side.<br>  At <i> Corolan</i>  he aim'd his second Spear,<br>  Which pierc'd his Head ent'ring above the Ear!<br>  He fell, and groveling in his flowing Gore<br>  Fetch'd one deep Groan, and after fetch'd no more.<br>  <br>     Then from amidst the Files <i> Grimaldo</i>  sprung,<br>  Nobly descended, vig'rous, bold and young:<br>  With all his Might his furious Spear he threw,<br>  Which from the <i> Briton</i> 's Shield in pieces flew.<br>  The Monarch all enrag'd with mighty Force<br>  His Javelin cast, which with impetuous Course<br>  Into his Breast past thro' his massy Shield;<br>  Faint with the fatal Wound a while he reel'd,<br>  Then down he fell, and stretcht upon the Ground<br>  Which with his ringing Armour did resound.<br>  Then <i> Boson</i>  stept out from the foremost Ranks<br>  A noble Youth born on <i> Axona</i> 's Banks;<br>  He rais'd his spacious Buckler in the Air<br>  And stooping down guarded his Head with Care.<br>  The <i> Briton</i>  saw him, and a Javelin sent<br>  Which might all farther Care of Life prevent:<br>  But <i> Boson</i>  seap'd, tho with a mighty Dread<br>  He heard the erring Death sing o'er his Head.<br>  <i> Conrade</i>  who next did to the Charge advance<br>  Could not escape with such a prosp'rous Chance.<br>  An Ashen Spear the <i> British</i>  Monarch sent<br>  Which on its deadly Message swiftly went.<br>  The furious Weapon did with Ease divide<br>  His Buckler's temper'd Plate and treble Hide.<br>  Then deep within his wounded Breast it sunk,<br>  And at their purple Spring his Vitals drunk.<br>  Strait on the Ground he fell no more to rise,<br>  And everlasting Sleep o'erwhelm'd his Eyes.<br>  <br>     Then did <i> Amintor</i>  and great <i> Tursin</i>  feel<br>  Deep in their wounded Veins the <i> Briton</i> 's Steel.<br>  Next <i> Raban</i>  and <i> Amansul</i>  near ally'd<br>  By the same mighty Arm together dy'd:<br>  These did when living to each other show<br>  The highest Strains of mutual Love, and now<br>  When dying both their Friendly Streams of Blood<br>  Were joyn'd, and mixt in warm Embraces flow'd.<br>  Then <i> Villa</i>  much admir'd for beauteous Charms,<br>  And not less famous for his splendid Arms,<br>  Who with applauded Brav'ry always fought,<br>  Up to the Charge his fierce Battalions brought.<br>  Then did the valiant <i> Frank</i>  his Javelin throw<br>  Aiming at <i> Arthur</i> 's Breast a furious Blow:<br>  Thro' the soft Bosom of the Air it went,<br>  And in the <i> Briton</i> 's Shield its Fury spent.<br>  The King enrag'd strait cast his glitt'ring Dart<br>  Which thro' his Shield and Breast transfixt his Heart:<br>  The noble <i> Frank</i>  in strong Convulsions lay,<br>  Wallowing in Gore, and Gasping Life away:<br>  His swimming Eyes grew dim, and suddain Night<br>  Her sable Curtain drew before his Sight.<br>  <br>     And now the <i> Franks</i>  with vengeful Fury warm'd,<br>  In numerous Throngs about the Monarch swarm'd.<br>  Bright Showers of Darts did on his Buckler ring,<br>  And bearded Arrows all around him sing.<br>  <i> Arthur</i>  enrag'd, resolv'd to force the Foe,<br>  To break their Ranks, and cut his Passage thro.<br>  He now no longer missive Weapons threw,<br>  But from his Side broad Caliburno drew.<br>  Above his Head he wav'd the glorious Blade,<br>  Which dreadful Flashes thro' the Air convey'd.<br>  And then advancing with a mighty stride,<br>  Did force his Passage, and the Files divide.<br>  As when a River is oblig'd to stay,<br>  Oppos'd by some new Mound that dams its Way:<br>  Th' obstructed Tyde swoln with its Fury stands,<br>  And to its Aid calls its wat'ry Bands.<br>  Recruited thus the River leans, and heaves,<br>  And shoves against the Bank with all its Waves:<br>  Which having broken, with resistless Force<br>  It roars along, and runs with swifter Course.<br>  So <i> Arthur</i> 's Rage resisted higher rose,<br>  And scatt'ring all who did his Arms oppose<br>  He thro' their Ranks with double Fury flew,<br>  And their <i> Brigades</i>  with greater Havock slew,<br>  Such was the Conq'rour's rapid Course, that Fate<br>  Could scarce attend, and almost came too late.<br>  While Vict'ry almost spent, and out of Wind<br>  Flew heavily along, and panting lag'd behind.<br>  <i> Ansegius</i>  when he saw the Monarch nigh,<br>  Shaking with Pannic Fear began to fly.<br>  The <i> British</i>  King pursu'd him o'er the Sand,<br>  His mighty Sword uplifted in his Hand.<br>  The flying <i> Frank</i>  finding his Vigor spent,<br>  And that his Flight could not his Fate prevent,<br>  Turn'd back, and trembling on the Ground he kneel'd,<br>  And threw upon the Sand his Sword and Shield:<br>  Then while his Hands he spread out in the Air,<br>  And did his Words to beg his Life prepare,<br>  His Head flew mut'ring from his sever'd Neck,<br>  And in the Dust seem'd eager still to speak.<br>  So when the timerous Game from far descrys<br>  Th' invading Falcon stooping from the Skys,<br>  Upon the Prey so swift is his Descent,<br>  It do's its Crys and almost Fears prevent.<br>  <br>     Then <i> Huban</i>  glorying in his noble Blood,<br>  Boldly the conqu'ring <i> Briton</i> 's Course withstood.<br>  But strait the Warriour on his Crest did feel<br>  The Weight and Force of <i> Arthur</i> 's massy Steel;<br>  With the vast Blow of the broad Fauchion stun'd<br>  The <i> Frank</i>  fell down, and prest the trembling Ground.<br>  <i> Arthur</i>  advanc'd and thus the <i> Frank</i>  bespoke<br>  Before his Arm discharg'd a second Stroke.<br>  <br>      <i> Huban,</i>  what Widows Plaints, what woful Crys<br>  Of Orphans made by thee, have fill'd the Skys?<br>  Thou unprovok'd, with Fire and Sword hast past<br>  Thro' Peaceful States, and laid rich Countrys wast.<br>  What pop'lous Towns and Citys hast thou burn'd,<br>  What Towers and Domes to heaps of Rubbish turn'd?<br>  How has thy Sword thy Neighbours round alarm'd,<br>  And slain their Youth when naked and unarm'd?<br>  This Cruelty thy bloody hand has shown<br>  To please King <i> Clotar</i> 's Fury, and thy own.<br>  I'll now extinguish thy unnatural Thirst<br>  Of humane Blood; That said, the Monarch thrust<br>  Deep in his panting Breast his mighty Sword,<br>  And left upon the Ground th' extended Lord.<br>  <br>     Then <i> Obal,</i>  <i> Rodan</i> , and <i> Gutaro</i>  fell,<br>  And <i> Oroman</i>  who did in Arts excel.<br>  <i> Ocar</i>  and <i> Nisan</i>  lay in Dust and Gore,<br>  And great <i> Alcador,</i>  and vast numbers more<br>  Whose Vulgar Names appear in no Record,<br>  Dy'd by the mighty <i> Briton</i> 's Conq'ring Sword.<br>  As when a Craggy Rock, that did appear<br>  Still falling while suspended in the Air,<br>  By washing Showers and frequent Tempests worn,<br>  Or by some inward strong Convulsion torn,<br>  Breaks off, and falling from the Mountain's top,<br>  Rolls down the Wood beneath without a stop;<br>  It overturns the Forest in it's way,<br>  Nor can the strongest Oaks it's Progress stay.<br>  Elms rooted up and broken Pines around,<br>  (Amazing Desolation) spread the ground.<br>  The <i> British</i>  King advanc'd with such a force,<br>  And no less Spoils adorn'd his rapid course.<br>  <br>     Mean time King <i> Clotar</i>  who in Armour shone<br>  Of polish'd Plate, led his Battalions on.<br>  Around his Head his crested Helm was lac'd,<br>  And on his Arm his blazing Target brac'd;<br>  Which o'er the Field, amazing to behold,<br>  Shone like a glowing Orb of melted Gold.<br>  Fir'd with excessive Rage he did advance,<br>  And shook from far his formidable Lance.<br>  Then mounted in his high Refulgent Car,<br>  He plung'd with loosen'd Reins amidst the War.<br>  Brave <i> Gisan</i>  first did in his Bosom feel<br>  The deadly force of his projected Steel:<br>  Down to the ground the wounded Warriour came,<br>  And by his fall advancd the Conq'rour's fame.<br>  Another Spear at <i> Roderic</i>  he threw,<br>  Which thro' his Shield, his Head, and Helmet flew.<br>  The noble <i> Briton</i>  stretcht upon the ground<br>  And felt departing Life Ebb from his Wound:<br>  He gather'd up his quiv'ring knees, and strait<br>  He stretcht them out, and yielded to his fate.<br>  <br>     Bold <i> Gotric</i>  next did in the Front appear,<br>  Resolv'd to stand the mark of <i> Clotar</i> 's Spear:<br>  With mighty Vigor he his Weapon cast;<br>  It flew, and hiss'd with fury as it past.<br>  It struck the Shield, but by unhappy chance<br>  Did from the brazen Brim obliquely glance.<br>  But that his Message might not be in vain,<br>  By its refracted stroke was <i> Ruthen</i>  slain,<br>  And lay extended on the dusty Plain.<br>  Where <i> Clotar</i>  stood <i> Ruthen</i>  was always near,<br>  No Courtier more was to his Master dear.<br>  With him the Monarch did the Secrets trust<br>  Both of his Cruelty, and of his Lust.<br>  The noblest <i> Franks</i>  did by his Ponyard bleed,<br>  Whose Doom by <i> Clotar</i>  had been first decreed.<br>  Or he the poison'd Bowl bore in his hand,<br>  If bloodless Death his Master did command.<br>  The fairest Women to his Bed he brought,<br>  By Force, or Fraud, or by his Silver bought.<br>  By <i> Ruthen</i> 's fall King <i> Clotar</i>  all enrag'd,<br>  His utmost strength in deep Revenge engag'd.<br>  With his extended Arm his Dart he cast,<br>  Which as a Bolt of Thunder swiftly past.<br>  On <i> Gotric</i> 's Shield the hissing Vengeance fell,<br>  Nor could the temper'd Steel its force repel.<br>  Thro' Plates and Plys and Hides it's way it made,<br>  And in his brawny Thigh the Weapon staid.<br>  The Bearded Plague stuck in his wounded Veins,<br>  And rack'd the Hero with tormenting Pains.<br>  Down on his Knees he fell as in a Trance,<br>  The haughty Victor fiercely did advance<br>  To strike his head off, when brave <i> Cutar</i>  broke<br>  Thro' the thick Files, to ward the furious Stroke: <br>  He took the Monarch's blow upon his Shield;<br>  A suddain shout rung thro' th' applauding Field.<br>  <br>     Then <i> Cutar,</i>  <i> Clotar</i> 's progress to arrest,<br>  Discharg'd a noble Blow against his Crest;<br>  The <i> Frank</i>  receiv'd it on his temper'd Shield,<br>  But stagger'd with the stroke, and backward reel'd.<br>  Mean time brave <i> Gotric</i>  had new Spirits gain'd,<br>  Reviving from his Swoon, and then sustain'd<br>  Both by his faithful Friends and faithful Spear<br>  Retir'd in Pain, and halted to the Rear.<br>  <i> Gibbonius</i>  thro' all <i> Britain</i> 's Isle admir'd<br>  As one with <i> Æsculapian</i>  Skill inspir'd,<br>  Prescrib'd a nobler Balm to heal the Wound<br>  Then that the famous <i> Locatella</i>  found.<br>  King <i> Clotar</i>  soon recover'd, and for Fight<br>  Collected all his Rage, and all his Might.<br>  As when a Lyon roaming o'er the Plains<br>  Is stop'd by Huntsmen, and surrounding Swains,<br>  If wounded once by some advent'rous Spear,<br>  He sees his blood upon the Ground appear,<br>  Straight double fury gathers in his Eyes,<br>  And on the Foe with double force he flys.<br>  So with a fiercer Fire the Monarch burn'd,<br>  And to the War with greater Rage return'd.<br>  Then with his mighty Spear he did Assail<br>  His valiant Foe; nor Shield, nor Coat of Mail<br>  Nor harden'd Cuirass could its fury stay,<br>  Till glancing on the Ribs it flew away.<br>  The <i> Briton</i>  felt the Wound within his Side,<br>  And all his Limbs the streaming Purple dy'd.<br>  The noble Leader rag'd at this Defeat,<br>  But Loss of Blood oblig'd him to retreat.<br>  <br>     Next valiant <i> Horan</i>  did the <i> Frank</i>  engage,<br>  Fam'd for his Arms and splendid Equipage:<br>  He from the flowry Banks of <i> Isis</i>  came,<br>  To win in <i> Gallic</i>  Fields heroic Fame.<br>  But in those Fields the Combatant was slain<br>  Unable <i> Clotar</i> 's Fury to sustain.<br>  Then Valiant <i> Malgo</i>  shook his pondrous Lance,<br>  And bad his bold <i> Dimetian</i>  Troops advance.<br>  He bravely march'd the foremost of the Band,<br>  And charging boldly made a noble Stand.<br>  As when the Rocky Fragments standing up<br>  In a rude Channel oft the Torrent stop<br>  Which during Summer from dissolving Snows<br>  Down the rough Sides of some high Mountain flows.<br>  Obstructed thus the foaming Deluge raves<br>  And roars against the Rocks with all its Waves.<br>  So did the <i> Britons</i>  <i> Clotar</i> 's Course oppose,<br>  And in his boyling Veins like Fury rose.<br>  With high Applause great <i> Malgo</i>  kept his Ground,<br>  Till feeling in his Head a painful Wound<br>  Inflicted by a Dart which <i> Clotar</i>  cast,<br>  His Friends compell'd him to retire at last.<br>  <br>     Then did the <i> Frank</i>  with Sword in Hand invade<br>  The <i> British</i>  Ranks, and vast Destruction made.<br>  Now grisly Death with Crimson Garlands crown'd,<br>  In horrid Triumph reign'd, while all the Ground<br>  With Helmets, Shields and broken Spears was spread,<br>  With ghastly Spoils, and slaughter'd Heaps of Dead.<br>  When famous <i> Shobar</i>  with his watchful Eye<br>  Perceiv'd the <i> British</i>  Troops begin to ply,<br>  Highly enrag'd, he call'd aloud to those<br>  Who did his own select Brigade compose,<br>  See, where your Countrymen begin to yield,<br>  And fearing <i> Clotar</i> 's Arms forsake the Field.<br>  Let us advance our Ensigns, to sustain<br>  Our stagg'ring Friends, till they their Ground regain.<br>  With this Applause the

 was amaz'd to see its Flood<br>  As once <i> Egyptian</i>  Rivers turn'd to Blood;<br>  I would not doubt King <i> Clotar</i>  to subdue,<br>  Whose conq'ring Arms our yielding Friends pursue.<br>  But since his Sword such Numbers have destroy'd,<br>  And <i> Arthur</i> 's Arms we see elsewhere employ'd;<br>  I'll stay no longer a Spectator here,<br>  But with King <i> Clotar</i>  will exchange

reeking Hands in slaughter'd Christians Blood,<br>  Who thro' their Towns with Hellish Fury past,<br>  And laid with Fire and Sword their Dwellings wast,<br>  Chose fifty <i> Gauls</i>  of equal Strength and Rage,<br>  Who did themselves in dreadful Oaths engage,<br>  Ne'er Children Wives or Lands to see again,<br>  Till they had first the mighty <i> Shobar</i>  slain.<br>  And when they saw where his stout Squadron staid<br>  They to this Thicket strait themselves convey'd:<br>  That if his Squadron should advance this Way<br>  They with united Arms might <i> Shobar</i>  slay.<br>  Now as the Warriour near the Thicket past<br>  Marching to aid his Friends with eager Hast,<br>  The <i> Gallic</i>  Foes did from their Ambush spring,<br>  And all at once their furious Javelins sling.<br>  Then with loud Clamour they did onward rush,<br>  And with unequal Force the Hero crush,<br>  While <i> Shobar</i>  rais'd his Shield and stood inclin'd,<br>  Th' Ignoble Foe <i> Morander</i>  came behind,<br>  And pierc'd between his Armours Skirts his Reins,<br>  And left the Javelin in his bleeding Veins.<br>  Great <i> Shobar</i>  wounded with th' inglorious Thrust,<br>  Fell down, and lay besmear'd with Gore and Dust.<br>  A while he lay convuls'd upon the Ground<br>  While his warm Life gush'd from the treacherous Wound.<br>  His warlike Soul flew up to take its

with his Fauchion struck off <i> Moloc</i> 's Head.<br>  Thus <i> Shobar</i>  fell unable to withstand<br>  The suddain Charge of such a desp'rate Band.<br>  The <i> Britons</i>  rav'd to see him lying slain<br>  By ignominious Arms upon the Plain.<br>  And to revenge so great a Captain's Fall,<br>  With utmost Rage they charg'd the treach'rous <i> Gaul</i> <br>  Th' amaz'd Conspirators the Fight forsook,<br>  And their swift Flight back to the Thicket took.<br>  <i> Gravellan</i>  close pursu'd with Sword in Hand,<br>  And such a Slaughter made that of the Band<br>  Which made the

ring on Shields, Fauchions with Fauchions clash<br>  And Flames from clatt'ring Arms, like Lightning, flash.<br>  Thick Clouds of Dust obscure th' astonish'd Skys,<br>  And on the Field ghastly

maintain'd the Field,<br>  And to his Force the <i> Britons</i>  long did yield.<br>  Till aided by a fresh and strong Recruit<br>  They rally'd, and reviv'd the hot Dispute.<br>  The <i> Britons</i>  with their Troops encompass'd round<br>  <i> Gaston</i>  advanc'd too far on hostile ground.<br>  Archers their Arrows on the Champion spend,<br>  And clouds of Spears the shouting Spearmen send.<br>  Yet bravely still the <i> Frank</i>  his ground maintain'd,<br>  And on his ample Shield the War sustain'd.<br>  So when arm'd Swains on the fam'd banks of <i> Nile</i>  <br>  Beset a fierce, Voracious <i> Crocadile,</i> <br>  In vain their Darts, in vain their Spears assail<br>  His scaly Sides, and native Coat of Mail.<br>  On his hard Back they pour a fruitless War,<br>  Which strait recoyls, but can't imprint a Scar.<br>  So did the temper'd Steel unpierc'd repel<br>  The Weapons which on <i> Gaston</i> 's Buckler fell,<br>  Like an <i> Egyptian</i>  Obelisk he stood,<br>  Or as a lofty brazen Pillar show'd,<br>  Which grateful Citys out of high respect,<br>  To Princes or Victorious Chiefs erect.<br>  Thus stood the mighty Champion and defy'd<br>  The various Deaths which flew on every side.<br>  With proud Disdain he travers'd all the Ground<br>  Then stood, and cast his Haughty Eyes around.<br>  Aloud he cry'd, what have you not a Knight<br>  In Battle bold, and brave enough in Fight<br>  To come out hither and his fame advance,<br>  By being slain by <i> Gaston</i> 's Conquering Lance.<br>  Then let him come, let him his Valour try,<br>  And chuse the way by

Arthur</i>  advanc'd within a Javlin's cast,<br>  Then thus he Cry'd, <i> Gaston</i>  a Foe appears<br>  Not us'd to Idle words, but active Spears.<br>  Then from his Arm his mighty Spear he cast,<br>  Exploded Light'ning scarcely flys so fast,<br>  Which the strong <i> Hero</i> 's sevenfold Buckler struck,<br>  It past Six folds, but in the last it stuck.<br>  Then <i> Gaston</i>  with enormous fury burn'd,<br>  And his Vast Spear with mighty force return'd.<br>  When to discharge the Weapon he prepar'd,<br>  He all his brawny Sinews strain'd so hard,<br>  Such strength employ'd to give a

folds the Point stuck fast,<br>  And not the middle of its thickness past.<br>  A shiv'ring Dread thro' both the Armys went,<br>  On either side they fear'd the vast event.<br>  Now from their Shields the Spears the <i> Heros</i>  drew,<br>  The next the <i> British</i>  King with Vigor threw.<br>  It pass'd his Shield, and passing did divide<br>  The treble Plate, and fourfold Bullock's Hide,<br>  Then pierc'd his Belly with a dreadful Wound,<br>  Which tore his Flesh, that clos'd his Bowels round.<br>  The <i> Frank</i>  no longer could in Combate stand,<br>  But threw his Spear and Buckler on the Sand,<br>  And held his reeking Entrails in his Hand.<br>  Off from the Field the wounded Chief did fly,<br>  And fill'd the Region with a dismal Cry.<br>  So when a bold <i> Rhinoceros</i>  in Fight<br>  With a strong <i> Elephant</i>  compares his Might:<br>  The noble Combate all the Forest fills,<br>  And Terror strikes thro' all th' ecchoing Hills.<br>  This with his Trunk invades, and every Blow<br>  Rings on the scaly Armour of the Foe:<br>  Who with his Horn do's on th' Assailant rush,<br>  And makes a furious but a fruitless push.<br>  The Warriours long a doubtful Fight maintain,<br>  And spend a thousand noble Strokes in vain.<br>  Till the <i> Rhinoceros</i>  do's gore by chance<br>  The Foe's soft Belly with his Horny Lance.<br>  Then do's the Monster roar in tort'ring Pain,<br>  And flying drags his Entrails o'er the Plain.<br>  <br>     Mean time King <i> Clotar</i>  with his massy Spear<br>  His Passage to the Quarter strove to clear,<br>  Where the <i> Britannic</i>  King victorious stood,<br>  And murth'ring <i> Caliburno</i>  reek'd in Blood.<br>  But as the raging Monarch swiftly past<br>  High in the Chariot, valiant <i> Maca</i>  cast<br>  His

him to the Rear.<br>  <br>     Soon as the <i> Franks</i>  observ'd their Chief's defeat<br>  And saw their Monarch from the Field retreat,<br>  Their scatter'd Troops dismaid began to yield,<br>  And

ceas'd.

State;<br>  Which forc'd him to forsake the <i> Gallic</i>  Soil,<br>  To re-establish Peace in <i> Albion</i> 's Isle.<br>  Then from his Princely Seat King <i> Arthur</i>  rose<br>  Intending <i> Albion</i> 's Tumults to compose.<br>  <br>     Now did the Morn her radiant Lap display,<br>  And gently on the Air shook forth the Day.<br>  When strait the King his Chariot did demand,<br>  And took his Way to the <i> Neustrasian</i>  Strand.<br>  Valiant <i> Gravellan</i>  did his Prince attend,<br>  And faithful <i> Lucius</i>  <i> Arthur</i> 's bosom Friend.<br>  Soon as they reach'd the Shore without Delay<br>  They all embark'd, and strait stood out to Sea.<br>  The bounding Vessel ran before the Wind,<br>  Leaving <i> Neustrasia</i> 's Rocks and Towers behind.<br>  And when the rising Sun dispell'd the Night,<br>  The <i> Regnian</i>  Strand appear'd within their Sight.<br>  Soon as they came on Shore they took the Way<br>  To <i> Domar</i> 's <i> Castle</i> , there resolv'd to stay,<br>  Till brave <i> Gravellan</i>  should return, who sent<br>  To learn the State of things t' <i> Augusta</i>  went,<br>  And down from thence his chiefest Frinds to bring<br>  Fit to assist and to advise the King.<br>  Thrice had th' unweary'd Sun his Chariot driv'n<br>  O'er the wide Plains and trackless Wast of Heav'n.<br>  When the wise Lord return'd, and with him came<br>  The

Urg'd by Affection and a Loyal Zeal,<br>  The Cause of our Distractions I'll reveal.<br>  The Liberty Sectarians have enjoy'd<br>  By your Indulgence, has our Peace destroy'd. <br>  At first they cry'd, Indulgence would content,<br>  Ease they demanded, but Dominion meant.<br>  For since from Punishment they live secure,<br>  And dread no more an unarm'd Church's Power,<br>  They now disclose

they know not how to use,<br>  But gentle Monarchs favours still abuse.<br>  Peevish, Illnatur'd, Proud and Arrogant<br>  They crave still more, and still more Merit vaunt.<br>  Those who to give a troubled Kingdom Ease<br>  Cherish these restless Sects, do but release<br>  Outragious Winds to calm th' unquiet Seas.<br>  Such call the Foe in, to Protect the Town,<br>  Or dig before the Flood their Fences down.<br>  This Pious Prince is sad <i> Britannia</i> 's fate<br>  While Sects let loose disturb our Church and State.<br>  Cheer'd with indulgent Rays the monstrous Brood<br>  Like

the Deed, and own the Fault.<br>  I know th' Ambitious Race, they only claim<br>  The Right of Subjects, but at Empire aim.<br>  Which when they grasp, they Cruel Tyrants grow<br>  And unknown Rigour to their Subjects show.<br>  They lash with Scorpions, who complain'd before<br>  Of the mild Whips that show'd the Churches Power.<br>  With Tragic Clamours they for Freedom strive,<br>  Which they when Masters ne'er to others give.<br>  The Church's temperate Empire they destroy,<br>  That they themselves a wider may enjoy.<br>  'Tis not in point of Power we disagree,<br>  But who should be the

Her Sons too far transported with their Rage,<br>  For her Protection now in Arms engage.<br>  The Trait'rous Deed all highly must condemn,<br>  But would you soon th' impetuous Torrent stem,<br>  Would you at once the threatning Troops disarm,<br>  Which o'er <i> Brittania</i> 's troubled Region swarm,<br>  Against audacious Schismaticks declare,<br>  With Vigor carry on the Pious War.<br>  Revoke th' Indulgence granted, and restore<br>  To <i> Britain</i> 's ancient Church her ancient Power.<br>  Her Friends whom now too much Resentment warms,<br>  Will at your royal Feet cast down

appease the Tumults which the State molest.<br>  Great Prince, do's fully with my Judgment suit;<br>  It lays the Axe home to Sedition's Root.<br>  The civil Broils which <i> Albion</i>  discompose<br>  From Fears and anxious Jealousies arose,<br>  Lest the proud Sects which kindly you protect,<br>  Should once their Empire o'er the Church erect.<br>  'Tis true, that some who with the Rebels joyn,<br>  Their Country's Fall, and <i> Gallia</i> 's Growth design;<br>  But if those Troops which for the Church appear<br>  Submit their Arms, the rest we need not fear.<br>  Now 'tis with Reason that the Church suspects<br>  The Growth of proud, morose, designing Sects.<br>  I've long observ'd their Pride and Arrogance,<br>  And what destructive Doctrines they advance.<br>  Where they prevail the Church is soon defac'd,<br>  Becomes a wild, uncultivated Wast.<br>  A horrid Wilderness wherein we see<br>  The monstrous Forms of howling Heresy.<br>  Where Grisly Schism, and raging Strife appear<br>  And raving Sects each other rend and tear.<br>  Where mad Enthusiasm and Discord reign,<br>  And endless Errors endless War maintain.<br>  These sad Effects their Liberty abus'd<br>  Thro' <i> Albion</i> 's Isle already has produc'd.<br>  Audacious Schismaticks with lawless Pride<br>  Affront the Church, and all her Laws deride.<br>  Now Heresy her odious Head do's rear,<br>  And fresh engender'd Monsters thick appear,<br>  Which run upon the Church with open Jaws<br>  And fasten in her Wounds their dreadful Claws.<br>  Ev'n ancient Heresys which once annoy'd<br>  The Church's Peace, but seem'd long since destroy'd,<br>  Now chear'd and warm'd by this indulgent Heat,<br>  Stretch out their hideous Limbs, and Life and Vigor get.<br>  Since the Rebellious <i> Britons</i>  but reveal<br>  In a Religious Cause an erring Zeal,<br>  And for themselves alledge they flew to Arms<br>  To save their Altars from the Foe's Alarms;<br>  I must for <i> Arman</i> 's wise Advice declare,<br>  As likely to prevent th' Effects of War.<br>  Th' Indulgence granted to the Sects revoke<br>  And thus Sedition's quell'd without a Stroke.<br>  <br>     He ceas'd.

down from above.<br>  The blest Restorer of undone Mankind<br>  With soft and mild perswasive Ways inclin'd<br>  The World his Heav'nly Mission to believe,<br>  And his bright Train of Blessings to receive.<br>  He us'd no other Force, no other Arms<br>  But Mercy's tender Crys and Pity's Charms.<br>  And all his Followers he oblig'd to be<br>  Gentle, and kind, and merciful as he.<br>  He gave Command they should in Friendship live,<br>  Patient of Wrongs, and easie to forgive.<br>  Mutual Forbearance, Meekness, Peace and Love<br>  Which fashion Men like the pure Minds above,<br>  He oft

pronounc'd Error or Unbelief,<br>  Just Forfeitures of Liberty or Life.<br>  He never bad his Church for Arms declare<br>  Nor taught the Rules and Stratagems of War.<br>  He never show'd them how Campaigns to make,<br>  How to defend, and how they should attack.<br>  He ne'er instructed them in future Days<br>  When numerous grown, what Bulwarks they should raise.<br>  What Forts and Cittadels they should erect<br>  The Church's sacred Frontier to protect.<br>  He came to save Mens Lives, and not to Kill,<br>  And therefore taught no Military Skill.<br>  No Models left of Arsenals to be

impending Ruin to prevent.<br>  What Patience, what amazing Fortitude,<br>  The God-like Man in endless Labour shew'd,<br>  <i> Britannia</i> 's Peace and Freedom to restore,<br>  To raise her Glory, and extend her Power.<br>  Many for this who dar'd in Arms appear<br>  Mov'd by their Gratitude, or by their Fear<br>  In numerous Bodys did the Camp forsake,<br>  And by Desertion left the Rebels weak.<br>  They now their Levity, and Folly mourn'd,<br>  And to their Houses and their Farms return'd.<br>  Amongst the Rebels hence disorders grew,<br>  And great Distrust and Contests did ensue.<br>  The Leaders saw they could no more depend<br>  On their rash Troops their Treason to defend.<br>  They found the <i> British</i>  Youth would never stand<br>  Against an Host where <i> Arthur</i>  did Command.<br>  <br>     Then <i> Morogan</i>  perplex'd his Servants sent,<br>  To call the Chief Commanders to his Tent:<br>  That they might all things prudently debate<br>  That to th' Important Juncture did relate.<br>  Straight to their Gen'rals high Pavilion came<br>  The Chiefs of highest Trust, and greatest Name.<br>  To whom the General thus himself addrest,<br>  <i> Britons,</i>  you see the Zeal which some exprest<br>  For <i> Albion</i> 's Liberty is soon expir'd: <br>  You see, what Troops are from our Camp retir'd.<br>  A fresh example here, brave Friends, you see<br>  Of the weak Vulgars Fear and Levity.<br>  Speak what you think a prudent Man should do,<br>  Shall we desist, or our Design pursue?<br>  Then many Chiefs did various ways suggest<br>  Which they believ'd in this Conjuncture best.<br>  But while in sharp debate they did oppose<br>  Each other's Counsel, great disturbance rose.<br>  <br>     Then <i> Adal</i>  who in Wisdom all the rest,<br>  And Eloquence excell'd, his Thoughts exprest.<br>  <i> Britons,</i>  with great astonishment we see<br>  The Wavering Crowd do's from our Banners flee.<br>  The Vulgar we by this sad Instance find,<br>  As Seas unstable, changing as the Wind.<br>  All our Affairs are now in such a State,<br>  As must oblige us to Capitulate.<br>  With any Terms King <i> Arthur</i>  will comply,<br>  That shall disarm a <i> British</i>  Enemy.<br>  His Heart is so on Foreign Conquest set,<br>  He'll easily what's done at home forget.<br>  He would abroad be for a Hero shown,<br>  Nor cares at home to know or to be known.<br>  To our Demands no doubt he'll soon assent,<br>  Domestic War and Tumults to prevent.<br>  The Terms on which I'm willing to agree,<br>  Are first an Universal Amnesty.<br>  That all who please may undisturb'd retreat,<br>  Or to their City, or their Rural Seat.<br>  And all who in the State have been employ'd<br>  Shall keep the Places they before enjoy'd.<br>  But all the Chiefs and Captains who declare<br>  They'll serve King <i> Arthur</i>  in his Foreign War,<br>  When they attend him to the <i> Gallic</i>  Land,<br>  They in his Troops shall have the same Command.<br>  He ceas'd. The rest fearing an ill Event,<br>  In loud Applauses gave a full Assent.<br>  So when the Dogs that chase a timorous Hind<br>  Which o'er the Lawns flys swifter than the Wind,<br>  Are at a fault, and now enjoy no more<br>  The cheerful Scent that lay so hot before:<br>  If some Stanch Hound who rarely do's mistake,<br>  In great Esteem and Credit with the Pack,<br>  Opens, to tell that he the

the rest they chose,<br>  In whom they all could Confidence repose.<br>  Who to the Castle where King <i> Arthur</i>  lay,<br>  To make this Overture strait took their way.<br>  Where they arriv'd during the great debate,<br>  About the measures to compose the State.<br>  Which ended, they admitted to the King,<br>  The Message told they had in Charge to bring.<br>  The Pious Monarch who his Subjects lov'd,<br>  By tender Mercy and Compassion mov'd,<br>  To win the Rebels hearts did soon agree,<br>  To grant the Universal Amnesty.<br>  Nor did he think it prudent to withstand,<br>  Those other Terms the Rebels did demand.<br>  That he henceforth might undisturb'd pursue<br>  His high design King <i> Clotar</i>  to subdue.<br>  That he his Forreign Conquests might repeat,<br>  And the Deliv'rance of the <i> Gauls</i>  compleat.<br>  For Crafty <i> Adal</i>  wisely did suggest<br>  That the chief Passion in King <i> Arthur</i> 's breast<br>  Was Liberty to <i> Neustria</i>  to restore,<br>  And free the Christian <i> Franks</i>  from <i> Clotar</i> 's power.<br>  <br>     The Messengers that from the Rebels went<br>  Back to their Friends were by King <i> Arthur</i>  sent.<br>  Where they their Monarch's gracious Pardon read,<br>  As was agreed, at every Squadron's head.<br>  That done, the Chiefs did all their Troops disband,<br>  And from Seditious Uproar freed the Land.<br>  Thus did <i> Britannia</i> 's jarring Discord Cease,<br>  And in its place return'd Harmonious Peace.<br>  So soon King <i> Arthur</i> 's Fame and Presence quell'd<br>  The Discontented <i> Britons</i>  who Rebel'd.<br>  As when a Heav'nly Angel comes to Chase<br>  Infernal Fiends from some Inchanted Place.<br>  Forthwith th' Inchantment's force is gone, and Hell<br>  No longer Aids the black Magician's Spell.<br>  Th' Imaginary Castles disappear,<br>  The brazen Gates and Bulwarks melt to Air.<br>  No Warriours more in Airy Armour stand,<br>  Griping prodigious Bucklers in their hand:<br>  Phantastic Monsters are no longer seen,<br>  But all the Pageant Horrors quit the Scene.<br>  The struggling Air throws off the Magic Chains,<br>  And strait appear sweet Meads and flowry Plains.<br>  So all the Terrours which did <i> Albion</i>  feare,<br>  At <i> Arthur</i> 's Presence vanish'd into Air.<br>  <br>     The <i> Briton</i>  who with ardent Zeal did burn,<br>  Back to his Troops in <i> Gallia</i>  to return.<br>  Now all things for his Voyage did prepare,<br>  And to protect <i> Britannia</i>  did declare<br>  What Lords he did invest with Regal Power<br>  In whom both Prince and People were Secure.<br>  <br>      <i> Olbar</i>  was first a mild and prudent Guide,<br>  Who o'er <i> Britannia</i> 's Churches did preside.<br>  Nor Care nor Pains th' Indulgent

charm'd,<br>  And the hot Bigots of all Sects disarm'd.<br>  By Moderation, Patience, Gentleness<br>  And Candor which to all he did express.<br>  He ever strove th' Erroneous to reduce,<br>  Who to the Church Obedience did refuse.<br>  But he Employ'd to set their Judgments right,<br>  No Force but Reason's mild but powerful Light.<br>  Resolv'd on Truth and not on Power to stand<br>  He did the

cross the raging Seas from Isle to Isle,<br>  And fly from Realm to Realm with endless Toil,<br>  To learn the State of Empires, and to know<br>  What busy Mortals say and do below.<br>  O'er the Terrestrial Regions thus I roam,<br>  And now from wandring there, am hither come.<br>  <br>     Th' Eternal to th' Impostor thus reply'd:<br>  In all thy tedious Journeys far and wide<br>  Hast thou observ'd my Servant <i> Arthur</i> 's Ways,<br>  That just and perfect Man who still obeys<br>  With chearful Zeal and Pleasure my Command<br>  And rules with equal Laws the <i> British</i>  Land.<br>  Whom I've anointed, Tyrants to destroy<br>  And proud Oppressors who the World annoy.<br>  To ease th' afflicted and relieve the poor<br>  And banish'd Peace and Justice to restore.<br>  <br>     Then <i> Lucifer</i>  reply'd:<br>  'Tis true King <i> Arthur</i>  in the Field succeeds,<br>  And by his Arms atchieves Heroic Deeds.<br>  His Zeal seems great to serve the Christian Cause,<br>  And his vast Labors have procur'd Applause.<br>  But do's the pious Monarch serve for nought,<br>  And Vertue's Cause for Vertue's sake promote?<br>  Is all this Zeal for pure Religion shown?<br>  Do's he pursue Heav'n's Int'rest, or his own?<br>  Do's not a steep insuperable Mound<br>  Rais'd by thy Hand this <i> Briton</i> 's Throne surround?<br>  Fenc'd thus about he do's the Foe despise,<br>  Mocks all their Rage, and all their Power defys.<br>  Do not Seraphic Squadrons aid his Arms,<br>  And guard his Camp against the Foe's Alarms?<br>  Do not the bright, divine Militia stand,<br>  Immortal Sabres flaming in their Hand<br>  Around this Fav'rite Monarch, to direct<br>  His Conduct, and his Armys to protect?<br>  Do's not the Angel of thy Presence lead<br>  His Armys forth, and his Battalions head?<br>  'Tis known he still attends him in the Field,<br>  And do's his Head in the hot Battle shield.<br>  He watches always with officious Care<br>  To guard his Life from the sharp Edge of War.<br>  He in the Front of Battle do's appear<br>  And shakes against the Host his dreadful Spear.<br>  He marches on before him to the Foe<br>  Divides their Files, and lets this Favourite thro'.<br>  No Wonder then he should such Laurels gain,<br>  And ride so oft triumphant o'er the slain.<br>  That vanquish'd Nations should receive his Yoke,<br>  For those that him oppose, thy Wrath provoke.<br>  In vain his Foes their hot Revenge pursue,<br>  He must prevail, till Heav'n they first subdue.<br>  Tho various Deaths in horrid Shapes convey'd<br>  On every side th' encircled King invade,<br>  Tho' Showers of Darts and glitt'ring Javelins fly,<br>  Hissing, like deadly Adders thro' the Sky:<br>  Tho' o'er the bloody Field Destruction reigns<br>  And loads with ghastly Heaps the slipp'ry Plains,<br>  <i> Arthur</i>  encompass'd with Celestial Bands,<br>  As if a God invulnerable stands.<br>  Those Heav'n defends from Danger are secure,<br>  And those it fights for, are of Triumph sure.<br>  King <i> Arthur</i> 's Arms immortal Wreaths have won<br>  By Power receiv'd from hence, and not his own. <br>  Th' admiring World profusely praise bestow,<br>  And worship <i> Arthur</i>  as a God below.<br>  In time they'll Altars to his Name erect,<br>  And ask his Aid their Kingdoms to protect.<br>  No wonder then the <i> Briton</i>  do's pretend<br>  Such Zeal for Heav'n, while Heav'n is such a Friend.<br>  But let it now withdraw its aiding Hand,<br>  And like impartial Judges neutral stand:<br>  Or let some unexpected Suff'ring prove<br>  His fam'd Integrity, and stedfast Love,<br>  And thou shalt find he'll curse thee to thy Face,<br>  And shew himself of Man's apostate Race.<br>  <br>     Then did th' Allmighty thus reply, to prove<br>  King <i> Arthur</i> 's Patience, Fortitude and Love<br>  To shew how much the mighty Man can bear,<br>  And how unjust these Accusations are,<br>  For twice seven Days thou mayst his Vertue try,<br>  Use all thy Arts to prove his Constancy.<br>  For that determin'd Space he's in thy Power,<br>  His sacred Person only I secure.<br>  <br>     The Prince of Darkness felt an inward Joy<br>  From Heav'n's Permission <i> Arthur</i>  to annoy.<br>  Down thro' th' aeirial Void he swiftly flew<br>  His deep Revenge and Malice to pursue:<br>  In mighty Wrath, knowing the time but short,<br>  He came, to make his terrible Effort.<br>  So when in ancient <i> Rome</i>  a furious Beast<br>  With Hunger pinch'd was from his Den releast<br>  A constant Christian Martyr to devour<br>  Condemn'd by some Imperial Monster's Power,<br>  He roar'd and ran with open Jaws to tear<br>  His Prey and pleas'd the bloody Theater.<br>  Th' infernal Prince from Heav'n's Cerulean Top<br>  Shot thro' the liquid Gulph, nor did he stop<br>  Till he had reach'd the thick inferiour Air,<br>  And saw beneath King <i> Arthur</i> 's Ships appear.<br>  In th' Atmosphear with level Wings he hung,<br>  And calld with such a thund'ring Voice, as rung<br>  Thro' all the Skys, and with its dreadful Sound<br>  Shook all the Rocks, and Shores, and Hills around.<br>  His dusky Ministers who Storms prepare<br>  And temper flaming Meteors in the Air,<br>  Who dress the Magazins of Hail and Rain,<br>  And whip wild Whirl winds round to vex the Main, <br>  The Engineers that in the troubled Skys<br>  Recruit exhausted Clouds with fresh Supplys,<br>  These their great Leader's Summons did obey<br>  And to receive his Orders hast away.<br>  To whom thus <i> Lucifer,</i>  see yonder see<br>  Amidst the Waves Hell's greatest Enemy.<br>  Aerial Powers make hast at my Command,<br>  And beat th' Invader from the <i> Gallic</i>  Land.<br>  On his tall Ships a suddain Tempest pour<br>  Sink him, or beat him to

Descending with the swiftness of the Dove,<br>  Approach'd King <i> Arthur</i>  with Celestial grace,<br>  And with Ambrosial Odour fill'd the Place.<br>  Around his head a gentle Glory shone,<br>  And thus the beamy Minister begun:<br>  <br>     The Powers of Hell their Angry Forces joyn<br>  T' oppose your Arms, and thwart your high Design.<br>  These did the Seas with this fierce Storm embroil,<br>  To beat your Navy from <i> Neustrasia</i> 's Soil.<br>  Your Arms, to try your Vertue, are delay'd,<br>  So Heav'n permits, and Heav'n must be obey'd.<br>  Know, by supream Command I now prepare<br>  To chase the Demons that infest the Air,<br>  Down to their Prisons, that the troubled Seas<br>  May rest enjoy, and the fierce Tempest cease.<br>  And when the Morn shall spread with dawning Day<br>  Her Purple Loom, and shoot her early ray,<br>  You'll <i> Thule</i>  and th' <i> Orcadian</i>  Isles descry<br>  Which scatter'd o'er the Ocean's bosom ly.<br>  Then steer directly to <i> Pomona</i> 's Shore,<br>  Where you will Terrors meet unknown before.<br>  Fear not this Isle and Dangers yet untry'd,<br>  Heav'n you invoke, and Heav'n will be your guide.<br>  Know, that the Prince of Hell has leave obtain'd<br>  To prove your Constancy, and now unchain'd,<br>  Th' Apostate with excessive Rage prepares<br>  His fiery Tryals, and his various Snares.<br>  That he in this great Combate may prevail,<br>  He'll bring the Pious <i> Arthur</i>  to Assail<br>  Prodigious Monsters all of dreadful Shape,<br>  From whom few Heros e'er did yet escape.<br>  When you to Combate these shall take the Field,<br>  Assume your Heav'nly Sword and Heav'nly Shield.<br>  Your Helm unpierc'd shall fiery Darts arrest,<br>  And your Celestial Plate protect your breast.<br>  In these

which Heav'nly Gardens yeild, receive,<br>  Th' Ambrosial Odour will fresh Vigor give,<br>  Your drooping Spirits cheer, and wasted Strength revive.<br>  But when your Arms Hell's Terrors have repell'd<br>  And with immortal praise fierce Monsters quell'd:<br>  Your Chiefest Danger still remains behind,<br>  From a fair Foe, who Murders while she's kind.<br>  A fatal Foe, <i> Fascinia</i>  is her name,<br>  Whose Triumphs Vanquish'd Kings and Chiefs proclaim.<br>  You may not stay and Gaze, but straitway fly<br>  The Sight of this perfidious Enemy.<br>  No Mortal Courage can abide the Fight,<br>  You Conquer when you're brave and bold in Flight.<br>  All who contend fall by <i> Fascinia</i> 's Charms,<br>  'Tis Fear must here protect you, not your Arms.<br>  Your diffidence the

Waiting th' appearance of approaching Day<br>  Resolv'd the Heav'nly Vision to obey.<br>  Th' Aerial <i> Demons</i>  from the Seraph fly<br>  Born off on rapid Whirlwinds from the Sky.<br>  The Winds no more insult the flying Waves,<br>  But for repose retreat to Neighb'ring Caves.<br>  The Sea subsides, and on its peaceful breast<br>  Billows diffus'd dispose themselves to rest.<br>  <br>     Now did the beauteous Morn serenely rise<br>  And open'd with her Smiles the Eastern Skys.<br>  The perfect Day ensu'd, when midst the Seas<br>  They had in view the clust'ring <i> Orcades</i> .<br>  Direct to make <i> Pomona</i> 's Isle they steer'd,<br>  Which near and easy of access appear'd.<br>  Soon did the <i> Britons</i>  see a peaceful Bay<br>  To guard their Ships her spacious Arms display.<br>  Where weary Billows did securely sleep<br>  Withdrawn to shun the Tumults of the Deep.<br>  Within the winding Shores they safely past<br>  Took in their Sails, and all their Anchors cast.<br>  A Chosen Band of <i> Britons</i>  went on Shore<br>  Who might Refreshments and Sufficient Store<br>  Of fresh Provisions for the Navy gain,<br>  Worn with their mighty suff'rings on the Main.<br>  Where many Nights and Days they had been lost<br>  Before the Men descry'd <i> Pomona</i> 's Coast.<br>  <i> Arthur</i>  in Person did the Men Command,<br>  Who from their Vessels leap'd out on the Strand,<br>  And boldly thence march'd up to view the Land.<br>  When in the neighb'ring Mountains did appear.<br>  Wild Swine and Goats and Herds of Fallow Deer.<br>  Their fatal Arms did the wild Game pursue,<br>  And soon abundant Store there Weapons slew.<br>  Then laden with their Spoil they turn'd their feet<br>  And came rejoycing to th' expecting Fleet.<br>  In foaming Caldrons some fat Venson boil'd,<br>  They Roasted some, and some on Coals they broil'd.<br>  Spread on the Shore they did themselves refresh,<br>  And prais'd the Swine and Deer's delicious Flesh.<br>  When they had eat and drank with toil opprest<br>  The Men dispos'd their weary Limbs to rest.<br>  <br>     Soon as the tender Morn began to dawn,<br>  King <i> Arthur</i>  for Devotion was withdrawn.<br>  While he his humble Prayers was offering up<br>  To Heav'n upon a Neighb'ring Mountain's top,<br>  The Prince of Darkness caught him up on high,<br>  And bore th' undaunted Hero thro' the Sky,<br>  But near a Mountain in a lonesom wast,<br>  Swiftly alighting, he the <i> Briton</i>  plac't.<br>  A mighty Dragon came down from the Hill<br>  Whose hideous Crys did all the Valley fill.<br>  The monstrous Beast was of prodigious size,<br>  Smoak from his Nostrils broke, Fire from his Eyes.<br>  His odious Feet resembled Harpys Claws,<br>  And the fierce <i> Crocadile</i> 's his bloody Jaws.<br>  Which when expanded did three murth'ring Rows<br>  Of Teeth his native Armory disclose.<br>  His Wings spread out o'ershadow'd all the Air,<br>  Wide as the broadest Sails in Ships of War.<br>  Hard scaly Armour to his Body grew<br>  For Ornament and for Protection too.<br>  Along he drew his mighty poisonous train<br>  Like crooked Rivers sliding thro' a plain.<br>  As on the ground the turgid Volumes rol'd,<br>  They all their Speckled Terrors did unfold.<br>  On did the vast, voracious Monster come<br>  With dreadful noise, denouncing <i> Arthur</i> 's Doom.<br>  Sometimes like heavy Bustards rais'd with pain<br>  He flew, and sometimes ran upon the Plain.<br>  Sometimes employing Feet and Pinions too,<br>  The Dragon both together ran and flew.<br>  The Beast with horrid noise advancing near,<br>  Th' undaunted <i> Briton</i>  pois'd his massy Spear<br>  Which strait projected with prodigious Might,<br>  From his strong Arm took his auspicious Flight.<br>  Dragon and Spear against each other hist,<br>  Nor could the Beast this stress of Death resist.<br>  For while he yawn'd and belch'd out dreadful Flames<br>  Amidst the Air in long impetuous Streams,<br>  Down his wide throat the Spear its passage made<br>  And buried deep within his Stomach staid.<br>  Down fell the wounded Beast with mighty sound,<br>  Shook all the Plain, the Woods, and Hills around,<br>  And beat his quivering Wings upon the ground.<br>  A Sea of loathsome Gore resembling Blood,<br>  Sprung from his Throat, and o'er the Region flow'd.<br>  <br>     Then did the raging Prince of Darkness bear<br>  Aloft the Conquering <i> Briton</i>  thro' the Air.<br>  But set him down amidst a shady Wood,<br>  Which in a wild, amazing Desart stood.<br>  Where only ancient Pines, and baleful Yew,<br>  Unwholsome Box, and mournful Cypress grew.<br>  The noxious Glebe did nothing else produce<br>  But poisonous Flowers, and Herbs of Magic use.<br>  Bald Toadstools, Henbane, Nightshade, Hemlock here,<br>  Abundant choice of Mischief, did appear.<br>  The Birds obscene which love the Shades of Night<br>  Frightful to hear, and odious to the Sight,<br>  Owls, Ravens, Bats, and all th' ill-boding Race<br>  Increast the Horrors of the dismal place.<br>  So black the Shade, so thick the stagnant Air,<br>  That no reviving Sunbeams enter'd there.<br>  Nothing but here and there a straggling Ray<br>  Which lost it self in wandring from the Day.<br>  Which serv'd not to Refresh, but to affright,<br>  Not to Dispel, but to Disclose the Night.<br>  Within the midst an antient Castle stood,<br>  Encompass'd with a Mote of reeking Blood.<br>  Wherein a dreadful Monster did reside,<br>  Who all th' attempts of humane Force defy'd:<br>  A Cruel Tyrant, of Infernal Shape,<br>  Whom none, who Fear her fury, can escape.<br>  Vipers, like those in <i> Stygian</i>  Caverns found,<br>  Swoln with black Gore, her meagre Temples crown'd.<br>  Her ghastly Eyes were sunk within her head,<br>  And Death-like Paleness did her Cheeks o'erspred.<br>  Her long, lank Breasts she o'er her Shoulders flung,<br>  Or to her Wast the loathsom Burden hung.<br>  Her shapeless Form no Words have force to tell,<br>  Black as the Night, and Horrible as Hell.<br>  The Monsters which <i> Sicilia</i> 's Seas defame<br>  If this appear'd, would gentle seem and tame.<br>  She brandish'd in her hand a poison'd Dart,<br>  Which Strikes desponding Mortals to the Heart. <br>  Fast in the festring wound the Weapon rests,<br>  And tears with pain their miserable Breasts.<br>  For death in vain the tortur'd Wretches cry,<br>  Still do they Live, but still they Live to Dy.<br>  None but the Brave conscious of Vertuous Deeds;<br>  Whose Courage from their Innocence proceeds,<br>  Are able to withstand her dreadful Power,<br>  The rest the Monster do's with Ease devour.<br>  <br>     No sooner in th' enchanted Wood appear'd<br>  <i> Britannia</i> 's Pious King, but straight he heard<br>  The saddest Accents, deep despairing Sighs,<br>  Bitter Complaints, and loud amazing Crys,<br>  Promiscuous Howlings, lamentable Moans,<br>  Outrageous Sorrow, and redoubled Groans.<br>  Clashing of Whips, hissings of mighty Snakes,<br>  Clancking of Chains, and noise of tort'ring Racks.<br>  Yellings of raging Furys, and the cry<br>  Of Men in dreadful Torments rend the Sky.<br>  Then thro' the Air Flashes of Light'ning past,<br>  And flaming Firebrands at his head were cast.<br>  Dragons of Fire flew swiftly thro' the Air,<br>  And ruddy Meteors shook their blazing Hair.<br>  Then murd'ring Ruffians leap'd out from the Wood,<br>  And grasping bloody Daggers threat'ning stood.<br>  Hell-hounds of hideous Forms, and dreadful Claws<br>  Ran roaring on him with their open Jaws.<br>  Pale shiv'ring Ghosts past groaning by, a sight<br>  Which humane Nature cannot but affright.<br>  These various Horrors did he see and hear<br>  Yet stood unmov'd, and ignorant of Fear.<br>  <br>     The Prince of Darkness all enrag'd to see<br>  The pious King's unshaken Constancy.<br>  To see him midst such Terrors fearless stand,<br>  Grasping his Heavenly Buckler in his Hand;<br>  Wherewith the Hero did with Ease repel<br>  The Rage of all th' united Powers of Hell;<br>  Invited dire <i> Anelpis</i>  to his Aid,<br>  Of whom both Men and Angels are afraid.<br>  Aloud th' Apostate call'd, and at his Cry<br>  The Castle's Brazen Gates did open fly.<br>  The Draw-bridge all with Plates of Iron wrought<br>  Fell down, and lay across the Bloody Moat.<br>  When from the Castle Gates a hideous Rout<br>  With mighty Noise and Outcrys issued out.<br>  The Marks and all the ghastly Shapes of Fear<br>  In their distracted Faces did appear.<br>  Consummate Horror all their Looks possest,<br>  And Consternation not to be exprest.<br>  They beat their Breast, and tortur'd with Despair<br>  Tore from their Heads their stiff erected Hair.<br>  Torrents of Tears they pour'd out from their Eyes,<br>  And fill'd the ecchoing Wood with dismal Crys.<br>  Then next the Hellish Fury came in Sight,<br>  And call'd forth all her Terrors to affright.<br>  She shook her Vipers, and aloud she roar'd<br>  Than Death more cruel, and as Hell abhorr'd.<br>  With horrid Port the meagre Monster strode,<br>  Poising her poison'd Dart all stain'd with Blood.<br>  Up to the King she march'd with furious Hast,<br>  And at his Breast her dreadful Dart she cast.<br>  Off from his temper'd Shield the Weapon glanc'd,<br>  The King with God-like Courage strait advanc'd,<br>  And brandishing his Fauchion in the Air<br>  T' attack the grisly Fury did prepare.<br>  Who straitway fled with all her odious Train,<br>  And in a Moment did her Castle gain.<br>  For she the timorous only can devour<br>  But flys the brave who dare resist her Power.<br>  <br>     With Spite and Rage th' Infernal Monarch swell'd<br>  When he the <i> Britons</i>  glorious Deed beheld.<br>  Then thus he to himself. Still my Design<br>  My Vengeance still this <i> Briton</i>  do's decline,<br>  He all my chosen Ministers defeats,<br>  And even <i> Anelpis</i>  from his Arms retreats.<br>  Yet still I'll try, unwearied I'll pursue,<br>  I will molest him if I can't subdue.<br>  This mighty Favourite of Heav'n shall find<br>  That I have Snares and Dangers yet behind,<br>  Milder in show, but of more fatal

Fruits in great Profusion lay around,<br>  And with their Golden Heaps the Tables crown'd.<br>  Plenty of Wine was plac'd; no nobler Juice<br>  <i> Ausonia</i> 's Hills or fertile <i> Greece</i>  produce.<br>  Music exceeding that of tuneful Sphears<br>  With soft harmonious Airs engag'd his Ears.<br>  Hither <i> Fascinia</i>  with her Train to eat<br>  Now from her gilded Palace did retreat.<br>  Her, <i> Lucifer</i>  had form'd and taught with Care<br>  How best the <i> British</i>  Monarch to ensnare.<br>  Telling that this would raise her Glory more<br>  Than all the Triumphs she had won before.<br>  Soon as she saw the Hero stand in Arms<br>  She smil'd, and call'd forth all her conq'ring Charms.<br>  Advancing near, the lovely Sorceress<br>  Did these soft Words to <i> Britain</i> 's King address.<br>  <br>     Tho you great Monarch are a Stranger here<br>  Your Fame is not, your Person's therefore dear.<br>  Faint with your Toil with Victorys opprest,<br>  Accept reviving Meats, and Wine and Rest.<br>  Make hast, and your exhausted Strength recruit,<br>  Conquest you've gain'd, and now enjoy the Fruit.<br>  Without Refreshment, and a due Repair<br>  Your mighty Limbs will fail, your Vigor wear.<br>  Your martial Genius for a time unbend,<br>  Some easy Hours in soft Enjoyment spend.<br>  Dangers you've born now tast these peaceful Joys,<br>  Divert your self with Pleasure's charming Voice.<br>  In this Retirement while you please to stay,<br>  All my Attendants shall your Will obey,<br>  And I my self will own your soveraign Sway.<br>  Here we'll advance the Name of <i> Albion</i> 's King,<br>  And in soft Peace your Wars and Triumphs sing.<br>  Then you again shall Martial Fame pursue,<br>  And in the warlike Field your mighty Deeds renew.<br>  <br>     She ceas'd. And from her fair enchanting Eyes<br>  Shot Showers of Conqu'ring Darts to gain the Prize.<br>  The <i> British</i>  Monarch view'd her beauteous Face<br>  Her tender Shape, soft Air, and every Grace.<br>  Speechless the Hero and astonish'd stood,<br>  And found an unknown Temper in his Blood.<br>  A painful Pleasure seiz'd his beating Heart,<br>  And in his Breast he felt and lov'd the Smart.<br>  The wand'ring Flame creeps thro' his wounded Veins,<br>  And all the Springs of Life the soft Contagion gains.<br>  He ne'er before met such a potent Foe,<br>  Nor did he e'er such Danger undergo.<br>  At last the <i> Briton</i>  fir'd with Love, reply'd,<br>  Amidst such Charms who would not still abide?<br>  Happy the Kings, happy the Conquerours are<br>  Who after all their Warlike Toil can share<br>  The Smiles of one who's so divinely Fair.<br>  Then to the Bower she led him by the hand,<br>  And strait to fill out Wine she gave Command.<br>  She drank the Wine off, and of Conquest sure<br>  Bid them a second Bowl for <i> Arthur</i>  pour.<br>  But when the <i> Briton</i>  took the fatal drink<br>  And stood upon the Precipice's brink,<br>  At last he recollected in his Mind,<br>  How strictly he had been from Heav'n Enjoyn'd<br>  In fair <i> Fascinia</i> 's Presence not to stay,<br>  But from her fatal Arms to break away.<br>  In hast the Monarch rose, resolv'd to fly<br>  Th' Enchanted Place, the Lovely Enemy<br>  Perceiving <i> Arthur</i> 's great and brave intent<br>  Fell on her Knees his Purpose to prevent.<br>  She with her Arms his Martial Legs embrac'd,<br>  And in the snowy Fetters held him fast.<br>  With Tears and Prayers and every moving Art,<br>  She labour'd to confirm his wav'ring Heart.<br>  The Pious Monarch undetermin'd stood,<br>  And felt Alternate tydes Command his blood. <br>  He would not Heav'n's high order disobey,<br>  Nor had the Power or Will to break away.<br>  Thus he a while maintain'd a doubtful Field,<br>  And tho' he did not Conquer, did not yield.<br>  <br>     Mean time great <i> Gabriel</i>  watchful of his Care,<br>  To give him Aid to break the fatal Snare,<br>  Cloath' d in white Air appear'd, and with a Cry<br>  Which shew'd the Monarch's Danger bid him fly.<br>  If thou he said wilt Life and Honour save,<br>  If thou wouldst prove above all others brave,<br>  No longer with this fair Enchantress stay<br>  Come on, and follow where I lead the Way.<br>  The <i> Briton</i>  rous'd with this divine Alarm<br>  Felt now a nobler Flame his Bosom warm.<br>  Upon the Ground the fatal Bowl he threw,<br>  And from the fair <i> Fascinia</i> 's Presence flew,<br>  Who with her earnest Crys did long pursue.<br>  The Gates flew open with obsequious Hast,<br>  Thro' which the Seraph and King <i> Arthur</i>  past.<br>  Now in th' Aerial Realms had Light and Shade<br>  Twice seven alternate Revolutions made;<br>  When <i> Lucifer</i> 's Commission was expir'd,<br>  Who from the <i> Briton</i>  all enrag'd retir'd.<br>  Him his great Guardian <i> Gabriel</i>  did convey<br>  Down to the Coasts where then the <i> Britons</i>  lay.<br>  <br>      <i> Gravellan,</i>  faithful <i> Lucius,</i>  and the rest<br>  For their great Leader's Absence sore distrest,<br>  From Place to Place, with Care and anxious Thought<br>  In vain their Prince thro' all <i> Pomona</i>  sought,<br>  They rang'd o'er Hill and Dale, and all around<br>  The Woods and Caves did with their Crys resound.<br>  At last o'erwhelm'd with Sorrow and Despair<br>  They to the Coast from whence they came repair;<br>  There to debate what Measures they should take,<br>  If they should cease, or fresh Enquiry make.<br>  Mean time the King amidst his Friends arriv'd,<br>  Whose Presence their desponding Minds reviv'd.<br>  With Wonder they beheld the Hero's Face,<br>  And did with Tears of Joy his Feet embrace.<br>  But when th' excessive Passion did abate,<br>  The King at large did to his Friends relate,<br>  What Dangers in his Absence him befel,<br>  And how by Aids divine he did repel,<br>  All the confed'rate Force and Frauds of Hell.<br>  <br>     The mighty Triumphs by the Hero gain'd<br>  His Patience, and the Labors he sustain'd<br>  In various Combates, all his Friends amaz'd,<br>  Who fixt with Admiration on him gaz'd.<br>  With Joy transported all congratulate<br>  His mighty Conquests and his prosp'rous Fate.<br>  Some did to Heav'n his wondrous Patience raise,<br>  Some did his Courage, some his Goodness praise.<br>  And all the Soveraign of the World ador'd,<br>  Who to the <i> Britons</i>  had their Prince restor'd.<br>  Whose powerful Hand assisted his Escape,<br>  From Dangers of such Formidable Shape.<br>  Then Meat and Wine they did prepare in hast,<br>  Which now the <i> Britons</i>  could with Pleasure tast.<br>  Refresh'd with Food the pious King arose<br>  And went his weary Members to repose.<br>  But first declar'd that when the dawning Day,<br>  From the cold Air should chase the Shades away,<br>  He would embark to make <i> Neustrasia</i> 's Coast,<br>  To lead against the <i> Franks</i>  the <i> British</i>  Host.<br>  <br>  <br>  Go to
