Like a wraith beyond the moat<br>  He stole, and vanish'd on the windy wold;<br>  And as he vanish'd, lo! a luminous star<br>  Rose in the heaven, and brighten'd as it rose,<br>  And broaden'd till the land was full of light.<br>  And one fair maid,--of sixteen summers she,--<br>  Lifting her lily face in white amaze,<br>  Thought, "Sure our blessed Lord is born again!"<br>  <br>  Athwart the wold, and o'er th' untrodden snow,<br>  Pass'd Merlin, a wierd shadow, without pause.<br>  Around him, as he went, the wind, with sound<br>  Of viols sweet and low, sang lullaby.<br>  Above him, in its orbit, moved the star,<br>  To marshal him the way that he should go.<br>  <br>  It led him to a donjon, perch'd aloft,<br>  Like falcon's eyrie, on a spire of crag--<br>  Black chasms in front, and at its base the sea--<br>  Sir Ector's donjon, in the western wilds.<br>  Beside his yule-fire sate that peerless knight,<br>  And read, from monkish page, the legend old<br>  Of the Nativity--the Orient Star,<br>  The mystic Magi, with their gift of myrrh,<br>  The God-child in the manger.  Dame Iseult,<br>  His spouse, with awe-dilated eyes, drank in<br>  The wondrous story.  At their feet lay stretch'd<br>  A shaggy wolf-hound, huge of jaw and limb;<br>  And nestling in the savage creature's fur,<br>  Round-cheek'd and ruddy, slept their latest born.<br>  <br>  No footfall--but, instinctive, both were 'ware<br>  Of an unwonted presence in the hall--<br>  Merlin's, whose ghostly shadow blurr'd the light.<br>  To good Sir Ector salutation brief<br>  The wizard gave--then with obeisance laid<br>  His burden on the noble lady's knees,<br>  Who call'd upon her saints.  The bands unswathed,<br>  Behold, the babe lay, like a folded rose,<br>  In slumber; but anon, roused by the glare,<br>  First crow'd, then whimper'd, till the pitying dame<br>  Broke out in yearnings as of mother-love,<br>  And caught him to her breast, and gave him suck,<br>  And cherish'd him thenceforth as her own son.<br>  And soon a priestly man, by Merlin sent,<br>  Baptized the boy, and ARTHUR was his name.<br>  <br>  Ere long the King fell sick, and while he lay,<br>  Sore-stricken, a marauding host o'er-ran<br>  His borders, and waged battle with his knights<br>  At vantage, and his subjects vex'd and slew.<br>  Then up spake Merlin: "King, no longer bide<br>  Prone on thy couch, but to the strife of spears<br>  Wend forth, in litter borne, if such must be,<br>  High on the backs of men; for if thy foes<br>  But see thee in the van, the day is thine!"<br>  <br>  So was it done as Merlin had devised.<br>  They bore the King in litter to the field--<br>  A royal presence, with a deathly face--<br>  And by St. Alban's, on a wild March morn,<br>  'Mid road and river, met a mighty horde<br>  Of Norsemen, and that day Sir Ulfius hight,<br>  And stout Sir Brastias, did grand feats of arms;<br>  And in the Northern battle Uther's men<br>  Fought and o'ercame, and all his foemen fled.<br>  <br>  And straight the King to London hied, and made<br>  Much joy of his success; but, smitten anew<br>  With mortal fever, three whole nights and days<br>  Speechless he lay, and sore his barons grieved,<br>  And help besought of Merlin in their need.<br>  <br>  Quoth Merlin, "Help is none--Heaven's will be done!<br>  But take this counsel,--at to-morrow's dawn<br>  Seek the King's presence, and, with God's good grace,<br>  His tongue shall be unloosed, and he shall speak."<br>  And on the morrow, when the rising sun<br>  Redden'd the east, and from the sloping hills<br>  Roll'd the mists upward, knights and barons went<br>  With Merlin to the King, and Merlin spake:--<br>  <br>  "By Christ, and the thrice-blessed Trinity,<br>  King, I adjure thee, make thy purpose clear!<br>  Shall Arthur, thy true son, when thou art gone,<br>  Rule o'er thy realm and sit upon thy throne?<br>  Before thy lieges all, and before God,<br>  Speak, my Lord Uther, let thy will be known!"<br>  <br>  And Utherpendragon turn'd him on his bed,<br>  And moan'd, and raised a ghastly face at length,<br>  In the blear light, and cross'd himself, and said:--<br>  "Before my lieges all, and before God,<br>  I bless my son!  God's blessing and the saints'<br>  Befall him!  He is king.  My work is done.<br>  But if he claim not this my crown and realm,<br>  Or make not good his claim, with knightly feats,<br>  And kingly wisdom, as befits my son,<br>  Perish my blessing--it is none of his!"<br>  <br>  Then suddenly Utherpendragon dropp'd<br>  Dead on his couch, as drops a canker'd pine<br>  When the bolt cleaves it, and all heads were bow'd,<br>  And all hearts sorrow'd; and with regal pomp,<br>  And long procession down cathedral aisles,<br>  'Neath pall, and floating plume, and level shield,<br>  They bore him to his rest.  And Igrayne wept.<br>  <br>  Then year on year in grievous jeopardy<br>  The realm remain'd.  For prince and paladin<br>  Made trial of their might, in deadly feuds,<br>  With plot and counterplot, through covert hope<br>  Of kingship; and the sea grew black with barks<br>  Of Vikings, that like kestrels round the coast<br>  Hover'd, and froze the people's hearts with fear.<br>  At dead of night the hills broke out ablaze<br>  With beacon-fires--wild Norsemen scour'd the plains,<br>  And drove the herds--and wives, that sat at home,<br>  Wept wearily for those that came no more.<br>  <br>  But, when the gloom was deepest, Merlin pray'd,<br>  Th' Archbishop Engelbert, who held his court<br>  At Canterbury, in his diocese,<br>  To issue edicts, bidding all true knights<br>  Repair to London, at the time of Yule,<br>  On pain of penance and anathema.<br>  "For peradventure, on that day," quoth he,<br>  "On which our Saviour Lord from heaven came down,<br>  God may vouchsafe a miracle, and show<br>  Whose head shall wear the crown."  The Primate did<br>  As Merlin counsell'd, and the barons came,<br>  Obedient, to the tryst.  The frosty roads<br>  Rang with the dint of hoofs.  Long trains of knights,<br>  Pages, and dames in litters, silken-draped,<br>  And pursuivants, in brilliant tabards, wound,<br>  Like party-colour'd serpents o'er the meads,<br>  And through the snowy passes of the hills.<br>  <br>  On Christmas-eve, at nightfall, a great host<br>  Encamp'd about the minster, and a troop<br>  Of holy men from tent to tent pass'd round,<br>  And shrived the knights, and left them pure of sin,<br>  And ready for the chrism, and for the crown.<br>  <br>  In clouds the Christmas morning dimly dawn'd;--<br>  Grey gloom'd the minster aisles; but ere the mass<br>  Was ended, an effulgent sunshine broke<br>  Through the east oriel, and all men were 'ware<br>  That by the altar stood a snow-white stone,<br>  Four-square, and on its summit, in the midst,<br>  An anvil, holding in its iron bulk<br>  A naked sword, along whose edges ran<br>  This legend: <b> "Whoso plucks me from my place<br>  Is England's rightful king.  Amen.  Amen."</b> <br>  Then shook the multitude with sudden stir<br>  Of passion, as the woodland summits shake,<br>  When, swooping from a cloud, Euroclydon<br>  The storm-wind strikes them; but the Primate knelt,<br>  And quell'd the growing tumult with his prayer,<br>  And, after, preach'd of peace and pure intents.<br>  <br>  The benediction utter'd, one by one,<br>  Princes and paladins he bade approach,<br>  And try their prowess on the magic sword.<br>  Then were gaunt arms of Titan strength outstretch'd,<br>  To which the sinews clung, like knotted cords;--<br>  Then was the sword clutch'd by as gnarlèd fists,<br>  As his that slew the Hydra.  Faces flush'd<br>  Purple, and foreheads became ridged, like backs<br>  Of Berkshire wolds; broad shoulders stoop'd and rose;<br>  Oaths, fierce as thunder-claps, were smother'd back<br>  'Twixt gnashing teeth--in vain, in vain, in vain!<br>  Immoveable within its sheath the sword<br>  Stood, its gold legend glittering in the sun.<br>  <br>  Then spake the Primate: "God's Elect is not<br>  Amongst you here this day.  Now note my will.<br>  Let ten true knights be chosen, of noble strain,<br>  And constant, day and night, keep watch and ward,<br>  Beside the stone and the miraculous sword,<br>  Till he shall come, who is ordain'd of Heaven."<br>  <br>  So said, so done.  Ten knights of noble strain<br>  Were chosen, five by five, to keep the watch.<br>  And the suns rose, and set, and rose again,<br>  And down the frozen aisles the winter's wind<br>  Blew shrilly, and the winter moon shone cold.<br>  And not a knight in Christendom but tried<br>  To win the sword . . . except the Elect of God.<br>  <br>  It chanced, on New Year's Day, a joust was given<br>  With open lists; and to the tournay came<br>  Sir Ector, with his handsome son, Sir Key,<br>  Just dubb'd a knight, and Sir Key's brother-in-arms,<br>  Arthur, a stalwart youth, straight as a pine;<br>  With eyes as blue and bland as the June heaven,<br>  Broad brow set round with curls, and royal mouth,<br>  Firm-shut, and strong.  These twain rode side by side,<br>  Scanning the silken litters as they pass'd,<br>  And chuckling, when the rose on maiden's cheek<br>  Deepen'd to damask at their saucy smiles;<br>  But near the lists, the scatter-brain'd Sir Key<br>  Bethought him he had left his sword at home,<br>  And pray'd young Arthur to ride back at speed,<br>  In quest of it.  This did he; but arrived<br>  Before the mansion, every door was shut,<br>  And window barr'd; Sir Ector's dame had gone<br>  To see the jousts with her bower-maidens all.<br>  Then Arthur stamp'd a hasty foot, and vow'd<br>  That not for want of glaive Sir Key should miss<br>  His jousting.  "To the church I'll hie, and snatch<br>  The sword they prate of from the wizard stone!"<br>  Wide open stood the minster doors, and deep<br>  The sacred silence; of the watching knights<br>  No vestige; tournay sports had lured them thence.<br>  Straight up the aisle young Arthur strode, and bent<br>  A reverent knee beside the altar step,<br>  And breathed a prayer; then pluck'd the magic sword<br>  Out of the anvil, brandish'd it aloft,<br>  And, without further tarrying, hurried back,<br>  Alert, to find Sir Key.  But he with awe<br>  Gazed at the golden legend on the blade,<br>  And call'd his sire, and cried aloud: "This brand<br>  Is mine, and mine, too, England's realm and crown!"<br>  Much marvell'd good Sir Ector; but in doubt<br>  Of what was best, to the Lord Primate went,<br>  And told his tale; who, when the jousts were o'er,<br>  Bade all the knights and nobles meet anew,<br>  Within the minster walls.  There question'd he<br>  By what strange sleight Sir Key had won the sword?<br>  Sir Key, with pucker'd lips and stammering speech,<br>  The truth avow'd.  "Youth," said the Primate then,<br>  Turning to Arthur, "since the skill was thine<br>  To take the sword, say, canst thou thrust it back<br>  Into its iron sheath?"  "Small feat were that!"<br>  Quoth Arthur, with a smile; and, stepping up,<br>  Into the anvil thrust the naked blade.<br>  "Now pluck it forth, Sir Key!" the Primate urged,<br>  "And prove thy right."  And bold Sir Key began<br>  To tug, to haul--and tugging, hauling still,<br>  The sweat-drops roll'd in rivers down his cheeks,<br>  And angry flashes glinted from his eyes.<br>  Then Arthur jeer'd him: "Nay, hast lost thy wits,<br>  Good gossip mine?  See, 'tis no more than this!"<br>  And, with the slightest twitch of fingers twain,<br>  Out came the sword, and a wild sunbeam ran<br>  Along the steel and lit the legend up,<br>  In diamond sparkles.  Then Sir Ector knelt<br>  At Arthur's feet, and hail'd him Lord and King,<br>  While bold Sir Key stood blushing, half in wrath,<br>  And half compunction.  But the asembled peers<br>  Look'd on, with lowering brows and sullen lips,<br>  Or mutter'd: "It were shame this nameless boy<br>  Should sit on Uther's throne and wear his crown!"<br>  And soon a conflict rose, and swords were bared<br>  In menace, till the Primate spake, and bade<br>  Young Arthur thrust the sword into its place,<br>  And tarry further ordeal, at the feast<br>  Of Candlemas ensuing--the ten knights,<br>  Meanwhile, to keep impregnable watch and ward.<br>  <br>  This did they, five by five, as at the first.<br>  And the suns rose, and set, and rose again;<br>  And down the frozen aisles the winter's wind<br>  Sang shrilly, and the winter moon shone cold.<br>  But as at Christmas, so at Candlemas;<br>  Save Arthur's only, not an arm was found<br>  To wield the sword, though from the Cornish hills<br>  Came Caradoc, a caitiff knight, of frame<br>  Like to Goliath's; heavy was his spear,<br>  As any weaver's beam--his stature huge,<br>  His rigid chest, a rock--on either fist<br>  Six fingers--on each monstrous foot six toes.<br>  This giant, with a thunderous laugh, that woke<br>  The echoes of the hills ten leagues away,<br>  Thrust back to right and left the puny crowd,<br>  As sheers a ship its course through summer seas,<br>  And, to the altar stalking, clutch'd the sword<br>  Contemptuous, as it were a baby's toy,<br>  And pull'd.  Loud laugh'd the multitude, to see<br>  The tawny Cyclops foaming at the mouth,<br>  Furious, because no whit the blade would budge.<br>  He pull'd with strength that would have torn an oak<br>  From its seven centuries' hold beneath the rocks--<br>  He pull'd till, spent and breathless, his eyes stood<br>  Out of his head, with wonder and despite.<br>  But Arthur, on a merry mischief bent,<br>  Pluck'd forth the glaive, and springing down the steps,<br>  Fenced at Goliath for a minute's space,<br>  With rapid cut and thrust, achieving thus<br>  The giant's downfall and discomfiture;<br>  For gibes and jeers, like whistling arrow-flights,<br>  Hail'd on him; till, with buffetings of all<br>  That cross'd his path, out of the doors he dash'd,<br>  Half mad, and like an evil hurricane,<br>  Rush'd howling homeward to his Cornish hills.<br>  <br>  But vain these portents of the Elect of God.<br>  The peers, obdurate, claim'd a new delay<br>  Till Easter, and the Primate, moved with hope<br>  By sage concessions to enforce Heaven's will,<br>  Ordain'd fresh trial on that holy day.<br>  <br>  And still the knights kept watch beside the stone,<br>  With pacings to and fro, till through the pane<br>  A blander moon shed silver on the sword,<br>  And the wind, wandering 'mid the pillars, brought<br>  Odours and omens of the coming Spring.<br>  <br>  But as at Candlemas, at Easter too,<br>  One issue, one resolve,--defeat, delay,--<br>  With strife amongst the noblest--gauntlets flung<br>  And lifted, ay, and knightly battle waged<br>  "A outrance," in the lists.  The Archbishop then<br>  Convoked the estates of Britain for the eve<br>  Of Pentecost, in ultimate ordeal;--<br>  Too long, he said, had England's realm remain'd<br>  Kingless, with peril gathering round the throne.<br>  <br>  So the suns rose, and set, and rose again,<br>  In slow succession, till the season turn'd,<br>  And to the knights in vigil came the scent<br>  Of beanflowers, and the smell of growing corn.<br>  <br>              *     *     *     *     *<br>  <br>  Over the pleasant meads, at Pentecost,<br>  The minster bells rang out a merry chime,--<br>  Over the bean-tufts, with their brindled bloom,<br>  Over the corn-fields, with their waving corn;<br>  No cloud in Heaven, and the long-harass'd earth<br>  Calm, with the foretaste of a rest to come.<br>  <br>  At gloaming, back the minster portals roll'd,<br>  And knights and nobles, in a stormy throng,<br>  Choked nave and chancel.  Vespers o'er, at once<br>  The Primate summon'd whoso dared resist<br>  God's judgment, thrice made manifest, to brave<br>  The final ordeal.  Then upsprang a band<br>  Of paladins, such as the world ne'er saw,<br>  Fit framers of the famous Table Round,<br>  Heroic shapes, that with untoward fate<br>  Strove, as the demi-gods of heathen tale,<br>  Strove in their war with Heaven--like them to fall.<br>  For vain their chivalry and pure intents--<br>  Vain strength of soul and strength of arm--all vain!<br>  Immoveable within its sheath the sword<br>  Stood, its strange legend burning like a flame.<br>  <br>  Then Arthur, at the Primate's bidding, came,--<br>  A youth as fair as he, who in the vale<br>  Of Elah, with a sling and with a stone,<br>  The champion of the Philistines o'erthrew,<br>  Before the hosts of Israel.  Meek, he knelt<br>  Beside the altar, while the priestly palms<br>  Were laid, in blessing, on his comely head,<br>  All cluster'd over with thick golden curls.<br>  "<i> King Arthur, God's Elect, draw forth the sword!</i> "<br>  And lightly stepp'd he, lightly drew the sword,<br>  And having drawn it, lo! a luminous star<br>  Rose in the heaven, and brighten'd as it rose,<br>  And broaden'd, till the fane was full of light.<br>  And in that sudden glory men were 'ware<br>  That, from their station by the altar side,<br>  Anvil and stone had vanish'd like a dream.<br>  Then swift emotion shook the hearts of all,<br>  Half awe and half remorse; and with a sound<br>  Of seas that surge, and sweep o'er shingly shores,<br>  A tumult grew and spread, and broke at length<br>  Into a vehement shout, "Long live the King!<br>  Long live King Arthur!" from ten thousand throats,<br>  Not one dissentient.  Through the minster doors<br>  The uproar burst, and fill'd the streets, and ran<br>  Like wild-fire through the town--beyond the town--<br>  For as the lightning speeds from cloud to cloud,<br>  So sped the gladness through the length and breadth<br>  Of England, till its every corner rang<br>  With universal shouts of jubilee.<br>  And the wind swept the shoutings out to sea,<br>  And paled the Vikings' ruddy cheeks with fear,<br>  And drove their black barks from the British main.<br>  <br>  So Arthur won King Uther's crown and throne!<br>  And when his seat was sure, and not a knight--<br>  Save caitiff Caradoc, the Cornish bear--<br>  But had sworn fealty, wizard Merlin told<br>  To him and to Igrayne his wondrous tale.<br>  Great joy had Queen Igrayne; her widow'd heart<br>  Wax'd warm with household cheer; but evermore<br>  To good Sir Ector and his dame the King,<br>  From old respect and dear familiar use,<br>  Clung, with the love and duty of a son.<br>  Sir Ector, his high chancellor he made,<br>  Sir Key, his seneschal; and when the dame<br>  To Camelot in early summer came,<br>  He saw, and ran to meet her from afar,<br>  And kiss'd her mouth, and kiss'd her wrinkled cheeks,<br>  And knelt before her, as had been his wont,<br>  For daily blessing in the years that were.<br>  <br>  Here ends the story of the magic sword<br>  Of Arthur, Builder of the Table Round.<br>
