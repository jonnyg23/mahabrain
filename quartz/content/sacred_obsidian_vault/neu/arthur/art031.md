But Launcelot said, <br>  "Not so, my liege: the best knight in the world, <br>  You do forget, is he shall sit unharm'd <br>  Beside me at the feast!  And he that strives<br>  To take that sword and fails shall get a wound<br>  Full sore to heal; for, see, its name is writ<br>  In precious stones upon the shining hilt." <br>  And Arthur read, in rays of diamond light, <br>  The one word "Justice," while Sir Gawaine strove, <br>  And then Sir Percivale, to stir the sword; <br>  But both their hands upon the weapon slipp'd, <br>  And stain'd its edge with blood, until the prince<br>  Forbade endeavor more.  "For thus," he said, <br>  "My own Excalibur defied all strength, <br>  Until my destined grasp the handle siezed. <br>  This too is fix'd by Fate, and he shall wield<br>  Its keenness rightly will be worthy sure<br>  To have us bow our heads to him.  And now<br>  Let's in to dine, and toast our unknown peer!" <br>  <br>  And, ere each lord was served in his own place, <br>  Came in an aged man, clothed all in white, <br>  And with him a young knight in crimson robed, <br>  Upon whose shoulders hung a mantle furr'd<br>  With royal ermine, -- whose beardless visage bore<br>  The smile of innocence, uplifted, calm<br>  With the mild majesty of one who knows<br>  None greater than his equal, yet who feels<br>  His own soul humble in the sight of God. <br>  And silent round the watching forms they walk'd<br>  Until the elder lifted off the cloth<br>  Laid o'er "Siege Perilous," wherein was writ, <br>  In letters bright as stars, that all could see, <br>  The name of "Galahad;" and that young knight<br>  Sat down therein, and show'd no sign of harm, <br>  The while his comrade bless'd him and went forth. <br>  Then bow'd the king to him, and all the knights<br>  Rose up, and gave him welcome with their hands; <br>  And, after they had dined, the monarch spoke: <br>  "Fair sir, I see the scabbard at thy side<br>  Does lack a sword.  Without, a marvel waits: <br>  Wouldst win a weapon, and thy rare right prove<br>  To fill that siege? for prophesy has rank'd<br>  Him 'best knight in the world' should sit therein; <br>  And so a stone proclaims that he shall take<br>  The blade therefrom shall bear the same proud fame!" <br>  Then Galahad and Arthur, side by side, <br>  Went from the palace to the river's bank, <br>  Where in his hand with ease the stranger held<br>  The trial-sword, and slid it in the case<br>  So smoothly that the good king, wondering, said, <br>  "Surely those two were for each other made!" <br>  <br>  And after jousting in the meadow's midst,<br>  Whereat Sir Galahad exceeded all, <br>  The court rode quiet back to Camelot; <br>  And, as they sat at supper in a maze<br>  Of listening wonder at this young knight's words, <br>  A sudden thunder crash'd across his speech, <br>  And shook the pillars of the hall; and sounds<br>  Of rushing wings stirr'd through the darkness deep<br>  That rested there an instant; when a light<br>  Six times more clear than beams of noontide sun<br>  Shone o'er them all, and glorified each face, <br>  So that they all upon their neighbors look'd, <br>  Struck dumb with awe, as through the silence rose <br>  Angelic voices; then an odor rich <br>  Fill'd their senses, and the taste of each<br>  Knew that was long'd for most and liked the best; <br>  While every soul felt such ecstatic joy<br>  That love's great bliss seem'd but the barren type<br>  Of this exceeding rapture; and then came<br>  Their breath once more, and all things look'd the same. <br>  Then whisper'd they into each other's ears<br>  That there had been the Holy Greal of Christ; <br>  Till Gawaine spoke aloud, and took a vow<br>  That, as its blessing came in part to all, <br>  Though fate ordain'd but one should fully win<br>  The dangerous quest, that, just to know again<br>  Such rare, high feeling, he would seek himself<br>  The Sacred Vessel, which perchance if seen, <br>  Its power might waft his soul so far from earth<br>  That it might float into the gate of heaven, <br>  Since but its unseen presence made them seem<br>  Like olden gods at their ambrosial feasts! <br>  Then rose they all, and with uplifted hands<br>  Echoed Sir Gawaine's oath; and Arthur said,<br>  "This promise smites my heart; for I do know<br>  Such quest will rob me of my dearest friends, <br>  And break the knightly fellowship we keep<br>  So fair and true that all the world admires. <br>  For never king has had such gallant peers; <br>  And never more shall gather at my board<br>  All those who leave me to my sorrow here! <br>  For kings must fret on thrones, while crownless heads<br>  Find Glory's laurel upon danger's field!" <br>  <br>  And when the lords had arm'd themselves, they met<br>  In the great court-yard, waiting by their steeds<br>  Until the king had brought the weeping queen<br>  To give their last farewell; and as the sun, <br>  Slow sinking, cast o'er all a golden light, <br>  They stood upon the palace-steps, both clad<br>  In sparkling jewels and their royal robes; <br>  And as, unhelmetted, with gauntlets off, <br>  The knights came singly by to kiss their hands, <br>  The quick sobs broke from Guinevere's fair breast, <br>  And more than once the shining drops fell down<br>  On some bow'd head; while Arthur, pale and sad, <br>  Would take no homage, but with tender clasp<br>  Press'd each to his full heart, and no one spoke. <br>  And when at last Sir Launcelot came anear, <br>  And held the ladye's palm within his own, <br>  She sank, half fainting, on her husband's arm. <br>  So Galahad but touch'd his maiden lips<br>  To fingers cold as ice, that listless hung, <br>  As wearied of the weight of their rich rings. <br>  At last, when crested helmets were all donn'd<br>  And bow'd in parting to the horses' manes, <br>  The knights together through the gateway rode; <br>  And Arthur watch'd them as their mail'd array<br>  Wound down the path, until on burnish'd shields<br>  The sun's last lingering rays no longer glanced, <br>  Then with a sigh bore in the drooping queen. <br>  And there was weeping of the rich and poor<br>  As through the streets of Camelot they rode, <br>  Where many a dame, with voice nigh choked with tears, <br>  Did send her prayers with that gay cavalcade; <br>  While ever and anon would leave the ranks<br>  A favor'd sir, to catch upon his lance<br>  Some scarf or token of his lady's grace, <br>  Cast off from balconies where fair forms lean'd. <br>  And so they journey'd to a castle's gates<br>  Wherein the lord made cheer, till in the morn<br>  They parted from each other, and all took, <br>  In pairs or singly, their own different roads. <br>  <br>  When many days had gone, Sir Gawaine met<br>  Sir Ector in the way, and both reveal'd<br>  That, after wandering long in beaten paths, <br>  Neither had found adventure that had seem'd<br>  To bring them nearer to the Holy Greal. <br>  "In sooth," quoth Gawaine, "I am weary now<br>  Of this new quest, and loath to follow it." <br>  "And so," said Ector, "all the knights I saw<br>  Upon my travels do complain the same. <br>  Nor can I hear of Launcelot or Bors, <br>  Or e'en of Galahad, the three we thought<br>  Were sure to make the world ring with their deeds; <br>  And truly, if they fail, not even we<br>  Need strive in further search!  Let's stop and rest." <br>  And so they enter'd in an ancient church<br>  That stood near by, and laid their bodies down<br>  Upon the altar-steps, and thus there came<br>  Into their sleep a marvellous dream to each. <br>  First, Gawaine thought he saw into a field<br>  Full strewn with herbs, wherein a rack of bulls<br>  Stood proud and black, save one, all snowy white, <br>  That ever kept its head bent down to graze; <br>  But soon the rest went from the meadow forth, <br>  To seek some pasture-ground they deem'd more rich, <br>  And came back lean and weak, yet would not crop<br>  The fresh, green grass their one wise comrade ate<br>  And strove to lead them to and fully share! <br>  But Ector dream'd that Launcelot and himself<br>  Sprang from one chair upon two saddled steeds; <br>  That one soon met Sir Launcelot on the way, <br>  Who beat and spoil'd him, and then clothed him o'er<br>  In knotted robes, and set him on an ass; <br>  That thus he rode until he came, athirst, <br>  To a fair well, and stoop'd him down to drink; <br>  But always from his lips the waters sank, <br>  Until at last he sadly journey'd on. <br>  And when the knights awoke, they told their dreams, <br>  And, as they talk'd, between them sudden rush'd, <br>  Vanishing quick away, a hand that held<br>  A clear light burning, and upon the wrist<br>  A plain, strong bridle hung; and then they rose<br>  To seek some hermit he could meaning give<br>  To these their visions. <br>                                          Ere they came anigh<br>  To the lone cave where dwelt the holiest man<br>  In all the realm, they met an arméd knight, <br>  Who kept the road, and so they drew a lot<br>  To joust with him to have their pathway clear; <br>  And Gawaine won, and ran his sharp lance through<br>  The stranger's breast, and bore him to the ground. <br>  And when they raised his visor, Ector groan'd; <br>  "For see," he spoke, "thy hasty hand has slain<br>  Our own sworn brother of the Table Round, <br>  That with ourselves set out on this same quest." <br>  "'Tis sad," his comrade said; "but then he stood<br>  So stubborn in our way: besides, his course<br>  Was towards the points we just have left behind; <br>  Thus turn'd, he never could have reach'd the goal!" <br>  And, as his soul departed, they went on. <br>  <br>  Then, as they came unto the mountain rough, <br>  They tied their coursers to a rock, and strode<br>  Across the stones afoot, until they reach'd<br>  A garden-patch, wherein a hermit stoop'd<br>  To pick the worts that served for his sole food. <br>  And when he heard the ringing of their mail, <br>  He turn'd his aged form and ask'd their need. <br>  So Gawaine told his dream, and counsel ask'd<br>  Of his great wisdom; and, without more words, <br>  He answer'd thus: "The herbs that strew'd the field<br>  Were Patience and Humility; the rack<br>  Was the Round Table, and the bulls its knights; <br>  The meadow was the world, and that white steer<br>  Was he shall keep himself so pure in life<br>  His eyes shall see the glory of the Lord! <br>  Those black were dyed with sins; and, as their heads <br>  Would stoop not down to taste the precious food, <br>  They shall on waste lands enter, and find death!" <br>  And as Sir Gawaine ponder'd on this speech, <br>  The good seer read Sir Ector's vision too: <br>  "The chair ye left was pride, and, as your steeds<br>  Were higher, ye were so much prouder there. <br>  Sir Launcelot has been cast adown, and clothed<br>  In garments of repentance, and the ass<br>  Betokeneth meekness; but that fair well<br>  Was God's rich grace, that would not touch his soul: <br>  So now he journeys lonely on his way, <br>  Till in due time he shall go back, and quench<br>  His eager thirst within those waters clear. <br>  The hand ye saw was charity; the light<br>  Was hope; the bridle, abstinence, which holds<br>  The heart's desires and leads the will from sin. <br>  And as ye were not touch'd by charity, <br>  Nor long time lit by hope, and have not caught <br>  The reins of passion, and not yet have chew'd<br>  The cud of Patience, ye shall never meet<br>  The Holy Greal until ye win all these. <br>  Now go your ways!  Ye neither yet have done<br>  True service to your Maker.  As ye gave<br>  To folly all the leaves and fruit of youth, <br>  See that ye yield the bare rind to the Lord." <br>  And then he went from them into his cave; <br>  And both the knights, with eyes bent low, slow paced, <br>  Deep musing, down the stony steep, and loosed<br>  Their restless horses, and rode swift away. <br>  <br>  And all the peers that started on the quest<br>  Met strange adventures, and some got sore falls, <br>  Some fainted by the way, and many died. <br>  And some went back to Camelot, and lived<br>  In sloth and ease with lemans fair and false; <br>  But these King Arthur would not see at court, <br>  For, though he grieved at parting with his fréres, <br>  He welcomed none that broke a knightly oath; <br>  Albeit the queen in secret saw them oft, <br>  To ask if e'er they heard of Launcelot aught. <br>  <br>  Sir Galahad, the youngest of the knights, <br>  A stranger, and unproved in gallant feats, <br>  Rode by himself four days without a shield: <br>  His heart was tender yet with dreams of youth, <br>  And, as his life was nearer to his birth, <br>  His soul was closer to his God than theirs<br>  Who had forgotten heaven in the heat<br>  Of earthly conflicts mid the light of fame. <br>  He look'd on nature with such earnest love<br>  His rapturous delight to worship soar'd.<br>  His eyes grew gentler as he turn'd aside<br>  His courser's hoofs lest they should heedless tread<br>  To dust and death a daisy in the grass; <br>  And when, unarm'd, he slept in some cool grove<br>  At night beside his weary steed, the stars<br>  Shed down through stirring leaves a sense of peace<br>  Upon a spirit calm'd by trustful prayer. <br>  He knew no fear, because his conscience lay<br>  Like to a lake reflecting cloudless skies: <br>  Not one dark thing o'ershadow'd its bright rest. <br>  And if his mind dwelt oft on that high fate<br>  The seers foretold for him, 'twas with the hope<br>  That his high achievements might advance the cause<br>  Of Right and Holiness within the world<br>  He thought so fair, yet knew was foul'd by sin! <br>  <br>  Once, after even-song, he came at last<br>  To a white abbey, where he met a knight<br>  Of Arthur's table, who reveal'd to him<br>  That in this place was hung a wondrous shield, <br>  Which none e'er bore in fight and kept unscathed. <br>  "And yet," said Bagdemanus, "I will try, <br>  Because my arm is strong, and sure can keep<br>  By its own skill a shield before my breast!" <br>  So in the morn he took it from its place<br>  Behind the altar, and his comrade saw<br>  'Twas all clear white, save in the midst was limn'd<br>  A shining cross, red as if drawn in blood. <br>  And then he started on adventure forth. <br>  But, ere an hour, in haste his squire came back, <br>  Pale with the tidings that his master lay<br>  O'erthrown near by, and still beset by foes! <br>  And Galahad went out with his bare sword<br>  To where the wounded knight exhausted fell. <br>  He seized the buckler from the feeble grasp, <br>  And straightway was assail'd by countless shapes, <br>  Giants and dwarfs, and bravely stood his ground, <br>  Until at last he felt the storied shield<br>  Slow slipping from his hold, while they who thrust<br>  Their spears against it but the stronger grew<br>  When he look'd faint: so his tried soul cried out<br>  Aloud in anguish for God's gracious help; <br>  And at the sacred Name they sudden sank<br>  From his awed sight away; and then he saw<br>  That a great angel, ray'd about with light, <br>  Upheld his form, who bade him always use<br>  The shield of Faith, since wielded with true Prayer<br>  'Twould keep him ever from attacks of Doubts! <br>  <br>  And afterwards, as Galahad went on, <br>  He journey'd in a narrow path o'ergrown<br>  With thorns and briers, where he oft was forced<br>  To cut a way and lead his restless horse,-- <br>  Where poisonous vines with noxious smells made thick<br>  The darken'd air, for branches interlaced<br>  Barr'd light and progress, and from hidden lairs<br>  Glared fiery eyes at him, and stagnant pools<br>  Mock'd eager thirst. Yet still he onward toil'd; <br>  For this, the monks had told him, was the road<br>  Alone could forward him upon his quest. <br>  Sometimes he long'd to throw aside his arms<br>  And rest his weary limbs; but evermore<br>  He saw some work to do, some goal to win<br>  That brought him nearer to the end, nor dared<br>  To slumber, lest he should be stung to death<br>  By creeping creatures, or waste precious hours. <br>  And, as he had such patience for himself, <br>  He felt deep pity for his faithful steed, <br>  And talk'd to him as tenderly as though<br>  It were a woman that was hurt and worn, -- <br>  Oft stopping in his labor to smooth down<br>  The ruffled mane, drawing the drooping head<br>  Across his shoulder, and with gentle touch<br>  Stroking the face, until the startled eyes<br>  Grew wistful with a dumb, beseechful love; <br>  And sometimes he would dip his shrinking hand<br>  Into the slimy waters of black tarns,<br>  To wet the bleeding limbs and panting sides. <br>  And so at last they came unto a break<br>  In one side of the road, where grandly stood<br>  A lofty castle with wide-open gates; <br>  And, more because his courser was so  maim'd<br>  Than that himself was tempted at the sight, <br>  He enter'd there, and in the outer court<br>  A damsel met, who led his tired steed<br>  To a clean manger stored with straw and food, <br>  The while across his senses faintly fell<br>  Soft breezes of perfume, that wafted by<br>  Delicious melodies, and drew him on<br>  Through the broad portal to a hall, wherein<br>  The only Presence was a leaping fount. <br>  And, as his footsteps waken'd echoes there, <br>  A hidden door flew wide, through which there danced<br>  A troop of mirthful girls, with sandall'd feet, <br>  To cadences of their own mellow strain, <br>  In which their laughter mingled like the tone<br>  Of silvery chorus threading all the tune. <br>  And, as they forward floated where he stood<br>  Entranced an instant by such lustrous eyes, <br>  Their gauzy robes and loosen'd hair flew back, <br>  And white, soft arms uncurved their wreathing grace<br>  To stretch out rosy palms to meet his own; <br>  He felt e'en through the links of his rough mail<br>  The thrills of each light touch, as, group'd around, <br>  They sang a song of greeting that ran thus: -- <br>  <br>  Enter in from toil and danger! <br>       Ended here thy weary quest! <br>  Now, no more to ease a stranger, <br>       Thou shalt find reward and rest! <br>  Love the Sancgreal! Love the blest! <br>       Love's own heaven! it is here! <br>  Hail! all hail! Love's happy guest, <br>       Welcome here! welcome here! <br>  <br>  Love shall fill thy soul with pleasure! <br>       Love the Sancgreal! Love the dream! <br>  Weaving joys for endless leisure, <br>       Years will but like moments seem! <br>  Love the Sancgreal! Love the blest! <br>       Love's own heaven! it is here! <br>  Hail! all hail! Love's happy guest, <br>       Welcome here! welcome here! <br>  <br>  While their bewildering voices fill'd his ear, <br>  Their lithe, fair forms his sight, he, heedless then<br>  Of aught beside, believed their siren words, <br>  And willing follow'd them to fresh surprise. <br>  For, lo! a chamber flooded with a light<br>  Glowing in color without shade or glare, <br>  Wherein were downy couches, spread with stuffs<br>  Of gorgeous dyes deep fringed about with gold, <br>  And poised between rich vases of all flowers<br>  Can thrall the sense with fragrance and bright hues; <br>  And in their midst a table heap'd with fruits<br>  Luscious and ripe, nigh bursting with their juice, <br>  'Mong dainty goblets sparkling with rare wine, <br>  Whose fumes amid the scent of blossoms rose, <br>  Like flames through incense, making warm his blood. <br>  Athirst and hunger'd, wearied out and worn, <br>  Sir Galahad sat not while women stood, <br>  But lean'd with one arm on the board, while they<br>  Gave ready service to allure his taste: <br>  One brought him clusters of the purple grape, <br>  One pour'd its amber essence, as a third<br>  Stripp'd down the golden orange-rinds, <br>  Or peel'd with jewell'd knife the rosy skin<br>  Of mellow apples; while another broke<br>  The brown stems from crisp, russet pears; he craved<br>  The meat borne in upon its silver dish, <br>  And once his hand crept towards the foaming cups; <br>  But something -- either instinct in himself, <br>  Or whisper of an unseen spirit near --<br>  E'er warned him from them all, he knew not why: <br>  So, with cool head and even pulse, he touch'd<br>  No food but simple bread; and as he drain'd <br>  Long draughts of water, while the damsels stared, <br>  One quickly enter'd in their midst, who shone<br>  Among the rest as might the noonday sun<br>  Circled with twinkling stars; and Galahad<br>  Thought for an instant that a minstrel's dream<br>  Had taken shape, to thrill his throbbing heart<br>  With timid wonder that aught out of heaven<br>  Could be so fair. Form, face, voice, movement, dress, <br>  Were all in harmony; and as she stood<br>  Before him, with her vein'd lids droop'd adown, <br>  Giving him welcome in her low, sweet tones, <br>  There rush'd across his soul that one wild wave<br>  Which whelms a proud man's reason, and makes weak<br>  Earth's strongest Samsons. Suddenly he felt<br>  How lone his life had been, how incomplete, <br>  Half lived, divided as a perfect whole, <br>  Ne'er to be rounded to entireness more<br>  Until his being should absorb and blend<br>  With this one woman's. Love, thus born full-grown, <br>  The spirit's mystic Sancgreal seem'd indeed<br>  That he sought outward sign of! <br>                                                    Days went by<br>  As in a vision; hour in hour roll'd, <br>  Till gliding time like flowing stream swept off<br>  Th' unnoted marks of night and morn that show'd<br>  Its course, and bore his life on rapid waves; <br>  A helmless bark cast loose on unknown depths. <br>  He kept mid luxury his simple ways, <br>  Slept not on downy couches, drank no wine, <br>  Wore still his sword and shield, as though might come<br>  Some unexpected foe e'en to those halls; <br>  He would not yield to sloth, or fire his blood, <br>  For fear the fallen nature in his flesh<br>  Should sully, e'en in thought, the image pure<br>  He shrined for worship in his inmost soul. <br>  Daily he touch'd her hand, sat at her feet, <br>  Watching the changing beauty of her face; <br>  His jealous envy mark'd when perfumed breeze<br>  Lifted her golden hair; and if he felt<br>  His breath come quick and fast, his youthful blood<br>  Rushing in quicken'd beats, he stole away<br>  To fight his passion till his lips could touch<br>  Her garment's hem as if it were a saint's! <br>  But once, as wearied of such homage high, <br>  She threw aside the long restraint was worn<br>  To win upon his nobleness, and deem'd<br>  Her art had guided him, by slow degrees, <br>  To point of her desire. Athwart his heart<br>  A sharp pain like an arrow shot; a veil<br>  Dropp'd from his charm'd sight; his bright dreams died! <br>  Gravely and sadly he removed the arms <br>  That clung about him, casting one last look<br>  Of keen reproach upon the angry face, <br>  Then rose and strode away with rapid steps, <br>  Lest he should pause, and turn to love and sin and shame. <br>  He found his waiting steed, and swiftly rode<br>  Into the narrow way so full of thorns,<br>  Oft hiding mid the briers, holding fast<br>  His courser's mouth, lest he should gladly neigh<br>  When groups of nymphs pass'd by in fruitless search. <br>  He knew the Sancgreal must be farther on, <br>  And took no heed of toil and danger now. <br>  His soul was heavy with its broken trust; <br>  And when he saw the idol he had rear'd<br>  Upon his fancies of pure womanhood<br>  Lie shatter'd by a breath, his sorrow left<br>  His life no other aim save his old quest. <br>  <br>  Anon Sir Launcelot, after striving long, <br>  Did see on shore, while sailing on the sea, <br>  A stately castle, and across the waves<br>  A clear voice bade him enter there and find<br>  Some part of his desire. He left the ship; <br>  And, as he near'd the gates, he drew his sword, <br>  Because of two fierce lions station'd close; <br>  But something smote him sore upon the arm, <br>  So that his weapon dropp'd; while the same tone<br>  Accused his little faith, that trusted less<br>  His Maker than his steel; then on his brow<br>  He sign'd the cross, and harmless pass'd the beasts, <br>  That crouch'd in homage. All the doors were wide<br>  Of all the rooms, save one, whence music came; <br>  And, as he vainly tried to stir its lock, <br>  There stole across his soul the same deep sense<br>  Of matchless joy had fill'd his peers that day<br>  They took their oath to seek for it again.<br>  Then on the threshold knelt Sir Launcelot down, <br>  For well he wist the Sancgreal was within, <br>  Praying, if ever he had pleased the Lord, <br>  In spite of all his sins, that he might view<br>  The holy thing he sought! And, lo! the door<br>  Was open'd, and so great a light flow'd out<br>  He scarce could see inside a silver stand, <br>  That held the sacred vessel, cover'd o'er<br>  With crimson samite, and bright angels round, <br>  While hovering over with pierced hands and feet<br>  The very Christ in glory ray'd! <br>                                                    He rose<br>  To seize the Greal; but, ere he came anear, <br>  A breath like burning smote him, that he fell, <br>  And could not move or speak; when unseen hands<br>  Lifted his form and bore him gently out. <br>  He lay entranced for days, till time was ripe, <br>  When other knights of his own fellowship, <br>  Led there from different ways, his body found, <br>  And tended him until his speech return'd; <br>  And then he warn'd them, as they linger'd round<br>  The portal closed they often strove to ope, <br>  Lest they too should be smitten like himself<br>  For over-boldness. "For now I know," he said, <br>  "No man shall win the Sancgreal but the one<br>  Whom Christ shall call! Alas! he call'd not me!" <br>  <br>  And so they waited, till Sir Galahad, <br>  After long journeys and adventures strange, <br>  Came in their midst. They wonder'd much to see<br>  His visage greatly changed, for all the youth<br>  And bloom had gone from it, although it show'd<br>  Rare beauty still, as from a grace within; <br>  For he had lived with labor, sorrow, strife, <br>  Yet ever meekly, patiently towards God, <br>  And in true charity with men; his love, <br>  His trial, and his grief, had only borne<br>  His pure soul nigher heaven, and made him see<br>  In other hearts the pain was in his own, <br>  And kept him tender even when he smote. <br>  And when they told him that within those walls<br>  The Sancgreal was, he trembled, and his face<br>  Was rapturous with joy; when, lo! a voice <br>  Call'd three times "Galahad," and the closed door, <br>  Barr'd 'gainst the rest, stood open unto him! <br>  His comrades crowded in the hall, while he, <br>  With timid steps, as doubting his own worth, <br>  Went slowly in, and up the altar-steps, <br>  Where stood the Holy Greal on silver stand. <br>  He bow'd his head before it, as a choir<br>  Of clustering angels sang exquisite strains; <br>  While Christ's own self through circling lustre stretch'd<br>  His wounded hand, when roll'd away the cloth<br>  Of samite, and took up the sacred thing<br>  And gave to him; then in sweet tones, that thrill'd<br>  His listeners, bade him bear it o'er the land, <br>  That all who saw it might be bless'd like him. <br>  And then all vanish'd, save the vessel clasp'd<br>  Close to the young knight's breast, who upward look'd<br>  In praiseful ecstasy, while gather'd round<br>  His peers, to gaze on it with solemn eyes, <br>  And feel how lovely 'twas to draw so near<br>  To aught just come from God; and Galahad<br>  Took oath of them to travel as a guard<br>  For their great gift, that all should help proclaim<br>  Its power and good, that more might know delight. <br>  <br>  Then journey'd they in company, save one, <br>  Launcelot, who took the tidings to the king<br>  Or ere he went to tell his own far realm. <br>  And ever on their way the people flock'd<br>  About the marvellous prize; the sick were heal'd, <br>  The blind received their sight, and sinful lives<br>  Grew purer, having known in part the bliss<br>  That reigns in Paradise, and heard it said<br>  Its joy would stay with them who merit proved; <br>  The country's guilt was purged, and hope and love<br>  Walk'd hand in hand, like seraphs, mid its homes! <br>  Till they who humbly should have thank'd the Lord<br>  That He had made them servants of His will, <br>  Quarrell'd between themselves which one had done<br>  The most to make the mighty Sancgreal known; <br>  And at the last, in sooth, they question'd oft<br>  The what it really was! <br>                                               And Galahad,<br>  Sore smitten, could not stay their angry tilts, <br>  E'en when he went among them with his hands<br>  Outholding the bless'd Greal! And then he pray'd<br>  That Christ would take his spirit to Himself, <br>  Where reign'd His peace. God's mercy heard his cry, <br>  And, in full sight of all His angels, bore<br>  The holy vessel from his dying arms<br>  Up to the highest heaven. And only they<br>  Have ever look'd upon the treasure since<br>  Who pray and fast, and through repentant tears<br>  Catch far-off glimpses of its glory's light. <br>  And while he lay upon his couch and watch'd<br>  The soaring messengers, the knights stood round, <br>  E'en mid their mourning, all disputing still, <br>  And asked him, ere he pass'd away, to tell<br>  What he had deem'd the Sancgreal really was! <br>  And Galahad uplifted his weak form, <br>  And with his white face awed them, as his lips, <br>  Quivering with death, spoke out his last, grand words: <br>  "O Men! 'twas Truth! God's own Eternal Truth!" <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>
