sift them through and through,<br>  We find their theories all unsound,<br>  And they the only liars found.<br>  That Arthur lived I well believe,<br>  It a historic truth receive,<br>  And see no more to doubt in him<br>  Than fish do in the waters swim,<br>  Or birds fly through the yielding air,<br>  Or earth blooms with its flowers fair,<br>  Or storms the waves of ocean roll<br>  With

I could stop the Comet's car,<br>  And load it with the Polar Star.<br>  Yea, let the skeptics doubt the birth<br>  Of good King Arthur on this earth,<br>  Deny him all his fame and worth,<br>  And prowess of unmeasured girth;<br>  We'll war 'gainst them both day and night,<br>  And we shall conquer in the fight.<br>  My son, the winds are wild and shrill,<br>  They drive the snow o'er glen and hill;<br>  The night with all its clouds is stored,<br>  And not a planet is abroad;<br>  Deep darkness fills all sky and space,<br>  And over all of Nature's face<br>  No object through the night we trace.<br>  But let the night be as it will,<br>  And blasts scream over moor and hill,<br>  Warm beside our blazing hearth,<br>  We'll listen to the tempest's mirth;<br>  Be just as happy and as

de Main had won,<br>  He 'neath King Arthur's judging eyes<br>     The knightliest deeds had done;<br>  And never breathed a man on earth<br>     More fitter than that gallant king,<br>  To judge a hero's knightly worth,<br>     And deed of skill in tourney ring.<br>  A mighty helm of flashing steel,<br>     With purest ruddy gold inlaid,<br>  That o'er it waving plumes reveal<br>     That day

humblest knight to proudest lord.<br>  All is merry feasting, joy and mirth,<br>     In every stir and sight and sound,<br>  Nor happier scenes has witnessed earth<br>     Since ever hero kings were crowned,<br>  By knights where e'er the eye may go,<br>     Are all beauteous maidens seen,<br>  The best the whole wide world can show<br>     In comeliness of face and mien.<br>  Each gallant baron, king and knight,<br>     Has his fair partner by his side,<br>  For whose fair name and honor bright<br>     He unto deed of death would ride.<br>  The fair Gunever ever blest<br>     With sweetest charms in beauty stored,<br>  Sits with heart at ease and soul at rest,<br>     Beside her loved and loving lord;<br>  But those who'd know each beauteous guest<br>     That sat around that spacious board,<br>  Let them through Arthur's annals quest,<br>     The tales will well their time reward!<br>  Of her who sat by Beau de Main<br>     It will be my duty here to tell:<br>  Of all the maids 'neath Arthur's reign<br>     She did in comeliness excell,<br>  Her eyes were like the living light<br>     Of meteors born of blue,<br>  And from each orb, so starry bright,<br>     A generous soul looked through<br>  Her face like garden of the East<br>     When summer blooms in all her prime,<br>  Roses red and white the showers feast,<br>     Do all commingling bloom sublime.<br>  A nobler head and fairer brow<br>     Was never seen with mortal maid,<br>  Nor through all the ages until now<br>     Were such wavy, golden locks surveyed;<br>  As opening rose her mouth was sweet,<br>     Never yet did rubier lip<br>  The searching eye of nature greet,<br>     Nor from a mortal goblet sip.<br>  White as the foam the billows show,<br>     Heaved 'neath gauzy silk her bosom fair.<br>  As golden sushine cast on snow<br>     O'er neck and shoulders stream'd her hair;<br>  Her white round arms were like the down<br>     That waves upon the autumn field,<br>  That with snowy loveliness doth crown<br>     The dark brown hulls that did it yield.<br>  A form more perfect and more fair,<br>     By nature crowned with nobler grace,<br>  Ne'er trod the earth, nor breathed its air,<br>     Nor did those of mortal mold embrace.<br>  A foot more light, yet firm than hers,<br>     Upon this world has never trod;<br>  Not lighter summer's zephyr stirs<br>     That bows no grass along the sod,<br>  Her tread was like the fleecy snow<br>     That touches on the river's face,<br>  But ruffles not its tranquil flow,<br>     Nor leaves behind the slightest trace;<br>  Her voice was soft as wind that sighs<br>     At summer through the sultry vale,<br>  Sweet as perfumes that on it rise--<br>     From violets, rose and lillies pale!<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   VI.<br>  <br>  No wonder that the maid was fair,<br>     And famed for beauty o'er the earth,<br>  For from a bright immortal pair<br>     'Twas said that maiden drew her birth.<br>  A pair of angels, so the story runs,<br>     Left their heavenly homes of yore,<br>  To journey space and view the suns,<br>     And countless planets to explore;<br>  From world to world, from star to star,<br>     The adventurous angels flew,<br>  And where the comets blazed afar<br>     All grand, but terrible to view;<br>  And while amidst the realms of space,<br>     Where worlds on worlds unnumbered glow'd<br>  And over all creation's face<br>     Their blazing lights eternal flowed.<br>  Amidst the boundless realms afar,<br>     A world they saw in glowing azure drest<br>  That seem'd to them a gleaming star,<br>     More beautiful than all the rest;<br>  And down they shot on lightning wings<br>     Beyond the utmost speed of thought,<br>  Past planets form'd in glowing rings,<br>     All with immortal beauty fraught;<br>  And lighted here upon this sphere,<br>     The lovely home of mortal man;<br>  Enraptured stare the angel pair,<br>     No world they'd seen of grander plan;<br>  And here on earth their home they made,<br>     Though all unseen of mortal men,<br>  Save at noons when forests spread their shade,<br>     And sunshine warm'd the hill and glen.<br>  All those who saw the lovely pair,<br>     Of them did wonderous marvels tell,<br>  One was a maiden heavenly fair,<br>     Her waving, golden tresses fell<br>  O'er shoulders fair as froth on seas,<br>     Face with all charms in rainbows seen;<br>  Her airy step was like the breeze<br>     That stirs not e'en the aspen green.<br>  The other was a comely youth,<br>     Of godlike, all commanding mien,<br>  Whose visage seem'd the shrine of truth,<br>     With every virtue glittering sheen;<br>  The Genii he was styled by men<br>     Of all the mountains and the hills,<br>  And she was the Nymph of sunny glen,<br>     And all the fountains and the rills;<br>  One sole offspring, but of form divine,<br>     Sprung from the union of this pair,<br>  In her did all their virtues shine,<br>     And all beauties of her mother fair:<br>  They kept her in their secret glen<br>     Throughout many an age of time.<br>  And taught her all that mortals ken,<br>     And all of angel lore sublime;<br>  Then sent her forth as mortal maid,<br>     To charm and gladden human kind;<br>  In every glorious cause to aid,<br>     And lead the race on paths refined.<br>  Clotilda was this maiden named,<br>     In Orkney she'd been born and bred,<br>  And much through her those isles were famed,<br>     Back in the misty ages fled.<br>  The glories of King Arthur's court,<br>     Had reached her in her secret glen,<br>  And unto Camelot did she resort<br>     To see this first of mortal men.<br>  In quest of gallant knight came she,<br>     Who could achieve adventures bold,<br>  And for her pining captives free,<br>     Grim giants kept in rocky hold.<br>  But none like Beau de Main she found<br>     In perilous deeds and knightly worth;<br>  All knights renowned of the Table Round<br>     He far out shone, and all on earth;<br>  So he she singled for perils grim,<br>     And dread, awe inspiring deed;<br>  What recked he loss of life and limb,<br>     Her faith and love his glorious meed;<br>  If was death his lot, he lost her not,<br>     His spirit would move at her side,<br>  If he lived, then at high Camelot<br>     Her King Arthur would give as bride.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   VII.<br>  <br>  Done is the feast, the mirth has ceased,<br>     In King Arthur's glittering halls;<br>  Where spear and sword and targes broad<br>     Hang vast along the mighty walls,<br>  Where axes bright and mace of might<br>     The gazing coward's soul appalls;<br>  And high o'er head the banner red,<br>     O'er helms and gleaming armor falls,<br>  In awful rows they there repose,<br>     For not a sound to battle calls.<br>  But loud the lay of love and fray<br>     The skillful bards of Arthur sing;<br>  Deep, full, strong, flows forth the song,<br>     While chords of harps responding ring.<br>  Of gallant knight and lady bright,<br>     Of loves and hates and wars of old,<br>  Of daring king in tourney ring,<br>     Waving plume and helm of gold;<br>  Of hydras dread with dragon's head,<br>     By arm of mortal heros slain;<br>  Of slighted oath and broken troth,<br>     And dying friendship's throes and pain;<br>  Hunts o'er brake, and moor for stag and boar,<br>     And glories of the chase they sing,<br>  And varied swell and songs as well<br>     From bards and harps alternate ring.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   VIII.<br>  <br>  The festive day is waning fast,<br>     Yet shines the sun in Arthur's halls,<br>  Though eastward of those towers vast<br>     Apace a lengthening shadow falls;<br>  Yet, 'ere he goes his beams are cast<br>     In living splendor on those walls,<br>  On shield and lance the sunbeams glance,<br>     And all like waving flame they blaze;<br>  On greaves of steel the sunbeams reel,<br>     And flash around their blinding rays.<br>  On shield and lance the sunbeams glance,<br>     On Morion, sword and helmet sheen,<br>  On armor bright those beams alight,<br>     And all resplendent glows the scene;<br>  So long they glar'd on polished steel,<br>     And so intense the sheen became,<br>  It seems those halls within reveal<br>     One waving flood of dazzling flame;<br>  Then at the sight as if inspired<br>     With brightness that around them fell.<br>  Each bard and minstrel's soul seems fired<br>     With something more than mortal spell.<br>  And loud and louder still their song,<br>     And strains of music roar and ring,<br>  'Till like a storm it sweeps along<br>     Through all the castles of the king;<br>  And swifly turns where splendor burns<br>     The eyes of every chief and knight,<br>  Soul and mind all thought and feeling spurns,<br>     Save steel gleaming to the sunbeams bright.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   IX.<br>  <br>  While gleam'd the shine of the day's decline,<br>     In princely Arthur's royal halls,<br>  And stirring chime of minstrel's rhyme<br>     Reechoed loud within the walls;<br>  Strode in the hall an aged man,<br>     With locks as white as Denmark's snow,<br>  Who bowed to the king and then began<br>     To speak in accents soft and low;<br>  King Arthur, o'er many a mile<br>     Of earth my weary feet have trod,<br>  O'er mountain high and deep defile,<br>     O'er deserts drear and vernal sod,<br>  To many a kingly court I've been,<br>     And noble kings were they, I trow,<br>  But never place like this I've seen,<br>     Through all my journeys until now.<br>  The knights renown'd of the Table Round<br>     Are known throughout the spacious earth,<br>  Their praise doth sound where men are found<br>     Who honor give to fame and worth;<br>  And hither here I've sped to see<br>     If any hero I can find,<br>  Whose soul's of every baseness free,<br>     And has an unpolluted mind,<br>  For such alone can draw this sword,<br>     From out its diamond studded sheath,<br>  And he who doth, shall be its lord,<br>     Nor any peril fear yon sky beneath;<br>  With that he placed in Arthur's hand<br>     A long, massive glittering sword,<br>  Than Excalibur, far more grand,<br>     More terrible and long and broad.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   X.<br>  <br>  Long, long essayed the gallant king,<br>     To draw from out its sheath that magic blade,<br>  But it from sheath he could not bring,<br>     Though he with all his might essayed;<br>  Then all dismayed his chiefs surveyed<br>     The ponderous, glittering brand<br>  They knew 'twas vain for them to try<br>     When failed had Arthur's stalwart hand.<br>  They all essayed to draw that blade<br>     They all essayed but Beau de Main,<br>  In his hand was laid the starry blade<br>     Nor was that hero's effort vain;<br>  Forth at his touch the weapon came,<br>     Loud rattling from its starry sheath,<br>  The glittering falchion flashed like flame<br>     From burning cloud on midnight heath;<br>  Then high up on the Table Round<br>     He the glittering falchion threw,<br>  There it fell, with thundering sound,<br>     While gems of lightning from it flew,<br>  Abashed with surprise the heroes all<br>     The wonderous deed behold,<br>  And louder through King Arthur's hall<br>     The swelling strains of music rolled.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XI.<br>  <br>  Come, come with me, the old man spake,<br>     And thou shalt rise to honors new;<br>  Thou shalt yokes of banded tyrants break,<br>     And glory's brightest path pursue.<br>  Thou art the lord of magic sword,<br>     And thou with it shall prowess do;<br>  On battle field, 'twill cleave each shield,<br>     And smite all mortal armor through.<br>  Beneath its sheen and edges keen,<br>     Those who never fled before shall fly;<br>  And monsters grim in form and limb<br>     That vex and curse the world shall die<br>  So mount thy steed and with me speed<br>     For ere yon sun our sight shall leave,<br>  Thou shalt range through a castle strange,<br>     And deeds of prowess high achieve.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XII.<br>  <br>  Forth on their steeds the twain have gone,<br>     From King Arthur's ancient halls,<br>  Where yet the glowing sunbeams shone,<br>     On glittering steel clad walls.<br>  O'er moor and brake, by stream and lake,<br>     The wild boar's reedy fen,<br>  By hill and crag where roams the stag,<br>     And wilds scarce known to men;<br>  Ride on those twain, until they gain<br>     A valley lone and drear,<br>  Abrupt and grand on either hand,<br>     The towering hills appear;<br>  Each steep incline with fir and pine,<br>     And oak and gum is crowned,<br>  And o'er them the twine huge folds of vine,<br>     That trail along the ground,<br>  Though here and there the hills are bare,<br>     No trees bedeck their side,<br>  Yet there green moss with glowing gloss<br>     Waves in its vernal pride.<br>  O'er boulders steep huge torrents leap<br>     Into the vale below,<br>  O'er boulders brown those floods rush down,<br>     With foam as white as snow.<br>  In roaring mass they onward pass,<br>     To a river deep and broad,<br>  Those waters strong flow fierce along,<br>     Too wild for steed to ford.<br>  And midst its flow huge boulders show<br>     At times their naked heads,<br>  Some red as blood, some white as flood,<br>     When froth its surface spreads.<br>  And some are dark as is the bark<br>     When charred by scorching flame,<br>  Some somber brown that sternly frown,<br>     O'er floods they can not tame;<br>  That by them toil in fierce turmoil,<br>     And o'er them dash their spray,<br>  As if their pride all rocks defied,<br>     That dared to bar their way;<br>  And long that vale the lillies pale<br>     Waved o'er those waters wide;<br>  And roses set by violet<br>     Bedeck the river's side;<br>  And grasses green as ever seen<br>     Wave o'er the teeming soil;<br>  And incommode the narrow road<br>     'Long which those horsemen toil,<br>  And years have past, a number vast,<br>     Since there has horseman trod;<br>  All men feared well that haunted dell,<br>     And shunn'd its fatal sod,<br>  In rhymes of old strange tales are told<br>     About that valley drear,<br>  Of monsters dread that there are bred,<br>     And fiends for men to fear;<br>  Of dragons grim in form and limb,<br>     That fly on wings of flame;<br>  All O'er whose hide strange scales abide,<br>     Hard as yet sword became;<br>  And ne'er could feel the edge of steel,<br>     All o'er its horrid frame;<br>  And vain the force of man and horse<br>     Its grisly rage to tame.<br>  Ne'er mortal trod that fatal sod<br>     By either night nor day,<br>  But to its jaw and horrid maw<br>     They instant found their way.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XIII.<br>  <br>  But little reck'd our hero bold<br>  For idle tales that minstrels told<br>  'Bout either glen or hill or wold,<br>  Of caverns dread or giants bold,<br>  His spirit knew no more of fear<br>  Than rock 'round which the surges tear;<br>  His soul was set on perils grim,<br>  And these alone delighted him;<br>  With hand on rein and rowels red,<br>  He followed where that old men led,<br>  Little he knew and less he cared,<br>  What perils should that day be dared;<br>  His arm was strong, his sword was keen,<br>  He longed to dye its glowing sheen<br>  With blood of paynim tyrants grim,<br>  Or giants of stupendous limb;<br>  Such as by bards were said to dwell<br>  Within that valley lone and fell.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XIV.<br>  <br>  Onward he goes, at length he sees<br>  Amidst a grove of giant trees,<br>  Whose mighty limbs though spreading wide<br>  With flame are darken'd, scorched and dried,<br>  And 'midst them at the mountain's base,<br>  A horrid cavern he could trace,<br>  Where grisly dragons flame disgorge<br>  Dread as yet stream'd from blazing forge;<br>  There noxious flames terrific float,<br>  Grim, pestilence and death denote;<br>  Sulphurous fumes midst flame and smoke,<br>  And chlorine, lungs and nostrils choke,<br>  Yet in that cave of stifling breath,<br>  Was silence dread as that of death;<br>  Though from it flowed a mighty flood,<br>  Of reeking liquid red as blood.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XV.<br>  <br>  Then spoke the man of hoary head:<br>  Through yonder cavern we must tread,<br>  But thou the dangerous way must lead,<br>  So ready make for daring deed:<br>  Thy sword unsheath, onward spur thy steed<br>  And I'll thy thirst for glory feed.<br>  Roused at the voice, from out the cave<br>  A fearful leap the dragon gave,<br>  Forward it roaring comes amain,<br>  Like mountain torrent swelled with rain;<br>  Black broods the air above its head,<br>  And serpents spring beneath its tread;<br>  Its horrid jaws are opened wide,<br>  Nor belching flames its fangs could hide;<br>  Those were in awful rows revealed,<br>  Though half in reeking gore concealed,<br>  Which from its jaws dropped down like rain;<br>  And from its neck a shaggy mane,<br>  Black as was ever darkness found,<br>  Hung down and trailed along the ground.<br>  Broad was its head and vast its length,<br>  And all stupendous seemed its strength;<br>  And over all its sable hide<br>  Were folds on folds of horny pride,<br>  That sharpest steel of man defied<br>  To pierce, or harm it to betide;<br>  Two mighty wings it shook in air,<br>  Stirred it as though a storm were there.<br>  To gaze upon its mighty size,<br>  Its lion's head and horrid eyes,<br>  It seemed all vain for man to hope<br>  In fray 'gainst such a beast to cope;<br>  Too vast its force, too huge its length,<br>  For mortal's steel or hero's strength.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XVI.<br>  <br>  But thought not thus the gallant knight,<br>  He longed to meet that beast in fight;<br>  He eyed it with a stern delight,<br>  But ere he drew his falchion bright<br>  To heaven a secret prayer he made,<br>  Invoked his Lord Jehovah's aid;<br>  Prayed as all knights and heroes true<br>  Are wont, when glory they pursue.<br>  Great God of every sea and clime,<br>  Who sits 'midst seraph hosts sublime,<br>  Thine the earth and sun and starry zone,<br>  That journey round Thy endless throne,<br>  Thine is the fount of life and light,<br>  As well as death's all whelming might;<br>  Thou gracious Judge of right and wrong,<br>  Who can make the hero weak or strong,<br>  Thy gracious ear to me incline,<br>  And hear my thoughts for they are Thine<br>  Almighty and eternal Lord,<br>  This day, with victory, crown my sword!<br>  Strengthen my arm, make good my breath,<br>  That I may stretch yon beast in death;<br>  Let earth drink up its vital gore,<br>  So it may curse mankind no more,<br>  Let it beneath Thy servant fall,<br>  So may it be, Thou Lord of all!<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XVII.<br>  <br>  Then swift, soon as the prayer he breathed,<br>  He his glittering sword unsheathed,<br>  And springing from his gallant horse<br>  On foot he tries the dragon's force.<br>  High o'er his head on ponderous wings<br>  In air the horrid monster springs;<br>  And as it strove with grisly claw<br>  The gallant knight from earth to draw,<br>  With one fell blow his sword he brings<br>  On one of its tremendous wings,<br>  Clean severed from its trunk it flew,<br>  And prone on earth the monster threw.<br>  From mouth that stream'd forth gore and flame<br>  A dread, infernal roaring came;<br>  On earth the wing descending fell,<br>  With shock that shook the lonely dell,<br>  While gore gushed from the monster's side,<br>  And shooting far the forests dyed<br>  Where o'er the trees on every limb.<br>  Hung hissing folds of serpents grim.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XVIII.<br>  <br>  Again the beast his head uprears,<br>  For victory or death prepares;<br>  Dread as the thunder cloud he came,<br>  His throat a roaring fount of flame,<br>  Swift as the lightning bolt it sped<br>  A claw above the hero's head;<br>  Another swoop of his trusty blade,<br>  And on the earth that claw is laid;<br>  Swift down it falls 'midst streaming gore,<br>  To injure mortal man no more.<br>  Then fiercer wax'd the monster's ire,<br>  And dreader gushed the founts of fire;<br>  Before those flames of sulphur dire<br>  From conflict did the knight retire.<br>  But through the path he sped, anon<br>  The roaring terror thundered on,<br>  Forward it sped where e'er he came,<br>  O'er him casting forky, waving flame;<br>  Yet sped the knight where purer air<br>  Did soon his wasted strength repair;<br>  Then high he reared his seven-fold shield,<br>  Which shelter from the flame did yield;<br>  And while on this he caught the flame,<br>  Full on the roaring beast he came,<br>  Between its eyes his reeking sword<br>  Made horrid passage deep and broad;<br>  Prone on the earth the terror came,<br>  And ceased the roaring fount of flame,<br>  Though fast and dread its serpent tail<br>  Moved round the hero like a flail!<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XIX.<br>  <br>  Backward a space the hero drew,<br>  Where he could well the monster view,<br>  Then back he sped with vigor rife,<br>  To end the grisly Terror's life;<br>  One full sweep with his trusty blade,<br>  And the snaky tail on earth is laid;<br>  Three times his sword he drives in gore,<br>  And with a hoarse and horrid roar,<br>  Shaking the earth on which it lies,<br>  The roaring Terror writhing dies.<br>  While rivers huge of reeking gore<br>  Adown the winding valley pour.<br>  The horrid serpents vast and grim,<br>  That hang from every tree and limb,<br>  All palsied drop with stiffened fang,<br>  And breathe on earth their dying pang.<br>  Soon as the grisly Terror dies,<br>  And lifeless all it smoking lies,<br>  From gore the hero wipes his sword,<br>  Gives thanks to Heaven's eternal Lord.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XX.<br>  <br>  Up through that cavern dark and drear,<br>  Where that grim Terror made its lair,<br>  Upon their strong and mettled steeds,<br>  That hero with his guide proceeds;<br>  Through subterranean passage drear,<br>  They go and mock at night and fear.<br>  The way was rough and dark and dread<br>  For either steed or man to tread;<br>  Yet safely on their way they made<br>  Till daylight on the darkness played;<br>  And here a gate did they survey,<br>  That blocked the passage of that way,<br>  Huge bars of steel and beams of brass,<br>  A gate, a strong and ponderous mass,<br>  That gleamed all o'er like molten glass,<br>  Completely blocked that gloomy pass.<br>  Down from his steed the hero springs,<br>  And 'gainst the gate his force he flings,<br>  But vain 'gainst it his strength he brings,<br>  It neither stirs nor shakes nor rings;<br>  Solid as rock or mountain's side,<br>  It stood and all his force defied;<br>  Nor least bewildered and amazed,<br>  Upon that gate the hero gazed;<br>  But strove and strove with all his force,<br>  To move that gate and clear his course.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXI.<br>  <br>  Then spake the man with hoary head:<br>  The path we came again no man shall tread.<br>  Behold, it all is closed with rock,<br>  That ne'er shall move to earthquake's shock,<br>  To flame, nor storm, nor hand of time,<br>  Till nature's death-knell God shall chime.<br>  Before us life and glory glow,<br>  Behind are only death and woe,<br>  To linger midst this stifling breath<br>  Would shortly bring us ghastly death;<br>  So then, most valiant knight and good,<br>  Well proved in deeds of hardihood,<br>  Once more 'gainst it thy valor try,<br>  And clear the way or here we die;<br>  Perhaps in this thy gleaming sword<br>  May unto thee some aid afford."<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXII.<br>  <br>  Behind the hero cast his eye,<br>  And nought but rock could he descry;<br>  The path that they had journeyed through<br>  No longer met his searching view;<br>  But rocks as hard as e'er were drilled<br>  In solid mass that passage filled,<br>  Nor left the faintest trace behind,<br>  Where'd been that pass for him to find.<br>  A moment, and but a moment's space,<br>  He gazed on the enchanted place,<br>  Then from his sheath his blade he drew,<br>  While sparks of lightning from it flew,<br>  Which far and wide spread flashing round,<br>  And filled the place with light and sound.<br>  Then swift on that barrier grim<br>  It sped with all his force of limb,<br>  The ponderous gate terrific rings,<br>  And from its place like lightning springs,<br>  And instant fades from mortal sight,<br>  Like on the cloud the flash of light.<br>  Then spoke a voice, a voice sublime,<br>  That seemed to sound all o'er that clime:<br>  Dreadful hour and fatal day,<br>  All our power has past away;<br>  All, all our spells and magic grand,<br>  Are wrecked for aye by mortal hand,<br>  Past away, as foretold of yore,<br>  By Merlin's voice and Merlin's lore;<br>  Dreadful day and fatal hour,<br>  That ends on earth the wizard's power.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXIII.<br>  <br>  Ceased the voice, but ere died its sound<br>  Like rolling waves the earth stirred round,<br>  'Till rocks from out their places rose,<br>  And writhed with all terrific throes;<br>  The lofty hills were rent in twain<br>  A moment's space, then joined again,<br>  While over all a sable cloud<br>  Closed grim and dread with thunders loud,<br>  Though not a lightning flash nor flame<br>  From out that shroud of thunder came;<br>  Dread and more dread the thunder rolled,<br>  And darker grew that awful fold,<br>  Beneath those peals of thunder loud<br>  To earth their heads the forests bowed,<br>  As if there a roaring whirlwind trod,<br>  Or dreader still, an angry God!<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXIV.<br>  <br>  The thunder ceased and shrieks aghast,<br>  Loud as the roar of mountain blast,<br>  Burst from that cloud's terrific fold,<br>  Then all at once from sight it rolled;<br>  Where it had been nought else was seen<br>  But azure sky and mountains green,<br>  A flowery dell with lofty trees,<br>  That waved their leaves 'midst balmy breeze;<br>  Along which that old man hoar and strange<br>  With Beau de Main begins to range.<br>  Far up that dell those travellers wound,<br>  O'er barren rock and grassy ground;<br>  At length a lofty hill they spy,<br>  Piled up against the western sky,<br>  Where many a tower confronts the eye,<br>  With wall and gate and bulwark high;<br>  All formed of vast stupendous blocks,<br>  And seem'd a pyramid of rocks,<br>  Of dark and green and red and gray;<br>  By Titans piled in vast array,<br>  To rear their battlements and towers,<br>  When warr'd they 'gainst the heavenly powers.<br>  High on the hills they stood sublime,<br>  Seemed out of reach of storm or time,<br>  As there they gleamed in grand array,<br>  Beneath the beams of closing day!<br>  But to them, of path, no utter trace<br>  Was seen upon that mountain's face,<br>  Of road where e'er the eye pursue<br>  On right or left was caught no clue;<br>  Like some rock-guarded eagle's nest,<br>  High hung upon the mountain's crest,<br>  Beyond the reach of hunter's hand,<br>  Those towers amidst the sunshine stand!<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXV.<br>   <br>  O'er his eyes his hand the hero raised,<br>  To shield them from the beam that blazed,<br>  And at their splendor all amazed<br>  Steadfastly on those bulwarks gazed,<br>  For stronger, loftier tower<br>  He'd never seen before that hour;<br>  It looked all like some mighty hold<br>  Reared by the Cyclops Kings of old,<br>  Yet all within and all around<br>  Seem'd wrapt in silence so profound,<br>  So void of life and stir and sound--<br>  Those hills seem'd with a phantom crown'd.<br>  But while he gazed the old man spake:<br>  Come, thy way to yonder bulwark take!<br>  No road I see, the knight replied,<br>  O'er all yon mountain's lofty side,<br>  Its whole broad surface I can view,<br>  And road on it I see no clue;<br>  And vain for me or you to try<br>  The scaling of that mountain high;<br>  Those rocks are all too smooth and steep<br>  For man up them to climb or creep.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXVI.<br>  <br>  There is a road, the other spake,<br>  Thyself for it now ready make,<br>  Within thy hand thy falchion take,<br>  Lift shield, and keep thine eye awake,<br>  For I may lead on peril's path,<br>  And thou must nobly brave their wrath;<br>  And never glory yet was won<br>  By any knight beneath yon sun,<br>  Who did not bravely troubles meet,<br>  And all unflinching dangers greet;<br>  And put all perils to defeat,<br>  Be they of body or of soul,<br>  And onward press to glory's goal!<br>  While thus he speaks they swiftly ride<br>  Far down along the mountain's side,<br>  To where the base with trees was crowned,<br>  And then 'midst tangled bush they found<br>  There opened a passage broad and wide,<br>  Right through the hollow mountain's side;<br>  In rode the twain, and soon anon<br>  Saw a broad, steep way leading on,<br>  To where those lofty towers rose,<br>  In dream-like silence and dread repose.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXVII.<br>  <br>  They reached the bulwark's lofty wall,<br>  Pass'd through an archway broad and tall,<br>  Where stood a gate wide open cast,<br>  Wrought out of bars of iron vast,<br>  Braced with hands of ponderous brass,<br>  And those of steel in mighty mass.<br>  Scarce by the gate those twain were past<br>  Than 'cross the archway it was cast,<br>  Closed with a fierce and sudden sound,<br>  That echoed all those bulwarks round;<br>  And loud and plain was heard the jar<br>  Of placing lock and bolt and bar.<br>  The knight turn'd round with searching eye,<br>  But not a thing could he descry<br>  In likeness of the human race<br>  About that archway's ample space;<br>  The deed was done by hand unseen,<br>  Perhaps not one of mortal mien.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXVIII.<br>  <br>  Then onward swift those horsemen ride<br>  Into a court-yard long and wide,<br>  Yet all the place of life seems free,<br>  For not a beast nor man they see;<br>  No sound of human voice they hear,<br>  Nor any stir breaks on their ear,<br>  Save their coursers' tread on stony ground,<br>  They meet no other stir nor sound;<br>  And these re-echo strange and drear<br>  Through all those lofty bulwarks there.<br>  Was it some dread, enchanted place<br>  Unknown to those of mortal race,<br>  Where never mortal trod before,<br>  And whence he shall depart no more,<br>  'Till time the judgment morn shall bring?<br>  Or was it the tomb of some great king,<br>  Who reign'd amidst the ages past,<br>  Long since 'neath oblivion cast?<br>  Who, though he rear'd a tomb as grand<br>  As ever yet by monarch plann'd,<br>  His fame and name he could not save<br>  However cruel, good, or brave,<br>  From wasting time and fleeting years,<br>  That crumble all that mortal rears,<br>  And all that nature can control?<br>  While thus revolved the hero's soul,<br>  From westward, from whence beam'd the sun<br>  His setting rays o'er mountains dun,<br>  He heard a deafening trumpet clang,<br>  That echoing through those bulwarks rang;<br>  Hills shook beneath that trumpet's blast,<br>  As if through them an earthquake past,<br>  And right between him and the light<br>  The sunbeams cast upon that height.<br>  A steel-clad champion he espied<br>  Upon a coal-black charger ride,<br>  With visor down and spear in rest,<br>  Right onward unto him he press'd;<br>  With clang of arms and courser's tread<br>  The air was filled with tumult dread;<br>  As if with riving thunders torn,<br>  Not swifter yet a cloud was borne<br>  Upon the pinions of the storm<br>  Than sped that horse and steel-clad form;<br>  And like a cloud that meets the sight,<br>  Whose centre all is black as night,<br>  Though round its edges lightnings play,<br>  Gild it with terrible array,<br>  For man and horse from head to heel<br>  Are sheathed in plates of sable steel;<br>  But gleaming helm and spear and sword,<br>  And axe terrific, keen and broad,<br>  That armed that rider cast a light<br>  Like that round thunder-cloud at night.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXIX.<br>  <br>  Another glorious trumpet clang<br>  Throughout those lofty ramparts rang;<br>  And straight a line of glittering spears<br>  Behind that rider grim appears;<br>  Far down the hill they swift arise<br>  Like flashing clouds that mount the skies,<br>  And glowing helm and sword and shield<br>  Are 'midst the rising ranks revealed;<br>  And o'er the coming wave of steel<br>  To and fro, golden banners reel.<br>  Onward it came in swift career,<br>  While dust made dark the stagnant air,<br>  All that wide space grew dark and dun,<br>  To silence sped the glowing sun,<br>  As when the simoom fierce and red<br>  Roars o'er the desert's sandy bed:<br>  Yet nearer fast that wave of steel<br>  Comes on with deafening trumpet peal,<br>  That shakes the air with tumult dread,<br>  While nearer sounds the measured tread<br>  Of armed men, whose clanging sound<br>  The stormy trumpet notes have drowned:<br>  And nearer 'midst the dark'ning gloom<br>  Is seen the coming helm and plume;<br>  With broken gleams of ruddy light<br>  Rise long arrays of lances bright;<br>  The long arrays of shield and sword,<br>  Of daggers keen and axes broad.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXX.<br>  <br>  Then from those lofty ramparts rose<br>  Storms of unutterable woes,<br>  Sighs, lamentations and loud moans,<br>  Horrible outcries and hoarse groans;<br>  All languages--tongues of every clime<br>  Mix'd in that storm of anguish chime;<br>  With hands together smote amain,<br>  And feet that stamp with throes of pain.<br>  Made up a tumult dread and fell<br>  As ever roused the king of hell;<br>  Made up a tumult grim and drear,<br>  That whirled through all that darken'd air,<br>  Like burning sand the simoom lifts,<br>  And on that roaring whirlwind drifts.<br>  With ear intent and eye awake,<br>  As stands the lion in the brake,<br>  With soul as void of mortal fear,<br>  As oaks round which the tempests tear<br>  All things strange, Beau de Main watched there<br>  That met his eye or pierced his ear.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXXI.<br>  <br>  My gallant knight, thus spoke his guide,<br>  Fear not the least yon ranks of pride,<br>  Though they hem thee in on every side,<br>  Thou shalt as victor o'er them ride.<br>  Go, cleave each gleaming helm and shield,<br>  Yon host through thee to death shall yield;<br>  First take this spear and spur thy steed,<br>  'Gainst him who doth yon squadron lead;<br>  Yon sable knight who comes so fierce,<br>  Him through the breast and breast-plate pierce,<br>  He said, then unto Beau de Main<br>  A spear he gave of twisted grain.<br>  All like a stately mast in length,<br>  And like the mountain oak for strength,<br>  Armed at the end with steel as strong<br>  As e'er was forged, wrought sharp and long,<br>  This swift the hero placed in rest,<br>  Waiting for him who onward pressed.<br>  As there he stood a sudden flame<br>  Swift bursting from that darkness came,<br>  High o'er the hemisphere it sailed,<br>  And through the darkened air prevailed.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXXII.<br>  <br>  As some dark cloud of giant form,<br>  That rides upon the roaring storm,<br>  That shakes the world beneath its path,<br>  Whose thunders mutter forth its wrath;<br>  Whose lightnings fiercely round it play,<br>  And guides it on its rapid way,<br>  That meeting bursts with deafening shock,<br>  Upon the side of some firm rock;<br>  Then downward falls in sudden flight,<br>  Before that rock and fades from sight<br>  So met that hero Beau de Main,<br>  So sudden rolled upon the plain;<br>  Through breast-plate and through breast that spear<br>  Had torn a passage grim and drear,<br>  With horrid din his armor rung,<br>  As horse and man to earth were flung;<br>  O'er broken steel his crimson blood<br>  Fast steam'd to earth in ample flood;<br>  By fallen steed he writhed with pain,<br>  And never to arise again.<br>  As to earth that champion came,<br>  Died in the air that flash of flame;<br>  Swift from the hemisphere it sailed,<br>  And the darkness grim again prevailed<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXXIII.<br>  <br>  Then favored by the solid gloom,<br>  That gathered as the dread simoom,<br>  Like whirlwind on that armed band<br>  Rode Arthur's knight with flaming brand;<br>  As through a grove of saplings strong<br>  The horrid cyclone sweeps along,<br>  Uproots and tears them from the ground,<br>  And strews them all in ruin round;<br>  Wide is its path and grim and dread<br>  The devastation 'neath it spread;<br>  When past the groves, it stays its course,<br>  Then back returns with tenfold force;<br>  Another path of ruin dread<br>  Behind its roaring flight is spread;<br>  So through that grove of lances bright,<br>  Rode to and fro King Arthur's knight;<br>  And all before him, right and left,<br>  Went down with heads and helmets cleft,<br>  Slaughtered and dying strew the ground<br>  While armor clangs with horrid sound<br>  And thunders through those ramparts tall,<br>  Like waters o'er some mighty fall--<br>  And echo over hill and glen.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXXIV.<br>  <br>  Not tamely died those armed men:<br>  They closed upon King Arthur's knight,<br>  With sword and spear and axes bright;<br>  Three times they closed in fierce array,<br>  And three times stopped his gory way,<br>  While on his shield with horrid clang<br>  Their spears and swords and axes rang.<br>  With fearful din they closed on him,<br>  Like roarings of the lions grim<br>  Upon the night o'er shadowed wild,<br>  With reeking slaughter round them piled;<br>  And hunger drives them on amain,<br>  To make themselves tombs of the slain.<br>  They closed like angry billows' shock,<br>  At midnight on a solid rock,<br>  Whose lofty head with giant pines<br>  Towering o'er the deep inclines;<br>  Who while the floods are rocked below,<br>  The roaring storms that o'er them blow;<br>  In thousand shapes their branches throw,<br>  And from them make fell tumult flow;<br>  The branches clash, the waters roar,<br>  On tempests mingled tumults pour,<br>  And waked by nature's fierce unrest<br>  The eagles leave their lofty nest;<br>  And mounting on the tempest's car,<br>  High o'er the elemental jar,<br>  They flap their wings, then whirl around,<br>  Send far their screams on night profound;<br>  So on that knight those men closed in,<br>  With trumpet's clang and armor's din.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXXV.<br>  <br>  But while amidst that darkness dread<br>  Their blows at Arthur's knight they sped,<br>  Full many a warrior's buckler broad<br>  Was rent by his own comrade's sword;<br>  Full many a brawny bosom there<br>  Was pierced by its own comrade's spear;<br>  By scores they fell amongst the slain,<br>  By their own men, not Beau de Main;<br>  Yet fought that hero fierce and grim,<br>  'Till not one living stood round him.<br>  Died out the trumpet's stirring peal,<br>  And ceased the horrid clang of steel;<br>  Then through the darkness burst a flame,<br>  That gleaming o'er the ramparts came,<br>  And ceased of pain, the horrid din<br>  That roar'd like storms those walls within;<br>  The setting sun his glory threw,<br>  Around and all that gloom withdrew;<br>  There round the hero lay his foes,<br>  All stark and still in dread repose;<br>  There broken armor strew'd the ground,<br>  Heads cleft or pierced with wounds profound:<br>  They lay in reeking crimson drown'd.<br>  None save that hero and his guide<br>  Were living 'midst that wreck espied.<br>  Where that huge steed and rider lay<br>  Those twain there bent their eager way;<br>  His towering plume of sable hue<br>  From off his glittering helm they drew;<br>  Then doff his helm and visor all,<br>  Full on his face the sunbeams fall.<br>  Darker than night his shaggy beard,<br>  Matted o'er visage stern appeared;<br>  A savage frown those features wore,<br>  As always in their life they bore;<br>  And glared his eyes in death unclosed,<br>  As fierce as when he foe opposed;<br>  Dark as the shades of night were they,<br>  And gleam'd in death with piercing ray;<br>  O'er them his brows descending flowed,<br>  Black as e'er raven's plumaged glowed;<br>  Like eagle's bill his massive nose<br>  Descending o'er his mouth arose;<br>  But this was hid from human eye,<br>  With heavy beard of sable dye;<br>  A fiercer countenance on man<br>  Than his, ne'er yet did nature scan.<br>  Taking his face and bearing all,<br>  His mighty statue broad and tall,<br>  Ponderous limbs of massive length,<br>  That all bespoke a monster's strength;<br>  He seem'd more like a Titan grim<br>  Than one of mortal form and limb.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXXVI.<br>  <br>  But he was one of mortal mould,<br>  A giant cruel, strong and bold,<br>  As in history we are told<br>  Were often seen in days of old,<br>  And wrought to mortal's dole and wrong.<br>  His were those bulwarks tall and strong,<br>  Whose walls of rock so broad and high,<br>  Might wear of storm and time defy;<br>  Whose bristling parapets and towers<br>  Scoffing frown'd at human powers.<br>  Right often did King Arthur's ear<br>  Strange stories of these ramparts hear;<br>  They told him of its mighty lord,<br>  His savage statue tall and broad,<br>  In size surpassing those of earth,<br>  And who from monsters drew his birth;<br>  Who lived on flesh of mortal men,<br>  And drank their blood; who in his den<br>  Unnumbered captives held in thrall.<br>  Good knights and gentle ladies all.<br>  But never could King Arthur's eye<br>  The passage to those walls descry--<br>  By day and night the path he sought,<br>  But ne'er a clue to it he caught;<br>  Or unto it had sped that king,<br>  With all the knights that he could bring.<br>  And he had raised that bulwark's wall,<br>  Those captives straight had set from thrall,<br>  Or he had with them found his fall<br>  Beneath that grisly giant tall;<br>  But of road or path no single clue<br>  To reach those walls could Arthur view,<br>  So safe from hand of mortal foe<br>  They proudly scoffed at all below,<br>  And safe within its lofty hold<br>  Dwelt its tyrant owner fierce and bold,<br>  Surrounded by a mighty throng<br>  Of followers, haughty, huge and strong,<br>  Who through the force of Beau de Main<br>  Were numbered 'mongst the gory slain.<br>  And for allies the giant sought<br>  All who in necromancy wrought;<br>  All conjurers of magic spell<br>  Who wrought on earth the lore of hell;<br>  Who could enchantments cast around,<br>  And men with wizard's charms confound;<br>  All those who could those arts unfold<br>  Found favor in that lofy hold;<br>  Through them he hidden kept the road<br>  From men that led to his abode.<br>  But ways there were and more than three<br>  That gave egress and ingress free,<br>  By which could pass both steeds and men,<br>  From there unto the distant glen,<br>  Easier far and safer more<br>  Than that De Main had travelled o'er.<br>  And when a destined deed he'll do,<br>  He'll break the subtle secrets through,<br>  To every road he'll find the clue<br>  And easily each road he pursue.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp   XXXVII.<br>  <br>  In glowing chambers of the West<br>  The sun's in all his glory drest,<br>  Basking beneath his tingeing smile<br>  Float round unnumbered clouds the while,<br>  O'er his bright disk their forms they throw,<br>  And 'neath him all resplendent glow.<br>  All o'er the sky the clouds are rolled<br>  With hues of amber and of gold,<br>  With forms apart by sunbeams torn,<br>  They all the western skies adorn.<br>  But in the East a mighty cloud<br>  Doth all the sky with sable shroud;<br>  From earth unto the zenith's bound,<br>  It spread its robe of gloom profound;<br>  But bright on the darkness that it reared<br>  A vision of glory there appeared;<br>  It came like a spirit on the cloud,<br>  Whose beauty could no darkness shroud;<br>  It spread in a glorious arch,<br>  From horizon to zenith did march.<br>  Then sublime in its grandeur it stood,<br>  O'er hanging the mountains and wood,<br>  The valleys, the torrents, and flood,<br>  Tingeing their flow with the hues of blood;<br>  Sped the rays of the sun from the land,<br>  Yet, that iris the heavens still spann'd;<br>  Near the earth it ends darkened anon,<br>  While in the zenith it still beam'd on,<br>  Smiled on earth like an angel of light,<br>  'Till the sunbeams departed from sight.<br>  Then away like a phantom it fled,<br>  And dense darkness after it sped.<br>  Night o'er the mountains her banner unfurl'd,<br>  And solid gloom settled over the world.<br>  <br>   &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp    &amp;nbsp
