Whereat Lavaine<br>  Greatly rejoic'd and gladly would have died<br>  To serve in any wise the blameless King.<br>  But when the sun came from the under world<br>  And shone upon that field of battle near<br>  The winter sea, Lavaine by Arthur's side<br>  Receiv'd a vengeful thrust aim'd at the King,<br>  And from his horse, slow reeling, fell, and o'er<br>  Him swept the host; but bluff Sir Torre, who saw<br>  His brother fall, came spurring hence and dragg'd<br>  Him to one side, and there, in knightly wise,<br>  Gave him such tendance as his wit devis'd,<br>  And left him, guarded by a humble squire,<br>  But thinking, "If I live, I will return;"<br>  And scarce an hour was gone before a stroke<br>  From one of Modred's men had cleft Sir Torre<br>  From brain to nape.  So died he for his Lord.<br>  <br>  But of his tendance or his death Lavaine<br>  Knew naught, but lay in stupor deep as death,<br>  And to the eye that watch'd he seem'd as dead.<br>  Whereat the humble squire mus'd to himself:<br>  <br>  "If he be dead, he needs not me to guard;<br>  And if he be alive his foes will think<br>  Him dead, and truly I do deem him dead,<br>  Yet be he dead or living I must see<br>  The issue of the fight," and saying went<br>  And saw, and, seeing, met the death which might<br>  Have spar'd him by the side of Sir Lavaine.<br>  <br>  "So all day long the noise of battle roll'd,"<br>  Yet Sir Lavaine in stupor lay upon<br>  The field until the sun went down, and shone<br>  The moon at full upon his armor clasps<br>  And glinted on the chasing of his sword.<br>  As one who journeying in lands remote<br>  Returning takes by slow degrees the old<br>  Life up, so Sir Lavaine return'd from death<br>  Or what had seem'd like death, not all at once<br>  But dimly had a knowledge of his state<br>  And what had past, and then, because too weak<br>  To think, he fell in sleep again and wak'd<br>  Not till the sun brake from the underworld,<br>  And near him, having watch'd the barge that bore<br>  King Arthur out of sight, there slowly drew<br>  The bold Sir Bedivere.  These two last left<br>  Alive upon the field.<br>  <br>                                         The mournful twain<br>  At length slow moving from the field, because<br>  Lavaine was weak from hunger and the wound,<br>  Past on to where within a little wood<br>  A simple hermit liv'd a blameless life.<br>  With him the pair abode until Lavaine<br>  Was heal'd and then the bold Sir Bedivere<br>  Past to his own land, distant Cameliard,<br>  And then, a little later, past Lavaine<br>  To his.<br>  <br>                       Small joy was now at Astolat<br>  For him, the last of all his race, and night<br>  And day he seem'd to hear the lily maid<br>  Singing her swan song from the eastern tow'r,<br>  Or bluff Sir Torre stride thro' the broken halls,<br>  Or else his father, dead a year agone,<br>  Calling him tenderly as was his wont,<br>  And so by always listening to the dead<br>  He ceased to hearken to the living voice,<br>  And more and more withdrew into himself.<br>  <br>  But when the next approaching spring had fail'd<br>  To stir the languid blood within his veins,<br>  The dumb old servitor before him stood<br>  One April morning in the castle yard<br>  And pointed to the south, and then by signs<br>  Essay'd to free his mind, and Sir Lavaine,<br>  Half comprehending, asked him, "Shall I go<br>  Thither?"  Thereat the dumb old man nodded,<br>  His finger once more pointing to the south.<br>  So, deeming that his humble servitor<br>  Had deeper knowledge of the best, Lavaine,<br>  A little later gathering the few<br>  Who serv'd for love, not hire, within the halls<br>  Of Astolat, past with them into lands<br>  Of Cornish name, and made a home for them<br>  And for himself; and, marrying a maid<br>  Of Cornish race, saw children of his own<br>  And all the past became a memory.<br>  <br>  Before his home in Cornwall lay the sea,<br>  And a thick wood behind it northward stretch'd<br>  But to the left a dusty white road climb'd<br>  A hill on which there frown'd a single tow'r,<br>  And on the farther side a hamlet slept<br>  In peace and plenty, owning him for lord.<br>  There o'er his Cornish castle past the years<br>  From churlish winter into spring until<br>  Ten times the ash buds blackened with the winds<br>  Of March since blameless Arthur past beyond<br>  The mournful gaze of bold Sir Bedivere.<br>  <br>  A younger copy of himself, or like<br>  Himself when but eight tender seasons old,<br>  Now listen'd, wonder-ey'd, to Sir Lavaine<br>  When he would talk of arms and of the last<br>  Great day in Lyonnesse.  Jack had the lad<br>  Been call'd for some past claimant for the hand<br>  Of her Lavaine call'd wife, yet this Lavaine<br>  Knew not, but deem'd the unfamiliar name<br>  A careless fancy of his Cornish wife's,<br>  Whose lightest fancy 'twas his care to please.<br>  Slender the lad, as once his father was,<br>  But all the blood of lusty Astolat<br>  Made summer in his veins.  Seldom apart<br>  From him his sister Gillian was, and each<br>  Without the other droopt and pin'd.  Most like<br>  Her aunt, the dead Elaine, young Gillian seem'd,<br>  And oft the father, looking at her, felt<br>  Remembrance of the distant past confuse<br>  The present, till if he were boy or man<br>  And this his child or playmate sister seem'd<br>  Sometimes a thing of doubt.<br>  <br>                                  The two, the maid<br>  And Jack, lov'd better than all else to climb<br>  The long white road, that steep and stony, led<br>  Up to the single, broken, frowning tow'r.<br>  Four trees beside the tow'r bent o'er a spring<br>  That broke from out a sombre, rocky cleft.<br>  Here Tristram once had drunk with fair Iseult,<br>  Mark's wife, and laught to see the shining drops<br>  Slip thro' her fingers, when she held her hand<br>  Cupwise, that he might drink therefrom.  And here<br>  Had sweet Sir Percivale once stopt to drink,<br>  Returning from the Quest of Holy Grail;<br>  Here, too, had Pelleas, the bright boy knight,<br>  A brief hour linger'd, flying from the court<br>  In that dark time when all his early faith<br>  In woman's virtue died, and good Sir Bors,<br>  The false Gawain, the pure Sir Galahad,<br>  And many more of that great Table Round<br>  Had drunk from these sweet waters to their gain.<br>  Full oft had Gillian and the stripling Jack<br>  Bent o'er the spring as bent the trees above,<br>  And laught to see two faces gazing up,<br>  One fair and pale, the other fair and red.<br>  Maid Gillian's was the one, the other his.<br>  <br>  Now as it hapt, Lavaine in that tenth year<br>  Fell ill of some dull fever in the blood,<br>  And twenty mornings past and still the knight<br>  Felt the slow poison creeping thro' his veins<br>  And grew at last indifferent to the end.<br>  To him maid Gillian pityingly came<br>  And said with tears:<br>              "Sure am I that one thing<br>  Would cure this deadly fever."<br>  <br>              Then Lavaine:<br>  "Yea, dost thou think it, little maid? then let<br>  Me hear."<br>              Then she:<br>              "A draught of water brought<br>  From spring beside the tow'r would cure, so pure<br>  It is and sweet, and Jack and I would bring<br>  It gladly an' 'twould please you drink, my lord."<br>  To whom the sick man answer'd wearily,<br>  Yet thinking she by chance had spoken truth<br>  As he bethought him of the water's fame:<br>  "Child, since you wish it, bring, and I will drink."<br>  <br>  Thereat and lightly sprang the maiden down<br>  The steps that led to outer air, and close<br>  Beside came Jack, a silver vessel swung<br>  From one small hand, and so the childish twain<br>  Went up the hill and quickly reach'd its top.<br>  Then Jack, with Gill beside, stoopt low and fill'd<br>  The vessel till the drops did chase themselves<br>  All down its burnisht sides.  This done, they left<br>  The spring, and holding each the vessel's rim,<br>  Return'd as they had come, but slower, lest<br>  By haste the precious draught were spilt and lost.<br>  Then as in distance smaller grew the tow'r<br>  Behind, the maid broke out in tender song:<br>  <br>  "Sweet is the sunshine coming after rain;<br>  And sweet this water unto lips in pain:<br>  Which is the sweeter? that in truth know I.<br>  <br>  "Light, art thou sweet? then sweeter waters be:<br>  Light, thou art grateful; sweet this draught to me.<br>  O light, if death be near him, let me die.<br>  <br>  "Sweet light that fades at eve too soon away,<br>  Sweet waters springing from the dark to day,<br>  Which is the sweeter? that in truth know I.<br>  <br>  "Pain, follow night, and henceforth from him flee;<br>  Thou needs must follow night that waits for thee;<br>  But, if thou wilt not, then O let me die."<br>  <br>  Clear with the last line rang her voice, and Jack,<br>  Who heeded not his ways when Gillian sang,<br>  Slipt, as the last note ceas'd, upon a piece<br>  Of sliding stone, and slipping, fell, dragging<br>  The singer down, and both together roll'd,<br>  All in a horror of loose stones and dust<br>  And flying limbs and broken bones and crowns,<br>  Far down the steep side of that rocky hill.<br>  So perish'd these two of the fated house<br>  Of Astolat; and in the night that follow'd,<br>  And near a dawning fierce with wind and rain,<br>  Wherein the sea wag'd battle with the sky<br>  And both with earth, to final judgment past<br>  Lavaine.<br>
