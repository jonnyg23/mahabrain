 <center><h1>The Two Gossips</h1></center>
   <p>
 At Minane, near Tracton, there was a young couple whose name
   was Mac Daniel, and they had such a fine, wholesome-looking child, that the
   fairies determined on having it in their company, and putting a changeling in
   its place; but it so happened that Mrs. Mac Daniel had a gossip whose name was
   Norah Buckeley, and she was going by the house they lived in (it was a nice
   new slated one, by the same token) just coming on the dusk of the evening. She
   thought it too late to step in and ask how her gossip was, as she had above a
   mile and half further to go, and moreover she knew the fairies were abroad,
   for all along the road before her from Carrigaline, one eddy of dust would be
   followed by another, which was a plain sign that the good people were out
   taking their rounds; and she had pains in her hones with dropping so many <i>curchies
   </i>(courtesies). However, Norah Buckeley, when she came opposite her gossip's
   house, stopped short, and made another, and said almost under her breath,
   "God keep all here from harm!" No sooner had these words been
   uttered than she saw one of the windows lifted up, and her gossip's beautiful
   child without any more to do handed out; she could not tell, if her life
   depended on it, how, or by whom: no matter for that, she went to the window
   and took the child from whatever handed it, and covered it well up in her
   cloak, and carried it away home with her.</p>
 
   <p>
 Next morning early she went over to see her gossip, who began
   to make a great moan to her, of how different her child was from what it had
   ever been before, crying all the night, and keeping her awake, and how nothing
   she could think of would quiet it.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 " I'll tell you what you'll do with the
 brat," said Norah Buckeley, Iooking as knowing as if she knew more than all
 the rest of the world: "whip it well first, and then bring it to the
 cross-roads, and leave the fairy in the ditch there for any one to take that
 pleases; for I have your own child at home safe and sound as he was handed out
 of the window last night to me."</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Mrs. Mac Daniel on hearing this, when the surprise was over,
 stepped out to get a rod, and her gossip happening for one instant to look after
 her, on turning round again, found the fairy gone, and neither she nor the
 child's mother saw any more of it, nor could ever hear a word of tidings how it
 disappeared in so wonderful a manner.</p>
 
 <p>
 Mrs. Mac Daniel went over with great speed to her gossip's
 house, and there she got her own child, and brought him back with her, and a
 stout young man he is at this day.</p>

 Tracton is situated about ten miles south of Cork, in a district
 usually called "Daunt's Country," from the residence of several
 families of that name. Tracton Abbey, now completely demolished, was formerly a
 place of some celebrity ; see Archdale's Monasticon Hibernicum, and Dr. Smith's
 History of Cork.</p>
 
 <p>
 In 1781, James Dennis, Chief Baron of the Exchequer, was created
 Baron Tracton, of Tracton Abbey; which title became extinct on his demise the
 following year. Lord Tracton was buried in the cathedral of Cork; and, what is
 curious, a noble monument to his memory, possibly the largest and best piece of
 statuary in the south of Ireland, is placed in the parish church of St.
 Nicholas, the smallest in that city.</p>
 
 <p>
 An eddy of dust, raised by the wind, is supposed by the
 superstitious peasantry to be occasioned by the journeying of a fairy troop from
 one of their haunts to another, and the same civilities are scrupulously
 observed towards the invisible riders as if the dust had been caused by a
 company of the most important persons in the country. In Scotland, the sound of
 bridles ringing through the air accompanies the whirlwind which marks the
 progress of a fairy journey.</p>
 
 <p>
 The invisible agency by which the child was thrust out of the
 window will find a parallel in many stories, particularly in one related by
 Waldron, the Isle of Man chronicler.</p>
 
 <p>
 At Minane, the scene of this tale, the finest specimens hitherto
 discovered of a rare mineral, called hydrargillite or wavellite, have been dug
 up.</p>
