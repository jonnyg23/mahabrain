   <p>
 THE kitchen of some country houses in
   Ireland presents in no ways a bad modern translation of the ancient feudal
   hall. Traces of clanship still linger round its hearth in the numerous
   depend-ants on "the master's" bounty. Nurses, foster-brothers, and
   other hangers on, are there as matter of right, while the strolling piper,
   full of mirth and music, the benighted traveller, even the passing beggar, are
   received with a hearty welcome, and each contributes planxty, song, or
   superstitious tale, towards the evening's amusement.</p>
 
   <p>
 An assembly, such as has been described,
   had collected round the kitchen fire of Ballyrahenhouse, at the foot of the
   Galtee mountains, when, as is ever the case, one tale of wonder called forth
   another; and with the advance of the evening each succeeding story was
   received with deep and deeper attention. The history of Cough na Looba's dance
   with the black friar at Rahill, and the fearful tradition of <i>Coum an 'ir
   morriv </i>(the dead man's hollow), were listened to in breathless silence. A
   pause followed the last relation, and all eyes rested on the narrator, an old
   nurse who occupied the post of honour, that next the fireside. She was seated
   in that peculiar position which the Irish name " <i>Currigguib," </i>a
   position generally assumed by a veteran and determined storyteller.. Her
   haunches resting upon the ground, and her feet bundled under the body; her
   arms folded across and supported by her knees, and the outstretched chin of
   her hooded head pressing on. the upper arm; which compact arrangement nearly
   reduced the whole figure into a perfect triangle.</p>
 
   <p>
 Unmoved by the general gaze, Bridget Doyle
   made no change. of attitude, while she. gravely asserted the truth of the
   marvellous tale concerning the Dead Man's Hollow; her strongly marked
   countenance at the time receiving what painters term a fine chiaro obscuro
   effect from the fire-light.</p>
 
   <p>
 "I have told you," she said,
   "what happened to my own people, the Butlers and the Doyle, in the old
   times; but here is little Ellen Connell from the county Cork, who can speak to
   what happened under her own father and mother's roof -the Lord be good to them
   !"</p>
 
   <p>
 Ellen, a young and blooming girl of about
   sixteen, was employed in the dairy at Ballyrahen. She was the picture of
   health and rustic beauty; and at this hint from nurse Doyle, a deep blush
   mantled over her countenance; yet, although "unaccustomed to public
   speaking," she, without further hesitation or excuse, proceeded as
   follows : -</p>
 
   <p>
 "It was one May eve, about thirteen
   years ago, and that is, as every body knows, the airiest day in all the twelve
   months. It is the day above all other days," said Ellen, with her large
   dark eyes cast down on the ground, and drawing a deep sigh, "when the
   young boys and the young girls go looking after the <i>Drutheen, </i>to learn
   from it rightly the name of their sweethearts.</p>
 
   <p>
 "My father, and my mother, and my two
   brothers, with two or three of the neighbours, were sitting round the turf
   fire, and were talking of one thing or another. My mother was hushoing my
   little sister, striving to quieten her, for she was<i> </i>cutting her teeth
   at the time, and was mighty uneasy through the means of them. The day, which
   was threatening all along, now that it was coming on to dusk, began to rain,
   and the rain increased and fell fast and faster, as if it was pouring through
   a sieve out of the wide heavens; and when the rain stopped for a bit there was
   a wind which kept up such a whistling and racket, that you would have thought
   the sky and the earth were coming together. It blew and it blew as if it had a
   mind to blow the roof off the cabin, and that would not have been very hard
   for it to do, as the thatch was quite loose in two or three places. Then the
   rain began again, and you could hear it spitting and hissing in the fire, as
   it came down through the big <i>chimbley.</i></p>
 
   
   <p>
 " ' God bless us,' says my mother,
   'but 't is a dreadful night to be at sea,' says she, 'and God be praised that
   we have a roof, bad as it is, to shelter us.'</p>
 
   <p>
 "I don't, to be sure, recollect all
   this, mistress Doyle, but only as my brothers told it to me, and other people,
   and often have I heard it; for I was so little then, that they say I could
   just go under the table without tipping my head. Anyway, it was in the very
   height of the pelting and whistling that we heard something speak outside the
   door. My father and all of us listened, but there was no more noise at that
   time. We' waited a little longer, and then we plainly heard a' sound like an
   old man's voice, asking to be let in, but mighty feeble and weak. Tim bounced
   up, with-out a word, to ask us whether we 'd like to let the old mam, or
   whoever he was, in - having always a heart as soft as a mealy potato before
   the voice of sorrow. When Tim pulled back the bolt that did the door; in
   marched a little bit of a shrivelled, weather-beaten creature, about two feet
   and a half high.</p>
 
   <p>
 "We were all watching to see who 'd
   come in, for there was a wall between us and the door; but when the sound of
   the undoing of the bolt stopped, we heard Tim give a sort of a screech, and
   instantly he bolted in to us. He had hardly time to say a word, or we either,
   when. the little gentleman shuffled in after. him, without a God save all
   here, or by your leave, or any other sort that of. thing that any decent body
   might say. We all of one accord, scrambled over to the furthest end. of the
   room, where we were, old and young, every one. trying who'd get nearest the
   wall, and farthest from him. All the eyes of our body we're stuck upon him,
   but he didn't mind us no more than that frying-pan there does now. He walked
   over to the fire, and squatting himself down like a frog, took the pipe that
   my father dropped from his mouth in the hurry, put it into his own<b>, </b>and
   then began to smoke so hearty, that he soon filled the room of it.</p>
 
   <p>
 "We had plenty of time to observe him,
   and my brothers say that he wore a sugar-loaf hat that was as red as blood: he
   had a face as yellow as a kite's claw, and as long as to-day and to-morrow put
   together, with a mouth all screwed and puckered up like a washer-woman's hand,
   little blue eyes, and rather a highish nose; his hair was quite grey and
   lengthy, appearing under his hat, and flowing over the cape of a long scarlet
   coat, which almost trailed the ground behind him, and the ends of which he
   took up and planked on his knees to dry, as he sat facing the fire. He had
   smart corduroy breeches, and woollen stockings drawn up over the knees, so as
   to hide the kneebuckles, if he had the pride to have them; but, at any rate,
   if he hadn't them in his knees he had buckles in his shoes, out before his
   spindle legs. When we came to ourselves a little we thought to escape from the
   room, but no one would go first, nor no one would stay last; so we huddled
   ourselves together and made a dart out of the room. My little gentleman never
   minded any thing of the scrambling, nor hardly stirred himself, sitting quite
   at his ease before the fire. The neighbours, the very instant minute they got
   to the door, although it still continued pelting rain, cut gutter as if Oliver
   Cromwell himself was at their heels; and no blame to them for that, anyhow. It
   was my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and myself, a little
   hop-of-my-thumb midge as I was then, that were left to see what would come out
   of this strange visit; so we all went quietly to the <i>labbig </i>[<i>Labbig</i>
   - bed, from <i>Leaba</i>. - Vide O'Brien and O'Reilly] scarcely daring to
   throw an eye at him as we passed the door. Never the wink of sleep could they
   sleep that live-long night, though, to be sure, I slept like a top, not
   knowing better, while they were talking and thinking of the little man.</p>
 
   <p>
 "When they got up in the morning every
   thing was as quiet and as tidy about the place as if nothing had happened, for
   all that the chairs and stools were tumbled here, there, and everywhere, when
   we saw the lad enter. Now, indeed, I forget whether he came next night or not,
   but anyway, that was the first time we ever laid eye upon him. This I know for
   certain, that, about a month after that he came regularly every night, and
   used to give us a signal to be on the move, for 't was plain he did not like
   to be observed. This sign was always made about eleven o'clock.; and then, if
   we 'd look towards the door, there was a little hairy arm thrust. in through
   the key-hole, which would not have been big enough, only there was a fresh
   hole made near the. first one, and the bit of stick between them had been
   broken away, and so 't was just fitting for the littIe arm.</p>
 
   <p>
 " The Fir darrig continued his visits,
   never missing a night, as long as we attended to the signal; smoking always
   out of the pipe he made his<b> </b>own of; and warming himself till day dawned
   before the fire, and then going no one living kows where: but there was not
   the least mark of him to he found in the morning; and 't is as true, nurse
   Doyle, and honest people, as you are all here sitting before me and by the
   side of me, that the family continued thriving, and my father and brothers
   rising in the world while ever he came to us. When we observed this, we used
   always look for the very moment to see when the arm would come, and then we'd
   instantly fly off with ourselves to our rest. But before we found the luck, we
   used sometimes sit still and not mind the arm, especially when a neighbour
   would be with my father, or that two or three or four of them would have a
   drop among them, and then they did not care for all the arms, hairy or not,
   that ever were seen. No one, however, dared to speak to it or of it
   insolently, except, indeed, one night that Davy Kennane - but he was drunk -
   walked over and hit it a rap on the back of the wrist: the hand was snatched
   off like lightning; but every one knows that Davy did not live a month after
   this happened, though he was only about ten days sick. The like of such tricks
   are ticklish things to do.</p>
 
   <p>
 "As sure as the red man would put in
   his arm for a sign through the hole in the door, and that we did not go and
   open it to him, so sure some mishap befel the cattle: the cows were
   elf-stoned, or overlooked, or something or another went wrong with them. One
   night my brother Dan refused to go at the signal, and the next day, as he was
   cutting turf in Crogh-na-drimina bog, within a mile and a half of the house, a
   stone was thrown at him which broke fairly, with the force, into two halves.
   Now, if that had happened to hit him he'd be at this hour as dead as my great
   great-grandfather. It came whack-slap against the spade he had in his. hand,
   and split at once in two pieces. He took them up and fitted them together and
   they made a perfect heart. Some way or the other he lost it since, hut he
   still has the one which was shot at the spotted milch cow, before the little
   man came near us. Many and many a time I saw that same; 'tis just the shape of
   the ace of hearts on the cards, only it is of a dark-red colour, and polished
   up like the grate that is in the grand parlour within.. When this did not kill
   the cow on the spot, she swelled up; but if you took and put the elf-stone
   under her udder, and milked her upon it to the last stroking, and then made
   her drink the milk, it would cure her, and she would thrive with you ever
   after.</p>
 
   <p>
 But, as I said, we were getting. on well
   enough as long as we minded the door and watched for the hairy arm, which we
   did sharp enough when we found it was bringing luck to us, and we were now as
   glad to see the little red gentleman; and as ready to open the door to him, as
   we used to dread his coming at first and be frightened of him. But at long
   last we throve so well that the landlord - God forgive him -. took notice of
   us, and envied us, and asked my father how he came by the penny he had, and
   wanted him to take more ground at a rack-rent that was more than any Christian
   ought to pay to another, seeing there was no making it. When my father - and
   small blame to him for that - refused to lease the ground, he turned us off
   the bit of land we had, and out of the house and all, and left us in a wide
   and wicked world, where my father, for he was a<i> </i>soft innocent man, was
   not up to the roguery and the trickery that was practised upon him. He was
   taken this way by one and that way by another, and he treating them that were
   working his downfall. And he used. to take bite and sup with them, and they
   with him, free enough as long . as the money lasted; but when that was gone,
   and he had not as much ground, that he could call his own, as would sod a
   lark, they soon shabbed him off. The landlord died not long after; and he now
   knows whether he acted right or wrong in taking the house from over our heads.</p>
 
   <p>
 "It is a bad thing for the heart to be
   cast down, so we took another cabin, and looked out with great desire for the
   Fir darrig to come to us. But ten o'clock came and no arm, although we cut a
   hole in the. door just the <i>moral</i> (model) of the other. Eleven o'clock !
   - twelve o'clock ! -no, not a sign of him,: and every night we watched, but
   all would not do. We then travelled to the other house, and we rooted up the
   hearth, for the landlord asked so great a rent for it from the poor people
   that no one could take it; and we carried away the very door off the hinges,
   and we brought every thing with us that we thought the little man was in any
   respect partial to, but he did not come, and we never saw him again.</p>
 
   <p>
 "My father and my mother, and my young
   sister, are since dead, and my two brothers, who could tell all about this
   better than myself are both of them gone out with Ingram in his last voyage to
   the Cape of Good Hope, leaving me behind without kith or kin."</p>
 
   <p>
 Here. young Ellen's voice became choked
   with sorrow, and bursting into tears, she hid her face in her apron.</p>
