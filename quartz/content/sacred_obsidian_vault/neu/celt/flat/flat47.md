 <center><h1>Letter from Sir Walter Scott to the author of the Irish Fairy Legends</h1></center>
   <p>
 SIR, -- I have been obliged by the
   courtesy which sent me your very interesting work on "Irish
   Superstitions," and no less by the amusement which it has afforded me,
   both from the interest of the stories and the lively manner in which they are
   told. You are to consider this, sir, as a high compliment from one who holds
   him on the subject of elves, ghosts, visions, etc., nearly as strong as
   William Churns of Staffordshire:</p>
 
       <p>
 "Who every year can mend your
       cheer<br>
 
       With tales both old and new."</p>
 
   <p>
 The extreme similarity of your fictions to
   ours in Scotland is very striking. The Cluricaune (which is an admirable
   subject for a pantomime) is not known here. I suppose the Scottish cheer was
   not sufficient to tempt to the hearth either him, or that singular demon
   called by Heywood the Buttery Spirit, which diminished the profits of an
   unjust landlord by eating up all that he cribbed for his guests.</p>
 
   <p>
 The beautiful superstition of the Banshee
   seems in a great measure peculiar to Ireland, though in some Highland families
   there is such a spectre, particularly in that of MacLean of Lochbuy; but I
   think I could match all your other tales with something similar.</p>
 
   <p>
 I can assure you, however, that the
   progress of philosophy has not even yet entirely "pulled the old woman
   out of our hearts," as Addison expresses it. Witches are still held in
   reasonable detestation, although we no longer burn or even <i>score above the
   breath. </i>As for the water bull, they live who will take their oaths to
   having seen him emerge from a small lake on the boundary of my property here,
   scarce large enough to have held him, I should think. Some traits in his
   description seem to answer the hippopotamus, and these are always mentioned in
   Highland and Lowland story. Strange if we could conceive there existed, under
   a tradition so universal, some shadowy reference to those fossil bones of
   animals which are so often found in the lakes and bogs.</p>
 
   <p>
 But to leave antediluvian stories for the
   freshest news from Fairyland, I cannot resist the temptation to send you an
   account of King Oberon's court, which was verified before me as a
   magistrate, with all the solemnities of a court of justice, within this
   fortnight past. A young shepherd, a lad of about eighteen years of age, well
   brought up and of good capacity, and, that I may be perfectly accurate, in the
   service of a friend, a most respectable farmer at Oakwood, on the estate of
   Hugh Scott, Esq. of Harden, made oath and said, that going to look after some
   sheep which his master had directed to be put upon turnips, and passing in the
   grey of the morning a small copse-wood adjacent to the River Etterick, he was
   surprised at the sight of four or five little personages, about two feet or
   thirty inches in height, who were seated under the trees and apparently in
   deep conversation. At this singular appearance he paused till he bad refreshed
   his noble courage with a prayer and a few recollections of last Sunday's
   sermon, and then advanced to the little party. But observing that, instead of
   disappearing, they seemed to become yet more magnificently distinct than
   before, and now doubting nothing, from their foreign dresses and splendid
   decorations, that they were the choice ornaments of the fairy court, he fairly
   turned tail and went "to raise the water," as if the South'ron had
   made a raid. Others came to the rescue, and yet the fairy <i>cortege </i>awaited
   their arrival in still and silent dignity. I wish I could stop here, for the
   devil take all explanations, they stop duels and destroy the credit of
   apparitions, neither allow ghosts to be made in an honourable way or to be 'believed
   in (poor souls !) when they revisit the glimpses of the moon.</p>
 
   <p>
 I must however explain, like other
   honourable gentlemen, elsewhere. You must know, that like our neighbours, we
   have a school of arts for our mechanics at O--,a small manufacturing town in
   this country, and. that the tree of knowledge there, as elsewhere, produces
   its usual crop of good and evil. The day before this avatar of Oberon was a
   fair-day at Selkirk, and amongst other popular divertisements was one which,
   in former days, I would have called a puppet show, and its master a puppet
   showman. He has put me right, however, by informing me, that he writes 'himself
   <i>artist from Vauxhall, </i>and that he exhibits <i>fantoccini; </i>call them
   what you will, it seems they gave great delight to the unwashed artificers of
   G----. Formerly they would have been contented to wonder and applaud, but
   not so were they satisfied in our modern days of investigation, for they broke
   into Punch's sanctuary forcibly, after he had been laid aside for the
   evening, made violent seizure of his person, and carried off him, his spouse,
   and heaven knows what captives besides, in their plaid nooks, to be examined
   at leisure. All this they literally did (forcing a door to accomplish their
   purpose) in the spirit of science alone, or but slightly stimulated by that of
   malt whisky, with which last we have been of late deluged. Cool reflection
   came as they retreated by the banks of the Etterick; they made the discovery
   that they could no more make Punch move than Lord -- could make him speak;
   and recollecting, I believe, that there was such a person as the Sheriff in
   the world, they abandoned their<i> </i>prisoners, in hopes, as they pretended,
   that they would be found and restored in safety to their proper owner.</p>
 
   <p>
 It is only necessary to add that the artist
   had his losses made good by a subscription, and the scientific inquirers
   escaped with a small fine, as a warning not to indulge such an irregular
   spirit of research in future.</p>
 
   <p>
 As this somewhat tedious story contains the
   very last news from Fairyland, I hope you will give it acceptance, and beg you
   to believe me very much, your obliged and thankful servant,</p>
 
   <p>
