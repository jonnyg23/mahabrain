 <center><h1>The Legend of Knockfierna</h1></center>
   <p>
 [Kockfierna<b>: </b>Called by the people of the country <i>'Knock
   Dhoinn Firinne,' </i>the mountain of Donn of Truth. This mountain is very
   high, and may be seen for several miles round; and when people are desirous to
   know whether or not any. day will rain, they look at the top of Knock Firinn,
   and if they see a vapour or mist there, they immediately conclude that rain
   will soon follow, believing that Donn (the lord or chief) of that mountain and
   his aerial assistants are collecting the clouds, and that he holds them there
   for some short time, to warn the people of the approaching rain. As the
   appearance of mist on that mountain in the morning is considered an infallible
   sign that, that day will be rainy, Donn is called <i>'Dona Firinne,' </i>Donn
   of Truth. "- Mr. Edward O'Reilly]</p>

 <b>IT</b> is a very good thing not to be any way in dread of
   the fairies, for without doubt they have then less power over a person ; but
   to make too free with them, or to disbelieve in them altogether, is as foolish
   a thing as man, woman, or child can do.</p>
 
   <p>
 It has been truly said, that "good manners are no
   burthen," and that " civility costs nothing;" but there are
   some people foolhardy enough to disregard doing a civil thing, which, whatever
   they may think, can never harm themselves or any one else, and who at the same
   time will go out of their way for a bit of mischief, which never can serve
   them; but sooner or later they will come to know better, as you shall hear of
   Carroll O'Daly, a strapping young fellow up out of Connaught, whom they used
   to call, in his own country, " Devil Daly."</p>
 
   <p>
 Carroll O'Daly used to go roving about from one place to
   another, and the fear of nothing stopped him; he would as soon pass an
   churchyard or a regular fairy ground, at any hour of the night, as go from one
   room into another without ever making the sign of the cross, or saying, "
   Good luck attend you, gentlemen."</p>
 
   <p>
 It so happened that he was once journeying, in the county of
   Limerick, towards " the Balbec of Ireland," the venerable town of
   Kilmallock; and just at the foot of Knockfierna he overtook a
   respectable4ooking man jogging along upon a white pony. The night wag coming
   on, and they rode side by side for some time, without much conversation
   passing between them, further than saluting each other very kindly; at last,
   Carroll O'Daly asked his companion how far he was going?</p>
 
   <p>
 Not far your way," said the farmer, for such his
   appearance bespoke him; " I'm only going to the top of this hill
   here."</p>
 
   <p>
 "And what might take you there," said O'Daly,
   "at this time of the night?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Why then," replied the farmer," if you want to
   know; 'tis the <i>good people</i>."</p>
 
   <p>
 The fairies, you mean," said O'Daly.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 " Whist
 I whist!" said his fellow-traveller, " or you may be sorry for
 it;" and he turned his pony off the road they were going towards a little
 path which led up the side of the mountain, wishing Carrol O'Daly good night and
 a safe journey.</p>
 
 <p>
 That fellow," thought Carroll, " is about no good this
 blessed night, and I would have no fear of swearing wrong if I took my Bible
 oath, that it is something else beside the fairies, or the good people, as he
 calls them, that is taking him up the mountain at this hour. The fairies!"
 he repeated, " is it for a well shaped man like him to be going after
 little chaps like the fairies! to be sure some say there are such things, and
 more say not; but I know this, that never afraid would I be of a dozen of them,
 ay, of two dozen, for that matter, if they are no bigger than what I hear tell
 of."</p>
 
 <p>
 Carroll O'Daly, whilst these thoughts were passing in his mind,
 had fixed his eyes steadfastly on the mountain, behind which the full moon was
 rising majestically. Upon an elevated point that appeared darkly against the
 moon's disk, he beheld the figure of a man leading a pony, and he had no doubt
 it was that of the farmer with whom he had just parted company.</p>
 
 <p>
 A sudden resolve to follow flashed across the mind of O'Daly
 with the speed of lightning: both his courage and curiosity had been worked up
 by his cogitations to a pitch of chivalry; and, muttering "Here's after
 you, old boy!" he dismounted from his horse, bound him to an old thorn
 tree, and then commenced vigorously ascending the mountain.</p>
 
 <p>
 Following as well as he could the direction taken by the figures
 of the man and pony, he pursued his way, occasionally guided by their partial
 appearance: and, after toiling nearly three hours over a rugged and sometimes
 swampy path, came to a green spot on the top of the mountain, where he saw<i> </i>the
 white pony at full liberty grazing as quietly as may be. O'Daly looked around
 for the rider, but he was nowhere to be seen; he, however, soon discovered close
 to where the pony stood an opening in the mountain like the mouth of a pit, and
 he remembered having heard, when a child, many a tale about the
 "Poul-duve," or Black Hole of Knockfierna; how it was the entrance to
 tbe fairy castle which was within the mountain; and how a man whose name was
 Ahern, a land-surveyor in that part of the country, had once attempted to fathom
 it with a line, and had been drawn down into it and was never again heard <i>of;
 </i>with many other tales of the like nature.</p>
 
 <p>
 "But," thought O'Daly, "these are old woman's
 stories; and since I've come up so far<i>, </i>I'll just knock at the castle
 door and see if the fairies are at home."</p>
 
 <p>
 No sooner said than done; for, seizing a large stone, as big,
 ay, bigger than his two hands, he flung it with all his strength down into the
 Poul-duve of Knockfierna. He heard it bounding and tumbling about from one rock
 to another with a terrible noise, and he leant his head over to try and hear
 when it would reach the bottom, - and what should the very stone he had thrown
 in do but come up again with as much force as it had gone down, and gave him
 such a blow full in the face, that it sent him rolling down the side of
 Knockfierna, head over heels, tumbling from one crag to another, much faster
 than he came up. And in the morning Carroll O'Daly was found lying beside his
 horse; the bridge of his nose broken, which disfigured him for life ; his head
 all cut and bruised, and both his eyes closed up, and as black as if Sir Daniel
 Donnelly had painted them for him.</p>
 
 <p>
 Carroll O'Daly was never bold again in riding alone near the
 haunts of the fairies after dusk; but small blame to him for that; and if ever
 he happened to be benighted in a lonesome place, he would make the best of his
 way to his journey's end, without asking questions, or turning to the right or
 to the left, to seek after the good people, or any who kept company with them.</p>
