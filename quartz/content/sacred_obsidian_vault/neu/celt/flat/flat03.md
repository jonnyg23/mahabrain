 <center><h1>The Legend of Knockgrafton</h1></center>
 <p>
 THERE was once a poor man who lived
 in the fertile glen of Aherlow, at the foot of the gloomy Galtee mountains, and
 he had a great hump on his back: he looked just as if his body had been rolled
 up and placed upon his shoulders; and his head was pressed down with the weight
 so much, that his chin, when he. was sitting, used to rest<i> </i>upon his knees
 for support. The country people were rather shy of meeting him in any lonesome
 place, for though, poor creature, he was as harmless and as inoffensive as a
 new-born infant, yet his deformity was so great, that he scarcely appeared to be
 a human being, and some ill-minded persons had set strange stories about him
 afloat. He was said to have a great knowledge of herbs and charms; but certain
 it was that he had a mighty skillful hand in plaiting straw and rushes into bats
 and baskets., which was the way he made his livelihood.</p>
 
 <p>
 Lusmore, for that was the nickname
 put upon him by reason of his always wearing a sprig of the fairy cap, or
 lusmore [literally, the great herb - <i>Digitalis purpurea</i>] in his little
 straw hat, would ever get a higher penny for his plaited work than any one else,
 and perhaps that was the reason why some one, out of envy, had circulated the
 strange stories about him. Be that as it may, it happened that he was returning
 one evening from the pretty town of Cahir towards Cappagh, and as little Lusmore
 walked very slowly, on account of the great hump upon his back, it was quite
 dark when he came to the old moat of Knockgrafton, which stood on the right hand
 side <i>of </i>his road. Tired and weary was he, and noways comfortable in his
 own mind at thinking how much farther he had to travel, and that he should be
 walking all the night; so he sat down under the moat to rest himself, and began
 looking mournfully enough upon the moon, which,</p>
 
 
     <i>
     </i><p>
 "Rising in clouded majesty, at length,<br>
 
     Apparent Queen, unveil'd her peerless light,<br>
 
     And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw."</p>
 
     
 <p>
 Presently there rose a wild strain of unearthly
 melody upon the ear of little Lusmore; he listened, and he thought that he had
 never heard such ravishing music before. It was like the sound of many voices,
 each mingling and blending with the other so strangely, that they seemed to be
 one, though all singing different strains, and the words of the song were these:
 -</p>
 
 <i>
 </i><p>
 Da Luan, Da Mort, <i>Da
 Luan, Da </i>Mort, Da <i>Luan, Da </i>Mort,</p>
 
 <p>
 when there would be a moment's pause, and then
 the round of melody went on again.</p>
 
 <p>
 Lusmore listened attentively, scarcely drawing
 his breath, lest he might lose the slightest note. He now plainly perceived that
 the singing was within the moat, and, though at first it had charmed him so
 much, he began to get tired of hearing the same round sung over and over so
 often without any change; so availing himself of the pause when the <i>Da Luan,
 Da </i>More, had been sung three times, he took up the tune and raised it with
 the words <i>augus Da Gadine, </i>and then went on singing with the voices
 inside of the moat, <i>Da Luan, Da Mort, </i>finishing the melody, when he pause
 again came, with <i>a'ugus Da Cadine. [</i>correctlyy written, <i>Dia</i> <i>Luain,
 Dia Mairt, agus Dia Ceadaoine, </i>i. e. Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.]</p>
 
   <p>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The <i>fairies </i>within Knockgrafton, for the
 song was a fairy melody, when they heard this addition to their tune, were so
 much delighted, that with instant resolve it was determined to bring the mortal
 among them, whose musical skill so far exceeded theirs, and little Lusmore was
 conveyed into their company with the eddying speed of a whirlwind.</p>
 
 <p>
 Glorious to behold was the sight that burst upon
 him as he came down through the moat, twirling round and round and round with
 the lightness of a straw, to the sweetest music that kept time to his moti6n.
 The greatest honour was then paid him, for he was put up above all the
 musicians, and he had servants 'tending upon him, and every thing to his heart's
 content, and a hearty welcome to all; and in short he was made as much of as if
 he had been the first man in the land.</p>
 
 <p>
 Presently Lusmore saw a great consultation going
 forward among the fairies, and, notwithstanding all their civility, he felt very
 much frightened, until one, stepping out from the rest, came up to him, and
 said, -</p>
 
   <p>
 <i>"Lusmore! Lusmore!<br>
 
   Doubt not, nor deplore,<br>
 
   For the hump which you bore<br>
 
   On your back is no more! -<br>
 
   Look down on the floor,<br>
 
   And view it, Lusmore! "</i></p>
 
 <p>
 When these words were said, poor little Lusmore
 felt himself so light, and so happy, that he thought he could have have bounded
 at one jump over the moon, like the cow in the history of the cat and the
 fiddle; and he saw, with inexpressible pleasure, his hump tumble down upon the
 ground from his shoulders. He then tried to lift up his head, and he did so with
 becoming caution, fearing that he might knock it against the ceiling of the
 grand hall, where he was; he looked round and round again with the greatest
 wonder and delight upon every thing, which appeared more and more beautiful;
 and, overpowered at beholding such a resplendent scene, his head grew dizzy, and
 his eyesight became dim. At last he fell into a sound sleep, and when he awoke,
 he found that it was broad daylight, the sun shining brightly, the birds singing
 sweet; and that he was lying just at the foot of the moat of Knockgrafton; with
 the cows and sheep grazing peaceably round about him. The first thing Lusmore
 did, after saying his prayers, was to put his band behind to feel for his hump,
 but no sign of one was there on his back, and he looked at himself with great
 pride, for he had now become a well-shaped dapper little fellow; and more than
 that, he found himself in a full suit of new clothes, which he concluded the
 fairies had made for him.</p>
 
 <p>
 Towards Cappagh he went, stepping out as lightly,
 and springing up at every step as if he had been all his life a dancing-master.
 Not a creature who met Lusmore knew him without his hump, and he had great work
 to persuade every one that he was the same man - in truth he was not, so far as
 outward appearance went.</p>
 
 <p>
 Of course it was not long before the story of
 Lusmore's hump got about, and a great wonder was made of it. Through the
 country, for miles round, it was the talk of every one, high and low<i>.</i></p>
 
 
 <p>
 One morning as Lusmore was sitting contented
 enough at his cabin-door, up came an old woman to him, and asked if he could
 direct her to Cappagh?</p>
 
 <p>
 "I need give you no directions, my good
 woman, said Lusmore, " for this is Cappagh; and who do you want here?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "I have come, said the woman, "out of
 Decie's country, in the county of Waterford, looking after one Lusmore, who, I
 have heard tell, had his hump taken off by the fairies: for there is a son of a
 gossip of mine has got a hump on him that will be his death; and may be, if he
 could use the same charm as Lusmore, the hump may be taken off him. And now I
 have told you the reason of my coming so far: 't is to find out about this
 charm, if I can."</p>
 
 <p>
 Lusmore, who was ever a good-natured little
 fellow, told the woman all the particulars, how he had raised the tune for the
 fairies at Knockgrafton, how his hump had been removed from his shoulder., and
 how he had got a new suit of clothes into the bargain.</p>
 
 <p>
 The woman thanked him very much, and then went
 away quite happy and easy in her own mind. When she came back to her gossip's
 house, in the county Waterford, she told her every thing that Lusmore had said,
 and they put the little hump-backed man, who was a peevish and cunning creature
 from his birth, upon a car, and took him all the way across the country. It was
 a long journey, but they did not care for that, so the hump was taken from off
 him; and they brought him, just at nightfall, and left him under the old moat of
 Knockgrafton.</p>
 
 <p>
 Jack Madden, for that was the humpy man's name,
 had not been sitting there long when he heard the tune going on within the moat
 much sweeter than before; for the fairies were singing it the way Lusmore had
 settled their music for them, and the song was going on: <i>Da Luan, Da </i>Mort,
 <i>Da Luan, Da Mort, Da Luan, Da Mort, augus Da Cadine, </i>without ever
 stopping. Jack Madden, who was in a great hurry to get quit of his hump, never
 thought of waiting until the fairies had done, or watching for a fit opportunity
 to raise the tune higher again than Lusmore had: so having heard them sing it
 over seven times without stopping, out he bawls, never minding the time, or the
 humour of the tune, or how he could bring his words in properly, <i>augus Da
 Cadine, augus Da Hena </i>[And Wednesday and Thursday], thinking that if one day
 was good, two were better; and that, if Lusmore had one new suit of clothes
 given to him, he should have two.</p>
 
 <p>
 No sooner had the words passed his lips than he
 was taken up and whisked into the moat with prodigious force; and the fairies
 came crowding round about him with great anger, screeching and screaming, and
 roaring out, ." who spoiled our tune? who spoiled our tune ? " and one
 stepped up to him above all the rest, and said -</p>
 
     <i>
     </i><p>
 "Jack Madden! Jack Madden!<br>
 
     Your words came so bad in<br>
 
     The tune we feel glad in; -<br>
 
     This castle you're bad in,<br>
 
     That your life we may sadden :<br>
 
     Here's two bumps for Jack Madden!"</p>
 
     
 <p>
 And twenty of the strongest fairies brought
 Lusmore's hump. and put it down upon poor Jack's back, over his own, where it
 became fixed as firmly as if it was nailed on with twelvepenny nails, by the
 best carpenter that ever drove one. Out of their castle they then kicked him,
 and in the morning when Jack Madden's mother and her gossip came to look after
 their little man, they found him half dead, lying at the foot of the moat, with
 the other hump upon his back. Well to be sure, how they did look at each other!
 but they were afraid to say any thing, lest a hump might be put upon their own
 shoulders: home they brought the unlucky Jack Madden with them, as downcast in
 their hearts and their looks as ever two gossips were; and what through the
 weight of his other bump, and the long journey, he died soon after, leaving,
 they say, his heavy curse to any one who would go to listen to fairy tunes
 again.</p>
