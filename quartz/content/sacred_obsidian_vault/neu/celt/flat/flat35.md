 <center><h1>The Headless Horseman</h1></center>
   <p>
 "GOD speed you, and a safe journey
   this night to you, Charley," ejaculated the master of the little sheebeen
   house at Ballyhooley after his old friend and good customer, Charley Culnane,
   who at length had turned his face homewards, with the prospect of as dreary a
   ride and as dark a night as ever fell upon the Blackwater, along the banks of
   which he was about to journey.</p>
 
   <p>
 Charley Culnane knew the country well, and
   moreover, was as bold a rider as any Mallow-boy that ever <i>rattled </i>a
   four-year-old upon Drumrue race-course. He had gone to Fermoy in the morning,
   as well for the purpose of purchasing some ingredients required for the
   Christmas dinner by his wife, as to gratify his own vanity by having new reins
   fitted to his snaffle, in which he intended showing off the old mare at the
   approaching St. Stephen's day hunt.</p>
 
   <p>
 Charley did not get out of Fermoy until
   late; for although he was not one of your "nasty particular sort of
   fellows" in any thing that related to the common occurrences of life, yet
   in all the appointments connected with hunting, riding, leaping, in short, in
   whatever was connected with the old mare, "Charley," the saddlers
   said, "was the devil to <i>plase." </i>An illustration of this
   fastidiousness was<i> </i>afforded by his going such a distance for a snaffle
   bridle. Mallow was full twelve miles nearer "Charley's farm" (which
   lay just three quarters of a mile below Carrick) than Fermoy; but Charley had
   quarrelled with all the Mallow saddlers, from hard-working and hard- drinking
   Tim Clancey, up to Mr. Ryan, who wrote himself "Saddler to the Duhallow
   Hunt;" and no one could content him in all particulars but honest Michael
   Twomey of Fermoy, who used to assert - and who will doubt it - that he could
   stitch a saddle better than the lord-lieutenant although they made him all as
   one as king over Ireland.</p>
 
   <p>
 This delay in the arrangement of the
   snaffle bridle did not allow Charley Culnane to pay so long a visit as he had
   at first intended to his old friend and gossip, Con Buckley, of the "Harp
   of Erin." Con, however, knew the value of time, and insisted upon Charley
   making good use of what he had to spare. "I won't bother you waiting for
   water, Charley, because I think you'll have enough of that same before you get
   home; so drink off your liquor, man. It 's as good <i>parliament </i>as ever a
   gentleman tasted, ay, and holy church too, for it will bear <i>'x waters,' </i>and
   carry the bead after that, may be."</p>
 
   <p>
 Charley, it must be confessed, nothing
   loth, drank success to Con, and success to the jolly "Harp of Erin,"
   with its head of beauty and its strings of the hair of gold, and to their
   better acquaintance, and so on, from the bottom of his soul, until the bottom
   of the bottle reminded him that Carrick was at the bottom of the hill on the
   other side of Castletown Roche, and that he had got no further on his journey
   than his gossip's at Ballyclose to the big gate of Convamore. Catching bold of
   his oil-skin hat, therefore, whilst Con Buckley went to the cupboard for
   another bottle of the "real stuff," he regularly, as it is termed,
   bolted from his friend's hospitality, darted to the stable, tightened his
   girths, and put the old mare into a canter towards home.</p>
 
   <p>
 The road from Ballyhooley to Carrick
   follows pretty nearly the course of the Blackwater, occasionally diverging
   from the river and passing through rather wild scenery, when contrasted with
   the beautiful seats that adorn its banks. Charley cantered gaily, regardless
   of the rain, which, as his friend Con had anticipated, fell in torrents: the
   good woman's currants and raisins were carefully packed between the folds of
   his yeomanry cloak, which Charley, who was proud of showing that he belonged
   to the "Royal Mallow Light Horse Volunteers," always strapped to the
   saddle before him, and took care never to destroy the military effect of by
   putting it on. - Away he went singing like a thrush-</p>
 
   <p>
 "Sporting, belleing, dancing,
   drinking,<br>
 
   Breaking windows - <i>(hiccup I) </i>- sinking,<br>
 
   Ever raking - never thinking,<br>
 
   Live the rakes of Mallow.</p>
 
   <p>
 Spending faster than it comes,<br>
 
   Beating - <i>(hiccup, hic), </i>and duns,<br>
 
   Duhallow's true-begotten sons,<br>
 
   Live the rakes of Mallow."</p>
 
   <p>
 Notwithstanding that the visit to the jolly
   "Harp of Erin" had a little increased the natural complacency of his
   mind, the drenching of the new snaffle reins began to disturb him; and then
   followed a train of more anxious thoughts than even were occasioned by the
   dreaded defeat of the pride of his long-anticipated <i>turn</i> <i>out </i>on
   St. Stephen's day. In an hour of good fellowship, when his heart was<i> </i>warm,
   and his head not over cool, Charley had backed the old mare against Mr.
   Jephson's bay filly Desdemona for a neat hundred, and he now felt sore
   misgivings as to the prudence of the match. In a less gay tone he continued</p>
 
   <p>
 "Living short, but merry lives,<br>
 
   Going where the devil drives,<br>
 
   Keeping - "</p>
 
   <p>
 "Keeping" be muttered, as the old
   mare had reduced her canter to a trot at the bottom of Kilcummer Hill.
   Charley's eye fell on the old walls that belonged, in former times, to the
   Templars : but the silent gloom of the ruin was broken only by the heavy rain
   which splashed and pattered on the gravestones. He then looked up at the sky,
   to see if there was, among the clouds, any hopes for mercy on his new snaffle
   reins; and no sooner were his eyes lowered, than his attention was arrested by
   an object so extraordinary as almost led him to doubt the evidence of his
   senses. The head, apparently, of a white horse, with short cropped ears, large
   open nostrils and immense eyes, seemed rapidly to follow him. No connection
   with body, legs, or rider, could possibly be traced the head advanced -
   Charley's old mare, too, was moved at this unnatural sight, and snorting
   violently, increased her trot up the hill. The head moved forward, and passed
   on: Charley pursuing it with astonished gaze, and wondering by what means, and
   for what purpose, this detached head thus proceeded through the air, did not
   perceive the corresponding body until he was suddenly started by finding it
   close at his side. Charley turned to examine what was thus so sociably jogging
   on with him, when a most unexampled apparition presented itself to his view. A
   figure, whose height (judging as well as the obscurity of the night would
   permit him) he computed to be at least eight feet, was seated on the body and
   legs of a white horse full eighteen hands and a half high. In this measurement
   Charley could not be mistaken, for his own mare was exactly fifteen hands, and
   the body that thus jogged alongside he could at once determine, from his
   practice in horseflesh, was at least three hands and a half higher.</p>
 
   <p>
 After the first feeling of astonishment,
   which found vent in the exclamation " I'm sold now for ever!" was
   over; the attention of Charley, being a keen sportsman, was naturally directed
   to this extraordinary body, and having examined it with the eye of a
   connoisseur, he proceeded to reconnoitre the figure so unusually mounted, who
   had hitherto remained perfectly mute. Wishing to see whether his companion's
   silence proceeded from bad temper, want of conversational powers, or from a
   distaste to water, and the fear that the opening of his mouth might subject
   him to have it filled by the rain, which was then drifting in violent gusts
   against them, Charley endeavoured to catch a sight of his companion's face in
   order to form an opinion on that point. But his vision failed in carrying him
   further than the top of the collar of the figure's coat, which was a scarlet
   single-breasted hunting frock, having a waist of a very old fashioned cut
   reaching to the saddle with two. huge shining buttons at about a yard distance
   behind. " I ought to see further than this, too," thought Charley,
   " although he is mounted on his high horse, like my cousin Darby, who was
   made barony constable last week, unless 'tis Con's whiskey that has blinded me
   entirely." However, see further he could not, and after straining his
   eyes for a considerable time to no purpose, he exclaimed, with pure vexation,
   " By the big bridge of Mallow, it is no head at all he has !"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Look again, Charley Culnane,"
   said a hoarse voice, that seemed to proceed from under the right arm of the
   figure.</p>
 
   <p>
 Charley did look again, and now in the
   proper place, for he clearly saw, under the aforesaid right arm, that head
   from which the voice had proceeded, and such a head no mortal ever saw before.
   It looked like a large cream cheese hung round with black puddings: no speck
   of colour enlivened the ashy paleness of the depressed features; the skin lay
   stretched over the unearthly surface, almost like the parchment head of a
   drum. Two fiery eyes of prodigious circumference, with a strange and irregular
   motion, flashed like meteors upon Charley, and to complete all, a mouth
   reached from either extremity of two ears, which peeped forth from under a
   profusion of matted locks of lustreless blackness. This head, which the figure
   had evidently hitherto concealed from Charley's eyes, now burst upon his view
   in all its hideousness. Charley, although a lad of proverbial courage in the
   county of Cork, yet could not but feel his nerves a little shaken by this
   unexpected visit from the headless horseman, whom he considered his fellow
   traveller must be. The cropped-eared head of the gigantic horse moved steadily
   forward, always keeping from six to eight yards in advance. The horseman,
   unaided by whip or spur, and disdaining the use of stirrups, which dangled
   uselessly from the saddle, followed at a trot by Charley's side, his hideous
   head now lost behind the lappet of his coat, now starting forth in all its
   horror as the motion of the horse caused his arm to move to and fro. The
   ground shook under the weight of its supernatural burthen, and the water in
   the pools became agitated into waves as he trotted by them.</p>
 
   <p>
 On they went - heads without bodies, and
   bodies without heads. - The deadly silence of night was broken only by the
   fearful clattering of hoofs, and the distant sound of thunder, which rumbled
   above the mystic hill of Cecaune a Mona Finnea. Charley, who was naturally a
   merry-hearted, and rather a talkative fellow, had hitherto felt tongue tied by
   apprehension, but finding his companion showed no evil disposition towards
   him, and having become somewhat more reconciled to the Patagonian dimensions
   of the horseman and his headless steed, plucked up all his courage, and thus
   addressed the stranger : -</p>
 
   <p>
 "Why, then, your honour rides mighty
   well without the stirrups !"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Humph," growled the head from
   under the horseman's right arm.</p>
 
   <p>
 " 'Tis not an over civil answer,"
   thought Charley ; "but no matter, he was taught in one of them
   riding-houses, may be, and thinks nothing at all about bumping his leather
   breeches at the rate of ten miles an hour. I 'II try him on the other tack.
   Ahem I" said Charley, clearing his throat, and feeling at the same time
   rather daunted at this second attempt to establish a conversation.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ahem ! that's a mighty neat coat of
   your honour's, although 't is a little too long in the waist for the present
   cut."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Humph," growled again the head.</p>
 
   <p>
 This second humph was a terrible thump in
   the face to poor Charley, who was fairly bothered to know what subject he
   could start that would prove more agreeable. " 'Tis a sensible
   head," thought Charley, "although an ugly one, for 'tis plain enough
   the man does not like flattery." A third attempt, however, Charley was
   determined to make, and having failed in his observations as to the riding and
   coat of his fellow-traveller, thought he would just drop a trifling allusion
   to the wonderful headless horse, that was jogging on so sociably beside his
   old mare; and as Charley was considered about Carrick to be very knowing in
   horses, besides being a full private in the Royal Mallow Light Horse
   Volunteers, which were every one of them mounted like real Hessians, he felt
   rather sanguine as to the result of his third attempt.</p>
 
   <p>
 "To be sure, that's a brave horse your
   honour rides," recommenced the persevering Charley.</p>
 
   <p>
 "You may say<i> </i>that, with your
   own ugly mouth," growled the head.</p>
 
   <p>
 Charley, though not much flattered by the
   compliment, nevertheless chuckled at his success in obtaining an answer, and
   thus continued : -</p>
 
   <p>
 "May be your honour wouldn't be after
   riding him across the country?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Will you try me, Charley ? "
   said the head, with an iriexpressible look of ghastly delight.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Faith, and that's what I'd do,"
   responded Charley, "only I 'm afraid, the night being so dark, of laming
   the old mare, and I've every halfpenny of a hundred pounds on her heels."</p>
 
   <p>
 This was true enough; Charley's courage was
   nothing dashed at the headless horseman's proposal; and there never was a
   steeple-chase, nor a fox-chase, riding or leaping in the country, that Charley
   Culnane was not at it, and foremost in it.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Will you take my word," said the
   man who carried his head so snugly under his right arm, for the safety of your
   mare?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Done," said Charley; and away
   they started, helter, skelter, over every thing, ditch and wall, pop, pop, the
   old mare never went in such style, even in broad daylight: and Charley had
   just the start of his companion, when the hoarse voice called out "
   Charley Culnane, Charley, man, stop for your life, stop !"</p>
 
   <p>
 Charley pulled up hard. " Ay,"
   said he, "you may beat me by the head, because it always goes so much
   before you; but if the bet was neck-and-neck, and that's the go between the
   old mare and Desdemona, I'd win it hollow!"</p>
 
   <p>
 It appeared as if the stranger was well
   aware of what was passing in Charley's mind, for he suddenly broke out quite
   loquacious.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Charley Culnane," says he,
   "you have a stout soul in you, and are every inch of you a good rider.
   I've tried you, and I ought to know; and that's the sort of man for my money.
   A hundred years it is since my horse and I broke our necks at the bottom of
   Kilcummer hill, and ever since I have been trying to get a man that dared to
   ride with me and never found one before. Keep, as you have always done, at the
   tail of the hounds, never baulk a ditch, nor turn away from a stone wall, and
   the headless horseman will never desert you nor the old mare."</p>
 
   <p>
 Charley, in amazement, looked towards the
   stranger's right arm, for the purpose of seeing in his face whether or not he
   was in earnest, but behold ! the head was snugly lodged in the huge pocket of
   the horseman's scarlet hunting-coat. The horse's head had ascended
   perpendicularly above them, and his extraordinary companion, rising quickly
   after his avant courier, vanished from the astonished gaze of Charley Culnane.</p>
 
   <p>
 Charley, as may be supposed, was lost in
   wonder, delight, and perplexity; the pelting rain, the wife's pudding, the new
   snaffle - even the match against squire Jephson - all were forgotten; nothing
   could he think of; nothing could he talk of; but the headless horseman. He
   told it, directly that he got home, to Judy; he told it the following morning
   to all the neighbours; and he told it to the hunt on St. Stephen's day: but
   what provoked him after all the pains he took in describing the head, the
   horse, and the man, was that one and all attributed the creation of the
   headless horseman to his friend Con Buckley's "X water parliament."
   This, however, should be told, that Charley's old mare beat Mr. Jephson's bay
   filly, Desdemona, by Diamond, and Charley pocketed his cool hundred; and if he
   didn't win by means of the headless horseman, I am sure I don't know any other
   reason for his doing so.</p>
