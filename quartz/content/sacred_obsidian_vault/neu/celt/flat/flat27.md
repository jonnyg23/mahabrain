 <center><h1>The Legend of O'Donoghue</h1></center>
   <p>
 IN an age so distant that the precise period is unknown, a
   chieftain named O'Donoghue ruled over the country which surrounds. the
   romantic Lough Lean, now called the lake of Killnarney. Wisdom, beneficence,
   and justice distinguished his reign, and the prosperity and happiness of his
   subjects were their natural results. He is said to have been as renowned for
   his warlike exploits as for his pacific virtues ; and as a proof that his
   domestic administration was not the less rigorous because it was mild, a rocky
   island is pointed out to strangers, called " O'Donoghue's Prison,"
   in which this prince once confined his own son for some act of disorder and
   disobedience.</p>
 
   <p>
 His end - for it cannot correctly be called his death - was
   singular and mysterious. At one of those splendid feasts for which his court
   was celebrated, surrounded by the most distinguished of his subjects, he was
   engaged in - a prophetic relation of the events which were to happen in ages
   yet to come. His auditors listened, now wrapt in wonder, now fired with
   indignation, burning with shame, or melted into sorrow, as he faithfully
   detailed the heroism, the injuries, the crimes, and the miseries of their
   descendants. In the midst of his predictions he rose slowly from his seat,
   advanced with a solemn, measured, and majestic tread to the shore of the lake,
   and walked forward composedly upon its unyielding surface. When he had nearly
   reached the centre, he paused for a moment, then turning slowly round, looked
   towards his friends, and waving his arms to them with the cheerful air of one
   taking a short farewell, disappeared from their view.</p>
 
   <p>
 The memory of the good O'Donogbue has been. cherished by
   successive generations with affectionate reverence: and it is believed that at
   sunrise, on every May-day morning, the anniversary of his departure, he
   revisits his ancient domains: a favoured few only are in general permitted to
   see him, and this distinction is always an omen of good fortune to the
   beholders: when it is granted to many, it is a sure token of an abundant
   harvest, - a blessing, the want of which during this prince's reign was never
   felt by his people.</p>
 
   <p>
 Some years have elapsed since the last appearance of
   O'Donoghue. The April of that year had been remarkably wild and stormy; but on
   May-morning the fury of the elements had altogether subsided. The air was
   hushed and still; and the sky, which was reflected in the serene lake,
   resembled a beautiful but deceitful countenance, whose smiles, after the most
   tempestuous emotions, tempt the stranger to believe that it belongs to a soul
   which no passion has ever ruffled.</p>
 
   <p>
 The first beams of the rising sun were just gilding the lofty
   summit of Glenaa, when the waters near the eastern shores of the lake became
   suddenly and violently agitated, though all the rest of its surface lay smooth
   and still as a tomb of polished marble; the next moment a foaming wave darted
   forward, and, like a proud high-crested war-horse, exulting in his strength,
   rushed across the lake towards Toomies mountain. Behind this wave appeared a
   stately warrior fully armed, mounted upon a milk-white steed; his snowy plume
   waved gracefully from a helmet of polished steel, and at his back fluttered a
   light blue scarf. The horse, apparently exulting in his noble burden, sprang
   after the wave along the water, which bore him up like firm earth, while
   showers of spray that glittered brightly in the morning sun were dashed up at
   every bound.</p>
 
   <p>
 The warrior was O'Donoghue; he was followed by numberless
   youths and maidens, who moved lightly and unconstrained over the watery plain,
   as the moonlight fairies glide through the fields of air; they were linked
   together by garlands of delicious spring flowers, and they timed their
   movements to strains of enchanting melody. When O'Donoghue had nearly reached
   the western side of the lake, he suddenly turned his steed, and directed his
   course along the wood-fringed shore of Glenaa, preceded by the huge wave that
   curled and foamed up as high as the horse's neck, whose fiery nostrils snorted
   above it. The bug train of attendants followed with playful deviations the
   track of their leader, and moved on with unabated fleetness to their celestial
   music, till gradually, as they entered the narrow strait between Glenaa and
   Dinis, they became involved in the mists which still partially floated over
   the lakes, and faded from the view of the wondering behoIders: but the sound
   of their music still fell<i> </i>upon the ear, and echo, catching up the
   harmonious strains, fondly repeated and prolonged them in soft and softer
   tones, till the last faint repetition died away, and the hearers awoke as from
   a dream of bliss.</p>

 Thierna na Oge, or the country of Youth, is the name given
   to the foregoing section, from the belief that those who dwell in regions of
   enchantment beneath the water are not affected by the movements of time.</p>
