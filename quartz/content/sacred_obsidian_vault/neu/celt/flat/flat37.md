 <center><h1>Teigue of the Lee</h1></center>
   <p>
 "I CAN'T stop in the house - I won't
   stop in it for all the money that is buried in the old. castle of Carrigrohan.
   if ever there was such a thing in the world ! -. to be abused to my face night
   and day, and nobody to the fore doing it ! and then, if I'm angry, to be
   laughed at with a great roaring ho, ho, ho ! I won't stay in the house after,
   to-night, if there was not another place in the country to put my head
   under." This angry soliloquy was pronounced in the hall of the old
   manor-house of Carrigrohan by John Sheehan. John was a new servant; be had
   been only three days in the house, which had the character of being haunted,
   and in that short space of time be had been abused and laughed at, by a voice
   which sounded as if a man spoke with his head in a cask; nor could he discover
   who was the speaker, or from whence the voice came. "I'll not stop
   here," said John; "and that ends the matter."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ho, ho, ho ! be quiet, John Sheehan,
   or else worse will happen to you."</p>
 
   <p>
 John instantly ran to the hall window, as
   the words were evidently spoken by a person immediately outside, but no one
   was visible. He had scarcely placed his face at the pane of glass, when he
   heard another loud "Ho, ho, ho !" as if behind him in the hall; as
   quick as lightning he turned his head, but no living thing was to be seen.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ho, ho, ho, John !" shouted a
   voice that appeared to come from the lawn before the house; do you think
   you'll see Teigue? - oh, never ! as long as you live ! so leave alone looking
   after him, and mind your business; there's plenty of company to dinner from
   Cork to be here to-day, and 'tis time you had the cloth laid."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Lord bless us ! there's more of it !
   - I'll never stay another day here," repeated John.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Hold your tongue, and stay where you
   are quietly, and play no tricks on Mr. Pratt, as you did on Mr. Jervois about
   the spoons."</p>
 
   <p>
 John Sheehan was confounded by this address
   from his invisible persecutor, but nevertheless he mustered courage enough to
   say -" Who are you? - come here, and let me see you, if you are a
   man;" but he received in reply only a laugh of unearthly derision, which
   was followed by a " Good-by - I'll watch you at dinner, John!"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Lord between us and harm ! this beats
   all ! - I'll watch you at dinner ! - maybe you will; - 'tis the broad
   daylight, so 'tis no ghost; but this is a terrible place, and this is the last
   day I'll stay in it. How does he know about the spoons? - if he tells it, I'm
   a ruined man ! - there was no living soul could tell it to him but Tim
   Barrett, and he's far enough off in the wilds of Botany Bay now, so how could
   he know it - I can't tell for the world ! But what's that I see there at the
   corner of the wall ! - 'tis not a man! - oh, what a fool I am ! 't is only the
   old stump of a tree! - But this is a shocking place - I'll never stop in it,
   for I'll leave the house tomorrow; the very look of it is enough to frighten
   any one."</p>
 
   <p>
 The mansion had~ certainly an air of
   desolation; it was situated in a lawn, which had nothing to break its uniform
   level, save a few tufts of narcissuses and a couple of old trees coeval with
   the building. The house stood at a short distance from the road, it was
   upwards of a century old, and Time was doing his work upon it; its walls were
   weather-stained in all colours, its roof showed various white patches, it had
   no look of comfort; all was dim and dingy without, and within there was an air
   of gloom; of departed and departing greatness, which harmonised well with the
   exterior. It required all the exuberance of youth and of gaiety to remove the
   impression, almost amounting to awe, with which you trod the huge square hail,
   paced along the gallery which surrounded the hall, or explored the long
   rambling passages below stairs,. The ball-room, as the large drawing-room was
   called, and several other apartments, were in a state of decay: the walls were
   stained with damp; and I remember well the sensation of awe which I felt
   creeping over me when, boy as I was, and full of boyish life, and wild and
   ardent spirits, I descended to the vaults; all without and within me became
   chilled beneath their dampness and gloom - their extent, too, terrified me;
   nor could the merriment of my two schoolfellows, whose father; a respectable
   clergyman, rented the dwelling for a time, dispel the feelings of a romantic
   imagination until I once again ascended to the upper regions.</p>
 
   <p>
 John had pretty well recovered himself as
   the dinner-hour approached, and the several guests arrived. They were all
   seated at table, and had begun to enjoy the excellent repast, when a voice was
   heard from the lawn : -</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ho, ho, ho, Mr. Pratt, won't you give
   poor Teigue some dinner ? ho, ho, a fine company you have there, and plenty of
   every thing that's good; sure you won't forget poor Teigue?"</p>
 
   <p>
 John dropped the glass he had in his hand.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Who is that?" said Mr. Pratt's
   brother, an officer of the artillery.</p>
 
   <p>
 "That is Teigue," said Mr. Pratt,
   laughing, whom you must often have heard me mention."</p>
 
   <p>
 "And pray, Mr. Pratt," enquired
   another gentleman, " who <i>is </i>Teigue.?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "That," he replied, "is more
   than I can tell. No one has ever been able to catch even a glimpse of him. I
   have been on the watch for a whole evening with three of my sons, yet,
   although his voice sometimes sounded almost in my ear, I could not see him. I
   fancied, indeed, that I saw a man in a white frieze jacket pass into the door
   from the garden to the lawn, but it could be only fancy, for I found the door
   locked, while the fellow, whoever he is, was laughing at our trouble. He
   visits us occasionally, and sometimes a long interval passes between his
   visits, as in the present case; it is now nearly two years since we heard that
   hollow voice outside the window. He has never done any injury that we know of;
   and once when he broke a plate, he brought one back exactly like it."</p>
 
   <p>
 "It is very extraordinary," said
   several of the company.</p>
 
   <p>
 "But," remarked a gentleman to
   young Mr. Pratt, "your father said he broke a plate; how did he get it
   without your seeing him?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "When he asks for some dinner, we put
   it outside the window and go away; whilst we watch he will not take it, but no
   sooner have we withdrawn than it is gone."</p>
 
   <p>
 "How does he know that you are
   watching?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "That's more than I can tell, but he
   either knows or suspects. One day my brothers Robert and James with myself
   were in our back parlour, which has a window into the garden, when he came
   outside and said, 'Ho, ho, ho ! master James, and Robert, and Henry, give poor
   Teigue a glass of whiskey.' James went out of the room, filled a glass with
   whiskey, vinegar, and salt, and brought it to him. ' Here, Teigue,' said he,
   come for it now.' 'Well, put it down, then, on the step outside the window.'
   This was done, and we stood looking at it. 'There, now, go away,' he shouted.
   We retired, but still watched it. ' Ho, ho ! you are watching Teigue; go out
   of the room, now, or I won't take it.' We went outside the door and returned,
   the glass was gone, and a moment after we heard him roaring and cursing
   frightfully. He took away the glass, but the next day the glass was on the
   stone step under the window, and there were crumbs of bread in the inside, as
   if he had put it in his pocket,; from that time he was not heard till
   to-day."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Oh," said the colonel, "
   I'll get a sight of him; you are not used to these things; an old soldier has
   the best chance; and as I shall finish my dinner with this wing, I'll be ready
   for him when he speaks next. Mr. Bell, will you take a glass of wine with
   me?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ho, ho ! Mr. Bell," shouted
   Teigue. " Ho, ho! Mr. Bell, you were a quaker long ago. Ho, ho ! Mr.
   Bell, you're a pretty boy; - a pretty quaker you were; and now you're no
   quaker, nor any thing else : - ho, ho ! Mr. Bell. And there's Mr. Parkes: to
   be sure, Mr. Parkes looks mighty fine to-day, with his powdered head, and his
   grand silk stockings, and his bran new rakish-red waistcoat. - And there's Mr.
   Cole, - did you ever see such a fellow? a pretty company you've brought
   together, Mr. Pratt: kiln-dried quakers, butter-buying buckeens from
   Mallow-lane, and a drinking exciseman from the Coal-quay, to meet the great
   thundering artillery-general that is come out of the Indies, and is the
   biggest dust of them all."</p>
 
   <p>
 "You scoundrel !" exclaimed the
   colonel: "I'll make you show yourself;" and snatching up his sword
   from a corner of the room, he sprang out of the window upon the lawn. In a
   moment a shout of laughter, so hollow, so unlike any human sound, made him
   stop, as well as Mr. Bell, who with a huge oak stick was close at the
   colonel's heels; others of the party followed on the lawn, and the remainder
   rose and went to the windows.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Come on, colonel," said Mr.
   Bell; "let us catch this impudent rascal."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ho, ho! Mr. Bell, here I am - here's
   Teigue - why don't you catch him? - Ho, ho! colonel Pratt, what a pretty
   soldier you are to draw your sword upon poor Teigue, that never did any body
   harm."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Let us see your face, you
   scoundrel," said the colonel.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ho, ho, ho ! - look at me - look at
   me: do you see the wind, colonel Pratt? - you'll see Teigue as soon; so go in
   and finish your dinner."</p>
 
   <p>
 "If you're upon the earth I'll find
   you, you villain !" said the colonel, whilst the same unearthly shout of
   derision seemed to come from behind an angle of the building. "He's round
   that corner," said Mr. Bell - " run, run."</p>
 
   <p>
 They followed the sound, which was
   continued at intervals along the garden wall, but could discover no human
   being; at last both stopped to draw breath, and in an instant, almost at their
   ears, sounded the shout.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ho, ho, ho ! colonel Pratt, do you
   see Teigue now ? - do you hear him ? - Ho, ho, ho ! you're a fine colonel to
   follow the wind."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Not that way, Mr. Bell - not that
   way; come here," said the colonel.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ho, ho, ho ! what a fool you are; do
   you think Teigue is going to show himself to you in the field, there? But,
   colonel, follow me if you can : - you a soldier ! - ho, ho, ho !" The
   colonel was enraged - he followed the voice over hedge and ditch, alternately
   laughed at and taunted by the unseen object of his pursuit - (Mr. Bell, who
   was heavy, was soon thrown out), until at length, after being led a weary
   chase, he found him self at the top of the cliff over that part of the river
   Lee which, from its great depth, and the blackness of its water, has received
   the name of Hell-hole. Here, on the edge of the cliff, stood the colonel out
   of breath, and mopping his forehead with his handkerchief; while the voice,
   which seemed close at his feet, exclaimed -" Now, colonel Pratt - now, if
   you 're a soldier, here's a leap for you; - now look at Teigue - why don't you
   look at him? - Ho, ho, ho! Come along: you're warm, I'm sure, colonel Pratt,
   so come in and cool yourself; Teigue is going to have a swim !" The voice
   seemed as descending amongst the trailing ivy and brushwood which clothes this
   picturesque cliff nearly from top to bottom, yet it was impossible that any
   human being could have found footing. "Now, colonel, have you courage to
   take the leap? - Ho, ho, ho ! what a pretty soldier you are. Good-by - I'll
   see you again in ten minutes above, at the house - look at your watch colonel:
   - there's a dive for you;" and a heavy plunge into the water was heard.
   The colonel stood still, but no sound followed, and he walked slowly back to
   the house, not quite half a mile from the Crag."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Well, did you see Teigue?" said
   his brother, whilst his nephews, scarcely able to smother their laughter,
   stood by." Give me some wine," said the colonel. " I never was
   led such a dance in my life: the fellow carried me all round and round, till
   he brought me to the edge of the cliff', and then down he went into Hell-hole,
   telling me he'd be here in ten minutes; 'tis more than that now, but he's not
   come."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ho, ho, ho! colonel, is'nt he here? -
   Teigue never told a lie in his life: but, Mr. Pratt, give me a drink and my
   dinner, and then good night to you all, for I'm tired; and that's the
   colonel's doing." A plate of food was ordered: it was placed by John,
   with fear and trembling, on the lawn under the window. Every one kept on the
   watch, and the plate remained undisturbed for some time.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ah! Mr. Pratt, will you starve poor
   Teigue? Make every one go away from the windows, and master Henry out of<i> </i>the
   tree, and master Richard off the garden wall."</p>
 
   <p>
 The eyes of the company were turned to the
   tree and the garden wall; the two boys' attention was occupied in getting
   down: the visitors were looking at them; and "Ho, ho, ho! - good luck to
   you, Mr. Pratt! - 'tis a good dinner, and there's the plate, ladies and
   gentlemen - good bye to you, colonel - good-bye, Mr. Bell ! - good-bye to you
   all " - brought their attention back, when they saw the empty plate lying
   on the grass; and Teigue's voice was heard no more for that evening. Many
   visits were afterwards paid by Teigue; but never was he seen, nor was any
   discovery ever made of his person or character.</p>
