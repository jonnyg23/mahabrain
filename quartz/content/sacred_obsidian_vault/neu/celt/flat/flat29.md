 <center><h1>Flory Cantillon's Funeral</h1></center>
   <p>
 THE ancient burial-place of the Cantillon family was on an
   island in Ballyheigh Bay. This island was situated at no great distance from
   the shore, and at a remote period was overflowed in one of the incroachments
   which the Atlantic has made on that part of the coast of Kerry. The fishermen
   declare they have often seen the ruined walls of an old chapel beneath them in
   the water, as they sailed over the clear green sea, of a sunny afternoon
   ["The neighbouring inhabitants," says Dr. Smith, in his History of
   Kerry, speaking of Ballyheigh, "show some rocks visible in this bay only
   at low tides, which<b><i>, </i></b>they say, are the remains of an island,
   that was formerly the burial-place of the family of Cantillon, the ancient
   proprietors of Ballyheigh." p.210.] However this may be, it is well known
   that the Cantillons were, like most other Irish families, strongly attached to
   their ancient burial-place; and this attachment led to the custom, when any of
   the family died, of carrying the corpse to the sea-side, where the coffin was
   left on the shore within reach of the tide. In the morning it had disappeared,
   being, as was traditionally believed, conveyed away by the ancestors of the
   deceased to their family tomb.</p>
 
   <p>
 Connor Crowe, a county Clare man, was related to the
   Cantillons by marriage. "Connor Mac in Cruagh, of the seven quarters of
   Breintragh," as he was commonly called, and a proud man he was of the
   name. Connor, be it known, would drink a quart of salt water, for its
   medicinal virtues, before breakfast; and for the same reason, I suppose,
   double that quantity of raw whiskey between breakfast and night, which last he
   did with as little inconvenience to himself as any man in the barony of
   Moyferta; and were I to add Clanderalaw and Ibrickan, I don't think I should
   say wrong.</p>
 
   <p>
 On the death of Florence Cantillon, Connor Crowe was
   determined to satisfy himself about the truth of this story of the old church
   under the sea: so when he heard the news of the old fellow's death, away with
   him to Ardfert, where Flory was laid out in high style, and a beautiful corpse
   he made.</p>
 
   <p>
 Flory had been as jolly and as rollocking a boy in his day as
   ever was stretched, and his wake was in every respect worthy of him. There was
   all kind of entertainment and all sort of diversion at it, and no less than
   three girls got husbands there - more luck to them. Every thing was as it
   should be : all that side of the country, from Dingle to Tarbert, was at the
   funeral. The Keen was sung long and bitterly; and, according to the family
   custom, the coffin was carried to Ballyheigh strand, where it was laid upon
   the shore with a prayer for the repose of the dead.</p>
 
   <p>
 The mourners departed, one group after an-other, and at last
   Connor Crowe was left alone: he then pulled out his whiskey bottle, his drop
   of comfort as he called it, which he required, being in grief; and down he sat
   upon a big stone that was sheltered by a projecting rock, and partly concealed
   from view, to await with patience the appearance of the ghostly undertakers.</p>
 
   <p>
 The evening came on mild and beautiful; he whistled an old air
   which he had heard in his childhood, hoping to keep idle fears out of his
   head; but the wild strain of that melody brought a thousand recollections with
   it, which only made the twilight appear more pensive.</p>
 
   <p>
 "If 't was near the gloomy tower of Dunmore, in my own
   sweet county,. I was," said Connor Crowe, with a sigh, " one might
   well believe that the prisoners, who were murdered long ago, there in the
   vaults under the castle, would be the hands to carry off the coffin out of
   envy, for never a one of them was buried decently, nor had as much as a coffin
   amongst them all. 'Tis often, sure enough, I have heard lamentations and great
   mourning coming from the vaults of Dunmore Castle; but," continued he,
   after fondly pressing his lips to the mouth of his companion and silent
   comforter, the whiskey bottle, " didn't I know all the time well enough,
   'twas the dismal sounding waves working through the cliffs and hollows of the
   rocks, and fretting themselves to foam, Oh then, Dunmore Castle, it is you
   that are the gloomy looking tower on a gloomy day, with the gloomy hills
   behind you when one has gloomy thoughts on their heart, and sees you like a
   ghost rising out of the smoke made by the kelp burners on the strand, there
   is, the Lord save us! as fearful a look about you as about the Blue Man's Lake
   at midnight. Well then, any how<i>," </i>said Connor, after a pause,
   " is it not a blessed night, though surely the moon looks mighty pale in
   the face? St. Senan himself between us and all kinds of harm."</p>
 
   <p>
 It was, in truth, a lovely moonlight night; no-thing was to be
   seen around but the dark rocks, and the white pebbly beach, upon which the sea
   broke with a hoarse and melancholy murmur. Connor, notwithstanding his
   frequent draughts, felt rather queerish, and almost began to repent his
   curiosity. It was certainly a solemn sight to behold the black coffin resting
   upon the white strand. His imagination gradually converted the deep moaning of
   old ocean into a mournful wail for the dead, and from the shadowy recesses of
   the rocks he imaged forth strange and visionary forms.</p>
 
   <p>
 As the night advanced, Connor became weary with watching; he
   caught himself more than once in the fact of nodding, when suddenly giving his
   head a shake, he would look towards the black coffin. But the narrow house of
   death remained unmoved before him.</p>
 
   <p>
 It was long past midnight, and the moon was sinking into the
   sea, when he heard the sound of many voices, which gradually became stronger,
   above the heavy and monotonous roll of the sea: he listened, and presently
   could distinguish a Keen, of exquisite sweetness, the notes of which rose and
   fell with the heaving of the waves, whose deep murmur mingled with and
   supported the strain !</p>
 
   <p>
 The Keen grew louder and louder, and seemed to approach the
   beach, and then fell into a low plaintive wail. As it ended, Connor beheld a
   number of strange, and in the dim light, mysterious looking figures, emerge
   from the sea, and surround the coffin, which they prepared to launch into the
   water.</p>
 
   <p>
 " This comes of marrying with the creatures of
   earth," said one of the figures, in a clear, yet hollow tone.</p>
 
   <p>
 "True," replied another, with a voice still more
   fearful, "our king would never have commanded his gnawing white-toothed
   waves to devour the rocky roots of the island cemetery, had not his daughter,
   Durfulla, been buried there by her mortal husband !"</p>
 
   <p>
 " But the time will come," said a third, bending
   over the coffin.</p>
 
   <p>
 "When mortal eye - our work shall spy,<br>
 
   And mortal ear - our dirge shall hear."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Then," said a fourth, " our burial of the
   Cantillons is at an end for ever !"</p>
 
   <p>
 As this was spoken, the coffin was borne from the beach by a
   retiring wave, and the company of sea people prepared to follow it: but at the
   moment, one chanced to discover Connor Crowe, as fixed with wonder and as
   motionless with fear as the stone on which he sat.</p>
 
   <p>
 "The time is come," cried the unearthly being,
   "the time is come; a human eye looks on the forms of ocean, a human ear
   has heard their voices; farewell to the Cantillons; the sons of the sea are no
   longer doomed to bury the dust of the earth !"</p>
 
   <p>
 One after the other turned slowly round, and regarded Connor
   Crowe, who still remained as if bound by a spell. Again arose their funeral
   song; and on the next wave they followed the coffin. The sound of the
   lamentation died away, and at length nothing was heard but the rush of waters.
   The coffin and the train of sea people sank over the old church-yard, and
   never, since the funeral of old Flory Cantillon, have any of the family been
   carried to the strand of Ballyheigh, for conveyance to their rightful
   burial-place, beneath the waves of the Atlantic.</p>
