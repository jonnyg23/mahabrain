   <p>
 THE Reverend Charles Bunworth was rector of Buttevant, in the
   county of Cork, about the middle of the last century. He was a man of
   unaffected piety, and of sound learning; pure in heart, and benevolent in
   intention. By the rich he was respected, and by the poor beloved; nor did a
   difference of creed prevent their looking up to ." <i>the minister</i>
   "(so was Mr. Bunworth called by them) in matters of difficulty and in
   seasons of distress, confident of receiving from him the advice and assistance
   that a father would afford to his children. He was the friend and' the
   benefactor of the surrounding country - to him, from the neighbouring town of
   Newmarket, came both Curran and Yelverton for advice and instruction, previous
   to their entrance at Dublin College. Young, indigent and inexperienced, these
   afterwards eminent men received from him, in addition to the advice they
   sought, pecuniary aid; and the brilliant career which was theirs, justified
   the discrimination of the giver.</p>
 
   <p>
 But what extended the fame of Mr. Bunworth far beyond the
   limits of the parishes adjacent to his own, was his performance on the Irish
   harp, and his hospitable reception and entertainment of the poor harpers who
   travelled from house to house about the country. Grateful to their patron,
   these itinerant minstrels sang his praises to the tingling accompaniment of
   their harps, invoking in return for his bounty abundant blessings on his white
   head, and celebrating in their rude verses the blooming charms of his
   daughters, Elizabeth and Mary. It was all these poor fellows could do; but who
   can doubt that their gratitude was sincere, when, at the time of Mr.
   Bunworth's death, no less than fifteen harps were deposited on the loft of his
   granary, bequeathed to him by the last members of a race which has now ceased
   to exist, Trifling, no doubt, in intrinsic value were these relics, yet there
   is something in gifts of the heart that merits preservation; and it is to be
   regretted that, when he died, these harps were broken up one after the other,
   and used as fire-wood by an ignorant follower of the family, who, on their
   remove to Cork for a temporary change of scene; was left in charge of the
   house.</p>
 
   <p>
 The circumstances attending the death of Mr. Bunworth may be
   doubted by some; but there are still living credible witnesses who declare
   their authenticity, and who can be produced to attest most, if not all of the
   following particulars.</p>
 
   <p>
 About a week previous to his dissolution, and early in the
   evening, a noise was heard at the hall-door resembling the shearing of sheep;
   but at the time no particular attention was paid to it. It was nearly eleven
   o'clock the same night, when Kavanagh, the herdsman, returned from Mallow,
   whither he had been sent in the afternoon for some medicine, and was observed
   by Miss Bunworth, to whom he delivered the parcel, to be much agitated. At
   this time, it must be observed, her father was by no means considered in
   danger.</p>
 
   <p>
 "What is the matter, Kavanagh?" asked Miss Bunworth:
   but the poor fellow, with a bewildered look, only uttered, "The master,
   Miss - the master - he is going from us;" and, overcome with real grief,
   he burst into a flood of tears.</p>
 
   <p>
 Miss Bunworth, who was a woman of strong nerve, enquired if
   any thing he bad learned in Mallow induced him to suppose that her' father was
   worse.</p>
 
   <p>
 " No, Miss," said Kavanagh; "it was not in
   Mallow -"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Kavanagh," said Miss Bunworth, with that
   stateliness of manner for which she is said to have been remarkable, "I
   fear you have been drinking, which, I must say, I did not expect at such a
   time as the present, when it was your duty to have kept yourself sober ; - I
   thought you might have been trusted: - what should we have done if you had
   broken the medicine. bottle, or lost it? for the doctor said it was of the
   greatest consequence that your master should take the medicine to-night. But I
   will speak to you in the morning, when you are in a fitter state to
   under-stand what I say."</p>
 
   <p>
 Kavanagh looked up with a stupidity of aspect which did not
   serve to remove the impression of his being drunk, as his eyes appeared heavy
   and dull after the flood of tears - but his voice was not that of an
   intoxicated person.</p>
 
   <p>
 Miss," said he," as I hope to receive mercy
   hereafter, neither bit nor sup has passed my lips since I left this house: but
   the master ----"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Speak softly," said Miss Bunworth; "he sleeps,
   and is going on as well as we could expect."</p>
 
   <p>
 Praise be to God for that, any way," replied Kavanagh;
   " but oh! Miss, he is going from us surely - we will lose him-the master
   - we will lose him, we will lose him!" and he wrung his hands together.</p>
 
   <p>
 "What is it you mean, Kavanagh?" asked Miss
   Bunworth.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Is it mean?" said Kavanagh: "the Banshee has
   come for him, Miss; and 'tis not I alone who have heard her."</p>
 
   <p>
 " 'Tis an idle superstition," said Miss Bunworth.</p>
 
   <p>
 "May be so," replied Kavanagh, as if the words idle
   superstition only sounded upon his ear without reaching his mind - "May
   be so," he continued; "but as I came through the glen of Ballybeg,
   she was along with me keening, and screeching, and clapping her hands, by my
   side, every step of the way, with her long white hair failing about her
   shoulders, and I could hear her repeat the master's name every now and then,
   as plain as ever I heard it. When I came to the old abbey, she parted from me
   there, and turned into the pigeon-field next the <i>berrin</i><i>
   </i>ground, and folding her cloak about her, down
   she sat under the tree that was struck by the lightning, and began keening so
   bitterly, that it went through one's heart to hear it."</p>
 
   <p>
 " Kavanagh," said Miss Bunworth, who had, however,
   listened attentively to this remarkable relation, " my father is, I
   believe, better; and I hope will himself soon be up and able to convince you
   that all this is but your own fancy; nevertheless, I charge you not to mention
   what you have told me, for there is no occasion to frighten your fellow
   servants with the story."</p>
 
   <p>
 Mr. Bunworth gradually declined; but nothing particular
   occurred until the night previous to his death: that night both his daughters,
   exhausted with continued attendance and watching, were prevailed upon to seek
   some repose; and an elderly lady, a near relative and friend of the family,
   remained by the bedside of their father. The old gentleman then lay in the
   parlour, where he had been in the morning removed at his own request, fancying
   the change would afford him relief; and the head of his bed was placed close
   to the window. In a room adjoining sat some male friends, and, as usual on
   like occasions of illness, in the kitchen many of the followers of the family
   had assembled.</p>
 
   <p>
 The night was serene and moonlight-the sick man slept - and
   nothing broke the stillness of their melancholy watch, when the little party
   in the room adjoining the parlour, the door of which stood open, was suddenly
   roused by a sound. at the window near the bed: a rose-tree grew out-side the
   window, so close as to touch the glass; this was forced aside with some noise,
   and a low moaning was heard, accompanied by clapping. of hands, as if of a
   female in deep affliction. It seemed as if the sound proceeded from a person
   holding her mouth close to the window. The lady who sat by the bedside of Mr.
   Bunworth went into the adjoining room, and in the tone of alarm, enquired of
   the gentlemen there, if they had heard the Banshee? Sceptical of super natural
   appearances, two of them rose hastily and went out to discover the cause of
   these sounds, which they also had distinctly heard. They walked all round the
   house, examining every spot of ground, particularly near the window from the
   voice had proceeded; the bed of earth beneath, in which the rose tree was
   planted, had been recently dug, and the print of a footstep - if the tree had
   been forced aside by mortal hand - would have inevitably remained; but they
   could perceive no such impression; and an unbroken stillness reigned without.
   Hoping to dispel the mystery, they continued their search anxiously along the
   road, from the straightness of which and the' lightness of the night, 'they
   were enabled to see some distance around them; but all was silent and
   deserted, and they returned surprised and disappointed. How much more then
   were 'they astonished at learning that the whole time of their absence, those
   who remained within the house had heard the moaning and clapping of hands even
   louder and more distinct than before they had gone out; and no sooner was the
   door of the room closed on them, than they again heard the same mournful
   sounds! Every succeeding hour the sick man became worse, and as the first
   glimpse of the morning appeared, Mr. Bunworth expired.</p>
