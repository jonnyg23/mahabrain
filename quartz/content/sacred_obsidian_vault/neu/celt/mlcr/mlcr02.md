   <p>
 Ireland and the Celtic Religion</p>
 
 
 <p>
 WE have said that the Irish among the Celtic
 peoples possess the unique interest of having carried into the light of modern
 historical research many of the features of a native Celtic civilisation. There
 is, however, one thing which they did not carry across the gulf which divides us
 from the ancient world - and this was their religion.</p>
 
 <p>
 It was not merely that they changed it ; they
 left it behind them so entirely that all record of it is lost. St. Patrick,
 himself a Celt, who apostolised Ireland during the fifth century, has left us an
 autobiographical narrative of his mission, a document of intense interest, and
 the earliest extant record of British Christianity; but in it he tells us
 nothing of the doctrines he came to supplant. We learn far more of Celtic
 religious beliefs from Julius Caesar, who approached them from quite another
 side. The copious legendary literature which took its present form in Ireland
 between the seventh and the twelfth centuries, though often manifestly going
 back to pre-Christian sources, shows us, beyond a belief in magic and a devotion
 to certain ceremonial or chivalric observances, practically nothing resembling a
 religious or even an ethical system. We know that certain chiefs and bards
 offered a long resistance to the new faith, and that this resistance came to the
 arbitrament of battle at Moyrath in the sixth century, but no echo of any
 intellectual controversy, no matching of one doctrine against another, such as
 we find, for instance, in the records of the controversy of Celsus with Origen,
 has reached us from this period of change and strife. The literature of ancient
 Ireland, as we</p>
 
 <p>
 [51]</p>
 
 <p>
 shall see, embodied many ancient myths; and
 traces appear in it of beings who must, at one time, have been gods or elemental
 powers; but all has been emptied of religious significance and turned to romance
 and beauty. Yet not only was there, as Caesar tells us, a very well developed
 religious system among the Gauls, but we learn on the same authority that the
 British Islands were the authoritative centre of this system ; they were, so to
 speak, the Rome of the Celtic religion.</p>
 
 <p>
 What this religion was like we have now to
 consider, as an introduction to the myths and tales which more or less remotely
 sprang from it.</p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 <br>
 
 The Popular Religion of the Celts</p>
 
 
 <p>
 But first we must point out that the Celtic
 religion was by no means a simple affair, and cannot be summed up as what we
 call "Druidism." Beside the official religion there was a body of
 popular superstitions and observances which came from a deeper and older source
 than Druidism, and was destined long to outlive it-indeed, it is far from dead
 even yet.</p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 <br>
 
 The Megalithic People</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The religions of primitive peoples mostly
 centre on, or take their rise from, rites and practices connected with the
 burial of the dead. The earliest people inhabiting Celtic territory in the West
 of Europe of whom we have any distinct knowledge are a race without name or
 known history, but by their sepulchral monuments, of which so many still exist,
 we can learn a great deal about them. They were the so-called Megalithic People,
 [from Greek megas, great and lithos, a stone] the builders of dolmens,
 cromlechs, and chambered tumuli, of which more than three</p>
 
 <p>
 [52]</p>
 
 <p>
 thousand have been counted in France alone.
 Dolmens are found from Scandinavia southwards, all down the western lands of
 Europe to the Straits of Gibraltar, and round by the Mediterranean coast of
 Spain. They occur in some of the western islands of the Mediterranean, and are
 found in Greece, where, in Mycenae, an ancient dolmen yet stands beside the
 magnificent burial-chamber of the Atreidae. Roughly, if we draw a line from the
 mouth of the Rhone northward to Varanger Fiord, one may say that, except for a
 few Mediterranean examples, all the dolmens in Europe lie to the west of that
 line. To the east none are found till we come into Asia. But they cross the
 Straits of Gibraltar, and are found all along the North African littoral, and
 thence eastwards through Arabia, India, and as far as Japan.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Dolmens, Cromlechs, and Tumuli</p>
 
 
 <p>
 A dolmen, it may be here explained, is a kind
 of chamber composed of upright unhewn stones, and roofed generally with a single
 huge stone. They are usually wedge-shaped in plan, and traces of a porch or
 vestibule can often be noticed. The primary intention of the dolmen was to
 represent a house or dwelling-place for the dead. A cromlech (often confused in
 popular language the dolmen) is properly a circular arrangement of standing
 stones, often with a dolmen in their midst.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 It is believed that most</p>
 
 <p>
 [53]</p>
 
 <p>
 if not all of the now exposed dolmens were
 originally covered with a great mound of earth or of smaller stones. Sometimes,
 as in the illustration we give from Carnac, in Brittany, great avenues or
 alignments are formed of single upright Stones, and these, no doubt, had some
 purpose connected with the ritual of worship carried on in the locality. The
 later megalithic monuments, as at Stonehenge, may be of dressed stone, but in
 all cases their rudeness of construction, the absence of any sculpturing (except
 for patterns or symbols incised on the surface), the evident aim at creating a
 powerful impression by the brute strength of huge monolithic masses, as well as
 certain subsidiary features in their design which shall be described later on,
 give these megalithic monuments a curious family likeness and mark them out from
 the chambered tombs of the early Greeks, of the Egyptians, and of other more
 advanced races. The dolmens proper gave place in the end to great chambered
 mounds or tumuli, as at New Grange, which we also reckon as belonging to the
 Megalithic People. They are a natural development of the dolmen. The early
 dolmen-builders were in the Neolithic stage of culture, their weapons were of
 polished stone. But in the tumuli not only Stone, but also bronze, and even
 iron, instruments are found-at first evidently importations, but afterwards of
 local manufacture.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Origin of the Megalithic People</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The language originally spoken by this people
 can only be conjectured by the traces of it left in that of their conquerors,
 the Celts.[see p.78] But a map of the distribution of their monuments
 irresistibly suggests the idea that their builders were of North African origin;
 that they were not at first accustomed to traverse the</p>
 
 <p>
 [54]</p>
 
 <p>
 sea for any great distance; that they
 migrated west wards along North Africa, crossed into Europe where the
 Mediterranean at Gibraltar narrows to a strait of a few miles in width, and
 thence spread over the western regions of Europe, including the British Islands,
 while on the eastward they penetrated by Arabia into Asia. It must, however, be
 borne in mind that while originally, no doubt, a distinct race, the Megalithic
 People came in the end to represent, not a race, but a culture. The human
 remains found in these sepulchres, with their wide divergence in the shape of
 the skull, &amp;c., clearly prove this. [See Borlase's "Dolmens of
 Ireland," pp. 605, 606, for a discussion of this question.] These and other
 relics testify to the dolmen-builders in general as representing a superior and
 well-developed type, acquainted with agriculture, pasturage, and to some extent
 with seafaring. The monuments themselves, which are often of imposing size and
 imply much thought and organised effort in their construction, show
 unquestionably the existence, at this period, of a priesthood charged with the
 care of funeral rites and capable of controlling large bodies of men. Their dead
 were, as a rule, not burned, but buried whole - the greater monuments marking,
 no doubt, the sepulchres of important personages, while the common people were
 buried in tombs of which no traces now exist.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Celts of the Plains</p>
 
 
 <p>
 De Jubainville, in his account of the early
 history of the Celts, takes account of two main groups only-the Celts and the
 Megalithic People. But A. Bertrand, in his very valuable work '"La Religion
 des Gaulois," distinguishes two elements among the Celts themselves. There
 are, besides the Megalithic People, the two groups</p>
 
 <p>
 [55]</p>
 
 <p>
 of lowland Celts and mountain Celts. The
 lowland Celts, according to his view, started from the Danube and entered Gaul
 probably about 1200 B.C. They were the founders of the lake-dwellings in
 Switzerland, in the Danube valley, and in Ireland. They knew the use of metals,
 and worked in gold, in tin, in bronze) and towards the end of their period in
 iron. Unlike the Megalithic People, they spoke a Celtic tongue, [Professor
 Ridgeway (see Report of the Brit. Assoc. for 1908) has contended that the
 Megalithic People spoke an Aryan language; otherwise he thinks more traces of
 its influence must have survived in the Celtic which supplanted it. The weight
 of authority, as well as such direct evidence as we possess, seems to be against
 his view.] though Bertrand seems to doubt their genuine racial affinity with the
 true Celts. They were perhaps Celticised rather than actually Celtic. They were
 not warlike; a quiet folk of herdsmen, tillers, and artificers. They did not
 bury, but burned their dead. At a great settlement of theirs, Golasecca, in
 Cisalpine Gaul, 6000 interments were found. In each case the body had been
 burned; there was not a single burial without previous burning.</p>
 
 <p>
 This people entered Gaul not (according to
 Bertrand), for the most part, as conquerors, but by gradual infiltration,
 occupying vacant spaces wherever they found them along the valleys and plains.
 They came by the passes of the Alps, and their starting-point was the country of
 the Upper Danube, which Herodotus says "rises among the Celts." They
 blended peacefully with the Megalithic People among whom they settled, and did
 not evolve any of those advanced political institutions which are only nursed in
 war, but probably they contributed powerfully to the development of the
 Druidical system of religion and to the bardic poetry</p>
 
 <p>
 [56]</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The<i> </i>Celts of the Mountains</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Finally, we have a third group, the true
 Celtic group, which followed closely on the track of the second. It was at the
 beginning of the sixth century that it first made its appearance on the left
 bank of the Rhine. While Bertrand calls the second group Celtic, these he styles
 Galatic, and identifies them with the Galatae of the Greeks and the Galli and
 Belgae of the Romans.</p>
 
 <p>
 The second group, as we have said, were Celts
 of the plains. The third were Celts of the mountains. The earliest home in which
 we know them was the ranges of the Balkans and Carpathians. Their organisation
 was that of a military aristocracy - they lorded it over the subject populations
 on whom they lived by tribute or pillage. They are the warlike Celts of ancient
 history - the sackers of Rome and Delphi, the mercenary warriors who fought for
 pay and for the love of warfare in the ranks of Carthage and afterwards of Rome.
 Agriculture and industry were despised by them, their women tilled the ground,
 and under their rule the common population became reduced almost to servitude;
 "plebs poene servorum habetur loco," as Caesar tells us. Ireland alone
 escaped in some degree from the oppression of this military aristocracy, and
 from the sharp dividing line which it drew between the classes, yet even there a
 reflexion of the state of things in Gaul is found, even there we find free and
 unfree tribes and oppressive and dishonouring exactions on the part of the
 ruling order.</p>
 
 <p>
 Yet, if this ruling race had some of the
 vices of untamed strength, they had also many noble and humane qualities. They
 were dauntlessly brave, fantastically chivalrous, keenly sensitive to the appeal
 of poetry, of music, and of speculative thought. Posidonius found the bardic
 institution flourishing among them about</p>
 
 <p>
 [57]</p>
 
 <p>
 100 B.C. and about two hundred years earlier
 Hecateus of Abdera describes the elaborate musical services held by the Celts in
 a Western island-probably Great Britain-in honour of their god Apollo (Lugh).
 [See Holder, "Altceltischer Sprachschatz" <i>sub voce</i>
 "Hyperboreoi"] Aryan of the Aryans, they had in them the making of a
 great and progressive nation; but the Druidic system - not on the side of its
 philosophy and science, but on that of its ecclesiastico-political organisation
 - was their bane, and their submission to it was their fatal weakness.</p>
 
 <p>
 The culture of these mountain Celts differed
 markedly from that of the lowlanders. Their age was the age of iron, not of
 bronze; their dead were not burned (which they considered a disgrace) but
 buried.</p>
 
 <p>
 The territories occupied by them in force
 were Switzerland, Burgundy, the Palatinate, and Northern France; parts of
 Britain to the west, and Illyria and Galatia to the east, but smaller groups of
 them must have penetrated far and wide through all Celtic territory, and taken
 up a ruling position wherever they went.</p>
 
 <p>
 There were three peoples, said Caesar,
 inhabiting Gaul when his conquest began; "they differ from each other in
 language, in customs, and in laws." These people he named respectively the
 Belgae, the Celtae and the Aquitani. He locates them roughly, the Belgae in the
 north and east, the Celtae in the middle, and the Aquitani in the west and
 south. The BeIgae are the Galatae of Bertrand, the Celtae are the Celts, and the
 Aquitani are the Megalithic People. They had, of course, all been more or less
 brought under Celtic influences, and the differences of language which Caesar
 noticed need not have been great; still it is noteworthy, and quite in
 accordance with Bertrand's views, that Strabo speaks of the Aquitani as
 differing markedly from the rest of the inhabitants, and as</p>
 
 <p>
 [58]</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <p>
 resembling the Iberians. The language of the
 other Gaulish peoples, he expressly adds, were merely dialects of the same
 tongue.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Religion of Magic</p>
 
 
 <p>
 This triple division is reflected more or
 less in all the Celtic countries, and must always be borne in mind when we speak
 of Celtic ideas and Celtic religion, and try to estimate the contribution of the
 Celtic peoples to European culture. The mythical literature and the art of the
 Celt have probably sprung mainly from the section represented by the Lowland
 Celts of Bertrand. But this literature of song and saga was produced by a bardic
 class for the pleasure and instruction of a proud, chivalrous, and warlike
 aristocracy, and would thus inevitably be moulded by the ideas of this
 aristocracy. But it would also have been coloured by the profound influence of
 the religious beliefs and observances entertained by the Megalithic People -
 beliefs which are only now fading slowly away in the spreading day-light of
 science. These beliefs may be summed up in the one term Magic. The nature of
 this religion of magic must now be briefly discussed, for it was a potent
 element in the formation of the body of myths and legends with which we have
 afterwards to deal. And, as Professor Bury remarked in his Inaugural Lecture at
 Cambridge, in 1903 :</p>
 
 <p>
 "For the purpose of prosecuting that
 most difficult of all inquiries, the ethnical problem, the part played by race
 in the development of peoples and the effects of race-blendings, it must be
 remembered that the Celtic world commands one of the chief portals of ingress
 into that mysterious pre-Aryan foreworld, from which it may well be that we
 modern Europeans have inherited far more than we dream."</p>
 
 <p>
 [59]</p>
 
 <p>
 The ultimate root of the word Magic is
 unknown, but proximately it is derived from the Magi, or priests of Chaldea and
 Media in pre-Aryan and pre-Semitic times, who were the great exponents of this
 system of thought, so strangely mingled of superstition, philosophy, and
 scientific observation. The fundamental conception of magic is that of the
 spiritual vitality of all nature. This spiritual vitality was not, as in
 polytheism, conceived as separated from nature in distinct divine personalities.
 It was implicit and immanent in nature; obscure, undefined, invested with all
 the awfulness of a power whose limits and nature are enveloped in impenetrable
 mystery. In its remote origin it was doubt-less, as many facts appear to show,
 associated with the cult of the dead, for death was looked upon as the
 resumption into nature, and as the investment with vague and uncontrollable
 powers, of a spiritual force formerly embodied in the concrete, limited,
 manageable, and therefore less awful form of a living human personality. Yet
 these powers were not altogether uncontrollable. The desire for control, as well
 as the suggestion of the means for achieving it, probably arose from the first
 rude practices of the art of healing. Medicine of some sort was one of the
 earliest necessities of man. And the power of certain natural substances,
 mineral or vegetable, to produce bodily and mental effects often of a most
 startling character would naturally be taken as signal evidence of what we may
 call the "magical" conception of the universe.[Thus the Greek <i>pharmakon
 </i>= medicine, poison, or charm; and I am informed that the Central African
 word for magic or charm is <i>mankwala</i> which also means medicine.] The first
 magicians were those who attained a special knowledge of healing or poisonous
 herbs; but "virtue" of some sort being attributed to every natural
 object and phenmenon,</p>
 
 <p>
 [60]</p>
 
 <p>
 a kind of magical science, partly the child
 of true research, partly of poetic imagination, partly of priestcraft, would in
 time spring up, would be codified into rites and formulas, attached to special
 places and objects, and represented by symbols. The whole subject has been
 treated by Pliny in a remarkable passage which deserves quotation at length</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Pliny on the Religion of Magic</p>
 
 
 <p>
 "Magic is one of the few<i> </i>things
 which it is important to discuss at some length, were it only because, being the
 most delusive of all the arts, it has everywhere and at all times been most
 powerfully credited. Nor need it surprise us that it has obtained so vast an
 influence, for it has united in itself the three arts which have wielded the
 most powerful sway over the spirit of man. Springing in the first instance from
 Medicine - a fact which no one can doubt-and under cover of a solicitude for our
 health, it has glided into the mind, and taken the form of another medicine,
 more holy and more profound. In the second place, bearing the most seductive and
 flattering promises, it has enlisted the motive of Religion, the subject on
 which, even at this day, mankind is most in the dark. To crown all it has had
 recourse to the art of Astrology; and every man is eager to know the future and
 convinced that this knowledge is most certainly to be obtained from the heavens.
 Thus, holding the minds of men enchained in this triple bond, it has extended
 its sway over many nations, and the Kings of Kings obey it in the East.</p>
 
 <p>
 "In the East, doubtless, it was invented
 - in Persia and by Zoroaster. [If Pliny meant that it <i>was </i>here first
 codified and organised he may be right, but the conceptions on which magic rest
 are practically universal, and of immemorial antquity.] All the authorities
 agree in this.</p>
 
 <p>
 [61]</p>
 
 <p>
 But has there not been more than one
 Zoroaster? </p>
 
 <p>
 I have noticed that in ancient times, and
 indeed almost always, one finds men seeking in this science the climax of
 literary glory - at least Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, and Plato crossed
 the seas, exiles, in truth, rather than travellers, to instruct themselves in
 this. Returning to their native land, they vaunted the claims of magic and
 maintained its secret doctrine  In the Latin nations there are early traces
 of it, as, for instance, in our Laws of the Twelve Tables'[Adopted 451 B.C. Livy
 entitles them "the fountain of all public and private right" They
 stood in the Forum till the third century A.D., but have now perished, except
 for fragments preserved in various commentaries] and other monuments, as I have
 said in a former book. In fact, it was not until the yeay 657 after the
 foundation of Rome, under the consulate of Cornelius Lentulus Crassus, that it
 was forbidden by a <i>senatus</i> <i>consultum </i>to sacrifice human beings; a
 fact which proves that up to this date these horrible sacrifices were made. The
 Gauls have been captivated by it, and that even down to our own times, or it was
 the Emperor Tiberius who suppressed the Druids and all the herd of prophets and
 medicine-men. But what is the use of launching prohibitions against an art which
 has thus traversed the ocean and penetrated even to the confines of
 Nature?" <i>(Hist. Nat</i>. xxx.)</p>
 
 <p>
 Pliny adds that the first person whom he can
 ascertain to have written on this subject was Osthanes, who accompanied Xerxes
 in his war against the Greeks, and who propagated the "germs of his
 monstrous art" wherever he went in Europe.</p>
 
 <p>
 Magic was not - so Pliny believed -
 indigenous either in Greece or in Italy, but was so much at home in Britain and
 conducted with such elaborate ritual that</p>
 
 <p>
 [62]</p>
 
 <p>
 Pliny says it would almost seem as if it was
 they who had taught it to the Persians, not the Persians to them.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Traces of Magic in Megalithic Monuments</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The imposing relics of their cult which the
 Megalithic People have left us are full of indications of their religion. Take,
 for instance, the remarkable tumulus of Mané-er-H'oeck, in Brittany. This
 monument was explored in 1864 by M. René Galles, who describes it as absolutely
 intact-the surface of the earth unbroken, and everything as the builders left
 it. [See "Revue Archéologique," t. xii., 1865, "Fouilles de
 René Galles."]</p>
 
 <p>
 At the entrance to the rectangular chamber
 was a sculptured slab, on which was graven a mysterious sign, perhaps the totem
 of a chief. Immediately on entering the chamber was found a beautiful pendant in
 green jasper about the size of an egg. On the floor in the centre of the chamber
 was a most singular arrangement, consisting of a large ring of jadite, slightly
 oval in shape, with a magnificent axe-head, also of jadite, its point resting on
 the ring. The axe was a well-known symbol of power or godhead, and is frequently
 found in rock-carvings of the Bronze Age, as well as in Egyptian hieroglyphs,
 Minoan carvings, &amp;c. At a little distance from these there lay two large
 pendants of jasper, then an axe-head in white jade, [Jade is not found in the
 native state in Europe, nor nearer than China.] then another jasper pendant. All
 these objects were ranged with evident intention <i>en suite, </i>forming a
 straight line which coincided exactly with one of the diagonals of the chamber,
 running from north-west to south-east. In one of the corners of the chamber were
 found 101 axe-heads in jade, jadite, and</p>
 
 <p>
 [63]</p>
 
 <p>
 fibrolite. There were no traces of bones or
 cinders, no funerary urn ; the structure was a cenotaph. "Are we not
 here," asks Bertrand, "in presence of some ceremony relating to the
 practices of magic?"</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Chiromancy at Gavr'inis</p>
 
 
 <p>
 In connexion with the great sepulchral
 monument of Gavr'inis a very curious observation was made by</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 M. Albert Maitre, an inspector of the Musée
 des Antiquités Nationales. There were found here-as commonly in other
 megalithic monuments in Ireland and Scotland - a number of stones sculptured
 with a singular and characteristic design in waving and concentric lines. Now if
 the curious lines traced upon the human hand at the roots and tips of the
 fingers be examined under a lens, it will be found that they bear an exact
 resemblance to these designs of megalithic sculpture. One seems almost like a
 cast of the other. These lines on the human hand are so distinct and peculiar
 that, as is well known, they have been adopted as a method of identification of
 criminals. Can this resemblance be</p>
 
 <p>
 [64]</p>
 
 <p>
 the result of chance ? Nothing like these
 peculiar assemblages of sculptured lines has ever been found except in connexion
 with these monuments. Have we not here a reference to chiromancy - a magical art
 much practised in ancient and even in modern times? The hand as a symbol of
 power was a well-known magical emblem, and has entered largely even into
 Christian symbolism - note, for instance, the great hand sculptured on the under
 side of one of the arms of the Cross of Muiredach at Monasterboice.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Holed Stones</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Another singular and as yet unexplained
 feature which appears in many of these monuments, from Western Europe to India,
 is the presence of a small hole bored through one of the stones composing the
 chamber.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Was it an aperture intended for the spirit of
 the dead ? or for offerings to them ? or the channel through which revelations
 from the spirit-world were supposed to come to a priest or magician ? or did it
 partake of all these characters?</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Holed stones, not forming part of a dolmen,
 are, of course, among the commonest relics of the ancient cult, and are still
 venerated and used in practices connected</p>
 
 <p>
 [65]</p>
 
 <p>
 with child-bearing, &amp;c. Here we are
 doubtless to interpret the emblem as a symbol of sex.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Stone-Worship</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Besides the heavenly bodies, we find that
 rivers, trees, mountains, and stones were all objects of veneration among this
 primitive people. Stone-worship was particularly common, and is not so easily
 explained as the worship directed toward objects possessing movement and
 vitality. Possibly an explanation of the veneration attaching to great and
 isolated masses of unhewn stone may be found in their resemblance to the
 artificial dolmens and cromlechs. [Small stones, crystals, and gems were,
 however, also venerated. The celebrated Black Stone of Pergamos was the subject
 of an embassy from Rome to that city in the time of the Second Punic War, the
 Sibylline Rooks having predicted victory to its possessors. It was brought to
 Rome with great rejoicings in the year 205. It is stated to have been about the
 site of a man's fist, and was probably a meteorite. Compare the myth in Hesiod
 which relates how Kronos devoured a stone in the belief that it was his
 offspring, Zeus It was then possible to mistake a stone for a god.] No
 superstition has proved more enduring. In A.D. 452 we find the Synod of Aries
 denouncing those who "venerate trees and wells and stones," and the
 denunciation was repeated by Charlemagne, and by numerous Synods and Councils
 down to recent times. Yet a drawing, here reproduced, which was lately made on
 the spot by Mr. Arthur Bell, shows this very act of worship still in full force
 in Brittany, and shows the symbols and the sacerdotal organisation of
 Christianity actually pressed into the service of this immemorial paganism.
 According to Mr. Bell, the clergy take part in these performances with much
 reluctance; but are compelled to do so by the force of local opinion. Holy
 wells, the water of which is supposed to cure diseases, are still very common in
 Ireland,</p>
 
 <p>
 [66]</p>
 
 <p>
 and the cult of the waters of Lourdes may, in
 spite of its adoption by the Church, be mentioned as a notable case in point on
 the Continent.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Cup-and-Ring Markings</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Another singular emblem, upon the meaning of
 which no light has yet been thrown, occurs frequently in connexion with
 megalithic monuments.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The accompanying illustrations show examples
 of it. Cup-shaped hollows are made in the surface of the stone, these are often
 surrounded with concentric rings, and from the cup one or more radial lines are
 drawn to a point outside the circumference of the rings. Occasionally a system
 of cups are joined by these lines, but more frequently they end a little way
 outside the widest of the rings. These strange markings are found in Great
 Britain and Ireland, in Brittany, and at various places in</p>
 
 <p>
 [67]</p>
 
 <p>
 India, where they are called <i>mahadeos</i>.
 [See Sir J. Simpson', "Archaic Sculpturings" 1867] I have also found a
 curious example - for such it appears to be - in Dupaix' "Monuments of New
 Spain." It is reproduced in Lord Kingsborough's "Antiquities of
 Mexico," vol. iv. On the circular top of a cylindrical stone, known as the
 "Triumphal Stone," is carved a central cup, with nine concentric
 circles round it, and a duct or channel cut straight from the cup through all
 the circles to the rim. Except that the design here is richly decorated and
 accurately drawn, it closely resembles a typical European cup-and-ring marking.
 That these markings mean something, and that, wherever they are found, they mean
 the same thing, can hardly be doubted, but what that meaning is remains yet a
 puzzle to antiquarians. The guess may perhaps be hazarded that they are diagrams
 or plans of a megalithic sepulchre. The central hollow represents the actual
 burial-place. The circles are the standing Stones, fosses, and ramparts which
 often surrounded it; and the line or duct drawn from the centre outwards
 represents the subterranean approach to the sepulchre. The apparent
 "avenue" intention of the duct is clearly brought out in the varieties
 given below, which I take from Simpson.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 As the sepulchre was also a holy place or
 shrine, the occurrence of a representation of it among other carvings of a
 sacred character is natural enough ; it would seem symbolically to indicate that
 the place was holy ground. How far this suggestion might apply to the Mexican
 example I am unable to say.</p>

 The Tumulus at New Grange</p>
 
 
 <p>
 One of the most important and richly
 sculptured of European megalithic monuments is the great chambered tumulus of
 New Grange, on the northern bank of the Boyne, in Ireland. This tumulus, and the
 others which occur in its neighbourhood, appear in ancient Irish mythical
 literature in two different characters, the union of which is significant. They
 are regarded on the one hand as the dwelling-places of the <i>Sidhe </i>(pronounced
 Shee), or Fairy Folk, who represent, probably, the deities of the ancient Irish,
 and they are also, traditionally, the burial-places of the Celtic High Kings of.
 pagan Ireland. The story of the burial of King Cormac, who was supposed to have
 heard of the Christian faith long before it was actually preached in Ireland by
 St. Patrick and who ordered that he should not be buried at the royal cemetery
 by the Boyne, on account of its pagan associations, points to the view that this
 place was the centre of a pagan cult involving more than merely the interment of
 royal personages in its precincts. Unfortunately these monuments are not intact;
 they were opened and plundered by the Danes in the ninth century, [The fact is
 recorded in the "Annals of the Four Masters" under the date 861 and in
 the "Annals of Ulster" under 862] but enough evidence remains to show
 that they were sepulchral in their origin, and were also associated with the
 cult of a primitive religion. The most important of them, the tumulus of New
 Grange, has been thoroughly explored and described by Mr. George Coffey, keeper
 of the collection of Celtic antiquities in the National Museum, Dublin.[See
 "Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy," vol. xxx. Pt. i, 1892, and
 "New Grange," by G. Coffey, 1912] It appears from the outside like a
 large mound, or knoll, now over-grown with bushes. It measures about 280 feet
 across,</p>
 
 <p>
 [69]</p>
 
 <p>
 at its greatest diameter, and is about 44
 feet in height. Outside it there runs a wide circle of standing stones
 originally, it would seem, thirty-five in number. Inside this circle is a ditch
 and rampart, and on top of this rampart was laid a circular curb of great stones
 8 to 10 feet long, laid on edge, and confining what has proved to he a huge
 mound of loose stones, now overgrown, as we have said, with grass and bushes. It
 is in the interior of this mound that the interest of the monument lies. Towards
 the end of the seventeenth century some workmen who were getting road-material
 from the mound came across the entrance to a passage which led into the
 interior, and was marked by the fact that the boundary stone below it is richly
 carved with spirals and lozenges. This entrance faces exactly south-east. The
 passage is formed of upright slabs of unhewn stone roofed with similar slabs,
 and varies from nearly 5 feet to 7 feet 10 inches in height ; it is about 3 feet
 wide, and runs for 62 feet straight into the heart of the mound. Here it ends in
 a cruciform chamber, 20 feet high, the roof, a kind of dome, being formed of
 large flat stones, overlapping inwards till they almost meet at the top, where a
 large flat stone covers all. In each of the three recesses of the cruciform
 chamber there stands a large stone basin, or rude sarcophagus, but no traces of
 any burial now remain.</p>

 Symbolic Carvings at New Grange</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The stones are all raw and undressed, and
 were selected for their purpose from the river-bed and elsewhere close by. On
 their flat surfaces, obtained by splitting slabs from the original quarries, are
 found the carvings which form the unique interest of this strange monument.
 Except for the large stone with spiral carvings and one other at the entrance to
 the mound,</p>
 
 <p>
 [70]</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 the intention of these Sculptures does not
 appear to have been decorative, except in a very rude and primitive sense. There
 is no attempt to cover a given surface with a system of ornament appropriate to
 its size and shape. The designs are, as it were, scribbled upon the waals anyhow
 and anywhere. [It must be observed, however, that the decoration was, certainly
 in some, and perhaps in all cases, carried out before the stones were placed in
 position. This is also the case at Gavr'inis.] Among them everywhere the spiral
 is prominent. The resemblance of some of these carvings to the supposed
 finger-markings of the stones at Gavr'inis is very remarkable. Triple and double
 spiral are also found, as well as lozenges and zigzags. A singular carving
 representing what looks like a palm-branch or fern-leaf is found in the west
 recess. The drawing of this object is naturalistic, and it is hard to interpret
 it, as Mr. Coffey is inclined to do, as merely a piece of so-called
 "herring~bone" pattern. [He has modified this view in his latest work,
 "New Grange," 1912] A similar palm-leaf design, but with the ribs
 arranged at right angles to the central axis, is found in the neighbouring
 tumulus of Dowth, at Loughcrew, and in combination with a solar emblem, the
 swastika, on a small altar in the Pyrenees, figured by Bertrand.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Ship Symbol at New Grange</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Another remarkable and, as far as Ireland
 goes, unusual figure is found sculptured in the west recess at New Grange. It
 has been interpreted by various critics as a mason's mark, a piece of Phoenician
 writing, a group of numerals, and finally (and no doubt correctly) by Mr. George
 Coffey as a rude representation of a ship with men on board and uplifted sail.
 lt is noticeable that just above it is a small circle, forming, apparently, part
 of the design. Another example occurs at Dowth.</p>
 
 <p>
 [71]</p>
 
 <p>
 The significance of this marking, as we shall
 see, is possibly very great.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 It has been discovered that on certain stones
 in the tumulus of Locmariaker, in Brittany, ["Proc. Royal Irish
 Acad.," vol. viii. 1863, p. 400, and G. Coffey, <i>op. cit. </i>p. 30]
 there occur a number of very similar figures) one of them showing the circle in
 much the same relative position as at New Grange. The axe, an Egyptian
 hieroglyph for godhead and a well-known magical emblem, is also represented on
 this stone. Again, in a brochure by Dr. Oscar Montelius on the rock-sculptures
 of Sweden ["Les Sculptures de Rochers de la Suède," read at the
 Prehistoric Congress, Stockholm, 1874; and see G. Coffey, <i>op. cit. </i>p. 60]
 we find a reproduction (also given in Du Chaillu's " Viking Age") of a
 rude rock-carving showing a number of ships with men on board, and the circle
 quartered by a cross-unmistakably a solar emblem-just above one of them.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 That these ships (which, like the Irish
 example) are often so summarily represented as to be mere symbols which no one
 could identify as a ship were the clue not given by other and more elaborate
 representations) were drawn so frequently in conjunction with the solar disk
 merely for amusement or for a purely decorative object seems to me most
 improbable.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 [72]</p>
 
 <p>
 In the days of the megalithic folk sepulchral
 monument, the very focus of religious ideas, would hardly nave been covered with
 idle and meaningless scrawls. "Man," as Sir J. Simpson has well said,
 "has ever conjoined together things sacred and things sepulchral." Nor
 do these scrawls, in the majority of instances, show any glimmering of a
 decorative intention.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 But if they had a symbolic intention, what is
 it that they symbolise ?</p>
 
 <p>
 We have here come, I believe, into a higher
 order of Ideas than that of magic. The suggestion I have to make may seem a
 daring one ; yet, as we shall see, it is quite in line with the results of
 certain other investigations as to the origin and character of the megalithic
 culture.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 If accepted, it will certainly give much
 greater definiteness to our views of the relations of the Megalithic People with
 North Africa, as well as of the true origin of Druidism and of the doctrines
 associated with that system. I think it may be taken as established that the
 frequent conjunction of the ship with the solar disk on rock-sculptures in
 Sweden, Ireland, and Brittany cannot be fortuitous. No one, for instance,
 looking at the example from Hallande given above, can doubt that the two objects
 are intentionally combined in one design.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Ship Symbol in Egypt</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Now this symbol of the ship, with or without
 the actual portrayal of the solar emblem, is of very ancient and</p>
 
 <p>
 [73]</p>
 
 <p>
 very common occurrence in the sepulchral art
 of Egypt. It is connected with the worship of Ra which came in fully 4000 years
 B.C. Its meaning as an Egyptian symbol is well known. The ship was called the
 Boat of the Sun. It was the vessel in which the Sun-god performed his journeys;
 in particular, the journey which he made nightly to the shores of the
 Other-world, bearing with him in his bark the souls of the beatified dead.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The Sun-god, Ra, is sometimes represented by
 a disk, some-times by other emblems, hovering above the vessel or contained
 within it. Any one who will look over the painted or sculptured sarcophagi in
 the British Museum will find a host of examples. Sometimes he will find
 representations of the life-giving rays of Ra pouring down upon the boat and its
 occupants. Now, in one of the Swedish rock-carvings of ships at Backa, Bohuslan,
 given by Montelius, a ship crowded with figures is shown beneath a disk with
 three descending rays, and again another ship with a two-rayed sun above it. It
 may be added that in the tumulus of Dowth, which is close to that of New Grange
 and is entirely of the same character and period, rayed figures and quartered
 circles, obviously solar emblems, occur abundantly, as also at Loughcrew and
 other places in Ireland, and one other ship figure has been identified at Dowth.</p>
 
 <p>
 [74]</p>
 
 <p>
 In Egypt the solar boat is sometimes
 represented as containing the solar emblem alone, sometimes it contains the
 figure of a god with attendant deities, sometimes it contains a crowd of
 passengers representing human soul; and sometimes the figure of a single corpse
 on a bier.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The megalithic carvings also sometimes show
 the solar emblem and some-times not; the boats are sometimes filled with figures
 and are sometimes empty. When a symbol has once been accepted and understood,
 any conventional or summary representation of it is sufficient. I take it that
 the complete form of the megalithic symbol is that of a boat with figures in it
 and with the solar emblem overhead. These figures, assuming the fore-going
 interpretation of the design to be correct, must clearly be taken for
 representations of the dead on their way to the Other-world.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 They cannot be deities, for representations
 of the divine powers under human aspect were quite unknown to the Megalithic
 People, even after the coming of the Celts - they first occur in Gaul under
 Roman influence. But if these figures represent the dead, then we have clearly
 before us the origin of the so-called "Celtic" doctrine of
 immortality. The carvings in question are pre-Celtic. They are found where no
 Celts ever penetrated. Yet they point to the existence of just that Other-world
 doctrine which, from the time of Caesar</p>
 
 <p>
 [75]</p>
 
 <p>
 downwards, has been associated with Celtic
 Druidism, and this doctrine was distinctively Egyptian.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The "Navetas"</p>
 
 
 <p>
 In connexion with this subject I may draw
 attention to the theory of Mr. W. C. Borlase that the typical design of an Irish
 dolmen was intended to represent a ship. In Minorca there are analogous
 structures, there popularly called <i>navetas </i>(ships), so distinct is the
 resemblance. But, he adds, "long before the caves and <i>navetas </i>of
 Minorca were known to me I had formed the opinion that what I have so frequently
 spoken of as the 'wedge-shape' observable so universally in the ground-plans of
 dolmens was due to an original conception of a ship. From sepulchral tumuli in
 Scandinavia we know actual vessels have on several occasions been disinterred.
 In cemeteries of the Iron Age, in the same country, as well as on the more
 southern Baltic coasts, the ship was a recognised form of sepulchral
 enclosure."["Dolmens of Ireland," pp. 701-704] If Mr. Borlase's
 view is correct, we have here a very strong corroboration of the symbolic
 intention which I attribute to the solar ship-carvings of the Megalithic People.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Ship Symbol in Babylonia</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The ship symbol, it may be remarked, can be
 traced to about 4000 B.C. in Babylonia, where every deity had his own special
 ship (that of the god Sin was called the Ship of Light, his image being carried
 in procession on a litter formed like a ship. This is thought by Jastrow
 ["The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria"] to have originated at a time
 when the sacred cities of Babylonia were situated on the Persian Gulf, and when
 religious processions were often carried out by water.</p>
 
 <p>
 [76]</p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 <br>
 
 The Symbol of the Feet</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Yet there is reason to think that some of
 these symbols were earlier than any known mythology, and were, so to say,
 mythologised differently by different peoples, who got hold of them from this
 now unknown source. A remarkable instance is that of the symbol of the Two Feet.
 In Egypt the Feet of Osiris formed one of the portions into which his body was
 cut up. In the well-known myth.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 They were a symbol of possession or of
 visitation. "I have come upon earth," says the "Book of the
 Dead" (ch. xvii.), "and with my two feet have taken possession. I am
 Tmu." Now this symbol of the feet or footprint is very widespread. It is
 found in India, as the print of the foot of Buddha, [A good example from
 Amaravati (after Fergusson) is given by Bertrand, "Rel. des G.," p.
 389.] it is found sculptured on dolmens in Brittany, [Sergi, "The
 Mediterranean Race," p.313.] and it occurs in rock-carvings in Scandinavia.
 [At Lökeberget, Bohuslän; see Montelius, <i>op. cit.</i>] In Ireland it passes
 for the footprints of St. Patrick or St. Columba. Strangest of all, it is found
 unmistakably in Mexico. [See Lord Kingsborough's "Antiquities of
 Mexico," <i>passim</i>, and the Humboldt fragment of Mexican painting
 (reproduced in Churchward's "Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man',).]
 Tyler, in his "Primitive Culture" (ii. p. '97) refers to "the
 Aztec ceremony at the Second Festival of the Sun God, Tezcatlipoca, when they
 sprinkled maize flour before his sanctuary, and his high priest watched till he
 beheld the divine footprints, and then shouted to announce, 'Our Great God is
 come.' "</p>

 The <i>Ankh </i>on Megalithic Carvings</p>
 
 
 <p>
 There is very strong evidence of the
 connexion of the Megalithic People with North Africa. Thus, as</p>
 
 <p>
 [77]</p>
 
 <p>
 Sergi points out, many signs (probably
 numerical) found on ivory tablets in the cemetery at Naqada discovered by
 Flinders Petrie are to be met with on European dolmens.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Several later Egyptian hieroglyphic signs,
 including the famous <i>Ankh, </i>or <i>crux ansata, </i>the symbol of vitality
 or resurrection, are also found in megalithic carvings. [See Sergi, <i>op. cit. </i>p.190,
 for the <i>Ankh</i> on a French doImen.] From these correspondences Letourneau
 drew the conclusion "that the builders of our megalithic monuments came
 from the South, and were related to the races of North Africa."

 Evidence from Language</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Approaching the subject from the linguistic
 side, Rhys and Brynmor Jones find that the African origin - at least proximately
 - of the primitive population of Great Britain and Ireland is strongly
 suggested. It is here shown that the Celtic languages preserve in their syntax
 the Hamitic, and especially the Egyptian type. ["The Welsh People,"
 pp. 616-664, where the subject is fully discussed in an appendix by Professor J.
 Morris Jones. "The pre-Aryan idioms which still live in Welsh and Irish
 were derived from a language allied to Egyptian and the Berber tongues."]</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Egyptian and "Celtic" Ideas of
 Immortality</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The facts at present known do not, I think,
 justify us in framing any theory as to the actual historical relation of the
 dolmen-builders of Western Europe with the people who created the wonderful
 religion and civilisation of ancient Egypt. But when we consider all the lines
 of evidence that converge in this direction it seems clear that there was such a
 relation. Egypt was the classic land of religious symbolism. It gave to</p>
 
 <p>
 [78]</p>
 
 <p>
 Europe the most beautiful and most popular of
 all its religious symbols, that of the divine mother and child. [Flinders
 Petrie, "Egypt and Israel," pp.137, 899.] I believe that it also gave
 to the primitive inhabitants of Western Europe the profound symbol of the
 voyaging spirits guided to the world of the dead by by the God of Light.</p>
 
 <p>
 The religion of Egypt, above that of any
 people whose ideas we know to have been developed in times so ancient, centred
 on the doctrine of a future life. The palatial and stupendous tombs, the
 elaborate ritual, the imposing mythology, the immense exaltation of the priestly
 caste, all these features of Egyptian culture were intimately connected with
 their doctrine of the immortality of the soul.</p>
 
 <p>
 To the Egyptian the disembodied soul was no
 shadowy simulacrum, as the classical nations believed-the future life was a mere
 prolongation of the present; the just man, when he had won his place in it,
 found himself among his relatives, his friends, his workpeople, with tasks and
 enjoyments very much like those of earth. The doom of the wicked was
 annihilation; he fell a victim to the invisible monster called the Eater of the
 Dead.</p>
 
 <p>
 Now when the classical nations first began to
 take an interest in the ideas of the Celts the thing that principally struck
 them was the Celtic belief in immortality, which the Gauls said was "handed
 down by the Druids." The classical nations believed in immortality; but
 what a picture does Homer, the Bible of the Greeks, give of the lost, degraded,
 dehumanised creatures which represented the departed souls of men ! Take, as one
 example, the description of the spirits of the suitors slain by Odysseus as
 Hermes conducts them to the Underworld :</p>
 
 <p>
 [79]</p>
 
 <p>
 "Now were summoned the souls of the dead
 by Cyllenian Hermes <br>
 
 Touched by the wand they awoke, and obeyed him and followed him, squealing,<br>
 
 Even as bats in the dark, mysterious depths of a cavern<br>
 
 Squeal as they flutter around, should one from the cluster be fallen<br>
 
 Where from the rock suspended they hung, all clinging together;<br>
 
 So did the souls flock squealing behind him, as Hermes the Helper<br>
 
 Guided them down to the gloom through dank and mouldering pathways."<br>
 
 [I quote from Mr. H. B. Cotterill's beautiful hexameter version.]</p>
 
 <p>
 The classical writers felt rightly that the
 Celtic idea of immortality was something altogether different from this. It was
 both loftier and more realistic; it implied a true persistence of the living
 man, as he was at present, in all his human relations. They noted with surprise
 that the Celt would lend money on a promissory note for repayment in the next
 world. [Valerius Maximus (about A.D. 30] ) and other classical writers mention
 this practice] That is an absolutely Egyptian conception. And this very analogy
 occurred to Diodorus in writing of the Celtic idea of immortality - it was like
 nothing that he knew of out of Egypt. [Book V].</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Doctrine of Transmigration</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Many ancient writers assert that the Celtic
 idea of immortality embodied the Oriental conception of the transmigration of
 souls, and to account for this the hypothesis was invented that they had learned
 the doctrine from Pythagoras, who represented it in classical antiquity. Thus
 Caesar : "The principal point of their [the Druids'] teaching is that the
 soul does not perish, and that after death it passes from one body into
 another." And Diodorus: "Among them the doctrine of Pythagoras
 prevails, according to which the souls of men are immortal, and after a fixed
 term recommence</p>
 
 <p>
 [80]</p>
 
 <p>
 to live, taking upon themselves a new
 body." Now traces of this doctrine certainly do appear in Irish legend.
 Thus the Irish chieftain, Mongan, who is an historical personage, and whose
 death is recorded about A.D. 625, is said to have made a wager as to the place
 of death of a king named Fothad, slain in a battle with the mythical hero Finn
 mac Cumhal in the third century. He proves his case by summoning to his aid a <i>revenant
 </i>from the Other-world, Keelta, who was the actual slayer of Fothad, and who
 describes correctly where the tomb is to be found and what were its contents. He
 begins his tale by saying to Mongan, "We were with thee," and then,
 turning to the assembly, he continues: "We were with Finn, coming from
 Alba. . . ." "Hush," says Mongan, "it is wrong of thee to
 reveal a secret." The secret is, of course, that Mongan was a reincarnation
 of Finn. [De Jubainville, " Irish Mythological Cycle," p. 191 <i>sqq.</i>]
 But the evidence on the whole shows that the Celts did not hold this doctrine at
 all in the same way as Pythagoras and the Orientals did. Transmigration was not,
 with them, part of the order of things. It <i>might </i>happen, but in general
 it did not; the new body assumed by the dead clothed them in another, not in
 this world, and so far as we can learn from any ancient authority, there does
 not appear to have been any idea of moral retribution connected with this form
 of the future life. It was not so much an article of faith as an idea which
 haunted the imagination, and which, as Mongan's caution indicates, ought not to
 be brought into clear light.</p>
 
 <p>
 However it may have been conceived, it is
 certain that the belief in immortality was the basis of Celtic Druidism. [The
 etymology of the word "Druid " is no longer an unsolved problem. It
 had been suggested that the latter part of the word might be connected with the
 Aryan root VID, which appears in "Wisdom"' in the Latin <i>videre</i>,
 &amp;c., Thurneysen has now shown that this root in combination with the
 intensiye particle <i>dru </i>would yield the word <i>dru-vids</i>, represented
 in Gaelic by <i>draoi, </i>a Druid, just as another intensive, <i>su</i>, with <i>vids</i>
 yields the Gaelic <i>saoi</i>, a sage.] Caesar affirms this distinctly, and
 declares</p>
 
 <p>
 [81]</p>
 
 <p>
 the doctrine to have been fostered by the
 Druids rather for the promotion of courage than for purely religious reasons. An
 intense Other-world faith, such as that held by the Celts, is certainly one of
 the mightiest of agencies in the hands of a priesthood who hold the keys of that
 world. Now Druidism existed in the British Islands, in Gaul, and, in fact, so
 far as we know, wherever there was a Celtic race amid a population of
 dolmen-builders. There were Celts in Cisalpine Gaul, but there were no dolmens
 there, and there were no Druids. [See Rice Holmes, "Caesar's
 Conquest," p. 15, and pp.532-536.</p>
 
 <p>
 Rhys, it may he observed, believes that
 Druidism was the religion of the aboriginal inhabitants of Western Europe
 "from the Baltic to Gibraltar" ("Celtic Britain," p. 73).
 But we only <i>know</i> of it where Celts and dolmen-builders combined. Caesar
 remarks of the Germans that they had no Druids and cared little about
 sacrificial ceremonies.] What is quite clear is that when the Celts got to
 Western Europe they found there a people with a powerful priesthood, a ritual,
 and imposing religious monuments ;a people steeped in magic and mysticism and
 the cult of the Underworld. The inferences, as I read the facts, seem to be that
 Druidism in its essential features was imposed upon the imaginative and
 sensitive nature of the Celt - the Celt with his "extraordinary
 aptitude" for picking up ideas - by the earlier population of Western
 Europe, the Megalithic People, while, as held by these, it stands in some
 historical relation, which I am not able to pursue in further detail, with the
 religious culture of ancient Egypt. Much obscurity still broods over the
 question, and perhaps will always do so, but if these</p>
 
 <p>
 [82]</p>
 
 <p>
 suggestions have anything in them, then the
 Megalithic<i> </i>People have been brought a step or two out of the atmosphere
 of uncanny mystery which has surrounded them, and they are shown to have played
 a very important part in the religious development of Western Europe, and in
 preparing that part of the world for the rapid extension of the special type of
 Christianity which took place in it. Bertrand, in his most interesting chapter
 on L'Irlande Celtique," ["Rel. des Gaulois," lecon xx.] points
 out that very soon after the conversion of Ireland to Christianity, we find the
 country covered with monasteries, whose complete organisation seems to indicate
 that they were really Druidic colleges transformed <i>en masse. </i>Caesar has
 told us what these colleges were like in Gaul. They were very numerous. In spite
 of the severe study and discipline involved, crowds flocked into them for the
 sake of the power wielded by the Druidic order, and the civil immunities which
 its members of all grades enjoyed. Arts and sciences were studied there, and
 thousands of verses enshrining the teachings of Druidism were committed to
 memory. All this is very like what we know of Irish Druidism. Such an
 organisation would pass into Christianity of the type established in Ireland
 with very little difficulty. The belief in magical rites would survive-early
 Irish Christianity, as its copious hagiography plainly shows, was as steeped in
 magical ideas as ever was Druidic paganism. The belief in immortality would
 remain, as before, the cardinal doctrine of religion. Above all the supremacy of
 the sacerdotal order over the temporal power would remain unimpaired; it would
 still be true, as Dion Chrysostom said of the Druids, that "it is they who
 command, and kings on thrones of gold, dwelling in</p>
 
 <p>
 [83]</p>
 
 <p>
 splendid palaces, are but their ministers,
 and the servants of their thought." [Quoted by Bertrand, <i>op. cit.</i> p.
 279]</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Caesar on the Druidic Culture</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The religious, philosophic, and scientific
 culture superintended by the Druids is spoken of by Caesar with much respect.
 "They discuss and impart to the youth," he writes, "many things
 respecting the stars and their motions, respecting the extent of the universe
 and of our earth, respecting the nature of things, respecting the power and the
 majesty of the immortal gods" (bk. vi. 14). We would give much to know some
 particulars of the teaching here described. But the Druids, though well
 acquainted with letters, strictly forbade the committal of their doctrines to
 writing; an extremely sagacious provision, for not only did they thus surround
 their teaching with that atmosphere of mystery which exercises so potent a spell
 over the human mind, but they ensured that it could never be effectively
 controverted.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Human Sacrifices in Gaul</p>
 
 
 <p>
 In strange discord, however, with the lofty
 words of Caesar stands the abominable practice of human sacrifice whose
 prevalence he noted among the Celts. Prisoners and criminals, or if these failed
 even innocent victims, probably children, were encased, numbers at a time, in
 huge frames of wickerwork, and there burned alive to win the favour of the gods.
 The practice of human sacrifice is, of course, not specially Druidic - it is
 found in all parts both of the Old and of the New World at a certain stage of
 culture, and was doubtless a survival from the time of the Megalithic People.
 The fact that it should have continued in Celtic lands after an other-wise</p>

 fairly high state of civilisation and
 religious culture had been attained can be paralleled from Mexico and Carthage,
 and in both cases is due, no doubt, to the uncontrolled dominance of a priestly
 caste.</p>

 Human Sacrifices in Ireland</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Bertrand endeavours to dissociate the Druids
 from these practices, of which he says strangely there is "no trace"
 in Ireland, although there, as elsewhere in Celtica, Druidism was all-powerful.
 There is little doubt, however, that in Ireland also human sacrifices at one
 time prevailed. In a very ancient tract, the "Dinnsenchus," preserved
 in the " Book of Leinster," it is stated that on Moyslaught, "the
 Plain of Adoration," there stood a great gold idol, Crom Cruach (the Bloody
 Crescent). To it the Gaels used to sacrifice children when praying for fair
 weather and fertility - " it was milk and corn they asked from it in
 exchange for their children - how great was their horror and their moaning
 !" ["The Irish Mythological Cycle," by d'Arbois de Jubainville,
 p. 61. The" Dinnsenchus" in question is an early Christian document.
 No trace of a being like Crom Cruach has been found as yet in the pagan
 literature of Ireland, nor in the writing: of St. Patrick, and I think it is
 quite probable that even in the time of St. Patrick human sacrifices had become
 only a memory.]</p>

 And in Egypt</p>
 
 
 <p>
 In Egypt, where the national character was
 markedly easy-going, pleasure-loving, and little capable of fanatical
 exaltation, we find no record of any such cruel rites in the monumental
 inscriptions and paintings, copious as is the information which they give us on
 all features of the national life and religion. [A representation of human
 sacrifice has, however, lately been discovered in a Temple of the Sun in the
 ancient Ethiopian capital, Meroe.] Manetho, indeed, the</p>

 <p>
 Egyptian historian who wrote in the third
 century B.C., tells us that human sacrifices were abolished by Amasis I. so late
 as the beginning of the XVIII Dynasty - about 1600 B.C. But the complete silence
 of the other records shows us that even if we are to believe Manetho, the
 practice must in historic times have been very rare, and must have been looked
 on with repugnance.</p>

 The Names of Celtic Deities</p>
 
 
 <p>
 What were the names and the attributes of the
 Celtic deities? Here we are very much in the dark. The Megalithic People did not
 imagine their deities under concrete personal form. Stones, rivers, wells,
 trees, and other natural objects were to them the adequate symbols, or were half
 symbols, half actual embodiments, of the supernatural forces which they
 venerated. But the imaginative mind of the Aryan Celt was not content with this.
 The existence of personal gods with distinct titles and attributes is reported
 to us by Caesar, who equates them with various figures in the Roman pantheon -
 Mercury, Apollo, Mars, and so forth. Lucan mentions a triad of deities, Aesus,
 Teutates, and Taranus ; ["You (Celts) who by cruel blood outpoured think to
 appease the pitiless Teutates, the horrid Aesus with his barbarous altars, and
 Taranus whose worship is no gentler than that of the Scythian Diana," to
 whom captives were offered up. (Lucan, "Pharsalia," i. 444) An altar
 dedicated to Aesua has been discovered in Paris.] and it is noteworthy that in
 these names we seem to be in presence of a true Celtic, <i>i.e., </i>Aryan,
 tradition Thus Aesus is derived by Belloguet from the Aryan root <i>as, </i>meaning
 "to be," which furnished the name of Asura-masda <i>(l'Esprit Sage) </i>to
 the Persians, Aesun to the Umbrians, Asa (Divine Being) to the Scandinavians.
 Teutates comes from a Celtic root meaning " valiant," .'
 warlike," and indicates</p>
 
 <p>
 [86]</p>
 
 <p>
 a deity equivalent to Mars. Taranus (?Thor),
 according to de Jubainville, is a god of the Lightning <i>(taran </i>in Welsh,
 Cornish, and Breton is the word for "thunderbolt"). Votive
 inscriptions to these gods have been found in Gaul and Britain. Other
 inscriptions and sculptures bear testimony to the existence in Gaul of a host of
 minor and local deities who are mostly mere names, or not even names, to us now.
 In the form in which we have them these conceptions bear clear traces of Roman
 influence. The sculptures are rude copies of the Roman style of religious art.
 But we meet among them figures of much wilder and stranger aspect-gods with
 triple faces, gods with branching antlers on their brows, ram-headed serpents,
 and other now unintelligible symbols of the older faith. Very notable is the
 frequent occurrence of the cross-legged "Buddha" attitude so prevalent
 in the religious art of the East and of Mexico, and also the tendency, so well
 known in Egypt, to group the gods in triads.</p>

 Caesar on the Celtic Deities</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Caesar, who tries to fit the Gallic religion
 into the framework of Roman mythology - which was exactly what the Gauls
 themselves did after the conquest - says they held Mercury to be the chief of
 the gods, and looked upon him as the inventor of all the arts, as the presiding
 deity of commerce, and as the guardian of roads and guide of travellers. One may
 conjecture that he was particularly, to the Gauls as to the Romans the guide of
 the dead, of travellers to the Other-world, Many bronze statues to Mercury, of
 Gaulish origin. still remain, the name being adopted by the Gauls, as many
 place-names still testify. [Mont Mercure, Mercoeur; Mercoirey, Montmartre Apollo
 was regarded</p>
 
 <p>
 [87]</p>
 
 <p>
 as the deity of medicine and healing, Minerva
 was the initiator of arts and crafts, Jupiter governed the sky, and Mars
 presided over war. Caesar is here, no doubt, classifying under five types and by
 Roman names a large number of Gallic divinities.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The God of the Underworld</p>
 
 
 <p>
 According to Caesar, a most notable deity of
 the Gauls was (in Roman nomenclature) Dis, or Pluto, the god of the Underworld
 inhabited by the dead. From him all the Gauls claimed to be descended, and on
 this account, says Caesar, they began their reckoning of the twenty-four hours
 of the day with the oncoming of night. [To this day in many parts of France the
 peasantry use terms like <i>annuity, o'né, anneue, </i>&amp;c., all meaning
 "to-night," for <i>aujourd hui</i> (Bertrand, "Rel. des G.,"
 p. 356] The name of this deity is not given. D'Arbois de Jubainville considers
 that, together with Aesus, Teutates, Taranus, and, in Irish mythology, Balor and
 the Fomorians, he represents the powers of darkness, death, and evil, and Celtic
 mythology is thus interpreted as a variant of the universal solar myth,
 embodying~ the conception of the eternal conflict between Day and Night.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The God of Light</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The God of Light appears in Gaul and in
 Ireland as Lugh, or Lugus, who has left his traces in many place-names such as <i>Lug-dunum
 </i>(Leyden), Lyons, &amp;c. Lugh appears in Irish legend with distinctly solar
 attributes. When he meets his army before the great conflict with the Fomorians,
 they feel, says the saga, as if they beheld the rising of the sun. Yet he is
 also, as we shall see, a god of the Underworld, belonging on the side of his
 mother Ethlinn, daughter of Balor, to the Powers of Darkness.</p>
 
 <p>
 [88]</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Celtic Conception of Death</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The fact is that the Celtic conception of the
 realm of death differed altogether from that of the Greeks and Romans, and, as I
 have already pointed out, resembled that of Egyptian religion. The Other-world
 was not a place of gloom and suffering, but of light and liberation. The Sun was
 as much the god of that world as he was or this. Evil, pain, and gloom there
 were, no doubt, and no doubt these principles were embodied by the Irish Celts
 in their myths of Balor and the Fomorians, of which we shall hear anon; but that
 they were particularly associated with the idea of death is, I think, a false
 supposition founded on misleading analogies drawn from the ideas of the
 classical nations. Here the Celts followed North African or Asiatic conceptions
 rather than those of the Aryans of Europe. It is only by realising that the
 Celts as we know them in history, from the break-up of the Mid- European Celtic
 empire Onwards) formed a singular blend of Aryan with non-Aryan characteristics,
 that we shall arrive at a true understanding of their contribution to European
 history and their influence in European culture.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Five Factors in Ancient Celtic Culture</p>
 
 
 <p>
 To sum up the conclusions indicated: we can,
 I think, distinguish five distinct factors in the religious and intellectual
 culture of Celtic lands as we find them prior to the influx of classical or of
 Christian influences. First, we have before us a mass of popular superstitions
 and of magical observances, including human sacrifice. These varied more or less
 from place to place, centring as they did largely on local features which were
 regarded as embodiments or vehicles of divine or of diabolic power. Secondly,
 there was certainly in existence a</p>
 
 <p>
 [89]</p>
 
 <p>
 thoughtful and philosophic creed) having as
 its central object of worship the Sun, as an emblem of divine power and
 constancy, and as its central doctrine the immortality of the soul. Thirdly,
 there was a worship of personified deities, Aesus, Teutates, Lugh, and others,
 conceived as representing natural forces, or as guardians of social laws.
 Fourthly, the Romans were deeply impressed with the existence among the Druids
 of a body of teaching of a quasi-scientific nature about natural phenomena and
 the constitution of the universe, of the details of which we unfortunately know
 practically nothing. Lastly, we have to note the prevalence of a sacerdotal
 organisation, which administered the whole system of religious and of secular
 learning and literature, [The <i>fili</i>, or professional poets it must be
 remembered, were a branch of thc Druidic order.] which carefully confined this
 learning to a privileged caste, and which, by virtue of its intellectual
 supremacy and of the atmosphere of religious awe with which it was surrounded,
 became the sovran power, social, political, and religious, in every Celtic
 country. I have spoken of these elements as distinct, and we can) indeed,
 distinguish them in thought, but in practice they were inextricably intertwined,
 and the Druidic organisation pervaded and ordered all. Can we now, it may be
 asked, distinguish among them what is of Celtic and what of pre-Celtic and
 probably non-Aryan origin? This is a more difficult task; yet, looking at all
 the analogies and probabilities, I think we shall not be far wrong in assigning
 to the Megalithic People the special doctrines, the ritual, and the sacerdotal
 organisation of Druidism, and to the Celtic element the personified deities,
 with the zest for learning and for speculation; while the popular superstitions
 were merely the local form assumed by conceptions as widespread as the human
 race.</p>

 The Celts of Today</p>
 
 
 <p>
 In view of the undeniably mixed character of
 the populations called "Celtic" at the present day, it is often urged
 that this designation has no real relation to any ethnological fact. The Celts
 who fought with Caesar in Gaul and with the English in Ireland are, it is said,
 no more-they have perished on a thousand battlefields from Alesia to the Boyne,
 and an older racial stratum has come to the surface in their race. The true
 Celts, according to this view, are only to be found in the tall, ruddy
 Highlanders of Perthshire and North-west Scotland, and in a few families of the
 old ruling race still surviving in Ireland and in Wales. In all this I think it
 must be admitted that there is a large measure of truth. Yet it must not be
 forgotten that the descendants of the Megalithic People at the present day are,
 on the physical side, deeply impregnated with Celtic blood, and on the spiritual
 with Celtic traditions and ideals. Nor, again, in discussing these questions of
 race-character and its origin must it ever be assumed that the character of a
 people can be analysed as one analyses a chemical compound, fixing once for all
 its constituent parts and determining its future behaviour and destiny.
 Race-character, potent and enduring though it be, is not a dead thing, cast in
 an iron mould, and there-after incapable of change and growth. It is part of the
 living forces of the world; it is plastic and vital; it has hidden potencies
 which a variety of causes, such as a felicitous cross with a different, but not
 too different, stock, or in another sphere-the adoption of a new religious or
 social ideal, may at any time unlock and bring into action.</p>
 
 <p>
 Of one thing I personally feel convinced-that
 tho problem of the ethical, social, and intellectual development of the people
 constituting what is called the</p>
 
 <p>
 [91]</p>
 
 <p>
 "Celtic Fringe" in Europe ought to
 be worked for on Celtic lines; by the maintenance of the Celtic tradition,
 Celtic literature, Celtic speech - the encouragement, in short, of all those
 Celtic affinities of which this mixed race is now the sole conscious inheritor
 and guardian. To these it will respond, by these it can be deeply moved; nor has
 the harvest ever failed those who with courage and faith have driven their
 plough into this rich field. On the other hand, if this work is to be done with
 success it must be done in no pedantic, narrow, intolerant spirit; there must be
 no clinging to the outward forms of the past simply because the Celtic spirit
 once found utterance in them. Let it be remembered that in the early Middle Ages
 Celts from Ireland were the most notable explorers, the most notable pioneers of
 religion, science, and speculative thought in Europe. [For instance, Pelagius in
 the fifth century ; Columba, Columbanus, and St. Gall in the sixth; Fridolin,
 named <i>Viator, </i>"the Trayeller," and Fursa in the seventh ;
 Virgilius (Feargal) of Salzburg, who had to answer at Rome for teaching the
 sphericity of the earth, in the eighth; Dicuil, "the Geographer;" and
 Johannes Scotus Erigena - the master mind of his epoch - in the ninth.] Modern
 investigators have traced their foot-prints of light over half the heathen
 continent, and the schools of Ireland were thronged with foreign pupils who
 could get learning nowhere else. The Celtic spirit was then playing its true
 part in the world-drama, and a greater it has never played. The legacy of these
 men should be cherished indeed, but not as a museum curiosity; nothing could be
 more opposed to their free, bold, adventurous spirit than to let that legacy
 petrify in the hands of those who claim the heirship of their name and fame.</p>

 The Mythical Literature</p>
 
 
 <p>
 After the sketch contained in this and the
 foregoing chapter of the early history of the Celts, and of the forces</p>
 
 <p>
 [92]</p>
 
 <p>
 which have moulded it, we shall flow turn to
 give an account of the mythical and legendary literature in which their spirit
 most truly lives and shines. We shall not here concern ourselves with any
 literature which is not Celtic. With all that other peoples have made - as in
 the Arthurian legends - of myths and tales originally Celtic, we have here
 nothing to do. No one can now tell how much is Celtic in them and how much is
 not. And in matters of this kind it is generally the final recasting that is of
 real importance and value. Whatever we give, then, we give without addition or
 reshaping. Stories, of course, have often to be summarised, but there shall be
 nothing in them that did not come direct from the Celtic mind, and that does not
 exist to-day in some variety, Gaelic or Cymric, of the Celtic tongue.</p>
