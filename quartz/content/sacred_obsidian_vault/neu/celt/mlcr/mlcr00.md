   THE Past may be forgotten, but it never dies. The elements which in the most
   remote times have entered into a nation's composition endure through all its
   history, and help to mould that history, and to stamp the character and genius
   of the people.</p>
 
   <p>
 The examination, therefore, of these elements, and the
   recognition, as far as possible, of the part they have actually contributed to
   the warp and weft of a nation's life, must be a matter of no small interest
   and importance to those who realise that the present is the child of the past,
   and the future of the present; who will not regard themselves, their kinsfolk,
   and their fellow citizens as mere transitory phantoms, hurrying from darkness
   into darkness, but who know that, in them, a vast historic stream of national
   life is passing from its distant and mysterious origin towards a future which
   is largely conditioned by all the past wanderings of that human stream, but
   which is also, in no small degree, what they, by their courage, their
   patriotism, their knowledge, and their understanding, choose to make it.</p>
 
   <p>
 The part played by the Celtic race as a formative influence in
   the history, the literature, and the art of the people inhabiting the British
   Islands - a people which from that centre has spread its dominions over so
   vast an area of the earth's surface - has been unduly obscured in popular
   thought. For this the current use of the term "Anglo-Saxon" applied
   to the British people as a designation of race is largely responsible.
   Historically the term is quite misleading. There is nothing to justify this
   singling out of two Low-German tribes when we wish to indicate the race
   character of the British people. The use of it leads to such absurdities as
   that which the writer noticed not long ago, when the proposed elevation by the
   Pope of an Irish bishop to a cardinalate was described in an English newspaper
   as being prompted by the desire of the head of the Catholic Church to pay a
   compliment to "the Anglo-Saxon race."</p>
 
   <p>
 The true term for the population of these islands, and for the
   typical and dominant part of the population of North America, is not
   Anglo-Saxon, but Anglo-Celtic. It is precisely in this blend of Germanic and
   Celtic elements that the British people are unique - it is precisely this
   blend which gives to this people the fire, the <i>elan</i>, and in literature
   and art the sense of style, colour, drama, which are not common growths of
   German soil, while at the same time it gives the deliberateness and depth, the
   reverence for ancient law and custom, and the passion for personal freedom,
   which are more or less strange to the Romance nations of the South of Europe.
   May they never become strange to the British Islands ! Nor is the Celtic
   element in these islands to be regarded as contributed wholly, or even very
   predominantly, by the populations of the so called "Celtic Fringe."
   It is now well known to ethnologists that the Saxons did not by any means
   exterminate the Celtic or Celticised populations whom they found in possession
   of Great Britain. Mr. E. W. B. Nicholson, librarian of the Bodleian, writes in
   his important work "Keltic Researches" (1904):</p>
 
     <p>
 <i>"Names which have not been purposely invented to
     describe race must never be taken as proof of race, but only as proof of
     community of language, or community of political organisation. We call a man
     who speaks English, lives in England, and bears an obviously English name
     (such as Freeman or Newton), an Englishman. Yet from the statistics of
     'relative nigrescence' there is good reason to believe that lancashire, West
     Yorkshire, Staffordshire, Worcester-shire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire,
     Rutland, Cambridgeshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, and part of Sussex are as
     Keltic as Perthshire and North Munster ; that Cheshire, Shropshire,
     Herefordshire, Monmouthshire, Gloucestershire, Devon, Dorset,
     Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire, and Bedfordshire are more so-and equal to
     North Wales and Leinster; while Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire exceed
     even this degree, and are on a level with South Wales and Ulster." </i>[In
     reference to the name "Freeman," Mr. Nicholson adds : No one was
     more intensely 'English' in his sympathies than the great historian of that
     name, and probably no one would have more strenuously resisted the
     suggestion that he might be of Welsh descent ; yet I have met his close
     physical counterpart in a Welsh farmer (named Evans) living within a few
     minutes of Pwllheli."]</p>
 
   <p>
 It is, then, for an Anglo-Celtic, not an
   "Anglo-Saxon," people that this account of the early history, the
   religion, and the mythical and romantic literature of the Celtic race is
   written. It is hoped that that people will find in it things worthy to be
   remembered as contributions to the general stock of European culture, but
   worthy above all to be borne in mind by those who have inherited more than
   have any other living people of the blood, the instincts and the genius of the
   Celt.</p>
