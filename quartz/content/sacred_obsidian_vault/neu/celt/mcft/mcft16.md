 <center><h1>The Leeching of Kayn's leg</h1></center>
   <p>
 THERE
   were five hundred blind men, and five hundred deaf men, and five hundred
   limping men, and five hundred dumb men, and five hundred cripple men. The five
   hundred deaf men had five hundred wives, and the five hundred limping men had
   five hundred wives, and the five hundred dumb men had five hundred wives, arid
   the five hundred cripple men had five hundred wives. Each five hundred of
   these had five hundred children and five hundred dogs. They were in the habit
   of going about in one band, and were called the Sturdy Strolling Beggarly
   Brotherhood. There was a knight in Erin called O'Cronicert, with whom they
   spent a day and a year; and they ate up all that he had, and made a poor man
   of him, till he had nothing left but an old tumble-down black house, and an
   old lame white horse. There was a king in Erin called Brian Boru; and
   O'Cronicert went to him for help. He cut a cudgel of grey oak on the outskirts
   of the wood, mounted the old lame white horse, and set off at speed through
   wood and over moss and rugged ground, till he reached the king's house. When
   he arrived he went on his knees to the king; and the king said to him,
   "What is your news, O'Cronicert ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "I have but poor news for you, king."</p>
 
   <p>
 " What poor news have you ?" said the king.</p>
 
   <p>
 "That I have had the Sturdy Strolling Beggarly
   Brotherhood for a day and a year, and they have eaten all that I had, and made
   a poor man of me," said he.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Well!" said the king, "I am sorry for you ;
   what do you want?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "I want help," said O'Cronicert ; " anything
   that you may be willing to give me."</p>
 
   <p>
 The king promised him a hundred cows. He went to the queen,
   and made his complaint to her, and she gave him another hundred. He went to
   the king's son, Murdoch Mac Brian, and he got another hundred from him. He got
   food and drink at the king's ; and when he was going away he said, " Now
   I am very much obliged to you. This will set me very well on my feet. After
   all that I have got there is another thing that I want."</p>
 
   <p>
 "What is it ? said the king</p>
 
   <p>
 "It is the lap-dog that is in and out after the queen
   that I wish for."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ha !" said the king, "it is your mightiness
   and pride that has caused the loss of your means; but if you become a good man
   you shall get this along with the rest."</p>
 
   <p>
 O'Cronicert bade the king good-bye, took the lap-dog, leapt on
   the back of the old lame white horse, and went off at speed through wood, and
   over moss and rugged ground. After he had gone some distance through the wood
   a roebuck leapt up and the lap-dog went after it. In a moment the deer started
   up as a woman behind O'Cronicert, the handsomest that eye had ever seen from
   the beginning of the universe till the end of eternity. She said to him,
   "Call your dog off me."</p>
 
   <p>
 "I will do so if you promise to marry me," said
   O'Cronicert.</p>
 
   <p>
 "If you keep three vows that I shall lay upon you I will
   marry you," said she.</p>
 
   <p>
 "What vows are they ? " said he.</p>
 
   <p>
 "The first is that you do not go to ask you' worldly king
   to a feast or a dinner without first letting me know," said she.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Hoch " said O'Cronicert, " do you think that I
   cannot keep that vow ? I would never go to invite my worldly king without
   informing you that I was going to do so. It is easy to keep that vow."</p>
 
   <p>
 "You are likely to keep it !" said she.</p>
 
   <p>
 "The second vow is," said she, "that you do not
   cast up to me in any company or meeting in which we shall be together, that
   you found me in the form of a deer."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Hoo " said O'Cronicert, " you need not to lay
   that vow upon me. I would keep it at any rate."</p>
 
   <p>
 "You are likely to keep it ! " said she.</p>
 
   <p>
 The third vow is," said she, " that you do not leave
   me in the company of only one man while you go out." It was agreed
   between them that she should marry him.</p>
 
   <p>
 They reached the old tumble-down black house. Grass they cut
   in the clefts and ledges of the rocks ; a bed they made and laid down.
   O'Cronicert's wakening from sleep was the lowing of cattle and the bleating of
   sheep and the neighing of mares, while he himself was in a bed of gold on
   wheels of silver, going from end to end of the Tower of Castle Town.</p>
 
   <p>
 "I am sure that you are surprised," said she.</p>
 
   <p>
 "I am indeed," said he.</p>
 
   <p>
 "You are in your own room," said she.</p>
 
   <p>
 "In my own room," said he. "I never had such a
   room."</p>
 
   <p>
 "I know well that you never had," said she ;
   "but you have it now. So long as you keep me you shall keep the
   room."</p>
 
   <p>
 He then rose, and put on his clothes, and went out. He took a
   look at the house when he went out ; and it was a palace, the like of which he
   had never seen, and the king himself did not possess. He then took a walk
   round the farm ; and he never saw so many cattle, sheep, and horses as were on
   it. He returned to the house, and said to his wife that the farm was being
   ruined by other people's cattle and sheep. "It is not," said she :
   " your own cattle and sheep are on it."</p>
 
   <p>
 "I never had so many cattle and sheep," said he.</p>
 
   <p>
 "I know that," said she; " but so long as you
   keep me you shall keep them. There is no good wife whose tocher does not
   follow her."</p>
 
   <p>
 He was now in good circumstances, indeed wealthy. He had gold
   and silver, as well as cattle and sheep. He went about with his gun and dogs
   hunting every day, and was a great man. It occurred to him one day that he
   would go to invite the King of Erin to dinner, but he did not tell his wife
   that he was going. His first vow was now broken. He sped away to the King of
   Erin, and invited him and his great court to dinner. The King of Erin said to
   him,</p>
 
   <p>
 "Do you intend to take away the cattle that I promised
   you?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Oh ! no, King of Erin,' said O'Cronicert ; "I could
   give you as many to-day."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ah ! " said the king, "how well you have got
   on since I saw you last !"</p>
 
   <p>
 "I have indeed," said O'Cronicert " I have
   fallen in with a rich wife who has plenty of gold and silver, and of cattle
   and sheep."</p>
 
   <p>
 "I am glad of that," said the King of Erin.</p>
 
   <p>
 O'Cronicert said, " I shall feel much obliged if you will
   go with me to dinner, yourself and your great court."</p>
 
   <p>
 "We will do so willingly," said the king.</p>
 
   <p>
 They went with him on that same day. It did not occur to
   O'Cronicert how a dinner could be prepared for the king without his wife
   knowing that he was coming. When they were going on, and had reached the place
   where O'Cronicert had met the deer, he remembered that his vow was broken, and
   he said to the king, " Excuse me; I am going on before to the house to
   tell that you are coming."</p>
 
   <p>
 The king said, " We will send off one of the lads."</p>
 
   <p>
 "You will not," said O'Cronicert ; " no lad
   will serve the purpose so well as myself."</p>
 
   <p>
 He set off to the house ; and when he arrived his wife was
   diligently preparing dinner.</p>
 
   <p>
 He told her what he had done, and asked her pardon. "I
   pardon you this time," said she: "I know what you have done as well
   as you do yourself. The first of your vows is broken."</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The king and his great court came to
 O'Cronicert 's house ; and the wife had everything ready for them as befitted a
 king and great people ; every kind of drink and food. They spent two or three
 days and nights at dinner, eating and drinking. They were praising the dinner
 highly, and O'Cronicert himself was praising it but his wife was not.
 O'Cronicert was angry that she was not praising it and he went and struck her in
 the mouth with his fist and knocked out two of her teeth. " Why are you not
 praising the dinner like the others, you contemptible deer?" said he.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 "I am not," said she : " I have seen my father's
 big dogs having a better dinner than you are giving to-night to the King of Erin
 and his court."</p>
 
 <p>
 O'Cronicert got into such a rage that he went outside of the
 door. He was not long standing there when a man came riding on a black horse,
 who in passing caught O'Cronicert by the collar of his coat, and took him up
 behind him: and they set off The rider did not say a word to O'Cronicert. The
 horse was going so swiftly that O'Cronicert thought the wind would drive his
 head off. They arrived at a big, big palace, and came off the black horse. A
 stableman came out, and caught the horse, and took it in. It was with wine that
 he was cleaning the horse's feet. The rider of the black horse said to
 O'Cronicert, " Taste the wine to see if it is better than the wine that you
 are giving to Brian Boru and his court to-night."</p>
 
 <p>
 O'Cronicert tasted the wine, and said, " This is better
 wine."</p>
 
 <p>
 The rider of the black horse said, " How unjust was the
 fist a little ago ! The wind from your fist carried the two teeth to me."</p>
 
 <p>
 He then took him into that big, handsome, and noble house, and
 into a room that was full of gentlemen eating and drinking, and he seated him at
 the head of the table, and gave him wine to drink, and said to him, " Taste
 that wine to see if it is better than the wine that you are giving to the King
 of Erin and his court to-night."</p>
 
 <p>
 "This is better wine," said O'Cronicert.</p>
 
 <p>
 "How unjust was the fist a little ago .'" said the
 rider of the black horse.</p>
 
 <p>
 When all was over the rider of the black horse said, "Are
 you willing to return home now?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "Yes," said O'Cronicert, "very willing."</p>
 
 <p>
 They then rose, and went to the stable and the black horse was
 taken out ; and they leaped on its back, and went away. The rider of the black
 horse said to O'Cronicert, after they had set off; " Do you know who I
 am?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "I do not," said O'Cronicert</p>
 
 <p>
 "I am a brother-in-law of yours," said the rider of
 the black horse ; and though my sister is married to you there is not a king or
 knight in Erin who is a match for her. Two of your vows are now broken; and if
 you break the other vow you shall lose your wife and all that you possess."</p>
 
 <p>
 They arrived at O'Cronicert's house ; and O'Cronicert said,
 "I am ashamed to go in, as they do not know where I have been since night
 came."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Hoo!" said the rider, "they have not missed you
 at all. There is so much conviviality among them, that they have not suspected
 that you have been anywhere. Here are the two teeth that you knocked out of the
 front of your wife's mouth. Put them in their place, and they will be as strong
 as ever."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Come in with me," said O'Cronicert to the rider of
 the black horse.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I will not : I disdain to go in," said the rider of
 the black horse.</p>
 
 <p>
 The rider of the black horse bade O'Cronicert good-bye, and went
 away.</p>
 
 <p>
 O'Cronicert went in ; and his wife met him as she was busy
 waiting on the gentlemen. He asked her pardon, and put the two teeth in the
 front of her mouth, and they were as strong as ever. She said, "Two of your
 vows are now broken." No one took notice of him when he went in, or said
 "Where have you been ? " They spent the night in eating and drinking,
 and the whole of the next day,</p>
 
 <p>
 In the evening the king said, "I think that it is time for
 us to be going ;" and all said that it was. O'Cronicert said, " You
 will not go to-night. I am going to get up a dance. You will go to-morrow."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Let them go," said his wife.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I will not," said he.</p>
 
 <p>
 The dance was set a-going that night. They were playing away at
 dancing and music till they became warm and hot with perspiration. They were
 going out one after another to cool themselves at the side of the house. They
 all went out except O'Cronicert and his wife, and a man called Kayn Mac Loy.
 O'Cronicert himself went out, and left his wife and Kayn Mac Loy in the house,
 and when she saw that he had broken his third vow she gave a spring through a
 room, and became a big filly, and gave Kayn Mac Loy a kick with her foot, and
 broke his thigh in two She gave another spring, and smashed the door and went
 away, and was seen no more. She took with her the Tower of Castle Town as an
 armful on her shoulder and a light burden on her back, and she left Kayn Mac Loy
 in the old tumble-down black house in a pool of rain-drip on the floor.</p>
 
 <p>
 At daybreak next day poor O'Cronicert could only see the old
 house that he had before. Neither cattle nor sheep, nor any of the fine things
 that he had was to be seen. One awoke in the morning beside a bush, another
 beside a dyke, and another beside a ditch. The king only had the honour of
 having O'Cronicert's little hut over his head. As they were leaving, Murdoch Mac
 Brian remembered that he had left his own foster-brother Kayn Mac Loy behind,
 and said there should be no separation in life between them and that he would go
 back for him. He found Kayn in the old tumble-down black house, in the middle of
 the floor, in a pool of rain-water, with his leg broken ; and he said the earth
 should make a nest in his sole and the sky a nest in his head if he did not find
 a man to cure Kayn's leg.</p>
 
 <p>
 They told him that on the Isle of Innisturk was a herb that
 would heal him.</p>
 
 <p>
 So Kayn Mac Loy was then borne away, and sent to the island, and
 he was supplied with as much food as would keep him for a month, and with two
 crutches on which he would be going out and in as he might desire. At last the
 food was spent, and he was destitute, and he had not found the herb. He was in
 the habit of going down to the shore, and gathering shell-fish, and eating it.</p>
 
 <p>
 As he was one day on the shore, he saw a big, big man landing on
 the island, and he could see the earth and the sky between his legs. He set off
 with the crutches to try if he could get into the hut before the big man would
 come upon him. Despite his efforts, the big man was between him and the door,
 and said to him, "Unless you deceive me, you are Kayn Mac Loy."</p>
 
 <p>
 Kayn Mac Loy said, "I have never deceived a man: I am
 he."</p>
 
 <p>
 The big man said to him:</p>
 
 <p>
 "Stretch out your leg, Kayn, till I put a salve of herbs
 and healing to it. Salve and binding herb and the poultice are cooling; the worm
 is channering. Pressure and haste hard bind me, for I must hear Mass in the
 great church at Rome, and be in Norway before I sleep.</p>
 
 <p>
 Kayn Mac Loy said:</p>
 
 <p>
 "May it be no foot to Kayn or a foot to any one after one,
 or I be Kayn son of Loy, If I stretch out my foot for you to put a salve of
 herbs and healing on it, till you tell me why you have no church of your own in
 Norway, so as, as now, to be going to the great church of Rome to Rome
 to-morrow.</p>
 
 <p>
 Unless you deceive me you are Machkan-an-Athar, the son of the
 King of Lochlann."</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The big man said, "I have never deceived
 any man: I am he. I am now going to tell you why we have not a church in
 Lochlann. Seven masons came to build a church, and they and my father were
 bargaining about the building of it. The agreement that the masons wanted was
 that my mother and sister would go to see the interior of the church when it
 would be finished. My father was glad to get the church built so cheaply. They
 agreed accordingly; and the masons went in the morning to the place where the
 church was to be built. My father pointed out the spot for the foundation. They
 began to build in the morning, and the church was finished before the evening.
 When it was finished they requested my mother and sister to go to see its
 interior. They had no sooner entered than the doors were shut ; and the church
 went away into the skies in the form of a tuft of mist.</p>

 <p>
 <b>"Stretch out your leg, Kayn, till I put a salve of herbs

 great church at Rome, and be In Norway before I sleep.</b></p>
 
 <p>
 Kayn Mac Loy said:</p>
 
 <p>
 <b>"May it be no root to Kayn or a root to any one after
 one, or I be Kayn son of Loy, if I streten out my foot for you to put a saive of
 herbs and heallng on it, till you tell me if you heard what befell your mother
 and sister."</b></p>
 
 <p>
 "Ah!" said the big man, "the mischief is upon
 you; that tale is long to tell ; but I will tell you a short tale about the
 matter. On the day on which they were working at the church I was away in the
 hill hunting game; and when I came home in the evening my brother told me what
 had happened, namely, that my mother and sister had gone away in the form of a
 tuft of mist. I became so cross and angry that I resolved to destroy the world
 till I should find out where my mother and sister were. My brother said to me
 that I was a fool to think of such a thing. ' I'll tell you,' said he, 'what
 you'll do. You will first go to try to find out where they are. When you find
 out where they are you will demand them peaceably, and if you do not get them
 peaceably you will fight for them.'</p>
 
 <p>
 I took my brother's advice, and prepared a ship to set off with.
 I set off alone, and embraced the ocean. I was overtaken by a great mist, and I
 came upon an island, and there was a large number of ships at anchor near it ; I
 went in amongst them, and went ashore. I saw there a big, big woman reaping
 rushes ; and when she would raise her head she would throw her right breast over
 her shoulder and when she would bend it would fall down between her legs. I came
 once behind her, and caught the breast with my mouth, and said to her, 'You are
 yourself witness, woman, that I am the foster-son of your right breast.' ' I
 perceive that, great hero,' said the old woman, 'but my advice to you is to
 leave this island as fast as you can.' 'Why?' said I. 'There is a big giant in
 the cave up there,' said she, 'and every one of the ships that you see he has
 taken in from the ocean with his breath, and he has killed and eaten the men. He
 is asleep at present, and when he wakens he will have you in a similar manner. A
 large iron door and an oak door are on the cave. When the giant draws in his
 breath the doors open, and when be emits his breath the doors shut ; and they
 are shut as fast as though seven small bars, and seven large bars, and seven
 locks were on them. So fast are they that seven crowbars could not force them
 open.' I said to the old woman, 'Is there any way of destroying him ? ' 'I'll
 tell you,' said she, 'how it can be done. He has a weapon above the door that is
 called the short spear and if you succeed in taking off his head with the first
 blow it will be well ; but if you do hot, the case will be worse than it was at
 first.'</p>
 
 <p>
 "I set off; and reached the cave, the two doors of which
 opened. The giant's breath drew me into the cave; and stools, chairs, and pots
 were by its action' dashing against each other, and like to break my legs. The
 door shut when I went in, and was shut as fast as though seven small bars, and
 seven large bars, and seven locks were on it ; and seven crowbars could not
 force it open ; and I was a prisoner in the cave. The giant drew in his breath
 again, and the doors opened. I gave a look upwards, and saw the short spear, and
 laid hold of it. I drew the short spear, and I warrant you that I dealt him such
 a blow with it as did not re. quire to be repeated ; I swept the head off him. I
 took the head down to the old woman, who was reaping the rushes, and said to
 her, ' There is the giant's head for you.' The old woman said, ' Brave man ! I
 knew that you were a hero. This island had need of your coming to it to-day.
 Unless you deceive me, you are Mac Connachar son of the King of Lochlann.' 'I
 have never deceived a man. I am he,' said I. 'I am a soothsayer,' said she, '
 and know the object of your journey. You are going in quest of your mother and
 sister.' ' Well,' said I, 'I am so far on the way if I only knew where to go for
 them.' ' I'll tell you where they are,' said she ; 'they are in the kingdom of
 the Red Shield, and the King of the Red Shield is resolved to marry <i>your </i>mother,
 and his son is resolved to marry your sister. I'll tell you how the town is
 situated. A canal of seven times seven paces breadth surrounds it. On the canal
 there is a drawbridge, which is guarded during the day by two creatures that no
 weapon can pierce, as they are covered all over with scales, except two spots
 below the neck in which their death-wounds lie. Their names are Roar and Rustle.
 When night comes the bridge is raised, and the monsters sleep. A very high and
 big wall surrounds the king's palace.'</p>
 
 <p>
 <b>"Stretch out your leg, Kayn, tlll I put a salve of herbs

 <p>
 Kayn Mac Loy said</p>
 
 <p>
 <b>"May it be no foot to Kayn or a foot to any one after
 one, or I be Kayn son of Loy, if I stretch out my foot for you to put a salve of
 herbs and healing on It, till you tell me if you went farther in search of your
 mother and sister, or if you returned home, or what befell you."</b></p>
 
 <p>
 "Ah ! " said the big man, "the mischief is upon
 you that tale is long to tell ; but I will tell you another tale. I set off; and
 reached the big town of the Red Shield; and it was surrounded by a canal, as the
 old woman told me; and there was a drawbridge on the canal. It was night when I
 arrived, and the bridge was raised, and the monsters were asleep. I measured two
 feet before me and a foot behind me of the ground on which I was standing, and I
 sprang on the end of my spear and on my tiptoes, and reached the place where the
 monsters were asleep; and I drew the short spear, and I warrant you that I dealt
 them such a blow below the neck as did not require to be repeated. I took up the
 heads and hung them on one of the posts of the bridge. I then went on to the
 wall that surrounded the king's palace. This wall was so high that it was not
 easy for me to spring over it ; and I set to work with the short spear, and dug
 a hole through it, and got in. I went to the door of the palace and knocked and
 the doorkeeper called out, 'Who is there ? ' 'It is I,' said I. My mother and
 sister recognised my speech ; and my mother called, ' Oh ! it is my son ; let
 him in.' I then got in, and they rose to meet me with great joy. I was supplied
 with food, drink, and a good bed. In the morning breakfast was set before us;
 and after it I said to my mother and sister that they had better make ready, and
 go with me. The King of the Red Shield said, 'It shall not be so. I am resolved
 to marry your mother, and my son is resolved to marry your sister.' 'If you wish
 to marry my mother, and if your son wishes to marry my sister, let both of you
 accompany me to my home, and you shall get them there.' The King of the Red
 Shield said, 'So be it.'</p>
 
 <p>
 We then set off; and came to where my ship was, went on board of
 it, and sailed home. When we were passing a place where a great battle was going
 on, I asked the King of the Red Shield what battle it was, and the cause of it.</p>
 
 <p>
 'Don't you know at all?" said the King of the Red Shield.
 'I do not,' said I. The King of the Red Shield said, 'That is the battle for the
 daughter of the King of the Great Universe, the most beautiful woman in the
 world; and whoever wins her by his heroism shall get her in marriage.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Do you see yonder castle ?' 'I do,' said I. 'She is on the top
 of that castle, and sees from it the hero that wins her,' said the King of the
 Red Shield. I requested to be put on shore, that I might win her by my swiftness
 and strength. They put me on shore; and I got a sight of her on the top of the
 castle. Having measured two feet behind me and a foot before me, I sprang on the
 end of my spear and on my tiptoes, and reached the top of the castle and I
 caught the daughter of the King of the Universe in my arms and flung her over
 the castle. I was with her and intercepted her before she reached the ground,
 and I took her away on my shoulder, and set off to the shore as fast as I could,
 and delivered her to the King of the Red Shield to be put on board the ship. Am
 I not the best warrior that ever sought you ? said I. 'You can jump well' said
 she, ' but I have not seen any of your prowess. I turned back to meet the
 warriors, and attacked them with the short spear, and did not leave a head on a
 neck of any of them. I then returned, and called to the King of the Red Shield
 to come in to the shore for me. Pretending not to hear me, he set the sails in
 order to return home with the daughter of the King of the Great Universe, and
 marry her. I measured two feet behind me and a foot before me, and sprang on the
 end of my spear and on my tiptoes and got on board the ship. I then said to the
 King of the Red Shield, 'WI)at were you going to do? Why did you not wait for me
 ?' 'Oh !' said the king, 'I was only making the ship ready and setting the sails
 to her before going on shore for you. Do you know what I am thinking of?' ' I do
 not,' said I. ' It is,' said the King, 'that I will return home with the
 daughter of the King of the Great Universe, and that you shall go home with your
 mother and sister.' 'That is not to be the way of it,' said I. ' She whom I have

 "The king had a red shield, and if be should get it on, no
 weapon could make an impression on him. He began to put on the red shield, and I
 struck him with the short spear in the middle of his body, and cut him in two,
 and threw him overboard. I then struck the son, and swept his head off; and
 threw him overboard.</p>

 <p>
 ''Ah! the mischief is upon you," said
 the big man; ''I will tefl you another short tale. I came home with my mother
 and sister, and the daughter of the King of the Universe, and I married the
 daughter of the King of the Universe. The first son I had I named
 Machkan-na-skayajayrika (son of the red shield). Not long after this a hostile
 force came to enforce compensation for the King of the Red Shield, and a hostile
 force came from the King of the Universe to enforce compensation for the
 daughter of the King of the Universe. I took the daughter of the King of the
 Universe with me on the one shoulder and Machkan-na-skaya-jayrika on the other,
 and I went on board the ship and set the sails to her, and I placed the ensign
 of the King of the Great Universe on the one mast, and that of the King of the
 Red Shield on the other, and I blew a trumpet, and passed through the midst of
 them, and I said to them that here was the man, and that if they were going to
 enforce their claims, this was the time. All the ships that were there chased me
 ; and we set out on the expanse of ocean. My ship would be equalled in speed by
 but few. One day a thick dark mist came on, and they lost sight of me. It
 happened that I came to an island called The Wet Mantle. I built a hut there;
 and another son was born to me, and I called him Son of the Wet Mantle.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 "I was a long time in that island ; but there was enough of
 fruit, fish, and birds in it. My two sons had grown to be somewhat big. As I was
 one day out killing birds, I saw a big, big man coming towards the island, and I
 ran to try if I could get into the house before him. He met me, and caught me,
 and put me into a bog up to the armpits, and he went into the house, and took
 out on his shoulder the daughter of the King of the Universe, and passed close
 to me in order to irritate me the more. The saddest look that I ever gave or
 ever shall give was that I gave when I saw the daughter of the King of the
 Universe on the shoulder of another, and could not take her from him. The boys
 came out where I was ; and I bade them bring me the short spear from the house.
 They dragged the short spear after them, and brought it to me; and I cut the
 ground around me with it till I got out.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I was a long time in the Wet Mantle, even till my two sons
 grew to be big lads. They asked me one day if I had any thought of going to seek
 their mother. I told them that I was waiting till they were stronger, and that
 they should then go with me. They said that they were ready to go with me at any
 time. I said to them that we had better get the ship ready, and go. They said,
 'Let each of us have a ship to himself.' We arranged accordingly; and each went
 his own way.</p>
 
 <p>
 "As I happened one day to be passing close to land I saw a
 great battle going on. Being under vows never to pass a battle without helping
 the weaker side, I went on shore, and set to work with the weaker side, and I
 knocked the head off every one with the short spear. Being tired, I lay myself
 down among the bodies and fell asleep.</p>
 
 <p>
 <b>"Stretch out your leg, Kayn, till I put a salve of herbs
 and healing to it. Salve and binding herb and the poltice are cooling; the worm
 is channering. Pressure and baste hard bind me, for I must hear Mass In the

 <p>
 Kayn Mac Loy said:</p>
 
 <p>
 <b>"May it be no foot to Kayn or a foot to any one after
 one, or I be Kayn son of Loy, if I stretch out my foot for you to put a salve of
 herbs and healing on it, till you tell me if you found the daughter of the King

 <p>
 "The mischief is upon you," said the big man ; that
 tale is long to tell, but I will tell another short tale. When I awoke out of
 sleep I saw a ship making for the place where I was lying, and a big giant with
 only one eye dragging it after him : and the ocean reached no higher than his
 knees. He had a big fishing-rod with a big strong line hanging from it on which
 was a very big hook. He was throwing the line ashore, and fixing the hook in a
 body, and lifting it on board, and he continued this work till the ship was
 loaded with bodies. He fixed the hook once in my clothes; but I was so heavy
 that the rod could not carry me on board. He had to go on shore himself, and
 carry me on board in his arms. I was then in a worse plight than I ever was in.
 The giant set off with the ship, which he dragged after him, and reached a big,
 precipitous rock, in the face of which he had a large cave : and a damsel as
 beautiful as I ever saw came out, and stood in the door of the cave.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 He was handing the bodies to her, and she was taking hold of
 them and putting them into the cave. As she took hold of each body she said,
 'Are you alive ?' At last the giant took hold of me, and handed me in to her,
 and said, ' Keep him apart ; he is a large body, and I will have him to
 breakfast the first day that I go from home.'</p>
 
 <p>
 My best time was not when I heard the giant's sentence upon me.
 When he had eaten enough of the bodies, his dinner and supper, he lay down to
 sleep. When he began to snore the damsel came to speak to me; and she told me
 that she was a king's daughter the giant had stolen away and that she had no way
 of getting away from him. I am now,' she said, 'seven years except two days with
 him, and there is a drawn sword between us. He dared not come nearer me than
 that till the seven years should expire.' I said to her, ' Is there no way of
 killing him ?' 'It is not easy to kill him, but we will devise an expedient for
 killing him,' said she. 'Look at that pointed bar that he uses for roasting the
 bodies. At dead of night gather the embers of the fire together, and put the bar
 in the fire till it be red. Go, then, and thrust it into his eye with all your
 strength, and take care that he does not get hold of you, for if he does he will
 mince you as small as midges.' I then went and gathered the embers together, and
 put the bar in the fire, and made it red, and thrust it into his eye ; and from
 the cry that he gave I thought that the rock had split. The giant sprang to his
 feet and chased me through the cave in order to catch me; and I picked up a
 stone that lay on the floor of the cave, and pitched it into the sea ; and it
 made a plumping noise. The bar was sticking in his eye all the time. Thinking it
 was I that had sprung into the sea, he rushed to the mouth of the cave, and the
 bar struck against the doorpost of the cave, and knocked off his brain-cap. The
 giant fell down cold and dead, and the damsel and I were seven years and seven
 days throwing him into the sea in pieces.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I wedded the damsel, and a boy was born to us. After seven
 years I started forth again.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I gave her a gold ring, with my name on it, for the boy,
 and when be was old enough he was sent out to seek me.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I then set off to the place where I fought the battle, and
 found the short spear where I left it ; and I was very pleased that I found it,
 and that the ship was safe. I sailed a day's distance from that place, and
 entered a pretty bay that was there, hauled my ship up above the shore, and
 erected a hut there, in which I slept at night. When I rose next day I saw a
 ship making straight for the place where I was. When it struck the ground, a
 big, strong champion came out of it, and hauled it up ; and if it did not
 surpass my ship it was not a whit inferior to it and I said to him, 'What
 impertinent fellow are you that has dared to haul up your ship alongside of my
 ship ?' 'I am Machkan-na-skaya-jayrika,' said the champion, 'going to seek the
 daughter of the King of the Universe for Mac Connachar, son of the King of
 Lochlann.' I saluted and welcomed him, and said to him, ' I am your father : it
 is well that you have come.' We passed the night cheerily in the hut.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 "When I arose on the following day I saw
 another ship making straight for the place where I was ; and a big, strong hero
 came out of it, and hauled it up alongside of our ships ; and if it did not
 surpass them it was not a whit inferior to them. ' What impertinent fellow are
 you that has dared to haul up your ship alongside of our ships ?' said I. 'I
 am,' said he, 'the Son of the Wet Mantle, going to seek the daughter of the King
 of the Universe for Mac Connachar, son of the King of Lochlann.' 'I am your
 father, and this is your brother : it is well that you have come,' said I, We
 passed the night together in the hut, my two sons and I.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 When I rose next day I saw another ship coming, and making
 straight for the place where I was. A big, strong champion sprang out of it, and
 hauled it up alongside of our ships ; and if it was not higher than they, it was
 not lower. I went down where he was, and said to him, 'What impertinent fellow
 are you that has dared to haul up your ship alongside of our ships? ' 'I am the
 Son of the Wet Mantle,' said he, 'going to seek the daughter of the King of the
 Universe for Mac Connachar, son of the King of Lochlann. Have you any token in
 proof of that?' said I. 'I have,' said he: 'here is a ring that my mother gave
 me at my father's request.' I took hold of the ring, and saw my name on it : and
 the matter was beyond doubt. I said to him, 'I am your father, and here are two
 half-brothers of yours. We are now stronger for going in quest of the daughter
 of the King of the Universe. Four piles are stronger than three piles.' We spent
 that night cheerily and comfortably together in the hut.</p>
 
 <p>
 "On the morrow we met a soothsayer, and he spoke to us:
 'You are going in quest of the daughter of the King of the Universe. I will tell
 you where she is : she is with the Son of the Blackbird.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 "Machkan-na-skaya-jayrika then went and
 called for combat with a hundred fully trained heroes, or the sending out to him
 of the daughter of the King of the Universe. The hundred went out ; and he and
 they began on each other, and he killed every one of them. The Son of the Wet
 Mantle called for combat with another hundred, or the sending out of the
 daughter of the King of the Universe. He killed that hundred with the short
 spear. The Son of Secret called for combat with another hundred, or the daughter
 of the King of the Universe. He killed every one of these with the short spear.
 I then went out to the field, and sounded a challenge on the shield, and made
 the town tremble. The Son of the Blackbird had not a man to send out : he had to
 come out himself; and he and I began on each other, and I drew the short spear,
 and swept his head off. I then went into the castle, and took out the daughter
 of the King of the Universe. It was thus that it fared with me.</p>

 <p>
 Kayn Mac Loy stretched his leg; and the big man applied to it
 leaves of herbs and healing ; and it was healed. The big man took him ashore
 from the island, and allowed him to go home to the king.</p>

 Thus did O'Cronicert win and lose a wife, and thus befell the
 Leeching of the leg of Kayn, son of Loy.</p>
