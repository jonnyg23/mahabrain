 <center><h1>The Ridere of Riddles</h1></center>
   <p>
 THERE
   was a king once, and he married a great lady, and she departed on the birth of
   her first son. And a little after this the king married another wife, and she
   too had a son. The two lads grew up tall and strong. Then it struck the queen
   that it was not her son who would come into the kingdom; and she set it before
   her that she would poison the eldest son. And so she sent advice to the cooks
   that they should put poison in the drink of the heir; but as luck was in it,
   the youngest brother heard them, and he told his brother not to take the
   draught, nor to drink it at all; and so he did. But the queen wondered that
   the lad was not dead; and she thought that there was not enough of poison in
   the drink, and she asked the cook to put in more on the second night. It was
   thus they did: and when the cook made up the drink, she said that be would not
   be long alive after this draught. But his brother heard this also, and told
   him likewise. The eldest thought be would put the draught into a little
   bottle, and he said to his brother-" If I stay in this house I have no
   doubt she will do for me some way or other, and the quicker I leave the house
   the better. I will take the world for my pillow, and there is no knowing what
   fortune will be on me. His brother said that he would go with him, and they
   took themselves off to the stable, and they put saddles on two horses and they
   took their soles out of that.</p>
 
   <p>
 They had not gone very far from the house when the eldest one
   said-" There is no knowing if poison was in the drink at all, though we
   went away. Try it in the horse's ear and we shall see." The horse did not
   go far before he fell. "That was only a rattle-bones of a horse
   anyway," said the eldest one, and they got up together on the other
   horse, and so they went forwards. " But," said he, "I can
   scarce believe that there is any poison in the drink; let's try it on this
   horse." That he did, and they went not far when the horse fell cold dead.
   They thought they'd take the hide off him, and that it would keep them warm at
   night which was close at hand. In the morning when they woke they saw twelve
   ravens come and light on the carcase of the horse, and they were not long
   there when they fell down dead.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 They went and lifted the ravens, and they
 took then' with them, and the first town they reached they gave the ravens to a
 baker, and they asked him to make a dozen pies of the ravens. They took the pies
 with them, and they went forward on their journey. About the mouth of night, and
 when they were in a great thick wood, there came four and twenty robbers who
 bade them to deliver up their purses; but they said that they had no purse, but
 only a little food which they were carrying with them. "Good is even meat
 !" said the robbers, and they began to eat it, but had not eaten much when
 they fell hither and thither, all stone dead. When they saw that the robbers
 were dead they ransacked their pockets, and got much gold and silver. They went
 forward till they reached the Knight of Riddles.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The house of the Knight of Riddles was in the finest place in
 that country, and if his house was pretty, his daughter was prettier, and she
 had twelve inaldens with her only less fair than she. Her like was not on the
 surface of the world, altogether so handsome was she; and no one would get her
 to marry but the man who could put a question to her father that he could not
 solve. The brothers thought that they would go and try to put a question to him'
 and the youngest was to stand in place of gillie to the elder brother. They
 reached the house of the Knight of Riddles and this was the question they put to
 him - " One killed two, and two killed twelve, and twelve killed four and
 twenty, and two got out of it;" and they were to be kept in great majesty
 and high honour till he should solve the riddle.</p>
 
 <p>
 They were thus a while with the Ridere, and try as he might he
 could not guess the riddle. On a day of days came one of the maidens who were
 with the knight's daughter to the gillie, and asked him to tell her the
 question. He took her plaid from her and let her go, but he told her nothing.
 The same thing happened to the twelve maidens, day after day, and the gillie
 said to the last one that no creature had the answer to the riddle but his
 master down below. One day after this came the knight's daughter to the eldest
 brother, and looking her finest and handsomest, and she asked him to tell her
 the question. And now there was no refusing her, and he told her, but he kept
 her plaid. The Knight of Riddles sent for him, and he gave him the answer of the
 riddle. And the knight said that he had two choices to lose his head, or to be
 set adrift in a crazy boat without food or drink, without oar or scoop. The
 elder brother spoke, and he said - " I have another riddle to put to thee
 before all these things happen." "Say on," said the knight.
 " Myself and my gillie were one day in the forest shooting. My gillie fired
 at a hare, and she fell, and he took her skin off<i>, </i>and let her go; and so
 he did to twelve, he took their skins off and let them go. And at last came a
 great fine hare, and I myself fired at her, and I took her skin off, and I let
 her go." "Indeed thy riddle is not hard to solve, my lad," said
 the knight, and he knew the lad knew he had not really guessed the riddle, but
 had been told the answer. So he gave him his daughter to wife, to make him hold
 his peace, and they made a great hearty wedding that lasted a day and a year.
 The youngest one went home now that his brother had got so well on his way, and
 the eldest brother gave him every right over the kingdom that was at home.</p>
 
 <p>
 Now there were near the march of the kingdom of the Knight of
 Riddles three giants, and they were always murdering and slaying sume of the
 knight's people, and taking spoil from them. On a day of days the Knight of
 Riddles said to his son-in-law, that if the spirit of a man were in him, he
 would go to kill the giants, as they were always bringing such losses on the
 country. Well, so it was, he went and he met the giants, and he came home with
 the three giants' heads, and he threw them at the knight's feet.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Thou art an able lad doubtless, and thy name hereafter is
 the Hero of the White Shield." The name of the Hero of the White Shield
 went far and near.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Meanwhile the brother of the Hero of the White Shield had
 wandered afar in many countries, and after long years had come to the land of
 the giants where the Hero of the White Shield was now dwelling, and the knight's
 daughter with him. His brother came and he asked to make a <i>covrag </i>or
 fight as a bull with him. The men began at each other, and they took to
 wrestling from morning till evening. At last and at length, when they were
 tired, weak, and spent, the Hero of the White Shield jumped over a great
 rampart, and he asked the stranger to meet him in the morning. This leap put the
 other to shame, and he said to him, "Well may it be that thou wilt not be
 so supple about this time to-morrow. The young brother now went to a poor little
 bothy that was near to the house of the Hero of the White Shield, tired and
 drowsy, and in the morning they dared the fight again. And the Hero of the White
 Shield began to go back, till he went backwards into a river. "There must
 be some of my blood in thee before that was done to me." "Of what
 blood art thou ?" said the youngest. "'Tis I am son of Ardan, great
 King of the Albann." " 'Tis I am thy brother." It was now they
 knew each other. They gave luck and welcome to each other, and the Hero of the
 White Shield now took him into the palace, and she it was that was pleased to
 see him-the knight's daughter. He stayed a while with them, and after that he
 thought that he would go home to his own kingdom and when he was going past a
 great palace that was there he saw twelve men playing at shinny over against the
 palace. He thought he would go for a while and play shinny with them ; but they
 were not long playing shinny when they fell out, and the weakest of them caught
 him and shook him as he would a child. He thought it was no use for him to lift
 a hand amongst these twelve worthies, and he asked them to whom they were sons.
 They said they were children of the one father, the brother of the Hero of the
 White Shield, who had not been heard of for many years. "I am your
 father," said he ; and he asked them if their mother was alive. They said
 that she was. He went with them till he found the mother, and he took her home
 with him and the twelve sons ; and I don't know but that his seed are kings on
 Alba till this very day.</p>
