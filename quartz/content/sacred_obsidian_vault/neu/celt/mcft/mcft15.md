 <center><h1>Elidore</h1></center>
   <p>
 IN the
   days of Henry Beauclerc of England there was a little lad named Elidore, who
   was being brought up to be a cleric. Day after day he would trudge from his
   mother's house, and she was a widow, up to the monks' Scriptorium. There he
   would learn his A B C, to read it and to write it. But he was a lazy little
   rogue was this Elidore, and as fast as he learned to write one letter, he
   forgot another ; so it was very little progress he was making. Now when the
   good monks saw this they remembered the saying of the Book " Spare the
   rod and spoil the child," and whenever Elidore forgot a letter they tried
   to make him remember it with the rod. At first they used it seldom and
   lightly, but Elidore was not a boy to be driven, and the more they thwacked
   him the less he learned : so the thwackings became more frequent and more
   severe, till Elidore could not stand any longer. So one day when he was twelve
   years old he upped with them and offed with him into the great forest near St.
   David's. There for two long days and nights he wandered about eating nothing
   but hips and haws. At last he found himself at the mouth of a cave, at the
   side of a river, and there he sank down, all tired and exhausted. Suddenly two
   little pigmies appeared to him and said "Come with us, and we will lead
   you into a land full of games and sports: " so Elidore raised himself and
   went with these two; at first through an underground passage all in the dark,
   but soon they came out into a most beautiful country, with rivers and meadows,
   woods and plains, as pleasant as can be; only this there curious about it,
   that the sun never shone and clouds were always over the sky, so that neither
   sun was seen by day, nor moon and stars at night.</p>

   <p>
 The two little men led Elidore before their king, who asked
   why and whence he came. Elidore told him, and the king said : "Thou shalt
   attend on my son," and waved him away. So for a long time Elidore waited
   on the king's son, and joined in all the games and sports of the little men.</p>
 
   <p>
 They were little, but they were not dwarfs, for all their
   limbs were of suitable size one with another. Their hair was fair, and hung
   upon their shoulders like that of women. They had little horses, about the
   size of greyhounds ; and did not eat flesh, fowl, or fish, but lived on milk
   flavoured with saffron. And as they had such curious ways, so they had strange
   thoughts. No oath took they, but never a lie they spoke. They would jeer and
   scoff at men for their struggles, lying, and treachery. Yet though they were
   so good they worshipped none, unless you might say they were worshippers of
   Truth.</p>
 
   <p>
 After a time Elidore began to long to see boys and men of his
   own size, and he begged permission to go and visit his mother. So the King
   gave him permission so the little men led him along the passage, and guided
   him through the forest, till he came near his mother's cottage, and when he
   entered, was not she rejoiced to see her dear son again ? " Where have
   you been? What have you done?" she cried ; and he had to tell her all
   that had happened to him. She begged of him to stay with her, but he had
   promised the King to go back. And soon he returned, after making his mother
   promise not to tell where he was, or with whom. Henceforth Elidore lived,
   partly with the little men, and partly with his mother. Now one day, when he
   was with his mother, be told her of the yellow balls they used in their play,
   and which she felt sure must be of gold. So she begged of him that the next
   time he came back to her he would bring with him one of these balls. When the
   time came for him to go back to his mother again, he did not wait for the
   little men to guide him back, as he now knew the road. But seizing one of the
   yellow balls with which he used to play, he rushed home through the passage.
   Now as he got near his mother's house he seemed to hear tiny footsteps behind
   him, and he rushed up to the door as quickly as he could. Just as he reached
   it his foot sJipped, and he fell down, and the ball rolled out of his hand,
   just to the feet of his mother. At that moment two little men rushed forward,
   seized the ball and ran away, making faces, and spitting at the boy as they
   passed him. Elidore remained with his mother for a time; but he missed the
   play and games of the little men, and determined to go back to them. But when
   he came to where the cave had been, near the river where the under-ground
   passage commenced, he could not find it again, and though he searched again
   and again in the years to come, he could not get back to that fair country. So
   after a time he went back to the monastery, and became in due course a monk.
   And men used to come and seek him out, and ask him what had happened to him
   when he was in the Land of the Little Men. Nor could he ever speak of that
   happy time without shedding tears.</p>
 
   
   <p>
 Now it happened once, when this Elidore was
   old, that David, Bishop of St. David's, came to visit his monastery and ask
   him about the manners and customs of the little men, and above all, he was
   curious to know what language they spoke ; and Elidore told him some of their
   words. When they asked for water, they would say : <i>Udor udorum; </i>and
   when they wanted salt, they would say : <i>Hapru udorum. </i>And from this,
   the Bishop, who was a learned man, discovered that they spoke some sort of
   Greek. For <i>Udor </i>is Greek for <i>Water, </i>and Hap for <i>Salt.</i></p>
 
   
   <p>
 Hence we know that the Britons came from Troy, being
   descendants from Brito, son of Priam, King of Troy.</p>
