 <center><h1>               THE TALE OF THE ENSORCELED PRINCE
 </h1></center><p>  KNOW then, O my lord, that whilom my sire was King of this city, and
 his name was Mahmud, entitled Lord of the Black Islands, and owner
 of what are now these four mountains. He ruled threescore and ten
 years, after which he went to the mercy of the Lord and I reigned as
 Sultan in his stead. I took to wife my cousin, the daughter of my
 paternal uncle, and she loved me with such abounding love that
 whenever I was absent she ate not and she drank not until she saw me
 again. She cohabited with me for five years till a certain day when
 she went forth to the hammam bath, and I bade the cook hasten to get
 ready all requisites for our supper. And I entered this palace and lay
 down on the bed where I was wont to sleep and bade two damsels to
 fan my face, one sitting by my head and the other at my feet.
 </p><p>  But I was troubled and made restless by my wife's absence and
 could not sleep, for although my eyes were closed, my mind and
 thoughts were wide-awake. Presently I heard the slave girl at my
 head say to her at my feet: "O Mas'udah, how miserable is our master
 and how wasted in his youth, and oh! the pity of his being so betrayed
 by our mistress, the accursed whore!" The other replied: "Yes
 indeed. Allah curse all faithless women and adulterous! But the like
 of our master, with his fair gifts, deserveth something better than
 this harlot who lieth abroad every night." Then quoth she who sat by
 my head, "Is our lord dumb or fit only for bubbling that he
 questioneth her not!" and quoth the other: "Fie on thee! Doth our lord
 know her ways, or doth she allow him his choice? Nay, more, doth she
 not drug every night the cup she giveth him to drink before sleeptime,
 and put bhang into it? So he sleepeth and wotteth not whither she
 goeth, nor what she doeth, but we know that after giving him the
 drugged wine, she donneth her richest raiment and perfumeth herself
 and then she fareth out from him to be away till break of day. Then
 she cometh to him and burneth a pastille under his nose and he awaketh
 from his death-like sleep." When I heard the slave girls' words, the
 light became black before my sight and I thought night would never
 fall.
 </p><p>  Presently the daughter of my uncle came from the baths, and they set
 the table for us and we ate and sat together a fair half-hour quaffing
 our wine, as was ever our wont. Then she called for the particular
 wine I used to drink before sleeping and reached me the cup, but,
 seeming to drink it according to my wont, I poured the contents into
 my bosom and, lying down, let her hear that I was asleep. Then,
 behold, she cried: "Sleep out the night, and never wake again! By
 Allah, I loathe thee and I loathe thy whole body, and my soul
 turneth in disgust from cohabiting with thee, and I see not the moment
 when Allah shall snatch away thy life!" Then she rose and donned her
 fairest dress and perfumed her person and slung my sword over her
 shoulder, and opening the gates of the palace, went her ill way.
 </p><p>  I rose and followed her as she left the palace and she threaded
 the streets until she came to the city gate, where she spoke words I
 understood not and the padlocks dropped of themselves as if broken and
 the gate leaves opened. She went forth (and I after her without her
 noticing aught) till she came at last to the outlying mounds and a
 reed fence built about a round-roofed hut of mud bricks. As she
 entered the door, I climbed upon the roof, which commanded a view of
 the interior, And lo! my fair cousin had gone in to a hideous Negro
 slave with his upper lip like the cover of a pot and his lower like an
 open pot, lips which might sweep up sand from the gravel floor of
 the cot. He was to boot a leper and a paralytic, lying upon a strew of
 sugar-cane trash and wrapped in an old blanket and the foulest rags
 and tatters.
 </p><p>  She kissed the earth before him, and he raised his head so as to see
 her and said: "Woe to thee! What call hadst thou to stay away all this
 time? Here have been with me sundry of the black brethren, who drank
 their wine and each had his young lady, and I was not content to drink
 because of thine absence." Then she: "O my lord, my heart's love and
 coolth of my eyes, knowest thou not that I am married to my cousin,
 whose very look I loathe, and hate myself when in his company? And did
 not I fear for thy sake, I would not let a single sun arise before
 making his city a ruined heap wherein raven should croak and howlet
 hoot, and jackal and wolf harbor and loot- nay, I had removed its
 very stones to the back side of Mount Kaf." Rejoined the slave:
 "Thou liest, damn thee! Now I swear an oath by the valor and honor
 of blackamoor men (and deem not our manliness to be the poor manliness
 of white men), from today forth if thou stay away till this hour, I
 will not keep company with thee nor will I glue my body with thy body.
 Dost play fast and loose with us, thou cracked pot, that we may
 satisfy thy dirty lusts, O vilest of the vile whites?"
 </p><p>  When I heard his words, and saw with my own eyes what passed between
 these two wretches, the world waxed dark before my face and my soul
 knew not in what place it was. But my wife humbly stood up weeping
 before and wheedling the slave, and saying: "O my beloved, and very
 fruit of my heart, there is none left to cheer me but thy dear self,
 and, if thou cast me off, who shall take me in, O my beloved, O
 light of my eyes?" And she ceased not weeping and abasing herself to
 him until he deigned be reconciled with her. Then was she right glad
 and stood up and doffed her clothes, even to her petticoat trousers,
 and said, "O my master, what hast thou here for thy handmaiden to
 eat?" "Uncover the basin," he grumbled, "and thou shalt find at the
 bottom the broiled bones of some rats we dined on. Pick at them, and
 then go to that slop pot, where thou shalt find some leavings of
 beer which thou mayest drink." So she ate and drank and washed her
 hands, and went and lay down by the side of the slave upon the cane
 trash and crept in with him under his foul coverlet and his rags and
 tatters.
 </p><p>  When I saw my wife, my cousin, the daughter of my uncle, do this
 deed, I clean lost my wits, and climbing down from the roof, I entered
 and took the sword which she had with her and drew it, determined to
 cut down the twain. I first struck at the slave's neck and thought
 that the death decree had fallen on him, for he groaned a loud hissing
 groan, but I had cut only the skin and flesh of the gullet and the two
 arteries! It awoke the daughter of my uncle, so I sheathed the sword
 and fared forth for the city, and entering the palace, lay upon my bed
 and slept till morning, when my wife aroused me and I saw that she had
 cut off her hair and had donned mourning garments. Quoth she: "O son
 of my uncle, blame me not for what I do. It hath just reached me
 that my mother is dead and my father hath been killed in holy war, and
 of my brothers one hath lost his life by a snake sting and the other
 by falling down some precipice, and I can and should do naught save
 weep and lament."
 </p><p>  When I heard her words I refrained from all reproach and said
 only: "Do as thou list. I certainly will not thwart thee." She
 continued sorrowing, weeping and wailing one whole year from the
 beginning of its circle to the end, and when it was finished she
 said to me: "I wish to build me in thy palace a tomb with a cupola,
 which I will set apart for my mourning and will name the House of
 Lamentations." Quoth I again: "Do as thou list!" Then she builded
 for herself a cenotaph wherein to mourn, and set on its center a
 dome under which showed a tomb like a santon's sepulcher. Thither
 she carried the slave and lodged him, but he was exceeding weak by
 reason of his wound, and unable to do her love service. He could
 only drink wine, and from the day of his hurt he spake not a word, yet
 he lived on because his appointed hour was not come. Every day,
 morning and evening, my wife went to him and wept and wailed over
 him and gave him wine and strong soups, and left not off doing after
 this manner a second year. And I bore with her patiently and paid no
 heed to her.
 </p><p>  One day, however, I went in to her unawares, and I found her weeping
 and beating her face and crying: "Why art thou absent from my sight, O
 my heart's delight? Speak to me, O my life, talk with me, O my
 love." When she had ended for a time her words and her weeping I
 said to her, "O my cousin, let this thy mourning suffice, for in
 pouring forth tears there is little profit!" "Thwart me not," answered
 she, "in aught I do, or I will lay violent hands on myself!" So I held
 my peace and left her to go her own way, and she ceased not to cry and
 keen and indulge her affliction for yet another year. At the end of
 the third year I waxed aweary of this longsome mourning, and one day I
 happened to enter the cenotaph when vexed and angry with some matter
 which had thwarted me, and suddenly I heard her say: "O my lord, I
 never hear thee vouchsafe a single word to me! Why dost thou not
 answer me, O my master?" and she began reciting:
 </p><p>   "O thou tomb! O thou tomb! Be his beauty set in shade?
 <br>   Hast thou darkened that countenance all-sheeny as the noon?
 <br>   O thou tomb! Neither earth nor yet Heaven art to me,
 <br>   Then how cometh it in thee are conjoined my sun and moon?"
 <br></p><p>  When I heard such verses as these rage was heaped upon my rage, I
 cried out: "Wellaway! How long is this sorrow to last?" and I began
 repeating:
 </p><p>   "O thou tomb! O thou tomb! Be his horrors set in blight?
 <br>   Hast thou darkened his countenance that sickeneth the soul?
 <br>   O thou tomb! Neither cesspool nor pigskin art to me,
 <br>   Then how cometh it in thee are conjoined soil and coal?"
 <br></p><p>When she heard my words she sprang to her feet crying: "Fie upon thee,
 thou cur! All this is of thy doings. Thou hast wounded my heart's
 darling and thereby worked me sore woe, and thou hast wasted his youth
 so that these three years he hath lain abed more dead than alive!"
 In my wrath I cried: "O thou foulest of harlots and filthiest of
 whores ever futtered by Negro slaves who are hired to have at thee!
 Yes, indeed it was I who did this good deed." And snatching up my
 sword, I drew it and made at her to cut her down. But she laughed my
 words and mine intent to scorn, crying: "To heel, hound that thou art!
 Alas for the past which shall no more come to pass, nor shall anyone
 avail the dead to raise. Allah hath indeed now given into my hand
 him who did to me this thing, a deed that hath burned my heart with
 a fire which died not a flame which might not be quenched!"
 </p><p>  Then she stood up, and pronouncing some words to me
 unintelligible, she said, "By virtue of my egromancy become thou
 half stone and half man!" Whereupon I became what thou seest, unable
 to rise or to sit, and neither dead nor alive. Moreover, she
 ensorceled the city with all its streets and garths, and she turned by
 her gramarye the four islands into four mountains around the tarn
 whereof thou questionest me. And the citizens, who were of four
 different faiths, Moslem, Nazarene, Jew, and Magian, she transformed
 by her enchantments into fishes. The Moslems are the white, the
 Magians red, the Christians blue, and the Jews yellow. And every day
 she tortureth me and scourgeth me with a hundred stripes, each of
 which draweth floods of blood and cutteth the skin of my shoulders
 to strips. And lastly she clotheth my upper half with a haircloth
 and then throweth over them these robes. Hereupon the young man
 again shed tears and began reciting:
 </p><p>   "In patience, O my God, I endure my lot and fate,
 <br>   I will bear at will of Thee whatsoever be my state.
 <br>   They oppress me, they torture me, they make my life a woe,
 <br>   Yet haply Heaven's happiness shall compensate my strait.
 <br>   Yea, straitened is my life by the bane and hate o' foes,
 <br>   But Mustafa and Murtaza shall ope me Heaven's gate."
 <br></p><p>  After this the Sultan turned toward the young Prince and said: "O
 youth, thou hast removed one grief only to add another grief. But now,
 O my friend, where is she, and where is the mausoleum wherein lieth
 the wounded slave?" "The slave lieth under yon dome," quoth the
 young man, "and she sitteth in the chamber fronting yonder door. And
 every day at sunrise she cometh forth, and first strippeth me, and
 whippeth me with a hundred strokes of the leathern scourge, and I weep
 and shriek, but there is no power of motion in my lower limbs to
 keep her off me. After ending her tormenting me she visiteth the
 slave, bringing him wine and boiled meats. And tomorrow at an early
 hour she will be here." Quoth the King: "By Allah, O youth, I will
 assuredly do thee a good deed which the world shall not willingly
 let die, and an act of derring-do which shall be chronicled long after
 I am dead and gone by."
 </p><p>  Then the King sat him by the side of the young Prince and talked
 till nightfall, when he lay down and slept. But as soon as the false
 dawn showed, he arose and, doffing his outer garments, bared his blade
 and hastened to the place wherein lay the slave. Then was he ware of
 lighted candles and lamps, and the perfume of incenses and unguents,
 and directed by these, he made for the slave and struck him one
 stroke, killing him on the spot. After which he lifted him on his back
 and threw him into a well that was in the palace. Presently he
 returned and, donning the slave's gear, lay down at length within
 the mausoleum with the drawn sword laid close to and along his side.
 After an hour or so the accursed witch came, and first going to her
 husband, she stripped off his clothes and, taking a whip, flogged
 him cruelly while he cried out: "Ah! Enough for me the case I am in!
 Take pity on me, O my cousin!" But she replied, "Didst thou take
 pity on me and spare the life of my truelove on whom I doated?"
 </p><p>  Then she drew the cilice over his raw and bleeding skin and threw
 the robe upon all and went down to the slave with a goblet of wine and
 a bowl of meat broth in her hands. She entered under the dome
 weeping and wailing, "Wellaway!" and crying: "O my lord! Speak a
 word to me! O my master! Talk awhile with me!" and began to recite
 these couplets:
 </p><p>     "How long this harshness, this unlove, shall bide?
 <br>     Suffice thee not tear floods thou hast espied?
 <br>     Thou dost prolong our parting purposely
 <br>     And if wouldst please my foe, thou'rt satisfied!"
 <br></p><p>Then she wept again and said: "O my lord! Speak to me, talk with
 me!" The King lowered his voice and, twisting his tongue, spoke
 after the fashion of the blackamoors and said "'Lack, 'lack! There
 be no Majesty and there be no Might save in Allauh, the Gloriose,
 the Great!"
 </p><p>  Now when she heard these words she shouted for joy, and fell to
 the ground fainting, and when her senses returned she asked, "O my
 lord, can it be true that thou hast power of speech?" And the King,
 making his voice small and faint, answered: "O my cuss! Dost thou
 deserve that I talk to thee and speak with thee?" "Why and wherefore?"
 rejoined she, and he replied: "The why is that all the livelong day
 thou tormentest thy hubby, and he keeps calling on 'eaven for aid
 until sleep is strange to me even from evenin' till mawnin', and he
 prays and damns, cussing us two, me and thee, causing me disquiet
 and much bother. Were this not so, I should long ago have got my
 health, and it is this which prevents my answering thee." Quoth she,
 "With thy leave I will release him from what spell is on him," and
 quoth the King, "Release him, and let's have some rest!" She cried,
 "To hear is to obey," and, going from the cenotaph to the palace,
 she took a metal bowl and filled it with water and spake over it
 certain words which made the contents bubble and boil as a caldron
 seetheth over the fire. With this she sprinkled her husband saying,
 "By virtue of the dread words I have spoken, if thou becamest thus
 by my spells, come forth out of that form into thine own former form."
 </p><p>  And lo and behold! the young man shook and trembled, then he rose to
 his feet and, rejoicing at his deliverance, cried aloud, "I testify
 that there is no god but the God, and in very truth Mohammed is His
 Apostle, whom Allah bless and keep!" Then she said to him, "Go forth
 and return not hither, for if thou do I will surely slay thee,"
 screaming these words in his face. So he went from between her
 hands, and she returned to the dome and, going down to the
 sepulcher, she said, "O my lord, come forth to me that I may look upon
 thee and thy goodliness!" The King replied in faint low words: "What
 thing hast thou done? Thou hast rid me of the branch, but not of the
 root." She asked: "O my darling! O my Negroling! What is the root?"
 And he answered: "Fie on thee, O my cuss! The people of this city
 and of the four islands every night when it's half-passed lift their
 heads from the tank in which thou hast turned them to fishes and cry
 to Heaven and call down its anger on me and thee, and this is the
 reason why my body's balked from health. Go at once and set them free,
 then come to me and take my hand, and raise me up, for a little
 strength is already back in me."
 </p><p>  When she heard the King's words (and she still supposed him to be
 the slave) she cried joyously: "O my master, on my head and on my eyes
 be thy command. Bismillah!" So she sprang to her feet and, full of joy
 and gladness, ran down to the tarn and took a little of its water in
 the palm of her hand and spake over it words not to be understood, and
 the fishes lifted their heads and stood up on the instant like men,
 the spell on the people of the city having been removed. What was
 the lake again became a crowded capital. The bazaars were thronged
 with folk who bought and sold, each citizen was occupied with his
 own calling, and the four hills became islands as they were whilom.
 </p><p>  Then the young woman, that wicked sorceress, returned to the King
 and (still thinking he was the Negro) said to him: "O my love! Stretch
 forth thy honored hand that I may assist thee to rise." "Nearer to
 me," quoth the King in a faint and feigned tone. She came close as
 to embrace him, when he took up the sword lying hid by his side and
 smote her across the breast, so that the point showed gleaming
 behind her back. Then he smote her a second time and cut her in
 twain and cast her to the ground in two halves. After which he fared
 forth and found the young man, now freed from the spell, awaiting
 him and gave him joy of his happy release while the Prince kissed
 his hand with abundant thanks.
 </p><p>  Quoth the King, "Wilt thou abide in this city, or go with me to my
 capital?" Quoth the youth, "O King of the Age, wettest thou not what
 journey is between thee and thy city?" "Two days and a half," answered
 he, whereupon said the other: "An thou be sleeping, O King, awake!
 Between thee and thy city is a year's march for a well-girt walker,
 and thou haddest not come hither in two days and a half save that
 the city was under enchantment. And I, O King, will never part from
 thee- no, not even for the twinkling of an eye." The King rejoiced at
 his words and said: "Thanks be to Allah, Who hath bestowed thee upon
 me! From this hour thou art my son and my only son, for that in all my
 life I have never been blessed with issue." Thereupon they embraced
 and joyed with exceeding great joy. And, reaching the palace, the
 Prince who had been spellbound informed his lords and his grandees
 that he was about to visit the Holy Places as a pilgrim, and bade them
 get ready all things necessary for the occasion.
 </p><p>  The preparations lasted ten days, after which he set out with the
 Sultan, whose heart burned in yearning for his city, whence he had
 been absent a whole twelvemonth. They journeyed with an escort of
 Mamelukes carrying all manners of precious gifts and rarities, nor
 stinted they wayfaring day and night for a full year until they
 approached the Sultan's capital, and sent on messengers to announce
 their coming. Then the Wazir and the whole army came out to meet him
 in joy and gladness, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing
 their King, and the troops kissed the ground before him and wished him
 joy of his safety. He entered and took seat upon his throne and the
 Minister came before him and, when acquainted with all that had
 befallen the young Prince, he congratulated him on his narrow escape.
 </p><p>  When order was restored throughout the land, the King gave largess
 to many of his people, and said to the Wazir, "Hither the fisherman
 who brought us the fishes!" So he sent for the man who had been the
 first cause of the city and the citizens being delivered from
 enchantment, and when he came into the presence, the Sultan bestowed
 upon him a dress of honor, and questioned him of his condition and
 whether he had children. The fisherman gave him to know that he had
 two daughters and a son, so the King sent for them and, taking one
 dauhter to wife, gave the other to the young Prince and made the son
 his head treasurer. Furthermore, he invested his Wazir with the
 Sultanate of the City in the Black Islands whilom belonging to the
 young Prince, and dispatched with him the escort of fifty armed
 slaves, together with dresses of honor for all the emirs and grandees.
 The Wazir kissed hands and fared forth on his way, while the Sultan
 and the Prince abode at home in all the solace and the delight of
 life, and the fisherman became the richest man of his age, and his
 daughters wived with the Kings until death came to them.
 </p><p>  And yet, O King! this is not more wondrous than the story of
